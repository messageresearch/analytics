[17:47] and thank my wife for coming and being

[17:52] brother Chad said we've been a part of
[17:53] the church in Louisville
[17:55] Kentucky there for 35 years helping
[17:57] brother Brad Burgess there and before
[18:00] that we were 17 years at the brandham
[18:02] Tabernacle helping uh we moved there
[18:04] when I was 2 years old so that's kind of
[18:07] my history so I was yesterday I was
[18:09] talking to my wife I said I need to be
[18:10] more like brother Chad he's just so calm
[18:15] and you know just nice and and you know
[18:18] it's this we Billy Graham visited
[18:20] Louisville so Jeffersonville right
[18:22] across the Rivers Louisville Kentucky
[18:23] and we go to church in Louisville but I
[18:25] live in Jeffersonville area all of my
[18:28] life pretty much much and so Billy
[18:30] Graham visited Louisville and he said it
[18:32] was brother Ram quotes him he said it
[18:33] was the most demon powerered place in
[18:35] the whole world so that's just where I
[18:37] live so it's a I mean like I need to be
[18:40] like this brother this brother but you
[18:42] know the battle is intense but God has
[18:44] us all right where he wants us as a
[18:46] little saying you says you got to grow
[18:48] where God's planted you and let's just
[18:50] grow today is that your desire Lord let
[18:52] me grow a little bit amen let's go to
[18:55] the Lord in prayer and as we bow our
[18:57] heads this morning I wonder who would
[18:59] raise their hand and say Lord I have a
[19:00] need this morning I amen I have a need
[19:03] maybe a sickness in my body or something
[19:05] in my family a child or something that's

[19:09] the Lord Heavenly Father Lord as we bow
[19:12] our heads to you Lord we we need you
[19:16] father Lord as we never want to be
[19:18] self-sufficient but we want to always be
[19:21] mindful of our littleness Lord and how
[19:23] much we need you Lord we raise our hands
[19:26] to you and cry Abba Father Heavenly
[19:29] Father may you help us today and speak
[19:30] to the needs of the people Lord I know
[19:32] I'm not adequate to do that but Lord
[19:35] You're the great physician you're the
[19:36] Mighty God you're the counselor you're
[19:39] the prince of peace and I come to you
[19:41] today and we each one come to your
[19:43] throne and surrender ourselves to you
[19:45] and pray that you would help us Lord as
[19:47] we open the Bible I pray God that you
[19:49] would reveal yourself to us in a special
[19:51] way we pray and ask it in Jesus name
[19:54] amen praise the Lord if you have your
[19:57] Bibles go to St John chapter
[20:00] 14 amen it's good to have the freedom to
[20:03] open our Bibles isn't it you know that's
[20:05] a freedom amen and freedom is not free
[20:08] somebody gave their life that we could
[20:10] publicly stand and read our Bibles we
[20:12] should always honor the veterans and
[20:14] those that have gone before us I know we
[20:16] have some of the law enforcement people
[20:18] with us today and God bless our
[20:19] policemen I know they're trying to do
[20:21] away with those things and we have
[20:22] lawlessness that's happened but amen may
[20:25] God Amen help us to remember the
[20:27] freedoms that we have St John chapter 14
[20:30] I just want to read three verses as we
[20:31] launch we got to launch from somewhere
[20:33] right we get up in
[20:36] orbit we don't know where we're going to
[20:38] land but we're going to be up there amen
[20:41] it was at Revelation chapter 4 come up
[20:43] higher man I want to come up higher I I
[20:46] I don't know about you I didn't come to
[20:47] this place to waste my time I said Lord
[20:49] I want to achieve something I want to
[20:51] draw close to God there's a verse in the
[20:53] Bible says draw nigh to God and He will
[20:56] draw nigh to you the Bible says res
[20:58] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[21:01] and so let's draw nigh to God we're
[21:02] going to open his word this is God in
[21:04] letter form St John chapter 14 verse1
[21:08] let not your heart be troubled ye
[21:10] believe in God believe also in me in my
[21:13] father's house are many mansions if it
[21:16] were not so I would have told you this
[21:19] is such a powerful promise from Jesus
[21:21] Christ is it in red in your Bible amen
[21:24] Jesus didn't speak in red letter
[21:26] somebody was kind enough to say hey
[21:27] let's make this red so it's when Jesus
[21:29] spoke but this is when the big man spoke
[21:31] okay he said I go to prepare a place for
[21:35] you I mean that's God's word to each one
[21:38] of us as Christians and if I go and
[21:40] prepare a place for you I will come
[21:42] again and receive you unto myself that
[21:45] where I am there ye may be also and
[21:49] whether I go ye know and the way you
[21:50] know Thomas saith un him Lord we know
[21:53] not whether thou goest and how can we
[21:55] know the way Jesus saith unto him I am
[21:58] the way
[21:59] the truth and the life no man cometh
[22:02] unto the father but by me amen may God
[22:05] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[22:07] seated this morning for a little portion
[22:10] of time I want to speak on the thought
[22:13] things that are to be things that are to
[22:16] be brother Brandon preached a message um
[22:19] entitled things that are to be and he in
[22:23] 1965 December of
[22:26] 1965 and if if you if you listen to the
[22:29] sermon it was December the the 5th and
[22:32] it was 19 days before the Lord would
[22:34] call him and take him home and if you
[22:36] listen to the sermons it's almost as if
[22:38] he's and he says this he said this was
[22:40] as a funeral text and it's like he's
[22:42] actually preaching his funeral and he
[22:44] knows he's coming to this place brother
[22:46] Charlie Cox is my wife's um uh father's
[22:50] Uncle uh down in Kentucky and so the
[22:52] last time brother random was there he he
[22:54] brother ROM was in the car and brother
[22:57] random brother Charlie was standing
[22:58] there and brother am takes his hat off
[22:59] and hands it to brother Charlie said
[23:01] here brother Charlie I want you to take
[23:02] my hat he said no brother am I don't
[23:03] need your hat he said no brother Charlie
[23:05] he said I won't need it anymore and he
[23:06] handed it to him and gave it to him so
[23:09] he knew he was going to cross over if
[23:11] you listen to that message it's as if
[23:13] he's he's preaching his own F funeral
[23:15] and telling us the hope that is in Jesus
[23:17] Christ and so that sermon kind of goes
[23:19] in that direction but as I was listening
[23:21] to it the other day the Holy Spirit
[23:23] began to lead me and show me that you
[23:26] know there there the word is so power
[23:28] powerful and there's so many facets to
[23:30] the word of God you can never exhaust
[23:32] the inspiration amen it's life as Jesus
[23:35] said there my in another place my words
[23:36] are spirit and they're life so they're
[23:39] inspired the word of God is inspired
[23:41] that's why you should read the Bible
[23:42] every day you should start the day
[23:44] reading the Bible and praying and before
[23:46] you go to bed at night you should read
[23:47] the Bible and pray because it's the
[23:49] inspired word of G God it's life and as
[23:52] I begin to study this thing I begin to
[23:54] study things that are to be that you
[23:56] know as we go through life's Journeys
[23:58] there there's things that are to be
[23:59] there's things that are going to happen
[24:01] to us good to see you brother Jonathan
[24:03] and your family amen there's things that
[24:05] are going to happen to us through life
[24:07] just as if we were going to leave this
[24:08] building you know we're going to go out
[24:10] and we're going to go to the road and it
[24:12] tees and we make a right and those are
[24:15] things that are to be you'll go down a
[24:18] little bit farther I'm going to go down
[24:19] i71 in a few hours and you'll get to the
[24:21] next Road you'll make a right and you go
[24:24] down a little bit and I'll get on I75
[24:26] south I'll take that road and along that
[24:28] Journey I'll come to the Big Town of
[24:30] Dayton and then Cincinnati and then I'll
[24:32] head towards Louisville and those are
[24:34] things that are to be are you with me
[24:36] that that's just life if I plan to go on
[24:38] that Journey that way it's just a way of
[24:41] life and there's things that are to be
[24:42] in our life as we make this journey
[24:45] there's just things that happen that as
[24:47] we go through it and the Bible says in 1
[24:49] Corinthians chap 10:1 that the scripture
[24:53] this is our road map it's a it's a map
[24:56] of people who have traveled before you
[24:58] and so when you are going through life
[25:01] things that are to be we look back at
[25:03] the Bible I believe it says there in the
[25:04] scripture all things happened under them
[25:06] for amples they are written for our
[25:09] admonition so people before us that went
[25:12] down this road they wrote down what they
[25:13] saw the same as you go out here and
[25:15] you'll make a right if you're going 65
[25:17] south and things that are to be you'll
[25:19] get up there and you'll make another
[25:20] right to to go to get on the enters say
[25:22] how many are with me today those are
[25:24] things that are to be so I can tell you
[25:26] that because I've been there and I've
[25:28] done done that already and the people
[25:29] that went through the Bible they wrote
[25:31] it down holy men of God were moved by
[25:33] the Holy Spirit and so we see things and
[25:36] so as we go through life and and when
[25:38] you encounter something you go back to
[25:40] the Bible and say where is that in the
[25:42] Bible that'll really help you as you go
[25:44] through life say I don't know I've never
[25:45] encountered sickness before I wonder if
[25:47] anybody else on the road ever
[25:49] encountered sickness oh praise God Amen
[25:52] Jesus knew 2,000 years ago you were
[25:54] going to SI be sick amen that's why it
[25:56] says in Isaiah 53 he was wounded for our
[25:59] transgressions he was bruised for our
[26:01] iniquities we might as well stop right
[26:03] there he for your transgressions he
[26:05] 2,000 years ago were already bruised for
[26:07] those for your iniquities what is
[26:09] Iniquity knowing to do good and not
[26:11] doing it he already took it 2,000 years
[26:13] ago amen and by the Bible says by his
[26:16] stripes you can be healed so the great
[26:19] almighty God knew you would be coming
[26:21] down that road he went down that road
[26:22] and he bore your sickness he bore your
[26:25] pain can you say Amen you might be
[26:27] sitting here in pain but he bore my pain
[26:29] amen I don't have to bear pain and in
[26:32] another place the Bible says a wounded
[26:34] Spirit the Bible says who can bear it
[26:36] maybe you've got a wounded Spirit and
[26:37] the Bible says who can bear it you can't
[26:39] bear it amen but he said the Bible says
[26:41] he came to bind up the Brokenhearted oh
[26:44] it's wonderful to be a Christian it's
[26:46] wonderful to be in the house of God and
[26:47] come to the great physician and no
[26:49] matter what need you have you can come
[26:51] to the great physician and say Here I Am
[26:54] here's my symptoms but I'm not telling
[26:55] you how to make me better you're the
[26:57] doctor you tell me how to be better A
[26:59] lot of times we come to God and say well
[27:00] I got this problem this problem this
[27:02] problem and this is how you should fix
[27:03] it there's a pastor you have people do
[27:05] like and this is how we're going to fix
[27:07] it like no no no wait let's just stop
[27:09] right let's let God fix it let's let God
[27:12] fix the problem amen sometimes we
[27:14] encounter things in life and we don't
[27:15] know how to to to to get through it we
[27:18] live in a fastpaced society it's become
[27:21] faster and faster with the internet and
[27:23] technology and hey Siri do this and
[27:25] Alexa do this and we're just like and if
[27:27] it doesn't then we're just kind of move
[27:28] it on but God doesn't move like that and
[27:32] sometimes God gives you a little
[27:33] sickness in your knee and you're just
[27:35] like and pretty soon you're like I just
[27:37] want and we want a magic W God that we
[27:40] can just wave a wand over you know wave
[27:42] a wand over the problem and it goes away
[27:44] but God's not like that sometimes
[27:46] sometimes he puts a little Affliction in
[27:47] our life to draw Us close to God David
[27:50] said before I was afflicted I went
[27:52] astray is everybody with me today I'm
[27:54] one of those preachers where if it
[27:56] doesn't work through the week what good
[27:57] is it
[27:58] if we all go to church and it's all good
[28:00] on Sunday and Wednesday but what about
[28:03] when I need God on Tuesday and what
[28:06] about the hour of
[28:07] Temptation amen what about Affliction
[28:10] and it's a real world that we're living
[28:12] in we're not in a I'm getting ahead of
[28:14] myself but we're on this journey you
[28:16] know going through life and you know
[28:18] something that's always stayed with me
[28:20] brother R says in the message power of
[28:21] transformation he had gone through life
[28:23] and it's one of the few times in the
[28:25] world that we have a prophet that we're
[28:27] able to live through through his life as
[28:28] brother Chad and we have 1,200 messages
[28:31] by a prophet telling us his failures his
[28:33] down settings his Uprising the high
[28:35] mountains the low valleys and we
[28:37] actually see the life of Elijah the
[28:39] spirit of Elijah and William Brandon and
[28:40] his life portrayed out and he madees
[28:42] this statement he said your jobs will
[28:46] fail you might be a young young man
[28:49] getting your first job and like this is
[28:50] my forever job Propet says hey your jobs
[28:54] are going to
[28:55] fail he goes on to say your health will
[28:57] fail
[28:58] even your life here on Earth will fail
[29:01] but then that won't fail talking about
[29:04] Christ he is the center of all things
[29:06] then let's keep our minds on the center
[29:08] post I say let's keep our minds on Jesus
[29:10] Christ he's everything as a little song
[29:13] he said he's everything to me he's the
[29:16] counselor to us he's the Prince of Peace
[29:18] he's the Mighty God I love Isaiah there
[29:20] I love to quote the Bible I love to
[29:22] quote the scriptures can you say Amen to
[29:24] that amen it's the word of God and if
[29:26] you have the Holy Spirit something
[29:28] inside of you says say Amen now you
[29:31] might have had a bad day you might have
[29:33] fought on the way to church you might
[29:35] have kids and your you know I had three
[29:37] raised three boys and it was just real
[29:39] life you know we got to the place we
[29:40] just like get in the
[29:44] car get in the car are we going to
[29:47] church Sunday did the sun come up we're
[29:51] going to church I like what my pastor
[29:53] said what do people do when they don't
[29:54] go to church what what do they do you
[29:57] just sleep till 10: and then get up and
[30:00] go watch the G but no this is this is
[30:02] Jesus day this is Sunday this is a day
[30:05] that's dedicated to the Lord that we
[30:07] come together to honor the Lord's
[30:09] Resurrection amen honor as a one man was
[30:12] blind he couldn't see or here and he
[30:14] went to church I said why do you go to
[30:15] church he said I go to church to show
[30:17] God and the devil whose side I'm on Amen
[30:20] I say I want to show God whose side him
[30:22] on today I don't want the devil to know
[30:24] I'm on God's side today can you say Amen
[30:26] to that how many been baptized in jesus'
[30:29] name raise your hand say I've been
[30:30] baptized in Jesus name I took on the
[30:33] name of Jesus Christ can you go back to
[30:35] that place this morning and go back to
[30:37] that old cold grave when you walk down I
[30:40] remember I got baptized at the brandom
[30:41] Tabernacle the Holy Spirit moved in a
[30:43] powerful powerful way and there was many
[30:45] of the people that got baptized that
[30:47] night was but I was like they only had
[30:49] so many robes and so I got the wet cold
[30:52] robe and I remember standing in the back
[30:54] and I I don't like cold and I was
[30:56] shaking like this but I was going the
[30:58] grave because I wanted my sins buried
[31:00] amen down in that watery grave as a
[31:03] symbol I think brother Ram says that in
[31:04] the future home he said you chop off
[31:06] your sins he said repent and be baptized
[31:09] for the remission for the getting rid of
[31:11] your sins aren't you glad you got rid of
[31:14] your sins brother said you chopped them
[31:16] off oh praise be to God I'm so glad amen
[31:19] I went down in that watery grave of
[31:21] water baptism and raised in a newness of
[31:24] life to be a
[31:25] Christian blessed be the name of the
[31:27] Lord I was thinking about that as we as
[31:29] Christians go through this life we
[31:31] encounter many things maybe you think
[31:34] about the first time you maybe
[31:35] encountered Christianity or or Christ
[31:38] because many people like we we get in
[31:40] these when did you come to the message
[31:41] well the message is Christ when did you
[31:44] come to Christ that's the main thing
[31:46] Christ I've been around I'm not a
[31:48] dinosaur but I've been around a long
[31:49] time people encounter what we call the
[31:52] message and then they leave like you
[31:53] never met Christ Jesus Christ he is
[31:56] Christ the word of God remember he asked
[31:59] Peter thou are he said Thou Art the
[32:01] Christ Thou Art the anointed one the son
[32:03] of the Living God he said Flesh and
[32:05] Blood didn't revealed this to but my
[32:07] Father which is in heaven revealed it to
[32:09] you and Jesus said Upon This Rock I'm
[32:11] going to build a church on a church is
[32:14] going to be built on Revelation we need
[32:16] to be built on Revelation of the word of
[32:19] God are you built on Revelation or you
[32:22] just come to this church because the
[32:23] carpet's nice no there was no one
[32:27] baptized in the Bible but in the name of
[32:29] the Lord Jesus Christ or they had to go
[32:32] back and be re-baptized to receive the
[32:34] holy spirit is that the Bible Acts 19
[32:36] are you built on Revelation do you know
[32:39] you come to this church because of a
[32:40] revelation of the word of God Amen we as
[32:43] men especially men should know what we
[32:45] believe and know what we believe comes
[32:47] from the Bible you sisters ought to say
[32:50] Amen what my husband you young men
[32:52] that's why you pay attention in church
[32:53] because we want to be built on a rock of
[32:56] Revelation so you ask
[32:58] you know we just got one service this
[33:00] morning so I'm trying to do this a
[33:01] little concentrated brother said you
[33:03] just preach he said we'll do the two in
[33:05] one he said they like a long service all
[33:07] right we'll just let's just stay
[33:09] together amen so you start this journey
[33:11] of your life and many times the first
[33:13] thing you encounter is a Christian you
[33:16] encounter a Christian you meet somebody
[33:17] and something they have that you want
[33:19] and they they and then they begin to
[33:21] point you to the word of God maybe you
[33:23] can point you to the Bible why do you
[33:25] dress like that because the Bible says
[33:27] it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair
[33:29] is that what your Bible says if I die
[33:31] does that change the no no it's the word
[33:33] of God Amen so you encounter the word of
[33:36] God and then maybe you as you begin to
[33:38] read the word of God and and the Bible
[33:39] tells us to be baptized and so maybe you
[33:42] were baptized well first we got to
[33:43] repent we've seen a lot of people go in
[33:45] the water and go down wet centers and
[33:47] come up you know go down dry centers and
[33:49] come up wet centers we don't want to do
[33:50] that we want to repent go down and make
[33:53] a change say God I'm tired of this and
[33:55] repent and be baptized and then receive
[33:58] the holy spirit in our journey of life
[33:59] and then there's healing along the way
[34:01] and there's encouragement and there's
[34:03] deliverance and there's joy and there's
[34:05] shouting and there's Praises of God and
[34:07] it all starts somewhere in our journey
[34:10] and I was thinking of some scriptures as
[34:12] we go through this journey and in Acts
[34:14] the second in the third acts the third
[34:16] chapter I didn't know how you all did he
[34:18] brother said that you all have your
[34:20] Bibles I love the people have their
[34:22] Bibles their sword you know and you
[34:24] should you know Mark these scriptures in
[34:26] your Bibles and Mark your road map up
[34:29] this is the road
[34:30] map when I go through something in life
[34:33] I go back in the Bible and say did
[34:34] somebody else go through this they tell
[34:36] me there's a stoplight up there what do
[34:37] I do when I get the stoplight well you
[34:39] wait till it gets green and then you
[34:40] make a right or you make it and so that
[34:42] we reading the Bible and so the Bible
[34:44] tells us and we're just going to go
[34:45] through Acts 3: 19 so I want to look at
[34:48] a couple times as this journey of life
[34:50] there's going to be times of refreshing
[34:52] in your life Acts 3: 19 repent ye
[34:56] therefore and be converted
[34:58] that your sins may be blotted out when
[35:00] the times of refreshing shall come from
[35:03] the presence of God the times of
[35:06] refreshing from the presence of God Amen
[35:09] is that what your Bible says now the
[35:12] Bible wouldn't say that there's times of
[35:14] refreshing from the presence of God if
[35:16] there wasn't times that you weren't
[35:18] refreshed so the Bible is telling us
[35:20] there's going to be times of refreshing
[35:22] but that also means there's going to be
[35:24] times where you don't feel fresh where
[35:26] you don't feel like going to church and
[35:28] you feel like God's a million miles away
[35:30] but that's okay Somebody went before us
[35:33] and said that the times of refreshing
[35:35] will come but they come from the
[35:38] presence of God they don't come from
[35:40] just sitting at home and taking oh we
[35:43] need to yeah we need to go to the
[35:44] Bahamas that's all good and I understand
[35:47] that but the times of refreshing come
[35:49] from the presence of God Amen David said
[35:52] I was glad when they said let us go into
[35:54] the house of the Lord amen to go into
[35:57] the house of the Lord he said lift up
[35:59] your hands in the sanctuary oh praise
[36:01] the Lord and this journeys of life I
[36:03] thought about this as he began to study
[36:05] it he said when the times of refreshing
[36:08] shall come I'm thankful for those times
[36:10] of refreshing go back to the Book of
[36:12] Psalms we're going to just look at a
[36:14] couple of things you'll encounter along
[36:16] the way so thankful for David that went
[36:18] before us amen these things are written
[36:20] for our admonition can you say Amen to
[36:22] that as we read the word of God there
[36:24] should be something down inside of you
[36:26] that says amen that's the the holy
[36:28] spirit it's like some my son is a
[36:30] songwriter see he writes songs and then
[36:32] when maybe he's sitting there and
[36:33] somebody else is singing his song and he
[36:35] says that's good because he wrote that
[36:38] amen so you're just we're just man was
[36:40] God took up some dirt he picked up Adam
[36:42] from the dust of the Earth right so
[36:43] we're just a a product of the Earth but
[36:45] inside of us should be a seed of God
[36:48] that the Holy Spirit has quickened and
[36:50] you might have a bad day as the pot and
[36:52] you might have a lot of things with
[36:53] that's holding the seed of God but when
[36:55] the word of God is spoken some down
[36:58] inside of you says I wrote that yes sir
[37:00] amen amen you could sit there and have
[37:03] your bad day but God is an eternal
[37:05] spirit of God that dwells inside of the
[37:07] believer and he says
[37:10] amen my dad says don't try to sing a a
[37:13] great Holy Ghost filled song with your
[37:15] mouth closed because you'll blow the
[37:16] side of your head
[37:18] out that's the way it was on the day of
[37:20] Pentecost brother said they came out of
[37:22] the windows and the doors amen they said
[37:24] these people are drunk stagging around
[37:26] the holy spirit said no they just got
[37:27] that new wine they've been Intoxicated
[37:30] by the holy spirit amen sometimes we
[37:32] just need to let the Holy Spirit go amen
[37:35] and let him be God and let him amen say
[37:37] amen glory to God I wrote that I'm
[37:41] giving you a road mapap that when you
[37:43] get to this place you when you get to
[37:44] that Junction you remember back remember
[37:46] Jesus said this my wife's a Sunday
[37:48] school teacher I'm a Sunday school
[37:49] teacher we're kind of skipping out today
[37:52] you know text my brother my boy William
[37:55] today said hey uh praying for you he's
[37:58] teaching Sunday school somebody else
[37:59] following for her but David said Thy
[38:02] word have I hid in my heart that I might
[38:03] not sin against God Jesus said take no
[38:06] thought what you would say for I will
[38:08] bring to your remembrance the things
[38:10] that I have spoken unto you listen to me
[38:13] but he can't bring them to your
[38:14] remembrance until you put them in your
[38:16] heart till you put them in your mind God
[38:18] has nothing to bring to the remembrance
[38:21] remember the Bible says what is
[38:22] Ephesians chapter 6 The Sword of the
[38:24] spirit which is the word of God so the
[38:28] spirit is the great powerful eternal
[38:30] spirit of God but he has nothing to work
[38:32] with but the word of God and as my wife
[38:35] saying the song the word of God will
[38:36] defeat the Devil any place anywhere any
[38:39] time amen so as I tell people in our
[38:41] message don't let go of your Bible
[38:42] whatever you do don't let go of your
[38:45] Bible I fear sometimes we got 12200
[38:48] messages of the Prophet that reveal the
[38:50] Bible but somewhere we forgotten that
[38:52] all of it came from the Bible and
[38:55] sometimes we try to separate say that's
[38:56] the Bible and this is the message no you
[38:58] they're
[38:59] Inseparable this is a great mystery but
[39:02] every message brother Baron preached
[39:03] he'll say turn in your Bible and out of
[39:06] the Bible came this great revelation of
[39:09] the word of God oh praise be to God I'm
[39:11] going to get us all back to the Bible
[39:14] get us back in the Bible in fact after
[39:16] the seals they came to brother B brother
[39:17] B you could write Revelations 23 you
[39:20] could write brother B said no no no
[39:22] because the Bible says if you add to or
[39:24] take away your part will be taken out of
[39:26] the Book of Life we got to remember what
[39:28] we believe comes from the Bible oh I
[39:30] love my Bible I love my Bible sometimes
[39:33] when people come to dedicate their heart
[39:34] to the Lord I said bring your Bible amen
[39:37] we're not dedicating ourselves to an
[39:38] idea or even to a church or brother
[39:41] Daniel you're dedicating yourself to
[39:42] Jesus Christ and I know Christ by the
[39:45] word of God Amen here's Psalms chapter
[39:49] 34 praise the Lord you are listening so
[39:51] good and so intently amen Psalms chapter
[39:54] 34: 19
[39:57] these are powerful powerful verses of
[39:59] somebody that went before us and he says
[40:02] many are the afflictions of the
[40:04] righteous is that what your Bible says
[40:06] many it doesn't say one you'll get one
[40:10] Affliction in your life doesn't say
[40:12] occasionally you'll get an Affliction
[40:14] the Bible says many are the afflictions
[40:17] so if you go down the road say Hey you
[40:19] go up here and make it right but there's
[40:20] a bunch of potholes in the road when I
[40:22] get there and I see potholes I don't
[40:24] like a no I was told there's going to be
[40:28] potholes so as I read the Bible Somebody
[40:31] went before me said be careful many are
[40:33] the afflictions of the righteous there's
[40:35] many potholes along the road but that's
[40:38] not the end of the verse Oh praise be to
[40:41] God but the Lord can you say that the
[40:45] Lord will deliver him out of them all
[40:49] amen he'll take you around the potholes
[40:51] and the pitfalls of life amen oh praise
[40:55] God and Jesus said in another place I'll
[40:57] never leave you and I'll never forsake
[41:00] you oh we ought to take that verse and
[41:02] just tuck it right close to our heart he
[41:04] said he would never leave me he would
[41:06] never forsake me he would be a guide to
[41:10] me oh praise be to God there's such
[41:12] comfort in the word of God hey this will
[41:14] cure
[41:15] anxiety this will cure depression I'm
[41:19] not against those medicines and God
[41:20] bless those men that they're helping
[41:22] people along the way but I tell you go
[41:24] in the presence of God it'll certainly
[41:25] help too amen it'll the word of God say
[41:28] God the Creator said he would never
[41:29] leave you me he would never forsake me I
[41:32] got a brother they took him we was going
[41:34] to throw him in the Lions then because
[41:35] he was praying and the Bible says when
[41:38] Daniel heard this amen he he opened the
[41:40] windows and he prayed to God and they
[41:42] threw him in but the pillar of fire was
[41:43] there amen he had some brothers Shadrach
[41:46] Meshach and abedo and they said look
[41:48] we're going to play this music again I
[41:50] want you to stay right here me I'm way
[41:52] away from my notes right and he said
[41:53] there is a culture and this culture
[41:55] plays to a certain beat and you will
[41:58] play to this certain beat or you're not
[42:00] a part of us in fact you're going to die
[42:03] you ever have people that you you'll
[42:04] march to this beat or this music or
[42:06] you're going to die you're going to die
[42:07] spiritually like well wait a minute wait
[42:09] a minute I don't know you know it's
[42:11] really amazing they had to bow to that
[42:14] image and the and the young men said
[42:15] look we don't they said we're going to
[42:17] give you another chance they said we
[42:18] don't need another chance isn't that
[42:20] good brother Kyle we don't need another
[42:22] chance why listen to me close why did
[42:25] they why could they say before the king
[42:26] we don't need another chance because
[42:28] they hid the word of God in their heart
[42:30] the Bible says El should not make into
[42:31] the any grave and EV Shall Not Bow
[42:33] before image they didn't need another
[42:35] chance because the word wasn't going to
[42:37] change oh praise God the word of God is
[42:40] forever settled in heaven may it be
[42:42] settled in our
[42:49] heart do you think you'll ever see your
[42:52] pastor allow a woman to come out with
[42:54] the Bible and open it and say now I'm
[42:56] going to take a text that I'm going to
[42:57] preach to you
[42:59] today now you all are laughing as if
[43:02] it's humorous but there's only one
[43:04] listen to me there's only one thing that
[43:05] you have an assurance and you can laugh
[43:08] because you know your pastor is tied to
[43:10] the word of God 2 Timothy 2:12 I suffer
[43:13] not a woman to teach or Ser authority
[43:15] over a man so it's the word of God that
[43:18] is keeping us where we should be the
[43:20] things how's the Bible say by him all
[43:22] things consist our churches held
[43:24] together the the the deacons ships and
[43:27] every positioner is held together by the
[43:29] word of God so you see when they take
[43:32] the word of God out of our culture out
[43:34] of our society it how's it say in the
[43:36] Old Testament it's confusion people
[43:38] become confused and they don't even know
[43:41] which bathroom they should go into and
[43:43] these movements of our culture changing
[43:46] it'll change the whole uh it'll change
[43:48] the whole building industry and you'll
[43:49] have male female and then undecided or
[43:53] un confused I don't know may God help to
[43:57] come to the house of God and know the
[43:59] things of God Amen many are the
[44:01] afflictions we're going to encounter
[44:02] some things but the Lord will deliver us
[44:04] out of them all praise the Lord Psalms
[44:06] chapter
[44:08] 61 praise be to God I like this one
[44:11] Psalms
[44:12] 61 I don't know how to preach we'll just
[44:14] let the Holy Spirit take us where we
[44:16] need to go amen Psalm 61 David said Hear
[44:20] My Cry Oh God and attend to my prayer
[44:23] for from the end of the Earth will I cry
[44:24] unto thee this is so powerful
[44:28] when my heart is
[44:30] overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is
[44:33] higher than I is that what your Bible
[44:35] says I want you to notice sometimes we
[44:37] read over this and we say Amen but I
[44:39] want you to really stop here because
[44:40] David said when my heart is overwhelmed
[44:43] he doesn't say if my heart is
[44:46] overwhelmed he says when when I get up
[44:49] here and make that turn in all those
[44:50] potholes when I get to that spot and
[44:54] David is saying when your heart gets
[44:55] overwhelmed because it's going to happen
[44:57] if you stay on the road I can go out
[44:59] here and say I'm going to change my
[45:00] direction and go here and head down that
[45:02] way and many people do that you pull up
[45:04] to a light and you got your window down
[45:06] you got their window line their their
[45:08] GPS says make a left when possible your
[45:10] GPS says make a right when possible
[45:12] sometimes you in Christianity you get
[45:13] around people and like well they're
[45:15] saying make a left I want you to listen
[45:17] to me they might not be going where
[45:19] you're
[45:22] going they might not be going where
[45:24] you're going they may not have heard the
[45:27] voice of God for our generation but in
[45:29] the days of the voice of the seventh
[45:31] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[45:32] mystery of how to get there amen will be
[45:35] revealed and he puts us on the right
[45:38] Road amen elaser is bringing someone
[45:41] Amen to meet Isaac the bridegroom can
[45:43] you say Amen to that and I want to hear
[45:45] that voice and other people I don't
[45:46] doubt that they you know um I just we
[45:48] went to to I'm trying to slow down here
[45:51] we just came from Utah on a vacation I
[45:53] said I got to go see Joseph Smith's
[45:55] thing the Mormon church and all like he
[45:57] so we went he heard an angel met an
[46:00] angel I went and heard the story I went
[46:02] back and heard brother said he said I I
[46:03] don't dispute that this man met an Angel
[46:05] and the angel spoke to him many things
[46:07] they have a huge M movement I think 13
[46:09] million members but brother amam said
[46:11] what the angel said to him was contrary
[46:13] to the scripture and there's many people
[46:15] on that road but I heard another voice
[46:19] the voice of the seventh angel and he
[46:21] said it's got to be written in the Bible
[46:23] now they had to go write another Bible
[46:25] to support what that angel said they
[46:27] came to William Braham said you should
[46:28] write another Bible he said no I can't
[46:30] write another Bible it's the revelation
[46:32] of the already written word I say Lord
[46:36] just reveal it to me amen but somewhere
[46:38] you got to stop and slow down and read
[46:40] the word of God and not run past it we
[46:42] got to slow down a little bit and that's
[46:44] why God brings Affliction sometimes
[46:46] sometimes he brings trouble in a family
[46:48] sometimes he brings trouble in a church
[46:49] so we all slow down and we begin to pray
[46:54] we begin to pray prayer amen sometimes
[46:56] we the afflictions is what causes us to
[46:59] pray and draw close to God I have so
[47:03] many things on my heart but when my
[47:05] heart is overwhelmed lead me to the Rock
[47:08] can you say that lead me lead me you
[47:10] might be in a place this morning you say
[47:12] brother Daniel you're I know this is for
[47:14] me I'm overwhelmed I'm just completely
[47:17] overwhelmed when you get there say Lord
[47:19] lead me to the Rock lead me to the Rock
[47:22] Jesus my heart is overwhelmed lead me to
[47:25] the Rock and that rock is Christ
[47:27] 1 Corinthians chapter 10 that rock that
[47:29] they that gave water that rock is Christ
[47:33] amen praise the Lord you know talking
[47:36] about being
[47:38] overwhelmed brother Chad he said he
[47:39] likes the fish I don't like the f I
[47:42] don't have the patience to fish I like
[47:46] 20 minutes blow up the damn catch them
[47:48] all you know I just this whole thing of
[47:51] lurs and sunlight no sunlight color I I
[47:54] just it overwhelms me I'm it just
[47:58] creates anxiety
[47:59] but so this one day it was really nice
[48:02] and I was out I come by this place I
[48:04] like to fish I got my fishing pole I was
[48:06] fishing with the Rapala two treble hooks
[48:09] and I was fishing along beautiful day
[48:11] the birds the little Ripple and I was
[48:13] just fishing just enjoying myself
[48:15] sometimes I'll listen to God's Prophet I
[48:18] caught this little bass about that long
[48:20] I was catching several I caught this one
[48:22] and so just as you begin to you know you
[48:24] hold the rod you begin to pull it up and
[48:26] these little bash just as you get them
[48:27] by the mouth and it kind of kind of
[48:29] paralyze them when you hold their mouth
[48:31] a certain way and just as I got him he
[48:33] thrashed like that and it buried the
[48:36] trouble hook in my finger the trouble
[48:38] Hook is means it's three hooks on the
[48:40] and they put two trouble hooks on every
[48:42] lur so the the the front one got him and
[48:44] the back one got me and so it it buried
[48:47] it in my finger and so I I caught him I
[48:51] H held him like this and every time he
[48:52] thrashed it would just um is this okay
[48:55] if I just share some personal things
[48:57] preachers go through things too Burley
[48:59] Williams was telling about his eye and
[49:00] everything he told the
[49:02] doctor all right so i' now I got this
[49:05] fish and I got the hook in my finger and
[49:07] I'm picking him up like this but every
[49:08] time he thrashed it just like ah so I'm
[49:11] holding my pole so then I'm like okay so
[49:14] I stuck my pole under my arm and I had
[49:15] to hold the fish with this hand and so
[49:18] I'm walking like this and I'm like how
[49:21] did I get here how did I get here I got
[49:24] this pole this fish thing in my finger
[49:26] and and I'm holding the bass like this
[49:28] and I I'm like I can't do anything this
[49:30] it was a pretty day I was having a good
[49:33] time you ever been there in your life
[49:35] and you're like how did I get here how
[49:37] did we get here I was trying to tell her
[49:39] a compliment on her food and and she
[49:41] just like this whole thing is a mess and
[49:43] then it went to social media and how how
[49:45] did I get
[49:48] here we live in a rural world and if God
[49:52] doesn't help us through the real world
[49:53] what good is he he's not way out there
[49:56] somewhere the word of God is not you
[49:58] even in your mouth Lord I need you I
[50:00] need you when I'm stuck and so I like
[50:02] all right I got to unravel all of this
[50:04] that happen in just a moment so I carry
[50:06] all this to my truck and I'm trying to
[50:08] get my tailgate open and I can't get my
[50:10] tailgate open I'm like okay so somehow I
[50:13] got my rod and I bit the line and I set
[50:16] my pole down so now I just have the fish
[50:18] and my finger like this and I'm like
[50:21] okay so I open the tailgate get in there
[50:23] get my tacle box pull it out get a knife
[50:25] or plier and I get it out and you know
[50:28] they have the split ring that holds the
[50:29] treble if you're fishing the split ring
[50:31] holds to so I get the split ring cuz I
[50:33] don't want to waste the the the other
[50:35] lur and damage it so I try to get this
[50:37] split ring off and finally get the lur
[50:40] separated now I just have this treble
[50:41] hook in my finger you know and when you
[50:44] get to there you ever been things like
[50:46] in life you're like I just like well
[50:47] I'll just forget about it I maybe it'll
[50:49] go
[50:50] away maybe it'll go away but there's
[50:53] just some things in life that aren't
[50:55] going to go away that you have to deal
[50:56] with with and God sometimes gets us in
[50:59] places where we realize God we need a
[51:01] God we need somebody that's bigger than
[51:03] us maybe a sickness maybe a problem in
[51:06] your marriage maybe a a problem with
[51:08] your children amen and then we're
[51:10] praying and maybe a problem in the
[51:12] church and you're praying I'm like Lord
[51:13] what do what do I I've got this hook and
[51:15] you know you think about your options
[51:16] I'll just cut the hook off and just
[51:18] leave a because it's buried all the way
[51:20] down to the curve I'll just leave that
[51:21] in there and I'll just leave it well you
[51:23] can it's you got to get that out like
[51:25] well maybe I'll go the hospital and
[51:27] they'll charge me $3 or $4,000 to get
[51:30] this out like well what are they going
[51:31] to do you know they're going to so I got
[51:33] me some pliers I'm trying to pull it and
[51:35] pull it and there was a barb you know
[51:37] what barbs are if you fish trout I think
[51:39] they make you take the Barb off it so it
[51:42] has a Barb and I'm trying to pull the
[51:43] Barb and it won't because it's hooked
[51:44] down in my finger and I'm pulling and
[51:47] like this isn't going to work you know
[51:49] so I realized you know what I'm going to
[51:51] have to take this thing through I can't
[51:53] pull it out so I got to pull it all the
[51:55] way through my fer and brother said he
[51:59] said that's right so I'm like if I go to
[52:01] the hospital they're just going to do
[52:02] this too and so I try to pull it through
[52:03] and it the the the fatty part of your
[52:05] flesh it wouldn't go through so I had to
[52:07] get another knife you know it's just
[52:09] like life some things you just got to go
[52:11] through you just got to go through it I
[52:14] mean all parents like I wish my kids
[52:16] would hit 10 and then they'd go right to
[52:18] 20 and they just like just jump right
[52:20] over there but no you're going to have
[52:22] to go through that they going to have to
[52:25] go through those years where they're
[52:26] trying to figure out and you know what
[52:28] you went through them I saw brother Les
[52:31] coli and sister Kelly and you know
[52:33] growing up and we all you know I was
[52:35] young and 15 years old when I first came
[52:37] to this area and 14 years old and
[52:39] brother Jeff and man such a pointed me
[52:41] to the message of the hour I'm so
[52:43] thankful for his influence to point me
[52:44] to the message of the hour we'd have
[52:47] altar calls at the camps and brother
[52:48] Jeff would come up right behind him said
[52:50] now everyone of you had an experience
[52:51] with God but you need to get into this
[52:53] message and feed on Christ the word of
[52:55] God to keep your experience of life I'm
[52:57] so thankful for his influence in my life
[52:59] and direct me to the message and so I
[53:01] here I am stuck with this thing in my
[53:03] finger and I realize I got to go through
[53:04] this so I got a knife and cut it on the
[53:07] other end and pushed it all the way
[53:08] through and got a pair of pliers and
[53:09] pulled it through and then I was through
[53:11] it I was through it and you know you
[53:13] know five minutes later I just rub it a
[53:15] little bit boom I'll fishing again it's
[53:18] and I was through it and that's the same
[53:20] with life maybe it's a sickness or a
[53:22] trouble that you go through but amen
[53:23] this this came to pass it says in the
[53:25] Bible someone this came to pass it
[53:27] didn't come to stay it came to pass can
[53:31] you say Amen to that you'll get through
[53:33] those teenage years you'll get through
[53:34] that sickness God's going to bring us
[53:37] through he's not going to forsake us so
[53:40] thankful for that in our lives in this
[53:42] journey of life I was thinking of this 2
[53:44] Timothy 3:12 says all that live Godly in
[53:48] Christ Jesus shall suffer
[53:52] persecution all that live Godly will
[53:55] suffer persecution so if you're not
[53:57] suffering persecution the Bible says all
[53:59] that live Godly will suffer persecution
[54:02] amen there's another place Jesus said
[54:04] Beware when all men speak well of you
[54:06] now this is the other side of the Gospel
[54:08] okay I I we we we I try to earn a living
[54:11] for a family we have a little company
[54:13] we're in sales and I understand the
[54:14] whole positive uh you know thinking and
[54:17] corporate seminars and motivational
[54:20] speeches and and things like that and
[54:22] then then people try to bring that right
[54:23] into the church and get religious jargon
[54:25] and and positive mental attitude I
[54:28] understand all of that that's the world
[54:29] I live in but we got to realize you know
[54:32] they try to bring it in the church I'm
[54:33] too blessed to be depressed I'm too
[54:36] anointed to be
[54:37] disappointed and as my wife said the
[54:39] other day I'm too I'm too inspired to be
[54:43] tired and that's all good but sometimes
[54:45] you go through an Affliction in your
[54:47] body or something in your mind and God
[54:49] is wanting to deal with you like job or
[54:51] maybe there's a conversation in heaven
[54:53] between God and Satan it said have you
[54:55] considered my servant job and Satan says
[54:59] yeah yeah but um you know he's just
[55:01] serving you for the Loaves and the
[55:03] fishes and all and so in one day he
[55:04] loses all of his family all of his
[55:07] possessions have you ever prayed God
[55:09] don't let me ever go through what job
[55:11] would go through until I have the
[55:12] character that job had and one day he
[55:14] loses
[55:16] everything Satan comes back to God and
[55:18] says you know yeah yeah you got a hedge
[55:20] around him oh I love that verse God has
[55:23] a hedge around a Believer amen the Bible
[55:26] says the angels are encamped around
[55:28] about those that fear Him Do you believe
[55:30] it I believe it because it's the word of
[55:32] God and I've learned that I believe the
[55:34] word of God when I don't feel like it I
[55:37] take the word of God and when he says
[55:38] the angels of God are encamped around
[55:40] about those that fear Him I believe it
[55:43] brother vham said they never leave
[55:45] they're always there he said they know
[55:48] your thoughts listen to me I heard the
[55:50] ver voice of God's Prophet it changed my
[55:52] life it changed my thinking I can't
[55:55] think like that because all the Angels
[55:57] know what I'm thinking hey we're having
[55:59] a good day aren't we to the angels yes
[56:02] we are Daniel be
[56:05] encouraged oh praise God we get down in
[56:07] the devils and start talking negative
[56:09] brother R said you're talking the
[56:11] devil's language when you do that I
[56:13] don't know a foreign language I'm still
[56:15] trying to conquer English but some
[56:16] people know German or French or whatever
[56:19] you know Opa I think is Romanian is
[56:21] water I think the OPA is is water and
[56:23] Romanian and and so and so these these
[56:26] words but now the prophet talks about
[56:27] the devil's language you start talking
[56:29] negative I guess I'll never make it a
[56:32] Son of God a daughter of God never make
[56:34] it wake up who are you if we're Sons and
[56:37] Daughters of God Jesus told his
[56:39] disciples he said I send you out a Among
[56:42] Wolves Heen see to be harmless as a dove
[56:44] but wise as a serpent and he said
[56:46] nothing shall by any means ever hurt
[56:49] you oh praise be to God we must realize
[56:52] who's in the ship we need need to go
[56:55] wake Jesus
[56:56] I hope this is encouraging us today man
[56:59] who called you to this why are you we
[57:01] need to go back to basics why are you in
[57:02] this church why why why why would just
[57:07] no no no why are you here God put a
[57:10] desire inside of
[57:11] you man as one man said I'm not going to
[57:14] church the holy spirit said I'm going he
[57:15] said okay just a minute let me get my
[57:17] coat and hat and I'll go with
[57:19] you and when he the Holy Spirit has come
[57:21] he will lead you and guide you into all
[57:23] truth we need to get away from our flesh
[57:25] and start yielding to the Holy Spirit
[57:27] say God lead me lead me to the house of
[57:29] God lead me to the word of God he'll
[57:32] never lead you away from the Bible he'll
[57:34] never lead you away from the word of God
[57:36] oh I love God he has characteristics God
[57:38] Is Knowing by his characteristics so
[57:41] many different things I was thinking
[57:43] about that it's just not religious
[57:45] jargon amen but this is how how can I
[57:47] say it um we we are lumps of clay in the
[57:50] hand of the Potter I was reading that no
[57:53] doubt your pro Pastor has going through
[57:55] it Jeremiah chapter 18 the word of the
[57:57] Lord came to Jeremiah saying arise go
[57:59] down to The Potter's House and there I
[58:01] will cause thee to hear my words he said
[58:03] I went down to The Potter's House and
[58:05] behold he wrought a work on the wheels
[58:08] and the vessel that he made of clay was
[58:10] marred in the hand of the Potter so he
[58:12] made it again another vessel as seemed
[58:14] good to the Potter to make it I don't
[58:16] know if you've ever studied the Eastern
[58:18] style how they make the vessels and they
[58:20] have a little wheel and it spins like
[58:22] this and so as it begins to spin the
[58:25] master the Potter just touches it and it
[58:28] begins to shakee are you with me the
[58:31] master touches the lump of clay and it
[58:33] begins to shape it maybe as it spins and
[58:35] they touch it and then it it comes up
[58:37] and he pushes it and spinning and it
[58:39] grows taller and taller and then the
[58:41] Bible says that the lump fell off the
[58:43] potter's wheel you ever feel like you
[58:46] fell off the potter's wheel you just
[58:48] feel like ah and the Potter doesn't
[58:51] leave it there the pot the Bible says
[58:52] the Potter picked it up again and put it
[58:54] back on the Wheel you know what we need
[58:57] you
[58:58] know all this is written for our
[59:00] admonition when you fall off the
[59:02] potter's wheel don't lay there say Lord
[59:04] put me back on the potter's wheel put me
[59:07] back now you can get back on the
[59:08] potter's wheel but you have to listen to
[59:10] me you have to have the Potter to touch
[59:13] you to touch you that's right say Lord
[59:17] will you touch me this morning Lord feel
[59:20] like I've fallen off and my my testimon
[59:23] is mared my life is mared but that's not
[59:26] the end Lord I'm coming to your house
[59:28] put me back on The Potter's will and
[59:30] touch me Lord Jesus because every time
[59:32] God touches a lump of clay it shapes it
[59:35] and molds it to the image that is in the
[59:37] Master's The Potter's
[59:39] mind oh don't you love the Lord don't
[59:42] you feel like when you just talk about
[59:44] the Holy Spirit and now he just comes
[59:46] and he's just real close and how Paul
[59:48] said the the love of God constrains me
[59:51] man when I start to do it's not the the
[59:54] the ideology brother say said he had
[59:56] this idea too the Trinity he said the
[59:58] old man with the stick every time I do
[59:59] wrong the man old man with the stick
[1:00:00] like whack me and then Jesus loved me
[1:00:03] and he was a different I'm going to
[1:00:04] preach the Trinity Doctrine then there
[1:00:05] was another one the Trinity and Jesus
[1:00:07] loved me and then there was a little
[1:00:08] holy spirit that floated around to try
[1:00:10] to help
[1:00:12] me I'm going to I'm going to preach the
[1:00:14] Trinity okay so God the Father come up
[1:00:17] with this idea for an earth and then
[1:00:19] Adam and Eve messed it all up and he
[1:00:21] looked at his son and said Son go fix
[1:00:23] that go go give your life for this mess
[1:00:25] that created and holy spirit you go down
[1:00:27] there with him and and help comfort him
[1:00:30] that's the trinitarian idea but that's
[1:00:33] not what the Bible says the Bible says
[1:00:35] great is the mystery of godliness God
[1:00:38] was manifested in the flesh God said
[1:00:40] I'll go down and fix it I'll go down and
[1:00:43] fix it he created a body and came down
[1:00:46] and lived inside of that body that which
[1:00:48] is conceived in you is of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:51] is this Matthew The Book of Matthew
[1:00:52] there and now God came down and created
[1:00:55] a body and wanted to know what it was
[1:00:57] like to be angry he wanted to know what
[1:00:59] it was like to be tempted he was tempted
[1:01:01] in all manner like as you are yet
[1:01:02] without sin I said was somebody here the
[1:01:04] other day and they're like well you
[1:01:05] don't know what I'm going through and
[1:01:06] Jesus and Living Single like he's not
[1:01:08] asking you to do anything he didn't do
[1:01:11] he's not asking you to do anything he
[1:01:13] didn't do when he came right down to the
[1:01:16] end and and he said if thou be tell us
[1:01:19] who hit you and they smoted him and he
[1:01:20] the Bible says he opened not his mouth
[1:01:23] listen to me really close why didn't he
[1:01:25] open his mouth and tell him your name is
[1:01:27] this and this and last week you
[1:01:28] committed adultery unless you repent of
[1:01:30] it you're going to hell why didn't he do
[1:01:32] that because there was a verse in the
[1:01:34] Bible over in Isaiah chapter 53 his
[1:01:37] Bible says and he opened not his mouth
[1:01:39] and he was so bound and constricted by
[1:01:43] the word of God it controlled his mouth
[1:01:46] oh brothers and sisters may God help us
[1:01:49] today we talk about the token we talk
[1:01:51] about the Holy Spirit I say Lord will
[1:01:53] you fill me today till I have that kind
[1:01:56] of character Lord it might we we think
[1:01:59] it's the opposite I get anointed and I
[1:02:01] open my mouth but now Jesus is Anointed
[1:02:03] and he keeps his mouth
[1:02:06] closed sometimes God's ways are not our
[1:02:09] ways some way we just need to say I
[1:02:12] don't know what to say so I'm not going
[1:02:13] to say anything there's great there's
[1:02:16] great wisdom in that there's great power
[1:02:19] in that a lot sometimes you get around
[1:02:20] people they get nervous and they just
[1:02:21] got to say something say something
[1:02:23] something say but there's great wisdom
[1:02:24] how's the Bible how's of Proverbs say
[1:02:26] it's better to remain silent and thought
[1:02:28] a fool than to open your mouth and
[1:02:31] remove all
[1:02:32] doubt so sometimes I tell people if
[1:02:34] you're just quiet people p perceive you
[1:02:37] as intelligent as just really analyzing
[1:02:39] and you understand and you're just
[1:02:41] trying to you know so may God help us to
[1:02:43] come to that place that God is
[1:02:45] controlling us controlling us Jesus knew
[1:02:48] when to make a whip and drive them out
[1:02:49] of the temple and he knew when to take a
[1:02:51] little baby up and hold him in his in
[1:02:53] his hand and he blessed the little
[1:02:55] children may God help us and give us
[1:02:57] wisdom but we're in the right place what
[1:03:00] is it uh James first chapter If any man
[1:03:02] lack wisdom let him ask God Lord help me
[1:03:05] I don't know how to do this I don't know
[1:03:07] how to raise children great wisdom I had
[1:03:10] the very honor and privilege of being
[1:03:12] raised in a Christian home and one day
[1:03:13] my dad sat me down as I think I was a
[1:03:16] teenager H he sat me down and said Son
[1:03:19] I've I've never done this before and I
[1:03:22] don't have a manual I'm trying to figure
[1:03:25] this out just like you're trying to
[1:03:26] figure this out let's figure it out
[1:03:28] together and when we don't figure it out
[1:03:30] let's go to God and say God help us we
[1:03:32] don't understand what this teenager is
[1:03:34] going through and Dad Mom you live some
[1:03:36] brother you got to think 18-year-old
[1:03:38] thoughts you got to think of their fears
[1:03:40] and their anxieties and what they're
[1:03:42] going through and then when we get later
[1:03:44] in life and we start going through
[1:03:45] things are do you understand I'm not
[1:03:47] going to preach that listen to the
[1:03:48] message indictment the first little bit
[1:03:50] brother R said you go through a change
[1:03:51] every seven years he said you got to
[1:03:53] bear with one another when you go
[1:03:55] through those years
[1:03:56] uh it's a whole another sermon but may
[1:03:58] God help us Amen brother random says
[1:04:01] this he's talking about Mary and Martha
[1:04:04] and Lazarus when Jesus went away from
[1:04:06] them when the sickness came to Lazarus
[1:04:08] he says this and when Jesus goes away
[1:04:10] from your home trouble will come in just
[1:04:13] remember when Jesus leaves your home
[1:04:16] look out for trouble that's right that's
[1:04:18] right this is somebody that's went down
[1:04:20] the road before us the other day I was
[1:04:22] going to church and one of the deacons
[1:04:23] text me said hey be careful and I65 it's
[1:04:27] all backed up you might try a different
[1:04:28] route so now here's a prophet he's
[1:04:30] telling us he's been down this road we
[1:04:33] see it in Lazarus now the prophet is
[1:04:35] saying when God leaves your house
[1:04:36] trouble happens this is Christ the word
[1:04:39] when the word of God leaves your house
[1:04:41] trouble happens I'm not going to leave
[1:04:43] the word of God he said trouble happens
[1:04:46] just remember that he said you better
[1:04:48] treat him
[1:04:50] right pray love him and keep him there
[1:04:54] cuz he's the best companion and friend
[1:04:56] you ever have or ever will so keep him
[1:05:00] there make him welcome live the kind of
[1:05:02] life that he would like to be associated
[1:05:05] with you this is great wisdom isn't it
[1:05:09] don't let him leave your house say you
[1:05:11] know have you been there before in your
[1:05:12] life maybe you've been away from the
[1:05:13] Lord you're like I know what it was
[1:05:14] before I had the Lord and now we've
[1:05:16] invited the Lord Jesus to come into our
[1:05:18] house and we're you know if something's
[1:05:20] got to go it's not going to be the Lord
[1:05:22] Jesus it's not going to be the presence
[1:05:24] of the Lord whatever that is it's to go
[1:05:26] remember brother bam said in the token
[1:05:27] message he said he said apply the token
[1:05:30] and kick the shorts and the and the
[1:05:32] television and the the cards and all
[1:05:34] those things out and you know what most
[1:05:35] people forget that because the next
[1:05:37] little party says because the token
[1:05:39] won't stand for it the Holy Spirit won't
[1:05:42] stand for those kind of evil things and
[1:05:45] the Holy Spirit is like hey it's me or
[1:05:46] them me or that and say hey all right
[1:05:48] that it's got to go do you believe that
[1:05:50] lord it's got to go cuz I want you it
[1:05:53] happened the other day I was watching a
[1:05:54] little something I was uh I don't
[1:05:56] remember it was YouTube or something I
[1:05:57] was watching something and and and a
[1:05:59] person cussed on the thing and I felt

[1:06:06] of that we'll move the other stuff are

[1:06:09] Lord you just stay here because we have
[1:06:11] to have you the family that prays
[1:06:13] together stays together amen and when
[1:06:15] Christ leave Trouble Comes brother Ram
[1:06:18] says this in the message things that are
[1:06:20] to be he said you were all pre-planned
[1:06:22] by God nothing happens by chance with

[1:09:21] was coming to church we getting
[1:09:22] Starbucks and Crispy Cream Donuts and it
[1:09:24] was was all going to be no isn't feel
[1:09:26] good we're coming to be purged for
[1:09:27] anything that's not like Christ that's
[1:09:30] our desire when we go out Lord I want to
[1:09:31] be more like you I was thinking about
[1:09:34] this man he made a a sculptor he he had
[1:09:37] this image of of of Christ and he had
[1:09:39] this image and he made this of of Christ
[1:09:41] and it was just a big rock and he made
[1:09:43] this it was a beautiful reflection the
[1:09:46] the face of Jesus Christ and his hair
[1:09:48] and his nose and his ears and it was
[1:09:49] beautiful and people were admiring it
[1:09:51] said how how did you do that how did you
[1:09:54] do that he said it was really easy I had
[1:09:56] this big rock and he said I could see
[1:09:59] Christ in that rock and all I did was
[1:10:01] cut away everything that wasn't
[1:10:04] Christ it wasn't like he had to go
[1:10:06] create Christ he just cut away
[1:10:08] everything that wasn't Christ if you're
[1:10:10] a son and daughter of God God has in you
[1:10:12] I'm going to preach God's power of
[1:10:13] transformation he said inside of you is
[1:10:16] a seed and in that seed is the
[1:10:18] potentials to grow up and be what God
[1:10:20] wanted it to we just got to get
[1:10:21] everything that's not like Christ away
[1:10:23] from us I mean I think you just listen
[1:10:25] to it Masterpiece he said he the
[1:10:27] composer he pulled it up and and watered
[1:10:29] away many pieces of paper and he threw
[1:10:31] them away he said but out of that came a
[1:10:34] masterpiece of songs that were written
[1:10:36] you listened to the message right I
[1:10:38] think you were on part three
[1:10:39] masterpieces and God is as a masterpiece
[1:10:42] he had it in his mind before the
[1:10:44] foundation of the
[1:10:46] world you
[1:10:48] know is this
[1:10:50] okay here's the Here's the the the
[1:10:52] denominational idea of Salvation Jesus
[1:10:55] Christ comes down dies on the cross goes
[1:10:57] up to heaven 2,000 years people just
[1:10:59] hear about Christ and feel sorry for the
[1:11:00] man that hung on the cross and at the
[1:11:02] end he comes back and whoever stand and
[1:11:03] believe the story is is saved but that's
[1:11:07] not the Bible the Bible says the son of
[1:11:10] man is come to seek and to save that
[1:11:13] which was lost and you might not have
[1:11:16] been raised in a Christian home you
[1:11:17] might have your dad might have been an
[1:11:19] alcoholic oh brother Daniel don't bring
[1:11:20] it down home well we're talking about
[1:11:22] brother brandom's family right his daddy
[1:11:23] said most of our family died with their
[1:11:25] on they were just Fighters and killers
[1:11:26] and all that what made the difference it
[1:11:28] was the new birth in the brandom family
[1:11:31] and without the new birth in whatever
[1:11:33] family you go back to what your old old
[1:11:36] man was so there is none righteous know
[1:11:39] not one we've all got a nature of sin
[1:11:42] but the son of man came to seek and to
[1:11:44] save that which was lost I'm going to
[1:11:46] preach the communion ready he said I was
[1:11:47] sitting on a log with my dog he said the
[1:11:49] snow he said a few months ago I was
[1:11:51] sitting here built a fire and there was
[1:11:53] flowers now there's snow and then the
[1:11:54] spring the the flower will come back he
[1:11:56] said what what was that he said I
[1:11:57] realized I wasn't the son of Charles and
[1:12:00] Ella brandom I was the son of God I was
[1:12:04] a Son of God I tell you what this will
[1:12:06] cure the old pity devil like well you
[1:12:07] don't understand my family and I was
[1:12:09] back there I I understand I understand
[1:12:11] all that but maybe you're not the son of
[1:12:13] those people maybe you're a son and
[1:12:15] daughter of almighty God and say Lord
[1:12:18] will you just cut away everything that's
[1:12:20] not like you just cut away everything
[1:12:23] that's not like you we to the great
[1:12:25] physician say Lord I here here I am
[1:12:29] that's right I'm going to preach my
[1:12:31] testimony all right I was a I was not a
[1:12:33] good person I was raised in a Christian
[1:12:35] home I was raised in the brandom
[1:12:36] Tabernacle went to Sunday school and the
[1:12:38] Sunday school brother R had the meetings
[1:12:40] with the questions and answers has them
[1:12:41] all back in there and talking to the
[1:12:43] brothers he's in my Sunday school room
[1:12:44] with brother Jackson and brother Neville
[1:12:47] and brother Collins and they're
[1:12:48] recording the message I think uh Church
[1:12:50] order in my Sunday school room I came
[1:12:51] through that went to the other Sunday
[1:12:53] school room and but I got a got and got
[1:12:54] a drifted away from the Lord and just
[1:12:57] little things come in and and so I

[1:13:01] sacrifices sent me to a Christian School
[1:13:04] and one day I was in the school and and
[1:13:05] some things happened and I said
[1:13:07] something and the the my art teacher
[1:13:09] looked at me she said Daniel you have
[1:13:12] the filthiest mouth in this
[1:13:14] school like oh God oh God what a mess
[1:13:20] I've made of my life my testimony of
[1:13:23] everything I've just made made a mess
[1:13:26] you know it's like Moses he knew he was
[1:13:28] the deliverer he was the seat of God and
[1:13:30] you're going to be the deliver and he
[1:13:31] went out and all he had was a stinking
[1:13:32] testimony two dead men it was a stinking
[1:13:35] testimony so somewhere he went away and
[1:13:38] sometimes people do that they just like
[1:13:39] I'm out of here I'm going away he went
[1:13:41] married somebody had a baby started a
[1:13:43] new career but God came looking for him
[1:13:47] he came looking for him and there was
[1:13:48] something Supernatural that happened as
[1:13:51] brother Ram said what Abraham what Moses
[1:13:54] lacked was in the burning bush amen what
[1:13:57] I lacked was in Christ one day they had
[1:14:01] the youth camp and I was a 14-year-old
[1:14:03] boy I was sitting about where a brother
[1:14:04] is in the blue shirt I was sitting there
[1:14:07] brother Hilton brand he didn't even give
[1:14:08] an altar call at the end of they just
[1:14:10] got up and they would sing some songs at
[1:14:11] the end but God was dealing with my
[1:14:13] heart God he will he will find you he
[1:14:17] will find you I don't know why I'm
[1:14:20] saying this today am man you remember
[1:14:22] Peter after he denied Christ and Christ
[1:14:25] he rose and now he's not there they
[1:14:27] couldn't see him and Peter said I go
[1:14:29] fishing I'm just going back to what I
[1:14:31] used to do how many people do that
[1:14:33] something happens they fall off the
[1:14:34] powder's will I say I I'm go I go
[1:14:37] fishing and he started influencing
[1:14:38] others remember the other disciple says
[1:14:40] we go with you we go back to our old
[1:14:42] life too well they just needed Christ
[1:14:46] but Christ came and he found them
[1:14:47] wherever they were Christ came and found
[1:14:50] them they're fishing and they said oh
[1:14:52] it's Christ and then he came and did the
[1:14:54] supernatural that's what we need is the
[1:14:56] supernatural God to somewhere get our
[1:15:00] attention brother Chad giving me his
[1:15:02] testimony he didn't have the privilege
[1:15:04] that I had and raised and all the things
[1:15:06] and right and you know and and so here
[1:15:09] I'm sitting there but God's dealing with
[1:15:10] my heart and I got up and I walked to an
[1:15:12] altar and I knelt down and said Lord
[1:15:14] this is all I got it's a mess but it's
[1:15:17] all I got and somewhere God came and he
[1:15:20] touched my heart he changed my heart and
[1:15:23] every individual needs that time with
[1:15:26] god brother said I doubt a DED dyed
[1:15:28] confession I'm talking about it many
[1:15:30] years later and it brings tears to my
[1:15:31] eyes because something happened I can't
[1:15:34] explain it I don't know all about it
[1:15:36] I've had ministers meetings and the
[1:15:38] debates and all that I can't explain it
[1:15:41] all I know is it's real amen it's real
[1:15:44] it's not a myth it's not a theory it's
[1:15:45] something you experience Jesus Christ
[1:15:48] and he comes to you wherever you are now
[1:15:51] he loves you too much to leave you that
[1:15:53] way you know the Bible says he shall
[1:15:55] save men from their sins that's why we
[1:15:57] see a lot of this charismatic them they
[1:15:59] come to Christ and they go on with the
[1:16:01] same dress the same music and but that's
[1:16:03] not what the Bible says the Bible says
[1:16:05] and he shall save his people from their
[1:16:08] sins they that are in Christ are a new
[1:16:10] creature old things have passed away I
[1:16:13] don't doubt you might dance because
[1:16:15] David danced before the Lord and maram
[1:16:17] danced but it won't be the way that the
[1:16:19] old dance in the world with the music
[1:16:21] and all that stuff of the world are you
[1:16:22] with me today I won't down I I don't
[1:16:25] doubt that you'll shout but it'll be
[1:16:27] about the things of God and not about
[1:16:28] the things of the world I don't doubt
[1:16:30] you'll drink but you won't stop drinking
[1:16:32] you just drink the right kind of stuff
[1:16:34] the Bible says be not drunk with wine
[1:16:36] but be filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:16:38] that's just a perversion of what the
[1:16:40] Holy Ghost ought to do in our life we
[1:16:42] become overwhelmed we become filled with
[1:16:44] the Holy Ghost and we love the Lord with
[1:16:46] all of our heart with all of our soul
[1:16:48] with all of our might it's a reality in
[1:16:51] Jesus Christ then I went back and told
[1:16:53] the girl said hey we can't do this
[1:16:55] relationship anymore because I met Jesus
[1:16:57] Christ and I can't listen to that music
[1:17:00] and I went from not caring about the
[1:17:02] things of God to being on the front row
[1:17:03] of the church because something happened
[1:17:05] in my life there will be a change that
[1:17:07] will happen to you how many know what
[1:17:09] I'm talking about things that are to be
[1:17:12] amen stay with me we keep getting off I
[1:17:13] don't know whe that's for somebody today
[1:17:15] none of that's in my notes so God is
[1:17:16] going down he he's a great physician he
[1:17:18] goes down every Pew to touch every one
[1:17:21] of us all right I might preach loud I
[1:17:23] might even misquote a scripture and you
[1:17:25] know but but if we might have a Critic
[1:17:26] Among Us you know I found brother Chad
[1:17:28] you can preach a perfect sermon have all
[1:17:30] the scriptures illustrations the quotes
[1:17:31] all in order and the critic gets nothing
[1:17:34] so I always try to do a little something
[1:17:36] a little mistake in there so when the
[1:17:38] critic goes out like yep you misquoted
[1:17:39] that verse you were a little loud
[1:17:42] tonight deacons know what I'm talking
[1:17:44] about they go man it was cold in church
[1:17:45] I'm glad you got something out of the
[1:17:48] service we want everybody to go away
[1:17:50] with something
[1:17:51] today it's good to laugh a little bit
[1:17:54] Jesus said go tell Herod that fox up
[1:17:56] there you know and you know the Bible
[1:17:57] says that that that uh that laughter is
[1:18:00] good it's like a medicine am me it does
[1:18:03] good brother maram told Rebecca that he
[1:18:05] told her whenever they'd lose their
[1:18:06] temper he'd make them laugh at
[1:18:07] themselves he'd make them laugh they
[1:18:08] just it's ridiculous but you know he'
[1:18:10] just make them laugh laughter is good
[1:18:11] it's like a medicine it'll heal
[1:18:13] you praise the Lord things that ought to
[1:18:16] be is this okay maybe you're journeying
[1:18:18] through life here's a couple things let
[1:18:19] me throw this out there Malachi 4:5 the
[1:18:22] Bible says that behold I send you El
[1:18:24] elah the prophet before the great and
[1:18:26] Dreadful day of the Lord so the Bible
[1:18:28] says before the great and Dreadful day
[1:18:29] of the Lord he's going to send Elijah
[1:18:30] the prophet and he'll turn their hearts
[1:18:32] back to the Faith of Our Fathers in the
[1:18:35] seals my wife and I are going through
[1:18:36] the seals it's almost invariably brother
[1:18:38] B says he's turned the the faith their
[1:18:40] faith back to the their hearts back to
[1:18:43] the faith of our original fathers it's
[1:18:45] the faith the word of God and another
[1:18:47] thing I want you to understand he said
[1:18:48] he didn't wasn't going to turn our heads
[1:18:50] back he's going to turn our hearts back
[1:18:53] good heartfelt religion it's more than
[1:18:55] something with your head you know all
[1:18:57] the doctrines but now it becomes a
[1:18:58] revelation to you brother B didn't bring
[1:19:01] a bunch of head knowledge he brought a
[1:19:03] revelation you take every one of those
[1:19:05] take the message he that is in you
[1:19:08] brother brandom comes and he tells he
[1:19:09] gives the five identifications of the
[1:19:11] third pool and the storm turning back
[1:19:13] and Hatty right I mean and then and and
[1:19:16] all these things I mean these people the
[1:19:17] squirrels being created his wife with
[1:19:19] the tumor all of those things I want you
[1:19:21] to understand this was not William
[1:19:22] brandom doing it it was God telling him
[1:19:25] to do it so we need to get this out of
[1:19:27] our head we're going to become this
[1:19:28] great no brother brandom's he tells all
[1:19:30] the people when the storm comes run out
[1:19:31] of the storm because you're going to die
[1:19:32] and he does the same thing he's running
[1:19:34] out of the storm and God stops him says
[1:19:35] hey go back into the storm he said I
[1:19:38] knew it was sure death and he started
[1:19:40] going back into the storm and then God
[1:19:42] spoke to him and said now tell that
[1:19:43] storm to go back where it came from he's
[1:19:46] hunting squirrels people think brother
[1:19:48] went out like hey I'm going to create
[1:19:49] some squirrels no he's hunting the angel
[1:19:51] of the Lord comes says what do you have
[1:19:52] need of he said he was thinking of that
[1:19:54] scripture what's other things you desire
[1:19:55] and speak from your heart he said what
[1:19:57] do you desire brother Ram said I don't
[1:19:59] need anything he said well what are you
[1:20:00] doing he said I'm hunting he said well
[1:20:02] don't you need squirrels well you should
[1:20:04] ask and he tells him and he says well
[1:20:06] just say there and and God used William
[1:20:08] randam to create a squirrel and God is
[1:20:09] in his people too and whatsoever things
[1:20:11] you desire amen whatsoever things you
[1:20:13] have need of when you when you pray
[1:20:15] believe it and you shall have what you
[1:20:16] ask for even today maybe you desire
[1:20:19] something Jesus said you have not
[1:20:21] because you ask not somewhere we need to
[1:20:23] ask Lord I have need of this Lord will
[1:20:26] you change this situation I know the
[1:20:28] doctor told you you're going to have it
[1:20:29] the rest of your life but what about God
[1:20:32] what about the supernatural what about
[1:20:34] all things are possible what about they
[1:20:36] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:20:38] shall
[1:20:39] recover what about they shall anoint
[1:20:42] with oil and pray the prayer of faith
[1:20:44] and the Lord shall raise them up is that
[1:20:46] the word of God and the Lord shall raise
[1:20:48] them up and I like this part too brother
[1:20:49] Chad and the Bible says if they have
[1:20:51] committed sins it will be forgiven them
[1:20:55] oh the word of God is so powerful as I
[1:20:57] Journey this life I've learned not to
[1:20:59] worry about what's around me but just
[1:21:01] keep following the road amen keep
[1:21:03] following the road map of God's word and
[1:21:05] don't worry about whatever I know we got
[1:21:07] those people what are they um rubber
[1:21:09] neckers like something somebody's tire
[1:21:11] and they like and you get this backup
[1:21:13] why people are rubber necking a guy has
[1:21:15] a flat tire we got too many
[1:21:18] rubberneckers we just need to take the
[1:21:19] word of God and just believe the word of
[1:21:21] God and and follow the word of
[1:21:23] God here here some Year back some man
[1:21:26] living in adultery and they had him up
[1:21:28] and was preaching and like man has
[1:21:29] everybody forgot their Bibles that
[1:21:31] there's qualifications to be in a
[1:21:33] minister it be the husband of one wife
[1:21:35] has our message people actually just
[1:21:37] laid their Bible down and we've created
[1:21:39] a movement brother said that was AR
[1:21:41] rising in the sun he said I'm afraid a
[1:21:43] pat Prophet is afraid he said I'm afraid
[1:21:45] we're getting people to a theory we're
[1:21:48] getting people to a church but we're not
[1:21:50] getting them to Jesus Christ I say Lord
[1:21:54] I want to get to Jesus Christ I want to
[1:21:56] know him in the power of his
[1:21:58] resurrection is that your desire Lord I
[1:22:00] want to know you in the power of your
[1:22:03] Resurrection but that's not all that
[1:22:06] verse and in The Fellowship of his
[1:22:09] sufferings oh we all like the power but
[1:22:12] what about the sufferings and now you're
[1:22:15] suffering and groaning through things
[1:22:17] that the prophet had to go through I I
[1:22:19] know he had a Ministry Angel of the Lord
[1:22:21] come no man will stand before you all
[1:22:22] the days of your life oh some of us if
[1:22:24] we had that invest in us we'd just walk
[1:22:26] around with the big head and now the
[1:22:29] Lord takes him through trials allow his
[1:22:31] baby to be taken his wife to be taken
[1:22:34] because he disobeyed and wouldn't go to
[1:22:36] the Pentecostal people went to Africa
[1:22:38] the ministers they got him there they
[1:22:40] had him trapped he gives in Africa and
[1:22:42] he said we're going to go to the city he
[1:22:43] said the angel of the Lord told me to go
[1:22:44] to this city he said well you can't go
[1:22:46] you don't have a car you don't have
[1:22:48] anything so he they start going to the
[1:22:50] other city and he gets him out I don't
[1:22:51] know if you know the testimony brother B
[1:22:53] Billy Paul he was 16-year-old boy
[1:22:54] brother B stops the pade gets them all
[1:22:57] out lines them up on the road he takes
[1:22:59] dirt throws it up on their feet every
[1:23:00] one of the brothers feet he said the
[1:23:02] angel the Lord told me to go to this
[1:23:03] city you're making me go to this city he
[1:23:06] said I don't have money I don't have a
[1:23:08] car I have no way out you have me
[1:23:10] trapped he said we're going to go there
[1:23:11] and God will bless it but we're all
[1:23:13] going to pay for it brother ROM comes
[1:23:15] back to America for a month he's sick
[1:23:17] with the amoeba and brother brandom said
[1:23:19] I learned no matter what anybody tells
[1:23:21] me I always obey the angel of the Lord
[1:23:23] and the word of God you as a Christian
[1:23:26] have you got that far in your life maybe
[1:23:27] you made a mistake and Jesus learned
[1:23:29] obedience by the things that he suffered
[1:23:31] and have you learned obedience by the
[1:23:32] things that you've suffered well I'll
[1:23:34] just go do that anyway it doesn't matter
[1:23:36] nobody's watching and all of a sudden
[1:23:37] God though if he is your father as many
[1:23:39] as I love I chasen and I rebuke are you
[1:23:42] with me and all of a sudden you go
[1:23:44] through some type of mental maybe an
[1:23:46] oppression or something and you get down
[1:23:47] and pray like well what about back here
[1:23:49] when you got away from me yes what about
[1:23:52] you driving 100 miles an hour through
[1:23:54] that Road had all those pothos on it and
[1:23:57] now you got to sit over there and change
[1:23:58] your struts in your car why because you
[1:24:00] RAC through the the road that had the
[1:24:02] poose and sometimes we get racing
[1:24:04] through life and young people you start
[1:24:06] being disrespectful and I got it and I
[1:24:07] like but the Bible says honor your
[1:24:10] father and mother submit yourself one to
[1:24:13] another oh may God help us none of
[1:24:15] that's in my notes but I pray that it
[1:24:17] would help us now a prophet is learning
[1:24:19] obedience and we learn obedience think
[1:24:22] about this in the days of the voice of
[1:24:24] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:24:25] sound the mystery of God shall be
[1:24:27] finished come out of her my people
[1:24:30] Revelations 18 do you realize that
[1:24:32] you're fulfilling those scriptures today
[1:24:33] by sitting in this church Min and
[1:24:36] denominations I I got so much in my
[1:24:39] heart brother CH we have forgotten where
[1:24:41] we came from I think I was here nine
[1:24:44] years ago and we said look we can't pull
[1:24:45] the rug out from underneath this church
[1:24:47] has been built on the foundation of the
[1:24:49] Supernatural and William brandom coming
[1:24:51] to Sister Yanks and the prayer line and
[1:24:53] and the brother Dow and his heart attack
[1:24:55] and brother Brandon praying for him and
[1:24:57] the supernatural that this we can't pull
[1:24:58] the rug out from under underneath those
[1:25:01] things how many understand what I'm
[1:25:02] saying I mean we're built and we're
[1:25:04] built up in the Most Holy Faith and God
[1:25:06] has sent a message in this day so we're
[1:25:08] sitting here fulfilling Revelation 18
[1:25:10] come out of her my people back in the
[1:25:12] 60s people were in denominations you
[1:25:14] know brother Perry green I just was in
[1:25:16] Arizona Tucson they're all in
[1:25:18] denominations they hear a voice and they
[1:25:19] come out of the denominations and now
[1:25:22] there's this thing called the message
[1:25:23] and people are listening listening to
[1:25:24] The Prophet's messages and so many times
[1:25:27] now the the prophet has gone on and and
[1:25:29] then people are getting away from
[1:25:30] listening to the messages of William
[1:25:32] brandom we think it's about a big church
[1:25:33] or a website or it's about a good
[1:25:35] preacher as my one friend was in
[1:25:36] Pentecost he said you know whichever
[1:25:38] preacher had the prettiest wife and she
[1:25:39] sang the best and he sweated the most
[1:25:41] and could quote the most scriptures and
[1:25:43] have a good memory that's who he
[1:25:47] followed but then God sent a prophet in
[1:25:49] our day that's right and he was a Divine
[1:25:51] interpreter of the word and God came and
[1:25:53] Vindicated a message with thousands and
[1:25:55] thousands would line up and he would
[1:25:57] tell them their names and their address
[1:26:00] oh well that doesn't mean anything sure
[1:26:01] meant a lot to the woman at the
[1:26:03] well go get your husband I don't have a
[1:26:05] husband you've had five and the one that
[1:26:06] you live with now is not sure she said I
[1:26:08] know when Messiah comes he'll do what
[1:26:10] you just did he said I'm he Philip found
[1:26:13] Nathaniel behold an Israelite in whom
[1:26:15] there is no G how did you know he said
[1:26:17] before Philip called you I saw you under
[1:26:19] the tree praying he said Thou Art the
[1:26:20] Christ the son of the Living God
[1:26:22] predestinated seeds identify the sign of
[1:26:25] the Messiah in the Bible now unbelievers
[1:26:27] it meant nothing to them whenever they
[1:26:29] got to something except you eat my flesh
[1:26:30] and drink my blood they couldn't explain
[1:26:32] it they just walked away this is a hard
[1:26:33] saying I don't understand it and Jesus
[1:26:35] looked at Peter said you going to go too
[1:26:37] he said Lord where would I go thou alone
[1:26:40] has the words of eternal life praise be
[1:26:42] to God God is so good thinking about
[1:26:46] this go move quickly here I can't see
[1:26:48] that clock in the back but some of the
[1:26:50] things here that will happen in the last
[1:26:51] days you don't have to turn it second
[1:26:53] Timothy you might just write those Down
[1:26:54] 2 Timothy 3:1 the Bible says in the last
[1:26:57] days perilous times shall come we're
[1:27:00] living in those days perilous means
[1:27:03] exposed to imminent risk of disaster or
[1:27:06] ruin you feel like Lord perilous times
[1:27:10] I'm exposed to imminent danger and
[1:27:13] ruin you mean you could take 30 years to
[1:27:16] build your testimony and your child see
[1:27:18] you in front of a computer looking at
[1:27:20] certain things and your whole testimony
[1:27:23] of 30 years could be wiped
[1:27:25] out are you with me you know the Bible
[1:27:28] talks about Powers coming out of the out
[1:27:30] of the Revelation a beast was a power it
[1:27:33] came out there was a beast that came up
[1:27:35] the Roman Catholic Church came out of
[1:27:36] the people out of the waters there was
[1:27:39] another one that came out of land
[1:27:40] Revelations chapter 13 that was America
[1:27:43] she spoke she she came up as a lamb but
[1:27:45] she began to speak as a dragon America
[1:27:47] will begin to speak as a dragon but I
[1:27:49] wonder about the Beast of Google what
[1:27:52] about the Beast of apple and it raised
[1:27:54] and covers the whole earth and there's
[1:27:55] such a power even a president they ban a
[1:27:59] president change a presidency over these
[1:28:01] Powers amen the Bible says we wrestle
[1:28:03] not against flesh and blood but about
[1:28:05] against principalities and Powers
[1:28:08] wickedness in high places I say Lord
[1:28:10] give me the holy spirit because the
[1:28:13] Bible says greater is he that is in you
[1:28:15] than he that is in the world perilous
[1:28:17] times they're here this is the last days
[1:28:19] he goes on to say men shall wax worse
[1:28:21] and worse we're seeing this day the
[1:28:24] these scriptures are being fulfilled it
[1:28:25] shouldn't surprise us we should say no
[1:28:27] my road map is exactly right road map
[1:28:30] said that scoffers would come in the
[1:28:32] last days that second Tim 2 Peter 3:3 in
[1:28:34] the last days scoffers should come they
[1:28:36] would scul at you in your faith in just
[1:28:40] as they did Noah in Noah's day there's
[1:28:41] no rain up there I can prove to you we
[1:28:44] Shot Rock ups there's no and then God
[1:28:46] and the door shut we're getting close to
[1:28:49] that time yes sir brother R said when
[1:28:52] the gospel is not as effective as it
[1:28:54] used to be let me just stop right here
[1:28:55] and say we moved to a new church here a
[1:28:57] few years ago in in downtown Louisville
[1:29:01] it was a bad area town we put a speaker
[1:29:02] outside and a deacon had to stay outside
[1:29:05] and and watch over the cars and things
[1:29:07] like that I was out there for two years
[1:29:10] and let me say this preaching just like
[1:29:11] this we would just pipe the audio video
[1:29:13] we just pipe it out put the speaker on
[1:29:15] the street there wasn't one person that
[1:29:17] ever came inside the church hearing the
[1:29:19] gospel being preached on the
[1:29:21] street not one we're entering into a
[1:29:25] time brother R said the gospel will
[1:29:26] become ineffective it doesn't move
[1:29:28] people there's too many they got that
[1:29:30] you know we we're just going through the
[1:29:32] seals the the four horse riders and the
[1:29:34] last one was The Pale Horse it was all
[1:29:36] mixed up together and death followed it
[1:29:38] and you see people you talk and talking
[1:29:40] to them and their eyes kind of get that
[1:29:41] glazed over look it's that pale horse
[1:29:44] rider spiritual death be you know what
[1:29:46] I'm talking about you see people once go
[1:29:48] to church on fire for God love God and
[1:29:50] then you talk to him like well I don't
[1:29:51] know today's the Super Bowl I don't know
[1:29:53] if I'm going to church or or
[1:29:57] not the God of this evil age and they'll
[1:30:00] go there and they'll worship and they'll
[1:30:02] shout and they'll praise their God now
[1:30:04] you know people ball games whatever you
[1:30:06] you have a pastor he'll lead and guide
[1:30:08] you I'll just say this your first
[1:30:09] emotion should go to Jesus Christ you
[1:30:12] might cheer for Johnny hitting a home
[1:30:13] run but when you get in church you
[1:30:14] better really cheer for Jesus that hit
[1:30:17] it out of the park one day when there
[1:30:19] was no man worthy and he came and took
[1:30:22] the book out of him that sat on the and
[1:30:24] there was praise and honor and Glory
[1:30:26] went up for the great one Jesus Christ
[1:30:30] amen that's where I want my praise and
[1:30:31] my glory and my honor go to Jesus Christ
[1:30:34] because no man was worthy but one Jesus
[1:30:37] Christ he looked he said I heard a a
[1:30:39] lion speak fear not for the lion of the
[1:30:41] tribe of Judah hath prevailed he said I
[1:30:43] looked to see a lion he saw a bleeding
[1:30:45] lamb that's right he was
[1:30:48] bleeding he was Bloody why for your sins
[1:30:52] for my sins he is interceding for me
[1:30:55] when that teacher said you have the
[1:30:57] filthiest mouth in the school it was
[1:30:59] because I had a a lamb amen it wasn't
[1:31:02] Chad lam it was the Lamb of God and I
[1:31:04] believe brother Chad Lam is trying to
[1:31:06] point you like John the Baptist said
[1:31:07] Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:31:10] the sins of the world Amen because blood
[1:31:12] of bulls and goats I mean we're in
[1:31:13] Hebrews now the blood of bulls and goats
[1:31:15] would never take it away it would just
[1:31:16] cover it up amen but what there was
[1:31:18] coming a lamb that would take away the
[1:31:21] sins of the world aren't you glad today
[1:31:23] the lamb has come and taking away your
[1:31:26] sins we're made nigh by the blood of
[1:31:29] Jesus Christ Christ The Mystery of God
[1:31:31] revealed what is the new birth brother
[1:31:32] random Jesus Christ personally revealed
[1:31:36] to
[1:31:37] you listen to me this is not group
[1:31:40] therapy you know we have brothers and we
[1:31:42] love one another but this is an
[1:31:44] individual thing where you hear the
[1:31:45] gospel amen we're all all have sinned
[1:31:48] and come short of the glory of God and
[1:31:50] the wages of sin are death and go right
[1:31:51] down the Roman Road but the gift of God
[1:31:53] is eternal ET life through Jesus Christ
[1:31:55] Our Lord whosoever shall call upon the
[1:31:57] name of the Lord he's going to be saved
[1:32:00] I'm not calling you to a church Theory
[1:32:02] or a church doctrine I'm not even
[1:32:03] calling you to the message cliche I'm
[1:32:06] calling you to Jesus

[1:33:41] kind of girl I'm looking for she has
[1:33:43] modest apparel that's what I want

[1:34:14] God Amen may God help us praise be to
[1:34:18] God we better move right along okay
[1:34:20] let's go to Romans the first chapter is
[1:34:22] this okay this is the word of God as
[1:34:24] long as I stay in my Bible I'm good
[1:34:26] that's why I believe this message it's
[1:34:27] in the Bible you you say I don't believe
[1:34:29] the message well you're throwing out the
[1:34:30] Bible to tell me who is restoring our
[1:34:33] hearts back to the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:34:35] amen praise the Lord Romans the first
[1:34:38] chapter this is a lot going on here but
[1:34:40] I this is what we you say the one man
[1:34:42] said I don't know what I want to do in
[1:34:43] life but I know what I don't want to do
[1:34:45] I'm going to show you something you
[1:34:46] don't want to do okay Romans the 1st
[1:34:48] chapter verse 24 don't have time to read
[1:34:50] the whole thing but the Bible says they
[1:34:51] stting to worship the creation more than
[1:34:54] the Creator they start worshiping the
[1:34:55] the the football players more than they
[1:34:57] worship the god that created the
[1:34:59] football players is that all right I
[1:35:02] tell you those people aren't worshippers
[1:35:03] they love but they love the God of this
[1:35:05] evil age and so the Bible says right
[1:35:07] here verse 24 Romans 1:24 wherefore God
[1:35:10] gave them up to
[1:35:12] uncleanness oh I was born like this
[1:35:15] don't doubt you were born like that oh
[1:35:17] we had these genes in our family and
[1:35:19] because they believe that and they
[1:35:20] create a culture is everybody with me
[1:35:23] and they pass laws and all this God gave
[1:35:25] them up to uncleanness is that what your
[1:35:28] Bible says I want I say Lord don't give
[1:35:30] me up to uncleanness I was sitting with
[1:35:32] somebody the other day and say you know
[1:35:34] I know I'm doing wrong and I'm living
[1:35:35] like that but what at least my
[1:35:36] conscience isn't
[1:35:38] seared I'm like if you're continuing sin
[1:35:40] how was it it says in it was it
[1:35:42] Galatians there shall we continue in
[1:35:44] grace that shall we continue in sin that
[1:35:46] Grace May abound no God came to save us
[1:35:49] from our
[1:35:50] sins God gave them up to uncleanness
[1:35:53] through the lust of their own Hearts the
[1:35:56] dishonoring of their bodies between
[1:35:58] themselves I know we're going to talk to
[1:36:00] the young people in a few hours but this
[1:36:01] is good for all of us right here we see
[1:36:03] a culture that's changing I want you to
[1:36:05] see what the Bible talks about this
[1:36:07] same-sex marriage and homosexuality and
[1:36:09] lgbqt question mark whatever it is
[1:36:12] there's I think there's 16 genders now
[1:36:14] they they have there it's confusion it's
[1:36:16] what the Bible says it's confusion but
[1:36:18] look at these words the Bible calls it
[1:36:19] uncleanness it calls it lust he calls it
[1:36:22] dishonor is that what your Bible says it
[1:36:25] doesn't change can't change our opinions
[1:36:28] with the changing of times if we believe
[1:36:30] the Bible now if we throw the way the
[1:36:31] Bible then we can change our culture and
[1:36:33] change our churches but as long as it's
[1:36:35] in the Bible oh there's such power in
[1:36:37] the word of God Amen the word of God is
[1:36:40] quick and it's
[1:36:41] powerful amen verse 25 who changed the
[1:36:45] truth of God into a lie and worshiped
[1:36:47] and serve the creature more than the
[1:36:48] Creator who is blessed forever amen for
[1:36:51] this cause God gave them up you know I
[1:36:55] don't know what I want to do in life but
[1:36:57] I know what I don't want to do and I
[1:36:58] never want to get to the place where God
[1:37:00] gives you up
[1:37:01] like aren't you glad God didn't give up
[1:37:03] on you God did we shouldn't give up on
[1:37:06] each other either but the Bible says
[1:37:08] there comes a place where God gave them
[1:37:10] up unto vile affections for even their
[1:37:13] women did change the natural use into
[1:37:16] that which is against nature so the
[1:37:18] Bible calls it vile affections verse 26
[1:37:21] verse 27 likewise also the men leaving
[1:37:23] the the natural use of the woman burned
[1:37:25] in their F in their lust one towards
[1:37:27] another men with men working that which
[1:37:29] is unseemly so look what the Bible is
[1:37:30] saying it's vile affections it's not
[1:37:32] natural it's a lust it's unseemly
[1:37:35] working in themselves that recompense of
[1:37:37] their he which is met and even as they
[1:37:39] did not like to retain God in their
[1:37:41] knowledge think about that we did not
[1:37:43] like to retain the word of God we did
[1:37:47] not like to retain the word of God in
[1:37:49] our minds what happened to those people
[1:37:52] God gave them over to a reprobate mind
[1:37:55] to do those things which are not
[1:37:57] convenient then he goes through a whole
[1:37:59] list of things that happen after God
[1:38:00] gives you up all of these things happen
[1:38:03] but down in the last verse of verse
[1:38:05] 32 who knowing the Judgment of God that
[1:38:08] they which commit such things are worthy
[1:38:09] of death not only do the same but have
[1:38:11] pleasure in them that do them brother
[1:38:15] Daniel I don't like you I was just
[1:38:17] reading the road map just reading the
[1:38:19] road map you can shoot the messenger and
[1:38:22] you can Stone Steven but you can't
[1:38:24] change the truth amen I'm just pointing
[1:38:27] you to the road map this is what the
[1:38:28] word of God says as as as long as I stay
[1:38:31] behind that amen I'm good and the Bible
[1:38:33] says in another place I think it's
[1:38:35] Ephesians chapter you and such were some
[1:38:37] of you but you've been washed but you've
[1:38:40] been Sanctified he goes on here chapter
[1:38:42] 2 it's really interesting uh it goes
[1:38:45] down in verse number four of chapter 2
[1:38:47] or despises thou The Riches of his
[1:38:49] goodness and the forbearance of his
[1:38:51] longsuffering not knowing that the
[1:38:52] goodness of God God leadth thee to
[1:38:55] repentance is that what your Bible says
[1:38:58] and somewhere we might have even been in
[1:38:59] the same place and the goodness of God
[1:39:02] begin to lead you hey this isn't natural
[1:39:05] this is vile affections and something
[1:39:08] inside you you you you believe in being
[1:39:10] led of the Holy Spirit the Bible says as
[1:39:12] many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:39:14] they are the sons of God not that they
[1:39:16] can explain it remember those two little
[1:39:18] God needed two zebras in the ark and
[1:39:21] these men built this big thing it's not
[1:39:22] natural right you some of you do we have
[1:39:24] hunters in here anybody a
[1:39:25] hunter and they build this big Ark and
[1:39:28] they have this dark wait the ark is just
[1:39:29] a few things down the road if you've
[1:39:31] been to the ark and they B the replica
[1:39:33] and now it's this big up on a hill and
[1:39:35] there's a just big this big black hole
[1:39:37] with the ramp going up and two zebras
[1:39:39] are in a herd of zebras and something
[1:39:41] moves over zebra
[1:39:43] like I don't know what noise zebras
[1:39:47] make my little grandbaby probably know
[1:39:50] but something began to move in this one
[1:39:52] zebra to go into that thing up on the
[1:39:55] hill right and there was just one
[1:39:58] other person in their herd that felt the
[1:40:01] same thing but nobody else did and over
[1:40:03] with the turkeys and over with the
[1:40:05] donkeys something just too like I'm not
[1:40:07] going to worry about who's around me I
[1:40:09] feel led by the Holy Spirit to go in
[1:40:11] that we have an Ark of Safety it's the
[1:40:13] word of God Amen I feel led to dedicate
[1:40:17] my life to the word of God I feel led to
[1:40:20] shun the very appearance of evil I I
[1:40:23] feel led to to to resist the devil and
[1:40:26] he'll flee from me is somebody with me I
[1:40:28] feel led to draw nigh unto God I feel
[1:40:31] led to lift my hands and Worship the
[1:40:34] Lord how do he say in Timothy I would
[1:40:36] that men lift up holy hands I feel led
[1:40:39] to dress in modest apparel as a woman
[1:40:41] and if a woman's got to do it wouldn't
[1:40:43] it be good for us men
[1:40:44] too run around naked in a basketball and
[1:40:47] a little brother I'll preach God's
[1:40:48] power of transformation right here a
[1:40:50] little going out people like oh
[1:40:51] that's brother Brandon's Pion I like
[1:40:53] that well wait a minute wait a minute
[1:40:54] the prophet of God is looking at Spirits
[1:40:56] he's not looking at your shorts he's
[1:40:58] looking at a spirit and identifying
[1:41:00] that's a manifestation of your that that
[1:41:02] the shorts are a manifestation of your
[1:41:04] spirit oh brother Daniel let me give you
[1:41:06] a little illustration you come home from
[1:41:08] work and that little guys out there with
[1:41:09] this mower like little
[1:41:13] short brother said you're identifying a
[1:41:15] right there so I ask any of them

[1:41:20] something you go to church yeah hey I'm
[1:41:22] a Christian I love God let me ask ask a
[1:41:23] question are you a man enough to go tell
[1:41:26] your wife that she needs to to dress
[1:41:28] modestly and not to cut her hair and are
[1:41:30] you a man enough to go to a church that
[1:41:32] baptizes in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:41:35] not in the Trinity of Father Son and
[1:41:37] Holy Spirit which is not a part of the
[1:41:38] Bible Well I could never do that well
[1:41:39] why can't you cuz my wife won't lay at
[1:41:41] me and their family you

[1:41:49] we're going to go to a church that
[1:41:50] believes in baptism in Jesus is this
[1:41:51] okay prophet of God is identifying a
[1:41:53] spirit I'd like to see a real man he may
[1:41:55] not make a lot of money he may not be
[1:41:57] real smart but he says I believe the
[1:41:59] word of God and I'm going to be a man

[1:42:02] God I'm going to lift my hands and
[1:42:03] worship God and I'm not perfect is it

[1:42:16] did wrong I don't think there's any
[1:42:18] shame in that we're in uncharted waters
[1:42:21] we see things all around us in the
[1:42:22] virtual world the internets and the
[1:42:24] house and all these things virtually
[1:42:25] just coming like and there's no virtue
[1:42:27] say there's no shame and say I started
[1:42:30] down the wrong road but the holy spirit
[1:42:31] is leading me to come back to the path
[1:42:34] and I'm lead my family in the paths of
[1:42:37] righteousness is that okay and I you
[1:42:40] know I tell you what sometimes you Lo
[1:42:42] this just comes from 35 years of
[1:42:44] marriage right here okay sometimes you
[1:42:46] lose the trust to your wife or your
[1:42:48] family but there's nothing that brings
[1:42:50] that trust back like seeing in an Open
[1:42:52] Bible in a man kneeling down with his
[1:42:54] face in his Bible saying God help me God
[1:42:57] let me lead my family right let me be a
[1:42:59] godly man let me lead my children Lord
[1:43:01] when I make a mistake God forgive me let
[1:43:03] me lead them right Lord their souls are
[1:43:05] in my hand I've got to answer for them
[1:43:07] we'll stop right here right remember
[1:43:08] brother Ram said the woman will never
[1:43:10] answer for the husband but the husband
[1:43:11] will answer for the wife and for the
[1:43:13] children he says children we need to
[1:43:15] listen to Daddy because he's got to
[1:43:16] answer for us at the day of judgment we
[1:43:18] just need to stand behind daddy whatever
[1:43:20] he feels if it's going in the right
[1:43:21] direction is this okay
[1:43:23] may God help us and may the fear of God
[1:43:25] come back in our homes come back in our
[1:43:27] families May the pillar of fire amen
[1:43:29] Jesus amen the word became flesh
[1:43:32] remember in the beginning was the word
[1:43:34] with word was with God the Word was God
[1:43:36] that's St John 1:1 ver14 and the word
[1:43:38] became flesh and dwelt Among Us you know
[1:43:41] some people have to make a silhouette of
[1:43:42] Jesus and let him sit in your house it
[1:43:44] would change the way we talked and the
[1:43:45] thing but if we by Revelation realize
[1:43:48] Christ is here he's with us as one
[1:43:50] brother he preached a sermon and brother
[1:43:52] asked him later he said would you have
[1:43:54] preached that if William Brandon was
[1:43:55] sitting on the front row of the church
[1:43:57] like no I don't think I would have said
[1:43:59] that well what about Christ being here
[1:44:02] today what about me putting a guard I
[1:44:05] think it was he put a guard over his
[1:44:06] mouth my we're covering a lot of things
[1:44:09] today aren't we may the Lord help
[1:44:12] us have you heard of the influencers on
[1:44:15] social media yall are smiling some of
[1:44:18] you some you don't know what I'm talking
[1:44:19] about some of you do so they have in
[1:44:21] influencers on Instagram and Facebook
[1:44:25] and YouTube and those those things and
[1:44:28] people millions of followers and then
[1:44:30] somebody pays them money to point people
[1:44:32] to a corporation or to point people to a
[1:44:36] product or to lead Society in a certain
[1:44:38] way because they have gain and I thought
[1:44:40] about that because they have such power
[1:44:42] the power of the internet or the power
[1:44:44] of social media and the these people
[1:44:45] become very powerful and I thought about
[1:44:48] that because Jesus wants influencers too
[1:44:51] amen but these these people he said
[1:44:54] without me you can't do anything so they
[1:44:56] have to have Jesus to be an
[1:44:58] influencer so Jesus said in Acts the
[1:45:01] first chapter remember Peter he gave him
[1:45:03] the Keys of the Kingdom he turned it up
[1:45:05] to be nothing but a cussing preacher and
[1:45:08] denied Christ and so he told him acts 1
[1:45:10] 18 He said I want you to go to the city
[1:45:12] of Jerusalem and I want you to T there
[1:45:15] and you'll be endued with a power from
[1:45:17] on high it'll be the holy spirit that
[1:45:18] will come and give you a power and me
[1:45:20] Acts 2 after Peter got it he said repent
[1:45:22] and be baptized and you shall receive
[1:45:24] the gift of the Holy Ghost you shall
[1:45:26] receive this power inside of you and he
[1:45:28] said after you get this power then
[1:45:30] you'll be my Witnesses then you'll be my
[1:45:33] influencers you know if we get if we
[1:45:36] read our Bible and let the Holy Spirit
[1:45:37] speak to us we won't be drawn away to be
[1:45:39] like the world we say I don't need to be
[1:45:42] an influencer for the devil because God
[1:45:44] has already employed me to be an
[1:45:47] influencer for Jesus
[1:45:51] Christ I say God Endo me again this
[1:45:54] morning with the power from on high Lord
[1:45:56] I want to be an influencer maybe I've
[1:45:58] got away from the power and my influence
[1:46:00] Jesus said about the salt if the salt
[1:46:02] has lost its savior it is henceforth
[1:46:04] good for nothing but to be cast out and
[1:46:07] and we lose our influence as a
[1:46:10] Christian that's why they said I could
[1:46:12] never be on social media they said you
[1:46:14] can't get on there and be preachy you
[1:46:15] can't be preachy you can't this is just
[1:46:18] like everybody's good like you can't
[1:46:19] like and and so you know hey I don't
[1:46:23] know it's in the Bible so I think it's
[1:46:24] James right there in James whosoever is
[1:46:26] a friend of the world has become an
[1:46:28] enemy of God so when those people are
[1:46:31] dressed immoral and doing immoral things
[1:46:33] and you click like and you become a
[1:46:36] friend you have just
[1:46:38] become a an enemy of almighty God and
[1:46:42] you've lost your influence as an
[1:46:44] influence in the kingdom of
[1:46:49] God remember brother Brandon he went to
[1:46:51] that little garage tell them about
[1:46:53] Christ the owner come out and said
[1:46:55] William brandom you're welcome here
[1:46:56] anytime as a man but you your Jesus
[1:46:59] Christ isn't welcome he made these
[1:47:01] amazing statements he said wherever
[1:47:03] Jesus Christ is not welcome I'm not
[1:47:05] welcome and brother Brandon Walks out of
[1:47:07] the garage a few minutes later the man
[1:47:10] is walking around the curb and it's icy
[1:47:13] he slips off and a truck runs over top
[1:47:15] of him and mashes his body brother Ram
[1:47:17] said I wonder if he would want Jesus
[1:47:19] Christ in that
[1:47:20] time there's coming a Time this the the
[1:47:24] the the the scripture says that the
[1:47:25] mountain the the rocks and the mountains
[1:47:27] will will the the people will cry is it
[1:47:29] right if we just talk about reality here
[1:47:32] I don't like people to scare me but I do
[1:47:34] like to know the truth okay I do like to
[1:47:36] know the truth so I was reading over
[1:47:38] there in in in in the book of of in The
[1:47:41] Sixth Seal my wife and I are going
[1:47:42] through the Sixth Seal and the Bible
[1:47:44] says that the that the uh that the the
[1:47:47] the rich man and all the Great Men
[1:47:48] they'll cry for the rocks and the
[1:47:50] mountains say fall on us and hide from
[1:47:53] the face of him that sth on the throne
[1:47:55] from the Wrath of the Lamb this is what
[1:47:58] the road map says is
[1:48:00] coming I don't like to be scared I don't
[1:48:02] like people scaring me and putting the
[1:48:04] fear tactics and some of you all maybe
[1:48:06] that's what you do for a living like hey
[1:48:08] you buy by tonight it's 20% off if you
[1:48:10] don't do it tomorrow and the Dinger
[1:48:11] you're not getting it I don't like that
[1:48:13] I just wait till tomorrow and pay the
[1:48:15] extra 20% because I want to make a
[1:48:19] decision my mind is just will you bear
[1:48:21] will you give me a few more minutes
[1:48:23] and sometimes brother that's why brother
[1:48:25] BR he wasn't against altar calls people
[1:48:26] coming because in the Bible all great
[1:48:29] Patriarchs built an altar you go through
[1:48:31] every time they met God they built an
[1:48:33] altar and we should be building altars
[1:48:35] continually it's not I'm going up to get
[1:48:36] saved again I'm going to build an altar
[1:48:38] and rededicate my heart to Jesus Christ
[1:48:40] brother Brandon wasn't against alter
[1:48:42] Calla he was against the emotion of you
[1:48:44] don't you'll never see Granny if you
[1:48:45] don't get up here don't you want to see
[1:48:47] gran and it's an emotion I don't like
[1:48:49] that just tell me the facts you're going
[1:48:52] there's only two places to go heaven or
[1:48:53] hell those are the facts it's appointed
[1:48:56] under man wants to die that's the easy
[1:48:57] part after that's the Judgment Lord help
[1:49:00] me I'm coming to that judgment Lord let
[1:49:02] me make brother M said we come with all
[1:49:04] sanness and
[1:49:06] soberness I had I have so many
[1:49:08] experiences one time I was at a youth
[1:49:10] camp and they preached a message called
[1:49:11] God will burn your barley fields have
[1:49:13] you ever heard and they did that back in
[1:49:15] the day they would preach on God will
[1:49:16] burn your barleyfields talking about
[1:49:18] Samson and when they didn't come he went
[1:49:21] he lit the foxes and he burned God and
[1:49:23] God's going to burn your barley fields
[1:49:24] and you're not you're going to have a
[1:49:25] car wreck and you're going to this and
[1:49:27] this
[1:49:28] Minister you know you go through things
[1:49:30] in life and it leaves like a little scar
[1:49:31] on you I was at a youth camp and this
[1:49:34] man started doing the countdown
[1:49:36] 10 if you're lost and you're not at this
[1:49:38] altar when I get to one you're lost and
[1:49:40] God's going to burn your barley fields
[1:49:41] and you're going to hell nine it and I
[1:49:45] was like sitting like right you know
[1:49:46] where you're in a service and something
[1:49:48] happens and you're scarred for life and
[1:49:49] I was sitting there and I was in like
[1:49:52] Lord Jesus this isn't happening this man
[1:49:54] is taking 10year olds and bringing the
[1:49:56] fear of hell and they got to do it in 10
[1:49:59] seconds I've got to make a d a a
[1:50:02] destination for my soul in 10
[1:50:05] seconds Lord God and then I hear a
[1:50:08] prophet said no it's not based on an
[1:50:10] emotion it's based on come sanely and
[1:50:12] soberly to the word of God and realize
[1:50:16] you're a sinner and there's only one
[1:50:17] place to go and it's appointed unto man
[1:50:19] want to die and the wages of sin is
[1:50:21] death but the gift of God is eternal
[1:50:23] life through Jesus Christ Our Lorden I
[1:50:26] don't need 10 seconds on that I just
[1:50:28] need his holy spirit to say Daniel I'm
[1:50:30] the way I'm the truth I'm life come to
[1:50:33] me all you that are weary and heavy
[1:50:34] laden and I got up from my chair and
[1:50:36] walked to the Altar and I knelt down it
[1:50:38] was between me and him and I can't
[1:50:40] explain everything that happened there
[1:50:41] but something changed in my life it
[1:50:44] changed the course of my life forever
[1:50:46] and God I keep going back to that maybe
[1:50:48] there's somebody here that you need to
[1:50:50] make that decision for Christ not under
[1:50:52] fear but the Holy Spirit dealing with
[1:50:54] you and dealing with amen as many as the
[1:50:57] father loves he chastens and
[1:50:59] rebukes I love that Jesus said and I
[1:51:01] won't lose one of them there was a group
[1:51:04] of names that written on the Lamb's Book
[1:51:06] of Life and you can run but you can't
[1:51:10] hide Samson tried to run he gave his he
[1:51:13] gave his heart to God but he gave his
[1:51:16] strength to Delilah how'd that work out
[1:51:18] for him and one day when he was grinding
[1:51:20] at the meal and going around and around
[1:51:23] he realized you know what there's a
[1:51:24] better life prodical Sons out there he
[1:51:26] had it all and he threw it all way
[1:51:28] there's a better life he said I'll arise
[1:51:30] and go back to my father's house you
[1:51:32] know what I'll go back to the Potter
[1:51:33] will and let God touch my life amen it
[1:51:37] might cause tears to come out of your
[1:51:38] eyes that's not a bad thing God said a
[1:51:41] broken and a contrite heart I'll never
[1:51:43] despise I'll never turn it away and when
[1:51:46] you look at the the road map it says in
[1:51:48] Revelations chap 6 that the rocks and
[1:51:50] the mountains are going to fall this is
[1:51:52] reality
[1:51:53] they're going to follow they'll cry let
[1:51:55] them fall on us and hide us from the
[1:51:57] Wrath of the Lamb this is Revelation 6
[1:52:00] verse 17 for the great day of his wrath
[1:52:02] is come and who shall be able to stand
[1:52:06] brother random says this in a message uh
[1:52:09] in the message former and latter rain I
[1:52:11] was listening to the other day he said
[1:52:12] you don't have to be drunk upon wine the
[1:52:15] only thing you have to be drunk on
[1:52:17] tonight is the things of the world he's
[1:52:19] talking about Nebuchadnezzar and they
[1:52:21] were had their drunken party he was
[1:52:22] talking about Pearl Harbor they're
[1:52:24] having the drunken party and the
[1:52:25] Japanese come up now he's talking about
[1:52:26] America and the destruction that lays
[1:52:28] ahead you know brother B tells us that
[1:52:31] he said Russia has a bomb with your name
[1:52:33] on it you see all these prophecies are
[1:52:36] laying oh there never was a prophecy no
[1:52:38] look at these prophecies there's Russia
[1:52:40] has a bomb with your name on it I don't
[1:52:42] have it printed here the seven visions
[1:52:43] of brother brandom in 1933 that he
[1:52:45] begins to tell about miscellany invading
[1:52:48] he tells about the the cars driving this
[1:52:50] is 1933 just the square Model A and he
[1:52:52] says there's going to be cars coming
[1:52:53] they'll drive there won't even be
[1:52:55] somebody and now the Google car yeah
[1:52:56] it's a Google car it drivve no no no
[1:52:58] wait you're going back 90 years and a
[1:53:00] prophet is telling you this is
[1:53:02] coming in the midst of a spiritual
[1:53:05] Revival we were talking about the other
[1:53:06] day spiritual Revival and Billy Graham
[1:53:08] and Oral Roberts and AA Allen and and
[1:53:11] and and Jack Cole and all those tent
[1:53:12] revivals everywhere and brother R has
[1:53:14] the vision said the moral plot of women
[1:53:16] will go to filthy and he said I almost
[1:53:19] see him as naked just a little fig leaf
[1:53:21] and we see that all around us today it's
[1:53:23] everywhere and and then he has a vision
[1:53:25] he said I see a woman rising in power it
[1:53:28] may be the Roman Catholic Church he said
[1:53:30] rising to power let me stop right there
[1:53:32] because I think it's um rejected King
[1:53:34] right there in 1960 when they elected
[1:53:35] John F Kennedy there never was a
[1:53:37] Catholic President and then John F
[1:53:39] Kennedy was elected right then brother R
[1:53:41] said he won't have much effect now but
[1:53:42] as Watch What Happens later down the
[1:53:44] road and now we see our Senate and
[1:53:46] Congress the the Catholics influences
[1:53:48] has he said it may be the Catholic
[1:53:50] church or their influence or he said a a
[1:53:52] president or vice president that is a
[1:53:54] woman in that day was like we're just
[1:53:56] letting them vote back and now we see a
[1:53:58] vice president these prophecies have
[1:54:00] been fulfilled if the six of them were
[1:54:02] fulfilled the seventh Vision was America
[1:54:05] was in
[1:54:07] ashes I American ashes are we sound
[1:54:10] people today we're listening to a
[1:54:11] Vindicated message and we must keep that
[1:54:14] in mind we've had unprecedented listen
[1:54:16] to me we talk to the businessmen and you
[1:54:18] young men we've had unprecedented
[1:54:20] prosperity in America inflation what 2
[1:54:22] 3% and now it's starting like oh
[1:54:25] inflation interest rate six or no it
[1:54:28] used to be 18 way back in Jimmy Carter
[1:54:30] way back there we've had unprecedented
[1:54:32] prosperian and so when you come along
[1:54:33] and say the prophet of God saw an like
[1:54:35] oh you're crazy you're just an old fogy
[1:54:38] I'm no I've been reading the road map
[1:54:41] I've been reading the road map the rocks
[1:54:43] and the mountains they'll cry for them
[1:54:45] to fall on
[1:54:46] us is this
[1:54:49] okay I'll never be popular money women
[1:54:52] popularity I'll never have a problem
[1:54:53] with popularity as long as I preach like
[1:54:55] this but it's reality if there's if
[1:54:57] there's potholes in the road up there I
[1:54:59] want to know it so when I get there I I
[1:55:00] I I gauge my life accordingly and so
[1:55:03] when I know that America is going to be
[1:55:04] in ashes I don't lay up Treasures on
[1:55:06] Earth where moss and rust do corrupt but
[1:55:08] I lay up Treasures in Heaven where moth
[1:55:11] and rust do not corrupt and where
[1:55:12] thieves do not break through and steal
[1:55:14] that's what we're doing this morning
[1:55:16] we're laying up Treasures in Heaven the
[1:55:19] other day we're we lease a building
[1:55:21] we're in the building and the wind was
[1:55:22] blowing it was like 50 mph winds and the
[1:55:25] wind was blowing we had some Le pieces
[1:55:27] of metal that aren't screwed in all the
[1:55:29] way down and they were thrashing bad and
[1:55:32] somebody come in said hey that other
[1:55:33] building the the the the winds the metal
[1:55:35] could fly off and hit our cars and I'm
[1:55:37] sitting there and it's blowing blowing
[1:55:39] and I all of a sudden this scripture
[1:55:41] begins to come to my mind and I was
[1:55:44] thinking about those things and then you
[1:55:46] start mixing you know an earthquake like
[1:55:49] oh we just had a little trimmer but now
[1:55:50] an earthquake for 2 minutes you can't
[1:55:52] stand up and you're laying on the ground
[1:55:54] and now the wind's maybe 150 M an hour
[1:55:57] and now volcanoes are coming up out of
[1:55:59] the earth and now Thunder have you heard
[1:56:01] lightning oh that was that was that was
[1:56:03] neat lightning I see the lightning and
[1:56:05] then I wait count the seconds it's
[1:56:06] that's how many miles away it is right
[1:56:08] oh that's really neat but now unending
[1:56:10] lightning and thunder and if you read in
[1:56:12] the Bible it says the the the the the
[1:56:14] clouds roll like a scroll I don't know
[1:56:16] if that's nuclear Powers dropping in the
[1:56:18] like you see the mushroom and the and
[1:56:19] the clouds I don't know but the Bible
[1:56:21] tells it's
[1:56:23] coming and the rich men the the Elon
[1:56:27] Musk and the Trump and the gates and all
[1:56:29] those people are crying let the Rocks
[1:56:30] fall on us for the Wrath of the Lamb is
[1:56:34] coming brother B says in another place
[1:56:37] it's a total Interruption of nature
[1:56:38] everything that's that's not natural no
[1:56:41] it's the Wrath of the Lamb that's why
[1:56:44] the Bible says I'll send you Elijah the
[1:56:45] prophet before the great and Dreadful
[1:56:47] day of the Lord there's a great and
[1:56:49] Dreadful day of the Lord I'm not here to
[1:56:51] scare people but I I am here to bury you
[1:56:53] the tidings that when you get up on that
[1:56:54] road there's there there's potholes
[1:56:56] there there is a great and Dreadful day
[1:56:58] of the Lord that's coming and I don't
[1:56:59] want to be a part of that but I have a
[1:57:02] promise you shall be changed in a
[1:57:05] moment in a twinkling of an eye you'll
[1:57:07] be caught up to meet the Lord himself
[1:57:10] amen the Bible says and the Lord shall
[1:57:12] descend from heaven with a shout which
[1:57:13] is a message I'm going to preach the
[1:57:14] Rapture message right here in 30 seconds
[1:57:16] or less she'll descend from heaven with
[1:57:18] the shout which is a message brother Ram
[1:57:20] said it was the bread of life going over
[1:57:21] the Earth to gather the bride of Christ
[1:57:24] together are you with me today amen
[1:57:26] we're trying to escape the great Wrath
[1:57:28] of the Lamb that's coming that's
[1:57:30] promised that God sent a prophet and now
[1:57:32] there was a shout there was a message
[1:57:33] that people were feeding on the bread of
[1:57:35] life are you feeding on it amen we
[1:57:37] should be feeding on it Church age book
[1:57:40] I doubt that there's one Ministry that
[1:57:41] has the ability to turn the hearts back
[1:57:43] to the Faith of Our Fathers but the
[1:57:45] ministry of of of Malachi 4 which was
[1:57:47] the ministry of William random we should
[1:57:49] be listening don't let people tell you
[1:57:51] oh those preachers they're trying to get
[1:57:52] people away from the message no you're
[1:57:53] listening to one that's telling you you
[1:57:55] need to go listen to The Prophet's
[1:57:56] message remember the first Forerunner he
[1:57:58] was the one that said Behold the Lamb of
[1:57:59] God that takes away the sin of the world
[1:58:01] but there were other people saying hey
[1:58:02] there's John there's John we have an
[1:58:04] Elijah Minister comes our day but we've
[1:58:05] got a lamb here today brother Chad Lamb
[1:58:07] say listen to The Prophet's message amen
[1:58:09] you should value a preacher that's not
[1:58:11] ashamed to say listen to them there's
[1:58:13] 1,200 of them and he doesn't go through
[1:58:15] like don't listen to this one don't
[1:58:16] listen to this no there they are they
[1:58:18] were spoken public places you should be
[1:58:20] able to listen to them
[1:58:22] oh praise the
[1:58:24] Lord amen I say God bless brother Joseph
[1:58:27] brand that made the table app available
[1:58:28] that I could listen to him wherever I am
[1:58:30] that's a blessing right it's a blessing
[1:58:33] brother Brandon when he dedicated him
[1:58:34] five times in his dedication he said God
[1:58:36] let him be a blessing let him be a
[1:58:38] blessing I say this day that prophecy is
[1:58:40] fulfilled when I listen to the table
[1:58:41] Apper have the thing that Brother Joseph
[1:58:43] brandham is a blessing to the Bride of
[1:58:45] Jesus Christ is that fair is that having
[1:58:48] respect unto giving honor to whom honor
[1:58:50] is due sometimes we there's a big
[1:58:52] problem that we have even in our
[1:58:53] marriages when we disagree with somebody
[1:58:55] we can't say I love you because there's
[1:58:57] this one thing that we disagree on we
[1:58:59] need to be bigger than that one thing we
[1:59:01] need to be bigger than that that's good
[1:59:03] for the church maybe a deacon a trustee
[1:59:05] we disagree and everything in whole life
[1:59:06] is just about this I just preached I was
[1:59:08] a deacon for 13 years been at the same
[1:59:10] church for 35 years this is just stuff
[1:59:12] right when you drive into the church and
[1:59:13] you drive into the parking lot all you
[1:59:15] can hear is the problem with the Pew or
[1:59:18] the problem with this or the Sunday
[1:59:21] school or that Sunday
[1:59:22] it's just human nature right and after a
[1:59:25] while you have to be bigger than
[1:59:26] whatever that is say Lord really takes
[1:59:29] the dads to be the men of like we're
[1:59:31] going to drive in we're going to park
[1:59:32] between the lines we're going to get out
[1:59:34] we're going to go into that place we're
[1:59:36] going to lift our hands and worship God
[1:59:37] we're going to confess our sins we're
[1:59:39] going to draw nigh into God and we're
[1:59:40] going to love the Lord because our
[1:59:42] relationship with Christ is bigger than
[1:59:44] the problem at the
[1:59:47] church let's not skim milk it takes a
[1:59:50] real man or a woman to be mature sure so
[1:59:53] little kids that get down to start
[1:59:54] scrapping and clawing about this they
[1:59:56] they did a movie a few years back called
[1:59:58] the day after I never watched the movie
[2:00:00] but there's a principle out there the
[2:00:01] day after and you think about it this
[2:00:03] will help in the church when you get
[2:00:04] done running the pastor down and you get
[2:00:06] done running the Deacon down and those
[2:00:08] trustees and those musicians I'd run
[2:00:10] them down and pretty soon all of them
[2:00:11] just go home and you come Church isn't
[2:00:14] open lights are still off nobody leads
[2:00:16] the songs nobody plays the instruments
[2:00:18] Pastor he doesn't come out preach
[2:00:19] because you just criticized them and
[2:00:20] they all went home amen somewhere we got
[2:00:23] to build up the Bible says being built
[2:00:24] up in the Most Holy Faith Lord let me be
[2:00:26] a builder let me come together and build
[2:00:29] and Lord you sent gifts into the church
[2:00:30] to make the church stronger Lord I want
[2:00:32] to be supporting those gifts and those
[2:00:34] things of God because God uses flawed
[2:00:37] people look through the Bible he picks
[2:00:39] up flawed people and begins to use a
[2:00:41] Moses begins to use a Paul well God
[2:00:43] could never use a murderer he used Moses
[2:00:45] and he Ed Paul and a blasphemer hey Blas
[2:00:49] well Paul said I was blasphemed but I
[2:00:50] blasphemed ignorantly
[2:00:52] amen may God help us
[2:00:54] today praise the Lord I'm just going to
[2:00:56] come to a close so many
[2:00:59] things will you just give me a couple
[2:01:00] more
[2:01:02] minutes this is so the other day our
[2:01:07] sister there was a sister in our church
[2:01:08] she's from Siberia and she was telling
[2:01:11] me this and it kind of came to mind
[2:01:13] because brother preaches a message
[2:01:14] called is it right to say brother
[2:01:16] brandom sir I mean if I was in Noah's
[2:01:18] day I would be telling like Noah heard
[2:01:20] from God and he said go into the ark I
[2:01:21] lived in Moses day I'd say Moses and so
[2:01:23] many people like they want to tell you a
[2:01:25] story well well let's just give glory to
[2:01:27] God let's no no glory to I'll tell
[2:01:31] you I'm just going to say this okay
[2:01:34] there was this old man who went down to
[2:01:36] this Egypt and he got all those people
[2:01:37] and he did 10 moral notable Miracles and
[2:01:40] he came out and he and he brought them
[2:01:41] all out and that that that old man said
[2:01:44] something to the and open the Red Sea
[2:01:46] and they brought them all the way out
[2:01:47] and they got them over there and they
[2:01:47] were dancing cuz all of them were
[2:01:49] destroyed and we don't need that man the
[2:01:51] old man anymore like why are you ashamed
[2:01:53] to say Moses why why you'd still be in
[2:01:56] the denominations you still believe be
[2:01:58] believ in the eve aen
[2:02:00] Apple you know and baptizing Father Son
[2:02:03] and Holy Spirit and believing the
[2:02:04] evidence was of the Holy Ghost was
[2:02:05] speaking in tongues but God sent a
[2:02:07] prophet in our generation his name was
[2:02:10] William brandham I'm not ashamed of the
[2:02:12] name William brandham because God wasn't
[2:02:15] ashamed to come up and have his picture
[2:02:16] taken with him and if God's not ashamed
[2:02:19] of him I'm not ashamed of him that's
[2:02:21] what Paul said be not ashamed of me his
[2:02:24] his
[2:02:25] messenger he preached a message called
[2:02:27] how can I overcome listen to the message
[2:02:29] it's powerful brother man makes it real
[2:02:31] simple he said you got to keep life in
[2:02:33] you you have to keep life inside of you
[2:02:37] and as a Christian you have to keep life
[2:02:38] inside of you and I was thinking about
[2:02:40] this because this sister tells us she
[2:02:42] was from Siberia and it gets really cold
[2:02:45] up there mdova and there and they'd gone
[2:02:47] to Russia I think she was born there
[2:02:49] sister Kia she was telling me the story
[2:02:51] one day she was coming home from school
[2:02:52] and she got really tired and it's so
[2:02:55] cold up there we were up there in in
[2:02:57] Saskatchewan it was - 36 degrees I don't
[2:03:00] know how people do it I tell I told I
[2:03:04] said you know the first thing I'm going
[2:03:05] to tell Eve when I see Eve I said eve
[2:03:07] whatever they tell you do it you don't
[2:03:09] know what 30ga 36 deg is you broke the
[2:03:13] rules and now it's the curse it's just
[2:03:15] so it was so cold and so now this Kia
[2:03:17] she's talking about living in in Siberia
[2:03:20] and it was so cold and she she one day
[2:03:22] she she was coming home from school and
[2:03:23] she just sat down by the road and she
[2:03:25] got tired she sat down and just rested
[2:03:27] and she was just resting she got home
[2:03:28] she told her mom said Mom I was so tired
[2:03:30] and so cold coming I just sat down by
[2:03:32] the side and her mother looked at her
[2:03:34] said don't you ever don't you ever sit
[2:03:38] down by the side of the road in that
[2:03:39] cold weather because that's the first
[2:03:42] sign of freezing to death and dying and
[2:03:44] I'm here to tell you we live in a
[2:03:46] generation where it's becoming
[2:03:48] cold amen and we see the Revival and
[2:03:51] it's getting cold don't ever ever sit
[2:03:54] down along the road somewhere and say
[2:03:56] I'm just going to rest right here and I
[2:03:58] because it's death it's the signs of
[2:04:01] death you keep going to church you keep
[2:04:03] lifting up your hands amen amen when you
[2:04:05] when you get cold when they say you
[2:04:07] start rubbing your hand am mean you
[2:04:08] create your own heat amen you start
[2:04:10] rubbing and I might have to clap my
[2:04:12] hands I might have I might even have to
[2:04:13] shout a little bit what are you doing
[2:04:16] I'm keeping life in me I refuse to get
[2:04:19] cold in lady OA hot or cold
[2:04:22] cold amen hot or cold say Lord I want to
[2:04:25] be hot for you I don't care what people

[2:04:42] and down like I'm married still have a
[2:04:44] desire to go to God I I made some
[2:04:46] mistakes along the way but this message
[2:04:48] works and it's the Gospel of Jesus
[2:04:49] Christ and I'm not ashamed of the Gospel
[2:04:51] it works amen I'm going to keep going on
[2:04:54] I'm going to keep pressing on maybe
[2:04:56] there's somebody streaming here this
[2:04:57] morning amen and you like to hear that
[2:04:59] keep pressing on don't get cold along
[2:05:01] the way somewhere pick up your Bible get

[2:05:05] strengthen me Lord I want to renew
[2:05:07] myself this morning things that are to
[2:05:10] be things that are to
[2:05:12] be you know I was thinking we just skip
[2:05:15] over a lot of these
[2:05:17] things back to our text he said let not
[2:05:19] your heart be troubled you believe in
[2:05:22] God believe it also in me he said I'm
[2:05:24] going to go and prepare a place for you
[2:05:26] as we get older these words become more
[2:05:28] precious to us when you're young you're
[2:05:29] like I'm Invincible you get older Jesus
[2:05:32] told me he was going to prepare a place
[2:05:34] for me he would come and get me he would
[2:05:36] bring me unto himself is that what Jesus
[2:05:39] Christ told you as a Believer if you're
[2:05:41] not a Believer you're not subject or the
[2:05:43] recipient of those those promises but as
[2:05:45] a Believer you are go down a little road
[2:05:47] with me think about these two little
[2:05:48] babies in the womb two little twins are
[2:05:51] in the womb they're talking together
[2:05:52] like hey it's really warm in here isn't
[2:05:54] it yeah yeah you hear that Thump Thump
[2:05:56] that's our Mama's heartbeat it's so nice
[2:05:59] it's so nice we've never had a problem
[2:06:00] we're just floating around in this ambic
[2:06:02] fluid it's so I reach over and take your
[2:06:04] hand it's so wonderful it's so cozy in
[2:06:06] here I never want to leave this place
[2:06:08] it's so nice but there comes a time and
[2:06:12] they may even have discussions I don't
[2:06:13] know how babies and they play what play
[2:06:15] music to your baby and they pick it up
[2:06:17] and whatever and they maybe even have
[2:06:18] talk like is there life after the womb
[2:06:21] is life after the womb probably write
[2:06:23] books if you gave them we could write
[2:06:24] books is there life after the womb I
[2:06:26] don't want life after the womb I just
[2:06:27] want to live here but there Comes A Time
[2:06:30] usually about nine months like it or not
[2:06:32] you're going to be delivered you're
[2:06:35] coming out of the womb and you may have
[2:06:37] been comfortable in the place that you
[2:06:38] were in this is more than just a parable
[2:06:41] you're coming out and although you may
[2:06:43] fight and scream coming through it
[2:06:45] you're coming out to a new world where
[2:06:47] you can grow and Run and Jump and read
[2:06:49] and sing and talk and have a career and
[2:06:51] all these things like do you ever want
[2:06:53] to go back to the womb do you ever want
[2:06:55] to read that book is their life after no
[2:06:56] because it's a new
[2:06:58] life stay with me here as we grow older
[2:07:01] I don't know if any we're going to live
[2:07:03] to be 150 years old right the road map
[2:07:05] says is appointed unto man once to die
[2:07:08] so if you're in the womb you say I want
[2:07:09] to be here but about 9 months it comes
[2:07:11] time and in our life somewhere along
[2:07:13] there and it might be after knee
[2:07:15] Replacements or hips or whatever and the
[2:07:17] pain and the agony or whatever like yeah
[2:07:20] I think I'm ready
[2:07:22] I think I'm ready and you see the
[2:07:24] sometimes we get the and we don't know
[2:07:26] if we but there was a man that said
[2:07:28] because I live you can live
[2:07:29] also he that liveth and believeth on me
[2:07:32] shall never die there's a whole another
[2:07:34] world that's what the prophet of God he
[2:07:36] goes on he's talking about this I've got
[2:07:38] something here he's talking about uh
[2:07:40] times he said we might not be alive in 5
[2:07:42] minutes he said we don't know when we're
[2:07:44] going this is things that are to be 19
[2:07:46] days before he passes he said it's in
[2:07:48] God's hands he said he didn't know
[2:07:50] himself and when that time would be but
[2:07:53] it's in the hands of God only now he's
[2:07:54] telling them that after death there is
[2:07:56] life because I go and prepare a place
[2:07:58] that is to receive them shows that there
[2:08:00] he is speaking to them that there is a
[2:08:02] life after this life is ended and what a
[2:08:05] constellation that ought to be to all of
[2:08:07] us to know that after this life is over
[2:08:09] there is a life that we go into 19 days
[2:08:12] before he passes he's preaching his own
[2:08:14] funeral there is a life there is life
[2:08:16] beyond the womb with a little two twins
[2:08:18] now the prophet of God is looking to
[2:08:19] that other life 19 days ler he's walking
[2:08:22] through that
[2:08:23] door he said it's a constellation and as
[2:08:26] you get older it becomes more of a
[2:08:27] reality to you and as you begin to see
[2:08:29] the days of your life drying close then
[2:08:32] it begins to you begin to pack up a
[2:08:34] little closer getting ready for that
[2:08:36] great event it's a continuing of this
[2:08:38] same life in another world in another
[2:08:42] place so thankful for a
[2:08:45] prophet showing me the road map and
[2:08:48] furthermore I think he tells going
[2:08:50] beyond the curtain of time time he went
[2:08:51] and hugged those people you know he even
[2:08:53] had a fear himself he didn't want to die
[2:08:56] is this okay he thought he'd be a cloud
[2:08:58] his mother told him look we're just
[2:08:59] going to float on on on clouds and play
[2:09:01] Harps he said I didn't want to be a
[2:09:02] spirit he said I was afraid to die he
[2:09:04] said not that I had a fear I just didn't
[2:09:05] want to be a spirit I see brother
[2:09:07] Neville I want to talk to him he's a
[2:09:09] little Cloud floating p and that was his
[2:09:11] mother thing think he said the seals
[2:09:13] have come and revealed that to us opened
[2:09:14] it up in a revelation he said he went
[2:09:16] beyond the curtain time and he hugged
[2:09:17] those people he hugged those people and
[2:09:19] they were real they were real people
[2:09:21] people I like that over in Corinthians
[2:09:23] last scripture 2 Corinthians CH 5 is
[2:09:26] this all right it's all scripture right
[2:09:29] second Corinthians chapter 5 brother
[2:09:31] random says that our faith is not based
[2:09:35] on the shifting Sands of man's theology
[2:09:39] but it's based on the word of God as we
[2:09:42] get older some of us get some miles on
[2:09:44] us we want to know our faith is based in
[2:09:46] the word of God not in cliches not in
[2:09:50] men but it's based in the word of God
[2:09:52] and the road map says in 2 Corinthians
[2:09:54] chapter 5 for we know that if our
[2:09:57] Earthly House of this Tabernacle were
[2:09:59] dissolved we have a building of God a
[2:10:02] house not made with hands Eternal in the
[2:10:04] heavens and in this we groan earnestly
[2:10:07] Desiring to be clothed upon with our
[2:10:08] house which is from Heaven amen do you
[2:10:12] have that desire today say Lord there's
[2:10:13] something groaning inside of me Lord
[2:10:16] there has to be a new body there's a
[2:10:18] deep calling to the Deep Lord there has
[2:10:20] to be a place where there's no more
[2:10:21] aches there's no more pains there's no
[2:10:23] more suffering I believe in the Book of
[2:10:25] Revelation the Bible says he came and he
[2:10:27] wiped the tears from their eyes and
[2:10:28] there was no more pain there was no more
[2:10:30] sorrow there was no more fear it was all
[2:10:34] passed away former things have passed
[2:10:36] away and all things have become new it's
[2:10:39] in the road
[2:10:40] map when you take the road map and you
[2:10:42] have you know people write books life
[2:10:44] after death well Jesus Christ was one
[2:10:46] that went beyond and he came back and he
[2:10:48] tells us what happens there this is the
[2:10:50] book this is the one you need to read
[2:10:52] and let your faith rest in the word of
[2:10:54] God the Bible says if this Earthly
[2:10:56] Tabernacle be dissolved I already have
[2:10:58] one waiting I just step over into that
[2:11:01] new
[2:11:02] body oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:11:06] things that are to be I don't know why
[2:11:08] the Lord put this on my heart this
[2:11:10] message we're going through things as
[2:11:12] individuals we're going through things
[2:11:14] as a church maybe you're getting a
[2:11:16] little older in life things that are to
[2:11:18] be and when I get to that gate I don't
[2:11:20] want to back up in fear I want to be
[2:11:23] wrapped in the Robes of his
[2:11:25] righteousness not in my own
[2:11:27] righteousness but I want to know for
[2:11:29] sure Paul told it was a Peter there work
[2:11:32] out your own salvation I know it wasn't
[2:11:34] God when I sat on that Pew that gave me
[2:11:36] that I know it was God that gave me that
[2:11:37] desire to walk to that Altar and give my
[2:11:40] heart to Christ it was Christ that
[2:11:42] changed me old things passed away and
[2:11:44] All Things become new what is it Romans
[2:11:47] chapter 8 if that same spirit that
[2:11:48] raised Christ from the dead dwell in you
[2:11:50] it'll Quicken your moral mortal body do
[2:11:52] you believe that today say Lord Quicken
[2:11:55] me things that are to be I tell you one
[2:11:58] we're going to close right on this Mark
[2:12:00] 16 these are things that ought to be
[2:12:02] Jesus said in my name they'll cast out
[2:12:04] Devils those are things that will be
[2:12:07] Christians that believe in Christ
[2:12:09] they'll Cast Away evil spirits that try
[2:12:10] to influence their life you you feel
[2:12:12] them every day I do every I war with the
[2:12:15] evil spirits they're all around us he
[2:12:17] said in my name you'll cast out Devils
[2:12:19] they'll speak with new tongues they take
[2:12:20] up any serpent it shall not harm them
[2:12:22] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[2:12:24] they shall recover those are things that
[2:12:26] will happen the Believers they'll lay
[2:12:28] hands and they do you believe that you
[2:12:31] believe it if you're a Believer it's the
[2:12:33] Bible I was just thinking about that
[2:12:36] there was a sister in our
[2:12:37] church she had three heart attacks three
[2:12:40] separate ones and she was in the
[2:12:43] hospital and uh and she died three times
[2:12:47] and she they died and they were able to
[2:12:49] revive her and she pass passed again and
[2:12:51] they were able to revive her and bring
[2:12:53] her back with CPR the shock however it
[2:12:56] was and the third time she passed and
[2:12:58] they were able to bring her back but
[2:12:59] there was 18 minutes as she was as she
[2:13:02] was gone with no
[2:13:03] heartbeat and so they brought her back
[2:13:06] but they had to do medically and induced
[2:13:08] the coma because they had to put a
[2:13:09] breathing tube down her um her throat
[2:13:13] and so she could breathe and because her
[2:13:15] natural body would fight it so they had
[2:13:17] her in a a medically induced aoma so
[2:13:21] she's there she couldn't move or
[2:13:23] anything there was no response and so it
[2:13:26] was at some time I don't remember if it
[2:13:27] was a couple days or whatever it was and
[2:13:29] the doctors became very concerned
[2:13:31] because if you're 18 days without 18
[2:13:33] minutes without oxygen it causes brain
[2:13:35] damage so they said you know what we
[2:13:37] need to weer off the medication so that
[2:13:39] we can see the extent of the brain
[2:13:41] damage but there's a sister at a church
[2:13:44] that was helping her she said she called
[2:13:45] me she was so concerned she said you
[2:13:47] don't understand when people go into
[2:13:48] this and they take them all the medicine
[2:13:50] your eyes the dilation maybe we have
[2:13:52] nurses here that your eyes should dilate
[2:13:54] when you put a light in it should dilate
[2:13:55] even if you have no expression of your
[2:13:57] other um SE taste feel SM here your eyes
[2:14:00] should die and we have none of that she
[2:14:02] said it's the it has to be extensive but
[2:14:06] we begin to pray because God answers
[2:14:08] prayer he's the same yesterday today and
[2:14:10] forever they shall lay hands on the sick
[2:14:12] and they shall recover ask and it shall
[2:14:14] be anoint with oil and pray the prayer
[2:14:15] of faith and the Lord shall raise them
[2:14:17] up and the church began to pray and her
[2:14:18] husband is a prayer Warrior and and we
[2:14:20] just began to pray and and God did a
[2:14:23] miracle it was a miracle and slowly she
[2:14:25] started coming out of this aoma and
[2:14:27] every day she would get better and
[2:14:28] better and then she could move and I was
[2:14:30] in there she could just squeeze your
[2:14:31] hand and then she could hear and she
[2:14:32] could move and and slowly she began to
[2:14:34] come back and come back and we began to
[2:14:36] pray for her then they took her out and
[2:14:37] they moved her to a rehab and began to
[2:14:39] take her and then she just got better
[2:14:41] and better and they took her home the
[2:14:42] other day and pastor called her said hey
[2:14:43] how's she doing she she screamed from
[2:14:45] the background I'm doing wonderful Goden
[2:14:47] because God brings people back from the
[2:14:49] dead and he sustains their life why
[2:14:51] because these signs shall follow them
[2:14:53] that believe amen they shall cast out
[2:14:56] Devils evil spirits that's the god that
[2:14:58] we serve these things amen things that
[2:15:01] are to be that's are things that should
