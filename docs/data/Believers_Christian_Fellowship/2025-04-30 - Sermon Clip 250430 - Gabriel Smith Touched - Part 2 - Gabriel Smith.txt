TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Like no matter what somebody does to you wrong, the moment you lose that love for them, something's wrong. Amen. That's right. Amen. And I'm I'm not I I know cuz I've been there. And it's not easy. You know, we as human beings, we can only take so much punishment, right? Amen. And and sometimes life is a grind and and sometimes it gets real dark and and sometimes it gets so black you don't know which way to go. And I get it. I've been there. I know it. I know it well. But there is a place of relief. And and you don't have to stay there, but you have to make a choice. Regardless of how you feel, you have to confess God's word is right. Amen. No matter what I'm feeling, that's what the Bible says and that's exactly what I believe. There's so many times in my life, friends, I I knew I I've since I was a little boy, I always knew this message was right. And I spent decades of my life going, "That's right and I'm wrong." Amen. And I don't know how to get there. But I just kept confessing. I just kept confessing that Bible is right. This message is right. And by that confession, my body came into subjection to that word. But the moment we stop doing that, it takes honesty. It takes sincerity. It takes admitting we're wrong. Amen. And by doing that, it brings this old house of flesh subject to God's word. Praise God. Amen. And and and is it easy? Absolutely not. If it was, everybody would do it. Yes. But God is calling us to a higher level that we will we will be that invincible army. And it won't be uh AR-15s and buoy knives. It'll be it'll be this faithful little book that we'll be holding. Right. That's this right here is our protection. This right here is our artillery. This right here is our nuclear weapon.
