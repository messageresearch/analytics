[21:28] amen you can't get to be old friends
[21:31] without you know
[21:34] amen god's good let's look at exodus
[21:37] chapter 17 together
[21:41] and i'd like to take a title today
[21:44] finishing a commission
[21:46] through humility and submission
[21:48] finishing a commission
[21:50] through humility and submission
[21:54] and this this bible study surprised me a
[21:56] little bit so i'm excited to look into
[21:59] it exodus chapter 17
[22:01] verse 8. we catch the in this exodus
[22:04] journey we're here in the first exodus
[22:06] as the children of israel come out of
[22:08] the
[22:09] land of egypt they've been delivered
[22:11] they've crossed the red sea they're now
[22:13] in the wilderness journey and we find
[22:15] them here in verse 8. it says then came
[22:17] amalek and fought with israel and refed
[22:20] them and moses said unto joshua chooses
[22:23] out men and go out and fight with amalek
[22:26] tomorrow i will stand on top of the hill
[22:28] with the rod of god in my hand so joshua
[22:31] did as moses had said to him and fought
[22:33] with amalek and moses aaron and her went
[22:36] up on the top of the hill
[22:37] and it came to pass when moses held up
[22:40] his hand that israel prevailed and when
[22:41] he let down his hand amalek prevailed
[22:44] but moses's hands were heavy and they
[22:46] took a stone and put it under him and he
[22:48] sat there on and aaron and her stay
[22:51] stayed up his hands the one on the one
[22:53] side and the other on the other side and
[22:55] his hands were steady until the going
[22:57] down of the sun
[22:59] and joshua discomforted amalek and his
[23:01] people with the edge of the sword and
[23:03] the lord said unto moses write this for
[23:06] a memorial in a book and rehearse it in
[23:09] the ears of joshua for i will utterly
[23:12] put out the remembrance of amalek from
[23:14] under heaven and moses built an altar
[23:17] and called the name of it jehovah nisi
[23:19] for he said because the lord has sworn
[23:22] that the lord will have war with amalek
[23:24] from generation to generation i mean god
[23:27] bless you should take your seats
[23:31] amen so i want to look at the the
[23:34] last two or last three verses
[23:37] of this passage we we find that the
[23:39] children of israel are coming in the
[23:41] exodus journey and this is the first
[23:43] time that they're attacked in the
[23:45] journey god is leading them out he's
[23:47] moving them to the promised land and as
[23:48] they're going through the land amulet
[23:51] comes down to fight against them and we
[23:53] know god gives them a tremendous victory
[23:55] but he but he tells moses to write in a
[23:58] book verse 14
[24:00] write in a book for a memorial in a book
[24:02] and rehearse it into joshua he's going
[24:04] to rehearse it to joshua because moses
[24:07] is not going to take them into the
[24:08] promised land but joshua is amen so he
[24:12] wants to write it in the book so as
[24:14] joshua's taking him into the promised
[24:15] land he remembers what i'm getting ready
[24:18] to say he says for i will utterly put
[24:21] put out of the remembrance of amalek
[24:24] from under heaven he said i'm going to
[24:27] completely destroy amalek god took great
[24:30] offense to this attack
[24:33] they become the first enemies of israel
[24:36] and god has redeemed his people god has
[24:38] delivered him with a mighty hand god is
[24:40] taking them to his land to give it to
[24:42] them as an inheritance amen and now
[24:45] they're coming in messing with god's
[24:47] people in god's program and god's line
[24:49] of duty amen and they become symbolic as
[24:52] the eternal enemies of of israel they
[24:55] they're now symbolic as the the enemy of
[24:59] israel and god promises that i will i
[25:02] will wipe out the remembrance of amalek
[25:05] from under heaven
[25:06] and and moses built an altar and called
[25:08] the name of it jehovah nessie for he
[25:10] said because the lord has sworn that the
[25:13] lord will have war with amalek from
[25:15] generation to generation
[25:17] what god is saying i'm not going to
[25:19] forget what they did here but i will
[25:21] fight back against them from generation
[25:23] to generation until i annihilate their
[25:26] name from under heaven
[25:28] god takes offense to somebody messing
[25:30] with his people and his program led by
[25:33] his pillar of fire amen
[25:36] and so
[25:37] there's a there there's a uh let's go to
[25:40] deuteronomy 25 we picked this up in 20
[25:42] deuteronomy 25 where moses writes this
[25:45] out and then rehearses it again
[25:48] it's over in deuteronomy verse 25
[25:53] and this evening keep your bibles handy
[25:54] we're going to go to a lot of places in
[25:56] the scriptures deuteronomy 25 verse 17.
[26:02] he says remember what amalek did unto
[26:05] thee by the way when you were come forth
[26:07] out of egypt how he met thee by the way
[26:10] and smote behind most of thee even all
[26:13] that were feeble behind thee when thou
[26:15] was faint and weary and he feared not
[26:17] god
[26:18] the god it takes such offense not to
[26:21] just amulet coming down but the way he
[26:24] comes down he doesn't come and face them
[26:26] face to face but he comes and picks off
[26:28] the weak in the fee boy man he sneaks
[26:31] around to the hindmost and begins to
[26:33] attack israel in their weakness and he
[26:35] says remember what they did amen when
[26:38] they smote the hindmost of thee and all
[26:40] that were feeble behind thee when there
[26:42] was faint and weary and he feared not
[26:45] god
[26:46] therefore it shall be when the lord thy
[26:48] god hath given thee rest from all thine
[26:50] enemies round about in the land which
[26:52] the lord thy god giveth thee for an
[26:54] inheritance to possess it that thou
[26:56] shalt blot out the remembrance of amalek
[26:59] from under heaven thou shalt not forget
[27:01] it
[27:03] god says in exodus i will i will wipe
[27:07] out the remembrance of their name from
[27:09] under heaven
[27:10] now he tells joshua don't forget this
[27:13] when you go and you have peace from all
[27:15] your enemies and you're established
[27:17] don't forget this don't forget what they
[27:19] did
[27:20] amen and when you have rest round about
[27:22] from thine enemies in the land amen he
[27:26] says thou shalt blot out the remembrance
[27:28] of amalek from under heaven
[27:30] he said i'll wipe out the remembrance
[27:32] you blot out their name
[27:35] i've come down to deliver my people i'm
[27:37] sending you amen i'll wipe out their
[27:39] their name the remembrance of them from
[27:41] under heaven you blot out their name
[27:44] you see the commission was to joshua and
[27:46] to the israelites amen to fulfill what
[27:49] god had promised he would do he was
[27:52] going to fulfill it through his people
[27:54] and they were to act out what god said
[27:56] i'll do but he's going to do it but he's
[27:58] going to do it in you amen and now abra
[28:01] or moses is telling this to joshua as
[28:03] they're entering the land he says don't
[28:05] forget what amalek did don't forget the
[28:08] way he did and did not fear god and
[28:10] become an enemy to god and an enemy to
[28:12] the nation of israel don't forget it
[28:14] amen and when you have peace round about
[28:17] then you blot out the name of amalek
[28:20] you fight against them you bring this
[28:22] word to pass
[28:25] remember god has put himself in
[28:27] partnership with man
[28:30] and he says you shall not forget it so
[28:32] this is important very very important to
[28:36] god so let's pick this up in first
[28:38] samuel 15.
[28:39] this is the part that i began to look at
[28:42] in depth and i began to become surprised
[28:49] he remember he says we now have peace
[28:51] from all thine enemies round about
[28:54] when you're when you're established when
[28:55] you're set up in the land then you blot
[28:58] out the name of amalek
[29:00] so here in verse 15
[29:03] samuel was going to come and give a
[29:05] commission to saul saul was now the
[29:07] first king of israel they're now
[29:09] established as a nation they now have a
[29:11] king they now have their land so they
[29:13] come in in
[29:14] samuel chapter 15 verse 1.
[29:18] samuel also said
[29:20] unto saul
[29:21] the lord sent me to anoint thee to be
[29:23] king over his people over israel now
[29:26] therefore hearken thou unto the voice of
[29:28] the words of the lord thus saith the
[29:30] lord of host i remember that which
[29:32] amalek did to israel how he laid weight
[29:35] for him in the way when he come up from
[29:37] egypt now go and smite amalek and
[29:40] utterly destroy all that they have and
[29:43] spare them not but slay both man and
[29:46] woman infant and suckling ox and sheep
[29:50] and camel and ass
[29:52] so he's telling them make an utter
[29:54] destruction because this is what god
[29:56] said he would do and this is what he
[29:58] told joshua and the children of israel
[30:00] to do to blot out their name now they're
[30:02] established now they have a kingdom now
[30:04] they have a king so samuel the prophet
[30:07] comes to the king he says now god
[30:09] remembers what amalek did now you go
[30:12] down and utterly destroy
[30:14] all of amalek in everything that's his
[30:17] possession
[30:18] what's what's what's samuel telling saul
[30:21] to do finished the commission and
[30:23] promised that god made all the way back
[30:25] in the wilderness in exodus god made
[30:27] this promise god established it now god
[30:30] wrote it in a book he reminded joshua
[30:32] when they were coming into the land
[30:34] you're not supposed to forget this you
[30:36] blot out their name amen remember this
[30:39] and now when they have a king now the
[30:41] prophet comes and said read god
[30:43] remembers amen now you go and utterly to
[30:46] destroy
[30:48] and we know the story that that saul
[30:51] only partially fulfills the word let's
[30:53] look at it in verse 7.
[30:57] it says and saul smote the amalekites
[30:59] from havala
[31:00] until the cometh to sure that is over
[31:03] against egypt and he took agag the king
[31:05] of the amalekites alive and utterly
[31:07] destroyed all the people with the edge
[31:09] of the sword
[31:11] but saul
[31:12] okay so but saul spared agag and the
[31:16] best of the sheep and of the oxen and of
[31:18] the fatlings and of the lambs and of all
[31:20] that was good and would not utterly
[31:23] destroy them
[31:25] now saul
[31:26] amen was given a commission by samuel
[31:29] and that commission was to fulfill what
[31:31] was told to joshua which was to fulfill
[31:33] what god promised to do
[31:36] this is important to god
[31:38] but saul amen instead of acting out or
[31:42] fulfilling the full commission amen he
[31:45] stops long enough to save some spoil
[31:48] we've looked at this
[31:50] we've looked at this story many times we
[31:51] know the story of the self-will of saul
[31:54] amen but i never realized why god was so
[31:57] angry with saul amen for what saul did i
[31:59] knew it was for exerting self-will not
[32:01] for full obedience but when you see the
[32:04] promise that god had made to wipe out
[32:06] their name the remembrance he put in the
[32:08] book the commission to joshua amen
[32:11] through moses and now samuel reminding
[32:13] him amen this is something that matters
[32:15] to god this is something that's
[32:17] important to god amen god promised to do
[32:19] it and he wants to do it through you
[32:21] amen but you've got to fully obey amen
[32:24] to fulfill the full word of god and now
[32:27] partial obedience has stopped the
[32:29] promise of god
[32:31] this is why god is so angry with saul
[32:34] amen not just because saul amen we see
[32:37] david messed up amen we see all kinds of
[32:39] kings mess up and people mess up and god
[32:41] doesn't rip the kingdom from david
[32:43] because david has an affair with
[32:45] bathsheba but he rips the kingdom from
[32:47] saul because saul saves the king alive
[32:50] and he saves some sheep and oxen
[32:53] [Music]
[32:55] i mean what's worse to
[32:57] murder a man and take his i mean to
[33:00] cover up your adultery with his wife and
[33:02] murder a man or to save a few animals
[33:05] alive to make sacrifice and save one
[33:07] person
[33:10] when we start to weigh these we say why
[33:12] didn't he rip the kingdom out of david's
[33:14] hand but why did he rip the kingdom out
[33:16] of saul's hand amen because saul amen
[33:19] was failing to fulfill god's commission
[33:22] god's purpose god's word god's desire
[33:26] and god takes this serious this matters
[33:29] to god when god tells his people to do
[33:31] something there's a reason he tells his
[33:33] people to do it amen when he told moses
[33:36] i've come down to deliver my people now
[33:38] you go amen and moses started a debate
[33:43] he didn't think he was worthy he said
[33:44] who am i and god had thoroughly humbled
[33:47] moses until moses was willing to
[33:49] recognize i can't do this but then he
[33:51] begins to he begins to argue with god
[33:54] amen until god's wrath was kindled
[33:57] against moses
[33:59] he became angry with moses amen and and
[34:02] you think why he's so angry with moses
[34:05] because he can't get somebody else it
[34:07] has to be moses moses was born a proper
[34:10] child moses was born under a sign moses
[34:12] is the redeemer he's got to get moses he
[34:14] can't get anybody else to do it but this
[34:16] is his promised word a promise he made
[34:19] to abraham that must be fulfilled but
[34:21] he's got to do it through moses
[34:24] he's got to get moses to fulfill the
[34:26] commission
[34:29] you see friends there's a promise for
[34:31] our day but we've got to keep the word
[34:33] of god to fulfill god's promise amen
[34:36] there's got to be a people on the earth
[34:38] that this time around are not going to
[34:40] hang up god's promise amen you think
[34:43] well god said he's going to wipe out the
[34:45] amalekites god said he's going to
[34:47] deliver israel god did say he was going
[34:49] to do it but how is he going to do it
[34:51] he's going to do it in and through man
[34:55] he needs partnership with men he needs
[34:58] man he needs flesh that will go and make
[35:01] his promise come to pass by their
[35:04] yieldingness and surrender and humility
[35:06] to the commandment of god
[35:09] god did not need moses strength he
[35:12] didn't need moses wisdom he didn't need
[35:14] noses his connections or his politics he
[35:16] needed moses that's all he needed was
[35:18] the vessel and he supplied the rest he
[35:21] had to get a vessel who would say be it
[35:23] unto me according to your word amen he
[35:25] didn't need anything moses had he needed
[35:28] moses
[35:30] he didn't need anything that mary the
[35:33] virgin had he needed mary
[35:36] and he doesn't need anything you've got
[35:39] he just needs you amen he'll supply the
[35:41] rest if you'll just yield and surrender
[35:44] to his word
[35:45] [Music]
[35:46] this is why god is so angry with saul
[35:50] because it's his promise
[35:52] to wipe out the name of amalek
[35:55] he promised
[35:57] that he would remove the name of amalek
[35:59] from under heaven
[36:01] and now he needs salt to begin
[36:04] to utterly to destroy the amalekites
[36:09] and instead of fulfilling the commission
[36:11] to the letter he stopped short to gather
[36:14] a spoil
[36:16] look at verse 16.
[36:22] then samuel said to saul
[36:25] stay and i will tell thee what the lord
[36:27] has said to me this night and he said
[36:29] unto him say on
[36:31] and samuel said when thou was little in
[36:33] my own sight
[36:35] this is an important statement friends
[36:38] when thou was little in thine own sight
[36:43] was thou not made the head of the tribe
[36:45] of israel and the lord anointed the king
[36:47] over israel and the lord sent thee on a
[36:50] journey and said go and utterly destroy
[36:53] the sinners the amalekites and fight
[36:55] against them until they be consumed
[36:58] he says wherefore then didst thou not
[37:00] obey the voice of the lord but did fly
[37:03] upon the spoil and did evil in the sight
[37:06] of the
[37:06] lord i want you to
[37:09] just pay close attention to the language
[37:11] because this is going to become
[37:12] important later we're going to see this
[37:14] again
[37:16] he said
[37:17] when you were little in your own sight
[37:20] when you were humble
[37:22] when you were so bashful at the day of
[37:24] your presentation to israel you hid
[37:27] behind the stuff amen because you were
[37:29] so shy and bashful to be presented to
[37:31] the people that's when god chose you
[37:35] and he's re
[37:37] there's an inference in the language
[37:39] he's inferring remember brother branham
[37:41] said that god condenses his truths
[37:45] he's inferring that that's the way you
[37:48] were supposed to be he's reminding him
[37:51] of what what you were when god chose you
[37:54] you were little in your own side god
[37:56] didn't say you were nothing amen amen i
[38:00] mean that's obvious without god we're
[38:01] all nothing but he reminds him you were
[38:04] nothing in your own sight
[38:08] that was the original condition that's
[38:10] when god could call you that's when god
[38:12] could take you when you were little in
[38:14] your own sight and obviously now he was
[38:17] not little in his own side he had become
[38:19] so puffed up that he thought that he
[38:21] could change the order of the word of
[38:23] god and it would be all right
[38:27] he got so lifted up in pride and he got
[38:30] so full of himself amen that he thought
[38:33] that he could tamper with the
[38:35] commandment from a prophet
[38:38] and that it would be okay with god
[38:40] because he was chosen he was called he
[38:43] was anointed he was the king of israel
[38:47] he was a goodly man he was powerful he
[38:49] was head and shoulders above the rest
[38:51] amen he had just had a great victory
[38:53] amen it surely it'll be all right if we
[38:56] save a few of these sheep and make a
[38:58] sacrifice surely we can save ag as a
[39:01] trophy
[39:04] surely where have we heard shirley
[39:05] before
[39:08] say if anybody ever introduces you to
[39:10] that woman surely run away
[39:14] not shirley ping she's good
[39:18] surely when somebody starts introducing
[39:20] you to shirley turn coat and run amen
[39:25] when now was little in own in thine own
[39:28] sight
[39:29] was thou not made head
[39:31] of the tribes of israel
[39:36] brother branham says in the message
[39:37] influence he's speaking of the the holy
[39:40] cherubims that are around the throne of
[39:41] god he said see the one over his feet he
[39:44] covered his feet with his wings
[39:46] covered his face
[39:48] and with two wings he was in action
[39:50] he said the one over his feet covered
[39:52] humility watch this servant now before
[39:54] god his face covered in reverence his
[39:57] feet covered in humility yes and very
[39:59] conscious be very conscious of your
[40:01] littleness
[40:04] that's where saul should have stayed
[40:07] be very conscious of your littleness all
[40:10] of us is trying to be some big somebody
[40:13] i'm dr so-and-so and great so-and-so of
[40:15] so-and-so you're nothing
[40:18] that's right you're nothing if you want
[40:19] to know how great you are put your
[40:21] finger in a pool of water and pull it
[40:22] out and find the hole where you put it
[40:24] in there is nothing there and that's
[40:26] what we are god can do without us but we
[40:29] can't do without him who are you see
[40:33] being conscious of how little you are
[40:35] the way up is down
[40:37] he that humbles himself shall be exalted
[40:39] he that exalts himself shall be abased
[40:42] this is a principle we find in the
[40:44] entire scripture
[40:46] he comes to the message humble himself
[40:48] he says you know people want power and
[40:50] really they don't know what power is
[40:53] they don't really know what goes with it
[40:55] the way up is down always if you want
[40:58] power see how humble you can get just
[41:00] get away from all your worldly thinking
[41:02] and humble yourself before god and then
[41:04] you've got more power than the man that
[41:06] runs all over the building and makes a
[41:08] big lot of noise see because you have
[41:10] been able to conquer yourself
[41:13] and commit yourself to christ you see to
[41:16] humble yourself before him before him
[41:19] that's really power
[41:22] so what's really power real power is not
[41:25] demonstrations of gifts that's not power
[41:28] real power is being able to conquer
[41:30] yourself and bring yourself subject to
[41:33] christ the word
[41:34] that's real power amen that's what amen
[41:37] the denominations can't do that's what
[41:39] the world over humanity cannot do they
[41:42] cannot conquer self they cannot bring
[41:45] this self-willed self-desiring lustful
[41:48] flesh and subject it to the word of god
[41:51] and humble submission
[41:53] but real power that's what real power is
[41:59] you see me you show me a church that's
[42:01] humble real humble
[42:04] not an arrogancy a church just a sweet
[42:07] humble church i'll show you a church
[42:09] that has the favor and power of god in
[42:11] it
[42:14] now let me read read a little further
[42:18] that's the thing it takes humility
[42:21] humbling ourselves before god letting
[42:23] god just work through us
[42:25] don't have to make a lot of noise
[42:28] now
[42:29] he says it doesn't have to make a lot of
[42:30] noise it can make a lot of noise there's
[42:32] nothing wrong with noise noise isn't the
[42:33] problem
[42:35] decibel levels i like a little noise
[42:37] it's nice to hear people say amen
[42:39] shout and praise god for the word amen i
[42:41] like it it's not the level of noise
[42:43] noise doesn't get us anywhere and noise
[42:45] is an indication amen the the power in
[42:48] the church is the ability to humble
[42:50] themselves to the word of god
[42:52] humility to the word of god whether it's
[42:55] loud or quiet the decibel levels don't
[42:56] matter right the decibel leverage is
[42:58] just the response of the people who's in
[43:00] the room amen
[43:02] but the human real humility is humbling
[43:04] ourselves before god
[43:07] and just letting god work through us
[43:11] let's look at verse 27 back in samuel 15
[43:14] verse 7 15
[43:16] verse 27
[43:19] and as saul turned about to go away
[43:22] he laid hold upon the skirt of his
[43:24] mantle and rent it this is uh a saul
[43:27] grabbed a hold of samuel
[43:29] and read it in verse 28 and samuel said
[43:32] unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom
[43:34] of israel from thee this day
[43:36] and hath given it to a neighbor of thine
[43:39] that is better than thou
[43:43] all right
[43:44] he's going to give it to somebody that's
[43:46] better than him
[43:48] so what does it mean to be better than
[43:51] saul
[43:53] is he gonna have to find somebody taller
[43:55] bigger stronger nope he was the
[43:56] strongest the best fighter head and
[43:59] shoulders above he was a goodly man and
[44:02] he was he was out of a a he was a
[44:04] powerful his father was powerful
[44:07] so how's he going to find a neighbor
[44:09] that's better than you amen we know the
[44:11] neighbor is going to be the little
[44:13] shepherd boy amen the one that's better
[44:15] than you is not going to be taller more
[44:17] powerful better at fighting the one
[44:19] that's going to be better than you is
[44:21] the lad tending his father sheep
[44:23] carrying a harp singing songs
[44:27] he's not better amen by appearance he's
[44:30] not better by power he's not better by
[44:33] natural abilities he's better because
[44:36] he's humble before gone
[44:38] he's still little in his own side
[44:41] amen so there's a couple phrases out of
[44:45] this passage that i want you to hold on
[44:47] to
[44:49] one is that he flew upon the spoil
[44:52] he flew upon the spoil and god was so
[44:55] angry with him
[44:56] that he flew upon the spoil and got
[44:58] distracted from the commission to
[45:00] utterly destroy why didn't you utterly
[45:02] destroy but flew upon
[45:05] the spoil so he got distracted with a
[45:07] reward
[45:09] got distracted
[45:10] with the spoil and didn't finish the
[45:13] commission to utterly destroy
[45:16] and uh i want you to remember that when
[45:18] he was little in his sight
[45:20] he called him and then the last thing
[45:23] is that
[45:24] uh he's going to find and i want to get
[45:26] the exact word in here
[45:28] out of verse 28
[45:30] he's going to find somebody that is
[45:31] better than thou
[45:33] better than now these phrases are going
[45:36] to come back in a very interesting
[45:38] interesting way
[45:39] let's go back one chapter or two
[45:41] chapters here to first samuel 13
[45:44] and verse 11. and we're going to find a
[45:46] uh
[45:47] uh an uh correction that samuel brings
[45:50] to saul when he failed before to fully
[45:54] obey he didn't wait for samuel to come
[45:56] before he offered a sacrifice he offered
[45:58] a sacrifice before samuel showed up
[46:00] contrary to samuel's instructions and
[46:02] here's what samuel says in the
[46:03] correction
[46:04] samuel 13 verse 11 and samuel said what
[46:07] hast thou done and saul said because i
[46:09] saw that the people were scattered from
[46:11] me and that thou cometh not within the
[46:13] days appointed that the philistines
[46:15] gathered themselves together at
[46:17] mitchmash therefore said i the
[46:19] philistines will come down now upon me
[46:22] to gilgal and i have not made
[46:24] supplication unto the lord i forced
[46:26] myself therefore and offered a burnt
[46:28] offering
[46:29] and samuel said to saul thou has done
[46:32] foolishly thou has not kept the
[46:34] commandment of the lord thy god which he
[46:36] commanded thee for now would the lord
[46:39] have established thy kingdom upon israel
[46:41] forever but now thy kingdom shall not
[46:44] continue the lord has sought him a man
[46:47] after his own heart
[46:49] and the lord hath commanded him to be
[46:51] captain over the people because thou has
[46:53] not kept that which the lord commanded
[46:55] thee
[46:58] god would have established his kingdom
[47:00] forever if he would have just obeyed
[47:03] everything god told him to do
[47:06] that's all he had to do all he had to do
[47:08] was obey everything the lord told him
[47:11] and his kingdom would have been
[47:12] established but now there's a prophecy
[47:14] that your kingdom will not be
[47:15] established but he'll anoint another
[47:17] captain then when he failed to fully
[47:20] uh destroy utterly destroy the
[47:22] amalekites and flew upon the spoil and
[47:25] and saved ag alive now is the time that
[47:28] he rent the kingdom out of his hands
[47:31] and gave it to one that's better than
[47:33] him
[47:34] better than him
[47:36] a man after god's own heart
[47:39] better than him a man after god's own
[47:42] heart
[47:44] hold your place in first samuel and turn
[47:46] with me to acts 13.
[47:52] what does it mean to be better than saul
[47:55] and to be a man after god's own heart
[47:58] acts 13 holds the answer
[48:02] acts chapter 13.
[48:06] 21
[48:10] acts chapter 13 verse 21 and afterward
[48:13] they desired a king and god gave unto
[48:15] them saul the son of kish
[48:17] a man of the tribe of benjamin by the
[48:19] space of forty years
[48:20] and when he had removed him he raised up
[48:22] unto them david to be their king to whom
[48:24] also he gave testimony and said i have
[48:26] found david the son of jesse a man after
[48:29] mine own heart which shall fulfill all
[48:32] my will
[48:35] what does it mean to be a man after
[48:36] god's own heart to fulfill all his will
[48:41] what made him a better man than saul
[48:44] that he would do all god's will
[48:47] better man
[48:48] and more moral we never have a story
[48:50] where saul committed adultery and
[48:52] murdered
[48:54] one of his own men
[48:56] to cover it up
[48:57] but he's better not morally he's not
[49:00] better and strength and power he's not
[49:03] better in his ability with armor and
[49:04] sword he's better because he'll just
[49:07] obey god amen and when he makes a
[49:09] mistake he'll repent amen he'll repent
[49:12] and lay before the lord and expose it
[49:14] and
[49:14] and be free from it amen but saul is
[49:17] constantly elevating himself over the
[49:20] word of god and david is continually
[49:22] placing himself under the word of god
[49:25] this made him a man after god's own
[49:27] heart that would do all his will who was
[49:29] a better man better
[49:31] than
[49:32] saul
[49:34] let's go back to first samuel 15.
[49:40] verse 7 15 and 32.
[49:48] then said samuel bring ye hither to me
[49:50] agag the king of amalekites and agag
[49:53] came unto him delicately and ag said
[49:55] surely the bitterness of death is past
[49:58] and samuel said as thy sword hath made
[50:00] women childless shall saw thy mother be
[50:02] childless among women and samuel hewed a
[50:04] gag in pieces before the lord and gilgal
[50:07] then samuel went to rhema and saul went
[50:09] up to the to his house to gibba
[50:12] gibia of saul and samuel came no more to
[50:15] see saul until the day of his death
[50:17] nevertheless samuel mourned for saul and
[50:19] the lord repented that he had made saul
[50:21] king over israel
[50:23] here we have
[50:24] samuel doing what saul failed to do and
[50:27] kill agag
[50:29] but saul we know saul failed to utterly
[50:32] destroy the malachites because if we go
[50:34] to first samuel chapter 30. let's go
[50:36] there quickly first samuel chapter 30
[50:38] just a few chapters over
[50:42] first james chapter 30 is a story of the
[50:44] amalekites coming and raiding david's
[50:46] camp and taking away the wives and the
[50:48] women and the goods and it says i'll
[50:51] just pick up one verse in verse 18. and
[50:53] david recovered all that the amalekites
[50:55] had carried away and david rescued his
[50:57] two wives so here we know that all the
[51:00] amalekites are not dead amen he wiped
[51:02] out the amalekites in that region from
[51:05] havala to this he wiped them out he
[51:07] saved ag alive but then samuel killed a
[51:10] gag but there's still a malachite
[51:11] somewhere amen he was supposed to
[51:13] continually fight till he utterly
[51:16] destroyed but he stopped to fly upon the
[51:18] spoil
[51:19] and now there's still amalekites out
[51:22] there in other regions amen that have
[51:24] not been destroyed and now david is
[51:26] fighting with the amalekites so we know
[51:29] that the amalekites continued on because
[51:32] saul did not fulfill his commission
[51:35] and they become an enemy
[51:37] an enemy to israel
[51:40] now i want to pick up this story in a
[51:41] strange place
[51:43] i want to pick it up in esther
[51:45] so if you'll go with me to the book of
[51:46] esther
[51:54] what i became stunned with and what i
[51:56] became shocked in
[51:58] is the parallel between the story of
[52:00] esther
[52:02] and first samuel 15.
[52:05] i i begin to actually begin to be
[52:07] shocked and be stunned at the parallels
[52:09] between the story of saul the commission
[52:12] and the failure amen and and then the
[52:15] story of esther and mordecai and the
[52:17] similarities begin to become striking to
[52:20] me and so i want to go through some of
[52:21] those esther chapter 1 verse 10.
[52:27] on the seventh day when the heart of the
[52:29] king was merry with wine he commanded
[52:31] muhuman and bisthan harbanan big sun
[52:35] bags the zether and carcass the seven
[52:38] chamberlains that served in the presence
[52:40] of alhazarus the king to bring vashti
[52:42] the queen before the king with the crown
[52:44] royal to show the people and the princes
[52:46] her beauty for she was fair to look on
[52:50] but the queen vashti refused to come at
[52:52] the king's commandment by his
[52:54] chamberlains therefore was the king very
[52:56] roth and his anger burned in him then
[52:58] the king said to the wise men which knew
[53:00] the times for so the king answered
[53:02] toward all men that judges the law and
[53:04] i'm not going to continue reading i'll
[53:05] stop right there but he begins to ask
[53:08] them what they should do and they said
[53:09] put her away amen for she's disobeyed
[53:11] the word of the king and she'll set an
[53:13] example for all the other women amen
[53:16] that won't be subject to their husbands
[53:17] so put her away and he puts her away
[53:20] amen he he puts her away and banishes
[53:22] her from the kingdom and then they give
[53:24] him instruction to find another virgin
[53:26] amen to replace her and i want to look
[53:28] at this commandment here or this this
[53:30] suggestion in verse 19
[53:33] said if it please the king let there go
[53:36] a royal commandment from him and let it
[53:38] be written among the laws of the
[53:40] persians and the medes that it be not
[53:42] altered that vashti come no no more
[53:45] before the king azaris and let the king
[53:47] give her royal estate and to another
[53:49] that is better than she
[53:54] we heard that before didn't we he was
[53:56] going to rim the kingdom from saul and
[53:58] give it to one that's better than thou
[54:00] and now he's rending the crown from
[54:03] vashti and he's going to find a another
[54:06] wife that's better than she
[54:09] and what was wrong with vasti vashti was
[54:12] beautiful vasti was a queen vastly was
[54:14] in the king's court vashti refused to
[54:17] obey the the word of the king
[54:19] now they want to find one that's better
[54:21] than she amen she was already beautiful
[54:24] i don't know that they're going to be
[54:25] able to find one that's more beautiful
[54:27] because she was beautiful and fair to
[54:29] look upon amen but they got to find one
[54:31] that's better than she what would be
[54:33] better amen the most beautiful would
[54:35] probably be equal to her in beauty but
[54:37] this new one has to surpass her and be
[54:39] better than her not in beauty amen not
[54:42] and
[54:43] and royal dress the king can provide all
[54:45] of that but one that's got to be better
[54:47] has got to be one that'll obey
[54:49] everything the king says
[54:55] now hold your place in esther
[54:58] and slip back to first samuel with me
[55:03] first samuel chapter 9.
[55:06] remember the similarities are striking
[55:11] first samuel chapter nine
[55:14] verse one
[55:18] first samuel chapter 9 verse 1.
[55:20] now there was a man of benjamin whose
[55:23] name was kish the son of abio the son of
[55:25] zeror the son of bacharath the son of
[55:28] aphea a benjamite a mighty man of power
[55:32] he had a son whose name was saul a
[55:34] choice young man and a goodly and there
[55:36] was not among the children of israel a
[55:38] goodlier person than he from his
[55:40] shoulders and upward he was higher than
[55:41] any of the people
[55:43] so this is where
[55:45] saul comes from
[55:46] he comes he's a benjamite his father's
[55:49] name is kish
[55:50] he's a man of power mighty man of power
[55:53] and and saul is goodly above all of the
[55:57] others in israel let's go back to esther
[55:59] now
[56:01] let's go look at esther chapter 2 verse
[56:03] 5.
[56:07] now in shushan the palace
[56:10] there was a certain jew whose name was
[56:12] mordecai
[56:13] the son of jared the son of shemii the
[56:16] son of
[56:18] kish
[56:20] a benjamite
[56:22] he's in the same line as saul
[56:26] in the same family as saul
[56:29] let's keep reading
[56:30] who had been carried away from jerusalem
[56:32] with captivity which he had been carried
[56:34] away
[56:35] with joconia king of judah
[56:38] who whom nebuchadnezzar the king of
[56:40] babylon had carried away and he brought
[56:42] up hadassah that is esther
[56:46] so hadassah is her original jewish name
[56:49] which means myrtle tree your name's
[56:51] changed to esther which means star so
[56:53] hadassah is going to have to go through
[56:55] a change amen to become this queen and
[56:57] she's going to have to go through a name
[56:59] change to become this queen she's going
[57:01] to have to go from being church to bride
[57:03] to make this transition
[57:05] so she brought up from what so he
[57:07] brought up hadassah that is esther
[57:10] his uncle's daughter
[57:14] so his uncle's daughter is his father's
[57:17] brother
[57:20] got that squared away i didn't lose
[57:22] anybody
[57:23] his uncle's
[57:25] daughter would be his cousin his first
[57:27] cousin
[57:29] his uncle's daughter is his father's
[57:31] brother
[57:33] which makes hadassah who will be esther
[57:37] in the lineage of benjamin through kish
[57:40] right in the line of saul
[57:43] the same bloodline
[57:46] remember the title
[57:48] finishing the commission through
[57:49] humility and surrender
[57:52] saul failed
[57:53] by taking his own idea
[57:56] but god in esther is going to finish the
[57:58] commission he laid out an exodus in the
[58:00] promise but he's going to do it through
[58:02] humility and surrender
[58:07] amen
[58:08] so let's keep reading
[58:10] so he brought up hadassah that is esther
[58:13] his uncle's daughter
[58:16] for she had neither father nor mother
[58:18] and the maid was fair and beautiful who
[58:21] mordecai when her father and mother were
[58:23] dead took her for his own daughter
[58:26] amen let's go down to verse 12.
[58:29] i just want to look at
[58:31] before we read verse 12 we know the
[58:33] story really well so i can just hit the
[58:34] highlights we know esther's now taken in
[58:37] they're searching the whole kingdom for
[58:39] fair young virgins to take in amen to
[58:41] purify to take him before the king
[58:43] whichever one the king chooses and names
[58:45] by name will become the replacement for
[58:47] vashti and he's looking for one that's
[58:49] better than she amen she failed by
[58:52] disobeying the king so there's got to be
[58:54] one who's going to be better than she
[58:56] now they come into the through the the
[58:59] house amen of the virgins they come into
[59:01] the house of the women and haggai the
[59:04] chamberlain is going to be the keeper of
[59:05] the women and he's in charge of the
[59:07] purification and getting the women ready
[59:09] to move on amen and we've preached this
[59:12] before we typed haggai with the prophet
[59:14] of god on this day amen who's here to
[59:15] dress a bride amen he's here to clothe
[59:18] the bride in the word amen and prepare
[59:20] her for the meeting so now let's look at
[59:23] this in verse 12. i just want to hit a
[59:24] few points
[59:26] now when every maid's turn was come to
[59:29] go into king azaris after that she had
[59:31] been 12 months according to the manner
[59:33] of women for so were the days of their
[59:35] purification accomplished to wit six
[59:38] months with oil of myrrh and six months
[59:40] with sweet odors and with other things
[59:43] for the purifying of the women
[59:46] i want to look at this the the this six
[59:49] months
[59:50] with oil of myrrh in six months with
[59:52] sweet odors
[59:54] she went
[59:55] she was taken from her home she was
[59:57] hadassah she had a certain identity she
[1:00:00] was a jewish she was hadassah she was
[1:00:02] going to be taken into the group of
[1:00:04] women to be presented to the king under
[1:00:06] the care of haggai and through this she
[1:00:08] goes through a purification process and
[1:00:10] and here's what brother branham said
[1:00:12] remember it was first six months with
[1:00:14] myrrh
[1:00:15] i want to read to you out of matthew 26
[1:00:18] 6. you don't determine there but out of
[1:00:19] matthew chapter 26 verse 6.
[1:00:21] now when jesus was in bethany in the
[1:00:23] house of simon the leper there came unto
[1:00:26] him a woman having an alabaster box of
[1:00:28] very precious ointment and poured it on
[1:00:30] his head as he sat at me
[1:00:32] but when his disciples saw it they had
[1:00:34] indignation saying to what purpose is
[1:00:36] this waste for this ointment might have
[1:00:38] been sold for much and given to poor
[1:00:40] when jesus understood it he said unto
[1:00:42] them why trouble you the woman for she
[1:00:44] hath brought a good work upon me for for
[1:00:47] yea for yea
[1:00:49] for ye have the poor always with you but
[1:00:52] me you have not always for in that she
[1:00:54] hath poured the ointment on my body she
[1:00:56] did it for my burial
[1:01:00] she did it for my burial verily i say
[1:01:03] unto you whos wheresoever this gospel
[1:01:05] shall be preached in the whole world
[1:01:06] there shall also this this that this
[1:01:08] woman have done be told for a memorial
[1:01:11] of her
[1:01:12] brother branham picks this up in
[1:01:13] december of 1963 and god's gifts always
[1:01:16] find their place he said now myrrh
[1:01:20] myrrh was anointing of the death
[1:01:24] and jesus says this anointing always
[1:01:25] poured on me she anointed me from my
[1:01:27] burial from my death and brother bam
[1:01:30] says myrrh was anointing of the death we
[1:01:32] find in saint john the 19th chapter the
[1:01:35] 39th verse that going to the funeral
[1:01:37] service of jesus
[1:01:38] when mary and them went they'd taken
[1:01:40] this myrrh to anoint him with because he
[1:01:42] must be the servant of death for jehovah
[1:01:45] somebody had to die that was a service
[1:01:48] that had to be done for god and nobody
[1:01:50] was worthy to do it but god himself so
[1:01:52] bring the myrrh showing that with the
[1:01:54] deity and with the service that he also
[1:01:57] was anointed with myrrh that this deity
[1:01:59] had to put to death in order to save the
[1:02:01] imperfect one
[1:02:03] so he shows us that the anointing of
[1:02:05] myrrh is an anointing to death
[1:02:08] it's an anointing to a burial with the
[1:02:11] anointing of myrrh and and we we have
[1:02:13] this in john 19 hold your place in
[1:02:15] esther and jump with me to john 19 which
[1:02:18] is the scripture that brother branham is
[1:02:19] referring to
[1:02:21] the gospel of john chapter 19
[1:02:26] verse 38 we're going to read a passage
[1:02:27] out of here and a passage out of mark
[1:02:31] john chapter 19 verse 38
[1:02:38] and after this joseph of arimathea being
[1:02:40] a disciple of jesus but secretly for
[1:02:42] fear of the jews besot pilate that he
[1:02:44] might take away the body of jesus and
[1:02:47] pilate gave him leave he came therefore
[1:02:49] and took the body of jesus and there
[1:02:51] came also nicodemus which at the first
[1:02:53] came to jesus by night and brought a
[1:02:55] mixture of myrrh and aloes about a
[1:02:57] hundred pound weight then took they the
[1:02:59] body of jesus and wound it and lin and
[1:03:01] clothes with the spices at the manner of
[1:03:04] the jews to bury this is the scripture
[1:03:06] brother bran is referring to when he
[1:03:08] says myrrh is an anointing to death
[1:03:11] myrrh is an anointing for burial let's
[1:03:14] look at mark chapter 16.
[1:03:27] mark chapter 16.
[1:03:30] verse 1.
[1:03:34] mark 16-1 and when the sabbath was
[1:03:36] passed
[1:03:37] mary magdalene and mary the mother of
[1:03:39] james and solomay had brought sweet
[1:03:41] spices that they might come and anoint
[1:03:44] him
[1:03:45] very early in the morning on the first
[1:03:46] day of the week they came into the
[1:03:47] sepulchre at the rising of the sun
[1:03:50] so here this word sweet spices is
[1:03:53] actually the word aroma in the greek
[1:03:56] aroma sweet spices a perfume a fragrance
[1:03:59] amen it has a counterpart in the old
[1:04:01] testament the counterpart in the old
[1:04:03] testament
[1:04:04] is a word that that means
[1:04:07] it's a word called bessem which means
[1:04:10] perfume sweet sweet smell sweet odor and
[1:04:13] that was the spice and the mixture
[1:04:15] spices that was pointing to the
[1:04:17] anointing oil that anointed aaron when
[1:04:20] he went into the holy of holies
[1:04:22] so the sweet spices amen were mixed with
[1:04:24] the anointing oil and he was anointed
[1:04:26] with the sweet spices to go into the
[1:04:28] holy of holies but the anointing of
[1:04:30] myrrh was for the anointing of death
[1:04:32] according to what the prophet taught us
[1:04:33] and according to the scriptures
[1:04:35] and and
[1:04:37] i just want to uh look at this again in
[1:04:41] esther chapter two
[1:04:44] esther chapter two
[1:04:46] verse twelve
[1:04:47] now when
[1:04:48] oh not twelve
[1:04:51] yeah
[1:04:52] now when every mate's turn was to come
[1:04:55] to go into king azaris after she had
[1:04:57] been 12 months according to the man or
[1:04:59] women for so were the days of their
[1:05:01] purification accomplished to it six
[1:05:03] months with oil of myrrh and six months
[1:05:06] with sweet odors and with other things
[1:05:07] for purifying of the women
[1:05:10] hadassah
[1:05:11] in order to come to the king
[1:05:13] has to go through death
[1:05:16] she has to be anointed with the
[1:05:18] anointing of death
[1:05:19] six months with the anointing of myrrh
[1:05:21] which is anointing for burial which is
[1:05:23] anointing of death and she's got to die
[1:05:26] to hadassah to become esther
[1:05:29] she's got to die to her thinking she's
[1:05:31] got to die to her own ideas she's got to
[1:05:33] go through a time of purification that
[1:05:36] has the anointing of death upon it and
[1:05:38] then she moves out of death into another
[1:05:41] anointing and this is the anointing of
[1:05:43] sweet aroma or sweet spices which is the
[1:05:46] same word that's used in the mixture for
[1:05:48] the high priest because now she's going
[1:05:50] into the inner chamber behind the veil
[1:05:53] to meet the king and become one with the
[1:05:54] king so first she passes through the
[1:05:57] anointing of death then she passes
[1:05:59] through the anointing of sweet aroma
[1:06:01] amen so that she could enter in behind
[1:06:03] the inner chamber
[1:06:05] this is the same path we have to take we
[1:06:07] have to come through the anointing of
[1:06:09] death with the anointing of murder to
[1:06:11] completely die to self amen to give up
[1:06:14] all our ideas and give up all our past
[1:06:16] traditions and give up all of our
[1:06:18] thoughts and die out completely under
[1:06:20] anointing of death and the house of the
[1:06:22] women under the care of haggai the
[1:06:24] prophet for this age
[1:06:27] and then let there come an anointing
[1:06:29] amen another anointing amen like was
[1:06:32] upon the high priest to go enter into
[1:06:34] the holy of holies and become one with
[1:06:36] the king amen
[1:06:39] praise be to god
[1:06:42] let's go on and read a little bit
[1:06:43] further now
[1:06:46] then thus came every maintenance of the
[1:06:48] king whatsoever she desired
[1:06:51] this is so beautiful
[1:06:54] then thus came every maintenance to the
[1:06:56] king whatsoever she desired was given
[1:06:59] her
[1:07:00] to go with her out of the house of the
[1:07:01] women into the king's house
[1:07:04] whatsoever she desired
[1:07:07] this is the one place
[1:07:09] haggai had ordered their care had
[1:07:12] ordered their ritual baths their
[1:07:14] purifications their anointings the oil
[1:07:16] haggai hadn't got the right mixture in
[1:07:18] the right time and the right amount of
[1:07:20] six months of this and six months of
[1:07:21] that he got everything the way the king
[1:07:24] wanted it laid it out got the women
[1:07:26] purified had cared for them whatever
[1:07:28] they were supposed to have he took care
[1:07:29] of it but this is the one place he says
[1:07:32] you can have whatever you want
[1:07:35] and your choice will dictate what's in
[1:07:37] your heart
[1:07:40] god has never taken away free choice
[1:07:42] he's never taken away free moral agency
[1:07:45] even when at the in the exodus they come
[1:07:47] into the promised land god brought him
[1:07:49] out with a mighty hand he took him all
[1:07:51] the way through the wilderness journey
[1:07:52] with signs and miracles and wonders he
[1:07:54] brought him into the promised land and
[1:07:56] they're his he redeemed them he paid for
[1:07:58] them and he's bringing them into his
[1:08:01] land that he's giving to them he did it
[1:08:03] all and now he comes and joshua says
[1:08:05] amen choose you this day
[1:08:09] you think god god paid for them god
[1:08:11] redeemed them god cared for them god
[1:08:13] delivered them god fought for them god
[1:08:16] carried them through the red sea god
[1:08:17] carried them across jordan god did
[1:08:19] everything for them you would think god
[1:08:21] says you're mine
[1:08:22] do what i say and no he says choose you
[1:08:25] this day
[1:08:27] whom you will serve
[1:08:30] but as for me in my house
[1:08:32] we will serve the lord
[1:08:34] god never takes away free choice because
[1:08:37] your ability to choose indicates what's
[1:08:39] laying in your heart
[1:08:44] then when it came every maiden
[1:08:47] came time for them to go into the king
[1:08:49] whatsoever she desired who has given her
[1:08:50] to go with her out of the house of the
[1:08:52] women into the king's house
[1:08:55] verse 14. in the evening she went and on
[1:08:58] the morrow she returned into the second
[1:09:00] house of the women to the custody of
[1:09:02] shashkaz the king's chamberlain which
[1:09:04] kept the concubines she came in unto the
[1:09:06] king no more except the king delighted
[1:09:08] in her and that she recalled by name
[1:09:11] now when the turn of esther the daughter
[1:09:13] of abigail the uncle of mordecai who had
[1:09:16] taken her for his daughter was come to
[1:09:18] go into the king she required nothing
[1:09:25] but what haggai the king's chamberlain
[1:09:27] the keeper of the women
[1:09:29] appointed
[1:09:33] when it was her turn to go each of these
[1:09:35] virgins
[1:09:36] they had all went through a purification
[1:09:38] process they had all gone through the
[1:09:40] house of the women that had all gone
[1:09:41] through the hair care of haggy eye
[1:09:44] but he says when you go into the king
[1:09:46] you can go according to your desire
[1:09:49] you can choose whatever you want to take
[1:09:52] until it came to esther remember he's
[1:09:54] looking for one that's better than
[1:09:56] vashti
[1:09:59] he wants one better than
[1:10:00] vashti and when it was esther's turn
[1:10:04] she required or asked for or wanted
[1:10:06] nothing but what haggy i had appointed
[1:10:09] there's another thing that i found
[1:10:11] amazing when i looked at the search the
[1:10:14] word appointed in the concordance it
[1:10:16] came out the word almar
[1:10:18] in hebrew
[1:10:20] and it says to say
[1:10:22] to speak
[1:10:24] to utter
[1:10:26] so when it says that she required
[1:10:28] nothing only what haggai appointed it
[1:10:31] really means she required nothing only
[1:10:33] what haggai said
[1:10:35] only what haggai spoke amen she doesn't
[1:10:38] need her own doctrine she doesn't need
[1:10:40] her own idea she only needs what's
[1:10:42] laying on those tapes amen what the what
[1:10:43] was spoke by haggai is all that she
[1:10:46] required amen i don't want my own idea i
[1:10:49] don't want my own thought from the house
[1:10:50] of the women i want to pass through that
[1:10:52] purification i want to go into the holy
[1:10:54] of holies and i'm going to go in the way
[1:10:57] haggai said amen the way he spoke
[1:11:02] praise be to god
[1:11:04] amen he's looking for one
[1:11:07] that's better than vashti
[1:11:10] god was looking for one that was better
[1:11:12] than saul
[1:11:15] okay
[1:11:16] now let's keep reading
[1:11:20] she required nothing but what had he had
[1:11:21] the king's chamberlain the keeper the
[1:11:23] woman appointed and esther attained
[1:11:25] favor in the sight of all them that
[1:11:27] looked upon there
[1:11:28] so esther was taken into the king as
[1:11:31] azaris and to his house royal in the
[1:11:33] tenth month which is the month tibith in
[1:11:36] the seventh year of his reign
[1:11:39] 10 7
[1:11:41] revelation 10 7.
[1:11:44] amen
[1:11:46] 10 and 7 makes 17 17 is the number of
[1:11:49] victory in the bible
[1:11:51] she went in on 10-7
[1:11:53] and esther's the 17th book of the bible
[1:11:56] [Laughter]
[1:11:58] this is how israel gets victory
[1:12:01] this is a book of victory
[1:12:04] this is victory over the amalekites this
[1:12:05] is victory over amen the fulfillment of
[1:12:08] the commission the fulfillment of the
[1:12:09] word victory how is how are we going to
[1:12:12] get victory through this humble little
[1:12:14] woman that is only going to do what
[1:12:15] haggai said
[1:12:17] praise be to god
[1:12:20] verse 17 and the king loved esther above
[1:12:24] all the women
[1:12:26] and she obtained grace and favor in his
[1:12:27] sight more than all the virgins so that
[1:12:29] he set the royal crown upon her head and
[1:12:31] made her queen instead of vashti when he
[1:12:34] saw her come she came from death unto
[1:12:38] the anointing to go into the holy of
[1:12:40] holies and she took with her none of her
[1:12:43] own idea none of her own thoughts none
[1:12:45] of the influence of all the other women
[1:12:47] she only went according to the way
[1:12:49] haggai had said what he appointed what
[1:12:52] he spoke and when she showed up
[1:12:54] everybody in the king's house showed her
[1:12:56] favor
[1:12:58] because those in the king house knows
[1:12:59] the king's mind
[1:13:01] and when the king saw her he loved her
[1:13:03] above all the all the women and he chose
[1:13:05] her over vastly he had found one that
[1:13:08] was better than vashti because this one
[1:13:11] came according amen to the way haggy i
[1:13:13] said come and she didn't take anything
[1:13:16] of her own she did it exactly the way it
[1:13:18] was spoke
[1:13:20] so that's the way i want to approach god
[1:13:22] not coming with my own little tradition
[1:13:24] and my own little doctrine and
[1:13:25] manipulating what the prophet said and
[1:13:27] that was his idea i just want to come
[1:13:29] the way he pointed amen the way it was
[1:13:31] spoke i don't want to require anything
[1:13:33] else i just want to come that way after
[1:13:35] i've passed through death after i've got
[1:13:37] a name change after i went from an
[1:13:39] earthbound myrtle and to a star amen one
[1:13:42] of the seed of abraham passing through
[1:13:44] death coming into an anointing for the
[1:13:46] inner chamber and taking nothing of my
[1:13:48] own just what hacky i
[1:13:52] had spoke
[1:13:54] that made her better
[1:13:56] than vashti
[1:13:59] brother brahms says in the marriage of
[1:14:01] the lamb from 1962 esther was to become
[1:14:03] a bride so she didn't want none of that
[1:14:05] of the adorning of the world
[1:14:07] she wanted to go in through the king
[1:14:09] just like she was she adorned them she
[1:14:12] adorned themselves like the pentecost
[1:14:14] the women ought to with a meek humble
[1:14:16] spirit
[1:14:17] and when all these fancy first ladies
[1:14:19] come by with all their new fame dangled
[1:14:21] things the king looked at them and put
[1:14:23] them in the chamber with the concubines
[1:14:25] but when this esther come into sight and
[1:14:27] he got a glimpse of that sweet
[1:14:29] humble
[1:14:30] meek spirit he said that's her go get
[1:14:33] the crown and put it on her head that's
[1:14:36] it
[1:14:37] how do we know she had a meek humble
[1:14:39] spirit because she didn't require
[1:14:41] anything only what haggai appointed
[1:14:47] let them adorn themselves with that kind
[1:14:49] of spirit not only the women but the men
[1:14:51] too adorn themselves with that kind of
[1:14:53] spirit then you're becoming ready for
[1:14:56] the bride sweet reverent esther made her
[1:14:59] heart clean
[1:15:01] further down in the same match he says
[1:15:03] esther purged her heart before god
[1:15:05] walked up with a meek and humble spirit
[1:15:07] the church that's going to be the bride
[1:15:09] of christ now remember esther refused
[1:15:11] the worldly adornment she took the
[1:15:13] spirit in her heart to go before the
[1:15:15] king
[1:15:16] and the women today the church that
[1:15:17] thinks she's going to get in because
[1:15:19] she's got more numbers
[1:15:21] she's the best dressed crowd she's got
[1:15:22] the biggest organization the biggest
[1:15:24] church in the city and things like that
[1:15:26] you'll miss it a million miles if you're
[1:15:28] depending on that it's a sweet kind
[1:15:32] reverent now i want you to catch the way

[1:15:57] church they're sweet as pie nice always
[1:16:00] want to do something for you but they
[1:16:02] will not subject themselves to the word
[1:16:04] of god that's not the character he's
[1:16:06] looking for that's human sweetness amen
[1:16:09] that's a that's a nice temperament that
[1:16:11] somebody got genetically amen they're
[1:16:13] kind they're sweet they're nice we like
[1:16:15] that kind of people hopefully the
[1:16:16] world's full of them amen but that's not
[1:16:18] the one he's looking for he's looking
[1:16:19] for one that's kind and sweet and
[1:16:22] reverent to the word

[1:16:33] water of the word and the word in you
[1:16:35] it's awashing
[1:16:37] praise god that's what made esther
[1:16:39] different that's why he chose esther
[1:16:40] over the concubine they took their own
[1:16:43] idea they take worldly adornment they
[1:16:45] took worldly ideas she came the way
[1:16:47] haggy i had spoke
[1:16:49] she heard what he said she took it the
[1:16:51] way he said it she went in that way
[1:16:55] she had a sweet kind humble reverent
[1:16:57] spirit to the word
[1:17:00] that's what he's looking for
[1:17:02] what will make you better than the
[1:17:03] denominations
[1:17:06] what makes you and i better than the
[1:17:08] denominations are we smarter far from it
[1:17:12] are we more in number do we have more
[1:17:14] about nothing the only thing that's
[1:17:16] going to separate us from the ones
[1:17:17] who've been rejected amen is a sweet
[1:17:20] reverent spirit to the word amen ones
[1:17:23] that will reverence his word that will
[1:17:25] subject himself to his commandments one
[1:17:27] that will believe the prophet that he
[1:17:28] sent in this day and not tried to adorn
[1:17:32] themselves with something different but
[1:17:34] just come adorned upon the clothing of
[1:17:36] the word amen that the prophet of god
[1:17:38] said let this be the crowning of my
[1:17:40] ministry to clothe a word a bride for
[1:17:42] the rapture with the clothing of the
[1:17:45] word amen subject adorned with the word
[1:17:48] that god had used this prophet to clothe
[1:17:50] his bride
[1:17:54] let's look at esther chapter 2 verse 20.
[1:17:59] we're going to look at the spirit
[1:18:00] brother brad is talking about
[1:18:03] esther chapter 2 verse 20 esther had not
[1:18:05] yet showed her kindred nor her people as
[1:18:07] mordecai had charged her for esther did
[1:18:10] the commandment of mordecai
[1:18:12] like is when she was brought up with him
[1:18:16] mordecai
[1:18:18] was her her headship
[1:18:22] and she was taken from mordecai and went
[1:18:25] in to the king's house of women
[1:18:28] under haggai
[1:18:30] but she would not forsake the headship
[1:18:33] of mordecai
[1:18:35] she was subject to mordecai
[1:18:38] and now she's been chosen to be queen
[1:18:41] she's queen over a province that spans
[1:18:43] amen 127 provinces a kingdom spans 127
[1:18:47] one of the most wealthiest kingdoms
[1:18:49] that's ever been on the earth she's now
[1:18:51] queen amen and she's still subject to
[1:18:54] her headshift
[1:18:56] amen this is the spirit this is where
[1:18:58] brother brennan picks this up he doesn't
[1:19:00] just make this up here the king loved
[1:19:02] her king kind sweet humble spirit it's
[1:19:05] evident in the scriptures she had a
[1:19:07] sweet kind humble spirit
[1:19:09] she was still humble and submissive to
[1:19:11] the headship
[1:19:13] that she had been brought up under
[1:19:16] and now and she was submissive to haggy
[1:19:18] either keeper of the women now she's
[1:19:20] submissive to the commandments of the
[1:19:22] king she's the one that he wants
[1:19:26] praise to be the god
[1:19:27] brother brahm said in the message look
[1:19:28] from 1963 the way up is down
[1:19:32] he that humbles himself shall be exalted
[1:19:35] he that exalts himself shall be abased
[1:19:37] see we must humble ourselves not try to
[1:19:41] know too much
[1:19:43] just know one thing
[1:19:45] don't try to know too much there's no
[1:19:46] one thing
[1:19:48] focus everything else out of the way and
[1:19:51] look unto christ
[1:19:53] and who's christ the anointed word for
[1:19:55] this day
[1:19:58] if you don't know how to write your name
[1:19:59] that don't have one thing to do with it
[1:20:01] just focus your heart to christ and his
[1:20:03] will and watch what happens
[1:20:06] that's the reverence and humility that
[1:20:08] he's looking for in this day out of his
[1:20:10] bride one that will focus amen to christ
[1:20:13] his will and his will as his word and
[1:20:15] then just see what god does
[1:20:18] one that'll trust god that if i do it
[1:20:20] his way he'll do what he promised to do
[1:20:25] when we begin to do things our own way
[1:20:27] we're testifying that i no longer trust
[1:20:29] god to keep his word because now i've
[1:20:31] got to find an alternate way to do
[1:20:33] something other than what he commanded
[1:20:38] and that's how all these other women
[1:20:40] were that's how vast he was vashti was
[1:20:42] just like saul she had gotten lifted up
[1:20:45] because she was a queen she was in royal
[1:20:47] apparel she was in a position she was in
[1:20:50] a house her own her own house amen she
[1:20:53] had everything going for saul was a king
[1:20:56] over his own kingdom and many had been
[1:20:58] lifted up he had everything going for
[1:21:00] him but he did not obey the full word
[1:21:03] amen but vashti did not obey the full
[1:21:05] word both of them rejected and both were
[1:21:08] found another one that was better than
[1:21:10] them
[1:21:12] and the one that was better than them
[1:21:14] was one that would humble themselves and
[1:21:16] take instruction
[1:21:21] let's look at chapter 3
[1:21:23] verse 1.
[1:21:26] after these things did king ahazerus
[1:21:28] promote haman the son of hamad detha
[1:21:32] the aggite
[1:21:35] do you remember the name of the king
[1:21:36] that saul kept alive
[1:21:39] ag
[1:21:41] this is a descendant somehow don't ask
[1:21:44] me how i don't know but this is a
[1:21:46] descendant somehow of a gag
[1:21:48] this is an again this is a malachite and
[1:21:52] you ask yourself
[1:21:53] why did mordecai not bow before haman
[1:21:58] now when the king come by mordecai had
[1:22:00] to bow before the king there's no way
[1:22:02] that mordecai is going to be a keeper of
[1:22:03] the door and shusham the palace and the
[1:22:05] king come by and ha and mordecai and not
[1:22:08] bow so it's not that mordecai being a
[1:22:10] jew won't bow before any man he had to
[1:22:12] bow
[1:22:13] he was in the employment of the palace
[1:22:15] he had to bow but he would not bow to
[1:22:18] this one individual and that individual
[1:22:20] was haman because haman was the enemy of
[1:22:22] the jews haman was an amalekite he was
[1:22:25] an agagite amen he was the one that god
[1:22:28] promised that he would wipe their name
[1:22:29] out from under heaven and that he would
[1:22:31] utterly destroy that's the one he told
[1:22:33] joshua not to forget but to destroy it's
[1:22:36] the one he told saul to destroy but saul
[1:22:38] left off to run after the spoil
[1:22:42] and now
[1:22:43] now there's two people rising on the
[1:22:45] scene amen there's an esther humble
[1:22:48] submissive meek and and sweet amen out
[1:22:51] of saul's line
[1:22:54] and now there's haman
[1:22:56] out of a malachi's line out of agag's
[1:22:58] line amen and they're going to face off
[1:23:01] once again
[1:23:04] and it's not going to be by might nor by
[1:23:06] power but by my spirit saith the lord
[1:23:09] she's going to win this victory over the
[1:23:10] malachites by surrender by humility by
[1:23:14] meekness my reverence
[1:23:18] not by force and by power and by showing
[1:23:21] off and by showing what she can do and
[1:23:23] becoming arrogant she's going to win
[1:23:25] this battle by staying submissive and
[1:23:28] humble and reverent
[1:23:32] this bride never has to lose her sweet
[1:23:34] humble reverend spirit to the word
[1:23:37] to defeat the devil in this day
[1:23:40] she never has to get arrogant she never
[1:23:41] has to be boastful she never has to
[1:23:43] demonstrate all that she can do and
[1:23:45] claim great powers and wonders she can
[1:23:47] stay sweet humble kind and reverent to
[1:23:51] the word
[1:23:53] and god will do what he said he would do
[1:23:56] wipe the remembrance of it off the face
[1:23:58] of the earth
[1:24:00] amen let's jump down to verse 10. i want
[1:24:03] you to catch a wording a phrase here
[1:24:06] verse 10 and the king took his ring from
[1:24:08] his hand that he given to haman the son
[1:24:11] of hamadaytha the agagite the jews enemy
[1:24:17] who were the jews first enemy when they
[1:24:18] came out of egypt the amalekites
[1:24:21] who's the jew's enemy here haman the
[1:24:23] agagite
[1:24:25] of the same lineage amen
[1:24:28] let's look at uh chapter nine let's skip
[1:24:30] over the chapter nine i want to catch
[1:24:32] this wording again
[1:24:34] chapter nine verse twenty four
[1:24:40] chapter nine verse twenty four
[1:24:43] because haman the son of hamadatha the
[1:24:45] agagite the enemy of all the jews
[1:24:49] had devised against the jews to destroy
[1:24:52] them and had casper that is the lot
[1:24:54] consumed them and to destroy them all so
[1:24:57] his title
[1:24:58] is
[1:24:59] haman
[1:25:00] amen the agagite the enemy of all the
[1:25:03] jews
[1:25:05] amen
[1:25:07] let's look at esther chapter 8 together
[1:25:12] so familiar with the story
[1:25:16] but
[1:25:17] esther
[1:25:18] she has to approach into the king
[1:25:23] and
[1:25:24] and she doesn't know how it's going to
[1:25:26] go
[1:25:29] she has to approach unto the king
[1:25:32] and mordecai and structure to go into
[1:25:34] the king
[1:25:35] because haman you know he has this plot
[1:25:37] this wicked plot and he gets this
[1:25:39] deceives the king and
[1:25:41] letting him make a decree and get to
[1:25:42] kill all the jews and but he doesn't
[1:25:44] disclose to the king who it's going to
[1:25:46] be that's going to be destroyed and
[1:25:48] through his wicked plot his cowardly
[1:25:50] plot
[1:25:52] through his cowardly plot
[1:25:54] you ever heard that term cowardly plot
[1:25:57] just when he's about to
[1:25:59] the the uh
[1:26:00] uh whatever fulfill his cowardly plot he
[1:26:03] come and snatches her away
[1:26:05] and here haman is just about to fulfill
[1:26:08] his cowardly plot
[1:26:11] any and he has a decree sign that all
[1:26:13] the jews can be destroyed and all their
[1:26:16] uh all their spoil can be plundered amen
[1:26:19] he's going to have a great victory
[1:26:20] they're going to kill them all he has
[1:26:22] the gallows built amen for mordecai
[1:26:24] because he hates mordecai because
[1:26:25] mordecai won't bow to him and because
[1:26:27] mordecai's of saul and he's of ag
[1:26:32] i tell you friends god never forgets
[1:26:35] this is hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:26:37] later amen this is hundreds of years
[1:26:39] later in a different land altogether god
[1:26:42] does not forget when god makes a promise
[1:26:45] he doesn't forget when god gives a
[1:26:47] commission he doesn't forget when god's
[1:26:49] going to deliver he does not forget
[1:26:52] we may forget but he doesn't forget what
[1:26:54] does he need he needs one man totally
[1:26:57] surrendered in his hand and he can do
[1:26:58] many things he can shake the whole world
[1:27:01] what's he need a surrender he needs a
[1:27:03] surrendered vessel
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:06] so we know that the queen has a banquet
[1:27:09] of wine and invites the king and look at
[1:27:12] the whole approach to the king esther
[1:27:14] never becomes arrogant
[1:27:16] esther never becomes brash
[1:27:19] she always approaches the king in
[1:27:22] humility
[1:27:24] she always approaches the king and
[1:27:26] humility humble subjection to the king
[1:27:30] and she comes amen to the king not
[1:27:32] knowing if she'll be accepted but she's
[1:27:34] willing to lay down her life
[1:27:36] because mordecai instructed her to
[1:27:40] because mordecai said she's willing now
[1:27:42] she says you pray i'll pray i go in if i
[1:27:45] perish i perish why is she going because
[1:27:48] mordecai told her to go
[1:27:50] she's always submissive always humble
[1:27:54] always reverent
[1:27:57] and she moves forward not knowing if
[1:27:59] she'll survive when she comes to the
[1:28:01] king the king accepts her by extending
[1:28:03] the scepter and she says if it please
[1:28:05] the king
[1:28:08] not i demand you and you better and you
[1:28:14] but if it pleased the king
[1:28:16] and if i found favor in your eyes
[1:28:19] would you come to a banquet
[1:28:21] that i've prepared
[1:28:24] see when the king sees esther
[1:28:26] come something happens in the king
[1:28:30] if you read this amen we know the story
[1:28:32] you can read through it it's only nine
[1:28:34] chapters
[1:28:37] but when you go
[1:28:38] and you read
[1:28:40] he wanted vashti to come to him
[1:28:43] when he called
[1:28:44] and she refused
[1:28:46] he wanted vashti to come to him
[1:28:49] he was
[1:28:50] enjoying himself he was feasting and he
[1:28:52] wanted and she refused to come to the
[1:28:54] king
[1:28:56] but here without him asking
[1:28:59] esther reverently and humbly approaches
[1:29:01] to him
[1:29:03] and when he sees esther come
[1:29:05] in the royal apparel humble and
[1:29:07] submissive and reverent he's moved he
[1:29:10] extends the scepter and he says what is
[1:29:13] it that thou want i will give anything
[1:29:15] up to half my kingdom
[1:29:18] like what a statement for this king to
[1:29:21] make why would he make a statement like
[1:29:23] that because he had a queen that
[1:29:25] wouldn't come at his bidding and here
[1:29:27] she comes of her own free will because
[1:29:29] the king wants fellowship with his queen
[1:29:32] amen the queen and then she says would
[1:29:35] you come to a banquet of wine i prepared
[1:29:37] for you and immediately said is make
[1:29:39] haste and make ready
[1:29:42] amen i couldn't get vashi to come to me
[1:29:44] not only does this woman come to me she
[1:29:46] wants me to come to her she wants to
[1:29:48] entertain me she doesn't want me to
[1:29:50] entertain her she wants to welcome me
[1:29:53] into her house she wants to entertain me
[1:29:55] she wants me to find welcome in her
[1:29:58] place and her abode amen god is not
[1:30:01] looking for the kind of bride amen that
[1:30:03] comes to god's house amen to get some
[1:30:05] benefits and comes only when she wants
[1:30:07] to comes to church and comes to get a
[1:30:10] reward doesn't come when she doesn't
[1:30:11] feel like it he's looking for a queen
[1:30:13] that'll come to him because she comes to
[1:30:16] him humbly reverently and wants him to
[1:30:18] come to be entertained in her house
[1:30:21] because god wants fellowship
[1:30:24] he doesn't want a queen to stay
[1:30:26] separated he wants a queen to come to
[1:30:28] him and ask him to come to her
[1:30:32] he asked her again in the banquet of
[1:30:34] wine what do you want up to half my
[1:30:36] kingdom
[1:30:38] listen
[1:30:39] this was not he's not the mayor of gomer
[1:30:48] he
[1:30:49] he is the king ruling over almost all
[1:30:52] the inhabited world at that time
[1:30:56] and he's going to give her
[1:30:58] he's got a kingdom that goes from india
[1:31:00] to ethiopia
[1:31:02] it'll give her up to half the kingdom
[1:31:06] she's going to be a joint heir
[1:31:08] with him
[1:31:10] because he wants a woman
[1:31:12] that loves him
[1:31:14] that comes to him and invites him to
[1:31:17] come to her
[1:31:19] and in her house she exposes haman
[1:31:22] we know haman ends up hanging on the
[1:31:24] gallows that he prepared for mordecai
[1:31:28] but then there's another decree that
[1:31:31] goes out
[1:31:33] because esther introduces mordecai to
[1:31:35] the king and mordecai has been given the
[1:31:37] the ring that was on haman's hand and he
[1:31:39] tells esther and mordecai you can now
[1:31:41] write a new decree
[1:31:44] and they begin to write that the jews
[1:31:46] can now defend themselves and i want you
[1:31:48] to read what's what's written here
[1:31:50] esther chapter 8
[1:31:53] verse 10.
[1:31:55] esther chapter 8 verse 10.
[1:31:57] this is really important to catch this
[1:32:02] and he wrote in the king azares name and
[1:32:04] sealed it with the king's ring and sent
[1:32:06] letters by post on horseback and writers
[1:32:08] on mules and camels and young
[1:32:10] dromedaries wherein the king granted the
[1:32:12] jews
[1:32:13] which were in every city to gather
[1:32:15] themselves together and to stand for
[1:32:17] their life to destroy to slay and to
[1:32:20] cause to perish all the power of the
[1:32:22] people in the province that would
[1:32:24] assault them both little ones and women
[1:32:27] and to take the spoil of them for a prey
[1:32:31] so now he tells them
[1:32:32] he signs a new decree the king gives
[1:32:34] them a right you can now fight back
[1:32:36] against those that want to destroy you
[1:32:38] you can kill them and their little ones
[1:32:40] and their women we're going right back
[1:32:43] to what saul was told to do
[1:32:46] only in this decree
[1:32:49] he says you can take the spoil
[1:32:53] you can take the spoil
[1:32:55] now they go to perform that the day
[1:32:57] comes and they begin to defend
[1:32:58] themselves and they they they the in all
[1:33:01] the provinces they slay so many they
[1:33:03] stand up and fight and shush in the
[1:33:05] palace they stand up and fight but let's
[1:33:07] look at verse 15 of chapter nine
[1:33:12] no
[1:33:13] not chapter nine
[1:33:16] yeah chapter nine
[1:33:18] i want to look at verse 12.
[1:33:20] the report comes back
[1:33:22] that the ten sons of haman are dead
[1:33:25] that they've killed five hundred and
[1:33:27] shushan they've killed so many more in
[1:33:29] the provinces and now verse 12 of
[1:33:31] chapter nine says and the king said unto
[1:33:33] esther the queen
[1:33:34] the jews have slain and destroyed 500
[1:33:37] men in shusha in the palace and the ten
[1:33:39] sons of haman
[1:33:40] what have they done in in the rest of
[1:33:42] the king's provinces
[1:33:44] now what is thy petition and it shall be
[1:33:46] granted thee or what is i request
[1:33:48] further and it shall be done he's saying
[1:33:51] you say
[1:33:54] this is now the third pull in esther
[1:33:58] whatever you say it'll be done what do
[1:34:01] you want what do you
[1:34:02] say and look at what esther says
[1:34:07] then said esther if it pleased the king
[1:34:10] let it be granted to the jews which are
[1:34:13] in shushan to do tomorrow also according
[1:34:16] unto this day's decree and let haman's
[1:34:19] ten sons be hanged upon the gallows and
[1:34:21] the king commanded the to be so to be
[1:34:23] done and the decree was given at shushan
[1:34:26] and they hanged hammond's ten sons
[1:34:28] haman's ten sons
[1:34:30] what did she want
[1:34:32] where did saul fail
[1:34:35] he was told to utterly destroy
[1:34:38] he fought one big battle and he flew to
[1:34:40] the prey before he chased the rest of
[1:34:42] the amalekites amen but they asked
[1:34:45] esther what do you want now esther says
[1:34:47] let us do it again tomorrow
[1:34:49] amen what are we going to do utterly
[1:34:51] destroy don't let us stop now let us
[1:34:54] keep going till we eradicate the
[1:34:56] amalekites let us do tomorrow like we
[1:34:58] did today what is she doing she's
[1:35:00] fulfilling the commission to utterly
[1:35:03] destroy
[1:35:05] and the next day they killed 300 in
[1:35:07] shushan but but then look at this this
[1:35:09] is interesting verse 15
[1:35:12] for the jews that were in shushen
[1:35:14] gathered themselves together on the 14th
[1:35:16] day also of the month adar and slew 300
[1:35:19] men at shushan but on the prey
[1:35:22] they laid not their hand
[1:35:27] let's read the next verse
[1:35:28] but the other jews that were in the
[1:35:30] king's provinces gathered themselves
[1:35:31] together and stood for their lives and
[1:35:33] had rest from their enemies and slew of
[1:35:35] their foes seventy and five thousand but
[1:35:37] they laid not their hands on the prey
[1:35:42] this time they passed the test
[1:35:46] they were given a king's decree amen but
[1:35:49] from from the writing of mordecai from
[1:35:51] the seal of the king that you can go and
[1:35:53] defend yourself you can fight you can
[1:35:55] take the little ones you can take the
[1:35:56] women amen this is the commission that
[1:35:58] came all the way back out of exodus you
[1:36:00] can come now to that and you're allowed
[1:36:02] to have to pray but none of the jews
[1:36:05] touched to pray they went back to the
[1:36:07] words of samuel amen when samuel said
[1:36:09] don't take anything don't touch anything
[1:36:12] amen leave it all alone it's all the
[1:36:13] amalekites don't mess with anything
[1:36:15] that's a malachi none of the jews in
[1:36:18] this day touched the prey they overcame
[1:36:20] the temptation they had permission from
[1:36:23] a king to do it but they still didn't do
[1:36:25] it
[1:36:28] amen do you see the similarities between
[1:36:30] first samuel 15 and and now esther this
[1:36:33] is god finishing the commission how
[1:36:36] through a humble little woman amen and a
[1:36:39] group of people that'll just do what the
[1:36:41] word said do and when they were able
[1:36:43] even to take the prey they went back to
[1:36:45] the original commission that was left
[1:36:47] off and they said we're not going to
[1:36:48] touch anything that's the amalekites
[1:36:52] and when they had a great day of
[1:36:53] slaughter the king says to esther what
[1:36:55] do you want to do next and she says i
[1:36:56] want to do it again tomorrow because
[1:36:58] there's a commandment to wipe out their
[1:37:00] name from under heaven there's a
[1:37:02] commandment that was given to utterly
[1:37:04] destroy the amalekites let us do
[1:37:06] tomorrow like we did today
[1:37:09] you can do it
[1:37:12] this is the last mention in the bible of
[1:37:15] amalekites
[1:37:17] nowhere else in the history of the jews
[1:37:19] that i've seen can you find amalekites
[1:37:23] or agagites
[1:37:26] god
[1:37:27] remembers
[1:37:31] what does he need
[1:37:32] power strength
[1:37:35] beauty
[1:37:36] wisdom
[1:37:38] he needs humility
[1:37:40] and submission
[1:37:43] he can supply everything else
[1:37:47] but he needs somebody that'll do all his
[1:37:50] will
[1:37:51] and brother branham said his will is his
[1:37:53] word
[1:37:55] in christ the mystery of god revealed he
[1:37:57] said the church is the blood of christ
[1:37:58] by the spirit
[1:38:00] because the life is in the blood that's
[1:38:01] the baptism of the holy ghost that
[1:38:03] baptizes us into his body
[1:38:06] that recognizes only his body his flesh
[1:38:08] his word
[1:38:10] denominations won't never touch that
[1:38:12] it's a revelation she knows it so did
[1:38:14] eve know it but she fell but this one
[1:38:16] knows it and won't fall
[1:38:20] this one won't touch the spoil
[1:38:24] she's ordained hallelujah she's ordained
[1:38:26] not to fall she won't fail she is
[1:38:29] predestinated to him
[1:38:32] in the message the god of this evil age
[1:38:34] the prophet says we find now this evil
[1:38:36] age is to prove to satan she's not like
[1:38:38] eve
[1:38:40] that she's not that type of a woman
[1:38:42] and she will be tried by his word the
[1:38:44] bride
[1:38:45] as adam's bride was tried by the word
[1:38:48] and adam's bride believed every bit of
[1:38:50] the word all but confused on one promise
[1:38:53] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:38:54] forever today see but failed on one
[1:38:57] promise under the temptation of the
[1:38:58] enemy face to face and now the people
[1:39:01] that's called for his name of course is
[1:39:03] his bride she is to come in contact
[1:39:06] again by the same thing
[1:39:08] not by just denominational truth or
[1:39:09] something but every word
[1:39:15] adam's bride was tested by the word
[1:39:17] christ bride would be tested by the word
[1:39:20] but this day
[1:39:22] god is going to remember all the
[1:39:24] promises he's made
[1:39:26] like in esther's day god never forgot
[1:39:30] they were in captivity they were away
[1:39:32] from the homeland they were they were uh
[1:39:34] they were a people that had learned to
[1:39:36] learn to uh
[1:39:38] build homes and live in a foreign
[1:39:40] country they were separated from the
[1:39:42] temple they were separated from
[1:39:43] jerusalem separated from the inheritance
[1:39:45] amen they were living out in existence
[1:39:47] there but god did not forget what he
[1:39:49] said in exodus he did not forget the
[1:39:51] commission in deuteronomy 25 to joshua
[1:39:54] he did not forget what saul had told
[1:39:57] samuel told saul to do god never forgot
[1:40:00] and god finally got a humble little
[1:40:03] virgin girl
[1:40:05] just like god
[1:40:07] thousands of years later did not forget
[1:40:09] what he said in genesis 3 the seed of
[1:40:12] the woman
[1:40:13] and he got a humble little virgin girl
[1:40:16] from nazareth
[1:40:17] who would just say be it unto me
[1:40:20] according to your word
[1:40:23] what's he need today he needs a humble
[1:40:25] little virgin girl
[1:40:28] that'll move
[1:40:29] from the earthly
[1:40:31] to the heavenly
[1:40:33] from hadassah to star that will pass
[1:40:37] through the anointing of death and die
[1:40:38] out
[1:40:40] move into an anointing of the holy ghost
[1:40:42] to go into the inner chamber
[1:40:45] and go according to the way haggai said
[1:40:48] one that will stay submissive to
[1:40:50] mordecai one that will only do what
[1:40:52] haggai said one that will love the king
[1:40:56] one that will be reverent to the king
[1:40:58] and humble to the king and one that
[1:41:00] won't forget the word amen and when she
[1:41:03] has an opportunity she'll even sacrifice
[1:41:06] herself
[1:41:08] to go before the king
[1:41:10] and remember
[1:41:11] that the amalekites have to be utterly
[1:41:13] destroyed
[1:41:15] and there'll be a people on this earth
[1:41:18] that won't touch the spoil this time
[1:41:21] god is going to have his esther he's
[1:41:24] going to have his star
[1:41:26] and i say with all that's in me god i
[1:41:28] want it to be me
[1:41:29] i want to be surrendered i want to be
[1:41:31] submissive i want you to fulfill the
[1:41:34] commission and the promise through a
[1:41:36] humble vessel god i have nothing to give
[1:41:38] to you but myself
[1:41:40] i have no gift to offer but myself i
[1:41:43] have nothing that i can do for you amen
[1:41:45] because there's what can you do for god
[1:41:48] there's nothing i can't help give i
[1:41:50] can't do anything i can't give god
[1:41:52] something he doesn't already have all i
[1:41:54] can give is myself my vessel my mind my
[1:41:56] heart my energy my time just give myself
[1:41:59] holy to him and let him pick me up and
[1:42:01] do what he's promised to do in this end
[1:42:03] time
[1:42:04] with a humble submissive vessel
[1:42:07] that's our desire let's be like esther
[1:42:11] let's be better than vashti let's be
[1:42:14] like david
[1:42:16] better than saul
[1:42:18] how can we be better
[1:42:20] to be after god's own heart
[1:42:23] to do all
[1:42:24] his
[1:42:25] will
[1:42:27] god bless you let's stand together
[1:42:29] musicians if you'll come
[1:42:31] this time
[1:42:34] i was so astonished looking at the bible
[1:42:37] and seeing the parallel
[1:42:40] and recognizing how faithful god is to
[1:42:43] his word
[1:42:45] he fulfills his word in such an
[1:42:47] unexpected way
[1:42:49] who would have expected when he told
[1:42:51] saul to utterly destroy the amalekites
[1:42:53] that god was going to finish it through
[1:42:54] a little woman in a foreign land
[1:42:58] whoever knew that when god made the
[1:43:00] promise in exodus that he will not
[1:43:02] forget what amalek did in hill and he'll
[1:43:04] erase their name from under heaven who
[1:43:06] would have dreamed it would have come
[1:43:08] through a little virgin girl
[1:43:10] captive in a foreign land
[1:43:14] god's ways are so much higher than our
[1:43:16] ways he never does it the expected way
[1:43:18] but he always does it according to his
[1:43:20] word
[1:43:21] and here we are the virgin girl in the
[1:43:24] foreign land
[1:43:26] with the opportunity to surrender all
[1:43:29] i said god
[1:43:31] fulfill your word in this tabernacle of
[1:43:33] flesh
[1:43:35] right now let's bow our heads to him
[1:43:38] lord jesus we thank you father
[1:43:41] god your word is so rich and it's so
[1:43:43] pure
[1:43:44] lord every shadow every type every
[1:43:47] character every story in the bible is
[1:43:49] demonstrating this mystery of the
[1:43:51] seventh seal
[1:43:53] what you've reserved for the end time
[1:43:54] your plan and your goal and your purpose
[1:43:58] lord it's being known it's being made
[1:44:00] manifest story by story
[1:44:02] shadow by shadow type by time character
[1:44:05] by character
[1:44:06] and god we keep finding ourselves in
[1:44:08] your word
[1:44:10] we find ourselves in
[1:44:11] these stories these types
[1:44:14] and we find how faithful you are to keep
[1:44:16] your word
[1:44:18] god if we can just yield you can perform
[1:44:20] your word
[1:44:21] if we can just surrender you can do the
[1:44:23] miraculous if we can give up you can
[1:44:26] take over
[1:44:27] i pray god that as we give up now that
[1:44:29] you would take over
[1:44:31] you would heal us lord and deliver us
[1:44:33] from ourselves lord deliver us from our
[1:44:36] old carnal thinking and our traditional
[1:44:38] understanding of the word
[1:44:40] and bring us into the pure revelation of
[1:44:43] the pure worm and give us a surrendered
[1:44:45] heart to lay down our lives for this
[1:44:47] word
[1:44:48] to give up
[1:44:50] to give out
[1:44:51] to not hold anything back but to totally
[1:44:53] surrender
[1:44:55] and watch you work a mighty victory in
[1:44:57] this day
[1:44:58] as you fulfill your promise
[1:45:00] for your promised word says in romans 16
