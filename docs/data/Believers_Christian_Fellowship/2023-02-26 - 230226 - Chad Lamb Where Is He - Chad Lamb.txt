to bless take three imminence Among Us have your way we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you while you're standing let's take our Bibles and turn to Colossians chapter one if you would as you're turning there I just want to remind you that Brother Kyle Walker and I will be traveling to the Philippines this Thursday and we'll be leaving early Thursday morning so I'll be here Lord willing preaching Wednesday night and we'll get up early and head out and uh it's interesting I'm I'm excited to be traveling with brother cobbler the Kyle and I have never had the opportunity to travel together in Ministry we tried it once five or six years ago and poor Brother Kyle got left alone at the airport and had to go by himself because my passport didn't have enough time on it and they turned me down and sent me back and so we tried it once so we're going to try it again amen but they invited us to come for anniversary meetings Brother Kyle got a special invite from Brother nest and brother Danny to join in and so he felt to accept it so just be praying for us we appreciate it there's quite a few Services we'll be preaching it's anniversary meetings 35th Anniversary meetings for brother Nestor 30th Anniversary meetings for brother Danny del mundo and in between that we have anniversary meetings for Brother Don Don and I don't know how many years that is so it'll be anniversary meetings anniversary meetings anniversary meetings but I just pray that God will be with us we'd appreciate your prayers for the travel and for the ministry as well also while I'm gone I've asked Brother David Dean Hart to come and preach he'll be taking the Sunday and the Wednesday service so the Sunday and Wednesday Brother David Dean Hart then the following Sunday I will be brother Burley Williams he's coming up to minister for us so be praying for those Services as well man let's look into Colossians Colossians chapter one verse 26 very very familiar we could probably quote it by heart but I'd like to begin with this verse Colossians chapter 1 verse 26 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen God bless you as you take your seats there are certain things that that has been preached in this day certain things in the scriptures and certain things that the prophet of God have brought to light and those things I don't think we could ever be reminded of enough because it is the manifestation in our day it is the revelation of the mystery that we're to be fleshing out in this day and this scripture is such a key pivotal scripture to that this is the mystery you know whom God would make known verse 27 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen what a theme and I just want to take for a subject tonight if I can for a title or this morning sorry for a title is where is he just to question where is he and we can all answer that question we all know you know the things that I want to talk about uh this morning that are on my heart are not something we're not aware of or don't know but they're things that it behooves us to look at and it and it really behooves us to look at it and let it become more real amen that it becomes a greater reality in our lives because there are consequences for things Amen in Revelation will bring consequences in our life a true revelation will actually change the way we think the way we view something and it actually will change our behavior and change our conduct and it makes us a a line to that Revelation and so it's important that these things remain true to us and before our eyes constantly so the question is where is he in in this message has been brewing for quite some time and I'll I'll fill you in on why as we go a little further but there was a a question that brother Abraham Myra asked me about a quote and he sent me the quote he said what do you think about this he said I can't sort this out and I told him I have no clue brother you know that's just my answer real quickly but I read it but I never could get that quote out of my heart I've been meditating on it dwelling on it for quite some time and I'll share that with you when we get to it it'll be a little bit later and then there was another brother I was speaking with brother Elmer Schwartz one day and he mentioned the scripture and gave a comment on it and and lo and behold if it didn't spark another thought and these two things that were totally random and separate from one another started moving together in my heart and so I'll I'll share that scripture with you when we get to it as well but I just in a way of maybe review or laying a foundation or whatever there's some things that I'd like to go over and as we get to there then I'll share with you what those things were and why they've had such an impact on me personally let's turn to John chapter 10. John chapter 10. and we'll look at verse 33. John 10 and 33. the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy and because thou being a man maketh thyself God Jesus answered them is it not written in your law I said ye are Gods if I called them Gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken say you of him whom the father has Sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemus because I said I am the son of God so he asked a question they want to accuse him of blasphemy because he says he's the son of God but he said doesn't the scripture says that you are gods to whom the word of the Lord came to let's go back and look at this scripture in Psalms 82. we'll take it from there because I love to go back to the scripture that Jesus is referring to and read in what context read what it said so Jesus is referring back to Psalms 82. and verse 6. and he says I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high you are all gods and your children the most high but Jesus said that he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came so who does the word of God come to it comes to the children of God and when the word of God comes to the children of God it's a declaration that they they are Gods according to the scripture because we've been through this before The Offspring of a man is a man The Offspring of a dog is a dog and The Offspring of a cat is a cat so The Offspring of God would be amen praise God those things are hard to say there's a repulsion within our human being in our human mind amen but if God is God the family of God are gods and God meant man God meant for man to be a God on the earth he when he made Adam and placed him on Earth he gave him rulership over all the creation and he was to be a God on Earth and he fell from his status because of falling from the word but now Jesus said unto whom the word come to they are gods praise God so we must stay with the word now in the unveiling of God brother Brandon says notice Through the Ages the same way by His prophets he has revealed himself then wasn't exactly prophets they were Gods he said so for what they spoke was God's word they were the flesh that God was veiled in this is so important they were the flesh that God was veiled in they were Gods Jesus said himself said how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God and your own law says that them who the word of the Lord come to was God's so now I want to go look at Moses in the book of Exodus if you could turn with me to Exodus chapter 3 Exodus chapter 3. and we just keep laying this Foundation Exodus chapter 3 verse 7. and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression where with the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou Mays bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt so he begins by saying I have heard the cry and in verse 80 says and I am come down to deliver them I have come down to deliver them now he goes and he finds Moses when God come down to deliver them he finds a man because God always works through man so he finds Moses and Moses was born a proper child he was born under a sign he was always predestinated to be this deliverer but he had run to the backside of the desert he was out in the wilderness tending his father-in-law sheep and God came to him with a sign and found him and told him this is time for me to come and for me to deliver my children now I'm and now now I'm calling you now you go and you deliver my children so what was Moses Moses was representing God where was God when he was delivering his children coming to deliver them he was in that Prophet coming to deliver his children Moses was a representation of God and what God was doing in that day what God had declared I will now do he was now doing in and through Moses praise God again in the unveiling of God he says Moses had the word now remember after the word was made manifest Moses was Moses again but while that word was in him to be given out he was God well he wasn't Moses no more he had the word of the Lord for that age nothing could touch him till that was over had had that word with him so therefore when he come the people turned their heads they couldn't understand they they had been changed he was a different fellow he came with that word and he put a veil but the Bible said over his face for he had the word and he was the word to them he didn't just have the word he was the word to them he was God coming to set them free and it wasn't the Flesh of Moses but the flesh of Moses was the vessel that God was using it was gone through Moses sometimes it's hard to keep these things separated and sometimes the terminology the the prophet speaks so bluntly sometimes and it takes your breath away a little bit because we have so much experience with the flesh man we see everything through flesh amen and we like no it couldn't be this flesh and I make so many mistakes but God's not interested in that part there's a seed on the inside that gives him something he can access and use to use this flesh for his purpose so again says in the unveiling of God like he was in Moses when the word was in Moses he was God in flesh that's a statement that's a statement when it was in Jesus it was God in flesh see only thing he done was change his mask not his word not his nature he is the same yesterday today and forever he only changed his form he changed from Noah to Moses he changed from Moses to David from David to Joseph on down until he come into the fullness of the godhead bodily it's still the same God amen amen I hope that gets through it's the same God but he just takes on another Veil see he puts on another Veil he did it in the reformers taken on a veil taken on a veil until finally it come down through the Lutheran age down through the other age then finally it comes out into complete that's the age we live in just before it comes a prophet arises again what it does it foreshadows the word showing back here revealing what's been done what's been left off that the church will be not without understanding then when this Fades out then like John said I must decrease he must increase then all in all comes into him he is fully manifested through Luther Wesley Pentecost agent on down on on down he is fully manifested you see come down just the manifestation God unfolding see yet notice now fulfilled in his promise for this day as they had so what is it it's God manifesting himself God unfolding down through time taking a veil and through that Veil doing his work and revealing himself and and brother Bram says like this that statement was so bold he said when the word was in Moses Moses was God to them but yet they could never worship Moses because Moses the flesh man was only the veil and you never worship the Veil it was the god that was in Moses amen it's been so hard sometimes for people to keep these things separated and because it's so hard to keep it separated people have they have failed on both sides amen because because it seems so extreme amen and it gets so close sometimes people make a mistake and worship the Veil and then that's idolatry there was a veil that separated the Shekinah Glory of God Amen from from the inner corn amen and you could go to that Veil knowing just beyond that Veil and you can see the Tabernacle with skins in the middle of Israel and all of Israel could know that God is right there where is God right there and you're pointing to a tabernacle but you're not thinking of the Tabernacle you're thinking of the god inside the Tabernacle but for Generations amen they would they would the children would say where is God dwell he dwells right there that's where God is he's right there amen but it wasn't the Skins it was the god inside the skins and you could see how when somebody's been pointed and pointed and pointed they can begin to worship the skins which is an absolute failure it's idolatry but because somebody has failed and worshiped skins there's another side that wants to distance themselves far on this side away from that truth as well and not get any close to it because they want nothing to do with idolatry but in doing so they forsake the very place of God and they will not witness to or identify with or recognize where God is working and so they stay away because they don't want to worship the veil but they won't even give the veil proper respect because you still had to honor that Temple take care of it not defile it amen you couldn't worship it but you sure couldn't disrespect it either see what a fine line amen so God was moving down through and it was God in the veil it was God and Noah and God and Moses and God and David and God and Jeremiah it's been gone through the reformers and Through the Ages and it's God today and he's still working through a veil let's go back to Exodus chapter 4. I just want to look at something that was of interest to me in the life of Moses we're just going to pick a couple more places and then move on Exodus chapter 4 verse 14. and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said is not Aaron the levite thy brother I know that he can speak well Moses was contesting with God giving excuses for why he couldn't go and be God's representation he couldn't go to deliver the children of Israel and so God gets angered and he starts telling talking about Aaron he says I know that he can speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and I will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what you shall do and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him instead of God Lord thou shall be to him instead of God he's saying I'm not going to talk to Aaron but you're going to be my representation and your mouth is going to take my words and you will be to Aaron instead of God instead of going to God God will be coming to Aaron through the lips of Moses you will be to him instead of God and thou shalt take this rod in thy hand wherewith Thou shalt do signs so God calls Moses and he equips him he gives him Aaron to be his mouth but but Moses is still the mouth of God he is still the mouthpiece of God he said I'll be with your mouth and you'll be the heir he'll be to you instead of a mouth but you'll be to him instead of God that's a pretty amazing statement in Exodus chapter 7 to hold your place in four we're going to come back to chapter four but look at chapter seven quickly Exodus chapter 7 verse 1. and the Lord said unto Moses see I have made thee a God to pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet so even the Pharaoh Moses was God made Moses a God to him amen so we see this principle we see this coming from the from the very mouthpiece mouth of God but I want to go back to chapter four chapter four verse 1. he goes and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the Lord hath not the Lord has not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him what is that in thy hand and he said a rod and he said cast It cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before him and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob hath appeared unto thee so go on tells Moses what's in your hand he said a rod a stick he tells him to cast it down and then he it works a sign with it and he says so that the children will believe that I'm with you there's this there's a sign of the rod and brother mentions this rod in the message it is I be not afraid he said Moses had a dry stick in his hand and Moses's hand it was nothing else but a stick that he had picked up perhaps on the desert but once when that hand of Faith taken a hold of that stick it became God's judgment Rod to the world that dry stick became the Judgment Rod remember Moses stretched the rod he stretched the rod Over the Sea he stretched it in the air it was God's judgment rod now there's a reason I'm going into this and we'll get to that in a second but if you can imagine that one day Moses the question is when did Moses pick up this rod was it and when he flew from Egypt it was at a rod that he had in Egypt did he pick it up along the way or did he get it when he became a shepherd and began to to watch over his father-in-law Jethro's flock the scripture doesn't tell us but you can use your imagination somewhere along the line he picked up this rod and for him it was a shepherd's Rod it was a rod I mean much like a walking stick and it was something that he he used in his daily life I got this and we found it who knows where it was fashioned out of who knows what amen but but Moses and Moses himself had needed it so when he needed it Moses himself had found it and he himself had picked it up and he himself had purposed it but now God is going to repurpose it okay and now I want to look at verse 18. Verse 18 chapter 4 verse 18 and Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law and said unto him let me go I pray thee in return unto my brethren which are in Egypt and see whether they be yet alive and Jethro said to Moses go in peace and the Lord said unto Moses and Midian go return unto Egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy life and Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod of God in his hand when did it become the rod of God Amen brother Benham said it was a dry stick that Moses found somewhere in the wilderness amen and Moses when he picked up that stick he didn't know it was the rod of God when he grabbed it when he grabbed a hold of it but yet there was something in Moses's life that God was going to use there was something predestinated about Moses Moses was calling for a specific work he was a specific chosen vessel and here Moses is just living life and in living life his hand he thought in his mind his hand just picked up a random rod and used it for his own purpose not knowing that what he was doing God was going to use because that Rod was the rod of God God will now take that old dry stick and use it for a sign now would be the rod that he holds over the waters to separate the waters it'd be the rod that strikes the rock that brings forth water it would be the rod that is held up in a great battle and as the arms are held up and the rod is held up there's Victory amen so this Rod becomes amazing Rod but what was it it was something in Moses's hand that he picked up of his own he thought thinking and for his own he thought desire but he didn't realize he was going to become a God he was going to come and represent God he was going to be the fleshly manifestation of God coming to deliver his people so Moses is Rod when Moses represented God became God's Rod because he was representing God amen so many things in the Bible are so amazing how Moses Rod could be called God's rod he took the rod of God it was the same Rod but now he himself had become a god he was the representation of God the veil that was veiling God as he was coming to deliver amen and in his hand now was God's Rod Moses wrought yes God's wrought yes was it Moses yes was it God and Moses yes were you looking at Moses or were you looking at God the answer is yes praise God amen you know the message says brother remember says how many knows that his physical body sits on the throne of God and his Spirit returned to the Earth to live in a church to energize it as a vine to the branches certainly then he has no hands but mine and yours he has no eyes but mine and yours it's amazing we'll see this as we go and we'll just keep moving but it becomes so evident as we move forward let's look together to Ephesians we're going to read quite a few scriptures here out of the New Testament so keep your Bibles handy but first we're going to go to the book of Ephesians Ephesians chapter 2. and verse 20. let's start at 19. now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the buildings fitly framed together growth into a holy Temple in the Lord and whom ye also are building together for a habitation of God through the spirit remember the title where is he where is he you are built together for a temple to the Lord you grew his whole house and you know you cannot say I am the Temple of the Lord but you are part of the Temple of the Lord you're one of the many stones but that doesn't change the fact that if you that if you are tabernacling deity amen if you've been born again by the spirit of God then God is in you amen and then God now is in the habitation in the habitation of God is the many membered body amen so it's the body of God the dwelling place of God the habitation of God Amen and where God has been working in and through flesh all along God is still working in and through flesh he is still veiled he's still tab or not going amen God the in the in the history of the Bible as we look down through the history of the Jews they have sought to have God in their midst amen and God made an allowance for that and they had a had a temple and or had a tabernacle and he had a temple and and all of these things was gone dwelling with them and they would know that the very presence of God is with them because God's behind those skins he's behind those Temple walls he's behind that Veil but it was just a representation it was representation of a greater truth amen because God is not just behind amen a certain veil in one location or a certain temple in one location but gone wants to dwell in his people God wants to stretch his tip further than that and he wants to stretch his tent with man let's look at Acts chapter 7 together foreign Acts chapter 7 verse 47. this is the the sermon that Stephen preached just before he was stoned Acts chapter 7 I'm going to begin in verse 47. but Solomon built him a house albeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my first or what house will you build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things so he's saying you know we can't foolishly think that we can build a physical structure that will contain all of God right God is far beyond all of that but God says he would make his presence known there it was a place where they could come in contact with God Amen and and we know that God was greater than their Temple God can't dwell in a house made with hands amen but God wants to dwell in a mini-membered body he desires to live he desires to dwell in flesh in this day in the flesh of his bride amen the body of Jesus Christ not in one location not in one person but in a mini-membered bride and I want to look at where this scripture comes from because uh Stephen is referencing a scripture out of Isaiah 66 so if you keep your hand here in Acts but go to Isaiah 66 I want to read this because it's it's interesting to me what he says next in Isaiah 66. Isaiah 66 verse 1. thus saith the Lord the heaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool where is the house that you built unto me and where is the place of my rest for all those things hath my handmade and all those things have been saith the Lord so that so far is pretty pretty much what Stephen quoted but the sentence is not over the thought is not finished he goes on to say he goes on to say but but to the man but to this man will I look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word what what house will you build me what what Tabernacle can I have I've made all of these things but I'll tell you this to whom will I look and this word look means to look to regard to pay attention to all that you build and all your structures and all this amen you can't contain me what house will you build me where's the place of my rest but immediately says to this man will I look to will I regard the one that trembleth out my word amen the one that is a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word that's where I'm going to focus my attention again in the unveiling of God brother man says notice then we then we become part of him as you are the veil that veils him you are part of him as long as Christ is in you as Christ was of gone because God was in him made him gone and as Christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of Christ he that believeth on me the works that I do that that I do shall he also see you become part of Christ as long as Christ is hid in you then it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he's in you you are templing Christ that's behind the veil the skin so now you're templing amen you've become a temple a house a a habitation a place for the spirit of Christ for the spirit of God and now you're templing Christ behind your skin now you're the veil praise be to God behind because of this Veil The Veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever now the veil becomes the problem like it always has been the veil becomes the problem Moses came as a veil and behind the veil was God coming to deliver his children but I mean that was a problem to the people that he was going to deliver it was a problem to Pharaoh in his court they couldn't recognize what God was doing because all they saw was the veil amen so he had so many signs and wonders to show to prove that there was something else behind the veil and they were still stumbling out the Veil the same thing's true in our generation gone a sin of Mighty prophet in our day and done Mighty signs and wonders to prove who's behind the veil so much so that he would turn his back to the crowd to show that the same sign that was showed Amen to Abraham on the plains of Moriah are shown here again and he did the exact same thing and in the and they stumbled at the Veil but he says now you are the Veil so where is he he's in you he said you're templing Christ that's behind the veil the skin let's go to First Corinthians chapter 6 together First Corinthians chapter 6 verse 19. what chapter 6 verse 19 what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own for you are bought with the price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods this body is God's and it's the veil that he's hiding behind it's the temple it says you know you're not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost if so be that you have the Holy Ghost living inside your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and so now your body has become the veil you are templing Christ that's behind the veil so where is he he's in you and and the Hebrews chapter 5 and the Hebrew series brother M said now his church is supposed to manifest God to show what God is that's what Moses was doing that's what the prophet in this day was doing that's what this church is supposed to be doing brother Brandon tells us a story of the little boy in the thunderstorm and he cries from Mama and he tells it here in the Mighty God unveiled before us he said Mama I believe every bit of that she's trying to calm him and tell him we're Christians and gods will take care of us and I believe every bit of that but when the lightning is so close he said I want a god with skin on it so I think not only Junior but all of us feel that way when we get together when we pray one for other god with skin on it and we find out here that God has always had skin on him when Moses seen him he had skin on him look like a man when God was behind the curtains he had skin on him and God tonight in his church is veiled in his church with skin on it and he is still the same God tonight we find that but now as ever the skin Veil is what catches the Traditions they just can't believe that is god making them people act like that it's because God is veiled in his church is skin on it that's right and he is hid from the unbeliever and revealed to the believer let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 12 now chapter 12 we'll read one verse verse 27. it says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular this is his body his flesh his skin the veil that he's hiding behind when brother Branham said I preached what Paul preached that's absolutely the truth we're just looking at what Paul's preaching and so Brothers tells us many times he quotes uh Jesus and it's out of John 20 and we won't turn there I'll just quote you John 20 21 it says then Jesus said unto them peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you so brother random references this many times and he said how did the father send him the father sent him by going in him so how does Christ send us he sends Us by going in us and that's how he sent the disciples he told them not to begin their Ministry he said but tear you in Jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high so they weren't to be able to go out and spread he told them you're the light of the world go into all nations and preach the gospel he gave him all of these instructions before they left but he was going to send them the same way the father sent him even on the day of Pentecost amen when he came back in the form of the Holy Ghost and divided himself into his Tabernacle now back behind veils then they were sent out in their commission amen he sent them the same way he himself was sent the father went in him now Christ comes in US and those disciples became the Veil that veiled him second Corinthians chapter 5. second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 18. I want to read a lot of scriptures this morning I hope that's okay just do a good old-fashioned Bible study preaching second Corinthians 5 18. and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation so Jesus Christ did the work of reconciliation but he had given to the disciples the ministry of reconciliation it was a continuation to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us now listen he's saying God is calling you with my lips this is what Paul is saying amen we are ambassadors for Christ we're here representing Christ an ambassador represents the Homeland Homeland so now he says we are ambassadors for Christ we are representing Christ as though God did beseech You by us God is talking to you by us amen so now as though God to beseech You by us we pray you in Christ's dead be reconciled to God they're saying we pray you we're in Christ's place or in in Christ that we're here instead of Christ we're here in the place he's in us we're here representing him as though God's calling to you by us we're here in the stead of Christ amen calling you to be reconciled to Christ if you knew who was behind this Veil and who was calling to you you would run because it's not Paul it's the life behind Paul it's the Christ that's in Paul that gave Paul the word it's not Paul's words it's not Paul's a Reconciliation it's Christ reconciliation now working through the mouth of Paul but the veil's always the problem pray you in Christ then be reconciled to God it's good now to Acts chapter 5. I'm just hoping that the picture becomes clear as we move more clear than it was a week ago or a month ago that keeps getting more and more clear Acts chapter 5 and it will begin in verse 12. acts 5 and 12 and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one Accord in Solomon's porch and of the rest there's no man join himself to them but the people magnified them and Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and of women sorry I'm in the wrong place oh I'm in verse 14. I want to skip down to verse 18. sorry and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in common prison but the angel of the Lord By Night opened the prison doors and brought them out I am not in the right spot no I'm I'm in the wrong spot oh no let's go back to verse 14. sorry every time this happens I wish I had some story behind it like brother branham's with the pages stuck together and I could come back and say that was the Lord that was fulfilled but no it's just me I can't find my place in the Bible it's because my Progressive bifocals are interesting all right let's read verse 14 again and the Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women and so much that they brought forth the sick unto the streets and laid them on the beds and couches that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them I don't know if that's amazing to you but that's amazing to me they begin to so recognize where God was working they became so convinced that God was with these men that their faith Rose to such a level that they would take their sick and Afflicted and lay it on the street by Chance the shadow not now even touching his body but the shadow that was cast by his body and we're talking about a body of Flesh we're talking about Flash The Flash that denied Christ just shortly before this the flesh that was an illiterate fisherman amen they may have had listen I'm sure many people have had uh Peter's Shadow pass over them at some point in their life if they lived in the same Village as Peter they probably touched him they probably took fish from his hand we weren't healed they weren't delivered but now he is there representing Christ because Christ is in him showing by signs and wonders where he's at in this day and their faith come to such a level that it wasn't even now touching that body but a shadow that would come because of the presence of the body they had enough Faith to stand up and be healed oh my goodness friends I I when when we go back and really think about the things that are in scripture they're absolutely mind-boggling they're be they're beyond understanding amen it's the same body of Flesh that was always there it was that was illiterate that couldn't sign his name on the bill of sale brother Venom was saying amen the same one that fished and sold fish and cursed and swore and all of these things that he did but now he is tabernacling deity in this same flesh man has been converted and now he's a representation of Jesus Christ and the people so see what's behind the veil that the Shadow from the veil Rises their faith to a place they can accept their healing and walk away that's the right kind of respect for the Tabernacle of deity you know I I just marvel at some of these things they begin to so see where God was it became so evident where the supernatural power of God was their faith came to a place where I don't even have to touch him but if a shadow passes over me it's amazing friends and the message the masterpiece remember I said some woman just made a remark coming the other day and said show me where the man has walked and let me walk behind him upon the ground said I'll get well there's some woman who come into Jeffersonville and brother Branham wasn't there and she said that's okay show me where that man walked and I'll walk where he walked and I'll get well you can call it fanaticism but it's like the book of Acts there was an understanding of what was behind the veil there was understanding of what God was doing in that day there was a respect and Brethren says now and the Brotherhood never condemn the woman for that he said now the people believed you like that and you're a representative of Christ then what should we do we should be very careful because you're not only destroying yourself with wrong you're destroying others who are following you that you know you're representing Christ and that that's what the people were recognizing but then you have to be careful now are we here to represent Christ then then we must also be careful with how we live and what we do let's look at Acts 19 let's turn over to Acts 19. Acts 19. verse 11. Acts 19 11 and God wrought special Miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body we're brought unto the sick handkerchiefs and aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them so this is the same man that was Saul and Saul was binding the Christians and having them beat and having them arrested and some were even killed this is the same flesh body but now he's become a temple he's become a he's now templing deity now Christ is on the inside of him and now he is so given himself over to the word he has become a representation of Christ in his day and now from the very body they would take from the body of Paul aprons and handkerchiefs and they would go lay them on the sick and the sick would become well just taking a garment an apron something that was attached to his body just taking that not him coming and laying hands on them not any of that but they they began to understand that God is with this man God is there Where's God he's there is that right where is God he's right there he's in them people he's in that Apostle he's in that Gifted Man there God's working right there and so from his very body they would take aprons and handkerchiefs from his body lay them on the sick and their faith was so high amen because they knew what was behind the veil amen listen there wasn't there wasn't power just in Paul's body the power lay in the faith of the people to recognize what was behind Paul I mean this isn't sorcery this isn't witchcraft amen it's Faith it's a recognition and understanding amen that God has that is tabernacling himself in that vessel and God's working we're there and that's where God's working and it was the power behind the veil amen that they were respecting but to me it just goes to show how close this runs how tight it really is that from his body that body was sin born from the shadow of Peter from a sunborne body amen it shows where God is in the message that ever present water from The Rock and the power that will raise us up is right in us now we are now in Heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out here and go live a private life on it you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you got power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are that's what power is in the church now but it is controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's a law of faith he said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place the soul of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you you see what I mean the power is controlled if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time so the power that will raise you where is the power that will raise you it's in you what is the word that we preach what is the word that we receive the word that we received amen is the word that is taking the veil off the power that's in you so you'll recognize what's inside of you because what's in you amen we recognize as a son or daughter of God that there is an attribute of Peace a portion a gene however brother bam said it something from God an eternal thought of God Eternal attribute of God is laying down inside of you amen but it's covered over in darkness and it needs the light which is the word to remove the darkness so that it can spring forth in life and manifest itself so the word that we received in this day is here to break away spiritual Amnesia depart the clowns amen so that the light can hit the seed so the life can come out because it's already there if you've got a shadow of the power of God if you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul and it's quickened to seed the life the power that will raise you up is already in you so where is he question brother M said and the message show us the father a woman said who did he pray to In The Garden of Gethsemane on a street meeting one time I said I want to ask you something you testify you had the Holy Ghost where is it at what do you pray to it's on the inside of you of course well we have the spirit with measure he had it without measure we are Sons and Daughters of God by measure like taking a spoonful of water out of the ocean and he's the whole ocean but the same chemicals that's in the spoon is in the whole ocean it's quantity but this is it's quantity but the same quality therefore Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever God is in US said that portion you got when when Christ came as the pillar of fire and broke himself up on the day of Pentecost and portioned himself out amongst the body now if you take a spoon into the ocean brother I'm showing us an analogy when you take that spoon out you don't have the whole ocean but whatever's in the ocean is in the spoon the same quality the same chemicals the same minerals the same of everything amen and we may not say I'm all of God no man can say that only Jesus Christ can say that amen but they're whatever was in him is in me in portion praise God but I've always thought how much God does it take to do Supernatural things how much God does it take maybe a spoonful maybe that's enough now now I want to I laid all that down to get to really what was on my heart this is the I'm going to read you the um quote that brother Abraham sent me and asked me and and the day he asked me I had not a not a clue in my mind how to help him uh and I don't even know that needs help but I mean I couldn't do anything but this is a 1963 out of the message Spirit of Truth he said and then from then on 600 miles the way the crow flies he's talking about going up where he hunts with Bud Southwick and them up there 600 miles away the crow flies there's not even a path or a trail when you hit the West Coast you go about 800 miles to Vancouver there's not even a speck of civilization and the next civilizations going this way is Anchorage about seven or eight hundred miles go back this way you run into the little city yellow line where you get a ship in there once a year for the eskimos and next you hit Russia so you're really to yourself that's what brother remember said no this is the next part that's where God can take his rest up there from all of our troubles and trials that we've put him into so I like to go up there and talk to him when he's resting you see now brother van was going way off into the Wilderness and he's showing you how far away it is from everywhere and he says that's where God can take his rest up there from all of our troubles and trials that we put him into so I like to go up there and talk to him when he's resting and brother Abraham said what do you think he means I said I don't know but I started meditating on it and it just it wouldn't never leave me you know sometimes somebody says something it just won't ever leave you it's there you don't have an answer you don't have a clue what it means but it just never leaves you so I started asking myself a question is there one place on the map a vacation place for God is there a certain spot where God goes to God's a spirit and he encompasses space and time he's a spirit but he says that's the place where God can go take a rest from All the Troubles and trials we put him into and so I started thinking if there is a location where God goes the rest then I want to get with Billy Paul and and brother biscoll and I want to find out where I want the pinpoint prick where did you camp where was your Trail how did you hike in how did you hike out because I want to go to that place if there's a place that you know God goes to do you want to go there then the next thing that he says is I like to go up there and talk to him when he's resting so then I think maybe he's not always there so now not only do I have to find the place in the middle of the wilderness but I have to know when God will be there but if there was a place that God would be and there was a time he would be there would you try to be there if you knew God was going to be in this spot at this time I would do all I can to get there so I started thinking about this and no God doesn't have a particular spot but I started asking myself what was the prophet doing the prophet was going to find rest why from All the Troubles and trials that the people put him into when did he know to go when he got tired how did he know God would be there how did he know where the place was it's like he just kind of found it and how did he know the time that God would be there but when the prophet got tired from the ministry and we realized it wasn't his ministry it was Christ in him but when he got tired from the troubles and trials that people put him in he wanted to run up there where nobody was so that he could have a time of rest and lo and behold who should be there when he gets there but God himself to comfort him and talk to him how did God get there how long was he there did he have a cabin there was there a tent was there a marker on the tree no he that is in you amen where was he he was in that Prophet when that Prophet was going to take his rest this is just brother Chad I can't say that for sure but that's the way I see it in the light of the scriptures and the word we're looking at that he was in that little man and when that little man needed to take a rest God was resting with him because God promised to never leave you more forsaking amen and when God was there resting was there no more God helping the rest of his children all over the Earth was God resting from all his works and nobody was healed during that trip nobody was praying to God and getting it delivered he realized God was there with the prophet resting but he was also with another one of his children doing whatever that child was doing and he was with another one doing whatever if it was Ministry he was ministering it was preaching he was preaching he was praying it was mothering of his father and amen if it was resting God was with his children amen God has veiled himself and flashed and attached himself to his children and when brother Branham needed a rest and he needed to get away from the people and he ran up there for a rest who should he find up there but God doing the same thing taking a rest amen this so began to encourage me because when I need to find God when I need to get in touch with God where am I going to go when I need an answer from God when I need to come in contact with the Living God when I need to meet him face to face because I have such a need I need an answer where am I going to go am I going to try to go to Northern British Columbia and find the spot on the map and predict what time he'll be there am I going to run to some church somewhere or some Minister somewhere where am I going to go when I need to find God Amen the god I need is the god that's in me maybe what I need to do sometimes is get away from all the noise amen and separate myself from All the Troubles and trials that are going on and get quiet and find some rest and find hey lo and behold God's here resting too and brother bam says I like to go up there and talk to him when he's resting whatever brother Ben what was he looking for he was looking for a break a rest getting away from the troubles and and communing with God Amen God was there communing with him and the question is how did God get there did he fly up there did he I would say that wherever brother Branham was going God was in route to that place when he was riding in a car with brother bisco he was going when they when they got the brother Ed's uh Bud southwick's house he was there in Bud southwick's house amen then when they got on Horseback to go further in God was on horseback do you understand what I'm saying he's with you the power you need to Rise Above This World is in you now if you have a shadow of the power of God everything is possible amen we need to quit running all over trying to find something what we need to do is get quiet and recognize who's inside who's here who's with us amen if you say I need a break I need to talk to God Amen then find a place where you can get yourself quiet and talk to God because God is with you Oh I thought I began to when I began to meditate on this I thought if there was such a place we would build a camp that would be a Minister's retreat and we would all go in fact you you couldn't find a booking it'd probably be booked out years in advance but I thought that doesn't match the scripture that's not what he taught us I believe when God was taking his rest he was taking his rest in that prophet and while he was resting in that prophet he was still working in others let's go to John chapter 14. I want to read a few more scriptures John chapter 14. verse 18. I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you he said he was going to go to the father and ask the father to send a comforter but now he's promised to be the comforter and he says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father and I and ye and me and I in you where is he he's in his believing child and he promised to be what what was he going to be he was going to be a comforter he said I will not leave you comfortless I'll send somebody else no I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you and in that day you'll know that the father is in me you and me and I in you where is the comforter he's in you when you need comfort there's no reason to go running around all over the place the comforter he's promised to be in you in the uniting time and signs brother bam says the world become the word becomes you and you become the word Jesus said at that day you know what all the father is I am and all I am you are and all you are I am can we can we can we take that in and soak it in just a minute can I read that one more time all right all the father is I am all I am you are all you are I am so where is the I am he's in his people in that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father and me I in you and you and me see at that day what day this day we find out the great hidden mysteries of God being revealed you see why this Revelation at the end time the great mystery of God being revealed under the seventh seal begins to kill the denominational influence because now I don't need the church to find God God's in me and it doesn't mean that God doesn't use the church it doesn't mean God's not using a body of people we can never disregard any of that but there was a false concept that if I align myself with the right church or the right theology or the right denomination then I was aligning myself with God and I would be fine but now the the revelation of the hour is that that he that's in you amen the revelation of the hour is that God Amen wanted to be a family and God portioned himself out over time his attributes and he was bringing attributes to Life by the word but in the end time he brought the fullness of the word to display the full attribute of a bride of Jesus Christ and in that Revelation it's to the individual not to a group to kill the whole idea of denomination because I don't have to run a certain place to find God that at the seed of life in me has come to life by the Holy Ghost I can find God wherever I am because God is in me it was always there laying dormant it was always there remember when it sprung the life I began to realize it was there and now the word that's coming forth is washing me and cleansing me and moving everything out of the way so that this life in me can take preeminence in me and it can accomplish everything that needs accomplished from the life on the inside then we realize we're tabernacling deity we're templing Christ that we are the habitation of God we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost all of a sudden in every trial with every need with every great obstacle amen the the overcoming power is inside now in every great trial and through every great difficult circumstance you know when when Moses was leading the children of Israel out of Egypt he come into an possible situation in the impossible situation was the Red Sea and the Pharaoh's Army and all of this but but he began to cry out to God and God says why cry to me speak you're the vessel of the hour you're you're the one I'm using you're the one I called I'm working through you now you speak amen and he spoke and he held up the rod and the waters parted because God whatever whatever Moses needed God whatever the children of Israel needed Moses needed was going to come through that vessel that was God working in that day now God is working through a many-membered bride and God is working through these vessels but now when I when I come into trouble trouble sometimes if I come into difficult circumstances you know sometimes what we need to do is just hold steady and not run around and get paranoid and scared and running trying to solve problems but maybe we just need to hold steady and say you know if I have a shadow of the power of God there's enough power laying inside of me right now to speak worlds into existence and go live a private life on it but it's controlled by a law and that law is Faith and faith is not just an unanchored thing floating around but faith is solidly anchored in the word of God so now that power operates by faith and faith is founded on God's word so now when I come into a difficult situation I know the power lays there ready to be Unleashed to solve the problem but what will unleash it will be when I have faith on the word of God so what do I need I need to hear the word of God faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God and when God quickens that word to me Faith Rises the power is already there to believe it and whatsoever you believe you can have praise God this ends the whole idea of group therapy group think group group group because now Moses didn't have a group it was him and God when David faced Goliath he didn't have a group some of the trials that we Face we don't have a group we thank God for Fellowship we gain strength from fellowship one another we encourage one another we're supposed to be connected with the body of Christ we're not supposed to be disconnected we're supposed to be connected but we have to realize that that what God wants to accomplish in my life he has put something in me to believe his word he can do it I don't need the I don't need to act like I've lost my mind and forgot who I was but I can stop and say God I need a little rest I want to find you where you're resting and talk to you for a minute I have some needs and I I have no place else to go but I believe that greater is you that's in me than he that's in the world that none of these circumstances surrounding me can overpower the life on the inside sometimes we just need to go find him where he's resting away from the troubles and tribulations that people put them into and go to talking to him we talk to everybody else why don't we talk to him you know let's learn to Matthew 28. Matthew 28 verse 18. and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go you therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am with You alway even to the end of the world there was these times that these disciples were alone they didn't all go 12 at a time but they would go to different parts in different areas and Philip was in Samaria doing something and someone else was somewhere else and but they had a promise go I am with you always even to the end of the world no matter what dark kernel corner of the world they would find themselves in whether in a prison cell or a king's Palace standing before Agrippa or or before Caesar's Court he was always there he promised he would be you know there's times that we feel all alone is there any time you ever feel all alone forsaken abandoned with with no power to overcome and nothing you feel completely alone many times when you've had agonizing prayer in the night there's nobody you can call or nobody can come to your your by yourself but the reality is you're not by yourself the reality is we've never been forsaken we've never been for abandoned and we've never been alone those are only feelings and the feelings are real in a certain realm they're real but in another realm they're not real only in your spirit realm where they're real that's the only place that they exist because those feelings don't exist anywhere else they only exist in your own personal Spirit Realm right and those feelings can shut us down so much but they're they're very temporal they're real in that world but they're not real in the word of God Amen because the word of God's not looking at how we feel about a thing it's looking at the reality of it and the reality is there's no weapon formed against these that shall prosper I will be with you always even to the end of the world we have so many promises I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you we have a comforter we have a power we have we have a living God that's with us we need to sometimes look past the temporal things and deal with them of course deal with them you can't you can't make believe that they're not there when you feel alone you can't pretend I don't feel alone but you have to confess the word and says I am not alone it's amazing how powerful it is just to confess the word of God remember the power of God's word was a spoken word sometimes we just have to take the word of God and put it on our lips when we're feeling all alone and isolated and like nobody knows the struggle we're going through and you can say God you promised to be with me always even to the end of the world and I'm not alone because you're my comfort and you've promised to come and comfort me and you'd be surprised at how powerful it is just to speak the word because it brings us back to reality the false reality begins to diminish and the true reality begins to take over when we speak the words of eternal life that are always true amen let's go to Psalms 139. this is the scripture that brother Elmer mentioned to me he made a statement and this is the other thing that sparked this whole thought these things come together here Psalms 139 verse 7. Psalms 139 and 7. wither shall I go from thy Spirit or wither shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost part of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me my goodness think about this statement this is the one that Elmer mentioned to me this one verse this part said um let me find it here yeah in verse 8 if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there why because a child of God is always a child of God and there's an attribute of God that's with that child of God and you can never get away from it and he says that David says do I make my bed in hell you're there you know when when Abraham Abraham was called of God Amen and he called to go out of the land of the Chaldeans and and into the what would be the promised land into the land of inheritance amen and as he was moving brother bear says God was watching everywhere he went God never stopped watching Abraham even when Abraham didn't immediately obey and go straight to the land God was still there even when he was in the land amen God was there even when he left the land contrary to the word of God and went down to Egypt God was there so think about this God's word put him in the land Abraham's reasoning in a time of famine took him out of the land so what did Abraham do he left the word and he went down into Egypt and he left the word and went into Egypt but while he was in Egypt it wasn't as though God forsook him God couldn't forsake Him He was a seed Gene of God God delivered him because God was there and knew watching over him delivered him and brought him back to the word sometimes we've seen people leave the word or we ourselves have left the word in one way or another and you think well that's it they're gone they're never gone if God is with them amen if they've been predestinated and they have a sieging of God on the inside God was watching over them before they ever believed the word God is watching over them through every mistake it doesn't mean he won't chastise them they won't suffer for it but God is never going to lose himself [Applause] and when Abraham left the word God didn't leave Abraham he may have he may have got punished for it he may have got chastised for it but he wasn't going to say well there you go buddy I was going to take care of you but I'm not going to take care of you anymore I was going to make a prospered Nation out of you no he was there watching over him protecting Sarah making sure that that wound was protected because it was the word watching over Abraham making sure he wasn't killed amen he was bringing plagues into the house of pharaoh he was working with a disobedient sign to bring him back into the land I'm so thankful that God's been watching me I didn't have power to watch over myself I didn't have the ability to always make right choices in fact in myself in this Veil that God's tabernacled in is all kinds of wrong desires and wrong thoughts and deceptions and self-deception that would get me a million miles away from right so it's not the veil that we can put any stock in but it's God behind the veil that's constantly correcting us and bringing us back in line because he promised to never leave us or forsake us he's promised amen that he would watch over us he's promised that he would bring us to an expected end suffer yes chastisement yes suffering for our wrongs absolutely reaping what we sow without a doubt but he's not going to forsake us he's going to bring us back David's saying there's no place I can go to hide from you Abraham couldn't hide in Egypt he couldn't hide in garage there's no place that we can go to hide from God when brother Branham went hundreds of miles from any civilization you found God there how did he get there amen amen praise be to God to God in the jail cell he was with Paul and Barnabas he was in jail when he stood in the courts of king of grip or Felix and Agrippa God was there when he stood in the court of Caesar God was there when he was on a ship as a as a a soldier uh not a soldier but as a prisoner on a prison ship Bound for for for Rome God was there amen no matter what you've been through God is there if you're a child of God if God's attribute is in you God has been watching over you all your life he knows the way you take and when you're tried you shall come forth as gold let's go to Psalms 23. Psalms 23 verse 1. the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thyroid and thy staff they comfort me you know David wasn't Fearless because he was Brave he wasn't Fearless because he was mighty he was Fearless because he knew God was with him he was Fearless because he knew the shepherd was leading him and he knew the shepherd was with him amen and that's what made him not fear it wasn't anything to do with David it was had everything to do with the Shepherd that was shepherding David and listen there's nothing that we need to be afraid of whether it be sickness a diagnosis from the doctor a a tragedy in life there even even the falling apart of governments or the collapsing of economies there is nothing that we need to be afraid of and though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we can fear no evil because he's promised to be with us it's his word amen he made the word we didn't he said it it's his reputation that's on the line not ours and if we have faith in what he said amen we can just walk knowing we can put our hand in his and he'll lead us right through I don't know what will happen tomorrow but I know that he already has a plan I don't know how to get from A to B I don't know how to navigate some of these obstacles but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he promised that he would be a comforter to me and he would never leave me nor forsake me it's gonna go to First John chapter 4. I just want to lay all these scriptures in because I want them to become pillars to us something that we never forget and they I want them to become for me living realities so first John I'm sorry first John not the Gospel of John but first John chapter 4. first John 4 and 4. year of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world is that the truth can you bank on it can you believe it in the face of every obstacle can you believe it in the face of governments and economies and can we always believe this let's go to Hebrews 13. Hebrews 13 and while you're turning there I'm going to read out of Deuteronomy 31 it's the scripture that Hebrews is referencing that Paul references in Deuteronomy 31 6 it says be strong and of good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the Lord thy God he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee this is the instruction that Moses is giving to the nation of Israel as they're about to go into the promised land and possess all the promised land that's given to them and Moses says be strong and of good courage fear not nor be afraid of them listen there were walled cities there was Giants there was everything there that you could be afraid of and these are not trained soldiers these are slaves that have come out been living now in a Wilderness without a City without a a fixed location for 40 years how organized could they be you know how militarily trained but yet in every battle God gave them victory and he says so this is the context that he's given this instruction be not afraid of them for the Lord thy God he it is that doth go with thee that's the key to everything is that he's with thee he it is that go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee now in Hebrews 13 Paul is writing now and he says in verse 5 let your conversation be without Covetous covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper I will not fear what man shall do unto me so Paul takes that whole um scenario where Moses is giving instructions and now he brings it right into the New Testament to the New Testament Church and he says because he's promised never to forsake thee then you can you can then so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me who's writing this the Apostle Paul is writing this who is this man that's writing this the man who has been beaten the man who has been Shipwrecked the man who has been stoned and left for dead the man who has been imprisoned and in Chains and has been held captive for years and now being taken to Caesar to stand trial amen and this is the man who would eventually be beheaded you know what he says I will not I can boldly say we will not fear what man can do to me because when Jesus stood in front of pilate pilate says don't you know that I have power to release thee or I have power to kill thee and he says you have no power unless it were given to you from above what a revelation Jesus could stand there knowing that God has orchestrated the whole thing and that he has a purpose to fulfill and nothing is going to disturb distract him from that purpose and if it means that he must go to a corporal punishment under the Roman system then there's no way to sort it that's what's going to happen but not because pilate has power but because God has allowed it and the same thing in our lives nothing is going to happen to us unless God has allowed it for his purpose and for our good so he will never forsake us brother Brown says in the message it is the rising of the Sun it says no wonder he said fear not for now notice we are Redeemed by him and now risen with him that's what Easter means to the people risen with him notice now we have his spirit in us the abstract deed fully paid it's amazing we have already Resurrected if somebody comes to you and says you know if you preach the gospel again I'm going to kill you you can say well you can't kill me and they may have the ability to pull the trigger but I've already have eternal life I can't die you see how Revelation is so much higher than what the world calls reality there's another reality that's greater than this reality this is the vapor this is the Mist when somebody threatens you you don't have to respond to the threat when they try to evoke fear you don't have to respond to the fear because I I'm not my own I'm bought with a price this very veil has been purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ and now God is templing himself inside nothing's going to happen to this if if you have power to do it then you should do it if you have power to do it then you should do it because that means God's allowed you but if God has another purpose for this vessel God will stop you that's what Easter means now we have a spirit in us the abstract deed fully paid no you don't say well I hope I make it you've already made it not I will make it I've already made it listen you you can't even say I know I'm gonna make it you've already made it that terminology is not even necessary anymore amen because it's not something that's going to happen it's something that has happened and what has happened we'll show forth and declare itself because it's already happened it's not something we're pressing to it's something we're resting on right we're not pressing to the change in the body we're resting on the fact that he's already resurrected me out of the deadness of sin and trespasses have said I've already come to New Life in Christ Jesus I'm not pressing I'm resting amen I'm not pressing for salvation I'm resting upon the work that he did at Calvary for me it's already done now you don't say well I hope I make it you've already made it he said you don't say I will make it I've already made it I never made it he made it for me see not me him well brother Brandon they say I don't care what they say there he made it for me that's all I want I'm I'm caring about I just want to see him manifested now this is what he says I want you to listen carefully this I just want to see Memphis do you want to see me manifested is that our calling in this day to let Christ be manifest through us he said I just want to see you manifested he said how do you do it call him down no he's in you the manifestation is in you the power to live the word is in you amen it's not calling him down remember when the the disciples were in the ship being tossed about and the Raging Waves in the storm and they begin to fear for their lives amen Jesus was in the boat he was in the boat he was sleeping Amen in the boat and and brother bam preaches a message called wake go wake Jesus amen and showing that the solution was already in the boat with them they didn't need any outside force or outside help the help that they needed was with them he was in the boat amen God's called us to manifest his very life where will I go to do it the power is already in me the life is already in me I just need to get myself out of the way and quit thinking my own thoughts and stay focused on his word and release him release my own thinking and allow his thinking to come forth the manifestation is already inside so you know when Jesus was in the boat the the disciples were safe but they didn't feel safe the disciples were secure but they didn't feel secure because that wasn't the time for Jesus to be crucified he had to live and besides he said let's get in the boat and go to the other side so if he said let's get in the boat to go on the other side that boat's going to the other side they were secured by the word and although they were safe although they were secure everything in their senses told them they were not safe and they were not secure the waves coming over the ship the bailing that they were doing maybe the sale was torn maybe they were already weak and tired I mean it was black and they couldn't see anything everything declared to them that they were in trouble amen but the proof that they were not in trouble was in the boat listen sometimes it looks like we're in a whole heap of trouble it looks like everything's falling apart and I don't know how to put the pieces together but all you need to know is is he in the boat is he in the boat if he's in the boat then I'm just going to go wake Jesus where is he where do you find him he's in the boat with you he's in your boat amen and the storms rage he never said there wouldn't be storms but he said he would be with us all the way to the end of the world see now here's here's what he says I want to read read what the prophet says I want to see him manifested now how can you do it call him down no he's in you see he's in you well the Lord if I can get myself out of the way you can manifest how can you do it because he ordained it so amen sometimes God needs trials for manifestation so in order for God to prove himself a Healer in your life you need to be sick so the sickness was never to destroy you but to manifest Christ there's many things in life in order for there to be a manifestation there must be a difficult situation and Christ was manifesting himself all the time through difficult situations so was the prophet of God and so are you and I Christ will manifest himself through our difficult situations if we can just remember I have some promises he's promised to never leave me nor forsake me but to be with me to the end of the world he's promised to be my comforter he's promised to never forsake me and I believe him and then when we remind ourselves of the reality then faith takes charge and begins to master the circumstances I want to read one last quote musicians if you'll come Blake if you'll make your way up I'm going to read this quote out of the rising of the Sun it says we shall rise in him we become part of him the Easter the revealed Secret Of God like it was then of life after death we are now alive who were once dead in sin and trespasses the true Easter seal has broken death from around me and I'm alive the Easter seal at the beginning broke the Seal of the Roman seal the Easter seal that he was sealed up and man when they died was gone but he broke the seal and revealed the secret and now God by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and Christ is revealed as he lives in US for now we are quickened with him let's all stand the Holy Spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and now Christ is revealed as he lives in US amen where will I find him what city will I run to what altar will I bow out where will I find him he's promised to be with you he's promised to be in you he's promised to never forsake you I mean you can no more get away from him than David could get away from Dave said if I go here you're there if I go to heaven if I make my bed in hell if I fly to the ends of the Earth you're there I can never get away from you amen he's watching over us because he he is linked to us he's living in US amen he's wanting to live through us we can trust him where is where is he he's behind this Veil behind this Veil and he wants to live his life in this Veil let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus I thank you Father for your word God if we can see how you were in Moses see how you were in Paul and Peter Philip we saw what you did and delivered them and cared for them we see all that you've done Lord help us to recognize that we stand in the same position [Music] that we are a vessel a tabernacle that you want to live in and not just live in you want to manifest yourself through help us Lord to recognize that it's this body of Flesh Lord you could you could use the body of Peter you could use the body of Philip you could use the body of Paul so much so that they would take aprons and handkerchiefs from his body and people would have faith and be healed oh God if you could use them men you can use us before we release ourselves we just commit ourselves to you Lord and lay ourselves down at your feet we're asking you to take these vessels of clay and manifest yourself through forgive us Lord for all the worry and all the anxiety and all the fear God I pray that your word would begin to diminish those things that your word would take over and Conquer every circumstance Lord you're in the ship I pray that you would help us just to realize you're there and call upon you to wake you onto the scene oh there's anybody struggling with fearful circumstances I pray that you put Faith in their heart that the word would go and release their Faith Lord to overcome that circumstance they would realize Lord that you're working a work Lord and though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we shall fear no evil for you are with us help these to be more than Sunday school verses we memorized or things we've heard but let them become living realities to us in this end time may we find you whereversoever we go may we know you're present with us in every circumstance may we recognize that you're here Lord I pray you would use these vessels of clay For Your Glory these physical bodies may they be the veil that you're working behind May the light shine forth and may others find their way to you through these Tabernacles we love you God we ask your blessings over your people and over your word help us to manifest it and live it we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen like there is a source in times of
