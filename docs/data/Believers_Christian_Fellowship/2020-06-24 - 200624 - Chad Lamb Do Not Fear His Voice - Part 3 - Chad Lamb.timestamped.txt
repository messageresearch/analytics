[4:01] praise the lord did you come to receive
[4:03] from him today
[4:04] come to worship the lord
[4:06] praise his holy name oh god bless you
[4:08] it's good to be here this evening while
[4:10] we're standing let's just take our
[4:12] bibles and read together out of second
[4:14] corinthians
[4:16] 2 corinthians chapter 3.
[4:28] this is uh we're going to continue on
[4:30] with the same thought this would be part
[4:32] three of do not hear do not fear his
[4:34] voice
[4:35] and i'm gonna maybe do just a little bit
[4:37] of review we're gonna read a couple of
[4:39] the same quotes go through the same
[4:40] scripture and then move forward
[4:42] i didn't didn't expect to continue on
[4:45] this far in this subject but it just
[4:46] keeps opening and opening and that's the
[4:48] way we like it amen we like it when he
[4:50] does it different than what we expected
[4:52] amen
[4:53] and so
[4:54] let's look at second corinthians 3 and
[4:56] 12.
[4:59] seeing then that we have such hope we
[5:01] use great plainness of speech
[5:04] and not as moses which put a veil over
[5:06] his face that the children of israel
[5:08] could not steadfastly look
[5:10] could not step fast they look to the end
[5:12] of that which is abolished but their
[5:14] minds were blinded for unto this day
[5:16] remaineth the same veil untaken away in
[5:18] the reading of the old testament which
[5:20] veil is done away in christ
[5:23] but even unto this day when moses is
[5:25] read the veil is upon their heart
[5:27] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[5:29] lord the veil shall be taken away
[5:31] now the lord is that spirit and where
[5:33] the spirit of the lord is there is
[5:34] liberty
[5:36] so
[5:37] what is true liberty
[5:39] when the veil of the heart is taken away
[5:41] we've come into christ in the veil of
[5:44] misunderstanding the veil of darkness of
[5:47] of denominational understanding
[5:49] traditional understanding when the veil
[5:50] is taken away that is real liberty
[5:53] because it frees us to be who we've
[5:54] always been intended to be
[5:57] so that's true liberty
[5:59] now verse 18 but we all with open face
[6:02] that means unveiled face but we all with
[6:04] open face beholding us in a glass the
[6:06] glory of the lord are changed into the
[6:09] same image from glory to glory even as
[6:12] by the spirit of the lord
[6:14] and let us bow our heads and read i pray
[6:17] lord jesus we thank you for what you've
[6:19] done for us lord and we're looking
[6:21] forward to what you will do lord and
[6:23] we've come tonight with great
[6:24] expectation in our hearts just to feed
[6:27] from your hand
[6:28] we pray lord that you would break the
[6:29] bread of life to us lord this evening
[6:32] that you would speak through these lips
[6:33] of clay your eternal words and help us
[6:36] lord to perceive all that it is you're
[6:38] trying to speak to us in this hour that
[6:40] we might live this word that you're
[6:42] giving to us
[6:43] we ask that you would find welcome in
[6:45] this place that you would take
[6:46] preeminence and you would be glorified
[6:48] in all we say in jesus christ's name we
[6:51] pray amen you can be seated now if we
[6:54] look at this last verse here
[6:57] it says but we all with open face
[6:58] beholding us in a glass the glory of the
[7:00] lord are changed into the same image
[7:02] from glory to glory even as by the
[7:05] spirit of the lord so now
[7:08] we need this open face we need this
[7:11] unveiled face
[7:12] for the for the veil to be taken away so
[7:15] that we can behold him amen and see him
[7:18] as he is so now you can see how
[7:20] important it was for the opening of the
[7:23] seals because those seals were christ
[7:26] and it was sealed up and sealed up the
[7:28] book and the book was christ as the
[7:29] revelation jesus christ so you can see
[7:31] how that veil had to be rent amen in the
[7:34] veil of our heart has to be rent so the
[7:36] veil on christ on the bible by tradition
[7:39] has to be rent the veil in our heart has
[7:41] to be read so that we can see him face
[7:43] to face
[7:45] and if we can see him face to face then
[7:48] we are changed into the same image that
[7:50] we're beholding and so that's why it's
[7:53] so important that we're looking at the
[7:55] right thing because if we're not looking
[7:57] at an open book we can never be changed
[8:00] into the image of the seventh seal
[8:02] we can never be changed into the image
[8:04] of christ if christ is still veiled so
[8:07] it had to take a prophet coming in this
[8:09] day christ himself came through a
[8:10] prophet to take the seals off the book
[8:13] to open the book to unveil the book to
[8:15] take the veil or the covering off of the
[8:18] book so that we could see christ amen
[8:20] and then by the spirit take the veil off
[8:23] of our heart so we can behold him face
[8:25] to face
[8:26] so that we can become what we're seeing
[8:31] so we we realized
[8:33] that god had to do this work and why did
[8:35] god do this work so that we could become
[8:37] what we're beholding
[8:40] brother brahman says in the unveiling of
[8:42] god from 1964 the veil has been lifted
[8:45] off the word that's right it's revealed
[8:47] to babes it's lifted they see it and
[8:50] will be that's right then it will be as
[8:53] once said when you see
[8:55] when this veil is take off the word the
[8:57] traditions is taken off the word as
[8:59] jesus once said when you see me you see
[9:02] the father
[9:04] oh boy that just took on a whole new
[9:06] meeting didn't it when you see me you
[9:08] see the father amen because they're one
[9:10] and the same but you have to see him
[9:12] when the veil of tradition is taken off
[9:14] of the word you see him and when you see
[9:16] him you see the father
[9:19] amen
[9:21] and god and his word is one now you
[9:24] understand
[9:26] amen i pray that we understand more and
[9:28] more and more
[9:30] let's turn to the book of galatians and
[9:32] look at galatians chapter four together
[9:41] galatians chapter 4
[9:44] and verse 19.
[9:47] paul the apostle speaking in and he
[9:49] makes this statement in
[9:51] chapter 4 verse 19
[9:53] my little children of whom i travail in
[9:55] birth again until christ be formed in
[9:58] you
[9:58] so paul was going through birth pains he
[10:01] was trying to bring forth something and
[10:04] so he was laboring again in travail
[10:06] travail is in birth and he
[10:09] he's travailing again through another
[10:11] birth pain with the galatians and what's
[10:13] he trying to do he's travailing in birth
[10:17] until christ be formed in you so what
[10:20] was the goal of paul's ministry what was
[10:22] paul trying to do he was laboring in
[10:25] birth trying to bring forth christ but
[10:29] how would he bring forth christ when
[10:31] christ was formed in the church amen
[10:34] that's what he was laboring to bring
[10:36] forth christ formed in you
[10:41] amen now you see how paul laid a
[10:43] cornerstone brother branham would bring
[10:45] the capstone of the same thing
[10:49] do we understand now brother branham he
[10:52] he he may not he may not be quoting
[10:55] scripture when he's preaching but he's
[10:56] always preaching the scriptures
[10:59] so don't don't ever be mistaken when
[11:01] brother bam says something no matter how
[11:03] odd it sounds and no matter how it
[11:05] sounds like i've never heard this
[11:06] statement before i've never heard it
[11:08] this way you rest assured he's always
[11:10] preaching the scriptures
[11:12] and he may be phrasing in a way you've
[11:14] never heard a phrase or using an
[11:16] application that you never thought it
[11:17] used but he's always preaching the
[11:19] scriptures and paul was travailing in
[11:22] birth until what until christ be formed
[11:26] in you amen and we know that the church
[11:29] had gone through seven church ages to
[11:31] come back to the same spot where finally
[11:35] christ is going to be be formed in the
[11:37] bride and it will be the it'll be it'll
[11:40] be the bride coming of christ or jesus
[11:43] christ coming in the formation of the
[11:44] bride christ formed in you
[11:48] the same thing paul was preaching
[11:51] praise be to god
[11:53] so i want to go back through this quote
[11:55] proving his word we read this last time
[11:57] it's lengthy but i'm going to take my
[11:58] time and read it so we can fully grasp
[12:01] it it says now remember that was not
[12:03] jesus talking to abraham there that
[12:05] could discern the thoughts of sarah's
[12:07] mind behind him that was not jesus he
[12:09] had not yet been born but it was a man
[12:11] in human flesh now brother brahm didn't
[12:13] say it wasn't christ
[12:18] he said it wasn't jesus
[12:22] because jesus hadn't been born yet
[12:25] do you understand
[12:27] it's been the same thing all the way
[12:29] through christ the word made manifest
[12:31] christ the word made manifest christ the
[12:32] word made manifest amen but that that
[12:36] christ was going to get a name when he
[12:38] took on an earthly vessel and when all
[12:40] of that was poured into one earthly
[12:42] vessel that vessel was given a name and
[12:45] earthly name of jesus amen that's why
[12:47] now all the family in heaven and earth
[12:50] is named jesus
[12:52] all right and that becomes the name of
[12:54] god when god took on flesh he took on a
[12:56] name and that became his name and now
[12:59] just like when the woman in the garden
[13:01] of eden her name was adam
[13:05] right her name was adam she didn't have
[13:07] her own name amen and christ was god
[13:10] didn't have his own name
[13:13] all the redemptive names of jehovah of
[13:15] jehovah the old testament is jesus
[13:17] christ of the new testament so all those
[13:19] titles was christ what god was called
[13:21] christ was called it's the same thing do
[13:23] you understand but then that woman after
[13:25] that woman fell she was given a name eve
[13:28] and so now we use that name eve
[13:30] retroactively
[13:33] you see what i'm saying so you say in
[13:35] the cool of the evening when god came
[13:36] down he spoke to adam and eve at that
[13:39] time he didn't he spoke to adam male and
[13:41] female
[13:44] you understand
[13:45] but now after she's got a name we attach
[13:48] that name to the dispensation all the
[13:50] way back and say that was adam and eve
[13:52] and there's nothing wrong with saying
[13:54] that but you realize at that point back
[13:56] here she didn't yet have a name that's
[13:58] what brother branham is saying not that
[14:00] it's a different person
[14:03] once we get the name amen jesus christ
[14:06] now we we retroactively put it all the
[14:08] way back and that's why brother branham
[14:09] said if you if if you read every verse
[14:11] of your bible and don't see christ go
[14:13] and read it again
[14:14] and we know who that is and what his
[14:16] name is
[14:17] amen
[14:19] but it was a man in human flesh abraham
[14:21] called elohim the great almighty and
[14:23] jesus says as it was in the days of
[14:25] sodom now watch close in the days of
[14:27] sodom so will it be at the coming of the
[14:30] son of man when the son of man is being
[14:32] revealed so brother baby said as it was
[14:35] back then so will it be at the coming of
[14:37] the son of man when the son of man is
[14:40] revealed
[14:42] this is the coming of the lord
[14:45] at luke 17 30 when the son of man is
[14:47] being revealed
[14:49] and so he says not no more as church see
[14:52] not no more
[14:54] it's not the denominational system it's
[14:56] not the church anymore not no more
[14:58] church but the bride is called
[15:00] in that day the son of man will be
[15:02] revealed what to join the church to the
[15:05] head unite the marriage of the bride the
[15:08] bridegroom call will come right through
[15:10] this when the son of man will come down
[15:12] and come in human flesh to unite the two
[15:15] together
[15:17] hey amen
[15:19] so what was the point of the forerunner
[15:22] ministry when when the son of man would
[15:25] come down in human flesh the point of
[15:28] the ministry was to unite the two
[15:30] together and if we miss the uniting of
[15:33] the two together we miss the point of
[15:35] the ministry
[15:38] amen
[15:41] amen the church is to be the so he says
[15:43] the church has to be the word he is the
[15:45] word and the two unites together and to
[15:48] do that it will take the manifestation
[15:50] of the revealing of the son of man not a
[15:52] clergyman do you see what i mean it's
[15:55] son of man jesus christ will come down
[15:57] in human flesh among us and will make
[15:59] his word so real that it will unite the
[16:02] church in him as one the bride and then
[16:04] shall go home to the wedding supper amen
[16:06] she's already united see we go to the
[16:08] wedding supper not to the marriage
[16:12] amen it skips down he says but the
[16:14] rapture is going to the wedding supper
[16:16] when the word here unites with the
[16:18] person and they too become one and then
[16:22] what does it do then it manifests the
[16:24] son of man again not the church
[16:27] theologians the son of man the word in
[16:29] the church becomes one whatever the son
[16:31] of man done he was the word the church
[16:33] does the same thing
[16:35] now this is a really important quote
[16:38] because we realize that at the coming of
[16:40] the son of man you have the revealing of
[16:42] the son of man and the revealing of the
[16:44] son of man comes through a prophet amen
[16:47] that god comes down in human flesh and
[16:50] so makes the word real and live that it
[16:53] unites the two together because that's
[16:55] the purpose of the eliezer ministry is
[16:58] is to fetch a bride for isaac to unite
[17:01] the two together and that was the
[17:03] purpose but what was it to do it does
[17:05] that to do what to produce the son of
[17:08] man again
[17:11] so that we can't just take the son of
[17:13] man ministry and just put it on brother
[17:15] branham only because it came in brother
[17:18] branham so that we can make the word
[17:20] live and real to unite the headship to
[17:23] the body so that they could unite in an
[17:25] invisible marriage union so that it can
[17:28] produce the son of man again when the
[17:31] church and the word becomes one
[17:36] amen this is so important because with
[17:39] without without this understanding
[17:42] we put everything back on brother
[17:44] branham and totally rest in the fact
[17:48] that he fulfilled his portion
[17:51] and then it makes us feel good because
[17:53] we saw brother branham come out of the
[17:56] scriptures and fulfill his part of the
[17:57] word and i believe that so i'm fine
[18:02] but that's just the first step that's
[18:04] the step that comes to show the word to
[18:06] unite you with the headship so that now
[18:08] you become the expression of the word
[18:11] and we can't leave it back there with
[18:13] brother branham he did his part but that
[18:15] can't bring us satisfaction knowing that
[18:17] he kept all the word assigned to him
[18:19] that doesn't make us okay that came and
[18:23] he manifests that to unite us with
[18:26] christ so that now the son of man amen
[18:28] so it can produce the son of man again
[18:32] so that same life that was producing
[18:34] through brother branham is the same life
[18:36] that must be manifesting through the
[18:38] bride
[18:40] and if that's not happening leaning on
[18:43] the arm of brother branham or standing
[18:44] in the shadow of that prophet will not
[18:47] do any good because the purpose of that
[18:49] manifestation was to get you united to
[18:52] christ so that you you yourself as an
[18:56] individual and the word become one thing
[18:59] so that you become the living word for
[19:02] your generation
[19:05] that's a mouthful but it's the truth
[19:09] amen
[19:11] so so we get sometimes
[19:14] we sometimes we can get hung up in the
[19:17] wrong dispensation
[19:21] and we don't want to get hung up in the
[19:23] wrong dispensation
[19:25] because to be hung up in the wrong
[19:27] dispensation does not equal life it
[19:30] equals death
[19:33] do we understand what i'm saying
[19:37] praise be to god
[19:39] so just still reviewing just a little
[19:41] bit i want to read another two quotes
[19:42] and review and then move forward
[19:44] brother branham in the later scene
[19:46] church age from the church age books as
[19:48] a momentary consideration of church
[19:50] history will prove how accurate this
[19:52] thought is in the dark ages the word was
[19:54] almost entirely lost to the people
[19:56] but god sent luther with the word the
[19:59] lutheran spoke for god at that time
[20:02] but they organized and again the pure
[20:04] word was lost for organization tends
[20:06] towards dogma and creeds and not simple
[20:08] word
[20:09] so we like we said sunday
[20:11] the lutheran spoke for god
[20:15] so when you heard the lutheran's message
[20:18] you were hearing from god
[20:21] so to reject that message
[20:28] amen
[20:30] amen
[20:32] they could no
[20:34] when they went to creed and dogma they
[20:35] could no longer speak for god
[20:37] then god sent wesley and he was the
[20:39] voice with the word in his day the
[20:41] people who took his revelation from god
[20:43] became the living epistles read and
[20:45] known of all men for their generation
[20:47] when the method has failed god raised up
[20:49] others and so it has gone on through the
[20:51] years until the last day there is again
[20:53] another people in the land who under
[20:55] their messenger will be the final voice
[20:57] to the final age
[20:58] yes sir the church is no longer the
[21:00] mouthpiece of god it is his own
[21:02] mouthpiece so god is turning on her he
[21:04] will confound her through the prophet
[21:06] and the bride
[21:08] for the voice of god will be in her
[21:13] yes it is for it says in the last
[21:15] chapter of revelation verse 17 the
[21:18] spirit and the bride say come once more
[21:20] the world will hear direct from god as
[21:23] at pentecost but of course that word
[21:25] bride will be repudiated as in the first
[21:27] age
[21:29] oh praise be to god huge statement
[21:31] friends huge statement but once more the
[21:34] world will hear direct from god as at
[21:36] pentecost so when when when god when
[21:39] jesus christ returned to the church in
[21:42] the form of the holy ghost on the day of
[21:43] pentecost and broke himself up and put
[21:46] himself into flesh
[21:49] that's what was taking place at
[21:50] pentecost amen and they spilled out
[21:53] prophesying amen it wasn't it wasn't the
[21:57] fact that they were speaking in tongues
[21:58] that made him hear from god it was the
[22:00] fact that they were speaking the
[22:02] prophecy come alive in their day was
[22:05] them speaking for god that was the voice
[22:07] of god when they took the word when when
[22:09] peter took the word of joel and said
[22:12] this is that they were hearing from god
[22:18] and so so they heard direct from god as
[22:21] at pentecost when now the spirit of god
[22:25] was dwelling in a mini-membered body and
[22:28] they were giving out the word for that
[22:30] day they were hearing direct from god
[22:33] and he said once more the world were
[22:36] here for direct from god as at pentecost
[22:40] at pentecost was not a one-man ministry
[22:44] at pentecost was the life of jesus
[22:47] christ in his people and that is how the
[22:51] world will once more hear direct from
[22:53] god is at pentecost when god is now who
[22:56] was bottled and confronted jesus
[22:58] bottled and confined in jesus christ is
[23:01] now bottled and confined in his bride
[23:07] see
[23:10] see we get into trouble sometimes when
[23:12] we don't fully realize what's going on
[23:15] because we have a hard time sometimes
[23:17] grasping the gravity of the statements
[23:19] that brother brennan made because we
[23:22] when we talk about it in a general sense
[23:26] we understand it it's true but when we
[23:28] talk about it in a personal individual
[23:30] sense it seems too wonderful for me
[23:34] it seems too great to be possible be
[23:36] gone beyond realization beyond how how
[23:39] can this be and so we begin to let down
[23:42] in the revelation when we stop talking
[23:45] general and start talking specific and
[23:47] individual we start backing off of this
[23:52] instead when i say we all do it every
[23:54] one of us do it
[23:56] but we've got to come to the realization
[23:59] like brother bannon did he come to the
[24:01] point where he he knew what his ministry
[24:03] was and what part he was playing and
[24:05] wrought role he was playing amen in the
[24:08] opening of the seals that solidified the
[24:10] role that he was playing and he knew his
[24:12] position in the scriptures and he had to
[24:14] stand in that position
[24:17] so now we've got to come to the same
[24:19] revelation by the opening of the seals
[24:21] to us is what is our position who am i
[24:25] now stop saying who are we because this
[24:28] isn't the day of we the day of we died
[24:30] at the end of the laodicean church amen
[24:32] now we've moved into the bride age and
[24:33] it's not the day of we this is the day
[24:36] of who am i
[24:39] and if i could catch a revelation from
[24:41] the word of god of who i am and stay in
[24:45] that position there's power that comes
[24:47] from being in your god-given position
[24:51] but we fail so many times to manifest
[24:53] the power of god because we're so
[24:55] hit-and-miss on our position we're so
[24:57] one day in and one day out and someday i
[25:00] feel like it possibly could be and the
[25:02] next day i'm wondering if it could
[25:03] possibly be and we wonder why we don't
[25:06] have the overcoming power in our lives
[25:08] is because we've never settled down to
[25:10] take god at his word as he reveals it in
[25:12] our heart we keep dropping back to
[25:14] emotions and mental thinking
[25:19] we keep dropping back to how could it be
[25:21] possible i know my faults and i know my
[25:23] mistakes he chose you before you ever
[25:26] made a mistake and it's not tied and
[25:28] hinged to your mistakes it's tied to the
[25:31] will of god the purpose that was in him
[25:33] before the foundation of the world then
[25:35] if he can drop the revelation of your in
[25:37] your heart that you were there and
[25:39] you'll return there it doesn't matter
[25:41] the weaknesses the frailty it doesn't
[25:43] matter the inabilities we've got to stop
[25:47] looking through mental eyes at a natural
[25:49] condition and get back to looking at the
[25:52] revelation of his word and the word only
[25:55] but we still in our own personal lives
[25:58] are mixing the word of god with our
[26:00] intelligence and putting it together and
[26:02] bringing a hybrid life
[26:08] and we struggle to overcome and struggle
[26:10] to overcome and struggle to overcome
[26:12] it's because we're still hybrid in our
[26:15] thinking
[26:17] one day i take the word of god the next
[26:19] day i look at my condition
[26:25] until
[26:27] until we can take god at his word day in
[26:29] and day out day in and day out just take
[26:31] him out of his word let god be god let
[26:33] god sort it out let god figure it out
[26:35] let his power overcome i can't do it i
[26:38] never could do it i'll never be able to
[26:40] do it but i just take what he says and i
[26:42] say it's true
[26:44] and if you call me your virgin bride
[26:46] then that's what i am
[26:48] if you call me bright i'm bride amen
[26:51] i can't help it amen
[26:53] it's the title he gave me it's not the
[26:56] title i gave myself
[26:58] yes
[27:00] how do you know because a prophet come
[27:02] in the first seal and he said i no
[27:04] longer call you church i call you bride
[27:07] so that you understand and then you say
[27:08] well you know god is i know that applies
[27:10] to me because i believe what that man
[27:13] was saying i know who he is and i know
[27:15] he was talking to and when he come to
[27:17] the first seal he was speaking to me and
[27:20] i don't know if there's another person
[27:22] on the planet that those seals came for
[27:24] but i know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[27:26] that those seals came for me
[27:28] and that prophet is speaking directly to
[27:31] me to unlock the mystery inside of me so
[27:34] when he says i no longer call you church
[27:35] i call you bride i can say amen because
[27:38] i'm not reading that book for other
[27:40] people i'm reading that book for me
[27:43] [Music]
[27:46] and if
[27:48] if we can accept everything else the
[27:50] prophet says
[27:54] we can accept what he says about himself
[27:56] we can accept what he says about the
[27:57] future we can accept what he says about
[27:58] genesis we can accept everything that
[28:01] prophet said then what a disservice we
[28:03] do to that prophet when we can't accept
[28:05] what he said about you
[28:11] praise god
[28:13] god's going to have a mighty army
[28:16] that's raised up and operating by the
[28:19] word and the word only
[28:22] because the day that you feel miserable
[28:24] terrible wretched and no good you're
[28:26] still a son or daughter of god called to
[28:28] be the manifestation of the word in this
[28:30] day nothing changed in the mind of god
[28:32] the only thing that changed changing
[28:33] your spirit realm and your mind
[28:36] but nothing changed in god
[28:39] and we become fickle in our lives and
[28:42] inconsistent because we allow the
[28:44] hybridization of human thinking in the
[28:46] word to come together
[28:50] amen
[28:51] help us god to kill reasoning to cast
[28:53] down reasoning in every thought that
[28:55] exalted self against the knowledge of
[28:57] god
[28:59] and come to terms with what god said
[29:01] about us
[29:03] amen
[29:05] i'll tell you this
[29:06] just
[29:08] i know how it works because i've lived
[29:09] in flesh all my life
[29:12] i said on my earthly journey i'll say
[29:18] you could sit here and hear me preaching
[29:20] that
[29:21] and still still say
[29:24] but it might be for others it may not be
[29:26] for me
[29:30] if that's what you want to confess
[29:32] that's the exact level that you'll live
[29:35] and never go above that
[29:38] you'll never go above that level because
[29:40] you always have an uncertainty about my
[29:43] predestination election
[29:45] and you you nev and you think you're
[29:47] being practical and you think you're
[29:49] being honest
[29:54] and you're limiting the expression of
[29:55] christ in your life
[30:00] i want to ask you this
[30:01] what would be wrong at taking god at his
[30:03] word and saying what a prophet said
[30:05] every day of your life to your dying
[30:07] breath and not be bright
[30:11] what would be wrong with that
[30:14] how would you be how would you be judged
[30:16] by taking a prophet exactly what he said
[30:19] believing it for you even if it's not
[30:21] for you claiming that you're the bride
[30:23] living the word everything the prophet
[30:24] said living it doing it surrendering
[30:26] your life to the lord and at the end of
[30:28] the journey find out you really weren't
[30:29] bribed do you think it's still going to
[30:31] go wrong for you at the white throne
[30:33] judgment if that's the attitude you took
[30:37] so why are we so afraid to confess the
[30:40] word
[30:43] what are the consequences
[30:45] well i might be deceived
[30:49] you're deceived in living the word
[30:52] that's a good deception
[30:57] you're surrendering your life to the
[30:58] word living the word accepting the
[31:00] message and well i might be deceit i
[31:02] might just be kidding myself hey keep
[31:04] kidding yourself
[31:09] there's nothing else that brings life
[31:10] there's nothing else that'll bring a
[31:12] manifestation there's nothing else to
[31:14] live for on this planet
[31:16] so just kill reasoning kill the devil
[31:19] amen just cast it down and say i'm not
[31:21] going to think that way anymore i won't
[31:24] accept that line of thinking if that if
[31:27] god sent that prophet to me and he
[31:28] brought me to this message i'll take
[31:30] everything that prophet said everything
[31:32] that's laying in the word about me and
[31:34] i'll just say it i'll just confess it
[31:36] and if something in my heart raises up
[31:38] i'll cast it out in the name of the lord
[31:44] praise be to god
[31:48] the devil's trying to
[31:50] kill us
[31:51] with our own wrong thinking
[31:53] injecting thoughts
[31:55] we can't accept it
[31:57] amen
[31:59] continue on the latest in church age
[32:01] from the church age book brother brad
[32:03] says oh god still has a voice for the
[32:05] people of the world
[32:06] even as he has given a voice to the
[32:08] bride the voice is in the bride
[32:10] as we have said and we will talk more
[32:13] about that later
[32:15] so now we have to know what dispensation
[32:18] we're in
[32:19] and we have to know where we're at
[32:23] because the dispensation
[32:25] of malachi 4 has already came he's
[32:27] already manifested what he's supposed to
[32:28] manifest he can't manifest anything more
[32:33] now i don't say that manifestation
[32:34] doesn't still have an effect because
[32:35] it's that voice that woke up the seed
[32:37] inside of me
[32:39] and it's still that voice is still going
[32:41] on this is still the day of the voice
[32:42] amen that's still essential that is
[32:45] still an essential part amen to calling
[32:48] the bride
[32:49] so it's not going away it's not dead but
[32:52] he can do no more than what he's already
[32:54] done
[32:56] amen now it's time for the bride to
[32:59] manifest
[33:01] brother bennett says in the pergament
[33:03] church age out of the church age book
[33:05] he says have you noticed in revelation
[33:07] 22 17
[33:09] and the spirit and the bright say come
[33:10] and let him that heareth say come see
[33:13] the bride speaks the same word as does
[33:15] the spirit
[33:17] she is a word bride proving she has the
[33:20] spirit
[33:21] oh
[33:22] this is a good quote
[33:24] i like it
[33:26] in every church age we hear these words
[33:28] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[33:30] the spirit saith unto the churches the
[33:32] spirit gives the word if you have the
[33:35] spirit you will hear the word for your
[33:37] age
[33:38] as those true christians took the word
[33:40] for their age
[33:42] what is your age
[33:46] what word do you take for this age
[33:48] not a pentecostal word
[33:51] this is time for bright age
[33:53] so we have to take the word for our age
[33:55] did you get that last thought i repeat
[33:57] every church age ends with the same
[33:59] admonition he that hath an ear let him
[34:02] an individual hear what the spirit saith
[34:05] to the churches the spirit gives the
[34:07] word he has the truth for each age each
[34:10] ace has had its own elect and that elect
[34:13] group always heard the word and received
[34:15] it proving they had the seed in them
[34:21] what did they do to prove they had
[34:23] deceit in them
[34:24] well they had to speak with tongues and
[34:26] they had to work at least one miracle in
[34:27] their life
[34:29] they had to see at least some
[34:31] manifestations and if they saw a few
[34:33] spiritual manifestations they proved
[34:35] they had seed
[34:38] see what the old pentecostal doctrine
[34:41] has done to try to ruin the truth
[34:44] of this day
[34:45] cause us to doubt what god has given us
[34:48] because we don't see certain
[34:50] manifestations we don't see certain
[34:52] demonstrations
[34:56] but this is not what brother branham
[34:58] taught
[35:00] let's read it again just so you can get
[35:03] it honed down tight
[35:05] the spirit gives the word
[35:07] how does he give it through a messenger
[35:09] spirit gives the word he has the truth
[35:11] for each age each age has its own elect
[35:14] and that elect group always heard the
[35:16] word and received it proving they had
[35:19] the seed in them
[35:22] because they heard what the spirit spoke
[35:25] through the messenger of that day amen
[35:27] and they received that word proving they
[35:30] had the spirit and the seed inside of
[35:32] them
[35:34] what seed is that that's the eternal
[35:36] seed gene of god
[35:39] john 8 47 and he that is of god heareth
[35:42] god's words ye therefore hear them not
[35:45] because you are not of god
[35:46] they refused the word jesus and his
[35:49] words for their day
[35:51] but the true seed received the word
[35:53] because they were of god
[35:55] isaiah 54 13 and all thy children shall
[35:58] be taught of god holy spirit
[36:02] jesus said the same thing in john 6 45
[36:05] being one with the word proves whether
[36:07] you are of god and spirit-filled no
[36:10] other criterion
[36:13] do you understand that let's read that
[36:15] no other criterion being one with the
[36:18] word proves whether you are of god and
[36:21] spirit filled
[36:23] spirit-filled
[36:25] sometimes our interpretation of what it
[36:27] means to be spirit-filled is a hangover
[36:29] from the pentecostal age
[36:34] but proving that you're of god and
[36:37] spirit-filled means you become one with
[36:39] the word
[36:40] you hear it you receive it proving the
[36:43] seed is in you
[36:46] i love it when the prophet breaks it
[36:48] down and takes the scarecrow away and
[36:51] takes the worry and the scare away amen
[36:55] praise be to god
[36:56] just keep moving
[36:59] in the message god hiding himself in
[37:01] simplicity then revealing himself in the
[37:02] same it's important to note where
[37:04] brother brandon preaches this message he
[37:06] preaches this message at the beginning
[37:08] of the seal series so he's coming sunday
[37:10] morning to start the seals and he starts
[37:13] with a church dedication and it's not a
[37:14] dedication it's actually a rededication
[37:17] because they just expanded their
[37:18] sanctuary they just got it done in time
[37:20] for the meetings he's rededicating the
[37:22] tabernacle and he's rededicating
[37:24] ourselves
[37:26] and then he preaches god hiding himself
[37:27] in simplicity and revealing himself in
[37:29] the same then that night he preaches the
[37:31] breach and then he goes through the
[37:32] seals
[37:33] so
[37:34] so this is an important message let's
[37:37] just say it that way
[37:39] he placed it here for a reason
[37:41] and brother baby goes on to say the
[37:42] fruit of the spirit is
[37:44] by their fruits not tongues or emotions
[37:47] but by their fruit you shall know them
[37:49] then it's all said oh now you got me
[37:51] because i can't always be nice
[37:56] i can't always go without making a
[37:59] mistake
[38:02] oh now brother chad see see i knew there
[38:04] was a catch i knew i couldn't be it
[38:09] let's just keep reading
[38:11] by their fruits not tongues or emotions
[38:13] but by their fruits you shall know them
[38:14] so that is the fruit of the spirit it's
[38:17] god unfolding himself in humility
[38:19] sweetness and every day the same it's
[38:21] something about a man that stays right
[38:23] with the word
[38:25] every time that he sees the word he
[38:27] punctuates it with an amen no matter
[38:29] what the other people say
[38:33] what was that the fruit of the spirit
[38:37] not a motion not a workup not certain
[38:40] manifestations but the fruit of the
[38:42] spirit is when the man hears the word of
[38:44] god he punctuates it with an amen no
[38:47] matter what anybody else says
[38:50] that's the fruit of the spirit
[38:52] according to the prophet of god
[38:56] i like it
[38:59] 1965 god's chosen place of worship god
[39:02] has a certain place he met he met
[39:05] abraham and there abraham worshiped all
[39:07] down through the testament
[39:08] and his promised word will be
[39:10] interpreted in you by him
[39:13] he didn't say the promise were to be
[39:15] interpreted to you
[39:18] his promise would be interpreted in you
[39:23] this is important because what's the
[39:25] promise for today
[39:27] what's our age it's a bride age that
[39:30] we've been caught up into amen caught
[39:32] out of the church ages called up out of
[39:35] laodicea into the bride age amen so now
[39:38] amen let's read this again he says
[39:44] the word that he promised
[39:47] i'm sorry and he
[39:48] and his promised word will be
[39:50] interpreted
[39:51] in you not to you
[39:54] because this word that he will have a
[39:57] bride that he will be known in the
[39:58] formation of the bride he will be in the
[40:00] bright form amen the bride coming from
[40:02] christ all these terms that we have
[40:04] that's not something to be interpreted
[40:06] to you but that is something to be
[40:08] interpreted in you because if there's
[40:10] going to be a bride coming of christ
[40:12] there has to be a demonstration of
[40:14] christ in a bride form that's why the
[40:17] word cannot be interpreted to you the
[40:19] word must be interpreted in you
[40:23] that makes you living your life for
[40:26] christ you surrendering to the word you
[40:28] going through trials and tribulations
[40:30] but staying true to that word and
[40:32] honoring god and believing him at all
[40:34] costs what is that that becomes the
[40:36] interpretation of the word for this day
[40:39] manifesting right through your life
[40:41] that's why the word will be interpreted
[40:43] in you not to you
[40:48] praise be to god
[40:51] and i'll read that sentence again in his
[40:52] promised word will be interpreted in you
[40:54] by him
[40:55] did you get that
[40:58] the word that he promised to fulfill in
[41:01] the day that you're living in you will
[41:03] be a written epistle of god read of all
[41:05] man
[41:07] did you get it
[41:10] a written epistle read of all men what
[41:11] are they supposed to read they're
[41:13] supposed to read christ in the form of
[41:14] the bride
[41:16] christ in his people christ and his
[41:19] bride the bride manifesting christ which
[41:22] is the word for this day
[41:25] praise be to god
[41:28] you become written you will be a written
[41:30] epistle of god read of all men not what
[41:32] you claim but what god does through you
[41:35] will speak out louder than anything you
[41:37] could claim god said these signs shall
[41:39] follow them that believe that speaks
[41:41] through you
[41:42] he spoke of this age what would we what
[41:45] what would be now the believers of this
[41:48] age has to believe this
[41:51] oh
[41:53] listen
[41:56] he spoke of this age brother burns in
[41:58] 1965 god's chosen place of worship he
[42:02] spoke of this age
[42:04] what would be now
[42:07] the believers of this age has to believe
[42:10] this
[42:11] what he promised today
[42:13] just the same as they had to come into
[42:15] the ark to be saved go out of egypt to
[42:17] be saved they have to come into christ
[42:19] to be saved now into the word message
[42:26] just like going into the ark just like
[42:28] coming out of egypt you have to come
[42:30] into christ the word message to believe
[42:32] the word for this day
[42:36] that's that that he's the same yesterday
[42:39] today and forever
[42:44] in the message things that are to be
[42:47] this is right at the end of his ministry
[42:48] last few weeks of his life on this earth
[42:51] now if we are those attributes of god we
[42:54] cannot live by creeds we cannot live by
[42:57] denominationalism we must live by the
[42:59] word because the bride is part of the
[43:01] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[43:03] husband therefore we must be the word
[43:06] bride and what is the word bride this is
[43:09] the last quote we let read sunday and
[43:11] what is the word bride the manifestation
[43:14] of this hour the bride not a creed or
[43:17] denomination but a living oracle of god
[43:20] a living attribute of god displaying to
[43:22] the world the attributes of god in the
[43:24] formation of the bride that's to be
[43:26] expressed in this hour that we're now
[43:28] living
[43:30] you know what brother branham you know
[43:31] what he excluded from the manifestation
[43:34] of this hour he excluded malachi 4.
[43:41] because the purpose of malachi 4
[43:44] the purpose of the revealing of the son
[43:46] of man
[43:47] was to unite the head to the body
[43:50] so that you could have christ in the
[43:51] formation of the bride
[43:53] that will be
[43:54] the word expressed for this hour this is
[43:58] the message this is what he said i'll
[43:59] read it again and what is the word bride
[44:02] the manifestation of this hour the bride
[44:05] not a creator denomination but a living
[44:07] oracle of god a living attribute of god
[44:10] displaying to the world the attributes
[44:12] of god in the formation of the bride
[44:14] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[44:16] we're now
[44:17] living
[44:19] and that had a forerunner
[44:23] what i just read had a forerunner
[44:26] and what did he forerun he referred the
[44:28] second coming of christ
[44:31] the coming of the son of man in the
[44:32] revealing of the son of man to do what
[44:34] to unite the head and the body to do
[44:36] what to produce the son of man again
[44:40] so that had a forerunner and that
[44:42] forerunner come and did his job as
[44:44] eleazar professor bride for christ
[44:45] united the two the forerunner went off
[44:48] the scene because the manifestation of
[44:50] this hour is not the forerunner the
[44:51] manifestation of this hour is the bride
[44:55] christ in the bride not your flesh not
[44:58] this church not the people sitting here
[45:00] that's not the manifestation the
[45:01] manifestation is jesus christ the word
[45:04] that word alive in you behind the veil
[45:07] of your flesh that's the manifestation
[45:10] in this hour
[45:13] praise be to god
[45:17] hey amen
[45:20] god hiding himself in simplicity
[45:23] then revealing himself to saying
[45:24] remember brother branham is starting
[45:26] with this message when he's going into
[45:28] the seals
[45:30] he says notice elijah's day god chose to
[45:33] hide himself in a simple person
[45:36] and i'm just pulling some excerpts out
[45:38] of this god chose to hide himself in a
[45:40] simple person who was hiding where
[45:43] god was hiding in elijah why do you
[45:46] think brother brennan is preaching this
[45:47] in god in simplicity
[45:51] we're going to put our spiritual jackets
[45:53] on and say i'm tuned in i'm catching
[45:55] what the prophet's saying i understand
[45:58] when he says elijah montana's go up okay
[46:00] and so god elijah was a simple person
[46:02] brother said a man of the woods and uh
[46:05] uneducated who's he talking about
[46:12] elijah's day god chose to hide himself
[46:14] in a simple person
[46:17] guess what we come back to elijah's day
[46:20] and brother was showing that it's god in
[46:22] simplicity
[46:23] he said but a simple man no education
[46:27] might have made it to the seventh grade
[46:28] i don't know
[46:32] we have no place where he ever went to
[46:33] school we have nothing about him just a
[46:35] simple man but god was pleased to hide
[46:37] in that simple person
[46:39] god back there with this simple man
[46:41] hiding in a human being can you grasp it
[46:45] god hiding an illiterate crack to the
[46:47] world
[46:49] who's brother branham really talking
[46:51] about he's not really talking about
[46:54] elijah back there he's really using that
[46:56] to show you his own ministry the elijah
[46:58] ministry in that day an uneducated
[47:01] person a crank to the world amen and
[47:03] where's god hiding he's hiding behind
[47:05] the veil of that man who is he's going
[47:08] to minister amen the elijah ministry
[47:10] through
[47:14] further down he says now and god hid
[47:16] himself in there in such simplicity
[47:21] further down he says now you see
[47:22] while i was in the simple way and
[47:24] everybody everybody against him
[47:26] everybody was at his throat all the
[47:28] ministerial association and everything
[47:29] else was at his throat that's true
[47:32] trying to get rid of him everything else
[47:33] but in that simplicity
[47:36] even though they had no cooperation with
[47:38] his campaigns and what
[47:44] when did elijah have campaigns and
[47:46] cooperation
[47:48] do you understand what he's trying to
[47:50] show us
[47:53] they had no cooperation with his
[47:55] campaigns and whatever more they had
[47:57] everybody thought he was a crank god was
[48:00] hiding himself
[48:04] because brother branham comes and and i
[48:06] said this sunday but i want to reiterate
[48:08] brother branham becomes
[48:11] the mystery of the seventh seal on
[48:13] display
[48:15] when he turns back to the audience what
[48:17] was that that was the seventh seal
[48:20] hiding behind flesh in simplicity
[48:24] that was christ he said you know it's
[48:25] not me it's him i didn't do those things
[48:28] he did those things where is he at he's
[48:30] inside this human vessel displaying the
[48:33] seventh seal and he becomes the mystery
[48:36] of what's written in the white rock that
[48:38] the light has never shown on this and
[48:40] now it's hidden behind his veil and is
[48:42] being demonstrated out so that it can
[48:45] catch individuals out there who can have
[48:47] the their heart veil written opened up
[48:53] now he goes further down in this message
[48:55] god hiding himself in simplicity he says
[48:58] god hides himself in a simple little
[49:00] wash woman or an ordinary man with his
[49:03] dinner under his arm kiss his wife and
[49:05] children goodbye and go out there and
[49:06] maybe hide himself in that man to do
[49:08] something that an archbishop would know
[49:10] nothing about
[49:12] now brother bam took it out of elijah
[49:14] and out of himself and he put it right
[49:16] in you
[49:19] if it could be in a washer woman if it
[49:20] could be in a man with a lunch pail
[49:22] under his arm kiss his wife and his
[49:24] babies and go out there what is it it's
[49:26] god hiding himself in simplicity and
[49:29] revealing himself in the same and then
[49:32] hiding why in the simplicity of a man
[49:34] with a basic education and a common job
[49:38] and a lunch pail under his arm and a
[49:40] wife and kids that he kisses and he
[49:41] loves and he goes to work and he comes
[49:43] home and he takes him to church and he
[49:45] teaches them the bible and he lives an
[49:46] honest clean life what is that god
[49:49] hiding in the simplicity of that vessel
[49:52] and revealing himself in the same
[49:57] he can do something with that man that
[49:58] an archbishop don't know nothing about
[50:00] because an archbishop don't know the
[50:01] word the man with a lunch pail under his
[50:03] arm has more word than the archbishop
[50:05] has
[50:10] see you don't hear him blow no horns and
[50:13] send it out god just gets glory that's
[50:15] all the simple hear it and are glad
[50:20] now that's the beginning of the seal
[50:21] series that's the first of 10 messages
[50:23] he's going to preach and when he comes
[50:25] to the 10th message on the eighth day in
[50:27] the evening he comes to the seventh seal
[50:29] and when he comes to the seventh seal he
[50:31] says he's preaching along and he doesn't
[50:33] really get to the seventh seal yet he's
[50:35] really preaching the gap between the six
[50:37] and seventh seal of the 144 000
[50:40] and the purge church and all of that
[50:41] he's preaching that and now he says now
[50:43] i'd better stop right here
[50:47] he hadn't said anything yet
[50:50] because because the seventh seal
[50:53] doesn't say anything
[50:55] nothing's not said
[51:00] and the seventh seal
[51:02] because it's being demonstrated through
[51:04] the whole week
[51:06] he doesn't have to say anything in the
[51:08] seventh seal
[51:09] because the seventh seal was revealed
[51:12] day by day as the seals were broke and
[51:16] loosed and given out the revelation of
[51:18] the seven thunders revealing what was
[51:21] under the seven seals what was that that
[51:23] was the seventh seal the lamb the lamb
[51:26] has taken the book the lamb has come the
[51:28] mighty angels come down with an open
[51:30] book in his hand the seven thunders are
[51:32] now seven consecutive thunders day after
[51:35] day after day and he says you see the
[51:36] mysterious part of this week it wasn't a
[51:39] man it was them angels
[51:42] well brother branham before he
[51:45] refers to junior jackson's dream he says
[51:47] see he he picked me up he told me to go
[51:50] out west i went out west got caught in
[51:51] the constellations to bring bring me
[51:52] back east the holy spirit interpreting
[51:56] those thunders
[51:57] interpreting the unwritten mystery i
[51:59] think is how he says it
[52:00] so what are those angels the holy spirit
[52:04] the seven spirits of god the portion of
[52:06] the spirit through each of the seven
[52:07] church ages it's all the same thing it's
[52:10] nothing different it's christ coming
[52:12] down to reveal the seals brother said
[52:14] he's the only one that can reveal
[52:17] amen
[52:19] praise be to god
[52:22] so who was revealing the seals christ
[52:26] he said it wasn't a man it was the
[52:27] angels them angels is
[52:30] christ we understand
[52:34] so what's the seventh seal brother
[52:35] branham brother member says have you
[52:37] seen the mysterious part of this week
[52:40] it's been going on all around you
[52:45] i'm sure they were sitting there like
[52:50] what was going on all around
[52:53] first seal
[52:55] second seal
[52:56] third seal
[52:57] fourth seal he come every day he didn't
[53:00] know what they were he knew know nothing
[53:02] more about it than anything and he just
[53:03] sat in that room until he came
[53:06] when he came he gave the revelation the
[53:07] word why because only the lamb can break
[53:09] the seals
[53:11] and he broke the seal and brother
[53:13] branham came out and he preached the
[53:15] seal because in the days of the voice of
[53:16] the seventh angel the mystery of god
[53:18] shall be finished
[53:20] he goes back into the little room
[53:23] which is the third pool
[53:24] the little room brother graham said i've
[53:26] been by myself in a little room
[53:29] for eight days
[53:32] it's eternity
[53:33] he moved behind the veil
[53:36] into the little room
[53:38] i've been in a little room by myself and
[53:40] he would come to me who came amen the
[53:42] holy ghost every day would come amen and
[53:45] give him and give him more revelation of
[53:47] the seals peel back the first seal
[53:49] second seal third seal for seal and he
[53:51] come out and every day and he says the
[53:53] mystery's been going on all around you
[53:55] and you haven't caught it
[54:01] it wasn't the man
[54:02] it was the god hiding behind the man
[54:06] it was the revealing of the seventh seal
[54:08] when he revealed the book of redemption
[54:10] all them six seals just one big book six
[54:12] scrolls rolled together
[54:15] what's the seven
[54:16] the one who can take and peel open the
[54:18] others
[54:21] you see the mystery now
[54:23] and now all of that word and all of that
[54:26] revelation
[54:27] went where when the prophet left
[54:29] where did all that go
[54:31] it went into the bride
[54:33] and now the bride can go first seal
[54:36] second seal third seal now the bride's
[54:40] got the revelation of the seven thunders
[54:42] what does that mean if she can break the
[54:44] seals
[54:46] then who's hiding behind her flesh
[54:52] amen
[54:54] listen what he says in the seventh seal
[54:56] i better stop right there
[54:58] see i just feel checked not to say no
[55:00] more about it
[55:02] i'm laughing because if you know this
[55:04] really well and you've read through it
[55:05] you're reading reading reading he says i
[55:06] stop i feel like i'll say no more about
[55:07] it you're like you haven't said nothing
[55:08] about it at all
[55:12] so just remember the seventh seal the
[55:14] reason it was not open the reason it did
[55:16] not reveal it no one should know about
[55:18] it and i want you to know before i ever
[55:21] knowed one word about that the vision
[55:23] came years ago you remember that and
[55:25] here it is just as this other slides
[55:27] right straight into the word exactly
[55:29] where it was and god knows my heart i
[55:30] never one time thought of such a thing
[55:32] as that and here it was it's later than
[55:34] we think
[55:37] oh my just shows us from god it fits
[55:40] exactly in the promises of god from the
[55:42] end of the the message you notice
[55:45] notice now for the end of time message
[55:47] this seal so the seventh seal is the end
[55:49] of time message and at the end of time
[55:52] what was sealed will be revealed so when
[55:54] when he told daniel seal it up until the
[55:56] time of the end he told john write not
[55:58] those things but seal them up now when
[56:00] it's time to unseal them it shows we're
[56:02] at the end time so the end time seal is
[56:05] the seventh seal when he unveils what's
[56:07] been sealed
[56:10] praise god
[56:11] and notice for the end of time message
[56:13] this seal
[56:14] after all he's revealed all the six
[56:17] seals but it don't say nothing about the
[56:19] seventh and the end time seal when it
[56:21] starts will be absolutely a total secret
[56:24] according to the bible before knowing
[56:26] that remember revelations 10 1 7 1-7
[56:29] chapter 10 1-7 at the end of the seventh
[56:32] angel's message all the mysteries of god
[56:34] will be known were at the end time the
[56:36] opening of the seventh seal
[56:40] he told you
[56:41] what did he tell me
[56:44] nothing
[56:46] because it was the whole week
[56:48] it was going on all around you the lamb
[56:51] was opening the seals
[56:53] he was here
[56:54] where was he hiding behind that flesh
[57:01] now listen what he says after he says
[57:02] all that we're at the end time the
[57:04] opening of the seventh seal can you
[57:06] imagine sitting there that day
[57:09] without 50 some years to study over this
[57:11] and read it and pour over however many
[57:13] years you've poured over it how many
[57:14] times you've heard it preached but for
[57:16] the first time he said there it is he
[57:18] said this is the end time the opening of
[57:19] the seventh seal and you say you just
[57:21] said do i say no more about it you just
[57:22] told me i should have caught it
[57:25] if you're spiritual you'll catch it i
[57:26] have no idea what you're talking about
[57:29] there it is the opening of the seventh
[57:30] seal and then he comes right next
[57:32] statement
[57:33] now how did i know the other day
[57:36] last sunday a week ago today when i was
[57:38] preaching on be humble be humble
[57:40] remember god deals in little things
[57:44] i didn't realize what it really was
[57:45] talking about and now i see it it is in
[57:48] such a humble way you think that
[57:50] something like that would be revealed to
[57:52] the vatican but it comes just like john
[57:54] the baptist it comes like the birth of
[57:56] our lord and the stable glory to god so
[57:58] help me the hour is at hand we're here
[58:01] oh my
[58:03] now do you see it
[58:07] i love this french now do you see do you
[58:10] see it humble humble where was he in
[58:12] elijah's day behind the veil of elijah
[58:15] where was he he was hiding behind the
[58:16] skins god hiding himself in simplicity
[58:19] and revealing himself in the same hiding
[58:21] in elijah ministry between an uneducated
[58:24] man kicked out by the world amen the
[58:26] whole ministerial association against
[58:28] him but behind the simplicity of that
[58:30] veil is god almighty with the full
[58:33] revelation of the mystery of god and
[58:35] he's giving it out day by day proving
[58:37] that it is the lamb not the man but it
[58:41] is the lamb working through that vessel
[58:43] amen to what to unite the head and the
[58:46] body to what to manifest the son of man
[58:49] again when the word now moves not just
[58:52] in the prophet but the word moves into
[58:54] you
[58:56] and you become the revelation of the
[58:58] seventh seal
[58:59] how did i know brother babies he's
[59:01] preaching to seven saying i feel checked
[59:02] i stop i'm not going to say anymore
[59:06] he says do you remember sabino canyon
[59:09] do you remember the sword in my hand
[59:12] the search the sword of the king the
[59:14] word of the lord amen and it fit my hand
[59:18] just
[59:18] perfect
[59:21] what was it it was the sword it was the
[59:24] word it was the word of god and it fit
[59:27] his hand perfect
[59:32] what's he doing hiding in simplicity
[59:34] revealing in the same
[59:37] it's so simple it's jesus christ in the
[59:40] form of that man
[59:42] breaking the seals
[59:44] you say it was jesus christ you know
[59:46] they started worshiping brother branham
[59:48] started baptizing in his name
[59:50] do you remember dawson roddy's testimony
[59:53] this isn't a tape it's not what brother
[59:54] branham said on tape so do you take it
[59:56] for what it's worth but in dawson
[59:57] riley's testimony dawson ryan brother
[59:59] man was telling dawson riley
[1:00:01] about the people that are baptizing his
[1:00:03] name and and and dawson was listening he
[1:00:07] said i was surprised he said you know
[1:00:09] they're baptizing my name they're
[1:00:10] teaching that i'm jesus christ and all
[1:00:12] this and dawson was just listening and
[1:00:15] brother made the statement he says
[1:00:16] they're not as far off as you think
[1:00:21] they're not as far off as you think and
[1:00:22] dawson made the statement he says well i
[1:00:24] was thinking they was pretty far off
[1:00:30] because brother branham that flesh man
[1:00:32] was not jesus christ but it was jesus
[1:00:34] christ in that flesh man
[1:00:38] and he was the mystery of the seventh
[1:00:40] seal
[1:00:41] breaking the seals
[1:00:43] and now the mystery of that seventh seal
[1:00:45] the endtime seal is in bride form
[1:00:49] and that's why he started with god
[1:00:51] hiding himself in simplicity it's so
[1:00:54] simple we have problems believing it
[1:00:56] ourselves
[1:00:59] it's so simple it's so humble amen that
[1:01:02] you can't look at the stable you've got
[1:01:04] to look at the life in the manger

[1:01:14] humble remember god deals in little
[1:01:15] things
[1:01:16] i didn't realize what i was really
[1:01:18] talking about and now i see it it's in
[1:01:20] such a humble way
[1:01:22] glory to god so help me the hour is at
[1:01:26] hand
[1:01:27] we're here

[1:02:09] i say praise god
[1:02:11] help me not to miss it lord
[1:02:13] it's so simple it's so humble
[1:02:16] it's so simple it's so humble
[1:02:19] that god who's so great can come down in
[1:02:21] such simplicity to hide himself from the
[1:02:23] world that he can be born in a stable
[1:02:26] and a man and be laid in a manger
[1:02:29] and what was it it was jehovah in the
[1:02:31] form of a baby
[1:02:33] and it's so simple and it's so humble
[1:02:35] that it can be god amen poured down
[1:02:38] inside behind your flesh and it can be a
[1:02:40] man with a lunch bucket over her hand
[1:02:42] kissing his wife and his kids goodbye
[1:02:44] going to work and what is it it's the
[1:02:45] mystery of the seventh seal it's the
[1:02:48] unwritten portion of the word it's the
[1:02:50] it's the part of the word that's been
[1:02:51] hiding all through the bible that christ
[1:02:53] would have a bride and she's part of him
[1:02:55] just like eve came out of adam christ
[1:02:58] the bride came out of christ and she's
[1:03:00] she's word as he is word
[1:03:03] and in this last day it's the
[1:03:05] manifestation of jesus christ in her
[1:03:08] with a lunch bucket under his arm
[1:03:09] kissing his wife goodbye and going to
[1:03:11] work
[1:03:13] god hiding himself in simplicity and
[1:03:15] revealing himself in the same and now
[1:03:17] when somebody looks at you and says is
[1:03:19] the seventh seal open he said you just
[1:03:21] say it depends on who you think i am
[1:03:28] that's the truth it depends on who you
[1:03:30] think we are it depends on who you think
[1:03:32] this bride is if the seven steel's still
[1:03:35] closed if you can't see him and her the
[1:03:37] seventh seal is not open to you but if
[1:03:39] you recognize where he's at now and you
[1:03:42] see him in a mini-membered body you see
[1:03:45] that he's been poured out into his bride
[1:03:47] amen the holy ghost that was bound
[1:03:49] through the church ages now has been
[1:03:51] loosed by the opening of the seals when
[1:03:53] the word came back the full life of
[1:03:55] jesus christ came back and now is
[1:03:57] dwelling in his people on this earth
[1:04:00] right now
[1:04:02] and what is that that's the mystery of
[1:04:05] the seven seal hiding in simplicity and
[1:04:07] revealing in the same
[1:04:12] amen
[1:04:15] praise god
[1:04:18] i'm all messed up
[1:04:20] praise be to god
[1:04:24] amen
[1:04:28] i don't know where i want to go i want
[1:04:29] to wrap up here
[1:04:33] let's go to luke chapter 2.
[1:04:37] i'll leave you with one thought
[1:04:39] and we are
[1:04:42] we me
[1:04:43] and nowhere near where i thought i was
[1:04:45] going to be but praise be to god
[1:04:47] just keep pulling don't shut your puller
[1:04:49] off yet
[1:04:51] a couple more minutes
[1:04:54] luke chapter 1
[1:04:56] the new testament is interesting and you
[1:04:59] catch the order and the way things
[1:05:01] happen god is revealing himself in the
[1:05:03] structure of his word
[1:05:04] and and we have a visitation of gabriel
[1:05:08] to zacharias to tell zacharias he and
[1:05:10] his wife who is elizabeth who's barren
[1:05:12] is going to have
[1:05:14] a a word baby
[1:05:17] they're going to have a word baby
[1:05:19] because it's a prophecy going to come
[1:05:20] forth through them
[1:05:22] and then gabriel jumps over and talks to
[1:05:24] mary and tells mary she's going to have
[1:05:25] a word baby
[1:05:27] she's going to have the word baby
[1:05:29] the prophecy
[1:05:31] and so now
[1:05:32] you come to verse 38 chapter 1 verse 38
[1:05:37] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[1:05:39] lord
[1:05:40] be it unto me according to thy word and
[1:05:42] the angel departed from her
[1:05:44] and mary arose in those days and went
[1:05:46] into the hill country with haste into
[1:05:48] the city of judea judah and entered into
[1:05:50] the house of zacharias and saluted
[1:05:52] elizabeth
[1:05:53] and it came to pass that when elizabeth
[1:05:55] heard the salutation of mary the babe
[1:05:57] leaped in her womb and elizabeth was
[1:06:00] filled with the holy ghost and she spake
[1:06:02] out with a loud voice and said blessed
[1:06:05] art thou among women and blessed is the
[1:06:07] fruit of thy womb and when says this to
[1:06:09] me that the mother of my lord should
[1:06:11] come to me for lo as soon as the voice
[1:06:13] of thy salutation sounded in my ears the
[1:06:16] babe leapt in my womb for joy and
[1:06:18] blessed is she that believeth for there
[1:06:21] shall be performance of those things
[1:06:23] which were told her from the lord
[1:06:27] this is interesting
[1:06:29] let's go to verse 46 and then we'll talk
[1:06:30] about this and mary said my soul doth
[1:06:33] magnify the lord and my spirit hath
[1:06:36] rejoiced in god my savior for he hath
[1:06:38] regarded the lowest state of his
[1:06:39] handmaid for behold from henceforth all
[1:06:43] generations shall call me blessed for he
[1:06:45] that is
[1:06:46] mighty hath done to me great things and
[1:06:48] holy is his name and his mercy is on
[1:06:51] them that fear him from generation to
[1:06:53] generation he hath showed strength with
[1:06:55] his arm he has scattered the proud and
[1:06:57] the imagination of their hearts he hath
[1:06:59] put down the mighty from their seat and
[1:07:01] exalted them of low degree he hath
[1:07:03] filled the hungry with good things in
[1:07:05] the rich he hath sent empty away he hath
[1:07:08] opened his servants israel in
[1:07:10] remembrance of his mercy
[1:07:12] as he spoke spake to our fathers to
[1:07:14] abraham and to his seed forever and mary
[1:07:17] abode with her about three months and
[1:07:18] returned to her own house
[1:07:20] so here
[1:07:22] there's an angel that visits
[1:07:24] elizabeth or zacharias and talks about
[1:07:26] this conception elizabeth's going to
[1:07:27] have elizabeth conceives she conceives
[1:07:30] on the promised word a word baby
[1:07:33] and now mary conceives the word baby on
[1:07:36] the promised word that come through an
[1:07:38] angel amen was confirmed through an
[1:07:39] angel and she conceives and now
[1:07:41] elizabeth mary comes to elizabeth and
[1:07:43] all of a sudden when mary brings a
[1:07:45] salutation and brother branham said the
[1:07:47] first time that the name jesus was
[1:07:49] spoken
[1:07:51] the babe left within her and elizabeth
[1:07:53] was filled with the holy ghost and she
[1:07:55] begins to prophesy
[1:07:57] she begins to identify amen before amen
[1:08:01] she's told amen anything about what's
[1:08:04] going on amen before she's told amen she
[1:08:07] has within her within her
[1:08:11] she has the life of the forerunner
[1:08:14] elizabeth represents the old church amen
[1:08:16] she's got the life of the forerunner
[1:08:18] inside of her and when she when she
[1:08:20] comes in contact with mary and mary
[1:08:23] gives a salutation that life inside of
[1:08:25] her jumps she's filled with the holy
[1:08:27] ghost amen you know i mean we can see
[1:08:29] our whole story right here
[1:08:32] the the baby leaves and she begins to
[1:08:34] prophesy and now it's not an angel from
[1:08:37] heaven it's not the priest in the temple
[1:08:39] but it's a woman now giving a prophecy
[1:08:42] and it's a woman with a word baby living
[1:08:44] inside of her
[1:08:47] because this is the new testament now
[1:08:49] now we're coming to a new dispensation
[1:08:51] amen the mail was the old testament
[1:08:53] that's been capped off by jesus christ
[1:08:56] but now we're moving into the feminine
[1:08:58] dispensation that's why the book of
[1:08:59] matthew opens amen it's got five women
[1:09:02] in the first chapter why because we're
[1:09:04] moving into feminine dispensation and
[1:09:06] now when the angel comes amen and the
[1:09:08] angel confirms the word and the word is
[1:09:11] conceived in the womb now amen when she
[1:09:14] meets mary all of a sudden she springs
[1:09:16] to life and says you're the virgin amen
[1:09:19] you are the mother of my lord amen
[1:09:21] inside of you is the word baby
[1:09:25] praise god
[1:09:26] why because of what was inside of her
[1:09:30] she could identify and then mary with
[1:09:32] the word in her amen as soon as as
[1:09:35] elizabeth speaks and identifies her
[1:09:38] now mary begins to speak and when mary
[1:09:40] begins to speak she's not wishy-washy
[1:09:43] she's not hopeful she's not hoping that
[1:09:45] she's the virgin
[1:09:46] she's not hoping she's conceived on the
[1:09:48] word she's not begging she's not
[1:09:50] pleading amen she's not bragging but
[1:09:53] what she says she speaks by the
[1:09:55] authority of the word amen and she says
[1:09:58] she says mary said my soul doth magnify
[1:10:01] the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in
[1:10:03] god my savior for he has regarded the
[1:10:06] lowest state of his handmaiden for
[1:10:07] behold from henceforth all generations
[1:10:10] shall call me blessed
[1:10:15] she's not bragging
[1:10:18] she is under an anointing of the holy
[1:10:20] ghost and she is claiming her portion of
[1:10:23] the word her manifestation what the
[1:10:25] angel told her because this is what the
[1:10:27] angel told her
[1:10:31] and the angel has come to us and told us
[1:10:34] our position in the word that you are
[1:10:36] virgin
[1:10:37] virgin bride of jesus christ amen you
[1:10:40] are the spotless sinless virtuous virgin
[1:10:43] bride of jesus christ and he told us
[1:10:45] that we were going to conceive on the
[1:10:47] word amen and the word was going to be
[1:10:49] inside of us and we were going to bring
[1:10:51] forth to reproduce the son of man again
[1:10:54] amen if we can if we can catch the
[1:10:56] positive identification then we can
[1:10:58] speak with the authority of the word
[1:11:01] about our position and it's not bragging
[1:11:03] it's not boasting it's not putting
[1:11:05] somebody down to put somebody else up
[1:11:07] it's just stating the revelation that's
[1:11:09] in our heart under the anointing of the
[1:11:11] holy ghost that god has blessed me amen
[1:11:14] above all women god has blessed me god
[1:11:16] has called me god has put his word
[1:11:18] inside of me amen everybody all
[1:11:21] generations and all church ages will
[1:11:23] call me blessed
[1:11:26] why because the angel told me and i
[1:11:29] believed what he said and i received the
[1:11:31] word of the angel and said be it unto me
[1:11:33] according to thy word
[1:11:36] and when she said be unto me according
[1:11:37] to thy word she goes out to confess what
[1:11:40] the angel told her what she received
[1:11:42] from the angel
[1:11:45] where are we going to get it god sent an
[1:11:47] angel in this day to bring the message
[1:11:49] from heaven that it's now time for
[1:11:51] another virgin to conceive by a spoken
[1:11:54] word virgin conception to bring forth a
[1:11:57] spoken word baby
[1:12:00] just as what was prophesied for the
[1:12:02] virgin brother branham said amen all
[1:12:04] that was prophesied the bride now will
[1:12:06] fulfill all that was prophesied to be
[1:12:08] done in the virgin
[1:12:10] so we come right back to the same place
[1:12:12] and we start in the new testament with
[1:12:14] now these women are anointed by the
[1:12:17] spirit and speaking the word
[1:12:20] why because the new testament is going
[1:12:22] to be capped off with a woman anointed
[1:12:24] by the word amen by the holy ghost
[1:12:27] speaking the word for in revelation 22
[1:12:29] 17 the spirit and the bride say come
[1:12:34] why because they i have the authority of
[1:12:37] the word to bid the word to come
[1:12:41] to come where
[1:12:42] come to the place i am because the place
[1:12:45] where i am is where the fountain of
[1:12:47] living water
[1:12:48] is the bride did not come in revelations
[1:12:52] 22 17 after the revelation amen of the
[1:12:55] book of revelations after the capstone's
[1:12:57] been revealed she didn't come and say go
[1:12:59] go to the altar go to this church go to
[1:13:02] that minister go to that but she comes
[1:13:04] at the end of the book at the end of the
[1:13:06] capstone and the spirit and the bride
[1:13:08] say come amen come come come why because
[1:13:12] out of your belly shall flow rivers of
[1:13:14] living water the word is in you amen and
[1:13:17] the word can come out of you
[1:13:21] it's not go
[1:13:22] go go
[1:13:24] let's come
[1:13:26] come and drink
[1:13:28] come and drink
[1:13:31] jesus told the woman of the well if you
[1:13:32] drink of this water jesus was the well
[1:13:35] if you drink of this water you become
[1:13:39] a well of living water springing up into
[1:13:41] eternal life
[1:13:43] you drink of the will and become the
[1:13:44] well and now the new testament starts
[1:13:48] with these women who received an angelic
[1:13:50] visitation
[1:13:51] zechariah did elizabeth was part of
[1:13:53] zachariah
[1:13:56] she had the word in her
[1:13:58] mary had the word in her
[1:14:01] and they could speak out boldly
[1:14:03] the word of god
[1:14:06] i tell you
[1:14:09] have we conceived on the word
[1:14:12] has an angel come in our day
[1:14:15] has the angel given us our portion of
[1:14:17] the scripture
[1:14:20] have we the ability by faith to say be
[1:14:23] it unto me according to your word
[1:14:25] he comes in the first seal i said i no
[1:14:27] longer call you church i call you bri
[1:14:29] can you say be it unto me according to
[1:14:31] your word
[1:14:33] can we say i surrender
[1:14:36] all
[1:14:38] come
[1:14:39] if you if you want to use this body to
[1:14:41] bring forth your life use this body to
[1:14:43] bring forth your life
[1:14:46] mary got a bad reputation
[1:14:48] she got scorned and mocked and ridiculed
[1:14:52] but she knew she was blessed above all
[1:14:54] women
[1:14:58] can we speak
[1:15:00] with more authority
[1:15:03] by the holy ghost
[1:15:05] can you say god
[1:15:07] has looked on my lowly estate
[1:15:10] god has looked on the lowliest state of
[1:15:12] his handmaid and he now i i who was low
[1:15:15] have been lifted up
[1:15:18] he has exalted me
[1:15:21] he has given mercy he has exalted and
[1:15:25] now
[1:15:26] all all call me blessed
[1:15:29] not because i called myself that
[1:15:32] but because i received the word for this
[1:15:34] day
[1:15:35] and i received it
[1:15:37] for me i didn't receive it for my
[1:15:38] neighbor i didn't receive it from my
[1:15:40] church i didn't receive it for i
[1:15:42] received it from me
[1:15:44] and if you received it for you
[1:15:47] then you can speak your revelation
[1:15:50] it's not bragging it's not boasting
[1:15:53] it's the understanding of what the word
[1:15:56] is for this day
[1:15:58] can you say
[1:16:00] come
[1:16:02] can you say come
[1:16:04] have you arrived to a place
[1:16:08] where you found the fountain of living
[1:16:09] water
[1:16:11] and you've drunk from the fountain of
[1:16:12] living water and become the well of
[1:16:14] living water now coming out of you is
[1:16:17] coming the life of christ have you come
[1:16:19] to a place
[1:16:20] at the top of this mountain where you
[1:16:22] can honestly say come
[1:16:26] or are we still uncertain somewhere down
[1:16:28] the mountain trying to encourage people
[1:16:30] to go
[1:16:31] go
[1:16:32] if you go up there
[1:16:34] if you go here if you go there if you go
[1:16:36] talk to this person if you go talk to if
[1:16:38] you go up there you can have living
[1:16:40] water
[1:16:42] or can we by revelation say
[1:16:45] i'm not worthy
[1:16:47] ah he's looked on my low estate
[1:16:50] mary wasn't saying she was a great
[1:16:51] person mary wasn't thinking she was
[1:16:53] special she was significant she didn't
[1:16:56] no she says he looked upon my lowly
[1:16:58] state
[1:17:00] and he plucked me out of the murray clay
[1:17:02] and he lifted me up and he put his life
[1:17:05] inside of me and now it's him and me
[1:17:07] it's not me it's him and me but i know
[1:17:09] who's in me and it's him in me
[1:17:12] i know what i've drunk from and i know
[1:17:14] what well of water is in my soul and i
[1:17:17] know the fountain of living water and i
[1:17:19] want to say come not to this flesh not
[1:17:22] to me as a person but come amen and
[1:17:25] receive the word come and ask me a
[1:17:27] question come and listen to me for a
[1:17:29] minute come and ask me what happened in
[1:17:31] the garden
[1:17:34] come and ask me what day and age come
[1:17:36] and ask me why there's so many
[1:17:37] denominations
[1:17:40] come
[1:17:41] come
[1:17:42] come
[1:17:44] the new testament starts off
[1:17:47] with women
[1:17:49] impregnated by the word
[1:17:52] with the word inside
[1:17:54] prophesying speaking forth the word
[1:17:58] if you look chronologically
[1:18:01] not in the order of the bible's written
[1:18:02] but chronologically
[1:18:05] when elizabeth speaks
[1:18:08] it's the first
[1:18:09] human in the new testament to prophesy
[1:18:14] and it's a woman
[1:18:18] and the new testament ends
[1:18:20] with the spirit and the bride saying
[1:18:22] come
[1:18:23] in revelations 10 1-7 brings us to the
[1:18:26] mysteries of god revealed in the voice
[1:18:28] of the seventh angel but revelations 8
[1:18:30] moves to the bride taking the book and
[1:18:32] rev revelations 10 8 and revelations 10
[1:18:34] 11 moves to the bride prophesying
[1:18:38] again what is the new testament it's the
[1:18:41] dispensation of the woman
[1:18:43] we've come to the end of the new
[1:18:45] testament the capstone comes down christ
[1:18:47] now comes in the formation of his bride
[1:18:50] to do what to give forth the water of
[1:18:52] life freely
[1:18:55] we have to know who we are
[1:18:57] and god bless you let's stand i don't
[1:18:59] want to go any further
[1:19:01] if i go one minute further we'll go one
[1:19:04] hour longer
[1:19:08] but praise god friends there's a lot
[1:19:10] more that i wish to get to and we'll
[1:19:12] pray sunday we'll see what direction the
[1:19:14] lord wants to go in but there's so much
[1:19:16] more on my heart that i'd like to share
[1:19:20] but
[1:19:21] don't miss
[1:19:22] god in simplicity
[1:19:24] and don't miss god in your simplicity
[1:19:28] well i know it's god and i know no
[1:19:30] listen it's more than that
[1:19:32] it's more than what was in the church
[1:19:34] ages
[1:19:35] it's more than what we've
[1:19:37] we've ever thought or known or seen
[1:19:39] before we've come down to the the
[1:19:42] revelation of the seventh seal and the
[1:19:44] revelation of the seventh seal such a
[1:19:47] mystery
[1:19:48] because it comes in three parts
[1:19:50] threefolds the first one
[1:19:53] god getting preeminence in a man
[1:19:55] the second one god i'm getting
[1:19:56] preeminence in a people
[1:19:58] and he's doing that now
[1:20:00] why preeminence so he can show his life
[1:20:03] when he got pregnant unto man it became
[1:20:05] the display of god and flesh
[1:20:08] when he gets preeminence in the people
[1:20:11] what will it be
[1:20:13] the mystery of the seventh seal
[1:20:16] in her
[1:20:18] and she
[1:20:21] the question is
[1:20:23] who are you
[1:20:26] that's the question
[1:20:27] who are you
[1:20:29] are you who the world says you are
[1:20:32] are you who your upbringing says you
[1:20:34] were or your family tree and records is
[1:20:36] that who you are
[1:20:38] or by revelation can you get an
[1:20:40] identification from a prophet messenger
[1:20:44] who will identify in this age
[1:20:47] where the dwelling place of christ is
[1:20:49] going to be
[1:20:51] can you hear the angel speak to you
[1:20:54] and says
[1:20:55] you're highly favored
[1:21:01] she didn't think she was highly favored
[1:21:04] but she said he said she was highly
[1:21:07] favored
[1:21:08] so she had to believe she was highly
[1:21:10] favored because he said she was highly
[1:21:12] favored
[1:21:13] not because she thought she was highly
[1:21:15] favored but because he said it
[1:21:18] do you understand
[1:21:19] god sent an angel in this day to tell
[1:21:21] you you're highly favored above all
[1:21:23] women
[1:21:25] that there's a time for a promise to be
[1:21:27] fulfilled and that promise is going to
[1:21:28] be fulfilled in you when you conceive by
[1:21:31] spoken word amen
[1:21:35] can you believe what mary believed
[1:21:38] can you speak like mary spoke
[1:21:41] god
[1:21:42] has lifted me up
[1:21:45] god
[1:21:46] has lifted me out of the mighty god has
[1:21:49] called me god has looked on my lowest
[1:21:51] state god has lifted me up and now all
[1:21:53] will call me blessed because i'm the
[1:21:55] most blessed of the most blessed of the
[1:21:56] most blessed because he has chosen me to
[1:21:59] put his word in to bring forth the son
[1:22:01] of man again
[1:22:03] and it's where is it it's in me mary
[1:22:05] didn't make no bones about it she knew
[1:22:07] where it was
[1:22:10] don't play around
[1:22:12] if god's revealed it to you confess
[1:22:14] where it's at
[1:22:16] amen watch your faith take off when you
[1:22:18] say what the word says
[1:22:21] i do say what the word says about you
[1:22:25] god
[1:22:27] is bringing us a greater reality
[1:22:29] of all of these things so we can act
[1:22:31] with a greater confidence and a greater
[1:22:33] boldness and quit halting around and
[1:22:36] start stepping into that image he had of
[1:22:38] us before the foundation of the world
[1:22:39] and be what he's called us to be not
[1:22:42] with halting steps and not not bashfully
[1:22:45] but just when mary got under the spirit
[1:22:46] she says it's right here
[1:22:49] i'm blessed
[1:22:51] can you say i'm blessed
[1:22:53] i am blessed
[1:22:55] i've been exalted
[1:22:57] he's lifted me up he's exalted me above
[1:22:59] all women why because i'm blessed
[1:23:02] because he chose me and i'm his handmaid
[1:23:04] and he told me it was me and i believe
[1:23:06] it's me and it's inside of me
[1:23:10] don't be ashamed of it friends
[1:23:12] and let's sing brother ben

[1:24:28] [Music]
[1:24:31] me
[1:24:39] [Music]
[1:24:47] elizabeth spoke by inspiration
[1:24:51] she spoke by inspiration
[1:24:53] by revelation
[1:24:56] and what elizabeth said
[1:24:58] was the same thing the angel said
[1:25:02] but could we accept it coming from
[1:25:04] elizabeth
[1:25:05] [Music]
[1:25:08] can we accept it coming by elizabeth
[1:25:10] [Music]
[1:25:12] spoke it and it becomes scripture and
[1:25:15] we'll repeat it
[1:25:17] because we see it in print
[1:25:19] but don't forget it came through a woman
[1:25:21] [Music]
[1:25:24] who caught the revelation by inspiration
[1:25:27] and spoke the same thing the angel said
[1:25:30] but she didn't say as gabriel said i now
[1:25:32] said no she caught the revelation by
[1:25:34] inspiration of the holy ghost and she
[1:25:36] spoke and what she spoke was the same
[1:25:38] thing he spoke because the prophet and
[1:25:40] the spirit and the bride will all be
[1:25:42] saying the same thing
[1:25:45] how how will we ensure that they all say
[1:25:47] the same thing by only reading quotes
[1:25:50] and only reading the bible and never
[1:25:52] saying anything no by catching the same
[1:25:55] holy ghost that elizabeth caught under
[1:25:57] the same revelation by the same
[1:25:59] inspiration when you speak speak the
[1:26:01] same thing
[1:26:03] the angel said
[1:26:05] only now it's coming through a woman
[1:26:06] with the word on the inside
[1:26:09] when mary spoke when mary spoke you can
[1:26:11] find what mary said in the scriptures in
[1:26:13] the old testament
[1:26:15] mary spoke by inspiration she didn't
[1:26:18] recite the placing of the scripture
[1:26:20] under inspiration in the holy ghost she
[1:26:23] took her position and she just spoke the
[1:26:25] word
[1:26:26] can you receive it
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:29] we do receive it it's in the bible
[1:26:32] i say the same thing's happening today
[1:26:35] god is speaking through his bride
[1:26:38] amen not
[1:26:39] new words
[1:26:40] what she'll be saying will have already
[1:26:42] been said in the word
[1:26:45] what you say or the prophet already said
[1:26:47] the angels already said it the spirit
[1:26:49] and the prophet and the bride will be
[1:26:50] saying the whole same thing but she must
[1:26:53] be speaking by inspiration and
[1:26:55] revelation
[1:26:57] god bless you friends don't be afraid to
[1:27:00] speak your revelation
[1:27:01] don't be afraid to share what's in your
[1:27:03] heart don't be afraid to claim boldly
