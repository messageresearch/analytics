[0:00] The way we view the commandments of God,
[0:03] the way we view the message, the way we
[0:05] view the word is actually the benefit we
[0:08] get out of it. Because I've seen
[0:11] individuals who without question just
[0:14] believe that God sent us a prophet and
[0:16] that God taught us what he wants us to
[0:18] know. And they just in a simple way just
[0:21] believe it. And you see them prosper and
[0:24] you see their families prosper and you
[0:25] see the protection that the word's
[0:26] promised.
[0:28] You see individuals who are always
[0:30] questioning everything. Did he really
[0:32] mean this? And why did he say this? And
[0:34] why did he teach that?
[0:35] And that's no way to live.
[0:38] It's no way to live. I say, let's go
[0:42] back to see what God has given us as a
[0:44] provision from God.
[0:46] Not the workings of man, the provision
[0:48] of God. It's the restoration of the
[0:50] word. Amen. It's the Bible brought back
[0:54] into our view with the scales taken off
[0:56] and all man's teaching stripped away so
[0:59] that we can come back and know what God
[1:00] wants.
[1:02] And we know where the wall is and we
[1:04] know where to stand.
[1:08] Amen. I think that's God has been so
[1:11] good to us to give us a wall.
[1:16] He's been so loving to us to restore the
[1:19] word. The greatest thing that has ever
[1:22] happened to me outside of being born
[1:25] again
[1:27] is hearing the voice of a prophet of
[1:29] God.
[1:31] That'll bring the truth of God's word
[1:33] back front and center.
[1:36] Where would we be without a prophet?
[1:39] Where would you be if there was an
[1:40] authority on the earth that could say
[1:42] God meant this when he said that he
[1:43] meant this and this is what God wants?
[1:45] If we didn't have an authority of a
[1:47] prophet, where would we be? Amen.
[1:50] We would be we would be tangled up in
[1:52] all kinds of stuff. But listen friends,
[1:54] listen. This world is in a disaster.
[1:58] This world is burning down. Amen.
[2:00] Brother Van Priest, this world is
[2:01] falling apart again.
[2:03] And I say and again. Amen. And again,
[2:05] this world is falling apart. But look at
[2:08] your lives. Amen. God has given you
[2:10] families and homes and peace in your
[2:12] heart. And God, yeah, we have trials
[2:13] like everybody else, but we don't have
[2:15] them like everybody else. Amen. We have
[2:17] sicknesses come. We have troubles that
[2:18] strike. We have difficulties that come.
[2:20] But there's something inside of us.
[2:22] Amen. There's some peace inside of us,
[2:24] some connection with God because he's
[2:26] brought us back behind this word. And
[2:28] the devil can't get in and torment our
[2:30] mind and corrupt our soul and twist us
[2:32] up in knots and have us all tied up in
[2:34] bondage. We got to the place where we
[2:36] can be in the midst of a difficult
[2:38] circumstance and sing and dance because
[2:40] God is going to get me out of this
[2:41] because God has told me who I am and
[2:44] what he wants and I've stayed behind his
[2:47] wall.
[2:52] I would rather be free in my
[2:57] heart than in my body. Amen.
[3:03] Paul and Silas were not free when they
[3:06] were beaten when they went on trial and
[3:09] they laid upon them many stripes and
[3:11] they put them into the inner jail cell
[3:13] and they fastened them in stalks.
[3:17] They were not free, but they were free.
[3:22] But you have people that you work with
[3:23] and people you walk past and people you
[3:25] associate with. They're as free as free
[3:27] can be. They can get in their car and
[3:29] drive anywhere they want to drive. They
[3:30] got enough extra money to buy some more
[3:32] gas and go to another state. They can
[3:34] buy what they want in Walmart. They can
[3:36] do whatever they want. And they are
[3:38] absolutely in bondage and in misery.
[3:43] I want to be free like Paul and Silas
[3:45] was free.
[3:46] I want to free because the freedom that
[3:49] Christ gives the liberty that Jesus
[3:51] Christ has given us and restoring the
