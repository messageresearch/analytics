[4:20] no support no direction and no guidance

[17:16] God pray
[17:21] together precious Lord Jesus we
[17:24] certainly do love you this morning
[17:27] Father
[17:31] and once again
[17:33] we're grateful
[17:36] that we can make that
[17:39] Proclamation with a proper understanding
[17:42] and not just some figment of our
[17:45] imagination of what God would be that we
[17:47] would love
[17:49] but that we know that you are the
[17:51] revealed
[17:53] word father and
[17:55] it's the revealed word that we love
[18:00] so therefore
[18:03] we love the one and only true
[18:07] God lord we're so grateful that we can
[18:10] come this morning that we can worship
[18:12] you in spirit and in truth
[18:15] father not around a man's idea or even
[18:20] our own
[18:22] idea may we never take that for granted
[18:26] Lord that we're even Gathering and
[18:31] approaching the correct God and not a
[18:33] god of our
[18:36] imagination Lord we would just ask as we
[18:38] would come to this part of the
[18:41] service as we so often do
[18:47] Lord Lord
[18:50] we stand here as a mortal man task to do
[18:53] a supernatural
[18:56] thing and how full of ship would
[19:01] be to approach this
[19:04] moment thinking that we could do
[19:09] that father but there's those that would
[19:14] not be speaking this morning that would
[19:16] be hearing Lord and even your scripture
[19:19] says that we can't even hear but by the
[19:26] Lord say father we're asking that you
[19:30] would come this
[19:31] [Music]
[19:33] morning Lord that you would come and
[19:36] that you would be the speaker and that
[19:39] you would be the hearer for it's only if
[19:41] you will extend that Grace to us that
[19:45] anything will be accomplished here this
[19:47] morning
[19:48] Lord father if I had something to help
[19:52] the people I would most certainly give
[19:54] it I would most certainly say it I would
[19:56] most certainly do it Lord but you know
[19:58] know that I
[20:01] don't so we just ask that you would come
[20:04] now Lord that you would just set me
[20:06] aside and that you would accomplish what
[20:10] you want to accomplish here this morning
[20:12] Father we don't have an agenda this
[20:14] morning
[20:16] we we don't want to put you in a box and
[20:19] say that we that you have to do this or
[20:22] you have to do that or you have to do
[20:23] something a certain way Lord we we don't
[20:27] we don't have that agenda Lord our only
[20:30] prayer would
[20:32] be that this is not a service
[20:34] orchestrated by
[20:37] man Lord that this
[20:40] would not just be a sterile teaching
[20:44] father or a
[20:46] religious
[20:50] ceremony so we don't care how you do it
[20:52] father but we just pray that you would
[20:54] come and do the supernatural here this
[20:57] morning Lord
[20:59] and that you would change our lives to
[21:01] make us what you would have us be we
[21:05] just commit ourselves to you in the name
[21:07] of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[21:09] pray
[21:11] amen God bless you this
[21:15] morning let's take our Bibles turn to
[21:17] Mark
[21:23] 11 I want to greet any visitors that we
[21:27] have with us this morning
[21:31] and don't feel bad if you're
[21:34] disappointed because our pastor not
[21:39] preaching I would be disappointed as
[21:41] well so I can't even hold hold it
[21:43] against
[21:46] you it's so bad that I pay him $100 just
[21:49] not to announce it that way people will
[21:50] still show up
[21:59] Mark 11 I want
[22:02] to go back I thought I was done with
[22:06] this topic that I touched on last time
[22:07] on faith after Revelation but became
[22:12] very clear to me over the last several
[22:15] hours that I was not but I didn't know
[22:17] what I was missing until this
[22:20] morning so I want to go back and and
[22:24] pick this up and move forward with this
[22:28] thought
[22:29] thought but it's still based here in
[22:31] Mark
[22:32] 11 beginning in verse
[22:41] 22 and Jesus
[22:44] answered and Jesus answering saith unto
[22:47] them have faith in God
[22:52] Amen for verily I say unto you that
[22:55] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[22:57] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[22:59] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[23:02] but shall believe that those things
[23:04] which he saith shall come to pass he
[23:07] shall have whatsoever he
[23:09] saith therefore I say unto you that
[23:11] whatsoever you desire When you pray
[23:13] believe that you receive them and ye
[23:16] shall have
[23:20] them let's go let's go ahead and read
[23:23] this before we're seated let's go to
[23:25] Psalms 46
[23:41] Psalms
[23:43] 46 and verse
[23:50] 10 be
[23:53] still and know that I am
[23:56] God God bless you as you would have your
[23:58] seats this
[24:06] morning you say
[24:09] that's funny to try to tie those two
[24:11] scriptures
[24:12] together one is saying speak and it
[24:15] shall be given to you the other one
[24:17] saying be quiet and know that I'm God
[24:20] how do you correlate that how do you tie
[24:22] that
[24:24] together Hebrews 11:6 says but without
[24:28] faith it is impossible to please
[24:32] him for he that cometh to God must
[24:35] believe that he is and he is a rewarder
[24:37] of him of them that diligently seek him
[24:42] so if
[24:44] we're trying to please
[24:46] God scripturally speaking there's only
[24:50] one thing that we can do and that's to
[24:53] have
[24:54] faith because without faith we're never
[24:57] going to accompl accomplish
[24:59] that Luke 18:8
[25:02] says I tell you that he will avenge them
[25:05] speedily nevertheless the son when the
[25:07] son of man cometh shall he find faith on
[25:10] Earth and we've mentioned this several
[25:13] times recently but we can see the
[25:17] emphasis that is placed on this the
[25:19] emphasis that is put on faith that it
[25:24] would be the one thing that Christ is
[25:27] looking for
[25:29] when he returns to
[25:30] earth he's not
[25:33] looking for multiple other
[25:37] manifestations although no doubt they
[25:38] would be
[25:40] there but he's cons he's looking for one
[25:44] specific thing upon his
[25:48] return now I want to read this quote
[25:50] again this is the quote that we read um
[25:53] the last time I'll have speak to this
[25:55] mountain and we've we've covered the
[26:00] events surrounding this situation we
[26:03] know this is the time period that the
[26:09] third pole begin to come into
[26:12] manifestation this was the junction of
[26:15] the changing of the prophet's Ministry
[26:17] and there were
[26:19] several events going on at this time
[26:21] there was the test that brother brandham
[26:23] had to pass with the young couple in the
[26:26] audience uh to grant them Mercy
[26:28] rather than to pack them out dead and
[26:32] there were I'm I'm been very very
[26:35] intrigued with this Junction of time uh
[26:38] the last several months there is so much
[26:40] laying in it um that I'm becoming aware
[26:43] of so I want to go back and I want
[26:46] to read this and I want to emphasize a
[26:49] different
[26:50] part but brother ranam is out in the
[26:52] woods and he's
[26:54] hunting
[26:55] and this scripture keeps coming to him
[26:58] he says it keeps pulling on me was the
[27:00] words that he
[27:02] used and that scripture came to me again
[27:05] said whatsoever you say believe that
[27:07] what you say shall come to pass and you
[27:11] can have what you
[27:12] say says well I
[27:15] thought why does that scripture keep
[27:18] coming to
[27:19] me when I can't preach on it
[27:29] because I don't know nothing about
[27:33] it just Overlook my emotions here this
[27:40] morning this was the missing piece I was
[27:42] after for about the last 36
[27:46] hours so we have a prophet in the
[27:50] woods minding his own
[27:52] business trying to kill some
[27:55] squirrels and this scripture is pulling
[27:57] on him
[27:59] and pulling on
[28:00] him and he's so transparent and he's
[28:03] being so honest with God he's like he's
[28:05] asking God why are you pulling on me
[28:07] with that scripture I can't preach on
[28:10] that you know I can't preach on that
[28:12] what is the reason that he can't preach
[28:14] on it
[28:16] Saints is because he's admitting to God
[28:19] I don't know anything about
[28:21] that
[28:23] amen I can't go
[28:26] there I can't talk about about that if
[28:28] anybody ask me a question he has this
[28:30] little generic response that he had made
[28:32] up to you know get himself out of the
[28:35] out of the
[28:38] conversation but this Junction of time
[28:40] this turn of events this new ministry
[28:43] comes on the
[28:44] scene and the reason that it's coming on
[28:46] the scene is because there is a man on
[28:49] the scene who who has developed a
[28:52] character that he can be honest with
[28:55] God and he would be
[28:58] getting pulled on by a scripture a
[29:01] profound scripture a powerful scripture
[29:05] and instead of just jumping on that and
[29:07] taking off with his own ideas he would
[29:10] he would confess to God I why are you
[29:12] bothering me with this I can't do
[29:14] anything about it I don't know anything
[29:17] about
[29:23] this I just pray that that God will drop
[29:26] in your heart what he's dropped in my
[29:27] heart
[29:33] without the
[29:34] Saints the seventh seal cannot come into
[29:39] existence without this manifestation of
[29:42] character the program
[29:52] stops in Revelation
[29:55] 81 which is the seventh seal
[30:00] there is silence in heaven
[30:06] amen there is always
[30:10] silence proceeding the seventh
[30:13] seal and I don't want to box that in
[30:17] with that I'll say it this way there is
[30:19] always
[30:21] silence before a seventh seal
[30:24] manifestation amen
[30:28] always so the
[30:31] prophet in this
[30:34] situation he's just been honest and he's
[30:36] just communing with God but and maybe he
[30:41] realized that maybe he didn't I'm I'm
[30:43] prone to think that he didn't based on
[30:45] the statements that he's that he
[30:47] makes but
[30:50] inevitably God is remember this is God
[30:53] pulling on him with the scripture this
[30:55] is God wanting to turn a page this is
[30:57] God wanting to introduced the new
[30:58] ministry and inevitably brother brandom
[31:01] finds himself doing scripturally what
[31:05] must be
[31:08] done this
[31:11] story this
[31:13] event would not have transpired if his
[31:18] response to this scripture pulling on
[31:20] him would have been like oh yeah I've
[31:23] got some pretty good ideas on
[31:26] that great
[31:30] I think I've got a couple angles that I
[31:31] can talk about on that I see it you know
[31:34] in this way no this only moves
[31:38] forward when he confesses to God I don't
[31:41] know anything about that I cannot preach
[31:43] on
[31:47] that
[31:49] this is in 1959 November of
[31:55] 1959 almost a little over 3 years later
[31:59] this is the exact position that he finds
[32:02] himself when he comes to preach the
[32:05] seals why was he able to preach the
[32:09] seals why was the lamb able to come down
[32:14] step into a human vessel use his vocal
[32:16] cords and reveal the mysteries of God is
[32:21] because in November of 59 in the Woods
[32:23] by himself squirrel hunting he had the
[32:25] proper approach I don't know anything
[32:28] about this I can't preach on this I
[32:31] don't have any ideas yeah he finds
[32:34] himself now a little over 3 years later
[32:37] in a room with a series of meetings
[32:40] scheduled thousands of people there to
[32:43] stare at him and look at him and to tell
[32:45] us what the seals are and he has to come
[32:48] the the night before the first seal and
[32:50] he has to tell them I have no idea what
[32:53] the first seal
[32:56] is we we just so lightly take that put
[33:01] yourself in that position yeah right you
[33:05] have a worldwide Ministry you have
[33:09] thousands of people gathered you have a
[33:12] specific series and scriptures that you
[33:15] have proclaimed you're going to preach
[33:16] on and now as a man you have to stand
[33:20] there
[33:23] yeah and say oh by the way I have no
[33:25] idea how to preach what I've told you
[33:27] while I'm going to to
[33:28] preach I can't do it
[33:33] amen praise
[33:35] God we we so just lightly accept that we
[33:39] just so lightly read over
[33:42] that the
[33:46] turmoil that had to go along with this
[33:49] we just so lightly
[33:54] Overlook but the
[33:56] reason that he able to come to this
[33:59] point and come to this position is
[34:01] because this has been settled 3 years
[34:06] ago now he's entering
[34:11] in to this little room with his Bible
[34:15] with all these books of study and he is
[34:18] giving the most Gallant effort that he
[34:20] can give
[34:23] right and he's studying and he's praying
[34:26] and he's seeking
[34:29] God and he would come out and
[34:33] say even after all of
[34:37] that I about made a really really bad
[34:41] mistake
[34:45] today see this
[34:49] event of breaking out of
[34:53] humanity of breaking out of carnality
[34:56] I'm not talking even sin right this is
[34:58] not sinful this is a man
[35:02] studying like his life depends upon it
[35:05] this is a man giving everything that he
[35:07] has in a little room all to
[35:10] himself totally sold out to God seeking
[35:13] the answer to this question and yet and
[35:15] even approaching it with the right
[35:17] desire and the right motives with the
[35:19] right character and still the the
[35:22] pressure is so great and and the path is
[35:26] so twisting and so winding and so
[35:28] difficult that he still finds
[35:31] himself getting ready to inject man ID
[35:34] man's ID into it of what he thinks is
[35:38] the proper thing what he thinks is the
[35:40] right way to go
[35:44] right but what saved him
[35:48] Saints is because he had the proper
[35:54] character God knew that that he did not
[35:58] want to go with his own idea he was
[36:00] simply doing everything that he
[36:04] could this is the same position that he
[36:07] was
[36:08] on in when he was on the
[36:12] mountain and the storms moving
[36:14] in and to stand there is certain death
[36:17] you're going to freeze to death but his
[36:20] character comes forth and he admits Lord
[36:23] I thought I was a good Woodsman but I'm
[36:25] clearly not I have no idea what to do I
[36:27] have no which way to go so he confesses
[36:31] this there is this
[36:32] [Applause]
[36:34] silence he's admitting I've got nothing
[36:36] to say here I have no direction to go in
[36:40] here but I must do something this is the
[36:43] same situations the same places that
[36:47] he's finding himself in and he just
[36:49] confesses to God if I if I stand here at
[36:51] certain death I've got to do something
[36:53] so I'm going just to do the best that I
[36:56] know how and if I'm wrong you stop
[37:02] me the character development leading up
[37:06] to this
[37:07] event was years in the making Saints
[37:11] let's not just Overlook that and think
[37:13] this was a couple nights that brother
[37:15] brandham set himself aside in a little
[37:16] room for the Lord to come speak to him
[37:19] this was literally his life this started
[37:22] when he was born the tearing down the
[37:25] breaking down the dripping him away from
[37:28] any friends and relationships that he
[37:30] would have and drawing him only unto God
[37:34] this character was developed even from
[37:37] his
[37:38] youth that's
[37:40] right let's not get to the end of the
[37:44] story and just forget about everything
[37:46] that led up to
[37:49] it I'm not so certain but what the
[37:52] things leading up to it was more
[37:54] important
[38:01] that scripture came to me again
[38:02] whatsoever you say
[38:04] believe what you shall say shall come to
[38:06] pass and you can have what you say well
[38:08] I thought why does that keep scripture
[38:10] keep coming to me when I can't preach on
[38:12] it because I don't know nothing about
[38:15] it God responds he says do you think so
[38:18] this is God responding revealing the
[38:20] scripture to him do you think it was the
[38:22] prophets talking well I thought that's
[38:24] right if the person through the
[38:25] atonement Sanctified by the blood of
[38:27] Jesus Christ can live into a sphere with
[38:30] God so close that he can be wrapped so
[38:32] completely in God by the blood of Jesus
[38:35] that wouldn't be him talking it would be
[38:37] the Holy Spirit speaking those
[38:41] things so this scripture is pulling on
[38:45] him there is silence on his part I don't
[38:48] know nothing about this
[38:51] Lord what happens next a seventh seal
[38:55] manifest manifestation
[38:58] we're going to get to this in a minute
[38:59] but remember brother brandom says the
[39:01] seventh seal brings him back to Earth
[39:04] again
[39:06] Hallelujah so let's not think that the
[39:09] seventh seal was just a one night
[39:11] meeting topic that brother Brandon
[39:13] preached on the seventh seal brings God
[39:18] to Earth anytime that you see God coming
[39:23] back to earth that is a manifestation of
[39:26] the seventh seal
[39:28] and anytime you see that I challenge you
[39:31] to go search the scriptures and see if
[39:34] you don't find a moment of silence
[39:36] before
[39:39] that it is
[39:42] impossible for God to manifest himself
[39:46] on Earth or as shall I say in
[39:50] Earth that's right unless there is
[39:52] silence
[39:54] beforehand it is a must it is breaking
[39:57] the scriptures if there is
[40:03] not so he's silent on the topic admits
[40:06] Lord I have no idea to talk about that I
[40:09] cannot preach on that and immediately
[40:12] after this confession the Lord drops a
[40:15] thought in well do you think it was the
[40:17] prophet
[40:19] speaking the answer to the question
[40:22] immediately follows the
[40:25] silence one thought
[40:28] do you think it was the prophets talking
[40:30] well I thought that's
[40:32] right now that he has the answer he can
[40:36] see how it would work if it's through if
[40:39] that person through the atonement
[40:41] Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ
[40:44] can live into a sphere with God so close
[40:47] that he can be wrapped so completely in
[40:49] God by the blood of Jesus that wouldn't
[40:51] be him talking it would be the Holy
[40:53] Spirit speaking these things this is so
[40:56] profound to me it is so amazing to
[40:59] me how you can literally go from not
[41:03] having a clue about anything on a topic
[41:07] to having the answer to the topic am
[41:10] that's right in a moment's
[41:12] time how does that
[41:17] happen by being honest with
[41:22] God and saying Lord I don't
[41:25] know I'll tell you how it doesn't
[41:30] happen I think I can figure this
[41:34] out I think I can make this
[41:36] work I think I've got a work
[41:39] around I think I can explain
[41:47] this I'll tell you how it definitely
[41:49] won't
[41:53] work is I have to say something because
[41:56] what will the people think if I
[42:02] don't what will my spirituality level go
[42:07] to if I tell
[42:09] somebody I don't really know what that
[42:15] means I assure you that is a positive
[42:20] way to keep the seventh still from
[42:24] manifesting don't get hung up on that
[42:26] terminology remember the seventh seal
[42:27] was God returning to
[42:33] Earth want to keep God out of your
[42:36] life keep thinking you have the answer
[42:38] for
[42:41] everything keep answering all the
[42:45] questions never say I don't
[42:52] know and no more than I said that
[42:57] till the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[42:59] struck me like I've never had it in all
[43:01] my life God knows that I raised up to my
[43:04] feet I got
[43:06] scared something said to me now this is
[43:10] the beginning of your new
[43:11] ministry now ask what you will and it
[43:14] shall be given to
[43:16] you why
[43:19] now why now because a man could humble
[43:24] himself before God and say I don't know
[43:28] I don't know how that scripture works I
[43:31] don't even know why you keep pulling on
[43:33] me with it
[43:36] yeah now this is the beginning of your
[43:39] new
[43:46] ministry here's my question this morning
[43:49] and I'm going to repeat it several times
[43:50] as we go through some
[43:53] examples but I want you to tell me
[43:58] how brother brandham made God come give
[44:02] him that
[44:06] answer that was a dynamic
[44:12] event the third poll coming in
[44:17] manifestation the setting the stage for
[44:20] the seals to be loosed for the Thunders
[44:21] to be preached for Revelation 10:7 to be
[44:25] accomplished
[44:27] all of these things are hinging on this
[44:29] new ministry this Junction of time this
[44:31] turning of the
[44:33] corner and in an instant in a moment of
[44:36] time God just comes down and gives him
[44:37] the
[44:39] answer well do you think it was the
[44:41] prophet speaking oh well no it wasn't
[44:43] the prophet oh well if it wasn't the
[44:45] prophets that mean that if the person
[44:47] threw the
[44:48] atonement boom boom boom boom boom boom
[44:50] boom just lines right up for him how did
[44:54] he pull that down how did did he make
[44:57] that
[45:02] happen he didn't stand a
[45:08] chance God could have left him sitting
[45:10] out there in the woods for the rest of
[45:12] the day just
[45:15] pondering on this scripture just pulling
[45:18] on him with this
[45:20] scripture but the moment that that God
[45:24] starts pulling on him with this
[45:26] scripture and he has the appropriate
[45:30] response I don't know Lord I don't know
[45:34] I can't preach on it I don't
[45:38] know now the Dynamics can come down now
[45:42] the Dynamics can
[45:44] fall why is
[45:46] that because there was a mechanical
[45:49] approach to the
[45:51] Dynamics this was not brother Brandon
[45:53] sitting out in the woods wondering who's
[45:55] going to win the next football game
[45:58] this was not brother brandom you
[46:01] understand what I'm
[46:03] saying he's out there yielding himself
[46:07] to God pulling on him on a
[46:11] scripture he is approaching God
[46:15] mechanically he is quieting himself he's
[46:19] listening for the voice of
[46:22] God there's
[46:25] mechanics that were in play place there
[46:27] were a
[46:31] lifelong lifelong mechanics that were in
[46:34] place for
[46:39] this so we see a lot of times the
[46:42] Dynamics coming on the scene and we just
[46:44] focus on that
[46:47] part but what about before
[46:50] that what about before that what brought
[46:53] that on the
[46:55] scene so that's my question is how did
[46:57] Brother brandom do that the answer
[46:59] obviously is he didn't there is nothing
[47:02] that he could have done to answer that
[47:04] question even sitting there telling God
[47:06] I don't know I don't know I don't know I
[47:08] don't know that is the proper approach
[47:10] that is how to uh encourage God to move
[47:13] on the scene but it still doesn't
[47:16] obligate him to move on the scene right
[47:19] this is God's
[47:21] grace this is God saying I'm going to
[47:24] reveal something this is God saying I'm
[47:27] going to do something and because all
[47:29] the mechanics are in place there is no
[47:32] hindrance to
[47:35] that I think I've said this here before
[47:38] but I just want to repeat it when we
[47:40] look at this event and this changing of
[47:43] the
[47:45] ministry keep in mind this is the third
[47:50] pull not the third push
[47:57] do not try to bring the third push on
[48:01] the
[48:06] scene it is called the third pull for a
[48:11] reason brother brandom says this
[48:13] scripture was pulling on me this was not
[48:17] him sitting out there looking at that
[48:18] scripture saying I got to I got to
[48:20] preach on that nobody else knows how
[48:23] that works I I I got to I got to
[48:28] no this was a scripture pulling on him
[48:32] pulling on
[48:35] him
[48:36] amen so
[48:40] God as we preached last time God is here
[48:44] and he's dealing with the prophet's
[48:45] faith and he's encouraging him into this
[48:49] new ministry to speak and it shall be
[48:52] given to thee
[48:53] right and he's encouraging him he's
[48:56] drawing in him drawing him into that and
[48:59] as we uh expounded on last time at the
[49:02] same time as soon as he does that he
[49:04] starts testing his faith by delaying the
[49:07] appearing of the squirrels by delaying
[49:09] it so he's doing multiple things at the
[49:12] same time
[49:13] here
[49:15] but God is also not
[49:19] just teaching him about his faith and to
[49:22] believe that and to accept this new
[49:25] juncture and this new ministry
[49:27] but God is also revealing to him Psalms
[49:29] 46:10 that we just
[49:32] read be
[49:34] still and know that I am
[49:38] God he's revealing to this he he
[49:42] is uh
[49:45] enforcing enforcing this to him that
[49:49] this is a requirement for this new
[49:52] ministry I think there's a reason
[49:54] brother brandom had that over the pulpit
[49:56] at the time
[49:59] Tabernacle because this is his
[50:03] ministry if he would have never been
[50:05] still we would have never known
[50:09] God there's I don't know that they knew
[50:13] all of that when they put that up there
[50:14] or who even put that over top of the
[50:16] pull pit but I think that it's fitting
[50:19] and I think there's a reason for
[50:23] that Saints we're never going to come to
[50:26] the truth of this message and the
[50:28] fullness of this message through our own
[50:31] ideas through our own ways through our
[50:34] own
[50:37] efforts do we have the answers yes but
[50:41] are the answers going to be made known
[50:43] to us in their fullness and in their
[50:46] power when we're still hanging on to
[50:49] ourselves it's not going to work in the
[50:52] scripture the seventh seal was preceded
[50:55] by silence
[50:57] in the prophet's Ministry it was
[50:59] preceded by silence and by silence I
[51:02] don't necessarily mean what we would
[51:04] think of like no noise but silence is
[51:08] just a meting when you don't have
[51:09] nothing to
[51:11] say so you can say I have nothing to say
[51:14] and you're actually making noise but
[51:16] you're being silent
[51:32] brother brandom both times of the
[51:35] manifestation of the squirrels as we
[51:36] touched on last
[51:38] time was
[51:40] anointed spoke the
[51:42] word and then gave up and walked
[51:48] away he was actually being
[51:52] silent he gave
[51:55] up he gave
[51:57] up and we would say that was kind of in
[52:00] a bad way and look I'm not here to
[52:02] criticize like God only knows what I
[52:04] would have
[52:07] done so I'm not saying this like I would
[52:10] have done better or I've got the answers
[52:12] here this this is not critical
[52:16] preaching but just grasp this for a
[52:19] minute even after the
[52:21] anointing even after speaking it
[52:26] even after having a couple
[52:28] manifestations of it coming to
[52:32] pass the fullness of what he spoke the
[52:37] totality of what he
[52:39] spoke did not come to pass until there
[52:43] was another point of
[52:45] Brokenness another point of giving up
[52:49] another point of saying yes Lord you've
[52:51] done all of that
[52:54] but okay that's enough I'm just going
[52:57] I'm going home now there's another point
[53:00] of
[53:02] Silence whenever the third squirrel
[53:05] didn't show
[53:07] up he wasn't there stomping his foot on
[53:10] a log or shaking his fist in the air
[53:13] saying show up show up show up you've
[53:15] got to show up show up now I command you
[53:19] no he's broken he's silent before
[53:23] God to the point
[53:28] that he
[53:29] knows if you don't make it happen I
[53:33] can't make it happen I'm just going on
[53:37] home as bad as that sounds and as bad as
[53:41] that is in our mind it's still way
[53:45] better than the other yeah amen
[53:58] what if he interjects himself
[54:02] there you see what's no big deal it's
[54:05] squirrels it wasn't
[54:07] squirrels this was the opening of the
[54:12] seals what if think about this he comes
[54:15] and he breaks the first seal breaks the
[54:17] second seal breaks the third third seal
[54:20] and he don't get an answer in the little
[54:22] room before it's time to preach the
[54:23] fourth seal
[54:29] you want to know what would have
[54:30] happened I can tell you what would have
[54:33] happened because he demonstrated it he
[54:35] would have closed the meeting and he
[54:36] would have went
[54:37] home
[54:40] right you say you can't do that you've
[54:42] got all these thousands oh no oh no he
[54:47] can do it and he would have done it
[54:49] because that's what he did in the woods
[54:51] this answer was already
[54:53] settled praise God
[54:56] the damage that would have been
[54:59] done by him interjecting his own ideas
[55:02] on any of these seals yeah right would
[55:07] have ruined the entire Redemptive plan
[55:10] of
[55:15] God I wonder if we would have the
[55:18] courage to do that
[55:26] I wonder if we would have the courage to
[55:28] do
[55:30] that to
[55:34] admit I won't even make it before
[55:36] thousands of people I'll just make it a
[55:39] couple couple people to admit you know
[55:43] what I'm just going to keep my mouth
[55:44] shut cuz I don't
[55:48] know I just don't know
[55:59] 1955 the approach to
[56:02] God brother brandom is
[56:05] relaying a healing event that he had a
[56:08] vision of and it's about a little baby
[56:11] being healed very very early in his
[56:15] ministry so the man picked up the little
[56:17] boy in his arms excitable and run him
[56:20] over to me watch How I move
[56:24] there I didn't come
[56:26] the provided approach I said bring him
[56:30] here and I got in
[56:35] myself because I seen the vision was
[56:37] going to make him well but you have to
[56:40] come God's approach see and they brought
[56:43] him over there and I just laid my hands
[56:45] on him I said God I pray that you'll
[56:46] make this little fellow well you said
[56:48] that you would do
[56:53] it and the little fella gased three
[56:56] three or four times and passed out
[56:59] completely and I looked at him and his
[57:01] mother began to scream oh he's dead he's
[57:04] dead he's
[57:09] dead this is back in 1955 that he's
[57:12] learned this
[57:16] lesson and I thought well what's
[57:18] happened oh I thought there it
[57:20] is oh there's GM Snelling standing here
[57:23] he's the blond head man that's supposed
[57:25] to be sitting there and the there with
[57:27] the the curly hair but there's supposed
[57:29] to be an old woman sitting in this chair
[57:31] here there was the furniture and
[57:34] everything but it wasn't right I didn't
[57:36] come the right
[57:39] approach and that woman wasn't supposed
[57:41] to be standing there by her husband she
[57:43] was supposed to be leaning against the
[57:44] door and I thought oh god I've killed
[57:47] that baby oh
[57:51] my and the father laid the baby down and
[57:54] she started screaming and crying and
[57:55] everything and I just stood there I
[57:57] thought oh my what have I done what have
[57:59] I done and I want and I waited just a
[58:01] little while and the baby just barely
[58:03] living he got worse right now and I
[58:06] thought oh if I have been the cause of
[58:09] that if I just obeyed what he told me to
[58:15] do this is back in
[58:18] 55 a vision of a little baby being
[58:22] healed is the vision true absolutely is
[58:25] the vision accurate absolutely is the
[58:27] vision going to come to pass
[58:29] absolutely but what
[58:32] happened a man got
[58:35] excited saw the end of the story wanted
[58:37] to skip a couple Pages yeah right I'll
[58:41] just say it like he said it I got into
[58:47] myself Saints if God is not going to
[58:52] come on the scene and heal a little baby
[58:56] dying gasping for its life and allow it
[58:59] to get worse because the seventh angel
[59:02] messenger got a little couple steps
[59:04] ahead of the program do you think he is
[59:07] going to rewrite his entire Redemptive
[59:10] plan because we won't let loose of our
[59:12] own ideas or get out of our own way do
[59:14] you think the seventh seal is going to
[59:17] do you think God is going to return to
[59:19] Earth and in Earth yes when we won't
[59:23] humbly come before him and say Lord I
[59:26] don't know I don't stand a chance help
[59:29] me to get out of my
[59:32] way it has to be the proper approach not
[59:36] just in the Visions not just in the
[59:37] healings but for the big picture for the
[59:41] big picture we can scream message all we
[59:43] want we can scream bride all we want if
[59:46] we can't come and be
[59:53] silent being silent doesn't even mean
[59:56] you don't have the
[59:59] answer you may have the answer to the
[1:00:02] question you're simply forbidden to
[1:00:04] speak it
[1:00:06] amen we've got to be in tune with Christ
[1:00:09] we've got to be in tune with
[1:00:12] God to not only tell the truth but tell
[1:00:16] the truth at the appropriate time and
[1:00:18] tell the truth in the appropriate
[1:00:22] way this principle is so simple but it's
[1:00:25] so
[1:00:30] found there was a dynamic movement at
[1:00:34] the healing of this
[1:00:36] baby but it came after the prophet
[1:00:40] repented and after he put the
[1:00:43] appropriate mechanics in place the woman
[1:00:46] had to be standing and leaning against
[1:00:47] the door there had to be a man setting
[1:00:50] here there had to be a hat laying
[1:00:53] here and then Mark 11 comes into
[1:00:56] play then he can stand there and say do
[1:01:00] you still have faith in me as a sermon
[1:01:02] of Christ the man says yes then bring me
[1:01:04] the
[1:01:09] baby
[1:01:11] why because of the approach to God
[1:01:14] because of the silence if you go back
[1:01:16] and you read that story brother brandham
[1:01:18] sits down in a chair by the door and
[1:01:20] just shuts up right amen
[1:01:27] and that wasn't an easy thing to do
[1:01:29] because it got to the point brother
[1:01:30] Snelling had to go to
[1:01:33] work and he starts getting excited oh
[1:01:35] Lord but if he goes to work he's not
[1:01:36] going to be here the vision can't and
[1:01:39] then the little woman comes walking up
[1:01:40] the back
[1:01:42] door his frustrations didn't change
[1:01:46] anything him being silent is what
[1:01:49] changed
[1:01:51] things so just because we get flustered
[1:01:54] and we get excited
[1:01:56] and we have things pressing on
[1:02:00] us that doesn't move God Amen right
[1:02:04] right y
[1:02:06] y what moves God is when we'll
[1:02:10] acknowledge those
[1:02:12] things they are what they
[1:02:15] are I'm still keeping my mouth
[1:02:19] shut because regardless of how much it
[1:02:22] presses and how much it pulls and how
[1:02:26] excited I
[1:02:28] get I can't do anything any
[1:02:31] he right
[1:02:36] true my emotional
[1:02:40] unrest and my emotional
[1:02:43] distress is not going to cause God to
[1:02:45] come on the
[1:02:47] scene what's going to cause God to come
[1:02:50] on the scene is when I pass the test and
[1:02:53] I hush my mouth
[1:02:57] and I allow him to come on the scene
[1:02:58] when he chooses to come on the scene in
[1:03:00] the way that he chooses to come on the
[1:03:02] scene how he wants to come on the scene
[1:03:06] Hebrews 4:9 says there remaineth
[1:03:08] therefore a rest to the people of God
[1:03:10] for he that is entered into his rest
[1:03:15] he Oh you mean there's something that
[1:03:17] has to happen before
[1:03:18] that he also hath ceased from his own
[1:03:22] works
[1:03:26] we so often desire the
[1:03:30] rest but we're still doing our own
[1:03:38] works as God did from his let us labor
[1:03:42] therefore to enter into that
[1:03:46] rest let us labor mechanics amen but
[1:03:51] don't try to make the mechanics the
[1:03:53] Dynamics the Dynamics is answer to the
[1:03:56] problem the Dynamics is the seventh seal
[1:03:59] Christ coming on the scene don't try to
[1:04:02] sub The Mechanics for the Dynamics do
[1:04:04] the mechanics the mechanics is ceasing
[1:04:07] from your own
[1:04:10] works the mechanics is not fixing the
[1:04:13] problem yeah that's the
[1:04:17] Dynamics and God can even use you to do
[1:04:20] the
[1:04:22] Dynamics but it's not you and your works
[1:04:25] it's God God doing
[1:04:29] it you say well that's confusing if I'm
[1:04:32] doing it
[1:04:34] how God would tell the children of
[1:04:36] Israel don't you all make a Graven image
[1:04:39] and then he would come tell Moses hey go
[1:04:41] make a Graven
[1:04:45] image how does that
[1:04:48] work because it wasn't Moses doing it
[1:04:50] you say it was Moses doing it yes it was
[1:04:52] Moses doing it but it wasn't Moses doing
[1:04:53] it
[1:04:57] God told them don't you don't you make a
[1:05:01] Graven image that's right but if God
[1:05:03] tells you to make a grave in ebbage it's
[1:05:05] not you doing it now it's God doing it
[1:05:07] big difference he would tell them don't
[1:05:10] you all mix these oils and don't you do
[1:05:12] this don't and then he would come and
[1:05:13] say hey you all go mix some oils and
[1:05:15] pull it over pour it over
[1:05:17] Aaron who mixed the oils the men
[1:05:23] did amen who was mixing the s
[1:05:27] [Applause]
[1:05:29] God don't you all do
[1:05:33] this don't you all do
[1:05:36] this don't you all mechanically go and
[1:05:40] do
[1:05:42] this but when he tells them to do it
[1:05:46] it's not them doing
[1:05:49] it you say that's a paradox it is a
[1:05:51] paradox I wish I had the vocabulary to
[1:05:54] break it down to you and make you
[1:05:55] understand how that works but I don't
[1:05:58] am but there's a big difference of God
[1:06:01] doing something and man doing something
[1:06:03] yeah
[1:06:06] amen and if we'll approach God the right
[1:06:09] way
[1:06:10] Saints if we will approach him the right
[1:06:13] way with an honest and a pure
[1:06:18] heart I believe that he will reveal to
[1:06:22] us amen hey this is you trying to do
[1:06:25] something
[1:06:28] how many's had God do something in your
[1:06:31] life that you know you didn't
[1:06:36] do once that
[1:06:38] happens not saying beforehand but once
[1:06:42] God's Grace has ever extended into your
[1:06:45] life that one time just that one for me
[1:06:47] it just took one time to watch him do
[1:06:50] something that I knew I didn't have a
[1:06:52] hand in it and could have never done in
[1:06:56] a million years once I saw him do that
[1:06:58] one time every time that I've tried to
[1:07:02] do something myself now
[1:07:05] there it's just a flying the biscuit as
[1:07:08] brother R says there just something you
[1:07:10] know you know something's wrong you know
[1:07:14] that's
[1:07:15] right amen when that happens Saints
[1:07:19] don't keep pushing pull pull
[1:07:23] back pull back get out of the way yeah
[1:07:26] that's right now before he does
[1:07:30] that like we're just ignorant to the
[1:07:33] fact I I'm not even going to preach
[1:07:35] critical on that because I've been there
[1:07:36] done it I did it for years I was an
[1:07:39] expert at pushing and making things
[1:07:44] happen and there was always a little
[1:07:46] hiccup in it like it worked it happened
[1:07:50] but it just didn't fit you
[1:07:51] know am and then ultimately there's
[1:07:54] trouble at the end
[1:07:57] right but one time God in his Mercy
[1:08:02] coming down and doing something that I
[1:08:06] could then look at and
[1:08:07] say I did not do that no no no never in
[1:08:13] a million years could I have done
[1:08:15] that once that page is
[1:08:18] turned now you have something to check
[1:08:21] it by amen now you know clearly how it
[1:08:26] works when you're not involved right and
[1:08:29] when you start getting
[1:08:31] involved you feel that hesitation you
[1:08:33] feel that Kickback you feel this is this
[1:08:37] is not working and here's the funny part
[1:08:39] about
[1:08:40] this is everything can be going wrong
[1:08:43] and it can be the hardest trial of your
[1:08:45] life and the hardest situation of your
[1:08:47] life and I mean a struggle Beyond
[1:08:49] struggle but somehow you know it's easy
[1:08:53] it's just working
[1:08:55] everything is going but you know you're
[1:08:57] not doing
[1:09:00] it and if this was a situation to where
[1:09:03] it was just you trying to do something
[1:09:05] you'd have tapped out a long time ago
[1:09:06] and be like it ain't even worth it I
[1:09:08] give up but now you can have a situation
[1:09:11] that's even harder than all of that
[1:09:13] harder than the situation that you
[1:09:16] forced through and made
[1:09:18] happen but it's somehow
[1:09:21] easier in your spirit realm in your soul
[1:09:24] in your mind
[1:09:26] everything is okay it's just
[1:09:32] working how is
[1:09:35] that why is
[1:09:37] that it's the scripture being
[1:09:40] manifested it's the seventh seal working
[1:09:44] it's the approach to God working it's
[1:09:47] the mechanics being put in place so the
[1:09:49] Dynamics could fall you realize once the
[1:09:52] Dynamics come on the scene it doesn't
[1:09:54] matter
[1:09:55] how hard the situation is because the
[1:09:58] mechanics are in place for
[1:10:03] it you can
[1:10:07] have a
[1:10:09] rock that you can not budge by
[1:10:13] yourself it's a th000 lb Rock and you
[1:10:17] within yourself cannot move that
[1:10:21] rock but now when a Superduty truck
[1:10:24] pulls up
[1:10:27] up turbo diesel no doubt and hooks on to
[1:10:31] the Rock the Dynamics are on the scene
[1:10:38] right the mechanics were in place when
[1:10:41] you admitted I can't move the
[1:10:44] rock I need something else to move the
[1:10:47] rock once the truck shows
[1:10:51] up the problem solved I know that's a
[1:10:54] really simple analogy but I hope you can
[1:10:58] see now let's go spiritual with
[1:11:04] it when he shows up to do the
[1:11:08] Dynamics it doesn't matter anymore how
[1:11:11] much the struggle was it doesn't even
[1:11:14] matter the situation when he is on the
[1:11:18] scene the problem
[1:11:21] solved
[1:11:23] even even if the truck has to be put in
[1:11:27] four-wheel drive in low
[1:11:30] gear maybe some stuff put under the
[1:11:33] tires so that they don't spin it doesn't
[1:11:35] matter like it's going to
[1:11:36] work right the problem is solved but if
[1:11:40] you keep standing there shoving on that
[1:11:42] rock and not calling your buddy to bring
[1:11:44] the truck it's not going to move it's
[1:11:47] the same thing spiritually you can shove
[1:11:49] all you want Saints that's not the
[1:11:51] approach to God
[1:11:53] amen amen
[1:12:02] for he that has entered into his rest
[1:12:04] hath also ceased from his own Works
[1:12:08] remember the rest is the Holy Spirit the
[1:12:10] rest is the comforter how many wants
[1:12:11] rest how many wants the comforter how
[1:12:13] many wants the spirit of
[1:12:16] Truth let us labor therefore to enter
[1:12:20] into that
[1:12:21] rest let us do what the scripture says
[1:12:24] let's cease from our own works you say
[1:12:26] well that's easy to say but how do we do
[1:12:28] that the very next verse Hebrews 9:12
[1:12:33] for the word of God is quick and
[1:12:35] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:12:38] sword
[1:12:41] piercing if you want to cease from your
[1:12:43] own
[1:12:44] Works you've got to allow the word of
[1:12:47] God to come into your life and Pierce
[1:12:53] you see us in hybrid flesh we're so bad
[1:12:56] off we don't even know how bad off we
[1:12:58] are and if the word of God does not show
[1:13:02] up and Pierce even to the dividing aend
[1:13:05] of Soul and Spirit and of the joints in
[1:13:07] the marrow and a discerner of the
[1:13:09] thoughts and the intents of the hearts
[1:13:11] if it doesn't show up and we don't allow
[1:13:14] it to pierce us and reveal to us our
[1:13:18] real intentions our real motives our
[1:13:20] real
[1:13:21] objectives what we're really pushing for
[1:13:24] what we're really pulling for if we
[1:13:26] don't allow that to happen we're not
[1:13:29] going to cease from our own
[1:13:31] works and if we don't cease from our own
[1:13:35] Works don't expect to have
[1:13:39] rest the answer is in the
[1:13:42] Scripture A lot of times it's just the
[1:13:44] verse before or the verse after that we
[1:13:46] don't really want to
[1:13:48] read having the word of God Pierce you
[1:13:52] asunder and split your very Soul and
[1:13:55] Spirit is not a pleasant
[1:14:01] experience but it is a
[1:14:03] requirement
[1:14:05] am it is a
[1:14:08] requirement for
[1:14:11] rest for
[1:14:13] peace for God to do something in our
[1:14:18] lives perfect strength by Perfect
[1:14:20] weakness brother random says if you
[1:14:21] notice in the Bible it's always those
[1:14:23] who are trying to get away from it that
[1:14:24] God
[1:14:25] uses as long as a man wants to do
[1:14:28] something and thinks he's got enough
[1:14:29] ability he can put the job over God can
[1:14:32] never use that
[1:14:35] man look at Moses running look at Paul
[1:14:38] running and the rest of them trying to
[1:14:39] get away from it I said don't seek
[1:14:43] nothing God has got anything for you
[1:14:46] he'll give it to you
[1:14:50] amen instead of trying to be great we
[1:14:53] ought to be trying to find out how
[1:14:55] little we can get but when we are
[1:14:56] thinking that we are able to do it then
[1:14:59] God can't use us because we're wanting
[1:15:01] to do it ourselves one of the important
[1:15:03] things that we must Master now remember
[1:15:06] this and especially you young preachers
[1:15:08] and lay members alike there's one thing
[1:15:11] that you've got to master if we expect
[1:15:13] to fulfill God's desire in our life that
[1:15:16] is we have to master the thought of
[1:15:18] human
[1:15:20] ability what a thought yeah that's right
[1:15:24] how many wants God to manifest himself
[1:15:26] in your life to its fullness he just
[1:15:28] gave us the key let us
[1:15:32] Master let us Master the thought of
[1:15:35] human
[1:15:38] ability if we ever get to a spot where
[1:15:40] we think that we can do it with our own
[1:15:42] intelligence and our own abilities we've
[1:15:44] got to master that in such a way that we
[1:15:46] can get rid of the thing and lay it
[1:15:47] aside that so so that God can use us and
[1:15:50] to make a complete
[1:15:53] surrender amen
[1:15:55] we cannot use one
[1:16:03] ability this is such a simple principle
[1:16:06] but this is the principle that allowed
[1:16:09] the seals to be
[1:16:12] loosed if this is the principle that
[1:16:14] allowed the seals to be preached why do
[1:16:18] we think there's going to be another
[1:16:19] principle that's going to allow the
[1:16:21] seals to be manifest in our life if this
[1:16:24] this is the requirement for them to be
[1:16:27] sounded is this not going to be the same
[1:16:30] principle for them to be
[1:16:35] lived we cannot use one ability you know
[1:16:39] the interesting thing about this
[1:16:41] statement is that might mean that you
[1:16:43] have the
[1:16:46] ability like it's no challenge if you
[1:16:48] don't have an
[1:16:50] ability I've gave you the mechanic
[1:16:53] example before
[1:16:55] I have zero ability as a mechanic
[1:16:58] something goes wrong with the car I'm
[1:17:00] not going to try to figure it out I know
[1:17:03] there's no hope it's going down to the
[1:17:06] mechanic but what if it's a situation
[1:17:09] that I do have a natural ability
[1:17:14] about now look you can go fanatical with
[1:17:17] this I
[1:17:18] know we don't need to be fanatical but
[1:17:21] we do need to be spiritual
[1:17:25] what if it is a situation that you have
[1:17:28] an ability to do something about
[1:17:32] it the prophet is telling us you better
[1:17:36] master and
[1:17:38] discern when it's you using an ability
[1:17:42] or when it's God using your
[1:17:44] ability amen just because you have an
[1:17:48] ability doesn't mean you can use that
[1:17:50] ability
[1:17:58] amen you've got to let that discern in
[1:18:00] your own
[1:18:02] lives you know what abilities you think
[1:18:04] you have just as well as I know what
[1:18:07] abilities I think I
[1:18:09] have so I can't speak for you but I can
[1:18:12] speak for myself God by his grace put a
[1:18:14] gift to minister the gospel into my
[1:18:17] life why do I have to be in turmoil for
[1:18:21] hours before I come behind the pull
[1:18:23] pit it's an
[1:18:25] ability there is an ability to pick up
[1:18:28] the Bible and preach the word yes I
[1:18:32] didn't put it there God put it there
[1:18:33] it's not like I can even take credit for
[1:18:35] that but even within that ability I
[1:18:37] cannot do
[1:18:41] that I can't do that even if I have a
[1:18:45] good thought that I want to preach I
[1:18:47] can't do
[1:18:49] that because it would fail
[1:18:55] it has to be an
[1:18:57] ability a true ability surrender to God
[1:19:01] Amen so that God can pick up the ability
[1:19:05] and then preach the
[1:19:07] word amen you say that's a Razor's Edge
[1:19:11] it is true and that's what brother
[1:19:13] brandom said we would come to we would
[1:19:16] come to a Razor's
[1:19:19] Edge this is the
[1:19:22] conundrum like I said I can just speak
[1:19:24] for a minister cuz that's the position
[1:19:25] I'm in you put it on whatever foot that
[1:19:28] the shoe
[1:19:31] fits we have an entire Bible and 12200
[1:19:37] tapes but what if I would come and
[1:19:39] preach something other than what he once
[1:19:41] preached for that point in time right
[1:19:44] that's terrifying yeah I'm not terrified
[1:19:47] to preach I love to
[1:19:50] preach you all know that when it's 10:00
[1:19:52] on Wednesday night I love to
[1:19:55] preach what terrifies me is if I'm
[1:20:08] preaching what terrifies me is if I
[1:20:12] would come here this morning and I would
[1:20:14] have something to
[1:20:16] say what terrifies me is if I would come
[1:20:20] here and I would think what needs to be
[1:20:22] done exactly it's
[1:20:25] terrifying it will put you in places you
[1:20:28] don't want to be in it will have you
[1:20:32] looking for really tall
[1:20:36] Bridges it's
[1:20:40] terrifying but when he comes and he
[1:20:44] picks up an
[1:20:45] ability it just
[1:20:48] works it's joyful it's
[1:20:52] peaceful we can stay here all day praise
[1:20:55] God and according to Franco I have
[1:20:58] batteries to support
[1:21:03] it
[1:21:04] but this mechanical
[1:21:07] approach has to be in place for the
[1:21:10] Dynamics to work
[1:21:11] right and I wish I could tell you that
[1:21:14] I've got it right every time but I
[1:21:15] haven't there have been times I've stood
[1:21:16] behind the pull pit and I had a thought
[1:21:18] and I presented a thought and it was the
[1:21:20] word of God and it didn't work
[1:21:24] why because I failed to master that's
[1:21:28] right human ability that's right was
[1:21:30] there an ability yes could I do it yes
[1:21:33] did it work no why cuz the prophet said
[1:21:35] it
[1:21:37] wouldn't but when we will approach God
[1:21:39] the right
[1:21:43] way God can
[1:21:46] even do something that you don't have an
[1:21:50] ability to do that's right God
[1:21:54] yes sir I hope this is speaking to
[1:21:57] somebody this morning because I know I'm
[1:21:59] saying the same thing over and over and
[1:22:04] over Souls that are in prison now
[1:22:06] brother brand says a man that's got the
[1:22:07] spirit of God in him or a woman lives
[1:22:09] the word that's the heartbeat the
[1:22:11] predestinated for the word of God comes
[1:22:13] to them and they are the word to the
[1:22:17] people what a
[1:22:22] statement that's the heartbeat that
[1:22:24] predestin at for the word of the Lord
[1:22:26] comes to them and they are the word to
[1:22:28] the people written Epistles read of all
[1:22:31] men is that right could the third poll
[1:22:34] be on is the third poll to preach to the
[1:22:37] Eternal doomed that's rejected the
[1:22:39] message of
[1:22:42] Salvation And this is where he makes
[1:22:44] this statement the six seal has produced
[1:22:47] itself uh speaking of the judgments
[1:22:48] coming on the earth The Sixth Seal has
[1:22:51] produced itself the seventh seal brings
[1:22:54] him back to
[1:22:58] Earth I find it extremely interesting
[1:23:02] that he makes that statement immediately
[1:23:05] after he says that the word of God comes
[1:23:07] to this group of people and they are the
[1:23:10] word to the
[1:23:14] people what is the seventh
[1:23:18] seal the seven seal is not a piece of
[1:23:21] paper wrote up with a stamp on it
[1:23:28] the seventh seal is when Christ comes
[1:23:32] back to Earth that's why brother brandom
[1:23:35] said I can take one of these seals and I
[1:23:38] can go from Genesis to Revelation and I
[1:23:40] can preach it around and around and
[1:23:42] around the clock because the seventh
[1:23:44] seal is not a definition of the
[1:23:47] interpretation of these symbols the
[1:23:50] seventh seal is an event and the seventh
[1:23:53] seal was all the way way back in Genesis
[1:23:55] it wasn't just in Revelation it's just
[1:23:57] not now it's now that we
[1:24:01] understand it's now that we can see that
[1:24:03] it was all the way back but it was still
[1:24:05] going on back
[1:24:07] then because why because the seventh
[1:24:10] seal is when Christ comes back to
[1:24:14] Earth let me say it this way the seventh
[1:24:17] seal is when Christ shows up in your
[1:24:22] situation amen the seventh seal is not
[1:24:26] when you show up in your
[1:24:28] situation the seventh seal is Christ
[1:24:31] coming into your
[1:24:34] situation amen he says the six seal has
[1:24:37] produced itself obviously six comes
[1:24:40] right before seven what's the Sixth Seal
[1:24:43] judgment what brings the seventh seal
[1:24:47] judgment we've got to judge ourselves
[1:24:50] understand that we're not worthy
[1:24:52] understand that we don't stand a chance
[1:24:54] understand that we can't fix this
[1:24:55] problem amen mechanically approach the
[1:25:00] seventh seal the mechanics have to be in
[1:25:03] place the mechanics are judging
[1:25:07] ourselves coming to the appropriate
[1:25:09] conclusion that I have no human ability
[1:25:11] to fix this or to Manifest this or to
[1:25:14] make this word of God
[1:25:17] live and then and only then the seventh
[1:25:20] seal can come back to earth
[1:25:25] the lamb came and took the book out of
[1:25:27] the right hand of him and sat down
[1:25:28] claimed what he owned what he had
[1:25:30] redeemed is that right it's always been
[1:25:32] that third poll three is perfection the
[1:25:35] ministry comes to its Perfection when it
[1:25:38] reproduced Christ again in natural among
[1:25:41] human
[1:25:45] beings what is the Perfection what is
[1:25:48] the purpose what is the third
[1:25:51] poll I mean we can spend days and hours
[1:25:55] and services on
[1:25:57] that the third poll brother brandom says
[1:26:01] comes to its Perfection when Christ
[1:26:03] comes back in Earth in your Earth that's
[1:26:07] the
[1:26:08] point but that is only going to
[1:26:11] happen when we judge ourselves
[1:26:15] properly Revelation 81 and when he had
[1:26:17] opened the seventh seal there was
[1:26:19] silence in heaven about the space of a
[1:26:22] half an hour
[1:26:25] now we're going to go through just a few
[1:26:27] examples and then we're going to
[1:26:30] close Daniel
[1:26:33] 3:16 Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:26:35] answered and said unto the king oh
[1:26:37] Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[1:26:38] answer thee in this matter if it be so
[1:26:41] our God whom we serve is able to Deliver
[1:26:43] Us From The Burning fiery furnace and we
[1:26:44] will deliver and he will deliver us out
[1:26:46] of thine hand O King but if
[1:26:52] not you know what that means
[1:26:55] that's right is they're having faith and
[1:26:58] they are believing but they don't really
[1:27:07] know but if
[1:27:10] not be it known unto you oh King that we
[1:27:14] shall not serve thy God nor worship the
[1:27:16] golden image which thou has set up that
[1:27:19] means here's my problem and God is able
[1:27:22] to deliver me and I believe God will
[1:27:25] deliver me I believe God is going to
[1:27:27] provide an answer for the situation that
[1:27:29] I am in now but if he doesn't I'm still
[1:27:33] not going to do what you're telling me
[1:27:36] to do I am still not going to prostrate
[1:27:39] myself before a false
[1:27:42] god I am still not going to subject
[1:27:46] myself to my own ideas I am even if he
[1:27:50] doesn't come on the scene I am still
[1:27:53] going not going to figure this out
[1:28:00] myself I find it amazing that brother
[1:28:02] brandham would say the bride of Christ
[1:28:05] will have thus saith the
[1:28:09] Lord or keep
[1:28:13] still see there's two things there it's
[1:28:15] just not always having thus sayith the
[1:28:17] Lord right it's having thus sayith the
[1:28:21] Lord or not having thus sayith the Lord
[1:28:23] and keeping your mouth shut that's
[1:28:25] righten there are two
[1:28:28] options we don't always have to be the
[1:28:30] spiritual person in the room with all
[1:28:32] the answers and all that thus sayith the
[1:28:33] Lord right there is a second option
[1:28:36] there
[1:28:37] amen I don't
[1:28:40] know but if he has anything for me he
[1:28:43] will reveal it to
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:46] me be it known unto thee that we will
[1:28:49] not serve thy God nor worship the golden
[1:28:50] image which which thou Hast set up then
[1:28:53] was Nebuchadnezzar are full of Fury I'm
[1:28:55] going to paraphrase some of this just
[1:28:56] for time sake and he wrapped them up
[1:28:58] with rope threw them into fire the
[1:29:01] people that threw him in fire obviously
[1:29:04] didn't have the right mechanical
[1:29:05] approach to God and they
[1:29:08] died and he answers and said
[1:29:13] Lo did not we cast three men into the
[1:29:15] midst of the fire they answered and said
[1:29:17] unto the king true oh King factual that
[1:29:19] is right undisputable we put three men
[1:29:22] in the fire he answered and said I see
[1:29:24] four men loose walking in the midst of
[1:29:27] the fire and they have no hurt and in
[1:29:29] the and the form of the fourth is like
[1:29:32] the Son of
[1:29:33] God then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the
[1:29:36] mouth of the burning firey furnace and
[1:29:38] spake and
[1:29:39] said ye Servants of the most high God
[1:29:42] come forth and come hither and they came
[1:29:44] forth and came
[1:29:46] hither then nabuchadnezzar spake and
[1:29:48] said blessed be the god of Shadrach
[1:29:50] Meshach and Abednego who hath sent his
[1:29:52] Angel and delivered his servants that
[1:29:54] trusted in him and have changed the
[1:29:56] king's word and yielded their bodies
[1:30:01] that they might not serve nor worship
[1:30:03] any God except their own God the Fourth
[1:30:05] Man In The Fire we love the story it's
[1:30:08] encouraging we love it we want to talk
[1:30:10] about it all the time what's the
[1:30:12] prerequisite to the Fourth Man In The
[1:30:17] Fire silence yeah silence Our God can
[1:30:22] but I don't know if he will that's right
[1:30:24] even if he doesn't I'm not going to
[1:30:25] violate his word there is a mechanical
[1:30:28] approach here what's the mechanical
[1:30:29] approach is we are obeying the word of
[1:30:31] God this is the word of God it says Thou
[1:30:33] shalt not do this we are not going to do
[1:30:35] this even if we don't know the ultimate
[1:30:37] outcome yeah amen amen we don't know
[1:30:41] what God's going to do here we believe
[1:30:43] that he will we know that he can but we
[1:30:46] don't
[1:30:50] know but in the meantime we're going to
[1:30:53] start building some matters we're going
[1:30:55] to go get some real heavy clothing to
[1:30:56] put
[1:30:58] on anybody got a really big bucket of
[1:31:02] water no it was simple here's the
[1:31:06] problem here's the word that says what
[1:31:08] we can do and what we can't do it
[1:31:12] doesn't say what God's going to do so
[1:31:15] I'm going to speak where he speaks and
[1:31:17] I'm going to be silent where he's silent
[1:31:20] and I'm going to approach him with the
[1:31:21] right mechanics and then I'm going to
[1:31:23] allow him to to do what only he can do
[1:31:25] because I can't deliver myself from this
[1:31:28] fiery
[1:31:36] furnace I want to go back to verse 19
[1:31:38] and read because I think there's
[1:31:39] something extremely interesting in this
[1:31:41] verse then Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury
[1:31:44] and his form of his Vis Vis was changed
[1:31:46] against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:31:48] therefore he spake and commanded that
[1:31:50] they should heat the SE the furnace one
[1:31:52] seven times more than it was want to be
[1:31:56] heated I wonder if that's a
[1:32:00] clue I wonder if that's a clue to
[1:32:04] them wonder if it's a clue to
[1:32:07] us God is about to come back to earth
[1:32:10] again God is about to appear in flesh
[1:32:14] again God is about to come on the scene
[1:32:17] and fix the
[1:32:18] problem the seventh seal is about to be
[1:32:21] manifested
[1:32:24] he didn't heat it four times
[1:32:27] more it was heated up seven
[1:32:30] times why because there was silence
[1:32:34] immediately preceding
[1:32:36] that Exodus 78 and the Lord spake unto
[1:32:39] Moses and Aaron saying when Pharaoh
[1:32:40] shall speak unto you saying show a
[1:32:42] miracle for you then shalt thou say unto
[1:32:44] Aaron take thy rod and cast it before
[1:32:46] pharaoh and it shall become a serpent
[1:32:48] and Moses went and Aaron went unto
[1:32:49] pharaoh and they did as the Lord had
[1:32:52] commanded
[1:32:57] mechanics mechanics they did as the Lord
[1:33:02] commanded and Aaron cast his rod down
[1:33:04] before pharaoh and before his servants
[1:33:06] and it became a serpent then Pharaoh
[1:33:08] also called called the wise men and the
[1:33:10] sorcerers now the M magicians of Egypt
[1:33:13] they also did in like manner with their
[1:33:14] enchantments for they cast down every
[1:33:16] man his rod and they became serpents
[1:33:19] well bummer that sure didn't go the way
[1:33:22] we thought it was going to
[1:33:28] let's let's go get some more sticks and
[1:33:32] throw them down and maybe if we get more
[1:33:35] sticks we'll have more
[1:33:41] serpents no brother brandham said Moses
[1:33:45] stood
[1:33:46] there and he did not know what to do
[1:33:50] that's
[1:33:52] ex God did not show him the whole
[1:33:54] picture God just said you go do
[1:33:57] this and if everything goes sideways and
[1:34:00] everything doesn't turn out the way you
[1:34:03] think just just be
[1:34:09] quiet no doubt Moses being a man was
[1:34:12] like
[1:34:17] uhoh yep that's all I
[1:34:22] got that's all I got no doubt he was
[1:34:24] fervently
[1:34:25] praying Lord this don't look good that's
[1:34:29] right I'll tell you one thing Moses
[1:34:31] didn't do is he didn't try to fix the
[1:34:35] problem the reason the scripture
[1:34:38] continues and says but Aaron's Rod
[1:34:40] swallowed up their
[1:34:42] rods is because Moses and Aaron didn't
[1:34:45] try to fix the problem and then the
[1:34:47] scriptures right before that it says
[1:34:49] they did what God commanded them to do
[1:34:52] they had the right mechanical approach
[1:34:55] to allow God to dynamically come on the
[1:34:58] scene Genesis 7:5 and Noah did according
[1:35:01] to all the Lord commanded
[1:35:04] him if you're spiritual you're going to
[1:35:06] grasp a theme
[1:35:08] here he did according to all that the
[1:35:11] Lord commanded him and Noah was 600
[1:35:14] years old when the flood of waters was
[1:35:15] upon the Earth Noah went in his sons his
[1:35:18] wife his wife's Sons with him his son's
[1:35:20] wife's with him into the ark because of
[1:35:21] the Waters of the flood of the clean
[1:35:23] beasts and of the beasts that are not
[1:35:25] clean and of fouls and of everything
[1:35:26] that creepeth upon the Earth there went
[1:35:29] in two and two unto Noah unto the arc
[1:35:31] the Mel and the female as God hath
[1:35:32] commanded Noah and it came to pass after
[1:35:35] seven
[1:35:39] days the Noah said Lord It's kind of
[1:35:42] stinking in
[1:35:44] here I preached for 120 years
[1:35:50] remember
[1:35:52] um okay you don't know it's not raining
[1:35:59] Lord here's my question that ask you
[1:36:01] before what did Noah do to make it
[1:36:08] rain how did Noah make God fulfill his
[1:36:14] word how did Noah bring the fullness of
[1:36:19] the promised word for his day into
[1:36:22] effect for every everybody to
[1:36:27] see the answer is always the answer he
[1:36:33] didn't there was not a single thing
[1:36:37] Moses could do to make it rain he's in
[1:36:41] the boat God has shut the door and there
[1:36:45] is nothing he can do
[1:36:52] nothing and that is the only position
[1:36:55] that he can be in for God to then do the
[1:36:57] Dynamics for then God to open The
[1:37:01] Fountains of the
[1:37:04] deep verse
[1:37:06] 10 and they did so as the Lord had
[1:37:10] commanded
[1:37:12] them I'm sorry verse 5 and Noah did
[1:37:16] according unto all that the Lord
[1:37:17] commanded
[1:37:19] him Noah put the mechanics in place
[1:37:24] and didn't touch the Dynamics no doubt
[1:37:27] being a man he may have got
[1:37:29] frustrated as brother brandom dramatizes
[1:37:32] it his family was kind of giving him a
[1:37:34] little bit of
[1:37:40] grief can I give you some advice from
[1:37:43] somebody who's about to be 40 who really
[1:37:44] don't know anything so take it for what
[1:37:47] you
[1:37:48] want when Daddy don't know the answer
[1:37:51] don't make Daddy come up with an answer
[1:37:56] when your husband don't know the
[1:37:59] answer be glad that he's honest enough
[1:38:01] to tell you you don't know the
[1:38:05] answer don't make Daddy or husband come
[1:38:07] up with an
[1:38:09] answer just get in the boat let God shut
[1:38:13] the door do all of the me the mechanics
[1:38:16] do all that God's told you to
[1:38:18] do and then let God provide the
[1:38:21] answer because if Daddy comes with the
[1:38:23] answer or the husband comes up with the
[1:38:25] answer here's a better one for you don't
[1:38:27] expect the pastor to have all the
[1:38:31] answers that was fresh just for
[1:38:38] you don't expect
[1:38:42] anybody don't force
[1:38:44] anybody into having the
[1:38:49] answer approach god with the right
[1:38:52] mechanics allow God to supernaturally
[1:38:56] move on the
[1:39:00] scene is the daddy the one that's
[1:39:02] supposed to get the answer sure is the
[1:39:05] husband the one sure is the pastor the
[1:39:07] one sure is the prophet the one that was
[1:39:08] supposed to have the
[1:39:10] sure but allow it to be
[1:39:14] God through that
[1:39:16] vessel because if it's just that vessel
[1:39:19] Daddy's answer is going to not it's
[1:39:21] going to fail
[1:39:23] husband's answer it's going to
[1:39:25] fail pastor's answer it's going to fail
[1:39:28] might work several times in a row but
[1:39:29] it'll eventually fail the prophet's
[1:39:31] answer it's going to fail that's why he
[1:39:34] would tell that
[1:39:36] lady that she was wanting him just say
[1:39:38] thus sayith the Lord just say it brother
[1:39:39] BR just say this is a lady with faith
[1:39:41] you just say it I'll believe it it'll
[1:39:43] happen he says I can't that's right yeah
[1:39:45] amen I want to but I can't but when he
[1:39:49] tells me to say it I'll say
[1:39:50] it big difference such a simple
[1:39:54] principle we violate it every
[1:39:58] day you
[1:40:00] can put whatever vessel that you want to
[1:40:02] in there husband father Pastor Prophet
[1:40:06] mother school teacher mechanic don't
[1:40:09] force your mechanic to have the
[1:40:14] answer it won't
[1:40:19] work a true mechanic is Anointed to be a
[1:40:22] mechanic if there's any body that's
[1:40:23] anoint that's got to be anointed it's
[1:40:26] somebody that works on
[1:40:29] cars Ruth 3 verse 5 and she said unto
[1:40:33] her Ruth speaking to
[1:40:35] Naomi all that thou sayest unto me I
[1:40:38] will
[1:40:40] do we catching the theme
[1:40:43] amen and she went down under the floor
[1:40:45] and did according to all that her
[1:40:47] mother-in-law B
[1:40:49] her meaning she put the mechanics in
[1:40:52] place and when Boaz had
[1:40:54] entered he when he had eaten and drunk
[1:40:57] and his heart was merry he went to lie
[1:40:58] down at the end of the Heap of corn and
[1:41:00] she came softly and uncovered his feet
[1:41:02] and laid down and it came to pass at
[1:41:03] midnight that the man the man was afraid
[1:41:05] and he turned himself and behold a woman
[1:41:07] lay at his feet and he said who art thou
[1:41:10] and she said she answered I am Ruth thy
[1:41:12] handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over
[1:41:14] thy handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman
[1:41:16] and he
[1:41:19] said blessed be thou of the Lord my
[1:41:22] daughter
[1:41:25] what did Ruth
[1:41:28] do what strings did she
[1:41:32] pull to get this response out of Boaz
[1:41:36] Boaz could have easily stood up and said
[1:41:37] I don't know what you're doing here but
[1:41:39] you are obviously in a compromising
[1:41:41] position you are threatening my
[1:41:44] reputation we're taking you before the
[1:41:48] elders why did she get the response that
[1:41:51] she was looking for prise God what did
[1:41:54] she do to make that
[1:41:57] happen the answer once again is nothing
[1:42:00] amen she had no
[1:42:03] ability no ability to make Boaz respond
[1:42:07] favorably to
[1:42:09] her how did she get this Dynamic
[1:42:12] response that changed her entire
[1:42:15] life because she did
[1:42:18] mechanically what she was told to do she
[1:42:21] did mechanically what the word of God
[1:42:22] said to
[1:42:25] do you know when Ruth got there and laid
[1:42:28] herself down I'm pretty sure she was
[1:42:33] silent I don't think she had a lot to
[1:42:35] say at that
[1:42:36] time I think she realized she was
[1:42:38] hanging between life and death and she
[1:42:41] probably better just be quiet and pray
[1:42:43] that God moves on the scene and pray
[1:42:45] that she's done everything mechanically
[1:42:47] right and if she hasn't that God will
[1:42:49] reveal it she she can fix it real quick
[1:42:52] fast like in a hurry
[1:42:53] because things are really coming to a
[1:42:58] climax but the one thing she didn't do
[1:43:01] she didn't open her
[1:43:03] mouth until Boaz spoke to her and Boaz
[1:43:06] said now my daughter fear not I will do
[1:43:09] to thee all that thou requirest for all
[1:43:12] the city and my people doth know that
[1:43:14] thou art a virtuous
[1:43:16] woman there is nothing Ruth could have
[1:43:19] done to pull that down to make that
[1:43:21] happen to make the Redeemer come on the
[1:43:24] scene follow me
[1:43:26] please there is nothing she could have
[1:43:28] done to make the Redeemer come on the
[1:43:31] seene for the seventh seal to be this is
[1:43:33] the seventh seal Saints this is Christ
[1:43:36] coming to Earth again for for Ruth's
[1:43:41] sake why was it
[1:43:44] manifested because of the proper
[1:43:46] approach that's right
[1:43:48] amen and the servant Genesis 2 249 and
[1:43:52] the servant put his hand on of the thigh
[1:43:53] of Abraham his master and swear to him
[1:43:56] concerning the
[1:43:57] matter I'm going to interpret that for
[1:43:59] you Abraham said you go and do this
[1:44:03] elaser put his hand under his thigh and
[1:44:05] swore I'm going to do what you told me
[1:44:06] to do that's right
[1:44:10] ex the proper approach I'm going to skip
[1:44:14] through some of this because I think
[1:44:16] we're getting the point and for time's
[1:44:18] sake but I want to ask you how did
[1:44:22] elaser make Becca come out and say hey
[1:44:24] have a drink and while you're drinking
[1:44:25] I'll Water your
[1:44:27] camels how did he make that
[1:44:32] happen he
[1:44:34] didn't
[1:44:36] amen but he mechanically lined up
[1:44:40] everything that would be a hindrance to
[1:44:42] that and got it out of the way he said
[1:44:45] to his
[1:44:47] master I'm going to do what you told me
[1:44:49] to do and nothing else and when he got
[1:44:52] there he he
[1:44:53] prayed and said
[1:44:56] Lord if El easier thought for a second
[1:44:59] that he could make this happen why is he
[1:45:01] asking the
[1:45:02] Lord and why is he asking the Lord so
[1:45:05] specifically like if he has enough faith
[1:45:08] in his own discernment to pick the right
[1:45:10] one and to fix the problem and get the
[1:45:12] solution why is he praying it's not only
[1:45:15] got to be this way but it's got to be
[1:45:17] this way and she's got to say this and
[1:45:19] she's got to water the camels you talk
[1:45:22] about fleece the
[1:45:25] Lord this is not a person who has faith
[1:45:28] in his own abilities to get it
[1:45:36] right First Kings 18:30 you don't have
[1:45:39] to turn there we're going to paraphrase
[1:45:40] this one as well and Elijah said unto
[1:45:43] all the people come near unto me and all
[1:45:45] the people came near unto him and he
[1:45:47] repaired the altar of the Lord that was
[1:45:49] broken
[1:45:51] down I'm going to interpret this to you
[1:45:54] again he got in his prayer
[1:45:58] closet and he prayed for God to reveal
[1:46:01] to him any of the word that was not in
[1:46:04] line in his
[1:46:06] life and then he first got himself in
[1:46:10] line with the word he repaired the
[1:46:14] altar he sought God and he repaired the
[1:46:18] altar that was broken down that's the a
[1:46:22] updated version to you that's the me and
[1:46:25] you version we don't need to go stack
[1:46:27] stones on top of each other we don't
[1:46:29] need to build an physical
[1:46:32] altar the altar is how we approach God
[1:46:35] the altar is our approach to God and we
[1:46:38] better make sure that we've got that
[1:46:39] right before we start screaming for the
[1:46:41] fire to fall because if that's not
[1:46:47] right we're not going to be in any
[1:46:49] better position than the other false
[1:46:51] prophets the people came near and he
[1:46:53] repaired the altar of the Lord that was
[1:46:55] broken down I'm going to skip down 36
[1:46:58] and it came to pass at the time of the
[1:47:00] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[1:47:02] Elijah the prophet came near and said
[1:47:04] Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel
[1:47:06] let it be known this day that thou art
[1:47:08] God in
[1:47:12] Israel not let it be known that I am a a
[1:47:16] true Prophet that's
[1:47:20] right and that I'm telling the truth and
[1:47:22] that I've got things right and I'm
[1:47:23] clearly more spiritual than
[1:47:27] these his prayer was Lord let you be
[1:47:32] manifested let you be revealed here
[1:47:37] today that thou art God in
[1:47:40] Israel and that I am thy servant and
[1:47:44] that thou H have done all these things
[1:47:47] at Thy
[1:47:51] word then the fire of the the Lord fell
[1:47:53] and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:47:55] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:47:56] licked up the water that was in the
[1:47:58] trench again my question is how did
[1:48:00] Elijah make that
[1:48:03] happen you know the
[1:48:07] answer let's come to a close with
[1:48:12] this let's turn to this one because this
[1:48:15] one
[1:48:16] is super
[1:48:20] crucial Job 1
[1:48:29] Job
[1:48:34] 1 and I pray that as we read
[1:48:40] this God will let you put yourself in
[1:48:44] this don't leave this thousands of years
[1:48:46] ago
[1:48:53] remember we're talking about the ability
[1:48:55] to have faith after a revelation we're
[1:48:58] talking about the
[1:49:00] ability to approach God the right way
[1:49:03] we're talking about the ability for the
[1:49:06] seventh seal Christ in Earth to be
[1:49:09] manifested we're talking about the
[1:49:11] ability for the fullness of the word to
[1:49:13] come on the scene this is the
[1:49:16] principle there was a man in the land
[1:49:19] whose name was job and the man was
[1:49:20] perfect and upright and one that feared
[1:49:22] God God and a Shu evil we're off to a
[1:49:25] really good start
[1:49:28] here I want that to be said about
[1:49:32] me we are off to a really good
[1:49:36] start verse 5 and it was so when the
[1:49:39] days of their feasting meaning of his
[1:49:41] children were gone about that job sent
[1:49:43] and Sanctified them and Rose up early in
[1:49:45] the morning and offered burnt offerings
[1:49:46] according to the number of them all for
[1:49:48] job said it may be that my sons have
[1:49:50] sinned and cursed God in their hearts
[1:49:52] thus did job continually we are
[1:49:55] continually on a hot streak he is
[1:49:58] perfect and upright he is giving the
[1:50:01] appropriate sacrifices he is even taking
[1:50:03] dominion and possession of his children
[1:50:06] and offering sacrifices for
[1:50:10] them between verse 5 and verse 20
[1:50:13] there's a lot of things that go bad go
[1:50:16] sideways that job didn't plan for job
[1:50:19] didn't sign up for job didn't want
[1:50:24] I'm not going to take the time to read
[1:50:25] those but you all know the story we get
[1:50:27] to verse 20 after all of these bad
[1:50:30] things have happened all of these bad
[1:50:33] things horrendous things terrible
[1:50:37] things then job arose and rent his manle
[1:50:40] mantle and shaved his head and fell down
[1:50:42] up the upon the ground and
[1:50:45] worshiped that is not a 2024 reaction
[1:50:57] not only did he
[1:50:59] worship but he said and I am naked when
[1:51:03] I came out of my mother's womb and naked
[1:51:05] shall I return the Lord give and the
[1:51:08] Lord hath taken away blessed be the name
[1:51:10] of the
[1:51:12] Lord in all of this job sinned not nor
[1:51:16] charged God foolishly Lord I say be it
[1:51:21] unto me according to your word
[1:51:30] chapter 5 verse one we know there is a
[1:51:34] lot of things that happen but we're just
[1:51:36] going to skip some of that for time sake
[1:51:40] we come to chapter 5 verse one
[1:51:43] now moreover the Lord answered job and
[1:51:47] said how did job get the Lord to talk to
[1:51:50] him
[1:51:55] how did job get the Lord to talk to
[1:51:59] him what did he do to pull that down
[1:52:03] what did he do to make that happen this
[1:52:05] is the answer to his his question
[1:52:07] remember this is what he wanted all
[1:52:09] along was if if I knew where God lived
[1:52:12] if I knew where his house was I'd just
[1:52:13] go there and I talk to like this this is
[1:52:15] what he wanted and it's finally
[1:52:17] happening how did he make this happen
[1:52:24] moreover the Lord answered job and said
[1:52:26] shall he that contendeth with the
[1:52:28] almighty instruct him he that reproveth
[1:52:31] God let him answer it then job answered
[1:52:34] the Lord and said behold I am
[1:52:36] vile what shall I answer Thee I will lay
[1:52:40] my hand upon my
[1:52:42] mouth also interpreted I will be
[1:52:46] silent once have I spoken but I will not
[1:52:50] answer yay twice
[1:52:53] I spoke but I will proceed no
[1:52:57] further job started out in this book
[1:53:00] perfect upright righteous before God
[1:53:03] giving the appropriate sacrifices
[1:53:05] sacrificing for his children somewhere
[1:53:08] between there these troubles came in and
[1:53:11] somehow in the midst of All the
[1:53:14] Troubles job backslid a little bit
[1:53:17] because even job being righteous being
[1:53:21] the bride I might say even job being in
[1:53:24] the message I might say even
[1:53:27] job sitting under the five-fold ministry
[1:53:29] positionally
[1:53:31] placed even job doing everything right
[1:53:36] when trouble set in job still had in his
[1:53:40] hybrid flesh the same thing that me and
[1:53:43] you have every day that we fight against
[1:53:46] when all we've done all of this right
[1:53:49] mechanically we've lined it up we've got
[1:53:51] it all right
[1:53:54] and I don't belittle that that's
[1:53:55] important we need to know who we are we
[1:53:58] need to be positionally placed we need
[1:54:00] to be doing things
[1:54:05] right but in all of that when things
[1:54:08] went
[1:54:10] sideways suddenly something comes out of
[1:54:13] job that we haven't seen
[1:54:17] before job thinks he's got something to
[1:54:20] say
[1:54:27] job thinks he's got something to say not
[1:54:29] only once but he says twice twice I
[1:54:32] opened my mouth I had something to
[1:54:36] say but job now
[1:54:40] comes to the
[1:54:43] Revelation that is not the appropriate
[1:54:47] approach to God you know what revealed
[1:54:49] this to job God coming on the scene
[1:54:53] it's a funny thing when God comes on the
[1:54:54] scene you realize you need to be
[1:55:00] quiet brother Ram says everybody tells
[1:55:02] me when the angel shows up will you will
[1:55:04] you ask him this will
[1:55:06] you he said listen right you don't
[1:55:13] understand I'm so terrified I'm not
[1:55:16] about to say anything about
[1:55:20] anything job starts out out righteous
[1:55:23] job starts out pure and he was I'm not
[1:55:25] belittling that I'm not disputing that
[1:55:27] job is on the right track but when
[1:55:29] things go
[1:55:30] sideways really sideways like it took a
[1:55:34] lot to draw this out but it finally it
[1:55:37] finally comes to the surface things
[1:55:40] finally get so rough and so tough and so
[1:55:43] hard and so
[1:55:46] confusing that
[1:55:48] job just can't hold his peace anymore
[1:55:52] he's got to say
[1:55:55] something you know what Joe basically
[1:55:57] says is this isn't
[1:55:59] fair
[1:56:01] exactly in a nutshell that's basically
[1:56:03] what he
[1:56:05] says job lies
[1:56:09] right in the
[1:56:12] message the
[1:56:14] bride under the right word for his age
[1:56:18] things get so hard tough Pinchy squeezy
[1:56:21] I might
[1:56:24] say that Satan finally gets job to lie
[1:56:28] and say I don't deserve this God should
[1:56:31] come and fix this
[1:56:33] immediately this isn't
[1:56:41] fair you know what
[1:56:43] happens six seal comes on the scene and
[1:56:47] God renders judgment who are you that's
[1:56:52] right to be reproving
[1:56:54] [Music]
[1:56:56] me you know what happened next the fifth
[1:56:59] seal grace extended to job and he
[1:57:03] realized I have opened my mouth when I
[1:57:06] should not have opened my mouth and I
[1:57:08] will therefore now shut my mouth
[1:57:11] forever that's good you know what
[1:57:14] happened next prise
[1:57:16] God the seventh seal amen Christ
[1:57:22] comes to job's situation
[1:57:26] personally verse six then answered the
[1:57:28] Lord out of then answered the Lord unto
[1:57:31] job out of the
[1:57:33] Whirlwind I'm not going to read the rest
[1:57:35] of it that's the
[1:57:37] point this is what job needed all along
[1:57:40] it's what he wanted all along but
[1:57:42] somehow he deviated away from the right
[1:57:45] the right
[1:57:46] approach it didn't work for
[1:57:49] job why do we think it's going to work
[1:57:51] for us
[1:57:53] as the musicians would
[1:57:55] come sat at their instruments for
[1:57:57] another half an hour while I keep
[1:58:01] preaching hey we're about being honest
[1:58:03] today right no I promise I'll try not to
[1:58:06] do that let's go to Revelation
[1:58:13] 5 Revelation
[1:58:16] 5 very very
[1:58:19] familiar beginning in verse one and I
[1:58:21] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[1:58:23] the throne a book written within and on
[1:58:24] the backside sealed with Seven Seals and
[1:58:26] I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[1:58:28] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[1:58:32] book and loose the seals thereof and no
[1:58:34] man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under
[1:58:36] the Earth was able to open the book
[1:58:38] neither to look there on and I wept much
[1:58:40] John wept much the bride wept much
[1:58:44] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:58:45] and to open and to read the book neither
[1:58:48] to look there
[1:58:50] on and and one of the elders saith unto
[1:58:53] me weep
[1:58:55] not behold the line of the tribe of
[1:58:59] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[1:59:01] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[1:59:04] Seals
[1:59:05] thereof how did John make that
[1:59:09] happen how did John find this man who
[1:59:13] was
[1:59:16] worthy the answer is he
[1:59:19] didn't but he approached m meally the
[1:59:22] right way because when it says in verse
[1:59:26] 4 and I wept much because no man was
[1:59:30] found worthy to open and read the book
[1:59:31] and to look there there on that is John
[1:59:36] saying it is what it is right I'm not
[1:59:40] worthy either
[1:59:43] right I can't fix this that's right I
[1:59:46] acknowledge the
[1:59:48] fact everything is lost unless somebody
[1:59:52] else comes on the
[1:59:55] scene I acknowledge the fact that as the
[2:00:00] bride under the message of the
[2:00:04] hour under the proper
[2:00:09] angel I am still not
[2:00:12] worthy and I still have no
[2:00:15] ability to fulfill the Plan of
[2:00:18] Redemption it's because of that that
[2:00:22] verse five can come into
[2:00:24] existence and one of the elders sath
[2:00:26] unto me weep not he never said oh you're
[2:00:30] wrong you really do stand a slight
[2:00:33] chance like it's a 1% chance
[2:00:35] but no he never tried to correct John
[2:00:38] and make him feel better as far as
[2:00:41] you're worthy there's another option he
[2:00:44] simply says weep
[2:00:47] not weep not
[2:00:50] behold he's going going to come to Earth
[2:00:53] again he's going to manifest himself
[2:00:56] again the line of the tribe of Judah the
[2:00:59] root of David hath prevailed to open the
[2:01:01] book to loose since it's not a book
[2:01:03] papers it's me and you amen it's me and
[2:01:07] you we cannot reveal this mystery
[2:01:10] ourselves he has got to come the lon of
[2:01:13] the tribe of Judah step into this yes
[2:01:17] forsake all of our abilities amen and
[2:01:20] loose the seals in our life
[2:01:22] amen don't
[2:01:24] weep acknowledge the facts we don't
[2:01:27] stand a chance without him that's true
[2:01:29] that's accurate acknowledge that
[2:01:31] approach him
[2:01:36] humbly but he's going to be the one to
[2:01:39] have to do this
[2:01:41] work there is nothing we can
[2:01:44] do even with a revelation of who we are
[2:01:49] and our position and all the mechanics
[2:01:52] lined up there is still nothing we could
[2:01:55] have done or can
[2:01:58] do to fulfill and bring a close to this
[2:02:02] Plan of
[2:02:05] Redemption whoever is in here that has
[2:02:08] the ability to change your atoms come
[2:02:13] on come on right
[2:02:24] we've better come to terms with we have
[2:02:26] no
[2:02:28] ability to change our atams am because
[2:02:32] things are going to get
[2:02:34] tighter things are going to get
[2:02:36] rougher things are going to get squeezi
[2:02:39] and our desire to change our atoms is
[2:02:44] going to be more prevalent and more
[2:02:48] prevalent and more pre prevalent
[2:02:54] you said I don't think things are so bad
[2:02:56] like I just went on vacation last week
[2:02:57] we
[2:02:58] had just
[2:03:01] wait just
[2:03:07] wait this is just me you take it for
[2:03:09] what it's
[2:03:11] worth God gave us this
[2:03:14] message to let us know the truth so that
[2:03:17] we could be restored but he gave us this
[2:03:19] message so that we could finish The Plan
[2:03:22] of
[2:03:23] Redemption in order to finish the Plan
[2:03:25] of Redemption we have to write what was
[2:03:28] first wrong and the first
[2:03:33] wrong was a bride who couldn't wait and
[2:03:37] took her own idea
[2:03:40] amen
[2:03:44] right her desire was not
[2:03:50] wrong your desire for your atoms to
[2:03:52] change is not
[2:03:56] wrong but you better not get
[2:04:00] impatient and try to make it happen
[2:04:04] yourself
[2:04:06] right because you're going to find
[2:04:08] yourself violating the scripture and the
[2:04:10] pattern of
[2:04:13] God when this squeeze
[2:04:18] comes that is not the time
[2:04:23] to lose our cool to come up with a
[2:04:25] better idea to have a plan B right that
[2:04:30] is the time to
[2:04:32] say this is not
[2:04:35] fun I don't like
[2:04:38] this but it's not unfair I deser I
[2:04:41] deserve everything I got
[2:04:44] coming that is the time to rest
[2:04:52] what else are we going to do Saints
[2:04:57] listen we do not have this squeeze
[2:05:00] figured
[2:05:01] out I promise you I don't know how it's
[2:05:05] going to happen but here's one promise I
[2:05:07] will make you there are going to be
[2:05:09] events happen that you did not foresee
[2:05:14] happening I promise you before this is
[2:05:18] done and over we are going to be left on
[2:05:21] the ash Heap scratching our heads not
[2:05:25] having a clue how to fix
[2:05:28] things because that is the test we have
[2:05:31] to
[2:05:32] win that is the test that Eve failed
[2:05:36] it's the test we have to win in order to
[2:05:40] write what was
[2:05:42] wrong and I don't know what form that's
[2:05:44] going to manifest itself in and I don't
[2:05:46] know what agencies will be behind that
[2:05:48] and I don't know what people will be
[2:05:50] behind that right but that is what God
[2:05:53] is training us in our personal lives now
[2:05:57] for when these problems come up in our
[2:06:00] personal lives that we don't have the
[2:06:02] answer for it's not just about that
[2:06:04] situation it's about the end of
[2:06:09] redemption he's in his grace training Us
[2:06:13] in carnal things now and in natural
[2:06:16] things now and in some spiritual things
[2:06:18] now so that we won't mess up when we get
[2:06:20] to the real test
[2:06:25] yeah this is not just about oh you know
[2:06:29] I passed the test and I received my
[2:06:31] healing because I didn't try to get into
[2:06:33] the way that's fine but you're going to
[2:06:35] get sick again you're going to have
[2:06:37] something else happened that you need
[2:06:38] healed that's not the ultimate as
[2:06:40] brother R says we don't major on a minor
[2:06:43] that's the
[2:06:44] minor though we don't want to belittle
[2:06:48] that we don't want to uh trivialize that
[2:06:51] but that's not the point the point is to
[2:06:53] learn the principle that I'm not going
[2:06:54] to take my own
[2:06:56] way
[2:06:59] amen and when I don't like what one
[2:07:01] doctor says I'm going to go to another
[2:07:03] hoping he gives me a better report or
[2:07:05] I'm going to try this this remedy
[2:07:07] instead no no no let's
[2:07:10] say
[2:07:12] Lord I don't have the answer to this I
[2:07:16] don't care whether it's a toothache or
[2:07:18] whether it's cancer that's not the point
[2:07:21] we overcome in the same way we overcome
[2:07:23] by saying I don't have the answer to
[2:07:25] this how do you want to fix this praise
[2:07:30] God and he may anoint you to do
[2:07:32] something yourself or he may anoint you
[2:07:34] to go to somebody else or to go to a
[2:07:37] doctor or to get Deliverance for
[2:07:39] something or to take your car to the
[2:07:41] mechanic he may anoint you and reveal to
[2:07:44] you to do whatever he wants to
[2:07:47] do that's
[2:07:49] fine but let's have our own
[2:07:52] agenda that I want it fixed this way I
[2:07:56] want to do it this way and not only that
[2:07:57] but I want it done
[2:08:05] yesterday this
[2:08:08] principle is what the finishing of
[2:08:11] redemption hinges
[2:08:17] on the reason
[2:08:21] that John could be told don't weep the
[2:08:25] line of the tribe of Judah has come on
[2:08:27] the scene is because of Revelation
[2:08:30] 81 there was silence in heaven you know
[2:08:33] what that silence was I don't know what
[2:08:35] all of it was but I know what some of it
[2:08:37] was and that was John keeping his mouth
[2:08:40] shut that was
[2:08:43] John acknowledging the fact I am who I
[2:08:47] am he's called me to be who he's called
[2:08:49] me to be
[2:08:52] but I don't have the answer to this John
[2:08:55] was a part of this
[2:08:59] silence I hope you're connecting the
[2:09:01] pieces
[2:09:02] Saints we can get W so wound up about
[2:09:05] ourselves having the truth and being the
[2:09:07] Brine and being in the message and
[2:09:08] knowing this and knowing that
[2:09:13] no let's be careful that we don't know
[2:09:17] everything let's be careful that we
[2:09:20] don't become the line of the tribe of
[2:09:22] Judah that's right right thank god let's
[2:09:26] be
[2:09:28] careful
[2:09:31] amen couple more statements and then
[2:09:33] we're going to close
[2:09:36] now I want to make this statement
[2:09:39] because I don't want to be accused of
[2:09:41] being a soft preacher and telling you
[2:09:43] that there's nothing you can do and you
[2:09:44] don't have to do anything listen all
[2:09:46] these examples and all of these stories
[2:09:48] are not excuses to be
[2:09:50] lazy this is not I can't do anything
[2:09:53] anyhow God's got to do it I'm going to
[2:09:54] sit here and wait for him to do
[2:09:56] it sir no listen if you want something
[2:09:58] out of church come
[2:10:01] early get in the right atmosphere sing
[2:10:04] the songs of Zion and then expect
[2:10:07] something out of the service expect God
[2:10:10] to come back in Earth again and speak to
[2:10:12] you don't do this expect God to come and
[2:10:15] speak to you out of an earth and vessel
[2:10:18] when you've bypassed all the mechanics
[2:10:19] that we've been taught yeah you didn't
[2:10:21] come early you didn't pray you didn't
[2:10:24] pull you couldn't open your mouth to
[2:10:26] sing the songs of Zion because you were
[2:10:27] in a bad mood you couldn't Raise Your
[2:10:29] Hands In Worship you see what I'm saying
[2:10:33] amen that's right amen but yet there's
[2:10:37] nothing I can what can you do to make
[2:10:39] that Minister speak directly to you
[2:10:43] right not a
[2:10:47] thing not a thing
[2:10:52] but violate the
[2:10:54] mechanics and I guarantee you he won't
[2:10:57] speak to
[2:10:59] you the only chance we have is to do all
[2:11:03] that we know to do and then wait that's
[2:11:07] right amen that's the principle I have
[2:11:09] no idea why it's taken me an hour and 46
[2:11:11] minutes to say
[2:11:14] it it works in the micro it works in the
[2:11:18] macro and I may have those backwards but
[2:11:20] it works works in the little picture it
[2:11:22] works in the big picture it works in
[2:11:24] church it works at work it works at
[2:11:27] Family it works if we will approach him
[2:11:31] correctly questions and answers he says
[2:11:33] now don't interpret anything if God
[2:11:36] wants you to know anything he'll send it
[2:11:37] to you so you just be a real real solid
[2:11:40] now hold still something has happened
[2:11:44] you understand what I mean don't you
[2:11:46] don't try to make yourself odd to be a
[2:11:49] Christian
[2:11:51] if you'll allow me I'll interject my
[2:11:54] understanding of that don't try to make
[2:11:56] yourself overly spiritual to be a
[2:11:58] Christian right don't try to make
[2:12:00] yourself spiritual looking to be a
[2:12:03] Christian odd he says don't try to do
[2:12:07] that because you take yourself away from
[2:12:09] God well well that make sense when I try
[2:12:13] to be more spiritual than I am I'm
[2:12:15] probably moving away from God Amen
[2:12:18] because I'm taking a substitute that's
[2:12:20] right yeah
[2:12:22] right if you can understand it this is
[2:12:26] that third
[2:12:31] poll I thought the third pole was the
[2:12:33] opening of the word and the spoken word
[2:12:36] being on the tongue of man again and all
[2:12:38] that Adam lost
[2:12:40] was don't try to make yourself odd to be
[2:12:44] a Christian because you take yourself
[2:12:47] away from God if you understand it this
[2:12:51] is that third
[2:12:54] pole what is he saying Saints the
[2:12:57] principle of the third poll the
[2:12:59] principle of the third poll is first a
[2:13:02] man getting himself out of the way not
[2:13:05] making something of himself admitting I
[2:13:08] don't have the answer to this I don't
[2:13:11] have the complete opening of the word in
[2:13:13] myself only the lamb can do
[2:13:15] that it's the same principle that
[2:13:18] allowed the preaching that will allow
[2:13:21] the manifestation in our
[2:13:24] lives by not trying to be something
[2:13:28] we're
[2:13:29] not by not trying to act like we got
[2:13:34] things figured out when we
[2:13:36] don't by not trying to be the spiritual
[2:13:40] person in the
[2:13:41] room I will assure you the quickest way
[2:13:45] to get away from the truth is to be the
[2:13:48] most spiritual person in the room
[2:13:53] he is the most spiritual person in the
[2:14:06] room if you'll just play something
[2:14:10] softly Jezebel religion brother brandom
[2:14:12] is recounting the vision of when he went
[2:14:14] beyond the curon of time he says but in
[2:14:17] that Vision here not long ago and here
[2:14:19] was those people standing around like
[2:14:21] that when they said and I said will Paul
[2:14:24] have to be judged for the gospel he
[2:14:26] preached they said yes I said I've
[2:14:29] preached every word just exactly the way
[2:14:31] he did and the millions screamed out
[2:14:35] we're resting on
[2:14:40] that I think I may have said this here
[2:14:43] before forgive me if I have but I'll
[2:14:44] just feel to say it
[2:14:49] again the sixth the di
[2:14:52] menion everybody in the sixth
[2:14:55] Dimension doesn't have a problem with
[2:14:58] what the prophet
[2:15:02] said nobody over there has a problem
[2:15:05] with what he said and the things that he
[2:15:07] got
[2:15:08] wrong and the visions that didn't happen
[2:15:13] God and the facts that don't line
[2:15:17] up nobody in the sixth dimension
[2:15:22] has that
[2:15:24] problem how do we think that we're going
[2:15:26] to have those problems here and go to
[2:15:30] that
[2:15:31] Dimension remember brother R says you
[2:15:33] don't change when you shift Dimensions
[2:15:35] what you are here you are
[2:15:36] there so if I'm want how many wants to
[2:15:39] go to the sixth
[2:15:44] Dimension maybe we should have the
[2:15:45] appropriate
[2:15:47] approach what God has said he is what
[2:15:51] God has thought he is revealed through
[2:15:52] that vessel and that vessel has spoken
[2:15:54] it and if I will get myself out of the
[2:15:57] way God can then he doesn't have to
[2:16:00] there is nothing that says God has to
[2:16:02] reveal this to me but if I can get
[2:16:05] myself out of the way and die completely
[2:16:08] to my own ideas and my own desires and
[2:16:10] my own
[2:16:12] timeline I now open myself to the
[2:16:17] possibility that he'll move on the scene
[2:16:19] for me and he will reveal himself to
[2:16:22] me I can assure that he won't do that if
[2:16:26] I violate his mechanics and I take my
[2:16:29] own thoughts my own ways my own ideas
[2:16:32] and my own timeline that's a big one the
[2:16:35] timeline's a big one so a lot of times
[2:16:37] easy to lay down your own ideas and your
[2:16:38] own ways and your own
[2:16:40] agenda but Leota is
[2:16:45] so possessed
[2:16:51] of here and
[2:16:53] now that's what we fight against
[2:16:56] saints what's the hardest thing to
[2:16:59] do take time to read your Bible and
[2:17:03] pray is it not is that not the hardest
[2:17:06] thing that you fight is taking the time
[2:17:09] why is time such a
[2:17:17] hindrance in the new heavens and the new
[2:17:19] Earth
[2:17:21] you're not go we're not going to have
[2:17:24] the opportunity to make time for
[2:17:27] Christ there is no
[2:17:30] time you can't make time for him there
[2:17:34] this
[2:17:36] Dimension is the only opportunity that
[2:17:39] we have to make
[2:17:42] time for
[2:17:43] Christ that's why it's the hardest thing
[2:17:45] to do because time is running out time
[2:17:49] is being pressed
[2:17:53] we have to fight against that the
[2:17:55] millions screamed out we are resting on
[2:17:57] that I just want to make that simple
[2:17:58] statement Dimensions should not change
[2:18:01] our
[2:18:04] confession I want to confess in this
[2:18:06] Dimension I'm resting on that I don't
[2:18:09] have it all figured out but I know where
[2:18:11] the answers are at and I'm resting on
[2:18:14] that and I'm just going to stand back
[2:18:15] and be real real solid yes yeah and
[2:18:19] admit that I don't know everything but
[2:18:22] if he has something for me he'll reveal
[2:18:26] it to
[2:18:27] me because I think I'm in a lot better
[2:18:30] position than that last quote and I'm
[2:18:33] closing closing as we would
[2:18:35] stand I just want to crystallize this in
[2:18:39] our minds of where we're at spoken word
[2:18:42] is the Original Seed brother brandom
[2:18:43] says that's what's the matter with the
[2:18:45] Pentecostals
[2:18:48] today now I understand Pentecostals was
[2:18:50] an or organization but we understand
[2:18:52] Pentecostal is a
[2:18:54] spirit let's view this in light of that
[2:18:59] because shocking I know but there's
[2:19:02] Pentecostal ideas in the
[2:19:04] message Pentecostalism is a spirit but
[2:19:07] brother Brandon's going to reveal to us
[2:19:09] one of the characteristics of that
[2:19:12] that's what's the matter with
[2:19:13] Pentecostals today they're manufacturing
[2:19:16] something right they can't wait
[2:19:22] they just can't wait so they commit
[2:19:25] adultery
[2:19:27] tears now we starts defining them tears
[2:19:31] not
[2:19:32] wheat this is not a wheat characteristic
[2:19:35] that'll manufacture something this is a
[2:19:37] tear characteristic and in case you
[2:19:40] don't know your Bible the tears don't
[2:19:41] end up in a good place you don't want to
[2:19:43] be a tear you don't want to have this
[2:19:47] characteristic tears to manufacture
[2:19:50] something and what does it bring forth
[2:19:53] like it did the first time the first
[2:19:56] bride that couldn't
[2:20:02] wait you don't have to raise your hand
[2:20:05] but how many believes we've been called
[2:20:08] into a bright age that we have been
[2:20:11] called into a free age that we have been
[2:20:14] called into an abrahamic AG
[2:20:22] let's not believe that mentally and
[2:20:25] having our character and our life
[2:20:29] manufacturing things like Pentecost
[2:20:31] would still
[2:20:32] do if we say that we're in a bright age
[2:20:35] you know what that means it means I've
[2:20:36] moved into an age that I realize I can
[2:20:38] do nothing and he has to come on the
[2:20:40] scene to do it the difference between
[2:20:42] the Pentecostal age and the bride age is
[2:20:45] only the lamb can come and take the book
[2:20:48] in the Pentecostal age the preacher
[2:20:50] could come and take take the
[2:20:51] book and he can manufacture something
[2:20:55] and you know what's amazing about it is
[2:20:57] it'll get
[2:20:58] results some results but it won't
[2:21:01] accomplish the end goal it will
[2:21:04] eventually run out and they find
[2:21:06] themselves manufacturing something that
[2:21:08] Spirit tries to bleed over into the
[2:21:11] message that manufacturing something
[2:21:15] that is not the bride age amen that is
[2:21:18] not the bride the first bride he says
[2:21:21] couldn't wait what do we think the
[2:21:23] second bride's going to do in order to
[2:21:26] write the wrong we've got to wait what
[2:21:29] does wait mean wait means it's referring
[2:21:32] to a time
[2:21:33] element that's the hardest thing Saints
[2:21:36] that's the hardest thing is the time
[2:21:38] element
[2:21:40] right because we so desperately one out
[2:21:43] of here right and we so desperately want
[2:21:45] the answers to the questions we're
[2:21:46] facing right now that's right but what
[2:21:49] if it's not God's time give you the
[2:21:51] answer to that question right
[2:21:52] now there can come the test what are you
[2:21:56] going to
[2:21:59] do I think we have to come to terms with
[2:22:01] the fact that we can no more fix our
[2:22:03] carnal problems and our spiritual
[2:22:07] problems then we can make our atoms
[2:22:10] change that's going to be the final test
[2:22:13] and that's why brother Rand says she'll
[2:22:14] have thus sayith the Lord or she'll keep
[2:22:16] still
[2:22:22] I'm going to close
[2:22:24] there Psalms
[2:22:26] 46:10 such a small
[2:22:30] scripture such a profound
[2:22:33] effect how many wants to know that he is
[2:22:39] God you've been there before I'm
[2:22:43] sure he's come on the scene and taken
[2:22:45] your breath away he's fixed things you
[2:22:48] know you couldn't fix he's done what you
[2:22:51] know you could not do how many wants
[2:22:53] more of that in their life how many
[2:22:55] wants to know he is God not only is he
[2:22:59] God he's still a living
[2:23:02] God I believe that's our heart's
[2:23:07] desire if you want to know that he's God
[2:23:11] in your situation here and now
[2:23:14] today the answer is to be
[2:23:16] quiet to be still
[2:23:20] allow there to be silence in
[2:23:24] heaven
[2:23:26] amen it's hard to do it's easy to say
[2:23:29] it's hard to
[2:23:32] do but you can
[2:23:34] see how that relates back to the change
[2:23:38] of the ministry how that allowed the
[2:23:42] third pole to come into existence how
[2:23:44] that allowed the spoken word to be
[2:23:46] placed on somebody's
[2:23:48] tongue in the natural to create things
[2:23:50] and then in the spiritual to speak the
[2:23:52] spoken word over me and you to loose the
[2:23:54] seals so that we could come a new
[2:23:57] creation it all hinges on that
[2:24:02] principle and that
[2:24:05] principle was
[2:24:07] established out in the middle of the
[2:24:09] Woods by a man squirrel hunting who just
[2:24:12] had the
[2:24:13] humility to say to God and acknowledge
[2:24:15] to
[2:24:17] God I can't preach on that I don't know
[2:24:21] I don't even know anything about
[2:24:24] it it's because he humbled himself and
[2:24:27] he came to that point that anything else
[2:24:30] could happen let's bow our heads
[2:24:32] together precious Lord
[2:24:36] Jesus
[2:24:38] father we just thank you for truth
[2:24:42] Lord a simple thought a simple principle
[2:24:45] I've been lengthy with it Lord but you
[2:24:48] see how it's a birth on My Heart
[2:24:53] Lord father and I I don't preach this
[2:24:57] out
[2:24:58] of criticalness Lord or blaming anybody
[2:25:02] else father I can preach this because
[2:25:05] you have been so gracious in my
[2:25:09] life to move on the scene and open my
[2:25:12] eyes to do something that I knew I could
[2:25:15] not do and Lord to give me a proper
[2:25:18] standard in my life to compare things to
[2:25:20] and now Lord that the proper standard
[2:25:24] has been given by your grace I can look
[2:25:26] back and
[2:25:29] see how many times I tried to do
[2:25:32] something and how it failed and how it
[2:25:33] was wrong and didn't work
[2:25:35] Lord father and it's our it's my prayer
[2:25:39] and I know it's these people's prayer
[2:25:40] moving
[2:25:42] forward father may we not inject ourself
[2:25:46] into
[2:25:48] this your Prophet said we standing on
[2:25:51] the threshold of the Millennium time is
[2:25:53] coming to an
[2:25:55] end father you have been giving us test
[2:25:58] after test after test in the natural and
[2:26:01] in some spiritual
[2:26:03] matters so that we would learn not to
[2:26:06] take our own ways and that we would
[2:26:07] learn not to inject ourselves into
[2:26:10] something and that we would learn to
[2:26:13] Humble ourselves and not make oursel odd
[2:26:16] and not make oursel spiritual
[2:26:20] so that you could come on the scene Lord
[2:26:23] we thank you that you didn't just
[2:26:26] immediately throw us into the final test
[2:26:29] Lord for
[2:26:31] surely we would have failed but Lord you
[2:26:35] have mechanically in your grace taught
[2:26:38] us and brought us through these
[2:26:40] things so that we would be on a firm
[2:26:44] foundation and we would know how to
[2:26:45] overcome in this hour that is
[2:26:49] coming I've prayed Lord that we would
[2:26:51] stay humble before you that we would
[2:26:53] stay sensitive before you and that we
[2:26:57] would be bold when you reveal yourself
[2:27:02] to us and how you want to do something
[2:27:04] but may we be ever so Meek beforehand
[2:27:09] Lord we just commit ourselves to you
[2:27:12] with the prayer that you would Manifest
[2:27:15] this principle in our life in every
[2:27:18] aspect as we yield our our elv to you in
[2:27:21] Jesus Christ's name we pray the bride

[2:34:01] how many want to mount up as Eagles
[2:34:04] Mount up with wings as are we called is
[2:34:05] this an eagle age are we called to
[2:34:08] fly then we're going to have to wait for
[2:34:11] him to renew our
[2:34:13] strength amen I I think it's so amazing
[2:34:16] when when we realize it's not we who's
[2:34:20] flying it's him who's flying in
[2:34:23] us and if we can wait we shall run and
[2:34:28] not be weary we shall walk and not faint
[2:34:33] you know why because it won't be us
[2:34:34] doing it'll be him in us doing it how
[2:34:38] many have gotten really tired trying to
[2:34:40] move obstacles out of your life and
[2:34:41] solve problems got really weary and worn
[2:34:44] out and tired and exhausted and
[2:34:46] discouraged and felt like quitting
[2:34:49] amen that's what happens when we try to
[2:34:51] do things when we try to fix things when
[2:34:54] we try to solve
[2:34:55] problems but how many have been there
[2:34:57] when God comes on the scene and
[2:34:58] supernaturally answers the question and
[2:35:01] it's like flying friends it's like it
[2:35:03] just comes and it just happens and
[2:35:05] everything falls into place and it's as
[2:35:07] simple as setting your wings and flying
[2:35:10] and then you run and are not weary and
[2:35:12] then you walk and you don't
[2:35:15] faint why because it's not you doing it
[2:35:18] it's not me doing it it's God doing it
[2:35:20] through us I think we're learning that's
[2:35:23] the only thing that's going to work is
[2:35:25] when he does it where is he going to do
[2:35:28] it through you are you going to do it
[2:35:30] yes are you going to do it
[2:35:32] no it's going to be him through me it's
[2:35:34] not going to be separate and independent
[2:35:36] of me but it's not going to be me
[2:35:37] independent of him amen I'm completely
[2:35:41] dependent on him man I thank God and I
[2:35:45] just like to sing that verse again amen
[2:35:48] and then we're just going to continue to
[2:35:49] to worship but make it more than a song
[2:35:53] let's let's make this a living reality

[2:35:58] we need most is patience when patience
