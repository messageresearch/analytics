========================================

today i want to look at the subject of the book of life and i'll probably do this in a couple parts looking at the book of life but the first part i want to look at is the sovereignty of god and the sovereignty of god especially in relation to the book of life so if we could all turn to the book of romans together we'll go to romans chapter 11. all right romans chapter 11 and we're going to read from verse 33. i went too far i went to corinthians romans 11 and 33 oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counselor or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever which of us can advise god who can give god counsel who here can instruct him on a decision that needs to be made which of us have the mind that can do that who has given something to god and god's going to have to give it back to us because he owes us a debt see it's all of god and it's all in god and it's all for god amen that's the sovereignty of god amen let's just ask the lord's blessing of the reading of the word dear heavenly father we ask that you would bless this word lord god as we read it i pray that we could absorb it into our souls lord and we be changed that you would change us from what we are to what you desire for us to be lord you have an image of us in your mind lord when we come to full maturity lord we're pressing towards that we just pray that by the spirit you would take this word and shape and mold your church this morning we ask for your blessings in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated so we're going to look at the book of life but we want to understand that this book of life was written by the almighty god right it was written by him who needs no counsel who needs no advice who needs no structure who needs no help in anything the book of life was written by this being right and so he is the only one authorized to author a book like this the book of life but he and his sovereign will and by his own desire and by his own pleasure has created a book of life we've got to get that in our mind straight let's go to the book of revelations and just look at a couple places in revelations concerning this book now i intend to take my time this morning it won't won't be long but i want to read a lot of verses together so keep your bibles with you revelations chapter 20 and we'll start reading in verse 11. and i saw a great white throne in him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire so here we have this book of life and this is the final judgment this is not the bride standing in this judgment but this is everyone else all that ever lived on the earth all the dead came up in what's called the white throne judgment and this book of life is open and now the book of life is open and if your name was in the book of life you go into eternal life and if your name was not found in the book of life you went into eternal damnation everybody clear on that that's what the scripture says so this book of life is pretty important i would say it's very important right because at the final judgment that's what the world is going to be judged by whose name is in or not found in this record of the book of life okay let's go back a few chapters to 17 revelations chapter 17. now the question would be if this name on the book of life is essential and not having that name in the book of life is cast into the lake of fire how do i get my name on this book of life wouldn't that be important right if if not being there is eternal damnation if not being there is lake of fire then i want to be on that book so how do i get my name on that book so let's look at revelation 17 and verse 8. and the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names are not written in the book of life so those who have not their name written in this book of life are going to wander after this beast or admire this beast all right and they're going to be deceived by this beast if their names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world the book of life is from the foundation of the world when were your names on the book of life from the foundation of the world that's the key that's the sovereignty of god that's why we want to look at the book of life we want to first establish the sovereignty of god because the names were put on that book from before the foundation of the world he was the lamb slain the book has been sealed the book was there from before the foundation of the world and the names were on the book from before the foundation of the world amen so how do you get your name on the book it had to be there before the foundation of the world he's not adding names to the book the book we find in revelations was a sealed book and it was sealed with seven seals and the seals had to be removed at the end time but it was the names were already on the book he's not adding names let's turn to romans chapter nine so we looked at the book but i want to establish god's authority and god's sovereignty still romans chapter nine see when we get into this subject you have to be very very careful that you don't allow your own human personality and your own human affection determine how god thinks because god doesn't think like we think you know we look at this subject and we start to play games like well fair and not fair and how can and you see god when god looks down god before there was ever an atom a molecule a gnat before there was ever dust before there was ever anything god had come up with a plan in his mind how he was going to be known by his children and god has laid out the plan and god is working the plan and god did it all and it consists of him and by him and for him and without him nothing exists so he is the one who knows all things he is the one who created all things for a purpose there you can you can say well what about my neighbor your neighbor wouldn't even existed if god had not thought of it from the foundation of the world and placed adams into the world building material and life and water and all the things that come to extend his life he's the one who has the right to decide because he's the one who created it all right so we we got to be very careful when we get into the sovereignty of god and we get into the book of life that we don't start to use our human thinking and our human emotion we must find our truth solidly placed in the scriptures because our own human emotion because we live we have to understand we live in a fallen body our emotions are not correct have your emotions 100 percent prove the truth to you or have they led you astray from time to time or maybe daily or so we can't use human emotion or human thinking determine how god will or how he won't or what god's going to do or why he'll do it or whether he's just or not in doing it you can't use your brain and your thinking to determine those things god is the only one with the right to determine what is just and unjust we have no right being down here looking up and saying that is just and that is not just that is fair and that's unfair right it's like when you have your children and you're going to do something you say okay you right here and you go there and we'll do this and we'll switch up like that's not fair and you look at your kids and say that's for me to decide they don't know all the facts they don't know all the details they don't know why you made that decision they don't know what's happening next they don't know what's in the plan in your mind in your mind the plan is perfectly fair after this one gets this privilege this time the next time it'll be the next one and i know there's a return trip and we'll do this i know in my mind what i'm going to do for my children and i know it's just and i know it's fair but the first time that i don't give my whole mind immediately i just give a part of my mind there some of my children will look at me and say that's not fair they do the same thing to god they look at just a portion of the mind of god a portion of the scripture a portion of what brother branham's saying and they're saying that's not fair but this prophet of god was unique in the fact that he was diving into the back parts of god's mind and he was back there taking the overview of redemption of the plan all through the bible and he was seeing from eagle vision flying high above the whole timeline of humanity and he was seeing it's perfectly fair it's absolutely just god has the right so we listen to what the prophet says and we start determining what's fair not fair and what's just and not just we have to be very very careful in how we make our determinations so in romans chapter 9 let's look at verse 6. romans 9 and 6 not as though the word of god hath taken on effect for they are not all israel which of our it which are of israel neither because they are seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called now this is this is a blockbuster statement that paul is making because you know when the pharisees face jesus say we're we're children of abraham because being children of abraham made them seed made them elect made them chosen of god made them the royal nation made them heir to all the promises but here he's saying not all of israel's israel jesus even said that he said if you were abraham's children you would do what abraham does you're not abraham's children you're of the natural lineage of abraham but you're not of the royal lineage you're not of the spiritual lineage of abraham because if you were the spiritual lineage of abraham you would receive me so he's saying not all of israel is israel but only the promised seed is of israel see they could look at that and say that's not fair but only god can decide verse 7 neither because they are seed of abraham are they children but in isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are of the children of the flesh they are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed what promise that promise that god spoke with his word that seed line that was going to come forth down through all generations that's the seed of promise brothers and sisters you and i are part of that promise amen amen verse 9 for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac okay stop right there abraham is going to have a promised seed a promised son and in the natural that promise was for a child to come from sarah and that child that came from sarah was isaac making him the fulfillment of the promise in the natural all right so after that so now we're seeing the godly lineage come forth right the promised seed the promise and the natural it's coming through isaac and that birthright is coming down through isaac correct but look what happens in the next generation verse 11 for the children being not yet born neither having done good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated that's not fair neither one being born yet neither one yet having a chance to do good or to do evil before they ever came forth won the womb god was declaring i love jacob and i hate esau you cannot use your human mind your human sympathy and your human emotion to understand god that's why the humanistic world that we live in that's leaning to the understanding intellect of man is a million miles away from god and cannot be trusted that's why brother branham said education is of the devil because education is centered on humanistic ideas and philosophies and thinking our world revolves around the man's mind and our world is not to revolve around man's mind the the entire creation is to revolve around god and his word that's why brother branham could say civilization is of the devil education is of the devil it's not wrong to learn to read and write it's not long to learn about the creation of god those things aren't wrong and we still must have that to abide in this world he wasn't against sending the kids to school but he was saying the foundation is wrong and it will lead you astray let's keep reading what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god see what he's saying no not all israel's israel but only a certain portion of abraham that promised seed is the real one just like when when there was a seed come to rebecca and there was an isaac and a jacob or a a jacob and um esau thank you there's a jacob and an esau and he's saying before they came forth from the womb this is not fair when you're using a humanistic mind you can't call this fair from a human perspective but if you will ever climb up a little higher with eagle vision and set your wings through the scriptures through the old testament in the new testament and set those wings and look down from god's perspective it's perfectly fair and perfectly just amen what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid how could he who is righteous who is the source of righteousness how could he be unrighteous and how could he do anything that's not righteous see if god's saying esau i hated jacob i've loved before they were ever born then that is a righteous statement and that is a just statement because it comes from the source of righteousness and it comes from the source of justice are we on the same page amen 15 for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runeth but of god that showeth mercy brothers and sisters it's not our efforts it's not how hard we try it's not all the hoops that we jump through it's not all the labors that we do it's not all the books of the bible that we read in a month it's not all the times we attend church that's not what gets us the grace he said i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion and i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy it's not based on the condition that you find yourself in all right god's compassion and god's mercy is not based on the condition that you find yourself in if that was the case every time you failed god you would be outside of mercy and compassion right if it was based on works it was based on deeds every time that you messed up big and i won't show a raise of hands or show a showing of hands how many times you've messed up big in the last month but you know i'd be holding up both hands then every time if it was dependent on my condition it was dependent on my works it was dependent on my deeds how well i fulfill the scripture i would constantly be outside of god's compassion and outside of god's mercy and i'd always be working to get back in but because before the foundation of the world before i was born before i come forth from the womb he could declare whether he loved me or hated me because he he will have compassion on whom he will have compassion and he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and if he has decided to have compassion and mercy on you then there's nothing that you can do to remove yourself from god's compassion and his mercy hallelujah so if you look at the human perspective and say that's unfair i like that kind of unfair that it doesn't matter what i do and if my neighbor who is not inside god's compassion and god's side and god's mercy can live a holier cleaner more just life than me but yet i can stay in god's compassion and mercy and this person has no access to god's compassion and mercy because their name was not on that book from before the foundation of the world they stand like esau who in his natural life happened to be the more righteous man especially before jacob's conversion before he wrestled with the angel esau was the better man in almost every area but esau was hated rejected and there was no compassion and no mercy for esau whereas jacob who was the promised seed who was the elect of god was a rascal we probably wouldn't have liked him but he was in position for god's compassion and for god's mercy amen i'm glad that we don't have to judge whether or not we're eligible for compassion or mercy or not i'm glad he's already chosen verse 16 so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runeth but of god that showeth mercy now it's not of him that willeth it's it doesn't matter how bad you want it to be a certain way it's not him that it's not your will it's not your desire it's not how real bad you really really really really want it to be differently it'll never be differently it'll always be according to god's will but of god that showeth mercy verse 17 for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might show my power to the my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth it was god's purpose to raise up pharaoh but pharaoh had no part in god god decided to raise up pharaoh and pharaoh was going to heed to moses request multiple times was he not go back and read it he was going his heart and his heart he was going to consent to moses but god came down and hardened pharaoh's heart so that he would not concede to moses's request so that god could justly bring the plagues upon egypt and you look back and say how's that fair ask god don't ask me it's not my plan it's not my bible it's not my interpretation of it ask god verse 18 therefore hath mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth he's either god or he's not he's nothing in between he's either 100 god or he is not god and i don't want to serve somebody who's not 100 god i don't want to serve a god that's not 100 in control i don't want to serve a god that's left things the chance left things the random i'm not serving that kind of god i'm serving a god who has called me and because he's called me my calling is is secure will never fail away my eternal destination is promised and cannot be stripped from me and nothing that can happen on this earth can ever remove me from that that's the kind of god that i want to serve hallelujah verse 19 thou wilt say then unto me why doth he yet find fault do you see the question this is the human carnal perspective talking to paul and paul's addressing the human carnal perspective that's why we have to let this mind that was in christ be in us we have to allow the spirit to wash us of our own thinking and allow the spirit to interpret the word into our hearts if not we come with a carnal interpretation of the word we start asking questions like paul's addressing then you say well is there unrighteousness god god forbid there's no one righteousness in god well then how can god find fault if he hardens and then he blames them for being hardened how can god find fault it sounds like a logical question in fact it's a very logical question that's the problem we're not supposed to use logic that's humanism that's humanistic thinking that's what we're being taught in schools reasoning deduction analysis you cannot find god that way and you cannot judge god or his word based off those criteria amen it's accepted by faith even if it doesn't make an ounce of sense to your carnal mind it's accepted by faith that will say unto me why why does he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will if it's all his will and he's doing it all how can he find fault how can he blame you nay i love this verse 20 nay but oh man who art thou who are you that replies against god who are you even to ask such a question god did it god said it you're questioning god neighborhood o man who or thou that replies against god shall the thing form say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus can you imagine you got two you got two lumps of clay we'll get in this a minute and you make one into a bowl and you make one into a pitcher right and the picture says why did you make me a bull and the bull says why didn't you make me a picture and you say shut up i did what i wanted to do what right do you have to tell me your creator how to make you or what to do with you see how foolish that question is see how silly and preposterous that is it's like it's like a man standing over the anthill and the ants and the ant hill having a discussion on what the man's thinking and what he's going to do and why he does what he does they have no idea the same thing like us looking up to god and saying well this is the why he won't do that and he wouldn't do that because of this we have no idea just take the scripture just whatever the bible says that's the mind of god that's the fallacy with the world today we've taken in and we've got 33 000 denominations because we can't just accept what he said we've got to try to twist it and move it into something that's more reasonable more logical or satisfies our humanistic idea of emotion and affection and love verse 21 hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel into honor and another unto dishonor what if god willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction listen vessels of wrath fitted to destruction he's using an analogy here of a potter making vessels and he takes one lump of clay and one vessel he makes under honor and one vessel he makes under dishonor he said that dishonorable vessel is fitted to destruction that means that vessel was created for destruction verse 23 and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had for prepared unto glory even us whom he hath called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles god has a purpose there's a purpose for the vessel fitted to destruction there's a purpose for the vessel of dishonor and there's a purpose for the vessel of honor and the purpose is so that he can have much long suffering on the vessel of dishonor fitted to destruction so that he might declare himself to the vessel of honor it's the law of contrast again amen i don't know about you but that excites me but it depends on which side of this equation you find yourself on if you're nervous about being esau this would scare me to death but if i believe in my heart that i fall into the promised seed line like isaac and jacob this thrills me beyond measure amen so you know to not love this doctrine puzzles me because this this doctrine tells me that i'm absolutely secure that i'm absolutely part of the the plan of god and can never be removed from that part this doctrine thrills me but if it would trouble me then maybe i'm not so sure about my eternal destination where i came from and where i'm going maybe i have some fear and inconsistencies in my heart and maybe that's why this doctrine troubles me amen let's turn to proverbs 16 14. proverbs 16 and verse 14. no not verse 14 verse 4 sorry proverbs 16 and verse 4 the lord hath made all things for himself stop don't worry anymore is that true do we believe that the lord has made all things for himself yea even the wicked for the day of evil is that the scriptures that's the scriptures not everyone has the same chance you and i have that's the scriptures there are vessels fitted to destruction brute beast made to be taken and destroyed is that the scriptures there are he has made all things for himself yea even the wicked for the day of evil has he done it he said he did it he did it amen acts 15 18 said known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world i want to read a section out of job together let's turn to job job is just before psalms and let's turn to jobs 38. or job 38 sorry job 38. i'm going to read from verse 1. this is a very long passage i'm not going to probably read all of it but i'm going to read a large portion so you can get the idea now here in the book of job we have job falling into his trials we have his friends coming to them and they're saying things about god and he's answering things about god they're having this discord or this discussion about the nature of god right you've probably sinned and god won't allow you to sin for secret sin god's going to punish you and job said no i've had a sacrifice i've not gotten a secret sin and all these things right and then on top of that job has a question about what shall happen unto man you know i can see the flower comes up again but man goes into the dust his children come and mourn his loss but where does he go is there any resurrection is basically the question and so there's all this debate and discussion going on about god and finally at the end of the book god comes down and answers and i love it when god speaks so all these experts on god come to job and begin to tell him about god and it's not that what they're saying is untrue they're not saying untrue things and job's answer it's not like job's answer is untrue but when god comes on the scene it changes everything let's just take a look at this in job 38 then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge who is this that's telling you what to do who is this that's giving answers and they don't know what they're talking about who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge gird up now thou loins like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thou me god's not he's not this isn't the still small voice this isn't sweet jesus whispering tenderly in your ear this is god correcting his son screwed up now thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thou me so he's going to ask him a huge list of questions and he wants job to give him an answer to these questions where was thou when i laid the foundation of the earth declareth thou hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof of thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it he's saying oh you're so smart guys answer these questions because if you can answer these questions then you have a right to decide what's going on in job's trial but if you can't answer these questions you have no right to pass any judgment you don't know hallelujah whereupon are the foundations there are fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy or who showed up to see with the doors when it break forth as if it issued out of the womb when i made the cloud the garment thereof and thick darkness a swaddling cloth a swallowing band for it and break up for it my decreed places and set bars upon the doors bars and doors and said hitherto shalt thou come but no further and there shall thou proud waves be stayed hast thou commanded the morning since thy days have you commanded the morning since your days and caused the dayspring to know his place that it might take hold of the ends of the earth that the wicked might be shaken out of it it has turned his clay to the seal and they stand as a garment and from the wicked their light is withholding and the high arms shall be broken has thou entered into the springs of the sea or hast thou walked into search of the depth have the gates of death been opened unto thee or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death can any of us answer yes to any of these questions has thou perceived the breath of the earth declared if thou knowest at all declarest it if you're a know-it-all if thou knowest at all tell me these things see god god is not going to answer to man and god is not subject to our opinion of what he's doing god is god and when there's a lot of people in the earth and the days of job had a lot of opinions he showed up and this is how he talked and don't think that we're going to have a bunch of opinions about god about what his word means and about this and about the prophet of the day and about all this and we all got opinions don't think that god's going to be any different than the way he answered job verse 19 where is the way where light dwelleth where does light dwell and as for darkness where is the place thereof that thou should just take it to the bound thereof and that thou should just know the past to the house thereof know us that way because thou was then born do you know because were you born there then or because the number of thy days is great were you around before the foundation of the world were you born back then were your days were they numbered great do you know what happened back then this is what he's telling job hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war by what way is the light parted which scattereth the east wind upon the earth who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters or a way for the lightning of the thunder to cause it to rain on the earth where no man is or the wilderness where there is no man to satisfy the desolate and waste ground and to cause the blood of the tender herb to bring to spring forth hath to reign a father or who hath forgotten the drops of dew out of whose womb come the ice and the hory frost of heaven who hath gendered it do you know the waters are hid is with a stone and the face of the deep is frozen can't thou bind the sweet influence of pleiades now he's going up to the stars he's talking about constellations can thou bind the sweet influence of pilates or loose the bands of orion can style bring forth mazeroth in his season or cast out guide arcturus with his sons noah's thou the ordinance of heaven cast thou set the dominion thereof in the earth cast thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that abundance of waters may cover thee can't thou send lightnings that they may go and say unto thee here we are who hath put wisdom in the inward parts or who hath given understanding to the heart who can number the clouds in wisdom or who can stay the bottles of heaven when the dust grow within the hardness and the clods cleave fast together will thou hunt the prey for the lion or fill the appetite of the young lions when they couch in their dens and abide in the cobra and the covert to lie in wait who provideth food for the raven who provideth for the raven his food when his young ones cry unto god they wander for lack of meat he's even talking about the care of the animals this is a god who knows all things this is a major paradigm shift for job and all his friends they went from an earthly discussion all the ants on the ant hills looking up towards god and god sucked them right up to his perspective and say what about this what about that tell me about this answer this question were you there are you of ancient of days did you see the foundation of the world who laid the cornerstone who gendered the horry frost what a paradigm shift and he goes on through all of chapter 39 we won't read all of it but it'd be good to go home and read it sometime chapter 40 moreover the lord answered job and said shall he that contendeth with the almighty and struck him are you given instruction to god he that reproveth god let him answer it so two chapters 38 39 he asked him a a myriad of questions about creation and about the existence and about the stars and about everything and then he says are you that contendeth with god and he that reproveth god let him answer because if you can answer all those questions then you have a right to reprove god or to contend with god but if you cannot answer those questions you have no right to give counsel to contend with to question or to reprove god here's job's answer verse 3 or chapter 40 verse 3 then job answered the lord and said behold i am vile what would you feel like if you had just had that discussion it wasn't really a discussion it was a lecture what would you feel like job said i am vile what shall i answer thee i will lay my hand upon my mouth once have i spoken but i will not answer yea twice but i will proceed no further i tried it but i could see that i was a miserable wretch i should not have ever spoken and then god takes off again on another lecture all through all through the rest of 40 all through 41. he starts talking about behemoth and leviathan of the deep he starts talking about things we have no idea what he's talking about he says you know about those because i do you know you know where leviathan hide you know can you bring him out of the deep you know about behemoth when he sucks up the waters of the of the jordan with his great mouth you know all about that amen let me get over to verse 42 at the end of another lecture lecture number two then job answered the lord and said i know that thou canst do everything and that no thought can be withholden from thee he got a glimpse at the majesty of almighty god and he was made dust verse 3 who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have i uttered that i underst what i understood not things too wonderful for me which i knew not here i beseech thee and i will speak i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine i see it thee wherefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes no man has any right to tell god what to do no man has any right to question god's authority to do what he will or to call it unfair or unjust or not right are we clear on that because we better get clear on that because we're not clear on that there's going to be one day maybe at the judgment bar that god will make it very clear and i'd rather clear this question up now than then god's in absolute total control and he's the boss and i'm but ash i'm not going to answer i will put my hand over my mouth in the presence of god amen let's go to colossians we're going to look at a couple more verses together colossians chapter 1. colossians chapter 1 and verse 15. who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him all things what does that mean all things we can interpret greek all things mean all things and all things were made by him and all things remain for him so christ he's talking about christ here christ was not made for you and i he is not our santa claus he is not our genie in a bottle he is not him who we go to when we need healing he is not the one that we go to when we want something we were made for him he was not made for us we serve his will he does not serve our will see we got to adjust our thinking somehow we can do whatever we want but crisis might get out of jail free card as long as i say oh yeah it's under the it's under the it's under the blood it's under the blood if he says it's unto the blood he's god none of us are god let's turn to revelations chapter 4. revelations chapter 4 we'll read verse 10 and 11. the four and 20 elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure thy pleasure not our pleasure all things were created by him and for him and for thy pleasure they are and were created even the wicked which he hath made for the day of evil even the vessel fitted to destruction even the brute beast made to be taken and destroyed even they were created for his pleasure brother branham said i love him so much even if he cast me into hell i'll be kissing his feet on the way into hell that's his great reverence and respect for god he wasn't serving god because he got a ticket to heaven he wasn't serving god for all the benefits he wasn't serving god for all the things he could get out of the deal he served god because he loved god so much so that if he was destined for hell he would still love god and still be kissing his feet as he was kicking his face into hell that's the proper approach to god not as the rich young ruler come up to jesus and say what can i do to get eternal life he wanted a deal we don't want a deal we love him we don't deserve a deal we just love him we love him because it's all for him and it's all by him and it's all for his good pleasure and we are his and we know we're his and so we don't reserve anything from him we give ourselves willingly to him because we understand he's lord of all amen let's go to isaiah 46. i just love looking at all the scriptures i thought this would be a great subject for a little bible study this morning isaiah chapter 46 and verse 9. remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me i think that's pretty much what he told job what do you think now he's talking to isaiah i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure what's going to happen outside of god's will tell me something that will happen outside of god's will nothing will ever happen outside of god's will there is none like him nobody else can declare from ancient days things that will be but from ancient days he declared things that will be i got a couple quotes here i'm going to read a couple sections out of the church age book and as we get into the book of life i'm going to read some sections out of the church age book and so i'm going to continue on next sunday lord willing and it'd be good if everybody would bring their church age book so if you have one and you want to bring it bring it and what i'll do is tell you the page number i'm reading out of so you can read along with me and so you can highlight mark or do whatever you want and now i've heard from a couple different people that they've called to question the authenticity of the church age book right because we know that brother lee vale was that was the brother that edited the book and he put the book together and he made all the corrections and he grammarized and he did all those things that's true right so there's some people that are afraid that lee vale had a lot of himself injected into this book and that it may not be exactly a hundred percent what brother branham wanted has anybody ever heard that okay i don't believe that because brother branham highly promoted this book told us you ought to get it it'll answer your questions it'll be good for you and all those other things and and why would god have a prophet bring confusion when god is not the author of confusion and why could god not watch over this book right could god not preserve this book could god not withhold it from coming forth it was going to be wrong see we know that they also they also wanted to produce the seven seals brother brandon very much wanted to do the same thing he did to this book he very much wanted to do it with the seven seals how many knows that was his desire take it and he wanted to have it edited in a way that made sense so scholarly people could read it so it wasn't broke up and there's many concepts brother branham teaches over dozens of messages but here he compiled all of that edited and was very concise in the way he brought doctrinal teachings and that's the way he wanted it that was his desire right and he wanted to do the same thing with the seven seals but afterwards they they were going to do the seven seals they wanted to do the seven seals but god didn't let it come to fruit because there was no profit to correct or edit the seven seals but there was a prophet on the scene that was correcting editing and proofreading this book i got a couple quotes that i'll read to you so so you don't think i'm making stuff up 1965 the anointed ones at the end time now lee there there comes your name on the book he's talking about the book of life see you've got it you got it fixed out and you that's not here out in the hookups it's dr lee vale sitting here he's grammarizing this book of the seven church ages and the problem come up with a question about your name taken off the lamb's book of life see it's a puzzled a lot of ministers but wait till you get the book you'll understand it if you just got any light in you see the brother brandon endorsed this book absolutely and you can take this and go back to the message and find it it's just when you find a topic in here you've got to scour years of messages and you'll find it all over but it's really nice to have it condensed and concise amen here's another one in 1965 a man running from the presence of the lord and then the seven church ages has been finished is that right brother veil and on print now and i know you'll want to get them because they answer a lot of questions that's been in your hearts did we read that right the seven churches have been finished and i know you'll want to get them you're going to want to get this book because they answer a lot of questions that's been in your heart something else that you need to understand about this book is this book was still being edited and grammarized through 1965. so brother branham had added the seals into this book it's not just the seven church ages the book is about the seven church ages but after the opening of the seals he injected what was taught in the seals and it goes right into this book as well so this is a post-seals book so the revelations that were unfolded after the seals you will find in this book so this is not secondary to the seals this book is not something that has to be corrected by the seals this book has those truths those mysteries that were under the seven seals are in this book okay so that's why when i read this it might lock somebody up but i don't want to lock anybody up brother branham endorsed this book he edited this book he proofread this book and he said you should get it it'll answer a lot of questions that's in your heart amen and he specifically was talking about the question of the book of life name on the book or having your name removed off the book which is what we're going to get into when we talk about book of life and that specific question he said will be answered in the church age book are we on the same page since that's our questions and that's our topic we're going to go to the place where brother van gogh's do i got tons of other quotes we'll get into as well but that this is where i want to read from so the first place i want to read from is the the sardisian church age and i'm going to read from page 266 about halfway down now we talked about the sovereignty of god and now we're going to attach the sovereignty of god to the book of life we're coming back and picking up our subject book of life the possibility of the removal of a name from the records of god deserves more than a casual study now i want to go back to this quote i read in 1965 the anointed ones at the end time because he says dr level sitting here he's grammarizing this book of the seven church ages and the problem came up or the question about your name taken off the lamb's book of life and i just read the possibility of the removal of a name from the records of god deserves more than a casual study so he's saying here is the question about name taken off the book of life it's puzzled a lot of ministers but wait till you get the book and you'll understand it if you just got any light in you see there's the question but he's telling us to go here for the answer to that specific question about name taken off the book that's why i'm going to read from here the possibility the removal of a name from the records of god deserves more than a casual study and he goes from here all the way through to the end of this chapter and he does 20 pages on this study right here for up until now most students have merely drawn a conclusion that god places the names of those born again within the lamb's book of life at the time of their rebirth and if for any reason that name must be removed the space on the record will simply be blank as it was before a name had been placed there this is 100 opposite to what the word actually teaches at the very start of our study let it be known that there is not one scripture that teaches that god is presently compiling a record of names this was all done before the foundation of the world as we will point out shortly so there is no there god is not adding names to the book of life god is not watching over the banister of heaven waiting for people to come to the altar and he's not oh they're coming they're coming they're coming shh don't move they're at the old they confessed my name right i'm on the book i'm so happy they came god is not doing that god knew that they would come before the foundation of the world and then he put their name on the book and then he determined that he was going to seal them by the blood of the cross then back then that the shed blood of the lamb was going to be the purchase price for all those on the book finn and he hasn't added a name since so if you believe by faith that your name is on that book did you have to do with it and what can you do about it nothing just serve god amen let's keep going 1961 brother branham says abraham's grace covenant when was the lamb slain 2 000 years ago in calvary not in god's sight he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world when god saw what satan had done his program was laid out and he knowed that he would send his son and he would be a propitiation for our sins and in the mind of jehovah in the mind of jehovah to conquer and keep his people he slayed the lamb in his own mind before the foundation of the world and put your name on the book as redeemed glory that's what he done god did that then what are you scared about then what are you scared about see god's not here for us we're here for god god's not here to exercise his authority on our will by our what we ask for and what we want out of this life he's not here to exercise his power and authority and dominion on our will we are here to express his will and when we express his will and come into a place of need whether it be for healing or financial help or a crisis in our lives if we are expressing his will because we're in a fallen state and in a fallen world he paid the price with the sacrifice that would release to us power by the purchase of the blood to help us in our time of need not because we want it but because we're in the process of expressing his will and coming to a place where we need healing in our body to continue to express his will so he purchased for us healing so that he could apply healing to us according to his purpose and his pleasure not because we really really really want to be healed isn't that true if we could just adjust our thinking brother branham said you want god to heal you what for what's your motive in asking him what's your objective in being healed just so you can go on and make more money and just so you could live longer and prosper or watch your will what's your purpose god i'm down here trying to serve you as best as i can i'm leading my family i'm working in the church i'm witnessing i'm trying to be a lie and here satan is trying to hinder me and the work you've called me to do would you please heal me so that i can continue on in your will he said that's how to get what you asked for that's how to bring god on the scene it's not about us it's about him we've got to adjust our thinking he's not up there just saying oh who's going to use my power today and he's at the he's at the whim and call of every one of his children who will call on him and he must go into action just because we say something that's why we must pray in the spirit for the spirit knoweth the mind of god in 1954 in the message the unconditional covenant that god made with his people one day abraham no more than any other man maybe as far as we know coming out of babylon perhaps an idolater but god by election god does the choosing we can't choose we can't choose god does the choosing we have nothing to do with it how can you lose it man said oh brother i sought god i saw no man never sought god not in a man to seek god no man at any time or at any age ever sought god you know a lot of people will say i accepted jesus as my savior today i accepted god the question is has god accepted you that's the question because if your name is not on that book it doesn't matter how many times you accept god or you accept christ or you accept calvary if your name is not on that book by accepting something you can't put your name on that book the question is has god accepted you and how do you know when god has accepted you brother branham told us in the token if god has accepted your faith he gives you the seal of the baptism of the holy ghost as a token evidence that he has received your faith it's not everybody that says of their own will and their desire that i'm saved or i have christ it's not that at all because it's not by our own will our own desire it's by his will and his desire that's why he placed names on a book before the foundation of the world and that's why he presented the token in this day to give his children his believing children evidence that their faith has been accepted and the blood has been applied that's what the message token is all about amen we never sought god not in a man to seek god no man at any time or at any age ever sought god it's just vice versa it's god seeking the man not man seeking god jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him is that right john 6 37 says all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out john 6 43 jesus answered therefore answered and said unto him murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the father which has sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day how is it that you're being drawn to christ by the will of god john 15 16 jesus talking to his disciples ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you you know when jesus went to the disciples and different ones and he was he was going out and he was inviting them to come along or they were just deciding to come along like john and and all the others i'm sure they were making choices they were making decisions in their life shall i drop the net and leave my father's business or should i stay here and help him should i follow this that i believe is messiah this prophet of god or should i stay they're making choices in their life and they're choosing whether or not they'll stay or whether or not they'll go they're choosing whether or not they'll accept his invitation they're choosing whether or not they'll go and be a disciple of the lord or so they think they're choosing but he says you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit shall remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you who determined that jesus christ determine that amen we don't get to decide those things it wasn't adam that was looking for god when he sinned it was god who came into the garden that was seeking out adam and it's been that way ever since how many come into the message from another denomination or from the world raise your hand okay were you looking for more truth more light and a further revelation of jesus christ were you seeking god to know the opening of the seven seals i'm same way i didn't even know to care it's not that i didn't care i didn't know anything about anything so there was nothing to care about it wasn't me who sought out god it was god who sought me out and how about all of you who was it that sought you out were you on the hunt looking for a further revelation of christ were you on the hunt looking for the the the mystery of predestination were you on the hunt looking to be sealed into the eternal kingdom are we just going about your business living life like you've always lived life doing what you always do and god comes down and hunted you out hallelujah and we want to ask questions about well who didn't get to hear and who this and who that and who that is god god he knows where his seed is he know where the seed fell into the ground he knows where to put the water and he knows where to put the light and he knows that if it's seed and it gets water and it gets light it springs forth to life it's the human perspective they'll say but what about the millions of people who never heard about the message that's god's business that's not our business the same god who sought you out and the same god who sought me out is the same god who will seek out every single predestinated seed of god and bring it to life we're just lucky to be a part of it in missions work or witnessing or sharing with friends or passing on a book or a track we're just lucky to be part of it but it's not us and it's not them it's all him amen it's the sovereignty of god we worry about things we ought not to worry about we should just leave things in god's hands brother branham in this church age book he's talking about the vessels fitted to destruction he's talking about the wicked reserved into the day of judgment he's talking about god has created all things even the wicked for the day of evil and after he goes through that he's talking about the different categories of those who are in the book of life who are not in the book of life or have been removed from the book of life he gets to this section in the sardisian church age this is page 281 if you want to write it down in the middle it says since this portion of the word is hard for the human mind to grasp i would say that's true why because we're in a fallen flesh we don't see from god's perspective we don't see the whole plan we don't understand how all the puzzle pieces fit together perfectly we see inconsistencies we see problems we see injustice we see unfairness we see things that cause our heart to maybe say ah i don't know about that oh i don't like that that's why it's hard for the human mind it's because our perspective and our condition fallen flesh and an earthly carnal perspective right that's why we have to receive the baptism of the holy ghost and we have to receive newness of mind we have to receive the mind of christ all right since this portion of the word is hard for the human mind to grasp it must be accepted and believed by faith some will be offended by what i have set forth because they fail to understand the sovereignty of god which sets forth that god is god and i am glad that he is god he goes back to brother branham saying if god had not chosen psalm none would be saved because no man's ever at any time sought god it's god that sought man no man has ever had a desire to god it's god that had a desire to man man's had a desire to religion man's had a desire to worship but not a desire for the true revelation of the truth of god he's had a desire for a god of his own imagination and men all over the world the muslims and the hindus and the sikhs and even the christian religions they all have a desire to worship a god of their imagination but they don't have a desire to worship the god of the universe the one and only god creator god that's why it must be believed by faith because they fail to understand the sovereignty god which sets forth that god is god and because he is god one cannot defeat his counsels or thought his will and purpose but he being omnipotent is ruling in all affairs and is doing whatever he will with all his creation because all were created for his good pleasure further down he says that he would that he has the right to do this on the grounds of creation alone we cannot deny can you deny that who made it who has the right to decide right it'd be like if a sister here in the church made two apple pies right and she decided to give one to another family and she decides to give one to the neighbor and her kids come in hey that's not fair we want apple pie why did you give that one there and why'd you get that one to wear and mom looks and says hey i made the pie i can give it to whoever i want and god made everything and he can do with it whatever he chooses and if we take that away from god that's a god that i don't want to serve i don't want to serve a god that has to buckle under the pressure of a bunch of people praying i don't want to serve a god that'll change his mind because a lot of people don't think it's fair or just or it doesn't seem right i don't want to serve that kind of god i want to serve a god who knew the end from the beginning i want to serve a god who determined what was going to happen before the foundation of the world and will never change his mind that's the god i want to serve even if it means i'm outside of his plan that's still the god i want to serve because if god's not god there's no hope for all of us the only hope for any of us is that god will remain god yet he went even further for according so back up he has the right to do with with this on the grounds of creation alone he's got the right to do whatever he wants on the grounds of creation alone we cannot deny yet he went even further for according to romans 14 7-9 we have the irrefutable proof that jesus paid the purchase price of the whole world and therefore he can do as he wills with his own he's got double rights one he created it and secondly he spilled his blood to pay for it all to buy it all back what can he not do if he wanted to cast you in the hell what would you do about it what could you possibly say to thwart his will his will will be done period and his will is not changing period his will was determined on days of old in ancient times before the foundation of this world we're standing on that's when his will and purpose was determined and he's not going to change at all further down now if we impute omniscience to god we must also accept that he is perfect in wisdom and righteousness this plan of election and reprobation is the wisdom of god revealed in all ages we must trust god we must trust the determinate counsel of his own will we must trust that he is full of wisdom perfect in wisdom and perfect in righteousness and that he is perfectly just and that he is perfectly fair and that he will always do what's right you have to trust that it doesn't always look that way right through the human mind it doesn't always look that way but it's absolutely that way brother branham says and he that is in you 1963 and no one can be redeemed unless they were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world who are they i don't know it's the prophet of god who are they i don't know nobody else knows see just god alone i'm trusting that every one of us our names were on that book if mine was on there i'm sure to be there if it wasn't i won't be there this is the prophet of god talking that's all see just that's just up to god it's not him that willeth or him that runeth but god that showeth mercy so we start to look at this fair and not fair and how could this and how could that but there's something that brother branham injects in the third seal that i found to be very comforting and very helpful and the third seal in 1963 he says now he never noticed that before why he had been back there doing his mediatorial work for he was bleeding for the people intercession for the people until the last soul that was put in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world come in there's just going to be so many of them there and that's it that's all this is what he said the others won't even want to come in they have no desire to come in it's not that they're begging to be part of the bride oh please please please please make me part of the bride and he says nah they don't even have the desire to come in and submit their life completely to christ right because how can you come unless he draws you and if he draws you and gives you a desire what a great consolation that you're a part of it if he's calling you and you have a desire those those don't even have a desire now i know that you say well there's a there's there's thousands and thousands of people to believe the message they surely are not all bride no they're not but see it's not that they have a great love or a desire for some people are serving god in the message of the hour out of fear because they're afraid if i don't believe this i'll be cast out are afraid i have to line up to this and i better get all this right that's not a desire to have him that's not a desire to know him that's not a desire for him that's a desire to be safe because i'm afraid if i move from this i won't be safe don't worry god will rearrange the circumstances till all that gets purged out by the end time all right but there's some who are serving out of fear that's not what he's talking about but those with a great inward desire and a love for god who desire to be part of the bride do i be identified to be with christ to be indwelled with a very living god those people who desire that more than life those are the one whose it's for not the ones who are afraid of being on the outside and left behind fear is no motivator here fear will not get you what you want fear does not come from god that's not it but inside oh there's something there you can't shake it you can't deny it you didn't put it there you didn't buy it you can't sell it you didn't trade for it nobody's taking out but inside of you is a longing for god a longing for christ not the god of my imagination because every time i see him revealed in his word i love him more even when it's contrary to what i used to think i deny what i used to think and i love him more every time i hear the prophet of god say something that's totally opposite the way i thought it was i reject my thinking and i accept what he said because i love him more because of the desire that's in my heart i'm not serving a god of my own imagination i'm not serving a god of my own makeup i'm serving the god of the universe who happened to come down in this age and share what's been laying in the back part of his mind all down to redemption and he began to speak it and share it through his mouthpiece and those that have a desire unto him love it they're not afraid to not be part of it they're not afraid that they have to accept certain doctrines oh i've got to step servants here and i've got to be baptized in the in the name of jesus christ i've got to accept that i prophecy him or else i'm going to lose it that's not it you don't have it yet but when god drops in there that seed of eternal life that was there when you were born it was there before you were born it was designated to be but in the soul there's laying that germ of life and there's something that gets quickened by the word of the hour and you can never erase that thing now if you were serving god because of a love for a spouse if you're serving god because of a love for a mom and dad if you're serving a god because of a love of the church or you're in the message because you're afraid not to be then that's not the quickening of the seed but when the seeds quicken even if my spouse disbelieves even if my parents disbelieve even if my children all fall away even if every single person in the church falls away i still have a desire to him hallelujah and if you can find yourself in that position what have you to be afraid of but if you find your position in serving because of another one or submitting to certain things because i'm afraid not to if you find yourself in that position you need to pray say god i don't have it yet and god if there's a seed of eternal life laying in here lord let it come to life i need to be motivated by something other than human emotion human love affection for people i need to be motivated by something other than intellectual understanding i need to be motivated by something other than i'm afraid to not be part of it i need to be motivated by your love amen we need to pray that god will quicken that and that the desire will be the desire of the heart not the desire of the mind not the desire the human spirit realm but the desire of the soul but oh if it's the desire of the soul what consolation what consolation it is that the sovereign god of the universe placed inside just a few people on the planet not masses not the majority but just a few people on the planet he dropped something inside of him that he knew would be there from before the foundation of the world and he placed something there that would quicken the life when they come in contact with the revealed word and it would sprout and that they would have a desire to be united with christ what consolation if you find that in your soul today what consolation ii peter 2 9 says the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and how to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished god knows how to do that we look at that and say oh reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished that's so sad what's the first half of the verse god the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations hallelujah if you're part of him he knows how to deliver you out of every temptation out of every trial out of every hardship out of every doubt out of every circumstance you find yourself in it's the lord who knows how to deliver you out why because before the foundation of the world his desire was to you and he's not going to change his mind just because you're in a trial or you're in a temptation or you're failing amen let's look at romans chapter eight let's all stand musicians and brother asking if you want to come we'll read this last section together romans chapter 8 and verse 29. let's start at verse 28 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose this is one reason i don't like other bible translations and other versions of the bible because you know what it changes that to not be called but just called but you know what there are a v called people on the earth 29 for whom he did for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified it's finished in the mind of god the whole work is finished we've already come into glorification why because it's his mind now verse 31 what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us if in the mind of god we're foreknown predestinated called glorified well what are we going to say to those things if god before us who can be against us i can never fail if i find myself in that place amen what a consolation you know if you're not sure if you're in that place if you just don't know if you have questions you don't know if it's for you something on the inside has to quicken come to life so the desire is not fear the desire is not human the desire is not intellect but the desire is a god-given desire that come from before the foundation of the world that is drawing you back to the place where you came from back to origins why is it why is it when you when you hear the message of the hour you know for me when i was hearing it i wasn't so much liking it went contrary to everything that i ever thought not everything but most everything that i ever thought about the bible was true this was backwards that it was opposite it was going the opposite direction and it was uncomfortable and i didn't like it and all those things that go with it but something down deep no matter how much my mind and my flesh resisted something down deep when i was hearing oh i couldn't explain it it scared me it scared me i would pray on my knees lord help me not to believe in false doctrine help me not to believe in a false prophet oh god you've got to spare me because i knew there was something inside of me that was so attracted to what i was hearing on the tapes and it was so contrary to my mind i was scared to death it frightened me it wasn't like i went running for the message with everything that's in me i couldn't stay away because i would have my first inclination was turn and run bolt this is different this is weird this is false but there's a resonation inside of me that that word resonates when that words preach and when i hear those tapes it's hitting something not between my ears it's hitting something so deep in me it's calling forth for a life and it's calling the life out that's laying in the seed and it's calling it and calling it and calling it and i can't do anything but respond to it amen that's why we're here because we're responding to the call for the coming forth of the life that's laying in the seat and what's calling it to come forth the sunlight this bright sunlight and the water of the word and the presence of god is calling for that seed to produce and to come forth and all we're doing is responding we recede before we ever hit the earth and we'll be seed long after we leave the earth how many find ourselves there what a consolation to us let's just sing that song can we sing he knows my name you know 1006 is the number [Music] i have a maker he formed my heart began my life was in his hand he knows my name he knows my every thought he sees each tear that falls and he hears me [Music] he calls me [Music] he knows my name he knows my every thought he sees [Music] if that song is true for you right and only you know nobody else can tell you but when you sing the words of that song only you know if they're true or not and if you can sing that with faith knowing it's true what in the world are we afraid of there's nothing to fear there's nothing to worry about there's no anxiety there's no fear there's no stress there's no pressure in that revelation so when we experience stress and pressure and anxiety and fear and depression it's because somehow the the world has moved us away from that reality and we have to continually stay in the word until we keep bringing our whole reality back to this truth i have a maker he knows my name he formed my heart he had to know my name because he had to know what he was going to write on his book before the foundation world because i know i'm on the book hallelujah do you know it for sure no i've never read the book but there's something in my heart that says i'm there by faith i believe i'm there by faith it's a reality to me it's not a mysterious just mystical little vapor of a fairy tale it's a reality where is it a reality brother chad in my heart it's real you can't take it away hallelujah we should be the happiest freest most delivered people on the face of the planet god has never at any time done so much to prove to prove to a people who he is and what truth is and where they fit into that truth as he has in our day we should be absolutely liberated from this world hallelujah i for one am ready for the final liberation when this old vile form is changed into one like in his form and i go to meet him in the air that's the day that i'm longing for that's my focus hallelujah amen well we have the results for the vote of confirmation from brother steve golden and by a vast vast majority brother steve has been confirmed by the body of the congregation as a deacon in this church and we just believe that we have found the perfect mind of god [Applause] [Music] i think it'd be appropriate this time if we just prayed with brother steve brother steve could you come down and the deacons and ministers you want to come forward we just like to lay hands on brother steve you know what brother steve has done and him and his family included his wife and children with him they have not got a promotion right they have not moved up in status in life they have not gained power and authority what they've done is they've opened themselves up for an attack from the devil because they decided to serve the body of jesus christ in a greater way than they have today and we want to pray that god would hedge them about with protection that god would give our brother divine wisdom of the holy ghost to administer the office that he now holds so we want to pray as a body of believers let's just gather around right here with brother steve come in close brothers dear heavenly father we lay hands on our brothers a confirmation of your divine will and we believe lord we've received your mind and that brother steve is the vessel that you have chosen to fill this place at this time in this body of believers so we confer upon him all of the blessings lord that you can confer upon him that your word holds we pray that you give him wisdom lord that he can administer the office and give him a heart to the people lord that him and his wife can serve the people of god that you would anoint him with understanding with a sensitivity far beyond what he's had before with spiritual discernment with the knowledge to handle every situation that he would face and god we just pray that you would use him to administer to the needs of this assembly god we also ask that you would hedge him about and protect him and his wife and his children lord from all the fiery darts of the enemy no doubt he would love to cause confusion and doubt and fear to come in but we just pray that you'd be a shield and a buckler to our brother to his family that you would undergird him and protect him and that you would hold him in the palm of your hand and that you would shield him from all the fiery darts of the enemy and god we just pray for the whole assembly now we just bind our hearts together and pray that we all minister our place in the body and we all come up a little higher lord and we all press towards the mark of the high calling in christ we bless our brother and we ask lord that you would bless him mightily in the name of jesus christ bless you lord amen i was talking to brother steve and sister didn't that the other day and i was saying you know i was in a comfortable position not too long ago and it was in the position of where you defer everything up right there's a conflict if there's a problem there's a question just defer okay just go there i'm not the one go there and that was a wonderful position to be in and i always thought you know the the elders those that are coming up in age those are taking responsibility just pass it pass it pass it but then i started thinking the other day i'm not a baby anymore and it's not fair to constantly be passing up to the previous generation and not be bearing my share of the load and you know we we thank god for the men and the women who stand in their position their post of duty and are not passing it up they say this is mine this is my responsibility i'll take it whether it's teaching sunday school whether it's visiting shut-ins whether it's preparing meals for people or trustees or deacons or ministers or whatever it is but they're saying i'm not going to wait for somebody else to do it i'm not going to pass it up it's my time to take responsibility in the body so i appreciate brother steve being willing to do that amen let's sing that song i really liked it worthy is the lamb that he's saying before he came out were these lambs seated on the throne we'll sing this as you're dismissed you can be dismissed as we sing thank you for the [Music] lord all my sin and shame in [Music] this love lord thank you for the nail please [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] jesus of god the treasure of heaven [Music] [Music] is [Music] bearing all my sin and shame in love you came and you gave amazing grace oh thank you for
