[4:58] was in town he and his wife were here
[5:00] visiting and and so I I just asked him
[5:03] last night I called him last evening and

[5:06] us and he so graciously accepted so I
[5:09] was so thankful for that so we're
[5:10] blessed to have our brother minnow here
[5:12] to minister for us this evening amen
[5:15] before we get into the prayer request I
[5:17] have a special announcement

[5:32] [Music]
[5:32] [Applause]
[5:34] thank you amen this exciting
[5:37] announcement you know how I feel about
[5:39] social media ruins the pastor's
[5:41] privilege to make all announcements so
[5:43] by the time we get around to it most
[5:45] everybody already knows if I could
[5:46] abolish that I would one of my
[5:49] privileges has been taken away but
[5:51] they're hoping to have a wedding here
[5:52] soon in the spring so amen may we all
[5:55] lend our support and help them any way
[5:57] we can and we're excited for the two of
[5:59] them
[6:00] amen God bless it
[6:02] certainly like I said it's a privilege
[6:04] I've put the minnow here
[6:06] brother minnow precedes me by many a
[6:09] year in Lima Ohio he was he was
[6:12] pastoring here in Lyman when I was an
[6:14] infant
[6:15] and so many of you know him quite well
[6:17] some of you may not you may be new and
[6:19] may not know him as well but he's a
[6:22] pastored in Lima for some time he may
[6:25] have been many of your pastor at one
[6:26] point or another but then he moved up to
[6:28] Saskatchewan he's pastored there ever
[6:30] since and I appreciate men like brother
[6:33] minnow because they blazed the trail and
[6:36] we're walking the path we have a lot to
[6:39] owe for the generation that labored for
[6:41] decades Amen to keep the the word true
[6:44] Amen to keep the way open and coming out
[6:46] of denominations and helping many come
[6:48] out and come to this glorious word and
[6:50] stay faithful so so many have fallen
[6:53] away but there's so many that has been
[6:55] held faithful by the Holy Spirit and for
[6:58] those men I'm thankful so it's it's a
[7:00] great privilege to have brother minnow
[7:01] here today and and I really look up to
[7:03] him and appreciate him and I'm thankful
[7:05] that his wife was able to join him and
[7:07] that we're able to have him Minister

[9:38] amen God bless you you can be seated
[9:41] I want to greet you tonight it is uh
[9:45] it's a pleasure to be here I
[9:48] I really was trying to get out of it I
[9:51] was hoping he wouldn't call me I thought
[9:52] I just people walk in and enjoy you know
[9:55] like you all of these years you're never
[9:57] quite get used to it it's just uh but
[10:00] just a part of you so pray for me I'm
[10:03] just uh I don't know if I'm going to
[10:05] preach tonight but I'm going to talk for
[10:06] a while
[10:07] and maybe then I need to pick it up
[10:09] somewhere but I uh this has always been
[10:11] a we are here upon one little thing that
[10:14] we decided years ago uh Irene and I we
[10:17] said ever get to the place to where we
[10:19] should get old enough to where uh wooden
[10:21] Pastor anymore and last year I turned 80
[10:23] and I said well you know it must be
[10:26] getting very close
[10:27] and uh so this this winter or this this
[10:30] as of January our son-in-law Dwayne fair
[10:32] by the way who sends his love and his
[10:34] greetings he married our daughter Connie
[10:36] and they sent the love the whole church
[10:38] sends a love wherever we went and where
[10:40] we go and of course llama is a little
[10:42] special to us because it's it's a place
[10:44] yeah where we did that's the first place
[10:45] I ever pastored about a year and a half
[10:48] something like that and uh
[10:50] but I was around the the Tabernacle I
[10:53] think one of the first times I ever came
[10:55] to this area was the 1975. and brother
[10:58] Biscoe was invited to preach at brother
[11:01] Tom Brown's barn and uh brother Ed
[11:04] called and said brother why don't you
[11:06] meet me there I was in I was in Michigan
[11:08] here and so uh brother uh I forget the
[11:12] brother brother Henry he drove me down
[11:15] here it's the first time I came down
[11:16] here in 1975. so uh it kind of puts us
[11:19] way back now I have to confess one thing
[11:22] I don't think we I didn't think we'd be
[11:23] here in the year 2023
[11:27] uh I I didn't uh I don't think any of us
[11:31] did some of you Elders you know what I'm
[11:33] talking about and uh but it's been a
[11:35] glorious time to lay in the presence of
[11:37] the word and ripen
[11:39] and uh sometimes it's uh has to break it
[11:42] down and knock it down and start all
[11:44] over again but but uh the master knows
[11:47] what he's building
[11:49] and uh he's not had to reject any yet he
[11:52] uh he knows how to put it together and
[11:55] uh sometimes we try to do it we kind of
[11:57] get in his way and I kind of like what
[12:00] brother Brian said I don't want to get
[12:01] in his way I'd like to at least be
[12:02] behind him so I could catch up but I
[12:05] don't be in his way we always want to be
[12:07] him
[12:08] to be ahead of us in all things that we
[12:10] do and uh but I I was reading in the old
[12:14] Paul in the book of Acts and I said to
[12:16] my wife what we'd like to do sometimes
[12:17] we if we had a little time so this is
[12:20] the year we took a month in Arizona and
[12:24] then we started heading towards the east
[12:26] and come up to Manny Louisiana and saw
[12:29] the scientists there and up to brother
[12:32] Pruitt's church and uh had a Time
[12:35] weekend service there with them and then
[12:38] and brother uh
[12:41] well uh
[12:43] he's leaving me bro Reagan's place and
[12:45] uh we were there as well and saw the new
[12:47] Tabernacle they built and and um I I uh
[12:51] you know we're getting some of the
[12:52] nicest buildings there is in the in the
[12:54] world but uh but those are just the
[12:57] outside I know this is all volcanic ash
[12:59] is going to pass anyhow but the real
[13:01] building that God's Building is the
[13:04] Tabernacle made by the Holy Ghost
[13:07] but uh we kind of always said I'd like
[13:10] to make a round trip and just go back
[13:11] and kind of you know like I think Paul
[13:13] and Barnabas and acts the uh 15th
[13:16] chapter there they said something like
[13:18] this let's let let us go again to visit
[13:21] our brethren in every city where we have
[13:24] preached the word of God where we've
[13:26] preached the word of the Lord and see
[13:27] how they do
[13:29] I kind of like that last part and see
[13:31] how they do and it's good to go and get
[13:34] it walk into a place like this and
[13:36] wherever we walked in we found that
[13:39] there's there's a people pressing
[13:41] towards the mark there's not just
[13:43] loafing around they've got a goal there
[13:45] their whole seems like their hearts on
[13:48] fire for the Lord now of course you
[13:49] don't get those in every place those
[13:51] that slack off and we never get away
[13:53] from the one thing that we understand
[13:54] there's always three kinds of Believers
[13:56] but there's a genuine bride that I
[13:58] believe is being formed by word cell
[14:00] upon word cell she's she's on the earth
[14:02] now
[14:03] and I'm by the grace of the Lord I
[14:06] believe I'm a part of them
[14:07] a part of her and uh but I want to bring
[14:10] you greetings also brother like I just
[14:12] said only the church in Saskatoon
[14:14] and they sent their greetings to all of
[14:17] you said wherever you go and uh We've uh
[14:20] you know in this area we kind of certain
[14:23] people were outstanding when we were
[14:24] here there's like the Yanks the woods
[14:26] the Davis the uh different uh Hatfields
[14:30] and the different ones of course I can't
[14:32] see you it's good you're uh you know how
[14:34] the lights are in the eyes
[14:37] it's like driving in the headlights you
[14:39] know going down the highway
[14:41] with a high beam on
[14:44] excuse me and um
[14:47] but I but I want to just say that it's
[14:49] been a pleasure during the years I was
[14:51] coming back and you're you see the
[14:53] children's children's children and uh
[14:55] not all I'm going on with the Lord but
[14:57] there's one thing we we have a promise
[15:00] I never pray I never stop praying and
[15:02] believing for those that that God has
[15:05] let us raise remember the prophet said
[15:06] he gives us a special promise for this
[15:09] age for this is the last of all ages as
[15:12] far as we understand here this evening
[15:14] that this is the This is the End we're
[15:17] summing up God is summing up the book of
[15:20] redemption
[15:21] it's it's going to be closed one of
[15:24] these you see less and less and not to
[15:26] say that there there we don't know how
[15:28] long we don't know that we we understand
[15:31] by the scripture and by the message when
[15:33] the propheter was here he he spoke
[15:35] urgently
[15:36] concerning the time
[15:38] and I believe it's always good to be
[15:40] ready always
[15:42] just I found out one thing now the Bible
[15:44] said just be ready when he comes when he
[15:46] comes in the morning
[15:48] uh just keep walking with the Lord and
[15:50] that's one of the greatest things that I
[15:52] think that we know we're walking in the
[15:54] truth we're not stumbling around trying
[15:56] to find something to walk with to walk
[15:59] Thy word is truth God has pulled the
[16:02] veil off of our eyes and we see the
[16:05] things that the Lord is doing and I'm
[16:07] glad to be a part of it the great work
[16:09] of God Amen you know there's a little
[16:11] song out
[16:14] uh give me Kiev
[16:16] [Music]
[16:18] yeah
[16:20] if you have the words there is a source
[16:25] in times of need
[16:27] I'm so glad there's a source aren't you
[16:29] [Music]
[16:31] you never have to worry about
[16:33] will he be there
[16:35] will the Lord hear my prayer
[16:37] you know he already knows before you're
[16:39] going to ask what you're going to ask
[16:42] he's not troubled he's not ringing his
[16:44] hands whether he's going to be able to
[16:46] help you or not
[16:47] he's not wondering whether you're going
[16:49] to be able to reach him or not
[16:51] he has a provided way he is the provided
[16:54] way
[16:56] and he loves to hear you ask
[16:58] [Music]
[16:59] you know what the prophet said don't
[17:01] ever be afraid to ask much
[17:04] because he's got much
[17:06] and when he gives much he has no less
[17:08] than what he gave
[17:11] inexhaustible fountain
[17:13] amen
[17:18] there is a soul
[17:22] s in time
[17:25] it gives me
[17:28] strength it brings me peace through
[17:34] every tribe
[17:36] through every test
[17:40] my savior stands
[17:43] in my defense
[17:47] showing the road you want
[17:50] leave you tired and warm
[17:54] all your strength is gone
[17:57] and your heart feels torn
[18:01] remember God
[18:03] is greater than the storm
[18:08] take her before
[18:10] the battle is
[18:15] become
[18:18] [Music]
[18:26] [Music]
[18:28] he holds my hand
[18:32] unless I should
[18:34] falter and makes me stand
[18:39] out on the water
[18:42] so when the road you walk
[18:46] leave you tight and warm
[18:49] and your strength is gone
[18:52] and your heart feels torn
[18:56] remember God
[18:59] is greater than the storm take her
[19:04] before
[19:06] the battle is the Lord
[19:10] take courage for the battle is the Lord
[19:16] amen I think we get that from the
[19:19] scripture thank you very much
[19:21] I always enjoy that because of I think
[19:24] of so many times you know we sat out and
[19:25] we said oh I'm going to do this and I'm
[19:26] going to do this but the good thing to
[19:28] pray said Lord go before me
[19:30] David one time was going to you know
[19:32] take the battle we read the Old
[19:33] Testament how sometimes every once in a
[19:35] while God did a miracle he said now just
[19:37] step back so you don't have to do
[19:38] anything I'll do this one
[19:41] I I won't need you as much of that time
[19:44] you know but God does things in his own
[19:46] way that's what I love about God he's
[19:48] sovereign
[19:49] you know he doesn't deal with us the
[19:51] same way we're not just cut out the same
[19:53] just like made the same God's very
[19:56] mindful every one of our needs they're
[19:57] different
[19:58] we're made up different we're boring if
[20:01] we're all the same
[20:03] it sure would be but I'm grateful
[20:05] tonight I want this I want to read a
[20:07] little scripture and some time ago I was
[20:10] I uh you know I was driving along and as
[20:15] we always do and you know ministers
[20:16] always I don't know brother Chad you
[20:19] know how it is uh we uh we've got one of
[20:21] the finest things there is in life we we
[20:23] get along we've always got an open line
[20:27] I I like that I'm glad so you don't have
[20:29] to go on a needle somewhere and be in a
[20:30] certain position or whether you're
[20:32] driving your car where you're at I love
[20:34] that about our Lord he's always he's
[20:36] always listening you can talk to him
[20:39] anytime never too late too early
[20:41] and you can discuss what you need to
[20:43] discuss at length
[20:45] sometimes he likes to hear all the
[20:48] things that we that we are troubled with
[20:50] or that we're going through
[20:51] but then he comes along and says well
[20:53] now you just wait till I do it
[20:55] now that's where we usually get in
[20:56] trouble we get a little impatient with
[20:57] God
[20:58] if you're anything like me I've I you
[21:00] know I used to say I got a lot of
[21:01] patience as long as I got it right now
[21:03] so in the over the years my wife has
[21:06] helped me
[21:08] my wife's saying by the way sitting back
[21:10] to Irene most of these people know her
[21:11] and uh we've been uh We've also hadn't
[21:15] reached another Milestone we're married
[21:16] 60 years this year
[21:18] so that
[21:23] to that young couple that just got
[21:25] engaged uh God bless you you know next
[21:28] to Salvation you've just made the most
[21:30] important decision that you'll ever make
[21:32] in this life
[21:34] or if God hath put them together
[21:36] who can put them asunder
[21:40] not with the preacher puts them together
[21:41] not of the church or the parents or
[21:44] somebody but if God puts them together
[21:47] there's nothing can separate them
[21:49] that's what we are so happy too I'm glad
[21:51] this is not the work of man this is the
[21:54] work of God
[21:55] I wasn't looking for the Lord were you
[21:58] frankly I try to get away from him as
[22:00] much as I could
[22:01] I didn't like things that kept him
[22:03] victim when I did wrong
[22:05] I didn't like it
[22:07] I Want to Be Free of that
[22:09] kept running kept running but you know
[22:11] you got to stop running once in a while
[22:13] but eventually anyhow so he just I gave
[22:16] up when I was about 19 years old and I
[22:18] just wish it would have started earlier
[22:19] and uh but I thank the Lord and and as I
[22:24] was going along saying it always uh
[22:26] brother bam said uh the song they used
[22:29] to sing it shall be a light
[22:31] about the evening time
[22:34] the path to Glory you will surely find
[22:36] so I started singing it real slow I
[22:39] started listening to every word
[22:41] it shall be light
[22:44] about the evening time now you got a
[22:46] whole message there
[22:48] the path
[22:50] to Glory
[22:52] you will surely find
[22:55] that sounds pretty secure
[22:57] then he shows us how in the Waterway is
[23:00] the light today
[23:02] buried in the precious name of Jesus
[23:04] Christ
[23:05] young and old repent of all your sins
[23:07] just one one way
[23:10] does not want a different way for young
[23:12] people oh we got to talk them into it no
[23:13] they have to be born again just like we
[23:15] did
[23:17] they've got to be justified Sanctified
[23:19] filled with the Holy Ghost so the Holy
[23:20] Ghost themselves can be personified in
[23:22] their life
[23:23] it takes that without it you're a church
[23:25] member God's not coming for church
[23:27] members he's coming for sons and
[23:29] daughters
[23:31] the evening light he goes on to sing
[23:33] that
[23:34] [Music]
[23:35] in the Waterway is the light today
[23:37] burden the precious name of Jesus Christ
[23:39] young and old repent of all your sins
[23:41] the Holy Ghost will surely enter in
[23:45] I said oh I hope I get the Holy Ghost
[23:47] sorry I promise you know that brother
[23:49] Bobby said you don't even need to pray
[23:51] for it I pray about it
[23:53] he said you do this you repent genuinely
[23:55] and baptized in my name and I will give
[23:58] you the Holy Ghost that's his promise
[24:00] that's how he works that's how he
[24:02] operates I can't change his mind about
[24:04] his word
[24:05] it's still just the same
[24:07] a birth is still a mess no matter how
[24:10] nice we dress
[24:12] where we live whether we've got money or
[24:14] no money at all the birth is still a
[24:16] mess
[24:17] and you try to make it down to the place
[24:19] to where he said well I'll just hold my
[24:21] hands just right and say Lord forgive me
[24:23] that's all right
[24:25] but if that's all you get
[24:27] you've got to get the assurance that
[24:29] he's heard your prayer when he does he
[24:30] seals you in but I like the part how he
[24:33] continues art the Holy Ghost will surely
[24:35] enter enter in the evening light has
[24:37] come
[24:39] but this is the part I really like it is
[24:41] a fact
[24:43] that God and Christ are one they got to
[24:46] sing in that I stopped that it is a fact
[24:50] it is a fact
[24:52] it is a fact that God in Christ they
[24:54] want to be it is a fact that Jehovah of
[24:55] the oldest Jesus of the is the fact that
[24:58] he that started the work will finish it
[25:00] and I get I got you know what I just
[25:02] went on driving by myself I kept saying
[25:04] all the fact it is a fact you know what
[25:06] the fact means that it's not very you
[25:08] don't have to be very smart to
[25:09] understand what that means but let's say
[25:10] this it says anything already done
[25:14] actually true
[25:16] that which has happened
[25:19] it is a fact
[25:21] that God sent Elijah to turn the hearts
[25:23] of the children back to the faith of the
[25:25] fathers it is a fact it's not to be
[25:27] argued about disputed about it's a fact
[25:29] it's already over
[25:31] the message went around the world and
[25:33] out of every nation Kindred and people
[25:35] come there are people today worship him
[25:37] God in spirit and in truth they've taken
[25:39] this message in their heart they believe
[25:40] it just like we do well you know when
[25:42] you get a minister from Africa India
[25:44] wherever it comes from start preaching
[25:45] the message here sound just the same now
[25:47] sometimes you get a little awful a bit
[25:48] but just let it keep growing
[25:51] amen they'll come out the same place
[25:54] there's only one way
[25:56] he is the way
[25:57] I'm going to read a scripture Ephesians
[26:00] and um
[26:01] just uh as a I don't believe every any
[26:04] service is complete without
[26:06] the scripture but I like this little
[26:09] part in Ephesians the second chapter and
[26:12] just for a little background and then
[26:15] maybe make some comments on it if I
[26:17] could
[26:18] Ephesians 2
[26:20] 11
[26:22] to 22 Why Don't We Stand Together as we
[26:24] read that in the respect and honor to
[26:27] God's word
[26:36] whoever remember
[26:38] that ye being in time past Gentiles in
[26:41] the flesh
[26:42] who are called uncircumcision by that
[26:46] which is called the circumcision in the
[26:48] flesh made by hands
[26:51] that at that time ye were without Christ
[26:54] being alien from the Commonwealth of
[26:56] Israel and strangers from the covenants
[27:00] of Promise having no hope
[27:03] and without God in the world
[27:06] what a place to be
[27:08] how horrible
[27:10] but now in Christ Jesus
[27:12] ye who sometimes were far off are made
[27:15] nigh by the blood of Christ
[27:17] for he is our peace
[27:19] who hath made both one
[27:21] and hath broken down the middle wall a
[27:24] partition between us amen having
[27:27] abolished in his flesh the enmity even
[27:30] the law of Commandments contained at
[27:33] ordinances for to make in him of Twain
[27:36] one new man
[27:38] Soul making peace
[27:41] and that he might reconcile both unto
[27:44] God in one body by the cross having
[27:46] slain the enmity thereby
[27:50] and came and preached peace to you which
[27:53] were far off
[27:54] and to them that were nigh
[27:57] for through him
[27:59] we both have excess by one Spirit unto
[28:02] the father
[28:03] now therefore ye are no more strangers
[28:06] and foreigners
[28:08] but fellow citizens
[28:11] with the Saints and of the household of
[28:14] God
[28:15] and our built up upon the foundation of
[28:18] the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[28:20] himself being the Chief Cornerstone
[28:23] in whom all the building fitly framed
[28:27] together growth unto a holy Temple in
[28:30] the Lord in whom also
[28:34] and him he also are builded together for
[28:37] a habitation of God through the spirit
[28:41] you can be seated if you want
[28:43] I like that last part there and just to
[28:46] pull on that a little bit
[28:48] in whom ye also are building together
[28:51] for a habitation of God
[28:55] I love that part
[28:58] God is always he is in control of all
[29:01] things
[29:02] and I was just saying some of the things
[29:04] that we uh particular are privileged of
[29:08] was as the message we understand that
[29:10] that we didn't just he didn't just come
[29:13] and tell us a few little things about
[29:14] that happened in this age but God rich
[29:17] in Mercy went back way and before there
[29:20] was time itself and began to unfold
[29:22] himself to his body and came down in
[29:25] this last day and and broke back all
[29:27] pulled back all the veils right clear
[29:29] back to the Millennium Beyond to the new
[29:32] city
[29:33] clear back to it pulled it all back and
[29:35] showed us what has happened what is
[29:37] happening what's going to happen
[29:40] it is the most wonderful thing when you
[29:42] think sometimes on the and yet then we
[29:44] look at uh as you know so many times you
[29:47] you we're human beings we're we're in a
[29:49] body
[29:50] that they'll always give us trouble as
[29:53] long as we're here
[29:55] at several places brother Graham said
[29:57] now uh you know your your flesh Veil
[30:01] is what really keeps you from seeing God
[30:04] is what keeps you from seeing the angels
[30:06] that are here tonight
[30:10] they if you had that Dimension and of
[30:12] course then he goes out and talks about
[30:13] uh Elijah and gehaza and so on
[30:16] and uh how that when his eyes were
[30:18] opened he saw what Elijah saw of course
[30:20] when the situation came
[30:22] he looked and saw exactly what the
[30:23] prophet saw
[30:25] and that's the way it is with the real
[30:27] True Believer sometimes the prophet will
[30:29] say things and say oh I can't see that
[30:31] he says the Lord open my eyes first
[30:33] thing you know say oh that's how touches
[30:35] over here oh that's out come over here
[30:36] oh that's why this happened oh that's
[30:38] why I didn't that's why I tried to force
[30:40] it but it wouldn't work
[30:41] we tried to pray pray you know yeah pray
[30:45] the spirit off somebody when God put it
[30:46] on the person
[30:48] sometimes we'll try to pray off
[30:49] something that God has put on a person
[30:51] so oh I don't know oh yes yes you know
[30:54] brother bam said now God doesn't see one
[30:57] of your sins if you're in Christ Jesus
[30:59] you were there before the foundational
[31:00] world he said you come from the bosom of
[31:02] God and going back to the bosom of God
[31:07] you know there's a there's something
[31:10] brother bam says about that but let me
[31:12] just remember he's talking about the
[31:13] little dewdrop
[31:15] and I asked glisten said well in the
[31:17] morning comes and said then it's under
[31:19] on the clothes line or on the fence line
[31:20] and said and that little dewdrop that
[31:22] during the darkness of night
[31:24] begin to form
[31:26] and then when the Sun starts coming out
[31:28] starts glistering it starts shaking and
[31:29] it makes the most beautiful comment he
[31:31] said it begins to Rejoice because it
[31:33] knows it's going to go back to where it
[31:35] came from
[31:36] he said now that's the way every
[31:38] Christian is well the Holy Ghost starts
[31:39] dealing with you and starts working on
[31:40] you you begin to realize you're
[31:42] something's calling you back to where
[31:44] you were you know you don't remember it
[31:46] but you know by the promise of God that
[31:48] you come from God and you come from the
[31:49] bosom of God and going back to the bosom
[31:51] of God
[31:52] on the little message countdown brother
[31:54] Brown preaches several times to get to
[31:55] the place and he said oh just think of
[31:57] this last day he said now we're in the
[31:58] capsule Jesus Christ the word we're
[32:01] inside of them the countdown is on
[32:04] he said just think we're going back to
[32:05] the bosom of God where we came from
[32:08] but you dwell in a body that as long as
[32:10] you live here we'll give you trouble
[32:14] and he'll never take it away
[32:17] they leave it there he has a purpose
[32:21] but someday
[32:23] you know someday when this body will
[32:26] take on immortality then we'll be able
[32:28] to worship right we really want to
[32:30] worship he actually says you know you
[32:32] never he said we can't worship the way
[32:33] we would like to
[32:35] you ever feel that sometimes you just
[32:37] say oh I'd like to set my wings and just
[32:39] fly oh get up there just in the presence
[32:42] of God every once in a while when you
[32:43] get it you say oh if I could just stay
[32:45] here
[32:46] we were talking about the other day
[32:48] we're sitting around some brothers you
[32:49] know how we like to take when we get
[32:51] around table like to take those things
[32:52] and say and talk about them say now what
[32:54] now what sit and somebody said oh if I
[32:56] could just be more like God oh I want to
[32:57] be so more like God well if I would ask
[33:00] you you probably all would say yeah
[33:01] that's me
[33:02] I know I want to be more like God but
[33:05] you know you can only have so much of
[33:06] God in this body
[33:10] when Jesus was here
[33:12] him being the fullness of the godhead
[33:14] bodily
[33:15] do you know he didn't desire anything on
[33:17] this Earth
[33:19] except his elected seat
[33:21] he didn't care what house he lived in
[33:24] a car to drive you walked
[33:27] you just wore plain clothes
[33:30] didn't need anything
[33:32] because he was God of all
[33:34] but see we hear our and and we're giving
[33:37] this body to to live in and I said we
[33:40] got to talk about that we've been to
[33:41] take some of the quotes that brother bam
[33:42] says about and said you know what we'd
[33:44] be no good if you'd be so full of God
[33:45] then you'd be no earthly good
[33:48] I know and I know it sounds but remember
[33:51] you are a part of God by the will of God
[33:53] in the way that God designed it
[33:56] Paul said now nobody can get brother bam
[33:59] says nobody can get above what Paul was
[34:01] and Paul said
[34:03] every time I want to do good Evil's
[34:05] presence
[34:06] the things I do I don't even want to do
[34:08] them
[34:10] the things I think sometimes I don't
[34:12] even think them
[34:14] but we have a covenant God said
[34:18] I'll not leave I'll not leave you
[34:20] but you're always been mine
[34:23] and you know we know now by Revelation
[34:25] what say oh will you stick well one day
[34:27] I got eternal life no if you have
[34:29] eternal life tonight you've always been
[34:30] a part of God
[34:31] before there was a foundational world
[34:33] and now you're the manifested word of
[34:35] God for this hour you're the flesh male
[34:37] that God has settled in he's taken
[34:40] possession of this he's made us like he
[34:42] said right here he has made us in this
[34:45] scripture we went to the end there see
[34:47] that he's come in and builds a
[34:51] habitation of God through the spirit
[34:54] that's what God's doing that's the
[34:55] reason why he that's why he hated
[34:57] denominationalism that's why the prophet
[34:59] stood over said that's the curse of
[35:00] curse of Satan is denominationalism it
[35:03] won't let the people won't let them get
[35:05] out of the way so God can inhabit them
[35:07] their Church stands in the way their
[35:09] religion stands in the way their
[35:11] personality stands in a way but in a
[35:13] predestinated seed one and here's the
[35:14] word of God there's something inside
[35:15] that quickens to the word and says amen
[35:18] be it unto me according to your word
[35:20] oh I love that I know it's the truth I
[35:22] Live Now 80 years and I know it's get it
[35:25] just gets better and better
[35:27] it doesn't get worse or worse it gets
[35:28] better and better
[35:30] now you think you'll love your wife
[35:31] tonight right now and you're sweetheart
[35:32] you're sitting there I say oh I can have
[35:34] to wait to marry her yeah wait till you
[35:36] lived with her 60 years
[35:39] you know what I can't even I can't do
[35:41] without her
[35:43] I I'll be I'll be real honest you know
[35:46] brother Brian said one time a fellow
[35:47] told them they were talking and you know
[35:49] the prophet would tell us
[35:51] I like that a prophet he told us what he
[35:53] really was in his heart
[35:56] and he said a fella come to him one day
[35:58] he said you know what they were just
[35:59] married and said I really love my wife
[36:01] said but said but if she would leave me
[36:03] said I'd probably I could maybe love
[36:04] again
[36:05] he said then after about five years said
[36:07] I don't know but get a little harder
[36:08] they got to be 20 years said you know
[36:10] what I I don't know I said get about 50
[36:13] years
[36:14] he said I can't even think those
[36:15] thoughts
[36:17] I couldn't get along without her
[36:19] that's the way I feel with the Lord you
[36:21] know what at the beginning when you
[36:23] serve the Lord some of you were young
[36:24] like like I was too and and you know
[36:26] everything was there but you know it
[36:28] wasn't as important it didn't seem as
[36:30] important but the further you walk with
[36:32] the Lord the more precious it becomes
[36:34] the more real it becomes that that the
[36:36] one thing you realize when you're born
[36:38] of the spirit of God that the desire of
[36:40] sin is gone
[36:42] that is the most glorious reality
[36:43] brother Brown said that's the one thing
[36:45] the scripture tells us that if a man and
[36:47] a woman that's born of the spirit of God
[36:49] they do not desire to sin they do not
[36:52] desire to disbelieve God's word they cry
[36:54] daily Lord let me believe every word
[36:56] don't let me even question it no matter
[36:58] how it looks what it looks like it looks
[36:59] totally impossible just let me just say
[37:01] what God Said for remember
[37:05] we are taught
[37:08] to speak God's language
[37:11] we were talking about that the other day
[37:12] too and you know the prophet said
[37:16] when you know Christian begins to say
[37:17] well I'm not a very good Christian well
[37:20] I I make so many steaks and I I My Flesh
[37:23] still it's I'm not very Christian said
[37:24] that's the devil's language
[37:27] never confess that you're not a good
[37:29] Christian
[37:30] confess that you make mistakes confess
[37:32] that you get your battle that you got
[37:34] trouble Paul said I fight then I Die
[37:36] daily
[37:37] brother bam said all my life he said I
[37:39] fight daily
[37:41] we are Overcomers
[37:43] by the grace of God what if there's
[37:45] nothing to overcome with just the wind
[37:46] would blow us any which way
[37:49] I like a real you know sometimes you
[37:50] have one of the hardest battles you go
[37:52] through and you think I don't know if
[37:53] I'll make this what and about the time
[37:55] you get out of it here comes the Lord
[37:56] said see
[37:58] now you're going to be more careful next
[38:00] time
[38:01] yeah you get a little more you get a
[38:04] little more careful sometimes we get a
[38:05] little careless but see in there
[38:13] Hebrews says
[38:15] concerning the age
[38:18] I like it how the the prophets and all
[38:20] them they they saw that we were that we
[38:23] weren't just starting in the race
[38:25] and I remember when we first came and I
[38:27] came into this message back in well I
[38:30] was in brother Brown's meetings in 1965
[38:34] when brother Brown preached the
[38:35] marriages divorce series
[38:37] and uh I had been in brother Brown's
[38:40] meetings uh in 1957 when he was in
[38:43] Saskatoon and it was a place if you ever
[38:45] listen to those tapes is where brother
[38:47] Brown talks about the first poll the
[38:49] second poll and uh when it came to
[38:52] Saskatoon
[38:54] it happened in Regina the night before
[38:56] and he said I came the first person that
[38:59] came in the prayer line I think he
[39:00] described her where she's wearing a
[39:02] brown suit or something like that he
[39:04] said and before I could ask her or or
[39:06] take a hold of her hand instead of
[39:08] vision broke
[39:09] and I saw her name
[39:11] and he went through the prayer line and
[39:14] had the whole Services when he come back
[39:16] to when it came to Saskatoon he makes
[39:18] mention of it
[39:20] he said I went to the window and looked
[39:22] outside and I saw the vision that I saw
[39:23] years ago
[39:25] there was that there was that window on
[39:27] the on a river running by and it had
[39:29] some five Bridges or something like that
[39:31] and he said well you can listen to
[39:33] yourself and said the second pull is on
[39:37] but when we when we first
[39:39] when we first came to the light of the
[39:40] semester it was 1957 my my uh if you all
[39:44] of you I could tell your story as well
[39:47] as mine you know how it is we we all
[39:49] have a beginning
[39:50] and we all go through a growth to get
[39:53] out and in our little place was that way
[39:55] we had come through
[39:56] our parents had come through different
[39:59] religions like you all have we were a
[40:01] Mennonite background my great
[40:03] grandfather was a Aston Mennonite you
[40:05] know the word of the black poles and and
[40:07] they didn't believe in music and uh no
[40:10] singers in church were just men singers
[40:13] and and just the old religion deal forms
[40:16] well in 1942 my my dad uh that was the
[40:21] year I was born in 1942 and my dad
[40:22] became a Christian
[40:24] he had an experience something happened
[40:26] and the Lord healed him
[40:28] and uh the Lord healed him before he got
[40:30] saved
[40:32] and when he when he when he when the
[40:34] Lord Heal him had a he had a bad leg it
[40:36] had broken and and uh it was it wasn't
[40:38] healing and they didn't believe in going
[40:39] to doctors so an old columnist midnight
[40:42] preacher came over one night to visit
[40:43] him and had I said I I something said I
[40:46] felt something and I listened to this he
[40:47] said I know we're not we're forbidden to
[40:49] say this he said but uh you I I believe
[40:53] you'll believe me said you believe in
[40:55] praying for the sick and dad said I
[40:57] don't know but he said I'm sick and I'd
[40:58] like to be healed
[41:02] he said that's what I that's what I
[41:03] wanted to talk to you about you know
[41:05] Mark 16 he read and he read mark 16.
[41:08] basically hands on the sick and they
[41:10] shall recover he said now we're forbid
[41:12] to do this but I felt to come and talk
[41:14] to you about and dad said I want you to
[41:16] pray for me
[41:18] so the old congressman is he laid his
[41:20] hands on my dad prayed for him
[41:22] and his leg was twice the size
[41:25] that was just swollen and it was in
[41:27] springtime when he should be out there
[41:28] seating
[41:30] and
[41:32] so when the minister bit of goodbye he
[41:35] they went on home uh my uh
[41:39] my dad said uh to Mom said just get some
[41:42] compost and uh you know the uh bathe it
[41:45] a little bit with something one of the
[41:46] what they had the methods back in those
[41:47] days and and Mom said well if God is the
[41:50] Healer
[41:52] can now take care of the swelling
[41:54] and dad said sure you all right
[41:57] and he fell asleep he said he hadn't
[41:59] slept for more than about two hours for
[42:01] for a long time said he slept for six
[42:02] hours
[42:03] see when I woke up I looked down on my
[42:06] leg instead of a shriveled like the
[42:07] other one but it was all skin was all
[42:09] shriveled
[42:10] is it the swelling was completely down
[42:11] that was the beginning of my dad's
[42:13] experience with the Lord shortly after
[42:15] that somebody led him to Christ and was
[42:17] baptized in those days of course in the
[42:19] titles later on I had the privilege of
[42:21] seeing him baptized being rebapped by
[42:22] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but in
[42:24] 1957 when there was a bunch of they had
[42:27] been kicked out of the church and the
[42:28] latter rain movement was in our area and
[42:30] and they got kicked out of there and
[42:32] they got kicked out of the Pentecostal
[42:33] and you know sometimes the things that
[42:35] look so odd so strange but God's in it
[42:40] breaking the church and so on no look it
[42:42] isn't breaking churches it's calling
[42:45] them out
[42:46] sometimes and in the Pentecostal Church
[42:48] there they've gone so far to where they
[42:50] just wanted to form
[42:53] and there was a back and if any well
[42:56] some of you were my age so you know what
[42:58] in the 50s there was a move of God on
[43:01] the radio everywhere there was Divine
[43:03] Healing going on
[43:04] and uh you know I remember we picked up
[43:06] Waterloo Iowa and Dallas Texas and back
[43:08] in Saskatchewan you know where you'd
[43:10] wind it in in the evening get it you
[43:12] know with this preachers preaching
[43:13] healing Divine Healing and so it got in
[43:16] the local church there was a small
[43:18] country church maybe about 75 people in
[43:20] there and uh and a move went through
[43:23] there I was just a young boy then and we
[43:25] went through there and some people
[43:26] desired for more of God
[43:28] one day the pastor got up and he was a
[43:30] little frustrated because you know we
[43:32] pastors getting hurt sometimes but he
[43:34] was a little frustrated about the
[43:36] contention that was coming over this new
[43:38] light he called it
[43:40] and uh
[43:41] so uh is that Sunday morning I guess he
[43:44] must have acted on his own he said now
[43:45] how many is for that new light
[43:47] and uh so he said stand up so there's
[43:51] about maybe a third of the people got up
[43:54] and he looked around and he said well
[43:56] you can consider yourself dismissed
[43:59] and uh you know now you know that
[44:03] doesn't feel very good
[44:05] and uh my dad well I we were I was there
[44:09] just a little boy but I you know I
[44:10] didn't know what was going on
[44:12] I was 10 years old
[44:14] we walked outside and
[44:16] you know going down the stairs and stood
[44:18] there at the at the bottom of the
[44:19] stairway and uh everybody was real
[44:22] morbid women were crying and and uh so
[44:25] that was the church that they'd built
[44:28] and one of my uncles he had his hat and
[44:31] he hadn't put it on yet
[44:33] and he looked at him said what are you
[44:35] all so sad about
[44:37] and he's through his hat and he said
[44:38] whoopee he said I'm set free
[44:41] broke the whole atmosphere
[44:44] yeah that's right that's right that's
[44:46] what we've been praying for you know
[44:48] sometimes you act that way and it was
[44:50] exactly that time they got in with
[44:51] ladder rain for about three years and
[44:53] they saw the same Folly the old brothers
[44:55] says I saw it rise and fall I said it
[44:57] wasn't of God they won 12 Apostles they
[44:59] want brother Brown to be their their
[45:00] prophet and we lived right there 100
[45:02] miles away all right my I was a young
[45:05] teenage boy going to be being with all
[45:07] the young people and uh
[45:09] foreign
[45:12] came to Saskatoon
[45:14] those ministers got up and they told our
[45:17] people my dad and my uncles and so on
[45:19] said now when when when brother Brown's
[45:21] coming to Saskatoon William Brown's come
[45:23] to saskatchew and said but don't go here
[45:24] and said he he's got strange Doctrine
[45:26] it's very strange
[45:28] and uh so he's well there again
[45:32] and my dad and my uncle and my brother
[45:35] Gunther was the three and I remember
[45:36] them talking over we just didn't know
[45:38] what he was talking about they said
[45:40] nobody tells us where we can go
[45:43] we're gonna go hear him
[45:47] so they went to the meeting I went
[45:50] and by the time this was on by now I was
[45:52] 15. and we went we went to the meetings
[45:55] and I've heard later that all the
[45:59] ministers sitting on the front row
[46:02] they knew brother Brown was a prophet
[46:05] but they wanted to use that gift so it
[46:07] say like it came from them and then give
[46:08] it to the people you know how that is
[46:10] they wouldn't just let him say truly is
[46:12] a man of God
[46:15] and when I when my dad saw that it
[46:18] struck him all of them and struck real
[46:20] hard and the Holy Spirit moved on him
[46:22] and said order the tapes of brother
[46:24] Branham before you leave go to the
[46:27] person in order said you wanted want the
[46:29] messages in order to take and I'd say
[46:30] this from that time
[46:32] as brother Brown preaches from that time
[46:34] the message came to our house
[46:37] I was 15 years old and brother my dad
[46:39] started reading brother Bam's messages
[46:41] that were there you know the prophet
[46:42] visits South Africa and some of them
[46:44] that were Orient print
[46:46] and uh I remember sitting there and dad
[46:49] would read a little while and then break
[46:51] into tears and say he said this reads
[46:54] just like the Bible
[46:57] and it was the beginning it was the
[46:59] beginning
[47:01] but it started a Revival in that little
[47:03] area until well over 300 people were
[47:06] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:08] Christ within 10-year period after that
[47:10] just they began to hear and when the
[47:12] message started taking hold in our place
[47:15] it just started growing
[47:18] and of all the areas now just say this
[47:20] humbly
[47:22] you know sometimes you wonder why I
[47:24] looked at Lima
[47:27] I said so many Believers in the area
[47:29] must be some blessedness you know and oh
[47:32] we don't all see everything I drive but
[47:34] I don't need Shi I die with my wife
[47:36] after 60 years
[47:38] but I love her just the same and she
[47:40] sees it a lot less like me and uh but we
[47:43] we get along just fine
[47:46] we're not like you go to your church and
[47:49] I'll go to mine
[47:50] no there is only one church that's born
[47:54] into it
[47:55] you're not born in because you go to
[47:57] this Tabernacle here you support it with
[47:59] all your heart and I I would say this I
[48:00] humbly believe that you believe this is
[48:02] the most Spiritual Church there is in
[48:03] Lima
[48:06] well you shouldn't be here then if you
[48:07] if you didn't think that
[48:09] brother Brian said it was a more
[48:10] spiritual church to find yourself the
[48:11] most spiritual church so then go there
[48:14] support it and then don't speak bad at
[48:16] the other ones pray for them I'm a
[48:19] little charismatic that way you don't
[48:21] have to be you don't have to go to all
[48:23] throughout my church I've asked where
[48:24] people said uh brother mantle I uh we're
[48:27] we're leaving I said oh is there
[48:29] something wrong
[48:30] no we just feel that that other brother
[48:32] uh can feed my soul more I said God
[48:34] bless you
[48:35] if I have been able to lead you this far
[48:37] and someone could lead you further
[48:39] praise be to God as long as we get there
[48:42] as long as we get there we're not trying
[48:44] to just get them to the church we're
[48:45] trying to get them to Christ
[48:46] getting born again then go wherever they
[48:49] want to
[48:50] the discernment is on the inside because
[48:52] remember this is the dwelling place that
[48:53] God has
[48:54] he dwells in Tabernacles living
[48:56] Tabernacles he makes the decisions in
[48:59] you
[49:00] in your life
[49:03] I've seen the holy spirit so mightily
[49:05] what looks so wrong sometimes
[49:07] but he'll use it in a way that that the
[49:11] karma mine can never never understand
[49:15] you know and sometimes we get a little
[49:17] bit too comfortable in this world
[49:18] so God just shakes a little bit sends a
[49:20] little Sickness by
[49:22] said something that you can't maybe your
[49:25] children get a little wayward
[49:27] well I'll tell you one thing you know
[49:29] one time brother Bob they asked brother
[49:30] you've heard him say that to something
[49:31] they talked about about certain things
[49:33] they went through he said did you did it
[49:35] make you pray more I said yes well he
[49:37] said that's exactly what the Lord wanted
[49:40] just a little bit more
[49:42] of us
[49:44] the more that he can walk in and talk in
[49:48] see
[49:50] God knows the end from the beginning
[49:55] he knows how we are motivated and led
[49:58] and I've seen many times things that
[50:01] look so wrong
[50:02] you know I make a little confession here
[50:05] when I was in Lima and you know this is
[50:09] not this is off the Record so you don't
[50:12] have to you can shut the tapes off
[50:16] but when I moved here to Lima it was
[50:19] because when God called me to preach I
[50:22] don't know how many ministers in here
[50:26] oh yeah well Brothers you know when
[50:29] you're an evangelist and you go to
[50:31] churches that don't have a pastor what's
[50:32] the first thing they ask you
[50:34] could you come and pastor this church
[50:36] could you come and I got it all the time
[50:39] when I first started preaching Back in
[50:41] 1970 I went to just household as no
[50:45] there was no big churches we had we had
[50:48] probably uh back in those years we were
[50:50] probably 20 30 40 people in a little
[50:52] country church but brother Bissell
[50:56] we're still meeting in his house I
[50:59] preached for brother biscal in his house
[51:00] in the living room
[51:02] just a little storehouses like little
[51:04] places
[51:05] but the one thing we did have at that
[51:07] time to the ones that had come out
[51:10] we all could play in the same sandbox
[51:12] yeah we just didn't matter you believe
[51:15] the message amen you're my brother
[51:18] see then later on we get to moving along
[51:20] the more we get to know more about it
[51:22] and uh but when I moved to Lima here and
[51:25] it was some of the one is one of those
[51:27] things but I'll let you know sometimes
[51:29] not all the things we make decisions on
[51:32] always work for the glory of God
[51:34] sometimes it may work for our Glory they
[51:36] work against us and when I moved here I
[51:38] told Brother Tom Brown I said the Lord
[51:41] gave me permission I I said I prayed and
[51:44] I prayed and uh and one day I I was
[51:47] praying and something said why don't you
[51:49] go down for a year
[51:51] of course those of you that might not
[51:53] know this but there was a couple other
[51:54] brothers that were there that were
[51:56] ministers and in my heart I felt that
[51:58] that by going to help the church I could
[52:01] help them set up to the place to where
[52:03] they'd have a minister that would stay
[52:05] there because so when I called her the
[52:07] time I said I the Lord told me to come
[52:09] down for a year
[52:10] and how do you feel about that he said
[52:11] that'll be good and maybe that's the
[52:14] will of the Lord so I did and when I
[52:16] came down and we stayed for a year and I
[52:18] I tell you I felt good I said home the
[52:20] Lord is good then a year and a half went
[52:21] by and I was still feeling good but
[52:23] thank you Lord nothing said then one day
[52:25] one morning I walked out and prayed and
[52:29] just as sure as he told me to come here
[52:30] he said it's time to move back
[52:33] and let me tell you something moving
[52:34] back I was moving right back into a
[52:37] hornet's nest that was one of the
[52:39] biggest Strife there was in that church
[52:40] by adding another preacher to the ones
[52:42] that were there uh was not going to work
[52:45] good and it didn't
[52:48] so much so that you know it didn't work
[52:50] out
[52:51] but in there when you look back now
[52:55] when you look back on the things the
[52:58] things that look so wrong at that time
[53:01] but I know for a fact when the you know
[53:03] my brother remember one time brother
[53:05] Bram talks about the tax case and uh how
[53:08] that for five years
[53:10] he was he felt like he was trapped he
[53:12] said felt like I'd taken candy from a
[53:14] baby he said I I confessed it I'd go
[53:16] make things right and he said I just
[53:18] couldn't shake it said and then one day
[53:19] when he gets delivered from it he
[53:21] actually makes note of it and he says I
[53:23] haven't read it for a while but but he
[53:25] stops and he says just think of it for
[53:27] five years said media look at that for
[53:28] five years
[53:30] I've had this on my shoulders just
[53:33] couldn't shake it
[53:35] he said but it's gone
[53:36] the Lord Has Lifted us
[53:39] and I was that way I was I was I was
[53:41] that way and for five years and and I
[53:44] have to say this Lionel was a part of
[53:45] the loop
[53:47] maybe that's why it means more to me
[53:49] than maybe it's just
[53:51] maybe to you
[53:53] but to me it was my place where God
[53:55] trained me where God taught me that if
[53:58] he says to do something
[54:01] like he told the prophet
[54:03] you remember how he suffered for not
[54:06] going when the Lord told him to go
[54:09] you know what he said as long as even
[54:11] 1965.
[54:14] I heard him the other day
[54:15] he said as soon as I dropped back in the
[54:17] valley of Ohio Valley come down there in
[54:19] Jeffersonville said my throat starts
[54:21] clogging up he said I get he said
[54:24] I think he still holds it against me
[54:25] that I didn't go
[54:27] and it makes a statement like that he
[54:29] was a man
[54:31] but he knew that he'd made a vital
[54:34] mistake
[54:35] sometimes you pay for them
[54:38] and I could just say this as confession
[54:40] or as a testimony don't worry sometimes
[54:43] God will lead you but as I went through
[54:46] that Loop and I didn't know I was going
[54:47] I didn't know where I was going when I
[54:48] went back there I thought I'd go back in
[54:50] Evangelistic field but something didn't
[54:51] work
[54:52] didn't work at home
[54:55] but see the Lord had told me and dealt
[54:57] with me that I was supposed to start a
[54:59] church in Saskatoon before any of this
[55:01] started
[55:03] and when I went to the pastor to you
[55:06] know like sometimes ministers and I
[55:08] wanted them so I've got to I've got as
[55:11] many parts as anybody's got
[55:12] and not all good
[55:15] and sometimes I can be pretty it can't
[55:17] be so nice just ask the people that's
[55:18] around me
[55:19] so
[55:23] when I made that decision
[55:26] and followed I the Lord told me I was
[55:30] supposed to do that in the past and said
[55:31] if you do that I quit my my service and
[55:33] God bless his heart he's already passed
[55:35] on the other side he he died in the
[55:37] rejoice in the Lord he's nothing wrong
[55:39] with him it's just it was the Lord
[55:40] testing me
[55:44] I'll say this in in as a as a testimony
[55:47] when when I finally got around to it
[55:51] I was sitting there one day now we
[55:53] started the church we'd been put out of
[55:54] the local church there because of this
[55:57] message
[55:58] because of the doctrine that they you
[56:00] know sometimes people want to force you
[56:02] to leave a certain Doctrine
[56:04] well I've always said this if God
[56:06] doesn't reveal it to me and if I don't
[56:08] get it from the message in the messenger
[56:11] I don't want to hear somebody else so he
[56:12] said this or hear it said that no we've
[56:14] got tape recorders that's why the and
[56:16] I'm a little bit legal on this I know of
[56:19] one person that God told to make a
[56:22] recording of his messages
[56:24] he never told me to record my sermons
[56:27] but I told him to record his sermons
[56:30] he said there'll be a Time come when
[56:32] they will need it now how many degrees
[56:34] is that this is the time
[56:36] when so many doctrines were on this
[56:38] message Time After Time and I've said
[56:40] many times looks right looks look
[56:42] screwed looks good but unless the Lord
[56:43] reveals it to me and remember it never
[56:46] can get outside of the scripture
[56:48] that's not wrong saying what kept me but
[56:50] your understanding has to be at least
[56:52] scriptural
[56:53] absolutely
[56:55] sometimes we might you might sound a
[56:57] certain way but then search back see if
[56:59] the prophet said he took it back to the
[57:01] scripture and showed us where it was
[57:04] so take God in his word and when we were
[57:06] when when that when all it was and then
[57:08] when we got put out of the church I
[57:10] waited on the Lord and one day he said
[57:13] the time is now April 17th
[57:16] 1984.
[57:19] I went and Rental a building and I
[57:21] started Services started pastoring first
[57:23] services that we had was about 75 85
[57:25] people out
[57:28] was about a week later when I was
[57:30] sitting in my chair and looking at
[57:33] reading the Bible and reading a message
[57:35] and I was reading where brother bam said
[57:37] this five years and I stopped
[57:41] and I counted
[57:43] April of 79 when we moved to Lima here
[57:47] April of 84 five years
[57:50] I say this humbly and the Lord hears me
[57:53] await left my shoulders
[57:56] and at peace came over me and I've never
[57:58] doubted that God called me to be the
[58:00] pastor there in Saskatoon 35 years later
[58:03] not one time
[58:05] did I question whether it's out of the
[58:07] will of God or in the will of God
[58:09] but sometimes the way to get there gets
[58:12] a little muddy
[58:13] you all are that way you've got
[58:15] different things brother bam had so many
[58:17] of those things we all have them but all
[58:20] the time I noticed one thing the Holy
[58:22] Spirit never left me
[58:24] he kept encouraging me along certain
[58:26] areas then one of the brothers came
[58:27] later on said brother how did you manage
[58:30] to keep how did you how did you do and
[58:33] all those things the doctrines and and
[58:34] they were just pushing on you real hard
[58:36] I said the one thing I did
[58:38] I prayed the Lord would never let a
[58:40] bitterness get in my soul I said
[58:43] whatever it takes Lord whatever it takes
[58:45] don't ever let me get bitter I can
[58:47] disagree with the person I believe we
[58:49] ought to be able to just bitterly
[58:51] disagree
[58:52] and still have the right attitude toward
[58:54] the person because remember it's a soul
[58:58] we're not just down on people because
[59:00] they differ and I've seen some people
[59:02] get real ugly and and mean with it God
[59:05] doesn't deal with his children that way
[59:06] he's not mean
[59:08] he said come follow me
[59:11] whosoever will you know brother Brian
[59:13] says I'm glad he didn't say William
[59:14] Branham you see because there's more
[59:16] William random than what he said but
[59:18] whosoever will let him come and drink of
[59:20] the Waters of Life freely I'm I'm I
[59:22] understand it's by the choice the
[59:25] election of God
[59:27] we understand clearly now that we come
[59:30] from God and we're going back to God now
[59:32] we understand why our lord Jesus one is
[59:34] here of course he bypassed the
[59:36] temptation of the flesh
[59:39] but we didn't we come to be tempted
[59:41] first then go back to our Theo offering
[59:44] pick up and when those two when you
[59:45] cross over you know her brother bam says
[59:47] over here said when you hear half of
[59:48] it's over here when when God came over
[59:50] here and took the place of a man
[59:52] he did so he could draw a man back to
[59:54] the place of God
[59:56] we just read it here
[59:58] and that's where we're going when this
[1:00:00] is over said someday he said either
[1:00:02] death or the Rapture will take you to
[1:00:03] the place where you get the other half
[1:00:05] then you'll worship like you really
[1:00:07] wanted to worship then we'll live like
[1:00:08] we really want to live then you'll think
[1:00:10] like you wanted to think then you'll be
[1:00:12] what you really want to be but here
[1:00:14] right now you'll never be what you
[1:00:15] really want to be
[1:00:17] that's not don't look down on that say
[1:00:20] thank you Lord as long as I'm here I
[1:00:22] need a savior I need a Healer I need a
[1:00:24] guide I need a shepherd
[1:00:26] I need him to guide me I need to pray
[1:00:28] daily
[1:00:30] that's it I need to read you know Bill
[1:00:32] Graham said read your Bible pray daily
[1:00:34] say well you know there's not a message
[1:00:36] tape that I haven't heard over and over
[1:00:38] and over again especially since 63 on
[1:00:40] after the mystery of God I went through
[1:00:43] those those are my real now real meat
[1:00:46] strong meat but oh it sets the person
[1:00:49] down
[1:00:50] you're not wanting to and fro after
[1:00:52] Doctrine after that but see what looks
[1:00:54] so wrong but someone I just shared that
[1:00:55] with you just I hope you understand what
[1:00:57] I'm saying is that God does that and I
[1:01:00] felt I felt I I you're you're in your
[1:01:03] life you have how many has ever had the
[1:01:05] little place where you figured yes you
[1:01:07] couldn't go any further
[1:01:09] I had it then when I left Lima here the
[1:01:11] second time
[1:01:13] my wife knows she said
[1:01:15] she she realized that I've never been so
[1:01:18] low in my life
[1:01:19] I kind of felt like brother bam didn't
[1:01:21] climbed the power poor grab a hold the
[1:01:23] wire
[1:01:24] I felt like taking my life I was so I
[1:01:28] was so low
[1:01:30] God had to bring me to that place
[1:01:32] to where later on when I was challenged
[1:01:36] and then you know what it doesn't feel
[1:01:38] good when you're challenged
[1:01:40] that if you don't believe it this way
[1:01:41] you don't do this thing you don't do
[1:01:42] this don't do this you're out
[1:01:46] now those weren't my enemies they were
[1:01:48] my closest friends
[1:01:50] but it's that time then you recognized
[1:01:53] where you stand in Christ then you
[1:01:55] realize it's not you it's Christ and you
[1:01:57] that holds the anchor
[1:01:59] and I like what brother Brown said it's
[1:02:01] not you holding on me holding on it's
[1:02:03] him holding on
[1:02:05] I know I know we sing hold on Lord I'm
[1:02:07] holding on Lord I'm holding on not
[1:02:09] really
[1:02:11] we just go through the motions
[1:02:14] sometimes say oh Lord I'm gonna lay a
[1:02:16] hold of you yeah that's good but
[1:02:19] really he does the holy
[1:02:21] he does the drawing
[1:02:23] it does the convicting
[1:02:25] he leads you guides you through the
[1:02:27] Still Water sometimes through what
[1:02:28] Troubled Waters
[1:02:30] but by the grace of God here I stand a
[1:02:32] man an old man now I was young once and
[1:02:34] now I'm old I've seen I've never I said
[1:02:36] like David I've never seen the righteous
[1:02:37] forsaken nor his seed begging bread
[1:02:40] I told the Lord when he called me to
[1:02:42] preach I said Lord you take care of my
[1:02:44] finances you feed my family I'll preach
[1:02:48] we never did go hungry
[1:02:51] now the
[1:02:53] the Wolves had to pack their own picnic
[1:02:54] lunch that's true
[1:02:56] but they were all around us
[1:02:58] we got pretty sparse many times
[1:03:02] but that's also making up the body
[1:03:05] now I look at Lima here and I looked at
[1:03:07] later on when we left I seen how the
[1:03:09] Lord raised up other men and everyone
[1:03:11] and never despise the ones that God
[1:03:12] raises up sometimes they go the wrong
[1:03:14] way sometimes some misses the mark
[1:03:16] not all bad people
[1:03:19] but it's missing the mark
[1:03:21] and the prophet taught us very plain he
[1:03:22] said when you miss them I come back and
[1:03:24] said it or adjust it and shoot again
[1:03:27] I missed the market many Good Times
[1:03:31] but I don't regret them I'll have
[1:03:32] traveled for the Lord
[1:03:34] I don't regret the times I've trusted in
[1:03:36] his word I've seen the years go by many
[1:03:39] days without a song
[1:03:42] but I like singing But even I many days
[1:03:45] without a song gotta Grumble a little
[1:03:47] bit gotta complain a little bit
[1:03:50] but he doesn't like complainers you know
[1:03:52] that
[1:03:52] God I I was reading apart I won't read
[1:03:56] the quote I had someone but I just don't
[1:03:57] feel led to do it tonight but I but I
[1:03:59] just bear my heart before you I realize
[1:04:01] that that you know brother bam says
[1:04:03] simple things
[1:04:06] we were talking about God's language
[1:04:07] when we were in Tucson brother a bunch
[1:04:09] of us brothers were sitting around the
[1:04:10] table and talking about God's language
[1:04:12] and one of the brothers had been
[1:04:13] preaching on the language of God how
[1:04:15] that we speak our own language you know
[1:04:16] that
[1:04:17] nobody speaks like you
[1:04:20] what church could you go to talk about
[1:04:22] the seven Church ages
[1:04:23] where could you talk about the Seven
[1:04:25] Seals the mystery of Christ revealed
[1:04:26] where could you go and said that first
[1:04:27] sector where would you go and talk about
[1:04:29] the messengers that got raised up and
[1:04:31] not was not written in the Bible at all
[1:04:34] and now they're identified we're clearly
[1:04:36] identified back through history
[1:04:37] we got our own language
[1:04:41] we talk different than religions do we
[1:04:44] don't join
[1:04:46] we're born
[1:04:48] we're born into a kingdom
[1:04:51] not just a group of people but born into
[1:04:53] the kingdom of the king is the ruler and
[1:04:56] we are part of them we're born into that
[1:04:58] and and I like the whole brother and
[1:05:00] puts the soul sample said we're not he
[1:05:02] said it was never asked to join the
[1:05:03] Branham family
[1:05:05] right and then amazing how you never you
[1:05:06] can you can sit and discuss anything and
[1:05:09] uh nobody ever asked you to join the
[1:05:10] join the family
[1:05:12] if you have children sitting with their
[1:05:14] children and family not one time you've
[1:05:16] been challenged said if you don't get a
[1:05:17] birth certificate prove that you're part
[1:05:19] of the family you're out
[1:05:22] it's not even our vocabulary
[1:05:24] that's the way it is with this we're not
[1:05:26] thinking well one day I'll be saved no
[1:05:28] now are you safe now are you the sons of
[1:05:30] God you're not going to be down there
[1:05:31] you've always been a part of God
[1:05:35] but you were quickened in this age in
[1:05:37] this day and no other age will will act
[1:05:41] and work for us we're born with the
[1:05:43] spirit to take the challenges of this
[1:05:45] age
[1:05:46] I'm thankful to the grace of the Lord in
[1:05:48] spite of all those things you know you
[1:05:50] you just you just realize that God put
[1:05:52] it together
[1:05:53] none man putting it together
[1:05:56] it's God put it together here's a little
[1:05:58] can I get the music up here a little bit

[1:09:06] born with and that's character
