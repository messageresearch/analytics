TRANSCRIPT
========================================
brother brenaman preaching uh God hiding himself in Simplicity he's now coming to the preaching of the seals but he says I've got to preach this first then when he gets to the seventh seal he refers back to the the first service he preached God hiding he says remember remember God hiding himself in Simplicity why because now brother brandham is coming amen he's coming to the most Sublime scripture in all the Bible Revelation CH 5 when the lamb takes the book and then breaks the seals and he's coming to the breaking of the seals he's coming to the sounding of the seven Thunders that have been sealed up until the time of the end and it's going to take place right there where is it going to take place on the corner of two ordinary streets in an ordinary town in a small City and mid in the midwest USA in nowhere with nobody in a no-name place amen it's called brandom Tabernacle if you've ever been by it it's a simple box of a square building no Cathedral see no high arching spikes no decorative ornamentation just a brick Square on the corner of two side streets and a little city amen a little no-name place in Midwest USA God hiding himself in Simplicity what was taking place there the greatest thing that had happened one of the greatest things that ever happened was taking place in that brick building on the corner of aan pin God hiding himself in Simplicity chosen a chosen Tabernacle but it didn't look like it and who was the vessel he was going to use Amen to preach the seals the sound of Thunders it was going to be a man with a seventh grade education with no no educ no theological education a man who couldn't pronounce all those words a man who started in the ministry would ask his girlfriend to read the scriptures how would you like it if your pastor had to have his girlfriend read the scriptures before he started the service cuz he couldn't pronounce those big words some of you wouldn't go to church there amen was rejected by had no class had no form had no order had no elegant speech had no backing of denomination had no formal education he was simple humble amen a vessel of clay but to me he was a vessel unto honor amen not because of his stature not because of his eloquence not because of his education not because of his power because of who was in him amen and what he was doing he was a vessel unto honor and he didn't do it by education he didn't do it by politics he didn't do it by his great ability to put scripture with scripture he didn't have that ability it was the Holy Ghost who put with scripture with scripture and all he did was come out and say what was told him the Simplicity of just taking God at his word amen believing what he said and coming forth the same as Moses Moses didn't come with anything other than his faith in the word of God
