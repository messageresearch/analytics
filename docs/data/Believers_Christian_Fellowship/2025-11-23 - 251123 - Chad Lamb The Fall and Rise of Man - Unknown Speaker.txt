Oh, in him, in him is the only place for me. I won't go back for anything to where I used to be. The sun is always shining and the victories been won. And I'm walking in the light of that new Jerusalem. Oh, I know that I am nothing to bear the Christian name. For every blunder that I make, I just myself to blame. But glory hallelujah, I don't see them at all. And neither does my savior, for the blood has cleansed them all. In him, in him, he's the only place for me. I won't go back for anything. Where I used to be. The sun is always shining. And the victory's been won. And I'm walking in the light of that new Jerusalem. [Music] Why do you talk of sorrow? For there is none in here.

[Music] Come and fill your name [Music] Jesus. Oh Jesus, [Music] come and drink your Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, God, that you have drawn us together once again. And God, it's a great privilege that we all stand here this morning. For God, no man can come to you unless your father has drawn them. And oh God, we're so thankful that you've drawn us with your drawing power, with your great love. And God, you've brought us here to this service this morning. And God, as we worship you, Lord, we give you glory and honor. We magnify your name for God, you are so worthy. And God, as we look into you, God, we ask that you would come and unveil yourself to us once again. Give us the eyes that we might see and the ears that we might hear. Lord, all that you want to share with us this morning. May you use this vessel of mine for your glory and honor. May you speak eternal words to these lips of clay. God, may we receive your word and may it bring life to us, Lord. May it bring life that becomes a manifestation in this world, a light in darkness that you might be displayed through us. God, we come for this purpose. We come to worship you. We come to feed from you. We come to receive of you. And Lord, that we might be strengthened to go and be what you've called us to be in this life. We ask now that you would take preeminence among us as you take the bread in your hand and break it before us. May our eyes be open and may we behold you, Lord, and see you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. While you're standing, if you would just turn with me to the book of Luke. Just want to mention that yesterday we had Sister Nancy Marorrow's memorial service here and and it went really well. And we appreciate everybody who came, all who were able to attend. Special thank you to all who helped with the service, the musicians and the song leader and the deacons who helped out and everybody who helped with the dinner and helped Sister Mana. It was wonderful. It was a wonderful day and a wonderful time. So, thank you all for that. And just remember the family as they grieve. But we're not grieving for Sister Nancy. We're so happy for her. Amen. So thankful. So I want also want to let you know that next Sunday I'll be gone. and I'll be down in Junction City just south of Columbus there with the group from Junction City. I'll be preaching for them. They're starting to get their church established. They have one of the brothers there who's rose up and began preaching amongst them and they've put him in as an interim pastor and they're exploring uh having him as pastor. And so they we've been in discussion and asked me to come down and minister and maybe maybe talk about how to move forward and those things. So just be praying for that group. They're moving forward. Amen. And it's exciting to see what God's doing for them. So, while I'm there, Brother Gabe Smith will be preaching here. So, remember to keep him in prayer as well. Amen. For the service. Also wanted to say that Bible Believers Christian School had their play Friday night. I know many were there and enjoyed that. I wasn't there, but me and my wife streamed from home. Amen. We found a link somewhere, so we snuck in. Amen. And they did a wonderful job. We saw all of you kids there. You guys did a great job. And uh Sister Vidy wrote the play if I'm not mistaken. And she did an excellent job, too. So, it was it was a lot of fun and we enjoyed seeing it. So God bless all of you. Amen. And so let's take a look now at Luke. Luke 3 verse 38. Luke chapter 3 verse 38. Also want to appreciate brother Jose for sharing the special. God bless you my brother. Amen. We appreciated that. Amen. So many times I forget to mention things like that and I'm so sorry that I do. When I come around back I got my mind focused on one thing and it's hard. I'm a onetrack mind kind of person anyway. So, it's very hard for me to break out of the one track. Amen. I go down a one-way street with big guardrails and high walls. So, please forgive me. But I always appreciate the contribution of the saints. It always adds to the service. And we always appreciate it so much. So, thank you. Amen. In verse 38, it says, "Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God." Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. Amen. I opened with that scripture one time before and we're kind of jumping right in the middle of the thought as they're going through the lineage there of Christ. But but wanted to note that that Adam was the son of God. So if we could bring the PowerPoint up now, I'd like to minister on the fall and rise of man. We know the story of the gospel so well. We know what happened to man in the beginning and how God had established his son upon the earth and given him dominion. And we're going to go through some scriptures. I'm so thankful for the PowerPoint today because there's a lot of scriptures I want to read, but we're going to be able to move quickly through them. So, if you have your pen and paper handy and you want to jot them down, jot them fast cuz I'm going to keep moving. Amen. Uh, this is Genesis 1. We know really well. Says, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. And God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." This was man's commission. When God commissioned man upon the earth, he commissioned him to take dominion. Brother M said, to be God on the earth. He was an amateur God, a son of God, and he was given rulership over the creation. And God would take this man that he had created in his image and he would put him down into flesh to interact with the creation that he was given charge over, given dominion of and given rulership over. And so man was moved in the flesh. And we know, amen, that from him would come his help meet. They'd be united together and there would be a commandment for them to replenish the earth and subdue and bring everything subject and in order. Amen. And then God planted a garden and and the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. Amen. God put him there to work in the garden. Amen. To be the ruler to to set it in order and to guard it, to protect it and to order it. Amen. That was his job. Amen. As God upon the earth. But we know that he fell. Brother Bam says this. When Adam was in the Garden of Eden, when he come to the responsibility to make his choice, would he stay with God or go with his wife, he had to make that the responsibility was up to him. He either had to take what his wife said or what God said. And when he chose to go the way of his wife and when he did that then he lost his original condition and brought the whole world subject to death when he had to take the responsibility or either accepting a new light that his wife had found which was contrary. Oh God think of it. God only give them about eight or 10 words to keep but of the tree thou shalt not eat. That's all they had to keep. And even with that much word they broke it. Then Adam had to face up. Will I will I do as my wife has said do or shall I do what God said do? And he walked out with his eyes opened. He had to take the responsibility that throw the that throwed the whole human race unto death. Amen. That's why we're in the condition we're in now. That's why, Amen. that our bodies deteriorate with age. That's why we had a memorial service yesterday for Sister Nancy. All of that was because Adam made his choice to leave the word. Amen. And we know he did it as a type of Christ going, Amen, to redeem his wife. Amen. But nonetheless, he had to leave the word to do so. And in leaving the word, Amen, he throwed all of us into death. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's the condition we all find ourselves in. And he says here in Genesis 3, "And unto Adam, he said, because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy sake, and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns also, and thistle shalt it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field, and the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return into the ground. For out of it was thou taken, for dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return. Amen. You and I weren't there that day in the form we are now. Let's just say that. &gt;&gt; We weren't there. Amen. We we didn't make the decision that Adam made. And we know that brother Brandham put us all on the same basis. He said, "We're standing before those trees now. We make our choice." But just if you if you'll just uh let me explain it this way. Adam was placed there as the as the first man on earth. He was created of God and placed there and given dominion. Amen. And out of him would come his wife and the two united together was to bring forth the God race. Brother Bam said they would have eventually brought forth Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. They were supposed to bring forth this seed upon the earth. Amen. And and and so Adam was placed there as the head of the family and as the head of the family when he left the word. Amen. Amen. And when he chose to go with his wife, Amen, he threw the entire family into death, into chaos, into ruin. Amen. Because God accounted him the first and God accounted him the head. And when the head fell, everything under him fell. &gt;&gt; Brother Mim says it this way in the breach. Now, of course, when Adam fell to death, he brought death upon all creation, not just man, upon all creation because he was placed as God, ruler over all creation. So everything was under Adam's headship. All the animals, the plant life, all of creation was under Adam's headship. And he was placed as a god to rule over it all. And when Adam fell, everything fell. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to look at a type of this in Joshua. Turn with me to Joshua chapter 7. Many of you know this story really well. We're going to just uh take a quick uh snapshot of the story of Achen. We know that when they went into the promised land and and when they uh crossed the border and went into the promised land, the first place they came against was Jericho. But God said, "The spoil of Jericho is mine. This first one that's destroyed is mine. Take nothing of it." A and but Achen did. And in chapter 7 verse one it says, "But the children of Israel committed a trespass in these thing. For Achen, the son of Kari, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zarah of the tribe of Judah, took of the oursed thing. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel." And we realize that that as they come out from under the blessing of God because they disobeyed the word of God, that 36 men lost their life in the attack of Ai, which was just a a little small city. They turned their backs and they ran away. Amen. And and they were killed. And so Joshua starts to set up a a a a he starts to mourn and he starts to cry out to God. And God says, "Why are you crying out to me? There's sin in the camp." So he starts going through and trying to find where it is. And they bring them order by order, tribe by tribe, family by family. Until finally they land on Achen. And so let's turn to chapter 19 and pick the story up there. And Joshua said unto Achen, "My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, God of Israel, and make confession unto him, and tell me now what thou hast done. Hide it not from me." And Anchen answered Joshua, and said, Indeed, I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done. When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels weight, then I coveted them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it. So Joshua sent messengers and they ran into the tent and behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it. And they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto Joshua and unto the children of Israel and laid them out before the Lord. And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achen the son of Zarah and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had. And they brought them into the valley of Achor. And Joshua said, "Why hast thou troubled us? The Lord shall trouble thee this day." And all Israel stoned them with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones. And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of Acor unto this day. Amen. I wanted to read this story. There's many stories like this in the Bible, but I want to read this story because I want to show a picture of headship. This is how important headship is. Amen. And and it it's so important for all of us who are in headship as fathers or husbands or or whatever place that God's placed us in. There's headship in business. There's headship in schools. There's headship in churches. There headship in families. There's headship all over. But but but everything rises and falls with headship. &gt;&gt; When Adam fell, we all fell. And we're still suffering because of Adam's decision. And now uh Achen is here and he has got the word of the Lord. And the word of the Lord tells him the spoil of Jericho is his. But he's tempted and he lusted after something. And when he saw the goodly Babylonian garment and the silver and the wedge of gold, Amen. he took them and he went and he hid them in his tent. Amen. And and a as he hid them, he didn't realize. But he as the head of his family and the head of his household, Amen. when he got tempted and when he fell into this sin, he was destroying the lives of everything that was under his headship. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why it's so important when we become fathers, when we become husbands, amen, that we pay attention to what we're doing that we don't live frivolously because everything under our headship will be blessed or cursed by our headship. &gt;&gt; That's why it's so important, Amen, to be established in the gospel. Amen. Be filled with the spirit. Have a personal walk with Jesus Christ. Be lined up to his word and subject to his word before you bring anybody else under your headship. No matter what headship that is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they're depending on you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when when they come and they find out what uh Achen had done, he says in verse 24, let's go back to verse 24. And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achen the son of Zarah and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had. &gt;&gt; That's headship. and all that he had. When Achen was cursed, everything under him was cursed. And they took it all and they judged it all. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, God, help us." &gt;&gt; This is a picture also of Eden again repeating itself because the themes of the Bible repeat all through the Bible. Every picture, every drama showing us, Amen, the picture of the fall of man and the redemption of man. And it's going from the beginning to the end of the Bible. And now we realize that everything now has to be judged and put outside of Israel because Israel cannot let this sin remain. They have to go in obedience for the blessing of God to remain amongst them and go on and take the land. Amen. So they judge Achen and they judge everything under Achen because everything under Achen was subject to Achen. And when Achen fell, his entire household fell, his sheep fell. &gt;&gt; What did the sheep do? Nothing. What did his oxen do? Nothing. What did his tent do? Nothing. What does his sons do? Nothing. What did his daughters do? They did nothing. But because they were under his leadership and headship, they fell when he fell. &gt;&gt; Oh God, if there's anything that should make you tremble as a man, as a father, as a husband, as a leader in any position, this should make you tremble and say, "God, I need thee every hour, every moment of the day. I need your leadership in my life. I need your rod of correction to guide me. I need your staff to lead me, God, because the stakes are so high. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is what happened in Eden to us. AMEN. WHEN ADAM FELL, EVERYTHING FELL. AMEN. The the animal LIFE FELL, THE BOTANY LIFE FELL, the order of the univer, the order of the earth fell, we fell. Amen. I wasn't there that day to make that decision. And and I'm not blaming Adam because I've made a whole pile of bad decisions myself. But I wasn't there that day, but what he did that day affects me this day because he was the head of the family. &gt;&gt; Yes. This is the law of God. And this is the way that it works, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the gracious thing in the eyes of God is if it works for evil, it can work for good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can be blessed by a good father, by a good husband. Amen. By by a good savior. Amen. We can be blessed under the right kind of headship. Amen. We fell when our head fell. That's why we need a transfer of headship. Amen. And if we can find a transfer of headship and we can get the headship that's blessed, we're blessed under headship. Amen. &gt;&gt; WE COME INTO THE WORLD CURSED. AMEN. As children that come AFTER ADAM, WE'RE CURSED. AMEN. But by the grace of God, he's provided a way for another headship to come into our lives. &gt;&gt; He says in the third seal, there was nothing lost until Adam. And after Adam, all was lost in the earth. I hope we can see this. The oxen, amen, the asses, the sheep, the everything was lost when Adam was lost. &gt;&gt; And everything on the creation of the earth was lost. And everything fell with Adam. Crossed the chasm that no one could get back. No way at all. Man, when he sinned, he left his way. He left no way back for himself. I mean, this is this is this is so important because of the nature of the fall. man was left with no bridge to cross BACK OVER THE CHASM because Adam, amen, Adam was a clean vessel. His wife was a clean vessel. And those two clean vessels, amen, could bring forth the word of God. But the woman went and polluted herself, amen, by hybridizing herself, amen, in adultery with serpent and receive serpent seed. Now corrupting the very womb, amen, that was perfect. And now, amen, there was no way, amen, to bring forth God's plan BECAUSE THE VERY FLESH OF Eve was corrupted. Amen. And when Adam made his decision to leave the word, even though Adam was pure, Adam went with his wife and corrupted himself with her. And now he in a fallen condition cannot pay the price of redemption because he needs redemption himself. And from then on now, amen, God's moving with a permissive will, allowing children to be born under the permissive will by sex birth. BUT EVERYONE COMES WRONG, HYBRID, COME TO THE WORLD the wrong way. And there's no WAY BACK. WE CANNOT CROSS BACK OVER THAT CHASM BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN EDEN. What happened with serpent seed? &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY SERPENT SEED IS SUCH A VITAL THING TO BE RESTORED IN THE LAST DAY BECAUSE it gives US THE UNDERSTANDING OF EVERYTHING. the basis of the fall, the the reason for redemption and the method of redemption is all based on the understanding of what happened in Eden &gt;&gt; and how Adam fell and why nothing &gt;&gt; nothing could redeem it back. &gt;&gt; So under headship, we were stuck &gt;&gt; out on a limb across the chasm with no way back. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 7 says, "For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin." This word sold means slavery. Sold as a slave. We've been sold into slavery by our father Adam. We come into the world bound in chains of slavery under sin because of the carnality in our lives. &gt;&gt; Romans 8 says, "Because the carnal mind, excuse me, is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." This is the condition we come in with a carnal mind, sold into slavery, sold into sin. We come with the wrong spirit. We come with the with the wrong flesh. We come all mixed up into this world. Amen. And our mind, our carnal mind is enmity, an enemy, hateful against God, for it is not subject to the law of God. Neither indeed can it be. Oh, we're in bad shape. How many believes we're in bad shape? &gt;&gt; Amen. Before we can get in good shape, we got to realize we're in bad shape. Amen. And that's for every one of those children that's born here to godly parents and raised in the church and raised in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Before you can ever find your way up, you've got to realize you're pretty low. Amen. It doesn't matter how you were raised and what you were protected from. And if you were born, Amen, to godly parents who believe the truth of God's word and lived consecrated, holy lives, amen, you're blessed under that kind of headship. But don't forget, YOU STILL COME from the lineage of Adam and your natural birth. and you're still doomed and you're across a chasm with no way back in and of yourself. And you're born with a carnal mind that's enmity against God. And it doesn't matter how much education you get. You've got to have something more than that. There's got to be SOMETHING THAT'LL CROSS YOU BACK OVER THAT chasm of separation from God. And it can't be just being raised in the RIGHT PLACE. YOU'VE GOT TO FALL before you can rise. And you've got to know you're fallen before you can you got TO KNOW YOU'RE LOST before you're saved. You got to know you're fallen before you're raised. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; So, every one of us come into the world, no matter what household we come into, no matter what truth we're surrounded from, we're born wrong with wrong desires, struggling with the lust of the flesh. Amen. Struggling to overcome, amen, the carnal nature that we were sold into sin &gt;&gt; by our parent Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; And so, we must realize this. That's why it's so good to go through the teenage years and struggle with lust and wrong thoughts and WRONG IDEAS AND BATTLE AGAINST your own flesh and hate the very flesh you're in and tell a few lies and hide some things from your parents and get ashamed of yourself. You need to be utterly ashamed of yourself. You need to realize how bad off you are. No matter how many good THINGS I'VE HEARD, I CAN'T GET IT RIGHT. I KEEP FALLING FOR THE wrong thing and thinking the wrong thing and acting out the WRONG THING. YOU'VE GOT TO BE THERE FIRST SO you could work your way up. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to realize we're lost when Adam was lost and I'm born lost and I'm born in need and I'm born desperate &gt;&gt; for some other headship cuz the headship I'm born under failed. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the headship of Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, we know that this birth is permissive will of God. It's not the perfect will of God. The way we're we're we're repopulating the earth now is under the permissive will of God. Amen. not the perfect will of God. Brother Brandham says he said it this way. Okay, if that's the way you want to do it, then go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; he let him go by his permissive will, but that was not his perfect will. And now we come to the earth this way. Amen. Needing redemption, needing salvation, needing some way back. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen and amen and amen. So the carnal mind is enmity against God. Ephesians 4 says, "This I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as not as other Gentiles walk and the vanity of their mind, having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart, who being past feeling have given themselves over into lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness." He says, "I don't want you to walk this way that everybody else has walked. There's got to be something different. Amen. They're in the vanity of their minds with their understanding darkened. Amen. That's how we came into this world. &gt;&gt; Blind with our mind darkened. And so it is written, "The first man, Adam, was made a living soul. The last Adam was made a quickening spirit." Amen. I love this scripture. It shows we had a first Adam, but we have a last Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in Adam, we all fell. Amen. So, there's got to come another headship, another Adam. Amen. One that can raise man back up because there's no way we're hopeless and destitute and without a hope in the world. Unless there can come another Adam to take back what Adam lost and re regain what Adam forfeited. Amen. And bring us under a different headship. Now, &gt;&gt; and I love this. If I could uh look at this, Adam was made a living soul. We know that happened. Amen. When God, Amen, took Adam and placed him in the flesh and breathed the breath of life and he became a living soul. Amen. But this Adam became a quickening spirit. Amen. Oh, praise be to God. I get so excited when I look this up. Amen. Living and quickening are similar words. Quicken means to be made alive. Amen. But a living soul is just one that is alive. &gt;&gt; Right? But a quickening SPIRIT IS SOMETHING THAT MAKES ALIVE. &gt;&gt; So Adam came a LIVING SOUL, BUT THE LAST ADAM CAME A QUICKENING SPIRIT. He came AS A FORCE THAT'LL MAKE ALIVE. THAT'LL BRING BACK LIFE FROM THE DEAD. AMEN. THAT'LL BRING WHAT'S FALLEN AND FAILED AND DEAD AND IN MISERY. HE'S COME BACK, THE LAST ADAM, TO BE A QUICKENING SPIRIT. THAT'S WHY HE'S QUICKENING US BY HIS SPIRIT. HE'S JUST NOT AN ADAM THAT WAS A SPIRIT MADE ALIVE. NO, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. HE IS THE FORCE OF GIVING LIFE, OF BRINGING TO LIFE, OF BRINGING BACK TO LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY? Because Adam didn't need to be made a quickening spirit. Because nothing had fallen yet. NOTHING WAS DEAD. ADAM WAS MADE A LIVING SOUL. AMEN. And through Adam would come, living souls would come THE FAMILY OF GOD. HE WAS given the commission to populate, REPLENISH THE EARTH. HOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN IS BETWEEN HIM AND GOD. &gt;&gt; I don't know if he ever came to the revelation of it yet because they couldn't wait and they went on in their own idea and what the devil had given to them. But one thing's for sure, amen, he was A LIVING SOUL. BUT AFTER HE DIED AND ALL OF MANKIND DIED WITH HIM, THIS LAST ADAM IS GOING TO HAVE TO be more than a living soul. He's going to HAVE TO BE A QUICKENING SPIRIT THAT CAN BRING LIFE BACK TO THE FALLEN RACE OF ADAM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, praise be to God Almighty, friends. &gt;&gt; You know what? This message is so precious to us. &gt;&gt; It makes it puts power into every scripture. &gt;&gt; Puts life. And I'm not saying there was no power, but the misunderstanding of man through the church ages. Amen. through the through the dark age when they lost the revelation of the word. They begin to interpret it with their own understanding with their darkened minds. They begin to lose the power of the word because they didn't understand the full impact of the word because they didn't have the full revelation of the word. Amen. And you you you look at this message. This message has restored everything back to us. Amen. It's restored the most basic of basic concepts of Calvary and redemption and salvation. Amen. HAS PUT SUCH DEPTH AND SUCH POWER AND SUCH LIFE BACK into what the church is losing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're losing by repeating stories. They're losing BY REPEATING SCRIPTURES. THEY LOST THE POWER AND THE DEPTH and the strength of it. BUT THIS REVELATION BROUGHT BACK THE DEPTH and the power and the strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of every doctrine, of every teaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the last Adam, you know me, I've said this before, but I I repeat myself, but I'm going to. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. You preach 80 some times a year in the same pullpit. And see if you repeat yourself. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; last Adam. &gt;&gt; What a word, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The last Adam, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That means we don't need no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The first Adam lost it all. And the first Adam was a son of God. But Adam wasn't the only son of God. Other sons of God would come forth. And if you read the Old Testament, there's always sons of God coming forth. Amen. And God. And a string of sons was working with his sons. And he would work with Job. And he would work with Noah. And he would work with Abraham. And he would work with Moses. And he'd work with them all. Amen. But every son that he come to, Amen. would create a flaw. It would have a flaw. would be an error. Amen. And and and God would become so disappointed. I mean, I say that I I hope you understand. God would become so disappointed. Even he found David a man after his own heart. And a man after his own heart fell in adultery and had a man killed and committed murder. Amen. To protect himself. But yet, he was a man after God's own heart. God found somebody he could fellowship with. One who understood him, one who would obey him and follow after his will. But even that man would fall in corruption. He had Moses and Moses would do his word and Moses would keep his word and Moses would deliver him and Moses would be his representative on the earth. But Moses in a fit of anger with frustration with the people who were driving him crazy, he would stand up and glorify himself and say, "Must I fetch water for you stiff necked people. And he SMOKED THE ROCK TWICE WHEN HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SPEAK TO IT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And oh, I say it again. God was disappointed. Is there nobody who could undo what Adam did? Is there nobody? And he knew there wasn't because we had a lamb slain before the foundation of the world. He had a plan, but God was working. Amen. And there was sons coming all the way down through. But there would come a son. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS TRYING OUT Adams all the way through, but there would come a last Adam. And you say, "Well, that wasn't his name. His name was Jesus Christ. He was the last Adam." ALL THE OTHER ATOMS HAD FELL, but there was one atom that didn't fall, which was the son of God on the earth. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, I'm sorry, the book of Revelation says, "And unto the angel of the church of the Leodyans, write these things the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God." &gt;&gt; Who's speaking? These things say the amen. That's Christ. the faithful and true witness. That's Christ, the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; We're going to get into this in just a minute. In the legacy in church age, he says, "Now to show that he was the first also as he was, he's the beginning of the creation of God." Oh, do you catch it? See, how could God be created if he's a spirit? How could he be? He's eternal. He never was created. He never will be created because he was God at the beginning. But he he he that is the beginning of the creation of God was Jesus Christ when he was made manifest when God lived in him. He is God's creation. Oh my. See the first and the last. The amen. The beginning of the creation of God. When God created himself a body. He came down and lived in it. That's the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what Jesus Christ was. The beginning of the creation of God. Our brother Bam said God making himself part of his creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God can't be created. &gt;&gt; He is the creator. &gt;&gt; He cannot create himself. He is the creator. But what he created was a body, a part of the earth that he could indwell. And he called that son. That was his son. That body that he stepped into. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 15 says, "But now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's turn to Romans 5 together. I told you we got a lot of scriptures. We're going to keep moving. Romans chapter 5. Romans 5 and verse 12 says, "Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the sin entered into the world and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. For unto the for until the law, sin was in the world, but sin was not imputed when there was no law. Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the simultude of Adam's transgression." Who is the figure of him that was to come? So what was Adam? He was the figure of him that was to come. Who is him that was to come? &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one, many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. Let's stop reading there for just a second. All eyes on me. I can't blank out the screen because you're holding your Bibles. Amen. But what I want you to see is by one headship we're lost. &gt;&gt; By one headship we're saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By one all is lost. By one everything's made alive. By by this one you're doomed. By this one you're saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what Paul is telling us here. Let's read verse 15 again. But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one Adam, many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. &gt;&gt; Has it abounded to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. And not as it was by by one that sin, so is the gift. For the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification. He's saying there was one offense that led everyone to death. &gt;&gt; But now in Christ, there's many offenses, which is all of our offenses, all of our transgressions, everything we've done wrong. But the free gift is of many offenses unto justification. He's justifying us for them all. Amen. &gt;&gt; For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ. Therefore, as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. Moreover, the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound. That as sin hath reigned into death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was sold into sin. I was a slave to sin. I come to the world with my mind at enmity with God. My my my senses darkened to the things of God. An enemy to God. Hating the things of God. A transgressor from the beginning and been given over to the lust of the flesh. That's how I started. And I started that way because of Adam. &gt;&gt; Because of one man and because of one offense. But oh, praise God. If by one man many offenses come, now the many offenses going to be turned to righteousness by one man. One man will reverse what one man did. And what was that one man? He was the head of a family. And because I'm part of that family by my natural sex birth, Amen. I'm doomed. Amen. But there come another headship to the family of God. And in that one man with his one ACT DOING ONE THING. EVERYBODY that comes under that headship GETS THE BENEFIT OF THAT HEADSHIP. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF I SUFFER THE EFFECTS OF HEADSHIP OF ADAM, WHY CANNOT I SUFFER THE EFFECTS OF THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST? &gt;&gt; AND IF THE POWER OF THE HEADSHIP OF ADAM BRINGS EVERY ONE OF US TO DEATH AND sickness and we're SUFFERING FROM IT NOW, WE HAD A FUNERAL SERVICE YESTERDAY. AMEN. YOU PASS CEMETERIES EVERY DAY AND PEOPLE ARE GOING in there day AFTER DAY AFTER DAY. THAT'S THE POWER OF HEADSHIP. IF THAT HEADSHIP IS THAT POWERFUL AND IRREVERSIBLE AND IRREVOCABLE IN THIS LIFE, WHAT ABOUT THIS HEADSHIP OF CHRIST? IS IT JUST AS POWERFUL TO BRING ME LIFE? &gt;&gt; AND I WAS BORN DOOMED BEFORE I DID WRONG. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND I WAS BROUGHT UNDER HEADSHIP OF LIFE BEFORE I DID RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT WASN'T MY DEEDS. I'VE DONE DEEDS. SURE. I'M WORTHY OF ALL KINDS OF JUDGMENT. I I SUFFER MY OWN DEEDS. AMEN. BUT I WAS BORN WRONG BY THE DEEDS OF ANOTHER. BUT UNDER A NEW BIRTH, &gt;&gt; UNDER A SPIRITUAL NEW BIRTH. I COME UNDER THE DEEDS OF SOMEONE ELSE. NOT MY DEEDS, HIS DEEDS. And his deeds declared him the HEAD OF THE FAMILY. THE ONE WHO'S RIGHTEOUS. THE LAST ADAM. TAKING BACK WHAT ADAM LOST. AND NOW UNDER THAT HEADSHIP, I'M DECLARED RIGHTEOUS. &gt;&gt; NOT WITH MY RIGHTEOUSNESS, BUT with his righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the FALL OF MAN AND ADAM. BUT WHAT IS THE RISE OF MAN? THE LAST ADAM. &gt;&gt; This isn't US GETTING BETTER. THIS ISN'T US FIGURING ANYTHING OUT. This isn't us correcting our behavior. AMEN. THIS IS FINDING THE RIGHT HEADSHIP. FINDING THE RIGHT ONE. AMEN. THAT I AM ATTACHED TO. AMEN. AND I WAS ATTACHED WITHOUT MY WILL, WITHOUT MY DECISION TO ADAM. BUT NOW, AMEN. BY THE CHOICE OF GOD, BY PREDESTINATION, HE SAW FIT TO ATTACH ME TO THIS HEADSHIP. AND HE PLANTED INSIDE OF MY SOUL BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD A SEED GENE OF ETERNAL LIFE THAT WHEN I WOULD COME IN CONTACT WITH THIS JESUS CHRIST, SOMETHING IN ME WOULD SAY THAT'S NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH THAT I BELIEVE AND BY FAITH YOU ARE SAVED. &gt;&gt; We found another headship. &gt;&gt; And in that headship, brother Chad, I still make I make bad decisions. Who's your head? &gt;&gt; Who's interceding for the family? &gt;&gt; Remember the job of Job? AMEN. JOB WAS OUT THERE. Job was out there OFFERING A LAMB PER ADVENTURE, HIS CHILDREN might have sinned. Amen. What was he? He was the headship OVER HIS FAMILY. AND GOD HONORED JOB'S HEADSHIP. AND GOD HONORED JOB'S FAITH. AND BECAUSE OF JOB'S FAITH IN THE SACRIFICE, JOB GOT ALL OF HIS CHILDREN BACK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY? God honored his headship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Praise God Almighty. Even in the natural, Amen. Israel was blessed when it had a godly king. Israel was cursed when it had an ungodly king. Why? That's the power of headship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to ask you a question. When Hadtie writes, "Two boys were saved, &gt;&gt; whose faith did God honor?" &gt;&gt; Their faith or their mother's faith, &gt;&gt; their mother's faith, &gt;&gt; and their father, they were under their mother. Amen. When she said the right thing, God said, "What do you want? I want the salvation of my two boys." And he honored her faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he saved those two boys. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, God Almighty. I love it. &gt;&gt; Let's let's turn to Hebrews chapter 2 together. We're going to come back to Romans. So, if you want to save your finger in Romans or throw a pen there or something, we're coming back. Hebrews chapter 2, verse 10. Hebrews chapter 2:10, for it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, and bringing many sons into glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering. For both he that sanctifith, and they who are sanctified are all of one. Oh my goodness. I just can't I can't hardly take it, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He who sanctifith, which is Jesus Christ. And those who are sanctified, which are us, &gt;&gt; we're all of one. &gt;&gt; We have one father. &gt;&gt; We come from the mind of God. We have one father. Amen. And he said they are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren. &gt;&gt; He is our brother. &gt;&gt; Do you know that Adam is also our brother? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz when you talk about mankind, we're brothers. &gt;&gt; Right. We're brethren. We all come from the same father. Amen. When if Adam would have brought forth the seed of God correctly upon the earth, everyone that would have come forth with Adam would have been his son and his brother. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they would have all been the children of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You you know when when Eve when the woman came out of Adam, that was his wife. She was part of him, but that was also his sister. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they were all under the same headship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of God. &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ, the one who sanctifith, and we who are sanctified are all of one. And that's why he's not ashamed to call us brethren. &gt;&gt; What kind of brother is he? He's our big brother. &gt;&gt; He's the head of the family. He's the one who gets the inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one. What What inheritance does he get? The inheritance that Adam lost. The first son was given the inheritance. The inheritance was the right to rule over the earth and dominion over the earth. He lost it. Now there's an inheritance waiting. Amen. Now we're waiting for a big brother. We're waiting. &gt;&gt; We're waiting for a head of the family to come on the scene. The big brother, the firstborn among many brethren. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The firstborn gets the right of inheritance. And now he becomes the firstborn of many brethren. And the firstborn gets the inheritance. Amen. And the inher Oh my goodness. And the inheritance he buys back for the whole family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is not ashamed to call us brethren. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, I would be ashamed to call me brethren &gt;&gt; of all the things I've done and do and the attitudes I take and the things I do. But he's not ashamed to call us brethren because he knows something we don't know. He knows what happened at the beginning, how we've fallen to ruin, what we're struggling with. LISTEN, WE'VE GOT COMPLEXES and we've got ideas and we've got traditions and we've got all of that stuff, friends. But God can see all the way through that AND HE UNDERSTANDS THAT'S my son down there in that soul. That's my son. THAT'S FROM MY THOUGHT. THAT'S A THOUGHT. AMEN. THAT HAS FALLEN into the world and I'm redeeming that back. And Jesus Christ knew he was coming for his brethren. &gt;&gt; And he's not ashamed to call us brethren, &gt;&gt; saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren. In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, behold, I and the children which God hath given me. For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. For verily who took not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham, he became like us. Wherefore in all things he behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in all things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to secure them that are tempted. &gt;&gt; So what did he do? He came down and became one of us &gt;&gt; so that he could redeem back his brethren. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. I'm so glad he's not ashamed. I'm certainly not ashamed to call him my brother, my Lord, my Savior, my God, my all and all, but I'm so glad he's not ashamed to call us brethren. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In John 19:4, the scripture says, "Pilate therefore went forth again and said unto them, behold, I bring him forth to you that ye may know that I find no fault in him." Then came Jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, "Behold the man." &gt;&gt; This statement, oh my goodness, friends, this statement right here, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is a man &gt;&gt; because it was a man who lost redemption rights, &gt;&gt; the right to rule, lost the inheritance. It was a man and only a man who could redeem back those rights. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he couldn't take on him the form of an angel, but he had to take on him the seed of Abraham. He had to be made into flesh like his brethren made flesh. That's the only way he could come and buy back what man lost is to become a man to win back what man lost. And I want you to look at this. Pilate is the authority in the region under the Roman rule. And the authority, they bring Jesus to the authority because they don't have the authority to kill him. So they bring him to the authority. Who's Pilate? Who's governor of the region? And Pilate examines him and Pilate talks to him and Pilate scourges him and Pilate says, "I find no fault in him." &gt;&gt; God makes even secular leaders testify to his gospel truth. This is a lamb WITHOUT SPOT OR WRINKLE. I'VE PUT HIM TO THE TEST. He's at the judgment seat of the highest ruling authority in the land. And at the seat of the highest judging authority in the land, that judge says, "THERE IS NO FAULT in this one." And then HE BRINGS HIM OUT AND THEY'VE MOCKED HIM AS A KING. THEY MADE FUN of him with a a crown of thorns and a purple robe and they've mocked him AS KING OF THE JEWS, DECLARING he's their king. Even though they're mocking him, HE'S THE KING. THE WHOLE SCENE IS SET TO DECLARE WHAT GOD IS DOING. AND PILATE SAYS, "I FIND NO FAULT IN HIM. HE IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY." AND THEN HE SHOWS HIM TO THE THE CROWD. HE SAYS, "BEHOLD THE MAN." &gt;&gt; What man? The man. The man. It has TO BE A MAN. THIS IS THE MAN. NO OTHER MAN CAN DO IT. BUT THIS IS THE MAN THAT CAN TAKE AWAY SINS. THIS IS THE MAN THAT CAN BUY BACK THE INHERITANCE OF MAN. THIS IS THE MAN. &gt;&gt; OH, PILATE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS SAYING, BUT HE WAS MOVED BY GOD. GOD WAS BRINGING AN ANOINTING ON THE SCENE THAT THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY IN THE LAND WOULD STAND BEFORE THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. ARE THE HIGH PRIEST, THE CHIEF PRIESTS, THE POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE LAND. AND THEY WOULD SAY THERE'S NO FAULT IN THIS MAN. THIS IS THE ONLY MAN SINCE ADAM FELL THAT'S PERFECT. [Applause] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "BEHOLD," WHICH MEANS, "LOOK." &gt;&gt; "BEHOLD THE MAN." &gt;&gt; "OH, HOW I WISH I COULD BE THERE THAT DAY. I WOULD SCREAM WITH ALL THAT'S IN ME. THAT'S MY LORD. THAT'S THE LAST ADAM. HE'S BUYING IT BACK FOR ME. &gt;&gt; BEHOLD THE MAN. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S THE MAN. &gt;&gt; THE ONLY MAN. THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN BE the man. &gt;&gt; Friends, what a what a treasure we hold in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a reality this is to us. IT'S NOT AN EXCITING SERMON. IT'S NOT A SUNDAY SCHOOL STORY. IT'S THE REALITY THAT WE'RE LIVING IN AND WALKING IN. We've been given another headship. &gt;&gt; Behold the man. I think this is one of the most profound things written in scriptures. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Romans 6 verse three. Romans 6:3. Know you not that so many of you as were baptized unto Jesus Christ were baptized unto his death? Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism unto death, that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also would walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is free from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him, knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more. Death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once, but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. &gt;&gt; And he ever liveth &gt;&gt; to make intercession. &gt;&gt; Listen, he listen, when we come to water baptism in Jesus' name, this is one of the truths that was restored in the end time. But listen, this isn't a trivial thing. &gt;&gt; This isn't just a light thing on the side. We figured out that through the dark ages, they got water baptism wrong. when they went to the trinitarian idea. Why did the devil take them to the trinitarian idea? Why did this truth GET OBSCURED? WHY WHY WAS IT WHY WAS IT LOST? Why was the truth of it lost? Amen. Because the reality is that we needed another headship. And that headship is found in the person of Jesus Christ, the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The man. The man that died for me. The man that was my substitutionary offering. I could no longer take a substitute as a lamb or a goat. Amen. because their life couldn't atone for mine. That was just a covering for sin temporarily until the lamb of God could come. And the lamb of God was a body that he created. Amen. That body of Jesus Christ. And he was declared by Pilate to have no fault. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He could go right to crucifixion because he's already been proved. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And shown before the the the high priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this one is without spot or blemish &gt;&gt; and go straight to Calvary. &gt;&gt; Now, water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is declaring my new headship. &gt;&gt; It's not just a doctrine, friends. It's not just a teaching. It's an absolute declaration to the world that now I have died to my old life. I have died to my old nature. I have died to that first birth. I have died to all that I was and all that I thought I was and all the confusion I came into the world. I died to the old person to the old chad to everything THAT MATTERED TO ME. I'M DEAD BECAUSE I WANT TO LEAVE THAT headship and I want to take the headship of Jesus Christ. So I come to the waters of baptism. Amen. And declare to the world that I am dead to what I was. But I'm coming under this headship OF JESUS CHRIST. I WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED with this man. Amen. &gt;&gt; This man, NOT THE MAN FROM EDEN. THIS MAN, &gt;&gt; I COME BORN IN SIN, SHAPE IN INIQUITY, COME TO THE WORLD SPEAKING LIES, IDENTIFIED WITH THAT MAN FROM EDEN. BUT OH, IF I CAN DIE TO THAT, TO THAT HEADSHIP, TO THAT MAN, AND TAKE the headship that's offered TO ME AND TESTIFY TO THE WORLD THAT THIS IS MY HEAD BY BEING BAPTIZED IN HIS NAME. NOW, I'M COMING UNDER THIS HEADSHIP, DYING TO THAT, COMING TO LIFE UNDER THIS HEADSHIP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And I ask you friends, if the power of that headship affected me all of my life, what will the power of this headship do? &gt;&gt; Listen, these aren't fables. These aren't these aren't uh little stories. Amen. This is the reality IN OUR LIFE. IF BY FAITH we can see a TRANSFER OF OUR LIFE, I DON'T WANT THIS LIFE ANYMORE. I RECOGNIZE THAT I'M I'M NOTHING. AMEN. I was born wrong and everything in me is WRONG AND I'M ALL TWISTED UP IN MY MIND AND I'M ALL TWISTED UP WITH WRONG DESIRES AND I HATE the way I was born and I hate the way I was put together. Amen. And I realize that comes FROM EDEN. BUT GOD, I DON'T WANT THAT ANYMORE. ALL I WANT IS YOUR LIFE IN ME. ALL I WANT IS TO SERVE YOU AND I WANT TO COME UNDER a no headship. I WANT A NEW CAPTAIN of the host. I want a new captain OF THE ARMY. I WANT MY CHIEF CAPTAIN TO BE THE MAN, &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus. And under that headship, I rest. &gt;&gt; REST. NO MORE FEAR. NO MORE BONDAGE OF SIN. NO MORE BONDAGE OF DEATH. BECAUSE HE ABSOLVED ME FROM ALL SIN. WHEN HE WAS FOUND TO BE FAULTLESS AND WENT TO CALVARY, HE WAS MY SUBSTITUTE. NOT A GOAT, NOT A SHEEP, NOT A TURTLE DOVE, BUT A MAN, a human being to pay the price for mankind. AND HE BECAME THE FIRSTBORN AMONG MANY BRETHREN. HE BECAME THE HEAD OF THAT FAMILY. AND WHEN the head of the FAMILY PAID THE PRICE FOR THE FAMILY, HE BECAME THE HEADSHIP OF THE FAMILY. NOW EVERYTHING UNDER THE FAMILY is blessed under that headship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it's NOT MY WORKS. IT'S NOT MY DEEDS. IT'S my headship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Chad, we can get away with anything. If you take it that way, you can get away with murder. Some have. &gt;&gt; Some have gotten away with drunkenness and adultery and murder and fornication of all kinds &gt;&gt; and lies. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he paid the price for me. &gt;&gt; He never asked me to pay it. I couldn't pay it. I was across the chasm. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; There's nothing I could do to get my way back. So, he paid the price for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And how many former drunks and adulterers have come under a new headship? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And under this new headship, everything else is absolved because he stood in my place and he paid the price for my sin. Past, present, &gt;&gt; and future. &gt;&gt; As long as I stay under this headship, I get the benefit of the headship. If I leave the headship, I leave the benefit of the headship. that if I stay under this headship, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that I don't I shouldn't still do right. I must do right. I must stay under the headship. He's my headship. So whatever he says, whatever he dictates, THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A LAW to me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because he said it. It's my it's my love law. I want to keep it by love. I want to honor him in every way. But listen, as much as I try, I still fail. &gt;&gt; As much as you try, you still fail. As hard as we've tried to do everything right, we still get it wrong. BUT PRAISE GOD, EVEN WHEN I'm wrong, I'm still under the headship. And the headship brings me back into his headship and back into repentance. And he chasens me and he corrects me and he gets me right BACK ON THE RIGHT PATH. BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO LOSE ME. He shed his blood FOR ME. AMEN. I'M PART OF THE BRETHREN. I'M UNDER HIS HEADSHIP. AND UNDER his headship, I'm secure. &gt;&gt; Without his headship, I'm lost and dead and doomed and in darkness. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But under his headship, I have life and resurrection and freedom and light and love and everything else that's provided for us. In Ephesians chapter 2, he says, "But God who is rich in mercy, but God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ." &gt;&gt; You mean I've already been quickened? Why? When the head of the family went up, the whole family went up. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he's the head of the family. And he re represents the whole family. Let's go back just so we understand this. When the head of the family fell, the whole family fell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? And Adam &gt;&gt; and Adam all died. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So when the head of the family rose, what happened to the whole family? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] Listen, we don't understand. We have to understand this is all about headship and representation. And he is my representation and he is my headship and it's all on him. &gt;&gt; Has quickened us together with Christ. By grace you are saved. And raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Oh, we say all the time, "Oh, if I could just get to heaven, I can't wait to sit on the throne." You're already sitting on the throne. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Chad, you're already He hath raised us up together. Listen, I want to ask you a question. Are you included in that word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; By faith, I believe it. I'm included in that word. He has raised us up together and made us, Here it is again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Amen. I hope I make it to heaven. I hope I get there someday. Listen, when he made it, I made it. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WENT UP, I WENT UP. AMEN. WHEN HE RESURRECTED, I RESURRECTED. THIS IS WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM teaches us. THIS IS WHAT PAUL TEACHES US. WE'VE ALREADY MADE IT. WHY HAVE WE MADE IT? BECAUSE THE HEADSHIP OF THE family made it. AND WHEN HE MADE IT, EVERYTHING THAT'S ATTACHED TO THAT FAMILY MADE IT ALSO. I MADE IT IN HIS REPRESENTATION. I made it in him. And in him, I'm already there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's for me. I want to stay in his headship. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away." What are old things? That first life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, all things are become new, and all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given us the ministry of reconciliation. So all things are become new, and all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ. So how did he get us back to himself? by making a new head of the family &gt;&gt; and by letting that new head of the family live a perfect life, fulfill all the law of God without flaw and then die as a substitutionary offering for all of fallen man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he reconciled me to himself by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why it's so important to be identified with Jesus Christ. Brother M says in the message and knoweth it not. He said and God is a creator and how was he ever created? But this is the beginning of the creation of God. When God the spirit was created in a form of a man, that was God being created. God the creator himself becoming a creation. God who made the dirt, made the calcium, made the pot ash, cosmic light, petroleum, took the thing together and created it. created himself in the beginning of the creation of God. Again, he says in proving his word, he says he proved the word by saying he was Jehovah made manifest. He was the beginning of the creation of God. God in creation, God with a little part of the creation here that God was living in himself. He was the beginning of that creation of God. From him begets many sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what was supposed to happen in Eden. Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is exactly what was supposed to happen in Eden from Adam was supposed to be many sons. Amen. But then the sons that begat begget by the by by by the sexual desire of his own will and by the permissive will of God and everybody comes wrong and come trapped in sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now this is what brother Bam says. Now God was living in a portion of creation himself. He was the beginning of that creation of God. And from him, the last Adam, the restored man, &gt;&gt; he beggets many sons. &gt;&gt; How? Through spiritual birth. &gt;&gt; Not natural birth this time, but through spiritual birth, he beggets many sons. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. There's that word firstborn. He is the head of the family. And if I'm one of the many brethren, then I get the benefit of the firstborn. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. We have a champion. We have a captain. We have the head of the family. We are blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the legacy in church age from the church age book the prophet says this. This new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation. He's talking about you and your new birth. This is exactly what it says. It is new creation. It is not another creation distinct from the old one. It is another creation distinct from the old one. No longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh. That was how he dealt with Israel. He chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue through the godly Isaac line. But now out of every kindred, tribe and nation, he has purposed a new creation. He is the first of that creation. He was God created in the form of a man. Now by his spirit, he is creating many sons into himself. God the creator creating himself a part of his creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's take our time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's not breathe through this. Amen. He listen he is he is no longer dealing in the ways of flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how he started with Adam &gt;&gt; and it failed. That's how he was coming through the Abrahamic line. Amen. He was dealing with that. But now Paul comes and tells us, "No, no, no. It's not the natural line of Abraham anymore. It's the faith seed of Abraham, the royal line. Those that believe are children of Abraham by faith." &gt;&gt; So he's no longer dealing by the ways of flesh. That's how he dealt with Israel. BUT NOW OUT OF EVERY KID, IT DOESN'T MATTER where you were born. It doesn't matter your nationality. It doesn't matter who your parents were. None of that matters because THIS IS NOT ABOUT FLESH ANYMORE. NOW, he was the beginning. Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God where God would take a part of his creation and he would make a body for himself to express him and that was Jesus Christ. AND HE WOULD DWELL in it reconciling the world unto himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. BUT FROM THERE NOW HE'S GOING TO DO amen what Adam failed to do. And now he's going to be get many sons. But how's he going to do it? REMEMBER THE LAST ADAM BECAME A QUICKENING SPIRIT. Now it's going to BE BY THE QUICKENING POWER OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD. HE'S GOING TO COME IN AND HE'S going to bring A NEW CREATION OUT OF OUR FLESH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THIS FLESH, BROTHER SAID, IS STILL A STICKY COCKER NATURE. AMEN. THE OUTSIDE IS STILL STICKY COCOA, BUT INSIDE IS A NEW MAN MADE AFTER CHRIST JESUS BEING FORMED INTO THE IMAGE of his son. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; But he purposed a new creation. He is the first of that creation. He was God created in the FORM OF MAN. NOW BY HIS SPIRIT, he is creating many sons into himself. By what? The new birth. By the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Spiritual new birth. He is creating many sons into himself. And that that spirit is none other but the spirit of God coming to indwell his children. And God the creator creating himself part of his creation. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God but not the finish. God is still moving down into creation through spiritual birth through new creatures. Now he's dwelling in humanity. HE'S DWELLING IN A BODY, THE BODY OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And that body has one headship. &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; This is the true revelation of God. This was his purpose. This purpose took form through election. &gt;&gt; That is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation of God. &gt;&gt; Are you part of the new creation? AMEN. &gt;&gt; BY WHAT? BY spiritual birth, he begget sons, and he's come, Amen, to live in those sons. &gt;&gt; To become part of his creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Colossians says, "And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell, and having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself. By him, I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven, and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. I hope you can see this. try to make it thick. &gt;&gt; How's he going to present us holy and unblameable and reprovable in his sight when we get our act together and we start doing good deeds and start no he has reconciled us in the body of his flesh through death. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; we were reconciled in Christ. God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself. We were reconciled there in the body of his flesh. When that body died, &gt;&gt; Amen. He died for me. &gt;&gt; When that blood was shed, that blood was shed for me. When that price was paid, when he was being beaten, he was being beaten for my crimes. When he was suffering, he was suffering in my place for my wrong deeds. and he worked in exchange. He took my sin upon him and he suffered the consequences of my sin so that he could put his righteousness on me so that I could suffer the consequences of his righteousness. &gt;&gt; And he did that. He reconciled us in the body of his flesh to death so that he could present us present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. You say, "How so, brother Chad? You don't know what I did yesterday. You don't know what I did this morning. I lost my temper. I did this. Listen, that's Have we been so far into this sermon, we've already missed it. &gt;&gt; He's the head of the family. &gt;&gt; He paid the price for the whole family. Now he's presenting me to the father holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. &gt;&gt; How? Because somebody paid the price for me &gt;&gt; by the shedding of blood. Amen. By by the covering of the blood, by the new birth. Now I get the benefit of his substitutionary offering. All my sins are under this substitutionary offering. So God doesn't account any of my sin to me as long as I stay under this headship. Amen. All my sins are paid for. And now I'm presented by my faith in him, holy, unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. Because of what he did, NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT I DO. &gt;&gt; He did it so he could present me holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. He did that so he could present to himself a church without spot or wrinkle. He did it so he could pay for our sins because of our fallen nature from our first father Adam. OUR FIRST BIG BROTHER FELL. WE ALL FELL. SO GOD BROUGHT US ANOTHER FIRSTBORN among many brethren, another big brother so that when he rose, we can rise with him. [Music] &gt;&gt; No matter how many times we preach this and no matter how many times we go over it, THERE'S ALWAYS, "BUT I DID THIS, BUT I DID THAT." AMEN. LISTEN, YOU GOT TO STOP LOOKING AT ADAM AND START LOOKING AT CHRIST AND SAY, "I WAS I WAS RECONCILED IN THE BODY OF HIS FLESH. ALL MY CRIMES, ALL MY SINS, AND EVERYTHING I'LL EVER DO WAS PAID FOR IN THAT SUBSTITUTIONARY OFFERING. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, MY FAITH IN THAT, GOD HAS IMPUTED UNTO ME HIS OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS. AND NOW I'M JUST AS RIGHTEOUS AS CHRIST IS RIGHTEOUS BECAUSE HE PAID THE PRICE FOR ME. GOD CAN'T EXTRACT IT FROM ME BECAUSE HE EXTRACTED IT FROM JESUS CHRIST. HE CAN'T MAKE ME PAY. THERE'S NO DOUBLE JEOPARDY. IT WAS PAID FOR AT CALVARY. GOD'S NOT DOING A DOUBLE PUNISHMENT. THERE WAS ONE PRICE PAID FOR SIN ONCE AND FOR ALL. &gt;&gt; AND IF I'M UNDER THAT HEADSHIP, ALL MY SIN WAS PAID FOR ONCE AND FOR ALL. AND UNDER THAT HEADSHIP, I'm declared righteous. &gt;&gt; Because of his righteousness, &gt;&gt; not mine. &gt;&gt; That's why he become the interceder to intercede through the church ages. What was he interceding for? HE WAS INTERCEDING FOR HIS BRETHREN. He was standing IN THE GAP. HE WAS THE BIG BROTHER. HE WAS THE LAST ADAM. HE HE WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION OF GOD. HE WAS THE HEAD OF IT ALL. STANDING THERE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY SAYING FATHER FORGIVE THEM THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO FATHER FORGIVE THEM FATHER FORGIVE THEM FATHER FORGIVE THEM WHAT WAS HE DOING HE WAS AT THE PLACE OF JUDGMENT BUT HE HIMSELF WAS BEING ABLE TO EXTEND MERCY AMEN AND FORGIVENESS BECAUSE THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB THE ONE THAT PAID THE PRICE WAS STANDING THERE INTERCEDING FOR HIS brethren &gt;&gt; the head OF THE FAMILY LIKE JOB HEAD OF THE FAMILY PAID THE PRICE FOR his children Jesus Christ the head of The family paid the price for his brethren, FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD, AND HE'S BEEN STANDING THROUGH THE CHURCH AGES. AMEN. AN INTERCESSION. AMEN. DECLARING, "FATHER, forgive them." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother BAM DRAMATIZED. HE SAYS HE LOOKS to him. Amen. The bloody lamb, THE HIGH PRIEST WITH THE BLOOD, AND HE FORGIVES US. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; NOT BASED OFF OUR MERIT, NOT BASED OFF OUR CONDUCT, BUT BASED OFF OUR FAITH IN THE SUBSTITUTIONARY OFFERING. But I know I'll have a conversation with somebody months from now. But I but how could he I still have this problem in my life. It's like please &gt;&gt; look to your big brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look to God the beginning of the creation. Look to the chief captain. Look to the captain of the host. Look to the one who took our place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look to the headship. What name were you baptized? &gt;&gt; You're not baptized in titles. &gt;&gt; Amen. Although God has titles. So God works with man in different modes of operation. And all that's an expla explanation of how God is working with man. But when God came to pay the price, he had to become a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A man. The man. And when he became the man, the head of the family, he took a name and that name was Jesus. Amen. And now in the name of Jesus Christ, I am redeemed. In the name of Jesus Christ, I am saved. In the name of Jesus Christ, I'm declared fallless. In the name OF JESUS CHRIST, I AM DELIVERED. In the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, I AM SET FREE. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S ALL in that name. BECAUSE IT WAS ALL IN THAT MAN. &gt;&gt; Cuz it HAD TO BE A MAN. A MAN LOST IT. A MAN HAS TO REDEEM IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY TITLES WON'T WORK FOR BAPTISM. IT HAS TO BE THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO PAID THE PRICE FOR THE FAMILY OF GOD. AND THAT MAN WAS Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY BAPTISM HAS TO BE IN THE name of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, DECLARING WHO IT WAS. WHO'S THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY? WHO'S GOING TO BE KING OF KINGS and lord of lords and RULE OVER THE EARTH? BECAUSE THE BATTLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOR WHO'S GOING TO RULE THE EARTH. WHAT DID ADAM LEAVE? THE RIGHT TO RULE THE EARTH. WHAT DID JESUS CHRIST BUY BACK? THE RIGHT TO RULE THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; And he redeemed it all. Romans 8, he says, "And if children for children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint hes." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I like this word, too. There's a lot of words that I like. &gt;&gt; Joint hes. &gt;&gt; That means I'm a co-air. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With Christ, &gt;&gt; that means I get the benefit of all he did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together. That means I have to stay under his headship. &gt;&gt; I have to stay under his lordship, under his rulership, under his headship. But I'm an heir of God because I'm a child of God because he that is sanctified and he that is sanctified are all of the same. &gt;&gt; I'm an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ. &gt;&gt; What did Christ buy back? Everything that was lost. &gt;&gt; So what do I get in him? Everything that was lost &gt;&gt; in him. He bought it back. I didn't have to buy it back. I couldn't buy it back. He bought it back. But because I'm in him, &gt;&gt; because I'm under his headship and part of him, when he bought it back, he bought it back for me, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to Revelation chapter 5. I love so much. I was in the back just meditating on how blessed we are as a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother said, at the opening of the seals, the veil came off the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We begin to understand all of these things that we're preaching today and the depth that we're understanding them. Amen. It's not like we didn't know Jesus Christ, Amen, was the first begotten. We It wasn't that we didn't know that he paid the price, but we didn't understand what redemption was all about. We didn't know what we fell from and what we were going back to. We didn't know what the fall was all about. We didn't know what redemption was all about. All of denomination is trying to get people saved so they don't go to hell and they go to heaven. That has nothing to DO WITH REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; THAT has nothing to zero. Zilt. If you still think getting saved is so you don't go to hell, but you go to heaven. You have no idea what redemption is about. And you have no idea what this Bible is about. &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with redemption. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HELL WAS NOT EVEN CREATED for man. Hell was created for the devil and his angels. &gt;&gt; There will be some men who wind up there. There'll be some souls who wind up there because they refuse the light of God's word. Amen. Whenever they come face to face with it. But it was not CREATED FOR MAN. GOD didn't create that for man. God created the earth for man. &gt;&gt; GOD CREATED THE EARTH and all that is on the earth. AND HE FORMED IT ALL. AMEN. TO BE the habitation and dominion and rulership of man. And man was GOING TO BE GOD'S ATTRIBUTES, HIS FAMILY, HIMSELF, MANIFEST IN BODIES OF FLESH UPON THIS EARTH AS A FAMILY OF GOD IN FELLOWSHIP WITH ONE ANOTHER ON THE EARTH. THAT'S WHY THE COMMISSION WAS GIVEN TO ADAM. THAT'S WHY ADAM WOULD HAVE BROUGHT FORTH CHRIST, THE ENTIRE RACE OF CHRIST, THE ENTIRE SEED LINE, THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; What book? THE BOOK THAT ADAM LOST. WHAT WAS THAT BOOK? THAT WAS THAT WAS THE book of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lineage of Christ, the seed line of Christ. Adam would have brought forth all of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Lord, &gt;&gt; that means I would have been included &gt;&gt; because I'm part of Christ, the anointed word. &gt;&gt; But Adam failed. That's why serpent seed is such an important doctrine. is not a teaching, friend. That's why, listen, we're not coming back to I know something the Baptists don't know. &gt;&gt; My has nothing to do with that. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHY THERE WAS A VIRGIN birth without serpent seat. I don't UNDERSTAND WHAT I FELL FROM. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE BODY I LIVE IN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I LOVE GOD WITH ALL MY HEART AND I'M STILL TEMPTED WITH THIS OUTSIDE MAN IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND SERPENT SEED. &gt;&gt; We have NO UNDERSTANDING AND NO UNDERSTANDING OF REDEMPTION. AND DENOMINATIONS ARE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE SAVED to go to heaven. LISTEN, HEAVEN IS NOT MY DESTINATION. MY DESTINATION IS A JOINT HEIR WITH CHRIST WHEN CHRIST HAS GIVEN BACK EVERYTHING ADAM LOST ON THIS EARTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MY DESTINATION is here in the new heavens IN THE NEW EARTH. AMEN. RULING AND REIGNING WITH CHRIST FIRST FOR A THOUSAND YEARS IN A HONEYMOON PERIOD. THEN A FINAL BURNING OFF OF EVERYTHING THAT'S UNGODLY AND A RESTORATION. AMEN. of heaven and earth united together as one. When the new heavens descend out of heaven, amen, as a bride adorned for her groom. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT? IT'S THE BARRIER THAT SEPARATES. HEAVEN AND EARTH IS REMOVED. SOMEHOW IT'S REMOVED. AND THE TWO REALMS UNITE INTO ONE. AND HEAVEN AND earth become one thing upon this earth. And Jesus Christ is lord of lords, KING OF KINGS. HE'S ALL IN ALL AND WE ARE WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; That's redemption. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHAT THIS STORY IS ALL ABOUT. IT'S NOT ABOUT GETTING SOMEBODY SAVED SO THEY DON'T GO TO HELL AND THEY GO TO HEAVEN, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's not That's &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, there is nothing outside this message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That'll bring life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; NOTHING. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BEING TAUGHT TO PEOPLE. I NEED TO BELIEVE IN JESUS so I don't go to hell, so I go to heaven. THAT'S LISTEN THAT'S NOT WHY EVEN JESUS CAME. HE CAME TO REDEEM ALL THAT WAS LOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's why he CAME FOR HIS LOST SHEEP. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I didn't come to save the whole world. I CAME FOR MINE THAT WERE IN THE WORLD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But in order to get HIS THAT WERE IN THE WORLD, HE PAID THE PRICE FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE BOUGHT BACK EVERYTHING ADAM LOST BECAUSE HE WANTED THE PEARL of great price. THE PEARL OF GREAT PRICE WAS HIS TREASURE. WAS HIS BRIDE. IN ORDER TO GET THE TREASURE, HE BOUGHT THE WHOLE FIELD. HE BOUGHT THE WHOLE EARTH BY THE SHEDDING OF HIS BLOOD. HE BOUGHT IT ALL. AND NOW, BECAUSE HE'S THE OWNER OF IT ALL BY SHEDDING HIS OWN BLOOD FOR IT ALL, NOW HE SETS AS A KING, AS A JUDGE OVER ALL THE EARTH. AND NOW he has the right to determine who he can extend mercy TO AND WHO NOT. THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ELECT OF GOD. THE WHITE THRONE judgment has nothing to do with THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. LISTEN, &gt;&gt; THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT IS WHERE KING AND QUEEN CHRIST AND HIS BRIDE, THE PREDESTINATED SIEGING OF GOD, SIT AND JUDGE EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE EARTH. AND BECAUSE HE PAID THE PRICE TO GET HER, HE BOUGHT IT ALL. NOW, HE'S GOING TO EXTEND MERCY TO THOSE who can receive mercy. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THIS MESSAGE, WE DON'T KNOW THE BIBLE. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY BIBLE VERSES you memorize. Amen. You and I did NOT KNOW THIS BIBLE. I READ IT FROM THE TIME I WAS A CHILD. I WAS FASCINATED WITH IT. I LOVED IT. AMEN. BUT TILL I COME TO THIS MESSAGE, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS, I DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING EVEN 5 years ago LIKE I KNOW NOW. And today is better than yesterday. &gt;&gt; Because he's continually unveiling himself. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY STOPPING BACK AT A DENOMINATION AND ALL I NEED IS TO BELIEVE JESUS DIED AND I COULD GO TO HEAVEN. LISTEN, WE'RE WE'RE MISSING THE WHOLE POINT OF WHAT GOD'S BEEN DOING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. THAT'S WHY THIS MESSAGE CAME. IT DIDN'T COME SO WE COULD SAY, "WE GOT A PROPHET. WE GOT A PROPHET. WE KNOW MORE THAN YOU." IT'S SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY COME INTO REDEMPTION TO COME BACK TO WHAT WE WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE. &gt;&gt; And if we SEE THE MESSAGE AS WELL, MAYBE THEY'RE OVERPROMOTING A MAN and then brother Benham and then they GOT SOME WEIRD IDEA. LISTEN, YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THE MESSAGE IS ABOUT IF THAT'S YOUR THINKING. The message was TO BRING THE FINAL FINAL BIT OF REDEMPTION BACK TO THE SEED OF GOD, BACK TO THE RACE THAT WAS LOST WHEN Adam fell. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THERE'S NOTHING TO PREACH BUT this message. &gt;&gt; DENOMINATIONAL DOCTRINE WON'T DO anybody any good. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that there won't be those who receive mercy at the white throne judgment because of their respect FOR THE WORD OF GOD. IT WILL. SO IN THAT FACET, IT'LL DO GOOD, BUT NOT FOR REDEMPTION. Cuz redemption is for the fallen &gt;&gt; seed of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. THAT'S WHY I'LL ONLY PREACH THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; I'm not GOING TO GO BACK TO PREACHING LIKE THE DENOMINATION. SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY, "ALL I WANT IS A SIMPLE GOSPEL MESSAGE." I'M GIVING YOU THE GOSPEL MESSAGE TODAY. CAN IT BE ANY MORE SIMPLE THAN THAT? &gt;&gt; This is what THE MESSAGE IS UNVEILED. WHAT IT'S ALL BEEN ABOUT. THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID AT the opening of the seals, THE VEIL CAME OFF OF MY BIBLE. IT BECAME A NEW BIBLE. [Applause] &gt;&gt; GOD, HELP ME TO ONLY PREACH THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's what has life. It's what brings life. It is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the headship restored back to us. It is the head of the family that's come in our midst. It is the bridegroom who's wanting to marry us. You say, "Well, I thought he was my brother." Don't forget the woman was Adam's sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be great. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Sarah happened to be Abraham's sister, too. &gt;&gt; So, I can marry my brother, &gt;&gt; and my brother is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen, friends. Now, let's go. Let's finish up here in Revelation chapter 5. Revelation 5. Revelation 5:5. And hope maketh not ashamed. I'm sorry. I'm in Romans 5. Revelations 5. Just because it starts with an R doesn't mean you're in the right book. I need to pay closer attention. Revelation 5:5. No, I'm going to go to 51. And I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal the seven seals. &gt;&gt; And I saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof. And no man, &gt;&gt; what word was that? &gt;&gt; What are they looking for? &gt;&gt; It didn't say person. didn't say being. It didn't say creature. &gt;&gt; And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. We've been through this, but I'd like just to slow down for a minute and take a look at this. This is such an important passage of scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is all the host of heaven. This is taking place in the end time in the heavenly realm at the throne of God. This isn't a trivial thing. &gt;&gt; And just because we read over something and don't understand it doesn't mean we should throw it in the trash can as unimportant. Listen, this this is a cry that's going out in all of heaven that affects the heaven, the earth, and everything under the earth. Amen. Because there's a book in the right hand of him that sit on the throne. And that's God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's got a book in his hand and a strong angel proclaims with a loud voice, "Who wants to come and take the book?" &gt;&gt; No. Because a lot of people wanted to come and take the book. &gt;&gt; Who is worthy? &gt;&gt; Oh, remember when brother Jason was preaching here last week, there was some things he was getting into and I was in my seat saying, "God, make him stop. Make him stop. Make him stop." And I'm glad God honored my prayers. I had to apologize to him afterwards. Brother, I said if you felt the pull stop, that was me. It was a full stop and it pushing back it. But oh, I was so blessed when I heard it. Hey, who is worthy to take the book? And there goes a search and no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book. Listen, if God's whole purpose was just to get you saved to go to heaven, there was already men in heaven. But still, there was a problem. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; there was still a problem. &gt;&gt; Redemption wasn't finished. &gt;&gt; And there was men in heaven. &gt;&gt; So if God's destination for you is heaven, then what's the point of Revelation chapter 5? &gt;&gt; No man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. They weren't even able to look at it. Nobody had this worthiness. And we know that the lamb is the worthy one. And it says, "And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book, neither to look thereon." And brother Bram says this in the sixth seal. That's the reason John wept. Because if no one could get the book, all creation, everything was gone. What is this book? It's the book that Adam lost. It was right to dominion and rulership over the earth. The earth was given as an inheritance to man. And man lost it. And God wants to give it back to man. But what man? &gt;&gt; God man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His family, his race, his attributes that have come into the flesh. No one could get that book. All cre, if no one could get the book, all creation, everything was gone. She just simply turned back to atoms and molecules and so forth and cosmic light and not even be creation person, nothing else. Cuz Adam lost the rights of that book. He forfeited it when he listened to his wife and she listened to Satan's reasoning instead of God's word. Oh man, that's so good. Friends, &gt;&gt; John standing here, John has witnessed the life of Jesus Christ. He witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. He saw Christ after he resurrected. John was the first one actually to look into the tomb at Jesus's resurrection. &gt;&gt; He made the he looked in and he saw the napkin and he saw the things folded up. But he waited and Peter was the first to go in and then John went in and it said when John went in, he looked and he believed. Who was the first person to believe in the resurrection? John. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John believed in Jesus. And he was actually the one, Amen, that really didn't really forsake Jesus all that much because he was the one that followed him into the judgment. He's the one that got Peter into the judgment. John was super close to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; John saw his death. John was a witness of the resurrection. He saw him and talked to him after his resurrection. Amen. He was at the day of Pentecost and he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. God had wrought many miracles and signs and wonders by his hand. He had been imprisoned and led out and all this other stuff that had happened to him. But now at the end of his life, Amen, he sees a book in the right hand of him that sits on the throne. Amen. And nobody was able to look at it. Nobody was able to touch it. Nobody was able to loose the seals. And he begins to weep much. And brother Ram says he was weeping because he knew if nobody could TAKE THAT BOOK, ALL creation was lost. But listen, listen. &gt;&gt; JOHN WASN'T LOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; JOHN WAS SAVED. &gt;&gt; JOHN WAS BORN AGAIN. JOHN HAD THE GENUINE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. JOHN, LISTEN, JOHN WAS AN APOSTLE. JOHN WAS A DISCIPLE. JOHN WAS A WITNESS OF THE RESURRECTION. JOHN'S SALVATION WAS SECURE. JOHN WAS NOT GOING TO DIE. JOHN WAS HEAVENBOUND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S SAVED. HE'S REDEEMED. HE'S BORN AGAIN. HE'S WASHED FROM HIS SINS. HE'S RESTORED IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD. HE'S GOT ALL OF THIS GOING FOR HIM. AND WHEN HE SEES THAT NOBODY CAN TAKE THE BOOK, THIS MAN WHO'S SAVED AND GOING TO HEAVEN IS WEEPING WITH ALL OF HIS MIGHT BECAUSE HE KNOWS UNLESS SOMEBODY TAKES THAT ALL IS LOST. WHAT'S LOST? YOU'RE NOT LOST, JOHN. YES. REDEMPTION IS LOST. THE PURPOSE OF CREATION IS LOST. THE PURPOSE OF THE GARDEN IS LOST. WHAT GOD HAD IN HIS MIND, IT'S ALL LOST IF NOBODY TAKES THAT BOOK. &gt;&gt; I HOPE YOU SEE THIS MESSAGE IS EVERYTHING. IT'S THE CAPPING OF THE GOSPEL. IT'S THE FULFILLING OF GOD'S PURPOSE. IT'S THE REVELATION OF WHAT IT'S ALL BEEN ABOUT. [Music] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; JOHN SAVED. JOHN BORN AGAIN. JOHN FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. JOHN WITH GIFTS OPERATING IN HIS LIFE. JOHN WHO'S SEEN IT ALL. JOHN WHO WROTE THE BIBLE. JOHN STANDING HERE WEEPING BECAUSE ALL IS LOST. HE'S NOT LOST. HIS SOUL IS NOT LOST. BUT THE INHERITANCE IS LOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Oh friends, I hope you can see how powerful this message is. There is nothing that will give rapturing faith like this truth &gt;&gt; cuz everybody else wants to be saved and go to heaven. &gt;&gt; But God's looking for a people who want his will, can catch his mind, that he can whisper love secrets in their ear, a little sweetheart he can tell what redemption's really all been about. And one WHO WILL GET EXCITED AND ONE WHO WILL WEEP WHEN IT'S NOT COMING. ONE WHO WILL BE THRILLED WHEN IT'S COMING. ONE WHO WILL BE LIKE JOHN, WHO'S A TYPE OF THE BRIDE, WILL SAY, "OH, NO. I'M SAVED. I'M GOING TO HEAVEN. I'M SECURE." BUT NO, THE PLAN OF GOD'S NOT FINISHED. IT CAN'T STOP LIKE THIS. REDEMPTION IS NOT OVER. JESUS DIED FOR MORE THAN THIS. &gt;&gt; HE DIED FOR ALL THAT ADAM LOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "And there's a price, and that's redemption. There's some price for redemption." And there was nobody could do it. So he he made his laws his own laws of a kinsman redeemer. Then they could find nobody. Every man was born of sex, born after sexual desire. He was in the original sin, Satan and Eve. So he could not do it. There's nothing in him. No holy pope, priest, doctor, divinity, or whoever he might be. He was nobody worthy. And he couldn't be an angel because it had to be a kinsman. &gt;&gt; He had to be a man. THEN GOD HIMSELF BECAME A KINSMAN BY TAKING ON HUMAN FLESH THROUGH THE VIRGIN birth and he shed his blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. What? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What What ARE THEY LOOKING FOR IN ROMAN REVELATION CHAPTER 5? AMEN. WHEN BROTHER BENHAM COMES IN REVELATION CHAPTER 5 BACK IN 1960 and 61 when he's preaching on the revelation OF JESUS CHRIST, HE STARTS TO BRING IN the kinsman redeemer and he starts to bring IN RUTH AND BOAZ. AND HE STARTS TO SHOW THAT REVELATION FIVE IS BOAZ AT THE GATE. BOAZ PAID THE PRICE OF REDEMPTION. BOAZ WAS REDEEMING BACK ALL THAT WAS LOST, GETTING THE WHOLE INHERITANCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT REVELATION CHAPTER 5 IS ALL ABOUT. REVELATION CHAPTER 5 IS, IS THERE A MAN? IS THERE A KINSMAN REDEEMER? IT HAS TO BE A MAN, NOT AN ANGEL. A MAN, NOT A CHERUB. A MAN, NOT A CREATURE, A MAN, NOT A SHEEP, A MAN, NOT A GOAT. THERE'S GOT TO BE A MAN WHO'S A KINSMAN WHO CAN PLAY THE PART OF REDEEMER, WHICH MEANS HE HAS TO BE WORTHY AND HE HAS to be able. &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAN THAT WAS WORTHY AND ABLE AND THAT'S THE MAN CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. In this kinsman redeemer role, somebody has to step forward who's worthy. Somebody who's able, somebody who's a near kinsman. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the near kinsman has to be willing to pay the price of redemption. &gt;&gt; And when he pays the price of redemption, then he can take back all that was lost. &gt;&gt; This is Revelation chapter 5 is a legal proceeding, friends. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a courtroom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a courtroom. It's a legal proceeding. And there's a declaration and the judge on the bench is holding the book. But listen, that's not his book. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He gave it to Adam. He gave it to his son. He wants his son to have it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's just holding it until the last Adam can take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's holding it secure, keeping it from the squatter so he has no squatters rights so he can't manipulate it. And he's holding in his hand, waiting for the one who can come and take it. It's a court proceeding. And the strong angel is calling for the one who meets all the requirements and can take the book. Amen. And John, when he finds that there's no one in heaven or earth or under the earth, he starts weeping because he knows all is lost. Oh, I get so excited when I read all of this. God is so good. Let's go down to verse 5. And one of the elders saith unto me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals. I want you to look at these titles, friends. Look, look. Judah was the king tribe where the governor and the king was going to come from. It's prophesied. David, Amen, was the king after God's own heart. And he was given a promise that thy seed shall rule forever. So there has to be a seed of David. Amen. And there has to be the head of Judah who's the governor. Who's the seed of David? Listen, this is not calling for an angel. This is about an earthly inheritance. This has to be a man who can fulfill these requirements. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David. And he hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth unto all the earth. Amen. When he hears a lion's coming, and he hears the root of David's coming, offspring of David, he looks and what he sees is a bleeding, bruised, beaten lamb, because why? He has to show that he's worthy to take the book. AMEN. ALL OF THIS IS SYMBOLOGY. THE WHOLE BOOK IS SYMBOL. BROTHER SAID BOOK OF REVELATION is a book of symbols. Amen. He's not an animal standing there. But what we see in the scripture is the description of the one who's worthy. And the one who's worthy is the one who became the sacrifice. The one who paid the price of the penalty. The beaten, bruised, bloody. It wasn't a lamb standing there. It was a lamb cut to ribbons and bruised and battered and bleeding all over. He was standing there. WHAT WAS HE SHOWING? I'M WORTHY. I PAID THE PRICE. I PAID FOR REDEMPTION. I'VE ALREADY PAID FOR THIS BOOK. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH, THE KING TRIBE. HE WAS THE ROOT AND OFFSPRING OF DAVID. AND HE WAS THE LAMB OF GOD that made him worthy by paying the price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a courtroom proceeding. &gt;&gt; He meets all the qualifications. Verse seven. and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. That book had been lost for thousands of years since Adam lost it in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Listen, Adam wasn't walking around with a book under his arm. &gt;&gt; It was the inheritance of the earth. It was the right to rule and bring forth the family of God &gt;&gt; that was lost. And he come the last Adam, the first begotten, the head of the family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. You realize why the lamb had to come forth? Why the man? Behold the man. Behold the man who bled and died. Behold the man who was no fault. Behold the man. That's why the whole drama plays out that he goes to the one who sits on the throne and takes it out of his hand because God, Amen. God is an eternal spirit. He's holding the book waiting for a man that can take back what he had given to man. And when no man was worthy, God says, "Well, I'll make my own man and I'll become my own man and I'll come and become my own son to pay it back." AND SO NOW THAT SON COMES TO THE ETERNAL FATHER, AMEN, TO TAKE BACK THE BOOK. LISTEN, this is not happening in reality as a lamb going up THERE AND BITING IT OR STICKING his hooves together and trying to NO, THIS IS ALL SYMBOLOGY SHOWING US WHAT'S TAKING PLACE in the heavenly realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's taking back the right to rule. He's taking back the inheritance of the earth. And he's taking back the family of God, the right to bring forth the family of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Bam says, notice he's not an animal. He's talking about what we just read. He took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. Who was it? The owner, the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand. And no angel, no angelic being, nothing else could take the place. And this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand. What was it, brother? This is the most sublime thing in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Did the prophet say that? Amen. &gt;&gt; A act that not an angel, not nothing could do it. And the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. What is it now? It belongs to the lamb. &gt;&gt; Adam lost it. But the lamb now has taken it back. &gt;&gt; When brother says this is the most sublime thing in the scripture, that statement is a startling statement. That means in all the scripture, brother Brandon said this is the most sublime thing in the scripture. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't say Calvary was &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Now, no doubt Calvary was a sublime thing, &gt;&gt; a wonderful thing, but he said this is the most sublime. &gt;&gt; And when we say statements like that, it can make people nervous if somehow we're downplaying Calvary. But remember, John had already been through the Calvary experience and been born again and he's still weeping. &gt;&gt; Showing Calvary was for a purpose. And if you don't fulfill the purpose of Calvary, THEN ALL IS LOST. AMEN. AMEN. So what becomes more important? And I don't mean to downplay. So please just listen to me. What becomes more in purpose? Amen. What might becomes more important? The act or the purpose of the act or the thing the act was for? Amen. And Calvary was for a purpose. making the purpose more valuable than Calvary. He was willing to give his LIFE AND SHED HIS BLOOD FOR THIS PURPOSE. MAKING THIS PURPOSE when he comes and takes the purpose. Amen. Fulfilling the reason he went to Calvary. The reason he came flesh the reason he went to Calvary. The reason he paid THE PRICE, IT WAS ALL SO THAT HE COULD TAKE THE BOOK AND BRING BACK EVERYTHING THAT ADAM LOST. AND THAT'S WHY JOHN IS WEEPING. He's saved. HE'S SEEN CALVARY. SEEN RESURRECTION. HE'S BORN AGAIN. HIS GIFTS OPERATING IN HIS LIFE. HE'S WEEPING BECAUSE ALL IS LOST. CALVARY WAS FOR THIS PURPOSE. WITHOUT THIS PURPOSE, WE HAVEN'T FULFILLED THE PURPOSE OF CALVARY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS IS WHY THIS MESSAGE HAS COME AT THE END TIME TO TAKE THE VEIL OFF TO BRING US TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHO WE ARE AND WHO GOD IS AND WHAT GOD'S BEEN DOING. &gt;&gt; Took a prophet to unveil this. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now it belongs to the lamb. Who is the lamb? Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Who is the lamb? The man. &gt;&gt; The last Adam. &gt;&gt; The head of the family. &gt;&gt; My big brother. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Making me an heir of God and a joint heir &gt;&gt; of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he took the book, let's just back up. I got to slow down. When he rose, &gt;&gt; I rose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he sitted in heavenly places, I'm seated in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; And when he took the book, &gt;&gt; I took the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not physically, not anything like that, but I'm part of him. He took it for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He took it for the whole family. He took it for everybody in the book, everybody that was part of the inheritance. He took it for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's laws required. He's the one that holds it. God's law required a kinsman redeemer. And the lamb came out boldly. I am their kinsman. I am their redeemer. I now have made intercession for them. And now I've come to claim their rights for them. Amen. Amen. I've come to claim their rights. And that they have a right to everything that lost in the fall. And I've paid the price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to read this next quote. He says, "No one, no one could do it. And he walks right up to the right hand of God and took the book out of his hand and claimed his rights. I have died for them. I am their kinsman redeemer. I am the mediator. My blood was shed. I have become man. And I did this in order to get the church back again. And one I for the one I foresaw before the foundation of the world. I have purposed it. I spoke that it would be there. And nobody was able to take it. But I went down and done it myself. I am their kinsman. I become kin folks. And he takes the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. my representation, my headship, MY LORD, MY big brother, the head of the family that I'm part of. &gt;&gt; By spiritual new birth, the new creation, he's the first of that creation. I'm part of that creation &gt;&gt; under his headship. &gt;&gt; Oh, listen. WHEN HE TOOK THE BOOK, I wish I'd been there. &gt;&gt; And I know it didn't happen like that. It's not like you could be there. This happened before the foundation of the world in the mind of God. But listen, friends. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Listen, he took it for all of us. &gt;&gt; Not one of us could approach to that throne. Not one of us could go in that presence. Not one of us could touch that book. Amen. But he came and paid the price. He became us. Paid the price so that he could go into that presence. That he could stand there and he could be judged and he could be found with no fault. And he could be saying, "I am the lion of the tribe of Judah. I have the rights. I am the seed and offspring of David. I have the rights. And I am the lamb that was a substitutionary offering. I SHED MY BLOOD. I BOUGHT IT BACK. I HAVE EVERY RIGHT NOW TO take the book. &gt;&gt; AND LISTEN, I COULDN'T DO IT, BUT HE COULD do it. And when he did it, he did it for ME AND ON MY BEHALF. AND I GET THE BENEFIT OF him taking it. AND I WANT TO SAY HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HE TOOK THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THIS ISN'T SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE, FRIENDS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE LIVING IN RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOING ON ALL AROUND US. WE'RE PART OF IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; In the breach, HE SAID, "THE TRUMPET OF GOD SHALL SOUND. THE LAST TRUMP WILL BLAST FORTH." THE SAME TIME THE LAST ANGEL'S giving his message and the last seal IS OPEN, THAT LAST trumpet will sound and the redeemer comes forth to take his redeemed possession, his church blood washed. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go down here to verse 13. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, "Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto him that siteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever." &gt;&gt; WHO IS THAT? THIS IS THE WEEPING ONE. BEFORE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, he's weeping BECAUSE ALL IS LOST. BUT NOW, THERE WAS A MAN that could come forth AND TAKE THE BOOK. AND WHEN HE TOOK THE BOOK, ALL HEAVEN ERUPTED IN PRAISE. And when HEAVEN ERUPTED IN PRAISE, AS SOON AS THERE WAS A PAUSE, WE HEAR JOHN, WHICH IS A TYPE OF THE BRIDE. HE SAID, "EVERYTHING THAT EVER WAS in heaven, on earth, UNDER THE EARTH, IN THE SEA, AND ALL THAT THERE IS, HEARD ME." LISTEN, THAT MUST BE SOME SORT OF PRAISING THAT HE WAS DOING, SAYING, "BLESSING." AMEN. He He said, "Oh, praise God." I want to read it the way he said it. He said, uh, blessing and honor AND GLORY AND POWER BE UNTO HIM THAT SITETH UPON the throne and unto the lamb FOREVER AND EVER. OH, PRAISE GOD. HE TOOK THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. THIS IS REDEMPTION. PRAISE GOD. WHAT ADAM LOST HAS COME BACK INTO THE HANDS OF MAN. BECAUSE THERE WAS A MAN WHO PAID THE PRICE. THERE WAS A MAN WHO SAT THROUGH INTERCESSION THROUGH SEVEN CHURCH AGE TO MAKE SURE HIS BRIDE WAS SECURE. BUT AT THE END TIME, HE CAME FORTH TO TAKE HIS POSSESSION, HIS INHERITANCE, HIS RIGHTS. AND HE'S COME DOWN TO UNITE WITH HIS BRIDE. PRAISE GOD. HE TOOK THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; WHO? The man. Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Our headship, our king, our Lord, our brother. &gt;&gt; He took the book. That's what this message is all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; People get caught up in he said this here and this here and the rules about this and can I do this AND LISTEN THAT'S THAT'S NOT WHY THE MESSENGER CAME. &gt;&gt; This is why he came &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE WERE LOCKED DOWN IN DENOMINATIONALISM. WE WERE BLINDED AND DARKENED AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHERE WE CAME FROM, WHERE WE WERE GOING, WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT. AND THE MESSENGER CAME TO TAKE GOD THROUGH THAT MESSENGER TOOK THE VEIL OFF THE BIBLE. SO WE WOULD UNDERSTAND WHERE WE CAME FROM, WHY WE'RE FALLEN, WHAT WE LOST, HOW IT GETS REDEEMED, WHO REDEEMED IT. AND SO THAT WE COULD REALIZE WE live in the day it's redeemed. It's redeemed. IT'S REDEEMED. WHICH MEANS I'M REDEEMED. I'M REDEEMED. I'M REDEEMED. AND NOT ONLY THAT, HE CAME DOWN A MIGHTY ANGEL. HE came down with an OPEN BOOK IN HIS HAND TO DO WHAT? HE CAME DOWN TO UNITE WITH WHAT HE REDEEMED. AND THE FIRST PART OF THAT UNITING TAKES PLACE WITH A BRIDE, A PEOPLE THAT'S ON THE EARTH AT THE TIME OF THIS COMING. AND HE UNITES with them first. &gt;&gt; And this is uniting time and signs. &gt;&gt; This is what the message is about. &gt;&gt; Everything else feeds into this. This is the purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise almighty God. Get in the breach. He said, "Watch. Look at this. My broke the seals. Revealed the mysteries. Revealed them where? To the last church age. The only one that's living. The rest of them sleeping." He said, "If he comes in the first watch, second watch, third watch, on down to the seventh watch." In the seventh watch, there went out a commander call. Behold, the bridegroom cometh. What &gt;&gt; we're talking about a Revelation chapter 5, chapter 6, chapter 8, chapter 10. And he said in the seventh watch there went on a command when when he broke the seals &gt;&gt; when he revealed the mystery &gt;&gt; there was a call that the bridegroom cometh. &gt;&gt; Listen friends this is what taking the book is all about. &gt;&gt; It's about a marriage. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom call now came and said now come out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come out from her. Come out of the city. Come out. You fair young virgins. Come out. You that have the Holy Ghost, come out and meet who? Come out to who? The friend of the bridegroom made the call. But the call was not to come to the friend of the bridegroom. The call was the bridegroom cometh. COME YOU OUT TO MEET HIM. &gt;&gt; THE CALL AMEN. THROUGH MALACHI 4. THE CALL WAS TO MEET THE BRIDEGROOM where between there and here. In between we COME OUT OF THE DENOMINATIONAL CITIES. HE COMES DOWN from glory. We meet up in the MIDDLE AND THEN HE TAKES US INTO THE MARRIAGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S TIES TOGETHER ALL THE PARABLES THAT BROTHER BRENNAN WAS TEACHING AND EVERYTHING THAT HE WAS SHOWING. IT ALL POINTS TO THE SAME THING. TAKING THE BOOK IS TAKING HIS BRIDE, taking his church, the ones that he's redeemed, the ones THAT HE PAID THE PRICE FOR TO GO BACK AND LIVE AS ADAM AND EVE AGAIN UPON THE EARTH TO REESTABLISH GOD'S ORIGINAL PURPOSE AND PLAN. &gt;&gt; OH, praise God. No wonder John was shouting. &gt;&gt; He says, see, he's done his kinsman work. You know what the kinsman work was to testify before the elders? You remember Boaz kicking off his shoes and so forth. He's done all this now. Now he comes to take his bride. Amen. He comes now as a king. He's looking for his queen. &gt;&gt; I thought he was taking a book. &gt;&gt; No, he's coming for his book. &gt;&gt; He comes with THE REVELATION OF THE BOOK LOOKING FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE BOOK LOOKING TO UNITE WITH THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; He's a king. He's looking for HIS QUEEN. AMEN. WHAT KING? THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH. THE ROOT AND OFFSPRING OF DAVID. THE ONE WHO PAID THE PRICE, THE ONE WHO TOOK THE BOOK. NOW HE'S coming looking for his queen. &gt;&gt; And this book is the whole secret of it wrapped up around seven seals. Oh, brother. Seven seals waiting for him to come. Let's go to Revelation 10 now. Verse one. We'll finish here. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud. Brother Venom said, "No other but Christ it could be." &gt;&gt; He also told us the seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Christ comes while the seventh angel's on earth. &gt;&gt; But look how he comes clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head and his face was it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth. And cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. He came with a little book. Brother Ram said, the same book that was closed in Revelation chapter 5 is open and what did he bring? He's tore the seals of he's come and brought the revelation of what the mystery has been all about. and he brought it with him. &gt;&gt; He brought it down with him &gt;&gt; and he declared it through a prophet. But the prophet's not the one who had it. The prophet's not the one who took it. The prophet's not the one who opened the seals. The prophet was just a mouthpiece of Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the one who took the book and loosed the seals and brought down and opened, which means revealed, unveiled book of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let's go down to verse eight. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said, "Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth." And I went unto the angel and said unto him, "Give me the little book." And he said unto me, "Take it and eat it up. I shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up. And it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." &gt;&gt; Amen. This mystery of redemption, this mystery of the entire Bible, this purpose of God that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world, Christ brought it as an open book. And when he come down to earth, he had to do it at the time the seventh angel was on. So we know when this happened. This happened in 1963. And he brought access to the book down to earth. But then there was a voice from heaven. The same one that I believe that told John to come a little higher in chapter three. He said, "I will show you things to come." Now there's another voice from heaven that says unto him, "Take the book out of the hand of the mighty angel." &gt;&gt; And he went to the angel and he said, "Give me the book." And the mighty says, "Take it." And it says, "And he John took the book." That means there's another taking of the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just chapter five taking of the book. &gt;&gt; There's a Revelation chapter 10 taking of the book. &gt;&gt; And who took the book? &gt;&gt; The unworthy John. &gt;&gt; The one who was not worthy. The one who was not able. The one who couldn't touch it. The one who couldn't open the seals. The one who couldn't read it, the one who couldn't even look at it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The one who was weeping because all was lost saw the lamb come forth and take the book. And now the mighty angel brings it down in Revelation 10. And after and we have Revelation 10:7. Now there's a voice that says, "Now John, you take the book." &gt;&gt; How is John going TO TAKE THE BOOK? HE CAN ONLY GET IT FROM THE mighty angel. Amen. He can only GET IT FROM CHRIST. HE'S GOT TO GO. WHY? WHY DID CHRIST COME WITH AN OPEN BOOK FOR? HE'S COME AS a king looking for his queen. He's looking for SOMEBODY FROM THE BOOK TO UNITE WITH THE BOOK AND SOMEBODY TO GIVE THE BOOK TO. WHY? CUZ HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S HEIR TO THE INHERITANCE. BUT HE BOUGHT IT BACK FOR THE FAMILY. AND DON'T FORGET, WE ARE JOINT HEIRS WITH CHRIST OF THIS INHERITANCE THAT ADAM LOST. AND SO NOW HE'S COME LOOKING FOR HIS QUEEN. WHAT'S HE LOOKING FOR? THE OTHER CO-AIR. I'VE GOT SOMEBODY ELSE. I BOUGHT THIS BACK FOR THE FAMILY OF GOD. I'M LOOKING FOR THE FAMILY OF GOD. HOW WILL HE FIND THE FAMILY OF GOD? HE SOUNDS SEVEN THUNDERS IN A MYSTERY WAY. AND THOSE WHO HEAR THE THUNDERS AND UNDERSTAND THE THUNDERS ARE JOHN. AMEN. IN A MYSTERY FORM. AND THOSE WHEN YOU HEARD AND WHEN YOU HEARD THE MYSTERIES REVEALED, YOU HEARD HIM CALLING YOUR NAME OUT OF THE BOOK. AND YOU CAME TO THE MIGHTY ANGEL AND SAID, "I BELIEVE THAT MESSAGE. I BELIEVE THAT'S THE TRUTH. I BELIEVE YOU ARE HERE. AND I WANT TO BE PART OF YOUR PROGRAM. &gt;&gt; I want TO BE YOUR JOINT HEIR. I WANT TO BE YOUR WIFE. I WANT TO UNITE WITH YOU. AND I WANT YOU TO BE my headship. &gt;&gt; MY FIRST HEADSHIP IS FAILED. THE CHURCH HEADSHIP IS FAILED. BUT I WANT THIS MIGHTY ANGEL CHRIST TO BE MY HEADSHIP. THE ONE WITH THE mystery revealed. &gt;&gt; And he comes to whisper love secrets in her ears. This is what I've been doing. This is what I've done all along. This is how I've done it. This is why this. And this is why that. And this is why that and now I've brought it down. &gt;&gt; I brought it down to the joint &gt;&gt; hes. &gt;&gt; He didn't keep it for himself. He didn't take it for himself. It was his to take. He took it to take back Adam, but not for himself alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he will rule and reign on the earth. And we will rule and reign with him. Yes. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WAS SAID AS SOON AS HE TOOK THE BOOK THAT HE will rule and reign and we he's made us kings and priests and we will rule and reign on earth with him. &gt;&gt; HE BROUGHT US BACK TO what Adam lost when he took the book. But old friends, he's looking for the joint heir of the book. The joint heir of the book is those who hear the bridegroom call &gt;&gt; through Malachi 4 and leave the city and run not to meet the friend of the bridegroom, but the one who will run past the friend of the bridegroom &gt;&gt; and go embrace the bridegroom, &gt;&gt; which is Christ, the last Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is about more than we ever thought it was about. Friends, this is what this message came for. &gt;&gt; Now in union with Christ, now he's living his life through us. Now in a redemption, now he says you must prophesy again. &gt;&gt; Now when you take the book, &gt;&gt; you prophesy again. &gt;&gt; And that is what I have done for the last two hours. &gt;&gt; I have prophesied the contents of that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; If you wanted to know what's in the book, &gt;&gt; you just heard it cuz I just prophesied again. &gt;&gt; And that's all of our job is to declare this glorious gospel. Amen. You say, "Declare the gospel." People think of Calvary. Calvary was for a purpose. The gospel purpose is the good news. And the good news IS WE'RE GOING BACK TO GOD'S ORIGINAL POSITION, original plan for HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED RIGHT NOW in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Revelation 19. This is the last scripture I want to read. Oh, I've got it overhead. &gt;&gt; So, I fell at his feet to worship. This is the angel that told him all things. This represents Brother Brandon. And he said unto me, "See thou do it not. I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What does it mean to prophesy again? testify of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who? The last Adam. &gt;&gt; The one who bought it back. The one who purchased it, the kinsman redeemer, the bridegroom, the one who came and brought an open book that's available to the co-airs today. &gt;&gt; Testimony also means witness &gt;&gt; to witness like in court. And that's what we're doing as we take this book. We're witnessing of Jesus Christ. And we're saying, "Behold the man." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I couldn't do it. I wasn't worthy. I was lost. There was no hope. But he took the book. &gt;&gt; And after he took the book, he brought it down and gave access to the co-airs. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I'm part of that. &gt;&gt; I just want to leave you with one last thought if I may. God has always through the Bible been doing absolutely marvelous things, &gt;&gt; unbelievable things in his plan of redemption. But you know the majority of it went unnoticed by the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Bam told us at the opening of the seals he said don't look for great big things. &gt;&gt; He said God hiding in simplicity revealing in the same. comes to the seventh. See, when he says, "How did I know a week ago when I was saying be simple, be simple, it'll be simp how did I know what I was talking about?" &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the way it comes in such a simple way." They walk right over it and they miss it a million miles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you think about Calvary, friends, Jesus Christ came and he lived a miraculous life and he had healing campaigns and he did the things that he did. At the end of his life, he was taken and judged as a criminal, falsely accused, shamed, and crucified. And at the crucifixion, there was quite a stir. There was an earthquake. There was a blackout of the sun. All these things happened. But, you know, there was only a couple people that were even queued in on what was going on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And even the disciples had no understanding of what was happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; None. Do you know the day after the crucifixion? You know the crucifixion was one of the most powerful things that have ever happened on earth for humankind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The greatest act of redemption, the shedding of blood, the the purchase price paid for everything that Adam lost. Amen. Everything we needed to be redeemed back. It was one of the most powerful acts that ever took place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And only a few hundred people or a few thousand people on the whole planet knew about it. &gt;&gt; After that powerful event of God fulfilling his word and how many prophecies were fulfilled in the last few hours of Jesus' life. &gt;&gt; The Bible clicking away. Prophecy one after the other after the other. Then the sun blackened. Then an earthquake. &gt;&gt; You know what happened the next morning? The sun came up and birds started chirping. &gt;&gt; And life went on as usual. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; People went to the well, women exchanged gossip. There might have been a little stir about that blackout of the sun. That was so strange. I That was weird. You think it was a sign, then an earthquake, and maybe it was the stir for a little bit. And then maybe news that Jesus resurrected became a stir, but it all began to fade away. And they would meet at the well and exchange the gospel and go to the market and get hungry and &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just went on as if nothing changed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Only for the believers did their life change. &gt;&gt; Everybody else went on as if nothing changed in their whole life. One of the most monumental things that could ever happen upon this earth just took place and the earth kept spinning. The sun kept coming up. The rain kept falling and people kept getting up and going to work every day. &gt;&gt; Even the disciples in the time of the crucifixion of the resurrection didn't know what to do. They didn't know what was going on. They were confused about what was happening. I can imagine them sitting there for a day in depression and shock and bewildered and not knowing what to do. And one of them says, "You know what? I'm hungry." The other one says, "I'm hungry, too. Let me get something to eat." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They didn't understand what had happened. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They were still uncertain, depressed, yes, I'm sure. Scared, shocked, all of the above. But they fell asleep at night. They woke up in the morning, got hungry, ate, &gt;&gt; life moved on. &gt;&gt; Weeks after the crucifixion, when the news and the gossip faded away, Jerusalem went about its business. &gt;&gt; Church services went on. The priests were offering sacrifices. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it was all dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God had flipped a switch at Calvary. &gt;&gt; And no more substitutionary offerings through lambs and goats and through Jerusalem and through the temple worship. Now it was Christ and him alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they didn't know that. &gt;&gt; They didn't believe it. They kept on offering lambs. They kept on offering goats. They kept on doing their thing. &gt;&gt; One of the most monumental prophecies in all the Bible all the way back in Genesis 3. This was prophesied of &gt;&gt; the first prophecy now fulfilled &gt;&gt; of redemption. &gt;&gt; And the world just keeps going on like nothing happened. Every morning the dogs barked, &gt;&gt; chickens crowed, birds chirped. It all went on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And man kept walking on the earth like everything was as the day before. It was only at the day of Pentecost when the believers got the Holy Ghost. The teacher on the inside that Peter stood up and says, "This is that and this is that and this is that. This is everything fulfilled. This is what was prophesied. This is what was promised and this re this promise is what's come upon US BECAUSE OF CALVARY. THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT. &gt;&gt; A few thousand believed and there was a stir and there was a a revival and there was things going on and then it began to fade away. And only through the believers was the truth carried on. But just because the birds chirped in the morning and the sun came up and the rain fell and people went to work and everything returned as normal doesn't mean it wasn't the most monumental thing that had ever happened on earth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The same thing happened in March of 1963. &gt;&gt; Amen. the fulfillment of the sublime, most sublime scripture &gt;&gt; and all the Bible. &gt;&gt; In that week of meetings in Jeffersonville, Indiana, something incredible was taking place. The lamb was proving he had overcome. He had paid the part of intercessor at the end of churches. He was coming forth to take the book and to loose the seals. AND HE WAS COMING DOWN WITH the open book and the sounding of the seven thunders. And it was him himself coming down. And he proved it at the opening of the seals in that week of meetings in March in Jeffersonville in 1963. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And people were moved and supernatural healings took place AND PEOPLE WERE ASTOUNDED AT THINGS THEY HEARD, &gt;&gt; but they didn't quite get it. &gt;&gt; And Sunday after the meetings, they started driving to Georgia and Alabama. And no doubt they drove along and said, "Those were powerful meetings." And what did he mean by this? I don't quite get it. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. BUT I COULD JUST SENSE THAT IT WAS POWERFUL. SOMETHING HAPPENED. IT was great. And then they woke up in the morning and put on their boots and went to work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Jeffersonville, the the the the news boy with the newspaper, the paper boy. You hear ching ching and he throws the paper and you hear clump clump. Every driveway he's throwing another paper &gt;&gt; as if nothing had happened. &gt;&gt; Don't look for great big things. You'll miss it a million miles. &gt;&gt; We're in the same place those early disciples were in the first church. They knew they had come in contact with the living God. The the fulfillment of pro prophecy. It didn't matter how many millions denied it and how few believed it. They knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were now part of the program, what the program was, where they were in redemption, and that Christ had come. Amen. Emanuel, the lamb of God, and paid the price in Calvary and resurrected. And when he rose, we rose. And Paul starts preaching and going on missionary journeys. But everywhere he goes, he gets a little pocket of people, A LITTLE POCKET OF PEOPLE, a little pocket OF PEOPLE. EVERYBODY ELSE CARRIES ON. The birds chirp, the sun rises, it falls, they go to work. Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; DON'T LOOK AROUND AND SAY NOTHING'S HAPPENING. THE MOST MONUMENTAL THING THAT EVER HAPPENED IN THE SCRIPTURE TOOK PLACE IN THIS GENERATION. AND JUST BECAUSE NOBODY KNEW IT AND THE BIRDS CHIRPED IN THE MORNING AND THE DOGS BARKED AND THE PAPER BOY THREW A PAPER IN YOUR DRIVEWAY, DOESN'T MEAN IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. IT'S THE SAME AS 2,000 YEARS AGO. WE ARE JUST IN THE SPOT THAT THEY WERE THEN. AND ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO'VE RECEIVED IT BY FAITH UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS WORLD. AND IT'S JUST AS POWERFUL TODAY AS IT WAS 2,000 YEARS AGO IN THE FIRST CHURCH IN THE BOOK OF ACTS. WE'RE HERE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW. AND NOW THEY WERE SENT TO PROPHESY AGAIN. JESUS SAID, "WHAT YOU'VE HEARD IN THE INNER CHAMBER, YOU TESTIFY ON THE ROOFTOP. I'LL SEND YOU OUT." AND EVERYBODY THAT RECEIVES YOUR WORD RECEIVES ME. I SEND YOU AS WOLVES AMONG SHEEP. AND HE SENT THEM OUT AFTER AFTER THEY WERE EMPOWERED BY THE HOLY GHOST TO DO WHAT? TO TAKE THIS GOSPEL MESSAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD. WHAT HAS GOD DONE TO US IN THIS GENERATION? IT'S THE SAME THING. EAT THE BOOK AND PROPHESY AGAIN. YOU ARE IN THE SAME SPOT THE FIRST CHURCH WAS. ONLY THEY NEVER MADE IT TO the fullness of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They never made it to the marriage union. But we've come &gt;&gt; and now the book is available &gt;&gt; to you and I &gt;&gt; and you can take and you can come to Christ and Christ can give you this re revelation of his redemption mystery that's been in the whole Bible AND HE CAN SHOW YOU THAT BY TAKING THE MYSTERY. AMEN. Taking the mystery of redemption you are a co-air. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now eat it &gt;&gt; and go prophesy again. And what will happen tomorrow morning? The birds will chirp. &gt;&gt; Sun will come up. &gt;&gt; The neighbor's dog will bark and you'll hear the trash truck coming down the road. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that you haven't become part of the greatest act of redemption that's taking place on the earth right now. And it doesn't mean you haven't come into a marriage union with Christ. And it doesn't mean you haven't uh ran past the voice of the friend of the bridegroom and connected with the bridegroom and entered into an invisible union are connected with your Christ and are feeding on the book. That doesn't mean just because the paper boy throws a paper in your your your mailbox AND THE TRASH TRUCK goes by and dumps your trash doesn't mean it hasn't happened. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brennan means by don't look for big things. Yes, &gt;&gt; we're standing at the most monumental time in the history of mankind. &gt;&gt; God is finishing his work in a people, in a bride, in a church where the first church failed. He's brought this church back to continue on to finish what she didn't finish. And when that's finished, there'll be a resurrection of the sleeping saints. There'll be a glorification of our bodies. There'll be a three and a half year marriage supper. And there'll be a return to a millennial reign. AND WE ARE SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOST PROFOUND EVENT IN HISTORY. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you're going to hear the trash truck in the morning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you might get a little frustrated because they always slam the lid so loud. &gt;&gt; But don't miss it &gt;&gt; because it comes in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't deny it because nobody else sees it. Don't doubt it because it's not worldwide. Don't question it because it's not widely known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It should be known to you. It should be real to you. It should be part of your union. It should be part of your life. It should be the book you're feasting on. It should be Christ you're you're unifying with. It should be something that's real on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; And don't miss it because of the simplicity. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's profound, friends. Brother Benam, you said, "You think something like that would take place in the Vatican or a great place, but it's just like it was the first time &gt;&gt; in a stable, in a manger of hay, a place so humble. &gt;&gt; Nobody would have believed that it was breaking forth in a little brick building on the corner of 8th and Penn Street &gt;&gt; in Jeffersonville, Indiana. But it was just the same. &gt;&gt; Just the same as Christ was being born in a manger in Nazareth. Just the same as he was coming down and revealing his presence through the opening of the seals and the corner and a little brick building on the corner of ETH and Penn. It was every bit as much of fulfillment there as it was 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; And the world is looking there &gt;&gt; and they're missing what's happened right beside them. &gt;&gt; That's what's always happened, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's not miss it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's enjoy it. Let's benefit from it. &gt;&gt; Musicians, if you'll come, please. And Brother Riley, if you'll come. I tell you, friends, I'm more excited about this gospel than I've ever been in my whole life. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how much troubles come on the earth and difficulties and ups and downs and backs and forth. It can't take this reality out of my heart. This is the thing I live for. This is the reality of the message to me. If all we see is restored doctrine, we're going to end up confused. &gt;&gt; If all we see is better teaching, a better way to raise a family, and a better life, we're going to end up train wrecked and derailed somewhere along the way. &gt;&gt; But if we see the revelation of the open book, if we see Christ himself coming to unite with his co-airs and bring the open book, if you haven't seen the other taking of the book, What is the other taking of the book in the book of Revelations? It's when I took the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's when I ate the book. It's when I became one with the book. It's when the book began to live out of me. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5 is when he took his bride &gt;&gt; from the hand of the father. Revelation chapter 10 is when he asked the bride to come into union with him so he can impregnate her. So what he is can come out of John. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophesy again. &gt;&gt; I say God, I want to eat your book. Listen, don't think paper. Don't think scrolls. &gt;&gt; Think of the great mystery revelation God has held in his mind all this time. God, I want to feed on that and become one with that. And I want my life, my words, my actions to testify &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Say, behold. &gt;&gt; Amen. the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our headship, &gt;&gt; our bridegroom, our brother, the one that I'm identified with. My righteousness in him. My salvation is in him. My deliverance is in him. My family is in him. Everything is in him and I'm in him and I'm secure in him. And everything's fine in him. And I'm saved in him. &gt;&gt; Behold the man. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. Can we sing that song Riley I mentioned to you earlier? &gt;&gt; Wonderful, merciful Savior, precious redeemer and friend. Who would have thought that a lamb could rescue the souls of men? &gt;&gt; Oh, you rescue the souls of men. You are the one that we praise. You are the one we adore. Lord, you give the healing and grace our hearts always hunger for. Oh, our hearts always hunger for counselor, comforter, keeper, spirit we long to embrace. You offer hope when our hearts hopeless we lost our way. Oh, we hopeless we lost the way. You are the one that we praise. You are the one we adore. Lord, you give the healing and grace our hearts always hunger for. Oh, our hearts always hunger for Almighty in Father, faithfully loving your own. Here in our weakness, you find us falling before your throne. Oh, we're falling before your throne. You are the one that we praise. You are the one we adore. You give the healing and grace. Our soul is wonderful. [Music] Oh, our hearts always hunger. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Oh, heavenly father, we're so thankful, Lord. God, when it required a man, you became the man. You created a body to dwell in, Lord, that you could reconcile us to yourself in the flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ. Oh God, how we love you and thank you for your plan of redemption. Lord, it's so beautiful from beginning to end. And I'm so grateful, Lord, to live in the age that we live in the day, Lord, when you've taken the veil off the mystery that you held within yourself, God. How wonderful, how precious, how beautiful. And to think, Lord, by your loving grace, you have called us to be a partaker in this revelation in this hour. God, we stand just as unworthy as John did in Revelation five. Unable and uncapable, worthless, Lord, to be able to redeem ourselves. But oh God, when we needed a lamb, you came forth. When there was a cry for a kinsman redeemer, you came on the scene. You paid the price. You offered yourself in our place. And then you came and you took back all that was lost. God, furthermore, you cleansed us with your word and you came down to unite with us. And now, Lord, at the end time, you're offering that revelation to us. You're offering that revelation of yourself, that picture of redemption, and you're showing us our part in it, Lord. God, how unworthy we are, how incapable we ever were. But God, in you we find worthiness. In you we find redemption. In you we find a kinsman redeemer. In you we find our salvation. In you we find our righteousness. In you we find our worthiness. God I pray there's anyone here Lord who hasn't yet come to you to take the book. God, I pray that it would be it would move beyond mystery form and come down to a living reality in their life where they would come to you and you would share with them the purpose of redemption. And it's all been about them bringing your children back to yourself and back to the place that you predestinated, back to your original picture in Eden. And oh God, how grateful we are that you loved us so. Lord, we devote ourselves to you. We give ourselves to you. We love you. We reject the old headship of our first Adam for first birth, but we gladly run to and embrace and take the headship of the last Adam of our savior and bridegroom, the Lord Jesus Christ. God bless your people. May this word be a living reality inside each one of us. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you, friends. Counselor, comforter, keeper, prayer and we long to embrace. You offer hope when our hearts hopeless be lost away. Oh, we hopeless be lost away. You are the one that we praise. You are the one we adore. You give the healing and grace. Hearts always hunger for. Oh our hearts always hunger for alm mighty infinite father faithfully loving your own. Here in our weakness you find us falling before your throne. Oh, we're falling before your throne. You are the one that we praise. You are the one we adore. You give the healing and grace of hearts always hunger. [Music] Oh, our hearts always hunger for once more. Oh, you are the one that we praise. You are the one we adore. You give the healing and grace our hearts always. [Music] Oh, our hearts always hunger for &gt;&gt; the deed that came. This is what we have been taught by the prophet of God today. All the things that Adam lost now are available unto us. Heidentified the cloud that came as the deed to man again. And again, the deep and pain. Oh, this is what it's all about. Let's lift up our voices together and shout hallelu to our God who has redeemed us by his blood. By his blood the deep. [Music] Oh, this great mystery that was sealed in our day has been made so real. was the abstract titled [Music] the promise God made to Abraham's seed. Seven depths and seven steps that Christ may be formed in me. formed in me. The need that came. Oh, this is what it's all about. Let us lift up our voices together and shout hallelu to our God who's redeemed us by his blood. by his blood. [Music] Oh, and this is what it's all about. Let us lift up our voices together and shout [Music] hallelu to our God who has redeemed us by his blood. By his word, the deep. Here is love vast as the ocean. Loving kindness as the flood. When the prince of life, our ransom, shed for us, his preious blood, who his love will not remember, who can cease to sing his praise. He will never be forgotten. throughout heaven's eternal days. On the mount of crucifixion, fountains open and deep and wide. Through the floodgates of God's mercy float a vast and gracious tide. Grace and love like mighty rivers poured in from above. Heaven's peace and perfect justice. Kiss the guilty world in love. Let me all thy love accept me. Love me ever all my days. Let me seek thy kingom only and my life be to thy praise. Thou alone shall be my glory. Nothing in the world I see. Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me. Thou thyself hast set me free. In thy truth thou dost direct me.
