standing let's take our bibles and turn to revelation chapter one and while you're turning there i'll remind you that this weekend i'll be traveling up uh for services in uh uh in michigan and gregory michigan at brother dan ratliff's church saturday night and sunday morning so we'll be gone i appreciate if you'd be praying for us there and then brother ben siebel will be here taking the service sunday morning so be praying for that service as well and come and pull on the word amen i also want to welcome brother jason ward it's good to have you in service again brother jason's all the way from new zealand he and his wife are here visiting some family but he's certainly no stranger he's been here many times so god bless you brother it's good to see you once again man let's look at gen revelations i'm sorry revelations chapter one i want to begin at verse nine i'd like to continue on with the subject of the seven golden candlesticks let's begin here in uh revelation 1 9. i john who also am your brother and companion and tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ and i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it into the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and under smyrna under pergamus on the thyatira and antisardis unto philadelphia and unto laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with the garment down to foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle now let's jump down to verse 20. read that as well the mystery of the seven stars was thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches amen god bless you as you take your seats and we know that those seven churches represent seven church ages amen so now we see that that one like unto the son of man christ is in the midst of the seven churches or the seven church ages amen amen so we have a picture here of uh of john john here is on the isle of patmos he tells us and while he's there he's caught up in the spirit on the lord's day amen and this spirit on the lord's day is not the sabbath it is not sunday amen it's not a church day but he's been transported into the lord's day which is our day amen so john is in our day and in our day he hears a voice and when he hears a voice the voice speaks as a voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega so we know what voice this is by how he declares himself i am alpha and omega the first and the last what thou seest write in the book and send it to the seven churches and he names those seven churches so we know who the voice is behind him because the voice declares himself as alpha and omega and that's christ but it says i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks so he's determined to see the voice and brother benham in the church age book says something absolutely phenomenal here he says he says he turned to see the voice see he didn't turn to see the person he turned to see the voice because the voice is the word and the word and the voice is the same and christ and the word are the same amen praise god so he turned to see the voice and when he turned to see the voice what he saw was seven golden candlesticks the voice was coming through or from the seven golden candlesticks and he saw one like unto the son of man in the middle of the seven golden candle sticks so christ amen now in the in the end of the ages in the lord's day is standing amen in the midst of seven golden candle sticks fully lit on full display and in this bright form he's now speaking amen this is a picture of christ amen in bright form in the lord's day right there in our bibles praise be to god god is so good amen i want to pull up a power point here frank if you could pull that up for me and i want to let me see here i want to go to this first slide this is what we talked about on sunday when when he comes to the ephesian church age let's turn to chapter 2 and read the first verse in chapter 2 of revelation unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks so the one that has given the message to the seven church ages the one that's giving the message to the ephesian church age is the one with the seven can or seven stars in his hand and the seven and walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and when brother branham comes to this in in in the church age book he recites seven golden candlesticks and he says in exodus 25 31 so brother banham immediately takes us to exodus 25 when he begins talking about the seven seven golden candlesticks in exodus 25 is where moses receives the commission from the lord to build the seven golden candlesticks amen let's read that together let's go to exodus 25 and read that together and get this picture exodus 25. and verse 31 exodus 25-31 and thou shall make a candlestick of pure gold watch that word pure gold all the other furniture in the in the tabernacle and the tabernacle in the wilderness almost all is made of em wood amen overlaid or covered over in gold showing a union of humanity and deity man and mo and all that furniture is made out of em wood but the candle stick has no wood it is pure gold [Music] he says make a candle stick of pure gold a beaten work shall the candlestick be made his shaft and his branches his bowls his knobs his flowers shall be of the same and the six branches shall come out of the side of it three branches out of the candlestick out of the one side and three branches out of the candlestick out of the other side three bowls made like into almonds with nop and a flour in one branch and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch with a knot and a flower so in the six branches that come out of the candle stick and then the candlesticks shall be four bowls made all likened to almonds with their knobs and their flowers and there shall be a knop under two branches of the same and a knop under two branches of the same and an op under two branches of the same according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick their knobs their branches shall be of the same it shall be one beaten work of pure gold and thou shall make the seven lamps thereof and they shall light the lamps thereof and they may give light over against him and he goes on to say let's read verse 38 on and the tongues thereof and the snuff dishes thereof shall be of pure gold of a talent of pure gold shall he make it with all the vessels and look that thou make them after the pattern which was showed thee in the mount so the the pattern for the tabernacle was the pattern of the heavenly vision that moses received when he was on mount sinai and so he was given instructions exactly to make it according to the pattern he was shown so this wasn't the figment of moses's imagination moses was just making a replication of what he saw and what he saw was already a pattern that was set in heaven praise be to god so what he makes we can see by the description it has almonds and knobs and flowers and branches and so we see that it's in the form of a tree amen this seven golden candlesticks is in the form of an almond tree here's an almond tree and we talked about the arm almond is the is the first uh tree to bloom in israel still blooms in winter and it's a sign of the resurrection while everything is still dead it's the first one to come to life announcing that life is coming amen while it's still dead and still winter the petals are five white petals mostly they also have pink five petals showing grace amen because it's only by grace hallelujah so we see that this seven golden candlesticks was fashioned after the pattern that was in heaven moses was given the instructions and he was to make it with almonds flowers knobs and branches amen so we're looking at a replica of a tree praise be to god so sunday we talked about christ being the tree of life amen and the restoration of the bride tree bring the tree of life restored back to him again so we we looked here at john 15. in john 15 4 says abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you except you abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing and this is to me one of the greatest revelations from the scripture that you can ever get is that without me you can do nothing praise be to god if we try to do something without him we'll be an absolute utter failure but he also says with me all things are possible that in him all things are possible without me you can do nothing amen so we must be connected to him and it's got to be his work flowing through us but even here he's speaking of a vine in branches and the branch is bearing forth fruit it's a connection between the believers and christ and the life of christ coming through the branches and bearing fruit amen showing the life that's on the inside is coming through the branch so out of our lives are supposed to be the fruit of the life of christ amen so it goes back to a plant to a tree to a wheat plant to an almond tree to a the tree of life it's these themes that run through the bible amen are consistent all the way through and when we can see the themes we can see the story that he's trying to tell us that he planted a seed and that seed went into darkness and death and through a process he's bringing the seed back through a process and bringing a single seed back to a multiplied form and to bring it back to his garner again this is the story of the whole bible praise be to god again in this quote we're going to finish this quote now out of the church age book he says you know the seven golden candlesticks in exodus 25 31 says thou shall make a candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the candlestick be made his shafts and his branches his bowls as knobs as flowers shall be the same the true church of jesus christ the bride is likened to pure gold it's a he said make it a a candlestick of pure gold and this is how brother branham interprets the pure gold says her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him amen what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her this is the prophet of god declaring this looking at this seven golden candlesticks knowing that they're gold amen they're reflecting the original golden candlestick which is christ christ now reflected in his bride amen male and female she's come out of the original she must be whatever he is the same as the woman in the garden was whatever adam was she is her name was adam she didn't have another name until she left the word she left adam then she got a name amen but originally in god's economy she was him whatever he is she is she is reflecting him she's a reflection or a counterpart of the male and the two together are one and he called their name adam god did not intend for them to be separate he intended for them to be one and christ and his bride are not to be separated that christ and his bride are intended to be one that's why he said to them that overcome in this last age you can sit with me in my throne even as eyes overcome and sit with my father in his throne amen now amen this throne amen is not a seat for one it's a seat for two and the two were one [Music] he's to share everything even making her a joint heir a joint heir this is why when we're looking in the book of esther in the book of esther amen the king says to her ask whatever you will up to half of my kingdom he was a king over 127 provinces from india all the way to ethiopia amen he all of the inhabited world at that time all of the known world at that time was under his control and with with the whole world in his hands he looks at this little queen named esther starr amen that's come to this position by the ordinance of god and he says to her whatever you want i'll give you up to half my kingdom meaning you have half of everything i have making her a joint heir amen so now he says she is pure gold this the the the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness obviously brother branham is not speaking of your flesh he's not talking about your fallen mind he's not talking about the hybrid condition that we find ourselves in he must be talking about something that's deeper than all of this amen maybe a sea gene of god down in the soul that that part of us that was meant to be us from the beginning but now because of the fall in the garden everything went topsy-turvy and got all mixed up amen and now what was meant to be us is coming forth in a form that begins to confuse us and we come with spiritual amnesia not knowing who we really are but the message came to break spiritual amnesia and here in the church age book he's trying to break our spiritual amnesia the part of you that is bride is the seed gene of god the part of you that is bride is the gene of god is that soul that's the part of you that he's speaking of now and it is likened unto pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him that's why we talked on sunday that's why brother bam comes to christ as a mystery of god revealed and he says he says we have the devil's answer not my idea but his not my word but it's not me but him he paid the price amen her identity is found in him amen her her everything is now in him she says i am him i am in him he has paid the price he has called me he has sent a message to me he has given me of his spirit he has quickened me the life it's not me devil don't fight with me anymore it's him and what he is she is to reflect what he has she used to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect so if you start denying what the prophet said then you're trying to deny that the lord is working a perfect work and that his handiwork is anything but perfect in fact and her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god that is a mouthful friends in her this is the bride the bride portion of christ and i want to say it this way the bride portion of christ because i want us to stop thinking about flesh because this bride portion of christ is to be manifest through the flesh but it is not the flesh this flesh has to be changed the spirit has to go and be no more and we get our right theophany spirit at one point and this body must be changed into a glorified body don't think the flesh anymore talk think of the real you the true you the genuine you which is the you and the soul that's the real you because if we don't understand amen it's the it's the it's the bride expression of christ expressing through amen fallen creatures expressing through vessels of clay amen we start to look at the vessel of clay and we in ourselves have trouble believing what brother banh is saying because we're looking at the wrong part of us we're looking at the part that'll be changed or done away with don't look at the temporal part look at the eternal part and if you look at the eternal part you'll understand what the prophet's saying because he's speaking about that eternal part and that eternal part there is no way to have an eternal part without having eternal life and the only thing that has eternal life is god so if there's an eternal part of you it is a part of god within you [Music] and that part of god is not flawed it's not faulted it's not corrupted it's pure perfect unadulterated his handiwork that he's forming and now displaying through fallen creatures [Music] but i love this in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for god has spoken it you don't even have to understand it you don't even have to fathom it you don't even have to be able to put it together you don't even have to explain it you just have to believe that it's true i don't know how it works but i know it's true i know there's something more than my thinking that's driving me there's something more than my emotional realm that's holding me there's something deep in me that wants nothing but to serve god that loves god more than i love anything else there's a reality within me that's more than this part of me that i've i've known all of my life there's something deeper that's been awakened under this message by the baptism of the holy ghost and there's something that i know came from eternity there's something i know that's more than flesh [Music] this this life that's in me is more than what came through my parents through the union of a man there's a life within me there's a reality within me there's a knowing within me there's a faith within me that is more than what was created with an egg and a sperm it's something that come from god she is pure gold pure gold brother branham tells us that gold is a type of deity we know that gold does not corrode and gold does not tarnish like other metals it's a pure element it doesn't have to be mixed with anything else gold is gold and it does not tarnish it does not corrupt let's look at exodus 31 moses was told by god that god would anoint a man actually two men a man and his helper he would anoint them and inspire them to make everything that he was told to make and and when he begins to describe that he says in chapter 31 verse 1 and the lord spake unto moses saying see i have called by name bezalil the son of yuri the son of her the of the tribe of judah and i filled him with the spirit of god and wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge in all manner of workmanship so he called him and then he called his partner over here in verse six and i behold i i have given with him a holy ab the son of a heissa match of the tribe of dan and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted i have put wisdom that they may make all that i have commanded thee now i want you to just watch the description i'm not really interested in and who's making what but the description the tabernacle of the congregation the ark of the testimony and the mercy seat that is there upon and all the furniture of the tabernacle and the table and his furniture and the pure candlestick the only thing that he calls pure in all of this is the pure candlestick he names all the furniture and the pure candlestick with all his furniture and the altar of incense and the altar of burnt offering with his furniture and the laver and his foot and the clothes of the service of the holy garments and he goes on to mention everything even anointing oil that they're to make but when he comes to the candlestick he says and the pure candlestick because the pure candlestick is mixed with nothing else it's just gold oh praise god amen it shows that that candlestick represented christ but in the book of revelation it represents the bride amen and it's showing that these are these are the two expressions or the expression in two forms of god because when god made man he made man after his own image and when he made him amen and placed him in flesh he was a man singular amen man but then within the man was another part of the man that was to come forth as the woman amen and the man and the woman were one one expression and when god said let's make man in our image after our likeness male and female he made them amen then god is going to be expressed in male and in female and this candlestick is going to be a pure candlestick because it's going to be god all the way praise be to god in the restoration of the bride he said otherwise you're going to form what's known to me as a bride i'll go with you and you will be part of me you will be my bride my life will be in your body just like a husband and wife as one person you and i are going to be one and that day you'll know that i am in the father the father and me i and you and you and me what day is that the prophet said that's this day that this is for this day oh i just love that satan gets so angry at that see the oneness of god all that god was afforded to christ all christ was he poured into the church there you are makes them all one so the true church christ and god are all one now look the bride are one tree of life other words like husband and wife is one christ and his bride are one same thing same spirit same work same signs everything else for the works that i do shall you do also in the message investment he said that great tree that great tree of life when he come on earth they chopped it down by a roman spear and hung it on a tree roman tree a cruel cursed tree but in there he redeemed a bride tree the bride tree one just like him he was a pure candlestick he was a pure tree this tree is one just like him that eve tree from the garden of eden the tree that had fallen even the beginning and adam walked out with her now adam comes with the second adam knowing that he had his eyes open to come to receive his eve and now as the prophet said the prophet david said he'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water grant lord that the waters of life will water this bride tree in the last day where all the denominational branches had been pruned by the husband men and now the spirit of god is living anew in the top of the tree which come from the heart of the tree the word granite lord and may they bring forth much fruit so we see this tree this image of a tree praise be to god now i want to get into this next part i'm just all background amen laying a foundation and it's amazing the the testimony that brother ben gave because that testimony ties right into where we're going today so it was just perfect but but if you look at the rest of this quote in the ephesian church age so i'm not going to get in that yet i always have to click back because everybody reads ahead i hate it when somebody takes my punchline you know so so the quote we read where where he says that that uh and out of the ephesians church age when he refers to to exodus 25 and says she's a beaten goal and the flowers are an option and almonds are all the same and he goes on to say she's perfect there's no fault in her amen in her summed up the entirely the wisdom of god and and all those things the very next things he goes into is this paragraph but not only is the candlestick of gold it is of beaten gold this is what i want to spend time on this evening because this is the characteristic of the candlestick amen up till now everybody wanted to be the candlestick everybody wants to be a reflection of the genuine candlestick which is a reflection of the tree of life and now it's reflected over here in revelation chapter one and who wants to pee pure gold who wants to have no fault who wants to be amen the perfect expression in the mind everybody does but in order to be that it's made out of beaten gold not just gold but a precise kind of fashioning that fashioned this and it was beaten golden hand-crafted of beaten gold according to her blueprints which were spirit given outside of her lord and master jesus christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the bride of jesus christ surely she is filling up the sufferings that christ has left behind her goods are despoiled her life is in jeopardy she is accounted as sheep for the slaughter she is killed all the day long she suffers much but in it all retaliates not oh god help us we want to be christ-like we want to be pure gold then this is the kind of character we need to have we need to be handcrafted of beaten gold amen willing to suffer whatever we have to suffer to bring forth the manifestation of christ in our day you say brother ted i thought you said we were god you are part of god you're an expression of god but jesus christ was the expression of god and the expression of god was beaten amen was molded was rebuked was chastened was made fun of was mock was rejected that was pure gold on display not even through hybrid flesh amen but through created flesh amen he was come perfect he come the correct way amen and it was god's flesh and it was god's blood and it was god reflected in this tree of life amen and he was rejected he was beaten he was he was made fun of he was subject to the elements he was made subject to the authorities amen he was made subject to people's opinions and if god himself in flesh amen would fashion himself and mold himself and display himself that way what makes you and i think that we're going to bypass this amen and just say i'm part of god amen i'm i there's no fault in me amen there is no fault in you if you've been handcrafted the gold that's been molded into his image praise god she is accounted as sheep for the slaughter she is killed all day long she suffers much but in it all retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer praise god just think about jesus christ and his life and the way he was treated the way he was spoken to the way he was conspired against and how he responded amen never had to lower himself to the lower level amen of those that were under the influence of the devil he always conducted himself on a higher level he never had to come down and participate in the tactics of the wicked in order to overcome the wicked but he could stay like god even being rejected even being cursed even being lied about even being all the things that were happening to him being beaten being abused being tormented all the things that were happening to him he never in order to gain victory had to lower himself to the tactics of the devil he could remain with the character of god at all times and that character carried through is what won the victory we've been so hybridized for so long and our thinking has been so corrupted by hybridization and laodicea so long that we think it's amazing when somebody puts somebody in their place we cheer him on and yeah he told him they put them in their place they really told them where did jesus do that i mean there was times he corrected the pharisees there was times he said it right he set the record right there was times that he exposed the fallacy but he never mistreated people he never he never made fun of them he never called their name he never became arrogant he never became sarcastic he even had a sense of humor he said go tell herod that fox brother said he expressed a sense of humor but he never did somebody personal damage he never talked about him behind their backs he didn't have to become like lucifer in order to defeat lucifer no matter what happened to him he retaliated not and he did not make others suffer in fact when they were coming to arrest him unlawfully to get rid of him in a conspiracy when peter cut off the ear of marcus the high priest servant jesus using the gift that was in him would not use the gift on himself to deliver himself but he would use the gift on an enemy to heal him would not even allow others or cause others to suffer even when peter who was a friend peter who was a disciple caused suffering jesus healed the suffering say god give me this kind of character worthy of the gospel is this lovely bride of christ and as gold is malleable whereas brass will break with the beating this gold of god will bear her suffering for the lord not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and the joy forever by the trials and testings of this life what is forming her as a thing of beauty yes the trials and testings of this life brother ben god just wanted you more beautiful [Laughter] amen when we realized that what brother ben told us that everything's under control god is just trying amen and and maybe it's nothing grand we can say well what was the purpose of all the things going on and we always tried to make it something so big like maybe god was trying to keep him if he would have went on the beach he would have got robbed or or but maybe god just wanted to have more patience maybe god just want him to realize that everything's in control there's nothing worth getting upset about maybe that was the only lesson maybe it wasn't to keep him from an accident or so he didn't get robbed maybe it was just so a son could learn that it's okay it's okay to have a bad day it's okay when all my plans go wrong it has nothing to do with god's love for me it has nothing to do with his acceptance of me all it is is something that god wants me to learn and i'm willing to take it and move on praise be to god we always want it to be something big that because it always makes us look so special god loves me so much he kept me from getting hit hitting the theory he kept me from getting robbed or who knows what maybe suddenly a great white shark showed up in lake michigan and he was going to keep me from no just keep it simple god wanted me to check my attitude and learn that i don't have to get frustrated when things go wrong why can't we just leave it simple why can't we leave it every day god molding us into his image and training us and teaching us to stay like him and the right attitude and keep the right atmosphere under all circumstances we got to quit playing things up because when we play them up they make us look super spiritual make us look like no just just be real just be for real say god just wants me to know he loves me and that he doesn't want me to act like that praise god that's good enough for me amen and the identified masterpiece of god it's told one time the old gold before they had the smelter they used to take the gold and beat it the beater would the indians in the early days when arizona arizona was in its youth they beat the gold until the beaters seen his own reflection in the gold they beat out all the iron pyrite the drost the dirt out of it until the beater could see his own reflection like a mirror beating out now that's what the gospel does so many people don't like to be turned over and beat out well what the church needs tonight is a good old-fashioned holy ghost beating out of the word and of the world and the things of the world that's what pentecost needs tonight that's what our movement needs tonight is a good old-fashioned gold-turning beating until all the world is beat out of us and jesus christ is reflected remember this gold in this candlestick is beaten gold it must be fashioned by beating it cannot be fashioned by foraging it cannot be fashioned by heating it cannot be fashioned amen it must be fashioned by beating so what is god trying to do he's trying to shape us to get us into shape and he uses the beating he's trying to purge us to purge out impurities and to bring us into shape that's what the beating is for you need all the world beat out of us so that we can reflect the life of jesus christ man there's a picture of an old gold beater beating out the gold but brother bam tells us in the message have faith in god he said moses was taught in all the wisdom of the egyptian and he had 40 years of teaching under his mother and he could even teach the masters of egypt but it taken god just 40 years to get that all beat out of him on the backside of the desert so what was happening on the backside of the desert trials and tribulations amen moses was back there and brother branham said god gave him a hot tempered wife that's how much god loved him because god had to do some beating in moses to change moses thinking to get all the ideas he had picked up in egypt had to get that all out of him amen and now he becomes a he marries jethro's daughter he starts tending jethro's sheep amen he's no longer a royalty he's no longer in charge amen he's the one out keeping his father-in-law sheep amen married to his daughter and she we know she has a hot temper because he has a temper and god needs to break him down amen amen i could say a lot right now but thank god for the spouse he's given you even sometimes when iron sharpens iron in all relationships there's always a little iron sharpening iron and it needs to be that way amen because god wants to mold us in his very character amen and if there's never any iron sharpening iron if you never have a different idea than one of you is not allowed to express somebody's been shut down by the other person because there needs to always be a little iron sharpening iron so that both are sharpened and both are perfected i think moses had a lot of iron i mean it was like but god was beating all of those ideas and all of those concepts and all that he picked out he had to beat it all out of him until he got him into a shape where he was malleable and he could use him amen he goes on to say and why i'm against organized religion he says you know in the old days before they had smelters the goldsmith used to beat the gold with a hammer i guess you've heard of it before it went to the smelter they beat it and gold is the heaviest material it's heavier than lead and so i've done a little prospecting and you can take it in the sands and wash in the wash in the desert and rub your hands over the sand and then then blow like that and the dust and everything will fly away the rocks but gold is so heavy it lays there and then when you pick up that gold it's rolled through so much dirt until it's accumulated a lot and through the volcanic ages it has accumulated up it got sludge and everything iron pyrite and other materials mixed with them the beater used to take this lump of gold and beat it and turn it and beat it and turn it until he beat all the dross out of it and you know how he knowed that he had all the dross out he could see his own image reflected in it and that's the way god does the church he beats every creed every denomination every man man-made dogma until he sees his own life reflecting in you if i do not the works of my father believe me not if that see if what is purpose to the church the life that was in christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue all these things and temperance and things and godliness and brotherly kindness and all these things that's required of you if we see that we're lacking in this thing we shouldn't get frustrated with the beating because the beating is what's bringing us to what we know we need we need to reflect more of his life and brother says gold is the is the heaviest metal it's the heaviest material amen and so in the beating process everything else is knocked out of the gold amen and the gold is not damaged it's amazing how sometimes we go through trials in our life and maybe you get a heavy blow a blow harder than you've ever had in your life and it sends you reeling and you can't imagine how you'll ever recover from this and you must realize that that that smack with the hammer was never intended to destroy you it was intended to separate you from part of the world that doesn't belong in you because the hammer strike cannot destroy the gold all it can do is separate the world and it's amazing people have gone through hard blows and difficult times and sometimes you see people go through things and you think i don't know if i could go through that i don't know if i could ever stay standing if i went through what they went through but you realize that that what they went through was never to destroy them it was only to purify and perfect and fashion and mold them it could not destroy the gold amen and if you're if within you lies the gold of god no trial can destroy you no trial is meant to destroy you there is nothing that can destroy the gold all it can do is drive more of the world out and bring it more into the reflection of jesus christ sometimes we've hit we've been hit with blows we think there's no way lord you're killing me but he's not killing you he's perfecting amen he says in hebrews 5 7 who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that it was able to save him from death and was heard and that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation and to all them that obey him called of god a high priest after the order of melchizedek if that was god's plan for his son what's his plan for you and i even paul he had to take paul to the back side of the desert and beat out of him all of his education in christ is the mystery of god revealed the prophet says why it was a predestinated seed god said i have chose him yeah i am going to show him what great things he'll suffer for my name's sake god had already chose his suffering before he even called paul before he called him he had already ordained his suffering and was going to show him what great things he must suffer for his name saying before he even calls him there's a plan of suffering i mean paul didn't even have the privilege of assuming everything was going to be all fine when he gave his heart to the lord like you and i had god was so good to us that he kept us blind to the suffering part just showed us his word and we came and said praise god everything's going to be fine from here on out i found the truth but paul didn't even have the privilege of living in that kind of darkness and that kind of ignorance god from the beginning told him what things he must suffer for his name sake he said then i'll send him to the gentiles and disgrace him in every way that can be disgraced but yet he'll bear my name god knew he would come through he said he'd be disgraced in every way he'll suffer he was going to go through all this but yet he'll bear my name god knew because god ordained it and god knew there was gold laying in saul amen that had to come to perfection and the only way to come perfection it was to go through these trials but he would come forth as gold he said paul went down then until he got all of his ecclesiastical stuff cut off of him down at the back side of the desert for three years and a half down there in arabia until he learned the word and the word became he or he became the word you could say it either way and so jesus though he was a son he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he was perfected through suffering he was matured he was fully developed he was completely shaped through his suffering colossians 1 23 it says if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul and made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church paul says i'm finishing his sufferings paul knew what he was doing i'm finishing the sufferings in my body i'm finishing his sufferings hey it wasn't all left to paul but there's still some suffering to finish up and we're filling the sufferings of the lord that's our commission that's our calling it says in second timothy 2 it is a faithful saying for we be dead with him if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us if we suffer we shall also reign with him do we want to reign with him then we must suffer with him it's part of the package i found this picture these are some men and myanmar and in myanmar these are gold beaters and they're beating out gold amen and this beating of gold is for a specific purpose they're beating it they meant to make it into thinner sheets to make it malleable so that they could in in in myanmar they're wrapping it around idols and things like that they meant that they're gold plating and wrapping figures and idols and all of this stuff for their gods but the point is the beating not only purifies the but the beating also makes the gold malleable this is what brother branham said brass will be broken under the beating sometimes you see people amen they're so strong they're so strong amen but under a trial they just crack the pieces they just fall away and all of a sudden they were such strong believers but under the pressure they crack and they they run away and they're not believers anymore amen the gold doesn't break up the gold stays put it's heavier and then everything else everything else leaves the gold stays put just like on the threshing floor when the wheat is being threshed out everything else is blown away by the trials and the tribulations but the wheat keeps falling to the threshing floor and another round of grinding and another round of flailing and another tossing in the air the wind blows more away but the wheat falls back down the same it is with the gold under every turning and beating everything else flies off but the gold stays put and it's beat into a malleable form so it can be shaped because god wants to shape us into his image let's read this in first peter together first peter chapter 4. first peter chapter 4 verse 12. beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you but rejoice in so much as you are partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy if you be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified but let none of you suffer as a murderer as a thief or as an evil doer as a busybody in other men's manners yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let them glorify god on this behalf for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful creator amen [Music] if you're appointed to suffer then suffer like christ if you're appointed unto a trial then endure the trial like christ amen and understand that nothing is intended to break you but everything is intended to make you he was perfected he was the tree of life he was the candlestick of gold he was he himself was of beaten gold she will be of beaten gold if he was fashioned of beaten gold we must be fashioned of beaten gold until it becomes a replica of the one in heaven the one on earth that moses made was a replica of the one in heaven and the one amen in revelation 9 brother branham pointed us to understand the one in revelation chapter 1 verse 9 he pointed us back to the one in exodus 25 amen because the one on earth is always reflecting the one in heaven [Music] he's gone first peter 5 10 says but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal to his eternal glory by christ jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect established strengthen and settle you that's what the trial is meant to do i want to read this quote out of the smyrnan church age many of you know it it says i'm going to read the whole thing i just put a little section up here to remind me to read it it's a lengthy quote but just stay with me said he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign i don't know why is it that every time we get into trouble we say god what are you doing [Applause] why is this happening to me god way and it we all do it it happens every time but i'm looking for the day when i stop doing that and start saying god i'm paying attention now amen god help us to get to a level of maturity where we don't panic at every crisis where we don't lose our minds every time something goes wrong but now we understand that god's in control the clock's ticking right on time there's nothing out of kilter that god has a plan and god has reserved some suffering for you and i and through that suffering he's he's he's perfecting our character and he's glorifying himself and so now there's nothing strange that's happening to us don't don't think some strange thing has happened when considering the fiery trial that's come your way as though some strange thing has happened but let's settle back down and say god you're working a purpose in my life and i'm paying attention help me now lori that is his prerogative he is sovereign but is all all all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in us you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered in hebrews chapter 5 verse 8 he says though he were a son yet learned the obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of jesus christ was perfected by suffering i want you to catch what brother branham just said he said in plain language the very character of jesus christ was perfected by suffering if jesus christ virgin born the flesh of god with his theophany and if his character had to be perfected by suffering then how in the world will we ever come to a perfection of character without multitudes of suffering without manifold sufferings without a a whole heap load of chastisements and corrections and i mean if if jesus christ god in flesh if his character was molded by suffering amen then there is absolutely no way amen we should rejoice in suffering we should be thankful when it comes because there's no way to have this kind of character without it so i want to read that again because it's so striking what the prophet says in plain language the very character of jesus christ was perfected by suffering and according to paul he has left his church a measuring of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this james chapter 1 verse 2 to 4 says my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing it brings you to perfection why does he stand by this is out of the section in the in the in the church age book when he says it he says i know thy sufferings in the smyrna church age i know thy sufferings and he says i know i know thy sufferings and he says why does it seem like he doesn't do anything about it when he says i know he says i know because it's needful i know and i'm not changing the situation because the situation is needful to build your character and display my life so he says he's not unmindful is what the scripture says he's not unmindful is what brother branham said why does he stand by the reason is romans 8 17 and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same bases that he overcame and is set down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary sufferings that we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes the next time you see a brother going through a terrible terrible trial said listen brother this little temporary and he's going to look at you and be like but when we put it in the grand scheme the scope of our life and the scope of god's plan it's such a temporary thing it's such a blip on the radar it's such a short even if you suffer for 30 years what is that compared to eternity what if you're suffering on earth is seven years what is that compared to eternity the brotherhood said in the little temporary sufferings we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation the question is are you willing he quotes a scripture out of peter he said think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what peter said it is is it strange that god wants to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are we are all tried and chastened as sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of god that's why the prosperity preaching doctrine is absolutely off the word the church that is not suffering and that is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of god so you can say our church is perfect we got no problems then you're not the church amen you're not even the one that he's worried about it's the ones that are suffering and have trials and have problems that's the ones that he's working on praise be to god i love how i love how the reality is always so far away from our thinking hebrews 12 6 for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then you are bastards and not sons now this special condition in smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it so he's talking about the smyrna church age but he's applying it to every church agent and applying it to you and i there's no way it's free from it there is no true believer free from it this is of god this is the will of god it is needful we need the lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and to be christ-like in doing it love love which is charity is christ god is love love suffereth long and is kind what is love love is god love is charity love is the capstone the capstone is christ god the anointed word for the age god is love and it says love suffers long and is kind i thought when you got to the top you could do whatever you want i thought when you were married to christ you were such a special position nothing would ever harm you i thought as the bride of christ you're such a special you're in a glass house you're on a pedestal and everything is taken care of no when christ came look how he lived and look how much god protected him and look how much god kept him from trouble and kept him from suffering and kept him from ridiculing shame and why would he keep us from it when it brings such beautiful character when it brings out the very nature when you crush the rose it gives its fragrance why would he not crush the rose when he wants the fragrance god wants the fragrance of his life how is he going to get the fragrance of his life if he preserves the petals of the rose he must crush the rose to get the fragrance because the fragrance is what he wants please me to god it's backwards than what we think and the latest in church age he says you had better come before it's too late saith the lord and buy of me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly rich are you getting it listen to me naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it oh no we are going to take something with this what that something is is all we can take with us you can't take nothing else but this nothing less nothing more so we had better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before god so then what will we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of affliction or will it be the softness of this character-less laodicean people it's up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden if you want no troubles and you want to be rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing you will have no character that's the characterless laodicean condition amen she's blind to her need blind to her condition she thinks everything's fine and everything's wonderful and everything's going smooth amen but the real bride is is finishing up the sufferings of christ amen and she's and she's standing against the world she's even standing against herself amen if you're going to stand for this word you're going to stand against yourself your own flesh your own human mind your own reasoning your own affection you are going to stand against the enemy that's in your own skin amen and if you think that's not going to set off a trial mental battles and all kinds of afflictions amen that for warfare that fight in itself will create all kinds of affliction within you but we're supposed to have character character that overcomes through trials in the rapture he says wonder could it be already passed could the bride already be called as is that what we're going through today she has to be molded and made into the image of christ and christ is the word that's the only thing see it's there in the word see there cannot be one thing added there can't be a woman with one hand like a man in the other hand like a paw like a dog it's got to be exactly the word of the lord like he is the word the bride is part of the bridegroom the woman is part of her husband because she is taken out of the husband he was part of adam from his side and so is the bride not taken from the nomination but taken from the bosom of the word of god for this day and the word of god for this day is not accepted it's rejected and the people who carry that word must also be rejected but praise god of my lord was rejected and i'm fine with being rejected and my lord suffered and he had to suffer amen to build in him character if i have to suffer to build a new character then i will suffer amen because i don't want to go amen from this life to the next one empty because i always tried to do everything i could to avoid suffering i just want to surrender and say god have your way in my life whatever you've ordained let me walk through whatever you want to perfect me let me not shirk it or or dance around them but let me have courage enough to face the things that you bring my way in romans chapter 8 it says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god the them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among britain many brethren you were predestinated to be conformed into the image of the son you weren't just predestined to be bride that's part of it but the bride being part of the bride means you were predestinated to be conformed this word conformed means to be to have the same form as another similar conformed described what it is what is the essence in character and thus complete or durable not merely a form or outline so this word to be conformed to be fashion-like unto doesn't mean that you just made an outline or something similar to this but it means it describes what is the essence in character and thus complete or durable not merely a form or outline you're made to be conformed into his image not just like the outline of his image but the very essence of his image you're supposed to be on this life the very essence and makeup and complete and durable just like him you are on this earth to be just like him that's what we've been predestinated unto say i've been predestinated being the bride absolutely and in order to be the right kind of bride you've been predestined to be conformed into his image in order to be conformed into his image whatever way he was formed is the way you have to be formed whatever way he was perfected is how you have to be perfected because he was represented in the golden candlesticks that was beaten gold amen praise god it was gold it was god but it was beaten gold and over here to reflect that amen over in the new testament we also must be made of gold praise god that's god but it's beaten gold gold that is beaten and tried and shaped and malleable and molded not into what you think you should be but mold it into what he thinks you should be gold is flexible gold doesn't break amen gold can be moved into place amen and so god we have our own idea about what we want in life i want to be this kind of tradesman i want to be this kind of person i i want to have this kind of image amen but god knows how to take the hammer and beat you to a flexibility where he can mold you right back into what he predestinated you to be because you've been predestinated be conformed into the image of his son not your idea not your parents idea not the idea of your family not the idea of laodicea not the idea of guidance counselors or colleges but the idea that god had the image he had of you before the foundation of the world that gold that is inside of you that is god is malleable it can be molded and bent and flexed right into the position he wants and no matter how hard he hits it it doesn't break i mean there's you see christians you see christians real genuine christians and you read read about the heroes of faith and you read about those that come through the church ages real genuine the genuine believers of each age my goodness have you ever met a people so beaten so trot upon so downcast arrested and burned at stakes and ripped open and families separated and all kinds of problems but no matter how hard they were hit they could never kill christianity they could not take the life of christ because the gold always remains no matter how hard it's hit and you've been predestined to be conformed into the image of christ no matter how hard life hits you it can't break the god part of you it can break off stone and dross and debris and other kinds of metal all of that can go flying off of your life and you think i'm dying you're not dying you're coming to perfection amen you're not dying you're losing things you don't need to come right down to what you need and only what you need nothing can hit you so hard to destroy the god part of you and the god part of you is not rigid but malleable so that every time he reveals more of his word and plan to you he can mold you right into that plan we're going along as believers as christians we think we've got the message figured out we think we have our lives figured out we've been in the message this long we know what it means we know what god wants and all of a sudden he'll open something out of the word and you go along and you realize he doesn't like that attitude in me you can never serve god so long that the god part becomes rigid you can never be so long amen in the message that that your revelation becomes rigid that's not gold if all of a sudden amen god amen wants to bring he wants to he wants to bring another pedal out he wants to bring it around to the side amen and you don't want to flex around that side amen maybe you've allowed other metal to mix in and you become an alloy and not pure gold anymore and now you become brittle and breakable amen as god continues to beat and beat and beat amen it shows that something got mixed in it's not pure gold anymore but the gold is always malleable by god and god can always bring it into the shape of the seven golden candlesticks to reflect the life of jesus christ it doesn't matter if it's 20 years 30 years 40 years 50 years i've been believing the message i've been serving god god can always open up more of his word and always take the gold and bring it right into the shape that he's had before the foundation of the world there may be things that in our lives have been acceptable for 20 or 30 years but as god brings more character out and more character that and reflecting more of his life then all of a sudden you realize god's not pleased with that and we were blind to it before but now we realize god's not pleased with that amen the gold is always malleable and always be shaped into the image of christ he can always always shape it to be conformed to his word amen regardless of what we thought regardless of what we were taught regardless of our ideas regardless of what mom and dad told us god can always shape the gold into the image that he wants it to be in it's always malleable in the message identification he says we're invited to be molded in his image that we might reflect his presence and the works that i do shall you do also the life that i live so shall you we're invited by god to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his what a thing my then then when we let his character be in us then we have become sons by having the mind of christ the mind which is his character your mind makes your character let the mind paul said of christ this mind that was in christ be in you let the mind of christ be in you it molds the character of the son of god you know as our life is being shaped year by year and month by month it's not the outer form that's being broken i mean we still pretty much look the same we have maybe more gray hair and maybe gain some weight or lose some weight but that's not what he's molding it's the inside man and he's molding that thinking that mind he's molding it to in the shape of christ to think like the word amen to agree with the word to reflect the word on the outside amen let this mind that was in christ be in you amen what's he breaking he's been breaking wrong thinking what's he been beating out he's been beating out the dross of wrong ideas and wrong concepts what did he beat out of moses on the backside of the desert what did he beat out of peter or paul on the backside of the desert he was beating out wrong ideas and wrong concepts and wrong human thinking and for us what has he been beating out he's been beating out the wrong ideas amen that are in conflict and contrary to his word and to the character of his word so that we can catch more than the doctrine of his word so that we can get the character of his word because the word is a person and the person has characteristics the person has a life god doesn't want us to learn the black and white letter of the word he wants us to learn the life of the word the person of the word and that our character would come into the same character as the person of the word sometimes we can get so proud of ourselves when we know what the seven thunders are i can read the quotes and i can show them to you and and with a little bit of time if god will will open the word to you you can say ah i can see that those thunders are this is the revelation contained in the seven seals and this that and the other amen but god wants more than you knowing what the seven thunders are he wants the opening of the seals to bring christ into your life so that it will break all the wrong ideas out of your life and mold you into the very character of the person that's been opened in this day the opening of the word is the opening of christ amen now his life is known to us his life is on display and his life is now available to be lived like never before it's got to break our thinking and bring it in line and fashion with the word and if our if the mind that was in christ is in you then you will live the life of jesus christ and then in trials and in tribulations it'll begin to squeeze the fragrance of christ out of our lives praise be to god said god take that hammer of your word of the gospel and break dross out of my mind break all the the rocks and the stubble remember when brother branham i read the quote earlier when he's talking about the gold that he's picked up he said it's got rolled around in the earth and picked up bits through the volcanic ages and stuff my goodness that's how you come into this life and you got rolled around in this earth a lot of things got to be knocked out of there gotta be thinned out so it can be shaped say thank you lord for your shaping power apostle paul says my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed and you he's travailing and laboring until christ is formed in you until you are reflecting christ till christ is formed in your image or you're conformed into his image until this church reflects the tree of life until this church comes on earth to be a replica of the one that's in heaven brother bram says in the message the path of life from 1962 said the most gracious god in the name of jesus christ we come to thee with humble contrite spirits broken up lord knowing that we're ready for the molding as the prophet went down to the potter's house to be molded and father we desire this morning in our hearts that you will break us so that will be molded into a different characters characters that will represent jesus christ take my foolish heart lord take my stammering words and break them to pieces lord break my own self-will out and make a new person in christ granted lord that's the desire of our hearts is that the desire of your heart let's stand and pray together musicians if you'll come brother ben if you'll come brother branham is praying he's praying in this sermon and this is a a prayer he's praying to god amen and he's praying look at the humility look at the desire i mean he doesn't pray like a pharisee oh god i'm so glad you made me the prophet of the age and you gave me so much revelation and i know i know better than the denominations here comes a man who is so gifted and he says take my foolish heart lord take my stammering words and break them to pieces lord break my own self-will out and make a new person in christ granted lord that's the desire of our hearts you know what if we don't get beat out and come into the image of jesus christ in this day then everything's failed the whole purpose of our life the whole purpose of being here you may be wildly successful in your business you may make a lot of money you may build a beautiful home you may you may be able to do you may restore a wonderful car you may have accolades and accomplishments and things that that you can be proud of but if we fail to get that life everything's failed if we fail to reflect the very life of jesus christ and everything in life we fail amen and if you never build a beautiful house and never restore the car and never get the promotion and never have uh you know so much money in the bank account if you never have one trophy or one plaque to hang on the wall but you amen by the power of god have been broken down and molded and fashioned to the life of christ that you begin to reflect the life of this word then you've been successful god's been successful and you've met the goal you've met the purpose you've accomplished what he wants to accomplish in your life that's what we should be striving for and if along the way god gives accomplishment in our lives and trophies and accolades then their bonuses their blessings enjoy them but don't chase after that chase after his life being reflected in your life even strive for him being reflected in you every day and let everything else happen the way he wants it to happen we've got to stop chasing life and chase after the life of christ and in pursuit of the life of christ christ will do whatever he wants with our lives things will work out some things won't work out some things will be successful some things won't be successful there may be trophies there may be loss of trophies whatever happens that's not our pursuit our pursuit is for him and we want him to reflect himself in us the greatest desire of my heart is that nobody will see chad anymore but they'll see christ living in a vessel that can never live this kind of life somebody that you've seen people like that they're different than other people they don't live like other people they're sweet they're kind there's something about them it's that's what i want this word to produce in me i want the life of jesus christ on display more than i want anything else and there's still things i want i still want to catch a double-digit pass i'd be so happy there's things i want to see there's places i want to go there's still things i want in life but the one thing i want more than any if none of that ever happens in my life but if i can reflect the life of christ i'll leave here happy i'll live here happy i'll be thankful that the spirit of god was able to do a work in this vessel of clay make that our goal make that our life's achievement made that make that the focus of our lives may god have his way and let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus god as your prophet prayed lord that his desire was that you would break this will out of us that we take our foolish hearts and our words and just break them away from us and give us your thoughts and your words and your actions lord just take the gold that's within each of us and purge it lord get all the world out of it help us to lay still and let you beat all the world keep us lord from running to and fro and from jumping up and running to another place and jumping up and getting in another activity but help us to lay still while you beat some of that old worldly dross out of us and just stay in your word and stay in your presence and let you do the work that only you can do [Music] god and then i pray that you would take us lord and help us to be patient as you fashion us and mold us you're not in a hurry help us not to get in a hurry you're not rushing the job help us not to feel rushed help us to wait patiently lord as you bring your life into this vessel of clay mold us and make us into your very image almighty god have your way in us lord purge us lord of wrong thinking and wrong ideas purge us of the wrong desires of our own selfishness and our own wants lord help us to lay that down now at the altar and may you come lord by your word and mold us into the image of jesus christ god may you reflect your life in these vessels and may this bride standing at the end time be a reflection of the seven golden candlesticks with you in her midst speaking out words of eternal life god we want to reflect your life god you've called for beaten gold this candlestick was made of beaten gold god we trust you to do the fashioning help us god help us to surrender help us to yield help us to rejoice as you work in our lives we love you father i pray to be with us as we move from this place and travel home and to work and to things that you've called us to do in this life may our goal from here on be to allow you to do your work in us to reflect your life to have that character flowing through us may everything else fall a far second to that great desire in our lives we love you god and we thank you for your word we ask that you would bless it to come to life in our lives in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] amen for god [Music] oh a vessel of honor for god my [Music] oh [Music] of honor for god oh a vessel of honor for god [Music] it's amazing how we get so excited i myself get excited when brother banham says you're the spotless sinless virtuous bride there's no fault in you you're gold like he's gold and whatever he he is she is and her righteousness is his righteousness she is him hallelujah hallelujah and but then he goes but he's beaten gold and begins to break down what life will be like for a genuine seed of god the process that the gold has to go through to be fashioned like he's fashioned and all of a sudden you see why people start off shouting and rejoicing because their bride and they are believing and not even want to be part of the message because in order to be bride you have to live the way he lived you have to go through what he went through but there's a people on this earth that says i jesus for the glory that lay ahead endured the cross despising the shame there's got to be a people with enough foresight to recognize what it is god's trying to do and what the goal is and has more they have to come to such a realization such a faith that's quickened to us that we realize this life is nothing and compared to what real life is and what lays ahead of me is far greater than anything here and that reality will bring the right perspective and bring the right attitude towards our life but you see when people hit trials and hit troubles sometimes when we lose foresight of what lays ahead and the goal that god had and our position with christ and the millennium and the new jerusalem when you lose sight of that they become so dissatisfied with life so discouraged so hating their life so wanting to be somebody else and somewhere else i say let's catch a fresh vision of what god has for us and the purpose in our lives and keep that goal before us and say god i don't care what happens in this life i want to be here amen i want to be in this next life that's the one that i'm aiming for that's my goal amen we're gold praise god we're gold we're beating gold praise god we're beating gold thank god he's the one with the hammer and he knows how to strike it god bless you as you're dismissed may god be with you let's sing brother [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] me jesus make me [Music] [Music] lord just make me jesus make me [Music] oh [Music]
