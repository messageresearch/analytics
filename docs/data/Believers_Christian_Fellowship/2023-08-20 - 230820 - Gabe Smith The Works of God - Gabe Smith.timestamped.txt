[9:15] beautiful little girl and they're all
[9:17] gifts from God Amen thank God for that
[9:20] when I looked up Priscilla's name
[9:22] Priscilla means ancient which has the
[9:26] the notion of venerable or honorable and
[9:29] Grace means favor and we know that we
[9:31] receive God's unmar favor and may she be
[9:34] a recipient of that as well but also her
[9:37] namesake is Priscilla in the Bible and
[9:40] you might remember that Priscilla and
[9:41] her husband Aquilla were great helps to
[9:43] the Apostle Paul and I pulled this
[9:45] scripture out of Romans 16:3 he referred
[9:47] to aquill and Priscilla he said my
[9:49] helpers in Christ Jesus so may she be
[9:53] one of those helpers in CHR

[20:47] the privilege to stand before God's
[20:50] children this morning and um he um it's
[20:55] been a little bit uh it's uh almost 7
[20:59] years since I st behind the sacred desk
[21:04] and uh been through a
[21:07] few rough roads and few battles and and
[21:14] um but you know when you go through
[21:16] those things you know um you know how me
[21:20] loves a baby blue sky and a white puffy
[21:23] cloud and my oh man I tell them was my
[21:26] favorite days you know you ever see you
[21:29] ever get out and you walk out and you
[21:30] see one them baby blue skies them white
[21:32] puffy clouds just think of me cuz that
[21:36] that's a that's a brother Gabe day and
[21:39] uh I love them days you know the big I'm
[21:42] not I'm talking about the big big puffy
[21:44] ones you know and uh the puffier the
[21:48] better and uh it just it does something
[21:50] to me and but you know um you never
[21:55] really grow with baby blue skies and
[21:57] white puffy clouds that's right but it a
[22:00] lot of times it just takes the the
[22:02] storms the
[22:04] clouds the thunder rolling and lightning
[22:08] flashing and and you know when you don't
[22:11] know what El to do but look to the Lord
[22:13] Jesus and you feel his arms of embrace
[22:16] wrap around you and you feel pretty good
[22:18] after that you know but and so um I uh

[22:50] slide there he got a little power point
[22:53] I uh I'm
[22:56] um I I love doing
[22:59] Powerpoints and it's maybe not so much
[23:01] for the old ones but it's just for for
[23:03] the little ones and um was I I love to I
[23:09] love to be able to look and see the
[23:11] little eyes right over top of the the
[23:14] pews the chairs and you know you put a
[23:16] picture up there and they'll stop
[23:18] playing and they'll look up you know and
[23:20] so it's all part of my master plan is
[23:23] just trying to get to them so uh a lot
[23:25] of times people get critical of uh Power
[23:28] point they say PowerPoint preaching but
[23:31] um you know I believe if brother Brandon
[23:33] was still around he'd be a PowerPoint
[23:36] preacher uh if you uh don't worry I got
[23:39] a quote for it so don't whole fast wait
[23:43] just hold on now but brother Braham said
[23:46] he said that uh how many knows what his
[23:49] uh his dream Church would
[23:51] be he said he'd have Cathedral seating
[23:55] and then he said on the platform he said
[23:56] he'd have his charts that's yeah he said
[24:00] oh yeah he said he have his chars and he
[24:02] said he'd pull down this one and teach
[24:04] from it and then he' pull down another

[27:35] Supernatural um not only for I love

[28:00] us with Wide Open Arms not just me but
[28:06] my family my wife my children and um I
[28:12] hope you understand not just my words
[28:14] but to see my heart and my sincerity we
[28:18] truly love and appreciate you um and all
[28:23] that you mean to us
[28:26] um you know um
[28:28] sometimes it's hard to uh leave a church
[28:32] and you know you move on and picking up
[28:35] the pieces sometimes can be difficult um
[28:39] but you have made the burden a little
[28:43] bit lighter and uh I'm thankful to be
[28:48] able to uh fellowship with you and I
[28:50] trust that will just be a blessing it's
[28:54] it's been so tremendous overwhelming
[28:58] that I I um you know I don't want to say
[29:02] I
[29:03] fear uh cuz sometimes what you fear will
[29:06] come upon you uh but I I I just concern
[29:11] the Lord it been my prayer is God don't
[29:13] let me do nothing wrong don't let me
[29:15] ruin this you know I just be honest with
[29:18] you and and uh and I don't mean this in
[29:21] a way you know sometimes when people
[29:22] leave a church that they want to frown
[29:25] on this and then you know you're
[29:27] fellowshipping with angels and I I
[29:29] realize y'all ain't
[29:31] Angels you're you're falling just like
[29:34] me but but I I appreciate your sincerity
[29:38] and and the love that's been expressed
[29:40] to us and so uh if it's okay I'm just
[29:43] going to you know just like you got
[29:45] family just you know you ever just scoot
[29:47] somebody over you get in the couch and
[29:49] you move everybody over and that's what
[29:51] I'm going to do I just going to kind of
[29:52] scoot over and nudge you out of the way
[29:55] and make
[29:56] room right
[29:58] and so uh cuz uh I I believe uh uh I
[30:03] believe the family of God is here and by
[30:06] God's grace I'm part of that
[30:08] economy so thankful for his Saving Grace
[30:12] and how how he can pull you out of deari
[30:16] clay and it becomes more than just a
[30:19] song but it becomes your testimony to
[30:22] see God's grace move in your life in a
[30:24] supernatural way and not only that I'm
[30:27] I'm so thankful that uh it's one thing
[30:31] when um when God does something for you
[30:35] but it's a whole another thing when he
[30:37] does it for your whole
[30:40] family you know uh and and no matter how
[30:45] hard you try as a daddy there's some
[30:49] things you just can't
[30:51] do and uh it it makes it hard you know
[30:56] to have to uh I don't mean to say it
[30:58] like this but I just say it I hope you
[31:00] mean to depend upon
[31:04] God especially us us
[31:06] Brethren right you know because we're
[31:09] the man of the house we're the protector
[31:13] we always say that and put a little Bas
[31:15] in the voice right little
[31:19] gravel cuz we want to know you know
[31:21] we're here to protect and we're here to
[31:23] watch over and we're going to make sure
[31:25] you make it but there's there's part
[31:27] part of that that no matter how hard you
[31:29] try without the Holy Spirit you'll be an
[31:32] utter
[31:33] failure and and so I'm so thankful that
[31:37] the Lord Jesus can look at our desire
[31:40] and what we're trying to do and what
[31:42] we're trying to accomplish and then he
[31:44] can provide a way for us and so I
[31:47] appreciate my family uh suffering with
[31:51] me you know um sometimes in life
[31:58] things happen to you don't really
[32:00] understand it you know I just saw a
[32:03] quote I think it was last night night
[32:05] before last and brother bar was talking
[32:07] about um David when uh when uh you know
[32:12] he was at Bethlehem and the Garrison of
[32:15] the Philistines was you know pushing
[32:18] against him and you know uh Saul was
[32:21] coming against him and you know he was
[32:23] brother B referred to him as a fugitive
[32:26] and when he when he's when he's
[32:29] surrounded and and he and B baram said
[32:31] it's summer time and the heat's on him
[32:32] and he's parched and thirsty and he just
[32:35] wants a a cool drink of water from that
[32:38] well of
[32:39] Bethlehem and and brother brandham says
[32:41] that it's amazing how he says it but he
[32:44] he he he says that in David's turmoil in
[32:47] his stress he he
[32:51] uh he um I'm going to be all over the
[32:54] place so I hope you're okay with that uh
[32:57] but he he uh he's all confused and he
[33:01] said how can it be Lord he says you know
[33:05] leaders
[33:07] leaders
[33:11] um PowerPoint is something else um he
[33:16] said
[33:18] uh leaders sometimes go through things
[33:21] that the congregation don't know what
[33:24] they're going through when you think of
[33:26] promises God made and and then why don't
[33:28] it come to pass they don't tell their
[33:31] congregation they don't tell the people
[33:33] they associate with and many
[33:35] frustrations in the heart of a real real
[33:37] leader and but the Philistines was
[33:39] taking advantage of the split between
[33:41] David and Saul and he says he says uh he
[33:45] said oh God how could it be you poured
[33:48] out that oil upon me not because I chose
[33:52] myself but you chose me why did you call
[33:56] me from hurting the Sheep out yonder and
[33:58] told me you'd give me this to serve your
[34:01] people and here you've got me between
[34:04] the fires
[34:05] everywhere and and you think about here
[34:09] he is Anointed of God and you know uh a
[34:14] a man after God's Own Heart and yet it
[34:17] looked like everything was falling apart
[34:20] and a lot of times I'm so thankful that
[34:22] it did because when we in life we can
[34:25] look back at his life and we go we can
[34:26] identify
[34:28] because you know just because we're the
[34:30] elect of God and we can see that by
[34:33] faith we have our name on the Lamb's
[34:35] Book of Life that is not going to uh uh
[34:37] bypass us from trials from stresses a as
[34:42] as as we look at this blind man in in in
[34:44] John you know it it's amazing that when
[34:48] we think of John and and the gospels and
[34:50] we have all four of of the writers and
[34:53] so we can see their
[34:55] perspectives uh and we know that
[34:58] that their their characteristics would
[35:00] would help them to spot certain things
[35:03] that would stand out that John would
[35:06] catch something maybe Matthew wouldn't
[35:09] and and Luke would catch something that
[35:10] John wouldn't and and and so John being
[35:13] The
[35:15] Eagle right he he would catch things
[35:18] that nobody else would and and and you
[35:21] know even even all throughout the ages
[35:23] from the days of John even even through
[35:26] the the church history uh when when you
[35:29] read they used to think that John wasn't
[35:33] even part of the scriptures that because
[35:35] it was so different and it had to be
[35:38] that way when you study history but it
[35:40] was because John was the eagle he was a
[35:42] Heavenly bird he was not Earthly he was
[35:45] not to carry a burden and he was not to
[35:48] look to his intellect and but but he was
[35:50] supposed to fly in the
[35:52] heavenlies and and now we in the last
[35:55] day we can look back and now we can we
[35:57] can understand why John went through
[35:59] what he went through we can understand
[36:01] why John didn't uh maybe people didn't
[36:04] understand John the way we do but it
[36:07] because it wasn't for their time it's
[36:08] for our time and so John when he would
[36:12] pick these things up he would he would
[36:14] catch this blind man and nobody else
[36:17] would it it wouldn't be of significance
[36:19] to to Matthew Mark or Luke but it would
[36:22] only be John that would pick it up and
[36:24] then pick up the the the scroll and the
[36:26] pen and start frighten because we in
[36:30] this last day would be able to look and
[36:32] go that's
[36:33] me amen that that that this man that
[36:37] that had that that had grew up in the
[36:39] church right Mom and Dad were
[36:42] faithful they were so faithful that they
[36:45] wouldn't give up the synagogue when
[36:47] Christ was presented and and so John was
[36:50] was was was was was catching this and
[36:53] this blind man he grew up no doubt in
[36:55] the Christian home Mom and Dad faithful
[36:59] followers faithful Believers right and
[37:02] and and and here he is born blind from
[37:05] birth never seen the breaking of day
[37:09] never seen the light never could see a a
[37:12] baby blue sky or a white puffy Cloud but
[37:17] but one day when when when when when he
[37:19] would meet the king of kings the Lord of
[37:23] lords that that that that that God would
[37:27] by grace would would give him his sight
[37:31] back but but when he when he would
[37:34] receive something that he longed for his
[37:37] whole
[37:39] life when when when Mom and Dad would
[37:42] would would tell him what a baby blue
[37:45] sky
[37:47] is you
[37:52] know it take a cold drink and he go you
[37:56] know it's when you take that that that
[37:59] drink of hot well that's kind of like
[38:02] red
[38:04] right and then Mom would give him a
[38:07] glass of cold
[38:11] water that's kind of like
[38:16] blue
[38:17] right and then and get something super
[38:21] soft you know and let him feel it and
[38:24] goes that's that's kind of like white
[38:26] see how to Pure that is and you know and
[38:30] and so growing up feeling that and and
[38:35] seeing that and and and something that
[38:38] he had no doubt longed for only knowing
[38:42] Blackness and
[38:43] darkness but but then that faithful day
[38:48] amen when he would have those scales
[38:52] removed from his
[38:54] eyes not only naturally right yeah but
[38:58] the most important part spiritually
[39:00] that's right that that when that would
[39:03] when that would happen and and and it
[39:06] would be it would
[39:08] be you know rolled
[39:13] back what it what it opened to him was a
[39:16] trial
[39:21] right you know the the joy was
[39:24] shortlived
[39:29] he he didn't get to enjoy a summer of
[39:31] fun with the mom and
[39:33] dad you
[39:35] know but it but it wasn't just but a few
[39:38] moments and and everybody was
[39:42] upset everybody that should be rejoicing
[39:46] because the greatest miracle that ever
[39:49] happened at that point in time never a
[39:52] blind eye was open right and and now it
[39:56] was folding amongst the elect of God and
[40:02] instead of rejoicing yeah there was
[40:05] really
[40:07] confusion it it was it was really anger
[40:11] yeah because somebody's position was
[40:15] going to be called in
[40:18] question that that that that that
[40:21] Stander that was set was starting to
[40:25] crumble and and and and the Kingdom that
[40:28] the the Pharisees and Sadducees had
[40:31] established was starting to
[40:33] [Applause]
[40:37] break and his eyes no doubt the joy was
[40:43] shortlived I you know I wonder a week
[40:46] two weeks three weeks down the road you
[40:49] think he ever wished his eyes wasn't
[40:54] open yeah yeah
[40:58] oh come on how many is that listen come
[41:01] on friend you you can't tell me in your
[41:04] darkest
[41:06] hour Amen in your darkest hour you think
[41:11] Lord why just like just like David Lord
[41:14] why' you anoint me to see amen yeah
[41:18] right listen friends some sometimes life
[41:20] life is rough life is
[41:24] vicious life life will chew you up and
[41:27] spit you out if you let it you you got
[41:31] to be you got to be a soldier to make it
[41:34] in this last day no no matter how well
[41:37] we try to shelter and protect and watch
[41:40] over our children there's still a
[41:43] battlefield that they must
[41:46] face there's no way around it every one
[41:49] of us must come to that Battlefield
[41:52] every one of us must be tried and tested
[41:56] that's right there's no no way around it
[41:58] no matter how well how much we try to be
[42:01] as
[42:03] parents it's got to
[42:08] happen and the and and you know why it's
[42:11] not just for them but it's also for you
[42:14] it's for
[42:16] me because a lot of times we want to we
[42:20] want to guide them in the way that we
[42:22] want them to
[42:23] go but God may have a different Road for
[42:26] them right
[42:29] and then when when they go a a pathway
[42:32] that you didn't
[42:35] expect that's really a teachable a
[42:37] teachable
[42:39] moment not for
[42:41] them but for
[42:43] you for
[42:46] me because we always we always want
[42:50] safety we always want
[42:53] Comfort right we I I you know
[42:58] I I you my my I tell my children I'm I'm
[43:00] very
[43:06] CDO some of y'all slow OCD excuse
[43:10] me
[43:13] yeah right I'm so organized I wanted
[43:17] alphabetized right CD it's got to be in
[43:21] an order it's got to be the right way
[43:24] right it it it there's a certain way in
[43:27] which we do things in the Smith
[43:28] household right and and and we we love
[43:33] to use the scripture in order to
[43:35] maintain
[43:38] that right but but you know God
[43:42] sometimes he likes a little
[43:44] messy because he's trying to teach us
[43:47] something and and and sometimes we got
[43:50] to realize that everything's not going
[43:53] to be in a nice tidy neat box right
[43:57] but when it's we go through those times
[44:01] that's when we have to be mindful of
[44:05] what who is really in control
[44:10] amen because he's trying to get you out
[44:12] of control so that he can be in control
[44:16] amen that's right and you know uh you
[44:21] know sometimes we why still ain't got
[44:23] off the
[44:27] you
[44:28] know oh my so brother Franco here so
[44:32] brother Franco how many preach I love
[44:33] brother Franco he's so good so I we
[44:37] going to have to pay here we go let's
[44:38] see uhoh
[44:42] uhoh praise the Lord now brother Franco
[44:46] this is where the video can cut off and
[44:48] then you can blame
[44:50] me right there brother
[44:55] you so
[44:57] but you know uh sometimes things happen
[45:00] in lives that are
[45:06] unexpected things things don't go the
[45:09] exact way that you expect them to be
[45:12] and it's it's in
[45:16] those detours or unexpected twists and
[45:20] turns of the road that really shake you
[45:24] to your
[45:25] core and you know uh sometimes and
[45:29] here's the thing it don't necessarily
[45:31] have to be so much as sinful we we ain't
[45:35] talking about you know the television
[45:36] slipping back in or or you know or or uh
[45:40] well it's it's uh football season and
[45:43] you know we ain't talking about that but
[45:45] but sometimes you can be so consumed
[45:48] with church and and your position or
[45:53] whatever it may be that you lose sight
[45:55] of God you know you know you know you
[45:58] know everything that we do is supposed
[45:59] to be as unto the
[46:01] Lord but it's so easy for us to get
[46:04] sidetracked on that I I I I had to learn
[46:08] a a very hard lesson in that you know
[46:10] cuz sometimes you can be so dedicated
[46:13] but you can you can you can get your
[46:15] your
[46:16] dedication off onto the wrong thing and
[46:20] it can be close it it it can be very
[46:23] close but but we God wants us to be be
[46:27] precise he he don't want to get he don't
[46:30] want
[46:31] 99% of your affection he wants 100% he
[46:35] don't want 99% Glory he wants every bit
[46:39] because every bit is due him but a lot
[46:42] of times we as Humanity we get
[46:44] sidetracked and and and and we get off
[46:46] course and and God has a way of getting
[46:49] you back on course and and it's not
[46:51] because he's here to hurt you it's
[46:53] because actually because you're a part
[46:55] of him is why he does what he
[46:58] does a lot of times we think it's God uh
[47:01] uh criticizing us or he don't love us or
[47:04] kicking us around and maybe we think
[47:06] we're an orphan but it's not that it's
[47:08] the fact that you're elect of God is the
[47:10] reason why I let you go through those
[47:12] things and and and a lot of times we go
[47:15] through and it's not about us being good
[47:17] it's about him being good is that
[47:22] right brother Bram says he says every
[47:25] believer in here is a Christian tonight
[47:28] because not that you're
[47:30] good but because God was good to call
[47:34] you you couldn't come yourself your
[47:37] Nature's against it and and somehow in
[47:41] the process of time when we get a few
[47:43] years under our belt
[47:45] and somehow we lose sight of
[47:50] that and and I think sometimes the
[47:54] bottom falls out of it to remind us that
[47:57] it's the grace of God that we're at
[47:58] where we're at and and I'm so thankful
[48:02] for him to be so merciful to us because
[48:06] no doubt that man that was born blind
[48:09] and that you know when his eyes open and
[48:13] and then uh and then the test was on and
[48:15] and we we think that would be a great
[48:17] thing but but then he had to stand the
[48:20] other test of will he stand with Christ
[48:24] or the temptation of his family
[48:27] amen be because that's the same thing we
[48:30] in this last day that are called out of
[48:33] the systems of the
[48:37] synagogue right you know you think well
[48:39] man I stopped drinking I stopped
[48:41] drugging I sto whatever and our eyes get
[48:44] open and we think that's it but that's
[48:47] not it you know I I I thought you know
[48:49] by God's grace when God when when God
[48:52] started dealing with me I knew what the
[48:54] message required I I had grown up in a
[48:56] message home uh broken home but Dad was
[49:00] a Believer and and so I knew the the the
[49:03] standard that was necessary in order to
[49:05] say I'm a Christian and I realized that
[49:08] I couldn't live up to that standard but
[49:11] I didn't understand that the only way I
[49:13] can live up to that standard is by
[49:15] having experience with the holy spirit
[49:17] that takes me to that
[49:20] standard and I and I realized there's no
[49:23] way in order for me to live that but by
[49:25] God's grace he let me uh stop drinking
[49:28] and drugging and things and I got
[49:30] cleaned up before I ever Ste foot in the
[49:31] message
[49:35] church and then once I steep foot in
[49:38] that messy church I realized how sinful
[49:40] I really was right and you know what the
[49:44] longer I stay in a message church I
[49:47] still have that same understanding
[49:51] amen I realize it's the grace of God
[49:54] Lord I need you every every moment of
[49:56] every hour I you know you know it's not
[49:59] just the night that we get saved or the
[50:02] afternoon or the day that we get saved
[50:05] but we need a savior every hour of every
[50:08] moment of every day but somehow we lose
[50:12] sight of needing a
[50:15] savior it's because we get cleaned up a
[50:17] little bit or listen Maybe maybe you
[50:20] never needed cleaned
[50:22] up you you may not be able to relate to
[50:25] it and go I never went there route but
[50:28] but the thing that you have to realize
[50:30] is in your own righteousness that'll
[50:32] still never make Heaven's
[50:34] [Music]
[50:37] Door you need the blood of Jesus Christ
[50:40] regardless and and so God was good to
[50:44] call you but then he was even more
[50:46] gracious to reveal that even though you
[50:48] may not be able to relate to brother
[50:50] Gabe with the tattoos and the ear
[50:52] pierced and and the scars of this world

[51:16] life right

[51:23] it it takes it takes personal
[51:27] relationship with Jesus Christ amen

[51:32] actually know him in the power of his
[51:34] resurrection and and the fellowship of
[51:40] his
[51:41] sufferings and and a lot of times we

[53:28] amen and I I I don't say that
[53:29] halfheartedly I'm I'm being honest I
[53:33] listen you God God strike me dead if I'm
[53:36] saying this for flatteries I I I I would
[53:39] rather die the death to T to stand
[53:42] behind up here and and be some facade
[53:44] but but but God's Grace has has has
[53:47] literally transformed it like a light
[53:49] switch went off and I think you know I'm
[53:52] talking about from 2016 I don't know
[53:55] where you was in 2016 but from 2016 to
[54:00] 2023 I was in the darkest Valley that
[54:02] I'd ever been in my life I'm talking
[54:05] about you know they talk about
[54:06] functional alcoholics I didn't have no
[54:08] alcohol with no alcoh I was a functional
[54:10] depressed I was functionally depressed
[54:13] and I thought the only thing that got me
[54:15] going from day to day was the fact that
[54:16] I had to be a provider for my children I
[54:19] had to be a provider for my family oh I
[54:21] still had a laugh I still had a smile
[54:23] but there was something deep down on the
[54:25] inside that I just couldn't you know you
[54:28] you just can't you can't get from and
[54:30] you people a lot of people say well just
[54:31] shake it off come on brother brother
[54:34] they ain't never been in them kind of
[54:36] valleys if they say just shake it off a
[54:38] lot of times you think you're a
[54:39] Christian Shake It Off listen sometimes
[54:42] you go through those things in life and
[54:44] you wonder why some you you get tired of
[54:47] saying why Lord why Lord what did I do
[54:51] what did I do and you overturn every
[54:53] stone in your life and you're trying to
[54:55] figure it out and there just is no
[55:01] answer that's where I was and I don't
[55:05] understand it still to this day I don't
[55:08] understand it don't make sense to me but
[55:11] listen God didn't call us to make sense
[55:15] he called us to have
[55:17] faith and and and and that's that's
[55:20] that's what happens in life God is
[55:23] trying to teach us and mold us for a
[55:25] purpose a lot of times we get distracted
[55:28] and we think it's God listen you know
[55:30] that quote where brother Braham said he
[55:31] felt like an orphan I held on to that
[55:34] thing for seven years almost felt like
[55:37] an orphan like God like like like the
[55:40] skies was
[55:41] brassy just and I'm not even talking
[55:43] about I'm talking about a just a dark
[55:45] Haze of
[55:47] brass and and and you and you go through
[55:50] life and you think Lord what what what
[55:52] is going on why why why why is this
[55:57] happening and you trying to make sense
[55:59] of
[56:02] it you know but but I you know what I
[56:06] you know what I realized in in it all it
[56:08] was a tender hand of Jehovah amen and he
[56:12] said oh brother Gabe that's the Jews no
[56:14] that's me that's right that friend
[56:17] that's more than a quote to me that's a
[56:20] reality that that you know sometimes we
[56:23] go through things and we don't
[56:24] understand why but but then I but when I
[56:27] look back I see the Deliverance that was
[56:30] happening in my life amen I I don't you
[56:32] know I don't I tell you I don't
[56:34] understand how this happens outside of I
[56:36] see Naomi and Ruth Naomi was in a
[56:39] backsliding condition cuz she was out of
[56:42] out of Israel
[56:44] yeah but even though she was in a backs
[56:46] sitting condition she still had enough
[56:48] of a testimony that Ruth said your God's
[56:51] going to be my God wherever you go I'm
[56:53] going think about that you know that's
[56:56] why I name my middle one they on me
[56:58] because because I thought I thought that
[57:00] well wife and I but you understand what
[57:01] I'm
[57:04] saying yeah your brother Bob yeah
[57:09] right but but to me for her to be in
[57:12] that backsliding condition but still
[57:15] have a testimony that can reflect in
[57:17] such a way that rof would say no your
[57:20] God is going to be my God and I don't
[57:24] understand how it happens that you know
[57:26] all I can tell you friends that I was I
[57:28] was I was cold I was indifferent I was
[57:31] backslid did I have a 40 dog in my hand
[57:35] no no did I run the bars no no actually
[57:39] friends there was Deliverance in my life
[57:42] that I had struggled with my whole
[57:45] life and I still don't understand
[57:47] outside it was the tender hand of
[57:49] Jehovah that even though I'm in a cold
[57:52] and former indiff State God could bring
[57:55] Deliverance
[57:58] you you you say that can't be I don't I
[58:00] I it's too
[58:03] late because I I I'm the evidence that
[58:07] it can happen and I don't understand it
[58:09] and and I I I I I I don't I don't know I
[58:12] don't know but but all I can say is that
[58:15] it happened in my life and and and when
[58:19] we can when we go I tell you it but it
[58:21] brings you to such a it brings you to a
[58:25] deeper uh relationship with God because
[58:28] then you realize
[58:30] Christ and I hate to say it like this
[58:33] but Christ is in
[58:34] control and he say hate to say like
[58:36] because it's so cliche you know what I
[58:38] mean that's just what the preachers say
[58:40] but no it's not what the preachers I
[58:42] know they may say it but when when
[58:44] you're alone and you're all by yourself
[58:47] and then you see it reflected in your
[58:50] life that God is in control that God
[58:54] only is going to let you go so far and
[58:57] and then he just changes things and
[59:01] sometimes he'll turn you upside down so
[59:03] fast you don't understand it I I I'll be
[59:05] honest with you friends the first day
[59:07] the first day we we we we we came to

[1:01:44] I
[1:01:50] talk I
[1:01:52] mean there ain't no hiding that right
[1:01:55] all I say is when God called me he
[1:01:57] didn't change my Linguistics he just
[1:02:01] changed my vocabulary but I'm still me
[1:02:04] I'm still brother Gabe I'm still Gabe I
[1:02:06] mean I can't help it where I've been and
[1:02:08] what I done been through and and listen
[1:02:10] when God converted me he didn't give me
[1:02:12] his Bible in an English book and he
[1:02:14] didn't give me YouTube classes on how to
[1:02:16] how to speak orally and how
[1:02:19] to right you know I you know but anyways
[1:02:22] but think about this so this listen
[1:02:25] think think about
[1:02:29] this I come out preaching like that he'
[1:02:32] be like Lord let's say hands on brother
[1:02:33] Gabe Lord have mercy he got a hold of an
[1:02:36] English book God help him but but think
[1:02:41] about this uh so brother Shay had us
[1:02:44] come over and I you know I did tell you
[1:02:48] brother Shay I could just every time see
[1:02:50] him with that hat turned down you know
[1:02:51] like then big old hat and then
[1:02:56] you know how fast you going
[1:02:59] boy
[1:03:02] right you
[1:03:05] know but think of how God does and that
[1:03:08] man right there I love him yeah right I
[1:03:12] I'll be honest with you and we about as
[1:03:14] opposite look he's from the south right
[1:03:17] I even said he from the
[1:03:20] south right from hills of Virginia state
[1:03:25] boy right police officer trooper and
[1:03:29] then what is it a tuck seat or suit is
[1:03:31] put the arms around a pair of overhauls
[1:03:34] what do we have in common what we have
[1:03:36] in common is the only thing we need in
[1:03:37] common and that's the love of God hsaing
[1:03:41] in our hearts right and and brother what
[1:03:45] that man did something to me I tell you
[1:03:46] I go to the ends of the world for him
[1:03:49] but but because when when he and I could
[1:03:51] could come together and break bread
[1:03:53] together it wasn't to sitting across the
[1:03:55] the table but it was afterward the
[1:03:57] fellowship amen it was the openness yeah
[1:04:01] that he could be honest with me and I
[1:04:03] could be honest with him and I realized
[1:04:06] that even though he may had a different
[1:04:08] path than me we're still on the same
[1:04:11] path right that's what true two fell
[1:04:14] that's what True Fellowship is Right Two
[1:04:17] Fellas in one ship right but but it's
[1:04:20] not just that it's it's all it I just be
[1:04:23] honest with you I just going to brag on
[1:04:24] you you know it it's everything it it
[1:04:27] it's my brother Kyle Brother Kyle and we
[1:04:30] were closest 19 is to
[1:04:32] 20 right I'm talking about
[1:04:35] microns you you people in factories know
[1:04:38] what I'm talking about somebody like
[1:04:39] what's a
[1:04:40] micron right right but but there's
[1:04:44] something about that man that I I just
[1:04:46] love but but to me for a man that you
[1:04:48] can really look and see that he has a
[1:04:50] love and a burden for young people oh
[1:04:53] man you know he the man's 10 foot tall
[1:04:56] and bulletproof in my presence right but
[1:04:59] but that but that's what I love look at
[1:05:02] brother Emanuel just a
[1:05:03] prince you know brother Chad he just it
[1:05:09] I I'll just be honest with you you know
[1:05:10] know how we do whenever us us message
[1:05:13] people say well I'm not lifting up a man
[1:05:15] always a disclaimer right just give a
[1:05:18] rose butt and move on my goodness get
[1:05:21] rid of that pride and that Hess that you
[1:05:24] always trying to defend and just give a
[1:05:27] rosebud right we need to be we need to
[1:05:29] relax a little bit and and stop
[1:05:31] stressing but every time we make a move
[1:05:33] we got to have a quotebook to prove our
[1:05:36] point right be be be be comfortable in
[1:05:39] who you are and
[1:05:41] relax we don't need a quotebook to
[1:05:43] approve our every
[1:05:46] emotion but but but but brother Chad I
[1:05:48] tell you brother he's always been a
[1:05:49] friend to me and I've always admired
[1:05:51] even when I wasn't a part of the
[1:05:52] assembly we'd meet together and he'd
[1:05:54] give me wisdom and advice and we have
[1:05:57] with you know just different times and
[1:05:59] and and but then I tell you when I what
[1:06:02] what I've been listening to it's like
[1:06:04] you know there's one thing for a
[1:06:05] preacher to preach you something that he
[1:06:09] studied but it's another thing when he
[1:06:12] preaches you something that he's
[1:06:15] lived it's a whole another book friends
[1:06:19] and and a lot of times I think we as
[1:06:21] preachers we're too busy studying the
[1:06:23] message or or or or studying somebody
[1:06:26] else's notes to instead of really living
[1:06:30] this and saying God I want to
[1:06:36] experience we we we've got this message
[1:06:39] so figured
[1:06:40] out but I think sometimes we miss the
[1:06:43] life right like like like we said we
[1:06:46] don't mean to but we set the Lord aside
[1:06:47] cuz we got this under control and
[1:06:50] instead of just surrendering to him
[1:06:51] saying Lord You Have Your Way you you
[1:06:54] you move through through me that's what
[1:06:57] I want friends I'll be honest with you I
[1:06:59] I told the Lord Lord I'll be a fool for
[1:07:01] you is I and that's what I'm doing right
[1:07:04] now I'll be a fool I I don't want to say
[1:07:07] these things I don't want to you know
[1:07:08] and I'm telling you y'all pray for me
[1:07:10] tomorrow because I'm be so worried about
[1:07:12] the archives I'm thinking oh man what
[1:07:14] this oh I cannot be oh I said this and
[1:07:17] oh my help me
[1:07:19] Lord
[1:07:21] right right so don't pray for me right
[1:07:24] now pray save it for Monday
[1:07:27] I going to need it I'll be honest with
[1:07:29] you I'm being awful
[1:07:32] honest but I just to me I like being
[1:07:35] transparent I think that's what a real
[1:07:37] family needs to be we need to be
[1:07:39] transparent with each other we need to
[1:07:41] be honest we just need to be open but
[1:07:43] too many times we try to protect
[1:07:45] ourselves because we have this facade of
[1:07:48] being a message believer that we don't
[1:07:50] make no mistakes we have the word of God
[1:07:52] we got the Divine interpretation with
[1:07:54] Vindication on right and we just spit
[1:07:56] out all the
[1:07:59] lingos and then we sat back with arms
[1:08:01] folded
[1:08:03] and but but really what is
[1:08:06] that right I mean to me friends I I've
[1:08:11] come to a place where it's like listen I
[1:08:13] don't know
[1:08:16] nothing every everything I thought I
[1:08:18] knew I realize the longer I'm with the
[1:08:21] Lord and the longer he leads me it's
[1:08:23] like God I had that so wrong come on man
[1:08:25] I had that so wrong my attitude was
[1:08:28] wrong my Approach was wrong my my Hess
[1:08:32] was wrong I I didn't have no humility
[1:08:34] and I thought I did come on right and
[1:08:37] then I think God what is wrong with me
[1:08:39] and then I look back and it's like but
[1:08:41] he's still there he's still there and
[1:08:45] I'm and a lot of times it just amazes me
[1:08:49] because then I realized it is the fact
[1:08:53] that I was a part of him amen before
[1:08:55] this world ever
[1:08:57] was and I say that in all humility and
[1:09:02] and reverence but remember we have to
[1:09:04] come to that but we have to come to it
[1:09:07] in a way that we can say it in the right
[1:09:09] way in a broken way in in a way that's
[1:09:12] like oh Lord by his grace because you
[1:09:15] look at all the people that have that
[1:09:17] have came and went came and went came
[1:09:19] and went you think of all the people
[1:09:21] that didn't last a year 6 months in that
[1:09:24] Darkness
[1:09:25] [Music]
[1:09:26] but how is it friends you tell me how is
[1:09:30] it that we did not do any preparation to
[1:09:34] come here outside to watch the
[1:09:36] services I there was no fasting there
[1:09:40] was no travail there was no there was no
[1:09:43] pounding on the horns of the
[1:09:46] altar but how is it that I could put on
[1:09:49] a
[1:09:50] suit in in question and wonder
[1:09:55] and like what's going to

[1:13:21] honest that's all you can do is be
[1:13:23] honest and go look look you you know I I
[1:13:27] I remember one time when I was when God
[1:13:28] was dealing with me and I was in the
[1:13:30] world I remember being on the dance
[1:13:31] floor and that brother this man he was
[1:13:32] having such a good time you know party
[1:13:34] and everybody going crazy I'm sitting
[1:13:36] here miserable and I'd look at that man
[1:13:38] I'd go I remember telling the Lord I
[1:13:39] said Lord I wish I could be like
[1:13:43] him and maybe you're in that same
[1:13:46] position tonight when you are are at
[1:13:48] church and you look at that man you know
[1:13:50] somebody shouting acting a fool brother
[1:13:52] Gabe's on that fifth row balling and
[1:13:54] crying and a amen and Hallelujah and I'm
[1:13:57] trying my best to keep it down I promise
[1:13:58] I could be louder but I I try to I I do
[1:14:02] cuz I don't want to out preach brother
[1:14:03] Chad but sometimes I'm like oh brother
[1:14:06] you just lift the ear but anyway so but
[1:14:08] but maybe you're in that spot where you
[1:14:10] looking you go I wish I could be like
[1:14:11] that
[1:14:12] brother but you don't know how to be
[1:14:14] that way because you're so bottled

[1:14:20] forward no matter how you feel just keep
[1:14:25] moving
[1:14:27] forward be honest with God that's the
[1:14:29] only thing I can tell you that's the
[1:14:30] only thing that happened that I did that
[1:14:32] I know of and I told the Lord I told the
[1:14:35] Lord I I don't understand I'm better
[1:14:37] than

[1:14:46] attitude I know I shouldn't be feeling
[1:14:48] this
[1:14:49] way and I don't know how to change
[1:14:53] it but some somehow some way in his
[1:14:56] grace and mercy he changed it for
[1:15:01] me just and and and so when we go
[1:15:04] through those moments when we go through
[1:15:07] those dark times friends just keep
[1:15:14] moving God's going to see you
[1:15:17] through it's you

[1:15:25] gold let's try it in the fire
[1:15:29] yeah you know we we go through times of
[1:15:33] of life and and we go through bad times
[1:15:37] I uh I wonder if I can brother Franco

[1:16:45] there and a lot of times we spend all
[1:16:48] our time trying to stay
[1:16:51] there and and and brother Brenham tells
[1:16:54] us he says we put too much on
[1:16:57] mountaintop experience of dancing and
[1:17:00] shaking and jumping around instead of
[1:17:01] all night prayer
[1:17:03] meetings down in the valley of decision
[1:17:07] where you have to come down there and
[1:17:09] meet God and really pour out your life
[1:17:13] until something takes
[1:17:17] place you know I I don't understand why
[1:17:21] it took so long for me to get where I'm
[1:17:23] at
[1:17:25] you know been serving the lord since
[1:17:29] 2001 man and sometimes I look and I
[1:17:32] think God I am so far away man I'm not
[1:17:36] talking about no way out sin but you
[1:17:37] know what I mean when you look inside
[1:17:38] you you go God I you hear the message
[1:17:41] and you you see the things coming across
[1:17:44] the pull pit and all the different
[1:17:46] brothers and you're just like oh Lord

[1:17:53] many did oh how many walk walk out
[1:17:55] fileted oh brother oh it fileted me oh
[1:18:00] man fileted up one side down the other

[1:18:05] at the end of it you still feel
[1:18:08] loved Hallelujah you know what I mean
[1:18:11] like like like like you like oh Lord I
[1:18:14] know I'm coming up so short but I'm so
[1:18:17] encouraged how how does that man can't
[1:18:20] do that that that's listen friends if
[1:18:23] that was you that was God talking to you
[1:18:28] that was the grace of God showing you
[1:18:30] your shortcomings amen right but he
[1:18:33] didn't show you your shortcomings so
[1:18:36] that so that he could you know like
[1:18:37] dangle it
[1:18:39] like you know like a older
[1:18:45] brother right look at
[1:18:49] that
[1:18:52] Anthony yeah
[1:18:55] yeah but but God don't God don't do that
[1:19:00] amen right he you know that's That's
[1:19:03] what Satan
[1:19:06] does That's what Satan does Satan
[1:19:10] Satan
[1:19:12] Satan I'll show you what he does he
[1:19:15] loves to do this Satan will put
[1:19:17] something before you brother brother
[1:19:19] Franco could you pull up that one with
[1:19:21] that little
[1:19:22] trap that little trap it it's back it's
[1:19:25] back a few
[1:19:27] slides making it work
[1:19:30] today there you go right there yep Satan
[1:19:35] Satan loves to trap you right and and
[1:19:40] and what he'll do is is he'll make you
[1:19:44] curious no matter how old you are how
[1:19:46] young it works with all of us he makes
[1:19:50] you
[1:19:51] curious and then once he makes you
[1:19:53] curious he he'll set the
[1:19:57] Trap right then then once once he sets
[1:20:01] the Trap and he and he has you then he
[1:20:05] shames
[1:20:10] you then once he shames
[1:20:13] you he'll isolate
[1:20:18] you and then once he isolates you he
[1:20:21] puts fear on you oh yeah
[1:20:25] and then once he puts fear on you then
[1:20:27] he wants to destroy
[1:20:29] you
[1:20:31] amen and and you know we ought have
[1:20:34] learned that by
[1:20:36] now but for some odd reason we still
[1:20:39] can't get it through our
[1:20:41] brains the process that he
[1:20:44] uses and and we live in such an age of
[1:20:48] deception where there's so many devices
[1:20:51] and so many ways in which he can trap
[1:20:53] you because remember Satan sees the
[1:20:57] whole Spectrum yeah not only does he
[1:21:00] know you but he also knows your
[1:21:04] daddy right right and then he don't stop
[1:21:09] there he was here when your granddad was
[1:21:12] there
[1:21:14] right and iniquity will go into the
[1:21:16] third and fourth generations and he
[1:21:19] knows what got great Granddad yeah amen
[1:21:23] and then he knows that family strain
[1:21:25] that follows that family yeah right amen
[1:21:30] and and you are sitting
[1:21:33] up right because he sees
[1:21:38] Generations think about it friend that's
[1:21:39] why with no match for him because you
[1:21:42] may think you got but he'll he'll he'll
[1:21:43] he'll hit you with a curveball that you
[1:21:45] never thought was
[1:21:46] coming and you then he'll say it's your
[1:21:49] fault yeah when in reality it's not
[1:21:54] of fact brother brandom said it could
[1:21:55] have been Grandpa's fault and you're
[1:21:58] just carrying
[1:22:01] it I'm all over the place but I got the
[1:22:04] quote we can look I'll show you later
[1:22:06] on and and so and so when when Satan
[1:22:10] moves look look just like Judas what did
[1:22:12] what did he do to
[1:22:13] Judas Judas saw the 30 pieces of silver
[1:22:17] and he saw such value he saw more value
[1:22:20] in the 30 pieces of silver than he did
[1:22:23] the king of kings and Lord of Lords the
[1:22:25] man that turned water to wine fed the
[1:22:29] multitudes but somehow in that Satan per
[1:22:33] presented that in such a way that he'd
[1:22:35] look at 30 piece you think of it I mean
[1:22:37] I don't know what that was but wasn't 30
[1:22:39] pieces of gold it's
[1:22:41] silver but he presented it in such a way
[1:22:43] that trapped him he saw greater value in
[1:22:45] that and the moment that he he he he
[1:22:48] accepted that that bargain and he kissed
[1:22:51] the Gates of Heaven
[1:22:55] on his Road to
[1:22:59] Hell where was the value in that 30
[1:23:01] pieces of
[1:23:04] silver he he tried to give it back to
[1:23:06] the priest he wanted to give it back he
[1:23:08] didn't see no value in it after it was
[1:23:10] done and that's the same way Satan does
[1:23:12] all of us maybe maybe not maybe not uh
[1:23:16] uh selling Christ but but he'll he'll
[1:23:19] show us uh something that looks valuable
[1:23:23] young people he'll make you
[1:23:28] curious and then you'll see the value in
[1:23:31] it and you'll know it's wrong but you
[1:23:33] see the
[1:23:35] value you know you shouldn't do it
[1:23:38] pastor preached on it brother preached
[1:23:40] on Mom and Dad
[1:23:42] devotion yeah right but
[1:23:47] curiosity it gets so intense that you
[1:23:50] just can't take it
[1:23:55] right and then the moment you
[1:23:58] fulfill that desire whatever it may be
[1:24:03] then where's the
[1:24:07] value how many y'all know what I'm
[1:24:10] talking about come on brothers and
[1:24:11] sisters emptiness yeah shame amen void
[1:24:17] emptiness yeah desolate dark there's no
[1:24:21] hope why should I try I keep messing up
[1:24:25] and Satan's going amen amen
[1:24:30] amen right that's how he works that's
[1:24:34] how he works and then what happens is
[1:24:37] his shame becomes so so great you know
[1:24:40] better the prophet said Pastor said
[1:24:43] Church said Brother Kyle
[1:24:47] said right brother Kyle just taught on
[1:24:49] it he just
[1:24:56] and then you go well there ain't no
[1:24:57] there's just no sense of me even trying
[1:24:59] I mean and he goes that's exactly right
[1:25:01] yeah yeah yep yep yep yep and then
[1:25:04] before you know it where you at you're
[1:25:06] isolated I'm not worthy to go to youth
[1:25:08] meeting I'm not worthy to go to church
[1:25:11] I'm
[1:25:14] not and he wears on you day after day
[1:25:17] after day but listen that's why it's so
[1:25:20] important for us to have
[1:25:22] Fellowship listen whenever you you have
[1:25:24] those times I I would I would highly
[1:25:28] encourage you to find somebody to talk
[1:25:32] to and listen parents the the worst
[1:25:36] thing you can do is be hard on your
[1:25:39] child when they when they confess to you
[1:25:42] something they did
[1:25:43] wrong it's the worst thing you can do
[1:25:46] the moment you go I
[1:25:51] to you just help them lay the first
[1:25:54] brick in building a wall
[1:25:57] yeah amen and if you look back at your
[1:26:00] life what it is you're you're venting
[1:26:03] not because they did it but because you
[1:26:11] failed and and and and what we have to
[1:26:15] do is is realize wait a minute wait a
[1:26:18] minute wait a minute wait a minute whoaa
[1:26:20] whoa
[1:26:21] whoa
[1:26:22] stop stop
[1:26:25] realize who's in
[1:26:28] control you you have to enter in to the
[1:26:32] sufferings of your children you you know
[1:26:34] you know remember remember when brother
[1:26:35] brandom tells sister mey honey she needs
[1:26:38] a
[1:26:39] buddy
[1:26:41] amen do you if you look at that remember
[1:26:44] brother brandham says honey this is in
[1:26:46] the name of the Lord
[1:26:48] yeah right he think about
[1:26:52] that thus saith the the Lord yeah to us
[1:26:57] that's right as parents yeah is at some
[1:27:00] point in time your child is going to
[1:27:02] need a buddy and brother Benham says
[1:27:05] honey he tells me I know I'm Comming to
[1:27:07] you this is in the name of the
[1:27:11] Lord so so sometimes we look at Thunders
[1:27:15] and seals and that's the name of the
[1:27:17] Lord and he's discernment but your child
[1:27:20] needs a buddy in this dark hour
[1:27:25] God would so see it fit that he would
[1:27:28] tell he would give us elect of God by
[1:27:31] his grace parental advice in the name of
[1:27:34] the Lord your child will need a buddy at
[1:27:38] some point in time of
[1:27:42] life why because we can we can get so we
[1:27:46] miss the
[1:27:47] transitions we miss the transitions in
[1:27:50] parent you say brother Gabe you you only
[1:27:51] got one teenager I know and I'm sorry
[1:27:54] but I forgive me I I ain't trying to
[1:27:57] walk in an area I don't know and so but
[1:28:00] I you understand what I'm saying I
[1:28:02] hopefully when all of them get there
[1:28:03] I'll be able to still live there so bear
[1:28:05] with
[1:28:06] me but but but the thing of it is is is
[1:28:10] is is a lot of times we get so uh
[1:28:13] revelated that we lose sight of where
[1:28:16] they are
[1:28:18] at um let let me find this and let me
[1:28:21] find this real quick um
[1:28:24] brother brother brother brother Franco
[1:28:26] it's uh two slides well you know what
[1:28:29] here hold on take a break brother take a
[1:28:31] break you rest brother you just rest
[1:28:35] watch brother brandom is talking to
[1:28:38] Billy Paul and and they go to a they go
[1:28:41] to a restaurant right and uh and and and
[1:28:45] and and there's the music the juke box
[1:28:47] is playing in the corner and
[1:28:52] so and so brother Braham said
[1:28:54] say and and and uh brother B says course
[1:28:58] Billy just an adolescent you know he
[1:29:01] said Daddy ain't that a pretty
[1:29:08] song
[1:29:09] now let's put that back now today when
[1:29:14] we go to
[1:29:20] Applebee's and your child says Oh Daddy
[1:29:23] ain't that a pretty song didn't I tell
[1:29:25] you that's
[1:29:31] wor but watch what brother brandham says
[1:29:35] daddy ain't that a pretty song I said
[1:29:37] what song I didn't know I just isolated
[1:29:40] myself from
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:44] it but I want you to understand and see
[1:29:48] his his his parental wisdom though he's
[1:29:52] farther down the road than his
[1:29:55] child he still has enough understanding
[1:29:58] to realize my child ain't even on the
[1:30:05] road and he says he says he says I just
[1:30:10] isolate myself from it I didn't want to
[1:30:13] hear it and he said you know Daddy he
[1:30:15] said you just study the Bible so much
[1:30:17] and pray so much till the only thing you
[1:30:19] can think about is Jesus Christ
[1:30:26] amen I said thank you
[1:30:28] honey you know some
[1:30:35] that but he still has
[1:30:38] enough cuz he's
[1:30:40] Isola I wonder friends read we pop off
[1:30:43] to our children are we missing the
[1:30:46] isolation right we got the head
[1:30:49] knowledge but it we got the quote
[1:30:52] books but you know when it's son a man
[1:30:54] returns he's not going to look at your
[1:30:57] Mac he ain't coming for your
[1:31:00] windows he ain't going to look at your
[1:31:02] files on your phone he's not going to
[1:31:04] look at your books on the bookcase yeah
[1:31:07] cuz that's not the best that's not the
[1:31:08] faith he's coming back
[1:31:13] for and so the prophet says he says
[1:31:18] thank you honey I sure appreciate that
[1:31:21] that's just all you have on your mind
[1:31:23] mind I said that's all I want on my mind
[1:31:27] is the Lord
[1:31:29] Jesus but the thing of it is and and
[1:31:33] sure we can identify with that but what
[1:31:36] I love is to be able to see his inside
[1:31:38] at
[1:31:40] parenting cuz a lot of times friends we
[1:31:43] think our children are supposed to be
[1:31:45] farther down the road than what they
[1:31:46] really
[1:31:47] are and we don't give them the grace and
[1:31:50] the longsuffering that they need to even
[1:31:52] get on that road right amen just because
[1:31:55] they was baptized at an early age and
[1:31:57] they've lived good and they they never
[1:31:59] had television they never had this and
[1:32:01] they never had D and you can't tell you
[1:32:03] don't think when they go to Walmart that
[1:32:05] that music don't catch them you don't
[1:32:07] think they have that struggle and if we
[1:32:09] don't if we don't explain that to them
[1:32:12] and then talk to
[1:32:14] them and let them know hey I remember
[1:32:17] where you were
[1:32:22] at cuz remember they need to know you
[1:32:26] know I tell you if there's one thing my
[1:32:28] children will know how to do when they
[1:32:30] get older is
[1:32:32] repent cuz I do it before him all the
[1:32:38] time you know I hope there's not a
[1:32:41] parent in here I hope you ought to be
[1:32:42] able to you listen if you can look back
[1:32:45] at your life and go yeah I've never done
[1:32:47] that then brother
[1:32:50] sister you got some pride you need to
[1:32:52] deal with
[1:32:54] yeah and you know what you're doing
[1:32:57] you're missing sight that you're raising
[1:32:59] the elect of
[1:33:01] God and they deserve a sorry just as
[1:33:04] much as I do or anybody else
[1:33:06] does if you do something
[1:33:09] wrong just because your daddy or Mama
[1:33:12] does not make you immune from repenting
[1:33:15] to your
[1:33:17] children come on friends but what
[1:33:20] happens is is we think well those are my
[1:33:22] children and I
[1:33:25] no no no no no no no uhuh no no no no no
[1:33:29] no they're God's
[1:33:31] children right and and you know you know
[1:33:35] you know why listen I I'll tell you this
[1:33:37] the moment you do what it to do it's not
[1:33:40] just teaching your children repentance
[1:33:42] but it's also you learning
[1:33:44] humility cuz it's really humbling to go
[1:33:46] to a 6 Seven 8 year old and
[1:33:50] go sorry
[1:33:55] amen but it's also
[1:33:58] liberating amen because really you say
[1:34:01] yeah but we're supposed to make you're
[1:34:02] going to make
[1:34:04] mistakes that's the whole point listen
[1:34:07] friends that's why we need the grace of
[1:34:09] God that but but the thing of it is is
[1:34:11] we got to get out of our listen you're
[1:34:14] living in a fallen world and in a fallen
[1:34:16] condition and I don't care how much your
[1:34:18] name is on the Lamb's Book of Life you
[1:34:20] still make mistakes you still get carnal
[1:34:22] you still get in the flesh
[1:34:26] yes and and so it takes us it takes
[1:34:31] humility it takes humility to be able to
[1:34:34] Humble ourselves and say I made a
[1:34:36] mistake I'm
[1:34:37] sorry I shouldn't have said it like that
[1:34:40] I got under pressure you know we make
[1:34:42] mistakes and listen and you know the
[1:34:44] thing of it is then really what that
[1:34:46] does is that becomes a teachable moment
[1:34:49] cuz then you then your children realize
[1:34:50] okay wow dad makes mistakes okay I see
[1:34:53] the Chris thing I see him living this
[1:34:55] life he makes mistakes he repents he he
[1:34:57] does love God man he don't just act that
[1:35:00] way at church and man amen they may
[1:35:03] never say it cuz remember brother
[1:35:06] Brenham says you'll live your best and
[1:35:08] your worst in front of your
[1:35:11] children and a lot of times we leave it
[1:35:14] up to the youth camp or special services
[1:35:18] or Brother Kyle or whoever you know uh
[1:35:22] uh to to to to to to bring them to an
[1:35:25] experience but actually brother brandom
[1:35:27] tells us that we're the best person to
[1:35:30] do
[1:35:31] it he actually says because they have
[1:35:34] your
[1:35:36] nature that's right but what's he
[1:35:39] telling us he's telling
[1:35:41] us they are you but then you have to be
[1:35:45] able to say hey I did that
[1:35:47] too man I struggle with that same thing
[1:35:50] and oh man I have that problem too and
[1:35:53] you know what you're Granddad he used to
[1:35:55] do that to me and and he shouldn't have
[1:35:57] done that to me and here I am oh man I
[1:35:59] thought I was I'm just as bad as him
[1:36:04] and see but what are you doing you're
[1:36:08] actually making Christianity
[1:36:11] real you're making it real friends
[1:36:14] because and I'm not talking about I got
[1:36:16] to apologize my children beating my
[1:36:17] children I went out on drunk I'm not
[1:36:19] talking about that you understand what
[1:36:20] I'm saying but I'm talking about the
[1:36:22] littlest thing I shouldn't have been
[1:36:24] frustrated when I said I got I got upset
[1:36:26] and I said that in the wrong tone and
[1:36:28] I'm sorry see right you know the the
[1:36:32] other the other day brother Chad I I I
[1:36:34] made sure the girls listen to that one I
[1:36:36] said you remember what brother Chad said
[1:36:37] remember brother Chad said uh he was
[1:36:39] doing something with the boys and he was
[1:36:41] all and then sister Angie goes what are
[1:36:43] y'all yelling about he's like we ain't
[1:36:44] yelling what are you talking
[1:36:47] about remember that see I I I I listen I
[1:36:50] tell the girl remember that one you was
[1:36:52] listening to that one you
[1:36:55] [Laughter]
[1:36:57] see but because girls are sensitive I
[1:37:00] don't have no boys like that but but
[1:37:02] there's still this boy in me right and
[1:37:05] so and so listen we have to realize that
[1:37:07] Brother Kyle right I figur I get you
[1:37:10] know I fig y'all get a little amen sign
[1:37:12] out there somewhere you
[1:37:14] know man y'all didn't have them
[1:37:17] I well I tell you
[1:37:19] what a man brother
[1:37:24] amen Callie where you at there
[1:37:29] amen man I feel you at least at least
[1:37:31] get a teach it brother out of
[1:37:35] here I'll leave these up pull Pit
[1:37:38] Brother Chad case Wednesday night
[1:37:40] brother you may need them man make your
[1:37:43] own
[1:37:46] copies right but but the thing of it is
[1:37:49] friends
[1:37:50] we I don't know I I got to close I'm
[1:37:53] close I just to me I just want to say
[1:37:56] this I I just I'm so thankful if if you
[1:37:59] don't get anything out of this I just
[1:38:02] I'm so appreciative of the grace of God
[1:38:05] his hand of Mercy friend he is he's so
[1:38:08] precious he he he's so faithful he's so
[1:38:11] loving he's so kind and and when when we
[1:38:14] look when we go through life and we we
[1:38:16] we struggle through things and then and
[1:38:18] then God just I tell you just like what
[1:38:20] I was telling brother Ben I know I know
[1:38:23] why he back there and now I know brother
[1:38:25] Ben if anybody wants to know that's a
[1:38:26] spot back there it ain't just for them
[1:38:28] children there must be something special
[1:38:31] about that area cuz brother when I got
[1:38:33] to that spot I'm almost I'm 9 95% sure
[1:38:37] it was like God flipped a light
[1:38:39] switch and and I and I'll be honest with
[1:38:42] you there's no way humanly possible for
[1:38:45] that to happen the condition that I was
[1:38:49] in and and the thing of it is it was
[1:38:52] everything's over
[1:38:54] you know you know whenever I put
[1:38:55] whenever I found my seat I don't know
[1:38:57] two three F Wars behind and uh I I hear
[1:39:01] this big old amen back behind me like
[1:39:03] who's this brother back in Amen brother
[1:39:05] Shay and I'm thinking
[1:39:07] man right and uh and then I made a
[1:39:11] couple more rows
[1:39:12] up they like man this pretty good I made
[1:39:15] a couple more rows up but but here's the
[1:39:17] thing it was instantly instantly my amen
[1:39:22] came back God
[1:39:24] I'm I'm talking about I'm talking
[1:39:26] brother listen for for almost seven
[1:39:29] years you couldn't hardly hear amen it
[1:39:32] just it wasn't
[1:39:33] there because but I I'm not a person
[1:39:37] that can amen just because I got I got
[1:39:40] to feel it you know what I mean no
[1:39:43] matter how true it's coming from the
[1:39:44] pull pit like in my heart I could go
[1:39:46] that's right yes he's right on the
[1:39:48] message that's what brother bam taught
[1:39:50] that's exactly right yes but sometimes
[1:39:54] you can't vocalize it because it's just
[1:39:56] not
[1:39:59] there right but somehow
[1:40:03] supernaturally it's just the grace of
[1:40:05] God from the very first service brother
[1:40:07] it was just
[1:40:09] instantaneous Deliverance is the only
[1:40:11] thing I can say amen and and so to me
[1:40:15] number one the sanctuary I know it's not
[1:40:17] the sanctuary but just this place the
[1:40:19] people the atmosphere brother I'm just
[1:40:23] so thankful for God's grace and I so
[1:40:27] appreciate the Lord Jesus and what he's
[1:40:29] done for us not just me but my family
[1:40:33] and and if and if as the music musicians
[1:40:36] can come I don't know how long I've been
[1:40:38] but I don't want to go too long I and
[1:40:40] and so
[1:40:42] uh I I I I just want to encourage you
[1:40:45] friend I don't know if there's somebody
[1:40:46] out here like that listen just keep
[1:40:48] moving forward listen look God is no
[1:40:51] respector a person that's why it's so
[1:40:54] important for us to to be to to realize
[1:40:57] God's word that if if God listen how
[1:41:02] many of us as young people you children
[1:41:04] if daddy tells you something how many's
[1:41:06] ever called Dad on the carpet and go you
[1:41:10] said right you got to be careful right
[1:41:13] DZ because you know the moment you say
[1:41:16] we're going to
[1:41:17] do it hey boom done deal hey nuh-uh that
[1:41:23] that
[1:41:24] dad on you Dad you said zip
[1:41:29] it right remember you that Dad y'all
[1:41:32] know what I'm talking about when you say
[1:41:33] well we will go e and there you got to
[1:41:36] you got to put that disclaimer in there
[1:41:39] right because you got to put all kind of
[1:41:41] little catch things and just in case
[1:41:44] weather's good we have no problems
[1:41:46] and oh come on dad I get no I got to get
[1:41:49] the amen sign out again right you young
[1:41:52] people ought to be like Amen brother
[1:41:54] Gabe I hear it all the time you know Dad
[1:41:56] lifts out the he's got the this the
[1:41:58] sheet in his like he's got all these
[1:42:00] disclaimers like sign here right right
[1:42:04] but but the thing of it is with god with
[1:42:08] if God says something he is obligated to
[1:42:11] it and God has said something to every
[1:42:14] one of us every one of us he said this
[1:42:18] to us and if he did it if he did it for
[1:42:22] one
[1:42:23] he has to do it for all right
[1:42:27] amen now that may seem very very
[1:42:30] Elementary but we're supposed to be a
[1:42:33] child and and I think sometimes
[1:42:36] sometimes as as we uh we we we get so
[1:42:40] focused on being the
[1:42:43] bride but but there's also other facets
[1:42:46] of our Christianity we're also supposed
[1:42:48] to be as a
[1:42:51] child right still supposed to have that
[1:42:54] childlike mentality because we'll know
[1:42:57] Wise enter Heaven if we don't have that
[1:43:00] and so God gives us those different
[1:43:02] things to show us and teach us not only
[1:43:05] who he is but who we
[1:43:07] are right we can get so elevated but
[1:43:10] listen I hope this encourages you that
[1:43:13] that if if if you can if if brother Gabe
[1:43:16] can be in that position and then he can
[1:43:19] be transformed instantly you say brother
[1:43:22] you say god brother Gabe wasn't praying
[1:43:25] brother Gabe wasn't studying he wasn't
[1:43:28] brother Jeremy one of them I think it
[1:43:29] was brother Jonathan uh bom gner he was
[1:43:32] like yeah he's like take it EAS this H
[1:43:33] us brother I know you got Revelations
[1:43:35] stacked up and I'm like oh
[1:43:38] boy ain't no Revelations over here
[1:43:41] brother you know but it was where I was
[1:43:45] at it cuz I you can't make something
[1:43:49] happen sometimes you go through dark
[1:43:52] times but I tell you friends I would
[1:43:54] never I wouldn't change any of it
[1:43:56] because where I'm at now where where I
[1:43:59] see my family at where I see the growth
[1:44:02] in my my my wife my
[1:44:05] children friends to me that's
[1:44:08] Eternal that's right and and and and and
[1:44:11] so maybe maybe maybe you going through a
[1:44:14] portion of it to this morning I don't
[1:44:15] know maybe young people listen Maybe Dad
[1:44:19] mom's on the mountain top and you're in
[1:44:20] the valley
[1:44:23] sometimes that can happen
[1:44:25] too right but listen that that same
[1:44:28] mountain tops for you maybe it's just
[1:44:31] the way you're looking at it because
[1:44:32] you're praying the wrong
[1:44:34] way and so and so maybe maybe you got to
[1:44:37] look in a different angle step back a
[1:44:40] little bit and go wait a minute what
[1:44:41] what God what what are you trying to
[1:44:45] teach me maybe sister you play something
[1:44:47] softly whatever is on your
[1:44:50] heart I don't know may maybe maybe
[1:44:52] listen this yes maybe you're hiding
[1:44:59] something maybe you know a lot of times
[1:45:03] we don't talk about unconfessed
[1:45:08] Sin but I wonder how many have something
[1:45:11] that they're
[1:45:14] hiding you you're caught in that
[1:45:16] trap it's just a it's just you're going
[1:45:19] around the mountain I'm going to do
[1:45:21] better I know I can and then something
[1:45:23] comes back up and it's just like catches
[1:45:25] you and there's no way for you to break
[1:45:27] from
[1:45:30] it and you the value is right there and
[1:45:35] then in a moment's time you throw away
[1:45:37] the bag of money and you're like I it's
[1:45:40] pointless listen you are not the only
[1:45:44] one that's been
[1:45:47] there the reason why I say it to you cuz
[1:45:49] I've been there too
[1:45:53] but I but I want you to know there's a
[1:45:55] reality in Christianity that Jesus
[1:45:57] Christ can set you free from
[1:46:00] it a lot of times it's pride and we
[1:46:03] won't we won't humble ourselves on you
[1:46:07] say you say Dad you're in a valley right
[1:46:10] now well maybe you got some confession
[1:46:13] to do to the
[1:46:17] [Music]
[1:46:21] children mom
[1:46:23] you know but so many times we want to
[1:46:26] insulate ourselves and and we want to
[1:46:28] protect ourselves and we let pride and
[1:46:31] all those different things but God's
[1:46:33] trying to chip away at
[1:46:36] those but you have to be honest with
[1:46:40] yourself it don't matter how many years
[1:46:42] you've been in this and how long and
[1:46:45] raised in it listen you're still a a
[1:46:47] fallen human being and Fallen flesh and
[1:46:50] and you have mistakes just like
[1:46:52] everybody else
[1:46:53] else maybe you need to humble yourself
[1:46:56] under the mighty hand of God and
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:02] confess sometimes we let unconfessed sin
[1:47:05] hinder us for so many
[1:47:09] years and really it's
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:14] Pride we're so ashamed of ourselves and
[1:47:18] then we push it off and we push it off
[1:47:20] you know you you you look at that that
[1:47:23] woman that brother brandham discerned
[1:47:25] and that woman that cheated on her
[1:47:28] husband she's a Sunday school
[1:47:31] teacher she had forgot about
[1:47:37] it there's one quote well brother Bram
[1:47:40] says brother Braham says you need to
[1:47:42] confess that to your husband and she
[1:47:43] said I did he said you did but not all
[1:47:46] of
[1:47:48] [Music]
[1:47:50] it how many things do we leave
[1:47:55] out and it's because of Pride because we
[1:47:58] don't want to admit that part of it
[1:48:02] we're okay with this but that's just too
[1:48:04] much I and then we try to reason
[1:48:08] it and then we wonder why we're hindered
[1:48:11] in our Christian
[1:48:13] walk right it may not be adultery
[1:48:16] friends but whatever it is the point of
[1:48:18] it is it's
[1:48:19] Pride it's Pride that gets in our way
[1:48:22] and then and then that Fang uh uh and
[1:48:25] and we'll push it aside push it aside
[1:48:27] push it aside push it aside but then we
[1:48:29] wonder why we go through so many years
[1:48:32] of not having that total Victory what
[1:48:35] was that thing you pushed aside for
[1:48:38] [Music]
[1:48:41] years maybe you forgot about
[1:48:43] it but brother brandham says it's still
[1:48:46] in that
[1:48:50] subconscious how many would like how
[1:48:53] many how many wants the Holy
[1:48:57] Spirit may maybe maybe you
[1:49:01] forgot but if you don't have that
[1:49:04] Victorious life and you and you've been
[1:49:06] in that Valley for so long to say listen
[1:49:09] just ask God and say Lord is did I do
[1:49:15] that do I have pride in that way that's
[1:49:19] blocked me some way from my the full
[1:49:22] full access to all my Redemptive
[1:49:28] blessings how many could raise their
[1:49:30] hand and say Lord I if there is I want
[1:49:33] to
[1:49:36] know Lord Lord Lord help
[1:49:40] me I I I don't want listen friends I'll
[1:49:43] be honest with you this is embarrassing
[1:49:45] to say these things but I would rather
[1:49:47] say it before you now than have it
[1:49:49] flashed on the screen back then right
[1:49:53] because there's no mercy there there's
[1:49:56] no Grace there it's just judgment but
[1:49:58] now we can look to God and Grace can be
[1:50:01] there and we can go Lord I'm
[1:50:04] sorry I made a mistake I was
[1:50:09] wrong I shouldn't have been that
[1:50:15] way maybe we could bow our heads close
[1:50:18] our eyes
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:24] Heavenly
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:28] Father
[1:50:31] Lord
[1:50:33] so
[1:50:37] thankful for the
[1:50:40] grace the
[1:50:42] mercy is from Everlasting to
[1:50:46] Everlasting it's been given to us in
[1:50:49] this last day
[1:50:55] Lord as your Prophet taught us these
[1:50:59] divinely revealed truths are sent to us
[1:51:02] so that we could know how to discipline
[1:51:09] ourselves Lord this message is so real
[1:51:12] and so pure but sometimes Lord it gets
[1:51:15] so hard to be honest with ourselves when
[1:51:18] we see the failures that we actually
[1:51:20] possess
[1:51:23] the
[1:51:24] inadequacies the shortcomings Lord our
[1:51:28] family strains things that are so
[1:51:32] embarrassing we wouldn't want anybody to
[1:51:35] know
[1:51:36] it but Lord we're asking that your Holy
[1:51:39] Spirit would search out our

[1:51:43] to us Lord the things that are a Miss in
[1:51:46] our lives Lord and if there isn't

[1:52:15] the satisfaction that he had been
[1:52:18] forgiven not you had had the
[1:52:20] satisfaction but that he had had it
[1:52:23] God might we have that satisfaction no
[1:52:27] matter how long it takes Lord give us
[1:52:29] that peace that our souls so desire that
[1:52:33] our Spirits might be at rest that our
[1:52:35] minds might be at rest Lord that we
[1:52:37] could have a comfort knowing Lord that
[1:52:39] we've made everything right we've
[1:52:41] overturned every
[1:52:43] stone and Lord if there's something that
[1:52:46] comes up might you give us

[1:56:27] teaching us they're a necessary part of
[1:56:29] our life amen and I so was so encouraged
[1:56:33] by Brother Gabe just being honest just
[1:56:35] opening his heart and being honest amen
[1:56:37] how many appreciate brother Gabe and his
[1:56:39] honesty I love what's real amen and God
[1:56:43] is real this word is real and we need to
[1:56:45] be real amen amen we're not all the same
[1:56:48] but we need to be what God made us to be
[1:56:51] and we need to be genuine in real so I
[1:56:53] appreciated that so much today it
[1:56:55] blessed me and to realize you can go
[1:56:57] through a dark time knowing the truth
[1:57:01] having ministered the gospel knowing
[1:57:03] what's right and wrong you can slip into
[1:57:06] a valley and go through a dark time that
[1:57:07] you can't
[1:57:09] control man it was so encouraging for us
[1:57:11] to hear that from my brother's been
[1:57:13] there you can't control it you can't
[1:57:15] shake it off you can't make it go away
[1:57:18] all you can do is be real about where
[1:57:19] you are and still understand I'm a child
[1:57:21] of God and I believe the word and I'm
[1:57:23] going to keep marching forward and the
[1:57:24] best that was the best advice is just
[1:57:26] keep moving forward no matter where we
[1:57:29] find ourselves up or down high or low
[1:57:32] amen it still has to be forward progress
[1:57:34] even on the mountain toop you got to
[1:57:35] keep moving down into the next Valley
[1:57:37] you can never stop yeah amen we're on a
[1:57:40] journey and in this journey God wants to
[1:57:42] mold character into us and he wants to
[1:57:44] make us into his very likeness and it'll
[1:57:47] take the Mountaintop and the valleys and
[1:57:49] the good and the bad and everything in
[1:57:50] between to shape us just want to keep
[1:57:54] moving forward I wrote down a little
[1:57:56] something while brother Gabe was
[1:57:57] preaching that just it just came to me
[1:57:59] it said in the trial we
[1:58:02] learn in the trial we learn about
[1:58:06] ourselves amen good and bad things not
[1:58:09] every trial produces bad sometimes in
[1:58:11] the trial you realize you really do
[1:58:13] believe sometimes it wasn't till the
[1:58:15] trial came that you knew you really did
[1:58:17] believe but then sometimes you find some
[1:58:20] pride you find some self sufficiency you
[1:58:22] find some things there that you don't
[1:58:24] like either amen so we learn about
[1:58:27] ourselves in the trial and we learn
[1:58:29] about God in the trial we learn about
[1:58:31] his grace we learn about his Mercy we
[1:58:33] learn about his forgiveness we learn
[1:58:35] that his mercies are new every morning
[1:58:37] we find him a deliver we find him a
[1:58:38] comforter we find him all these things
[1:58:41] in the
[1:58:42] trial and we learn the reality of the
[1:58:45] word that it's real that it sustains it
[1:58:49] keeps it encourages it corrects it does
[1:58:52] everything the word was intended to do
[1:58:55] so when it comes to the end you can say
[1:58:58] all things work together for the good I
[1:59:02] thank God for that I thank God for what
[1:59:05] he's done in brother Gabe and his family
[1:59:06] and I'm so glad that he shared that with
[1:59:09] us God bless you brother how many you
[1:59:11] going to be praying for brother Gabe
[1:59:14] tomorrow I don't think he has anything
[1:59:16] to worry about not a thing to be
[1:59:17] concerned about it was wonderful but I'm
[1:59:20] going to start praying for him right now
[1:59:22] cuz I know how it works it won't be
[1:59:24] tomorrow amen amen I just want to remind
[1:59:26] you all we have a fellowship dinner

[1:59:40] word dear Lord Jesus I'm so
[1:59:43] thankful God for your goodness and for
[1:59:45] your mercy we got to witness it Lord
[1:59:48] through a testimony from our brother
[1:59:51] what he's been through Lord the place
[1:59:53] that he didn't want to go through but
[1:59:55] Lord you saw fit to take him there
[1:59:58] because you wanted to show him something
[1:59:59] you wanted to deliver him you wanted to
[2:00:01] show how much you loved him and how
[2:00:04] you'll keep and you'll deliver and that
[2:00:06] you're the one who's in control so thank
[2:00:09] you for the lesson that we all learn by
[2:00:11] that Lord I pray we would walk out of
[2:00:13] here with courage to keep moving forward
[2:00:16] no matter where we are to keep moving
[2:00:17] Lord and you've got a plan for us you
[2:00:19] have a purpose in our life you have a
[2:00:21] purpose in every trial and you know what
[2:00:23] you're accomplishing in our life and God
[2:00:26] with deep sincerity Lord help us not to
[2:00:29] forget the challenge at the end of the
[2:00:30] service to be honest to be forthcoming
[2:00:34] with our mistakes and our sins and our
[2:00:36] failures to repent and to
[2:00:39] confess God if you've pricked anyone's
[2:00:41] heart here all of us were pricked in one
[2:00:43] way or another but I pray we wouldn't
[2:00:45] walk out of here and forget that prick
[2:00:48] that we would we would move on that Lord
[2:00:50] that we wouldn't miss our opportun to
[2:00:52] confess that we wouldn't miss the chance
[2:00:55] that you gave us to be clean to be free
[2:00:58] Lord to be Lord to to Humble ourselves
[2:01:01] but to be free from the trapment of the
[2:01:03] devil for confession is good for the
[2:01:06] soul lord there's a way you have of
[2:01:08] cleansing us and freeing us from the
[2:01:09] snares of the devil and it's when we can
[2:01:11] humble ourselves and confess our wrongs
[2:01:14] and our sins that you can free us from

[2:01:35] when we knew there was something that
[2:01:37] had to be taken care of Lord may we not
[2:01:39] pass by and let it go back into our
[2:01:41] subconscious and move back under the rug
[2:01:43] but Lord now that you've brought it to a
[2:01:45] surface I pray that you'd give each one
[2:01:47] courage to deal with it and take care of
[2:01:49] it that we might be free

[2:01:54] free God we pray that you'd humble us
[2:01:57] forgive us of our pride Lord we're so
