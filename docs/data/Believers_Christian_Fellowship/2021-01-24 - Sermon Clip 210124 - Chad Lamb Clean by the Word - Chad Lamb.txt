TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but they've proven that those filters don't do anything because people get lung cancer by the droves on filtered cigarettes and the same thing's happening in the church amen worldliness is creeping in and they don't have a heart for god amen and they're falling away because they've taken a church filter the church says and the church says and they teach and trying why why would they want a church filter because they've got a taste for the world amen why would a man knowing that that cigarette's dangerous why would he choose a cigarette with a filter because he wants the taste of the cigarette but he knows it's dangerous he meant so he's trying to find a compromise that'll keep him alive amen and still let him enjoy the thing he's got a taste for and the churches have done the exact same thing and all of them are guilty of it amen they still have a taste for the world and they want to be safe from eternal damnation so they stuck a church filter amen over top the world and they filter it out we don't do r-rated movies we just do pg-13 we don't go to rock and roll concerts that we just brought into the church and change the lyrics amen we you see they put out they put a church filter on it because they love the taste of the world god doesn't care how you dress he's only looking at your heart that's partially true he's interested in your heart and when you could dress perfect and have a black heart it doesn't mean anything with god but if you've given your heart to the lord you've given your whole self to the lord and the spirit of god is not a filthy spirit and if the spirit of god lives in you the outside of you will reflect the spirit that's on the inside but a church filter will slap a church creed will slap a church creed and filter they'll explain away the word of god and why do people still drove to churches amen why do they why did churches fill up why do mega churches fill up because people know there's a god and they're afraid of hell [Applause] and so they'll suck through that church filter because they have a taste for the world but god has provided a filter for his children that filter is the word of god and that word of god will not let worldliness through amen it will not let ungodliness through it will not let selfish desire or lust of the flesh or lust of the eye it won't let it through amen the word stops it every time brother bev said the only thing that will get through the word filter is the holy ghost amen and it depends on what you have a taste for and what your desire but if you get a hold of that word and you draw and draw from the word the only thing that's going to come through that revealed word of god is the holy spirit of god amen and if you've got a taste for the spirit of god then you'll draw on the word of god
