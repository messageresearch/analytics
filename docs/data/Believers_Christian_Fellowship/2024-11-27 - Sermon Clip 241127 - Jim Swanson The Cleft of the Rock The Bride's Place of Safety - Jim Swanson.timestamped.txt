[0:00] the reason there was a cliff brother
[0:02] Bram said is
[0:04] because when Moses struck the
[0:08] rock it took a divot or a piece of that
[0:11] rock
[0:12] out and that is why there was a cliff of
[0:16] The Rock and the Clift of the rock Fanny
[0:19] Crosby wrote this song There was Honey
[0:22] in the Rock that's where the bees would
[0:24] make their honey was in that cliff and
[0:26] that Cliff of the rock became more than
[0:29] just an imp depression or a depression
[0:31] in the rock it actually it actually
[0:34] occurred because of unbelief and when
[0:37] Jesus bore your sins and your sorrows
[0:41] and your wounds you were in him when he
[0:43] did that amen and the only way that you
[0:46] can get revelation of that listen to me
[0:47] tonight is that you are actually part of
[0:51] the wound that he suffered for your sake
[0:54] and and I read out of this this uh song
[0:57] of Salon you actually have to crawl back
[1:00] up into that womb for for
[1:03] safety God don't look at me like this
[1:05] now I want you to listen to what I'm
[1:07] saying the wound was your fault you
[1:12] caused the wound in the savior he didn't
[1:14] do it it was your sin that did it and
[1:18] you've got to crawl back up in there and
[1:20] that is your only place of safety is the
[1:23] wor of the word praise God and when the
[1:28] brother B said when they foreset spear
[1:30] in his side the bride was released but
[1:34] she was already in
[1:35] him she was in him already when he was
[1:39] crucified on the cross you crucified him
[1:43] you made him go through the
[1:46] pain and so now the Cliff of the rock is
[1:51] your only safe place it's the only place
[1:55] you can be safe because you caused the
[1:57] pain I caused the pain we caused the
[2:01] pain he was he was wounded for our
[2:06] transgressions the chastisement of our
[2:08] pieces upon him and by his stripes we
[2:12] were healed so we were there weren't we
