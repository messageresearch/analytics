open our eyes [Music] amen is that your heart's cry god will just open our eyes may he rub the i7 fresh this morning that we might see him let's take our bibles and turn to first john first john chapter 2 while we're standing say god bless you this morning it's a wonderful privilege to be here with you i always look forward to this time when we can fellowship around the word amen also wanted to make an announcement that next sunday will be easter sunday april 4th and i've been asked by several people who have communion service and yes we intend to have our normal second communion service and we understand that a lot of people have plans they've had long standing plans they've already made arrangements or even will be traveling and we understand that it's okay but we'll be serving communion for those who are still available in here and would like to take communion so we'll be doing that as normal and let's look at first john chapter 2 first john chapter 2 and verse 15 first john chapter 2 verse 15. love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for your word which is so precious to us lord i pray god as we take these bibles we open them and read lord we can do that mechanically but we need the dynamic power of your spirit to give revelation on your word we pray that you would come now as you promised lord and that you would break the bread of life to us and you would feed us your sheep as we come lord to receive from you have preeminence lord speak your words to these lips we pray in jesus christ's name amen you can all be seated we see this is a familiar scripture we know this but i want to take from this and i want to talk about this morning uh discernment just one word discernment and we know that discernment comes by the word but i want to just labor on that and spend some time talking about this and you know john here tells us that for all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and it's not of the father amen but the world passes away and the lust thereof so all of that will pass away but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever let's turn to james i want to turn to james if we can now james chapter 1 and read one more scripture james chapter 1 and verse 14. james chapter 1 verse 14 but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed when then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death so i want to spend a little bit of time on this you know james is telling us how this works a man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust amen so with the devil the tool that the devil is working with when he's tempting us he's working with our own lusts and we have to recognize that that's why i call this discernment because i want to recognize his tactics brother bam said you have to know your enemy you study your enemy and he talked about in boxing and he also referred to it in war you study their moves and you know their tactics so you know how to fight and and we can study the tactics of the devil amen the best way to do that is from the word of god we've watched what he's done and how he's been defeated amen we can see how he's had victory but we can see how he's been defeated amen and we know what we ought to do in this hour let's turn to genesis chapter 3 and we'll go all the way back to the beginning as i've said so often i've found that when i'm looking at something for me it's always helpful to go to the beginning genesis is the seed i mean it's the beginning everything started in genesis and so it's such a it's such a good place to start and see what's happened what god intended what went wrong what we're suffering with today amen let's go to genesis chapter 3 and begin at verse 1. now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food lust of the flesh and it was pleasant to the eyes lust of the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise the pride of life when when now the woman is being tempted amen and this is the the beginning when we see that he come to not to adam but he come to the woman amen he come to the adam's bride and he came to her with the temptation and he starts off by saying god doesn't know amen god does know that you'll be as god's knowing good and evil you'll not surely die and he starts off contradicting the word amen and that contradiction should have been shocking enough to cause her to run away but after the contradiction he throws out a statement he said god doth know amen that the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and all of a sudden what he did is he touched something in the woman amen and it created a desire a lust for knowledge a wanting to know and all of a sudden instead of rejoicing in all that god had given her and rejoicing in the garden and rejoicing in her mate and rejoicing in the perfection that surrounded her and then she began to fix on fixate on this point god is withholding something from me and see what the reason we want to know discernment so well is because i'm not you know i'm to the point now god has has really worked on me he's been molding me and molding me and i'm convinced there's a lot more molding that needs to take place but as he's molding me i'm no longer convinced with discernment out there are over there over there and you i'm interested in discerning what's going on right here the greatest battle ever fought is fought in the mind of man there's a battle waging between two forces in my mind and i need spiritual discernment to understand what's happening in me amen i i'm not i'm i'm i'm beyond trying to figure out what's wrong with everybody else i've done that so much you know and you say oh look they shouldn't have done that and they shouldn't have done that and if they wouldn't have done this then this wouldn't have happened look that's and the whole time i'm being tripped up by my own lust and tempted in my own lust amen and having all kinds of problems in my own life without any discernment in myself because i'm so good at discerning everybody else find out what's wrong with our mate and what's wrong with our children and the rest of the family and everybody else in the church and everybody at work and we've got them pinned down but that won't help you amen we've got to have spiritual discernment i say it like this if eve would have discerned herself she wouldn't have had to discern the serpent she didn't need to discern the serpent amen because the serpent was being influenced by the devil the devil was using the serpent to get to her she didn't even have to identify that you're being anointed of a devil she didn't even need that if she could just identify what was going on in herself she would know this is wrong because she now she she began to to hunger to lust to desire after something that god told her not to not to partake in and she was doing it and the devil was making as if god was holding something back from her when god had given them everything and isn't that what god does to us i mean what the devil does to us god's blessings abound in us he showers us with blessings showers us with privilege showers us with revelation and remember the devil will come and make us fixate on the thing that we're missing out on or don't have or isn't fixed yet amen what a what a devil and his tactics are good his tactics are highly refined remember it worked in heaven to deceive the angels and then it worked on earth and he's been he's been the mastermind behind the deception and he's been mastering it for 6 000 years with human beings that were of like passions as you amen and so he's got he's got you figured out and whatever personality type you are you can say i'm an introvert i'm an extrovert i'm an a-type i'm a b-type whatever personality you are he has deceived thousands millions of your type so discernment must come by the word and so if eve would have just understood what was going on she should have never entertained the idea she should have never given her mind over to exploring the possibilities amen and but when she did because she was enticed of her own lust he awakened the desire inside of eve and now eve wanted to know something he meant she wanted to be like god and now he's coming down and he's coming right down to her identification of who she is because he comes down and says god does though that the day you eat there of your bs gods and she was already as a god upon the earth adam amen adam was the god of the earth adam and his mate together were joint heirs of the creation they were in the garden ruling and reigning they were gods upon the earth but now amen the sir that the devil comes in and he begins to question her very position and begins to go right to the foundation and right say now god knows that if if you if you eat thereof amen if you partake in this your eyes will be up and then you'll be as gods knowing good and evil amen and he was taking her identity away from her and trying to give it back to her by leaving the word you'll be his gods what was she what was adam what were they upon the earth they were amateur gods but now the devil has stripped her identity away and he's created in her a need now she needs her identity she needs to be as a god we may not think that happens to us but it happens to us all the time we'll explore that as we go and i hope god will reveal it to you as we move forward in this so now because now there's a need in her now she senses that there's a lacking and her identity is in question but she can be as god if shall partake in this and have her eyes open amen and shall know good and evil amen and you realize that that the knowledge of good and evil was not something that god wanted his children to have amen because the knowledge of good and evil came by pain it came by pain because because god when he come down amen and he began to to correct his children then he had to put a a cherubim with flaming swords at the eastern gate of eden amen to prevent them from coming and getting the tree of life and living forever because he says god says now man has become as one of us knowing good and evil satan portrayed it as the end all once you know good and evil you'll be his god amen because there was a fall in heaven there was evil discovered in heaven there was now good and evil that had taken place in heaven and god comes down and says now we we must because they've become the man has become like one of us knowing good and evil amen let's put this flaming cherubim here so that they don't have to live eternal that way because heaven was in a condition and god had recreated on the earth a perfect condition without the knowledge of good and evil but the war that was in heaven was now spilling down into earth and the devil was taking the very thing that god had made for perfection for his children the very love expressed to his children to allow his attributes to be expressed in an arena now without good and evil without a fall yet there was a fall in heaven but not yet here in eden amen and he set this arena where there was not knowledge of good and evil it was just good and that was his love expressed to his children but the the serpent would come now and take god's great love amen and turn it evil saying god is withholding from you but the thing god was withholding with them was because of his great love and now they they would become like gods knowing good and evil and because of that they were driven from the garden man was cursed the earth was cursed everything happened and so now when the the devil had taken and and planted this thought into her mind and now now she because she now has a need now there's a question of identification now the question of who she is now who she is is in question and because who she is in question now she turns to observe the tree before it's as if when you read the scripture she never considered the tree she never looked at it deeply she never spent some time considering it because in the scripture it says verse 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food now all of a sudden she's looking at it and considering it in a different light good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took her the fruit they were of and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did he so now she turned and she began to look at the tree and when she looked at the tree amen she could not discern anything wrong in what she saw you realize she couldn't identify the problem with the tree this is so important they couldn't see anything wrong it was good for food it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she didn't realize she couldn't find anything wrong with the tree what was wrong with the tree is the commandment of the lord not to partake thereof that was the problem it wasn't that you could observe the tree and identify the tree and dissect the tree and find out what's wrong with the tree amen that's going completely backwards she wasn't even supposed to consider it observe it amen analyze it find the fault in it amen it wasn't for her to find the fault in it god had already said don't partake so now by wisdom he begins to sow and turn knowledge and it sows into her wisdom and by wisdom she begins to look at the tree and in her own wisdom because she already desires to be like god the desire was already awakened the identity crisis had already begun and under that now she's looking at the tree and you realize now oh i hope that what's in my heart could come across now because she's an identity crisis her position is in question and god is withholding from her now when she looks at the tree she needs the tree to be good she needs the tree to be good because she's got a problem she's lacking and she wants to rise amen to the level of a god and so now she looks at the tree differently than she's ever looked at it before because before she would walk past from the tree she didn't need the tree she had god she had fellowship with god she had her mate she had perfection but all of a sudden the devil took away her identity now she needed something and she looks at the tree with a need deep inside and now she sees the tree as good we need discernment in this hour this is the hour amen when christ has already come and stood his temptation and he is overcome by the word but he's restored back an eve amen the second eve who's not going to fall by disbelieving the word and she's going to stand in her tempting her trials her testing time and she's going to have to have spiritual discernment by the word but the discernment all out there is not going to work i can discern that homosexuality is wrong i can discern that our school system is failing i can discern that the government is falling apart but what i need to do is discern amen where the devil is trying to get me off the word trying to get me amen with an identity crisis trying to get me to look at what i'm not supposed to look at because that's where real overcoming is in this hour when this bride overcomes amen it'll reverse what was done in the first one that's why god has opened the word to us in this hour so we can see things like we've never seen them before the woman saw the tree was good for food that it was pleasant pleasant to the eyes you know when god gave the commandment for adam not to partake of that tree he never he never said it wasn't good for food and it didn't look good and it didn't make you wise all of these things could have been perfectly true none of what she's seeing may be false or in any way a false observation the problem was there was already a commandment said don't and that's where she failed now you realize eve didn't want to fall eve didn't want to fail she wanted to do right she wanted to do good and then she she was beguiled she was deceived into this brother ben said in the message putting on the whole armor of god from 1962 now we find that this great enemy of god thought now as long as they will believe that word i can never get to them as long as that little family in eden keeps behind that word i can never touch to him neither can he today amen he is still blocked off that's right but if i can use some real good a strategy and just reason out i give some human reasonings because she's human and i can just give human reasonings then we'll we'll win the battle satan and his angels but then eve gave away so therefore we know our enemy by his tactics so what we want to study this morning we know the enemy by his ta by his attacks i'm sorry he said we know the enemy by his attacks maybe you didn't get it just right the way i said it we know our enemy when anyone any spirit any person tries to disagree with god's word remember that's your enemy that's your enemy we know his old attack that's the one he broke the human race down and that's the way he breaks them down yet today and that's the way he gets you away from god is to disbelieve his word and the only way that you can ever stay in fellowship with god and talk to him in the cool of the evening is stay fortified in the word let the curtain of god's word drop all around you and you be a and you be a drop right in the middle of it that's right then you're fortified now in order to do this he has to make it very appealing reasonings and that's the way satan does he's good at the job and he's a good adversary and he makes it appealing he had to make it appealing to eve i'd like to say in this hour if you're going to trip up the bride of jesus christ you better make it very appealing so is he stopped trying to trip up the bride of christ or is he really good at making it very appealing as if there's ever an hour we need discernment this is the hour if there's ever a time that the devil is unleashing every tactic he has to try to hinder somebody amen who would he rather hinder in what age amen than try to stop this bride from coming to full maturity in full manifestation and to take all of the word and stay on the word in the word only amen because brother bam said if he can get one subject to let down on one word then he's got victory over the word of god this is the hour we need spiritual discernment by the word in the message fellowship the prophet of god says when god made a man in the beginning to fellowship with him then this man was in perfect fellowship in the garden of eden he was in perfect fellowship with god and how it must have been on that day when god would come down in the cool of the evening and call adam he and eve would come up and they would worship god and they would fellowship and commune one with the other the reason i i put this in here because i wanted to see how brother brahm described the relationship in the garden because i think it's interesting to note that when the serpent began to deceive the woman and then she began to to take what he was saying and reason it and consider it and knowledge and wisdom and she began to be deceived beguiled by that reasoning and she began to hunger amen to to be like god she there was a lust that came up in her she began to observe the tree and analyze the tree amen i'd like to say it this way if her motives had been completely pure why didn't she wait and ask the father in the cool of the evening she was deceived and thought she was doing right but why not just wait till the father comes down the fellowship until you go to the cathedral and have church and he comes down like brother benham said says children have you enjoyed your day in the garden today why couldn't she have said adam do you know you know this and the serpent told me that and you know this and and can we ask the father when he comes amen this is the very reason some kids won't ask permission from their parents before they do something and then afterwards you say why did you do that well i didn't know you never said why didn't you ask i didn't think to ask yeah you didn't think to ask this is why some people won't ask their pastor won't look up the quotes why because really they don't want to know see we can deceive one another but we can't deceive god and we really have a hard time deceiving ourselves we just keep the truth buried deep we want to be able to say when caught i didn't know but what's the reality deep in our hearts amen that's what god wants god wants something real not a where this is we're far past the age of a church walk and a group thing and just going through the motions god is after reality amen there's going to be real sons of daughters of god on this earth in this hour and they're going to live a real life amen it may not be perfect but it's going to be real when they get it wrong they're going to confess they're wrong they're going to go to god with weepings and say god there was me amen i was wrong i did wrong i had the wrong desire i was tempted and led away by enticed by my own lust god's going to have a real church friends the games of church are over the days of playing games are over who do much is given much is required and we have received much in this hour and the church game and churchiani and church walk is done god is wanting sons and daughters of god who will be real amen who will be genuine amen who will confess their faults and be real with themselves and have real spiritual discernment in their own lives and say where am i really amen what is it i really want why do i want this to be true so much why do i want that to be true why do i want this to be okay these are good questions you know the devil's got us in such a a rat race where we move so fast that we don't meditate because how many times have you done something and blundered and made a mistake and said if i would have just stopped for five minutes i hope i'm not the only one if i would have just stopped and for five minutes and considering my ways you realize this is why amen we we have to actively unplug we have to make a decision to say i've got to spend time with the lord i have to meditate because everywhere around me is trapped trapped trap trap trap trap trap trap trap it's like we're tiptoeing through a minefield and man it's like we're walking through a house full of mousetraps and without spiritual discernment and godly leadership in our lives we're going to step into them and they're painful will we be a son of god absolutely you're still a son of god you're a son of god with a sore leg you're a son of god with regrets you're a son of god with disappointment in your life because you disappointed the lord you're still a son of god but you're a son of god who's suffering amen because we didn't take the time to meditate consider the word where the word is on every decision we start using reasoning and and following somebody else i tell you that's one of the most dangerous things you can ever do is father follow somebody else well i know they're a good believer i know they're a good believer that may be fine and what they're doing may be fine but that's not your justification for repeating the same thing god wants preeminence in this hour and preeminence is total control in first place and there's a bride on the earth that wants him to have that i believe you all want him to have that i want him to have that but what do i have to do i've got to slow down and spend some more time with the lord more time in meditation more time considering my ways brother rem says in satan's eden from 1965 now satan this deceiver is spoken in matthew 24 24 with so much deceit now we find that by his gospel programs of knowledge better education higher ethics civilization and so forth has bewitched the people that wants to serve god into believing his lie eve did not want to do that but but he showed her how it was a more wisdom in it she didn't know she wanted to know she didn't understand she wanted to understand and god told her not to try to understand god wanted her to just obey not understand but she wanted to understand and the devil planted that seed and manipulated that seed and got her to look at the tree and she didn't look at the tree in the light of the commandment she looked at the tree in the light of her wisdom and knowledge but when she was looking at the tree in the light of her wisdom and knowledge she was doing it with lust already having awakened it's amazing when we go back and look over our lives and i'm sure you all are just like me and i'm just like you and there's no real difference between us other than the day we were born in the name we have whether we're male or female but we all have the same tendencies i can look back i look back on decisions i made and things that i've done and i shudder how could i have done that like now it's so obviously wrong now it is so i see it so clear why why would i ever be so deceived why and you know we say it like this why would i be so dumb why did i do that and cause myself pain and grief that i have today why didn't i just this and why didn't why because if you could place yourself back there what happened is you were led away of your own lust and enticed amen and the reason you did it is because something in you was already awakened and wanted to do it and now a year ten years five years down the road amen you don't want to do that anymore and it's so obvious that that is wrong but back then you were taking and splicing ideas and concepts and religion together amen you were you were cutting and pasting and and molding and manipulating the message in the and the bible to try to bring justification to your actions because there's something we already wanted and because there was something we already wanted we were willing amen to look at the tree again and when we looked at it again this time we couldn't see really anything wrong with it could you imagine eve's regrets 10 years 20 years 30 years later 100 years later see that's why i love this word and this message so much the message of the hour has taken this bible and made it alive to me right now it's not something that happened over there this is something that's happening in me daily this is happening all the time amen i'm right here in genesis chapter 3. you're right in genesis chapter 3 amen and it's time to have some discernment our eyes open amen we have the benefit of being able by a prophetic gift to look back over all of the scripture and see the whole plan and the whole purpose of god and every mistake and all that was the result of that and now we stand here in this day in a position that nobody else has been able to stand in amen and god has equipped us and he's given us his word we need to depend on it to rely on it to feed on it to meditate on it so that we have the tools to overcome the devil's tactics it's going to be by the word amen so let's turn to matthew chapter four i want to look at jesus's temptation in the wilderness and if you just bear with me and allow me i'd like to break it down and bring it home personal to us now let's look at chapter four verse one then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil boy that doesn't sound like that was very nice of the holy spirit i thought when i got the holy ghost everything was going to be good jesus was led up of the spirit into the wilderness this is immediately after his baptism immediately after the light comes down god says this is my son in whom i'm well pleased immediately after his baptism he meant in his experience amen he the spirit leads him into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and i'll ask you this question which devil tempts you a different one than tempted jesus or the same one you see it's the same devil that tempted him is the same one that through the serpent tempted eve and it's the same one that's coming to tempt you so why are we trying to use reasoning and logic and modern understanding and laodicean mentality to fight the devil let's come back to the word because whatever worked will always work and what failed before will fail again but what worked before will work again amen because it's the same spirit it's the same devils it's the it's the same satan nothing is different they're all the same so we want to know what to do in this hour and we want to know what he's doing verse 2 and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward hungered i want you to see the condition of jesus now he had been fasting 40 days and 40 nights and brother branham said when you're fasting you're not hungry but this was after the fast and now he was hungry he was in a weakened physical condition he was now hungry and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command these stones to be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so here we find jesus in a weakened condition he had come to the river he had been baptized he had this great spiritual baptism when the when god himself came down the holy spirit as a dove descended upon him made the declaration this is the son in whom i'm well pleased amen and the spirit leads him to the wilderness to be tempting 40 days with no food but afterward he was hungry so now he's in the wilderness 40 days since he's eaten now his body has become hungry and the devil comes to him and says if you be the son of god amen make these stones into bread the lust of the flesh now it may we read through these things sometimes and they just seem so we just read it we've read it and we read it and it's so quick to read across but when we really bring it home i want to i want to look at it this way if you be the son of god turn these stones to bread because you're hungry and jesus was hungry and why would a son of god have to suffer if you're a son of god then just turn to stones to bread and end your suffering because you know these tactics that he's using he uses against us too amen if you're a son of god why are you sick if you're a son of god why do you have a financial need if you're a son if you're a son of god amen just fix it it should be fixed but you can be a son of god and be hungry and you can be a son of god and be sick and you can be a son of god and have a financial need and you can be a son of god and be in prison and you can be a son of god and be stoned and you can be a son of god and be all of the above amen you can be a son of god and to be no food in the wilderness amen and god amen is not providing you food in the wilderness amen just so you can withstand the temptation of fixing the problem yourself believing that as a son of god i shouldn't suffer that's a temptation friends that's the temptation when you don't have the cash to buy something and you pull out your credit card it's the same temptation providing something amen i shouldn't have to suffer i should have this i need this i want this if you need it god will provide it i'm not against using a credit card i'm using a credit i'm against using a credit card in place of the money credit card should be used because you got money in the bank but you can't get to it right now you're going to use the credit card and take the money out of the bank and pay it off it shouldn't be used to you know you know citibank is not your provider god is amen we do a lot better off if we let god be our provider and quit trying to fix it ourselves because we think we shouldn't suffer and we're everyone guilty of it and i'm not intending on preaching on credit cards that's not my point today but i'm just showing how how we're tempted you know we feel like well we're we you know by a title we have a position of privilege and in that position of privilege i mean there should be uh no suffering god take care of me god wants me to be happy and we may not verbalize all of that but those are the temptations that are coming this way and sometimes god has you as the son of god and he wants you to be unhappy for a season uncomfortable for a season god could have rained manna in the wilderness jesus could have come out of us fast and had manna in the wilderness but where would the trial and temptation have been where would the overcoming so jesus overcomes by the word he said his written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god then the devil taketh him up into a holy city and sitteth him on the pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou shalt dash thy foot against the stone and jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god now he comes to jesus and he tries to get him to prove his sonship he tries he tries first he tries to get him to provide for himself then he tries to get him to prove his sonship if thou be the son of god if you if you are who you say you are throw yourself down from this pinnacle because the scripture says who gives the angels charge over you what's he he's using the bible i don't know if you've ever been tempted by bible verses or quotes but i have jesus could have taken that bible verse because it was a bible verse and jumped on that bait but he didn't have the leadership of the father he waited for god he didn't make his own decisions he didn't do his own bit he didn't do his own thing he waited for god's bidding he knew how to be an obedient son he knew how that how to give preeminence unto the father amen and so now the devil is trying to get him to move of his own accord amen to prove that he's the son of god and jesus doesn't take debate because he has nothing to prove listen if we could just really get down amen down to business with this amen that you if god has called you filled you with the spirit if god has identified himself to you you have nothing to prove you'd be shocked if we really had time to meditate on it and bring out circumstances you'd be shocked how many times were moved into action and move to make decisions because we're trying to prove who we are and the devil will bring pressure it'll bring a certain pressure in certain circumstances into our life amen and try to get us to jump into action to do something amen just to prove that we're a believer you know if you're a believer you'll do that if you're a believer you'll say that if you're a believer you'll believe this and we go ahead of god but i don't want to get ahead of god i want to be right where god is if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charged concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou shalt dash thy foot against the stone oh i'm telling you friends that's a hard one that that is real bait right there amen taking the the very scriptures and jesus christ is the very manifestation of the word and the devil's using the very scriptures and what's he trying to do first he's doubting his identity and trying to lure jesus into having needing to prove his identity that's the same thing he did with eve back there and it says amen if you if god doesn't know that if you take this fruit then you'll be as gods and she was already as a god and jesus was already son of god but but the devil is putting a doubt he's saying if thou be the son of god amen and you i wonder you have to ask yourself this question he said if thou be son of god cast myself down for the scripture says this it'll be the fulfillment of the scripture i ask you if jesus would have thrown himself down and the angels would have caught him before he hit would the devil have turned into a believer and stopped asking questions would that have been his last question would that have been the evidence to prove that the devil needed to say yep you are the son of god if we would have done that then the next one would be another question well the other scripture says and another scripture says and another scripture said i tell you friends don't go down this road amen trying to prove your identity your identity comes through a new birth through a personal experience of you and jesus christ individuals together and you know that he come and he got you amen he called you well he brought you to himself and united himself with you that's your identification and nothing else amen that life then produces evidence of the life then there's workings that come out of that life amen but you cannot go amen to the workings amen to prove to yourself that you're son of god you've got to go back to the experience of meeting jesus christ personally yourself the devil will tempt us into trying to act like believers act like we have faith take a step of faith with no leadership no godly leadership no will of the father but try to take a step that god's not asking us to take to prove that we're believers try how many people have tried to act nice and be sweet to prove they're a believer how many have tried a reformed life to prove because if you're a believer you'll love everybody if you're a believer how many people come to church when they absolutely don't want to be here because a real christian can't wait for the doors to be open [Laughter] it's the truth these are temptations amen if christ had to deal with them if eve had to deal with it then you and i have to deal with it and we need to have discernment to understand what's going on in us amen not all around us in us why am i feeling pressured to have to do something to prove who i am that's the devil then you could say get thee behind me satan i'm a son of god by the calling of god by by the foreign nation of god i've been predestined my name's written in the lamb's book of life and god revealed it to me personally i don't have to prove anything to anybody scripture says if you resist the devil he will flee i wonder how many people live a life daily trying to prove they're a believer what a miserable way to live believers are supposed to be believers because of a new birth because a change in the soul a new life a new nature the old one's gone and all of a sudden things just begin to change it's not a reformation it's a new life now it doesn't take away your need to make choices that align with the word you're still given pre-moral agency it doesn't mean that you don't obey the word but what it means is by by just simply obeying you'll never prove whether or not you're a son or daughter of god to yourself the only way you'll know is that experience where god himself reveals to you who he is and who you are in him and then who can take that away the devil will try other people may try how many has had the devil try to take that away from you he tried to take it away from eve he tried to take it away from jesus he'll try to take it away from you but you've got to have an experience that holds like an anchor that says no i know i met my savior i know it's real and i know who i am not because i'm worthy not because of my efforts not because of what i'd done but because he revealed to me my name was on the book before the foundation of the world it's not what i did it's what he did for me amen that's who i am by a personal identification of jesus christ revealed personally to me and so now we don't have when that temptation comes i say reject it in the name of jesus christ the next time you feel the need to prove i feel the need i've got to do this i've got to have this dynamic kind of outcropping or i have to have this supernatural kind of thing and i have to have this to prove who i am no god tells you who you are and that's who you always are always where always will be and then as christ lives his life through you he does what he needs to do at the time according to his purpose but it's for his purpose not for your identification he's already given you your identification i want to back up let's go back to matthew let's go at the beginning of chapter four am i going to go up two verses to verse 16 chapter 3 verse 16. and jesus when he was baptized went up straight out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased then he's led of the spirit into the wilderness and this is this devil's second second statement if thou be the son of god cast yourself why would he have to cast himself down from a pinnacle there was a ball of fire that came from heaven from god and said this is my son in whom i'm well pleased why does he have to jump through the devil's hoops to prove anything i tell you if you start trying to prove who you are amen to somebody who's doubting it amen you better just keep you played a plan on keep proving because one evidence won't be enough amen and if you try to prove to yourself amen prove to yourself by whatever action by whatever event whatever it is that you try to say now you know that i proved it to myself i proved it to those around you you'll begin to doubt yourself there's got to be something that takes away doubts in the hour of temptation when the devil tries to bring down there's got to be an anchor that was set somewhere you go back to and say no god did this for me he called me he sought me and he found me and he gave me his revelation and he gave me he gave me his love he gave me the assurance that i'm his amen if we start trying to pin it down on throwing ourselves down from a pinnacle you're gonna have to go back next week and throw yourself off the pinnacle and the week after that and the week after that and the week after that these are the temptations that we still face friends but this bride will overcome by the word job got into a situation where his his righteousness was being questioned job got into the situation where his his friends were now questioning his righteousness they were now asking him you know obviously if all this bad stuff's happening in your life you must have done something wrong and job look at job job was a real believer friends because job never said well i've given so much to the poor and i went to church and i i did all that job was looking at the manifestation for his hour the dispensation he was in and the dispensation he was in was under a substitutionary shed blood of a lamb and he was looking at the lamb he had sacrificed according to the word of god and so he was declaring his righteousness by the word for his day he was not declaring his righteousness by his deeds he was declaring his righteousness by his ob his faith in the word and his obedience to that word and he said i have believed amen god when his children had fallen he offered this sacrifice and we were still under that dispensation and he was doing what god had demonstrated he was acting out the word of god he had faith in the word for his day and when he looked at his righteousness he was looking at a bleeding lamb he wasn't looking at his own deeds and so now when everything falls apart in his life and his friends come to him to accuse him of being a secret sinner having something wrong in his life he doesn't go and comb back through and and prove to them and analyze you know events and conduct and order he goes back to the word and says i've offered the sacrifice i'm covered amen there's an atonement a price has been paid for me there's a blood that's covering from my sin i have righteousness because i took him out of his word amen and listen things happen in the life of believers you believe that tragedies strike things happen difficult circumstances come and then the devil will come right on top of that and if the devil can't get to himself he'll send one of his cronies along and says but didn't you do this wrong and didn't you do that or shouldn't you have done this and what about this and i would do like job did i'd say i believe in the cross of calvary i've confessed my sins i've stood upon that word i believe in the righteousness and the life of the blood is here upon me now i'm clean but you did this wrong yes but it's under the blood i'm clean i've been washed by the water of the word i'm staying with the word and my dispensation i have believed god and i've took him out his word and because i believed god and took him at his word he is imputed unto me righteousness not because i deserved it not because i earned it not because i worked my way up to it not because i woke up every day and decided to do right i did it because he put inside of me something to believe him when i see him and i believe him and i acted upon his word and that is my righteousness that is my cleansing i'm free from sin amen not because i acted right for a while i'm free for sin because i took him at his word and he he slayed the lamb of his son and that blood was the price of my redemption and he sent back that spirit upon me and he's washed me by the water of the word and i have received him in his fullness so why did this tragedy hit i don't know why it hit why is this falling apart why is that falling apart and i don't know why any of it's happening but one thing i know is i'm his and i've believed him and he's made a promise to me that's what job could stand upon in the smyrnan church age from the church age book brother bam says now the lord god almighty says i know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says i know your tribulation i know i am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like israel they wonder if god really loves them how can god be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that is what they asked in malachi 1 verse 1 the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved you saith the lord yet we see yet we say wherein hast thou loved us was not esau jacob's brother saith the lord yet i love jacob and i hated esau and laid his mountains in his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness you see they could not figure out god's love they thought that love meant no suffering you're hungry make those stones in the bread and jesus could say my father didn't tell me to make those stones in the bread but you're hungry does your father want you to be hungry what a tricky question is he not a good father does he not give good gifts to those who ask yes he gives good gifts but his definition of good and mine aren't always the same today hunger might be good you realize the moment that the devil starts getting you to doubt your sonship he can get you to do all kinds of things he can get you to look at things differently accept things you wouldn't accept take actions you wouldn't have taken move amen in places that you don't feel comfortable moving why he's automatically got you to doubt your sonship and now he's pulled a bait and switch he's taken away the security god's given to you and he's offering security through an action a conduct or an evidence but he's taken away the security of divine revealed word of revelation by god of his word he's taken away that security and he's offered a false security if you do this and if you do that and if this changes in your life then you'll be a son of god and tell you once you start chasing that carrot on the stick you're going to get tired because you never get to the carrot it's a temptation of the devil i'd say get thee behind me satan my god has called me from before the foundation of the world and he put no requirement on me other than faith and that not on myself it was a gift from him why now do you put requirements on me it's not my life i live anyway is it the life he lives through me if i could just get myself out of the way then he can do the works it's not my works it's his works my works are filthy rags his works are perfect the devil's trying to get you to take your own works which are filthy rags for the evidence of righteousness instead of taking his righteousness which is faith that is by him and then letting him do his works through you which are perfect you see how close it is it can be so deceptive that's why the hour that we're in requires spiritual discernment by the word and say no i'm not taking your bait devil get behind me i only do that which the father shows me that's where jesus was remember brother branham he was in a meeting and there was some reporters reporting evil about their meetings and and one of his campaign managers started ranting and says what we need is an elijah amen to go out on mark we need a mount carmel showdown we need an elijah to go out there and show him what for and have a real showdown and he was pointing his finger at brother brandon what he was doing is accusing brother branham of not being bold enough because he knew brother benham he knew who he was he knew he was elijah ministry he knew the gift that he had he knew he was a prophet of god and he knew and then he watched over and over what was he was able to do on the platform and he started put he was actually putting pressure on brother brown and say what we need is an elijah amen that can go out there and what's he doing he's using the scriptures and brother branham's office he's actually taking he there's the elijah of the day he's taking scripture out of the bible and he's painting a picture here we are amen all these false preachers amen now they're all falsely uh disclaiming this and saying this and speaking out against the true god amen what we need is an elijah to go down there we need a mount carmel showdown we need somebody we'll take and prove who god is boy that's bait ain't it what if you were sitting there that day and you knew who you were and you knew why you were scripture and you knew what you were called to do and he says something like that but brother brahm says now see brother he said elijah said lord i've done all this at thy bidding he didn't do it on her own he did it because the lord told him to do it and brother branham could he was elijah absolutely amen was there going to come a mount carmel showdown yes in the word amen but he was not going to get ahead of god and take his own idea and what somebody else would what the devil was speaking through another mouth that was a friend of his don't think that can't happen because jesus turned around and to peter and said satan get thee behind me his friend amen was the devil was using the emotions of a friend and the wrong understanding of a friend amen and actually his friend was angry he wasn't interested in what god wanted he was mad because of what they said in the newspaper and he was reacting out of his own emotion and the devil was using that to bring an influence to the prophet of god but the prophet of god knew the word and he went right back to the word and he said elijah did that at god's bidding brother branham wasn't going to move unless god told him to he didn't take that bait and i'm thankful see i'm coming back to this quote in submergent church age you see they could not figure out god's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but god said that his love was elective love the proof of it proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proved truly by the fact they were chosen unto salvation because god has chosen you to salvation through sanctification the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job what is his that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we should be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in us you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered you see when the devil comes to you when you're suffering it says if you be if you're the bride of jesus christ why are you suffering like this i just recently we've been reading through the book of acts just for my own personal study i i take sometimes subjects just for me that i'm enjoying and i was studying through the book of acts and i began to marvel at the supernatural power and deliverance manifest in the apostle paul but what made me marvel is just as much as i saw supernatural deliverance and healing i saw paul suffering just as much the same god who would tell paul don't fear but speak boldly in this city for i have much people and they'll not harm you is the same one that would lead them to another city let him preach and be carried outside the city and stoned he can deliver him in one city and not in another in one they'll release him when they the the the you know the chief captains or the elders or whoever it is in the council will come to the city and they'll intervene on paul's behalf and they'll let they'll let the disciples go and then in another city god won't intervene at all nobody will intervene and they'll take them and beat them and put them in prison why does he do it one time and not another the apostle paul i mean he comes to a blind man opens his eyes lame man amen and the lame man walks oh somebody who fell out of the window is dead he lays his body across and he comes back to life but the scripture said he left his buddy in a city sick paul says timotheus went here and or somebody harassed us and timotheus i left in militum or something like that i left him and milled him sick paul don't you believe in divine healing don't you believe in laying on a hand why did you leave him in that city sick and paul wasn't ashamed to admit it he wrote in his letter i left so and so and milled him sick left him behind so he could recover you see god's ways are not like our ways god knows what he's doing and that's why when the devil comes with this temptation if thou be bride of jesus christ why are you saying if thou be cast yourself down from this pinnacle if thou be claim this if thou be amen just go do that if thou be i'd look at him say i am who i am by the grace of god he called me he who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace he's the one i'm depending on the devil will try to push us and persuade us and take actions and do things amen based off circumstances what other people are thinking what other people are saying amen but if we take away the identity crisis if we just settle the fact that i am who i am by the grace of god that i am a son of god i am a daughter of god by a divine revelation a personal revelation from god i know who i am and if i'm that then i know that my position has been secure is secure will always be secure you'd be surprised how much power that takes away from the devil he's always trying to bring an identity crisis and i would resist that devil if i were you i would recognize him jesus when the lord comes to move us the lord doesn't come to us at least not i've ever seen in the bible he doesn't come to us and said if you were my son you would did you ever read that in the bible if you were my son you would if you were my daughter you would so when they start off when the thoughts start off if you were if you were bride why is this happening with your bride i would say i'm bribed by his choice he knows the way that i take my footsteps are ordered at him amen if he's determined that i'm going to be stoned today then i'm going to be stoned today if he's determined i'm going to be in prison today i'll be in prison if he's determined that these hands shall be laid on the sick and they shall recover they will recover amen it's for his purpose not for my gratification we have to realize we we you know we get things topsy-turvy but god has a plan and god has a purpose and he called paul when he called paul amen he told him i tell him these great things that he must suffer for my name's sake so when god started paul off he started paul off in the truth he said he's a chosen vessel for my purpose but i'll show him what great things he must suffer for my name say so when paul gets the message when god calls paul the saul at this time when god calls him he calls him saying you're called you're a specific you're called for you're chosen for a specific purpose and you're going to suffer paul knew exactly what he was getting into when he was being stoned it wasn't like what's happened i thought i was the stoning didn't change god's purpose the stoning was part of god's purpose imagine disciples who god would supernaturally the apostles supernaturally delivered delivered delivered delivered deliver there came a time when he didn't deliver them he delivered paul but there came a time paul was beheaded he delivered peter supernaturally amen an angel entered into the inner chamber of the prison and the angel woke him up and opened the doors and walked him right out of the prison amen so that peter's life would not be destroyed and peter's life would not be threatened because god had a purpose for peter but when god's purpose was done peter was hung upside down on the cross was he a son of god why didn't god deliver him because it was god's purpose friends and you and i are here to serve god's purpose amen not our own purpose his purpose and his purpose he has a plan and in that plan there's certain things that have to happen in our life for him to get glory for him to display his word for him to overcome his enemy through us and god allows certain things to happen and we cannot go into hysteria every time something happens and begin to doubt our sonship and try to prove who we are but we need to come back to our calling amen make sure your calling and election is sure because things will happen in life disruptions and heartache and difficulty amen it does not mean you're wrong or out of the will of god it might mean you're exactly stepping step and step in the will of god for the fosters of the righteous are ordered to the lord but the devil tries to mess with our identity and when he tries to mess with our identity he tries to get us to take action without the leadership of the holy ghost i don't know about you but that's always been bad for me praise the lord i think it's interesting to note that just a little while after paul left his buddy sick at moledum it wasn't too much longer after that that he was captured in jerusalem and he was taken on a ship and the ship got caught in the storm and there was a shipwreck and he was spilled out on an island he's picking up sticks and he threw the sticks in the fire and out of the fire come a viper and latched on his hand and he shook it off in the fire and the venom never bothered him and this was a man who had a thorn in his flesh a sickness that god wouldn't deliver him from that he bore around daily an infirmity a weakness that he carried brother branham said it seemed like it was his eyes couldn't write his own letters and you would think why wouldn't god heal his eyes amen he's the prophet why wouldn't god heal him so he could write his own letters would have that been more effective paul just could keep writing he doesn't need a scribe but god said unless that will be exalted above measure he allowed a messenger of satan to buff it and here's a man who has an affliction in one part of his body get bit by a venomous snake and the other part of his body and shake it off because the affliction was serving a purpose and the supernatural healing was serving a purpose at the same time the apostle paul's affliction in his body was keeping him from being overly exalted but when he flipped that serpent into the fire all the heathen round about were taking note and says surely this is a wicked man though he survived amen the gods are going to slay him and when he didn't get sick when it didn't swell when nothing happened they changed their mind and they didn't think anymore the gods were punishing they thought he was a god and god used that to evangelize that island amen and then paul went over the same paul who left his buddy sick before the journey the same paul went over to the governor's house whose father was laying ill laid hands on him and he recovered and then they brought from far all that were sick that came to paul to be healed why why do these things happen i'd say quit asking why amen and just trust god with your life when you've surrendered your life to him let him do with it what he wants though it's high though it's low though it's comfortable uncomfortable quit doubting who you are amen we've got that's that issue has been settled we know what day we're in we know what age we're in we know what dispensation we're under and who has given us the ability to believe that and obey that it was him by faith amen long as the devil can get us to doubt who we are in question our sonship he can move us over here and move us over here and play games with us but that's not what god wants out of his bride he wants a bride that he has preeminence over not the devil one that he's in control of one that's moving by his word by his leadership and he's leading them in the word and one they'll go step by step by his spiritual leadership amen not be tossed here and tossed there amen because the devil said if you're a bride you're this and if you're a bride he wouldn't that and if you're a bride this wouldn't happen to you god doesn't need a bride who's always wondering if she's a bride or not he needs a bride who will take him at his word believe what he's told her and stand in confidence like the apostle paul apostle paul listen some historians believe that the apostle paul amen could not even walk standing erect anymore because of the severe beatings that he had on multiple occasions that he had the scars in his body of the beatings that he had stonings that he took outside the city and they left him for dead imprisonments and chains and the harshness and of the of travel on the roads in those days listen he wasn't getting in a train with air conditioning and plush seats going from city to city traveling from place to place in perils by the seas and perils in his countrymen and perils on the roads he had a difficult life amen and then after all of it they would begin to question his apostleship and letters and they would begin to ask him for proof of his apostleship the devil's trying to tempt him into proven and he says are not ye proof of my apostleship the fact that you're a church and you believe the gospel amen are you are you evidence of my apostleship i don't have anything to prove god proved it he was trying to get lured into those things but he didn't take debate praise god let's go back to matthew chapter 4. i pray that god is opening your heart this is the hour to overcome these things friends this is the hour for the bride to know who she is to have a proper identification in him and to stand fast in the word that god has given us this day matthew chapter 4 i'd like to pick up verse 8. and the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou will falt down and worship me then saith jesus unto him get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels come and ministered unto him in another passage of scriptures over i believe in luke it says and the devil departed from him for a season that wasn't the last of his tempting he says the devil now is trying to give the give the lord all the kingdoms of the earth it's a shortcut he knows that he was born the son of david that the kingdom will fall into his hands that he'll sit on the throne and but now he's trying to bring him to the throne but he's trying to bring him to the throne out of time and with no personal sacrifice out of god's time and with no sacrifice and without his brethren because if there's no price of redemption he'll become god over the earth but he won't have the seed that will only come when the price of redemption is paid he's trying to get him to bypass god's plan for his own personal glory and his own kingdom but he would have to have a kingdom without you and i yeah and he would have to have a kingdom without sacrifice without paying the price amen and that's not what he was interested in brother branham said things that are to be said jesus was taken by satan up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world that was would be what more and satan climbed them climbed them his and jesus never argued with him because he is the god of this world see and he said i'll give them to you if you'll fall down and worship me see he was trying to give them over to jesus without sacrifice see it was a bargain that he was going to make him and jesus wouldn't stand for it he said get behind me listen this is this is so often a temptation that we want the blessings of god without the sacrifice we want the position of bride without death but there's no position of bride without death you have to come low before you go high you must be a base you must become the sacrifice you must give your life willingly you must die if you ever hope to be exalted in the position of bride but so many times the devil's trying to tempt us say man to call ourselves to move ourselves into to move into something amen without first dying and we have to first die to self in order to be exalted to the position of bride and jesus was going to have to die to himself he was going to have to give himself as a sacrifice before he would ever inherit the kingdom because jesus just didn't want a position he wanted to fulfill the father's will and he didn't want a kingdom without you and i so he was willing to pay the price amen let's turn to matthew 16. i referred to this but i'd like to read it matthew 16. matthew 16 and verse 21. in matthew 16 you have that uh great question that jesus asked who do men say that i am peter gave the answer thou art christ the son of the living god he said blessed are thou simon barjona for flesh and blood never revealed this to you but my father which art in heaven has to reveal this to you and so then coming down further from there in verse 21 he said from that time forth began jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offense unto me for thou savers not the things that be of god but those that be of men now peter peter doesn't want the lord to be arrested and be crucified peter doesn't want the lord and you have to ask yourself why is peter taking the lord and rebuking him and you know jesus now is the word made manifest jesus was their master and lord and they just got the revelation that he was christ the son of the living god and that revelation had come from the father and we've got all of these things that have just happened and they knew who he was but now he begins to tell them what's going to happen and everything he told them happened they had trusted him they had left their fishing nets they had left everything to join themselves to christ and now christ tells them what's going to happen but what he tells them is not what they want to hear and when he tells them something they don't want to hear peter takes the lord and the language here is so interesting just listen he says peter took him where did he take him that's an interesting phrase and peter took him it began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee the way he's explaining this you get the imagery that he's like come here don't say that and let's look over at mark and the reason i believe this is over at mark 8 hold your place here but turn to mark chapter 8. mark chapter 8 and verse 31 mark 8 and 31 this is the same conversation and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again and he spake that saying openly jesus spake that saying openly like he was telling everybody and peter took him and began to rebuke him and when he turned about and looked on the disciple he rebuked peter saying get thee behind me satan for thou savers not the things that be of god but the things that be of man and so now you see there they're here and and it says he spake openly but peter took him and rebuked him this is interesting because it to me now i could be a million miles from right this is just brother chad but it's almost as if peter didn't want everybody else to hear that peter took him and begin to rebuke him and say lord be it far from thee that this will happen to you and almost like peter it almost was like peter was caring about jesus amen but jesus turned around and rebuked him and it was a devil that was speaking it was satan that was speaking through peter amen he said get thee behind me satan for thou savers not saviors not the things that be of god but the things that be of men and then all of a sudden you realize that peter was worried about peter it looked like peter was worried about the lord but peter was worried about peter because peter was one of those who believed jesus was going to the throne immediately he believed that the kingdom was beginning to get set up on the earth he believed that he was going to have a position and he was among the disciples that were arguing on who would be the greatest among them and he was a zealot amen and he was he was you know so much believe this amen that though jesus told him what would happen when when they came to take jesus he took out a sword and tried to kill a man he cut off his ear i don't think he was aiming for his ear he's either trying to split a skull or cut his head off but marcus could weave and zag somehow got his ear chopped off peter believed that that jesus was coming to his position now he believed the kingdom was coming now he believed that he was rising with jesus to power and authority now peter did not want jesus to suffer he did not want him to be evilly mistreated he didn't want and no doubt there was genuine affection and love between peter and the lord but but he was also desiring the things that be of man amen he wanted that position he wanted that glory he wanted to move into that kingdom he did not want to be chased from city to city and you know even peter's still hanging on to this wrong idea amen even in the last supper when jesus says you all forsake me he said though all men forsake you all not forsake you they all said why because he was wanting to come into the kingdom but immediately amen when jesus is arrested and now there's no hope and no strength and no ability amen immediately he becomes a coward and moves into the outer court where the trial is begins to slip over by a fire trying to conceal himself and when he's confronted by a damsel this is how brave this warrior is but he's confronted by a damsel and said are you not ye of galilee he said i am not weren't you with him i am not the third time and he began to swear why peter was interested in protecting peter but peter learned peter repented peter realized where he make a mistake and you don't see peter exalting himself after that peter began to suffer for the lord be imprisoned and be threatened and be persecuted his lord took the low way and peter took the low way peter will sit on the throne in fact he's on one now where the 24 elders are but the way up was down and it wasn't the way he thought peter so got with the program when they finally decided to crucify him he did not even want to be crucified the same way as lord because he was so low he wanted to be turned upside down see peter had taken the wrong idea peter was one of the exaltation he wanted he didn't want the suffering he didn't want the difficulty he didn't want the rejection he wanted the kingdom but if you want the kingdom you're going to have to take the rejection and the suffering and all the things that go with it people want to deny that there'll be any kind of suffering at all for the bride in the end time but brother branham said there'd be a squeeze a persecution and tightening up i said why would you want to deny that if that's what the prophet said what's the motivation if that's the way the lord chooses then that's good enough for me if god if god decides you know when the apostle paul was arrested it was after his arrest this is what i find so amazing it was after his arrest all the political leaders heard the gospel they now had to deal with paul and find out what's the deal i mean the church leaders knew what the problem was they were all you know there was a jewish strife going on in the jewish church and this sect and and all of a sudden and then it got so bad that the that the political leaders had to get involved and centurion comes down and they rescue paul and now all of these and from city to city to city now the religious fight is spilled out and now it becomes a political issue and now uh mayors and governors and magistrates have to what have to hear the gospel because paul has to explain why they're mad well they're mad because i believe jesus christ resurrected from the dead he was the promise of the fathers blah blah blah until until felix says you're mad don't tell the other king that comes i can't remember his name but the other king that comes he says paul you almost persuaded me to be a christian what was he doing he was testifying where nobody else could get into he was standing in halls and declaring the gospel where nobody else could declare it and i say if god wants to repeat that then he will if god wants it repeated then it will be repeated however he chooses i'm not going to determine how he does or why he does or when he does all i'm saying is my life is not mine it's his and i'm not identified by how good my life goes or how much blessings are put on me i've been identified by this word amen when the seals was opened there was my identification i found out who i was in the bride of jesus christ it's the word that has identified me now if things get better i'm still the son of god if things get worse i'm still the son of god i'm not going to let the devil push me here and push me there i've been given my identification there's been a prophet that come in this day and under the first seal he said i'm going to call you bride i'll no longer call you church i'll call you bride and my heart jumped and that's my title amen he may have spoken back in 1963 but he was speaking it to me what god did what he showed what he declared what he opened in the word was to give us our identity the headship has come down and united with the body the two are becoming one and whatever he chooses to do i'm not going to jump here jump there and jump there but i'm going to stick with this program say god you're gone let's turn to the book of job let's go to job chapter 2. brother brahma said in the message it is the rising of the sun we just finished listening to this and this was in this last section we did wednesday and it stood out to me in a special interest this statement i'll read it to you this way it's in a prayer and brother branham is imploring people to give their heart to the lord and he says dear god we're only going to be mortal once and what will it be if we let this opportunity pass us our hearts are burning our souls are thrilled these who have come in and many here are hearing this message this morning yes two or three hundred lifter lifted their hands they want to believe lord oh surely that seed is not dead lord how could they raise their hand like that there is something o god its old self he's talking about something that's hindering it's old self it's that wife of job standing there saying oh but the lord that let that let that job that believer walk in this morning die completely and be buried here in the baptism waters that statement struck me he said that's that old self the wife of job so i'm going to go back and look at job and his wife for just a minute in job chapter 2 verse 7. so so went satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote job was sore boils from the soul of his foot into his crown and he took him a posture to scrape himself with all and he sat down among the ashes then said his wife unto him dost thou still retain thine integrity cursed god and die but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh why shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips job knew who he was his identification wasn't in question his righteousness was never in question because it was attached to the lamb and here his wife comes in and brother said this old self the wife of job and you look at the wife of job she comes down and she looks at the circumstances she looks at the loss of the children and she looks at the loss of all the all the donkeys and the camels and the all the wealth and all the goods and all the prestige and and the house and she looks at the loss of everything and she's carnal and she's looking with natural eyes and she's looking all around and says why do you hold your integrity why are you still confessing just curse god and die he said you speak as one of the foolish she didn't say she was a foolish one he said you speak as one of the foolish women who don't know god he said shall we receive good at god's hand and not evil can god not do both with his children can god not allow suffering and bring blessings is only the blessings from god but when he allows the sufferings is it not allowed by god was god involved here but not involved here was god in control over here but he wasn't in control over here see that old self looks at all the conditions and all the suffering and doesn't want it the wife of job but job was the real believer he said blessed be the name of the lord let's look back at chapter 1 chapter 1 verse 20. job 1 and 20. then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped he said naked came i out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return thither the lord gave and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord and all this job sinned not nor charged god foolishly he said lord help me in my hour of temptation help me to keep my testimony pure help me to believe in you and believe what you've told me and never let my faith waver brother rem said and just one more time said are you willing to die that's what the trouble of it you want to stay alive to hollywood the same time be alive with god it won't mix a seed jesus said except the corner wheat fall on the ground and die it abides alone you'll never bring forth anything oh jesus named church what a glorious church what a glorious name jesus name are you ready to die are you assemblies of god general assembly are you ready to die method is baptist presbyterian are you ready to die out to your enemy are you willing to pay the price of sacrifice really sincerely not just come and say well i'll give it a try and see how i come out you're not ready yet you must be ready to pay the price and die the devil satan tried to offer jesus all the kingdoms of the world without death but jesus was willing to pay the price he tries to come and offer us so many ideas and so many thoughts and so many positions without death amen but we're not going to take it without death i'm going to die to myself and let god make whatever he wants out of me for it's his word i'm not going to take the temptation amen i'd like to finish up with a story from brother bannon if i could just read this we've read it many many times so we know it so i'll skim through parts of it but out of the message standing in the gap i want to read about one of brother branham's temptations we saw eaves we saw jesus christ in the wilderness i want to look at the prophet of god in an hour of temptation and standing in the gap he said he told me that coming down after a trip and in my mind i made up my mind that i was going to go up to buds up in british columbia because he's in bad shape up there as a hunter before leaving i might drop this in and we'll hurry i dreamed a funny dream brother branham had been up to up to canada and he was actually driving back from canada and he said i dreamed a funny dream and this is before he left an odd dream and i hope when my brother-in-law gets a hold of this it doesn't hurt his feelings and i hope it don't hurt my wife who's sitting present now but she knows that about a month ago right on well it was around about october and november i dreamed that i was roaming out in the dark well i had no place to go and nobody cared for me and i had become a bum just a bum and i was cold and i looked in the distance and i saw fire and when i got over there it was a city dump and there had ditches and the fire was in the ditches and between the ditches was slick where bums could sleep there to keep warm keep from freezing between the fires on a cold winter night and i was cold and i walked up to this fire to get warm and it was laying full of bums and there i didn't see any of them but they all like had stalls or places where their sleeping place was and i saw my brother-in-law fletcher broy going down further he says and when i awoke before i woke up fletch said to me he said in the dream he said billy i'll hunt you a place brother bill you fed my children when they were hungry he said you was a daddy to them now i'll find you a place here to keep warm and we went walking by the bum's place and finally come to a place he said i'll sit down here i said i'll walk up here and see if i can find a place i walked up and i looked out in the dark cold night and i thought think of it one time god almighty let me lead his church one time he let me preach his gospel and see souls saved men and women come from around the world to speak with me for a few minutes and here i am now a bum and nobody wants me and i'm cold what must i do then i woke up i told my wife i said maybe it means that fletch is in need so we hurried up to see if we could find him and his brother found him he was staying out where the wideners are out there they have trade horses and things sleep in a corner of a barn or something i went on i thought well just have to let it go so i came back down from canada with fred and them the other day and in my mind i had it made up if these people didn't want to hear my message all right they didn't have to do you think this was his hour of temptation where did that thought come from did that come come from the father or was this the tempter i had preached now for about 35 years in the last 15 to 18 years i've done nothing but just to the lord i've tried to live so close to him and not say a word until he told me first everything people say now if brother brahm tells you he's coming remember look out for the meeting because he's coming in the name of the lord he won't do nothing to the lord tell that's right i waited till he told me i didn't move till he told me and then he got so for the last few months he didn't tell me nothing about places to go then i come down from canada and fred or brother rory told me his dream as he and i and brother banks rode along together just before we separated and then the next day we got down to brother fred's and his boy lynn wasn't at home so he couldn't come on with us him and his wife had to wait he picked up his wife there at rosewood saskatchewan and billy and i came in brother fred's truck that night we traveled most of night and the next day and then on the next morning we had left helena montana and was coming on towards the border and i can stay up till about nine o'clock and get sleepy i gotta sleep and billy he wants to sleep till about 10 o'clock the next day when the daylight comes up so it makes it pretty good for us to travel so i got up about four o'clock and got started driving and billy was sleeping we went into a place and was thinking on my mind you know what one of these days as soon as i can get the wife up there i won't tell her what i'm going to do but i'd get up there and then i'm going to tell her i love this place so well no need of us going anywhere else let's just stay here and that's back from civilization 1100 miles from anywhere wouldn't that be great way in the wilderness i thought won't that be fine i won't have to get a haircut listen brother branham was a real man elijah was a man of like passions as we he had temptations just like you have temptations he had wrong thoughts and wrong ideas and selfishness that would creep in that's what this is selfishness that's coming from pain pain of rejection and now he is he he's going through the same thing you and i go through and i'm so thankful that god had him tell this and standing in the gap so that i could identify my hour of temptation say that where am i at no haircut where is this yeah i won't have to get a haircut i won't have to dress up and i'll just be a regular mountaineer i know some boys little boys in this church would be like yes i've got a quote but let me finish reading i'll be a regular mountaineer what i always listen what i always wanted to be what i i i lucifer i will i will i will listen this is when spiritual discernment comes in when you start saying i i i that's time to put the brakes on and say god where are you you you what do you want where do you want me to go how do you want me to react i want i need i feel i think i would say put the emergency brake on there's something wrong here there's too much i where are you at god and this where do you want me to be what i always wanted to be i said i got some guns and some people give me and i'll be a guide like you never heard of i'll just love it then if the lord tells me go down and tell somebody something i'll run out and tell them and come back again and i'll help bud and we'll really have a real place here i was thinking on that we went into a restaurant to eat a little place in the mountain just about seven o'clock it was getting a little late so i woke billy up we was out of gasoline so i had to get some gasoline i i love this friends brother branham is not he's not at the altar at the church praying for 10 hours when god starts to speak to him he's driving down the road and he realized i got to get some gasoline and where he's going to need gasoline is where god is going to show him something in a diner don't think the footsteps of the righteous are not ordered to the lord god does the same thing for you and i if we'll just wake up and pay attention i had to get some gasoline and went to this little place this little restaurant and while there a man come across the street maybe teeny bit older than i was but he looked like a man to me he had on a pair of overalls overall jacket riding boots a black hat whiskers down his face like this snow white his hair hanging out from under back of his hat i thought that looks like a man not some soft lazy with a cigar in his mouth about that long sitting with a pair of shorts around some patio or swimming pool some pot bellied easterner like excuse that expression excuse that expression but however the guy looked like a man to me hard rough looked like he lived where god made men to live and i was admiring him see this is an hour of temptation this is the temptation in the wilderness brother branham is being tempted and he's been he's being drawn away of his own lusts can we see it if we can see it in him can we see it in us this is the whole point that we finally get to where i can say i can see that in me amen i've saw me all down through my past every mistake i can see this same scenario he's getting me to doubt my sonship trying to prove something trying to get ahead of god's schedule trying to save myself trying to deliver myself trying to have my own way brother man was admiring him listen the devil knows how to tempt us he didn't tempt him with something he didn't want now he's now in the hour of pressure when the pressure is building on the prophet and the prophet is now depressed amen and he's struggling with the rejection after the opening of the seals when when they rejected the opening of the word now when he's struggling with that he doesn't tempt him to go to the casino and gamble he's tempting him to go be alone with god in the woods see the temptation for you many times now if you serve the lord for a period of time god is not the devil's not trying to tempt you into vulgar sin he's just trying to tempt you to put yourself first and step back from god's program the temptation is to pull you away from a life of sacrifice and a life of surrender and to self-preservation and he always comes with a religious with a religious tone go out in the wilderness and be with god and get away from civilization and be alone with god as god's prophet when he tells me something else come out of the woods and i'll tell him and i'll go back to the woods oh boy it sounded good it sounded religious but it was not god's plan amen he come into the restaurant and ordered some pancakes there was about 15 20 people he had to he had to sneeze and you know how some people will and brother bryan it says injected here he imitates a little sneeze i should just play it for you he said pardon me but he let out a great big healthy wood sneeze kertuey maya it looked like the windows blasted when he did nobody dared to say nothing no sir i said billy there is a man after my own heart you know we laugh now but this was really happening to the prophet he was really entertaining these thoughts he was really struggling with his position he was struggling with the rejection and he was struggling with the pressure the tension the rejection the depression and he was looking for a way out and in looking for a way out his mind amen the devil was planting seeds and the seeds didn't sound bad because the seeds lined up to what the desire of his heart was he always wanted to be a wilderness man a mountain man be in the woods be a trapper be a hunter and be a guide go way up away from civilization brother branham wasn't looking at running away amen and becoming a heathen and becoming a sinner he was thinking he was thinking going up there and talking to god and meditating and being away and focusing on the lord but he was doing it for himself not for god and if we really could hone down our discernment and say how much of what i do do i do for myself and how much of what i do do i do for god i mean then we're really getting into dialing in the the discernment amen and i i'm praying god will help me to recognize this because i recognize it in myself too late too many times that i did that with selfish motives i did that for myself i did that for my own protection i did that for the for how it would look in the eyes of somebody else i did it for how it would sound amen but i don't want to be motivated by that i want to do what god wants me to do for him i want to live a life for him that's what i really want amen and i'm praying that god gives us the discernment amen to recognize that old tempter when he's coming in because he doesn't use you know a snake-like voice and a deep booming evil devil voice he uses your voice when he whispers in your ear and it feels like your thought but it's his thought because it's contrary to the will and plan of going i said billy there's a man after my own heart said oh daddy you don't want to be like that that's that's what that's me in the future see i said that's me this is the hour of temptation that's me that's what i want to be that's what i'm going to do he was in the process of making up his mind he had saw what he wanted and he declared that's me there you go billy that's a man after my own heart he said oh daddy you don't want to be like that he said no that's me in the future that's me did he want it yes he wanted it he was being enticed of his own lusts i sat there a little bit and billy looked up at me and kept on eating his pancake i was finishing mine i was finished mine and a few minutes somebody in a booth right around front of us with the boards this way back of the booth i couldn't see around a man got up that looked exactly my profile about 75 years old little bitty fellow his clothes tied on him ragged and the buddy that got up with him was fletcher broy exactly gray hair hanging in his face and billy looked around he said daddy that looks like you and fletcher you can imagine how i felt and the little fella looked like me wobbled up you know they had been standing over a campfire with smoke all over them faces dirty i think their breakfast together the man must have paid 20 cents maybe a cup of coffee or something my heart bounced within me and i watched and billy said what's the matter with you i said nothing and i watched that and they went around and went out he said daddy what's the matter i said nothing and he got in the car he said he said do you mind driving again i said nope he said i'm still sleepy so he went to sleep and i went speeding down the road about 55 miles an hour in the truck over the mountain coming on towards the border down to coming home to arizona but i was coming now into utah and as i got there coming down from the mountains about 20 miles out of the city you heard it as as i told you about the morning about the squirrels and all those things how somebody went to talking to me a voice just the same as you hear mine i know it sounds neurotically but as i've got through expressing have i ever told you anything but what was right and a voice got to talking i was talking to him it said carry out your plans and you'll be like that i said lord i don't want to be like that said your wife will go too she won't live up there in them hills like that and you'll become a bum just as the dream showed you you would be i said i don't want to be that but i i don't want to have to live like that now when brother man says this i don't want to have to live like that he's talking about the way he's living as a minister and a prophet and traveling around and all the rejection he said but i don't want to have to live like that i want to do something different i was told that you had called me to be a prophet i want to live in the wilderness like the prophet but i was using my own excuse so i could hunt my own good oh friends when deception when when self-willed deception starts to creep in and the minute it takes on religious tone that is the worst deception of all prophet of god is struggling he doesn't have wrong desire he doesn't want to do evil he doesn't want to do wrong he doesn't want to displease the lord but under the pressure he's under amen and under all the things that he's suffering with he he has this little idea and the devil's planting a seed and making a plan you could run up to the wilderness you could be the mountain man you always want to be you could take your family up there look think of the peace and just talk to god and when god says something you can storm out and god begins to talk to him and tell him you'll be just like those bums if you carry out your plan he said but lord i don't want to live like this i want to you told me that i was a prophet i want to live in the mountains like the prophets did but here he gets honest but i was using my own excuse and it was religious it matched certain characteristics of prophets in the bible you understand just because you've got a scripture to justify what you're doing doesn't mean you're right just because you can find a quote to match what you want to do doesn't mean it's right it's right because it's right do you give what i'm saying not because you wanted a certain thing and you searched to tell you could find something that would allow you to do what you already wanted to do no it's right because it's right by god because it's god's plan for you because it's god what god wants you to do that's when it's right amen but when we take the word in a religious way and religious tones and religious explanations and begin to justify our own desires friends we're going to end and ruin that's not what god wants for us he wants preeminence he doesn't want us to take the word and twist it so we can have our own pleasure or protect ourselves from what he has ordained brother branham wanted to protect himself from rejection but god didn't want him protected from rejection he had to be rejected because christ is always rejected he couldn't protect paul from the stoning could have protected him from arrest he could have delivered him from prison he did before he did in one city but he didn't in another man we've got to get to the place where it's got to be god and only god i said god that's where i want to be help me lord but i was using my own excuse so i could hunt my own good and he said but that was the prophets of the old testament you've been called to be there in a much higher office than that he said you have more gifts besides that you was called to pray for the sick and preach the gospel in the apostolic form you know of greater things many great gifts he said why do you wait for me to move you every time you move where's your reward when i then i seen and then said do you remember i told you do you remember what brother roberson told you in your dream in his dream or vision that you had done like moses you forgot the feeling of your people you forgot the call that i called you to i let the sick lay i want the lord to tell me where to go and not to go that's wrong i had built myself a complex i love the way he says that i had built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message if you say i have a complex i want to ask you did you build yourself a complex because you can have a complex if you want one the devil will hand you the bricks and you can keep setting them in place nobody loves you they reject you nobody understands you or you can take the brick and say that's not true brother branham built himself a complex because the people didn't hear his message amen and so don't build yourself a complex they didn't shake my hand they don't love me everybody else gets together i don't get together on sunday don't build yourself a complex you say whatever god wants for my life is what i want from my life if he wants me rejected forgotten overlooked and he's my god whatever he wants is what i want don't build yourself a complex friends i built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message and god forbid that i'll try to compare the life of my life now like moses but it's exactly what moses did the people wouldn't listen to him when he come to deliver him so he just left them alone and went into the wilderness but god turned him around and he had long forgotten the suffering people brother branham confessed that he had done the same thing i let the sick lay and i had gifted healing to take to the world and i was pulling back because i had been rejected and they didn't hear the message and i let sick people lay and withheld the gift from people and he was told that he was wrong and he said god forgive me but guess what god turned moses and god turned this prophet he took his correction he repented amen he stood up and he told the church amen and he repented of it and he prayed and he got back the feeling for the people when he went back to the field i say praise god for his correction we have to have discernment in this hour jeremiah let's turn to jeremiah i want to read two more scriptures as we close jeremiah 17 and 9. jeremiah 17 9 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it your heart will deceive you brother branham wanted he desired to be a mountain man and go to the mountain be a prophet alone with god and stomp out with the message deliver and go back he wanted but when he got real honest with himself what he really wanted was an excuse to go off and hunt and have his own way the heart is deceitfully desperately wicked it's deceitful above all things desperately wicked who can know it brother branham further down and standing in the gap he comes back and he says but the call of god must come whoever wants to march towards the promised land let him march we are on our road to prom the promised land amen let them come march we're on our road to meet christ at the end time and i wanted to bring this to you so that you could see and show you the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere brother branham wasn't being insincere he didn't want to stop serving god he didn't want to stop his commission and being a prophet he didn't he didn't want to turn his back on the lord he was being sincere amen but but he was enticed of his own lust and it was beginning to lead him away and brother graham said i wanted to bring this to you so that you would see and show you that the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere you can be sincere still want to serve the lord but you want to do it your own way amen and i say god bring me back to your way for the last scripture let's read psalm 139. psalm 139 and verse 23 and 24. search me o god and know my heart we just read that the heart is deceitfully wicked it's deceitful above all and desperately wicked who can know it but here david says search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting what a prayer after i read this now i used to read this differently but when i read it now i used to read it like david was saying search me i'm perfect see i'm fine but now i don't know if that was david was saying because look how david fell with bathsheba his heart wasn't right he was being selfish as lust he was enticed of his own lust and led away until he could commit murder let's read it again search me o god and know my heart because sometimes i can't even know my own heart i'm sincere but the devil is using my my my own the pressures around me and my own feelings and my own desires he's using them and twisting them against your will oh god but i'm sincere and i love you and i want to do right search me oh god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting i said that would be a good prayer to end on say lord search me try my thoughts see if there's any wicked way in me lord and lead me in the way everlasting pray friends for discernment we'll look at the devil's tactics and watch how he comes it's it's got to be deceitful to deceive the bride it's got to look good
