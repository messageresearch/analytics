start off this morning and speak a little bit about the election and what we're seeing in the nation i know there's a lot of quotes flying around and a lot of things going on and i thought would just be good to re read the quotes together amen and then watch and see what god's doing i'd like to read here in daniel chapter 4 daniel chapter 4 together daniel chapter 4 and verse 31. while the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from heaven saying o king nebuchadnezzar to thee it has spoken the kingdom has departed from thee and they shall drive thee from men and they in thy dwelling shall be with the beast of the field they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will god's in charge and i'm thankful for that amen let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this day for your wisdom lord for your word god we thank you for the gift of love that you've given to us by sending a prophet revealing your word and giving a word lord and i pray god as we look at that you give us wisdom lord as we move forward in this life lord as we as we look into the scriptures lord for the life that we're to live i pray that you would open it to us lord that we might see it the way you intended for it to be seen we love your god we ask your blessing over everything we say or do may you have preeminence and may we be pleasing to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all have your seeds i just want to read some quotes and make a few comments but it's not really what i want to preach about i have another subject that i want to preach on so hopefully this only take a couple of minutes let's turn to second chronicles read another scripture in second chronicles second chronicles chapter 20. and i'd like to read verse 6 second chronicles 20 and 6 and said o lord god of our fathers are not thou got in heaven and rule us not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thy hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee and so we realize that god's the one who's ruling over all the kingdoms and god's the one who gives us kingdoms and take it away he rises kings and he puts kings down so god's in control so if god's in control there's nothing to worry about nothing to fret about and there's also i would say this there's nothing for us to figure out god's already figured it out amen and i just want to talk about this for a minute in context of some things brother branham said because i find it fascinating and very interesting and by the way if i cough a little bit don't worry about me because i have an allergy cough and it doesn't bother me and i hope it doesn't bother you amen this is one of those areas that i battle with and i fight the devil and i believe i'm going to gain victory by the blood of jesus christ but i'm going to fight the good fight and preach anyways so you just pull anyhow don't feel sorry for me just pool it works and then one thing i want to say about the election is uh you know you all know i'm sure you know by now that most the news agencies has declared biden to be the the victor and it's not a it's not official yet it's not been certified i guess it's the official term and so there's it's contested we know all of those things always a big fight always a big show amen and i'm not interested in the show i'm tuned to another channel and i'm interested in what we're reading in the word of god amen so i'm tuned out of that channel but interesting it's quite interesting but but there's a lot of quotes going around and i thought we'd just read those together because i find them fascinating and everything god does everything that happens god does for a reason and we we cannot make american politics insignificant though we can't get caught up in it we've got to be careful we don't get caught up in it because we know that america shows up in revelation chapter 13 as the beast that rose out of the earth and it's significant in end time prophecy so what happens here has significance as significance globally has significance with end time prophecies and it's america who's going to turn the world back to the beast so so we know that these things are happening with significance everything happens with significance the danger for us is get calling get caught up into politics because brother branham said politics is the devil he said i'm neither republican or democrat they're all crooked and so i was reading excuse me i was reading a quote one time my brother venom said you know there's three great isms in the world nazism communism fascism and he says they're spirits he said they're spirits and he said and they get on you they're spirits that they can get on you and we know that methodism is a spirit pentecostalism the spirit there's spirits to get on you but i'd also say this and i say this i hope you forgive me for saying it i'm your brother but patriotism is a spirit that can get on you conservatism is a spirit that can get on you liberalism is the spirit everybody says amen liberalism is a spirit amen liberalism is a spirit that can get on you but then i'll say conservatism they're against abortion and you know right you see the devil's using it all he's playing this game and it's not for us to get caught up in those arenas amen and get it's just a distraction it's just a distraction to take us from what we're supposed to be focused on and get our focus in and and and to the thing that's all corrupt but the member said it's all corrupt politics is all corrupt why focus on it's all corrupt and when they do something corrupt it shocks you why are you shocked the prophet said it's corrupt there's nothing shocking about corruption there's nothing shocking about about any of the things that we see amen as an american you can be shocking be disappointed discouraged but as a christian who believes the message this shouldn't be shocking it shouldn't even be discouraging because god is in control so the one thing i want to do as we move forward like i said there's quotes that are fascinating interesting i'm interested i'm watching with great interest my intention is peaked amen because of some things that that transpired um but i want to be cautious and say let god interpret his word by bringing it to pass because you know i feel like in the past i have done damage to my testimony by getting ahead of god and presuming and speculating and my speculation and presuming i'll start off saying well this is just me speculation and presuming and i'll speculate and presume time convinced of my own speculation and presumption and then i start to claim it as fact and then you know and then all of a sudden i just disappoint and discourage myself and others that around me and i don't want to do that this time amen i don't want to do that with any of the word i just want to be simple-minded i want to be a simple believer to take god's word believe it hold on to it let god bring it to pass the way he chooses to bring it to pass and i just want to watch what he's doing and fight this urge there's an urge excuse me there's an urgent all christian and maybe it's just a human nature thing there's this urge always to be the first one who knew or the first one who figured it out i mean you'll start hearing terms that you didn't hear a week ago you'll start hearing things like oh i knew i had a feeling i thought it was going to be mine i thought it was going to be this i thought it was going to be that why didn't you say anything two weeks ago i mean i'm not discounting that maybe you had that feeling maybe you had that thought but you realize the point is there's something in human nature a man wants to know and he wants to prove that he knows he wants to be the first to know and he wants to know the most and i say forget all of that just be simple humble farmer shepherd let god do what god's going to do and then recognize what he's doing as he does it god interprets his word by bringing it to pass amen he brings it to past and he shows you what he did right and so let's just let's just remain humble and just observe just say hey this is what the prophet said and i and i and i say let's focus on what the prophet said let's take those quotes and hold them and let's watch and say wow this is interesting in light of what the prophet said but don't say well if this then that and this means this and then that oh that's where we're going to get in trouble friends i say just be humble be a humble know nothing nobody amen ignorant to the ways of the world and the eyes of the world an ignorant nobody no nothing because that's the ones he's looking for that he wants to use not the ones who's constantly getting ahead and saying well then this and then that and this will happen and that and then it doesn't happen i mean don't discourage our children in the message by talking this way at home well this is gonna that's gonna happen and your children are watching they're not dumb and when everything he says is going to happen doesn't happen we just proved one thing you're not brother branham so i mean maybe that's a good lesson for the kid but i say that as a caution so we have the right mental attitude the right approach the right just be simple just be humble don't be the first one off the line the first one to jump on sunday the first one that figured it out i don't care if i'm the last one that figured it out as long as i caught the true revelation of the lord and recognized the genuine word of god i don't have to be the first i don't have to be in the front running i don't have to i don't have to be the expert on these things hey i could be last as long as i gets the true revelation of the true word can identify and identify myself with it then i thank god for that because that's by his grace so there's a couple quotes that i want to go through and anytime something like this happens it's funny there'll be quotes flying all over the internet facebook and watch out and you'll get them text to you and all of this stuff and it's just it's just interesting to me i don't know it's just interesting and so i've never felt the need to share a quote you know in the in the light of 50 other people doing it at the same time let them do it they're already sharing it why would i send it out it's making its rounds everybody's going to get it but anyways in the message the door inside the door in 1960 and the quotes i'm going to start reading are from i think all of them are going to be from 1960. and this one's in july of 1960 and in july of 1960 there's there's a presidential race on for an election that's going to be in that november and that election is going to be between richard nixon and john f kennedy so here brother branham is in july before that and this is the statement that he makes he's in prayer he's praying out of service he's saying now we thank thee for the holy spirit that gives us comfort in this hour and we pray father that he will abide with us forever as the shadows are lengthening out and we know the sun is setting on civilization god we would pray now for this great nation of ours that's in the time of the changing of presidents it might seem like a light thing but god it might change the destination of this nation oh lord thou who would choose the prophets and anoint the kings we pray that your holy spirit would anoint the right man for us in this hour granted lord where the great rallies are going on on both parties father we realize that you're not interested in parties it's man that you can trust so i pray father that somewhere along that they'll choose the right man for the hour we know that the hour has to come when the wrong man will be chosen too so we pray father that you'll give us a little more time to bring in the lost may if there be any of those here tonight seeing the shadows lengthening out may they come sweetly to the lord jesus and be saved heal the sick and afflicted strengthen the church for we ask it in jesus name amen so brother baby's praying and he's asking he said lord would you have them pick the right man because we know there's coming a day that they'll choose the wrong man and that was brother branham's prayer he's at a meeting in oregon and the message doors and doors he's praying that and he says would you choose the right man we know that they'll choose the wrong amen and he says in god's and brother ben's motive is that we'll have more time to save the lost but a couple months later in this election brother venom comes back later says they chose the wrong man he says exactly he chose the wrong man and you think but even brother branham as a man as a citizen of the united states uh as a minister in these meetings uh he's praying for for the nation he's praying for the direction of the nation he's praying that they'll choose the right man but he says we know that one day they'll choose the wrong man but he's asking god to choose the right man and he comes right back and says they chose the wrong man and you see god has a purpose and a plan and a timing and an appointed person and a point of time and he'll do it regardless brother man was asking for the right man and brother ben said they chose the wrong man but god still answered his prayer because he gave us more time to save the lost right how long has the goal has that been that brother brandon prayed that prayer from 1960 to now it's been 60 years and god is merciful and that he's given us more time to save the lost because that was brother bennett's motivation behind the prayer and god answered that prayer and still allowed his prophecy to move forward according to his perfect time and allowed the wrong man to get elected so praise be to god no matter no matter what ideas we get or what things we conjure up in our mind god already has a plan and god's gonna work his plan again in september he says september the same year 1960 five definite identifications of the true church of the living god he says but did you notice in revelation 13 when the united states come up is the only beast in the bible that come up that did not come out of the waters the bible said it come up out of the earth where there was no peoples that was the new kingdom and it looked like a lamb but after a while it spake like the dragon that's this country it's got to happen someday they'll make a mistake and elect the wrong guy they'll raise up a pharaoh that doesn't know joseph they tried it before and they'll do it again if they fail in this time brother was talking about the current election that was going on between kennedy and nixon he said they tried it before and they'll do it again if they fail this time so they were trying to raise up a pharaoh that knew not joseph it's finally come the bible said so and i'm not a politician both sides of them are crooked amen can you say amen all righty both sides of them are crooked i'm casting my vote on jesus christ he's the only one i'm interested in but i tell you you'd better wipe your glasses off now if you expect any freedom for your children i don't know how close it is pray all right oh that was an interesting statement too brother benham he knew what this meant you know he knew what was happening in the message conference this is uh november 25th this would be after the election november 25th he says we now have a president now he's now he's going back in prophecy he's going to talk about roosevelt now he's talking about the vision that he had in 1933 of the seven things that had to happen we now have a president and he's referring back then and this mr roosevelt will cause the world to go into the world war through his time of his administration as president and then said and during this time they have permitted women to vote which will be a curse to the nation they'll elect the wrong man sometime and they did the other day so brother branham before the election was praying god and get the right let them choose the right man we know sometimes they'll choose the wrong man let him choose the right man that we have more time to save the laws he comes right after the election and he said they allowed the women to vote which would be a curse for this nation and if brother ben said it's true it doesn't matter what feministic ideas we pick up out of laodicea it's still true [Music] he said it'd be a curse to this nation they'll finally elect the wrong man and they did he said they did so this is the pharaoh who knew not joseph this is the wrong man that brother ben was talking about now i want you to be careful and understand that brother bannon is not saying he's the wrong man for prophecy he said he's the wrong man for the nation he's not the wrong man in god like god made a mistake oh god you put the wrong man in brother branham is clear i'll read it another quote he's the wrong man for the nation he's not the wrong man for prophecy he was the right man for prophecy all right he says in when he's preaching the ephesian church age in december of 1960 he says now it said there at that time there'd be a great woman stand up in the united states and she was dressed and beautiful but she was cruel and hard and i got in parentheses on this vision even yellow paper said perhaps the catholic church and the woman being permitted the women being permitted to vote would help elect the wrong person for this nation and that's what they've done exactly now said that would be the beginning so all the way back there when the women were allowed to vote they vote the wrong man and that would be the beginning that would be the beginning of something the beginning of a cycle at the beginning of something setting in the beginning of an end time prophecy moving forward that brother branham prophesied about this that would be the beginning so we look back that was the beginning now he's preaching just the next week in the later scene church age he says but they'll be a powerful woman now remember this is on tape too a powerful woman great woman she'll either be president or it'll be a woman representing the catholic church which i think it is will take over here someday and she'll rule this country now excuse me what brother branham was seeing and he states it emphatically here in a little bit i'll read it just in a minute but brother branham is stating that he believes that the election of john f kennedy as the first catholic president was an open door for the catholic church to begin to move in and take over the country and and he was exactly right he said that'll be the opening that they need and they'll fill the cabinet with positions of of those who are catholic and we realize now that our supreme court is the majority catholics uh congress as uh catholics every office every position in the high higher parts of the land the higher offices are catholic and brother ben said the ushering in was the electing of kennedy as president and so we realized brother bam knows what he's talking about he's right it needs to be the catholic church that comes in amen and and he's correct and he states that like i said emphatically here shortly so i want to keep that straight in her mind here's a quote that i found to be very very interesting this goes all the way back to july of 1960 before the election said everything is a woman and remember thus saith the lord there will be a woman ruled before the end time she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the catholic church as a woman i've seen her this is the one that's making its rounds on the internet because it says vice president and i don't think wrongfully so i don't think it's wrong to look at this this is what the prophet said so i don't think you're wrong in drawing attention to this or focusing on it but so i don't i don't mean that in any disregard ever i think it's fascinating she'll either be president vice president or it be the catholic church as a woman i've seen her a great woman the nation bowed to her it'll be one before the end time thus saith the lord write it down and find out you young people see if it happens if it isn't i'm a false prophet then i want to read from the message once more from 1963 right at the end of 1963 and november 17 he he has this statement he said in 1933 the holy spirit came one morning and told me seven things that would take place before this nation was destroyed one of them is that it's it's on on old paper here at the church many has looked at it how they will go to war with hitler how germany would fortify and build imagine online or the siegfried line i believe it was 11 years before it was ever thought of and how that automobiles would constantly shape like eggs and how that they would permit women to vote and in doing so they would elect the wrong president and then this would be a woman's and in this would be a woman stand up that would govern the united states not actually a woman but a church then i seen her with nothing but ashes it's going to happen so brother branham is emphatic that that he he believes he saw this woman rising the power and he believes it's the catholic church he said not a woman but a church and so i don't ever want to forget that don't ever forget what the brother brother emphasized and what brother brahms stated it was and what brother brahm declared him himself to believe it was what he saw happening and what we've seen happen since and so now if we want to know that great woman that's rising the power in the united states i can say it's the catholic church praise god and i don't want to throw away what brother venom said or what he thought i want to hold it with great value because we've seen that he saw it he declared it we see it but i'm not done reading this is what i think is interesting this is why i just want to watch these things i just want to watch them i don't want to make predictions and i don't want to i don't want to fill in any blanks if there's a blank i'm content to leave it blank if i don't know i'm comfortable saying i don't know but he says in the laodicean church age out of the church age book now remember the church age book was edited you know in 1963-64 and it came out towards the end of 1965 so brother branham had an opportunity to carefully read over what was in the church age book edit it make corrections and put it in print and he even was doing that after the seals so that's why i really like the church age book but he says here it says then in the sixth vision there rose up in america most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power i believe that this was the rise of the roman catholic church though i knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in america due to a popular vote by women but i think that's interesting he said i believe it was the catholic church but i knew that it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in america due to a popular vote by women so brother in the church age book he's not ruling out the possibility and so when you read this sometimes you just you wonder brother ben said it was the catholic church we know it's the catholic church we know it's the church it's the spiritual church it's that spiritual anointing that has to rise up and take power because they're going to point back amen to the catholic church it's going to be a tie-in for the nation back we know that but also we know that prophecy has natural and spiritual types and multiple fulfillments and all of that so the question is will god also raise a woman into power as a natural type of what's happened spiritually i say i don't know is it possible yes a scripture worked that way before in the past absolutely i won't rule it out i won't say this is this and this is that and this is that and that or not this or not that i'll just say i'm watching this interesting because i'm very interested in this another thing that he says two paragraphs later and out of the church age book he said the catholic church is on the rise we have had one catholic president and will no doubt have another that's an interesting statement because from the time of kennedy on we never had another catholic president and brother ben made the statement he says we've had one and no doubt we'll have another but we haven't had another unless joe biden is confirmed as president he'll be the second catholic president we've had the first was john f kennedy and so i i thought i thought this is so interesting because we've watched over the last several years so many things that are happening uh happening in society happening in politics happening around the world it's it's almost like a repeat of the 60s it's almost like the end of brother bannon's ministry what he was watching going in america and go around the world and social unrest and and uh uh uh he was watching this social unrest he was watching the movement of the homosexual movement coming in the uh he was watching marriages divorces and remarriage take run rampant in america he was watching immorality spread to america drug abuse rebellion he was looking at riots in the street political corruption right all of this was happening at the end of the prophet's ministry starts declaring it declaring it declaring it and in in so many ways it feels like this last handful of years we've repeated the cycle even brother branham i mean just as is as simple as this that brother branham would say marilyn monroe he saw her die and he says you know they're going to say she committed suicide but it wasn't suicide and i think it was four or five years ago there was a magazine a magazine that came out and the cover of the magazine was a picture of marilyn monroe and the word says it was not suicide why did that come out now what's this thing given down who's left in america that cares i don't mean that to be mean but but it's in every magazine rack and every walmart and every grocery store there's a picture of marilyn monroe and the great bold words it was not suicide just to get our attention friends to recognize amen that there's a repeat in the cycle he says they'll say it was but you say it was not suicide amen so we've been saying it's not suicide and now there's a magazine that comes out and says this wasn't suicide and it's a trivial thing that's not a big deal but it's another confirmation so i think it's i think it's fascinating so we remember one catholic president the catholic president came in brother brennam said listen this is the prophet of god he said he came in by the vote of women they voted in the wrong one and by crooked voting machines hey crap he said the fbi proved it this is what brother branham said crooked voting machines the fbi approved it and why won't they do anything about it because those people don't want to lose their jobs he said something like that and i thought of all the allegations we're hearing and all this stuff and then i was like it's surreal pinch yourself it's like it's almost like the bride is walking right through some of these same scenarios and god's pointing some of these things just to get our attention to see and i'm not saying this is this and this is that drawing i'm not i'm just saying this is interesting it's like a little flag waving say look over here look over here and i tell you my friends i'm looking i'm interested i'm watching i think it's amazing i think it's amazing that if this confirmation goes through if if this vote is certified it goes through we know it'll have legal contesting and all this and you know and it's there's a possibility that trump will pull a rabbit out of the hat and he'll remain president i don't know what's going to happen i have no idea but god's allowed this to happen so far would you agree what's happened has happened so far to get our attention what happened next i don't know so i'm not going to say because if it was one where the other then i'm going to have to come back and say i'm sorry i was wrong that was just me that wasn't the lord will you pray for me and i i'm tired of doing that friends i just i'm getting burnt out on all that so let's not pollute the prophecy with our own thinking let's not corrupt the words of a prophet with our own interjections just let him say what he said and watch what happens and let god bring clarity by the events that unfold not by our own secret understanding and why do we piece together and what my mind has conjured up just let god bring the clarity let him make the picture more clear by bringing more to pass and let's just be comfortable with that but is it worth watching yes uh i watched the acceptance speech last night and kamala hare spoke first and then joe biden and kamala harris it was interesting it was surreal friends i this is when all these things start click click click click click popping off i realized i didn't realize until yesterday joe biden was catholic that shows you how interested i am in politics but uh i'm watching this and she's the first woman ever to be vice president the first woman of color first person of color i think to be vice president as well so many things they're claiming as milestones if it goes through and it's confirmed it'll it'll it'll um you know be new records new new achievements in that way but when she's standing there speaking she's giving all credit to that day that this what she calls success she's giving 100 credit to the right for women to vote she's giving all the credit say so many years ago we fought for the right to vote and women have fought and that has secured this victory here today you know statement like that so what was it it was the women's vote that got in the right guy for prophecy possibly i don't know it's not confirmed i don't want to jump ahead but if it is the right guy for prophecy and that guy who was the right guy for prophecy was the one who ushered in authority to the woman to the catholic church as i was reading through some quotes i come across an interesting one now friends these are just things that are interesting to me so please don't get ahead of the program and don't misinterpret what i'm saying what i'd like to say more than anything to you is i don't know if you walk away from here from anything and you want to ask me a question it's going to be the same answer i don't know but i'll tell you something i'm interested i'm curious i'm watching joe biden happens to be when he's inaugurated he'll be if it happens if it goes forward he'll be 78 years old he'll be the oldest president ever inaugurated so i don't know what the statistics are but it leaves an open door leaves an open door also [Music] i was reading some quotes throughout the day last couple days i was reading some quotes and i come across this quote where brother branham was talking about john f kennedy and he says his wife has more influence than him she's influencing the nation and i said he says and he's more she's more popular than he is and he makes this statement he he goes he even said i'm her husband i'm her husband that's the statement i'm her husband and brother branham said imagine that the president united states i mean brother ben was disgusted at this because what he's seeing is he's seeing a man take a submissive role amen and point to lifting up and putting women in prominent positions where they don't belong and brother madam knows that this is wrong not that the man liked his wife i mean that's not what he's but he's looking at it on a bigger scale and that she has more influence than him and he says then you know she's my i'm her husband that's how he wasn't the president united states i'm her husband because she was so popular and last night in in the acceptance speech joe biden made the statement he stopped and he looked and he goes and i'm jill's husband it's his wife and i'm joe's husband and i just read that quote a couple of times over the last couple days and all of a sudden it hit me like i can't believe what i'm hearing it's like a repeat starts promoting his wife and how wonderful she is and what a good first lady she'll be and then i i was told and i haven't confirmed it that joe biden also made the statement that that that uh i remember i'm her he's talking about camilla harris she's the vice president i'm her running mate or something like that but you see he's he's doing the same thing kennedy did he's promoting the women because this is a woman's nation the catholic church is represented as a woman the woman has to take over and i'm not talking about just women in general i'm talking about that woman female dominating spirit from all the way back in the book of genesis that first amen moved outside from the authority of the word and when their own reasoning wanted and desired to have that tree i mean she'd be moved without authority and she moved outside of authority amen she took it herself and there's always been that struggle amen that jezebel spirit that female dominating spirit which is on the catholic church which is on the nation and when you start seeing these things i'm sorry i'm i'm hearing the same things the same phrases and i thought this is super curious and super interesting where it'll go next i don't know what will be confirmed i don't know i don't know what to say i don't know what will happen next all i know is i'm curious enough to watch my interest is peaked i want to look at the quotes i want to look at what brother branham said i don't want to take away what he said i don't want to change what he said i don't want to manipulate what he said i just want to take what he said and watch what happens because this is interesting friends this is interesting what god will do next i don't know but what i want to caution you in is don't draw your own conclusions don't don't try to be the first one that figured it out don't try to be the ones that i knew i had a hunch i felt like well that's fine but let's just watch and see what happens i can tell you i gotta hunch i know what happened next and i could be a million miles from right i just i'm just i'm content just watching i'm content saying god you're doing something you've got our attention you're you're waving a little flag too many pieces are coming together that are too interesting and i'm just interested i feel like we're i feel like i feel like just me personally i feel like in many ways the bride is walking right in the footsteps of brother branham what he did at the end of his ministry the things he saw the things he knew and experienced was going on we're in so many ways moving through that same cycle and to me it's just fascinating i'm fascinated by it and that doesn't give me any any way of saying this means that or this will happen next but it's just super interesting to me and i hope it's super interesting to you so we can sit down at dinner and we can have some talk and say is this a possibility with that matter and maybe this and maybe that and you know we can have fun doing that we do that about heaven we do that about the millennium but when we get up from the table we got to be willing to say the real reality is i don't know the real truth is i don't know and god has surprised me so many times i mean it's almost like he does it on purpose friends it's almost like he'll show you something and everything lines up so good it's like god did it on purpose so you're so confident in what you're seeing so confident in the pieces that are together and i think i've got i mean i'm pretty sure that this is it and it's got to be that and god will pull a switcheroo so fast it leaves you dumbfounded how did this happen and it's like you're hanging out nowhere you're totally exposed and you're like god you did that on purpose you did that on purpose and at the end of the day you're thankful because if you let it work out once i try it again before too long i'd be off in my own religion with my own interpretation with my own understanding so i love it when god pulls a switcheroo on us and leaves your jaw dropped and be like i didn't see that coming i never foresaw that happening and then you can just relax and say i don't have to i don't have to foresee it i don't have to predict it i don't have to figure it out i don't have to be ahead of the curve all i got to do is stick with this prophet god will interpret his word by bringing it to pass and when he brings it to pass there'll be a witness in my heart says that's the truth i don't have to be super smart superhuman super nothing all i've got to do is be a believer so praise god don't set yourself up for a switcheroo don't get too far down the road friends just watch what god's doing and and be like all of us are just watch what god's doing and be amazed be amazed and say i didn't know that you could go checkmate from over here on the board god you've got moves that i've never dreamed of if anything i think 2020 would teach us that we don't know anything and we're failures at predictions praise god that's our protection friends that's our safety let god show us how ignorant we are let god show us how in our own mind and our own thinking we're never going to figure out what he's going to do what he's going to do he's already determined from before the foundation of the world it's going to happen it's going to happen right on time it's going to happen without our consultation he's going to do it and he's going to surprise us he surprised us and he will continue to surprise us and i'm excited about the surprises because every surprise so far has been exciting may not have been pleasant but they've been exciting so let's just let's just commit ourselves to trusting in the lord believing his word believing the prophet and letting god be god and him be in control let's all stand and we'll turn to another scripture i want to switch subjects because that's about as interested as i am in politics because we've got something that is sure we have something that's unmoving unchanging that's fixed it's not flexible by man's ideas it's not flexible by political waves movements it's fixed and it's sure let's look at galatians chapter 6. ernie i'm sorry genesis i'm sorry this is why you can't depend on me for anything i can't even give you my scripture reading right genesis chapter 6 and we're going to begin with the first verse and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wise of all which they chose and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he is also flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and twenty years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came into the daughters of men they bear children to them the same became mighty men excuse me men of old men of renown and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually let's be seated you can all be seated and we'll continue on i want to take a minute and look at this and for a title i just want to look at the unscientific salvation of the righteous seed the unscientific salvation of the righteous seed and you'll see why we got to that in some quotes that we get to in a minute but i'd like to start by reading this quote and christ is the mystery of god revealed it says all right now search the scriptures he said moses and all the law and so forth and the prophets in psalms spoke of him and again he said the scriptures testify of him he is the principle theme of the entire bible if you read the bible and don't see christ in every verse of it go back and read it again see if you can't see christ in every verse of the bible then you read it again because you missed something the bible is christ he is the word when you read in the beginning god created there is christ from that to the amen in revelation is every word testifying of jesus christ and that's why when i read that i get excited when i go back through the bible again and i'll tell your friends i i have to confess that there's times that i read things and i don't see it where is jesus christ and i don't see it i don't see the great story i don't see the great mystery amen but the key is brother said read it again read it again it may not be in the fifth reading or the 10th reading or the 25th reading but but god at some point he keeps unlocking this word to us and we'll read it again and read it again and all of a sudden you say i see it i see it and i've been just going through genesis just myself for my own personal devotions and very much enjoying it and you know we look at the the seventh seal displayed all the way back in the beginning when when god began to create by spoken word he formed himself a world and formed in eden and placed a man there and made that man god over the earth and that was his son but his son was alone and needed companionship and he pulled without of him something that came from him that would be united back with him in the crowning act of all creation and god was displaying a seventh seal all the way back there when you look back at that story amen what as a child or when we were in denominations was a story a story of creation now all have become all of a sudden became a story of christ and every story every story begins to fit that same pattern we start to see christ here christ here it's all speaking of christ and we we want to look at this scripture that we're reading that that we know men began to multiply on the face of the earth and we know that there's two seed lines and and and god is working with the righteous seedline seth we talked about wednesday night seth was a replacement for abel abel went down amen he was killed by cain and but seth came up brother bam said as a type of the resurrection amen because christ died for us and he was resurrected and so seth the type of the resurrection and when he came back he came back with the same nature the same spirit he was a replacement seed for the seed of of abel and he and he came down to that righteous seed as a herdsmen as a as a farmer as a shepherd and humble amen but cain's line cain was a tiller of the soil and as he was a tiller of the soil he became a craftsman amen he began to till in the soil and find all the materials he needed to where he would build a city he would have a son and build a city and name the city after the name of his son and so civilization started with cain now god's line was just simple humble farmers worshipping jehovah amen meditating but cain's line was was the lion who was seeking to acquire to gain to have they were manipulating creation for their own glory for their own good and now we see that in genesis 6 that there becomes an intermingling god was working with with the line through seth through god's line but they're becoming intermingling and and god became angry and he says let's read verse two or we'll start verse one again and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair they took them wives of all which they chose the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man but he is also flesh yet the spirit shall be a hundred and twenty years there were giants in the land in those days and also after that when the sons of god came into the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown and god saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thought of his heart was only evil continually when you look at that phrase the imagination of the thoughts of his heart the word imagination means the form or purpose so his purpose his form his framework his purpose his foundation or his whole purpose or whole mode of operation the imagination of his thoughts his devices or his plans of his heart of his inner man was evil continually started all the way back when eve was seduced by the serpent and she was seduced to leave the word because satan was beguiling her into seduction he was unlocking her lusts and brother brenham said she had a lust for knowledge she wanted to know and the serpent was manipulating that desire to know and i would say one thing that we learned wednesday when we talked wednesday that this word that's interpreted new testament lust so many times in a negative way is also interpreted in a positive way on desire like the prophets of old desire to see your day it's the same word jesus when he went to the last supper he said i've desired to eat this supper with you it's it's it's not a bad word in that context amen because what the prophets desired was the word what jesus desired was fellowship with the attributes those were not wrong desires and i would say eve and her desire to know i would say foundationally it may not have been a wrong desire she wanted to know this mystery she wanted to know the mystery of life she wanted to know this great mystery amen there was something there amen that she wanted to know about and i would say it may not have been at its core it may not have been evil it may not have been wicked her desire to know amen i'd say friends there's things that we want to know there's things we want to know about life there's things we want to know about prophecy there's things we want to know what the prophet said and how it'll work and how it'll come to pass there are things that we want to know and that the basic foundation of our desire to know is a love for the word but satan can come in and can manipulate that desire and he can bring it to a fleshly lust and now we want to know and it may no longer be for pure motives and because we want to know amen he begins to give us opportunities and ways in which we can find answers and those ways in which we can find answers and we can know amen they're going to lead us into death and not into life and that's the whole purpose amen he took a desire that may not have been wrong at the beginning but he began to manipulate or seduce until all of a sudden she had to know how to know because it was all of a sudden something was going to be satisfying to her to know on a fleshly way pleasing to the eye one to make one wise amen good for food it become it becomes a it becomes something that become personal for the flesh amen we can get off in the weeds so easily amen even with doctrine even with things that the message that teaches us because we have maybe not at the core or wrong desire to know to do what brother brennan meant by that to know this truth of the bible what this scripture means that's not necessarily wrong but when the devil comes in and begins to manipulate that desire amen and begins to turn it to a fleshly desire a thirst a craving to know or to know first or to know more it's the same scene repeating over and over and over again we've got to be so careful with the word that we just leave the word the way god gave it to us and we believe it and we trust in it and we stick with it amen and we have a desire to see it fulfilled but we wait for god to do it his way because his way is perfect eve she found a way she came to an understanding and she was able to reproduce a life but that brought death corruption and we're all suffering from the same thing and now god looks down at man and he sees all of mankind is in this same situation now their whole framework their whole purpose the imagination of the thoughts of their heart the whole purpose and all of their devising and devices and planning of the inner man is all evil continually it's all given over to lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is now the motivation that's motivating everything and god said in verse 6 genesis 6 6 and it repented the lord thee made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast in the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for repenteth me that i have made them he goes on to say in verse 8 but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord they realized when noah found grace in the eyes of the lord it didn't mean that all of a sudden noah started doing something good and god noticed that he's a good boy if god if noah was a recipient of grace he was a recipient of grace before the foundation of the world all the world had corrupted itself every every imagination of the thoughts of the heart were evil continually it was all corrupt but there's a recipient of grace from before the foundation of the world amen a part of that righteous line and god he's a noah found of all that was wrong and all that had corrupted his it grieved him at his heart that he had made man and he wanted to destroy all of man but he could not destroy all of man because there was a recipient of grace on the earth and noah found grace in the eyes of the lord and let's read again verse 8 but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god and noah got three sons shem ham and japheth now this is this is interesting terminology when he says he's perfect in his generations that word murphy perfect means complete whole entire or sound and when you turn to the word generations it means descendants results proceedings generations or genealogies so it wasn't just that this is the way i understand it it wasn't just that noah amen was perfect in that generation like he was the only one who was good in all of them but he was actually whole or complete in his genealogies he came from adam and man he wasn't part of the corruption the mixture of the seed lines i mean that's the way i understand it that that that he was perfect in his in his in his generation and so if god he found grace in the eyes of god and god was going to work through noah amen that he was going to bring bring about a salvation through noah now let's look at verse 22. we're going to back up but i just want to go to verse 22. and i want to read this together thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did he now let's look at chapter 7 verse 5 and noah did according to all that the lord commanded him now we're going to find out that what noah did that was so spectacular what noah did that created the only means of salvation through the wrath of god what noah did that was so outstanding that we still talk about it today what noah did amen the the way that he figured out how to save his household the way that he preserved his life and the life of his household and preserved the seed line that would carry on preserve the plan of god preserve the word everything it was so amazing this event that took place and what did noah do amen how did he accomplish it how did he figure it out how did he come to this understanding and one way he just obeyed the lord all he did was just obey the lord noah didn't figure anything out he didn't use mathematics skills science skills reasoning understanding he didn't do anything to preserve salvation he didn't do anything to preserve the lineage he didn't do anything to preserve his life or the life of his family are all the created beings that were on the earth what did he do all he did was believe god and act on what god said he obeyed god amen and we come to this day where there's another destruction that's coming amen there was a destruction by water then but he promised never to destroy by flood again this time there's going to be a destruction by fire amen and there's an ark of safety today friends there's an ark that's been built there's an invitation to come into the ark amen and and we we are standing here like noah amen uh building on the ark making everything ready inviting people to come into this ark of safety and what do we have to do to ensure figure out i mean what mechanism do we have to use there's the same one noah used and that is obey god so simple so simple but so complicated for so many people sim i would say this way it's simple but hard it's not hard but it's hard it's simple but it's complicated i'll say it this way all know it had to do with what god said but to do what god said made his life really complicated god told him what to make how to make it what the dimensions were how to construct it we're going to find out at all that's for a reason and noah didn't have to figure out why he didn't first have to go to school to become an engineer he didn't have to he didn't have to maybe have all the understanding of why he was building it this way or why he was doing it this way but he had to have enough faith in god to obey god and do it god's way you know and there's so many times for years sometimes when we're when we're new believers or give our hearts to the lord we don't always understand why why does this commandment matter why is brother bam so why is he so firm on this feminist spirit why there's a way i dress why is he so firm on clothing and entire why does he say it so hard and so firm why amen and it's not for us to figure out it's for us just to obey we don't have to go to the school of theology first we don't have to have the answer to the question first god did not have to tell noah amen the engineering qualities of the design of the ship before noah started building it the way god said build it we don't always have to understand why it has to be this way or why god cares about this or why we're to obey this why do we structure our services this way because that's the way god wanted it why does it why is the clothing i put on my body matters so much that brother ben would preach about it all the time all the time why why why you don't have to understand why but we're going to find out is noah built this ship god is a master craftsman there's not a human engineer can out-engineer god and god knew exactly how high the waves would be he knew how much rain would fall he knew what course the ship would have to take he knew he knew everything that was going to have to happen he knew how many animals would have to hold how much food it was going to have to hold like can you imagine god says okay i'm going to take two of every kind of unclean beasts seven pairs of every uh clean beast we're going to keep them of every kind we're going to put them in the ark got to have enough food and provisions and i'm not going to tell you how long but just have lots of food and provisions and figure it out i would be like one two three how many animals how many square foot per animal how much food does each species eat i mean what kind of food how much food what quantities we need to have see god told him all that because god already had it all figured out and friends i'll tell you today god's got it all figured out he sent a prophet and he doesn't always give us the explanation of why he just tells us the truth he shows us in the word we take the word we don't always know why but we know it's got to be this way so many times people question what the prophet said because they don't clearly see it they don't clearly understand it and then they want to regulate it to the prophet's opinion because if i regulate to the prophet's opinion i can use my reasoning on the word amen and i can still accomplish my own lust amen but i'm telling you if the prophet is telling us something over and over and over again and he's telling us it's the word and he's telling us god it doesn't you know what it doesn't even matter if you can piece it together in the bible that's a vindicated prophet of god amen i would say god just help me lord help me to obey help me to be simple-minded enough of a farmer and a shepherd and not an engineer or theologian where i can just take what he said and say be it unto me lord let me obey that with all of my heart if that's the way you want me to act if that's the way you want me to dress is this what you say about marriage and divorces this is how we're supposed to raise children if this is how we're supposed to conduct church if this is who qualifies for this position and this who qualifies for that amen i'm going to say amen lord help us to do it exactly the way you said do it so god ends up telling noah to do what god told noah to do was simple but it made noah's life complicated because now noah has got to in the face of all kinds of opposition he's got to take what god told him and he's got to do the opposite of what culture is doing he's got to do the opposite of what science says is good science amen he's going to do the opposite of everything his generation his society his culture calls normal calls correct calls saying he's got to do different than all of that and no doubt but he dramatizes it many times but he goes through all kinds of ridicule scorning shaming amen all kinds of conflict and difficulty just to accomplish it and the fact that it was a lot of work that it was a lot of work that he actually labored at the commandment of god he labored to bring forth the commandment of god amen so it was simple what god's asked us to do today is simple but hard not complicated but can be complex we just have to obey him brother ben said in the message of god hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same and so you can imagine how education and science is such great of such great tokens that we have left that there was such a civilization he's talking about all the things that you can find left over what a great civilization that must be by these memorials how that science and modern civilization and education must was was a must with people they must be it had to be there was hardly any i guess any illiteracy among them at all and so god searching through the great economy at that day in their system could not perhaps find the right type of a man until he found an illiterate maybe farmer in the name of noah a sheepherder and he gave him his message to preach to the people that was so simple to the scholarship of that day until the people stumbled over the simplicity of the message you know i i thought it was interesting also in the acceptance speech of kamala harris and joe biden they both referenced science as a major guiding post for their agenda though as it was in the days of noah so shall it be science we're going to use sound science they said my goodness i have a uh i have a que i i have problems with that term sound science because if science is so sound why can't we use the same textbooks your granddad used in school why can't you go to college with your grandpa's chemistry book under your arm if science is so sound and so solid and so trustworthy why can't you use the curriculum from 20 30 40 years ago and go to school and pass the test you can use the same math book you can use the same history book you use the same engineering principles of course your history book wouldn't have the last 30 years i mean but you see what i'm saying sound science that sounds science you put so much confidence it's constantly finding itself in error and changing its ideas and adjusting its theories and hypotheses and sometimes even reversing its conclusions and this was the day that noah lived in lowell lived in a super scientific day when everything was already figured out and no one began to take simply just simply take what god had told him and begin to share what god had told him and they began to laugh him to score him because he said water is going to fall from the sky and a thing called rain brother man said it had never rained on the earth before but i just want to make it clear just because you've never seen something happen before doesn't mean it can't happen and they they begin to say we can shoot the moon amen with a with a laser which they just did a few years ago again shot the moon with a laser to measure it we could shoot the moon with the laser amen and and we can tell there's no moisture up there i mean it doesn't matter whether there's moisture up there or not amen god knows how to put moisture up there amen and all of their science they were taking only what they could see and what they know but they couldn't understand that god knew amen he knew how to disrupt the earth he knew what tilting in on its axis would do he knew if he threw it off the taxes and moved it slightly out of orbit he knew that that water would come bursting out of the fountains of the deed gush upon the water amen that there would be a great evaporation and condensation because now the earth tilted it's moved and now heating and cooling and he god knew exactly how to get water to fall from the sky and all the elements were right there amen even their scientific achievement of a nuclear blast that god needed to make it happen because brother branham said some great blast a nuclear blast or something knocked it off attacks and knocked it out out of kilter so god was using their own science amen to destroy themselves and man always destroys himself god told noah said i will destroy the earth i will destroy everything that breathes with the breath of life in his nostrils i will destroy it but how did god destroy it he allowed man to take a scientific achievement and the violence that was all over the earth and warfare that would break out and one would launch a bomb or multiple bombs or however many nuclear weapons on another and the blast would move the earth and knock it out of kilter amen and god said i will destroy and when god destroyed he just let man loose in his own laboratory and we know that there's coming a volcanic and atomic fire that's going to renovate this earth and god's going to do it he's going to renovate the earth but how he's going to renovate the earth i believe he's going to do it the same way he renovated back then he's going to let man who's come to all of his knowledge and all of his science and his lust for power and violence spread upon the earth and he's going to do the same thing he's going to let a nuclear holocaust break out that'll cause whatever volcanoes or whatever happens upon the earth man thinks he's so smart he's always defending himself and his defense is his destruction see you realize so many times god gives us a word and god puts us out on the front line and god it gives us something to say and somebody to say it to or a stand to take and so many times we back up and pedal back on that amen because we're trying to protect ourselves amen but the moment we go silence on the word the moment we stop obeying the word is the moment we're bringing our own death and destruction man and trying to defend himself will destroy himself man trying to protect himself you know because nuclear weapons are a deterrent against war how do we keep from having war will we just build bombs i mean it makes sense to me right we don't want war to break out so we're going to build a bomb a big one so they know if they do anything bad we'll blow them up so then this country over here for a deterrent from them using their bomb i'm going to build another bomb what is this peace this is how smart man is this is the wisdom this is the achievement of politics this is the politics of peace and god is going to use that wisdom right there to destroy man and renovate this planet for you and i see if anything i've learned from going back and diving into the book of genesis and spending time in here if anything i've learned is as it was in the days of noah so shall it be come in the son of man it's the same thing same spirit same attitudes same approaches same scientific achievements same reliance on man and what man can do same security that comes from politics economics science and we're in the same boat praise god praise god so as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man let's look at chapter 6 14. [Music] i'm not going to get very far i'm just going to go into one more thing and i think we'll wrap it up today because i don't want to go into the next thing and i just feel the labor on this and then we'll stop genesis chapter 6 verse 14. [Music] make thee an ark of gopher wood room shout out making it in there excuse me and shall pitch it within and without with pitch and this is the fashion which thou shall make it of the length of the ark shall be 300 cubits the breath of it 50 cubits and the height of it 30 cubits a window shalt thou make to the ark and in the cubit shalt i'll finish it above and the door of the ark shall thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third story shalt thou make it so when god tells him the instructions he begins to tell him the dimensions and the rooms and the three levels and the window up top and the door and the side and we know that all of this is speaking salvation and all this is speaking of christ so noah may never have known what the door represents or the three levels represent he's just building it and it's serving a purpose in that day the door is the way by which they'll enter in amen and when they enter in then they'll be three levels for the animals and up top there'll be a window up in the top of the ark and and all of that served a function all of that served a purpose and if you realized amen what god was trying to accomplish amen in in the salvation of man he's showing a picture of the salvation of man what he will do to save man and he's showing it here because the ark is a type of christ and christ is the only ark that you can go into and be safe and i just i'll labor on this and if the children could pay attention you know to understand that this arc is more than just a cue story about animals and they all show up and they go in the ark but but god is actually showing our salvation in that salvation that salvation is a foreshadow of our salvation and god he told him he said make a door and he told him to only make one door because we know the scripture says that there is only one way to enter in into life and jesus christ is the door he is the door he's the only door so this ark this way of salvation this plan of salvation amen in the day when scientific achievement was at its height and the earth was filled with violence and all flesh had corrupted himself the only way of salvation was through the door and that door is jesus christ it's just as true today as it was in noah's day that if you want to be saved from the wrath of god you've got to go through the door and jesus christ is the door and jesus christ is the word of god he is the anointed word of god the anointed word of god is the word that's anointed for this day and the only way to enter in is through the word amen the word that's given us in this day we enter into the ark and then it's no coincidence that there's three levels to the ark because once you enter in you've got to go through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost and so you know these aren't stories for sunday school and that just is a cue story to pique the kids interest about animals but god was showing us that if there's going to be salvation this is my method for salvation the method for salvation is coming in through a single door amen and working your way up from one level to another level to another level till you get to the very source of life at the top and that is the light itself the person of the word excuse me brother bam said so it is at our ark jesus christ god opened the door for us on calvary he'll close it just as sure as he opened it john 10 7. we know this but i want to read the scripture in this context john 10 7 jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you i am the door the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door by me if any man enters in he shall be saved and she'll go in and out and find pasture brother rem says in the seventh seal it says the kingdom of god is coming and it's becoming more from negative to positive as it has been now that ought to choke people from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the holy ghost and then here so brother brahma is showing us that that through salvation he comes through luther justification wesley sanctification uh the pentecostals and the baptism the holy ghost but to hear to the person of the word to the place we've arrived to here and we know that that if we go all all the way over to revelation chapter three at the end of the literacy and church age and move into chapter four i mean we've come through luther's age wesley's age pentecostal age but then when he gets there there's an open door in heaven and in the ark there's an open window in the top of the ark amen you come in through christ you come in through justification sanctification baptism holy ghost but you enter the heavenlies from above the door to the rapture's been opened the source of light is revealed the heavenlies are on display through this open door so god excuse me is typing this with us even here today he's made it simple but in simplicity he's hid it from the wise from the wisdom of the wise i want to go on he says when he made this ark he pitched it he sealed it inside on the inside and on the outside i think that's super interesting and brother venom will take that pitching of the seal and they'll type it with christians and it'll say that they took another tree and they took that tree and they would beat it down and take the resin out of that tree and they would pour it into this gopher wood and gopher wood was really porous wood and he said it wasn't good wood to build with and he said it would sink if you put it out there would soak up the water but the way it would float is if it was filled amen with this resin from this other tree so christ was the tree that was cut down and beat and his life came out that would pour in us and he says go he said christians are absorbent to the holy ghost they're special trees that are made to be in this art special trees that are worthless and no good for salvation no good for floating in heart no good for building with until the resin of the holy ghost comes in and when it comes in he says it becomes hard as a rock and so god he's typing us with this but i think it's also another interesting type that lays here that he pitched it on the inside and on the outside because if you go to the seals you realize brother benham starts talking about the seven seals on the inside of the book but there's seals on the outside of the book because this plan of salvation is sealed on the inside and the outside there's two seals on the inside and the outside there's the seals that were revealed in revelation chapter six is the symbols but there's also the thunders that have been sealed up which brother bram says is on the backside on the outside [Music] and so this ark is just an amazing ark oh i just i just want to hit one other point i don't want to spend any any more time there's a lot of things we could go into but but it's amazing that there's a seal on the inside and outside and the seal like we spoke before is to preserve it's pitched on the inside and outside it's to preserve it's to strengthen it's to hold the thing in place amen and and the word has been preserved and we've been preserved by the word and by the life of the word and we went from useless material to the bride now is a very arc she's holding the word she's holding the door she's standing in the door of the ark amen building on this ark by by what by working in the word by laboring in the word she's holding the door open there's an ark on earth amen and she's went from being useless amen to being being part of a very arc of safety holding the door open standing in the door calling to them what did it it was the very life of jesus christ that has come back into these vessels amen that were nothing that were dead we're as good as dead amen where we're not fit and sufficient for salvation but he poured his life into the bride amen and now she's become a place of safety but i want to finish up with this thought on the raven in the dove if you could go with me to genesis chapter 8. verse four and i heard a brother i had a little bit of fellowship with the brother in south carolina and he was talking about this and i was just fascinated by it i've been looking at it in genesis 8 and 4 it said and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventh day of the month upon the mountain of ararat so the ark had been floating yeah you know it'd been rain 40 days and 40 nights they went into the ark seven days before and god shut the door and the fountains of the deep broke open and the heavens open and it began to rain and and and so you know many people believe that they were in the ark 40 days and 40 nights but really when you read the scriptures they were in the ark just a little over a year they were in the ark for the rain then the waters on the face of the earth and the time for the waters to abate and then noah wait 40 days and he sent out a raven and he sent out a dove and then the dove came back he waited seven days in it more and by the time it's all said and done it's about 370 some days that they're actually in the ark and then let's keep reading here the ark rested on the seventh month they come to rest on top of the mountain and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month and then the tenth month and the first day of the month were the tops of the mountain scene and it came to pass at the end of 40 days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground but the dove found no rest for the soul of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her and pulled her in unto him in the ark and he stayed yet another seven days and again excuse me he sent forth the dove out of the ark and the dove came into him in the evening and low and her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off so no one knew that the waters were abated from off the earth and he stayed yet another seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him anymore and it came to pass in the 601st year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dry and in the second month on the seventh and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried and god's speaking to noah saying go forth of the ark thou my wife my sons my son's wives with thee so we look at this i want to just look at the raven and the dove because brother branham in the scriptures all the time will use these birds as spirits symbols of spirits and we know the dove was a great symbol of the holy spirit and the raven is a great dove of the representative of the antichrist spirit and noah at the end of the destruction when the destruction is coming to an end amen he sends out of the window amen two birds he sends out a raven and he sends out a dove and the whole interaction between the two is very interesting and brother ben has a lot of things to say but he says the that raven brother tells us now that raven could go and eat on dead carrion all those dead bodies that were destroyed in the destruction when god overthrew man he could feast on all of that he can go to and fro and back and forth and i mean it was no problem for him but when the dove went out of the ark amen she found no place to put the sole of her feet she couldn't rest on the dead bodies she couldn't rest on the dead on the judge amen she had to look for something else she had to look for something with life or potential for life in it he said the dove can only eat the seed the wheat seed amen but a crow is a hypocrite can eat both it can it can feed with the dove like a dove and be in church and it can feed with the world like the worldly amen is that it's a hypocrite bird a hypocrite spirit and so the the crow goes out of the window and the crow finds plenty of places to rest her feet right and plenty of substance out there on the dead bodies and brother branham says the message i will restore from 54 now look at the vine grow up it started right there on these two spirits from these boys that come on down pro and con starting about cain and abel down through the bible even in the ark there was a dove and a raven sitting on the same roof the dove can say i could fly raven says i can too one could call the other one could too noah turned one loose and he was satisfied the raven fly on those old dead bodies and eat but when he turned the dove loose she could find no rest for the soles of her feet and she came back and knocked on the door to get in i thought the the terminology that we have here is interesting and the symbol i'd say the symbology to me is fascinating because two spirits go forth if you just stick with me this way two spirits go forth the holy spirit in an unholy spirit they go forth but the holy spirit can find no place to rest her feet but the raven is satisfied with what the raven finds and the raven can go back and forth to and fro and be completely satisfied with what the raven finds and this this terminology to and fro reminded me of job chapter 1 verse 7 when the sons of god presented themselves into unto god that came before him and satan came also and he said and the lord said unto satan whence cometh thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it so satan had been sent out of heaven and had been cast out of heaven and he was going to and fro and he come back to the presence of god and god said where have you been he goes i've been going to and fro and all the earth because he's satisfied with what he finds on the earth just like this raven spirit goes out and satisfied with the dead bodies of those that have been judged and if i could if you could just stick with me in my analogy and then the typology and we could look at this maybe with with spiritual eyes after judgment when man is judged you know god two spirits come out because satan was overthrown he was cast down to earth and he come to earth and he corrupted earth and the judgment set in upon man amen and man now is under the wrath of god and two spirits had gone out and one spirit found a place amen because the scripture says that we were all dead in sin and trespasses we were all dead amen and actually i want to read this scripture together let's go to ephesians chapter 2. i want you to catch my thinking in the context of where i'm coming from ephesians chapter 2 and i'll start with verse 1. ephesians chapter 2 and 1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin so you start this life dead you start this life in judgment and brother branham actually will begin to to type us from the first destruction of the world all the way back in genesis 1 chapter 1 verse 2 when water covered the face of the deep but there were seeds down inside that was the first judgment by a flood and brother bennett even types us with that that your soul is covered over with water darkness covers the deep but god has to bring the light to penetrate it the light moves back the water the light hits the seed and the seed comes forth he's even typing our new birth typing us from coming from a phase of destruction to coming to new life so he's typing that and here he says we were we were we were dead in trespasses and we started off dead we started off judged like the earth was judged we started off shrouded in darkness with no form and void and darkness cover the face of our deep he said where in time passed you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air she walked according to this spirit this raven spirit according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love or with he loved us even when we were dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved so the raven and the dove go forth and everything's let me say it this way everything's spiritually dead spiritual death is crept in and the raven is satisfied with this environment the raven can go to or for over the face of the earth fly about and be be filled and be satisfied and brother ben said he was out there just a glutton plenty to feed on plenty to satisfy his desires but the dove of the holy ghost is out here over the judgment just follow me over the judgment and that dove has no place to put her feet can fly over can move around can observe but no place to put her feet so noah takes the dove back in and noah waits seven days now brother branham says there's been a seventh-day sabbath for the old testament and a sabbath for the new testament so i want you to look at this is seven day old testament seven day new and there's been a sabbath for the old testament after seven days he sends her back out again and then when he sends her back out again remember the first time she found no everything was spiritually dead everything was under the judgment and then she could find no place to set her feet but this time when she was sent out amen after seven days she came back with a hot with an olive leaf i kept calling it holly leaf during devotions and the kids kept laughing at me they told me i better be careful if i preached this if i say holly leaf from here on out i mean olive leaf there that's my disclaimer come back in with an olive leaf in her mouth amen which means that the that the holy ghost had found a place that she could rest upon and where did he find that place in the jordan river amen when the holy ghost descended like a dove and rested upon jesus christ now there was something amen coming out of the destruction there was something not just something that come out of destruction but something that was going to be pre-peace upon the earth because the holy ghost when returned to noah returned with an olive leaf in her mouth brother brahm said see a symbol of peace now there was peace coming upon the earth so after the the first one went forth she could find no rest and after seven days she went out again and this time she found a place to come down matthew 3 16 it says in jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descend like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased so the dove lighted the dove had a place to set her feet now upon the earth this portion that was this tree it was the tree of life but this tree of life who was going to be nailed to a roman tree it meant so that you come back with an olive leaf a token of peace and return back and say there's now peace on the earth and john 1 32 says and john bear records saying i saw the spirit descend from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me the baptized water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptized with the holy ghost so now now in the destruction the earth is the earth is under destruction it's under judgment but now under the judgment the holy ghost has come out after seven days and it's returned with an olive leaf there's now peace the price has been paid peace is coming but i want to look at the third time because it comes back in and then another seven days he sends it out a third time and let's read that together let's go back to genesis chapter 8 genesis chapter 8 verse 11 and the dove came into him in the evening and low in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off so no one knew that the waters were abated from off the earth and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him any more there's coming a time in the redemption the end of the cycle of of judgment and destruction when judgment is being abated and it's and it's coming back to what god intended and he's preserving life there come a time where the the the the holy ghost could find no tree to rest upon until the tree of life came in jesus christ could rest on that tree and bring peace a token of peace back because now that tree paid the price for our peace but there's coming a time where the holy ghost is sent out again at the end of the new testament and when that holy ghost is set on again it doesn't come back anymore what was that dove looking for a place to rest her feet amen and god his whole goal was always to dwell among his people his goal was to dwell with his people amen but the curse had separated us from that and he paid the price he gave the the token of his life and he paid the price so that the the holy ghost would come out again and rest upon jesus christ and bring peace upon the earth amen and the holy ghost came on the day of pentecost to rest upon the people but they left the word but there's going to come a time at the end of seven days when the holy ghost comes out when it will be by the by the preaching of the end time message amen that the holy ghost will come back in the church again and now not to come back to return to come back and return because the plan is filled now the plan is finished now the purpose the intent amen was their god to dwell among his people and we live in that day friends when the holy ghost has come in the full measure by the opening of the seals it's come at the end of destruction it's come for new life come not to return again come not back and forth but we're at the end of the last seven days the last cycle and the holy ghost has come back the lord jesus christ has returned in the full measure of the word return in the form of the holy ghost the person of the holy ghost has come back to what to unite with you and i and god showed all the way back in the ark and the simplicity of abraham or implicity of noah sitting on a dove sitting on a raven coming back going back he was just a shepherd he was just a farmer but he was showing we come through the door we go through justification sanctification bats and the lord goes to the doorway to heaven there's been two spirits working at the destruction of man two spirits working one couldn't find a place and then jesus christ came and could find a place to rest her feet but now at the restoration of the word now the land becoming clear the water's drying up amen the curse coming to an end now the holy ghost can come out and now it's christ in you the hope of glory this has been god's great plan this has been god's great goal that dove now lives in you and i brother brahms said in the feast of trump this is the message i was alluding to the holy spirit has been bound by the denominational rivers for almost 2 000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said he promised now let's look at genesis 8 and 13. right after that said and it came to pass in the 601st year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dry after all that finally noah removes the covering of the ark and i tell you friends at the end time the covering has been taken off of our ark so that we can see we can see all about him we see who we are and what he's been doing what he's been doing through the old testament what he's been doing through the two new testament how he's been saving how he's been redeeming how he's preserved life how it's all happened now he takes the covering off the ark and we can see and the next thing that happens after all of that is known as family go out into a bright new world a purged world a clean world a fresh world perched from sin perched from destruction perched from the once of man and friends we've been all the way through this journey but now it's time we've come to the time the covering's been taken off the ark the holy ghost has come back into the church the coverings taken off the ark and now it's time for us to step into a bright new world not burn over by water but burn over by fire noah a great prophet told us all these things but we didn't know what it meant until another great prophet come along and showed us the story within the story the great story the great story that all stories are telling all stories match this story this story interprets all stories this great story is the unlocking of the bible and now we can see we don't have to be smart we don't have to be geniuses friends let's all stand musicians if you want to come we don't have to figure anything out noah to lay down such a beautiful type that will mean so much for us in this day noah didn't have to figure anything out he didn't have to be exceptionally bright brother branham said he could have been illiterate but all he had to do was obey the word and we here who are in the fulfillment of all of these types all of these shadows all of these types come into fulfillment what do we have to do do we have to figure him out do we have to understand do we have to have degrees and comprehension and know what god's doing we don't have to understand friends all we have to do is believe and obey and then just like these shadows and times get clearer and clearer if we'll just accept believe obey leave it the way the prophet said it not not manipulate it not change it not try to get gain out of it not try to get personal praise out of it but just leave it the way it is be a humble shepherd a sheep herder believe it and leave it the way it is then all of a sudden you can look back and say aha aha aha aha i get it i see it i know what god's doing and when it happens that way who gets all the credit for it god does i say we live in a strange time but i say we live in a good time i say like jesus said to his disciples many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things you see and hear the things you hear they had it in types they had in shadows they knew it was pointing to something else but what it pointed to they couldn't figure out they couldn't grasp it amen and we're living in the day when the shadows and types are graspable they're unfolding before our eyes we're looking back and saying aha that's what it was aha that's what it was and now the very things that the prophet of god has said 50 60 65 70 years ago that you just scratch your head we're coming to the time where we're looking and saying aha aha that's what it was and god's going to continue to do that friends but he's going to do it with the same kind of people he's always used ignorant unlearned sheepherders now don't go dropping out of school brother bram said you need an education to live in this life but what i mean is you don't need to have your spiritual intellectual humanistic revelation understanding teaching a man-made doctor you don't have to figure it out you don't have to figure it out anymore noah figured out all you got to do is believe and say god i believe that word your prophet said he meant and it's coming to pass i see stuff i don't understand but i'm going to wait on you to interpret your word by bringing it to pass let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you we thank you god for a word that's so true and so right so solid lorn god when everything around us is shifting the modern thinking the trends understandings and teachings and things that have seemed solid lord for generations are now very flexible lord moral ideas and even the rule of law and order things that in the natural in this united states that seem so fixed and so certain are now so uncertain lord and god i pray that you'd give us the capacity to get our eyes off of the earth and back on you lord that we wouldn't be taken uh and distracted by all of these things lord you rise up and you tear down you appoint and you place you move lord you do as you wish and we rejoice in all that you do help us lord to stay humble to stay reverent to stay loving lord help us to watch as you work a miracle as you work your word and you unfold your word and you pull surprises and you take turns we never expected but we want to say lord we love you for it because only you can do this help us lord to be like noah lord and all the prophets of old they didn't have to know everything to obey they didn't have to be able to answer every question to believe lord your prophet dramatizes and tells us noah had so many questions from the scientific community and all those that were around him so many questions he couldn't answer so many evidences and proofs that they would show to him and they would have data and they would have charts maybe and and perhaps they would have uh significant bits of information but lord he didn't matter to him because you said help us take the same spirit lord and god may that dove that went out the third time may it find a permanent place in my heart lord may it find its place lord as the waters have dried up off of my heart lord lord you've spoken and brought the light and brought the life to the seed and the seed is grown now into a tree of life within my heart i pray lord that that holy ghost that dove finds its place in our hearts as your children lord and there you abide for that's your promise god help us to receive your word and stick with it help us to rejoice in it and take delight on it help us lord to see ourselves to see your plan of redemption and ourselves in that plan in every story go with us throughout this day and through the week lord as things get tumultuous in our country and in our communities may we have a whistle on our lips a smile on our face a song in our heart because all is well because i have a father i have a king and he controls the kingdoms of man he puts in place who he wants he gives kingdoms to who he desires he rules in the affairs of man and he's a king over the heathen nations god all is well with me and everything you do lord is good and everything you do is for your glory and everything you do is in line with what that prophet taught us help us to see it lord reveal it to us help us to rest upon it we love you go with us lord help us to not get caught up in any spirits other than your holy spirit no pentecostalism no communism no patriotism no conservatism or liberalism lord no politicism but lord let us only be caught up in your holy ghost in your word let it be the only thing that matters to us we love you father we ask for your blessing to be upon us guide us lord as we commit our life
