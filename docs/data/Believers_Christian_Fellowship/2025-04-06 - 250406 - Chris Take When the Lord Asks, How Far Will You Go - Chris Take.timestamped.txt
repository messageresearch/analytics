[12:31] hospitality. The Sanders there taking
[12:33] good care of us as usual. And uh you
[12:37] know this is one of the places we come

[12:46] You know we we just feel very spoiled
[12:50] and and uh so thank

[12:57] places when you travel and preach that
[13:01] refresh you.
[13:03] Well, amen. First Kings chapter 17, and
[13:06] we're going to read verse one to verse
[13:08] 16. And I I tried
[13:11] to I tried to where I could shorten the
[13:15] readings, but we're going to have a few
[13:17] different uh lengthy readings, but
[13:19] that's okay. We love the word, right?
[13:21] Amen. I knew you'd say amen. How how are
[13:24] you not going to say
[13:25] amen? Praise the Lord. First Kings
[13:28] chapter 17 and verse one. And Elijah the
[13:31] Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of
[13:33] Gilead, said unto Ahab, "As the Lord God
[13:35] of Israel liveth, before whom I stand,
[13:38] there shall not be due nor rain these
[13:41] years, but according to my word." And
[13:44] the word of the Lord came unto him,
[13:45] saying, Get thee hence, and turn thee
[13:47] eastward, and hide
[13:49] thyself by the brook Cherith, that is
[13:52] before Jordan, and it shall be that thou
[13:54] shalt drink of the brook, and I have
[13:57] commanded the ravens to feed thee
[13:59] there." So he went and did according
[14:02] unto the word of the Lord. For he went
[14:04] and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is
[14:07] before Jordan. And the ravens brought
[14:10] him bread and flesh in the morning, and
[14:12] bread and flesh in the evening, and he
[14:14] drank of the brook. And it came to pass
[14:17] after a while that the brook dried up,
[14:18] because there had been no rain in the
[14:21] land. And the word of the Lord came unto
[14:23] him, saying, Arise, get thee thee to
[14:26] Zerapath, which belongth to Zidon, and
[14:29] dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a
[14:31] widow woman there to sustain thee. So he
[14:34] arose and went to Zerapath. And when he
[14:36] came to the gate of the city, behold,
[14:38] the widow woman was there gathering of
[14:40] sticks. And he called to her and said,
[14:42] "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water
[14:44] and a vessel that I may drink." And as
[14:47] she was going to fetch it, he called to
[14:49] her and said, "Bring me, I pray, thee, a
[14:50] morsel of bread in thine hand." And she
[14:53] said, "As the Lord thy God liveth, I
[14:55] have not a cake, but an handful of meal
[14:58] in a barrel, and a little oil in a
[15:01] cruise, and behold, I am gathering two
[15:03] sticks that I may go in and dress it for
[15:06] me and my son, that we may eat it and
[15:08] die." And Elijah said unto her, "Fear
[15:11] not. Go and do as thou hast said, but
[15:13] make thereof a little cake, sorry, make
[15:17] but make me thereof a little cake first,
[15:20] and bring it unto me, and after make for
[15:22] thee and for thy son. For thus sayeth
[15:25] the Lord God of Israel, the barrel of
[15:26] meal shall not waste, neither shall the
[15:28] cruise of oil fail until the day that
[15:31] the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.
[15:33] And she went and did according to the
[15:35] saying of Elijah. And she and he and her
[15:37] house did eat many days. And the barrel
[15:40] of meal wasted not, neither did the
[15:42] cruise of oil fail according to the word
[15:44] of the Lord which he spake by Elijah.
[15:47] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[15:49] Lord Jesus, we thank you, Lord, for your
[15:52] presence this morning, for being with
[15:54] us, Lord. Sometimes it's hard to put
[15:56] into words, Lord Jesus, just how amazing
[15:58] it is, Father, to be a part of the
[16:01] kingdom of God. Lord, truly a blessing,
[16:04] truly a a just a vision of glory before
[16:07] us, Lord Jesus, as as we walk this path,
[16:10] Lord, we have an eternal destination,
[16:12] Lord Jesus. And Father, we the
[16:14] relationship that we have with you grows
[16:16] sweeter as the days go by, Lord. And I
[16:19] just pray that you would lift us this
[16:21] morning up into the heavenlies, Lord,
[16:23] that we would put aside, Father, how we
[16:25] feel in our bodies, Lord Jesus. Maybe
[16:27] there be those among us who are not
[16:28] feeling well. May you touch them and
[16:30] lift each one of us, Lord, tiredness or
[16:33] soreness or stress of life. May we step
[16:35] up, Lord, into that other dimension,
[16:38] Father, that you could come and minister
[16:39] to us, Lord. Father, like Elijah out
[16:42] there, Father, that you would come and
[16:44] bring the word, bring the bread, Lord,
[16:45] and minister to us, Father. Though
[16:47] though the world may be in the condition
[16:49] that it it it is in, Lord, we have
[16:51] stepped aside and we ask you to speak to
[16:54] us. We commit all things into your
[16:56] hands. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[16:58] Amen. You may have your seats this
[17:06] morning. I'd like to speak uh on when
[17:10] the Lord
[17:11] asks, how far will you go? When the Lord
[17:16] asks, how far will you go? You know, we
[17:20] can say in in in wonderful, beautiful
[17:21] moments like sitting in church where
[17:23] we're all feeling very fresh and happy,
[17:25] we say yes all the way. Yeah, but he
[17:28] doesn't ask us a lot of times in those
[17:31] times. He asks us when we have a little
[17:35] bit of meal left and a little cruise of
[17:37] oil. So the widow woman, she's there and
[17:43] it's not it's not her fault that there's
[17:47] a famine in the land. Um, brother man
[17:50] actually says here in enticing spirits,
[17:54] "What about Elijah when he came when he
[17:57] come down off of Mount Carmel, been up
[17:59] there for a long time and he met a poor
[18:01] widow woman. She was an alien, a
[18:04] gentile, and when he met her down there,
[18:07] she was picking up some sticks in the
[18:08] yard and God told him, "Go down there to
[18:11] that widow's house. What a place for the
[18:13] preacher to go." So, she was not even a
[18:16] Jew. She was a Gentile. So she's in this
[18:18] position and and not of her own doing,
[18:22] but the Lord was dealing with her heart
[18:26] and with the same question, how far will
[18:29] you go? So the prophet comes to her and
[18:31] he and he says, "Go make me a cake first
[18:35] and then there'll be food for you and
[18:38] your son." So she only had enough for
[18:40] one meal. Yeah. Barely enough. And he
[18:43] said, he said, "Put it all into one cake
[18:45] and give it to me."
[18:47] and and the the it's hard for us
[18:49] sometimes to wrap our heads around what
[18:50] God will ask us to do because we call it
[18:54] foolishness
[18:56] but God calls it faith
[19:00] it's God's word what what man
[19:02] calls wise God calls foolish and what
[19:05] God calls wise man calls foolish so
[19:08] there's something about us in our
[19:10] journey that where we walk and this is
[19:11] kind of what I by God's grace I want to
[19:13] bring you to where we have to realize
[19:15] that we don't do things according to the
[19:18] rules of this earth.
[19:20] We live our lives according to the rules
[19:22] of the universe which is the spoken word
[19:23] of God. Amen. Don't forget that the
[19:25] world can pervert but it is the spoken
[19:28] word of God and he's promised it cannot
[19:30] return to him void. So the world will be
[19:33] resurrected one day and we'll get to
[19:35] walk on in the millennium.
[19:37] But the rules of the universe God set in
[19:40] place. But the rules of the of the earth
[19:42] of the rules of man, man's wisdom that
[19:45] man has said this is how you get
[19:47] success. This is how you
[19:49] you this is how you survive. This is how
[19:52] you live. Th this is life. Their
[19:55] definitions you God now comes with the
[19:58] word and he asks a widow woman to do
[20:00] something there where the world would
[20:02] say that wasn't very nice. That was not
[20:04] very kind. How how could you do that?
[20:06] Somebody need to be helping this woman.
[20:08] And here the word comes to her and says
[20:11] give me the last cake.
[20:14] And the and the word looks on and says
[20:15] that man is arrogant.
[20:18] So you have you have the widow woman
[20:20] dealing with the position of this is my
[20:22] last meal and you have the prophet
[20:25] dealing
[20:26] with how could I ask her for that?
[20:30] See any anytime God asks the Lord asks
[20:33] us how far will you go? It's going to
[20:36] cost you everything.
[20:38] But he wants to know. There's a couple
[20:41] of reasons he wants to know. He wants
[20:42] you to know how far you can go in your
[20:44] walk with him to give you confidence in
[20:47] him. And he also wants to know how far
[20:51] will you go? He wants to know what is
[20:53] the character that is within my child
[20:55] within my son. I have I have a great
[20:57] responsibility I want to give to them. I
[20:59] have something I want them to do. I need
[21:01] to know how far will you go?
[21:04] The widow woman went all the way and God
[21:07] provided everything she had need of for
[21:10] that season in Hebrews chapter 2. 1957.
[21:15] It's the sermon, not the chapter. And
[21:17] the barrel never went empty on the or
[21:20] the cruise dry until God sent rain on
[21:23] the earth. She put God before her
[21:26] children. She put God before anything
[21:29] else. She taken the kingdom of God
[21:31] first. God must have first place in your
[21:34] heart, first place in your life, first
[21:37] place in everything that you do or what
[21:39] you are. God must be first. He doesn't
[21:43] want the second place. He doesn't
[21:45] deserve the second place. He deserves
[21:47] the best and the first and all that
[21:50] we've got. He deserves it.
[21:53] So, he deserves the best place. and and
[21:56] and I really want you to step into this
[21:59] this thought with me, this perspective
[22:01] with me, because y'all are sitting there
[22:03] saying, "Amen. Praise God." But you've
[22:05] been there where you're standing there
[22:07] like, "I can't I mean, how much further
[22:10] can I go? I mean, the you know, it could
[22:12] be the the tank's empty, the bank
[22:13] account's empty, or it could be
[22:16] physically, mentally." That's a big one
[22:18] today, mentally. I mean, that's a
[22:19] devil's battleground, right? And the
[22:21] world has tapped into that. So, what do
[22:23] you want? It's it's a buffet of mental
[22:26] illness support in the world today. What
[22:28] do you want? Look, all you need is God.
[22:30] See, the Holy Spirit in your life to
[22:32] train you and to teach you how to
[22:33] overcome.
[22:36] So, put yourself in that shoes. Put
[22:38] yourself in her shoes. She's there. She
[22:40] She All she has left is is a little bit
[22:42] of food. I mean, I I don't know that we
[22:44] all have different stories and
[22:45] backgrounds where we come from, but not
[22:48] very often in the day that we live in
[22:49] here in America have we experienced that
[22:52] where we literally had nothing left in
[22:54] the cupboards. Not even a scratch. You
[22:56] know, there's always some kind of, you
[22:58] know, some boxed something. We've been
[23:00] voided as long as possible. It's like,
[23:02] well, I guess we'll eat that now, right?
[23:04] There there's there's stuff like that.
[23:06] But to to have to to be called to the
[23:08] point of having to give up all that she
[23:10] had. It wasn't just that that now she
[23:12] can't eat or she doesn't have food, but
[23:14] her son is there dying
[23:17] and the Lord is asking her to hinge her
[23:20] child's future on this man who just
[23:24] walked out of the wilderness
[23:26] with a word she not yet heard before.
[23:29] This is not something that happened.
[23:30] This wasn't a tradition.
[23:33] This wasn't, you know, okay, well,
[23:34] that's time of year, you know, all the
[23:36] the older men go to the widows and ask
[23:38] for a cake. That's what we do every
[23:39] year. that that's not what it was. I
[23:41] mean, no, everyone else is like, "Hey,
[23:44] we're going to help one another like get
[23:46] food and get the meals and and and the
[23:48] grain and and we're going to work
[23:49] together to survive and and then there's
[23:51] nothing left." And it even it even, you
[23:54] know, seems like there's maybe not even
[23:55] any firewood. I don't know if people
[23:57] were munching on firewood in that times,
[23:59] but she takes two sticks to make a
[24:01] little fire. So, everything is it she's
[24:03] in this place of of this is the end. And
[24:08] we get to that. Remember, this is
[24:09] spiritual. We get to that place
[24:11] spiritually where we think, "Well, this
[24:12] is the end. There's there's there's
[24:14] nowhere to go. There's nothing left to
[24:16] do. Lord, why have you not yet made a
[24:19] way? Lord, why have you not yet done
[24:21] something? I've prayed. Is there
[24:23] something in my heart I need to I need
[24:25] to surrender more to you?" And you you
[24:27] examine your life and you examine what
[24:28] you're doing and where you are. And
[24:30] you're like, you realize, Lord,
[24:32] everything is before you. Everything is
[24:33] is pure before you. And here I am. Why
[24:36] have you not yet answered?
[24:39] And then he speaks to your heart and he
[24:41] says, "How far will you go?" You see, he
[24:44] he's not looking for you to have faith
[24:47] that he will answer. He's looking to you
[24:51] to have faith to keep going.
[24:55] We know he's going to answer. We know
[24:58] it. It's his promise in the word. He
[25:00] will answer. But we expect him to answer
[25:03] before we go any distance.
[25:06] But he's now not asking you will you
[25:09] have faith that I will meet the needs.
[25:11] He's not asking you that. He's asking
[25:13] you will you go all the way.
[25:18] Will you go to the last It's a lot of
[25:20] stairs there. So I just couple you. He's
[25:24] asking you well you know what he's
[25:25] asking you to go all the way down. And
[25:30] it's like but I'm used to two steps and
[25:32] I'm to the floor. And he says no there's
[25:34] four more.
[25:36] And then he asked you to go all the way
[25:38] back up.
[25:40] Why, Lord, I feel goofy. He says, "Do it
[25:43] again. How far will you go?" Amen. He
[25:48] asked you to walk to the back. Sorry,
[25:51] camera folks. He asked you to walk all
[25:53] the How far will you go? Will you stop
[25:55] here? Well, that's far enough. He says,
[25:58] "No, go. Keep Lord. There's got to be an
[26:01] answer right here, right now." He says,
[26:02] "Keep going. Then you go all the way."
[26:04] Then the door opens. There's a door
[26:07] right there. The door opens. And that
[26:10] one's nice and smooth and quiet.
[26:13] So it opens up. He says, "How far will
[26:16] you go? How goofy will you look? How how
[26:19] how unstable will you look to the
[26:22] world?" Peter and John,
[26:25] they were fed up with the Pharisees, the
[26:28] Sadducees, the religious system.
[26:31] John, I believe, had revelation there
[26:33] was coming a Messiah. Peter, I don't
[26:35] know, he was just a
[26:38] fisherman. And this guy walks up and
[26:40] says, "Leave your job. Leave the fish.
[26:45] Leave the nets. Don't even sell the
[26:47] boat. Just drop it and walk and follow
[26:50] after me." Amen. And we say, "Oh, you
[26:54] know, praise the Lord." And we adjust
[26:56] our halos.
[27:01] He want he he doesn't ask you for easy
[27:04] things. He might start out that way with
[27:08] some of us. He didn't with Peter. Yeah.
[27:10] He says, "Hey, come
[27:12] on." But you see, Peter was prepared for
[27:15] that position. Peter was prepared for
[27:18] that promotion. The world says, "Wow,
[27:20] you just lost everything." But Peter was
[27:24] promoted.
[27:26] When the Lord asks, "How far will you
[27:27] go?" In Mark
[27:30] 10:29, and Jesus answered and said,
[27:32] "Verily, I say unto you, there is no man
[27:34] that hath left house or brethren or
[27:37] sisters or father or mother or wife or
[27:40] children or lands for my sake and the
[27:42] gospels." But he shall receive 100fold
[27:45] now in this time houses and brethren and
[27:48] sisters and mothers and children and
[27:50] lands with
[27:52] persecutions. and in the world to come
[27:55] eternal
[27:56] life. But many that are first shall be
[28:00] last and the last first. Amen. Let's
[28:04] step over to Luke
[28:09] 7. Luke chapter 7 in verse 36.
[28:30] Luke
[28:39] 7:36. And one of the Pharisees desired
[28:42] him that he would eat with him.
[28:50] And he went into the pharaoh the
[28:51] Pharisees house and sat down to meet.
[28:54] And behold, a
[28:55] woman in the city which was a sinner,
[28:58] when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in
[29:00] the Pharisees house, brought an
[29:02] alabaster box of ointment. Now, this is
[29:04] a
[29:05] familiar story in the the book
[29:10] here. And but I want you to think about
[29:14] something. Excuse me. To be a to be in
[29:17] her position as a prostitute. That was
[29:20] capital
[29:21] punishment. That was a
[29:23] stoning. I mean, we saw the story,
[29:25] right? They they dragged the woman in a
[29:27] different place in the scriptures to
[29:28] Jesus and say, "Hey, we caught her in
[29:30] the act." And they had their stones and
[29:32] they were ready to do what had to be
[29:33] done according to the law of Moses. So,
[29:35] she
[29:36] risked by coming to the Pharisees to
[29:39] this home. She risked her natural life.
[29:47] So she she had to fight that. I like to
[29:51] think about it this way. She she was
[29:53] probably she heard about Jesus. She
[29:55] heard he was going to be there and she
[29:57] probably had a little box and she walked
[29:59] up and she walked back from the door. Oh
[30:01] man, I don't know if I can do this. And
[30:04] she walked back to the door and she
[30:05] turned back. She says, "Well, how how am
[30:07] I going to do this? You know, do I walk
[30:08] in? What what do I do?" She was scared.
[30:14] She was
[30:16] scared.
[30:17] And so finally she g she gets through
[30:20] the
[30:21] door
[30:23] and he didn't make it easy.
[30:27] Jesus didn't make it easy. He was there
[30:30] sitting in with the Pharisees. Yeah. So
[30:34] now here's her opportunity to to come to
[30:37] him and she's finally worked up the
[30:38] courage to come to him and she finds out
[30:40] where he is and she realizes, "Oh,
[30:42] that's the Pharisees house. Give me a
[30:44] little bit of liberty here in the story
[30:46] to make this point." And and so he's not
[30:49] he's not sitting on a rock out in the
[30:51] pastures, you know, with people or with
[30:54] his disciples. He's
[30:57] where he is hard to get to in this
[31:01] sense.
[31:03] not impossible to get to. I told my my
[31:05] son the other day he was carrying
[31:07] yesterday carrying the suitcases down
[31:09] the stairs and he says it's you know I
[31:11] can't do it. I'm like it's I didn't say
[31:13] it would be easy.
[31:15] I said I know it's hard but I know you
[31:17] can make it right. I know that you can
[31:19] overcome the challenge. And it's like we
[31:21] we have to learn that as children cuz
[31:23] then we grow up and it's like oh well
[31:24] it's hard so I can't do it. How many
[31:28] times do we hear that? How many times do
[31:30] we do that to the Lord? The Lord makes
[31:32] it hard. And because it's hard, we say,
[31:35] "I can't do it." But hard does not equal
[31:39] impossible.
[31:40] Right? Hard just means it's difficult.
[31:45] So Jesus made it difficult on purpose
[31:47] because he wanted to
[31:48] know for this little sister, how far
[31:52] will you go
[31:55] for what you need? He asked her to go
[31:57] right into the lion's den.
[32:01] right into the presence
[32:03] of the enemy in a sense, right? I mean,
[32:07] it's the Pharisees, but her position and
[32:09] everything. Risk, risk everything.
[32:12] And what does the world says? Well, no,
[32:14] we must take calculated risks.
[32:17] Risks like this business-wise with your
[32:21] with with whatever you put the name to
[32:24] it that there's situations in lives, and
[32:26] you know what I'm talking about. You put
[32:28] a name to it. that the world says that's
[32:30] ridiculous.
[32:33] But God says no, it's wise. Yeah.
[32:37] Do you understand? Like we have to
[32:39] literally change the way we think about
[32:42] even our natural life. Says, well, you
[32:45] know, we we we we worked so hard in the
[32:47] message community for the last couple
[32:50] few decades to raise young men who have
[32:52] careers and and and the little white
[32:54] picket fence out front and they're
[32:56] taking care of their families. But
[32:59] there's no relationship
[33:02] between them and God. There's no
[33:03] relationship between them and their
[33:04] wife. There's no relationship between
[33:06] them and their children, but they're the
[33:08] perfect little message family.
[33:13] You see, we adopted what the world calls
[33:16] success. I'm not preaching against
[33:18] success. I'm not preaching against a
[33:19] good career. But you see, he said, "Put
[33:21] me first, and I will add all these
[33:25] things." Find what doesn't fit under the
[33:27] word all. Amen. Amen. I will add all
[33:32] these things. You see, when God is the
[33:35] foremost in your life, then when he
[33:36] comes to you, he says, "How far will you
[33:38] go?" You automatically say, "All the
[33:40] way. Where are we going?"
[33:43] But if our minds are stuck, as our
[33:45] perspective is stuck in this place of
[33:48] this is how we do it. This is the
[33:51] American dream.
[33:54] This is how we do it. And God asks you
[33:56] to get up and move somewhere and you
[33:58] won't budge because that's not smart.
[34:02] It takes temperance to sit when you want
[34:04] to go and temperance to go when you want
[34:06] to sit. He has not asked you to be of
[34:09] this world. He has asked you to step
[34:12] higher to be a child of the king to
[34:15] operate your business as your in your
[34:17] life. When I say business, I mean
[34:18] everything in your life, your economy of
[34:20] your home and your and yourself. He
[34:23] asked you to act to to conduct it in the
[34:25] kingly way.
[34:28] Not the king of England, not the king of
[34:31] India or they have parliament. There's
[34:33] not many kings anymore. But not to be
[34:34] the king of the earth, but operating in
[34:36] the way of the kingdom of God. Let me
[34:39] tell you, let me ask you this question.
[34:41] Is that what we're
[34:42] doing? Do we say, Lord, this is what the
[34:46] world says is a good business plan, but
[34:47] what are you asking me to do? Yes.
[34:49] Right. Lord, I have this plan here cuz
[34:53] he tells you to be diligent
[34:55] to plan your potatoes, right? Talks
[34:58] about that. So, you invest in that. But
[35:00] now you say, "Lord, here's what I have.
[35:02] What do you think?" And he comes down,
[35:04] he little his little red pen, and he
[35:06] says, "Nope. Nope. This is good. Edit
[35:09] this. Change this out." How many of you
[35:12] seen that? You can raise your hands.
[35:13] It's okay. How many of you seen that
[35:15] picture where it's a businessman sitting
[35:16] at a desk and he's got his glasses off
[35:18] and he's kind of relaxed and Jesus is
[35:20] sitting next to him giving him advice?
[35:23] You seen that? Anybody seen that? It's
[35:26] one of my favorite pictures because it
[35:29] realigns what we should be doing. You
[35:32] can tell he's like a high-rise in New
[35:33] York City, something like that. So, he's
[35:35] in a a successful businessman, but he's
[35:37] he's looking Jesus is there in his
[35:39] office telling him, "This is how you do
[35:41] it. This is what you do." Why? Because
[35:44] we are not looking for success under
[35:46] worldly terms. We are looking for how
[35:49] did we conduct the father's business.
[35:52] How did we live our lives to his will?
[35:56] And sometimes he asks us to do very very
[35:59] absurd things from a worldly view.
[36:04] And what I've
[36:06] seen because to bring this right down
[36:09] home is we will look at our brother and
[36:12] say that's
[36:14] ridiculous. Never stopping to ask wait a
[36:17] second is that contrary to the thing
[36:19] that matters.
[36:24] But we say that's not smart. And we find
[36:27] ourselves being persecuted by the person
[36:29] in the pew next to
[36:31] us simply because we have gotten so
[36:34] trained where here's church, here's
[36:39] business, here's church, here's my job,
[36:43] here's church, here's my career path,
[36:45] here's my
[36:47] trajectory. Brother Will Sanders is
[36:50] where is he at? Right here. right
[36:55] here. I can't see him. There he is. Got
[36:59] the little
[37:01] wave. He's He's doing some
[37:03] flying. What if What if God asks Will to
[37:06] learn to fly? And we say, "Okay, yep.
[37:08] He's going to learn to fly." And then
[37:09] he's going to go on. He's going to fly
[37:10] for United Airlines. And that's and the
[37:13] the world says, "Hey, you're going to
[37:14] learn to be a pilot. Here's what you got
[37:15] to do to be a pilot. You got to fly
[37:17] here. You got to go work for these
[37:18] people. Fly out. you know, got to go to
[37:20] Alaska and fly to the villages because
[37:21] you can build time and get paid for it
[37:23] and or you can go over here and just fly
[37:25] commuter planes and you work your hours
[37:27] and you build your hours up and then you
[37:29] can get a good job and then all this
[37:30] stuff and God comes along and says,
[37:32] "Cool, you learn how to fly. Go to the
[37:35] Amazon." The world says, "Whoa, hang on
[37:38] a second." And the message community
[37:40] says, "Oh, that's for denominations.
[37:42] That's not how we work."
[37:45] What about flying a plane in the jungle
[37:46] is against the word of God.
[37:49] This is a wild example. I know. I feel a
[37:52] little of you are like, "Well, where's
[37:53] this guy going with this?" Will's
[37:56] like there's a lot of creepy crawies in
[37:58] the
[37:59] jungle. But you see what I'm saying? We
[38:02] get so used to a certain perspective
[38:04] that when God comes knocking, we don't
[38:07] even hear him because there's no way in
[38:09] the world he would ask us to do that.
[38:14] So we have a lot of people singing that
[38:17] song. I shall not be I shall not be
[38:24] moved. We laugh. But you look at
[38:26] situations along around the globe,
[38:29] people desperate for help.
[38:33] Desperate for help. And you meet people
[38:35] who are capable and you talk to them,
[38:38] you realize they have no desire.
[38:41] They have no desire for souls. They have
[38:43] no desire for to to do what God wants.
[38:45] They have a desire for a career and to
[38:46] take care of their family.
[38:49] We have to change our perspective.
[38:52] There's a quote I I I don't I can't
[38:54] remember how exactly how it goes that I
[38:56] had in my office. Brother Brandham says
[38:58] basically he says, "Look, we're out of
[39:00] time. We've got to do all that we can
[39:02] right now. We got to do all that we can.
[39:05] We got to get out there and we got to do
[39:07] the thing that God is asking us to do
[39:09] because we don't have time." Look, are
[39:11] we trying to stay here?
[39:17] Every good message person says, "No,
[39:19] brother." But then Tuesday morning, how
[39:22] are you living? Are are you and I'm not
[39:25] talking
[39:27] about I'm not talking about sin. Look,
[39:31] I'm talking about a clean living person,
[39:33] right? with revelation, but revelation
[39:36] stops with their personal devotion and
[39:39] doesn't bleed into the rest of their
[39:40] life. Amen. That it's not revelation
[39:43] actually because if it was revelation,
[39:44] it would bleed into the rest of your
[39:45] life. It's in your head. So, you
[39:49] compartmentalize it. You know, guys love
[39:51] that, right? Compartments. You know,
[39:52] this is this and this is this over here
[39:54] and there's doors through there. But,
[39:56] you know, just logically bulleted lists
[39:59] and and everything like that and
[40:00] organized in spreadsheets and and so,
[40:02] you know, here's a devotion spreadsheet
[40:04] and serving God spreadsheet and here's
[40:05] the work spreadsheet.
[40:08] But when you adjust when you adjust in
[40:12] Excel, you can adjust things and and
[40:15] then it recalculates. When you adjust
[40:17] spiritually, it should recalculate your
[40:18] business spreadsheet. Amen. And when you
[40:21] try to adjust your business spreadsheet
[40:23] outside of the calculations of your
[40:24] spiritual one, it should error out.
[40:27] Amen. So that doesn't work.
[40:30] People talk about, well, this job over
[40:31] here, and it's always first question, is
[40:33] there a church? Well, you know
[40:36] what?
[40:38] That's an extreme example. But then
[40:40] bleed it on down to to you and I sitting
[40:43] here this morning, standing here this
[40:44] morning, saying, "What is God asking us
[40:47] to do? That's right. We're too busy
[40:50] thinking about how little meal we have
[40:53] and the two sticks we're picking up to
[40:55] even hear the prophet say, "Go make me a
[40:57] cake." See, even hear the word say,
[41:00] "Bring me the meal offering." Says,
[41:02] "Christ was the type of the meal
[41:04] offering. Surrender to me." The Lord
[41:08] asks, "How far will you go?" But this
[41:12] young woman is in the place where where
[41:14] and this is the this is the fantastic
[41:16] thing about being a true child of God.
[41:18] Cuz try as hard as you might, brother
[41:20] Jack. There's a higher calling. Try as
[41:23] hard as you might. The Lord says you
[41:26] fall flat on your face every time. Amen.
[41:29] Because God says, "No, you're my child."
[41:32] So here she is. and she's got to the
[41:34] point where she wants to change so
[41:37] bad. She's willing to go all the way.
[41:41] And God presses us into those positions.
[41:44] He presses us into those places where
[41:46] something shifts in our thinking. And we
[41:49] say, "Wait a second. Wait a second. This
[41:51] happened to us the other day. I was
[41:52] laying there and I was just, Lord, this,
[41:54] this, and this, and all these things,
[41:56] and when is it going to work out? How is
[41:57] it going to work out? I feel like I'm
[41:58] just sitting in limbo." Purgatory is not
[42:01] a message doctrine.
[42:03] I'm just sitting here. Lord, what's the
[42:05] answer? What do you want us? You know, I
[42:06] know what you want us to do, but how do
[42:08] we get there? What what's what's going
[42:10] on? The Lord just spoke to my heart. He
[42:12] says, how far will you
[42:15] go? Will you go to the last meal
[42:17] offering? Will you go to the last
[42:19] possible second?
[42:22] You know, you can stand on the edge and
[42:25] you can teeter quite a ways out before
[42:28] you actually have given over to gravity.
[42:31] He might ask you to go all the way to
[42:33] that point and he just grabs you and
[42:35] says, "All right, here you go. This is
[42:39] what I want you to do." Cuz now he knows
[42:41] he can trust you. Not 3/4 of the way.
[42:46] Not half the way. Half the way is pretty
[42:48] good. There's a lot of people that are
[42:50] halfway. N7 is pretty good.
[42:54] But he's asking for a whole. He's asking
[42:58] for the whole thing. Because then when
[43:01] he knows you'll give the whole thing,
[43:05] he'll give you the whole thing.
[43:10] So verse 38, and and stood at his feet
[43:14] behind him weeping and began to wash his
[43:16] feet with tears and did wipe them with
[43:18] the hairs of her head and kissed his
[43:20] feet and anointed them with ointment.
[43:23] presence of God unrecognized. What is
[43:25] the woman's beauty and honor is her
[43:27] hair. That's the reason many of you
[43:29] women today cut it all off. That's
[43:32] wrong. She took her hair and began to
[43:34] wash his feet and wipe them her pretty
[43:36] hair, taking the stink off of him upon
[43:40] herself, bearing his reproach. You say,
[43:43] "Well, I don't cut my
[43:45] hair." The man brings us the story of
[43:47] Samson. And he says, Samson was overcome
[43:50] by the church system.
[43:52] What did what was what did Samson have
[43:54] to do for his strength? Keep his hair
[43:56] long.
[43:57] So this is a spiritual this is a natural
[44:00] sign. This is a spiritual sign to you
[44:02] and I us
[44:03] brothers and sisters even with long
[44:06] hair. Keep yourself submitted to the
[44:09] headship of Christ, not the headship of
[44:11] the church system. Because as soon as
[44:13] you identify with the church system,
[44:15] your hair is cut off and you lose your
[44:17] power. Amen. Amen. So he's
[44:21] saying you can't even sit at the feet of
[44:25] Jesus with the hair, which is your your
[44:28] the the the the your honor, your your
[44:30] your who you are, your identity as the
[44:32] as a member of the bride. You can't even
[44:34] do that unless your hair is long, unless
[44:38] you're submitted to Christ. And that's
[44:40] the problem. You will never get through
[44:42] the door into the home of the Pharisee
[44:45] to kneel at the feet of Jesus as long as
[44:47] you are aligned with a church system.
[44:52] Amen. That's good. You have a wonderful
[44:55] ministry here, wonderful pastor, and you
[44:57] can be sitting here underneath this
[44:59] ministry and be a denomination unto
[45:01] yourself.
[45:03] Because you have identified with a set
[45:05] of rules.
[45:07] This is how we do it. And never ask
[45:11] yourself, where's the relationship?
[45:19] Or if it is, sometimes we need a
[45:21] reminder, a little, "Hey, wake up. Job.
[45:26] Job was a righteous
[45:27] man. God comes and says, "Job, get up.
[45:32] Stop it. Stand up. I got something to
[45:35] say to you." So maybe maybe you're the
[45:39] job and and you know that's how I was
[45:42] right. I was there in that
[45:44] place and Lord's like knock it off.
[45:48] Stand up. I got something I want to say
[45:49] to you.
[45:51] Who are you compared to my glory?
[45:55] What can I not do? You are but a man.
[45:58] Did you create the I love it how he lays
[46:01] it out. as you create the horse who
[46:02] rides into battle stands and he and he
[46:06] fights there and he's a mighty steed and
[46:08] you can go back and read it. I'm I'm
[46:09] butchering it but he just paints this
[46:10] picture of this waror that's just going
[46:12] into battle. He said did you create him
[46:14] to be like that? He says I did. So what
[46:18] is the
[46:19] problem? He's asked Job to go all the
[46:22] way. He says Job how far will you go?
[46:25] And then he's just what? He just sat
[46:28] there and these free three friends come
[46:31] to him and just tear him up. You know
[46:33] when a brother falls in battle battle
[46:35] kick him more.
[46:38] That's the tune they were singing to.
[46:39] And then finally Elihoo comes and God
[46:43] begins to minister to him preparing him
[46:47] for an audience with the king. Amen. See
[46:50] the Lord the Holy Spirit comes begins to
[46:52] prepare you. You're Job. You're there.
[46:54] You're like, "Wow, how far can I go?"
[46:56] God says, "Keep going. Keep going. And
[46:58] keep going." Doesn't answer you. His
[47:00] answer is a little a little further.
[47:05] His answer is a little further.
[47:15] Okay. He says, "That old Simon standing
[47:17] back there said, "Huh? Oh, I can just
[47:20] see him blow up." He didn't recognize
[47:22] who he was. said, "I told you he wasn't
[47:24] a prophet. If he was a prophet, he would
[47:26] recognize what kind of a woman that is
[47:28] around him." Jesus never moved a foot.
[47:31] He just watched her, and she was
[47:34] scared. Then the Pharisees which had
[47:36] bidden to him saw it, and he spake
[47:38] within himself, saying, "This man, if he
[47:39] were a prophet, would have known who and
[47:42] what manner of woman this is that
[47:44] touchth him, for she is a sinner." And
[47:46] Jesus answering, said unto him, Simon, I
[47:48] have somewhat to say unto thee. Then he
[47:50] saith, Master, say on. There was a
[47:52] certain creditor which had two debtors.
[47:54] One owed 500 p and the other 50. They
[47:58] had nothing to pay and frankly he
[47:59] forgave them both. Tell me therefore who
[48:02] will love him more. Simon answered said
[48:04] I suppose it be he that he forgave the
[48:06] most. He says that's right. Thou hast
[48:09] rightly judged. And he turned to the
[48:11] woman and said unto Simon, Seeest thou
[48:13] this woman. I entered into thine house.
[48:15] Thou gavest me no water for my feet, but
[48:17] she hath washed my feet with tears and
[48:20] wiped them with the hairs of her
[48:23] head. Do you know I tried to get a
[48:26] picture and I just couldn't find one
[48:28] that was worthy of it. But do you know
[48:29] how dirty and nasty their feet got?
[48:32] They're in
[48:34] sandals, not walking on asphalt.
[48:37] You know, pretty little country asphalt
[48:39] thing. You know, I always crack up about
[48:41] that. It's like we're going to go on a
[48:41] nature walk and it's got asphalt or
[48:44] pavement. No, they were walking through
[48:46] the
[48:47] dust. The same trail that the donkeys
[48:50] and the horses and everything
[48:52] right there trapping. And you know, you
[48:55] can't avoid it after a while. Just all
[48:57] mixes together. Stink. I mean, you can't
[49:00] imagine it. It's hot. It's humid.
[49:02] There's sweat. Well, maybe not humid cuz
[49:03] it's kind of the desert, but I'm sure
[49:05] there was. Anyways, the feet were
[49:07] really, really gross. Really, really
[49:10] dirty. How many of you sisters, you
[49:11] know, you you keep the hair up, right?
[49:13] You go to wash the gross dishes, you put
[49:15] it up, right? You keep it out of the
[49:17] nasty water. You keep it you keep it
[49:19] clean. It's your honor. It's your glory
[49:21] or take good care of it as you should.
[49:22] And here is this woman willing to
[49:24] surrender everything cuz she was a
[49:26] prostitute. So looking good was good for
[49:28] business. She was willing to
[49:31] surrender all of that and say, "I'm
[49:33] going to, you know, it might damage my
[49:34] hair. It might, you know, whatever it
[49:37] be." And she was willing to do all that
[49:40] at the feet of Jesus and wipe that stuff
[49:42] with her hair and kiss his feet. Amen.
[49:47] How far will you go? You say, "Oh,
[49:50] brother, I'll wash, you know, I'll get a
[49:54] I'll get some paper towels and I'll wash
[49:57] the feet." And everyone, you know, we
[49:58] say, "Oh, wow. Praise the Lord. That
[50:00] brother's washing the feet of Jesus."
[50:02] Jesus is looking and saying, "I ask you
[50:04] to go all the way."
[50:06] You see how far you go and then you
[50:08] don't go all the way, you might as well
[50:09] have not gone at all.
[50:13] The point is total surrender.
[50:16] Total
[50:19] surrender. Saints of God ch I mean take
[50:21] it back to your
[50:23] studies. See where it doesn't
[50:25] fit. Where God is always asking us how
[50:28] far will we
[50:30] go? But instead of going at how far he
[50:33] asks
[50:34] us, we go how far we think we should go.
[50:39] And we lean to our own
[50:41] understandings. God is asking for a
[50:43] mature bride to be willing to do
[50:46] anything he asks him to do, asks us to
[50:49] do when he asks us to do it. What was
[50:54] the what was the perfect thing about
[50:56] Jesus? He did only the perfect will of
[50:59] the father. Amen.
[51:02] We are to walk in. Think about this. The
[51:05] gospel is a story of Jesus. He's calling
[51:07] us to walk the same path because he has
[51:10] a ministry in the
[51:13] bride. So does does God just hatch a new
[51:16] plan? But R says no. He's the same
[51:18] yesterday, today, and forever. So you
[51:22] will have to crucify. Be crucified. Not
[51:25] naturally, maybe emotionally,
[51:28] spiritually. You have to walk that same
[51:31] path. So then you have to be willing to
[51:34] walk into the pool of Bethesda and touch
[51:38] one person.
[51:41] Now I don't mean actually touch a person
[51:43] and heal them. I mean that harness and
[51:45] the world looks on and says you're a
[51:47] jerk. Right. Right. The person in the
[51:50] pew next to you looks at you and says
[51:54] you what do you even know? What are you
[51:56] doing?
[51:59] And you ask them says,
[52:02] "Well, show me in the scriptures where
[52:04] this is wrong.
[52:06] What could he do? What could he have
[52:08] done with Samson?" You say, "Oh, praise
[52:10] God, Samson." You know, he sacrificed
[52:12] his life. His hair began to grow. All
[52:14] those Philistines were killed. But what
[52:16] could God have done with Samson if from
[52:19] the beginning he gave him his heart?
[52:22] Amen.
[52:24] Think about that. What could have
[52:26] happened? So then what could God do with
[52:29] you in in just a couple of months being
[52:32] completely sold out to him versus 20
[52:35] years of just a little bit here and
[52:37] there? Samson judged Israel for 20
[52:40] years. He had a lot of good battles, a
[52:42] lot of good victories, but just a little
[52:44] bit here and a little bit there. Yeah.
[52:48] What could God do with your life? What
[52:50] could God do with this church?
[52:53] Says, "Oh, well, we've got a it's nice.
[52:55] We've got the and this building is
[52:57] amazing. You've got this here. What can
[52:59] you do now? You got to brother Blake
[53:02] said it's so I I just like that. He said
[53:04] a comfortable place to worship you.
[53:05] Think about that. You don't have to
[53:07] worry about natural hindrances while
[53:09] you're sitting here. What could God then
[53:11] take you out there and do with you? If
[53:14] you said if he says how far will you go
[53:17] and you were willing to say all the way
[53:19] to Japan
[53:21] where sushi is not sushi.
[53:25] how far will you go? And we think about,
[53:27] wow, yes, you
[53:30] know, those brothers are in Japan, man.
[53:34] And the young guys are like, "That's a
[53:37] missionary." But he asked you to go to
[53:39] downtown Cleveland.
[53:42] Or or he asked you to go to go with
[53:44] those with those, you
[53:47] know, you wonder sometimes, should I use
[53:50] this example or should I not to that
[53:52] church that's just a little
[53:54] weird? Well, you're going to leave them.
[53:56] They might not even
[53:58] know. What are what are they going to
[54:00] hear? You might be the vessel. God uses.
[54:04] Now, it's got to be God. But I think we
[54:08] I think I think we can be mature enough
[54:09] to understand that. You don't have to
[54:11] put that little footnote in there,
[54:12] right? It's got to be God. Amen. I'm not
[54:15] I'm not working on we're not working
[54:17] this morning on the folks who say, "Oh,
[54:18] the Lord led me." And it's just no,
[54:21] definitely not. That's not the way to
[54:23] go. That's not the you know, you leave
[54:24] them alone. But now says, "Well, maybe
[54:26] that God says this way." He says, "Maybe
[54:28] God told them, but they didn't hear and
[54:29] act correctly the way he said it
[54:31] perfectly." I'm not talking about that.
[54:33] I'm talking about those individuals who
[54:34] just won't budge. You just you just you
[54:36] got your happy, comfy life and you don't
[54:37] want to do anything about it. You just
[54:40] want to stay there. And God's saying,
[54:41] "I've got so much I want you to do, but
[54:45] you've got to be willing to go all the
[54:46] way, will all the way to
[54:52] Amazon, all the way to, you know, he'd
[54:55] rather go to Alaska. So that's why I
[54:57] picked
[54:59] Amazon, right? all the way to wherever
[55:02] it
[55:03] is. Not for your own glory. Look, you
[55:07] got to be okay to do it and nobody ever
[55:09] know you did it because your focus and
[55:13] your whole point you do it is for Jesus
[55:16] Christ. That's who he's looking for.
[55:19] John says there's not I think it was
[55:20] John said there's not enough room to
[55:22] write all the things Jesus did. Yeah.
[55:25] So, there was miracles and events and
[55:28] supernatural things that happened and
[55:30] sermons that Jesus preached that we will
[55:32] never read in the book. Yeah. And that
[55:37] was all right. He only put in there what
[55:39] you needed to hear. You don't got to go
[55:41] dig up some Greek manuscript or some
[55:43] ancient stone in the desert. All you got
[55:46] to do is read what he gave you.
[55:48] You have everything that you need. All
[55:51] you have to do is be willing to go all
[55:52] the way all the way in in the word. Now
[55:54] we're talking. Let's bring it down to
[55:56] Revelation. God begins to open things up
[55:58] in the word. But you say, "That's not
[56:00] how we've preached it. That's not the
[56:03] way this brother sees it or that brother
[56:05] sees it or this pastor preaches it.
[56:07] That's not the way it is. This is the
[56:09] accepted to explanation of the doctrine
[56:12] in the message community. Don't go
[56:15] outside of it." And God says, "How far
[56:18] will you go?"
[56:21] Amen. How ridiculous are you willing to
[56:24] look?
[56:27] Matthew chapter
[56:30] 16. Matthew chapter
[56:37] 16. We're getting
[56:42] close. Don't get weary on me.
[56:46] Matthew chapter 16 verse one.
[56:55] The Pharisees also with the Sadducees
[56:57] came and tempting desired him that he
[57:00] would show them a sign from heaven. He
[57:02] answered and said unto them, "When it is
[57:05] evening, ye say it will be fair weather,
[57:07] for the sky is red. And in the morning
[57:09] it will be foul weather today, for the
[57:11] sky is red and lowering." Oh, you
[57:14] hypocrites. You can discern the face of
[57:16] the sky, but can you not discern the
[57:18] signs of the times? A wicked and
[57:20] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[57:22] sign, and there shall no sign be given
[57:24] unto it, but the sign of the prophet
[57:27] Jonas. Excuse me, my throat's dry
[57:35] today. And he left them and departed.
[57:38] And when his disciples were come to the
[57:41] other side, they had forgotten to take
[57:43] bread. Then Jesus said unto them, "Take
[57:45] heed and beware of the leavenven of the
[57:48] Pharisees and the Sadducees." And they
[57:50] reasoned among themselves, saying, "It
[57:52] is because we have taken no bread."
[57:54] Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto
[57:56] them, "Oh ye of little faith, why reason
[57:59] you among yourselves, because you have
[58:00] brought no
[58:02] bread? Do you not yet understand?
[58:04] Neither remember the five loaves of the
[58:07] 5,000 and how many baskets you took up.
[58:10] neither the seven loaves of the 4,000
[58:12] and how many baskets you took up. How is
[58:14] it that ye did not understand that I
[58:16] spake it not to you concerning bread
[58:19] that you should beware of the leavenven
[58:21] of the Pharisees and the Sadducees? Then
[58:23] understood they how that he bade them
[58:26] not beware of the leavenven of bread but
[58:28] of the doctrine of the Pharisees and the
[58:31] Sadducees. There's quite a lot happening
[58:33] here. The disciples have been following
[58:36] Jesus and they've been asked, you know,
[58:38] where will you go? And he says, Peter
[58:40] says, well, there's where else can we
[58:41] go? This is all we
[58:43] have. And now there's they're so they're
[58:47] so they're so indoctrinated in the
[58:50] Jewish doctrine, the Jewish tradition of
[58:53] worship that when he starts talking
[58:55] about bread, they immediately go to the
[58:57] doctrine of
[58:59] leaven. And I say, well, you know, I
[59:02] guess, you know, it's the bread. And
[59:04] he's like, "Hello, I'm talking about the
[59:07] doctrine of the Pharisees and the
[59:09] Sadducees." You see what happening? God
[59:12] was trying to open their eyes to
[59:13] something, but because of what they
[59:15] thought they knew, they missed it the
[59:17] first time.
[59:18] Amen. Say, "Oh, yeah." You
[59:21] know, maybe you're sitting here today
[59:24] say, "Well, brother, I've heard this
[59:27] before, so this is for somebody else."
[59:30] Last I checked, the word of God is a
[59:32] living, breathing
[59:35] substance, sir. And you'll hear it
[59:39] differently based on your current
[59:41] position and perspective. So he shut
[59:44] down. He said, "Well, yep, the 11. Yep.
[59:46] The doctor 11. Yep. That's what he's
[59:47] talking about." John's like, "Yeah, I
[59:49] got that figured out." Peter and the
[59:51] Lord is like, "No, I'm not talking about
[59:52] bread. I'm talking about the doctrine of
[59:54] the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
[59:57] 1 Corinthians
[1:00:01] 1. 1 Corinthians
[1:00:04] 1 verse
[1:00:07] 18. For the preaching of the cross is to
[1:00:10] them that perish foolishness, but unto
[1:00:12] us which are saved, it is the power of
[1:00:14] God. Now, I want you to remember here,
[1:00:17] Paul just a few years after the death of
[1:00:19] Christ, the preaching of the cross is a
[1:00:22] new term.
[1:00:25] It's been so abused for the last couple
[1:00:27] thousand years and everything. We read
[1:00:29] and we just gloss over that. But you
[1:00:31] have to understand, put yourself in
[1:00:33] Paul's position. He's now telling people
[1:00:35] that guy that hung on the cross, the one
[1:00:38] guy out of the thousands that the Romans
[1:00:40] hung on a cross, he rose up again and
[1:00:42] now it's the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:00:46] And you're thinking, people receive
[1:00:49] that. I saw brother brother brother
[1:00:51] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:00:51] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:00:51] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:00:51] brother brother brother brother Jeremy I
[1:00:51] was thinking about this the other day
[1:00:53] and I was just like thinking about that
[1:00:54] I think I have it here where Peter and
[1:00:56] John are before the the the religious
[1:00:58] leaders of the time and and I'm thinking
[1:01:00] they're telling they're standing there
[1:01:02] telling these these men look the guy you
[1:01:04] crucified he rose again and you didn't
[1:01:08] see him we we saw him though and and
[1:01:10] he's he now then we he ascended on high
[1:01:13] and we went in a little room and and
[1:01:15] after a few days we received the Holy
[1:01:18] Spirit and now everything's changed.
[1:01:21] Everything has
[1:01:23] changed. And you're thinking, I've heard
[1:01:26] people give, you know, talks on like,
[1:01:28] you know, just the aliens and all this
[1:01:30] weird stuff and everyone just kind of
[1:01:31] rolls their eyes or they're like, whoa,
[1:01:34] you know, and they just get all weird,
[1:01:35] you know, and people are convinced they
[1:01:37] saw the Yeti and all this stuff. And I'm
[1:01:39] thinking, how come that just, you know,
[1:01:40] kind of sort of just in the backdrops of
[1:01:42] of society? But yet, when these people
[1:01:45] are talking about something this crazy
[1:01:48] Yeah. Y it it it it they had the
[1:01:51] confidence for one to say what they said
[1:01:54] and for two of the Pharisees get
[1:01:57] mad. The Lord spoke to my heart says
[1:01:59] because it's truth. Amen. Right? So you
[1:02:03] think well how am I going to you know
[1:02:05] talk to them about the prophet maybe
[1:02:06] I'll wait on that. Look the prophet is
[1:02:08] the reason we have present truth. So
[1:02:10] let's not waste their time. Let's not
[1:02:12] waste our time. And you tell them. You
[1:02:14] think but it's weird. It's crazy. This
[1:02:16] is maybe mostly my generation and
[1:02:18] younger. I don't know. Some of you old
[1:02:19] people are thinking, "Well, that's why
[1:02:20] is that weird, you know?" Um, but for us
[1:02:23] young people, younger people and and
[1:02:24] younger people, um, you think about
[1:02:27] talking about a prophet and you're just
[1:02:28] like, "That feels maybe that feels
[1:02:30] weird, but you have to realize it'll
[1:02:32] have an effect because it's true."
[1:02:36] And the truth shall set you free. Amen.
[1:02:39] So, a child of God hears that, they
[1:02:41] don't even battle eyes. Oh, yeah.
[1:02:42] Prophet, of course. You're like, "Well,
[1:02:44] wow, they received that." Well, because
[1:02:46] it's truth. or they think you're crazy,
[1:02:48] they walk away. Whatever. It's fine.
[1:02:51] You're there speaking truth. Never
[1:02:53] forget that. Never forget that you're
[1:02:55] there speaking truth. So now he's
[1:02:57] dealing with it. He says, "Hey, this the
[1:02:58] this is the the power the preaching of
[1:03:01] the cross is to them that perish
[1:03:03] foolishness." So he's saying they're
[1:03:05] calling this crazy. They're calling this
[1:03:06] foolish, but they can't get away from
[1:03:08] it, right? And they're fighting him.
[1:03:09] They're trying to quiet them down. And
[1:03:11] Paul was one of those, right? Paul was
[1:03:14] the he was the he was the c he was the
[1:03:16] poster child for the let's get rid of
[1:03:18] the Christians campaign
[1:03:23] you know he was it was Paul for 2028
[1:03:26] right that's what it or Saul for 2028
[1:03:29] that's what it was he was the
[1:03:31] man and the Lord finally has to break
[1:03:34] him down and there's his his own
[1:03:35] testimony there he says for it is
[1:03:37] written I will destroy the wisdom of the
[1:03:39] wise and will bring to nothing the
[1:03:41] understanding of the prudent
[1:03:44] So these are these are good smart
[1:03:47] people. These are people who have have
[1:03:48] knowledge and this wisdom but but it's
[1:03:50] not the wisdom of God. It's not the
[1:03:52] knowledge of the revelation of God.
[1:03:54] Amen. It's not the word. It's not truth.
[1:03:58] So he has to dismantle that. He says
[1:04:01] where is the wise? Where is the scribe?
[1:04:03] Where is the disputer of this world?
[1:04:05] Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of
[1:04:08] this world?
[1:04:11] He's not talking about crazy ideas of
[1:04:14] aliens and yeti and stuff like that.
[1:04:16] He's talking about the wisdom. The
[1:04:18] people you look at say they got it
[1:04:20] together. The way they approach life,
[1:04:23] they've got it together. The way that
[1:04:24] brother approaches serving God, man,
[1:04:26] that's that's it right there. Yet God's
[1:04:29] been asking him for 10 years, please,
[1:04:30] not please, asking him for 10 years, do
[1:04:32] this. And he says, how could that be
[1:04:34] God? It's too
[1:04:37] crazy. For after that, in the wisdom of
[1:04:40] God, the world by wisdom knew not God.
[1:04:42] It pleased God by the foolishness of
[1:04:44] preaching to save them that believe.
[1:04:47] Amen.
[1:04:49] The foolishness of preaching.
[1:04:53] The foolishness of preaching. Don't
[1:04:54] forget
[1:04:56] that. We're all in this together.
[1:05:00] We're all in this
[1:05:02] together. For the Jews require a sign,
[1:05:05] and the Greeks seek after wisdom. Boom.
[1:05:07] right there. Both sides of the road,
[1:05:09] Pentecostals, legalists,
[1:05:12] the same spirit was working all the way
[1:05:15] back there in the E in the Ephesian
[1:05:17] church age. Amen. And it's the same
[1:05:19] thing today. The Jews a sign. The Greeks
[1:05:22] seek after wisdom. But we preach Christ
[1:05:27] crucified. We preach Christ crucified.
[1:05:30] So, they're preaching the the gospel,
[1:05:32] the revelation that God came and
[1:05:35] something changed.
[1:05:38] Please tell me you're with me. Amen. God
[1:05:41] came and something changed.
[1:05:44] The world shifted. History shifted. I
[1:05:48] mean, we don't even count time the same
[1:05:49] anymore. It's BC, then it's 80. It
[1:05:52] shifted.
[1:05:54] Even history itself put a mark.
[1:05:58] Amen.
[1:06:02] He says unto the Jews, this is a
[1:06:05] stumbling block.
[1:06:07] Thinking Jews for centuries, for
[1:06:10] centuries, who have been the the the
[1:06:12] elite religious group of the world, the
[1:06:16] only ones who are following Jehovah in
[1:06:19] that
[1:06:19] capacity. Yet Christ being crucified,
[1:06:24] it's too much for them to handle.
[1:06:28] They were the
[1:06:30] church. They were the church. God is
[1:06:34] calling a bride out of the church, not
[1:06:37] the
[1:06:37] denomination. Out of the church system.
[1:06:41] And we can adopt that church system
[1:06:42] anywhere you want. I mean, message
[1:06:43] community, right? It's there. It's
[1:06:45] prevalent. He's calling you out. So
[1:06:47] therefore, there's going to be something
[1:06:49] that is preached, something that is that
[1:06:51] that is that is fed from the scriptures
[1:06:54] that is a stumbling block to the church,
[1:06:58] to the Jews, and unto the Greeks,
[1:07:01] foolishness. So under the legalistics,
[1:07:03] like that's foolishness. That's not deep
[1:07:06] enough. That's not there's not enough
[1:07:07] rules there. We we we can't we can't
[1:07:10] handle that. It's too d it's too
[1:07:12] dynamic. I'm not talking about emotions.
[1:07:16] The word is fluid. It is a moving,
[1:07:19] breathing substance. Amen. God asks us
[1:07:23] to get up and do stuff sometimes. Get up
[1:07:25] and go there. Do this. Think about the
[1:07:27] book of Acts. Yeah. Right. Hey, but it
[1:07:29] says we're in a book of Acts again.
[1:07:31] Yeah.
[1:07:33] What are we doing?
[1:07:36] We're just building barnaminiums.
[1:07:38] Nothing against those. I'm trying to
[1:07:39] build one,
[1:07:40] too. But we're just we're if we get
[1:07:43] focused on that. You understand what I'm
[1:07:44] saying? If you get focused on that.
[1:07:47] Okay. Are we doing all right? Amen. All
[1:07:49] right. All right. We're just
[1:07:52] we're just fighting the devil today.
[1:07:54] Okay. So now, but a for after that in
[1:07:57] the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom.
[1:07:58] Okay. We were past that part. 24. But
[1:08:00] unto them which are called both Jews and
[1:08:02] Greeks. Oh, so they're not
[1:08:06] excluded. Absolutely not. We all got
[1:08:09] that Jew in us.
[1:08:11] you know, says, "Well, I can get a
[1:08:13] better deal at
[1:08:15] Target." Well, you want five bucks, I'll
[1:08:18] give you
[1:08:19] 250. We all got that Greek in us, right?
[1:08:22] Try to philosophically explain the
[1:08:24] scriptures. And we It just comes out a
[1:08:27] little weird. And people look at you and
[1:08:28] go and you're like, "Man, that kind of
[1:08:30] felt funny." And the Lord's like, "Nope,
[1:08:32] that's the Greek in you." Amen.
[1:08:36] But but unto them which are called both
[1:08:39] Jew and Greeks, Christ the power of God
[1:08:42] and the wisdom of God.
[1:08:45] So he just said Christ the power of God
[1:08:48] which could be signs and supernaturals
[1:08:51] and those kind of things. And he said
[1:08:53] the wisdom of God. Amen. So the devil
[1:08:56] can't create. So there's a little bit of
[1:08:58] truth on either side. Amen. But the the
[1:09:01] the thing to do is bring it into the
[1:09:02] middle into the balance, the balance of
[1:09:05] the scriptures. Amen. Of the word, not
[1:09:08] your balance, God's balance. So because
[1:09:11] the foolishness of God is wiser than
[1:09:13] men, and the weakness of God is stronger
[1:09:16] than men. For you see, you're calling,
[1:09:18] brethren, okay, see if I want to read
[1:09:20] down the rest of this. He's chosen the
[1:09:22] foolish things of the world to confound
[1:09:24] the wise.
[1:09:26] the base things of the world and things
[1:09:28] which are despised hath God
[1:09:31] chosen. So you you you can't approach
[1:09:33] this with the the same mindset. Your
[1:09:35] perspective has to change. God has to do
[1:09:37] something and change the way you think.
[1:09:40] Which is what Paul said. Take on the
[1:09:41] mind of Christ. Change the way you think
[1:09:44] about things. Change your perspective.
[1:09:46] Say, "Wait a second, Lord. What are you
[1:09:48] asking me to do? Is this what you want
[1:09:50] me to do?" He says, "Yep, keep going."
[1:09:53] You say, "Well, I need an answer here."
[1:09:55] He says, "Keep going. Keep going. Go a
[1:09:59] little further. Run out of oil. Run out
[1:10:01] of meal cuz I have a plan in place for
[1:10:07] you." In Christ is the mystery of God
[1:10:13] revealed. Let me see
[1:10:21] here. Can we Can we Can we pray for a
[1:10:23] second? Let's all bow our heads.
[1:10:25] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we're here
[1:10:27] this morning not to make a
[1:10:30] show, not to to be to be funny. We're
[1:10:35] here because you've given us your word.
[1:10:38] Lord, the only goal that we
[1:10:40] have is that you would have the liberty
[1:10:43] to speak to us. That you would have the
[1:10:46] liberty to direct the minister. That you
[1:10:49] would have the liberty to direct the
[1:10:50] heart of your people. that, Father, they
[1:10:53] could break free, Lord. Break free from
[1:10:55] what they think and their ideas and and
[1:10:57] and break into a a a space, Lord, where
[1:11:00] it's you and it's them and that's it.
[1:11:03] That's all that matters. Pray you'd come
[1:11:06] now, Lord, with your presence, Lord
[1:11:08] Jesus. Push back, Father, that
[1:11:10] resistance, Lord, that that you're
[1:11:12] trying to get something across to us,
[1:11:15] but we're stuck in our humanity. Forgive
[1:11:17] us, Lord. forgive us and help us to step
[1:11:20] forward into what you have for us that
[1:11:22] Lord we could live in a higher plane in
[1:11:25] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:11:29] In Christ is the mystery of God
[1:11:31] revealed. He says take the 22nd Psalm
[1:11:33] and sing it and compare it with the
[1:11:34] morning of the crucifixion. See my God,
[1:11:37] my God, why hast thou forsaken me? All
[1:11:39] my bones they stare at me. They pierced
[1:11:41] my feet and my hands. Yet all those
[1:11:44] things there, them singing that psalm
[1:11:47] down there in the temple and crucifying
[1:11:49] the very one. See those great religious
[1:11:52] leaders, those great men, those great
[1:11:54] teachers, yet so blinded that that was
[1:11:58] reading the prophets and was singing the
[1:12:00] songs and doing the crime they said they
[1:12:01] would do. So now you have the Pharisees
[1:12:03] and the Sadducees are down there in the
[1:12:05] temple while Jesus is up there dying on
[1:12:08] the cross singing the pro prophecy of
[1:12:12] the transition of time.
[1:12:14] The Pharisees and the Sadducees were the
[1:12:17] message church.
[1:12:21] Then something changed. Now you could
[1:12:23] take the same example and say it was
[1:12:25] denominations and God called them out.
[1:12:27] Absolutely. It doesn't matter. You put a
[1:12:30] name to it. You can put Methodist, you
[1:12:31] have Baptist, you can put message
[1:12:33] community to it. It does not matter. It
[1:12:34] is the anointing of the church system.
[1:12:38] So the church system is singing the
[1:12:41] psalm 22
[1:12:44] while crucifying the truth they've been
[1:12:46] given.
[1:12:48] And if you're not careful, you will find
[1:12:50] yourself in the same position because
[1:12:51] there's no way that what that is being
[1:12:54] said is truth. It's too absurd. And you
[1:12:57] are judging it based on the Pharisees
[1:12:59] ministry,
[1:13:01] not on the revelation of the pure,
[1:13:03] unadulterated, infallible word of God.
[1:13:06] You are saying that's not how I've heard
[1:13:08] it. So therefore, it is false. That is
[1:13:10] what Paul and Peter and John and the 120
[1:13:13] had to fight against. They didn't have
[1:13:15] to fight so much with the Greeks and the
[1:13:17] barbarians of the world. They had to
[1:13:19] deal with the Jews.
[1:13:22] Today in the message community, in the
[1:13:24] church system, we are dealing with Jews.
[1:13:26] Let's just call it what it is, saints.
[1:13:28] We are dealing with the Jews of
[1:13:30] ourselves. Don't point to the brother
[1:13:32] next to you. Point to yourself. The Jew
[1:13:33] within yourself says, "But this is how
[1:13:35] we do it. This is how we have a good
[1:13:38] service. This is this is what this
[1:13:40] means." Why?
[1:13:44] Why? Because that's how I've always been
[1:13:46] taught. Never once stopping and saying,
[1:13:49] "God, is this right?" That's all I'm
[1:13:52] ask. That's all the Lord is asking you
[1:13:54] to do. say, look to him and say,
[1:13:55] "Father, have I been thinking about this
[1:13:57] wrong all along?" Amen.
[1:14:00] Thanks, saints. We've got to get out of
[1:14:02] here. We've got a rapture to get to to
[1:14:04] to take us out. And it's a faith. It's a
[1:14:08] revelation.
[1:14:10] So, how are you going to come to the
[1:14:12] revelation of the rapture? Have you made
[1:14:14] it yet?
[1:14:16] So, then what do you need?
[1:14:19] What do you need? Sometimes I believe
[1:14:22] that personal opinion, brother Chris
[1:14:24] takes personal opinion. I believe right
[1:14:26] now it's the undoing of the doctrine of
[1:14:28] the Jews. Amen. Not the Jews over there
[1:14:30] in Israel. Not the Jews of the
[1:14:32] scriptures. The Jews of the message of
[1:14:34] ourselves,
[1:14:36] our own Jews. Stop looking at the church
[1:14:38] next door or your person, the brother
[1:14:39] next to you, or stop thinking of
[1:14:41] somebody. If you're thinking of
[1:14:42] somebody, somebody's thinking about you.
[1:14:45] and look within and say, "Lord, identify
[1:14:48] the Jew within me that has received
[1:14:51] these things and is so encrusted in this
[1:14:53] doctrine that he's now commanding the
[1:14:55] Gentiles, you must be circumcised, too."
[1:15:00] God came to free them from the law.
[1:15:03] That's right. To give them the
[1:15:04] dispensation of grace. And there's Jews
[1:15:07] bringing the law across the River
[1:15:09] Jordan. Yeah.
[1:15:11] Amen. Achen brought the law across the
[1:15:14] river Jordan. And what did he cause?
[1:15:16] Death in the camp.
[1:15:18] Right? Don't think of Achen as the a
[1:15:20] brother, the Achin within your own
[1:15:22] spirit. Say, "What have I pulled with me
[1:15:26] into this promised land? What have I
[1:15:28] pulled with me into the open word? What
[1:15:30] have I laid a hold of and held and kept
[1:15:33] from Jericho?" The first battle. Yeah.
[1:15:36] The first battle. What have I held on
[1:15:39] to? Yeah. Amen. Go back to the basics. I
[1:15:44] don't mean the basics as
[1:15:46] in, you know, God sent a prophet. I mean
[1:15:49] the basics of your humanity
[1:15:52] and realize I'm just a person. I'm just
[1:15:54] flesh, fallen flesh. And I've got all
[1:15:57] these ideas because we love to be
[1:16:00] religious. And I've got all these ideas
[1:16:01] of what I think a message preacher
[1:16:03] should be or what I think a message
[1:16:06] pastor should be or what I think a good
[1:16:08] sermon is or how I think a all these
[1:16:10] things should go or how I think this is
[1:16:13] what the seven church ages is. This is
[1:16:15] what the seven church age book is. Why
[1:16:17] is that still an issue?
[1:16:19] Cuz we held on. We stayed the Jew. Amen.
[1:16:24] The Jew overcame.
[1:16:27] There's there's two. There's a black dog
[1:16:28] and the white dog. Amen. How you doing,
[1:16:30] chief? He says, depends on who I'm
[1:16:31] feeding. Amen. Are you feeding the
[1:16:35] overcoming son of God or are you feeding
[1:16:38] the Jew? Talking specifically to people
[1:16:42] especially especially raising the
[1:16:44] message. That's you think about it. The
[1:16:47] position we are in today, that's the
[1:16:48] Jew. Amen. Raising the message. That's
[1:16:51] the Jew.
[1:16:53] Says this is how it is. See, God has
[1:16:56] called me to get up here and to speak to
[1:16:57] you. And you've got we've got we've got
[1:16:59] conid order and doctrine. We've got
[1:17:00] these things. But what if God asks me
[1:17:02] how far will you go? What will you say
[1:17:05] for my glory?
[1:17:07] I have to answer for what I said or what
[1:17:09] I didn't say. Yeah. Saints of God, I
[1:17:12] need my Jew crucified. I need my Jew
[1:17:16] like Paul. What happened?
[1:17:19] Saul met Christ. Amen. The Jew met
[1:17:23] Christ. And God said, "It's hard for you
[1:17:25] to kick against the pricks, right?
[1:17:27] Right. He thought he was right. Yeah. He
[1:17:31] stood there and watched a brother
[1:17:33] murdered. Yeah. Watch a man's ministry
[1:17:36] destroyed by the rocks of false
[1:17:39] doctrine, by the rocks of the Jews. He w
[1:17:42] stood there and watched the man's
[1:17:43] ministry destroyed and said, "Good. He
[1:17:45] was causing too many problems."
[1:17:49] Good men have gone down that way in the
[1:17:51] message community because of what they
[1:17:52] ministered. And nobody stopped to ask,
[1:17:54] "But is it the truth?" Amen. Am I
[1:17:57] calling for a sympathy party? Absolutely
[1:18:00] not. God can raise those men back up
[1:18:02] because Stephen went to sleep. Amen.
[1:18:05] Amen. But take it from the spiritual
[1:18:08] standpoint. Maybe you maybe God was
[1:18:10] dealing with you, but then some Jews
[1:18:13] threw some
[1:18:14] rocks. Maybe maybe maybe God was opening
[1:18:17] your eyes to something that you you
[1:18:19] couldn't even wrap your head around and
[1:18:21] you laid in bed at night thinking, "I've
[1:18:22] lost my mind. There is no way this is
[1:18:26] this is the truth. And then God just
[1:18:28] comes and he shows you again and he
[1:18:29] shows you again and he shows you again.
[1:18:31] But the Jew within threw stones at what
[1:18:34] God was doing and you said never mind.
[1:18:36] And you stepped back and you went to
[1:18:39] sleep spiritually.
[1:18:41] So now you're sitting here this morning
[1:18:43] thinking, "Who's that crazy Alaska,
[1:18:45] Idaho, and Arizonian
[1:18:49] Ohioan who doesn't follow the protocol?
[1:18:54] No, it's not me. I said, Lord, I leave
[1:18:56] myself in that chair back there in your
[1:18:58] office. Amen. I want you to speak and
[1:19:00] only you to speak. And he's asking you
[1:19:03] to to get rid of the Jew to to turn and
[1:19:05] take the rocks and throw them at the Jew
[1:19:07] within you, not the Jew next to you.
[1:19:09] Crucify that old man. Paul, he I mean,
[1:19:13] Paul and all that his his dealings with,
[1:19:15] he just went headtohead with the Jews
[1:19:18] constantly. the people who knew more
[1:19:21] about the scriptures than anybody else
[1:19:23] and they couldn't see it. Why? Why could
[1:19:28] they not see it? Because they had
[1:19:29] assumed God's intentions. Yeah. They had
[1:19:33] assumed this is the way it is, so
[1:19:36] therefore it must be. This is the way I
[1:19:39] was taught, so it has to be true. God is
[1:19:43] here today trying to dismantle what you
[1:19:45] think he is to show you who he truly is.
[1:19:50] He's here to take it down. But you have
[1:19:52] to be willing to surrender that part of
[1:19:55] you that says, "But I want I feel safe
[1:20:01] here." I mean, they had the big
[1:20:04] temples. They had the system. They had
[1:20:07] all these things. They had the wealth.
[1:20:10] Yeah, they had a lot of money, a lot of
[1:20:12] gold and wealth there.
[1:20:14] But Galial says, "Careful."
[1:20:19] He says, "If it be of God, if it's not
[1:20:21] of God, it'll dismantle itself. But it
[1:20:25] if it is of God, careful you don't find
[1:20:28] yourself fighting against God."
[1:20:36] Matthew 20:24 talks about false Christ
[1:20:38] and false prophets.
[1:20:40] all of that anointed false anointed ones
[1:20:42] in and in the sermon the anointed ones
[1:20:43] at the end time. He says now to take our
[1:20:46] time to get a basic fact because I'm
[1:20:48] making a statement here that's
[1:20:50] astounding. How can the Holy Spirit
[1:20:52] anoint a false teacher? But that's what
[1:20:54] Jesus said would happen. This is what
[1:20:57] Peter and John and all those brothers
[1:20:59] were dealing with. Amen. Jews wanted a
[1:21:03] sign. It says false Christ and false
[1:21:06] prophets and shall show great signs and
[1:21:08] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:21:10] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:21:12] elect. But what were they saying? What
[1:21:15] they saying was
[1:21:17] false. But because of the signs and the
[1:21:19] wonders
[1:21:22] that right there is the Jew within us.
[1:21:24] Yeah. The Jew doesn't look to the
[1:21:27] teaching. The Jew within us looks to the
[1:21:30] signs and the wonders and how we feel
[1:21:32] about it and how it speaks to us
[1:21:34] emotionally, right? And and and how how
[1:21:37] oh this you and emotionally I'm not
[1:21:39] talking about running the aisles. I'm
[1:21:40] talking about that happy cozy feeling.
[1:21:42] Yeah. This is familiar.
[1:21:46] This is familiar. Do you know what
[1:21:47] happens if a sheep gets too familiar in
[1:21:49] one area? No more grass.
[1:21:55] And if a sheep don't have grass, sheep
[1:21:57] doesn't bear wool.
[1:22:01] Musicians, will you come, please? In in
[1:22:04] closing
[1:22:06] here, what is the reward, though? That's
[1:22:08] what you all been waiting for. Like, oh
[1:22:10] wow,
[1:22:14] brother, where's the hope? Hey, there's
[1:22:17] a
[1:22:19] remedy. The reward is the book.
[1:22:22] Revelations 10:8. And the voice which I
[1:22:24] heard from heaven is spake unto me again
[1:22:26] and said, "Go and take a little book
[1:22:28] which is opened." Amen. Amen. From the
[1:22:32] angel who stands upon the sea and the
[1:22:33] earth, Christ. Amen. And I went unto the
[1:22:37] angel. How far will you go? All the way
[1:22:39] to the angel. Okay, cool. Will you go
[1:22:41] further? He says, "And I said unto him."
[1:22:45] So he went there. He stood before Christ
[1:22:47] himself. Yeah. and did what the angel
[1:22:50] said to
[1:22:51] do. And God said, "Go a little further.
[1:22:54] Now you have to ask me." He didn't just
[1:22:56] walk up and the Lord just says, "Here
[1:22:58] you go." Right? He said, "Give me the
[1:23:01] little book." He showed some
[1:23:03] perseverance. He showed some dedication.
[1:23:05] Give me the book. Give me the book.
[1:23:09] And he said unto me, take it and eat it
[1:23:11] up, and it shall make thy belly bitter,
[1:23:13] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:23:16] honey.
[1:23:22] Oh, it's
[1:23:24] bitter, but it's so
[1:23:26] sweet. I mean, that's not even worldly
[1:23:29] wise.
[1:23:31] If it makes your belly bit better,
[1:23:32] people stop eating it, you know? Well,
[1:23:34] some of us, some of us, we just can't
[1:23:37] stop resisting it, right? This that
[1:23:39] sugary cake, right? But he says, he
[1:23:42] says, "Take it, eat it up, make that
[1:23:43] belly bitter, but it shall be in that
[1:23:44] mouth sweet as honey." And he said, "I
[1:23:47] took the little book." So there's
[1:23:48] several steps here. He had to go to
[1:23:50] Christ. Then he had to ask for the book
[1:23:53] the book. And then when he heard how bad
[1:23:55] it will be once he eats it, he had to
[1:23:57] say, "I'm willing to do it anyways."
[1:24:00] And then he had to actually take it.
[1:24:04] I took the little book out of the
[1:24:05] angel's hand, and I ate it up, and it
[1:24:07] was in my mouth, sweet as honey. And as
[1:24:09] soon as I had eaten it, my belly was
[1:24:12] bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must
[1:24:14] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:24:16] nations and tongues and kings. The bride
[1:24:18] has a ministry." He's calling you to go
[1:24:20] forth and do something. Do something. So
[1:24:24] John got the book and John answered,
[1:24:27] "All the way." Amen. How far will you
[1:24:31] go? All the way. And here is the promise
[1:24:35] in closing. Revelations 22:1. You guys
[1:24:37] want to start to play a song? Here is
[1:24:39] love vast as the ocean.
[1:24:42] Revelations 22:1 because what how did
[1:24:44] Christ endure the cross for the joy that
[1:24:46] was set before him? How will you endure
[1:24:50] crucifying that Jew for the joy that is
[1:24:52] set before you? He says, "And he showed
[1:24:55] me a pure river of water of life clear
[1:24:58] as crystal proceeding out of the throne
[1:25:01] of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of
[1:25:04] the street of it and on either side of
[1:25:05] the river was there the tree of life
[1:25:08] which bore bear 12 manner of fruits.
[1:25:12] says, "There shall be no more curse, but
[1:25:14] the throne of God and of the Lamb shall
[1:25:16] be in it, and his servants shall serve
[1:25:19] him, and they shall see his face, and
[1:25:22] his name shall be in their foreheads,
[1:25:24] and there shall be no night there, and
[1:25:27] they need no candle, neither light of
[1:25:29] the sun, for the Lord God giveth them
[1:25:31] light, and they shall reign forever and
[1:25:34] ever."
[1:25:35] In order for you to catch revelation of
[1:25:37] the rapture for yourself, you have to
[1:25:39] crucify the Jew. You have to be willing
[1:25:41] to go all the way. And until you're
[1:25:42] willing to go all the way, you will stay
[1:25:44] where you are going nowhere.
[1:25:47] But this is the promise. This is the joy
[1:25:49] that is set before you. Not only there,
[1:25:51] but he see promise lands here. Lands
[1:25:54] that can be natural. That could also be
[1:25:56] spiritual possessions in the word.
[1:25:59] Possessions as a child of God. The
[1:26:01] revelation of Christ coming and renewing
[1:26:04] your spirit every single day. And he
[1:26:07] said unto me, "These things are faithful
[1:26:10] and
[1:26:11] true." And the Lord God of the holy
[1:26:13] prophet sent his angel to show unto his
[1:26:15] servants the things which must shortly
[1:26:16] be done. Behold, I come quickly. Christ
[1:26:20] says, "Behold, I come quickly. Blessed
[1:26:23] is he that keepeth the sayings of the
[1:26:26] prophecy of this
[1:26:28] book." Oh, saints.
[1:26:32] You'll go all the way and he'll do more
[1:26:35] than you could ever ask or think. You go
[1:26:38] all the way, he will bless you
[1:26:40] spiritually beyond measure. The man on
[1:26:43] the cross says, you know, if you could
[1:26:46] please remember me. And he says, I'll
[1:26:48] not only remember you, you will be with
[1:26:50] me today in paradise. He got more than
[1:26:53] he asked for. And when you're willing to
[1:26:55] go all the way with Jesus Christ, all
[1:26:58] the way with the revelation of the word,
[1:26:59] all the way into the open book, he will
[1:27:01] give you more than you could ever ask or
[1:27:03] think. And something in your life will
[1:27:05] shift and you'll realize he's been there
[1:27:08] all the time. He's been talking to me
[1:27:10] all the time. But now I hear. Amen. Can
[1:27:14] we sing this song? Here is love vast as
[1:27:17] the ocean.
[1:27:19] Here is
[1:27:21] love as the ocean.
[1:27:25] Loving
[1:27:27] kindness has the
[1:27:30] flood when the
[1:27:32] prince of life are
[1:27:35] ransom shed for us. His preious
[1:27:41] blood his
[1:27:43] love will not
[1:27:46] remember. Who can cease to sing his
[1:27:50] praise?
[1:27:52] He will
[1:27:54] ever be
[1:27:57] forgotten through throughout
[1:28:00] eternal days.
[1:28:04] On the
[1:28:05] mount of
[1:28:08] crucifixion,
[1:28:10] fountains and deep and
[1:28:13] wide through the
[1:28:16] floodgates of God's
[1:28:19] mercy flow of path and gracious kind.
[1:28:25] Grace and love like might high
[1:28:30] rivers for
[1:28:32] his from
[1:28:35] above. Heaven's peace and perfect
[1:28:40] justice. Kiss the
[1:28:43] guilty world in
[1:28:46] love. Let me all thy love except thee.
[1:28:52] of the
[1:28:54] ever oh my
[1:28:57] days. Let me seek thy kingdom
[1:29:02] only and my life be to thy
[1:29:07] praise. Thou
[1:29:09] alone shall be my
[1:29:13] glory. Nothing in the world I see.
[1:29:19] Thou has cleansed and sanctified me.
[1:29:24] Thou thou
[1:29:26] thyself has set me
[1:29:29] free. In thy truth, thou dost direct me.
[1:29:35] By thy
[1:29:37] spirit, through thy
[1:29:40] word and thy
[1:29:42] grace my is me.
[1:29:46] As I trust in thee, my
[1:29:51] Lord, of thy
[1:29:53] fullness, thou art
[1:29:56] glory, thy great
[1:29:58] love and power on
[1:30:02] me without
[1:30:05] meureful and
[1:30:07] boundless. Draw ye out my heart to thee.
[1:30:14] Sing that last verse again. This is
[1:30:16] exactly the heart of what was said
[1:30:19] today. In thy truth, thou
[1:30:24] doct by thy
[1:30:27] spirit through thy
[1:30:30] word and thy grace. My need is meeting
[1:30:35] thee. As I trust in thee, my Lord.
[1:30:42] of thy
[1:30:43] fullness now our
[1:30:46] glory. Thy great love and power on
[1:30:51] me without

[1:30:57] boundless drawing out my heart to
[1:31:03] thee. Now you sing one more. I love him
[1:31:06] before I turn it over. I love him

[1:31:11] me. Just worship the Lord

[1:32:40] The
[1:32:41] preious blood of
[1:32:44] Jesus
