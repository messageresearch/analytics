[13:56] Romans wanted to remind you too that
[13:58] this this um this afternoon will be our
[14:01] communion and feet Washing Service and
[14:03] so we'll have that this afternoon and
[14:05] then also we'll have the annual vote
[14:08] this will be for the trustees and Sunday
[14:10] school superintendent and that'll take
[14:11] place right at the beginning we'll do
[14:13] that early on so you want to be here on
[14:15] time for
[14:16] that let's look at uh the Bible here in
[14:20] Romans chapter 9 let's look
[14:23] together Romans chapter
[14:27] 9
[14:29] in verse
[14:32] 8 says that is they which are the
[14:35] children of Flesh these are not the
[14:37] children of God but the children of
[14:39] Promise are counted for the seed for
[14:41] This Is The Word of Promise at this time
[14:43] will I come and Sarah shall have a son
[14:46] and not only this but when Rebecca also
[14:48] had conceived by one even by Our Father
[14:50] Isaac for the children being not yet
[14:53] born neither having done any good or
[14:55] evil that the purpose of God according
[14:57] to election might might stand not of
[14:59] works but of him that calleth it was
[15:02] said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the
[15:04] younger as it is written Jacob have I
[15:07] loved but Esau have I hated and God
[15:10] bless you as you take your
[15:13] seats amen as you can see we're going to
[15:15] be continuing on with the same thought
[15:17] we've been on for a couple Services now
[15:19] and uh I I've got a title that I'll
[15:21] share with you after I read a quote here
[15:23] in just a moment uh but I just wanted to
[15:26] say that uh I read really really
[15:29] appreciated the Wednesday night service
[15:31] I hope you all who weren't here had the
[15:33] chance to listen to it it did me a world
[15:35] of good and and uh I the more I meditate
[15:39] on it the more I'm ashamed of
[15:41] myself Amen in the flesh we just have
[15:44] nothing to offer in the flesh there's
[15:46] just like like the Apostle Paul said
[15:48] that in me that is in my flesh is no
[15:50] good thing and I can't believe how many
[15:54] times that I acted like talked like felt
[15:57] like there was something something good
[15:59] when I should have realized there was
[16:01] nothing good there the only thing good
[16:03] is what God has planted on the inside
[16:06] and so we thank God for that we
[16:08] appreciate brother Ben yielding himself
[16:10] and surrendering to the will of the Lord
[16:13] so I feel like that's how we grow the
[16:16] way up is down and it was a good
[16:19] opportunity for us all to grow now as we
[16:21] look into this subject that we've been
[16:23] continuing on here with Jacob and
[16:26] Esau and me don't forget that we're
[16:28] looking looking at uh the the way that
[16:30] we're looking at this is Esau as the
[16:32] natural man or the carnal man or the
[16:34] outer man and we're looking at Jacob is
[16:37] the spiritual man or the Inner Man the
[16:40] the one that's predestinated and here it
[16:43] was uh it's we've read this scripture
[16:46] before but I just want to highlight a
[16:47] few things in verse 11 it says for the
[16:50] children being not yet born neither
[16:52] having done any good or evil that is
[16:55] such a consolation friends before they
[16:57] were born before before they had the
[16:59] chance to act out anything before they
[17:02] could have done good before they could
[17:03] have done evil before they could have
[17:05] confessed anything the right way or
[17:07] confessed anything the wrong way before
[17:09] they ever had a chance it says having uh
[17:13] be neither having done any good or evil
[17:14] that the purpose of God according to
[17:16] election might stand not of works but of
[17:19] him that calleth it was said unto her
[17:21] the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it
[17:23] is written Jacob have I loved but Esau
[17:26] have I hated my goodness before they did
[17:30] anything right or wrong before they were
[17:31] born before they did good or evil God
[17:34] had already
[17:35] declared let's go back to Genesis 25 and
[17:38] and pick up the story there that we've
[17:40] been dealing
[17:42] with we're going to spend a little time
[17:44] here in the uh Genesis 25 and
[17:51] 27 Genesis 25 and let's start at verse
[17:57] 21
[18:02] in Genesis 25:
[18:05] 21 says and Isaac entreated the Lord for
[18:08] his wife because she was Barren and the
[18:10] Lord was entreated of him and Rebecca
[18:12] his wife conceived and the children
[18:14] struggled together within her and she
[18:16] said if it be so why am I thus and she
[18:19] went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord
[18:21] said unto her two nations are in thy
[18:23] womb and two manner of people shall be
[18:25] separated from thy bowels and the one
[18:27] people shall be stronger than the other
[18:29] people and the Elder Shall Serve the
[18:31] younger and when her days to be
[18:33] delivered were fulfilled behold there
[18:35] were twins in her womb and the first
[18:38] came out red all over like a hairy
[18:40] garment and they called his name Esau
[18:43] after that came his brother out and his
[18:45] hand took hold on Esau's heel and his
[18:47] name was called Jacob and Isaac was
[18:50] three score years old when she bare them
[18:53] and the boys grew and Esau was a cunning
[18:55] Hunter and a man of the field and Jacob
[18:57] was a plain man dwelling in tents and
[19:00] Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of
[19:03] his venison but Rebecca loved Jacob amen
[19:09] so we've been reading through these
[19:10] scriptures we understand them we've
[19:11] talked about this how how she finally
[19:14] the promise had come to her and she had
[19:16] conceived but but in the conception it
[19:19] was a good thing but in the good thing
[19:21] there was some turmoil going on within
[19:23] her there was a war inside of her and
[19:25] she wondered if it be so if if this is a
[19:28] good thing if I've conceived if the
[19:29] Lord's answered the prayer what is going
[19:32] on inside of me and that's when she
[19:33] found of the Lord that there's two
[19:35] Nations there's two peoples there's two
[19:37] different kinds within her and that
[19:39] explains so much us after the New Birth
[19:42] why are we under turmoil why do we have
[19:44] so much going on because there's two
[19:46] brother B said you can't be in two
[19:48] bodies at once but you can be you have
[19:49] two Natures at one time the old carnal
[19:53] nature and he says as long as you're in
[19:55] this flesh you're going to have an old
[19:56] stick sticky Cocker nature that that's
[19:58] going to bother you a amen but but we we
[20:01] went through all of that and looked at
[20:03] that and and we begin to that begin to
[20:05] come home such a reality for me that
[20:07] that is what we we are dealing with that
[20:10] is what we're struggling with that is
[20:12] really where our struggle is amen I
[20:14] don't really have a struggle with
[20:15] anything outside of me amen the struggle
[20:18] I have is inside of me and if I can win
[20:20] the struggle inside of me there's not
[20:21] going to be a problem outside of me amen
[20:24] it's never what happens to me it's
[20:25] always the way I react to it that's the
[20:27] problem and that's what God is watching
[20:29] for amen and we're constantly being
[20:31] tested in those things but God has given
[20:34] us enough word that we can begin to
[20:36] understand what's going on we begin to
[20:38] realize why am I struggling so bad why
[20:41] am I reacting the way I'm reacting
[20:42] what's going on and you realize that's
[20:45] the old nature that's the old man amen
[20:47] he's still struggling to live he still
[20:49] wants Dominion he still wants to rule
[20:51] but by the grace of God Amen the Elder
[20:53] Shall Serve the younger the new birth is
[20:56] going to conquer and win the day am so
[20:59] all these things begin to to give us
[21:02] understanding and now I would like to
[21:04] read this quote I've read part of it I'm
[21:06] going to go a little further in the last
[21:08] couple Services it's from 1960 in the
[21:10] message hearing recognizing acting on
[21:13] the word of God he says these two boys
[21:16] if we notice their nature one of them
[21:17] was a spiritual man that was Jacob and
[21:20] the carnal man was Esau but they were
[21:22] both religious and that same thing has
[21:25] took place all down through the age the
[21:27] carnal and the
[21:29] spiritual I I want you to I would like
[21:32] to remind us that when we talk about the
[21:35] carnal and we talk about the spiritual
[21:37] we're not talking about the wicked and
[21:41] the and the clean living they're both
[21:44] religious that's the deception that even
[21:48] in my carnal nature amen because there's
[21:50] a desire to worship God it can act in a
[21:53] very religious way and still not be
[21:56] right and that's where the decep ction
[21:58] even within ourselves comes sometimes
[22:00] amen so he
[22:02] says both of them were
[22:05] religious that's the same thing as took
[22:07] place all down through the age the
[22:08] carnal and the spiritual Esau represents
[22:11] the man of the earth natural religious
[22:13] inclined but never able it wasn't in him
[22:16] to do it he couldn't do it he never was
[22:18] in him to be able to climb a past the
[22:20] things of the world the carnal things
[22:22] but Jacob it was just so easy for him to
[22:24] do it Jacob one purpose Jacob had and
[22:27] that was that he longed for the
[22:29] birthright no matter how he got it it
[22:31] just so he got it and that Spirit of
[22:34] that one birth is still represented in
[22:36] the world today and it's coming to a
[22:38] head now the spiritual believer and the
[22:40] carnal man the carnal believer no one
[22:43] could say they wasn't both religious
[22:44] they were they didn't say they that that
[22:47] one served an idol and the other one God
[22:49] they were both Servants of
[22:51] God oh it gets so close to home but he
[22:54] says now I love this he says it's coming
[22:57] to a head now now the spiritual believer
[22:59] in the carnal man I say it's coming to a
[23:01] head but it's coming to a head right
[23:04] here amen this is where Christ is going
[23:07] to conquer this is where he's going to
[23:09] have dominion and this is where the old
[23:11] nature this is where the the sin that
[23:13] was embedded into us at the fall this is
[23:16] where it's going to be conquered in
[23:17] Christ the word is going to have
[23:19] dominion praise
[23:21] God then he goes on to say now if you
[23:24] notice Jacob had one thing that he
[23:26] wanted because according to the word the
[23:29] blessing and the good things laid in the
[23:31] birthright and Jacob that was his only
[23:33] objective and the only thing he had in
[23:35] mind was get that
[23:38] Birthright praise God that's what we
[23:41] want to look at there there's a
[23:42] statement brother bam makes here that I
[23:44] want to take for a title he said but
[23:47] Jacob let me go back and read the whole
[23:49] sentence he said Esau represented the
[23:52] man of the earth natural religious
[23:54] inclined but never able it wasn't in him
[23:56] to do it he couldn't do it it he never
[23:58] was in him to be able to climb past the
[24:01] things of the world the carnal things
[24:03] now when you talk about things of the
[24:04] world the carnal things brother vandom
[24:06] is not equating that to wickedness
[24:09] because he was a religious man but it
[24:11] was the natural the carnal the physical
[24:14] the fleshly things he can never climb
[24:17] past he says and I never climb past the
[24:19] things of the world the carnal things
[24:21] but Jacob it was just so easy for him to
[24:24] do it and so for the the title I'd like
[24:28] to take it was just so easy for Jacob it
[24:33] was just so easy for Jacob and I've had
[24:36] such a fun time looking at this subject
[24:38] of why it was just so easy for Jacob
[24:41] amen this this came up in a conversation
[24:43] uh last Sunday around our table we were
[24:45] having some fellowship and somebody made
[24:47] the statement and it was something that
[24:48] stood out to me too this quote this part
[24:51] of the quote and uh I really didn't
[24:53] think anymore about it we talked about
[24:54] it but then it just kept rolling over
[24:56] and over and over inside of me until all
[24:58] of a sudden it landed
[25:00] somewhere I knew this is what we're
[25:02] going to preach because I got so excited
[25:04] when God opened the little picture for
[25:06] me you know Jacob when there was there
[25:10] was a war in the womb now there was a
[25:13] struggle going on but this is before
[25:16] either one had
[25:19] Consciousness Esau wasn't aware of what
[25:22] the struggle was about Jacob wasn't
[25:23] aware of what the struggle was about
[25:25] they weren't yet born but yet there was
[25:28] already something going on there was
[25:30] already the plan of God beginning to
[25:32] work and and there was already a
[25:34] struggle and then when Esau was born
[25:37] Esau was first and he came out first but
[25:40] but attached to his heel with his grip
[25:42] on his heel amen and and it they called
[25:45] him Jacob because Jacob means a planter
[25:47] but it also means one to overreach or
[25:49] overtake amen he had something in him at
[25:53] Birth amen before he could talk before
[25:56] he could think before he could reason
[25:58] before he could do anything there was
[26:00] some nature down inside of him that
[26:02] wouldn't let Esau get ahead of him he
[26:04] grabbed a hold of his heel and was
[26:06] hanging on for their life because why he
[26:08] wanted to surpass he wanted to overreach
[26:10] he wanted the place Esau had he wanted
[26:13] the birthright he wanted the firstborn
[26:16] he wanted he wanted all of those things
[26:18] he wanted it before he knew he wanted
[26:22] it praise God friends there was things
[26:25] that we wanted all of our life but we
[26:27] didn't know what we wanted we didn't
[26:29] know what was in us and what was driving
[26:31] us and why we were dissatisfied and why
[26:33] we could never settle down and there was
[26:35] something driving us why religion never
[26:38] quite hit the mark we tried churches and
[26:40] we tried different things try to live
[26:42] right and then fail and all we didn't
[26:44] know what was driving us what was in us
[26:46] but whatever was in Jacob when he was
[26:48] born was in
[26:51] us so here he comes out a heel Grabber
[26:54] saying no you're not going to get ahead
[26:56] of me I want the promise I I want the
[26:59] birth
[27:01] right praise be to God am mean he he
[27:04] longed brother B said Jacob his only
[27:07] objective the only thing he had in mind
[27:09] was get the birth right and the question
[27:11] was where did that desire come from why
[27:14] did he want it so bad what was in Jacob
[27:17] when Esau would so easily give it away
[27:19] when it came to his life or his
[27:21] Birthright he would take his natural
[27:23] life and give up his birth right amen
[27:26] why was it that Jacob was willing to go
[27:28] through any extent possible to get the
[27:31] birth right there was something
[27:33] different inside both of those
[27:35] boys it was predestination it was the
[27:39] predestinated plan of God it was the
[27:41] seed of God it was the thought of God it
[27:43] was the word of God that was driving
[27:45] those two boys it wasn't that Jacob was
[27:47] more calculated it wasn't that he was
[27:49] wiser it wasn't that it wasn't that he
[27:52] was more religious it wasn't any of that
[27:54] but there was something already in him
[27:56] that made him want that
[28:00] Birthright that's why he's holding on to
[28:02] that heel coming
[28:04] forth oh praise be to God brother bham
[28:08] says and there came there come Cain and
[28:11] made his offering he worshiped he went
[28:13] to church he's just as good as the next
[28:15] fellow Esau was the same Esau in his
[28:18] character was a better man than Jacob
[28:20] more of a gentleman he loved his father
[28:23] and the thing that he done but God chose
[28:26] Jacob
[28:28] so God didn't choose Jacob because of
[28:31] his character his nice attitude his
[28:35] beautiful physical features and he chose
[28:38] him before any of that
[28:40] manifest he chose him because we we
[28:44] learned in the message we chose him
[28:46] because Jacob was a part of him amen
[28:48] right so there was something that was
[28:50] always part of Jacob that Esau just
[28:53] simply didn't
[28:56] have there was something in Abel that
[29:01] Cain didn't
[29:04] have it was there from birth it was
[29:06] there from the
[29:08] beginning let's continue on and look
[29:10] here at verse
[29:13] um what verse do I want to look at uh
[29:19] 27 I'm sorry let's go to verse
[29:23] 29 and Jacob saw pottage and Esau came
[29:26] from the field and he was
[29:28] faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I
[29:31] pray thee with that same red pottage for
[29:34] I'm faint therefore was his name called
[29:36] Edom and Jacob said sell me this day thy
[29:39] Birthright and Esau said behold I am at
[29:41] the point to die and what prophet shall
[29:44] this Birthright do to me and Jacob said
[29:46] swear to me this day and he swore unto
[29:48] him and he sold his Birthright unto
[29:49] Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and
[29:52] pottage of lentils and he did eat and
[29:54] drink and Rose up and went his way thus
[29:57] Esau despised his Birthright so we've
[30:00] we've looked at this and we see that
[30:02] Esau so lightly gave it up because to
[30:04] him the car he could never move past the
[30:07] carnal he never could go past the
[30:09] natural and for him the the the end of
[30:12] the carinal the end of the natural was
[30:15] death there was nothing beyond that that
[30:17] was the limit that was the barrier and
[30:18] when he come to the point of death he
[30:20] said well what good will a Birthright do
[30:22] me after I die but Jacob had something
[30:25] else inside of him he knew that birth
[30:27] right was everything it had to do with
[30:29] the word it had to do with Christ it had
[30:30] to do with eternal life it had to do
[30:32] with the promise to Abraham it had to do
[30:34] with everything was in that Birthright
[30:37] and how he knew it I don't know how he
[30:39] knew it but he knew it there was just
[30:41] something in him that knew it and craved
[30:43] it and had to have it and Esau could
[30:45] never reach past the carinal but it was
[30:48] just so easy for Jacob why because he
[30:50] already had the desire from the moment
[30:52] he was born before he was breathing
[30:55] before he took the breath of life he had
[30:56] a hold of that brother's
[31:00] heel and so now we see there was a
[31:04] prophecy and we read in Romans how
[31:07] before they were born before they had
[31:09] done good or evil that according that
[31:11] the purpose according to election might
[31:13] stand he said the younger Shall Serve
[31:15] the older and Jacob have I loved and
[31:17] Esau have I hated he was chose they were
[31:19] chose from before the foundation of the
[31:21] world and now they come forth and they
[31:23] begin to manifest what's on the inside
[31:26] and Jacob he's got to have that
[31:28] Birthright but he doesn't know how to
[31:29] get the birthright because the
[31:31] birthright is going by the firstborn of
[31:33] the lineage amen so he's stuck in this
[31:36] conundrum he doesn't know and I and I
[31:39] wonder sometimes the thoughts that Jacob
[31:42] had how do I get the birth how how much
[31:45] did he contemplate how much did he
[31:47] desire it how much did he think about it
[31:49] how many times did he feel like oh if I
[31:51] would only been born first oh one minute
[31:54] earlier why why why not one minute
[31:57] earlier and all of these thoughts that
[31:59] went through his
[32:00] head remember all these Bible characters
[32:03] were men of like passions like we are
[32:05] they weren't a whole lot different than
[32:07] you and I they just lived in a different
[32:08] era and he's wondering how can I get
[32:10] this birth right what could I do and
[32:12] then he starts probably I'm just
[32:14] dramatizing but he would start to think
[32:16] you know Esau's a hunter he could have
[32:18] an accident oh Jacob don't think like
[32:22] that do you think he was a human being
[32:25] or
[32:26] not
[32:29] maybe while he's out there a roving band
[32:31] of nomadic Warrior oh stop it Jacob
[32:33] that's you know that's not
[32:39] right no matter how much he thought
[32:41] about it he probably couldn't think of
[32:43] any good
[32:45] honest righteous way to get that
[32:50] Birthright and he probably felt bad for
[32:53] all the thoughts that floated through
[32:54] his mind on the ways that he could get
[32:55] the birth right
[32:58] if he was normal like you and
[33:00] I all I can say is if I was in Jacob's
[33:04] position I would have been struggling
[33:05] with
[33:06] thoughts you may not have been but if I
[33:09] had that strong desire I would have been
[33:11] struggling with
[33:13] thoughts
[33:15] so so in all the contemplation and all
[33:19] the reasonings and all the battle within
[33:21] himself back and forth on how to get it
[33:23] he had to have it he knew that
[33:24] everything lay in that promise and and
[33:27] everything lay in the birthright and it
[33:28] had to do with the promise and the word
[33:30] and eternal life in Christ and
[33:32] everything was part of that Birthright
[33:34] and so now he's contemplating on how to
[33:36] do it and I just want you to see how
[33:38] easy it is for
[33:40] Jacob in order to get the birth right
[33:43] all he has to do was cook some
[33:47] lentils not even knowing what he was
[33:49] doing fixing himself a lunch fixing
[33:52] himself a dinner he was soting pottage
[33:54] and he was fixing himself lentils and
[33:56] all the a sudden the circumstan of Life
[33:58] had worked in such a way that Esau had
[34:00] been in the field too long and hadn't
[34:02] got the game he was after and he was in
[34:03] a weakened condition and he come and he
[34:05] find his brother with food and and Esau
[34:08] could not stretch beyond the carnal he
[34:10] could not value the birthright with the
[34:12] right value amen and when it come down
[34:14] to his life or the birthright who
[34:16] orchestrated this event did Jacob
[34:18] orchestrate this did Jacob work out
[34:20] these details did Jacob put this plan
[34:22] together no from the be before the
[34:25] foundation of the world God wanted Jacob
[34:27] to have the birthright God knew that he
[34:29] would have it he was born with the
[34:31] desire for it but it was God who worked
[34:33] out the circumstances amen he didn't
[34:35] have to go and he didn't have to do any
[34:37] of these other odd things all he had to
[34:40] do was sod
[34:42] pottage of all his surmising and of all
[34:45] his planning and of all of his conflict
[34:47] within he probably never thought I'm
[34:49] going to get the birth right by soting
[34:52] pottage by cooking lentils but God
[34:55] always knew that Jacob was going to have
[34:58] the birthright and God worked out the
[35:00] circumstance till Esau came to him he
[35:02] didn't go to Esau Esau came to him and
[35:04] when Esau came to him he said feed me
[35:07] I'm at the point of death and there was
[35:08] something inside of Jacob he could not
[35:11] create the opportunity but when the
[35:12] opportunity came his way he could seize
[35:14] it because he had the desire for the
[35:17] birthright amen and and you would think
[35:19] that's not a good brother he should have
[35:21] just fed him and those are all the
[35:22] thoughts I have but God was working this
[35:25] out this was according to God's plan God
[35:28] would put that desire in Jacob to do
[35:30] what you and I would think wouldn't be
[35:32] charitable it wouldn't be brotherly
[35:34] kindness it wouldn't be brotherly love
[35:36] but God worked these circumstances out
[35:38] and presented Jacob with an opportunity
[35:40] and when God gave him the opportunity
[35:42] Jacob grabbed a hold of it
[35:45] again he said sell me your Birthright
[35:48] and I'll feed you Esau said fine what's
[35:51] it to me if I die it don't do me any
[35:53] good anyways and so he swore him his
[35:56] Birthright right and Jacob fed
[35:59] him see friends for Jacob it was just so
[36:05] easy I
[36:06] don't when when we go down this road and
[36:09] we start talking about this I I don't
[36:11] want you to think I'm thinking for all
[36:12] of Jacob's life was easy he had
[36:15] struggles he had
[36:17] challenges but when it come to getting
[36:19] the birth right it was just so
[36:23] easy why because it was
[36:25] his for the foundation of the world it
[36:28] was his to have it was his to take God
[36:31] had put him desire in him and then God
[36:33] would work the circumstances out to
[36:35] match the desire that was in his heart
[36:37] amen this was God's plan not Jacob's
[36:41] plan let's go to uh chapter 27
[36:54] now and it came to pass pass uh yeah uh
[36:58] Genesis
[37:00] 27 verse one and it came to pass that
[37:02] when Isaac was old and his eyes were
[37:04] them so that he could not see he called
[37:06] Esau his eldest son and said unto him my
[37:08] son and he said unto him behold here am
[37:11] I and he said behold now I am old I know
[37:14] not the day of my death now therefore
[37:16] take I pray thee thy weapons thy quiver
[37:19] and thy bow and go into the field and
[37:21] take me some venison and make me Savory
[37:24] meat such as I love and bring it to me
[37:27] that I may eat that my soul may bless
[37:29] thee before I die so now Isaac because
[37:34] Isaac loves Esau he wants uh he wants a
[37:38] reason to bless Esau and he asks Esau to
[37:41] go and get meat and make savory meat for
[37:44] him from Wild game and and that he would
[37:46] bless
[37:47] him and and brother R says and uh does
[37:50] God ever change his mind about his word
[37:51] from 65 he says now notice the natural
[37:54] always tries to type the spiritual but
[37:56] as in Jacob and Esau it will not work it
[37:59] will not it would not when it come to
[38:01] doing good works I believe that Esau
[38:03] actually was a better man than Jacob in
[38:05] the sight of man he tried to take care
[38:07] of his daddy he was a blind a prophet
[38:10] and all these things that he tried to do
[38:12] but yet Esau didn't think about that
[38:14] being just carnal work he thought he
[38:16] could get in by by what he done do
[38:19] something good for
[38:21] somebody this is what's wrong with the
[38:24] Esau and
[38:25] us is that we think by being good and
[38:29] being nice and following the rules and
[38:31] keeping the order and doing good to all
[38:33] people that that that's going to be
[38:35] enough that that's what it's going to
[38:36] take but it's going to take something a
[38:38] whole lot more than
[38:40] that Esau didn't he didn't think about
[38:43] that being just carnal
[38:45] work think could got he could get in by
[38:47] what he'd done doing something good for
[38:49] somebody and brother said which was all
[38:51] right but Jacob his whole soul was to
[38:54] get that birth right and that's what God
[38:56] recognized in him
[38:58] spiritually oh I it's so it's so amazing
[39:01] friends cuz we stand in the same spot
[39:03] today we've got this old Esau religious
[39:06] nature that thinks if I just if I look
[39:08] good and I do good and I show up to
[39:10] church and I've got everything in order
[39:12] and I do what everything's told to me
[39:14] then all of a sudden I'm owed the
[39:16] blessing I I'm going to fall into the no
[39:19] God doesn't owe us anything if we do all
[39:22] the most perfect works in the world
[39:24] we're still deficient for what we owe
[39:26] him it will never equal the balance you
[39:28] can be perfect almost every day of your
[39:30] life which we know is impossible when
[39:32] hybrid Fallen flesh but let's say
[39:34] somehow you magically are able through a
[39:37] a supernatural strength of will to
[39:39] perform his word perfectly you're still
[39:41] in debt at the end of
[39:45] that it won't equal anything there's got
[39:48] to be something else that God's
[39:49] recognizing and it doesn't mean that
[39:51] we're supposed to do wrong and we're
[39:53] supposed to do evil works that's not it
[39:55] at all but there's something else that
[39:57] God is looking for and when Jacob and
[39:59] Esau were living this life amen Esau was
[40:03] a better caretaker for his father
[40:05] brother B said he did more Works he was
[40:07] a better man he was religious and all of
[40:09] these things that the prophet tells us
[40:11] but God wasn't looking at any of that he
[40:13] was looking down deeper and Esau
[40:15] despised the birthright but Jacob's
[40:17] whole soul was to get the birthright his
[40:20] whole soul had to do with Christ his
[40:22] whole soul had to do with the word his
[40:23] whole soul had to do with the promise
[40:25] and he didn't care what he had to do to
[40:27] get it he didn't care what he had to
[40:29] look like or what people thought of him
[40:31] he just had to have
[40:33] it that's what God is looking
[40:36] for and that and that friends that came
[40:40] easy for
[40:41] Jacob Esau could have never put that
[40:44] desire in his
[40:46] heart Esau could want the blessing Esau
[40:49] could want a good life Esau could want
[40:51] God to shower him with praise Esau can
[40:53] want all kinds of things and he can want
[40:54] it badly we'll see here he did did want
[40:56] the blessing he wanted it with all of
[40:58] his heart he cried after the blessing
[41:00] amen but but that was the carnal part
[41:03] amen he wanted to be blessed in the land
[41:05] and he wanted God to give him blessings
[41:07] and keep him and watch over him and
[41:09] prosper him and all those things but but
[41:12] down in his heart he couldn't go past
[41:14] the carnal and get to the real depth of
[41:16] the
[41:18] spiritual but for Esau it was just so
[41:21] easy or Jacob Esau couldn't put himself
[41:25] in Jacob's position and he couldn't give
[41:27] himself the same desire Jacob
[41:34] has when we read in Hebrews I'm just
[41:36] going to uh quote this scripture to you
[41:38] Hebrews 11:4 says by faith Abel offered
[41:42] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[41:44] Cain by which he obtained witness that
[41:46] he was righteous God testifying of his
[41:48] gifts and by it him being dead yet
[41:50] speaketh says by faith Abel offered unto
[41:54] God a more excellent sacrificed than
[41:57] Cain not by works by faith it was more
[42:01] excellent because it was by Revelation
[42:03] and by Revelation he offered exactly
[42:05] what God desired and God was not looking
[42:08] at the works what Abel offered was a
[42:10] testimony of what Abel
[42:15] believed 1 John 3:12 says not as Cain
[42:18] who is of the wicked one and slew his
[42:21] brother and wherefore slew he him
[42:23] because his own Works were evil in his
[42:25] brother's righteous what made Cain's
[42:28] Works evil amen remember he slew his
[42:31] brother because his Works were evil so
[42:33] that mean the evil Works came before the
[42:34] slaying of his brother so you can't say
[42:36] his evil work was the slaying of his
[42:37] brother no he he had evil work before he
[42:40] slew his brother and what was his evil
[42:42] work his evil Works were he offered a
[42:44] god according to his own carnal desire
[42:48] amen he was a carnal believer he and
[42:51] brother B said he loved God he had a
[42:53] desire to worship God and and he worked
[42:56] towards his sacrifice amen but it was
[42:59] called evil works and when God came to
[43:01] him and his countenance was fallen and
[43:03] he gave him an opportunity just even
[43:05] without Revelation if he would just
[43:07] follow after his brother it would go
[43:09] well with him he could not humble
[43:11] himself to the true word of God because
[43:14] he was stuck on the carnal and he could
[43:16] never reach past the carnal level to the
[43:18] spiritual level even though God was
[43:20] allowing him just in a carnal way to
[43:22] follow the
[43:25] revelation
[43:26] amen but when Abel Abel he didn't strain
[43:31] listen I Abel wasn't working he wasn't
[43:34] straining Abel wasn't I mean Cain did
[43:38] all the work he he built a beautiful
[43:40] altar he buil brother man said build a
[43:41] beautiful Church hun Stone Altar and he
[43:44] had all the beautiful sacrifice he
[43:46] labored and labored and labored but Abel
[43:48] was doing nothing just just waiting and
[43:51] waiting and waiting upon the Lord why
[43:53] because he could reach forward Beyond
[43:56] the carnal into the spiritual because it
[43:58] was already in him to do
[44:01] so and listen Abel did not give himself
[44:04] a
[44:08] revelation who gave him a revelation God
[44:10] gave him a
[44:12] revelation and by faith and where did he
[44:14] get the heart to believe and where did
[44:16] he get the ability to receive Revelation
[44:19] what works did he did how hard was it
[44:21] for him listen friends for Abel it was
[44:24] just so easy for Abel to reach beyond
[44:26] the carnal to the spiritual it was
[44:28] already in him to do it all he had to do
[44:30] was wait on the Lord and when he waited
[44:32] on the Lord at some point in time God
[44:34] all of a sudden opened his understanding
[44:36] and by faith he knew the sacrifice to
[44:39] give and by faith he offered a more
[44:40] excellent sacrifice amen and God
[44:43] testifying that he was righteous when
[44:45] was he righteous he was already
[44:47] righteous why because the righteous are
[44:50] able to receive
[44:53] Revelation because Abraham believed God
[44:56] God it was imputed unto him for
[44:58] righteousness so now no wonder Cain got
[45:03] so
[45:06] upset Cain worked and he labored and he
[45:09] strived to be a good boy to offer to God
[45:13] to have a beautiful worship he worked to
[45:16] be
[45:18] accepted he watched his brother do
[45:21] nothing day after day day after day day
[45:26] after day he did it looked to him like
[45:28] he was just not even
[45:30] trying it looked like he was putting
[45:33] forth no effort that he wasn't even
[45:34] trying and and and Cain I mean he he has
[45:38] a religious nature he has a desire to
[45:41] worship God he knows it's the time of
[45:43] the sacrifice is coming so he's under
[45:46] pressure to produce something for God
[45:48] and he looks at his brother and his
[45:49] brother seemingly doesn't have the
[45:51] pressure and he can't correlate these
[45:53] two so no doubt no no doubt Cain got in
[45:56] his mind how it was going to work on
[45:58] sacrifice day who was going to be
[46:00] accepted and who wasn't going to be
[46:03] accepted but Cain was in for the shock
[46:05] of his life when he offered everything
[46:07] beautiful and had it arranged just right
[46:09] and all of a sudden Abel comes along
[46:11] amen with a little Grapevine brother bam
[46:12] said wrapped around a little lamb and
[46:14] dragging it dragging it up to the
[46:17] Eastern side of e Eden right in front of
[46:19] the gate amen and he come dragging and
[46:21] bleeding and and brother M that didn't
[46:23] heue a stone out didn't do anything he
[46:25] rolled over A Flat Rock Amen threw the
[46:27] lamb down on it shoved his knee on it
[46:30] and found a sharp rock near him
[46:31] somewhere and started hacking that lamb
[46:33] to pieces and it was bleeding and and
[46:36] kicking and crying and dying amen it was
[46:39] a mess amen and when we got and when
[46:41] they got done I'm sure Cain was over
[46:43] here and all of his carnal religious
[46:46] religion looking at that and saying
[46:48] there is no way yeah that is going to
[46:51] work there is no way that kind of
[46:54] religion there's no way a amen because
[46:56] why he couldn't go past the carnal to
[46:59] the spiritual but for Abel it was just
[47:01] so
[47:05] easy he didn't have to spend money he
[47:08] didn't have to labor he didn't have to
[47:10] do all he had to do was go to the flock
[47:12] and grab a sheep and and bring a lamb
[47:14] along and and all the resources were
[47:16] already there yeah yeah amen no wonder
[47:20] Kan kan's countenance fell he was
[47:23] disappointed and he was discouraged and
[47:25] he was not understanding
[47:28] it this is the difference between the
[47:30] carnal and the spiritual
[47:32] believer these things still happen today
[47:35] friends I mean sometimes we in the
[47:36] message for so long and we serve the
[47:38] Lord for years and years and years and
[47:40] God will save somebody bring them in and
[47:43] all of a sudden before you know it they
[47:44] got Revelation upon Revelation and it's
[47:46] so easy for them and we're sitting there
[47:48] looking at how come it's so easy for you
[47:51] amen don't let that old carnal nature
[47:53] slip in right and say but I I've been
[47:56] here this many years and I've read this
[47:58] many books no just praise God that God
[48:00] found somebody else that can reach
[48:02] beyond the
[48:07] carnal amen it's so easy to slip back
[48:10] in to that old carnal
[48:14] nature so for Abel I think it's safe to
[48:17] say for Abel it was just so
[48:19] easy for Jacob it was just so
[48:22] easy why because it was already inside
[48:26] and when the time came they didn't have
[48:29] to strain they didn't have to press they
[48:32] didn't have to work when the time came
[48:34] all they had to do was receive
[48:37] Revelation and what Revelation they
[48:39] received the one that God gave
[48:43] amen I don't think
[48:46] Abel if I mean we know they didn't have
[48:49] a written bible in that day but let's
[48:50] just say they did I don't think Abel had
[48:53] to read his Bible through four times y
[48:56] amen and then deduce and
[48:59] calculate
[49:02] amen I think he was just
[49:05] meditating and God dropped it in his
[49:08] heart how hard was that how much work
[49:11] was
[49:13] that it's the grace of
[49:19] God now we come back
[49:22] to
[49:23] Esau his father loved loves him because
[49:26] he serves his father well and his father
[49:28] wants to bless him so he sends him after
[49:30] the
[49:31] Venison and let's look at verse 6 now
[49:34] chapter
[49:36] 27 and Rebecca spake unto Jacob her son
[49:39] saying behold I heard thy father speak
[49:41] unto Esau thy brother saying bring me
[49:44] Venison and make me Savory meat that I
[49:46] may eat and bless thee before the Lord
[49:49] before my death now therefore my son
[49:52] obey my voice according to that which I
[49:54] command thee
[49:56] go now to the flock and fetch me from
[49:58] then two good kids of the goats and I
[50:00] will make them Savory meat for thy
[50:02] father such as he loveth and thou shalt
[50:04] bring it to thy father that he may eat
[50:08] that he may bless thee before his death
[50:10] and Jacob said to Rebecca his mother
[50:12] behold Esau my brother is a hairy man
[50:14] and I'm a smooth man my father per
[50:16] Adventure will feel me and I shall seem
[50:18] to him as a deceiver and shall bring a
[50:21] curse upon me and not a blessing and his
[50:23] mother said unto him upon me be thy
[50:26] curse my son only obey my voice and go
[50:29] fetch me them and he went and fetched
[50:31] and brought them to his mother and his
[50:33] mother made Savory meat such as his
[50:35] father loved and Rebecca took goodly
[50:37] rayment of her eldest son Esau which
[50:39] were with her in the house and put them
[50:41] upon Jacob her younger son and she put
[50:43] the skins of the kids of the goats upon
[50:45] his hands and upon the smooth of his
[50:47] neck and she gave the Savory meat and
[50:49] the bread which she had prepared unto
[50:52] the hand of her son Jacob
[50:56] now it comes time for the blessing the
[50:59] birthright has already been won without
[51:01] any effort from
[51:03] Jacob except soing
[51:05] pottage now it's time for the blessing
[51:08] of the father to be given and be passed
[51:10] down and he wants to give it to
[51:14] Esau but the the question isn't who does
[51:17] Isaac want to give the blessing to the
[51:19] question is who does God want the
[51:21] blessing to go
[51:22] to that's a good question
[51:26] you know Jacob never devised this plan
[51:29] Jacob never figured it
[51:31] out Jacob didn't even hear the
[51:34] conversation between Isaac and Esau he
[51:36] didn't even know what was happening
[51:38] Jacob was just living Jacob was just
[51:40] going on and doing whatever Jacob did on
[51:42] a normal
[51:43] routine this was his mother Rebecca she
[51:47] heard she developed the plan she called
[51:50] him and you she said here's what I want
[51:52] you to do this is the plan you're got to
[51:55] get that blessing now you go and get the
[51:57] kid bring it to me I'll make the Savory
[51:59] meat so he went and got the kid and
[52:01] brought and brought it to his mother his
[52:03] mother prepared the meat his mother took
[52:05] Esau's garment his mother put Esau's
[52:07] garment on him his mother took the goat
[52:09] skins and put it on his neck and put it
[52:11] on his hands she did it all and he was
[52:14] even worried about deceiving his father
[52:16] and said if per adventure and my father
[52:18] would find out it would bring a curse
[52:20] and not a blessing and she stood in the
[52:22] gap for Jacob and said let thy curse be
[52:25] upon on
[52:26] me Who provided this plan for Jacob this
[52:29] wasn't Jacob Jacob didn't do this amen
[52:32] God did this for him using Rebecca and
[52:35] even though he was doing something wrong
[52:37] and even though he was deceiving his
[52:38] father and lying to his dad he God
[52:41] provided an intercessor God provided one
[52:44] that would stand in the Gap Amen to
[52:46] preserve Jacob to keep the blessing
[52:48] Rebecca would stand there and say let
[52:50] the curse let your curse be upon me so
[52:53] that you can get the blessing
[52:56] how hard was this for Jacob I want to
[52:58] ask you how hard was it it wasn't hard
[53:01] it was easy his mom developed the plant
[53:03] his mom was going to be the Fall Guy
[53:05] everything was working to his favor why
[53:07] was it working to his favor because
[53:09] before they were born before they did
[53:11] good and evil God had
[53:16] said he goes and runs and grabs the kid
[53:18] brings it to his mom she goes to work
[53:20] she grabs the Garment she takes the
[53:22] Skins Jacob my goodness everything just
[53:25] Falls in his
[53:28] lap he walks in there amen and he begins
[53:31] to deceive his father I've brought your
[53:34] Savory meat I mean he didn't hunt it he
[53:36] didn't cook it look at poor Esau Esau's
[53:39] out in the field with a bow and an arrow
[53:41] he's stalking game he's hunting he may
[53:43] be getting rained on it may be cold he
[53:45] may be hungry himself he's got to shoot
[53:47] it he's got to gut it he's got to skin
[53:49] it he's got to prepare it Esau's
[53:53] working yeah I almost say he's working
[53:55] his tail off is that bad to say in the
[53:56] pull
[54:00] pit he's working Jacob's doing
[54:09] nothing I tell you being a predestinated
[54:12] child of God is the greatest privilege
[54:15] in the world the greatest privilege in
[54:16] the universe for all eternity there's
[54:18] nothing like it friends there's nothing
[54:20] like it it's God's choicing it's God
[54:23] pouring himself out it's God's family
[54:25] it's God's decision and God is
[54:27] orchestrating all the events and why do
[54:29] we just keep stipping into things why is
[54:31] it it just keeps happening to us how was
[54:33] it we bumped into the message why was it
[54:35] that all of a sudden out of billions of
[54:37] people on the planet we met somebody who
[54:39] would give us a message but how did that
[54:41] happen God was orchestrating that and
[54:44] how was it when Millions turn it away
[54:46] there's something down inside of you
[54:48] that would thump like that when you
[54:49] would read the word when you would hear
[54:51] the prophecy all of a sudden something
[54:53] in you would click and you would know
[54:55] that's nothing but the truth what is
[54:57] that that's not you it came so easy for
[55:00] [Applause]
[55:02] you we think it's hard because of the
[55:05] trials of life that's different than
[55:07] believing believing came
[55:09] easy Revelation came easy Revelation
[55:13] didn't come hard believing didn't come
[55:15] hard amen there's a lot of other things
[55:17] in this world that have come hard and
[55:18] that we've struggled with and Jacob had
[55:20] his own struggles but believing the word
[55:22] that didn't come with a struggle that
[55:24] didn't come hard amen that come
[55:30] easy wasn't just so easy for Jacob it's
[55:33] been easy for you and
[55:37] I praise be to
[55:40] God he
[55:42] goes with this deception to his
[55:45] father in verse let's go down to verse
[55:51] 27
[55:54] 26
[55:55] and his father Isaac said unto him come
[55:57] near now and kiss me my son and he came
[56:00] near and he kissed him and he smelled
[56:02] the smell of his reignment and blessed
[56:04] him and said see the smell of my son is
[56:06] as the smell of the field which the Lord
[56:08] hath blessed therefore God give thee
[56:11] This Is Here Comes The
[56:12] Blessing therefore God give thee of the
[56:15] Dew of Heaven and the fatness of the
[56:17] earth and plenty of corn and wine let
[56:20] people serve thee and Nations bow down
[56:22] to thee be Lord over thy brethren and
[56:25] let thy mother's sons bow down to thee
[56:27] cursed be everyone that curseth thee and
[56:30] blessed be he that blesseth
[56:34] thee and it came to pass as soon as
[56:37] Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob
[56:39] and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from
[56:41] the presence of Isaac his father that
[56:43] Esau his brother came in from his
[56:48] hunting barely got away with
[56:52] it no he didn't barely get away with it
[56:54] God was orchestrating the whole thing
[56:57] the timing was perfect you say if you
[56:59] got there one minute earlier the whole
[57:01] thing no it was all orchestrated by
[57:06] God brother BM said in questions and
[57:09] answers from 59 he says now look you
[57:11] here let me show you examples to be sure
[57:13] now we want to keep it in the scriptures
[57:15] while we're on this uh on these Spirits
[57:18] Esau was a far better man in every way
[57:20] you want to take it than Jacob was now
[57:23] Esau now he's going to talk about about
[57:25] Jacob he said God forgive me for this
[57:26] remark he's going to say some bad things
[57:27] about Jacob he was just a little sneaker
[57:30] that's all now you if you'll notice him
[57:33] what was he a little tattletail a big
[57:35] liar if I'm saying wrong God forgive me
[57:38] but he did lie and cheat there never was
[57:40] one like him hardly when he took them
[57:42] speckled sticks and even put them in the
[57:44] water to cause the pregnant pregnated
[57:46] cattle and sheep over there to bring
[57:48] forth speckled sheep and speckled cattle
[57:50] to get them on his own hands what did he
[57:52] do he put Esau's coat on him and a piece
[57:54] pie of sheep skin and everything else
[57:56] and went up there and impersonated Esau
[57:58] before his blind Father which was a
[57:59] prophet is that right why he was a
[58:02] little Shyer he really
[58:04] was he said I ought maybe I oughtn't to
[58:07] say to have said it that way see I don't
[58:09] mean it that way I'll take that back he
[58:11] he was I don't know you know what he was
[58:13] just think in your mind he he was a
[58:16] great man of God and I don't want to say
[58:17] anything bad about him but I'm just
[58:19] trying to point
[58:20] out little things that he did just look
[58:23] how sneaky he was a liar sure he was
[58:26] terrible but what was he trying to do
[58:29] look at Esau Esau was a good man moral a
[58:32] good church member today what did he do
[58:34] he was a hunter he went out course then
[58:36] that's how they made their living he'd
[58:38] take care of his herds for his father
[58:39] his daddy was blind a prophet the
[58:42] prophet of the Lord was blind and
[58:43] deceived by his own son a prophet Isaac
[58:46] through him came Christ you can call him
[58:48] Prophet Bible said he was and he was
[58:50] blind why didn't he heal himself and why
[58:53] didn't he know that that was that that
[58:56] was uh Jacob instead of Esau see God
[58:59] don't tell His prophets everything he
[59:01] just tells them what he wants them to
[59:05] know God was working out a plan then and
[59:08] he had to work in it if you'll submit
[59:11] yourself to God God will make you work
[59:13] right into his
[59:17] plan man starts to say he was a prophet
[59:20] he says why didn't he heal himself why
[59:21] was he
[59:23] blind why did blindness come to
[59:27] Isaac because God knew how to get the
[59:29] blessing to
[59:30] Jacob
[59:32] amen God was working the whole
[59:37] time why who what
[59:41] inspiration inspired
[59:46] Rebecca I don't know she was moved to
[59:49] come up with a plan of
[59:51] deception and she was willing to stand
[59:53] in the Gap and some times I wonder was
[59:55] it because she knew the prophecy when
[59:57] she inquired of the Lord is that what
[59:58] motivated her did she know that the
[1:00:01] promise was to the younger and that's
[1:00:03] why I don't know I can't say for sure
[1:00:05] but some way she was moved when she
[1:00:07] heard she instantly went into action and
[1:00:09] her plan was a good plan and it worked
[1:00:11] and the timing was just
[1:00:13] right the fact that she would say he'll
[1:00:16] smell his clothes here's a garment feel
[1:00:18] his hand here's the hair here's the
[1:00:19] Savory meat here's everything we need
[1:00:21] and it worked
[1:00:23] perfect you you know even at first amen
[1:00:26] Isaac wasn't even totally giv over at
[1:00:28] first when Jacob come in he he he talked
[1:00:32] to him and he says art thou truly Esau
[1:00:33] he said truly I am I am thy son Esau
[1:00:36] I've brought you the venison you asked
[1:00:37] for and he said come here to me and he
[1:00:39] smelled him and he F him he says thy
[1:00:42] hands are Esau's but thy voice is
[1:00:50] Jacob's but yet although he is
[1:00:53] suspicious God knocked out a
[1:00:58] suspicion why God was working a
[1:01:00] plan so that so that Jacob could just
[1:01:04] step into what God had for him yeah
[1:01:07] without work without
[1:01:09] strain just to walk into
[1:01:13] it let's go to Proverbs 16
[1:01:23] together
[1:01:34] Proverbs
[1:01:35] 16 and verse
[1:01:38] 9 a man's heart deviseth his way but the
[1:01:41] Lord directeth his
[1:01:44] steps I don't know about you but I had a
[1:01:46] lot of devising when I was young a lot
[1:01:49] of plans for my life a lot of directions
[1:01:51] I knew I would go and accomplishes that
[1:01:53] I make but I can tell you this a man
[1:01:55] deviseth his way in his heart of a man
[1:01:57] devises the way but the Lord directeth
[1:01:59] his steps my steps were not directed by
[1:02:02] my devising of my heart my steps were
[1:02:04] directed by God's predestinated
[1:02:08] plan let's go to Philippians chapter
[1:02:20] 2 Philippians chapter
[1:02:23] 2
[1:02:27] let's read verse
[1:02:30] 13 in Philippians 213 it says for it is
[1:02:33] God which worketh in you both to Will
[1:02:36] and to do of his good
[1:02:39] pleasure you know all the all those good
[1:02:41] works we take pride
[1:02:44] in that wasn't
[1:02:46] us it is God that worketh in us both to
[1:02:49] do and the will of his good pleasure if
[1:02:51] we ever if we ever keep the word of God
[1:02:54] it was the spirit of God in us amen
[1:02:56] anointing the seed that was in us to
[1:02:58] perform the word it wasn't us it was
[1:03:03] God and so we can't we can't take credit
[1:03:07] amen just because I mean just because I
[1:03:10] stopped sinning and I stopped a sinful
[1:03:11] lifestyle and I I turned to the Lord
[1:03:13] that wasn't me that was all
[1:03:16] him it was him uh it was him working in
[1:03:20] me both to Will and to do of his good
[1:03:23] pleasure
[1:03:25] I and myself would have destroyed myself
[1:03:28] let's go back to chapter 1 here in
[1:03:30] Philippians chapter 1:
[1:03:34] 6
[1:03:37] says being confident of this very thing
[1:03:39] that he which has begun a good work in
[1:03:41] you will perform it until the day of
[1:03:44] Jesus Christ who's begun the work he
[1:03:48] begun it who's going to finish it he's
[1:03:50] going to finish it who's the author of
[1:03:51] our faith he is who's the finisher of
[1:03:53] our faith he is amen we're not The
[1:03:55] Originators we're not the one doing the
[1:03:57] work he's the one doing the work the
[1:03:59] only thing we can do is surrender to him
[1:04:01] and the only reason we have a heart to
[1:04:03] surrender is because he's already put it
[1:04:04] inside of
[1:04:07] us hey guess what Jacob wasn't the only
[1:04:11] heel Grabber I was born a heel Grabber
[1:04:13] amen I was born an overtaker I'm not
[1:04:16] going to be left behind amen what I'm
[1:04:18] not going to miss out I'm not going to
[1:04:19] miss the birthright I'm not going to
[1:04:21] miss the blessing and where did that
[1:04:23] desire even come from it did not come
[1:04:25] from my parents it wasn't passed down
[1:04:27] genetically that is not where that
[1:04:28] desire came from that desire came from a
[1:04:30] seed Gene of God that he planted in my
[1:04:33] soul before the foundation of the world
[1:04:35] and knew that it would come forth in
[1:04:36] this season and then I I would be
[1:04:38] willing Amen to give up whatever Amen to
[1:04:41] have that word what was that that was
[1:04:46] him and no matter what desire we had no
[1:04:50] matter how much Jacob desired the
[1:04:52] birthright no matter matter how much it
[1:04:54] was in him to have it unless God
[1:04:57] orchestrated all of the details he would
[1:04:59] never have
[1:05:00] it it didn't it wasn't just wanting it
[1:05:03] amen it wasn't just the ability to
[1:05:05] receive amen that that had to work he
[1:05:07] had the ability to receive he had the
[1:05:09] right desire from birth he had something
[1:05:12] in him planted there by God Amen that
[1:05:14] was there but that wasn't enough because
[1:05:16] that alone still couldn't that still
[1:05:19] couldn't have the birthright on its own
[1:05:21] it took God not just working inside of
[1:05:23] Jacob but it took God working outside of
[1:05:26] Jacob to bring these two things together
[1:05:28] to accomplish God's purpose in his life
[1:05:31] and what did Jacob have to do
[1:05:34] nothing it just came so easy for him am
[1:05:38] oh praise
[1:05:39] God let's go
[1:05:42] back to Genesis
[1:05:47] 28 we find in Genesis 27 that when Esau
[1:05:52] comes in he's sorely disappointed
[1:05:54] he's so upset and hurt by what happened
[1:05:57] with his brother he vows to kill him
[1:06:01] after the morning of his father is over
[1:06:03] he he and then he weeps to his father
[1:06:06] and says father is there not yet one
[1:06:09] more blessing do you not yet have a
[1:06:11] blessing for me and his father said what
[1:06:13] more can I do I mean it's it's as if
[1:06:17] Isaac uh relinquished amen he realized
[1:06:20] this was God I've already given the
[1:06:22] blessing he has the birth I've already
[1:06:24] given the blessing what what can I do
[1:06:26] and he's crying out for more why because
[1:06:29] Esau is still relying on the carnal and
[1:06:32] he's still seeking the carinal he
[1:06:34] doesn't realize it's all over with it's
[1:06:36] all done he's got the birthright he's
[1:06:38] got the blessing you are a finished man
[1:06:41] you are not chosen he is chosen and
[1:06:43] you're not but he's still religious and
[1:06:45] he still thinks all the good works that
[1:06:47] he's done should equal
[1:06:50] something this is a carnal believer he's
[1:06:53] still thinking all that I did and the
[1:06:54] venison I got and I took care of you all
[1:06:56] these years and I've gone to church and
[1:06:58] I raised my family and I didn't lie and
[1:07:00] I didn't steal it still should be is
[1:07:02] there not yet a blessing and he doesn't
[1:07:04] even recognize he's a finished man he's
[1:07:06] outside the promise the promise of
[1:07:08] Abraham doesn't belong to him anymore
[1:07:10] he's not in the lineage of Christ he's
[1:07:12] no longer part of the
[1:07:13] word but still crying for his not not
[1:07:17] that the birthright not to forgive me
[1:07:19] but just bless me yeah yeah I do not
[1:07:24] want to be that kind of believer amen I
[1:07:26] want to be one that strives for the word
[1:07:28] for the reality for the promise for the
[1:07:30] spiritual
[1:07:32] things God God loves the bless his
[1:07:35] children we know that and God will
[1:07:36] shower and has showered and I believe
[1:07:38] will continue to shower blessings upon
[1:07:40] me but if he doesn't shower physical
[1:07:42] blessings on me that's not what my heart
[1:07:44] is Desiring the most I'm craving eternal
[1:07:47] life I'm craving Christ I'm craving the
[1:07:49] reality of God that's what's in my heart
[1:07:52] that's what I've got to have whether I'm
[1:07:54] comfortable in this life or not
[1:07:55] comfortable in this life whether I get
[1:07:57] corn from Heaven whether the Dew of
[1:07:59] Heaven falls on me and the corn of the
[1:08:01] land makes me fat whether all of that
[1:08:03] works out or not I have got to have
[1:08:05] eternal life I've got to lay hold on
[1:08:08] Christ
[1:08:09] himself and where did that desire come
[1:08:12] from it didn't come from my
[1:08:14] lineage and my natural lineage that
[1:08:18] comes from
[1:08:19] God so after he finds out that Esau
[1:08:23] Jacob finds out Esau's threatened his
[1:08:25] life and he's angry he flees and his
[1:08:28] mother comes and works another
[1:08:32] plan when I really started looking at it
[1:08:34] I realized how little Jacob
[1:08:38] did now his mother's going to try to
[1:08:40] save his life because his brother wants
[1:08:42] to kill him so she goes to Isaac and
[1:08:46] says
[1:08:47] Isaac I these all these girls around
[1:08:50] here Vex my soul none of them's good
[1:08:52] enough for our son why why don't you
[1:08:54] send our son back to my country and so
[1:08:57] that he can find a wife and Isaac said
[1:08:59] that's a good plan and and and he
[1:09:01] doesn't realize amen that God is still
[1:09:06] working she's not being straightforward
[1:09:09] with him she's not being completely
[1:09:12] honest Isaac now brings Jacob in and
[1:09:16] blesses him and sends him off to find a
[1:09:19] wife that wasn't Jacob's
[1:09:22] plan that was God's plan
[1:09:26] now Jacob leaves and he
[1:09:29] stops and he's tired let's go to chapter
[1:09:32] 28:
[1:09:34] 10 chapter
[1:09:37] 28 verse
[1:09:41] 10 and Jacob went out from berseba and
[1:09:44] went towards Heron and he lighted upon a
[1:09:47] certain place and Terri there all night
[1:09:48] because the sun was set and he took of
[1:09:50] the stones of the place and put them for
[1:09:52] his pillows and lay down in the that
[1:09:54] place to sleep and he dreamed and behold
[1:09:56] a ladder set up on the earth and the top
[1:09:58] of it reached to heaven and behold the
[1:10:00] angels of God ascending and descending
[1:10:02] on it and
[1:10:04] behold the Lord stood above it and said
[1:10:07] I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father
[1:10:11] the god of Isaac the land wherein thou
[1:10:13] liest to thee will I give it and to thy
[1:10:16] seed and thy seed shall be as the dust
[1:10:18] of the earth and thou shalt spread
[1:10:20] abroad to the west and to the East and
[1:10:22] to the north and to the South and in
[1:10:24] thee and in thy seed shall all the
[1:10:25] families of the earth be blessed and
[1:10:28] behold I am with thee and will keep thee
[1:10:31] in all places whether thou go whe
[1:10:33] whether thou goest and will bring thee
[1:10:35] again into this land for I will not
[1:10:37] leave thee until I have done that which
[1:10:39] I have spoken to thee
[1:10:41] of and Jacob awake out of his sleep and
[1:10:44] he said surely the Lord is in this place
[1:10:47] and I knew it
[1:10:49] not and he was afraid and said how
[1:10:52] Dreadful is this place this is none
[1:10:54] other but the house of God and this is
[1:10:56] the Gate of
[1:10:58] Heaven Jacob was running now from the
[1:11:02] threats of his brother he was sent by
[1:11:05] his father to go find a wife and in the
[1:11:07] route he gets tired he journeyed as much
[1:11:09] as he can Journey that day and he just
[1:11:11] happens to stop in a certain place and
[1:11:13] this is going to become bethl which
[1:11:15] means the house of God before that it
[1:11:16] was L Lu Z and he just stops there for
[1:11:19] no reason he just stops there and he
[1:11:21] lays himself down and while he's laying
[1:11:23] himself down all of a sudden in the
[1:11:25] dream Heaven
[1:11:27] opens what did Jacob do to earn this
[1:11:30] dream right and all of a sudden he sees
[1:11:34] a ladder amen coming from Heaven to the
[1:11:36] ground and Angels ascending and
[1:11:37] descending on the ladder and all the
[1:11:39] sudden God speaks from heaven and God
[1:11:41] says hey I'm going to bless you and I
[1:11:44] blessed your father Abraham and Isaac
[1:11:45] and now the promise I promised to them
[1:11:47] I'm promising to you and by the way
[1:11:49] whereever you go I'm going to be with
[1:11:51] you and I will stay with you all the the
[1:11:53] way until I bring you back into this
[1:11:55] land I'm going with you and I'm bringing
[1:11:58] you back into this land and my promise
[1:12:00] is on you and I'll never leave you and
[1:12:02] I'll never forsake you and I'm your God
[1:12:05] and you're going to get the promise and
[1:12:06] you're going to spread out of their land
[1:12:07] and you're going to become as dust and
[1:12:09] what did Jacob do what did Jacob do he
[1:12:12] did nothing he laid down to fall asleep
[1:12:15] and when he woke up he said surely this
[1:12:18] is the house of God and I knew it not I
[1:12:20] didn't even know where I was laying down
[1:12:22] I had no idea this was a special place I
[1:12:25] just laid down to sleep and all of a
[1:12:27] sudden God came God opened the heavens
[1:12:29] God spoke the
[1:12:33] prophecy praise God and we think we
[1:12:36] found the
[1:12:38] message and we found the
[1:12:40] truth and I was a seeker and I was a
[1:12:43] Searcher and I was looking for this and
[1:12:45] I was looking for that you know what we
[1:12:47] were looking for we were looking for the
[1:12:49] most convenient church that gave us
[1:12:51] exactly what satisfied us if we were
[1:12:54] seeking at all that's what we were
[1:12:55] seeking
[1:12:57] for we didn't find the message we didn't
[1:13:00] find I mean it found
[1:13:03] us what did we do what did we do amen
[1:13:07] what really when we think about what did
[1:13:09] we do to be witnessed to what did we do
[1:13:11] to hear something just a some strange
[1:13:14] way we heard something we heard a name
[1:13:15] or somebody mentioned something or
[1:13:18] or how did it happen I mean how did it
[1:13:21] happen that we just decid
[1:13:23] to go this way one day and we heard this
[1:13:26] or we we took this job and met a person
[1:13:28] or
[1:13:29] we we went to get a haircut from a
[1:13:32] certain Barber amen or we looked up an
[1:13:35] old phone book and found a church I mean
[1:13:37] how does this happen how hard is this
[1:13:40] how much work does it take it doesn't
[1:13:42] take work it takes the predestinated
[1:13:44] plan of God to hunt out the seed of God
[1:13:47] and make sure that you you come into the
[1:13:49] house of God and you didn't even know it
[1:13:51] amen this I I'm in the the place of God
[1:13:54] and I didn't even know it and God's
[1:13:55] promising blessings He Knows My Name he
[1:13:57] knows who I am and he has a plan for me
[1:13:59] and I didn't even know
[1:14:04] it for Jacob it was just so
[1:14:09] easy he goes down to laan and finds a
[1:14:12] wife and we know there boy some trouble
[1:14:14] starts some trouble
[1:14:17] starts and you know he works and going
[1:14:20] to get a wife the wife of his choosing
[1:14:22] but his father-in-law pulled a little
[1:14:24] Switcheroo on him and he got the older
[1:14:26] daughter and then he had to work seven
[1:14:27] more years for the for the one of his
[1:14:29] choice and then we know all of these but
[1:14:32] then we know that he makes a plan with
[1:14:35] laan so he can start Gathering some
[1:14:37] wealth because he's been working for
[1:14:38] these daughters and he doesn't have
[1:14:41] anything and laan is is really uh he's
[1:14:45] pulling a good one on
[1:14:46] him and I think it's wonderful that God
[1:14:49] knows exactly how to train
[1:14:52] us
[1:14:55] Jacob was the one pulling all the little
[1:14:58] deals he was the master Shyer so who
[1:15:02] should he have to go to for a wife but
[1:15:04] the more Master
[1:15:08] Shyer sometimes God makes us face
[1:15:13] ourselves so he's got all these tricks
[1:15:15] but even in that God was blessing
[1:15:18] him remember when he comes to Laban and
[1:15:20] Laban comes hunting after him when he
[1:15:21] leaves he runs away and and he tells
[1:15:24] laan what have I done what have I done
[1:15:26] wrong you've changed my wages these 10
[1:15:28] times you kept changing it and what
[1:15:31] would happen is they would make a deal
[1:15:33] that all the ring stri all the ring stri
[1:15:36] cattle the goats and the Sheep they
[1:15:38] would go to Jacob and all the solid
[1:15:41] colors they would go to laan then they
[1:15:43] started having more rest strength so
[1:15:45] then then laan would change and say
[1:15:47] spotted now it's spotted now you have
[1:15:49] the spotted cattle then all of a sudden
[1:15:51] they started coming out spotted yeah and
[1:15:54] he kept changing it but no matter what
[1:15:56] he changed it to God blessed the efforts
[1:15:58] of Jacob and it started producing so
[1:16:00] that Jacob actually laan's Sons started
[1:16:03] getting upset and the reason that Jacob
[1:16:05] knew he had to go is because the sons
[1:16:07] were getting furious because they saw
[1:16:09] that Jacob was stealing all their
[1:16:11] father's wealth and these boys were
[1:16:12] going to be left with nothing Jacob
[1:16:14] wasn't stealing it every plan they came
[1:16:16] up with worked in Jacob's
[1:16:20] favor I'll take ring strike okay ring
[1:16:22] strike no no no no I no now now you get
[1:16:24] spotted okay I'll take spotted and how
[1:16:26] was it that the birth rate just changed
[1:16:29] yeah God said I'll be with you withs
[1:16:32] soever thou
[1:16:36] goest it was time to come back into the
[1:16:39] land the circumstances the Press got so
[1:16:42] hard it was pressing him back to the
[1:16:44] promised land God was orchestrating that
[1:16:49] too when he goes running back laan gets
[1:16:52] angry
[1:16:53] cuz he stole away without permission and
[1:16:55] he ran and laan starts to pursue him and
[1:16:58] as laan comes near to overtaking him God
[1:17:01] comes to Laban in a dream and says you
[1:17:04] be careful about that boy say nothing
[1:17:07] about him neither good nor
[1:17:12] bad so when laan come after him with his
[1:17:16] servants Jacob couldn't defend himself
[1:17:19] Jacob couldn't do anything with his
[1:17:21] father-in-law God had already done it
[1:17:23] for
[1:17:25] him everything came so easy for
[1:17:28] Jacob I don't mean he didn't have
[1:17:30] struggles it don't mean he didn't have
[1:17:31] Strife don't mean he didn't have family
[1:17:33] tensions doesn't mean but when it really
[1:17:35] came to the plan of God everything just
[1:17:38] happened he didn't make it happen it
[1:17:41] just
[1:17:42] happened it's not what he did it's what
[1:17:44] happened to
[1:17:46] him now as he's he de God deals with
[1:17:49] laan Laban leaves him and now he's going
[1:17:52] on to the land and and they catch his
[1:17:53] word that his brother's coming with 400
[1:17:55] I think it is or whatever armed men
[1:17:57] they're coming after him and and he
[1:17:59] remembers the old promise that I'm going
[1:18:00] to slay and and and he's frightened for
[1:18:02] his life and he divides his company into
[1:18:05] different arrangements and he goes by
[1:18:07] himself over the brook and when he's
[1:18:09] over the brook what should happen he's
[1:18:11] there in agony he's there in distress
[1:18:12] he's there in worry and and everything
[1:18:15] is is coming to a head now between him
[1:18:17] and his brother and he doesn't know
[1:18:18] what's going to happen and he's going to
[1:18:19] try to appease his brother with gifts
[1:18:21] but he doesn't know if the gifts will
[1:18:22] work and over here in this strain I mean
[1:18:24] he's in agony and no doubt he's pacing
[1:18:27] up and down by the side of the creek
[1:18:28] then all of a sudden what should happen
[1:18:30] then a man should appear Jacob didn't
[1:18:33] make that man appear Jacob didn't know
[1:18:35] where to go he didn't know what door to
[1:18:37] knock on he didn't know where to get
[1:18:39] help he didn't know where the rescue
[1:18:40] squad was he didn't know where to find
[1:18:42] God Amen but in the time of need God
[1:18:45] came to him Amen in the form of a man
[1:18:47] and he wrestled with an angel till the
[1:18:49] break of day and then he wrestled with
[1:18:51] that angel and the angel said let me go
[1:18:52] he said I will not let you go till you
[1:18:54] bless me amen and he reached down and
[1:18:56] touched the hollow of his thigh amen and
[1:18:58] it strength the sen you thereof so that
[1:19:00] from that day forward Jacob halted on
[1:19:03] his leg he had a different walk because
[1:19:05] he said I met God face to face amen how
[1:19:08] did Jacob go to that meeting how did he
[1:19:10] arrange the meeting where did he send
[1:19:12] for the itinerary what what what what
[1:19:14] office did he send an email to what door
[1:19:16] did he knock on he didn't have anything
[1:19:19] to do with it he was just moving but God
[1:19:21] had a plan for his life and as he was
[1:19:23] moving God would come down and God would
[1:19:26] come to him in his time of need and God
[1:19:28] would arrest
[1:19:32] him see how easy it was for
[1:19:36] Jacob what could he have done how could
[1:19:38] he have made it happen how could he have
[1:19:40] figured all of this out how could he
[1:19:42] have orchestrated his life this way he
[1:19:44] could have never done it on his own it
[1:19:46] was
[1:19:51] gone that's not just for
[1:19:56] Jacob that's for all of
[1:20:00] us sometimes we think we've really done
[1:20:02] something we haven't done
[1:20:06] anything we think well we've made
[1:20:08] sacrifices and we've left jobs and and
[1:20:11] we've made moves and
[1:20:14] listen we haven't done
[1:20:18] anything it's he that worketh in us both
[1:20:21] the will and the do of his good
[1:20:23] amen a man's heart devises his way but
[1:20:25] the Lord directed his steps Jacob didn't
[1:20:28] Jacob didn't figure out how to get the
[1:20:30] birthright he didn't figure out how to
[1:20:32] get the blessing he didn't figure out
[1:20:34] how to get his wife he didn't figure out
[1:20:36] how to save himself from his
[1:20:39] brother he didn't figure out how to
[1:20:41] change his walk he didn't figure out how
[1:20:43] to change his name he didn't figure out
[1:20:45] any of this God already had it figured
[1:20:47] out before the foundation of the world
[1:20:48] and knew every Junction of time that he
[1:20:50] would inject himself into Jacob's story
[1:20:52] to keep Jacob turning
[1:20:56] right when Jesus Christ was
[1:20:59] here he was he was walking by the Sea of
[1:21:05] Galilee and he needed
[1:21:09] disciples so he said I think I'll take
[1:21:11] some
[1:21:12] resumés and I'll set up a little table
[1:21:15] over here by the side of the market and
[1:21:17] we'll start doing open
[1:21:20] interviews because I need some disciples
[1:21:23] no he knew exactly where his disciples
[1:21:25] were he knew before he came in flesh
[1:21:28] where they were he knew who they would
[1:21:29] be and he knew where to find them so one
[1:21:31] day he's walking down by the fisherman
[1:21:33] cleaning out their Nets and he looked to
[1:21:34] Andrew and he looked to Peter and he
[1:21:36] says hey come follow me you know what
[1:21:40] the Bible says they dropped their
[1:21:45] Nets there was no interview process
[1:21:47] there was no debate there was no
[1:21:49] dialogue amen God knew where to find his
[1:21:52] disciples and what was inside of Andrew
[1:21:55] and Peter what was inside of those men
[1:21:58] they were working with their livelihood
[1:21:59] they were supporting their family no
[1:22:01] doubt they had obligations no doubt they
[1:22:03] had things they had to pay for they
[1:22:04] didn't know maybe how two meals later
[1:22:06] was going to come how they were going to
[1:22:08] provide amen but it didn't matter there
[1:22:10] was already something inside of them
[1:22:12] when they heard that voice say come
[1:22:14] follow me and I'll make you Fishers of
[1:22:15] Men there was something in them that let
[1:22:18] them turn loose of the fishing that you
[1:22:20] realize that wasn't just dropping some
[1:22:22] cloth amen they were dropping their life
[1:22:24] they were dropping their livelihood they
[1:22:26] were dropping their ability to care for
[1:22:28] themselves what was in those men that
[1:22:30] gave them the ability to turn loose of
[1:22:33] everything they knew they were fisherman
[1:22:35] from the time they were babies their
[1:22:36] father was a fisherman their grandfather
[1:22:38] might have been a fisherman oh
[1:22:42] yeah something happened inside of them
[1:22:45] at the voice of the Lord calling when he
[1:22:47] called to them specifically and said you
[1:22:49] follow me something inside of them where
[1:22:52] did that come from he couldn't get the
[1:22:53] Pharisees to do that you couldn't get
[1:22:55] the the chief Elders to do that you
[1:22:57] couldn't get numerous other peoples to
[1:22:59] do that but at one word from this man
[1:23:02] they dropped their net and followed him
[1:23:03] he went down a little further and he
[1:23:05] saws the sons of Zebedee James and John
[1:23:07] and they were there working too and he
[1:23:09] said follow me they did the same thing
[1:23:11] they left their father they left their
[1:23:12] boat they left everything and followed
[1:23:14] him why because they were predestinated
[1:23:17] to follow them it wasn't their great
[1:23:20] sacrifice it was inside of them to
[1:23:26] sacrifice amen and he's a good God he
[1:23:29] puts inside of us am mean he worketh in
[1:23:31] us both the will and do of his good
[1:23:33] pleasure he puts inside of us a seed
[1:23:35] Gene of God to believe he puts inside of
[1:23:37] us ears to hear amen and then when we
[1:23:39] just do what comes natural for the seed
[1:23:41] to do then He blesses us for our
[1:23:44] obedience and it wasn't us it was
[1:23:47] him that's how wonderful the savior is
[1:23:50] that we serve he puts in you he worketh
[1:23:53] in you both the will and do of his good
[1:23:54] pleasure he directeth your steps he for
[1:23:57] ordained every Junction of time he put
[1:23:59] inside of you something to believe with
[1:24:01] and then when you believe and you
[1:24:02] surrender then he showers blessings in
[1:24:05] you for
[1:24:10] obedience What A Savior what a plan I
[1:24:13] tell you there's nothing like being a
[1:24:15] child of God there is nothing better
[1:24:17] there's nothing greater there's no
[1:24:18] accomplishment in life it's the greatest
[1:24:20] thing we will ever have ever will ever
[1:24:23] can ever experience it's God working in
[1:24:26] us it's God protecting us it's God
[1:24:29] leading us it's God defending us it's
[1:24:31] God working in us and then it's God
[1:24:33] praising us and showering us with
[1:24:36] blessings
[1:24:38] wonderful it's benefit upon benefit upon
[1:24:41] benefit upon
[1:24:44] benefit and we walk away from something
[1:24:47] like that and think we did something on
[1:24:49] and brag about it and tell people well I
[1:24:52] get gave up this to have this and I
[1:24:54] sacrifice oh my
[1:24:57] goodness I'm so tired of that esol
[1:25:00] nature I'm so I'm so sick of that one in
[1:25:03] me that's always trying to take credit
[1:25:04] for what God's
[1:25:07] done God did it beginning to end he
[1:25:10] foresaw before the foundation of the
[1:25:12] world he orchestrated all the events can
[1:25:14] you imagine can you imagine Jacob amen
[1:25:17] talking to the the the sons of laan over
[1:25:19] there his brother-in-law and he's over
[1:25:21] there bragging you should seen that
[1:25:22] trick I pulled on my brother
[1:25:25] Esau you know Dad he was a little
[1:25:27] suspicious at the beginning but I
[1:25:29] smoothed it
[1:25:30] out and we pulled off this plan
[1:25:34] and I wonder if he had the nerve to say
[1:25:36] my mommy came up with this plan and and
[1:25:41] I I never even thought of such a thing I
[1:25:43] had no
[1:25:46] idea the question is what would how
[1:25:48] would the conversation go later if it
[1:25:49] was us yeah right
[1:25:54] yeah I said and then I did and then he
[1:25:56] said and then she said and then I said
[1:25:58] and
[1:26:04] then and all a sudden it looks like it's
[1:26:07] a blessing for God to have somebody as
[1:26:09] wise as us and as gifted as we
[1:26:13] are that's the way we make it
[1:26:18] sound God's so lucky to have me cuz I
[1:26:21] figured this out and I said that and
[1:26:23] just at the right time I just said you
[1:26:26] know word fitly spoken you know as
[1:26:29] apples were
[1:26:33] gold God help
[1:26:36] us God help us help us to recognize how
[1:26:40] good he is to us how much he loves us
[1:26:42] and what he's done for us let's just
[1:26:45] surrender more and even the ability
[1:26:47] surrender comes from
[1:26:51] him
[1:26:53] Jesus says in John 15:16 he says to his
[1:26:56] disciples you have not chosen me but I
[1:26:59] have chosen
[1:27:01] you and ordained you that you should go
[1:27:05] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[1:27:07] should remain and whatsoever you shall
[1:27:10] ask the father in my name he may give it
[1:27:12] you he said I've ordained you you
[1:27:15] haven't chosen me I chose
[1:27:20] you and or ordained you yeah that you
[1:27:23] should go forth and bring forth fruit so
[1:27:25] I have already ordained you to manifest
[1:27:29] my life yeah and the fruit that you
[1:27:32] bring forth I've already ordained that
[1:27:33] it shall
[1:27:37] remain and if you ask anything in my
[1:27:40] name ask father anything in my name
[1:27:41] he'll give it to
[1:27:43] you amen can you imagine Peter coming to
[1:27:46] the end of his
[1:27:48] life and he starts to go through his
[1:27:51] achievements I brought forth fruit and
[1:27:54] that work that I did it remains to this
[1:27:59] day that wasn't
[1:28:01] Peter that was God said I've ordained
[1:28:04] you to bring forth fruit and I've
[1:28:08] ordained that your fruit will remain not
[1:28:10] because you did a good job not the
[1:28:13] church isn't still standing and going
[1:28:15] years after you founded it because you
[1:28:17] did a good job founding it because he
[1:28:19] ordained you to bring forth fruit and he
[1:28:20] ordained that fruit to
[1:28:28] remain when the whole
[1:28:31] world was curious about Jesus and not
[1:28:34] sure about his identity Jesus asked a
[1:28:37] question to his disciples whom do men
[1:28:39] say that I am they said some this some
[1:28:41] this some that and he says but whom do
[1:28:43] you say that I am and and Simon says
[1:28:45] Thou Art Christ the son of the Living
[1:28:47] God and he says blessed are you Simon
[1:28:50] barjona for flesh and blood has not
[1:28:53] revealed this to you but my Father which
[1:28:54] is in heaven has revealed it to
[1:28:57] you Peter couldn't brag about his
[1:29:00] Revelation it didn't come from him it
[1:29:02] came from the
[1:29:09] father it's amazing that
[1:29:13] Peter after he'd be chosen by God he
[1:29:15] didn't choose himself God chose
[1:29:18] him God gave him the authority and the
[1:29:20] power to cast out devils
[1:29:23] he sent them two by two and he he
[1:29:25] ordained them and anointed them with the
[1:29:27] power to go forth and told them exactly
[1:29:29] what they do and they went and did it
[1:29:30] exactly like he said and it worked and
[1:29:32] they came back rejoicing that Devils
[1:29:33] were subject unto
[1:29:35] them they had meetings and campaigns and
[1:29:38] they were closely associated with Jesus
[1:29:39] until Peter's heart became lifted up and
[1:29:43] he became proud and he began to think
[1:29:44] that these were his
[1:29:46] achievements and that he was a good guy
[1:29:49] and that even if all forsake you yet yet
[1:29:52] I'll not forsake
[1:29:54] you he didn't realize every bit of what
[1:29:57] he had was the grace of God every work
[1:29:59] that he done was ordained of God his
[1:30:01] calling was ordained of God the ability
[1:30:04] to drop his net and respond to that
[1:30:05] calling was the grace of God Amen the
[1:30:07] fruit that he bore the casting out
[1:30:09] Devils it was all by God's word by God's
[1:30:11] grace by God's ordination it wasn't by
[1:30:13] his works and he gets to the point where
[1:30:15] he thinks he's such a good believer that
[1:30:18] even when Jesus says you all forsake me
[1:30:20] he said I'm not going to everybody else
[1:30:22] might but you don't know who you're
[1:30:24] talking to this is Peter the
[1:30:28] fisherman who's probably going to be the
[1:30:31] head disciple we've been talking about
[1:30:33] it on the
[1:30:36] side he's still stuck in
[1:30:40] carnality but oh praise God he had an
[1:30:43] encounter in an upper room one
[1:30:45] day after God let him fall on his face
[1:30:47] and realized what he was in his own and
[1:30:49] then God restored him amen by the by the
[1:30:52] seaside amen and then he he fills him
[1:30:55] with the Holy Ghost and he comes out
[1:30:56] preaching and we come to acts three
[1:30:58] let's turn there together and read
[1:31:01] this I love
[1:31:04] this Acts chapter
[1:31:13] 3 acts chap
[1:31:16] 3:1 now Peter and John went up together
[1:31:18] into the temple at The Hour of Prayer
[1:31:20] being the ninth hour and a certain man
[1:31:22] lame from his mother's womb was carried
[1:31:25] whom they laid daily at the Gate of the
[1:31:26] temple which is called Beautiful to ask
[1:31:28] arms of them that entered into the
[1:31:30] temple who seeing Peter and John about
[1:31:33] to go into the temple asked an Al and
[1:31:34] Peter fastened his eyes upon him with
[1:31:36] John said look on us and he gave heed
[1:31:39] unto them expecting to receive something
[1:31:41] of them then Peter said Silver and Gold
[1:31:43] Have I None but such as I have I give I
[1:31:45] Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of
[1:31:47] Nazareth rise up and walk and he took
[1:31:50] him by the right hand and lifted him up
[1:31:52] and immediately his feet and ankle bones
[1:31:53] received strength and he leaping up
[1:31:56] stood and walked and entered with them
[1:31:57] into the temple walking and leaping and
[1:32:00] praising God and all the people saw him
[1:32:03] walking and praising God and they knew
[1:32:05] that it was he which sat for arms at the
[1:32:07] beautiful gate of the temple and they
[1:32:09] were filled with wonder and amazement at
[1:32:11] at that which had happened unto him and
[1:32:13] as the lame man which was healed held
[1:32:15] Peter and John all the people ran
[1:32:17] together unto them into the porch that
[1:32:19] is called Solomon's greatly wondering
[1:32:22] and when Peter saw it he answered unto
[1:32:24] the people ye men of Israel why Marvel
[1:32:27] you at this or why look you so earnestly
[1:32:30] on us as though by our own power or
[1:32:33] Holiness we have made this man walk the
[1:32:37] god of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob
[1:32:40] the god of our fathers had glorified his
[1:32:41] son Jesus whom you delivered and denied
[1:32:44] him in the presence of pilate when he
[1:32:45] was determined to let him go but ye
[1:32:48] denied the Holy One and the just and
[1:32:49] desired a murmur to be granted unto you
[1:32:52] and killed the Prince of Life whom God
[1:32:54] hath raised from the dead whereof we Are
[1:32:56] Witnesses and his name through faith in
[1:32:59] his name hath made this man strong whom
[1:33:01] you see and know yay the faith which is
[1:33:03] by him hath given him this perfect
[1:33:05] soundness in the presence of you
[1:33:08] all Peter finally got to the place where
[1:33:11] he realized where it all came from and
[1:33:12] he says why do you look so earnestly on
[1:33:15] us as though we did something by our own
[1:33:17] power we didn't do
[1:33:20] anything amen
[1:33:23] amen oh I I hope we can get to the place
[1:33:26] where we can really talk like this am
[1:33:28] because I mean if if God uses you to
[1:33:30] open blinded eyes and you say the prayer
[1:33:32] and you lay the hands on and you touch
[1:33:34] the man who was lame from his mother's
[1:33:36] birth and he leaps out and goes running
[1:33:38] I mean I wonder how we would retell that
[1:33:41] testimony I wonder how we would say I
[1:33:43] wonder who would get the glory at the
[1:33:45] end of the day I wonder who would look
[1:33:46] like superch Christian after we told the
[1:33:48] testimony or can we tell it the way
[1:33:50] Peter tells it don't look at me as
[1:33:52] though I did something I didn't have
[1:33:53] anything to do with it this was all done
[1:33:55] and listen he didn't say it was done
[1:33:58] because I believe God I believe the word
[1:33:59] of God he said this is done by faith in
[1:34:02] his name now let's go back and look at
[1:34:06] it verse 15 and killed the Prince of
[1:34:10] Life God ha raised him from the dead
[1:34:11] whereof we Are Witnesses and his name
[1:34:14] through faith in his name hath made this
[1:34:16] man strong whom you see and know yay now
[1:34:19] look at this the faith which is by him
[1:34:24] where did they get the faith to believe
[1:34:26] they got it by Christ Christ gave them
[1:34:28] the faith to
[1:34:30] believe it was faith in him and it was
[1:34:32] Faith by
[1:34:34] him praise be to God that's giving
[1:34:38] credit where credit is
[1:34:42] due you
[1:34:46] know how hard did Peter have to work to
[1:34:48] be
[1:34:50] called
[1:34:53] he was just washing
[1:34:55] Nets and Christ came to him how hard did
[1:34:59] Paul when he was Saul persecuting
[1:35:02] Christian how hard did he
[1:35:03] work to be saved and have an encounter
[1:35:06] with
[1:35:07] Christ he didn't work at all he was
[1:35:11] going on a on a h Carnage uh Rampage of
[1:35:15] persecuting the church and on the way
[1:35:17] Christ came to
[1:35:18] him appeared as a pillar of fire smoked
[1:35:21] him to the ground spoke to
[1:35:23] him sent him to a place where he would
[1:35:26] get the word sent ananas to him to speak
[1:35:30] to him the word and he says go thy
[1:35:33] way and tell him he's or go thy way for
[1:35:37] he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my
[1:35:41] name before the Gentiles and for
[1:35:44] Kings what did Saul do to earn that
[1:35:47] position
[1:35:48] nothing what did he do to become the the
[1:35:52] the great Apostle to the Gentiles what
[1:35:54] did he do to earn the right to to write
[1:35:56] most of the New Testament he didn't do
[1:35:58] anything amen he found himself called in
[1:36:01] Antioch that the spirit of the god came
[1:36:03] and they selected out Paul and Barnabas
[1:36:05] and sit them on a missionary campaign he
[1:36:07] went by the will of the Lord he tried to
[1:36:09] go to one city the spirit of God stopped
[1:36:11] him sent him somewhere else amen and
[1:36:13] directed his steps and he went all over
[1:36:15] amen and God added to the church such as
[1:36:17] should be
[1:36:18] saved amen amen what did Paul do nothing
[1:36:22] what did he do to write the New
[1:36:23] Testament nothing he just kept doing
[1:36:25] what God told him to do then he got
[1:36:26] arrested when he got arrested am me he
[1:36:28] was thrown in jail when he was thrown in
[1:36:29] jail he still had a concern for the
[1:36:31] saints that were out there and he
[1:36:33] started writing them letters he didn't
[1:36:34] know he was writing the Bible he was
[1:36:36] just doing as God directed him step by
[1:36:38] step Paul wasn't saying I'm going to
[1:36:40] write the Bible they're going to need a
[1:36:41] Bible amen for 2,000 years they're going
[1:36:43] to need to know what I taught he was
[1:36:45] directed by God he was led by God and
[1:36:47] that is not Paul's words anyways that's
[1:36:49] the words of Christ
[1:36:54] we hold Paul in great esteem but Paul
[1:36:55] was just doing what Paul was led to do
[1:36:58] and most of the time he didn't even know
[1:36:59] what he was doing he was just going
[1:37:00] along amen he was carried along
[1:37:02] sometimes amen even sometimes against
[1:37:04] his own will amen he couldn't take
[1:37:08] credit for his success he couldn't take
[1:37:10] credit let's look at one
[1:37:12] scripture let's look at acts
[1:37:19] 13 acts 13 and verse
[1:37:30] 46 in Acts 13:46 then Paul and Barnabas
[1:37:34] waxed bold and said it was necessary
[1:37:36] that the word of God should first have
[1:37:38] been spoken to you but seeing you put it
[1:37:40] from you and you judge yourselves
[1:37:41] Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn
[1:37:44] to the Gentiles for so hath the Lord
[1:37:47] commanded us saying I have set thee to
[1:37:49] be a light of the Gentiles that thou
[1:37:51] should us be for salvation to the ends
[1:37:52] of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard
[1:37:55] this they were glad and glorified the
[1:37:56] word of the Lord and as many as were
[1:37:59] ordained to eternal life
[1:38:04] believed how many believed all the good
[1:38:10] ones the ones who really paid close
[1:38:12] attention to Paul and didn't squirm in
[1:38:14] their seat when he was talking the ones
[1:38:16] who were literate and had already read
[1:38:18] the Bible through now you know who
[1:38:20] believed
[1:38:21] the ones who were ordained to eternal
[1:38:23] life they're the ones who believed why
[1:38:24] did they believe because they were
[1:38:26] already ordained into eternal life God
[1:38:28] had put it in them to believe and he
[1:38:30] knew when this Junction would come and
[1:38:32] he knew that they had something in them
[1:38:33] that they could
[1:38:36] believe so would it be appropriate for
[1:38:39] the Apostle
[1:38:40] Paul to
[1:38:42] say they were greatly affected by my
[1:38:46] preaching and by my preaching 50 Souls
[1:38:51] gave their heart to the
[1:38:57] Lord no as many as were ordained into
[1:39:01] eternal life
[1:39:03] believed it was all ordained by God it
[1:39:06] was orchestrated his footsteps were
[1:39:08] guided and the ones that would believe
[1:39:10] when Paul preached were already
[1:39:11] determined before the foundation of the
[1:39:15] world at the end of the day all Paul
[1:39:18] really could say was Lord thank you for
[1:39:20] keeping me
[1:39:21] me thank you for helping me not to go
[1:39:24] astray and not to fall not to fail God
[1:39:27] thank you for your grace in my life and
[1:39:28] thank you for keeping me
[1:39:33] true praise
[1:39:39] God in Matthew 11 he says if you will
[1:39:42] receive this this is Elias which was for
[1:39:44] to come he that hath ears to hear Let
[1:39:48] Him hear amen
[1:39:53] he that have ears to hear how do you get
[1:39:57] those ears to
[1:39:58] hear how do you get the eyes which can
[1:40:01] see and how do you get the ears which
[1:40:03] can hear what do you do to earn it what
[1:40:05] do you have to do do fast and pray do
[1:40:08] you go to church a bunch do you read a
[1:40:10] bunch is that how you get the ears to
[1:40:12] hear no those ears are predestinated
[1:40:15] ear there nothing wrong with praying
[1:40:18] there's nothing wrong with reading
[1:40:19] there's nothing wrong with praying for
[1:40:20] revelation but praying for Revelation
[1:40:22] won't produce Revelation if you're not
[1:40:23] ordained to
[1:40:25] Revelation brother B taught us to pray
[1:40:27] for Revelation above everything we
[1:40:28] should pray for revelation we should
[1:40:30] earnestly seek it more than anything but
[1:40:32] if it's not ordained for you to receive
[1:40:34] doesn't matter how much you pray for it
[1:40:35] you're not going to receive it because
[1:40:36] it's only for those who are ordained to
[1:40:38] receive
[1:40:39] it so even after prayer and God gives
[1:40:42] you a revelation it wasn't your Hour of
[1:40:45] Prayer that did it it was the ordination
[1:40:46] of God in your life and the ability for
[1:40:49] you to receive
[1:40:51] that doesn't mean we don't seek that
[1:40:52] doesn't mean we don't lay aside time we
[1:40:54] should do all of those things to quiet
[1:40:56] ourselves and get the flesh man put the
[1:40:58] put to rest but you realize at the end
[1:40:59] of the day it wasn't all your striving
[1:41:01] you didn't earn something you didn't
[1:41:02] finally come to a place through hours of
[1:41:04] prayer that you finally earned a merit
[1:41:06] badge and God said check check check
[1:41:07] he's now worked hard enough I'll bring a
[1:41:09] revelation yeah amen no we see
[1:41:12] Revelation hit the children of God all
[1:41:14] through the Bible and it was times they
[1:41:15] weren't working it wasn't they weren't
[1:41:17] laboring to receive it they were just
[1:41:19] walking along they were going down on
[1:41:21] the road they were washing their Nets
[1:41:22] they were doing whatever they were doing
[1:41:23] and all of a sudden they got blindsided
[1:41:25] by the word of
[1:41:30] God praise God let's go to Matthew
[1:41:43] 13 Matthew
[1:41:46] 13 13 Matthew
[1:41:49] 13:13 wherefore speak I to them in
[1:41:52] Parables because they seeing see not and
[1:41:55] hearing they hear not neither do they
[1:41:58] understand and in them is fulfilled the
[1:42:00] prophecy of Isaiah which saith by
[1:42:02] hearing you shall hear shall not
[1:42:04] understand and seeing you shall see and
[1:42:06] shall not perceive for this people's
[1:42:08] heart is waxed gross and their ears are
[1:42:10] dull of hearing and their eyes they have
[1:42:12] closed lest at any time they should see
[1:42:14] with their eyes and hear with their ears
[1:42:16] and should understand with their heart
[1:42:18] and should be converted and I should
[1:42:20] heal them
[1:42:21] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[1:42:24] and your ears for they
[1:42:27] hear I feel blessed
[1:42:32] friends they couldn't see they were
[1:42:35] blinded they couldn't see no matter how
[1:42:37] much they strained they would have never
[1:42:39] seen because they were
[1:42:40] blinded but blessed are your eyes for
[1:42:43] they see in the b in Proverbs 20 it says
[1:42:47] the hearing ear and the Seeing Eye the
[1:42:49] Lord hath made even both both of them I
[1:42:52] say thank you God for making in me a
[1:42:54] seeing eye and a hearing ear and a heart
[1:42:56] to perceive that's the grace of
[1:43:00] God brother Bram said I want to go back
[1:43:03] and read this part of the scripture here
[1:43:05] in verse 15 for this people heart is
[1:43:08] waxed gross and their ears are dull of
[1:43:09] hearing and their eyes that they have
[1:43:10] closed lest at any time they should see
[1:43:12] with their eyes hear with their ears
[1:43:14] should understand with their heart and I
[1:43:16] should and should be converted and I
[1:43:18] should heal them so conversion has to do
[1:43:21] with hearing seeing and understanding
[1:43:24] amen and brother bam said in the patas
[1:43:27] vision when he preached the church ages
[1:43:28] he said now while we are talking on
[1:43:31] Revelation ask him to give you a
[1:43:33] revelation of this for it can only be
[1:43:36] known by Revelation and you can only be
[1:43:38] saved by Revelation you have a knowledge
[1:43:41] of it intellectually but you can't be
[1:43:43] saved until it's revealed to you no man
[1:43:46] can call Jesus Christ only by the Holy
[1:43:48] Ghost that's what the Bible says no man
[1:43:50] can say Jesus is the Christ until he has
[1:43:52] received the Holy Ghost he might say the
[1:43:55] pastor says so the Bible says so them
[1:43:57] are truths the church says so that's
[1:43:58] true but you don't know yourself until
[1:44:01] the Holy Ghost has revealed it to you
[1:44:03] and he's become in you no man can call
[1:44:05] Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost
[1:44:07] not by knowledge not by intellectuals
[1:44:10] amen so what does it take to be saved
[1:44:12] you have to have eyes to see ears to
[1:44:14] hear and a heart to perceive and
[1:44:16] understand you have to be able to
[1:44:18] receive Revelation on the word to be
[1:44:20] saved amen that's
[1:44:23] right how many have received Revelation
[1:44:25] on the
[1:44:27] word how did you get it it came so
[1:44:31] easy you just
[1:44:34] believed listen I I'm not saying that
[1:44:37] living a Christian Life is easy it's not
[1:44:39] easy it's
[1:44:40] hard but receiving Revelation is
[1:44:43] easy eating the book is sweet in your
[1:44:45] mouth living it is bitter in your belly
[1:44:48] it it may be hard to live it may be hard
[1:44:51] listen we don't we you know by the grace
[1:44:54] of God what our struggles what our
[1:44:56] struggles are our struggles are
[1:44:58] struggling with this flesh to Reign it
[1:44:59] in and bring it subject to the word
[1:45:01] we're wrestling with ourselves and we're
[1:45:02] fighting with a fallen
[1:45:04] world but to believe we're not
[1:45:07] struggling to believe that's just given
[1:45:09] to us of the father it comes so easy we
[1:45:11] just believe you know what started all
[1:45:13] of our struggles
[1:45:15] believing believing the word and
[1:45:17] recognizing I'm off the word and now
[1:45:19] have the responsibility surrender to the
[1:45:21] word and ask God for help and not let
[1:45:23] this flesh go astray and wrestle with it
[1:45:25] all the time and bring my thoughts
[1:45:26] subject to Christ and bring this body
[1:45:28] subject I'm struggling all the time like
[1:45:30] Paul was saying amen I'm tempering in
[1:45:32] all things I keep under my body lest
[1:45:35] when I've preached to others I should be
[1:45:36] a cast away he was struggling with
[1:45:38] himself but he was not struggling to
[1:45:40] believe amen right Abraham was
[1:45:43] struggling he struggled with the with
[1:45:45] the tensions with law he struggled with
[1:45:47] making a few mistakes he made a few
[1:45:48] missteps he didn't always get the word
[1:45:50] word right but he believed it amen he
[1:45:52] wasn't struggling to believe he believed
[1:45:55] it he may not have always acted it
[1:45:56] outright he may have took his father
[1:45:57] along he may have took law long he may
[1:45:59] have he may have backslid into gerer he
[1:46:02] may have lied to aimc he may have done
[1:46:04] all of these things but he did not
[1:46:06] disbel because it was given to him to
[1:46:08] believe and it was imputed unto him for
[1:46:10] righteousness because he
[1:46:13] believed we may not we may struggle with
[1:46:15] ourselves we may struggle to live we may
[1:46:18] have bumps and bruises and ups and downs
[1:46:19] and fail and faults and all of that and
[1:46:22] we may be really wrestling with
[1:46:23] ourselves all the time and really
[1:46:25] struggling and really groaning under the
[1:46:27] load groaning under our own flesh
[1:46:29] groaning under a world and a fallen
[1:46:31] condition but one thing we haven't
[1:46:32] struggled for is that's to receive
[1:46:34] revelation we didn't struggle to receive
[1:46:36] revelation we just received Revelation
[1:46:39] cuz he gave
[1:46:40] it the spiritual things was so easy for
[1:46:44] Jacob Esau couldn't go past the carinal
[1:46:48] but for Jacob it was just so easy why he
[1:46:50] didn't strain he didn't push he didn't
[1:46:53] fight he didn't pull amen when it was
[1:46:55] the appointed time God just made it
[1:46:57] happen
[1:47:02] amen let's go to John chapter
[1:47:15] 4 John chapter 4 is the story of a
[1:47:19] Samaritan
[1:47:21] woman Outcast of the
[1:47:24] Jews and she's living in Samaria which
[1:47:26] is not well thought of by the Jews and
[1:47:28] in Samaria she's living a vile life a
[1:47:32] compromised life and she's not well
[1:47:35] thought of with the
[1:47:38] Samaritans she can't work her way out of
[1:47:40] her
[1:47:47] hole she begins a dialogue with a man
[1:47:50] who comes by her way to sit on the well
[1:47:53] one day and start conversing with her he
[1:47:57] starts to tell her about a water she can
[1:47:58] drink that if she would drink it she
[1:48:00] would never thirst again a a water of
[1:48:02] eternal life and she starts to ask
[1:48:04] questions about the water and then she
[1:48:05] wants the water and then he says go get
[1:48:08] your husband and she says well I don't
[1:48:10] have any husband and he says you spoke
[1:48:12] well because you've had five and the one
[1:48:14] you have now is not your own and then
[1:48:15] she recognizes all of a sudden her eyes
[1:48:18] open and she says I perceive you to be a
[1:48:22] prophet you know why wasn't the
[1:48:24] Pharisees called him beah but she called
[1:48:26] him a
[1:48:30] prophet and then when she found out she
[1:48:32] was a he was a prophet she had a
[1:48:34] question in her heart and that question
[1:48:35] wasn't about her future or whether
[1:48:37] everything will come right in her life
[1:48:39] her question was how do you worship God
[1:48:43] I'm confused about
[1:48:44] religion I've been taught this Jews have
[1:48:47] been taught that the Baptists say the
[1:48:49] Pentecostals say uh uh the Catholics say
[1:48:52] but how how do you worship God and he
[1:48:55] begins to tell her how God wants to be
[1:48:57] worshiped and in spirit and truth and
[1:48:59] he's seeking such to worship him and
[1:49:01] then all of a sudden another little
[1:49:02] light bulb goes off on her and she says
[1:49:04] you know when Messiah comes which is
[1:49:06] called Christ he'll tell us all these
[1:49:10] things and Jesus looks at this woman and
[1:49:13] says I that speaketh to you and
[1:49:17] me and she just stands there
[1:49:21] looking at him and at the same time his
[1:49:22] disciples walk
[1:49:24] up and they're curious to why he's
[1:49:27] speaking to the woman but they didn't
[1:49:28] ask him and she's standing there for a
[1:49:30] moment and we go to verse
[1:49:34] 28 it
[1:49:37] says chapter 4: 28 the woman then left
[1:49:40] her water pot and went her way into the
[1:49:42] City and say to the men come see a man
[1:49:45] which told me all things that ever I did
[1:49:47] is not this the Christ
[1:49:52] amen this is a woman who's been trying
[1:49:55] out
[1:49:56] religion she's she's not she's not a
[1:50:00] heathen
[1:50:01] Infidel because as soon as she comes in
[1:50:03] contact with a prophet she wants to know
[1:50:04] about worship this is a woman who was
[1:50:06] meditating on God this is a woman who
[1:50:08] wanted to worship God I don't think she
[1:50:10] was pleased with her lifestyle she was
[1:50:11] stuck in her
[1:50:13] lifestyle here she is and she there's no
[1:50:15] way in the world her reputation shot her
[1:50:18] condition is set she cannot work her way
[1:50:20] into righteousness there's nothing that
[1:50:22] this woman can do amen but God had needs
[1:50:25] to go by Samaria he knew where she was
[1:50:28] and in the right Junction of time he
[1:50:30] would come and sit on a well at the hour
[1:50:32] that she would be coming to the well she
[1:50:34] wasn't finding anybody he was finding
[1:50:37] her she wasn't hunting he was hunting
[1:50:40] she wasn't finding he was
[1:50:43] Finding and he began to speak to her on
[1:50:46] a spiritual level and something inside
[1:50:48] of her started to respond amen when when
[1:50:50] he began to speak on a spiritual level
[1:50:51] to even his own disciples amen he talked
[1:50:54] about eating my flesh and drinking my
[1:50:56] blood and my body is meat and he's
[1:50:58] speaking on a spiritual level they go to
[1:50:59] a carnal level and they start saying how
[1:51:02] can this be and how can we eat his flesh
[1:51:04] and drink his blood and the many of them
[1:51:06] walk away from him here's a woman he
[1:51:08] starts speaking to her on a spiritual
[1:51:10] level about water you can drink and
[1:51:11] never thirst again eternal life and
[1:51:13] shows the sign of a prophet and
[1:51:15] instantly she goes from carnal to the
[1:51:17] spiritual
[1:51:18] level why for her it was just so easy
[1:51:22] amen it just came easy she didn't strain
[1:51:24] she didn't fight she didn't go to
[1:51:26] Theological Seminary she just went to
[1:51:28] the well one day to get water like she
[1:51:30] did every day and on this day there
[1:51:32] happened to be a son of man there a
[1:51:33] Prophet The Son of God was sitting there
[1:51:35] and he begins to talk to her and as he
[1:51:37] talked to her something inside of her
[1:51:38] kept thumping and thumping and thumping
[1:51:40] and realization upon realization was
[1:51:42] coming to her and she asked the question
[1:51:45] you know messiah's coming and he says I
[1:51:47] am he and something in her went thunk
[1:51:52] amen she didn't need to ask the pastor
[1:51:54] she didn't need to ask the priest she
[1:51:56] didn't need to pray about
[1:51:57] it why it came so easy to her all she
[1:52:01] did was dropped the old religious water
[1:52:03] pot went running into the City and some
[1:52:06] come see a man that told me everything
[1:52:08] I've ever done isn't this the
[1:52:11] Christ she didn't need to get she didn't
[1:52:14] get need to get a party of people to
[1:52:16] agree with her yeah amen she knew
[1:52:21] it he told her and she knew
[1:52:26] it brother BR says in the message
[1:52:30] identification of Christ in all ages
[1:52:32] said look at the little woman see she
[1:52:34] had fallen from God's thoughts he's
[1:52:37] speaking of the same woman she had
[1:52:39] fallen from God's thoughts she could be
[1:52:41] she could be redeemed she was a subject
[1:52:45] she had representation in heaven she
[1:52:49] turned around
[1:52:55] that statement just does something for
[1:52:59] me she had representation in heaven she
[1:53:03] turned
[1:53:04] around
[1:53:05] amen years later somebody come to her
[1:53:08] and say that's such a good story how you
[1:53:10] turned your life
[1:53:11] around and you went down a different
[1:53:13] Road and you made other
[1:53:16] choices that wasn't what saved her all
[1:53:20] her choices ruined
[1:53:22] her but when God came to her and spoke
[1:53:26] the word and something in her come alive
[1:53:29] amen how could God come to her how could
[1:53:32] she receive when thousands would reject
[1:53:34] why she receive because she had she had
[1:53:36] fallen from the thoughts of God she was
[1:53:39] a thought of God trapped in a body of
[1:53:42] Flesh she had fallen from the thoughts
[1:53:44] of God God never forgot about her he
[1:53:46] always knew where she was and he always
[1:53:48] knew how he would C catch
[1:53:51] right she had fallen from the thoughts
[1:53:52] of God and she could be redeemed because
[1:53:57] she was a subject she had representation
[1:54:00] in heaven she turned right
[1:54:07] around in John 8 verse 23 Jesus says he
[1:54:12] said unto them ye are from beneath I am
[1:54:15] from above you are of this world I'm not
[1:54:18] of this world I said therefore unto you
[1:54:21] that ye shall die in your sins for if
[1:54:23] you believe not that I am he you shall
[1:54:26] die in your sins what do they need to be
[1:54:30] saved to
[1:54:31] believe in
[1:54:33] him how can they believe unless it's
[1:54:36] given to them to believe this woman
[1:54:38] could believe because she was a thought
[1:54:41] that had fallen from heaven and she had
[1:54:43] representation in
[1:54:47] heaven brother bam says and going beyond
[1:54:49] the Camp so they deny his word deny his
[1:54:52] baptism deny his power deny his signs
[1:54:55] and with Creed or tradition again of
[1:54:56] wearing turned around collars and
[1:54:58] everything making themselves Creeds and
[1:55:00] so forth they're trying to they're
[1:55:02] trying to upon good works they wasn't
[1:55:04] ordained to life to begin with they had
[1:55:07] nothing to believe with what was wrong
[1:55:10] with these Pharisees why couldn't they
[1:55:11] believe when they saw the sign when they
[1:55:13] saw the works there was nothing in them
[1:55:15] they had nothing to believe with they
[1:55:16] didn't have representation in heaven
[1:55:18] they had no C Gene of God
[1:55:20] but this little woman she had
[1:55:22] representation in heaven and she had a c
[1:55:24] Gene of God inside of her she had
[1:55:26] something to believe with that's how she
[1:55:28] could
[1:55:32] believe and brother Ram goes on to say
[1:55:34] this and who is this
[1:55:36] MDC said then after you recognized the
[1:55:39] very word of God was Eagle
[1:55:41] food then you left the other things you
[1:55:44] have then been formed into the living
[1:55:46] living image of the Living God you heard
[1:55:48] from your theopen me if this Earthly
[1:55:51] body be dissolved we have one
[1:55:56] waiting when you recognize the very word
[1:55:58] of God was Eagle food and you left the
[1:56:00] others you've been formed you've been
[1:56:03] born
[1:56:04] again what cause all of that you heard
[1:56:07] from your
[1:56:09] theophany how was it I could believe
[1:56:12] this message how was it I could recogniz
[1:56:14] cuz I had representation in heaven there
[1:56:16] was something on the inside there was
[1:56:18] something that connect to Something in
[1:56:20] another world it wasn't me it wasn't my
[1:56:23] brain it wasn't my will it wasn't my
[1:56:25] strength I Heard From Another
[1:56:28] Dimension a voice calling me amen I
[1:56:31] heard from my theophany you know what
[1:56:33] that means that means I have a
[1:56:48] theophonic before the foundation of the
[1:56:50] world was ordained to be there something
[1:56:52] to believe with amen I didn't believe
[1:56:55] with my brain I believed with the c Gene
[1:56:57] of God that was in my soul it wasn't
[1:56:58] what I did it's what he did it's not
[1:57:00] what I orchestrated it's what he
[1:57:05] orchestrated so how could we take credit
[1:57:07] for it all we can say is thank you
[1:57:12] amen let's turn to Romans chapter 3 I'm
[1:57:15] going to read just a couple more
[1:57:16] scriptures and we'll
[1:57:18] close
[1:57:20] Romans chapter
[1:57:30] 3 Romans
[1:57:36] 3:23 Romans 3:23 for all have sinned and
[1:57:39] come short of the glory of God being
[1:57:41] justified freely by his grace through
[1:57:44] the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[1:57:46] who God has set forth to be a
[1:57:48] propitiation through faith faith in his
[1:57:50] blood to declare his righteousness for
[1:57:52] the remission of sins that are passed
[1:57:54] through the forbearance of God to
[1:57:56] declare I say at this time his
[1:57:58] righteousness that he might be just and
[1:58:00] the justifier of him which believeth in
[1:58:03] Jesus where is boasting then it is
[1:58:08] excluded by what law of Works nay but by
[1:58:11] the law of
[1:58:13] Faith righteousness was imputed unto
[1:58:16] Abraham because he believed we are saved
[1:58:18] because we believe how did We Believe by
[1:58:21] what law by the law of Faith now let's
[1:58:24] go over to Ephesians chapter
[1:58:29] 2 Ephesians chapter
[1:58:32] 2 and verse
[1:58:38] 8 for by grace are you saved through
[1:58:41] faith and that nut of yourselves it is
[1:58:43] the gift of God not of Works lest any
[1:58:47] man should boast where is boasting then
[1:58:51] it is
[1:58:53] excluded I'm saved by grace through
[1:58:56] faith and that not of myself it was a
[1:58:58] gift of God he put something inside of
[1:59:01] me to believe with and he had a voice on
[1:59:05] the other side calling me and these two
[1:59:07] came together he sent his word to
[1:59:09] connect to the word inside of me what
[1:59:12] did we do listen when when we really
[1:59:15] think about it when it comes down to it
[1:59:17] it came to us so easy
[1:59:20] friends we don't want to trivialize or
[1:59:22] marginalize your life there's been hard
[1:59:24] things in life and walking this road has
[1:59:26] challenges to it but it's mainly hard
[1:59:28] because of the carnal flesh it's mainly
[1:59:31] the reason it's difficult and the main
[1:59:32] struggles with that but the reality is
[1:59:36] it came so
[1:59:38] easy came by grace through faith and
[1:59:41] that not of myself it was the gift of
[1:59:45] God brother BM says here in anointed
[1:59:47] ones at the end time now I want you to
[1:59:49] know this is sure and and you that
[1:59:51] listen to this tape you might have
[1:59:52] thought today that I was trying to say
[1:59:54] that about myself being that I was
[1:59:55] packing this message I have no more to
[1:59:58] do with it than nothing no more than
[2:00:01] just a voice and my voice against my
[2:00:03] better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper
[2:00:06] but it's the will of my father that I
[2:00:07] declare to do and I determined to do I
[2:00:10] wasn't the one that appeared down on the
[2:00:11] river I was only standing there when he
[2:00:13] appeared I'm not the one that performs
[2:00:15] these things and foretells these things
[2:00:17] that happened as perfect as they are I'm
[2:00:19] only one that's near when he does it I
[2:00:21] was only a voice that he used to say it
[2:00:24] it wasn't what I knew it's what I just
[2:00:26] surrendered myself to that he spake
[2:00:28] through it isn't me it wasn't the
[2:00:30] seventh angel oh no it was the
[2:00:32] manifestation of the son of man it
[2:00:34] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[2:00:36] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man
[2:00:39] it's
[2:00:41] God I love that can we say the same
[2:00:43] thing about us I didn't find the message
[2:00:45] I'm not the one who believed the message
[2:00:47] it was God in Me
[2:00:49] it was God who ordained it and God who
[2:00:51] found me and God who orchestrated it
[2:00:54] on in the seventh seal he says now
[2:00:57] remember let me exhort you again this is
[2:01:00] coming to the end of the seventh seal
[2:01:01] and I want you to think about even the
[2:01:02] seventh seal in our lives because the
[2:01:04] seventh seal in our lives is that
[2:01:06] mystery of God Christ living out in this
[2:01:08] Tabernacle of
[2:01:11] Flesh now remember this is at the end of
[2:01:13] the seventh seal let me exhort you again
[2:01:16] don't say thank you to anybody at all
[2:01:19] don't say thinking some minister or
[2:01:22] something some Mortal man there's
[2:01:23] anything good about him CU there's not I
[2:01:25] don't care who he is there's nothing
[2:01:27] good to any man that's right if there's
[2:01:30] a whole bunch of trumpets laying here
[2:01:31] and one of them had to sound out a
[2:01:33] certain music it's the man them trumpets
[2:01:35] are perfectly mute it's the fellow that
[2:01:37] can sound the trumpet that knows what
[2:01:39] he's going to do that picks up a trumpet
[2:01:42] the trumpet has nothing to do with it
[2:01:43] the sound comes from the intelligence
[2:01:45] behind it that's right so all trumpets
[2:01:47] are the same all men are the the same
[2:01:49] all Christians are the same got that
[2:01:53] there's no great man among us we're not
[2:01:55] great men not great women we're all
[2:01:57] brothers and sisters all the same in the
[2:01:58] same bracket we're no great one don't
[2:02:01] make one greater than the other when not
[2:02:02] a thing at all to do no sir but we're
[2:02:04] just all human beings don't try to
[2:02:07] interpret the things don't try to do
[2:02:08] anything more than just live a close
[2:02:10] Life Giving praise and honor to Jesus
[2:02:12] Christ everybody understand that now
[2:02:15] amen love him with all your
[2:02:17] heart could you not love him when he's
[2:02:20] done so much amen he's coming to the end
[2:02:22] of the seventh seal amen and don't say
[2:02:24] thank you to no man as if man has done
[2:02:26] this of man did this and man did man
[2:02:28] didn't do anything man ruined himself
[2:02:31] God's redeemed man this is all God's
[2:02:34] doing listen there's individuals in this
[2:02:37] church that God has gifted to write
[2:02:40] songs how hard did you work to write a
[2:02:45] song how many years of school did you go
[2:02:48] to and and you got lyrics study and
[2:02:51] listen the majority of the time it just
[2:02:54] comes or it comes slowly or it comes
[2:02:57] fast but that song was given to
[2:03:01] you there's some of us that are called
[2:03:03] to sing you know your ability to sing
[2:03:05] you didn't make yourself a singer you
[2:03:06] were born able to sing if you've got
[2:03:09] natural Talent natural ability some of
[2:03:11] us can play instruments you know that's
[2:03:13] the grace of God and I know it I paid
[2:03:16] for guitar lessons when I turned 18 for
[2:03:18] one solid year of guitar lesson I paid
[2:03:21] 420 something I knew I knew the exact
[2:03:24] change and at the end of the one year I
[2:03:26] couldn't play nothing I would pluck out
[2:03:28] she'll be coming around the mountain
[2:03:29] when she comes and I did it
[2:03:35] poorly if God has given you a natural
[2:03:37] ability that's from
[2:03:39] God there's some Among Us God's called
[2:03:41] to preach the gospel you know that
[2:03:43] inspiration you cannot preach without
[2:03:45] inspiration and you can't work up
[2:03:47] inspiration and without inspiration
[2:03:48] you're dead in in the water I've been
[2:03:49] dead in the water many a day I spent
[2:03:52] Friday and Saturday Saturday night dead
[2:03:54] in the water amen until God supern
[2:03:56] naturally drops an inspiration in my
[2:03:58] heart and when drops an inspiration in
[2:04:00] my heart then it's easy then all you do
[2:04:02] is search the Bible and to find all the
[2:04:03] scriptures you know what it comes easy
[2:04:06] friends you say preaching that must be
[2:04:08] hard no getting yourself out of the way
[2:04:10] is hard dealing with your emotions is
[2:04:12] hard keeping yourself subject is hard
[2:04:14] amen opening your heart to people that's
[2:04:16] hard but catching inspiration that's
[2:04:18] easy that's something God
[2:04:21] does I've spent hours reading nothing
[2:04:24] would come I've had Saturdays where I
[2:04:27] read three four message two or three not

[2:04:43] bed and I think it was one or two in the
[2:04:44] no three it was after 3 in the morning I
[2:04:47] said I'm going to play a tape
[2:04:50] and when I turned left from Stuart Road
[2:04:53] on the Blue Lick Road and I went down
[2:04:55] over the hill like a little Whisper of a
[2:04:58] wind came in in one little
[2:05:02] scripture and from that I went to my
[2:05:05] office and I wrote down a couple of
[2:05:07] things went to bed woke up about 3 hours
[2:05:10] 4 hours
[2:05:11] later and all of a sudden all those
[2:05:13] little scriptures I wrote down I found
[2:05:14] them on my computer and I come and
[2:05:16] preach that message
[2:05:20] do you think that I have any right to
[2:05:22] take praise for that you think you
[2:05:24] should say thank you to any man the man
[2:05:27] was failing one book two book three book
[2:05:29] inspiration Bible reading prayer the man
[2:05:32] was
[2:05:33] failing but it was
[2:05:35] God God gives the ability God gives the
[2:05:38] talent God gives the song God gives the

[2:05:57] end of this to the end of the seventh
[2:05:58] seal we might get to the place where we
[2:05:59] say let's say thank you to nobody let's
[2:06:02] just thank God because everything that
[2:06:03] was happened was him orchestrating him
[2:06:05] doing and for us it came easy how is it

[2:06:10] something you've never heard before you

[2:06:15] of your mouth goes amen and all of a
[2:06:17] sudden you know you know that's true but

[2:06:45] of him always trying every time
[2:06:47] something good happens ES tries to stand
[2:06:49] in
[2:06:53] front every time God's going to take a
[2:06:55] snapshot of his glorious work Esau's
[2:06:58] trying to get in the picture trying to
[2:07:00] photob bomb the
[2:07:04] shot I don't think it's just
[2:07:08] me oh God help us just to lay ourselves
[2:07:11] aside and say look what God did look

[2:07:14] God
[2:07:16] did help me God I I can say is help me
[2:07:20] God for us friends it has come
[2:07:25] easy for Abraham Abraham's just a
[2:07:28] regular guy as far as he
[2:07:30] knows he doesn't go to a temple one day
[2:07:33] and become a priest and decide he's
[2:07:35] going to become the patriarch of a of a
[2:07:37] new lineage of a faith seed no God comes
[2:07:40] to him and tells him I want you to go
[2:07:43] here he didn't conjure that up he didn't
[2:07:45] think it up he just happened to believe
[2:07:47] it
[2:07:49] and even in performance it wasn't that
[2:07:50] great of a performance but he still
[2:07:52] believed it then he went to Heron and
[2:07:54] from Heron God spoke to him again and
[2:07:56] then he went to the promised land and
[2:07:57] God met him when he crossed into the
[2:07:58] promised land and then God met him again
[2:08:00] and then then God met him in the form of
[2:08:02] mkdc and blessed him and then God met
[2:08:04] him in the plains of mammory and and and
[2:08:06] confirmed the promise and then when he
[2:08:08] went to ailec and messed up God went
[2:08:09] down there and defended him
[2:08:11] through do you think Abraham's going to
[2:08:13] stand up when we get to the to the other
[2:08:16] side we're all in the marriage supper
[2:08:18] and ABR was going to stand up and say
[2:08:19] listen let me tell you what I did
[2:08:24] I he had no clue he couldn't make God
[2:08:27] come to him all he could do was live and
[2:08:29] God came when God wanted to come and God
[2:08:31] came where he wanted to come and for
[2:08:33] Abraham it was
[2:08:35] easy hey we've all lived our life but
[2:08:37] we've had Junctions of time when God has
[2:08:39] interjected himself he's delivered us
[2:08:41] he's changed our Direction he's opened
[2:08:43] the word to us in new ways and he's
[2:08:45] delivered us from ourselves and from
[2:08:46] sickness hey he knew when he would do it
[2:08:48] he knew how he would do it he had it
[2:08:50] orchestrated before the foundation of
[2:08:52] the world we can't share any credit for
[2:08:54] that at all because it's him that
[2:08:56] worketh in us both the will and do of
[2:08:58] his good pleasure all we can say is
[2:09:00] thank you God for me it came
[2:09:05] easy believing came easy when I first
[2:09:08] first introduced to this message the me
[2:09:11] believing the message wasn't
[2:09:14] convenient it cost me a great deal it
[2:09:16] cost me friends it cost me family it
[2:09:18] cost me reputation it cost me
[2:09:21] greatly but it still came easy the
[2:09:23] believing part I couldn't
[2:09:26] help I didn't strain I didn't work it
[2:09:29] was inconvenient there was even times I
[2:09:31] tried to not believe it because the
[2:09:34] believing was so inconvenient for me
[2:09:36] that it would have been much easier not
[2:09:37] to believe it but no matter how much
[2:09:39] more convenient would have been there
[2:09:41] was nothing I could do to change what
[2:09:42] was inside of me I believed it and I
[2:09:44] couldn't help but believe it for me it
[2:09:46] came
[2:09:47] easy
[2:09:49] amen why CU God ordained
[2:09:53] it Jesus said to the to
[2:09:56] the to the
[2:09:58] multitudes therefore said I unto you
[2:10:00] that no man can come unto me except it
[2:10:03] were given unto him of my
[2:10:06] father thank

[2:10:14] again this wonderful old Hymn of the
[2:10:16] church I love him I love him I just
[2:10:20] can't get enough of saying that because
[2:10:21] he first loved me he loved me a poor
[2:10:25] deliberately blinded sin loving wretched
[2:10:28] drunkard son in the gutters and he
[2:10:31] stooped down by his grace I had nothing
[2:10:33] to do with it he chose
[2:10:38] me the brother BM decided he was going
[2:10:41] to be the prophet of the
[2:10:42] age did he decide he'll have a Healing
[2:10:45] Ministry to the peoples of the world did
[2:10:47] he decide that he would do great healing
[2:10:49] campaigns and heal multitudes did he
[2:10:51] decide that he'd have his picture taken
[2:10:53] with a pillar of fire did he decide that
[2:10:56] he would get caught up into a
[2:10:57] consolations of angels no that just
[2:11:00] happened to him he didn't make it happen
[2:11:03] he didn't work his way up to it God knew
[2:11:05] when and where and how and God
[2:11:07] orchestrated all of that that wasn't
[2:11:09] brother brenham's doing that was God's
[2:11:11] doing amen he didn't make himself to be
[2:11:14] the prophet of the age he didn't earn it
[2:11:16] by Merit or by degree amen he was just
[2:11:19] living a life as a little boy amen a
[2:11:21] poor humble boy from a poor humble
[2:11:23] family and all of a sudden you brother
[2:11:25] bam didn't make himself have a vision he
[2:11:27] didn't make himself hear a voice in the
[2:11:28] popular tree he didn't make himself see
[2:11:31] am me the bridge spanning the Ohio River
[2:11:33] he didn't do any of that for him that
[2:11:35] came easy that didn't make his life easy
[2:11:38] he had difficulty in life but you
[2:11:39] understand that came easy Visions just
[2:11:42] came amen the word of the Lord just came
[2:11:45] God injected himself on the scene and
[2:11:47] made it all happen amen how could he at
[2:11:49] the end of it take credit he said' don't
[2:11:50] say thank you to any man this has been
[2:11:52] God I was only standing near when he did
[2:11:55] those
[2:11:57] things I hope that God will allow me to
[2:11:59] get to the place where genuinely from my
[2:12:02] heart I can say the same thing that it
[2:12:04] wasn't me friends it's not been me I
[2:12:06] didn't believe this message there was
[2:12:07] something inside of me that believed
[2:12:09] this message and I learned after I come
[2:12:12] to the message that that was the real me
[2:12:13] that was intended to be me but it wasn't
[2:12:16] my brain that grabbed the concept it was
[2:12:18] my heart that latched onto the word
[2:12:20] because why I didn't find the message
[2:12:22] the message found me I didn't find
[2:12:23] Christ Christ found me I didn't deliver
[2:12:25] myself he delivered me and I'm not the
[2:12:27] believer he's the believer inside of
[2:12:30] me we call ourselves Believers I'm a
[2:12:33] believer I'm a Believer but the reality
[2:12:35] is the Esau of me is not the believer
[2:12:37] only the Christ part of me is the
[2:12:39] believer that was ordained before the
[2:12:41] foundation of the world the attribute
[2:12:43] and part of God that's the believer in
[2:12:45] me and that's what makes me think thank
[2:12:48] ful for me it came
[2:12:51] easy I didn't have to go to
[2:12:53] school Seminary I didn't have to pay any
[2:12:58] money what did you do to become
[2:13:03] predestinated what did you do to have a
[2:13:05] c Gene of God in your
[2:13:09] soul for us it came easy
[2:13:12] friends it's just God's doing why is it
[2:13:15] we can move past the carnal of religion
[2:13:17] and move into the spiritual what is it
[2:13:19] that's crying and hungering for more of
[2:13:21] God what is it that wants the truth and
[2:13:22] only the truth and what is it that wants
[2:13:24] to see him so clear so unveiled in this
[2:13:27] day what is that that's
[2:13:29] God working in us both the will and the
[2:13:32] do of his good pleasure and all I can
[2:13:35] say is thank you God thank you God for
[2:13:40] all that you've done for me let's all
[2:13:43] Stand Together musicians if you'll come
[2:13:46] please
[2:13:54] you know there's
[2:13:56] people on this Earth that don't have a c
[2:13:58] gen of God and they could strain and
[2:14:00] strain and strain and strain and they'll
[2:14:03] never see the message the way you see
[2:14:06] it they could read and read and read and
[2:14:09] read and they'll never get the unveiling
[2:14:12] of
[2:14:13] Christ but friends for us it comes easy
[2:14:19] we don't strain we read we pray we study
[2:14:22] because we love
[2:14:24] it but it wasn't the abundance of study
[2:14:26] that brought Revelation it was the grace
[2:14:28] of God Amen he gave us eyes to see and
[2:14:32] ears to hear and our heart to perceive
[2:14:36] and he has redeemed us imputed unto us
[2:14:38] righteousness because we believed and we
[2:14:41] believed by grace and that not of
[2:14:44] ourselves is a gift of

[2:16:19] and Esau we see Esau could never be what
[2:16:22] Jacob was he could be a good man he
[2:16:25] could be loyal to his father he could be
[2:16:28] a good Christian he could be religious
[2:16:30] he could do so many nice wonderful
[2:16:32] things but he could never be what Jacob
[2:16:37] was God and Jacob he may not have been
[2:16:40] able to be as nice as Esau as kind or as
[2:16:44] sweet
[2:16:45] maybe but he had something Esau with
[2:16:47] never had he had a seed of
[2:16:52] predestination God we recognize we're
[2:16:54] not the best we're not the nicest we're
[2:16:57] not the sweetest we're not the most
[2:16:59] loyal we have failed in every category
