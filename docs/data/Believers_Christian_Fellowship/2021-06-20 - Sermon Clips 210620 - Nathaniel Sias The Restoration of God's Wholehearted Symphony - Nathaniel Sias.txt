TRANSCRIPT
========================================
brother sometimes we need to pray and say less speak less and say more i should say because when we're doing our part we will see the effect the saints come closer together the harmony gets tighter do you know who has the best harmony maybe maybe you've never heard this or maybe not aware of it but you know the people that can sing together the best have the most beautiful harmony our families because they say all their words the same they have the same accent they have the same way of shaping the words and they sing together and it just comes together so beautifully but friends were supposed to be a family the words that we speak here and speak and speak and speak we're supposed to be expressing them the same way so that when all is brought together in harmony it's perfect the sweetest sounds the sweetest things that god wants to express how do we get there oh there's all this pressure i'm feeling pressure i'm feeling pressure and it's incredible the amount of pressure that an instrument can take do you know why because the instrument that little violin as small as it may be it's designed to handle that pressure it's designed perfectly to handle the pressure and under pressure is when it makes its sweetest sound praise the lord jesus that's exactly where i want to be at i don't care what pressure it is friends i pray that from the bottom of your heart trust the one that made you trust the one that's tuning us up and it might feel like such a pressure that we're going to break but god made the vessel god made the instrument to play the sound and he's the one that's orchestrating he knows exactly what each part is supposed to be played praise the lord and you might feel like you're all alone but friends you're not alone just keep on serving god with your whole heart give him everything
