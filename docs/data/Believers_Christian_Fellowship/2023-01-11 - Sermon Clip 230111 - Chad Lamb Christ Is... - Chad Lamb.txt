TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Moses mother convinced him that he was the Redeemer born a proper child so he had the right understanding of the scripture but yet no manifestation he had he had been taught intellectually through a mother who had told him you were born a proper child you were born at the right time and we have a revelation you're the Redeemer you're the one that's going to bring us out and and he believed it and he tried to act upon it in his own accord amen and he failed miserably he goes into the Wilderness for 40 years and then God comes to approach him and call him back into his commission amen and then he begins to stumble around and say he can't do it and he's not able and and there's this whole dialogue with God and also God doesn't have a plan B here so God is in dialogue with money you say why didn't he strike him dead because he doesn't have a plan B Moses is the Fulfillment of the scripture he is carrying within him the predestinated word for That season but it must move from predestinated word to manifested word and God has got to get Moses to yield to the word and when Moses yields to the word it moves from predestinated word to manifested word and when it's manifested word it becomes light and that light becomes life and a whole nation is saved perfect so we realized that Jesus Christ is the anointed word made manifest in that day so we must be like the virgin like Moses like John the Baptist I believe amen I believe that God has called me for this hour I believe that I'm part on Eternal thought of God that he had of me I believe that I am predestinated to be here in this hour and there's a prophecy laying in me a word to be fulfilled but nothing's going to happen until I and my own free choice my free moral agency lay down my life and surrender to the word that's been handed and I get baptized in his name I dress the way he said I talked the way he says I Surrender everything all my thoughts all my previous understanding of the Bible all my own wishes I lay it all down and I Surrender the word and become the manifested word by letting the word for the hour flow through me and that brings light and that brings life you can see what a hindrance it is to say I am to say that I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ but I want to cut my hair I want to wear jewelry I want to wear makeup I want to I want to join with systems I want to have my own way I still want to do a little side deal on the side I I think the brother Brandon was right in all these areas but you see what a hindrance it is because the predestinated word must be manifested word and we become the word when we let the word flow through us how do we let it flow through us being unto me according to your words if that's what you're calling for in this hour that's what you're going to have that's what I'm going to surrender to you I'm going to quit all my little deals I'm going to quit my associations I'm going to surrender my own thinking because the manifested word is the light of the hour
