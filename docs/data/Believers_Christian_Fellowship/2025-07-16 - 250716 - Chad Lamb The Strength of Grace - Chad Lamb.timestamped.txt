[0:12] Children of the light arise. Arise and
[0:16] take your place. It's by grace. It's by
[0:20] grace. It's by grace.
[0:23] If you're struggling in confusion,
[0:26] wondering why your heart seems low, take
[0:29] your hands off this old world and let it
[0:32] go.
[0:34] Let it go. Let it be. It's not reality,
[0:39] but a shadow of a shadow of a shadow.
[0:44] Walk like sons and daughters of your
[0:47] father living here below. Oh, you're not
[0:51] of this old world, so let it go.
[0:55] Children of the light. Arise. Arise.
[0:59] This is your day. Watch and pray. Watch
[1:02] and pray. Watch and pray.
[1:05] God's restore the word. Make clear his
[1:08] way that you may trust and know that
[1:11] you're not of this old world. So let it
[1:14] go.
[1:16] Let it go. Let it be. It's not reality,
[1:21] but a shadow of a shadow of a shadow.
[1:26] Walk like sons and daughters of your
[1:29] father living here below. For you're not
[1:33] of this old world, so let it go. Verse
[1:36] two, children of the light. Arise.
[1:40] Arise. This is your day. Watch and pray.
[1:44] Watch and pray. Watch and pray.
[1:47] God's restored the word made clear his
[1:50] way that you may trust and know that
[1:53] you're not of this old world. So let it
[1:56] go.
[1:58] Let it go. Let it be. It's not reality
[2:03] but a shadow of a shadow of a shadow.
[2:08] Walk like sons and daughters of your
[2:11] father living here below. For you're not
[2:14] of this old world. to let it go.
[2:19] This world is not my home. I'm just a
[2:23] passing through. My treasures are laid
[2:26] up somewhere beyond the blue. The angels
[2:31] beckon me from heaven's open door. And I
[2:35] can't feel at home in this world
[2:39] anymore.
[2:41] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[2:44] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[2:49] what would I do? The angels beckon me
[2:53] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[2:57] feel at home in this world anymore.
[3:01] They're all expecting me. And that's one
[3:05] thing I know. I fixed it up with Jesus
[3:09] many years ago. I know he'll see me
[3:13] through. Oh, I am weak and poor and I
[3:17] can't feel at home in this world
[3:20] anymore.
[3:22] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[3:26] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[3:30] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[3:34] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[3:38] feel at home in this world anymore.
[3:42] Just over in glory land we'll live
[3:46] eternally.
[3:47] The saints on every hand are shouting
[3:51] victory.
[3:52] The songs of sweetest praise drift back
[3:56] from heaven short. And I can't feel at
[3:59] home in this world anymore.
[4:03] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[4:07] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[4:11] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[4:16] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[4:19] feel at home in this world anymore. And
[4:23] I can't feel at home in this world
[4:27] anymore.
[4:29] [Music]
[4:33] Remember
[4:34] [Music]
[4:40] 1 Thessalonians 5:23.
[4:43] [Music]
[4:54] Raise your voices
[4:57] in one accord.
[5:01] It is the coming of the Lord.
[5:11] We sound a trumpet
[5:14] in the streets.
[5:17] It's time for all to come and see.
[5:29] Raise your hands in one accord.
[5:36] Bring down the presence of our Lord.
[5:45] Our God is our consuming fire.
[5:51] He's changing hearts and men's desires.
[6:10] Oh, in the days of Jesus
[6:13] when he walked upon the earth,
[6:17] he declared a gospel that had never
[6:21] before
[6:23] been heard.
[6:29] He said, "My peace
[6:33] I give it unto thee,
[6:37] not as the world gives, but my peace
[6:43] I give it
[6:45] unto thee
[6:55] and be a fountain.
[6:58] of living waters
[7:02] in a dry
[7:04] and thirsty land.
[7:08] And your cup will run over enough to
[7:12] share.
[7:15] Enough to share with your fellow man.
[7:22] So if you're dry and weary,
[7:26] can't find the light of day.
[7:35] We come onto these waters,
[7:39] the truth, the life, the way.
[7:48] Come to this fountain.
[7:52] Jesus will show you the way.
[8:00] Well, come onto these waters.
[8:04] You can find
[8:06] your way.
[8:17] So let your heart not be troubled.
[8:21] Let your mind
[8:25] be at ease.
[8:33] You have found the living waters as you
[8:37] rest
[8:39] at Jesus feet.
[8:47] There is a course to follow.
[8:50] [Music]
[8:52] There is a ground to prove.
[9:01] We're all headed for a change in our
[9:05] lives.
[9:06] Let your heart remain unmoved.
[9:14] We are following the author, the
[9:18] finisher
[9:20] of the faith.
[9:27] He has called his chosen people and he
[9:31] knows
[9:33] your every name.
[9:36] your every name.
[9:41] If we call upon the author, the finisher
[9:47] of the faith.
[9:54] We'll see his works among us. We'll know
[9:59] he's still the same.
[10:06] There's just no name like Jesus.
[10:10] There's just no other name to call.
[10:20] Well, there's just no name like Jesus.
[10:24] May his dove rest on us all.
[10:32] Let your heart not be troubled. Let your
[10:36] mind
[10:39] be at ease.
[10:48] And oh precious Lord, strip me of vain
[10:54] glory and pride.
[10:58] Please take away
[11:01] all that's left
[11:04] of self.
[11:07] Oh,
[11:09] Lord, have evidence
[11:15] make me
[11:19] I pray.
[11:24] Oh precious Lord, strip me of ang glory
[11:30] and pride.
[11:32] Please take away all that's left
[11:38] of self.
[11:41] Oh precious Lord, have preeminence
[11:48] make me humble.
[11:52] Oh, I pray once more.
[11:57] Oh, precious Lord, strip me of vain
[12:02] glory and crown.
[12:05] Please take away all that's left
[12:11] of self.
[12:14] Oh precious Lord, have preeminence,
[12:21] make me humble,
[12:25] I pray one more time, make it a prayer.
[12:29] And oh precious Lord, strip me of pain,
[12:35] glory, and
[12:38] please take away all that's left.
[12:44] of self.
[12:46] Oh precious Lord, have pendant,
[12:53] make me humble,
[12:57] I pray.
[13:02] As brother Chad comes this evening,
[13:04] let's go to the key of D.
[13:08] Quiet
[13:10] me.
[13:13] Let peaceful waterers
[13:17] flow.
[13:20] Learn to be still.
[13:25] Oh my soul,
[13:32] [Music]
[13:34] let
[13:35] me
[13:37] hear.
[13:40] My Jesus, draw me near.
[13:45] [Music]
[13:47] Touch me, Lord,
[13:50] and quiet
[13:53] me. Quiet me.
[13:58] [Music]
[14:00] Quiet
[14:01] [Music]
[14:03] me.
[14:06] Let peaceful waterers
[14:10] flow.
[14:13] Learn
[14:15] to be still.
[14:18] Oh my soul,
[14:23] [Music]
[14:26] let
[14:28] me
[14:30] hear
[14:32] my Jesus strongly.
[14:40] Touch me Lord
[14:42] and quiet.
[14:46] Sing with me one more time.
[14:51] In quiet
[14:56] me,
[14:58] let peaceful waterers
[15:02] flow
[15:05] and learn
[15:07] to be still.
[15:11] Oh my soul,
[15:16] [Music]
[15:19] let
[15:20] me
[15:22] hear
[15:24] my Jesus call me.
[15:29] [Music]
[15:31] You touch me, Lord,
[15:35] and quiet
[15:38] me.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together.
[15:46] Lord Jesus, we thank you, God, for the
[15:48] privilege of being here tonight,
[15:51] Lord, that you would draw us here, Lord,
[15:53] and that you would bring us into that
[15:55] unity, Lord, by worship, one heart, one
[15:58] accord.
[16:00] And God, that's the condition your
[16:01] children were in in the upper room,
[16:02] Lord, when your presence filled the
[16:04] room, when your power filled them. And
[16:07] God, may we be one, one heart, one
[16:09] accord,
[16:11] aligned, Lord, to you, Lord, with our
[16:13] desire to hear from you. And may you
[16:14] come and fill each one of us with your
[16:16] power, Lord. May the light of the
[16:19] gospel, may the illumination of your
[16:20] pillar of fire light each soul, Lord,
[16:23] quicken us to life, Lord, and guide our
[16:25] lives. God, we want to quiet ourselves,
[16:28] Lord. This world is so busy and our
[16:30] minds get so busy and life is so fast.
[16:33] Lord, we we're thankful for a time in
[16:36] the middle of the week, Lord, to draw
[16:37] aside that to quiet ourselves from the
[16:41] race of life and the pace of life and to
[16:44] focus our attention on you, Lord. And
[16:46] God, as we're focused on you, would you
[16:48] come and speak to us words of life? Come
[16:51] and instruct us in life, Lord. Encourage
[16:53] us, build us up, correct us, Lord.
[16:56] everything we have need of for this
[16:57] journey. We're looking to your word to
[16:59] supply it all. May you come now and give
[17:01] us a portion of that word this evening.
[17:04] May it strike our souls. May it come to
[17:06] life within us. And Lord, may that seed
[17:09] go into the good ground of our souls
[17:10] that you've prepared before the
[17:12] foundation of the world. And may it
[17:14] return to you a bountiful harvest. Lord,
[17:17] we love you. We ask that you would take
[17:18] this vessel of mind under your control.
[17:21] May you preach the gospel according to
[17:22] the way that you've designated in this
[17:24] end time through vessels of clay. Lord,
[17:28] I surrender to you. We surrender to
[17:29] that. May you come and speak your words
[17:32] and drop them into our hearts. We pray.
[17:35] May you have your way with us. In Jesus
[17:38] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[17:42] Amen. God bless you all. It's good to be
[17:44] here this evening. If you'd like to take
[17:46] your Bibles while we're still standing
[17:48] together and turn to the book of
[17:49] Deuteronomy. We'll go to the book of
[17:51] Deuteronomy. Thank you, musicians.
[17:54] While you're finding Deuteronomy, I just
[17:56] want to remind you that we have a
[17:57] fellowship dinner coming up this Sunday
[17:59] after service over in the fellowship
[18:00] hall and out in the pavilion. So, we're
[18:02] looking forward to that time together of
[18:04] fellowship. Also want to encourage you
[18:06] and remind you to sign up so we know
[18:08] what you're bringing so the those in the
[18:10] kitchen can make proper preparations.
[18:12] Amen. There was a link sent out. So, if
[18:14] you could do that, that'd be great. Also
[18:16] want to uh let you know that brother uh
[18:19] Gabe Smith will be ministering at Bible
[18:21] Believers this Sunday. So, remember him
[18:22] in prayer as he's preparing the rest of
[18:24] the week and he'll be over there on
[18:26] Sunday. So, we want to remember him
[18:28] through the weekend as well. And also, I
[18:31] want to say happy birthday, Brother Jim.
[18:32] God bless you, Brother Jim. It's good to
[18:35] celebrate your birthday together in
[18:36] church. Amen. It's a good place to be.
[18:39] Amen. I heard that in the back. I
[18:40] thought, praise God.
[18:43] Amen.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; All right, let's turn to the Deuteronomy
[18:47] chapter 7.
[18:49] Deuteronomy chapter 7. I just love that
[18:52] song, Quiet Me, because life is way too
[18:54] fast
[18:55] &gt;&gt; and this world is way too noisy and
[18:57] Leodysia is relentless in pace and at
[19:02] constantly ti tying up our attention and
[19:05] tying up our time and but I thank God
[19:08] that he's drawn us together to hear from
[19:10] him. I thank God for a Wednesday night
[19:12] service, for a Sunday service, for the
[19:14] fellowships in between, for those
[19:16] special times. And and I see the wisdom
[19:18] of God in setting it up like this where
[19:20] we constantly come back to change pace,
[19:23] to stop what we're doing, to realign
[19:26] because we got to constantly realign.
[19:27] This world is trying to knock us off
[19:29] true north.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; But God keeps bringing us back together,
[19:32] to line us up, to remind us of who we
[19:34] are, to remind us of our purpose. Amen.
[19:37] to give us strength and courage to
[19:39] continue doing what he's called us to do
[19:41] in this end time. So, it's good to be
[19:43] here together. In Deuteronomy chapter 7,
[19:46] I'd like to begin reading from verse 6.
[19:49] Says, "For thou are a holy people unto
[19:51] the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God hath
[19:54] chosen thee to be a special people unto
[19:56] himself, above all the people that are
[19:59] upon the face of the earth. The Lord did
[20:01] not set his love upon you, nor choose
[20:03] you, because you were more in number
[20:05] than any people. For you were the fewest
[20:08] of all people. But because the Lord
[20:10] loved you, and because he would keep the
[20:12] oath which he had sworn unto your
[20:14] fathers, hath the Lord brought you out
[20:16] with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out
[20:18] of the house of bondman from the hand of
[20:20] Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Amen. May God
[20:23] bless you as you take your seats and as
[20:25] we look at his word. Uh
[20:30] I love I love this portion of scripture.
[20:33] We've read it many times. But it begins,
[20:35] "Thou art a holy people." And when God
[20:39] begins to speak to them, he doesn't he's
[20:42] not dealing with a a super pious very
[20:45] religious perfect set of people. So when
[20:48] he says you're a holy people, he's not
[20:50] he is not giving a a statement of their
[20:53] religious condition.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; But holy means set apart or sanctified,
[20:59] separated. And God says, "You are a
[21:01] separated people. I separated you to
[21:04] myself." It wasn't what they did. It's
[21:06] what he did that made them holy.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; All right. So you are a holy people. And
[21:12] he's talking to people that have come
[21:14] through a wilderness journey and wanted
[21:16] to go back to Egypt and failed to go to
[21:18] Kadesh Barnea and and and complained in
[21:21] the bitter waters of Myra. They they had
[21:24] every problem and complaint and then
[21:26] they got upset about the mana that was
[21:29] provided and that was loathome to them
[21:31] and then they wanted meat and God fed
[21:32] them meat till it came out their noses
[21:34] and then they complained again and had
[21:36] fiery serpents and and he says, "Thou
[21:38] art a holy people." I don't think he was
[21:40] commending their conduct.
[21:42] I think he was speaking of their
[21:44] condition because of what? Because of
[21:46] his choice and his separating them out.
[21:48] So I tell you today, you're a holy
[21:50] people.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; You're not a holy people because of your
[21:53] conduct. You're not a holy people
[21:54] because of your perfection. You're holy
[21:57] because he chose you out of this world
[21:59] and separated you unto himself. That
[22:01] makes you a holy people.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thou art a holy people unto
[22:07] the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God has
[22:09] chosen thee to be a special people unto
[22:11] himself. He didn't say, "I chose you
[22:13] because you're a special people." I
[22:15] chose you to be a special people.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; Are we getting it?
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God didn't choose us because we
[22:23] were special. God didn't choose us
[22:24] because we were better. God didn't
[22:26] choose us because we had our act
[22:28] together. God God's choice
[22:31] makes us a special people because he
[22:34] chose us to be a special people. set
[22:36] aside, separated, drawn to himself,
[22:39] taught by his word, and different than
[22:41] everybody else on the planet.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Not different in themselves, different
[22:45] in his choice
[22:47] &gt;&gt; and in his teaching.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God.
[22:51] And then, I have chosen thee to be a
[22:53] special people unto himself, above all
[22:55] the people that are upon the face of the
[22:57] earth. The Lord did not set his love
[22:59] upon you, nor choose you, because you
[23:01] were more in number than the people, for
[23:02] you were the fewest of all people. Now
[23:04] he's getting down to it. I did not
[23:06] choose you because of your merit.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; I chose you not because you're great.
[23:13] You're not great. That's what he's
[23:14] telling him. Not because you were the
[23:16] greatest. You weren't the greatest. You
[23:17] were the least.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; That's what he That's what Moses is
[23:20] telling them.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; But because the Lord loved you.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Because the Lord loved
[23:27] you and he would keep his o his oath. So
[23:30] why has God Amen. Why has God sanctified
[23:33] us? separated us out, called us holy,
[23:35] separated to himself to be a special
[23:37] people. Why has he done that? Because we
[23:40] were great? No. Because we we had it all
[23:42] together? No. Amen. Because he chose
[23:45] before the foundation of the world this.
[23:46] And that's his love. He set his love
[23:48] upon us. Amen. Not because we were
[23:51] great, cuz we weren't. Not because we
[23:52] deserved it, because we didn't. But
[23:54] because he chose it according to his
[23:57] oath, his promise. Amen. the word that
[23:59] he established before the foundation of
[24:01] the world.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; I say, "Praise God."
[24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. It does so good to be reminded of
[24:09] these things. Amen. So many times we we
[24:11] we don't always come to church to hear
[24:13] something new. We come come to church to
[24:15] hear something needful.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't always need something
[24:19] new. We need something needful. We need
[24:21] to be reminded of who we are and why we
[24:23] are what we are. Amen. Amen.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; And there's a reason that that that we
[24:28] need that because we're human beings
[24:30] living in a world that's giving us wrong
[24:32] messages all the time. And even our own
[24:34] human mind and even our own flesh is
[24:36] giving us wrong messages and wrong
[24:38] signals all the time. We need the word
[24:40] of God to conquer even this vessel that
[24:42] we live in and the world that we live
[24:44] in. And only the word of God, only the
[24:46] truth will overcome the lie.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're dwelling in the midst of lie
[24:51] &gt;&gt; and a body that's a lie.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz what's a lie? The truth
[24:55] perverted. You were supposed to be in
[24:57] human form, but not fallen human form,
[24:59] not hybrid human form. So this is a lie.
[25:01] I live in a lie.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God has revealed to us the
[25:07] truth. Amen.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Frank, if you want to go
[25:10] ahead and bring up the PowerPoint. I
[25:13] want to speak on the strength of grace
[25:16] uh this evening. And the message of
[25:18] grace, Brother Bam preaching 61. He
[25:20] said, "Sovereign grace is from a
[25:21] sovereign one."
[25:23] Sovereign grace from a sovereign one.
[25:26] Sovereign, what can it do? Sovereign can
[25:28] do whatever it wants to.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; A sovereign means the ruling authority.
[25:32] The sovereign is the king.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; So the king is called the sovereign.
[25:36] He's the sovereign of the nation. He's
[25:38] the one who makes the decisions for the
[25:40] whole nation. He's sovereign,
[25:42] &gt;&gt; right? He gets to choose. So the
[25:44] sovereign is the king. So, we have
[25:47] sovereign grace,
[25:49] &gt;&gt; which means the ruling authority that
[25:51] nobody can advise or tell what to do,
[25:53] but gets to make his own choice. He's
[25:56] the one who put grace upon you and chose
[25:58] you by his grace. Amen. It's the king's
[26:00] grace on you.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it can't fail. There's no
[26:06] higher authority but the sovereign.
[26:08] There's nobody else that can rule.
[26:09] There's nobody that that there's nobody
[26:12] that can redig what he has done. Amen.
[26:14] Because it's sovereign grace.
[26:17] Amen. This is special grace.
[26:20] Sovereign grace can only be given by one
[26:22] that's sovereign. Praise God.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; We use the term sovereign grace so much,
[26:27] but I love when we break it down and
[26:28] think about it. Amen. We've got
[26:30] sovereign grace has been bestowed upon
[26:32] us. Amen. So, it has to be bestowed by a
[26:34] sovereign one. And God is sovereign. So,
[26:38] he can give sovereign grace. Therefore,
[26:40] being sovereign, grace don't have to ask
[26:42] anybody.
[26:44] It don't it doesn't it does what it
[26:46] wants to. Isn't that wonderful? It don't
[26:49] ha has to ask can I do this or can I do
[26:52] that? Can I? Must I will I doesn't do
[26:55] it. It does it itself. Grace is
[26:57] sovereign. Therefore, he can save the
[26:59] vilest. He can save the worst. He can
[27:02] save the impurst. He can save the
[27:04] immoralist. He can heal the sickest.
[27:06] Hallelujah.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good news, friends. Because
[27:10] there's sovereign grace. And nobody can
[27:12] trump sovereign grace. Sovereign's
[27:14] coming from the sovereign.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to ask permission. And
[27:18] it doesn't have to apologize. And it
[27:19] doesn't have to give excuses for why.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; And he can save the worst, the vilest,
[27:25] the impurest, the immoralist.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Why? By his grace.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to Galatians together.
[27:33] I want to look a little bit at the
[27:34] Apostle Paul because he's such an easy
[27:36] example of this. So, we're going to pull
[27:38] out a few scriptures from the life of
[27:40] Paul.
[27:42] And then keep moving.
[27:46] Galatians chapter 1
[27:50] verse 13.
[27:55] Galatians 1
[27:57] and3
[28:01] says, "For you have heard of my
[28:03] conversion in time past in the Jews
[28:05] religion, how that beyond measure I
[28:07] persecuted the church of God and wasted
[28:10] it and profited in the Jews religion
[28:13] above many my equals in my own nation,
[28:16] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[28:17] traditions of my fathers. But when it
[28:20] pleased God, who separated me from my
[28:22] mother's womb and called me by his grace
[28:25] to reveal his son in me that I might
[28:27] preach him among the heathen,
[28:29] immediately I conferred not with flesh
[28:32] and blood. So, here is Paul in in the
[28:35] book of Galatians giving a little bit of
[28:36] his background and he says, "You all
[28:38] know, you've heard my testimony. You've
[28:40] heard the story of my of my conversion,
[28:43] how that uh uh he says
[28:48] um
[28:50] that I persecuted the church of God and
[28:52] wasted it." Here's here's Paul going
[28:56] back and reflecting on the condition he
[28:58] was when God called him. And the
[29:00] condition he was in in when God called
[29:03] him is he was a man who was vi fighting
[29:05] the very truth. He was fighting the very
[29:08] God of heaven. He was calling Antichrist
[29:11] the very Christ. He was saying things
[29:12] that were he was blaspheing. He was
[29:14] saying things were ungodly that were
[29:16] godly.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Paul even said he
[29:19] blasphemed but he did it ignorantly. And
[29:21] so this is he's going back through the
[29:24] condition that he was in. Because when
[29:26] he shows the condition that he was in,
[29:27] then he can show the grace of God that
[29:30] called him to the position he's now in.
[29:32] Because the condition he was in did not
[29:34] merit his position that God called him
[29:36] to. He didn't earn that spot, friends.
[29:39] Amen. when he's out there hauling
[29:41] Christians into prison and having them
[29:43] stoned and killed and consenting to
[29:45] their death, separating families and
[29:47] tormenting and wreaking havoc of the
[29:48] church of God, he did not earn his apost
[29:51] apostilhip by merit.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. In fact, if we went by merit, he
[29:56] deserved death. I mean, he deserved
[29:58] death and retribution. He was killing
[30:00] Christ. Amen. He was killing the body of
[30:02] Christ. He was persecuting Jesus Christ.
[30:05] He was fighting the truth, fighting the
[30:07] word, fighting against God, and killing
[30:09] God's elect seed.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; What did he deserve? A promotion to
[30:14] apostilhip.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. He deserved anything but
[30:19] that. But God had a predestinated plan
[30:22] for them. God had a choice for him. And
[30:24] it wasn't even what Paul wanted. It
[30:26] wasn't what he deserved, but it was what
[30:28] the sovereign grace had already
[30:30] determined would happen. That's why it
[30:33] has to be by grace. There's no other way
[30:35] that we can make it in this day unless
[30:37] it's sovereign grace.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we'll look at this in the book
[30:42] of Acts. We've been through it many
[30:44] times. Acts 9. And there was a certain
[30:46] disciple at Damascus named Ananas. And
[30:49] to him, said the Lord in a vision,
[30:50] Ananas. And he said, behold, I am here,
[30:52] Lord. And the Lord said unto him, Arise
[30:54] and go into the street which is called
[30:56] Straight, and inquire in the house of
[30:58] Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus. For
[31:01] behold, he prayth and hath seen in a
[31:03] vision a man named Ananas coming in and
[31:05] putting his hand on him that he might
[31:07] receive his sight. Then Ananas answered,
[31:10] Lord, I have heard many of this man, how
[31:13] much evil he hath done to the saints at
[31:15] Jerusalem, and here he hath authority
[31:17] from the chief priest to bind all that
[31:19] call on thy name. But the Lord said unto
[31:21] him, "Go thy way, for he is a chosen
[31:25] vessel unto me to bear my name before
[31:27] the Gentiles and kings and the children
[31:30] of Israel, for I will show him how great
[31:32] things he must suffer for my name's
[31:34] sake."
[31:35] Amen. Poor Ananas
[31:38] &gt;&gt; got the call to go find Saul of Tarsus,
[31:42] and he's trying to stay away from Saul
[31:44] of Tarsus. They all got word that he's
[31:47] coming and he's got letters and and
[31:48] authority from the chief priest and the
[31:50] elders. Amen. And they're all running
[31:52] and hiding. Nobody wants to go meet Saul
[31:55] on his road to Damascus. Amen. Because
[31:57] of the journey that he was on and the
[31:59] purpose of that journey. Amen. And the
[32:01] purpose of that journey was wickedness.
[32:03] The purpose of that journey was evil.
[32:05] The purpose of that journey was harming
[32:07] the work of God.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; But God was going to interrupt him in
[32:11] the middle of his journey to destroy
[32:13] God's elect. Amen.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Not because he earned it. Not because he
[32:18] was good. Not because God said, "Wow,
[32:21] he's so zealous. I'm going to give him a
[32:23] &gt;&gt; promotion."
[32:25] &gt;&gt; No way. Ananas, you know, it's amazing.
[32:29] You would you would think I I always
[32:30] think this way. The the word of the Lord
[32:33] comes and God speaks to you.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Are you sure, Lord? Are
[32:38] you sure you got the right Saul of T?
[32:42] This one is the one that's doing all of
[32:44] this. Do you know who you're talking
[32:46] about?
[32:48] And you can't blame Ananas. How can you
[32:50] blame him? How what would you do if it
[32:52] was you? Amen. When you say, "Jump up,
[32:53] click your heels, and say, "Oh, I've
[32:55] been looking forward to this day." You'd
[32:56] be saying, "Lord, are you I I you know,
[33:00] I Yeah, I know you're the sovereign God
[33:02] and all knowing and omnipotent and all
[33:04] of that, but do you know what he's
[33:05] doing?"
[33:07] [Applause]
[33:07] [Laughter]
[33:10] and and he was true. That was honest.
[33:14] That was a true report. That was the
[33:15] reality of Saul. But God knew something
[33:18] else. And God was going to bestow his
[33:20] grace upon this man.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; The only way that he could use Saul
[33:26] was by grace.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Because it was impossible to use him by
[33:33] merit. Yeah.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; The only way
[33:38] &gt;&gt; that he could that Paul could be an
[33:40] apostle and that Paul could get the
[33:41] mysteries of Christ and Paul could
[33:43] preach the mysteries. The only way was
[33:45] by grace. He could never God could never
[33:50] have used him based on a merit system.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; That's why it has to be by grace.
[33:57] And I think Paul went so much in the
[34:00] wrong direction with so much zeal and he
[34:03] had regrets the rest of his life.
[34:05] Brother Bam tells us that that Saul it
[34:08] always bothered Paul about the death of
[34:10] Stephen and and and also the other
[34:12] persecution. And brother Bam said that's
[34:14] why Paul wanted to die a martyr's death
[34:18] because of his guilt and his shame for
[34:21] what he had done. So it bothered him all
[34:23] of his life. But but yet God was going
[34:26] to use this man to preach the message of
[34:28] grace for the first time.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; He was going to use this man to separate
[34:32] law and grace and establish the covenant
[34:34] of grace with the Gentiles and help
[34:36] whenever Israelites could move into
[34:38] grace and establish the covenant of
[34:40] grace with the Gentiles. Amen. Praise
[34:42] God. It was going to have to take a man
[34:44] that understood his position by grace to
[34:47] preach the message of grace.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the only way that Paul could
[34:53] take that position was by the power of
[34:55] sovereign grace. By the strength of
[34:57] grace. It couldn't be in the strength of
[34:59] Saul.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; It had to be in the strength of grace.
[35:05] He says in 1 Corinthians 15, "And last
[35:08] of all, he was seen of me also as one of
[35:10] born out of due time. For I am the least
[35:14] of the apostles that I'm not meat to be
[35:16] called an apostle because I persecuted
[35:18] the church of God. But by the grace of
[35:20] God, I am what I am. And his grace which
[35:25] was bestowed upon me was not in vain,
[35:26] but I labored more abundantly than they
[35:28] all. Yet not I, but the grace of God
[35:31] which was with me. I think Paul learned
[35:34] I think Paul understood grace. I think
[35:36] he had a good understanding of what
[35:37] grace was because when he refers back to
[35:40] his apostilhip, he's always he's he's
[35:42] often telling the church why he's not
[35:44] worthy to be an apostle and why he
[35:47] shouldn't be an apostle, why he's the
[35:49] least likely to be an apostle. Amen. And
[35:51] so Paul is is always reaffirming his
[35:54] position is by grace,
[35:57] &gt;&gt; not by merit.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; So what about your position?
[36:03] &gt;&gt; How'd you get in your position? because
[36:05] you were a good boy and did everything
[36:07] right and perfectly obedient and always
[36:10] got it right and always did right,
[36:11] always looked right, always dressed
[36:12] right, always acted right, always had
[36:14] the right attitude and always had the
[36:15] right atmosphere around you and and the
[36:17] first time you heard the message, you
[36:18] took it and everything the prophet said,
[36:20] you did it exactly right. So, you were
[36:22] awarded a merit system and you were
[36:23] allowed to come into the bride of Christ
[36:25] and now God loves you because you've
[36:27] done everything right.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; You see, that defeats grace completely.
[36:33] Amen.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we can understand this is
[36:37] why this is why this mentality is a
[36:40] human mentality.
[36:42] It's stuck. It's ingrained in our brain
[36:44] to think this way. Amen. Everything
[36:47] around us is based off a merit system.
[36:49] Your your work and your your your
[36:51] promotions and everything that you work
[36:53] for and everything you labor for. You
[36:55] work you labor. You do right. You get
[36:57] good. And there's reward. There's a
[36:58] there's a whole reward system set up for
[37:01] that. And we in our minds think this
[37:03] way. Amen. The problem is when we take
[37:05] this way, this method to our salvation.
[37:08] Amen. The problem with that is is we're
[37:10] in fallen flesh and we can never get it
[37:12] right all the time. So when we base it
[37:14] even subconsciously on a merit system,
[37:16] amen, every time our merit falls below
[37:19] par, we start to struggle with am I a
[37:21] child of God? Am I even saved? Do I have
[37:23] the Holy Ghost? Was I born again? And we
[37:25] start struggling with all of these
[37:27] questions. And why are we asking
[37:28] ourselves the questions? We're asking
[37:30] ourselves the questions because we
[37:32] failed to meet the mark.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Meaning in our minds is a merit system
[37:38] for our salvation.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[37:40] &gt;&gt; because the very minute we start to
[37:42] think that way, Amen. then we we're back
[37:45] to carnal humanistic thinking.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; And listen, I don't blame you for that.
[37:51] I got the same thing going on between my
[37:52] these two ears of mine. We just have to
[37:55] recognize it and fight against it
[37:57] because God never saved me because I was
[37:59] good. Because God by his sovereign grace
[38:01] can save the vilest, the immoralist, the
[38:04] the most impure. And that's what he did
[38:06] for me.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; So if he can save me by grace, can he
[38:11] not keep me by grace? Can he not keep me
[38:14] saved by grace?
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Hey, praise God. It's a it's a simple
[38:20] concept, but it's so hard for the human
[38:23] character to handle.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; It's simple, but it's tough for our
[38:28] human minds to cope with it.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; And so, and those sometimes who do cope
[38:34] with it go the wrong way with it.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; In fact, that it's God's grace. I can do
[38:38] anything I ever want to do and I'm under
[38:39] the grace of God. Well, that just shows
[38:41] you haven't been recipient of true grace
[38:43] yet. Because true grace does not that
[38:46] when you receive grace that way. Amen.
[38:48] It doesn't lead you down that path.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; So let's keep moving in this thought
[38:53] here. And the Queen of Sheba says it
[38:56] just as goes to show a person has to be
[38:58] ordained of God to believe or they'll
[39:01] never believe anyhow. They have nothing
[39:03] to believe with. They just don't have no
[39:06] depth in their soul.
[39:11] Listen,
[39:13] you're not a believer
[39:16] because of merit and intelligence.
[39:19] It's because God ordained you to believe
[39:21] because you have something placed in
[39:23] your soul to believe with
[39:26] &gt;&gt; and that not of yourselves. It's the
[39:28] gift of God.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; The faith to believe, to receive his
[39:32] grace is a gift.
[39:35] So there's no way that we can uh the the
[39:37] scripture says that where is boasting?
[39:39] It's excluded. Why is it excluded?
[39:42] Because I never did this of my own. I
[39:44] never worked my way into it or up to it.
[39:46] I never overcame. I never studied
[39:49] enough. There was no way that I crossed
[39:51] a certain finish line to merit this
[39:54] grace. Amen. This was something that God
[39:56] freely bestowed upon me. And even the
[39:58] ability to believe in his grace didn't
[40:01] come from me. It came from him that's in
[40:03] me. Amen.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Because he placed that seed in you
[40:06] before the foundation of the world. He
[40:08] placed it in your soul. Amen. That's
[40:10] what that's the part of you that's
[40:11] believing. It's not your brain. That's
[40:13] why your brain can question. That's why
[40:15] your brain can doubt. That's why your
[40:17] brain can waver. Amen. The wavering of
[40:19] the brain has absolutely nothing to do
[40:21] with your salvation.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; The battle in the mind. And brother Bam
[40:26] said God can plant he said that Satan
[40:29] can plant thoughts in your mind. He
[40:31] cannot read your mind, but he can plant
[40:33] thoughts in your mind. If he can plant
[40:34] thoughts in your mind, then you probably
[40:36] shouldn't trust all the thoughts in your
[40:37] mind.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Pretty pretty this pretty simple logic.
[40:43] I thank God for a prophet who could
[40:45] break it down so easy for us. We
[40:47] probably shouldn't trust all the
[40:48] thoughts going through our mind.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; So your mind can doubt, your mind can
[40:53] question, your mind can become troubled.
[40:55] Amen. Your mind your mind can do the
[40:57] calculation. I've been this bad this
[41:00] many times this week. Therefore, I'm
[41:02] probably not a son or daughter of God.
[41:04] Your mind can come up with that formula.
[41:06] Amen. That's okay. The mind's the mind.
[41:08] Amen. But there's got to be something
[41:10] deeper than the mind that could connect
[41:12] to this word and say, "But I'm not
[41:14] worthy to be a son of God. I've done all
[41:16] of those things and I'm ashamed of them
[41:18] and I'm not worthy to be called a son or
[41:20] daughter of God. But by the grace of
[41:22] God, I am what I am."
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Not because I was a good boy this week
[41:26] or a bad boy this week. I am this
[41:28] because God chose me before the
[41:30] foundation of the world. He set his love
[41:32] upon me.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Listen, I can't intellectually tell
[41:37] you why. All I can do is believe.
[41:39] Something in me says, I believe he set
[41:42] his love upon me
[41:44] &gt;&gt; and I'm a recipient of his grace.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; So, this is why it can only be by the
[41:49] strength of grace. It can never be by
[41:52] human strength.
[41:53] That will always fail.
[41:56] Uh Jesus says, ' But there are some of
[41:59] you that believe not. For Jesus knew
[42:01] from the beginning who they were that
[42:03] believe not and who should betray him.
[42:05] And he said, "Therefore I said unto you
[42:06] that no man can come unto me except it
[42:09] were given unto him of my father."
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; You know
[42:17] the
[42:19] Jesus never
[42:21] hated Jud Judas because he was an
[42:23] unbeliever. Amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; You never see the disciples riing
[42:28] against Judas because he was an
[42:29] unbeliever.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Because Judas couldn't be a believer if
[42:34] he wasn't a believer.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; It's why you see, you know, you see in
[42:43] the Bible that that when you find out
[42:47] that we are what we are by the grace of
[42:49] God,
[42:51] it doesn't allow me to despise anybody
[42:53] else. in any condition they're in. I
[42:56] can't despise them. I can I can be hurt
[42:58] for them. I can not like the activity,
[43:00] the conduct, the things that are We can
[43:03] despise immoral conduct.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; We can despise things that are gross or
[43:07] perverted or harmful or dangerous or
[43:09] evil or wicked. You can despise all
[43:11] that, but I can never despise a person
[43:13] for being an unbeliever. And I can never
[43:16] despise somebody for not knowing the
[43:17] truth. And I can never despise somebody
[43:19] for not having any overcoming power.
[43:22] Because if it was not for the grace of
[43:24] God, I would have no overcoming power. I
[43:27] would have no ability to believe. I
[43:29] don't believe of my own merit. I believe
[43:30] of the seed gene of God that he's put in
[43:32] my soul.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; And so that's why for for us, amen, we
[43:38] can just take people as they are. Amen.
[43:40] And not not hate them for what they are.
[43:42] Hate maybe despise what they do, but I
[43:45] can never despise this human being.
[43:47] Amen. Because where would I be without
[43:48] the grace of God? Where would Saul of
[43:51] Tarsus be if God had not found him on
[43:54] the road to Damascus and and changed the
[43:56] whole course of his life? Where would
[43:57] any Where would the fisherman be if
[43:59] Jesus hadn't stepped on the shore and
[44:01] say, "Hey, drop your net and come follow
[44:03] me." Amen. If God didn't find and Jesus
[44:05] says, "You didn't you didn't choose me.
[44:07] I chose you."
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Where would we be if he didn't choose
[44:11] us?
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So these great mighty men, Peter,
[44:16] he became all that Peter was. Amen. But
[44:18] Peter knew that Peter didn't do anything
[44:21] Peter did by Peter's own strength. He
[44:23] knew that Peter did it by the grace of
[44:24] God because in his own strength, he
[44:27] denied the Lord three times to save his
[44:29] skin.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; They all failed. So it it takes God.
[44:36] In Matthew 13, he says, "And in them is
[44:38] fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which
[44:40] saith, by hearing you shall hear and
[44:43] shall not understand, and seeing you
[44:44] shall see and shall not perceive. For
[44:46] this people's heart is waxed gross, and
[44:48] their ears are dull of hearing, and
[44:49] their eyes they have closed, lest at any
[44:52] time they should see with their eyes,
[44:53] hear with their ears, and shall
[44:55] understand with their heart, and should
[44:57] be converted. You got that?
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; So if you see with your eyes,
[45:04] &gt;&gt; hear with your ears, and understand with
[45:06] your heart, you get converted.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; How are you converted? Because you see,
[45:14] you hear, and you understand.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; That's how you get converted.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; So, how do I see and hear and
[45:24] understand?
[45:25] &gt;&gt; He says, "And I should heal them, but
[45:27] blessed are your eyes, for they see, and
[45:30] your ears, for they hear." And all the
[45:32] way back in Exodus, I want to pull a
[45:34] scripture from Moses. Moses complaining
[45:36] he can't talk. He can't do anything
[45:37] right. And here's what God said to
[45:39] Moses. And the Lord said unto him, "Who
[45:41] hath made man's mouth? Or who maketh the
[45:44] dumb or the deaf or the seeing or the
[45:46] blind? Have not I the Lord. Who gives
[45:50] seeing eyes?" God. Who gives hearing
[45:52] ears? God. Who gives a heart that can
[45:55] perceive? God.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; So, how are you converted? Because God's
[46:01] grace bestowed upon you. Amen. A seed of
[46:04] eternal life. Amen. When you heard the
[46:07] word, you had ears to hear. You had eyes
[46:09] to see. Amen. You had a heart to
[46:11] perceive what made you different than
[46:13] somebody else because he set his love on
[46:15] you for no good reason that has to do
[46:18] with you.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; As a human being,
[46:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; So, this is what should give us
[46:25] compassion.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; This is what should set us apart. We
[46:29] should we should we should uh be able to
[46:32] re uh uh not relate but we should be
[46:34] able to interact with people on a
[46:35] totally different level because we
[46:38] should have an understanding.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; We should have an understanding of how
[46:42] impossible it would be to serve God in
[46:46] this message without God's grace.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Impossible.
[46:55] In Romans chapter 11,
[46:58] he says, "God hath not cast away his
[47:00] people which he forneew. What you not
[47:03] that the scripture saith of Elias how he
[47:04] maketh intercession to God again against
[47:07] Israel, saying, Lord, they have killed
[47:09] thy prophets, and dig down thine altars,
[47:11] and I am left alone, and they seek my
[47:13] life. But what saith the answer of God
[47:16] unto him? I have reserved to myself
[47:18] 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to
[47:21] the image Baal."
[47:23] I love that.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Listen, listen. I want to I want to read
[47:28] what he did not say.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; There are 7,000 men who kept themselves
[47:33] clean and didn't bow to the image Baal.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Cuz if it said that, it would look like
[47:40] the strength of resisting was on the
[47:42] people.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; But the strength of resisting, the
[47:45] perversion in that day was in God.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't in the 7,000. It was in
[47:55] God who reserved to himself 7,000. And
[47:58] if God hadn't reserved to himself 7,000,
[48:00] none would be reserved.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[48:03] &gt;&gt; That's the fallacy of humanity.
[48:06] He said, even so then at this present
[48:08] time also there is a remnant according
[48:10] to the election of grace. And if by
[48:12] grace then it is no more of works,
[48:14] otherwise grace is no more grace. But if
[48:16] it be of works, then it is no more
[48:18] grace, otherwise work is no more work. I
[48:21] love this. I want to get into this, but
[48:23] I'm not going to get into this. Maybe
[48:24] some other time. I got to skip over it,
[48:26] even though I don't want to, but I I'm
[48:28] going to. Says, "What then? Israel hath
[48:31] not obtained that which it seeketh for,
[48:32] but the election hath obtained it, and
[48:35] the rest were blinded."
[48:38] &gt;&gt; The rest were blinded.
[48:41] Abraham says,
[48:44] "Noah broke his covenant or the Noic
[48:47] covenant was broke. Adam's covenant was
[48:49] broke. anything that God makes with man.
[48:51] But God was determined and would save
[48:53] God was determined and would save man
[48:55] because he forneew man. And he was
[48:57] determined to save him. So he saved man
[49:00] by an unconditional covenant. Amen. No
[49:03] uncertainty about it. He said, "I will."
[49:06] It's holy by grace and unconditional,
[49:09] which makes it by grace. Not if you
[49:11] will, I will. Oh, how glad I am for
[49:13] that. Not what I am, but what he was.
[49:16] Amen. So when God come and chose
[49:19] Abraham, listen, he chose Abraham when
[49:22] Abraham was steeped in idolatry.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; He was an idoltor. He chose Abraham when
[49:27] he was living in of the Chaldes.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; He was living where Babylon was. He was
[49:34] living where the false religion broke
[49:35] out. He was an idoltor. His father was
[49:37] an idoltor. Listen, he didn't go choose
[49:40] Abraham because Abraham had some idea
[49:43] about God and had the truth and was
[49:45] holding on to the truth. He chose
[49:46] Abraham in the midst of his ignorance,
[49:48] in the midst of his false understanding
[49:50] about God. And he come and chose Abraham
[49:52] out of everybody else and said, "I
[49:54] choose you, Abraham, and I'm going to
[49:56] give you an inheritance and all the
[49:57] things he promised to Abraham." And none
[49:59] of it was based on the merit of Abraham.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; It was based on the election of God.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; What did Abraham do to get the promise
[50:08] of all that land? Yeah.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; I took him up on a on a hill and he
[50:13] says, "Look to the north and to the
[50:14] south, to the east and the west. As far
[50:16] as your eye can see, I've given it to
[50:17] thee and to all thy sea." What did he do
[50:19] to get that? I mean, what what what work
[50:21] did he do? What merit? What skills? What
[50:23] did he do? They only had one thing that
[50:25] he did that pleased God. And that was he
[50:27] believed God.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; And when God says something to him, he
[50:30] said, "Amen, Lord." And that, "Amen,
[50:32] Lord," come from something down inside
[50:33] Abraham that was given to him before the
[50:35] foundation of the world. And it was a
[50:37] little piece of God laying down in
[50:38] there.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; And he had the capacity to say when he
[50:42] heard the word, "That sounds right to
[50:43] me." And that the capacity didn't come
[50:45] from his brain. It came from his soul.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; And all he had to do was believe.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; All that's it. All he had to do was
[50:54] believe. And God says, "You got all
[50:56] this, you and all of your seed after
[50:58] you."
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; This is why the the nations have always
[51:02] been jealous of Israel.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because the God just gave it to
[51:06] him.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; For no reason.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; No good reason. Just because he loved
[51:11] them.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:16] That's why it's so hard for some sisters
[51:18] when when one girl gets proposed to and
[51:20] she shows up at church with a diamond
[51:22] ring, it's hard not to feel that little
[51:24] bit of tinge. You're like, "Wait, she's
[51:25] not so special. I'm as good."
[51:30] Because why did that man put that ring
[51:32] on her? because he loved her.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Not because she was the smartest, the
[51:36] best, the most able, the most eligible,
[51:39] the one who fixes the best cherry pie.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Just because he loves her.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's the only reason. And
[51:48] God has chose chose his nation because
[51:51] he loved him. He chose us because he
[51:53] loves us.
[51:55] And he was going to keep his oath.
[51:58] So, it's good to be a child of Abraham
[52:00] because if you're a child of Abraham,
[52:01] you're part of this unconditional
[52:02] covenant. Not what you will, what he's
[52:05] already done.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; The message of grace, he says, think of
[52:10] it.
[52:11] Love and grace is sisters. Twin sisters.
[52:14] You can't have grace without love.
[52:16] They're twin sisters. That's exactly
[52:17] right. Before you can have grace, you
[52:19] have to have love. Before you can
[52:21] actually show somebody a favor, you love
[52:23] them. Right or wrong, you have to love
[52:25] them anyhow or you can't see. Love and
[52:28] grace is the same thing. They're just
[52:29] twin sisters. That's all. Love and
[52:31] grace. So, why are the recipients of our
[52:33] grace? Because he loves us.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; So,
[52:38] you know, you can say you can say why
[52:40] all you want to say why.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Just keep on saying why. It doesn't
[52:45] matter why. The why doesn't matter. The
[52:48] fact is he loves us and he bestowed his
[52:50] grace upon us. And what kind of grace?
[52:52] Sovereign grace. That's the best kind.
[52:54] Yeah.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Listen, you don't want church grace. You
[52:58] don't want a system grace. You don't
[52:59] want an organization grace. You don't
[53:01] want a formula grace or a creed grace.
[53:03] What you want is sovereign grace that
[53:05] comes from the sovereign.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; It's unquestionable.
[53:09] Amen. But that sovereign grace is based
[53:11] on love. Because before you can favor
[53:14] somebody, you have to love them. So he
[53:17] loved us from before the foundation of
[53:19] the world.
[53:21] You know, we know that to be true.
[53:24] There's not a person in here that would
[53:26] fail that test.
[53:28] The problem is accepting it all the
[53:31] time.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Receiving that truth
[53:36] 100% of the time, every minute of the
[53:39] day.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; That's the challenge.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; That's where the war is going on. That's
[53:43] where the greatest battle ever fought
[53:45] going on in our mind to constantly align
[53:47] with that truth and not the lie.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; That's where the battle is. Cuz this is
[53:52] not earthshattering. This is not rocket
[53:54] science. This is not a brand new
[53:55] message, but this is something that
[53:57] we're struggling with that that many
[53:58] people in different people in different
[54:00] levels struggle with. And they're
[54:01] struggling with the battle in their mind
[54:03] because of the man in the mirror.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; That's why we need to to stop focusing
[54:08] on that man, but the one who gives
[54:09] sovereign grace.
[54:11] And Galatians said, "For in Jesus
[54:13] Christ, neither circumcision avaleth
[54:15] anything, nor un uncircumcision, but
[54:17] faith which workketh by love." Faith
[54:20] workketh by love. We're a recipient of
[54:22] our his love. We love him because he
[54:24] first loved us. That's what gives us
[54:25] faith to believe in him. Because he
[54:27] bestowed his love on us and there was
[54:29] something in us that could love him
[54:30] back.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; And that's how faith works.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; In Romans chapter 5, he says, "Moreover,
[54:38] the law entered that the offense might
[54:40] abound."
[54:43] Do you catch that?
[54:45] The law entered that everything man did
[54:48] was wrong would be more wrong.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; But you remember brother Bam says they
[54:56] they instead of grace they asked for a
[54:59] law. They wanted something that they
[55:00] could do. So God gave them a law and the
[55:03] the law was perfect. There's not a thing
[55:04] wrong with the law. It's got the wisdom
[55:06] and character of God embedded in it.
[55:08] It's the word of God. It's not wrong in
[55:10] any way. The law is perfect.
[55:13] The problem is the men who tried to keep
[55:14] the law as a means to getting God's
[55:16] favor and and appropriating his love
[55:19] could never keep the law.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; So they kept themselves separated from
[55:23] God by the own law that they requested.
[55:25] Amen. So the law came so that sin might
[55:28] abound.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Meaning once God says don't do this
[55:34] &gt;&gt; now every time you do that you know
[55:36] you're wrong. Yeah.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Before if he's not specifically saying
[55:41] don't do that, it may not be God's plan.
[55:43] It may not be God's thought. It may not
[55:45] be God's character, but you don't know
[55:47] that it's wrong. Amen. So, you're just
[55:49] living in ignorance that they lived in
[55:50] before the law. Amen. On living by a law
[55:52] of conscience, doing what's right
[55:54] according to the conscience. Amen. But,
[55:56] but once the law came and said that is
[55:58] wrong, then it magnifies the nature
[56:01] fallen nature of man. And sin now
[56:04] abounds.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; And then the more laws you have, the
[56:08] more abounding sin is. So sin, law came
[56:12] so that sin might abound. Why would God
[56:15] give them a law? So that their sin would
[56:17] abound. Why would he put them in a
[56:19] hopeless situation that they and their
[56:20] fallen nature can never overcome?
[56:23] Because he wants them to realize in your
[56:25] fallen nature you can never overcome.
[56:27] Right?
[56:29] &gt;&gt; That way he can bring you into grace by
[56:31] the sacrifice of Jesus Christ so that
[56:34] you're ready to jump into grace and
[56:36] forsake the law and forget trying to be
[56:38] perfect and just accept the perfect one.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Thank God
[56:43] says, "But where sin abounded,
[56:46] grace did much more abound.
[56:49] Even for Israel,
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Even though they were under law and they
[56:54] were constantly getting it wrong, grace
[56:56] still abounded.
[56:58] Because where where where the offense
[57:01] the law entered the defense might
[57:02] abound. Where sin abounded, grace did
[57:04] much more abound. That was always the
[57:07] point. The point was always to magnify
[57:11] grace.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:14] That as sin hath reigned into death,
[57:16] even so might grace reign through
[57:17] righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus
[57:20] Christ our Lord.
[57:26] Listen.
[57:28] The children of God messed up.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Is that a news flash?
[57:33] &gt;&gt; I can say it like this. The children of
[57:34] God mess up.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Is that a news flash?
[57:41] But grace is abounding, friends, because
[57:44] of his love.
[57:48] Abraham
[57:49] got the commandment of the Lord and then
[57:51] he listened to his wife and took Ishmael
[57:53] and created a big mess.
[57:57] But God still bestowed grace upon
[58:00] Abraham and never removed his covenant
[58:02] from him.
[58:05] Noah messed up.
[58:07] David I mean David really messed up. I
[58:11] mean if there's degrees of messing up
[58:13] like in our mind there is. I don't know
[58:14] how God views that but in our mind
[58:16] there's degrees of messing up. David
[58:18] really really messed up
[58:21] &gt;&gt; but he never fell out of God's grace.
[58:24] You know something else that shocks me?
[58:27] Saul, the first king of Israel, he blew
[58:30] it.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; He was a failure almost from day one. He
[58:35] was lousy. He was horrible. He was no
[58:37] good. He was selfish, self-centered,
[58:39] self-focused, and disobedient.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[58:43] &gt;&gt; And a coward.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't fight Goliath.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Is that all true?
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:50] But when he went to the witch of Endor,
[58:52] which he was a big hypocrite because he
[58:54] tried to put all the witches out because
[58:55] under Samuel's rule, he tried to look
[58:57] religious. Now he snuck around and found
[58:58] a witch. So he was playing the part of a
[59:00] gigantic hypocrite.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; So in his hypocrisy, he's going through
[59:05] the witch. And in hypocrisy and failure,
[59:08] Amen, the blessings of the Lord removed
[59:10] from him, the kingdom stripped from his
[59:12] hand. Is a disobedient, failed servant
[59:14] of God. He comes and they and the the
[59:17] and the and and this witch of Endorf
[59:18] brings up Samuel the prophet and Samuel
[59:21] says, "This day you'll be with me."
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon pulls that out of
[59:26] the scripture and says, "See, amen. As
[59:28] bad as Saul was, he was still a child of
[59:30] God. He was still saved and he was going
[59:32] to go to wherever Saul was because where
[59:34] Saul was was where Abraham was
[59:37] &gt;&gt; or not not Saul
[59:39] &gt;&gt; where
[59:40] &gt;&gt; who's Sam? Samuel. Thank you guys. group
[59:43] participation will pass the test.
[59:46] Wherever Samuel was is where Abraham
[59:48] was. Amen. That wasn't the realm of the
[59:50] fallen. That wasn't the realm of the
[59:52] lost. And he says, "You'll be here with
[59:54] me wherever I am." And brother Brandham
[59:56] told us, amen, that he was a child of
[59:58] God. Amen. In all his dirty deeds and
[1:00:01] all his rottness, amen, he could never
[1:00:02] lose his sunship with God because he was
[1:00:05] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:00:06] world.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; And if that can be true for Saul, what
[1:00:10] in the world?
[1:00:13] Praise God.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Listen, I I just tell you this. I don't
[1:00:18] want to live Saul's life.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not looking for a Saul life. I'm
[1:00:22] not looking to mess up like David did.
[1:00:24] But what what I'm looking at is on the
[1:00:26] days when I don't get it right and I
[1:00:27] don't miss the mark. If Saul can be
[1:00:29] there in paradise, Amen. then if God can
[1:00:31] cover that by his grace. How did he
[1:00:34] cover that by his grace? Because he was
[1:00:36] looking forward to Calvary because the
[1:00:37] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[1:00:39] the world. And he knew there would be an
[1:00:41] atonement. There would be a price paid
[1:00:42] for man's sin.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; That's why Saul didn't have to pay.
[1:00:46] That's why Saul didn't have to pay it.
[1:00:48] The debt was going to be paid and he
[1:00:50] could get credit for it.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; And if that could work for Saul, what
[1:00:55] about me?
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; I'm trying. I I'm I'm I want to do
[1:01:00] right. I've got a heart to do right. I'm
[1:01:02] trying to serve God with all my heart.
[1:01:03] Amen. And this old unwilly flesh of mind
[1:01:06] sometimes gets me in trouble. And I do
[1:01:08] things I'm ashamed of. And I do things I
[1:01:09] regret. And I do things when you get
[1:01:11] caught in a flash of a moment. Somebody
[1:01:13] asks a question and and all of a sudden
[1:01:15] you you blurt out something and later
[1:01:16] you realize that was complete
[1:01:18] fabrication.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then what do you do? You lose your
[1:01:23] sunship. You back up on grace. You throw
[1:01:26] in the towel. You don't go up to church
[1:01:27] the next service because there's no way
[1:01:29] I can be one of them. How can I stand
[1:01:31] there and sing one of them?
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; One.
[1:01:39] We got to go back to the fundamentals.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Say, listen, I'm not even worthy to come
[1:01:45] to church and raise my hands and sing
[1:01:46] praises to God. I'm not worthy to claim
[1:01:50] to be his bride. I'm not worthy to claim
[1:01:52] to know God's mind that's been revealed
[1:01:54] to us at the end. I'm not worthy to
[1:01:55] claim any of those things. But by the
[1:01:57] grace of God, I am what I am.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Because of what God has determined, what
[1:02:02] God has called me to, what God has
[1:02:04] revealed to me, and where he's placed
[1:02:06] me.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to skip down here to
[1:02:11] Revelations
[1:02:13] 6 and N.
[1:02:15] This is the fifth seal. Says, "When he
[1:02:18] had opened the fifth seal, I saw under
[1:02:20] the altar the souls of them that were
[1:02:21] slain for the word of God, for the
[1:02:23] testimony which they held. And they
[1:02:26] cried with a loud voice, saying, "How
[1:02:27] long, O Lord, holy and true? Dust thou
[1:02:30] not judge and avenge our blood on them
[1:02:32] that dwell on the earth?" And white
[1:02:35] robes were given unto every one of them.
[1:02:36] And it was said unto them that they
[1:02:38] should rest yet for a little season,
[1:02:40] unto their fellow servants also, and
[1:02:42] their brethren that should be killed as
[1:02:44] they were, should be fulfilled. So,
[1:02:46] brother B, when he comes in the seals,
[1:02:47] he comes to the fifth seal, and he reads
[1:02:49] this portion of scripture. And the
[1:02:51] question always was, who are these souls
[1:02:52] under the altar? And some thought they
[1:02:54] were the martyrs down through the church
[1:02:55] ages. And brother Benham himself thought
[1:02:57] they were the martyrs down through the
[1:02:58] church ages. But then God begins to
[1:03:00] reveal it to him. And it says they were
[1:03:02] slain for the word of God and for the
[1:03:04] testimony which they held. Not the
[1:03:06] testimony of Jesus Christ. These weren't
[1:03:08] Christians. These are Jews.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said these are Jews
[1:03:12] that that that died from the time of
[1:03:14] Christ all the way to the catching away
[1:03:16] of the church.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; So for 2,000 years, that's where these
[1:03:20] Jews are under the altar. And and it
[1:03:24] says here, they cried with a loud voice,
[1:03:26] "How long, oh Lord, holy and true, does
[1:03:27] thou not judge and avenge our blood?" He
[1:03:30] says, "See, these are not Christians
[1:03:31] with the spirit of Christ." Because the
[1:03:33] spirit of Christ says, "Father, forgive
[1:03:34] them." They don't know what they're
[1:03:35] doing. They don't call for vengeance.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham clearly lays out
[1:03:40] that these are Jews and these are the
[1:03:42] Jews that are under the sacrifice altar
[1:03:45] from the time of Christ till the
[1:03:47] catching away of the church.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; We're on the same page.
[1:03:51] What altar are they under? Sacrifice
[1:03:54] altar. What sacrifice? The sacrifice of
[1:03:57] Jesus Christ.
[1:03:59] Why are they parked under that altar?
[1:04:03] Because that's where they find grace.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; That's the only place they can be
[1:04:09] sitting because they rejected their
[1:04:11] Messiah. They have not accepted Jesus
[1:04:13] Christ. They turned their back on their
[1:04:15] Messiah. So where does God park them
[1:04:17] when they when they leave this earth? He
[1:04:19] parks them right under the blood
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; that they haven't yet accepted.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is grace. This is grace.
[1:04:30] That means God can put you under blood
[1:04:33] before you accept blood.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; That's what he did through the whole Old
[1:04:37] Testament. He put them under the blood
[1:04:38] before they accepted the blood. Because
[1:04:40] the blood of Jesus Christ hadn't been
[1:04:42] shed yet on the earth. It was only shed
[1:04:44] in the mind of God. And God was
[1:04:45] foreshadowing that. Amen. What he was
[1:04:47] doing. Amen. Everybody was getting
[1:04:49] tucked away under grace, under grace,
[1:04:51] under grace, waiting, Amen, for the
[1:04:53] purchase of grace to purchase back the
[1:04:54] redemption price.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; So now all of these Jews who do not
[1:04:58] confess Jesus, do not believe in Jesus.
[1:05:00] We'll tell you there's no such thing as
[1:05:02] Jesus Christ. He was a false prophet.
[1:05:03] Will deny him and blaspheme?
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Do the Jews blaspheme?
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; They do. Where is he parking them? Under
[1:05:13] the blood.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:17] Oh, the grace of God, friends.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could ever just catch the
[1:05:22] grace of God and how perfect and pure
[1:05:23] and true it is, it should bring us into
[1:05:26] rest. Amen. It's rest that allows us to
[1:05:28] overcome our flesh. It's not tension.
[1:05:30] It's not spiritual tension and pressure
[1:05:32] where we have to act right, do right all
[1:05:34] the time. You get under that pressure,
[1:05:36] you're going to blow up somewhere. But
[1:05:37] what's the whole Christian experience is
[1:05:39] based on rest. When you rest, you
[1:05:42] perform. When you rest, you allow God to
[1:05:44] flow through you. Not when we're all
[1:05:46] tense.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; This message of grace should bring us
[1:05:50] rest.
[1:05:52] Not spiritual laziness, not wickedness,
[1:05:55] not chasing sin, but a real spiritual
[1:05:57] rest that I'm secure in Christ.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; So, brother man begins to tell us now
[1:06:04] where they are under the sacrifice
[1:06:06] altar. He says, "And white robes were
[1:06:08] given unto every one of them." White
[1:06:11] robes is righteousness. Brother Bam
[1:06:13] says, "And they are declared righteous."
[1:06:16] Oh my goodness.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; For what?
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; It's by grace. Amen. They were given
[1:06:26] white robes. They didn't earn white
[1:06:28] robes. They didn't deserve white robes.
[1:06:30] They were given white robes. And the
[1:06:32] shame of their nakedness was clothed,
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; covered in the righteousness of Jesus
[1:06:38] Christ.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was now time for the
[1:06:41] redemption. And brother Brenham said
[1:06:43] this takes place at the rapture of the
[1:06:45] church when they see that other realm
[1:06:47] depart. Amen. To go get their glorified
[1:06:49] bodies. Now they say, "But what about
[1:06:51] us?" Amen. So now it's the time of
[1:06:53] redemption to the Jews because the two
[1:06:55] witnesses are going to preach to the
[1:06:57] 144,000 and they are going to receive
[1:06:59] the atonement. They're going to receive
[1:07:01] Christ. They're going to receive the
[1:07:02] word. And when they on earth receive the
[1:07:04] word, Amen. It's accounted for the
[1:07:06] entire nation of Israel. So at this time
[1:07:09] he's giving them white rose because this
[1:07:11] is the catching away of the church and
[1:07:13] the ministry of the two witnesses coming
[1:07:14] on the earth
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; and it happens by grace.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; This is what else brother Bam says. He
[1:07:22] says now watch they had in their
[1:07:24] blindness martyed their messiah and now
[1:07:27] they were reaping for it. They realized
[1:07:29] that they recognized after it was gone.
[1:07:30] They seen when then when they came after
[1:07:34] the altar of God but now the grace of
[1:07:36] God is to them. Now watch. Now they
[1:07:38] could not by no means be saints because
[1:07:40] they would already be robed. But here
[1:07:43] they are now just souls under the altar
[1:07:45] for the word of God and the testimony
[1:07:47] they held for being God's people and
[1:07:49] Jews. But now watch the grace of God
[1:07:52] comes to them and Jesus gives them each
[1:07:55] one a white robe. Watch. Plum over after
[1:07:57] the church is gone because they were
[1:07:59] loyal to their cause and they were
[1:08:01] blinded and they didn't know it. They
[1:08:03] didn't know it. They were playing
[1:08:05] exactly the part that God had ordained
[1:08:07] for them to play. And here John looks
[1:08:09] over and sees souls under the altar. Now
[1:08:12] watch. He sees these souls. Watch what
[1:08:14] he calls them. They cry, "Lord, how
[1:08:16] long?" "Just a little while longer."
[1:08:19] See, let's get that as we go down right
[1:08:20] through the scripture. They realized
[1:08:22] they'd murdered their Messiah. And they
[1:08:24] didn't know it, but they they realized
[1:08:27] they got murdered back to pay for it,
[1:08:29] for doing the wrong. And now look what a
[1:08:31] thing they had to do. See, they was
[1:08:33] guilty of murder. So they got murdered.
[1:08:35] See, they cried out, "His blood be on
[1:08:37] us." See, that's right. And they were
[1:08:39] blinded. Now, if they hadn't been
[1:08:41] blinded, God said, "Let them alone.
[1:08:44] They're not worthy." But being that they
[1:08:46] was blinded by God, his grace reached
[1:08:48] down to them. Amen. Talk about amazing
[1:08:52] grace. And give each one of them a robe
[1:08:55] because all Israel will be saved.
[1:08:57] Everyone that has his name written.
[1:09:00] He says this, "And God said he gave each
[1:09:02] one of them a robe undeserving as they
[1:09:04] was, but his grace to blind them so that
[1:09:07] we could see."
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Why did he blind them
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; for us?
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; don't begrudge them their robe.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz they were blinded so we could see.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Says, "Now see these are given robes,
[1:09:27] each one of them. And now I want you to
[1:09:29] notice. But now God's grace stoops to
[1:09:32] them. Jesus gives them each a white robe
[1:09:34] like Joseph did his grace to his
[1:09:36] brethren. He types it with Joseph with
[1:09:38] the how no matter how wicked they were
[1:09:40] to him and how evil and how wrong they
[1:09:43] did him. Amen. When it comes to the end,
[1:09:45] he bestows grace upon them and he cares
[1:09:47] for them and he bestows gifts upon them
[1:09:49] and he feeds them and clothe them. Amen.
[1:09:51] And he says, "You meant it for evil, but
[1:09:52] God meant it for good." This is God's
[1:09:55] grace.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's all by grace.
[1:09:59] Again, in the fifth seal, he says, "Now
[1:10:01] our settle it for those souls under the
[1:10:03] altar of the breaking of the seal that
[1:10:05] had been slain in the time between the
[1:10:07] death of Christ and the going up of the
[1:10:09] church." I just wanted to put that in
[1:10:10] there so we could see the time frame.
[1:10:12] So, it's all those Jews down through
[1:10:14] there. God had reserved for them
[1:10:15] something because he blinded them for
[1:10:17] our sake. And because he blinded them
[1:10:19] and they could not receive it, amen, he
[1:10:21] was going to put them under grace. So he
[1:10:23] kept parking them under the sacrifice
[1:10:25] altar until they could receive Christ as
[1:10:27] a nation.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Beautiful friends.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; The plan of God is so perfect. His grace
[1:10:33] for us, his grace for them. Look at the
[1:10:36] strength of grace.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; 2,000 years of denying a Messiah. 2,000
[1:10:42] years of claiming Christians are wrong.
[1:10:44] 2,000 years of calling him a false
[1:10:46] prophet and they still get white robes.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; That's the power, the strength of grace.
[1:10:52] It's stronger than wrong conduct. It's
[1:10:54] stronger than misunderstanding. It's
[1:10:56] stronger than being mistaken. It's
[1:10:58] stronger than a failure. Grace is
[1:11:00] stronger than anything you can do.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; I want to be a recipient of grace.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; It's the only thing that'll work for me.
[1:11:12] I have nothing else to offer. I need his
[1:11:14] grace.
[1:11:16] Amen. I'm going to go back to this quote
[1:11:18] that I skipped and read it together as
[1:11:20] we close.
[1:11:21] Now if someone or other the individual
[1:11:24] lost their inheritance that was given to
[1:11:26] them by God, there came a year called
[1:11:28] the Jubilee year. And every seven years
[1:11:31] they had a rest, a Sabbath. And every
[1:11:33] seven days they had a Sabbath. Every
[1:11:35] seven years they had a Sabbath. And
[1:11:37] seven Sabbaths was 49 years. And the
[1:11:39] 50th year was a jubilee.
[1:11:41] And in this Jubilee, every man that had
[1:11:43] lost his inheritance by some means, if
[1:11:46] he was a free-born and true-blooded
[1:11:47] Israelite, no matter who held the
[1:11:49] possession, it had to go back to him
[1:11:51] free. He didn't have to pay a thing. He
[1:11:54] didn't have to do a thing, but just stop
[1:11:56] what he was doing and go back to his
[1:11:58] inheritance. Oh my. He had a right to
[1:12:01] it. It was a God-given right because he
[1:12:03] by grace had inherited it and it had
[1:12:06] been given to his fathers and handed
[1:12:09] down year after year. No matter what had
[1:12:12] taken place, if he lost it, it must it
[1:12:14] must go free. It meant grace is way
[1:12:17] provided for each individual to return
[1:12:19] to their rightful inheritance.
[1:12:22] What a picture it gives us tonight of
[1:12:23] the church in this last days. You see
[1:12:26] what man can do and when you see what
[1:12:28] God does, what man does is failing and
[1:12:32] will fail, has failed, and always will
[1:12:35] fail. Hardy amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. But what God does is eternal and
[1:12:40] must forever remain. Nothing can ever
[1:12:42] take it away. God give it. It's his free
[1:12:45] gift. And by sovereign foresight saw it
[1:12:47] and placed it. And there's nothing can
[1:12:49] ever move it. It's there eternally. And
[1:12:53] at Jubilee was God's manner of
[1:12:55] expressing grace to his people for the
[1:12:57] restoring are being brought back to
[1:12:59] their rightful position. So God all the
[1:13:03] way back in the Old Testament under the
[1:13:05] law, he set up the law of return and
[1:13:08] jubilee. And the law of return, return
[1:13:11] and jubilee is a picture of grace.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; God set a picture of grace in the law
[1:13:19] for all of them to learn.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; They were in the midst of the law, but
[1:13:25] they were under grace.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Under the law of return and jubilee.
[1:13:30] Because the law of return was every
[1:13:32] seven years if a man had sold himself a
[1:13:34] bonds slave because he had debts he
[1:13:36] could not pay and he needed money he
[1:13:38] could sell himself in as a bond slave to
[1:13:40] pay off his debts. But at the end of
[1:13:42] seven years when the trumpet would blow
[1:13:45] he could go free.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Why could he go free? He could go free
[1:13:50] because God says when the trumpet blows
[1:13:52] you can go free.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That's the only reason. He didn't have
[1:13:55] to pay any money. He didn't have to get
[1:13:57] a ransom. He didn't have to speak for
[1:13:59] him. He didn't need a letter from the
[1:14:00] high priest. Amen. The law was written
[1:14:02] because this is grace. If you mess up
[1:14:05] and you don't manage your affairs or you
[1:14:06] fall into trouble or you do something
[1:14:08] foolish and you have to sell yourself as
[1:14:10] a bonds slave, there's a period of grace
[1:14:13] coming. When you hear the trumpet,
[1:14:14] that's grace to you. You can go back.
[1:14:17] Amen. Not because you straightened up
[1:14:19] your act or you became nice or you
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; just because
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; then at the end of seven Sabbaths 49
[1:14:28] years at the end of that there's a 50th
[1:14:30] year. The 50th year is the Jubilee year.
[1:14:32] The Jubilee year, Amen, returns all the
[1:14:35] land of your inheritance. So if you got
[1:14:37] in financial trouble and you sold your
[1:14:39] land off, Amen. that land can only be
[1:14:42] removed from you for a certain period of
[1:14:44] time. But when the Jubilee call came,
[1:14:46] when the trumpet sounded, you could go
[1:14:49] back and take your land back.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; And you didn't have to pay a dime for
[1:14:54] it. You didn't have to do work for it.
[1:14:56] You didn't have to do anything. All you
[1:14:58] had to do is walk back into it because
[1:14:59] it was yours.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; What is this? This is grace that's
[1:15:03] embedded in the law.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that land was given to them
[1:15:08] without effort, without merit, without
[1:15:10] money, without price. God says, "This is
[1:15:12] my land and I give it to you as an
[1:15:15] inheritance."
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; So each of their fathers when they were
[1:15:18] given a portion of land, how much did
[1:15:20] they pay for that portion of land when
[1:15:22] it was divided out by Joshua and he and
[1:15:24] he gave each one a certain portion? What
[1:15:26] did they pay for it?
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; How did they earn it? Nothing. God gave
[1:15:31] it to him freely. That land was grace.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Then they would do something themselves,
[1:15:37] their own act that would remove them
[1:15:39] from God's grace. But in God's grace, he
[1:15:41] had a fail safe. You're never going to
[1:15:43] be permanently removed from my grace.
[1:15:45] You can never be permanently removed
[1:15:48] from the grace of God.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; And he laid the picture in the Old
[1:15:52] Testament so we could learn something.
[1:15:54] There is no way, no matter what you do
[1:15:56] or how vile you are or many mistakes you
[1:15:58] make, you can get separated from your
[1:16:00] inheritance. You can be sold into
[1:16:02] slavery of addiction, sold into slavery
[1:16:04] of finance, sold into all kinds of
[1:16:06] slavery that you do yourself. But praise
[1:16:08] God, if you ever hear that Jubilee
[1:16:11] trumpet, that's grace to bring you back
[1:16:13] to your right position, back to your
[1:16:16] original, which was your original grace.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Why were they freeborn Israelites? What
[1:16:22] made them free men in their own land?
[1:16:24] They didn't pay for it. They didn't earn
[1:16:26] it. They didn't redeem themselves. God
[1:16:28] redeemed them out of the hand of
[1:16:30] Pharaoh. He purchased them with all the
[1:16:32] plagues.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; He paid the price. He redeemed them and
[1:16:38] brought them out. So they were freeborn
[1:16:41] by grace.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; You can't they can't ever say, "I'm
[1:16:46] fighting for my rights to be free. I'm a
[1:16:49] free man because my father's f No. Your
[1:16:52] fathers didn't fight for it."
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Remember the plagues? God fought for it.
[1:16:57] He stoned. He sent plagues. He turned
[1:17:00] the water to blood. He He He destroyed
[1:17:02] the firstborn. You didn't do a thing.
[1:17:04] You're freeborn by grace.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Then you have the land by grace.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; It's all by grace. So no matter how much
[1:17:12] you mess up, God is going to make sure
[1:17:15] you're never his children are never
[1:17:17] permanently separated from his grace.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God. What have we heard? What is
[1:17:24] the message? The message is the Jubilee
[1:17:26] trumpet, friends. It's the call of your
[1:17:29] return to grace. You can go back to all
[1:17:31] that you were originally intended to be.
[1:17:33] what you were in the mind of God, the
[1:17:35] picture he took of you before the
[1:17:37] foundation of the world, the purpose he
[1:17:39] had for you on this earth in 2025. If
[1:17:42] you can hear that trumpet, you don't
[1:17:43] have to pay money. You don't have to
[1:17:45] earn it. You don't have to be a good
[1:17:46] person. You don't have to do anything.
[1:17:48] All you got to do is drop whatever
[1:17:50] you're doing and walk back into your
[1:17:52] position as a son or daughter of God.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Don't let nobody fool you. You don't
[1:17:57] have to start getting things right
[1:17:58] first. You just walk back into it and
[1:18:00] God will get it all right.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the Jubilee call. Amen. And
[1:18:05] if you listen, we all get into all kinds
[1:18:08] of circumstances. We all get into all
[1:18:10] kinds of twisted ideas and things in our
[1:18:12] mind. And you may not uh you may you may
[1:18:16] be a believer. You may be in the
[1:18:18] message. You may be here today, but you
[1:18:21] got yourself sold in those. A bond slave
[1:18:23] to something,
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:25] to your work, to your finances, to
[1:18:28] entertainment,
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; to elicit things, to you may be a
[1:18:33] bondslave to some greed, some pride,
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; but listen, you don't have to stay in
[1:18:39] that condition.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; And you may have got there by your own
[1:18:43] doing.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; I mean, you if you got there, you
[1:18:47] certainly did by your own doing.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:51] But there's already something embedded
[1:18:53] in the word of God.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; There's already grace to bring us back
[1:18:57] to our position of grace.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; What do I need to do, brother Chad? Wait
[1:19:02] seven years. No, sir. We're at the end
[1:19:04] of seven years.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; We're at the end of 49 years. This is
[1:19:08] the 50th year. You don't have to wait
[1:19:11] for anything. Don't wait to get your act
[1:19:13] together. Come back into your
[1:19:14] inheritance.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't wait till you can clean
[1:19:17] yourself up and fix yourself and get
[1:19:19] over your addictions and stop tobacco
[1:19:21] and and stop entertainment and stop all
[1:19:23] of that. You don't have the power to
[1:19:25] stop it. Get back in your land and let
[1:19:27] him wash you by the washing of the water
[1:19:29] of the word. Connect back to the grace
[1:19:31] of God that called you without merit,
[1:19:33] without price, without earning anything,
[1:19:35] just because he loved you the same way
[1:19:37] he loved Saul on the road to Damascus.
[1:19:40] The same way he loved Peter washing his
[1:19:42] net, he loves you the same way and he
[1:19:45] calls you the same way. And you get the
[1:19:47] same kind of grace they all got.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; You may have done it to yourself. You
[1:19:52] may be tangled up in your mind right now
[1:19:54] because you've allowed images and you've
[1:19:55] allowed thoughts and you've allowed
[1:19:57] circumstances to bring bitterness to
[1:19:59] bring confusion to bring
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay a bondslave.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Because you're a son and a daughter of
[1:20:08] God.
[1:20:10] I encourage you tonight, hear the
[1:20:11] trumpet.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; What does it sound like, Brother Tad? It
[1:20:15] sounds exactly like it sounded for the
[1:20:16] last hour. That's the trumpet. Come back
[1:20:19] to your position. Come back to grace.
[1:20:21] Come back to the thought God had of you
[1:20:23] before the foundation of the world. Go
[1:20:25] free, my brothers and sisters. Don't
[1:20:27] stay in slavery. Don't stay out of the
[1:20:30] land.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; What is the land? The land is the word
[1:20:33] of God. It's been restored to us. Every
[1:20:35] promise in the book is mine. Amen.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Those potatoes are mine. That corner is
[1:20:40] mine. That house is mine.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; It may have had denominational squatters
[1:20:45] on it for nearly 2,000 years, but the
[1:20:47] reality, every promise in that book is
[1:20:49] mine. Every truth is mine. Everything he
[1:20:51] said he would do for any believer is
[1:20:53] mine. If he said he'd heal, it's mine.
[1:20:55] If he said he'd deliver, it's mine. If
[1:20:57] he said I can go free, it's mine.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Without a purchase price. The purchase
[1:21:03] price was made 2,000 years ago. It's
[1:21:05] mine because he set up the law of
[1:21:08] Jubilee in return.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; And I'm returning under this Jubilee to
[1:21:12] my position as a son and daughter of
[1:21:14] God.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay where you are.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Don't let invisible chains bind you.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Don't let mental circumstances keep you
[1:21:26] from moving all the way in. Shed those
[1:21:28] chains. You don't have to stay there
[1:21:30] after the trumpet call. If you stay
[1:21:32] there, you stay there voluntarily. You
[1:21:34] don't have to stay in that condition.
[1:21:36] Come back to God. Come back to your
[1:21:38] position. Claim your rights as a son of
[1:21:40] God and see what God does for you.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Because there's a law in the land
[1:21:45] because the supreme deity, the judge of
[1:21:47] heaven and earth has come down. Has
[1:21:50] anybody seen the white wicked one in our
[1:21:51] day in 1963 when you turn the picture to
[1:21:54] the right? What was it? It was the
[1:21:56] judge, the supreme deity, the authority
[1:21:58] of all heavens and earth. And what is he
[1:22:00] here to do? He's here to enforce your
[1:22:02] inheritance rights.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; He's here to make sure you go free, you
[1:22:07] get healed, you get delivered, and
[1:22:09] whatever the devil's used to bind you
[1:22:10] up, that those chains are broken because
[1:22:13] the enforcer is here.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:16] But if you stay back and don't believe
[1:22:19] that that trumpet calls for you
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; and not really sure if you're in the
[1:22:24] original herand and I'm not really sure
[1:22:25] if my name's in the book and I can't
[1:22:27] exactly say because I don't have all
[1:22:29] these qualities
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; then you never get the benefit
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; of return in Jubilee. Amen.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; The only way you get the benefit is if
[1:22:42] you believe you're part of the original
[1:22:44] inheritance
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; and your name is on the marriage
[1:22:48] certificate, the lamb's book of life. If
[1:22:51] you can't believe that, you stay in
[1:22:54] slavery.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's true.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Said, God, by your grace, grant us faith
[1:22:59] to believe.
[1:23:01] Grant us the faith to simply believe
[1:23:03] what you said about us and stop
[1:23:05] believing what every other voice in my
[1:23:08] head is telling me.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Help me come back to the word.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's just stand.
[1:23:14] Let's just end there tonight. How many
[1:23:16] want to go back?
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, you're going to get stuck
[1:23:20] in your mind somewhere again. Don't
[1:23:22] think this is the last time you hear the
[1:23:23] Jubilee Call. That's why we keep coming
[1:23:25] back to church.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody does us wrong. We get
[1:23:29] stuck in bondage again in our head. We
[1:23:30] just got resentment towards him. We
[1:23:32] can't seem to get over the bitterness.
[1:23:34] Amen. Don't stay there. Come back to
[1:23:36] church and hear the Jubilee call once
[1:23:38] again.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; We get our feelings hurt. We get we get
[1:23:41] knocked down by life. We get trampled on
[1:23:43] by the world. We have people do us
[1:23:45] legitimately wrong. And all of a sudden,
[1:23:47] all these thoughts start coming in and
[1:23:48] we find ourselves emotionally bound up
[1:23:51] again. And listen, this isn't the last
[1:23:54] time you'll go free, but this isn't the
[1:23:55] last time you'll hear the Jubilee call
[1:23:57] because the message is being preached
[1:23:59] day after day after day. And it is the
[1:24:01] call to freedom.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Recognize what the devil's trying to do
[1:24:05] to bind you, to keep you from your
[1:24:07] position and your inheritance. And
[1:24:09] resist that devil. Flee. If you resist
[1:24:11] him, he'll flee and you come back to
[1:24:13] your position.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Claim it. Speak it. If God's stirred in
[1:24:17] your heart, don't be afraid to say, "I'm
[1:24:19] a son of God."
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you're afraid to say it,
[1:24:22] how will you get the benefit of it? The
[1:24:24] devil will keep plaguing you in your
[1:24:25] mind. There's got to be something rise
[1:24:27] up inside and said, "By the grace of
[1:24:29] God, I am what I am." Unworthy creature
[1:24:32] that I am. Un undeserving of I am of
[1:24:35] salvation, but by the grace of God, I am
[1:24:37] what I am.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God. Let that truth
[1:24:43] trump all other truths.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; That by the grace of God, I am what I
[1:24:49] am.
[1:24:50] You say, "Well, but you're not much of a
[1:24:53] message believer." Yeah, I I I may not
[1:24:55] be much of one, but I am one.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; I never claimed to be a good son of God.
[1:25:03] I I I never claimed to be the best. I
[1:25:05] never claimed to get it right. I never
[1:25:07] even claimed that the the I never
[1:25:09] claimed anything except I am one.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; How can you say it so boldly? I say it
[1:25:15] by faith. I don't look at my merit
[1:25:17] because I can't say that looking at
[1:25:19] myself.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; I can only say that by the faith he's
[1:25:22] bestowed upon me. The quickening in my
[1:25:24] heart. The reality when I hear the word
[1:25:27] preach, it clicks, clicks, clicks,
[1:25:28] clicks.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; And I know it's who I am.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; And it's not the man that looks me in
[1:25:34] the mirror because that guy is my
[1:25:35] biggest enemy. That's the one that keeps
[1:25:37] getting me sold into slavery.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:40] But it's what's down in here that
[1:25:42] connects with the reality of this grace.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; That's what's predestinated. Anyways,
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; brother Bram said, "It's not the person
[1:25:51] that comes predestinated."
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; This is where we stumble, friends.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; It's not the person that comes
[1:25:57] predestinated. It's the seed.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Or the word that thought of God he had
[1:26:02] before the foundation and chose to place
[1:26:04] in your soul and put that soul in your
[1:26:06] flesh. Mhm.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; So don't stumble around. We stumble
[1:26:11] because we keep stumbling with the
[1:26:12] person.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Person's failed. Person's messed up.
[1:26:15] Person has wrong thoughts. Person keeps
[1:26:17] falling into temptation. Person keeps
[1:26:18] falling into the same traps. Well, hey,
[1:26:21] good news. It's not the person that
[1:26:23] comes predestinated.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; It's the seed.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And it's the seed that believes.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; It's the seed that has life. It's the
[1:26:32] seed that's eternal life. It's the seed.
[1:26:34] Listen, what's going to change your
[1:26:36] atoms? What's going to change you to a
[1:26:38] glorified body? When the word that
[1:26:40] you've held in your heart begins to
[1:26:43] materialize a new body around the word
[1:26:45] that's here.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; I thank God for his truth. I thank God
[1:26:51] for the strength of his grace.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; It's stronger than my flesh
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; and it has to be or there's no hope.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus,
[1:27:03] we're so thankful, God.
[1:27:06] So absolutely thrilled with this truth,
[1:27:10] Lord. God, we were all everyone hopeless
[1:27:14] cases
[1:27:16] until you got a hold of us, till you
[1:27:18] quickened your life within us by your
[1:27:20] spirit. We were everyone destined for
[1:27:24] trouble. We were everyone left to our
[1:27:27] own devices. We were everyone sinking.
[1:27:31] But God, it's your grace that has
[1:27:33] sounded the Jubilee trumpet to call us
[1:27:35] back to what you want us to be. God,
[1:27:39] this robe of righteousness we're
[1:27:41] wearing, it's not ours. We didn't stitch
[1:27:43] it together. We didn't sew it. We didn't
[1:27:45] harvest the material for the fabric. But
[1:27:47] we are clothed in your righteousness.
[1:27:50] What you are and what you've done and
[1:27:52] what you've determined and what you've
[1:27:54] paid for, and you've put it on us by
[1:27:56] imputation.
[1:27:58] And God, we stand here clothed, pure,
[1:28:02] clean, the sinless, spotless, virtuous
[1:28:05] bride of yours. Not by our merit, but by
[1:28:08] yours. Not by our idea, by yours. Not by
[1:28:10] our plan, but by yours.
[1:28:13] You've placed something, a deposit
[1:28:15] within us that can believe.
[1:28:19] And God, we believe.
[1:28:21] Lord Jesus, I pray that you'd help your
[1:28:23] children to break free.
[1:28:25] May this trumpet call be a call to
[1:28:27] return. May they hear the return trumpet
[1:28:30] tonight, Lord. And may they throw down
[1:28:33] wrong thoughts and worry and anxiety and
[1:28:36] whatever's twisting them up and binding
[1:28:38] them as sons and daughters. May they
[1:28:39] throw it down and return back to their
[1:28:42] position as free sons and daughters of
[1:28:44] God. May this voice of mine, Lord, that
[1:28:47] the word coming forth, may it be a
[1:28:49] trumpet call of Jubilee. May they run
[1:28:51] back and embrace their full inheritance
[1:28:53] and every promise that you've given. And
[1:28:55] may you bring healing and deliverance
[1:28:57] and restoration.
[1:28:59] I pray in Jesus name. If there's
[1:29:01] addictions, I pray you would break them,
[1:29:03] Lord. God, if there's misunderstandings,
[1:29:06] I pray you would correct them, Lord.
[1:29:08] God, if there's hurts that are too much
[1:29:10] to overcome, I pray you'd heal them,
[1:29:11] Lord, for you've promised it. And this
[1:29:15] is the Jubilee call. This is the hour
[1:29:17] for restoration.
[1:29:19] God, help us, Lord, to stay free, to go
[1:29:21] free, remain free. For you've given us
[1:29:25] that privilege in your message of grace.
[1:29:28] God, we thank you that your grace is
[1:29:30] stronger than our weakness. Your grace
[1:29:33] is stronger than our mind. Your grace is
[1:29:35] stronger than our feelings. Your grace
[1:29:37] is stronger than our decisions. It's
[1:29:40] your grace that's stronger than all. And
[1:29:43] so, Lord, we thank you for your grace
[1:29:46] this evening. We love you. You loved us
[1:29:50] so that we could love you and we want to
[1:29:52] love you more. We want to be uh we want
[1:29:55] to walk in greater understanding of that
[1:29:57] grace, greater revelation of that grace.
[1:30:00] May it bring peace and confidence to us
[1:30:02] to walk with you. We love you, God. We
[1:30:05] ask for your blessing over all said and
[1:30:08] done. May your children go forth free.
[1:30:11] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:30:16] Amen. And God bless you, brother Black.
