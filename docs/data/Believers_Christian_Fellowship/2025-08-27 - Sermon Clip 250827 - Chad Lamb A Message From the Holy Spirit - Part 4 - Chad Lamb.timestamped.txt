[0:00] But what went you out for to see a
[0:02] prophet? Yay, I say unto you, and more
[0:04] than a prophet, for this is he of whom
[0:06] it is written, Behold, I send my
[0:08] messenger before thy face, which shall
[0:11] prepare the way before me, Malachi
[0:16] 3.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; So, who does Jesus say that John the
[0:20] Baptist is? Jesus says he's Malachi 3.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist says he's Isaiah 4,
[0:26] Isaiah 40. Amen. Uh, Matthew says he's
[0:29] Isaiah 40. Luke says he's Isaiah 40.
[0:32] Mark says he's Malachi 3 and Isaiah 40.
[0:35] But you'll never find any scripture,
[0:37] amen, that tells you that John the
[0:39] Baptist is a restorer of anything. He's
[0:42] a preparer. Because if he came at the
[0:44] end of the Jewish dispensation to
[0:46] restore, he would take him back to the
[0:48] law of Moses. But he wasn't there to
[0:49] restore. He was there to prepare because
[0:51] there's coming a new and living way.
[0:53] Grace was being open. The New Testament
[0:56] was coming. Christ was coming as a
[0:58] sacrifice for all sin. He wasn't
[1:00] restoring. He was preparing.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; There was a new entrance, a new gate
[1:04] opening, something, a new way coming.
[1:08] &gt;&gt; Don't you love review?
[1:12] &gt;&gt; It becomes more real all the time.
[1:14] Friends, this word never fails. And what
[1:16] God sent us was a word prophet. And that
[1:18] word prophet stays exactly with the
[1:20] word. And he knows the word. He's got a
[1:22] seventh grade education. He told you one
[1:24] time, I hope you understand what I'm
[1:26] saying. I don't have language enough to
[1:28] explain it.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; He didn't have the credentials. He
[1:32] didn't have the language, but what he
[1:34] had was the mind of God. And what he had
[1:36] was a gift. Amen. To pick up on the true
[1:38] interpretation of the word. And he would
[1:40] stay exactly with that word.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 1, this is when the angel
[1:48] comes to Zachchariah
[1:50] before John the Baptist is born. And the
[1:53] angel comes to Zachchariah
[1:55] and says, "And he shall go before him in
[1:57] the spirit and power of Elias," that's
[2:00] Elijah,
[2:01] "to turn the hearts of the fathers to
[2:04] the children."
[2:06] &gt;&gt; See the comma?
[2:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09] &gt;&gt; That's as far as he went in the Malachi
[2:11] 4 prophecy.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; Pause.
[2:19] for 2,000
[2:21] &gt;&gt; years.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; He did prepare. He did turn the hearts
[2:27] of the fathers to the children, the
[2:29] Jewish fathers to the children of the
[2:31] New Testament, but he went no farther in
[2:34] the prophecy. And the angel who spoke to
[2:37] to to uh Zachcharias, John's father, he
[2:41] was exactly with the word and he stopped
[2:43] at the right place to stop.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn the hearts of the fathers to
[2:47] the children and the disobedient to the
[2:49] wisdom of the just to make ready a
[2:51] people.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; Prepared for the Lord.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; Even this angel knew what John the
[2:59] Baptist portion was. It was preparation
[3:02] prepared for the Lord, not restoration.
[3:06] He was preparing. He was only there to
[3:08] fulfill the first half. And because he
[3:10] only fulfilled the first half when they
[3:11] said, "Are you Elijah?" He said, "No."
[3:12] "Are you that prophet?" "No." "Who are
[3:15] you?" I'm the voice of one crying in the
[3:16] wilderness. Prepare ye the way of the
[3:18] Lord. He knew his part of the prophecy.
[3:21] The angel knew his part of the prophecy.
[3:23] Amen. And he stayed true to that part of
[3:25] the prophecy. But after the comma,
[3:27] there's another part yet to be
[3:29] fulfilled. And I say it's been
[3:31] fulfilled. It's been fulfilled in this
[3:32] generation. There come a man with the
[3:34] spirit of Elijah named William Brandham.
[3:36] And he fulfilled the rest of that
[3:38] prophecy.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; And God vindicated and confirmed it. And
[3:42] it's without question that those who
[3:44] have eyes to see and ears to hear
[3:46] &gt;&gt; and a heart to perceive.
