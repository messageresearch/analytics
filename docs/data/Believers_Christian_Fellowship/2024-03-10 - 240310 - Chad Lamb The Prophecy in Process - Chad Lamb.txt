God has provided so many gifts and we're so if I could say it this way we're so completely spoiled we thank God and I really appreciate these brothers because I know I know each one of them and I know their heart and I know first and foremost they love the Lord with all their hearts and they honor and respect his word above all else and they love this assembly they love you all and that does my

Brothers thank you so much I'm so thankful we've got brothers that can work together like this and they have such a tremendous respect for one another they have a respect for the pastor that God's

dedication services for the new church building over in Holmes County with the ex Amish Believers over there brother Levi Yoda and all of them and uh they're having services this weekend Saturday and Sunday one on Saturday two on Sunday and they've invited Brother Kyle to come minister so Brother Kyle will be going Saturday ministering Saturday evening it's at 6: pm and so if you need the address you can text me or I hope Kyle has it maybe Kyle's the address too and uh he can let you know more about that I know several of you are going and I know they'll appreciate that it'll be a blessing for for them they built that building and they want to see it full and I know they'll be blessed with that and we'll be praying for kyy ministers there as well also wanted to let you know uh I didn't have a chance to uh mention it but uh not this past Thursday wait Sunday but the previous Thursday I went over to Holmes County to do the Bible study the church age book Bible study for the uh Brethren over there and during that uh Bible study um brother Ben Yoder brother Levi Yoda's brother was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so I know the Lord had been dealing with him for a long time on that and different ones had talked to him about it and he called me on Tuesday before and let me know that uh he wanted to be baptized he said if if that's all right with you and I said oh my goodness that's all right with me I've been praying for this for months you know and um and uh when I got there on Thursday we did the baptism before the Bible study when I got out there to the baptism after he was baptized his wife was right behind him and they got baptized together so the Lord's really blessed them over there and we want to continue to hold them up in prayer and thank God for all that he's doing it's exciting I'm telling you it's exciting to see people have a love for the word and God's still seeking out a sheep and pulling them to himself it's such a thrill just to witness it and so I thank God for that all right let's Stand Together so there'll be a lot happening over the next two weeks different Brothers ministering in different places a lot happening here and a lot of good things happening and I thank God for that I love to I love to be uh I love to be part of what God's doing and I'm so thankful he lets us share in what he's doing he could certainly do it without us he could use somebody else but I'm so thankful he lets us have a part you know and witness what he's doing cuz it's a thrill for us uh before we go into the scripture reading also want to give you an update on brother Tim erant um I've been uh checking with him and talking to Janet and visiting him he's still in the hospital at St Reid as he had a a mild stroke and he's still suffering the effects of that stroke um and so just keep praying for him that God will give him a full recovery and even bring him back to more strength than he had before the stroke and that God will really bless him and bless Sister Janet I know it's a lot of pressure for her and the family and I know it's a difficult time but he's he's uh he's doing well he's improving every day he's improving but he still is having trouble communicating he's having trouble really expressing himself he he knows where he's at he knows what he's doing like he's he's fully aware but sometimes he has hard time getting the words out and so there we really want to see God restore him completely once they know he's completely medically stable they want to move him over to delphus to Van Crest Nursing Facility for Rehab so I know he would appreciate visits I know they would appreciate any word of encouragement that you can give at this time and I know they certainly are coveting your prayers so let's just remember our brother as he's recovering he's recovering but we want God to we really want God to give him a full strength full recovery and even more than he had before also last night I got a call uh late into the night um while I was still here studying that um uh Young Brother Derek seil was Ill he wasn't feeling well last evening uh right as he went to bed and he was he was sick it looked like maybe he had a stomach bug or something was was coming on and and uh as he as he went to get sick again he called for his mom and when she went in from all that they can tell it appears like he had a some sort of seizure he had an episode where he just got really stiff and he was unresponsive for maybe a minute and then when he came to he didn't have any movement he couldn't move his fingers in his left hand he had some numbness in his feet so they took him to the hospital last night and we went over there and prayed with him in the hospital but by the time I got there to the hospital he was already feeling much better so he still has some of the symptoms from the stomach bug or flu or whatever but he's feeling much better he's thinking more clearly they had the they did a CT scan and they did blood work and everything came back good the CT scan was good the blood work was good there was one level that was elevated indicating that he did have a seizure so they want him to do a follow-up visit with children's hospital but we just want we just want to pray that the follow-up visit is a confirmation there's nothing wrong and that God has healed him so it appears that the devil's tried to take advantage of a weakness through illness or something that was going on in his body but we're going to resist the devil and if you resist the devil he shall flee so whatever he was trying to do whatever inroads he was trying to make and whatever he was using we're going to stand together and resist that and believe that that God will give him a full restoration of full health and that his check up will be a confirmation that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God just before we read the Bible let's bow our heads together and pray dear heavenly father we thank you God for all that we see you doing Lord we hear the testimonies we look around we witness Lord all that you have done all that you are doing and our hearts beat with anticipation for what you will do for you are amazing Lord your your ways are beyond our thinking Lord we don't always understand the paths that we walk or what's happening but we look back over life and we see that you were perfect in everything and in every way and your name is magnified again and again and again Lord we thank you God we ask that you would bless Lord this congregation this assembly Lord and myself as we have to separate for a time you've called me to go and minister in other places I pray you'd use this vessel For Your Glory help me God lord I pray that you would anoint the brothers that'll be ministering here and I thank you for these brothers I appreciate them Lord and we're so blessed that you placed them here amongst us I pray you'd use them mightily and bless the congregation Lord in my absence and I pray you bring us back together with many testimonies Lord as the brothers are traveling to minister in different places pray you be with them and may they bring back good reports Lord God we ask that you would touch those Among Us who still have need Lord I pray you would touch our brother Tim aant Lord that you would restore him Lord that you would take away all the effects of the stroke and that youd bring him back to a greater strength than he had before for he's trusting in you and we're believing Lord that you're the same yesterday today and forever God may you comfort the family strengthen them and especially Sister Janet as they go through this difficult time may they feel your presence about them may they know Lord that you're very near that you're a present help in the time of trouble and may this Lord what the devil meant for evil may it be intended for good and may it manifest that good Lord for young Derek seabo Lord God I so thankful that you brought him through this trial and we believe that you've delivered him and that you've healed him and I pray Lord that you'd make it manifest God whatever symptoms are remaining of whatever illness or sickness was underlying I pray that you take them all away that you heal his body completely and when they go for the followup visit Lord may may another testimony come forth Lord that you're a Healer and you're a deliver and whatever the devil attempted to do he was he was thed once again by the blood of Jesus Christ by the stripes that you bore for our healing Lord we just we purchased for us healing and we just believe in it we hold on to it and I pray that you'd bless there Lord bless us now as we look into your word I pray God that your inspiration would fall upon this vessel and that you would speak Lord that it wouldn't be the ability of a man because that is a failure to begin with but Lord May may you come and speak may you come and break the bread of life may you come and give us eyes Saab that we might see and a heart that we might perceive all that you're doing for us help us Lord to walk the path that you've laid for us and help us to do so with faith God we love you we ask your blessing in Jesus Christ's name amen just want to say God bless you all those that are visiting and especially to brother Benjamin LA and his wife they're here visiting for from Arizona visiting his brother Aaron God bless you it's good to have you here in the service they've got to go back I believe on Tuesday right Wednesday so it's just a short visit but it was good to see them once again let's look at Isaiah chapter 7 and verse 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name name Emanuel man God bless you as you take your seats I don't know if you'll remember but excuse me a couple weeks ago I come to the pull pit and told you that I had had a strange night before that I had a message prepared and I had worked it all out and and then all of a sudden everything changed about 8:30 or whatever well the message I was working on was the one I hop that I can Preach Today I'm planning on it anyway but who knows what will happen amen we've learned to take nothing for granted but as a as a subject I'd like to look at the prophecy and process the prophecy in process I've got a PowerPoint that I'll go to and uh in just a minute because there's several quotes that I want to read together and I put them on the overhead so we can go quickly because I want us to look at it together and I don't want to get bogged down in it but I want to look at this this um if I could say the prophecy and process I want to look at it as a as a subject or as a uh a maybe a principle that's that's what I want to say and then see if we can glean something out of that for ourselves for today so when we look at Isaiah chapter 7 there's a prophecy that's given Isaiah is now the mouthpiece of God and he's laying down a prophecy that a virgin shall conceive and he says uh uh the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel now let's go to Luke chap 1 take together Luke chapter 1 Luke 1 and verse 26 let's begin in verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God brought into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the Virgin the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at the saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born in thee shall be called The Son of God so here we see the time of fulfillment of the prophecy has come more than 700 years before Isaiah had declared a virgin shall conceive and now now it comes time for the prophecy to move from just a prophecy into manifested word the word was going to come into a manifestation and the word always comes to manifestation in flesh and so Mary was going to be the flesh that this word was going to manifest in and so now we see that the angel Gabriel comes to her and tells her that that she's highly favored that it's the time of the prophecy and she's going to conceive in her wound and she says how will this be because I don't know a man and and he says it's going to be the Holy Ghost now he's coming and he's showing her it's going to be a virgin conception amen it's going to be an Immaculate Conception you it's not going to involve a man because you're the Virgin because this is the prophecy because this is the time so now when it comes time everything's confirmed and she conceives in her wound by the Holy Ghost no man involved she there's a virgin conception it says a virgin shall conceive so now she's carrying around amen the prophecy in manifestation in her amen we know that she runs to Elizabeth and she gives a salutation to Elizabeth and and while she's speaking to Elizabeth amen Elizabeth also has a word of Prophecy in her and that is the Forerunner John the Baptist of Malachi 3 amen that was prophesied to come is now inside of her amen but she's got the word inside of her Mary's got the word inside of her but the word inside of Elizabeth is laying there in a dormant state it doesn't it's not kicking it's not moving and you know brother Brandon saying that she was getting nervous it was now six months and she hadn't felt any life amen any sign of life and so now Mary comes because Mary is living in the prophecy she's the Living Word she's the manifested word what word is she a virgin shall conceive she's the Virgin and the concept ceptions inside of her she is the manifested word for that hour and she comes to another woman that's ordained to be the manifested word for that hour that has a seed of life that has amen a word inside of her laying dormant but when she testifies and speaks the name that was given to her of Jesus Christ all of the sudden that word inside of her leapt and started kicking and started moving amen why because the manifested word goes from one to the other to the other to the other and now the both they're both living out prophecy Elizabeth is living out prophecy cuz a forerunner has to come and she's carrying the Forerunner John the Baptist is born and and then you know things happen and and brother R tells us history shows that that he had older parents and they deceased and he went to the Wilderness and he didn't have any formal training and he Stomps out and he starts baptizing and and at the same time Jesus is born and he lives in an obscure Corner uh uh uh in Israel there and he's not really noticed or known and there's things happening all over the place but when you look at the prophecy prophecy said a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son and his name shall be Emmanuel which is god with us so when you look at it Mary when the angel comes to Mary he opens the prophecy to her and it begins and she conceives and then the question is is that the Fulfillment of the prophecy it's an interesting question because the answer is yes and the answer is also no because the prophecy is a virgin shall conceive yes and bear a son but Jesus hadn't been born yet so for that 10 month period where were we were we in the prophecy is the prophecy fulfilled is the prophecy not fulfilled I can you say the prophecy is fulfilled can you say this is can you say this is Isaiah 7:14 or not oh I hope you're you're start letting it sink in can you say this is Isaiah 7 74 yeah you absolutely you can say this is the Fulfillment of Isaiah 14 but yet there's more in the prophecy to be fulfilled that doesn't mean she's not in the prophecy that doesn't mean the prophe is not fulfilled but there's more to develop there's more to be fulfilled as time goes on and for that period of time amen the the the prophecy was just blooming amen it was growing and and it was now coming into fulfillment and every part of the prophecy would come into full fulfillment but never could you say that's not the prophecy this isn't right that's not what Isaiah said cuz the minute you deny that she was in the prophecy and the prophecy was fulfilled in her you were wrong to deny it would be wrong because it was absolutely right but but then also to say this is it and there's nothing more to come this is the end of it that would be wrong because there has to be a son that's born and he has to be Emanuel which is God With Us and he's going to manifest that God was with us so even in part of the prophecy was not just the birth of Jesus but also the manifestation that God was with us and that took place during his ministry amen even even he didn't even enter the ministry publicly until he was 30 years old and he come to the baptism at Jordan and then he began to go about doing signs and wonders and miracles and manifesting that he was Emanuel that this really is God With Us the fullness of the godhead bodily was in him it was God working in him reconciling the world to so so so when you look at this prophecy it's interesting to me the Bible just keeps getting more and more interesting to me because we we we as human beings we we do things mentally sometimes that we're not even aware of and and we we we try to figure things out in in some ways we I'd say it this way we want to compartmentalize everything yes because we don't like open-ended things we don't like things that are not resolved that's just naturally we don't like things that are not resolved we don't like it when it's not buttoned up when it's uncertain when when we don't really know we don't like the unknown that's why people tend to not like the dark because it's unknown and they they I mean it there's the the the fear of the dark is not doesn't make any sense let's just say it that way there's no reason to be afraid just because there's no light because nothing's change there's nothing dangerous there's no reason to be afraid but it's the fact that you don't know whether there's something dangerous is there are not that causes the fear it's the unknown it's not really the darkness it's the unknown it's the uncertainty and so us as human beings we're always trying to we're we and some of us are worse than others and I happen to be one of the worst ones but we're trying to button everything up and tighten everything down and have an explanation for everything because that brings security to us right all right but you know there's some things that we just don't know and there's some things that we we we can't always speak for certainty and God does things beyond our human intellect and he and God is not doing things to make us intellectually comfortable or secure but he's actually fulfilling his word the way he always intended to fulfill it and he hasn't have to do it in a way that makes us comfortable but he has to do it according to his promise amen and so and so now you know when when Mary is living out the prophecy she's absolutely the word of God made manifest without any shadow of a doubt and she's standing there the word for her day yes and she can say the angel come this is Isaiah 7:14 and she's exactly right but then the critic can come along and that little critic can say no no no wait a minute now the prophecy says now a son has to be born let's wait and see what that baby is let's see if this is the word or not yeah yes then when the baby's born and it happens to be a male well but it also says it would be God With Us and there's other prophecies and there's other things that were said let's just wait and see you see you see both sides I mean you could be so wrong with that idea of wanting to be so sure and wait and delay and delay and listen there's always something that you could look for even back in with the Pharisees when Jesus come he he was known to have come out of Nazareth he was known to be a Galilean he was known by that and then when he come they begin to say read the scriptures does any Prophet come out of Nazareth does any Prophet come out of [Music] Galilee no but but you know that out of Bethlehem will come the ruler amen but what you didn't know is he was actually born in Bethlehem while he was still young he ran away to Egypt and from Egypt he was afraid to go to back to Bethlehem so they went up to Nazareth you don't know the whole story so you're denying it based on what you think the word says but you don't actually have all the pieces he was spot on with the word and in every way with the word but because it didn't measure up somehow to to one of your measuring sticks and the Pharisees felt justified in rejecting him because no Prophet comes out on Naz nothing good comes out of neth there's no Galilean Prophet well did you know he was born Bor in Bethlehem right oh did you know he fled to Egypt oh did you know there was a prophecy that was hidden in the life of Jacob when it says out of out of out of Egypt will I call my son Jacob oh you're rejecting an entire prophecy because of a detail that you don't even really have all the facts about yes praise be to God you know sometimes you start ministering something I have no clue where I'm going I have no idea what I'm doing because it's just something God's moving in and and I don't really know I don't when it comes to something like this friends I I uh like I said last Sunday I feel like I'm tiptoeing on the razor's Edge and and and dancing through landmines because I mean you could be so wrong in any one of these steps that you take that you could absolutely destroy something but the truth is always right down the middle yeah you can go extreme either way but but there has to be a reality that we face and that reality has to match the reality that they've always faced in every generation in every age so Mary is is is living in a reality she's living right smack dab in the middle of fulfilled prophecy she's living smack dab in the middle of the word she is the word the word is alive she is part of the prophecy and it is true and it is happening right before their very eyes but then they say but but what about this and what about that and what about his name will be Emanuel and what about these other prophecies all she can say I don't know about that I don't know how that will happen but I know this is absolutely right this is Isaiah 7:14 what about the rest I don't know about the rest and you know what she could stand there and go before the council and go undergo interrogation and she could not explain everything to them that they would want to have explained to make it neat and tidy so that they could put their stamp of approval on it all she could say is what she knew to be true and what she knew to be true was absolutely thus sayeth the Lord correct let's look at acts 13 acts 13 and 46 then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing that you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation unto the ends of the into the ends of the Earth that is a prophecy out of Isaiah 49 that's the Fulfillment of Isaiah 49:6 Isaiah 49:6 says and he said it is a is it a light thing that thou should us be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation until the end of the Earth that's Isaiah 49:6 now now he says verse 47 in Chapter 13 of Acts for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth it's interesting isn't it we believe that was the ministry of the Apostle Paul that God fulfilled that prophecy through him and that through him he was to be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth unto the yeah ends of the Earth and but the question could arise but Paul didn't go everywhere on the Earth right Paul didn't cover every country he didn't cover every language he didn't cover all the territory he he only went to parts of it and so so did Paul fulfill that was that true when Paul says this is what the Lord told me were the Fulfillment of Isaiah 49:6 or was Paul wrong because Paul didn't go to the full ends of the Earth and I say Paul was absolutely every bit right because God through Paul brought the word that word has went into our Bibles and this Bible has covered the entire Earth amen what was it it was the ministry of Paul amen God would send him to prison so he couldn't continue to travel to the ends of the Earth anymore and he would start writing letters because this is how God was going to get Paul's Ministry to the ends of the Earth and the question is when did that prophet prophecy in like when did it start and when did it end I would say it's continuing on I say we're still living in this prophecy amen where the light that God was going to use Paul to be a light to the Gentiles and a light for salvation to the end of the world that light is still shining that light is still moving out we're still in that prophecy sir so it's true it was going on in Paul's day it was happening everywhere he went he was Isaiah 496 being man made manifest every place that he trod every Journey he took in his boat rides and in his travels on land what was it it was the Fulfillment of Isaiah 496 it was happening before their eyes amen but they could reject it because well now he's in prison now he's not traveling anymore well now he's dead I guess he was wrong no he was absolutely right what was wrong was the gray matter between your ears thinking that you knew the the conclusion to the prophecy thinking that you knew how God would do it that's the problem amen the problem wasn't that Paul was wrong Paul was absolutely wrong what was wrong was that old human nature yes sir you can see now as time goes on you can see how the only way that God the only way that this plan of God is going to work is by faith because it's never going to be done intellectually there's always too many questions there's all many things that are fulfilled unexpectedly or in a way that is not easily explained so it's got to be by faith man I want to look at a couple of slides I'm going to bounce back and forth between notes and slides as we move forward but I I I I hope you're catching my thought the prophecy and process almost every Prophecy in the Bible had a process to its fulfillment some of those processes are still continuing on today like the light to the Gentiles for salvation that's still continuing on gone the the the process of of uh Isaiah 7:14 it was a process that process you say how long did it take well it took at least 10 months from the time the angel came until you know a virgin conceived till a son is born and then he's called Emanuel but he's called Emanuel because he's God with us so why was he called Emanuel was just a title at Birth or or was it actually the manifestation of God being with us that made him Emanuel I I'm not trying to answer the question I'm just telling you it may not be like what we think so that prophecy had a period of time it was being fulfilled but while it was being fulfilled it was still true it was still happening it was still the Fulfillment of the prophecy it was still the word made flesh it was still the word for that day it had come yes amen when let's just say it this way if I could just rephrase it let's say you're a Pharisee and you hear the story going around that a virgin has conceived she claims she met an angel and she claimed that this is the Fulfillment of Isaiah 7 and it looks like it could be and and you say I won't believe it until I see the son until I know it's Emanuel I refuse to accept it until I know that everything that was mentioned is fulfilled the problem is you would be be be rejecting the word for your day and if you would say that prophecy is not fulfilled because of this part and that part and you reject it as being true because of that then you're rejecting the truth yes you're re now now now don't don't get me wrong it's not saying yes but there's more and I'm watching for the more there's nothing wrong with that but to reject it as true would be wrong because the truth was she was the Virgin and she had conceived and she was carrying the Messiah that was the truth yeah to to reject that because you didn't understand the other pieces would be rejecting the word amen to say to say to say in that day nope this is not Isaiah 7:14 because of EX you would be completely wrong that'd be completely contrary to the word but to say yes that's true but there's more I can't wait to see the rest that would be right yes yeah you see how we're walking where are we walking I don't know where we're walking but where we're walking it's a tight spot it's a tight spot it's always been a tight spot so let's look at this scripture that we all know really well Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets we know that this prophecy has been fulfilled in our day and I just want to pull out this quote from 1961 where brother B said what's the matter with me anyhow I'm only telling you the truth someday you'll catch it someday you'll know what I've told you that I've told you the truth my voice may be silent you might be able to silence the body that's speaking but you'll never never silence that voice it comes from God they stoned Steven but they couldn't stop the message it'll move on them tapes will be played after I'm gone for years we believe that so in the days of the voice of the seventh angel I would say the voice continues on but also says when he begins the sound the mystery of God shall be finished that's absolutely true because he preached the opening of the seals amen and and he preached the M the Great of God the great seven seal that's absolutely true amen it was finished it come to the End of the Age it come to the time of the Fulfillment amen but for me I wasn't even born then so for me to come to this prophecy amen there had to be a voice that would continue on Amen and for me there was a time that that voice began to sound and in my life there was a beginning of the sounding of that voice and in my life there was a finishing of the mystery of God for me because that prophecy is still in process for me and I believe the pro the prophecy is still in process for some of you because there's many of you that been baptized in the last year or two that's come to know the truth that the seals have been open and you've heard that voice although amen the man who spoke is laid silent in the grave for many years but you can't stop that voice it'll go on hallah cuz we're still in the Fulfillment of Prophecy right there's a Time marker yes when he begins to sound absolutely he had to preach it all he had to preach the seals he had to lay it all out that's why there's not another messenger there's not a return of the messenger everything's been laid out there amen but it's been laying out there in a form that we've been missing it not necessarily catching it or not everybody catching it amen because it's got the time that is going to continually unfold this prophecy is still in process that's right amen Amen to say it didn't start would be wrong yes praise God to say it's all over might be wrong too it wasn't over for me thank God it wasn't over for you thank God prophecy was still in process Isaiah 496 is still moving on a light to the Gentiles for salvation in the world Revelation 10:7 is still moving on so thankful friends so thankful let's look at this one in the Feast of trumpets brother REM says this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ The Seven Seals had the mystery hid of what it was all what it all was and it's supposed to open it in the last day at the leoan age at the end of time thanks be to God that finishes the message to the church that finishes it I believe it that finished the message to the church I'm just so glad it wasn't finished in 1964 cuz I was born in 1977 so that finished when when listen when did it happen at the end end of time yeah you know the end time is a process the end of time itself is a process the end of time is not the meat cleaver dropping now there will be at some point the meat cleaver dropping but you realize that won't even be till the end of the Millennium because the Millennium is still in time so the end time or the end of time is a process and that message that was delivered through that man finished the message to the church it was finished yes I believe that oh but I'm so glad that the prophecy wasn't done being fulfilled or coming into fulfillment it can't be done till every one of the elect come to that last message when at the end of time so where are we at the end of time but brother Chad we've been saying that for 60 years absolutely it's been the End of Time amen it's been the end of the den child dispensation it's been the end of the church ages it's been the end it has been the end time and the end of time all that time is the end time let me just say it this way I don't know how to say it when you get to the end of the sentence you put a period right but you know even a period takes up space even a period has distance from one it may not be much but even a period takes up space so maybe even the period on the end of the Gentile dispensation maybe the period takes up a little bit of space but when you look back over 10,000 years of human history maybe it's just a little tiny space even if it's 60 70 80 90 years it's the period period now don't forget period even has a start and an end to the period yes amen we want it that's it period flat no more discussion and don't confuse me with any more questions yeah that's human nature amen but praise be to God when when was the seals open at the end of time and that finished the message to the church oh but I'm so glad I got to hear that message and I heard it many years after he made this statement I'm so glad that prophecy is still in process and I can be included in it in the breach he says now you see I'm just not making that up it's thus sayith the Lord I'll read it to you out of the book The sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who has wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh Church age the last Church age all the Loose Ends that through these Church ages have been probed at will be wound up together and when the seals are broke and the Mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting his foot upon land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel is on Earth at the time of this coming I'm so glad he put that in there as an emphatic statement amen because there's other things that he says about end time events and there's other things that are written in the scripture and there's other statements brother brandham make that if he wasn't so emphatic in making this statement you could be justified in looking at that and still waiting for something to come that's already come but brother Brandon was so clear that says when when now listen and when the seals are broke yes have the seals been broke the seals were broke in 1965 but you know to me they were still all sealed up but it's been you know several years ago now that those seals I'll say it this way those seals began to break open for me I don't want to be so pomp isite arrogant and say the seals are broke for me because I'm learning something every single day every time I read the message I'm like whoa I didn't know that I never caught that before so I would say the seals began to break open for me some time ago and they're still breaking open I'm in the process of the opening of the seals yes amen so now when the seals were broke and they were broke in 1963 the seals are broke and the Mystery is revealed it was revealed down comes the angel the messenger who's that Christ setting his foot upon land and upon sea with a rainbow over his head now that remember this seventh angels on Earth at the time of this coming and the seventh angel is clearly William brandham the seven Church age messenger the seven messenger and while he was on Earth this event took place I'm going to make a statement and I may be I just just bear with me for just a few minutes I say that event took place I should say that event began taking place and is still taking place we so want to file stuff in one cubby hole or another but the word of God has a way of busting out of all our cubby holes and filling everything running here and running there and running all over the place we try to confine it and contain it into a nice package so that it becomes understandable for us and then when we see other things that don't seem to make sense when then somehow we just don't want to look at that but God has a way of breaking out of our boundaries amen and that word can't be confined by our intellect so we know that this messenger Christ had to come at the time the seventh angel was on Earth had to we have a Tim stamp of when that began but what we don't have is the Tim stamp of when that goes right when it ends that's right when it stops being pertinent and relevant in this dispensation I want to read something here out of the token he says neither could these things come at other times this could not have come in the days of Luther it could not have come in the days of Wesley the days of the Baptist or the methodists in their days it it couldn't have come it has to come now Israel has to be a nation the church churches has to be like they are now there had to be a third message the Third Church age there had to be a leoa it could not it could not form until Pentecost come and shot their Wad and went out and organized and did what they did then it has to come then comes the Lord when they put him out of the church he is the word so when Pentecost comes which is the last Revival the previous Revival when the Pentecostal Revival comes which is in the leodan church age when they come and they organize and they reject the word then he comes then comes the Lord he is the word so how does he come say brother Chad I didn't see any pictures of a giant Jesus while brother B was on Earth with one foot on land and one foot on sea so does it mean it wasn't fulfilled because you don't have a picture no it was spiritually fulfilled it was a spiritual happening that took place he is the word and he came in fullness there's a prophecy that brother bham goes to over and over and over again in Luke 17:30 and he begins to show that even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed he starts pointing to a Time when the son of man will be revealed and we know Jesus Christ is the son of man and his prophetic Ministry and he says as it was in the days of lot and Sodom and he starts to give us the time frame as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot and brother B picks this up and uses it as an analogy to depict the day in which you're living and showing that the son of man would be revealed but in Matthew 24 when it describes the same thing it shows it as the coming of the son of man so brother bam ties the two together the coming of the son of man and the revealing of the son of man are linked and he and he makes this statement in the message proving his word says as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed that's where he connects the two together which is Matthew 24 and Luke 17 he says as it was in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed so have we seen the revealing of the son of man that's also the coming of the son of man which can be said the coming of the Lord and that statement frightens many people because the coming of the Lord has many aspects and many prophecies attached to that many things there's the the the coming of the Lord also includes the battle of Armageddon an absolute destruction it also includes himself revealing himself to the 144,000 there's many things included at the coming of the Lord and if I look at all those details like I look at Isaiah 7 74 a virgin shall conceive I can say well he hasn't revealed himself to 144,000 they haven't seen and mourned as one that gives uh uh Mourns for a only son that prophecy is not fulfilled and this part's not fulfilled and this part is not fulfilled so there it's not true it's still true just as true it was in the Virgin Mary that she was the Fulfillment of the word and that prophecy was in fulfillment the same thing's true now concerning the coming of the Lord amen so is there more to be fulfilled is there more Prophet absolutely absolutely so now he says so shall it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church seed not no more the bride is called in the day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head to unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman oh I don't know do you see what I mean see it's a son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church in him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not the marriage so now brother says now the son of man is going to come right down in the human flesh what human flesh was he talking about he was talking about his and make the so word so real amen how did Christ make the so words so real and proved that he was the same yesterday today forever he did the same works right in that prophet in a prophetic Ministry and what did he do he made the word so real that it actually United The Head and the body together Christ and his bride together to do what it was the uniting time in signs it was the invisible Union of the Bride it was the marriage that was coming am then you go to the scripture and says the marriage of the Bride has come praise God Amen it had to happen when Eleazar was here amen the marriage set in amen but I'm so glad that the marriage ceremony didn't end then because I was born in 1977 where was the marriage well he tells us eleazar's Ministry was to fetch a bride for Isaac and brother benam was fulfilling the role of Eleazar fetching a bride for Isaac and then down through that flesh down through that body amen the son of man was being revealed and making the word so real that she would recognize it and come to her bridegroom and there would be a a union that would take place a marriage that would begin to set in oh God it happened but if I say it happened then I can't be married it happened in 1963 it was happening through the end of the ministry you can yeah absolutely I believe all of that amen the marriage has begun the Union's taking place but I'm so glad it didn't end because if it ended there then I wouldn't be married to Christ I couldn't come to an invisible Union I couldn't be part of the body United to the head so there must be a a prophecy in process as the bride is being united with Christ The Marriage of the Lamb has come it's still going on I don't know when you United with Christ but I know when I United with Christ amen and and and I come into that visible Union and I pray and believe amen that that marriage is still going on we're still in the marriage of the Lamb we're still in the ceremony it's still taking place so there's somebody else that can get married Mar too because once you go to the wedding supper the marriage is over so we haven't yet went to the marriage supper so we're still in the marriage we know when the marriage started amen are we on the same page but the marriage won't finish till we go to the marriage supper so we're still in the marriage and there's a prophecy in process yes praise God I'm not waiting for it to come but neither am I cutting every human being on the plan out of it by saying it's already come it has already come but it hasn't yet went so if it's come and not went then where are we we're uniting with our bridegroom we are in the uniting process right now amen we're uniting with him we're becoming one with him it's happening also you know we don't want to use trivial human mindset yes that says you know I I went to the altar I gave my heart to the Lord I was filled with the Holy Ghost I United with Christ under the banner of this message and I was married in 1979 listen the invisible is still taking place you're still uniting to him you're still pledging yourself to him and you're still this is still the uniting time and signs we're still in the invisible Union you and all of you are probably like me yes I I came to the realization yes God unlocked the mystery in my heart yes I United with him but but when I look back at that uniting versus what's going on now I realize I I have been uniting with him I have been joining to him I have been coming to my bridegroom I have been coming under his head shift and it's still going on there's a prophecy in process thank god let's go back to the slide here the first video says at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me tonight to show you through here that we receive a messenger that will take all these Loose Ends there and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church so the he's supposed to reveal the whole Secret Of God what was the purpose for the rapturing of the church that was 1963 that was more than 60 years ago question is did he tie together the Loose Ends sure did he reveal the whole secret of God what' he do for the rapturing of the church did I miss something let's keep going the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home of the Bride we got something different the Pentecostals represented that again we're in the bride age praise God what what is this message for it's for the bride it's for the going home the bride it's for the Rapture of the Bride it's for the going to the marriage supper yes but you can't go to the marriage supper until you first complete the marriage and when you complete the marriage then you can go to the marriage supper and there's no way we're going to complete this marriage until the last predestinated seed comes in is Unified with Christ so we're still in the marriage but this message is for the going home of the Bride H we'll just say you all know it anyways you all are miles ahead of me but what if the going home of the Bride is a process too what if the journey home what if the Rapture is also a prophecy in process what if the bride is going home right now what if the bride is in the Rapture now and being raptured present tense brother M said how do you know the Rapture is not going on all the time right yes what a statement you ask yourself why would he say something like that like just make it so plain and so easy and then all of a sudden when when when when the light bul goes off it is so plain and easy how do you know that the Rapture is not going on all the time why are you looking for something to happen why are you looking for this pin prick and I say I want the period remember the period takes up space he says all right no I don't want to read this quit reading stop too far ahead you already read something of it I know you did ruined it I want to I want to look at something else for just a minute if we could turn to Genesis 15 I'm intentionally Friends making myself slow down because if I take any one of these and just take off preaching it'll be so much fun will enjoy it so much but I whenever you're preaching whenever you get preaching you get in under the inspiration people are pulling you keep going down a track and keep going down a track and keep going down a track but I don't want to I want to hit this track then I want to jump over and get back on this track because we're trying to talk about these two things being true at the same time the prophecy and process in Genesis CH 15: 13 and he said unto Abram know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with a great substance and thou shalt go to the fathers in peace Thou shalt be buried in a good old age and in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full so here we have a prophecy this prophecy is that the children is going to se his children will seed will soj in a Strange Land for 400 years but that God is going to bring them out God is going to deliver them and God is going to judge that Nation but also in the prophecy God's going to bring them back to that land so that's all encapsulated in the prophecy the question is how long did it take for that prophecy to be fulfilled you can say 40 years yeah 40 years but maybe more than 40 years because you know Moses comes at the appointed time at the end of 400 years and Moses is ready to enter in but he's not yet ready the people are not yet ready so Moses goes 40 years on the back side of the Wilderness to get some child training question is is that part of the prophecy too yeah I think so and then he comes back and now God brings a mighty deliverance and they come out with a great spoil they come out they spoil them they come out and they they they've prospered amen they go in the journey God judges them mightily through the plagues they cross through the Red Sea the Army's destroyed they're singing on the other Bank of the Red Sea uh mariam's going up and down with a tambourine and the women are singing and dancing because their enemy has been destroyed they have been completely delivered and the prophecy has been fulfilled mostly there's nothing wrong for singing dancing and nothing wrong for saying the word has been fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled before their eyes but part of the prophecy was that they're going to go in and return to the land that was promised to Abraham so God faithful in his word he takes them to the to the land of promise but we know at cadis Baria that they make a a mistake and they're afraid to go on and they're rejected and then they wander for 40 years and all of those that were in that generation die off and God raises up a new generation and that new generation goes in and when they go in listen when they go into the land amen now now you can say you know now we see the Fulfillment of the prophecy the whole thing has been the Fulfillment of the prophecy the entire duration the the the the the bring the the birth of Moses was part of this prophecy you know everything was working it's all the prophecy and it's all the Fulfillment of the prophecy amen and even when they get into the promised land amen part of the prophecy is that they'll inherit the land that was given to Abraham but we know as they move moved in to start to possess it they never fully possessed it so the question is is that prophecy been fully fulfilled or not fully fulfilled I'm not answering the question it's a just good question but God kept his word and God fulfilled the prophecy but all along they were in the process of the prophecy and it was correct to sing and dance and shout and sing and re re glory in God but then to say it's all over now we're a nation now let's set up camp let's let's let's build our city right here in si no you can't stop now the prophecy's in process it's got to go to the next stage to where you enter into the land and take the full promise amen now I want to read a just a couple quotes oh my there's so many things I want to get into all right in the message it is the rising of the sun says hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because I live you live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power so when we read quotes like this you can say this is the resurrection it absolutely is this is the resurrection out of denominationalism this is the catching up out of leoa and coming into the bride a this is a resurrection amen but this isn't the end of the Resurrection this Resurrection will produce the next Resurrection which is the resurrection of the sleeping Saints here's something else brother BM says in God's provided place of worship says now notice when this great moving power of God comes onto a Son of God it quickens him the spirit of Life enters into him then what does it do it seats them in Heavenly places right now not they will be we are now we've already resurrected right so it's a true statement that says the True Church of God has already resurrected am I telling the truth and it's also a true statement to say someday I expect all the Church of God to resurrect right is that also a true statement so if you make one statement and I make the other should we start an argument and a debate and separate Fellowship cuz we are in the middle of a prophecy being unfolded we are smack dab in the middle of it and it's always transition times that it get a little murky and a little unsure for many people but listen friends we're right smack dabbing this prophecy this is the resurrection SE season and the resurrection has begun we're in Rapture season and the Rapture is commencing now we are in the Fulfillment of the prophecy we're smack dab in the middle of it we should Rejoice we should sing We should declare just as just as just as much as the Virgin Mary declared that this is the word made flesh and I'm the Virgin and this is Isaiah 7 we should declare that this is the resurrection out of dead denominationalism the church has raised up again the word is alive and restored once again this is the marriage of the Lamb it has come this is the rapture it's in process this is the going home of the Bride amen this is this is the coming of the Lord this is all of it but you know what I don't want to do I don't want to set up a camp at the base of sin and say we've arrived cuz there's more in this prophecy as we're moving through it there's more being fulfilled all the time this is why oh I praise be to God this is why God is good I want to look at a couple things because I keep wanting to get ahead of myself when we look at the scripture brother brandom us when he preached the Rapture he comes to 1 Thessalonians 4:16 said for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord Brother bam uses this uh when he preaches the the the um Rapture message and he begins to break down the Rapture into three parts yes the shout the voice and the Trump and he says three things happen a voice a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears now a shout Jesus does all three of them when he's when he's descending yes so maybe descending is a process but I thought his land was on his foot already on land yeah it's true it's still going on a shout what is the shout it is the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride has the shout went forth absolutely have you heard the shout yes has it gathered you out of the denominations and churches in the world and is it gathered you to Christ absolutely you have heard the shout and the shout is part of his descending he does all three why he's descending amen and it's part of the Rapture so that means you've already entered into the Rapture by what by the shout Gathering you together Gathering you out of systems Gathering out of the world Gathering you out of yourself and bringing you to the United of C you and Christ together bringing you to what bringing you to the marriage praise God said therefore the message calls the bride together see the shout then he comes says in the Easter seal said if you are ordained on that ground if we are ordained to be on that ground like the eagle walking in the chicken's nest if you're ordained on that ground the holy spirit is here to find you and when it finds you you recognize its call you know the hour you're living you know these things are supposed to happen quickly you're raptured up to meet it and now you're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you know what this Holy Ghost found me it revealed that this message is true to me it revealed to me that I could stand with assurance and say this is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 Luke 1730 Revelation 10:7 Why by a spirit of revelation God dropped into me to open it up and I believe that I've heard that voice amen I've heard the eagle scream and that means quickly I was raptured up to meet it that means I was raptured then brother Chad if you're raptured travel like a thought why do you get tired why do you get sick are you immortal now well the truth is I am Immortal and I am mortal yes I am a prophecy in process I am part of the word being fulfilled in this day am I there all the way yet no but there's some place in God that I'm already all the way there amen amen and there's many places that I'm not yet all the way there I'm there and I'm not there at the same time I'll tell you something else I'm perfect yeah and being made perfect at the same time you know what that makes me a paradox an anomaly an odity I am perfect in Christ Jesus amen I am being made perfect by the things I suffer I'm being brought into Perfection through the ministry through the word through the things that I go through through trials and tribulation through patience working its perfect plan bringing me perfect and tire wanting nothing so I'm perfect and I'm being made perfect yes simultaneously see in reality if we jump on either side of these equations and stay there planted and make a camp yeah we're going to find ourselves in error yes because if I come over here to this perfect side I've been made perfect in Christ Jesus and there's no flaw in me and nothing wrong with me and then I begin to have confidence in My Flesh and I think every thought that I have is of the Holy Ghost and I can then begin I become my own God and I begin to do anything that comes to my mind to do and I feel just ified and doing oh my goodness how dangerous is that but if I move all the way over here where I'm just a lowly worm and I'm nothing and there's nothing good about me and nothing good and I don't know why God would ever love me and I can't do anything right and I'm nothing I'm nothing I'm nothing I'm nothing then the problem is that you will never do what God has called you to do because God is the one working in you both to do and the will of his good pleasure you have to recognize that there's something else inside that's why the Apostle Paul said he said in me he said that is in my flesh is no good thing because in him was something wonderful in him was eternal life in him was an attribute of God in him was word being made manifest in him was a prophecy out of Isaiah in him was some absolutely wonderful Eternal part of God but he said in me that is in my flesh I love the disclaimer if I camp out over here I never have the courage I never have the strength I never the faith to ever do what God's called me to do because he's called me to lay hands on this sick and they shall recover he's called me to preach the gospel he's called me Amen to stand and Shine the Light Of His glory but if I'm a worm crawling in the dust all the time in my mind I'll never rise up and do what he called me to do because it takes a certain amount of confidence that you are a son of God to take Faith in his word and take his word by faith and move forward with it because why CU I'm a Son of God and the word of God can't fail in me I can fail the word can't fail so we've got to be working with both truths amen so I'm raptured and seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but you know what I'm looking forward to to the translation of the body and being raptured because I'm looking forward to the raptured doesn't mean I'm denying my Rapture but just because I believe I've been caught up in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus doesn't mean that I'm denying my Rapture this is why brother benam said the truth is right down the middle let's look at this next one if you are represented up here on this attribute of God this God if you have it if you're repres represented here you cannot you're in the Eternal and you've crossed from the seventh day into the eighth you got into the Eternal by the baptism of the Holy Spirit you're included in this I'm not even in the seventh day anymore I'm not even in time anymore I've moved to the eight day I've moved to the Eternal I've been caught up I've been included in this I've been born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm in the Eternal I'm in the eighth day I am not even in leod deia anymore take that Leo deia keep saying that as you drive to work Monday morning to go get a paycheck so you can buy some groceries and I I don't say you shouldn't stop saying you should say that because that's the only thing that's going to get get you through is this realization but we also have to realize there's something more to come to what I feel in my soul is going to be all over me this reality that struck my soul this life that's deep inside of me it will one day become all of my thinking because I'll have my theophany body it will become every desire in my flesh because I will have a glorified flesh I one day what what is going on in my soul and what has happened on the inside of me is going to happen to All of Me and that will be the culmination let's look here how can I overcome we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandest ages of all ages this leoan church age is the grandest of all the church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity I want you to catch this phrase and really focus in on it what is the leoan church Church age it is the ending of time and the blending of Eternity you know what that means to me it's mixed up somewhere in between it's not the end of time he didn't say It's the End of Time and the start but in the Le leodan age it's the blending that's why for us in some ways we've entered into the eternity in some ways we've raptured in some ways we we have left Le oysa in some ways we've come up higher in some ways we've entered the bride AE in some ways all of these things are absolutely the truth but we're still in a blending period amen praise God oh my goodness what am I going to say next let's look here future home there's a couple statements brother brenon makes and I want to catch it if we look here in future home this is in uh August of uh 1964 we're in August early August and when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulfilled when there is no more time then you go into eternity after the seven Church ages is over and it is now we all understand English right after the seven Church ages is over and it is Luther's age is over Methodist age is over Pentecostal age is over and now you go into what eternity no more sevens no more threes no more other they're an eternity where there is no such as numbers and times and things praise God then he says and we realize that the Pentecostal Church age in the last days is the leot toan church age they're synonymous so the Pentecostal Church age is the leot toan church age now go back and he says the seventh Church age is over he says he says when there is no more more time then you go into eternity after the seven Church ages is over and it is Luther's AG is over Methodist age is over Pentecostal age is over and the Pentecostal age is the lean Church age so I read this quote and when I read this quote I go out as a as a fire brand preaching all over that leody deia is over and I I'm Justified because the prophet's not lying I've got him to back me up the L Church age is over brother man says now if I come with a message of Pentecost I would be in the leoan church age and it wouldn't be right this is July of 64 the other was August of 64 and so I'm totally justified in preaching what I want to preach about Ley of being over until I get later in August of 1964 and somebody asked a question brother Brenham you have made statements recently concerning the church age has ended leoda we just read those statements it's a good question he says no I never said it's ended if I did you misunderstood or I said it wrong this is the last Church age it's the end of the church age is the leoa it hasn't ended when it ends the church is gone so as long as the church is here it hasn't ended yes well now I'm confused unless somehow they're both true Unless somehow that Pentecostal age for the Bride of Jesus Christ has ended she has been caught up out of the denominationalism out of the whole problem that man slipped into a man's ideas and she's been restored back to a union with Christ she's been brought back to the word the original word that the fathers had so when she was brought back to the word she was lifted out of the church ages because the church ages is the record of people leaving the word the fall and the restoration but when it comes to the end you're restored now the Bride of Jesus Christ had the church ages have ended for the Bride of Jesus Christ brother bham tells us when the church Ages end then the seventh Angel's message comes and the seals open so the church ages have had to end but then he comes along and says I never said the Le Church age is over you either you misunderstood it or I said it wrong why because if we I listen I believe with all my heart for the bride Leo DEA is ended she's not blind wretched miserable naked she's received the isab she's clothed in the glory of the Lord clothed in his word she is not a Leo Dean if she was a leot she'd be wrong she's been lifted out of the denominationalism lifted out of the church age and United with Christ she is in the bride AE absolutely without a doubt but if I make that application that is true for the bride and if I blanket that statement over the whole world then I become wrong because Leo deia the leysia church age cannot end till tribulation and tribulation goes into the Millennium so if now the lean Church age is over either we're in the tribulation which is only for three and a half years or we're already in the millennium and if this is tribulation it's been pretty light and if this is the Millennium I'm somewhat disappointed so you see there's a prophecy in process time is blending with eternity the church ages is blending into the bride age which is not another church age that's why it doesn't receive an eight it's not number eight amen it's back to what the church was supposed to be at Pentecost but fell from so it's a restored back to its original condition and then moved on to the marriage that's what the bride age is it's not time it's not another number it's back into the Eternal purpose of God for a bride amen so I have the church has been resurrected I have been raptured I have been brought out of lead DEA in the bride age I've been United to Christ but does the bride age continue or does the lean Church age continue it must continue it can only end at the tribulation period which is a specific Mark of time of three and a half years and then after that a battle of Armageddon then after that a millennial reign of Christ am so you can see how these things are true it's all true but you can take the truth and be wrong so brother Chad how do we make sure we're right then I don't know maybe we just start by admitting we don't know it all maybe that's the easiest way so how how are we going to be right brother Tad this seems a little complicated to me I don't know all I know to say is maybe we don't have it all figured out and maybe we don't have all the answers and maybe we can't button it up really tightly but maybe the things that we know are true are true and we should rejoice and sing and dance and Shout about I've been lifted up out of Leo DEA I'm in the bride a I'm in The Invisible Union the Bride of the the the marriage of the Lamb has come Christ has come to his bride amen he is here United that's absolutely absolutely the truth and let's sing too about something's going to change in my life I'm I I'm going to get a body change I'm not going to live like this the rest of my life I'm going to have a body that matches my soul and I'm going to live in the Millennium with Christ let's get excited about both brother B says this in the church age book says Thou shalt call and I will answer thee thou will have a desire to the work of thy hands thy great Shepherd is calling his Sheep by name the creative voice of God is calling them forth from the dust or changing their atoms even though they had not fallen asleep it is the rapture it is the great marriage supper of the lamb and his bride part of the Rapture is changing of your atoms says it again in the leosan church age but one day we will be changed in the atoms we will put on immortality we will be swallowed up in life then we will realize realization say brother brandham you already said that by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've entered into the eighth day you're not even in the seventh day anymore you've entered into the eternals what are you talking about you're already imortal immortal absolutely but one day I'm going to be changed in the atams and that has nothing to do with my soul my soul has already changed but this flesh is going to change and I'm excited about both and God's provided place of worship he says and God has already raised us up potentially the quickening power that raised us from a life of sin and changed our being it has potentially raised us up in Christ Jesus which the resurrection will bring us forth fully matured there's going to be a finishing of this process that's right but I am not going to deny that the word has already come I am not waiting for something to happen what what is h what was what is going to happen is happening now and what is happening now will bring me to what will happen happen I'm not sitting on my heels or at the base of C sitting there waiting for something to happen no it's happening day by day how do you know the Rapture is not going on on all around you right now I'd say it is going on all around us right now so I just want to finish up with with just a thought here let's go to Hebrews 11 Hebrews 11 let's go to verse 39 in Hebrews 11:39 and all and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect they're not completed with us without us so God is finishing the prophecy the promise with us we're part of the Fulfillment of this prophecy brother brandham says let me let me just read out of things that are to be he said but the other one is called my father's house I'll go and prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house there you are take you out of this old Earthly pest house he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exist it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said so Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it is a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand to be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins amen that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word and the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride and yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated Amen brother bam tells us he says in the message he says U I think the invisible union he said you are the perfect virtuous virgin bride of Jesus Christ because why he's washed Us in his blood he's purchased us when he looks through the blood he can't see our faults when he looks through the blood we're perfect amen we are perfect in his eyes perfect in his vision perfect because of the blood but yet the word has come to make us perfect to wash us from the filth of the press through spirits to wash all the filth of the world away and cleanse us and purify us and change our hearts and change our mind and bring us into that Perfect Image he had of a bride amen we're being perfected by the word but it was the word who bled and died for us that made us perfect to begin with but yet we're in the process brother B says in the rising of the sun he said' and the sun has got to be revealed again in the bride in the last day so the sun has got to be revealed again where in the bride the quickening power has got to come Quicken them out of these dead denominations and Creeds to a Living Word of the Living God so now the the word has to purify has to perfect has to wash a bride and perfect amen why because they without us are not yet made perfect he's coming the the sun has got to be revealed again in the bride he's got to come in the bride form amen but but for him to be revealed in the bride it's going to take a whole lot of Shaving down and washing for us amen so that we can come to a yielded place where we can come to a surrender to the word where he can be revealed in us because he can't be revealed in us with things of the world hanging on he can't be revealed in us with old denominational ideas hanging on Amen there's got to be a washing away of all of these things so he can be more and more and more revealed in our lives this bride has got to come to Perfection and what's bringing her to Perfection this word that we've already received but it's the word that bled and died for us it's the word that's already declared us perfect is the word that's making us perfect it's a prophecy in process when we look at the the Rapture brother R tells us the Rapture is a process starts with a shout the message going forth calling out a bride Gathering a bride and it's the voice the voice of the Archangel say it's the same voice that called Lazarus from the dead then the Trump is the resurrection of the sleeping Saints and the translation of the body and the Gathering into the other dimension all it's I'm sorry it's the Gathering it's a summoning to the other dimension it's the translation of our bodies the voice is is what brings them out of the ground but he said they without us are not yet made perfect amen so there's a perfecting by the word that's taking place that's why we come every Sunday and Wednesday not you say I've entered into the eternals I'm perfect by the blood of the Lamb I've arrived no you haven't that's why you have trials and tribulations and that's why you keep coming back every Sunday and Wednesday and that's why God keeps opening more and more of his word to us why he's washing Us in why there was parts of us that couldn't be washed he had to get through the outer Gunk to get to the inner Gunk and there was a word that washed the outer Gunk and then there's a word that comes and washes the inner Gunk and now he's got to get to the inner of the inner Gunk but he's got to he's cleaning Us by layers and he's bringing us down why because he's got to come he's got to be displayed again in the end time in the bride and she's got to be able to manifest that word and in order to do it everything's got to be washed away she's got to be washed away of her habit she's got to be washed away of dressing wrong talking wrong but then she's got to be washed away of thinking wrong and reacting wrong and her complex has got to get washed and the hurts that are deep in her heart why because he's going to display himself in her and the washing of the water of the word is purifying and cleansing all of us in and out it's a prophecy in process brother made this statement back in 1961 and I just want to drop it in here because I I feel like it's so pertinent he said all right here was voices Oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish you see all those statements what's it going to take to get us in that position it's going to take the washing of the water of this revealed word yes sir real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is this see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on you know what I read that statement I've read that for years I've Loved this quote for many years but you get to this point he says say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be I haven't been manifesting that for years amen I've been believing it I've been saying it needs to be but but my reactions are always as sweet as can be I mean I've not gotten to the place where somebody can say anything and do anything and my response was just as sweet as could be but that's the direction I'm heading in by the grace of God that's his purpose in this day is to wash a people wash them and cleanse them and to step inside of them and to manifest himself but brother said this is what we need what this is what hurts the devil What Hurts The Devil is not yelling at him and calling him a devil doesn't hurt him What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil just like what you say if I could preach like Billy Graham or Oral Roberts or somebody a great influential speaker oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no more attention to that than nothing you you get all the theology you want to and all the Seminary training and the devil just sits back and laugh at it but when he sees that life that's the goal that's what we're striving for that's why we're still here that's why God is still working on us and transforming us why the we've we've already resurrected potentially we we've already been caught up into Heavenly places hey but but that quickening power that came to Quicken us to life is also quickening this Mortal body to match the word yes the quickening power that brought us into the eternities by the baptism of holy ghost that quickening power is working on this flesh to bring it in line with the word as well and we know that brother B told us that in the leian church age he said in the church age book he said the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God is its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in that first age how will the world hear from the bride it may not be just what comes out of your mouth but it's that life say anything you want to him do anything just to sweetest can be I say God bring me to perfection you who have declared me perfect already bring me to Perfection you have called me your spotless sinless virtuous bride when you say you're glorious and there's no fault that's his Declaration of the Bride you've already spoken that over me I already have that position by predestination yes now in this Earthly Journey bring me into that image amen so that I can reflect what you've already done on the inside can it reflect on the outside so that you can get Glory let it be the Thunder that shakes the devil brother BM says in the message desperations he says and all the things that he has that he hasn't done down through the ages in the church ages he is now doing back to the word because the messages and the messages and the messages has to wind up in the entire word and in the last days the Seven Seals being opened was to pick up every straggle that's been left off of it and make the whole thing in one great big body of the Bride that them who lived back there was not perfect until this church be perfected this brid group in the last days to bring them in and all together be taken up now we know why God brought such a message in this end time because he's going to display himself through a people and he had to bring a word that'll produce that result so what are we supposed to do lay in the presence of the son and let this word this message bake all the greenness out amen you realize when we look at the Exodus we went back to Genesis and we read the prophecy that was given to Abraham and now God comes on the scene and he brings Moses to fulfill that prophecy and bring them out with a mighty hand judge that nation that persecuted him bring them through with a great spoil and take them into the land well they find themselves like I said dancing on the banks of the Red Sea rejoicing because God had kept his word but yet there was more to come now they needed to go in and possess that land but that group that came out they needed some shaving down they needed some attitude adjustments they needed to trust the Lord so God would take them through many experiences in the 40-year journey and they would go through the bitter Waters that were turned sweet they would they would they would see the failure of ministry when Aaron pushed by the people took them back to idolatry yes they saw the failure of Moses when he exalted himself when he became angry and was withheld from the promised land they saw uh the the anger of the Lord in judgment when they when they when they complained against the Lord and he sent fiery serpents among them but then they saw the salvation of the Lord when he provided a Brazen serpent when they cried for quail he provided when they were attacked by enemies he defeated them all this journey it was all doing something it was all building something it was molding something everything they go went through there was a new generation coming up what was happening the the the the the thinking of Egypt the slave mentality the thing they've been bound in It's Beginning to leave circumstance by circumstance by circumstance yes until you find people who hit a hardship they want to go right back to Egypt because at least we had something to eat at Egypt and now you come to a new generation that comes up and they're sharpening swords and they can't wait to go into the promised land what happened there was something there was a prophecy in process but the process was doing something it was preparing a people to step into the furtherment of the prophecy we've been in a prophecy and process for 60 plus years now but what God been doing doing he's been doing all the same things he did in the Exodus Journey we've seen all of those things and those of you who've been around longer than I've been around you've seen them all you've seen the failure of ministry you've seen Ministry exalt themselves you've seen Ministry given to the wants of the people you've seen people complain you've seen people turn back you've seen the Judgment of God and you've seen the mercy of God you've seen the provision of God you've seen fear that comes when an enemy comes and you've seen God raise up some in the camp to defeat the enemy You' SE you've seen Rebellion against god-given Authority and what happens to them who's been around for a while have you seen those things what was it well we thought it was time we thought that he had come we thought it was the Rapture but now it's been 60 years no this is still the Rapture this is still the coming of the Lord he's coming in Bride form he's still coming to Greater manifestation all the time as what as we travel through all of this we're still smack dab in the middle of the prophecy friends we're not waiting we're here we say coming yeah there's more to be fulfilled but what's being fulfilled is happening right now day by day all around us he's here uniting with his bride well well it sounds good he's here uniting with me he's here washing me in the water of his word he's here uniting to me and I want to be uniting in this marriage in a greater way every day I wanted to be a better Union a stronger Union more of a uniting every day of my life I don't want to say I United back in 2,000 this that and the other and now I'm just waiting I'm not just waiting I'm still uniting I'm still being married to my bridegroom to the headship I'm still being married to this word as he unfolds himself more and more I'm uniting to that that and I'm looking forward to the marriage supper but what will take me there is here yes he is here uniting with his bride he is here taking us back home we're walking with him in the middle of a prophecy the prophecy in process we're not going to fight about either side they're both true we're not going to argue that brother B needs to come back to finish some things that are unfinished no he did everything he needs to do but there's some things that are unfinished yeah there's some things that are unfinished I agree with you but God's finishing them now where is he doing it he's doing it in his bride he's completing the ministry he's completing the work he's finishing everything that he need it's happening right now we are exactly listen friends we are exactly L where Mary was Mary was in the word made flesh in her flesh yes but there was still part of the prophecy to come to pass but it had already come to pass and it was still to come to pass and where was Mary Mary was the living word for her day she was a manifested word word for her day and the Fulfillment of Isaiah 7 and she was it amen was still some to come that's where we're at friends and I'm excited about the whole process I'm so excited you know you say well how long brother how long I don't know how long but I know there's two things that's got to happen before it finishes one the last predestinated seed has to come in and Unite with Christ and two I've got to come to a greater level of perfection than I am right now so what am I excited about I'm excited about what I'm going to learn today and what I'm going to learn tomorrow tomorrow and what the word's going to open and you say but sometimes the opening of the word exposes bad parts in me well praise God they got to get out so we can go I'm excited what God's going to show me through the next trial through the next blessing through the next time his word is made manifest through the next time somebody preaches through the next testimony I'm excited why because I'm right smack dab in the middle of the process and the whole thing is a thrill to me Mary was carrying she was carrying the Son of God she was carrying a manual inside of her it was such a thrill I think I think it would be a privilege even to have cravings right just got to have this yeah why because the word inside of me is craving it it's a thrill to become uncomfortable as the word begins to grow and take over her life now she can't sleep on her left side now what what is it this thing's taking over and it's taking over praise God what a privilege for Mary to be the the word made flesh and whatever she had to sacrifice and whatever she had to give up and whatever resentment the people had and whatever uncomfortableness it made inside of her praise be to God it was all exciting I wish I could interview Mary I'd love to know if she was ever uncomfortable had pain yeah was in discomfort was judged had her heart broken yeah yeah was rejected by family I wonder how labor was was it just easy simple like she was shocked and the baby was here or was it difficult was it a trial I'd love to interview her and ask her we are that Merry is it sometimes uncomfortable do you have to sacrifice some things to be the Fulfillment of the word yes but it's exciting it's a thrill it's an absolute privilege I'm so excited I believe it with all my heart and I can't wait to see the rest of this word fulfilled praise be to God as she got more pregnant and more pregnant and the word grew and grew inside of her no doubt if it was normal like a normal pregnancy she became more uncomfortable but as she became more uncomfortable she became more excited I I want that to be my life I want to be smack dab in the middle of the prophecy where the prophecy is working its way out in me and I want to give my life and I want to be enthused and excited about every part of it because I know what he's done I know what he's doing and I'm excited about what's coming I love this prophecy in process amen God bless you all let's all stand you know the when the opening of the seals ended the mystery of God but it also ended some mysteries for us the mystery of our life the mystery of what God's doing the mystery of what's going on all around us the opening of the word also alleviated some mysteries for us Mary had a lot of mysteries alleviated in that Angel's message and she knew what her life's purpose was she knew why she was on the planet she knew what she was to do she knew what was happening she didn't know everything but she knew a lot and here we are by an angel's message telling us that we are are that fulfillment of the word we are the word made flesh we are the prophecy alive today and and we know so much because of that Angel's message and so much is open there's still a lot we're not sure about yet but praise God I'm excited anyhow amen let's bow our heads together and pray Lord Jesus God I'm so thankful for your word Lord so thankful for this message lord it's so true it's so it's so real lord it so matches your word word God and we're so thankful we're so thankful you put something in our hearts that we can see you've given us an IAB that you've anointed our eyes with that we can say Lord we've seen you come we we know you're here we know the marriage is taking place and you've caught us up out of the carnality of this world and the confusion of leod deia and you've brought us to yourself you're here Whispering love secrets in our ears Lord we're so grateful for that and God as you fulfill that prophecy in our lives it is literally your word on display day by day it is your scriptures living in human flesh once again God help us to never lose sight of that help us to be thrilled and excited Lord as this word takes over our lives God we know there's more to come there's more excitement more more of a thrill more of our eyes holding the glory of your word coming to pass God we've seen so much and we know where we are we are right in the middle of your fulfilled scriptures and we couldn't be more grateful Lord your Prophet told us that the sleeping Saints are waiting for us come to Perfection God I ask that you would just take the water of that word and wash me once again I want to surrender Lord and pray that you'd wash wash my attitudes Lord that you'd wash away wash my desires may they match your word God my selfishness my pride would you wash it away

thinking may my reactions match your reactions may I talk like you and Walk Like You Lord that's what I believe your purpose is I believe that's why we've been in the middle of this prophecy for so
