========================================

[Music] I know that I am nothing to bear the Christian name. Oh, for every blunder that I make, I've just myself to blame. But glory, hallelujah, I don't see them at all. And neither does my Savior, for the God has cleansed them all. Oh, in him, in him, it's the only place for me. And I won't go back for anything to where I used to be. And the sun is always shining. And the victories been won. And I'm walking in the light of that new Jerusalem. Why do you talk of sorrow? For there is none in here. In Christ is no unhappiness. In Christ there is no fear. It doesn't seem to matter how dark it is outside. For in shakina glory soul is free to hide. Oh in him in him the only place to be. I won't go back for anything where I used to be. Oh, the sun is always shining and the victories been won. I'm walking in the light of that new Jerusalem. Oh, it doesn't seem to matter how this old flesh may feel. That every man's word be alive. God's word alone is real. Oh, how my heart's rejoicing. It's all in him, not me. And the glory is to him all eternity. In him, in him, it's the only place for me. Oh, I won't go back for anything. Where I used to be. The sun is always shining and the victories been won. And I'm walking in the light of that new Jerusalem. In him, oh in him. In him. It's the only place for me. I won't go back for anything. Where I used to be. The sun is always shining and the victories been won. And I'm walking in the light of that new Jerusalem. Amen. Amen. Walking in the light. Let's go to the key of E flat. Let's sing that song little by little. Amen. Little by little, I'm changing and I'm growing. Little by little. And I know that it's showing. I'm not who I'll be. And I'm not who I was. I'm somewhere in the middle. And God is changing me little by little. Oh, sometimes it seems that I'm so far away from all I want to be. God, his word says he'll finish one day all that he started in me. Oh, I looked at me and I don't understand, but God has a vision and God has a plan. Little by little, I'm changing and I'm growing. Little by little. And I know that it's showing. I'm not who I'll be. And I'm not who I was. I'm somewhere in the middle. Oh, God is changing me. Little by little. Oh, little by little, I'm changing and I'm growing. Little by little. And I know that it's showing. I'm not who I'll be and I'm not who I was. I'm somewhere in the middle and God is changing me little by little. He paid a debt that he did not owe. And I owed a debt that I could not pay. I needed someone to wash my sins away. And now I sing a brand new song. Amazing grace. All day long, Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. He paid a debt at Calvary. He cleansed my soul and set me free. I'm glad that Jesus did all my sins erased. [Music] I now can sing a brand new song. Amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. [Music] And now he's coming back for me to live with him eternally. Oh, it's been glorious to see him in this day. And I now will sing a brand new song. Amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. Oh, sing that verse again. And now he's coming back for me. I'll live with him eternally. Oh, it's been glorious to see him in this day. And I now sing this brand new song. Amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. Amen. so thankfully paid that debt. Father in heaven, how we love you and we lift your name in all the earth. May your kingdom be established in our praises as your people declare your mighty works. Oh, blessed be the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty who reigns forever more. Oh father in heaven, how we love you and we lift your name in all the earth. And may your kingdom be established in our praises as your people declare your mighty works. Blessed be the Lord. Let's stand together as we sing that. Almighty. Oh, who was and is and is to come. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty who reigns forever more. Oh, blessed be the Lord God Almighty who was and is and to come. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty who reigns forever more. Oh, he reigns forever more. Amen. As brother Simon comes tonight, let's sing that. Welcome, Holy Spirit. Welcome Holy Spirit for we are in your presence in your &gt;&gt; power live inside of me. Oh, welcome Holy Spirit [Music] for we are in your presence. [Music] Oh, fill us with your power. Live inside of me.

Oh, fill us with your power and live inside of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. The Lord's good. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's nice to be here. It's maybe not nice to be here, but all is well. All is well. Thank you. I appreciate that. Bash, brother, John. All is well. What can we say? Greetings first of all and greetings from Brother Chad. He called me just as I was coming in and he said, "Pass on his love and greetings." So, we just pray for Brother Chad as he's traveling with David. Um, all is well. Let's just turn if we can to Corinthians 3. while you're turning. Just like I said, I'm just trying to calm down here a sec. And there's a time of your life, you know, when you're a teenager or when you're younger and you just don't shut up. You just keep and then when you get a bit older, maybe you get a little bit wiser and then you stand here and all your thoughts just disappear. But all is well. I'm going to try and I'm going to apologize ahead of time because my notes are probably everywhere. And um yeah, I was just I thought my brother John was going to sing till half past, but I was trying to finish as quick as I could. But all is well. Let's just see how we get on. 2 Corinthians chapter 3 if we can. And I'd like to read verses 1 to three if that's okay. Verses 1 to three. It says here, "Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you? Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men. For as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in the fleshy tables of the heart." Amen. Let's just pray over the reading of the word if we can. Lord Jesus, we just ask that you come and speak to us, Lord. We pray. Put ourselves to one side, Lord. The speaker and the hearer, Lord. Just you speak through us and you hear through us, Lord, we pray. We love you, Lord. We can do nothing. You do so much for us, Lord. It's the smallest thing that we can do. Come and be used of you. That's what we want. That's our desire, Lord Jesus. So, we just ask that you help us, Lord, and just take away any nervousness and just just speak to us. We pray. We love you, Lord Jesus. And we just thank you Lord for all things. Amen. You may be seated. Lord's good. You know, sometimes I try and tell myself, look, if we would just sit around as though I'd sit around, sit like we would be sitting at the feet of the Lord Jesus. That would be um a beautiful thing. And we wouldn't be nervous. We would just sit there and he would like a father to a son talk to us and encourage us. And so we are um that's what we want to do this evening. Just come and just hear from the Lord. And I want to hear from the Lord too. So you know over the last couple of services um it's always this is what really stresses stresses you out is that the Lord kind of gives you a word or you think you know you think oh this is really beautiful and you kind of go and then the Lord kind of changes direction and then you're kind of left dangling which is good because then it's not us it's got to be the Lord. But you know, the last couple of services, um, uh, I felt the Lord was kind of directing me in these this direction. And it's unusual, very unusual. Not unusual when it's your home church, but unusual, but kind of it's almost carrying on from what brother Chad's been speaking on the similar subject, which is good. It's always nice when we can have that sort of continuity. And like I said, if it's yourself speaking, then that's nice. But if you're being inspired and then let's just go that way. So our thought this evening is you are the living word manifested. You are the living word manifested. Pardon me. As I said it's also almost continuing on from brother Chad because I had to shorten it down a little bit because you know you are the living word made manifest in simplicity but that's a little bit long but it truly is that simple. Um, so many of us get so caught up with being complex, you know, and we end up getting complex is because we're not complex, but we're not supposed to be, you know, and so the subject when we when we would hear the subject, you are the living word made manifest, then immediately we would think, oo, that's complicated, but it's actually not complicated. And you know, if if if I can just bring something in a simple way that we can catch the picture, then then it's then it's good. if we would go out of here with loads of long words and not knowing what everything meant. And I've, you know, it's funny because I said years ago, I said, I remember preaching about um uh you know, those those guys that go would go to a convention and they go to this convention, they come back on the convention high and you know, you say, "Oh, it's just amazing. You should have been there. You should have heard it. Oh, it was just oh, it was just Oh." And you say, "Well, what was preached?" And they're like, at me. I don't know, but it was good. &gt;&gt; And you know that's kind of and then I think we went somewhere literally two weeks maybe later and that exact thing happened. Somebody was talking about this and I just we just said look you know so what was preached and they said but I don't know but it was good and it was it was comical but what it is is if you go somewhere see the sometimes the simplest things that are preached are the things that kind of stay with us the longest &gt;&gt; and you know a a good school teacher is somebody who you can still remember the things that they told you &gt;&gt; and you know for me school was a bit of a drag because that's not my apartment. But there's still things that I remember because it was made simple. &gt;&gt; It's like you guys with your inches. &gt;&gt; It's like, yeah. So, how long is this? Well, it's 4 foot and 38 and 416 of a. But then brother John the other day he just got his pen out and he marked on the barn door, barn wall, whatever it was. He drew a few lines. He says, "Well, look," he said, "It sort of goes up and it goes down." I was like, "Well, that's fair. Do it. It's like 10 and a half." He says, "Well, there's your quarters. Then there's this." And he explained it. It was like the penny kind of dropped. So there's a way of explaining something. And that's basically my goal in life. Because my personal testimony is I sat in church until I was an adult with three kids that were yay big. Um, and you come out of church and you would It's I don't know if you know the story of the Empress New Clothes, but it's like I was always that little kid when I was like 10 years ago. I was always the little kid that didn't I was the other people that didn't want to admit that they didn't know what they were talking about. You know, the long words that are used and you don't know what they mean. So, if we can just kind of break it down and &gt;&gt; take it into bite-sized chunks, then we can understand and draw it on the side of the barn. &gt;&gt; Amen. in in a language that we can understand. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; things don't have to be complicated. &gt;&gt; You know, God is hidden and revealed in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Let's just read that. We're going to come back to this scripture a couple of times. Let's go to Luke chapter 10. Let's go to Luke chapter 10. Like I said, we'll come back to this a few times. We're going to read 19- 24. Luke 10:19- 24. The Lord Jesus says, "Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions over the over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you. Notwithstanding in this, rejoice not." The spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven. In that hour the Lord Jesus rejoiced in his spirit and said, I thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered to me now of the Father. No man knoweth who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but the Son, and he whom the Son will reveal him. And he turned again unto his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see." And I want you to just listen to this verse 24 because this is astounding. It says,"For I tell you that many," listen to this, not just kings, because the kings don't particularly have to be prophets or anyone spiritual, but prophets, many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which you see and have not seen them, and to hear the things which you hear and have not heard them. You know, it doesn't matter how uh how much the the prophets in the Old Testament or not all the prophets. The prophets, you see, when when a book's got a seal on it and you peel off the first four books, you can only go as far as that &gt;&gt; and then you peel off more, you can only go as far as that. &gt;&gt; And you can you see what I mean? &gt;&gt; And so even in the Old Testament, everything was foreshadowing. And and you get um like Abraham and Sarah buried in the promised land. You get Isaac buried in the promised land. They saw they saw what was going on, but they didn't see what you see. &gt;&gt; So it, you know, blessed are your eyes. Blessed are your ears. The things that we hear now &gt;&gt; is just like on such another level. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we don't struggle to understand it, do we? &gt;&gt; It's just simple. &gt;&gt; You see, like I said, we get so many hang-ups on being simple. Everybody wants to be complicated. I don't know how it is in the US, but in England, I might have said this before, you know, a cleaner, that's that would be a cleaner who would come and like clean a a building or whatever, they don't call them cleaners anymore. It's called a hygiene technician. That's true story. That's true story. You know, that's just one example. You know, everything that we have in life has got some fancy name. Nobody wants to be simple anymore. But you see the funny thing is God himself is reveals and hides himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; The very thing that we don't want. &gt;&gt; So actually when we have complexes about being simple actually we getting complexes about being like him. True. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True story. You see, everybody wants to be, &gt;&gt; but actually the Lord's the one who humbled himself. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "Let this mind be in being you that was in Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; We're supposed to have the same attitude in all things. &gt;&gt; So simplify ourselves, humble ourselves down. And you know the Lord, many times the Lord will humble us through situations. And we know enough about that and we all do. &gt;&gt; But many times the Lord will humble us, humble us through situations. But you know, many times the Lord gives you the opportunity for you to humble yourself &gt;&gt; and then he'll wait for you to take it. &gt;&gt; True story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will wait for you to take it. &gt;&gt; See, we need to just accept the way that he is choosing to reveal himself. &gt;&gt; And he's choosing to reveal himself through you in a simple way. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not looking for all the like brother Bannon would say the stuffed church and all the rest of it. He's looking to reveal himself in simplicity. If he has always revealed himself in simplicity then he always will. &gt;&gt; So if you want to be used of the Lord and you say well I want to see the the Lord that I want the Lord to be seen in my life then just be simple be humble. Be simple just normal. You know, you know, when you look through the Bible, you look through right up to our day, all the men that the Lord used were simple. They were like, you know, farmers, fishermen, just tent makers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They were just simple people. Now, there's nothing wrong with being clever. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's not about that. We're not talking about that. But we're just talking. See, even the cleverest people can just be the the humblest people, the simplest people. &gt;&gt; You see? You say, "Well, what about Paul and Moses? They were both super clever." Yeah, but before the Lord could use them, he had to humble them down. &gt;&gt; He had to make them nothing. The The thing is, it's like on the way here, I wasn't finished. And I was about breaking up in tears. And it's like I said, I said to Mar, I said, "Well," I said, "The good thing is, you know, if if every she said, "You were fine." I said, "I'm not fine." I said, "But I suppose if I was fine, then it wouldn't be good." You know, we need to rely on the Lord. You know, if if I would come up here and just say a few words and you know, that's that's the thing. I'm not Paul. But, you know, for those who knew me from the old life, the old Simon, mate, I was the middle of every party. I was the one like this. I was one with the best jokes. I was one with this and I was like, and you get to the point where you can't say anything anymore. you're just like kicked around and kicked in the corner and everyone runs over the top of you and you just sometimes that little sticky out of nature comes up and sticks up and says, "Yeah, well actually but it's like well afterwards you feel so bad." You say, "Lord, forgive me. I shouldn't have said that. Just let everyone kick over the top. It's fine. &gt;&gt; It's fine." But you know when the Lord kind of humbles us down then suddenly we can't speak. But if I would speak then it wouldn't be good anyway. &gt;&gt; All is well. &gt;&gt; Just don't ask me to be a wedding. whatever it is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Because when you stand there, it just doesn't work. &gt;&gt; All is well. See, Paul and Moses had to be humbled before God could manifest himself through them. Don't forget, brother says he like Moses was it was the Lord Jesus Christ in Moses. It was the Lord in Paul. It was the Lord in all these ones. And the Lord can only use us when we are humbled down. You know, Paul and Moses had to be simplified &gt;&gt; to be used because if if the Lord reveals himself in simplicity, there's only one way it's going to be done and that's in a simple way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But says here in 63, he says it's God hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same. He says, catch those two scriptures. Who has believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? Even then Jesus thanked God that he had hid the mysteries from the wise and prudent and would reveal it to babes such as would learn &gt;&gt; for it seemed good to God to do that. Now from this text or I call it from the scripture reading I draw this text God hiding himself then revealing himself in the same and for the tapes I keep repeating. So for the tapes because they're taping it see and we can listen to it again. as God hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same. It's a strange thing to think how that God does such a thing as that. God will hide himself in something so simple that it'll cause a wise man to miss it a million miles &gt;&gt; then turn right back around in that some simple thing in simplicity of his way of working and reveal himself right out again. I thought I made a text. I thought we might study this before we go into the great teachings of the seven seals. Many miss him by the way he reveals himself. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; we are so busy looking. This is why, you know, when the Lord Jesus came the first time, they missed him. &gt;&gt; I mean, talk about how can you miss it? You know, that's a bit of an Easter message, but you know, when the Lord Jesus is crucified, I mean, you could work, brother. I mean, in Daniel 7:2, you could work it out to the day that the Lord comes in on the on the ass of a fool &gt;&gt; and they're even in the temple singing it for goodness sake. Seriously. &gt;&gt; And all religious and all pious with the suits on all riding on with the gold scroll, you know, cuz they, you know, riding on an ass on the f of an ass. And there's a big noise outside and like what's going on? And they go and look out and oh, it's just somebody on a ass and on the f of an ass. And they close the curtain. And then they pick up the old scroll and he readjusts his gold necklace. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And riding on a f of an ass. Like for real. &gt;&gt; For real. But you see because it in theory they're looking for it. But actually, when it happens, it's so simple. &gt;&gt; And the donkey didn't have any bling. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, it didn't have no chrome on it or anything. And he was just, let's face it, the Lord had been beaten. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was dirty. &gt;&gt; He was dirty. If that was your neighbor, &gt;&gt; maybe you wouldn't want to go and help him &gt;&gt; without a pair of gloves. No, seriously. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I mean? like the Lord was beaten in such a way and the donkey and everything and the dust pounding up and the look out because it wasn't how they thought it was going to be &gt;&gt; they rejected it. You see many miss him by the way he reveals himself &gt;&gt; you know for his bride because I like this thought I like this small thought because we come from him right we know that it's Ephesians 1 we were chosen him before the foundation of the world because we come from him we're actually made of the same material &gt;&gt; so any of you people out there you know you've you've got your father maybe father John and he's got um Peter sitting next to you and he's got Levi and Emma. If you would kind of do all the DNA testing stuff, you'd be like, "Oh yeah, that's John." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because because they're made from the same material. &gt;&gt; And so if we come from God somewhere, there's got to be that. And that's what we call talk about the faith seed. There's got to be that faith seed DNA somewhere there &gt;&gt; that reflects the father. We're made of the same material, you know. And I like this, like I said, this small thought, you know, we speak the same language as God. And that's why when we when the Lord reveals himself in simplicity, we it's not hard for us to understand because he speaks our language. Listen, the Lord said that we're his sheep. &gt;&gt; He said, "Feed my sheep." He said he said, "Feed my lambs." &gt;&gt; But he's the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; So, we're all speaking the same lang lamb language. &gt;&gt; You know, we speak the same language. We don't struggle to understand these things. See, when the Lord reflects, sorry, reveals himself to us, you know, for us, we it's not a foreign language. We we understand and when we when we hear it because we're made of the same material, we're actually looking into the mirror. And that's why we say looking into the mirror of the word, you know, we see ourselves reflecting something in us. There's just that DNA. You don't look I'm sure in the past they've done like tests you know when the parents don't know who they are this that and the other or they've been lost and all the rest of it they come together there's some kind of connection there they can't understand it and you know the son the longlost son comes home and the father's maybe I don't know but the when families come together there's an unseen connection and he's kind of you don't you know maybe it's the way I've said it before we scratch your head or however it is it's just you can see the reflection of the father in the sun and so and and now many miss him And many miss who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Although you're the word. Listen, unless Although you're the word that's revealed, manifested in this day. Yeah. The Lord chose himself to reveal himself in his bride, right? You are the word made manifest. The the epistles of of of the word. Many will miss it because we look the way we do. &gt;&gt; I don't see any of the big gold check necklaces. I don't see any bling. I don't see any fanciness. I don't say we're just simple people, but we're simple because the DNA of our father is simple &gt;&gt; in the way that he reveals himself. So the way that we reveal ourselves is the same way. &gt;&gt; Now, we are simple, but we ain't stupid. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking for you. &gt;&gt; No, it's true. We're simple, but we ain't stupid. We're simple, but we're not ignorant. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just go to Psalms 19. Psalms 197 and 8. I can turn to it if you want. Psalms 197 and 8 says he's going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it. And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. The law of the Lord is perfect. converting the soul. Sorry, I read six. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. So notice here it says, "The law of the Lord maketh wise." He maketh wise the simple. So anyone who humbles himself before the Lord, he makes them wise. Now, we're not talking about worldly wisdom. It says the commandments of the Lord are pure enlightening the eyes. The law and the commandments are his word. It's his word. And so, because we've humbled ourselves, being the bride of Christ, we've humbled ourselves. Okay? The law of the Lord is making us wise and the commandment of the Lord is enlightening the eyes. He's giving us revelation. Because we humble ourselves, it pleases the Lord. Revelation is a gift. Don't forget. And remember, the Lord's hiding himself in simplicity. He's revealing himself unto babes that will learn. I think we read the scripture already. You see, so through the word, we're made wise. Now, we're not stupid. We're simple. And the wisdom we have is not worldly wisdom. So, you teenagers that think like you can make a million bucks by making a phone call, don't go out from here thinking, "Yes, now I've got the wisdom." We're not talking about that. We're speaking about the the the godly wisdom, not earthly wisdom. And listen, when we talk about the intelligent, we're not talking about physical intelligence. This is the beautiful thing about the Lord is that when he reveals himself, it's about he's revealing himself to people that will learn, people that want to learn, &gt;&gt; people that have got a hunger in their heart for the Lord. Revelation does not come through learning. It's a gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's and it's sovereignly given. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's sovereignly given. It's nothing we've done. It's purely by grace. Now, let's just turn back to 2 Corinthians again if we can. 2 Corinthians chapter 3 again. Let's read it. It says, "Do we," we're going to read 1:3. "Do we again commend uh do we begin to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you? Ye are our epistle in our hearts known and read of all men. For as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, not with ink, not with the spirit of the living God, but not in tables of stone, but in the fleshy tables of the heart. Listen, this letters of commendation and a and us being a written epistle, this is actually describing something being witnessed. Here we are. It's speaking about something being witnessed. And when we talk about being witness, it's a living testimony. It's a living witness of the word. &gt;&gt; Now when we are manifestly declared to be the epistles of of of of of Christ then it means that actually we are witnesses of the word preached. I want you to notice here it says here in um verse three for as much as ye are manifest declared to be listen carefully the epistle of Christ ministered by us. So basically Paul's looking on these people and he's telling them that's the bride of the first church age. He's looking on these people and he's telling them that you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered and put this is Paul speaking by me &gt;&gt; by me. So actually they have actually become a written epistle. Now an epistle is a letter. a letter which is a testimony, a witness, a letter um a written letter. So we are written epistles and we are manifesting the word and actually those around us can now read what's being preached in our day by reading our lives. &gt;&gt; You see it says we are read of all men. Ye are uh our epistle uh written in our hearts known and read of all men. You know, when I when I read that, I thought, you know, it's the old uh 31st of October thing going on. You can't go to Manard's or somewhere without some great big orange teddy bear with fangs &gt;&gt; booing at you. &gt;&gt; It's like, what's going on? &gt;&gt; Right. But and it just seems, listen carefully, it just seems so in your face, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; It's so in your face, &gt;&gt; bang about what are you? Because we are known and read of all men. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And whether they want it or not, we are walking around a living. You know when it says in the heart, it says there in verse three, if you look at the end, it says not in tables of stone. So it's not your big orange teddy bear. It says but in fleshy tables of the heart. It's not something physical like a like a it's the heart. When it speaks about the heart, we're speaking about life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's a living testimony. So, as we walk around, whether they like it or you don't, Brother Chad's been going through the airports, and there's been thousands of people &gt;&gt; that have had to pass him. &gt;&gt; Now, we're not in people's faces, if you get my meaning. But actually, they have no choice but to read that letter. &gt;&gt; See, whether they look at you and look at you disdainfully, well, they've looked at this and looked at it distastefully. &gt;&gt; See, whether they look at it and think, "Oh, mate, that's a really nice family." That's then they've actually looked at it. They've looked at your family out and about acting how you should, headship of the father, watching out for his children, this that and the other, caring for his family. They've seen you &gt;&gt; and they've said and they've said, "Mate, that's a really nice family." What are they saying? They are saying, "Mate, you know, actually the way that the Lord has the family, that's actually because that's what you are. You're becoming this reflection, the word made manifest, living epistles, living." And that's what that's that's like I said, you know, we it's kind of in your face everything of the world, but actually when you think about it, wherever we go, we are also that billboard wherever we go. Yeah. Yeah. Don't forget that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to John one. This is quite nice. Let's go to John one if we can. John 1 1:9. So this says speaking now we're about living epistles, the witnesses. Yep. Witnesses of the word. It says, "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him. Without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of men. And the light shined in darkness and darkness comprehended it not. There was a man sent from John whose name sorry there was a man sent from God whose name was John. The same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe. He was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light. That was the true light which lightth every man that cometh into the world. Amen. Notice John was not that light. That's right. &gt;&gt; But was a witness of that light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so that light actually was in John. The same light although he was a witness. The same light is the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The light was in John and it was shining out and it was manifesting itself. The Lord was manifesting himself. That light was manifesting himself through John. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So he was not that light. John the Baptist was only listening there on the river when he appeared. &gt;&gt; He was a witness of the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was only standing there when he appeared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says he's 65. &gt;&gt; He says, "I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river. I was only standing there when he appeared. I'm not the one that performs these things and fortell these things that happen so perfectly as they are. I'm only one that's near when he does it. I was only a voice that he used to say it." Listen, John the Baptist, when he was there, the Lord was living through him and he was baptizing. He was doing that thing that the Lord had shown him to do in the desert. &gt;&gt; The Lord had showed him to do that. He was doing that. So, who was it that was actually doing it? &gt;&gt; It wasn't John. It was the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So, now we've got the same thing again here, Brother Bannon. I was only near when he does it. I was only the voice he used to say it. It wasn't what I knew. It's what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through. This is the thing with humbling yourself. To humble yourself isn't just like the old days of before Luther came to the truth of whipping yourself and beating yourself. The old Catholic doctrine. That's not it's not that's not humbling yourself. Humbling yourself is surrendering. &gt;&gt; Surrendering to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, "I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through. It isn't me. It wasn't the seventh angel." No, it was a manifestation of the son of God. It wasn't the angel his message. It was a mystery that God unfolded. It's not a man. It's God. The angel was not the son of man. He was a messenger from the son of man. The son of man is Christ. He is the one that you're feeding on. You're not feeding on a man. His words will fail. You're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord's good. So where am I? So that uh I told you I did warn you did not say it. There we go. And I'm old fashioned so everything's on paper. &gt;&gt; You see, brother Brandon was not that light. Although the light was in him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But he was not that light, but he was sent to bear witness of that light. &gt;&gt; Let's just go to Matthew 28 if we can. Matthew 28. We're just going to touch on this little We're going to read 1:7 to 7. Speaking about witnesses, witnesses of the gospel, witnesses of the word. In the end of the Sabbath, it began to dawn de to to dawn towards the first day of the week. Come Mary and Magdalene and the other Mary to separate. And behold, there was a great earthquake. For the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning. His raignment was white as snow. And for fear did the keepers the key the keepers did shake and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto him, "Fear not, for I know that thou ye seek Jesus which was crucified. He is not here for he is risen." And he said, "Come and see the place where the Lord lay. Go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. Behold, he goeth before you into Galilee." that there ye shall see him. Lo, I have told you. So, here we go again. Listen. This is now the angel of the Lord. But it was not the Lord Jesus. It wasn't the Lord Jesus. It was the angel of the Lord. Notice in verse five, the L the angel answered said unto the woman, "Fear ye not, for I know that ye seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here, but he is risen." So here the angel um he was a witness of that light. Again, you see, always the life of God will witness the word. And so, he was here as a witness that to to to to Mary telling basically a witness is somebody that tells you of something that's happened. Yeah. So, he's telling her that the Lord is risen. And so, notice his countenance shone. It says in verse three, his countenance was like lightning. His raignment white as snow. And you know, one thing that we we you can't be in the presence of God without being changed. Yes, &gt;&gt; that angel came from the presence of God, a manifestation of God. It comes from God himself. It's impossible to come from God without something being changed. Look at Moses. I'm going to read Moses actually. Exodus 34. Exodus 34. Let's read Exodus 34. We'll read 29-35. It says, "In it came to pass when Moses came down from the Mount Si with the two tables of the testimony in Moses' hand. when he came down from the mount that Moses whisp not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come nigh him. And Moses called unto them, and Aaron, and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him, and Moses talked with them. And afterward the children of Israel came nigh, and he gave them in commandment, and all the Lord had spoken with him in Mount Si until Moses had done speaking with him, he put a veil on his face. But when the Lord went in before, but when Moses went in before the Lord to speak unto him, he took the veil off until he came out. And he came out and spake to the children of Israel, that which was commanded. And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses that the skin of Moses' face shone. And Moses put the veil on his face again until he went in to speak with him. Amen. So Moses had a message. Moses obviously was a messenger. &gt;&gt; Moses had a message from God. He's coming back to the children of Israel now with his message. He was not that light but he was a witness of what that light was telling him. There was a message to be given. And you know Moses was so filled with the spirit that even his face shone. He was in the presence of God. It can't be that we can be in the presence of God without being changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, sometimes, you know, sometimes, look, we all go through the ups and downs a little bit. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you'll go to church and the Lord will really strike your heart with something and you'll come out and you'll you'll feel something's changed inside. And it's because you've touched the hem of his garment. It's because you've you you've drawn close to him and he's touched you in a special way. We can't be in the presence of God without being changed. Steven had a message. Steven actually had a message. He was preaching in the in the council and he was not that light. He wasn't that light, but he was a witness of that light. And when he stood before the council, they looked on him steadfastly. They saw his face as as though it was the face of an angel. &gt;&gt; Angel is a messenger, but they say his face was shining. Eve's face was the face of an angel. Let's just read that. I know we're back and forth in the scriptures and it's it's Wednesday and I know we're tired, but let's just have a look. It's it's only one verse. In fact, I'll just read it. It's verse uh chapter 6:15. It says, "And and this is I don't want to read the whole thing. It's just this." And all that sat in the council looking steadfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. Why didn't they listen to him then? &gt;&gt; Because it wasn't simple. Oh, sorry. It wasn't complicated. He didn't have the gold chains. He didn't have the golden chariot outside. It was just a humble, simple person that was filled with the Holy Spirit. It says and verse 8 and Steven full of faith and power and great wonders and miracles among the people. If the Lord used him, put it this way, if the Lord used him in that way, great many miracles, full of faith and power, then I'll tell you one thing, he had to have been humble. &gt;&gt; He had to have been simple. &gt;&gt; Because if the Lord was choosing to reveal himself through and then he preaches this phenomenal sermon. &gt;&gt; How can that be anyone else but God speaking through a man? &gt;&gt; So, he had to have humbled himself. He had to have simplified his life. Yes. &gt;&gt; See what I mean? The Lord's good. &gt;&gt; See, I just I remember when um I think it was brother Eddie Biscll in his testimony. Was it him going well I think it was before he shot that moose that walked out on the road. Do you remember that one? And he's in the car with brother I think that's right. In the car with brother Bham and I think he sleeps and he wakes up and he said brother Brown's face was kind of white. Oh is that Billy Paul? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Eddie Biscoll. That's it. And his face hairs were sticking out and his face was white. when you're in the presence of God, your face has got to change. It's just physically impossible to be. And so now, even when brother Eddie, I think he says he says he was absolutely scared to kind of even look sideways, he knew something was there. But even when the Lord when this when the when the when when that when that pillar of fire left, when the Lord left the car as they're still cruising down the road, he kind of looks across. Brother Ram's face was a witness of what had just happened. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? You can't there's no hiding it. There's no hiding it. When the prophet had been in the presence of the Lord, even after so many times, his face still turned ashen. You know, when you look at picture of brother Adam when he's he passed away when he was 56, he looks like he's in his late 70s. You can't be in and out of the presence of God like that without why the Lord Jesus himself. Imagine that vessel that the Lord used and it's the presence of almighty God living in it day in day out. They they they said that he said before Abraham I was. They said, "You're not a man over 50." Why 50, not 30? He was 30. &gt;&gt; Because of the the the the body was under such &gt;&gt; you can't be a this these bodies cannot be in the presence of God without the being a change. &gt;&gt; One of these days we're going to be changed totally. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord's good. And then again, because we're this witness, our lives witness, we those around us with these written epistles, those around us, they can see the change. They can see something's happened. You might come out of here and on a on a after a service and and you just something's changed. And somebody around you, maybe those close to you, they can see a difference. They're like, "Mate, you've something's happened." That's the whole point. You know, people people used to get upset with me because, you know, I changed my ideas, you know. Well, yeah, that's the whole point. We're supposed to &gt;&gt; we're supposed to change, you know, but people people get upset because well, you you know, even though you're a message believer and you you're so-called message and what you used to be and you do this and that and pardon me, you you'd allow this and allow that and then when you change your ideas and the Lord straightens you up like, "Yeah, but you used to." Yeah, that's the point. &gt;&gt; We used to, but we've come into the presence of the Lord and the Lord's changed us and and we can't be the same anymore. We can't walk anymore. You see what is it? We have been we've been in the presence of God and now we're this witness. We are a witness of that light. We're a written epistle. And notice we're a written epistle of the word preached in our day. I want to go back again to this 2 Corinthians. 2 Corinthians. And we're going to read verse three. It says, "For as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart." Listen, Paul is pointing out, like I said, that that they have become a written epistle of the word which Paul preached. So, in other words, if you wanted to see what Paul had preached, all you got to do is look at the people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And remember it says known and read of all men. And not just those people are in around church. It says known and read of all men. You see if you wanted to know what what Paul preached just look at the saints lives. &gt;&gt; Look at how they acted. Look at what they did. They were a written testimony of what was being preached. And that's how it's been through all the churches in the bride in the bride in the church ages. So you know if you want to know what Luther preached just look at the people. Look at the people and you would have seen that change. You would have seen them coming out of the Catholicism. You receive. You want to know what Wesley preached? Look at the W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W Wesians, the way that they methodically practiced their religion, the way that they served the Lord methodically. You look at the way that they did it. See, then you could see what was being preached and it's got to be the same today. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we stop and think about it, if we do 1 + 1 is two, &gt;&gt; then actually the bride is a further manifestation of the word. &gt;&gt; You know, this is not this is Simon. It's not a new doctrine. &gt;&gt; But the Lord wrote the Bible in the stars. &gt;&gt; The Lord wrote the Bible in the pyramid. &gt;&gt; The Lord wrote the Bible this Bible we have now. Amen. &gt;&gt; But actually, if we are written epistles, &gt;&gt; then we're actually the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If people can pick it up your life and read your life and say, "Mate, you know, we shouldn't be doing this. We shouldn't be doing that because they don't do it." And they're reading the word or my goodness, why do they do so? Why? If they're reading the word that look, you say, "Well, it's not you can't get the seals and you can't do this and you can't." Well, hang about how much of the seals and how much of this that and the other can we read the pyramid? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Like the stars, you know, unless you know the stars and you just can't do it. It's it's it's just a it's it's so it's it's like a it's just a different This is like an in-depth version, but we should be pretty in depth. &gt;&gt; We should be pretty in-depth. We should be actually &gt;&gt; what the prophet preached. We should be living. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then people will actually, like I say, they they can do their orange big goofy teddy bears out there, but when they're watching us, they should actually be asking the question, what is different about these guys? &gt;&gt; What's different? &gt;&gt; Because this is a revealed word. This is a furtherment of something that we're used to because we ain't used to seeing this, &gt;&gt; you know? How can they act like they do? How can they how can you do that? You know, it's like I think it's the um like the the old Menanites and different ones now. They live by law. The Aish and that they live by they live a real nice life, but they live it by a law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think there's been the younger sisters that are working in the pantry and that and they and they'll ask him, "Look, you know, this is what I've heard. They've asked them, how do you live like that without someone telling you what to do?" &gt;&gt; Right? Well, the thing is we become the word. &gt;&gt; In theory, we should be able I mean, this is going a bit far, but in theory, we should be able to look in the mirror and say, "My goodness, that's praise the Lord. I'm seeing the word. I'm see I'm reading it in my own life." &gt;&gt; You know, and for those of you who used to have a bad temper and you know, all if if you see the way that you've tamed down, you can see his progression. You can see the progression of how you're going and you can actually see yourself lining up with the mirror that we're supposed to be lining up with. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's just go to 64. Brother says any influences 64. He says, remember the Bible said, this is now speaking about remember with a living manifested word. Remember the Bible said you are living written epistles read of all men. Now, many people won't read the Bible, but God has made you a living representative. &gt;&gt; Hang about. If I would start to preach something that was wrong, you wouldn't be very happy right now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; True story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And there wouldn't be many amens. &gt;&gt; But what about if we would start living wrong out there? &gt;&gt; You're doing the same thing. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See each one of us, this is we we've got a responsibility. The Lord has made you a living representative. He a representative basically is somebody who represents a company or represents or an ambassador represents the king or whatever you want to represent. A representative is basically you look at that person and you that's why you know um someone in the medical field you don't want someone to represent your company and they got like all the studs and the long hair and never washed for 3 months and you know it's like well we don't really want that as a representative for our company. You're looking for that cleancut nice smelling straight guy that's going to represent your company the way that you would see it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's how it is with the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord's called us to be representative. He says, "But God has made Listen, &gt;&gt; he's not actually asked you." &gt;&gt; He said, "He's made you." &gt;&gt; But God has made you. We have no choice in this. &gt;&gt; God has made you a living representative. You are a walking letter. Should be a walking Bible. Christ in you. You should be the walking word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You should be the walking word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Read of all men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice if we are what we're supposed to be, walking living word bride. Then it actually would have the same effect as when someone would pick up a Bible in a bookstore and read. True. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we're not talking about all the, you know, Old Testament names and things. No. But when you when somebody picks up a Bible in a Bible store, I mean, who's been to a Bible store recently in the last five years? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Have you seen the section where they've got Bibles for ladies, men, &gt;&gt; ladies who, you know, Bibles for teenagers, Bibles for kiddies, Bibles for I mean, they've got everything, you know. They've got Bibles where no one's going to be offended. If you would actually pick up somebody would go out in the world and pick your neighbor pick up the Bible in a bookshop the original a good King James pick it up and start reading there's going to be two things happen either they'll be convicted which shows that they're understanding what's written. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or they'll absolutely reject it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So when they see us if we remember the Bible said you are living written epistles read of all men. Now many people won't read the Bible but God has made you a living representative. You are a walking letter. You should be a walking Bible. Christ in you. You should be the walking word of God. Right? So now when you are the walking word of God and this happens daily. You walk into a shop, two things will happen. They'll either love you or hate you. &gt;&gt; And it's the Lord said if they hate you, it's not you that they hate because they hated me first. Why? Because you are the walking Bible. You are basically like not like the orange thing. You know what I'm saying? But you are walking out there. There's nowhere for them to look. They have You go to the counter. What they going to do? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What would you like? I want that one. No, not that one. This one. No. No. They've got to look at you. And when they look at you, I'm I'm telling you, you know, we we've had it recently. You know, you go to the old Starbucks and there's somebody who's um a little bit confused.com and I've got the cross in the car and I'm telling you every single time they make my coffee wrong on purpose and they give it with a smile. &gt;&gt; See what is it? Either you're con they're convicted and I don't think that's the case in that one or they just absolutely hate you because they hate the word. &gt;&gt; You see when you are that living written epistle, you're the Bible. You're on show. You're for everyone to see it and this and actually then you're doing the right thing and you don't like wait till the judgment. No, no, no. You just say, "Lord, help him. Lord, help him." You You're as nice as you can be to them. The Lord Jesus was he says he says he's kind. The Bible says God is kind to the unthankful and the evil. It's like really? So, how much more do we need to be that way? Somebody does something against you, it's fine. It's fine. You know what? The only the only problem we would have is if you raise above zero, oh, how dare you do that to me? Do you know who I am? &gt;&gt; Come on. It's all good. &gt;&gt; Okay. It's all good. Right. So, the lives, you know, so so and many times, you know, that the people do they get pricricked in the heart and like, mate, you know, I've noticed that and for you guys it's more normal. Um, but for us it's it's pretty different. It's very different. In England, it's very very different. You know, you you you have a cross in your car and people absolutely like look at your car, they'll almost key your car. It's pretty bad. But you see the or they'll see you and they'll come up to you and they'll say very rarely, you know, what a beautiful family. What are they saying? What a beautiful picture of God. &gt;&gt; You know, they don't know what they're saying, but they just, &gt;&gt; you see what I mean? Okay. So, it's so simple. We have to just surrender. Surrender ourselves. See, when the Lord takes over and lives himself through through you now, suddenly without even thinking, you're manifesting God. &gt;&gt; Who likes Chinese food in here? &gt;&gt; Boom. I'm among family. Listen, something in me, I just can't help it. &gt;&gt; I just like it. &gt;&gt; And so, there's some things in life that we just like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know Brother Chuck doesn't like it. But I like it &gt;&gt; and I can't help it. You see, he's manifesting who he is and I'm manifesting who I am. And it's the same thing with with when we surrender, if the Lord is in us, if it's his life in us, then we taste, we have his taste. &gt;&gt; And we're not talking about food now. We're talking about these things, spiritual things. So without thinking about it, and now what makes Brother Chuck like the steak and chips? And I mean, I like steak and chips, but And what likes me like the Chinese? What is it? And why is it I always come back to food. But but what is it? It's just kind of something who I am. It's my it's me. It's the unseen me that just likes it. And so it's the life within me. And that's why we have all our diff that's why we're all so different because there's different each one's got a separate soul, a separate life, you know, we're not all this regimental soldiers. And so and so we're all each one of us different. But one thing we have in common is the same life of God that's in us. So for the spiritual things, we will have the same taste. We will have the same desires. Look, &gt;&gt; we're all here tonight because we want to change for the better. &gt;&gt; We want to hear from the Lord. We want to know, Lord, what can we do to to to change? What can I do? Lord, help me. See, we've got that desire in us. So, if we surrender then and there's that life inside us without helping it. We all like Chinese food. It's not a new doctrine. It's just listen, it's that simple. It's that simple. We don't have to learn this and learn that and learn the other. You don't you don't have to be able to recite every Bible in order. Look, not even I can do that. Did you hear that? I mean, I can't recite all the I've got a terrible memory. I've got to write everything down, which is why I'm old fashioned. I'm terrible. Look, if it came to to the intellectual stuff, then you're all winners and I'm the loser. &gt;&gt; But it's not that. It's just a life. I can't help liking Chinese food. That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. It's just there. That's it. And sister Joyce loves it too cuz I can see her giggling. She's saying amen. Preach it, brother. See what I mean? What can we do? We can't help it. So by manif, it's that simple. &gt;&gt; Him in you. Simple. He's manifest. And listen, the key is in surrender. Like brother says, what I surrendered myself. It I was only the one that was there when he does it. I was only the voice that he used. It's just what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through. You know, um, Stephen surrendered himself to the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord spoke through him. Laid it all out. &gt;&gt; Laid it all out. Peter on the day of Pentecost stood up, couldn't spell his name, and yet he can recite all the scrolls. &gt;&gt; How's that work? Cuz it wasn't him. It was just the intelligence that was in him speaking through because he surrendered himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord's good. You know, the key is in uh surrender. This is Don't worry, brother John. Brother John's glass. You know, if you want to put more of God in your glass, empty out the bit that's you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It makes more room. It's that simple. It's so simple. Just s and listen. Surrender yourself. Lord, I surren I just take it, Lord. That's what we want. Empty out. Empty out. Empty out. Let's just go to First Thessalonians if we can. 1 Thessalonians, please. And we're going to read 1 6-10. 1 Thessalonians 1 6-10, the living word made manifest. And ye became followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction. You know, you know what it says here, you became followers of us. If someone comes to you and says, listen, you got to start following me. Something's wrong. But you see, Paul was the living word. So when it says following us, they're not following the man. They're following the life that's in the man. They're following that epistle that they're reading there. And ye became followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word in in much affliction uh with joy in the Holy Ghost, so that ye were examples to all that believe in Macedonian Archa. For ye for from you sounded out the word of God, not only in Macedonian Archa, but also in every place that your faith to God, Ward, or that means towards God is spread abroad. So that we need not speak anything. For they themselves show us what manner of entering we had unto you. And how that ye turn from God from turn to God from idols to serve the living and true God and to wait for the son from heaven for his son from heaven who raised who he raised from the dead even Christ Jesus which delivered us from the wroth to come. Amen. So notice in verse 8 it says and for and for from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in my ara but also in every place that your faith uh toward God is spread abroad so that we need not speak anything. I find that quite astounding. The word was so manifested in the saints of these in the lives of these saints that not even Paul this is Paul not even Paul had to say one single word &gt;&gt; their life their life as written epistles manifesting the word it was enough it's it's your faith towards God is spread all so that we need not speak anything they were living epistles they were read of all men they were true witness of the word there were the the light was being manifested and trust me they will have been simple lives simple lives. Amen. Let's just try and turn a little corner. Let's just go to 2 Corinthians if we can. 2 Corinthians. Let's just turn a little corner. 2 Corinthians 11 1-3. Second. It says, "Would to God that ye would bear with me a little in my folly, and indeed bear with me, for I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy, for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present into you as a chasteed virgin to Christ. But I fear, lest by any means, as a serpent beguiled Eve through his subility, which was through knowledge, she was beguiled, so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; See, notice how Paul here, he says he fears that because it's so simple, &gt;&gt; we might be deceived. Look, we know the bride can't be deceived. &gt;&gt; But because it's so simple, it is so simple, it will just be looked over the top of the scripture. This scripture really brings home how simple the word of God is. It is true. Even the deepest things I find the deepest things when because we speak the same language. It's not hard to understand. &gt;&gt; We can understand these things and so you know other people when you talk to other people and and you just kind of join the dots which we take for we take for granted. You know that the prophet brought us the word and and and it's expounded since it just keeps it keeps expounding and the things we look when's the last time you sat down at a brother's meeting and discuss serpent seed. Exactly. You don't. It's just well it's like well you know it's it's a foundation it's there we don't discuss it but when you would speak to somebody about just the things which we just kind of join the dots you know Joseph the type of the Lord Jesus and all the things and all these things d join all the dots they just sit there with big eyes like how do you know all this what are you talking about what are you talking about for us it's not hard it's simple the Lord reveals himself simple &gt;&gt; you see it's so simple and in verse two it's kind of clear For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chase virgin to Christ. So we can see that we're a spouse to Christ. So when I think on this being a spouse to Christ, when I think about this, you know, the simplicity of the simplicity of things, you know, there was a there was a wedding last last weekend, Simon Emily. There was a wedding and and I I I always get kind of inspired a little bit with the weddings, but the identity of the bride is actually found in the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; So when the before the bride gets married, she's born with an earthly identity. An earthly identity which is she's given upon birth. That's it. But actually her identity lays in the bridegroom. And so in order to fulfill her full identity, to manifest all that she actually is, she has to go through a name change. &gt;&gt; She has to change her name. And so now she can manifest what is truly meant for her life and actually manifest what's the in the bridegroom. And so I thought, you know, about a marriage and I thought that how every marriage needs a token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Every marriage needs a token and it's a ring. So like you know last last weekend it was you know is there a token of this and they bring out the old ring. So every marriage needs a ring. And when I remembered this I remembered the photo. How do I do that brother? Did I just press on it? Brother Franco's going to do it. I remembered this. Every marriage needs a ring. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know when I when I thought about this a high cloud ring of mystery &gt;&gt; and I thought you know it's almost a prophetic statement that's made here in this magazine. &gt;&gt; It's the Lord himself comes down as a witness &gt;&gt; and he's witnessing something that's going to go on. The Lord himself he comes down in this ring of mystery coming down with a ring. coming down with the token. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandham says that the natural types are spiritual. &gt;&gt; And sometimes, listen, sometimes it's just that simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's that simple. &gt;&gt; Let's go Hebrews 6:13. You can leave that up there, brother Franco. It's fine. Hebrews uh what did I say? Hebrews 6:13. Let's go to Hebrews 6:13. It says, "For when God made promise to Abraham, I like this. When God made promise to Abraham, because he could not swear by no greater, he swear by himself." You know, this was so important. The covenant with Abraham was so important. this the uh unconditional covenant that the Lord came down himself and swear by himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the witness himself. It was so important that he was a witness. And we as the faith seed of Abraham with an unconditional covenant of grace, the Lord comes down himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A high cloud ring of mystery. Now then I read this part of the article. Can you click on it, brother Franco? That's it. It's a bit fuzzy for you guys, but I read this. It says, "Hovering like a giant smoker in the great cloud appeared over sunset, Flagstaff, Arizona, 5th, February 28th, and set off continuous science mystery. Watches struck the odd clouds odd shape, huge size, took pictures, mainly these four at different times from the widest cattle in the states. Dr. James McDonald, meteorologist from the Institute of Aspherent Physics in Tucson, has been accumulating the pictures using them as a basis for calculation. He said he has made a startling discovery that the cloud was at least 26 mi high 30 mi across a lot higher and bigger he says than the cloud should be the circle's too high to be made by jet planes so far Dr. come ter rockets, rockets, planes, bombs, tested by near the you don't need to know that. The point is I kind of Hey, I'm going to try something here. I don't know what I'm doing, mate. You know, my dad's from the 60s. I don't know if he used to say, "Eat your heart out." That just that just means uh I don't know what he used to say that. It just means I can do it too, I guess. Look at that. That is awesome. Praise the Lord. You know, when I read this part of the article, I thought I thought, you know, even even when it was published, it was published on the day I think that no no went to the ark. Is that right? It was published the magazine was p published this this uh specific days these things happened. Why 26 miles high and 26 miles across? Why? And I just thought, well, why 2630? And look, I'm I'm just giving a disclaimer. It it it's no doubt a coincidence. It's probably just Yeah, great. But if it's a coincidence, it's a beautiful coincidence. Let's turn to Exodus 26:30. Exodus 26:30. Now remember, this is now the first Exodus. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the first Exodus. This is an Exodus of coming out and going in. Exodus 26:30 it says, "And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle." Now, Moses has had the full um Moses had the full explanation. He's going into the he's halfway through the full explanation of how everything's got to be absolutely in detail. Says, "And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was showed thee in the mount." Okay. So when I read that I thought okay. So this is when the Lord himself comes down and gives listen the Lord comes down and gives the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To Moses &gt;&gt; the word that's going to make the way &gt;&gt; for them to be saved &gt;&gt; for them. Yeah. He's giving the word. He's giving them the way of escape. The Lord is giving them. The Lord comes down himself &gt;&gt; comes down himself and it happens on the mount. &gt;&gt; That the word is given on the mount. 26:30. It's there. I say if it's got it's a nice coincidence. &gt;&gt; So now this also on the mount it's given the Lord is giving instruction on on how the tabernacle &gt;&gt; is to be built. The tabernacle was going to be the dwelling place of God. It was going to be the place that God goes inside. And the word is given on the mount. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He did it on the mount. Now, the Old Testament tabernacle was only temporal. &gt;&gt; It just foreshadowed what was to come. It was a temporal covering. So, now we jump forward to Matthew 26:30. We've got the 26:30 again. Let's look at Matthew 26:30. Matthew 26:30. And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives. &gt;&gt; Here we have the mount. Amen. So now this is actually taking place right at the end of the Lord's earthly ministry. The word has been delivered. The word has been delivered. And now it's time for the Lord to fulfill the scriptures concerning himself, concerning all the scriptures concerning giving his life for his bride. And now he's laying his life down just like the types in the Old Testament like the doves when the when the when the two doves, the pairing mate, and you know, uh the the the doves are funny little animals. I sent a brother to a picture to brother Chad, a little video to brother Chad. I don't know if you guys saw it. It was just a fun little thing that I saw. Um there was there was a pigeon and it had died now. They're collared doves. So it's like it's a proper dove and they got like a little black ring around. You can look at it a collared dove. And we quite like him. Josh doesn't like him cuz they just coo at him all day long. For you guys it's romantic. For us it's not all day long anyway. And I always say they're saying Josh Josh. But the but the but the funny thing is with these doves is they actually mate for life, &gt;&gt; right? And it's true. &gt;&gt; And we you know in our barn we had uh in our shed shed we had two two doves that were nesting in there and one of them died. Yeah. Well for us it's like yeah big deal. But this one little dove just sat by its partner for I thought oh mate and I sent a video after two days I think to brother Chad. said, "Look, you know, just just as a type, cuz if you haven't seen that, I don't know if you guys have I don't think you have many doves, do you?" But anyway, he just sat there. It sat there and sat there and sat there for days and days and days and he died. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he died. And you know, there was nothing wrong with it. &gt;&gt; But there's these types that you can't get away from that are in nature. The Lord, this is a partnership for life. And the Lord, so these doves, the the Lord put it in the Old Testament where the one dove gets his neck ripped off and the blood gets sprinkled and then the one goes free. The male gets killed and the and and as a sacrifice and the other one can go free. And so now the Lord is laying his life down. He's about to lay his life down so that we can go free. The word. He's the word. &gt;&gt; He is the word and he's now preparing. He's giving the word the way of escape for his gentile bride. You know, the Lord had to pay for our sin because he can only marry a virgin. So, he had to pay for our sin. It was the only way. And so, now on the mount, what is going through the Lord's mind? What is he thinking about? It's you and I. &gt;&gt; You and I is the main thing on the Lord's mind. What's going on here? What's going on? It's the first step to this union taking place. It's the first step between the wedding, the uni union of Christ and his bride. But it had to be that he had to give his life. So now on the mount, we have the same thing. We have the word on the mount in the last days. Again, the Lord himself came down. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He came down in the form of the cloud. The same cloud brother says the cloud was in led the children by night and cloud and the fire by day. It's the same one. So now comes he comes in the form of a cloud and he's bringing a message again. He's bringing a message again. He's coming to unite himself with his bride. And we know that when brother where brother Brandon was when he the seven angels appeared when the cloud appeared he was on the mount. He was on a hill and you know and the cloud hung over cl flag flagstaff. Now I've never I've never seen flag staff. I think you guys have maybe seen because you got in Arizona, but I've never seen a picture of Arizona where the cloud kind of hung. Brother Franco, this is this is Flagstaff. So the cloud is it's down in the valley and on the top is the mountains. So again, we see this ring that's hovering and again coincidence. It's beautiful for me. I enjoy it. &gt;&gt; The Lord it's it's this it's this it's this ring this testimony. It's this it's it it's hanging over a mountain. Again, there at the Mount of Olives, the Lord was preparing a way for us to be united with him. He was preparing the way of life for us. He was preparing the way. And on the mount when the Lord brought the word of God to the prophet, he was preparing a way that we could live. Look, I without the look, it doesn't matter. Bride, no bride through all. If you if the the restored word didn't come back, there's no way of of of us. There's no way. The only way for us to live was to have the restored word back. &gt;&gt; And the Lord chose a mount to do it. He chose a mount to show himself. And now he there's the ring there. This this ring of mystery is there as a testimony. He comes down personally. And Moses, he came down personally onto the mount. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus, it was him personally on the Mount of Olives. And now he comes down personally once again in the form of the the cloud in the form of those uh within those seven angels. He comes down himself. He's preparing a way for his bride to be united and she'll be a wordclothed bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So notice the tabernacle in the Old Testament. It was only temporal. It was never God's intention to live in a tent forever. &gt;&gt; That was that it was never it was never it was that wasn't the plan of God. that God's end plan was to dwell in the human heart. The tabernacle of God is with men. You know, manifesting yourself, the living word, the Lord wants to manifest himself through a living bride, a many membered body. And for him to manifest, that's like we said, it's his life. It's his life. So, I like Chinese and brother Chuck likes his taking chips. That's just the life, our life being manifested. We don't have to do anything. I think says a sheep just bear bears wool. That's all there is to it. He doesn't have to think about it. It just it just grows the old wool and that's it. Brother says, "Why are we toss was so tossed about in 56 he says the heart is the abode of God." And in the Old Testament, God dwelt in his glory over the ark. The heart and the heart is the ark. God dwells in the head. Sorry, God dwells not in the head, in the heart. God is not known by theology. God is not known by a mental conception. God is known by an old-fashioned, sanctified, born-again experience that's in the human heart. Yet, men and women live a good life and love God by mental conception. But the real hiding place is in the heart, hid with Christ. And when Christ, the Holy Spirit comes into your heart. He is in you with your temperament. So, this is what we're saying. It's just, it's like I like Chinese. I'm bride. Brother Chuck likes saying chips. He's bride. And somebody else likes donuts or whatever it is. It's like you can't help it. He just we're all bride. He's living in you. But we all have the same spiritual understand the spirit the love for the Lord. We've got that same life within us with your temperament. So whatever you are in the flesh, you don't all have to start eating Chinese. You just we just have and this just explaining it simply. It's the life in us. Whatever you are, just be who you are because he is living in you. He says he is in you with your temperament and he's living his own life to his own will through you. Hallelujah. I know that sounds awful, but it's right. Christ so yielded you are that Christ speaks the kind of words that he would speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, this is where we're getting to. &gt;&gt; I was only standing there when he said it. &gt;&gt; See, this is speaking about you now. He says, I know that sounds awful, but it's right. Christ so so yielded you are that Christ speaks the kind of words he would speak he thinks the kind of thoughts that he would think through you &gt;&gt; he does the kind of works he would do through you are yielded and resting what a beautiful picture of a consecrated Christian yielded Christ working through Paul said to me to live for me to live is Christ to die is gain not me that liveth anymore but Christ that liveth in me Christ Living in the individual so surrendered Christ speaks through the lips, thinks through the mind, sees through the eyes, acts through the temperaments. Hallelujah. Then the things of the world has passed away. How can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the time? Christ has got control. Amen. You see it. You see what it is. It's Christ in you. It's Christ in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is good. &gt;&gt; As the scripture says in 1 Corinthians, let's go 1 Corinthians 6:19. It's just one verse. It says, "What know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not of your own." You see the Lord, ye are the temple of the Holy Ghost. The temple is dwelling place of God. You are the dwelling place of God. He is living in you. He's manifesting himself through his bride. He's manel manifesting himself through you. And Christ and his bride, they are united in one. When he is speaking, we all you see, we're getting this picture that when he wants to say something, he's going to use you to do it because you've surrendered yourself. You see, now this is this is the thing. Just empty yourself out and then it'll all be God. Empty it out. Empty out the bit of you. And whatever comes now, whatever comes out of there has to be God. &gt;&gt; It has to be because there ain't none of you in there. &gt;&gt; And listen, this is somewhere that I'm working on getting to. &gt;&gt; You know, we're all in the same boat, but we've all got that same desire. It's what we want. &gt;&gt; Him in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, the bride can only manifest himself him. The bride can only manifest him fully &gt;&gt; when she takes his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like the bride, her identity is in the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Our identity is not in ourselves. It's in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So for us to manifest him fully, &gt;&gt; we have to take his name. And with a marriage comes a name change. &gt;&gt; With a marriage comes a name change. Notice at the opening of the seals, right? This is now when the way was made for us to go to have that that union with Christ. When the way was made, there came a name change. &gt;&gt; You see, there came and with the name change comes a new identity. Remember the identity of the bride is laying in the bridegroom. And brother says in the first seal, we know this very well. Um it says he wouldn't he he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol. Do you understand it church? So he's addressing the we know this but brother's addressing the church as church. Do you understand it church? Congregation says oh amen. It comes forth in a symbol of a church and they know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider. This is the first seal remember. So, it's right at the beginning, right at the beginning of the of the opening of the seals and and the only the o and only to be revealed at this last day when this actual seal is broken. Broken to who? Not to Christ, but to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice, oh, how that makes me tremble. Oh, I hope that the church truly understands it. What I mean, you people. So, brother Brown's like he's gone from calling people church and he's like, and they're all sitting there. Oh, yes, yes, yes. And then he says, you people. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's talking about me. Yeah. And then he says, "I'm going to call you bridey &gt;&gt; that you'll understand it." See, he's going, "Oh, do you understand it, church?" Oh, amen. He knows they don't understand it. He's calling him church. Listen carefully. The word church has no identity. &gt;&gt; If you say, "Call somebody church," there's no identity found in the word church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You could be anything, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah, there's no identity in the word church. &gt;&gt; Bride means that you're a spouse to somebody. &gt;&gt; One person, one person. &gt;&gt; You see, so here he's calling them church, church, church. But in order that they actually understand what's going on, you know, and this is this is this is the um nice coincidence. You know the the Lord has come with this message and this is the beginning of the message and it starts with so that they understand what's going on because I've had the ring of mystery and the Lord's come down to unite himself and so that he kind of get what's going on that the Lord's come down. He's brought his word that we're going to be united and there's the ring of mystery and and it's and it's on the mount and it's on the mount and it's all but so that you understand I'm going to say I'm going to call you bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that you'll understand it. See, and they're probably still sat there like, "What are you talking?" But it just so we understand it. &gt;&gt; Now we see what's going on because there's no identity found in the word church. Identity is found in the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; So when we when we are espoused to somebody, &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; the Lord the word the word has been restored to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord's given us the Isal. He's given us the revelation. Remember, revelation's only given of the Lord. And we've recognized our day and its message. We've recognized it. We've become that message. And now we are being read of all men, the very thing that was preministered. &gt;&gt; We've accepted the word, become one with the word. The marriage has taken place. The bride has made herself ready. You know, as we come to a close gently, the ring that's such a mystery to the world, the ring that's such a mystery to the world is the bride knows what it means. &gt;&gt; We know what it means. &gt;&gt; For the bride, it's our identification. Our identification's come. We are, you are the virgin bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. We've been washed by the word. We've been cleansed. We've been brought to that position. We've been given the word. We've been we've been we've been he's put the the you know the Lord, this is why it's so we have to walk in his ways. It's half of it's about being that written epistle. But what about you? We want to please the Lord. Remember Esther when she uh came before the king, she put on the clothes that he gave her. &gt;&gt; The Lord's come down and he's clothed us &gt;&gt; and he wants to see us. If we want to be acceptable, if we want to be pleasing to the Lord, &gt;&gt; then we need to actually dress ourselves in the very thing that he gave us. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; I'm not really I've got to be honest with you, I'm not really into buying dresses for my wife. I'm so I'm I you know, I'm just not good at that sort of thing. Just give her some money, you go buy it, this that and the but if you if I would buy something for her, in fact, you know, I say, you know, you go buy yourself something nice. when she wears it, it's the thing that I've bought for her. &gt;&gt; So, she knows that she, you know, I'm pleased when because it's the thing that I've given her. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And so, the Lord's the same. The Lord is the same. The Lord loves us. And we know that the Lord's given us. Why wouldn't we want to just dress the way that he wants us to dress? Why we want to clothe ourselves in that the thing that he's given us. &gt;&gt; You know, we are being changed as brother John s that song. You know, little by little, he's changing us and we're being changed into his image. Ram says in 64 and it's our last quote here. He says now now is the Holy Spirit that we talk about. It's that Jesus Christ. Sure it is. See he is God known as God. The Holy Ghost. It ain't another God. It's the same God. Father, Son, Holy Ghost. It's not three gods. It's three attributes of the same God. See just the se the same God in three forms. You see in other words, in otherwise uh three offices like you know when he served as father then as a son god could sending coming from one who cannot be touched even to touch the mountain he had to die till we would come and handle him in flesh and now he's in you. He sanctified you with his blood that he might live in you at that day you'll know I'm in the father the father in me. I in you and you in me. See it's God above us. It's God with us. It's God in us. See and that's Christ tonight. The Holy Spirit. He is the same and you are. He's the vine. You're the branches. Have faith in him if he will identify himself tonight being among us. You know, I'm sure when he identifies himself in brother Ram services, you know, you have the prayer immediately. Oh yeah, prayer line's coming. Pray. Listen. But what about tonight? &gt;&gt; If the Lord's identifying himself tonight, &gt;&gt; where can he be found? &gt;&gt; We don't need to have a prayer line. We don't need to have a discernment to know that Lord's here. We look at our brother and sister. He's identifying himself in you. You are the word made manifest. Living epistles. Living epistles. You know, we are so fully surrendered to the Lord that it's the Lord. It's him in us. It's him speaking through you. It's him living through you. And when it's him walking in you, talking in you, then we can stand there and we can say, "I was only there when he did it." True story. If he is living through us, if there's if I can't help the way that I act and it just comes out the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, then actually I wasn't the one who did it. &gt;&gt; That's the level we need to get to. And stop thinking about discernments. &gt;&gt; That wasn't even important anyway, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; The discernments was there to point us towards the real thing, which was the word. &gt;&gt; It's the it's giving of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The Lord's good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We stand reflecting him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are standing now. We've been given the clothes. We're wearing those clothes. We can say truly we're only standing there when he does it. Sometimes, you know, you know, when when you go to a brother or a sister and they're in need, you don't even know it. So, you go to visit somebody, you just feel in your heart, I'm going to go and visit that bro. I'm going to visit that sis. It's like you go there, you talk to them, and afterwards they're like, you know, you wouldn't believe that really touched my heart. That's exactly what I need. You're like, well, did you know what you were doing? No. So, no. And it's happened to each one of us. True. True. Happened to everyone, right? Okay. So, can you take credit for that? &gt;&gt; No. No. And how listen, how many people I Well, you see, I I dreamed a dream like &gt;&gt; No. No. Truly. So, if you go somewhere, you talk to them &gt;&gt; and how many times does it happen? Oh, do you know that really that's exactly what I needed? How did you know? Oh, brother Chad's preaching. It's like, mate, that's exactly what I'm going through. That's answered my questions. Can he take any credit for that? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. No. What is it? It's the the Lord manifesting himself through your room is standing there. You see, this is the thing now. What we need to realize, guys. You know, it's not hard for us to believe the prophet, he's part of the bride. He's the, you know, that's not hard for us to believe. What's hard for us to believe is that we're part of that same category, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He was only standing there when the Lord worked through him. And it might be a little bit lesser in our eyes. It might be a little bit more simple &gt;&gt; in our eyes because we don't have all the gifts. And but when the Lord uses you, it's the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's him working through you. Listen, be encouraged. Be encouraged because I know each and every one of you has happened. You've gone to see somebody. You've spoken to somebody. You maybe sent a text. You sent some you some way of reaching out to somebody and they've written about that's just what I needed. You were only sending there when you flicked the text. &gt;&gt; When he did it, &gt;&gt; you were only standing there. He was working through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the Lord gets full preeminence in his bride, it will be literally listen carefully. When the Lord gets full preeminence in his bride, it will be the same as when the Lord stood there and said, &gt;&gt; "Speak the word." &gt;&gt; You see me, you see the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus stood there and said, "You see me, you see the father." What's he saying? You see, you see the same thing. So now actually when the bride has full preeminence and you are the written epistle, then basically when people see me, they see this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you see me, you see the word. When you see me, you see the father. It's the same thing. I at that day, I in you, you in me. And it's the word. It's exactly right, brother. It's the word speaking through you. You can't help it. It just comes out. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see me, you see Listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you see me, you see the word that was preached in the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; You see the word that the prophet preached. When you see me, &gt;&gt; we are no longer a church. Yeah, &gt;&gt; brother. Brother Bill brother John, we are no longer a church. Musician, sorry. &gt;&gt; Not used to that one. We are no longer a church. A church does not have an identity. &gt;&gt; Bride means that you have an identity. Bride means actually if you're a bride, it means that someone's chosen you. Right? &gt;&gt; It means that you belong to somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are written epistles. We are true witnesses. We are not that light, but we are reflecting that light. &gt;&gt; We are witnesses of that light. We are the living word manifested for this day. &gt;&gt; In those days, the saints were what Paul preached. They were the living epistles of what Paul preached. In this day, we are the living epistles of what the prophets preached. Let's just stand together and pray. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, help us. We pray, Lord, so everywhere with thoughts, Lord Jesus. But we just pray, Lord, that something's just anchored, Lord. We're just thankful, Lord, that Lord, you do things in a certain way. You hide yourself. You reveal yourself in simplicity, Lord Jesus. We're just so thankful, Lord. We are so simple and sometimes we we we have complexes because we're too simple, Lord. Lord Jesus, you're in the symbol. Lord Jesus, I can use an example about you drinking a glass of water or having Chinese. Lord, the prophet stood there and said about children chewing bicycle tires off or pedals. And Lord, it's simplicity. It's always simplicity. Lord, you reveal the deepest things in simplicity. And Lord, we all get complexes about simple. Help us, Lord, to humble ourselves down to just simplify, to make ourselves humble, Lord, to simple be simple and to accept the way that you've made us. You've made us this way, Lord. We're not stupid. We are not um we're not ignorant, Lord Jesus. You've shown us the way, Lord. We are so thankful, Lord. Help us, Lord. We pray. Bless each and every heart, Lord Jesus. Bless brother Chad as he's traveling. Just restore strength to him and just encourage him. We pray, Lord. Encourage each and everyone, Lord. Help us, Lord Jesus, to identify with the position that you've called us to. You have made us living representatives of you, Lord. Help us, Lord, to live up to that, Lord Jesus. We're thankful, Lord Jesus, for the identity that you've given to us, Lord. You've shown us who we are, where we are. Lord Jesus, we are so thankful. We bless your name. We love you, Lord Jesus. And we just commit the rest of the service to you, Lord Jesus. Bless us now as we go. Love you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, saints.
