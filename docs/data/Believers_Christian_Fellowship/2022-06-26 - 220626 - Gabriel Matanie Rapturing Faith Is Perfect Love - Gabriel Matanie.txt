around the revealed world not because a man called us but because we have heard from our theophany so we ask you to take the bread and break it anoint my lips my mind my heart may you speak to me and listen to the brothers and sisters let it be christ in all in in all we commit the service in your hands take every spirit under your control help me to express myself even you can anoint the ears of the of of the people to understand the thought what what you laid in my heart to share we are in we know we don't have anything new or it is the same message prophesied again so we commit the service in your hands and let it be something said for your glory for your honor and for the benefit of your bride we ask all of this in the name of the lord jesus christ and let the bride say amen amen matthew 17 from verse 1 amen if i if i will say something that is not well understood i told to brother chair that he have 51 weeks to to correct it yes matthew 17 chapter one and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john faith hope and love his brother and bring them up into the into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and this raymond was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias take talking with him then answering peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for tea and one for moses one for elias while he had speak behold the bright cloud overshadow with them and behold the voice out of the cloud we said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased here ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid amen and also i want to read from hebrew chapter 5 hebrew chapter 5 from verse 7 [Music] yes who in the days of his flesh when he had offered off prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he field through he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him hebrew chapter 2 verse 10 for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect truth sufferings for both he the sanctified and they who are sanctified are echad are one amen may the lord has a blessing for the reading of the world we can take our seats while i am going to stand amen i rely on the yeah so we want to share in this morning the thought that the lord placed in my heart rapturing faith perfect love rapturing faith perfect love amen this is election and revelation faith is revelation perfect revelation so we want to read at the beginning a quote from the midnight crime amen and the prophet said here you see he himself suffered he speaks about jesus he learned obedience by the sick now when we read about it here jesus already had the holy ghost baptism jesus was baptized with the holy ghost so he had to learn obedience by things he suffered he was actually made perfect not by the holy ghost baptism but by the things that he suffered hebrew 5 8 9 through he were a son he had learned he obedience we speak about jesus here he had to learn learn obedience he had to learn obedience my by the things which he suffered and being murdered made perfect he was made perfect he was not perfect when he get the holy ghost he became he was made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of jesus jesus needed a character was perfected he had a character that needed to be perfected and according to paul he has left his church a measure of suffering he was a striker she has to be two and according to paul he has left his church of messers that they too but their revelation in god but their faith in god while suffering for him will come to a place of perfection why did he want this my brethren counted all joy when he fall into diverse temptation knowing this that the trying of your revelation the triangle of your faith work with patience but let patience have her perfect work and he may be perfect and tired wanting nothing amen blessed be the name of the lord so we want to to dig a little bit if we want to don't be in tribulation you need to dig deeper this is what prophet said he's a quote amen we believe coach so after six days after six days that means pay attention it was the seven days in the in luke 9 28 i like number 28 28 time of life when we can receive seed after 28 day verse 28 especially for us he said according about an eight days so after six days about and days this is like time blending with eternity and he lifted up his hand and swear of himself it will be no more time we are not busy with the flesh now there's no more time is eternity blending coming in it's something be in between two dimension is something between two words amen and the same the same the same thing we fi we find in mark nine he speaks about the same event when maybe i i will open in mark chapter 9 can you follow me say amen hallelujah and i know i'm not preaching to me only verily i say unto you that there be some of them they stand here which shall not taste the death till you have been seen the kingdom of god he was speaking about this mount this event come with power this is the dynamics in in greek is dynamics so this this event was just read it is the the transfiguration its power what we have we need witnesses witnesses in this generation brought power has power in it the power of revelation amen and the brother brown said first quote now i do not know that these ministers behind me may be wondering because in time it was showing the second coming of christ so he was speaking about this event on the mount it was after six days about eight days in the seven churches it jesus went on the top of a mountain and he said it was a type it was a shadow a reality has to come it is here it was showing the second coming of christ that's the real way to approach it for it show it first jesus glorified second message to the jews first jesus glorified jesus is not anymore in his fleshly body he is in a glorified condition so second the message to the jews which will be the two prophets of revelation moses said elijah so we found him here going up to the mountain as we call it month of transfiguration i will i always like to look at it in the real sense is a real sense what happened then was a shadow but what we live today is the real sense that it is wrote in that and what all my ministering brothers approach it as a type of the second coming of christ and that is true that is true so we want to approach it in the real sense in the real sense jesus took his disciples on a great mountain mount aboard tabor tavor means clarifying explaining he took his disciple but said when you find the name in the bible you stop and look at what is what is about and jesus was transfigured metamorpho changes his form his face shine as the sun just like in revelation 10. hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the lord and when the real sense came revelation 10. the mighty angel came down amen revelation chapter 10 when when the mighty angel came down it was the time when the seventh angel was on earth amen hallelujah and revelation chapter 10 7 says but in the days of the voice the voice is a person the same voice that walk in the garden of eden the same voice returned back a left half alpha an omega a person a voice that walk of the seventh angel so the voice is the person that's why we believe message is christ he is the person hallelujah the mystery of god god has a mystery god has a mystery you are his mystery as he declared so when he is about to sound when he is is the is the seventh this is the gospel trumpet this is a uh this is the message not the year of preparation but the message the message is revelation 10. the simple 10 vision seven thunders can you say praise the lord hallelujah amen so when this angel i saw mighty angel we have seen it too by the revelation came down from heaven he was closed with a cloud praise god we i already put in my bible 28 february 1963 this is absolutely absolutely hallelujah brother brown said in quote number two but old elijah was the voice of god in that day he sure was the very type of the voice of god as the first coming of christ it will be the type of the voice in the same second coming of christ again according to the scriptures i am your brother by the grace of god but when the angel of the lord moves down it becomes then a voice of god to you oh if i offended you by saying that forgive me but i am god voice to you that was under inspiration blessed be the name of the lord so he came down and he when he came down he cried with a loud voice cry midnight cry it was matthew 25 behold the bridegroom is here and my ministry is to declare there that he is here it is first destination thessalonians 4 16 the lord himself shall i can say head descended from heaven hallelujah now now you notice in the seventh seal he said on the opening of the seventh seal is a three-four mystery is the mystery of the seven thunders the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery it will be right at the coming of christ because because christ said no one knew when he will return look where the voices was the thunders not in heaven on earth the thunders never uttered from heaven they uttered from the earth what was those standards the voices of the seven angels the seven ministers the seven spirits declaring his presence the ten vision genesis 18 everything happened in a tent sarah 10 10 vision because it was the uniting time as in the days of sodom the prophet said watch close in the days of sodom so will be the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed no more as a church the bride is called in that day the son of man will be revealed to join the church and the head the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down in the form of william branham in the form of a prophet but i can say it openly now because it's plainly it's not anymore something in human flesh and he did it to unite the two together the church has to be the world because he is the world and the two unites together it will take the manifestation the revealing of the son of man see it's son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his words so real that he will unite the church and him as one the bride then she'll go home [Music] when she will know her position not when you know william branham position oh one day she will knew it then the rapture will go because the rapture is here now now it's coming the the dessert she's already united we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage [Music] feel your flesh he came down to feel my flesh he came down to feel your flesh the marriage is in the in you the circle is in your heart the world became flesh and the flesh became bigger became word all of the flesh of the mighty man cause the marriage of the lamb has come i can say this day this scripture is fulfilled let us be happy and rejoice we are at the marriage of the lord hallelujah this is my revival but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the world here unites with the person and they too became one manifest the son of man again the son of man so the son of man is still continuing in your form the world and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the world the child the church does the same thing can you say praise the lord so we are already united with who with the world the spoken word that's why i was i was very pleased when i saw brother hickerson testimony 90 years world he said they asked him brother hickerson what is the message for you i remember that old brother almost coming from the seed he said brother every fiber of my body i can say the same thing i am a prisoner of the message the message is controlling my life controlling my mind my decision my soul i could do nothing i am a prisoner of the message [Applause] that's why we are not only the bride but we are the wife because we received we had intimacy with the spoken word original sin we are pregnant by the message we are the wise virgins and we don't have oil to give i am not too good to share oil i filled my vessel with the anointed world and anything is running by oil and even the bride is running by oil which is the message which is the anointed world i somebody say i feel my vessel i filled my vessel with the message of the hour you cannot be so if you brother brown said if you are filled with the world you are with the spirit you are filled with the world don't show me how many demonstrations somebody can do show me how much message they have when they wash their teeth yes in in the secret chambers so it was the mystery of the returning of the pillar of fire the prophet said here in the west in he said quote number five he said they refused to be a part of other part of the world they want to abide in laodicea they want to still to be pentecostals good for them they refused to be a further part of that world they refuse to having spiritual or intimate relationship to become pregnant with the spoken word when the pillar of fire they turned it back but brown said speaking in sirs what time it is it is the science of the answer he said one of the mysteries is the returning of the pillar of fire that's the thing that's supposed to take place and we see it how we could go on naming the mysteries seeing that pillar of fire that led the children of israel the same one that struck down paul on his road to damascus and the same one coming with the same power this is the power of resurrection all the power was restored to the church revealing the same word blessed be the name of the lord the third exodus first exodus it was a rehearsal first exodus was nothing as you see the pentecost was not a christian feast it was a jewish feast they call it sukkot the first pentecost is is sorry is shaport shavuot means the feast of the weeks seven churches seven shabbat counting the omer every day every age people coming to maturity but in the 50s days which was the eighth day it was the wheat harvest when the wheat will come to maturity it was the feast the fulfillment of the first or the feast of the first fruits the first fruits started counting after the passover day the next day morning in the day of resurrection they the the first fruits the feast habicream in hebrew started to count and at the end of it they have to bring the fruits to the temple the two lambs and the two love breads from the jews and gentiles to be lifted up one lamb from the jews one lamp from the gentiles pentecost the first pentecost the first feast of shavuot was at the mount of sanay the mount of sanay it was the marriage of the of the lord with israel it is the same mount sinai have this the name of horeb means sword also have the root of korev means fire it's exactly the same mountain on the other side on this side is thorns torn mountain torn torn bush sufferings desert cinna cinna i but the other hand on the other side it it is the same mountain but have another name whorev had the split rock actually it was the marriage feast it was the time when israel became a nation for 49 days they would eat barley but in the 50s days they would eat bread it was an elevation from the carnality to the spirit it was another dimension actually the marriage the jewish marriage has several steps seven seven stage stages and the last stage is stage the seventh one have two ketubah the contra the marriage himself under the canopy until the cloud and niswin means coming from nasa nasa you have nasa here mean to lift up a contract when the groom gives a ring a cloud to the bride a nisswin is when the groom take his bride in a room from eight minutes they call it they became one where when all the guests are there together it is the eighth step the eighth stage it is revelation eight they have to come in a closet in the room and they have to consume the marriage in silence about half an hour 28 minutes revelation 8 7 seal it is not a public show you don't want a numeric to be too many people around you want to be alone christ want to be alone it will not be a public show first pentecost the pillar of fire came down to unite himself with the people i want i will read you from the testimony of the rabbis the midrash speaks of the flames of fire which came down to each individual individual at sinai on the occasion of the giving of the torah the children of israel not only heard the lord's voice actually they saw the sounds wave as they emerged from the lord's mouth they could visualize them as a fiery substance each commandment that the lord left the lord mouse traveled around the entire entire camp and they came came back to every jew individually so that was the first exit the first marriage the first feast of pentecost we just have now the second pentecost of mount zion mount zion was on the upper what happened with israel they failed they lost their first love they could not continue battleground said the second exodus the second day of pentecost did you notice the quote number eight in the day of pentecost what a great thing we have there god who led the children of israel through the wilderness he that great pillar of fire and on the day of pentecost the great fire felt and divided itself among the people for me to live is christ but abram said hallelujah we can say hallelujah i believe that the same god that fell on the day of pentecost upon his church as a pillar of fire divided himself with cloven towns among his people is here brethren said tonight i can say this morning is the same god that he was then he is today with the same holy ghost blessed be the name of the lord any time when we had a pentecost he came down with a book and the prophet was in the land now the real the real pentecost it was not sinai not even zion because they lost their first love they felt the world test now we have another mountain sunset he came down with the book that book was not anymore commandments but was the marriage certificate and my name and your name was written right there seven two changes ended and the marriage has come and the christ came down actually he is here we are not called by a man we are individually called but the christ himself by the king theophany calling you a tiopani it's an invisible union what is the attraction of the mountain what happened on mount sunset god confirming his word all is that all this noise about god fulfilling his promised world revelation 1-7 hallelujah and god of heaven promises the evening evening time we have evening lights you are an evening light three years ago this mystery was a prophecy now it's history it's past promise is fulfilled hallelujah the marriage of the lamp has come and now i believe she is ready to strike that final climbers to bring forth a faith or revelation that will rapture the church into glory and she is lying or laying in these messages we are really at the end time we have talked about and everything but the thing that moved up on us now here is one that's right but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation it's revealed to her what is revealed to her the message didn't made us bright just revealed what always have been that's the revelation the true bride of christ will wait for the revelation of the rapture rapturing faith rapturing revelation through identity this is our true identity the three day today actually the son of man didn't came to bring faith he came to find faith brother brown said in faith he said faith is a subconscious thing he said faith is on subconscious things lady faith is not a mental act it's something that that you subconsciously do it people try to look to their intellect for faith when faith doesn't let day reason lay there faith lays in the soul it is not something that i manufacture think about eno in genesis chapter 5 verse 24 when enoch is our type enoch walked with god how he walked with god he walked with the world and he says here and he was not when i walk with the world you cannot find me anymore you cannot find gabriel anymore because i walk with the spoken word actually and then and the verse continue because god took him that the that word took him isla means married him enoch what is hanok what is enoch teaching teaching walk with god what is god i left out in the beginning elohim are left out in the beginning 28 words 28 letters first verse of the bible seven words 28 letters the fourth one it's a word nobody translated the first letter of the hebrew alphabet and the last one the greek translated in alpha in omega roman in a and z but actually this is a jewish bible it's a hebrew language and jesus said in the book of revelation i am alpha in omega in the beginning created god i left out in the beginning created god the word and eno walked with the world and he was not anymore god married him when married him after his character was molded after he was formed after he passed the world test abraham the same abraham father abraham moshe moses the teacher let's look at jesus jesus was anointed at jordan jordan means separation means death you get the holy ghost when you decide to die when you make a full surrender when you just have a clear-cut decision that you are going to follow the doctrine of this message the holy ghost just fell on you and you will have a holy ghost baptism without sensation because in seoul you don't have feelings you don't have senses i get the holy ghost with the pentecost in in my spirit and in my flesh i could speak i still speak in tongues i still had a lot of i had a lot of manifestation but i didn't have the baptisms with the holy ghost in my soul till one day i was it was midnight and my my wife translating me the message from hungarian the mark of the beast so i i stood up and i say from this day on i am going to follow the doctrine of this man then my soul changed so i know when i what is what means to to have the the mystery is a mystery even for many you know this is so so it was because it the prophet said is a mystery of the holy ghost without sensation by the person of jesus christ who is the person the word the anointed word jesus is the word in flesh jesus is the manifested word is christ anointed a flesh hallelujah so jesus was anointed jesus was baptized with the holy ghost as jordan you know that jesus the prophet said was fighting with himself if he is the world if jesus was fighting with himself how much we have to fight with ourself then jesus was adopted month of transfiguration this was his adoption what happened after adoption trials testings problems because the world has to be tested after he fulfilled all the righteousness after he applied all the world all the requirements then father said this is my beloved son this is my beloved daughter after he walked with the world after he submitted himself to the pillar of fire that was in him then god said this is my beloved son and then he need to be proven because i am divine the seventh i am of john the last the seventh one is i am divine i am the root you are the branches every branches they don't bring through it cut it they don't come to church anymore not even try to bring them back because you are not you are cutting them god is cutting them but those who bring fruit he purchased more problem more trials to bring more fruit that was good to become perfect look at the prophet and then jesus was was raptured after that his character was molded by suffering by testing it is it will be too nice to be raptured in this condition hallelujah we have a good music good atmosphere feel the light a good atmosphere many people good atmosphere the world brother brown said the last test that the bride has to face is the world test we need to be proven that we are the real adopted brother branham was baptized with the holy ghost he was adopted in the cloud when the lord took him in the club it was his adoption then look what happened in his ministry they rejected he was rejected by all and he has to stay alone and the bride has to come to a place i have to come to a place i have to stay alone and you have to stay alone with him amen you have to step in the vision and after his character was molded perfect love projected i put here some because the lord walked me three o'clock in the morning and he was going in my head back and forth and he was telling me these things and then then i could see it is right there in the message and then he the holy spirit reminded me about a situation this is the sermon the reproach for the cause of the world the reproach 23. baptism is the holy ghost then and the holy spirit he was in a in a church and somebody did something very bad they misbehave in the presence of the lord and the holy spirit told him they are in your hands they mistreat you they are jealous on you they speak mean against you they are in your hands now they mess up your life he makes you suffer you he plays church he looks different but when he come home he's different now you have the spoken word you have the power to speak them out of existence they are in your hands now what you will do with them there was a holy hush everybody so deadly quiet oh god what must i do then i remember if he hadn't been the warning of the holy spirit two days before i said i forgive you now that was what he wanted me because after a while brother after all barbara said i've been guilty maybe not of that but guilty and guilty of the least is of the whole you see how humble the real revelation brings humbleness so i said i forgive you and there is the witnesses sitting right in the holy spirit fell through so the prophet has to be his character has to be formed first like hattie right like hated the right her character has to be molded blessed be the name of the lord perfect perfect love then the prophet was raptured so i went to give you the pattern now how the sins goes baptism is the holy ghost adoption is a public declaration then character has to be formed through trials and temptation to be proved and then perfect love and then rapture perfect love look at israel baptized in the water baptized with with the cloud which was the baptist was the holy ghost then the lord allowed them in the wilderness 40 years to be proven what is really in their heart israel felt look at church at the church baptized with the holy ghost she lost first love tried by the world rejected him but this bride was baptized in his name filled with the holy ghost adopted when we have been adopted when the prophet was talking in the crowd the prophet said all of us we have a representation there brother brown said i am a part of that bride so when he was adopted we have been adopted in the hall with the cloud then test her heart is tested by the world than the rapture so our pentecost is revelation 10 7 and now we are in the time of character now i'm coming to closing as he being the groom the bride has to come forward because it's part of him she's the esther she have half half of the kingdom not william branham get half of the kingdom it is not land to share it is power authority spoken word power deity and it only can be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelation any other spoke of the bride it can only manifest if he does something different than the groom it is in the bride she is flesh of his flesh born of his life of his life power of his power she is him a man and woman are one woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist holy ghost you holy ghost people you holy ghost people you feminist spirit you feminist part of logos embodied today what do you say about yourself what shall i tell them who sent us to you they asked john the baptist what do you say about yourself what do you say about yourself it is written in the scroll of the book the flesh of his side both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him put together hmm we are coming to our conclusion as the eternal lord was god manifested in the sun in jesus dwelt the fullness of god that bodily the eternal one was father manifested in flesh thereby gaining the title of a son even so we somebody said even so this is this is this is hard even so i am so happy i just behave because i will run because i i see it even so me eternal in his thoughts in my turn became many members spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those eternal thoughts real and eternal you you real you is real when he saw you actually we are not only predestinated judah was predestinated the first grace that was given to us is election he tore up himself he pulled the part of himself and place it in your heart this is what we are who don't believe it is not a part of the drama because this is rapturing revelation hallelujah he brought your identity that's why when you saw the pillar of fire you saw you were origin when you saw the cry the cloud you recognize it because you have been teached by the father you have been with him from the beginning you have heard from god this is really you these eternal souls tell to somebody eternal salt manifested in flesh are the sons of god we did not become saved by rebirth we were seed only the elect can be born because we were seed we could be quickened and this is the holy ghost baptism hallelujah unless that is constructed by god it won't stand no denomination alex is this constructed by god construction here will not stand it has to come the way god build it it can't come any other way not creed not by joining not by this not by sensations it's got to come by the way of the cross it's got to come by the way of the blood is god to come and be filled with the holy ghost is god to be holy ghost material what he's saying here holy ghost my what is this message think about holy ghost material and holy ghost materials makes holy ghost people holy ghost people muslim how are you bockertov good morning peace be unto you always well it's already revealed hallelujah amen so brad has her adoption and he said this is my beloved bride what's next character forming in the oven of the suffering he's looking for her character the character of christ how was formed by suffering not by a lot of noise and jumping and running by be tested by the world it is not just joining church sunday sings or seeing very nice as the lord god said the prophet push play or it is not it is not healing it is not listening it's healing they listen but they know they don't hear because everything the fruits has to be his life perfect love perfect love is not manifested when we eat together it's not manifested when we are agreeing when everybody says nice things about me perfect love manifest in a different condition [Music] he chooses a bride to reflect his character the modern churches of today certainly the misses of course they have to give something else to the people you know they have to sell this wonderful experiences sunday monday we are different seems to be the truth he is looking for the day for that bride to be formed hebrew 38 not revelation 3 8 this is different jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever just exactly like it was like he was it's got to be his the same flesh some bones on spin everything and them too then became one until the church became dead they are not one this is chosen of a bride the baptist people in los angeles leave the church because we the only things we know we need to go to do good deeds if we we do good deeds we are bright we are we don't do good deeds we are not bright so this man is telling us here that we need to have a character as jesus christ to be formed make no sense for the denomination for us makes sense hallelujah the character of him the world for this age must be molded she must be molded like he is character is a victory not a gift a man without character can reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne to the same basis that he overcome and it's it's set down at his father throne we have to overcome and sit with him i'm closing and i'm not lying perfect love perfect faith perfect knowledge this is next not a faith but perfect faith build it up in here watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect world with a sharper than two-edged sword discerning of the thoughts of the heart we are coming now to the perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture that's that's holding it away right now it's waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith looking for it it means a lot of shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of god [Music] blessed be the name of the lord are you happy this morning he left his church a measure of suffering by their faith in god while suffering for him will come to a place of perfection amen this is where we are going to first he called us because he called us and because we are son he gave us the baptism with the holy ghost that make us to receive the word you cannot deceive the whole the world what we believe without the holy ghost it's impossible amen is to touch and then you are adopted when you are adopted god change your appeal you look different speak different think different and then testing and trials come he is molding your character and after your character is molded god forgive them they don't know what they are doing perfect love hallelujah perfect love can i say thus says the lord nothing will bring us there only perfect let us stand by himself are you happy in this morning we are already adopted we are already baptized with the holy ghost with our sensation in our soul because it's a promise we don't deserve it we cannot be the so good that we deserve to be baptized with the holy ghost because we were sons he gave us the holy ghost what is the evidence i can believe such a strange message and then i have such a lot of problems and problems and the devil is telling me is telling you you are not because you you should be so good nice husband you should be so nice mother it's it's just god is perfecting us you must have perfect revelation if you want you have more proofs that we are not that you are 90 of our experiences are negative so if you go about sensation i am bright only in the church when i go home gracious heavenly father hallelujah we thank you for the message of doubt our bridegroom our husband we thank you that your place is something in our heart you baptize that with the holy ghost to stand in the process of formation of molding our character how can we do it without the holy ghost how can we follow the message how can we stay in those these trials and this and the age and what we see all around us it's impossible thank you for what you already placed in us and the holy ghost you give us thank you that we can identify ourselves with the coming of the mighty angel thank you that when the perfect love is projected something is going to happen it's a secret going away is a love affair from the giving beginning to the end is only love between the world [Music] and the bright world lord we are so thankful and we commit ourself in your hands let us shine because let us let us rejoice because our light has come growth darkness covered earth but our telephone our light our club cloventon our tongue of fire has come bless this congregation bless the pastor reward them from the welcome we felt he here lord keep us under your word your blood let us walk in the light to have access to the life we commit us in your hand for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen the word is wonderful is it not the man you see brother gabrielle doesn't know what we've been preaching we haven't discussed it at all we just got in late last night and you can see god continuing in the same thought what is it after he's after his reflection in her and that's what i want to be amen with all that's in me i want it but no matter how bad i want it i cannot produce it myself it's something i have to surrender to that he'll come and produce himself let's sing brother ben from glory to glory peace [Music] and image to perfect in me the love of god shown to the world for he's changing changing me from earthly things to the heavenly dislikeness an image to perfect in me the love of god shown to the world o from glory to glory he's changing me he's changing me changing me his [Music] [Applause] for he's changing changing me from earthly things to the heavenly dislikeness and image to perfecting me amen i was thinking as our brother was preaching that [Music] god knows how to extract the perfume out of the rose and it would take some pressure and under the pressure the fragrance is unleashed and there's there's a life of christ on the inside but many times it takes those negative circumstances to bring the right reaction out of us that'll display the life of christ we're so many times we don't want the negative we don't want the negative we don't want the trial we don't want the pressure i mean i spent all my time trying to pray away the pressure pray away the troubles and and escape them all but those are the very things god's using the pres to test the bride to whether or not she'll stay with the word and when she chooses the word over herself and a surrender to his will the fragrance becomes comes out the character comes out amen so we thank god for all things amen thank him for what he's doing and now we understand why life is not meant to be easy brother baby said it's not easy he said it wasn't meant to be easy it was meant for our perfection amen amen i thank god for that i thank god that he'd given us eyes to see or we would be so confused about our own lives but he's given us eyes to see that we'll understand even our daily life the prophet the message has explained to us amen god bless you and remember to keep praying for brother gabriel and his wife as they travel a little bit more in the united states and head back home may god bless him i sure appreciate the brother's vision of the message and his heart for the word amen let's bow our heads and thank the lord lord jesus we thank you for your word lord god you're constantly painting the picture so that we can see lord god we come into this world with spiritual amnesia but you're taking the word to break our amnesia so that we will understand who we are and what it is you're trying to accomplish in our lives in this day god you've taken it from book form and you're making it living form not just in someone else but in us lord you want this word to live god we want to yield ourselves to you and surrender in a greater way that you might have your way in our lives and you might display your very life in these vessels of clay well we thank you for our brother lord we pray that you bless him and strengthen him and restore to him all that he's given out and bless him lord is it as he travels more in the united states and goes home next week i pray that he'd go home blessed lord and that he would go home encouraged that you
