TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but we're going to find out is noah built this ship god is a master craftsman there's not a human engineer can out engineer god and god knew exactly how high the waves would be he knew how much rain would fall he knew what course the ship would have to take he knew he knew everything that was going to have to happen he knew how many animals would have to hold how much food it was going to have to hold like can you imagine god says okay i'm going to take two of every kind of unclean beasts seven pairs of every uh clean beast we're going to keep them of every kind we're going to put them in the ark gotta have enough food and provisions and i'm not gonna tell you how long but just have lots of food and provisions and figure it out i would be like one two three how many animals how many square foot per an animal how much food does each species eat i mean what kind of food how much food what quantities we do see god told him all that because god already had it all figured out and friends i'll tell you today god's got it all figured out he sent a prophet he doesn't always give us the explanation of why he just tells us the truth he shows us in the word we take the word we don't always know why but we know it's got to be this way so many times people question what the prophet said because they don't clearly see it they don't clearly understand it and then they want to regulate it to the prophet's opinion because if i regulate it to the prophet's opinion i can use my reasoning on the word amen and i can still accomplish my own lusts but i'm telling you if the prophet is telling us something over and over and over again and he's telling us it's the word and he telling us god it doesn't you know what it doesn't even matter if you can piece it together in the bible that's a vindicated prophet of god amen i would say god just help me lord help me to obey help me to be simple-minded enough of a farmer and a shepherd and not an engineer or theologian where i can just take what he said and say be it unto me lord let me obey that with all of my heart if that's the way you want me to act if that's the way you want me to address is this what you say about marriage and divorces this is how we're supposed to raise children if this is how we're supposed to conduct church if this is who qualifies for this position and this who qualifies for that amen i'm going to say amen lord help us to do it exactly the way you said do it
