and thank you for all that you do for your families for all of us I was uh meditating this morning on what the comment brother Brandon made he said motherhood is the backbone of the nation so when you break motherhood you've broke the nation and and that statement is really interesting because the backbone in our body is what links everything together everything is connected by the backbone and that's what our mothers are in our families they are the connecting to connect everything not the headship but the connection of everything and so I thought praise the Lord that's such a good analogy brother bom always has the best amen and so we just thank we thank God for Godly sisters who will yield theirselves give up their lives to take the office of mother and what a privilege it is but it's a it's an office of privilege but it's also an office of sacrifice and we want to say God bless you for your sacrifice and we know without you amen if it's the backbone of a Nation it's the backbone of the family it's also the backbone of the families in the church and so we are all stronger because of Godly mothers and so we just want to say God bless you today and pray that God blesses you with a wonderful wonderful day I know it's sometimes hard because some have lost their mothers and sister Jenny recently lost her mother so it's it's a time of rejoicing and it's a happy time but there's also loss as well so we want to remember the wine Gardner family uh today as well we'll be praying for Sister Jenny and your family may the Lord bless you and you know not everybody's had the privilege of being a mother but if God has granted you that privilege just thank him for it and continue to give your life for it one thing's for sure we all had the privilege of having a mother and that's how God saw fit to bring us in this life and so we're thankful we all have something to celebrate amen also want to thank brother Tom for that song I really enjoyed the verse I had never heard the verses before and that last verse especially really spoke to me amen I thought that was wonderful also want to remind you the weekend meetings coming up this weekend brother Alistair will be coming in this week and uh we won't be I want to remind you we won't be having service Wednesday night we'll be having the youth service in the fellowship hall Thursday so that'll start everything in the fellowship hall Thursday at 700 p.m. with the youth then we'll be in here Friday at 700 p.m. Saturday morning will be the men's fellowship breakfast and Saturday evening at 6:30 p.m. we're going to go 30 minutes earlier here as well and then the regular service time at 10:30 Sunday morning so we pray that you'll be able to make it to all the services I'm I'm sure it'll be quite a blessing and if you could be in prayer this week that God will just move every hindrance out of the way God will move in brother Alistair with clear inspiration Direction and God will move on our hearts to come with hearts with expectation to receive from him so I'm looking forward to that amen also want to uh welcome all the visitors that are here but a special welcome to brother woodro and sister Ruby in the back there God bless you it's good to have you here brother woodro and sister Ruby were baptized several weeks ago before one of the uh Bible studies in home county so they made quite a journey over God bless you today for that amen it's good to have you amen as you know we have brother Nester Espanola here and his wife Hannah God bless you Sister Hannah it's good to have them back again brother Nester has been such a good friend of mine for so so long and a good friend to many here in the assembly and we just look forward to having him I've been looking forward to today I woke up this morning excited to hear the word amen because you know I'll be in my favorite seat pulling on the word so let's all get excited to hear the word of God in pool you know there's a I I know because of the fellowship I've had with my brother Nestor I know that God has used him in the ministry for so long and he's put a lot in that brother and I know that I can get more if I pull a little bit amen so let's all pull together and see how much we can get out of our brother today and receive the word amen as God speaks the word and it strikes you and and you catch it and you're like I see it I got it respond nod your head raise your hand say amen amen so amen so he knows you got it so he can go to the next one amen he got that we'll go to the next one and let's just receive the word I really

things and so I just want him to know I love you brother God bless you I love you we want him to come and relax and take his Liberty and move as the Lord leads him and we want God to speak through that vessel of clay to our hearts amen let's all stand together we're going to invite our brother to come with a song brother Ben you have a song Oh only be [Music] ho we all things are possible only

Lord God bless your people bless the Lord in Jesus name I pray amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah so before we sit let's read the scripture amen okay that's it see I want to speak about we are the branches and and I give it the subtitle of what she is it says here in John 15 verse 5 I am the way I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without without me he can do nothing next verse in Revelation 10 verse 7 to1 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophet and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth out sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it w and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was beer and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nation and tongues and Kings may the Lord had the blessing from the reading of the scripture you all may be seated praise the lord it's good to be in the house of the Lord I'm always uh glad the Lord make me a way to come here so I'm in Canada this time and this is my last leg so but next week I'll be going to Los Angeles and fly back home praise God so this is the first time that I I only stay in one Church in the in us and I like this church okay because CH you heard him said the lobby praise the Lord hallelujah see so last time last year when I came here so I preach about the promised rain and the promised light and then condemnation by representation so I wanted to wrap it up all praise God see H Allelujah so in that way you will understand uh you know um like like like the scriptures said you know and if we believe that uh John you know uh we always use John the Beloved in the Book of Revelation we type we type we type him uh in the church uh in the ages also as a bride you know so if praise God see so John need to eat the books but you need to eat it open not close Okay then once you ate it then you are commanded to prophesy again okay praise God see John was not commanded to preach he was proph he was commanded to prophesy okay praise the Lord hallelujah see now before we go on it says here see it says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts see if the Holy Spirit if Christ is in us see meaning uh this church will be a continuation of the book of Acts see then but the Book of Revelation shows now how that the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it look warm formal and Powerless see the Book of Revelation will tell you know it uh exposing to us okay what the devil is trying to do to the church see defile it see praise God Hallelujah attempted to attempted destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word right down to the time he cast into the Lake of Fire see praise God and he don't like people to know it that's right right he doesn't like us to know it okay that's why he said he fights that that's right see he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is okay praise God first time I heard that you know when brother Chad was in our place he said God the pro the message never said who she is but the message said what she is praise God see so I was curious you know you know the Philipino people they always smile okay they just smile and listen then we go when we go back home we try to we try to search it if it is true yes the prophet never said who she is praise God see he said what she is okay if if the bride will understand what what she is okay I give this a title we are the branches then I have this subtitle what she is meaning to say if you know what you are see it is not know who you are see but what you are praise God see if the bride will understand what she is what she stands for and what she can do then that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army okay once the bride understand what she is know what she is then she can do a greater work see until you know it you are living below your privilege right see if they can get if they can get a true revelation of the true Spirit within the framework of Christian church and God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her see praise God so we only need to know what we are see if we know what we are then you can see praise God the power that's in our hand okay praise the Lord hallelujah see now we need to understand like I say you know praise God see this message like the prophet said this is a prophetic message I've been emphasizing it okay praise God see it says there men there are men one different from the other all together and in the ministry the Lord has given me most those men were theologians great teachers and Scholars mine is not mine's a more of a prophetic message the message that the that that the messenger is sharing to us is a prophetic message see when you say it's a prophetic message it has something to do on the things that's happening before yesterday today andever forever see praise God and the way I think Divine Healing is the work at the cross that has been completed for you and if you'll just only recognize it you can receive it then the next verse the next quote it says here in the fourth seal and now the first we could just give you scripture after scripture see that the last age is a prophetic message to the church calling them back to the original word the prophetic message will take us back to the pure word of God see praise God Amen Hallelujah see that's why this message you know it's it is it keep on unfolding it's Progressive see praise God hallelujah see meaning to say you know we are a upgrading okay hallelujah praise God see we we we need to move forward so then because this is a prophetic message then the me the prophet said praise God see you now okay I'm reading this quotation okay I put it there in that way uh you will uh sometimes you know your accent is different from my accent okay you have an accent Hallelujah so now there you can read it Hallelujah see you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus of Jesus himself in the church amen his work in the church in the future age amen see praise God then I mention that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it praise God hallelujah see that's in the message of the revelation of Jesus Christ the message the messenger is try okay I'm using the word messenger okay because sometimes if you if I use the prophet Hallelujah sometimes it's not easy for the to some listener because I know this going online okay Hallelujah see it's been telling us the message Christ Jesus is trying to reveal what he is doing see in his church and the F future thing that he is going to do in his church that's why I told you it's Progressive see he did something before he did something in his time and he is going to do something in our time also praise God what he did before what he did then praise God there is something that is going to do something praise God progressively am praise God in our time Hallelujah see Hallelujah but then it says I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it see bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this B this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book cannot be Ral to anyone but a special class of people amen thank you Lord it will take one with prophetic Insight also praise God see the prophet said the his message a prophetic praise God message so we need also a prophetic Insight praise God it will require the ability to hear from God see it says it required to hear the to the ability to hear from God you know that's why he said this is only for the special class of people because only the sheep can hear can follow his voice praise God hallelujah then it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know Hallelujah see so it take okay it will take one prophetic uh with with prophetic Insight okay praise God hallelujah amen so then Jesus need to change his ministry also okay it says as it was in the days of Noah so it shall be in the coming of the son of man they were they were eating drinking marrying giving in marrying and as it was in the days of lot so it shall be in the hours that the son of man will be revealed on Earth okay no not Son of God no more that's right yes see I've been emphasizing this everywhere I go that we are not in the Son of God Ministry anymore amen see we are in the son of man Ministry amen praise God come back as the prophetic message for the last day when that eagle will be flying not the lion not the ox in the sacrifice AGS see then it says hallelujah next praise God I'm quoting to quote from different books in that way you know we have two witnesses okay praise God hallelujah see he says I challenge this whole audience in the name name of Jesus Christ if you could if your conscience don't let Let It Be seal with unbelief don't let it be frustrated can't you see the son of man the son of man in the form of prophetic message returning back again in the church in Prophecy revealing Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it never been done through the age till this time this is the proof of it am okay Hallelujah it says the son of man why son of man because this is now a mystery praise God so he needs to come back here praise God Hallelujah to reveal the mystery amen okay it is not brother branam who's revealing it praise God hallelujah see at the opening of the seals praise the Lord hallelujah it is not brother branam who rebuild the mystery amen see it is now the son of man Ministry who rebuil it and brother Braham heard it and he just said it praise God see where it is now he said now in the form of the Propet prophetic message where it is the spoken word see the spoken word is a prophetic message Hallelujah see praise God he came back now in what form in the prophetic message that's why Hallelujah when you read the spoken word amen I've been telling it to the people to my people you know if if you are not reading the spoken word the message you will not understand what I am saying okay praise God hallelujah I've been telling it also the minister let your people read the message don't you worry they will not understand it because there is a supernatural element that it was it was only given to the minister see the messenger said because they are to feed the flu see praise God God make it that way Hallelujah see so this message is a prophetic message okay so we need a prophetic Insight praise God then praise God so Christ Chang his ministry from the Son of God from the from the Son of God Ministry now to the son of man Ministry in the Son of God Ministry praise God he is doing the mediatorial work okay praise God God loves you God bless you God heals you but now his work is different amen praise God he is now revealing the mystery praise God see Hallelujah where is God where is he he is in the message amen see praise God that's why every time you read the exposition of the seven CS what what is he doing to you he is revealing himself to you through the message praise God see Hallelujah it is him in his ministry as a sonop man Ministry amen praise the Lord hallelujah see now next okay see that's why when I was here praise God I speaks about the latter rain and the former reain okay Hallelujah I've been telling you you know the message imagine he preaches message way back uh 60 plus I told you this is a prophetic message but these things is happening in our age see not in his age see in our age Hallelujah imagine you said this have you not Harvest Time have you noed that in the Harvest time though there is a real acceleration in the ripening there is consequently a slowing of growth until there is no growth yes see when you plant the wheat it will grow will grow fast until the seed appear amen once the seed appear praise God hallelujah it will grow very fast but then it will stop growing see hallelujah praise God because it is not the time of growing anymore it is the time of ripening amen praise God the SE need to be ripened Hallelujah see that's why everything is quieting down Hallelujah see everything that's why the message is saying is is that not exactly what we are seeing now the false Vine is losing multitudes to the Communist and barious other types of belief her numbers are not increasing as she would like us to think her hold of the people is not what it used to be and in so many cases going to church is just a show amen that's that is what happening on the false bind amen praise God we know the false bind okay praise God because we are on YouTube Hallelujah but I do believe you know the false B yeah see he is not increasing anymore praise God he's decreasing y see his people now are you know they because of this social media praise God hallelujah see they hear this they hear praise God you can hear so many so many comments so many praise God hallelujah see so his people now are going to Communism uh on this kind of teaching praise God and that is to the false bind and he said they cannot hold his people anymore because he holdes people before through tra tradition Superstition but today no more am who who who will believe in Superstition superstitious you know praise God hallelujah but then he said to the true bind praise God see and the true Bine what about her is she growing where are those vast numbers that keep coming to revivals and answer altar course are not most of them merely emotional in their approach see praise God hallelujah amen that's right or desires of something physical rather than Desiring that is we that which is truly is spiritual praise God this is what's happening also in the side of the true bind okay I will say to the message people praise God hallelujah you know when I when I come into okay when I come in when I come into the Lord it we have this what we call the Pentecostal Revival in the Philippines way back 1984 up to 1988 see our church started with the signs and wonders I experien it I know it I was there praise God that's why during that time everybody wants to be Pastor because anybody that will lay hands on the sick they will recover praise God see and there is one time you know in the Philippines we during that time 84 to 88 we have so many crusades and during that time praise God see we have a crusade you know Billy Graham came to our country and all the churches I told all the churches Baptist all this Protestant this all this Pentecostal Oneness and threeness Hallelujah they were all together I was so happy I was KN I was KN in the Lord and then there is one Crusade praise God see the people come early and the Evangelist is not yet there and they are singing praising worshiping God the minister the the Evangelist you know he's still traveling and something happened to the people blind see lame walk yeah praise God see to many not just one so you know all the wheelchair yeah praise God Amen so when the Evangelist come he said when he came said I will just take the Lord but remember this you you are blind before now you can see if you live if you left this church I will smoke you blind Smite you blind again Hallelujah and people were afraid because imagine that's signs and wonders see but then something happened also after after several years we cannot see it anymore and I don't know why I cannot understand see that's why all this denominational Church what you know what they did because they want the power see they enjoy that power praise God imagine they have this radio program TV program and if they ask the people okay you lay hands on the television you lay hands on your radio literally the goer will come out praise God cancer will be healed see yes but then it's quetting down and nobody can understand why see praise God when they cannot see it you know what what they did they want Power they went into politics yeah right see amen and they become congressman they become senator now they have the natural political power see why because you know the message said see praise God hallelujah once once the seed appear we don't need we don't need the rain anymore the seed need to be ripened and for that seed to to be ripened it needs a very strong light see that's why praise God hallelujah see that's why God promised it he said now he has promised to send you Heavenly light to ripen the world seed that will be sown for this day the seed is in here the seed is is the Bible why Jesus said so the word is the seed that is so s and now before you can have any crap no matter if you saw the seed it's got to be to have light to ripen the seed or it R and won't do no good it will perish see like I like we know it in natural if you plant the wheat praise God once the seed appear then praise God the seed appear Hallelujah you you you will you will know that the seed is already there because that weed will Bowen praise God see if the rain come now remember Hallelujah we know it okay rain represent the outpouring of the Holy go Holy Ghost see the latter rain is the Harvest rain praise God that see the me the message teach us okay praise God the Harvest rain will produce the signs and wonders see praise God hallelujah see and they cannot understand what it is so when the when the Prophet come into the scene he he is under the latter rain praise God signs and wonders healing and people cannot understand what's happening that's why the former reain come see the latter and the former rain the latter rain is first then the former Reign come amen see to tell us that the latter rain is true see that's why the latter R the former rain is a teaching rain okay so it show us how this Divine Healing works that's why we have this teaching of demonology right hallelujah how the demon Spirit works and how you know how the med medicine works how the doctors Works how the servant of God Anointed with his Spirit Works see Hallelujah see that's why praise God see the seals need to be open in order for us to understand what's happening see or else we will we we will not understand what's happening today why there is no Hallelujah I'm not saying okay I'm not I'm not saying that I am against signs and wonders okay like I told you our church started with signs and wonders I myself I lay hands on people they got healed praise God see but then the prophet said now it's quietening down see we are now we are now going into the different age we are now going to ripen the seed to make it hard see and then he said he promised right he promised to send you Heavenly light to ripen the world seed praise God because if not it will rot and won't do no good it will perish but if it's God seed in the ground and right ground with the right kind of sunlight again with the right kind of sunlight see the Morning Light will not ripen the seed am okay praise God and he promised that in the last days in the evening time the Sun will come out the sun will come out to ripen the seed see Hallelujah the seal will be open so the sun can come out amen praise God to ripen the seed Hallelujah see amen so we so that we can understand okay Hallelujah see all this mystery right the mystery you know Luther saw it he said that just shall live by faith but he don't understand what justification means right see don't know it amen he can only see a partial but not the whole picture praise God hallelujah see he said it's by Gra the just shall live by faith then at the opening of the seals what did the prophet said you know these justifications means like this he said I brother Branham I preach on the night then one brother praise God approached me said brother Branham praise God see maybe he preached on Tuesday night then on Wednesday wednes day the brother come to him he said brother Bram I saw you yesterday Tuesday night you are in the bear house see with a woman then brother Braham said no brother I'm in the church I'm preaching and here's the deacons they are the witnesses then the man will say okay brother I forgive you said how can you forgive me I have not done it see in the first place you are Justified amen praise God that's right see that's why I've been telling it to the people why God why God will save you if you have eternal life see if you have eternal life you have no beginning you have no end why is he going to save you for what he is not saving [Music] us we are always saved he's justifying us that is the meaning of justification see he is justifying us that's why I told to the people you know the word justify is very nice is very good if you say it in Filipino see because the word justified in Filipino is ining Gap when you said Inari you are own ghap completely perfectly really you are really owned by him God is God is justifying us showing that we are his we are completely perfectly we are really his own praise God Amen see Hallelujah am okay praise God we are not yet started okay hallelujah it's so nice right see all this mystery praise God Hallelujah at the opening of the seals all this mystery will become clear to us see because now the perfect light will appear praise God hallelujah see if you cannot see the opening of of the seals that were a problem always coming in praise God hallelujah like I told you you know when these things happen suddenly all these signs and wonder I'm not saying stop but you know we are gleaning okay that's why the prophet said Ruth is gleaning praise God see once in a while the angel will drop the healing right that's why we have this testimony not like used before praise God you know before praise God brother rck and myself we will go in one place he will hold the guitar and then he will ask he will ask the believer okay bring bring a dozen chair praise God it's literally under the lampost praise God see on the sidewalk then the believer will sit on the front and he will sing after singing you see people will just come in praise God and I will step in I will see her then after that brother Rocky will pray he's a man of Faith amen praise God he can pray for a for a blind water buffalo and that and the eyes of the water buffalo will appear see Hallelujah we saw all those

the Lord told me to give you this Bible you know how they read the Bible before when after they they they finish reading they put it back in put it in the plastic and they buried it then when they going to read again they will you know see praise God so many mystery so many I mean signs and wonders but then he himself yeah amen he's saying the church now they don't know what's happening praise God you can read that in the book he said the only thing that the church is doing is to christening right the baby see yeah marry the me mar uh ceremony and Barry the de that's all the church now is doing I said where he's also asking where is the sign and wonders they cannot understand it praise God hallelujah see they experience it I experience it I don't know what happened until I read the message then the message said we are not in the growing process anymore we are now in the ripening praise God in the ripening we need the sunlight we don't need the rain anymore once in a while we have rain okay H Allelujah see praise God you know in the Philippines when we were hit by the Pentecost Revival that's way back 8084 and 88 if you go around southeast Asia I can vouch only for the for the Asia okay praise God you go to Indonesia you go to China you go to Japan praise God all these churches Christian churches they experience the same thing in that age in that in that year praise God hallelujah see then after that I received this message 88 Hallelujah see and during that time brother I we don't believe that the seven seal is open but we know we believe that there is a messenger praise God see until something happened in our country you know during 1995 brother Ed Bisal and brother lony lony Jenkins come to the Philippines I'm tell you bro I tell you in just one visitation they turn our country upside down see when brother Bisal I was there you know I was we were all listening brother bcal he said Satan see he can do he can do almost every anything that God can do except to create amen then he can see every time God speak here's the the creating Word will fly you know and then if it hit the ground it will produce something praise God then s then the son appeared Adam appeared and Adam was there playing in the water and then when God speak when the father speak Satan saw it he tried to jump and grab the word but it passed through his hand and then Adam look up and he grabbed the word and he put it in the water and become a fish my goodness I tell I told you wow what is that see and they've been teaching us okay telling us that the seven seil is open you know the M on that on that day on on that on that Time Scarecrow bull's eye see he said the devil will raise up so many Scarecrow in order for you not to accept it amen once you accept it then you have the bull's eye on your back everybody will hit you that's why I cannot understand you know see my Ministry is greatly influenced when I went then by the grace of God I went to Bible Way 199 6 there they have this special meeting you know we have this Jeremiah M gangang way you know brother lony brother Bisal see and other ministers but what I want to tell you the three Min ministers influence my Ministry and I cannot forgot you know the subject that they preach see Jeremiah preached about the intercessory mediatorship that's why when I first time I went back to Bible way I preached that in the order of mish brother Tim caught it he said yes Jeremiah preached that I said I know I know you will know it I know you know where I get it I want you to know where I get it amen see then brother Lon preached he said you need to know where you're going to take your people see you need to know praise God not just keep on preaching you need to know where where your direction is you need to know praise God you need to tell them what to expect praise God and it's you know is in my heart you need to know where you take your people and then brother bcal said after that brother Bisal said an entrance shall be ministered Hallelujah at the end Brother G retif he preached go west see and I follow that you know so many so many missionary you know went to the philippin okay before I don't know how to use the spoken word and then brother when I got hold of Brother G you know him the this the the building Stone say when I look at it it's a topical topical uh quotation I said this is nice see everybody has a part okay amen praise God if only you know I've been telling it to the minister if only we will not feel insecured praise God hallelujah God used a five-fold Ministry amen see praise God hallelujah that's why the message that we receive this is a prophetic message meaning to say it will keep on revealing revealing what we need to know in our time see so these things happen signs and wonders why it's now quieting down then the message reveal it because he said all the seed has been sown praise God hallelujah see nothing will be produced what seed has been sown you will produce the fruits amen praise God hallelujah see but then hallelujah when this uh when this message okay praise God see when you receive the message Hallelujah okay it need to be ripened that's why the people I told you it connect all the Loose Ends right amen the mystery of justification the mystery of sanctification The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God hallelujah see it will it will be rebuilt to us it will be revealed to us see then if you have remember this if the seed that we receive is the present Tru or the message of the hour that's why I've been telling it to the minister you don't need to tell the people to live a holy life if for 20 years for more than I think 50 years now this BCF if the pastor keep on telling you to live a holy life there is something there is something wrong with you or there is something wrong with the minister see just teach them the opening of the word see because once the seed appear praise God you know the plant right Hallelujah see we have the leaves we have the stock then we have the shock then we have the seed right once the seed appear then it it was it it was exposed to the sunlight what will the seed do he will suck the life of the Li he will sack the lives of the of the stock he will sack the life of the Shar that's why all of that plan will become Brown why it's dead see praise God hallelujah if we can receive the sunlight then we will able to receive the message of justification we will able to receive the message of San sanctification ification it is not become our problem because sanctification Now isn't in us see until until even the life that is in the root that is the last thing praise God that that seed will do it will suck the life that is in the root now the seed become life that's right see even if you plant that plant with the root it will not grow anymore it has no life but look at that small seed if you plant it yes you can see the life because all the life will go into the seed the life of the seed is the life of the plant amen hallelujah see so that is our principle okay so that's why the message said okay next it says here I'm laying down the foundation okay so in that way you will understand what we are trying to what we are trying to say see now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the father see that is the ministry of the Malachi for to turn us back where to the pure word of the Bible amen praise God number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders of Revelation 10 which are the Revelation contained in the Seven Seals so let make it say let make it simple the opening of the seals okay praise God that is the Thunders see the revelation of the opening of the seal the revelation of the Seven Seals praise God it will be this divinely reveal praise God divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to Pentecostal father see hallelujah amen what is the seven Thunders that is the prophetic message the seven seal is the prophetic message being revealed by whom by the son of man amen praise God see telling it teaching it to the church Hallelujah see once we are accepted it then we can go back where to the original word of God amen amen hallelujah oh brother I memorize the Bible see the prophet said though it's good it won't work see Hallelujah even if you memorize the Bible that Holy life will not come out in your life amen praise God hallelujah see praise God now okay we're going to start so you have the background you have the idea okay praise God now see we know that God is the god of the universe okay I'll just qu I just read the quote okay he was the god of Earth Adam you know praise God he was the god of Earth God is the god in of the universe everywhere praise God so Adam is a minor God and God praise God hallelujah go minor God under God our father because he was the son of God okay praise God hallelujah see now what the father is okay if the father is a something like a bus water of ocean sea then Adam is the part of that ocean Maybe is just a teaspoonful of ocean praise God so what Adam is same thing with the father praise God hallelujah see now God you know God has a seed okay when God created Adam he is in the spirit form right praise God and Adam is the part of the mind of God and the mind of God is the seed praise God now God needs to plant the seed Hallelujah that's why God needs an earth see that's why he needs Adam the name Adam means red earth right praise God then God put that seed in that Earth and he call it Adam praise God hallelujah all the mystery all the plan all the program of God is in Adam Lord amen hallelujah that's why on this Earth God never named names he only named one name Adam yes sir and this whole earth is a mystery because there are so many creature on the earth there are the fish there are the lion there the birds the trees the flowers but they have no names amen see and Michael and Gabriel and War moov they cannot understand it they said what is here's the animal what is this animal with a big fur on his on his neck neck and he can he can grow W see Michael said what is that Gab said what is that animal and Adam said he is a lion lion then they saw another oh lion they saw another one lion lion lion amen see and then praise God there's a big bird flying and Gabriel said what is that the one who said Adam said Eagle Eagle Eagle Eagle Eagle he's naming all the animals he's naming all the fish what what is that a rainbow trout then Gabriel and Michael look at the Father the father said amen hallelujah amen prise see praise God he names everything that's why if you will notice the Bible always start with the name see when you go into the New Testament this is the generation of Jesus Christ it will always praise God see Hallelujah the mystery the first mystery you know praise God when you come into the message the first mystery is the name of the father son Holy Ghost is always the name because it happened in the Garden of Eden praise the Lord hallelujah am see so Adam praise God see he holds the seed he holds the mystery of the father praise God and the father cannot express it he needs something to express it so Adam become the extension of of the father praise God hallelujah see he only express the voice of God praise God see the voice of Adam the voice of God and the voice of Adam are the same praise God hallelujah he's revealing he's the bo revealing a voice revealing the boys praise God hallelujah see the father cannot express it until Adam appear praise God hallelujah see because praise God hallelujah see H the father got the seed okay so he need a branch to produce that fruits praise the Lord hallelujah Adam's voice becomes the voice of God of the father he is the final voice praise God see now Adam become the vessel of the seed okay praise God see he knew the plan of God but then the fall came we know what happened in the Garden of Eden right praise God see the woman was deceived see so God needs to throw them out of the garden when God throw them out of the garden they lost they lost the way of the tree of life amen see the the Bible is very clear if God will not push them out of the garden they will live eternally right praise God and God don't want them don't want them to live in eternity in this in the Fallen State see because if we live eternally in the Fallen State then we will be in big trouble right sister you don't want it right imagine when you are in the Fallen state and your husband praise God in the Fallen State lazy doing nothing every time they come home they will hit you kick you you don't like it right sister amen so you will going to pray right you're going to pray that you die or he die see because nobody di praise God see hallelujah praise God see that's why after the fall Adam was separated from the Tree of Life he was separated from the way of the Tree of Life see there is no problem with Adam Adam knew what's happening because the mystery the SE is in him he know what the father wants to do Hallelujah that's why he is just expressing what Christ is expressing today praise God see when they went out praise God of the Garden of Eden now the Bible said say then Man live according to the imagination of their heart see and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thought of his heart was only evil continually that is Before the Flood then after the flood the same thing and the Lord smell a sweet sa and the Lord said into his heart I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's shake for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth praise God see Hallelujah so it's so normal okay that our heart that we were Born Sinner okay praise God because we don't know the way of God anymore praise God hallelujah then the seed was lost the seed was lost was God see so every man they do what they want to do praise God hallelujah until until finally God found Moses right he found Israel what did he do see it says here in Hosea 9: 10 the lowest of you know it says here I found Israel like graves in the wilderness I saw your fathers as the first R in in the pig Tre at her first time you know praise God God saw Israel in the wilderness meaning praise God he is just a uh you know praise God he's he's she's wandering but then God found her like a fig tree in his first first tribe meaning to say uh first fruits he saw Israel bearing the first fruit of the Fig Tree praise God hallelujah see then God gave them the law okay the law praise God is just a seed praise God but the seed will produce the fruits that's why the Bible said for the L having a shadow of good things to come see praise God hallelujah God believing praise God these fruits the law will produce a good a beautiful things to come what is the beautiful things to come a holy nation praise God A peculiar people a nation of priesthood Hallelujah see but then Israel praise God that's why up to now you know Israel is is the Apple in the eyes of God we cannot do anything about it praise God hallelujah see so when God saw Israel Hallelujah he planted the seed in Israel that's why he he's not doing it anywhere he's just doing it in Israel because he planted the seed there he's he did not plant it anywhere only in Israel okay praise God until Jesus come when Jesus come on the sin he said Hallelujah he is the sin right praise God the word of God made flesh but then in John chapter 15 verse1 it says he declared that he is the true vine he said I am the True Vine and my father is the husband man I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if you abide in me in my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it will shall be done unto you herein we is my f father glorified glor glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples okay now praise God now Jesus now is trying to introduce himself from sin now he said I am the vine and you are the branches praise God see so when God the Father praise God and hears Adam Adam is like the branch of the vile the voice of God went out to the voice to the mouth of Adam so the voice of Adam is the voice of God praise God Hallelujah see now J now here come Jesus said I am the vine and you are the branches praise God see Hallelujah he's trying to tell us something okay now it says here in the restoration of the Bride tree but what he was God's perfect prophet he was God's perfect Prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree amen glory I'm going to say something directly if he is the bride bridegroom tree do you believe it from the Garden of Eden then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he's got to have a Bright Tree he's got to be born of the same material the word made flesh in the tree hope you get it it's the same life in this female tree the bridegroom as it is in the bride that's the works that I do shall you also is that right he was the bridegroom remember see now the prophet is the messenger is trying to tell us in the restoration of the Bride tree you know as a minister when we study the bridegroom tree we'll always a restoration of the Bride tree we always speaks about the four insect the four destroyer and the four uh restoration St stage four stage of restoration but the prophet is trying to tell us about this bridegroom tree he said this is a perfect perfect Prophet tree perfect example tree the bridegroom tree and then he said if he is the bridegroom tree do you believe it from the Garden of Eden sir so he's been saying that this bridegroom tree is the tree of life but he cannot produce anything unless there is a bride the bride tree praise God and the and the bride tree he said needs to be same like the bridegroom three praise God in that way he said the works that I do shall you also praise God if that bride tree if he abide in the bridegroom tree he can do what he did amen okay praise God hallelujah then he said you say that ain't scriptural oh it is see he can do what I did then somebody say it's not scriptural I cot that now see we're fishing that healing meeting in a minute I cot that he was now he Prov it you want you want you want proof of it he said I am the Bine now he's connecting it to that scripture I am the vine you are the branches see the bridegroom is the vine the bride tree is the branch amen praise God St John saying it I am the Bine you are the branches you bear the fruit see and the male tree and the female tree produces the pollen one to one another brings the fruit and the branch and the vine does the same thing see that's exactly right praise God hallelujah he said now this first tree was a prophet tree A Perfect Tree the god of the prophets he was a major tree he was God's perfect Prophet tree why he was the word okay praise God he keep on you know he's been saying praise God he was God's perfect Prophet Tre okay so meaning to say the bride tree will also be a perfect bride tree see then he said what the perfect Prophet Tre the bride tree will do it also the works that I do you shall do also praise God hallelujah then they said is not scriptural yes it is because I am the bind Jesus said the perfect proper tree is the bride is the vine now the bride is the branches Hallelujah see praise God the branch will produce the fruits Hallelujah he we are God's fruit bearers and I believe in in St John 17 chapter Jesus said ye are the branches and he was the vine the Bine puts for the fruit but the branches has to Bear the fruits Hallelujah not the vine but the fruits is in the vine Hallelujah if the branch is getting its life out of the vine well it's the same kind of life that's in the vine see now praise God okay if this is the Bine okay the branch has no life all the life is in the vine praise God the fruit is in the vine but the fruits will not appear see yeah you know sometimes we don't understand why God is using the metaphor of tree and fruit and Seed praise God and I I don't understand it also until praise God you know there is one brother praise God who preached that he said you know that the Hebrew word came from a pictograph I said what is that pictograph praise God he said all the Hebrew word came from a pictograph okay like I'm have Chinese you know I can I can read Chinese character a few okay and we were we were taught in the school you know the Chinese character come from a pictograph praise God see and here it is okay praise God the word prophecy came from a came from two pict to graph the picture of a seed and a picture of a tent or a house praise God see it says praise God now according to the you know to the old Hebrew language prophecy says a fruit produced from the inside of a man see a prophecy it is a fruit produced where inside the B okay not in the branch it was produced there but it need to come out praise God it will coming out where in the branch that's right praise God so now if this is the perfect bridegroom tree the bride tree will be the branch Okay then if this is a perfect Prophet Prophet Tre now the branch will also be a prophet amen okay praise God but then the seed the fruit is in the vine see it will not come out until the branch appear so when the branch appear praise God the fruit will push out will coming out praise God that's why the meaning of the Prophet you know they call it the young people noie noobs I was surprised see you noobs it's a good word noobs means Prophet I was surprised you know Hallelujah and he is the one who will bring forth the inner fruits he will produce he will show the fruits and then in the fruits there are seed to S to prophesy okay Hallelujah see that's why in our age praise God see we have this perfect Prophet Tre now we have a prophet who bring out the fruit see he just bring out the fruit from the vine from a from the son of man see the son of man is telling us is showing us the fruit and we cannot understand it until the branch appear when the branch appear now come the fruits and then he saw it yeah that's right amen and we call it spoken word booklet amen okay praise God hallelujah see that's why the message okay the Bible said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel but in the days of the voice of a prophet see when he shall begin to sound the mystery the mystery the prophet always the prophet will reveal the mystery praise God of God should be finished as he had declared to his servant the prophet then a voice which I heard from Heaven speak unto me again and said go and take the book little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the W upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey then he said and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had I had eaten my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people Nation TKS and Kings okay praise God hallelujah that's why at the opening of the seals see we have a messenger we have a prophet revealing us the fruits praise God and we are commanded to eat that book that open book that's why if you cannot see the opening of the seals that's where the problem is hallelujah see some people cannot see it I don't you know like I say that's not my problem okay they cannot see it but here we believe it that the seven seal is open right that the seven seal is open if you cannot believe that the seven seal is open praise God meaning to say you cannot prophesy see because the opening of The Seven seal is the revealing of the fruits is the revealing of the prophecy is the revealing of the mystery praise God see you cannot prophesy okay unless it is a mystery am Hallelujah see and you can only prophesy unless you are a prophet and if our first fruits like I say is a prophet the whole crap is also a prophet amen see Hallelujah see that's why we can prophesy do you understand it yes sir PR we are now we are not commanded to preach you know I've been I've been doing that for a long time but today brother you cannot go out and say you know my friend do you know that the love God loves you don't you worry you theni your friend will tell you oh yeah my my God also loves me my God heals me yes my God also heals me see today is different the way we Shar the gospel the message is different right you know we have a we have a church in a festar hotel in Sanga Hotel brother Chad been there you know how it's How It Was started the brother you know they have this corporate meting then during the break time they went to the restro the brother said there are two brother they are being trained by denominational Church to become a pastor and this brother of us you know he is a black siden brother okay when they went when then then then they went to the restroom he said do you know that Cain is not the son of [Laughter] Adam so this was this this brother said what Cain is not the son of Adam then then then when they went back to the seminar he said to the other brother hey he said that K is not the son of Adam can you believe it see then they approach him show showed them it's different now who doesn't know that God loves them but do you know praise God what happened that's why I've been telling it to the you know every time I go out I come I come to the churches I've been telling them I do not come here to teach you to become a good person because no good person will go to heaven am right we do not preach to people become a good people we we we preach because we want people to be saved I was not commissioned to reform you see because they don't understand what happened why they need salvation see they don't know what happened in the Garden of Eden right it was it was it an apple no it is not an apple see praise God they don't know it because it's a mystery they don't even know what sin is like I told you before when I went into the police station see I was there to teach them I told them to teach you what teach you how to become a good person you are the one who arresting those bad people how can I teach you good see but then I told them drinking is not sin adultery is not sin W they were so happy they're looking stealing is not sin corrupt to be corrupt is not sin see it's a mystery to them yeah right I told them that is the fruits of the sin that's right they don't know what sin is Right amen see yeah that's a problem today praise God that's why when we go out when we share we share it differently praise God hallelujah see amen there is one brother in our church he's been he's been in the Baptist Church for for a long time okay sorry he thought he he thought that uh he's already in good hands see but then when I open the book of Hebrew I said Paul said there there is a a basic teaching faith salvation laying of hands baptism of the Holy Ghost holy life but then Paul said let's stop it right right let's go unto Perfection yeah amen so he was surprised see Hallelujah I always when I go out you know I always ask the people when I have when I have a chance I will only ask them do you believe mostly those who read the scripture do you do you believe that we came from Adam and Eve they will say yes see so if if if came from Adam if the type blood of Adam is a so if blood must be a so where is the other types of blood come from it's a mystery amen you are prophesying you are revealing something to them right it is a hidden truth they cannot understand it praise God that's why today it's different I've been telling it to the people you need to prophesy Hallelujah see if you know what you are when you prophesying when you're revealing the mystery when you when you're are sharing them the church ages when you're revealing this Seven Seals when you're raling them the serpent SE what are you doing you are prophesying amen see praise God yeah that's why they cannot when I went when I was in Indonesia praise God hallelujah I shared to them about the Tabernacle of God say my interpreter is interpreter of the uh of the government in the United Nation see he he got all his notes about the Tabernacle of God ah I I have this and then when he heard when he listened to me he was so excited he's preaching his own message that's why that's why the pastor stopped him see I said why did you do that the Pastor said your interpreter he was so excited praise God he's preaching his own message he cannot believe what he heard praise God see Hallelujah he cannot understand it there are three altars there are three lives there are three foods that's right and he cannot understand it until he heard it and he was surprised different I've been telling it to the people we share this GOP you know we Shar the gospel the Bible the message differently that's right you are prophesying praise God prophesy praise God don't tell your don't tell your uh your friend God loves you they know it already that's why they are being blessed see praise God see tell them do you know that that Kane is not the son of Adam see praise God what is the name of the father son Holy Ghost they don't know it it's a mystery right praise God you are prophesying see that's why once the bride knew what she is praise God an invincible Army he know where he's standing okay praise God now we are halfway okay amen so the bride is not commissioned to preach the bride is commissioned to prophesy see praise God because we are we are to reveal the mystery that was hidden praise God hallelujah now in Revelation chapter 5: 10 he said and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth okay he made us Kings and Priests I will just deal with the priest praise God hallelujah see see now in all if we have a priest we need a temple okay Hallelujah see because if we don't have the temple where will the priest going to uh to minister praise God but then Jesus said Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this Temple and three days I will raise it up again okay put it put it in your mind okay that once the true church praise God once they understand who they are the true church will appear okay praise God we need to be part of that true church praise God see Hallelujah and Jesus said unto them destroy the temple in 3 days I will raise it up again then said the Jews 40 and6 years was this temple in in building and will thou real up in 3 days but he spake of the Temple of his body praise God hallelujah he said he's going to build his Temple okay what now you not know you not that the your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost God is building okay praise God hallelujah see remember this God is building a temple Paul see praise God so that the priest can appear so that he can keep his Mercy Seat The Mercy Seat will always be in the temple it will not go out of the temple okay praise God hallelujah now then the father promised he will be back in his mystical body okay Jesus said destroy that Temple and inre say I will build it then he's talking about his body am so his body is a temple praise God hallelujah and then he said we

you it was him that come in spirit form go up and wait for I'm going to send a promise the father had promised you I'm going to send it upon you that's the Holy Ghost then I'll be with you even in you all the way to the end of the world and I will be in you doing the same things that I did while I was in this body see I will be back in my mystical body am praise God doing the same thing so now praise God we know that the seven Church ages okay Hallelujah see the seven Church ages we call it the gentle dispensation you know it has the light the Moonlight also okay the seven Church ages will call it the body of Christ right praise God that is the body Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church that even the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail see Hallelujah now now for nearly 2,000 years God had been again making him a masterpiece see for 2,000 years God is trying to build the third Masterpiece praise God see and what is the m the third Masterpiece says here for nearly 2,000 years

hallelujah see now he said I'm going to build a temple I'm going to build my church I'm going to build my house right praise God but then Jesus said how be it the most high dwelleth not in the temples made with hands as as said the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is is my foot stol what house will you build me said the Lord or what is the place of my rest see imagine God wants to build a temple hallelujah how big it is he said the Earth is my Throne the Earth is the the heaven is my Throne the Earth is my foot stol so it's a very big Temple right praise God hallelujah and now we saw that the seven Church ages that is the body okay praise the Lord then praise God he said the temple that is going to make it must be from Heaven to Earth yes praise God see that's why Hallelujah in the Book of Revelation the seven Church ages you know he said it it was finished with the with the door closed behold I stand at the door and knock if anyone hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sh with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne see so now he's talking about a throne praise God hallelujah so the seven Church ages the loudan age was finished with a closed door okay but then in in Revelation chap 4 after this I look and behold a door was open in heaven the the door on Earth is already closed but there is a door in heaven that was open okay praise God hallelujah so this seven Church ages it was finished with a closed door now you need to overcome that closed door how can you overcome it he said praise God hallelujah if anyone hear my voice again it's about hearing the voice of God those who those who have the prophetic Revelation they can hear the voice of God that's they have the ability to listen to hear to follow the voice of God see that's why the prophet said the where we are we are now sitting where in the Heavenly places what are what are we doing there we are eating St with me praise God hallelujah see so the bride where we are now we are in the Heavenly places sitting what we are doing there we are we are eating with him Hallelujah this all this mystery praise the Lord see that's why at the opening of the seals Hallelujah I've been telling it at the opening of The Seals All The Mystery of God see he been he been showing he been revealed to us the mystery of the justification message right Hallelujah see praise God next it says here notice it is not revealed until this book is not revealed until the church ages and denominational Ages was run out and there's time no more see it's only revealed after church ages denominational age ages has run out that's the reason the thing is in such a scruple tonight see that's why we have so many okay we have so many that's the reason we have so many doctrines praise God because the seal is not yet open praise God see what what will the seal do it says here but those mystery are promised okay but those mystery are promised to be revealed in the end time it's little loose ends that these great warriors has come on the same OS Martin St Martin polycarp and different ones Luther Westy and all this see as how they have come and just live long enough to kind of bring a light a light and shine it but they left many things in the darkness see meaning to say we don't have enough praise God light we don't have enough Revelation to understand it until this age right at the opening of the seals praise God hallelujah see that's why that's why the prophet said see we are Justified yes we are always saved he is not saving us that's why in the in the midst the future homes we are always saved see how can he save us he said he never he he do not save us he we are always saved he's redeeming us see not saving us praise God hallelujah all this loose ends you know praise God it is like you know I have three sons okay let's say one of my son become naughty and he went out of the house and go somewhere else I've been waiting for him okay then one day I need to find my son right I need to go out and look for my son when I go out I look for my son he said where is my son he was in jail they put him in jail so I went to the Jailer I asked the officer what happened oh your son is a naughty boy see so he put him in jail what do I need to take him out you need to redeem him that's right am see what is the price the blood amen see so I pay it with the blood when my son come out he said you know Dad when I was in in the jail there's so many good people there they help me they give me water to drink they give me food when I was sick they took good care of me am that's right yeah what do you want me to do my son can you save them see so I will go to the Jailer I want to pay the price for them when they come out they will say this is the mystery they don't know anything about the blood yeah they have no idea about the blood said why did you save us yeah right we we have eternal life we have the beginning we don't we don't have the beginning and we don't have the end that's why how he how why is he going to save us when we have no beginning and we have no end you are always saved he is just redeeming us because we are his own see but these people yeah they were not his amen praise God that's right but they were rewarded with eternal life they have the beginning but they don't have the end see praise God so that's the difference between redeeming and Sav Hallelujah so when these people come out why did you do that to us sir when you did to my son amen see amen there's no blood there is there a blood no they cannot understand it because something is happening now brother remember this something you need to know what you are amen see there is no blood there but they were got saved see so now God is trying to build something he's trying to build what a temple okay praise God see now he said Upon This Rock I will build my church okay Hallelujah we are in different age okay praise God hallelujah we are in the age where the sun shine bright the s o n light Sunshine bright see now Hallelujah this those people always got saved because of you do you understand it because of you praise God see they never heard the gospel but they were got saved Hallelujah see now praise God okay now here the seven Church ages we understand that is the body of Christ okay let's put the body now that's the body but without the head that's why the scripture is very clear them without us is not complete it need to be completed we need the head so when the head come there it is amen see now it is complete God we have the sunlight when once a sunlight appear we don't need the Moonlight anymore praise God see we call it the bride age we are not in the seven Church ages anymore that's why at the opening of the seal it will it will once the seal is open meaning to say we the denominational church is finished the church is is finished amen so if that is finished where we are we are now in the bright age we are no longer in the body age we are now in our head age see praise God that's why when the prophet said we have the mouth we have the ear we have the eyes yeah amen right praise God so when the pro when when the prophet appear Hallelujah but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel then he show us he show then we heard y right praise God but at the opening of the seal something happened my brother and sister see he's revealing the mind of God that's right see he is not only revealing the mind of God he is revealing the back part of the mind of God hallelujah imagine now we understand the meaning of justification he is not saving us he's justifying us yeah praise God he's redeeming us Hallelujah but through us because we are now the body okay greater work once the bride understand what she is greater work she will do praise God hallelujah what is this now now this whole complete that is now the mystical body now that is the true church praise God that's why the prophet said okay Hallelujah see the real church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ praise God now every every person that comes to Christ comes out of the world comes into Christ comes into his mystical body Hallelujah we are not joining church anymore we are joining to that mystical body amen praise God hallelujah see once you are in in in that mystical body you will be able to access the back part of the mind of God hallelujah L see praise God who set it up that is this mystical body who started this Jesus Christ praise God he is the head of the mystical body he's the king over it working his own will in his Dominion praise the Lord he is the one who started it said upon this church I will build my praise God Upon This Rock I will build my church praise God and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail see the church is also a gate that's right praise God see the church is also a gate if this other gate he said the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail this gate praise God will take you where praise God in heaven amen hallelujah that's why I've been telling it to the people it's so important for you to have a home church if you don't have a home Church praise God I don't know where you are praise God see sometimes people don't understand what the home Church Hallelujah they don't understand what the pastor is see Hallelujah we are in the age of the the Feast of the atonement you know during the Feast of the atonement the priest praise God all the sins of the all the sins of Israel you know only in one one time one day that is in the in the day of the Feast of the atonement the priest needs to go inside the holy of holies that's why during the Feast of the atonement Feast of the trumpet people of Israel will start coming to the the temple that is the only time they will come back to the temple praise God because Hallelujah they want to witness something that is very important in their life right during that P of the atonement praise God the priest will carry all all you know praise God every time in dur in the Old Testament if you commit the sin okay the January I steal the money okay February I commit adultery March I commit this once you commit something in one year twice they will you will be stoned to death see you only need to do it once then praise God literally the priest of the temple compile it okay Hallelujah they have all the Le but then in the Feast of the atonement praise God the priest need to go to the temple first need to go to the holy of holies see praise God he will go in there with the blood am okay but if he will not walk the walk even though there is a blood yes he will die amen see if he die the sin of the people will not be erased right Hallelujah this is the same thing we have today the church the pastor that's why I've been telling you to the people the pastor will be accountable to your soul not you praise God you know you know the story of the Good Samaritan see there is a man he came from where he came from Jerusalem went back went to Jericho he was beaten by the Levites he was beaten by the tax collector you know and the prophet said half dead that is physically alive is spiritually dead praise God now here's the Good Samaritan representing Jesus heal him first healed him he found him not he found him it's always that way see he found you he found me amen right Hallelujah he carry us he take us to the in what is the in he said that is the church amen see there are many churches here how come that God Lees you here right see praise God hallelujah see after that there is an inkeeper that represent the p Pastor he said take good care of him Hallelujah when I come back if there is something lacking I will pay you I will reward you see so you need to have your home Church you need to have your pastor right praise God hallelujah see that's how important it is brother dor you mean to say praise God look at that look at look at the on on the Old Testament the types see we were condemned right did we did it do we did it no Adam did it not us and God is Not unjust he also saved us do we did it also no he just saved us by one man we die by one manth we live see Hallelujah so same thing now praise God hallelujah see why because because the prophet said now Hallelujah who set it up now you the temple of God see the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit you are the blood of Christ see praise God we are in this body we represent we are the branch he is the vine okay praise God the mystery of The Mercy Seat Hallelujah they're they're looking for The Mercy Seat look where is The Mercy Seat now it says here The Mercy Seat is he okay praise God see now we are living in another age Glory oh I love this age don't you now God has a mercy seat today to be guarded you believe that where is The Mercy Seat found in the heart of man where did it come in the heart of man at the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost which is God come into the human heart see praise God when they crucify the Lord he is The Mercy Seat of God that's why the bail in the temple was read in two praise and they cannot they cannot understand it so today is the same thing where is The Mercy Seat of God in in the branch amen see you are the blood of Christ praise God in the spirit Hallelujah that the church is the blood of Christ the mystical body see praise God hallelujah that's why you can be you can be a mediator for your family Hallelujah the church your pastor that's why you need to look for a good church you need to look for a a good pastor see because if God will not accept the minister if God did not accept that high priest everybody will be lost see but once God accepted that priest when he go out the people will rejoice because now they have hope see that their sin will be forgiven praise God hallelujah see so same thing in our time praise God that's why we are living in different age praise God see this is the time where the sun shine bright telling us you are Justified you have not done it in the first place blessed is the man that God did not impute sin how can you condemn you how you condemn yourself if you have done nothing wrong if you have no sin how can you condemn who can condemn you praise God praise God oh he he he he did a lot of mistake he did a lot of bad things do you know now there's another mystery of sanctification right praise God it says here you know how our sin is like is like a an ink a dark ink okay praise God the redeeming blood of God is like a a a Clorox see when you commit sin praise God now it is like a dark egg that if you confess it okay if you confess it then it is like a dark in falling into the drum full of Clorox then the prophet said what will happen to your sin your sin God will count it as your righteousness imagine even your sin God will count it as your righteousness imagine Hallelujah see how can you condemn praise God hallelujah that's I've been telling it to the people you know this message is full of grace this is the only message we that we have a double Grace see not only single Grace praise God hallelujah that's why you know that's what make us happy that's what make us glad you know imagine praise God hallelujah because God is telling us who we are who you what what what what you are praise God you are the priest you are the high priest you are the you know the priest need the blood Hallelujah see we are the priest at the same time we are the blood at the same time you are The Mercy Seat amen hallelujah say praise God see what do you need what what do you still need we don't did anything anymore praise God see we don't need the sensation okay Hallelujah again I believe in signs and wonders but brother this is much greater see imagine because of you your neighbor will your your neighbor will be saved because of you your friend will be saved that is the much greater word what is the much greater word soul to be saved yeah praise God not people okay not see I believe in signs and wonders amen but the prophet said today you can be healed today and tomorrow you will die of the same sickness okay praise God hallelujah I have nothing against the signs and wonders like I told you our church started with signs and wonders praise God hallelujah see I saw so many miracles but when I saw this message Sayes I like this more imagine my friend will be saved praise God because they are just good to me see imagine your neighbor will be saved don't you want your neighbor to be saved brother Brian Hallelujah see because one day they come to your door and knock at your door he said my friend my neighbor here's a little uh you know maybe a dear me or I shed a i sh I shut a deer praise God see Hallelujah what's more greater than the soul to be saved see that's why that's why the prophet said once the bride will know what she is what you are you are the blood of Christ praise God what you are you are the prini of God what you are praise God you are the mercy SE amen see the mercy in is in the Bine yeah right praise God hallelujah but the mercy seat cannot express The Mercy Seat cannot express itself in full in the seven Church ages amen praise God see no way for him to express that in the seven Church ages praise God it can only be expressed in our time praise God that's why people are looking for The Mercy Seat hallelujah amen see it is in the mystical Body of Christ amen amen you know if you will if if only the bride will understand it right praise God even your horse if you have a horse even your dog if you have a dog even your cat God will save it God will give it to you see praise God hallelujah it's so hard to understand it but I just believe it if God can save the dog and the horse I do believe God can save can save our children that's why the prophet said even how Wayward they are God God will give it to you those that love you those who you love amen praise God hallelujah is what the bride is praise God we are the mercy you know I like that what Brother Richard said we are the extended grace of God we are the branch the extended Grace the branch of God hallelujah the branch of mercy of God in our time praise God hallelujah imagine if all the bride knew who what she is hallelujah I've been telling you brother see we will be we will be rejoicing right that's why the that's why the scripture is very clear see he she Rejoice she Rejoice only the bride has something to Rejoice with in the denomination everything is just emotional yeah see praise God but to us hallelujah you are the gate okay the church is the Gate of God going to heaven praise God hallelujah many people will pass through that gate because of you praise God Amen praise God see we are the branches now you understand what you are praise God see you are the priest you are the blood of Christ You're The Mercy Seat then you're commanded also you are a prophet amen let's always stand up praise God thank you Jesus amen let's sing that song okay praise God I fought a good fight see like I say you know praise God when I when I read that message when the prophet said America need he needs more missionaries you know I don't understand it but when I saw these things is happening in America you know praise God I said we you they need to be reminded they teach us they taught us that the seven seal is open I'm not ashamed okay to tell you that the seven seal is open I believe it in my heart say I'm a message believer praise God if they are afraid if they are scared of of of their scarecrow praise God let's let's just pray for them praise God see this message is different this is full of grace like I told you imagine people just be associated with you be good to you right are you not happy amen praise God see your friend your loved ones see amen we are crying for our children we are crying for our love was but the message keep on telling us don't you worry don't you worry my children amen praise God hallelujah

forward Amen brother brandom said that all that Christ was he poured into the church until she becomes he amen whatever he was when he was on earth now through the branches he's manifesting the same thing say God help us to abide in the vine and surrender our life and let him flow his life out through us and when it says prophesy again if we look through the Bible the Bible is the record of the prophecy of the prophets it's written of the prophets all the way through the Old Testament and coming up into the new amen and every one of them was resisted rejected persecuted but their prophecy changed the course of history what they said changed lives what they said brought God's manifestation on the earth what they spoke amen became reality to a people what's our job after we've eaten the open book to prophesy again am what can we expect probably everything the prophets had before and what Jesus Christ suffered with but you know that word won't return into him void but it'll accomplish what he's sent and out to do amen when we speak the word it's got a power when we speak the mystery of God revealed it has its own life and its own power and it'll accomplish its own work we're not looking for our power to do anything it's the power of the spoken word help us to keep speaking this true word this revelation of the hour and share it with whoever we here may God help us may God help us to be a true vine a true Branch connected to the True Vine amen God bless you as you go may the Lord bless you you appreciate your mothers and appreciate this day we've set aside and mothers I

Sur real the age that we live in it's so beyond just the just the the common life that we see but God there's something so Supernatural you're accomplishing through our lives through our flesh God forgive us Lord for the times that we lose sight of what it is that this age is all about and what you're trying to accomplish God we get focused on the wrong things sometimes and distracted by things but God you've brought us back today to a remembrance Lord of what this message is all about and what our part is in it and why you've raised us up in this day and why you've redeemed us back to yourself and connected us back to the vine so that you can flow your life right out through the vine through the branches and that you could reproduce the same fruit again in our lives God help us to rejoice in that Lord for as long as you have a bride on this Earth There's an opportunity for Life Lord as long as you have a mouthpiece Lord as long as you have an intercessor as long as you have a
