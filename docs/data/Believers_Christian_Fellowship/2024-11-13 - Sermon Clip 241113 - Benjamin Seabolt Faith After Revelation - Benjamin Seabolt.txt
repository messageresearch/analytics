========================================

when the church goes up Satan goes down that is an event that will happen that can be an event that's happening right now though when you come up in Revelation Satan is cast down I'm going to tell you why it's because the accuser of the Brethren is a title and the scripture that we read at the beginning of the service says that there has to be two witnesses in order for anything to hold up preferably three so when you come up and you do not confess doubt when you do not confess impatience when you do not confess disbelief in God's word the accuser of the Brethren is standing there by himself trying to accuse the brethren in violation of God's law because he's standing by himself his testimony will not hold up right amen there has to be a second testimony that's why I would encourage you do not join him in confessing impatience do not join him in confessing unbelief do not join him in confessing frustration right do not let his accusation hold weight in the court of God's law he has nobody else to help him establish Lish his testimony it has to come off of your lips without it he is kicked out of court it will not hold water right that is an event that will happen in the future literally I believe in the spiritual realm but that's an event that's happening right now in our daily lives do not give the accuser of the Brethren place in your life Saints you have the power to rid him of that position Amen Let Your confession be yay and amen Revelation 12 says and they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love their lives not to the death I've read this differently today and they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony I've always read that by the word of their test testimony being the group The Bride collectively but I've come to find out that's not how God wants me to read it God wants me to read it that they by the word of their testimony their equals me and God Amen yeah I love you dearly you confess whatever you want to confess my testimony is the word of God and by the blood of the lamb and by their testimony equal sign me and God we will overcome if you want to overcome with us confess what he says but I'm no longer going to take a group mentality towards that scripture I will overcome because I'm not going to confess what Satan confesses I'm going to confess what God has confessed and their testimony mining God's testimony will overcome
