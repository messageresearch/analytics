I know the master of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. He can calm the storm and make the sun to shine again. I know the master of the wind. Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the sky.

I know the master of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. He can calm the storm and make the sun to shine again. I know the master of me in the presence of Jehovah God Almighty. Prince of peace, trles, hearts are in the praise of the King in and out of situations that tug a war at me. All day long I struggle for the answers that I need. Then I come into his presence. All my questions become clear. And for that sacred moment, no doubts can interfere in the presence of Jehovah God Almighty. You're the prince of peace. Trles pain hearts are in the praise of the king. Through his love, the Lord provided a place for us to rest. There's a place to find the answers in the hour of distress. Now there's never any reason for you to give up in this man. Just slip your way and breathe his pain. We will surely meet you there in the presence of Jehovah God Almighty. He's the prince of peace. Trles Vish hearts are in the presence of the king. Amen. God bless you all this morning. Let's bow our heads together. Dear Lord Jesus, once again, we're so thankful that you've gathered us together that you've drawn us by your drawing power, Lord. And we've not come here in vain, but we believe it's an appointed time, Lord, an appointed season. And you've brought us together for a purpose. And God, we've come to hear your word, Lord. We've come to have you speak to our hearts, to bring us the word of life, Lord. And God, we pray now as we turn our attention, Lord, to your word. May you come yourself and operate through a vessel and through a gift that you've placed in a body of clay. And may you come with your own hands and break the bread of life and feed us your waiting children. We yield to you. We surrender to you. We open our hearts to you. May you come and feed us that sustaining portion for the hour we live in. As we surrender to you and give you your place, the place of preeminence, may you take it now. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Just want to say God bless you this morning. It's good to be together. Amen. If you want to take your Bibles, we can go ahead and start turning to First Peter. Amen. But as we turn there, I just want to remind you of the watch night service uh this Wednesday. Wednesday at 8. And then we'll have communion somewhere around 11:30. We're going to try to be done as close to midnight as we can so everybody can get home before it gets too late. And also, I want to remind you, we've said it many times. It's been kind of a a tradition or practice of us. If you've got little children and you're bringing them and you want to bring their PJs and a blanket and just let them crash out in the back and sleep, Amen. That's perfectly all right. It's a special night for them, too. They can they can uh get comfortable there and then you can scoop them up, wrap them up, and take them back home. Amen. Just the kids. Just the kids. Amen. Amen. But it'll be fun for them, too. Amen. Amen. Just want to say uh God bless you to a couple of visitors. We got brother Joel and his family. God bless you. It's always good to have you. They're up visiting family and the Cobb kids are here. God bless you guys. It's good to have you. And I looked out and I saw the Peter Shimes. God bless you. It's good to have both of you here as well. And anybody else is visiting. The Fieldings have some family visiting. So, God bless you all. Amen. It's always good to be together. It's always a privilege. Amen. And so we thank God for that privilege. And we never ever want to take it lightly. It's hard not to. It becomes routine, but we don't want it to be routine. We want to take God's blessings and enjoy them. Amen. Let's look at First Peter chapter 4 uh this morning. 1 Peter chapter 4. We'll begin with this. 1 Peter 4 and verse 12. Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you. But rejoice in so much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, that when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy. Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. We're going to look at this scripture for a little bit. And it's it's an interesting scripture. We all know it really, really, really well. We've heard it. I mean, if you've been a Christian for any length of time, you've heard it the entire time duration of your walk with the Lord. But, but still, it hits me with impact every time I read it. Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fire trial. Why is it every time we get a fiery trial, we think it's strange? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I'm I'm the same as you and you're the same as me. Every time it's like, wo is me. What's happening? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. Uh but then the uh just this morning I was in the office back there. I was saying what does fiery trial actually mean? It comes from one word. It's not two words in the Greek fiery trial. It's translated fiery trial but it's translated twice in the New Testament as burning. Once as fiery trial it's used three times and it means the definition they give is a burning the burning by which metals are roasted and reduced by a figure drawn from a refiner's fire. calamities or trials that test the character. And I thought, my goodness. And I was in the back just laughing because it keeps getting worse. You know, you keep reading, it's bad, but then you go to the definition and it gets worse. What is this? It's a burning. It's a fire. I mean, that that burns and reduces metal. This is an intense fire. &gt;&gt; This isn't one that burns your little cordwood. Amen. This is one that will reduce down and melt down metal. That's the kind of fiery trial that he's talking about. So he said, "Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you or test you as though some strange thing happened unto you." Amen. Why are we still thinking it's odd? Amen. That's what he's saying. But listen, but rejoice. But rejoicemen in so much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when the glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy. So, next time you ask yourself, why is this happening to me? Go to verse 13 and says, because I forgot to rejoice. &gt;&gt; God's trying to teach me something. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh, if if you could turn with me to Exodus 15, I'd like to pick up a story here in Exodus 15 and look at at part of the Exodus journey here. And if we could go ahead and pull up the PowerPoint, that'd be great. In Exodus chapter 15, I'm going to start at verse one. And and in Exodus 15:1 is after the Red Sea crossing. So God has delivered them from with a mighty hand out of Egypt. He's redeemed them. Amen. He's showed his glory and his might. They've spoiled Egypt. They've gone out. Then they got stuck in a little bad situation there up against the Red Sea and the armies coming down on them and God parted the Red Sea and brought them across on dry land. And this is this is the response after the waters fell back on the armies of Pharaoh and destroyed the Egyptians. And then verse one verse one then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake saying I will sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. The Lord is my strength and song, and he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will prepare him in habitation. My father's God, and I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war. The Lord is his name. Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea. His chosen captains are also drowned in the Red Sea. So, they're having a rejoicing meeting. They just seen God bring a deliverance that was absolutely supernatural and beyond anything they could have ever dreamed. Amen. When they were sitting up against the Red Sea, hemmed in by mountain range in the Red Sea and Pharaoh's army coming down with the only path of escape that they knew of, they were in a desperate situation. And God performed a a supernatural miracle and and stood the water up as a wall on the right hand and the left. And they walked through on dry ground and got to the other side. And as Pharaoh came pursuing after them, thinking that he can do the same thing. AMEN. GOD CRASHED the walls of water down on them and destroyed them all. And they were thrilled at what they saw God do and began to sing. And Moses wrote a song. Amen. RIGHT ON THE SPOT. And he began singing the song. And and Israel picked it up. Amen. And if you go to verse 20, it says, "And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timber in her hand, and all the women went out out after her with timberalss and with dances. And Miriam answered them, sing answered them, sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously, the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea." So Moses uh instantaneously broke into praise and wrote a song. And then Miriam and all the women picked it up and started answering back in song. They were having a jubilee &gt;&gt; because of what God had done for them. &gt;&gt; So let's go to verse 22. So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shure, and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. And when they came to Mara, they could not drink of the waters of Mara, for they were bitter. Therefore, the name of it was called Mara. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?" And he cried unto the Lord. And the Lord showed him a tree which when he had cast into the suite, there he made for them a statue and an ordinance. And there he proved them, and said, "If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians, for I am the Lord that health thee." &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So they they come out through the Red Sea and they march they march forward three days and within 3 days time they hit their next trial. &gt;&gt; I mean this is an amazing progression through the book of Exodus and through the Exodus journey you find that it's it's out of the kettle and into the frying pan. It's from one thing to another and and and you begin to wonder why and begin to ask questions. But brother Benham and the scriptures so clearly begin to tell us why and begin to open the understanding for that. Amen. Brother Benham says this in Israel and the church. He said after the big song was over, the big shout and having a hallelujah big time, they started through the wilderness and led them right straight to bitter waters. Isn't that strange? Oh my. right into temptation, right into where the waters was bitter and they couldn't drink. They had nothing to eat, nothing to eat, and the waters were bitter. And look, the stream of Mara, bitter waters, lays right in God's path. He was leading his children. Isn't it strange? Look like God would have bypassed that, but he led them right straight up to that water. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were following the pillar of fire. Listen, Moses wasn't just picking a random path and walking wherever he want and happened to bump into bitter waters. It was God who was leading them in the path. He went three days journey following the pillar of fire who brought them right to Mara. Amen. Mara means bitter and to the pools of bitter water that they could not drink. &gt;&gt; And they begin to murmur and they begin to question Moses. And Moses cried out to the Lord. Amen. And and I I just want you to know three days before they saw one of the most tremendous things that had ever happened on the face of the earth &gt;&gt; and a deliverance that was absolutely unbelievable. There's no way anybody could have fathomemed it or imagined it or come up with it in their wildest dreams and God had done it so miraculously and delivered them. And 3 days later they're standing by a pool of water that's too bitter to drink AND THEY START TO DESPAIR and murmur and they don't know what's going to happen to them. &gt;&gt; Where did the song go? &gt;&gt; Where was the praise service? Where was the worship now? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I I don't know if I gave you my title. The bitter waters made sweet. This is what we want to talk about today if God will help us. Amen. Brother Benham says, "Now water represents life." We know that Moses in the wilderness, he smoked the rock and it gave forth waters of life to a perishing people. And I want to talk about the bitter waters. How sometimes life is bitter waters. Sometimes our life can be bitter waters. Amen. But God has a way of making the bittersweet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes you can't bypass the bitter waters of life. Amen. But God has a method. He has a way. He has a solution to the bitter waters. And he can make the bitter waters sweet. &gt;&gt; Not tolerable. &gt;&gt; I hope you catch what I'm saying. He's not going to make the bitter waters tolerable. He's not going to help you to barely scrape through the bitter. He has a way of making bitter water sweet. &gt;&gt; You talk about an extreme, friends. He can make He can take the worst and make it the best. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Hebrews, Hebrews chapter 4, he says, "Now notice, then they came to the wilderness of sin. The waters were bitter." Mara, why did God lead them to bitter waters? Looks like he'd have led them to good water, but he led them to bitter waters so he could prove their faith. Oh, I'm I I just get such a kick out of this stuff. He likes to do it. &gt;&gt; He likes to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was his desire to let them by lead them by the bitter waters. &gt;&gt; And when they got to the bitter waters and they were thirsty and they were perishing, amen, they needed it for life. They had to have it. There was no other option. And when the waters were bitter, they'd gotten into a desperate situation. Amen. And to them, it was terrible. To God, IT WAS EXACTLY THE way he wanted to lead them. Everything was working out perfectly. It was coming right on time. It was going to accomplish this purpose. It was exactly what he led them there to do something for them, to teach them something, to show them something. To God, it was perfect. To them, it was terrible. &gt;&gt; And he led them to bitter waters so he could prove their faith. He likes to do it. He likes Listen, I see this word. &gt;&gt; He likes to let tribulations come on you. &gt;&gt; Show you he can so he can show you his love and his power. &gt;&gt; Why does he like to do it? Because he wants to show you how much he loves you. &gt;&gt; He wants to show you how powerful he is and how much he can deliver and what his power is to deliver. He's trying to show us his love and his great power. How can people today who doesn't believe in a miracle working God when tribulations come they just give up and go on? But we believe that God works miracles. &gt;&gt; Israel should have believed that God could work miracles. They saw the Red Sea. When they come to bitter waters, what are bitter waters? &gt;&gt; HE JUST PARTED THE SEA. HE'S GOT CONTROL OVER THE WATERS. IF HE CAN PART THE RED SEA, HE CAN CERTAINLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT bitter waters. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT THEY FORGOT HE WAS A MIRACLE WORKING GOD. IN THREE DAYS. AMEN. THE TROUBLE CAUSED THE TESTIMONY TO VANISH from their mind. &gt;&gt; And all they could see was the trouble. Oh man, I'm so glad that God sent a prophet and put his word there, gave us all the examples so that we could realize the life we live is perfectly normal. &gt;&gt; Orchestrated by God, led by the pillar of fire. Amen. Listen, every time the pillar of fire led them to some new junction in the journey, some new trial. Amen. Then Israel began to murmur and complain, and then he began to want to stone Moses and complain to Moses, and you've led us here. AND POOR OLD MOSES, what did he do? Amen. HE WAS HIS FATHER. THEY COULD SEE THE CLOUD UP THERE, AND THEY COULD SEE THE FIRE, AND THEY COULD SEE FOLLOWING. AND and &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; they knew Moses didn't decide to go here and go there. He just followed the pillar of fire and all of a sudden, amen, they begin to murmur and complain and get upset. AMEN. BUT THEY DIDN'T REALIZE GOD WANTED TO SHOW THEM SOMETHING ELSE. AND HE WANTS to show them something else. And he wants to show him SOMETHING ELSE AGAIN. AND EVERY STAGE OF THE JOURNEY, GOD WAS TRYING TO SHOW I'M YOUR HEALER. I'm your deliverer. I'M YOUR PROVIDER. I'M EVERYTHING that you need. WE'RE GOING TO MARCH INTO THE PROMISED LAND, AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE SECURE IN ME. YOU'RE GOING TO BE SECURE in my ability to take care of you. &gt;&gt; He likes to do it. Amen. They should have believed he was a miracle working God. When the next trial came, all you have to do is refer back to the previous. &gt;&gt; When the bitter waters come, just to REFER BACK. IF GOD CAN PART WATERS IN A SEA AND make them stand up like a wall on the right hand and the left, he can certainly do something about this. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope we believers still believe he's a work miracle working God. Not just when the prophet was on the scene, but today he's a miracle working God. He has power over the waters. He has power over the circumstance. He can turn the heart of kings like he turns the rivers of water. He's in control. He can rise nations and topple nations. He can change laws. He can change nature. He's a miracle WORKING GOD. NOT WAS, BUT IS. &gt;&gt; And if he ever delivered you for something, he can still deliver you today. NOTHING'S CHANGED WITH GOD. THE CIRCUMSTANCES DOESN'T CHANGE. THE BITTERNESS of the WATER DOESN'T CHANGE THE POWER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Brother Bam says in the message, I know why does God let troubles come? Good question. God harnesses troubles, puts bits in its mouth, and makes it obey him. And those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you ever you've prayed for a closer walk with God? &gt;&gt; Okay, get ready. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; It's the desire of our heart. It's the desire of God's heart. It's what we want. It's what he wants. &gt;&gt; And he knows how to get us there. &gt;&gt; Amen. In in the uh let me go here to James. James chapter 1, he says, "My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations." This is another one of those scriptures. This is another one of those scriptures. We think about things in the Bible that are so grand and so big and so miracle working and gifts in operation and and this is one of the most fundamental simple basic commandments that we're constantly failing at. Count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations, knowing this, that the trying of your faith workketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. So this diverse temptations are doing what? They're trying my faith in a working patience and patience is going to have a perfect work in me. So what is this patience? If we look at the definition of the patience, Amen. uh in the uh definition one down here where it says steadfastness, constancy, endurance in the New Testament, the characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfastly. I think that's what God's trying to get us to. I think this is what the the the this is what the manifold temptations or the trying of our faith are trying to work in us. Patience and patience will have a perfect work. Make us perfect and entire wanting nothing. Amen. What is God? What is God trying to work in us? A people who can endure. &gt;&gt; Be steady. Be stable. And watch God &gt;&gt; watch God move again. Amen. not not go to woe is me every time, but go to the place where you can say, "Listen, I know my redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; I know what he's done before, he can do again." Amen. And so these trials, these constant things are trying to get us to this place of a man who has not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings. patiently and steadfastly say, "Praise God, God's getting us there." &gt;&gt; That's what he was working in Israel. Brother says, "We want everything, just everything, so we can take it easy and retire and take life easy." Is that what you want? &gt;&gt; I'll I'll stand in that line. I mean, &gt;&gt; but brother says life wasn't intended to be easy. &gt;&gt; Life is a struggle. Anything that's got life is a struggling. Look at the trees, how they struggle. Look at everything that's got life. It's a struggle. And when we try to get some kind of a system that takes it easy, then we're wrong. &gt;&gt; And we know there's something wrong. Amen. When we TRY TO TO TRY TO MAKE IT all easy and everything's easy and everything's smooth sailing and everything's great. Amen. We're wrong &gt;&gt; because that's not what God's intended. Amen. God's intended for us to learn, to grow. Amen. To see who he really is. In 1 Corinthians 10, he says, "There hath no temptation taken you, but such is common to man. But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able, but with the temptation will also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it." You know what Paul is telling us? Don't worry, everything's under control. I mean, that's the condensed version, but &gt;&gt; he's telling you, you're not going to get into a tri trial or a temptation that doesn't already have a solution. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. There's already a way of escape. There's already AN ABILITY TO BEAR. GOD'S ALREADY PROVIDED WHAT you need to go through this situation. God has never led you into a situation and then he took off and abandoned you and has no plan. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD NEVER TOOK THEM to the bitter waters of Mara without a plan. &gt;&gt; He never took them to the Red Sea without a plan. He never took them into the wilderness where their food ran out and THEY HAD NO CROPS TO GLEAN. THEY HAD NO FRUITS TO PICK OFF TREES. He never TOOK THEM THERE WITHOUT A PLAN. God always knew what he was going to do. IN EVERY TRIAL AND EVERY TESTING, GOD HAD ALREADY HAD A PLAN. He already had a way of escape so that they were able to bear THROUGH THE TRIAL THAT GOD SAW FIT TO LET COME THEIR WAY. &gt;&gt; So is this if this is true then this is true. &gt;&gt; It's always true. It always will be true. It'll never be a time that this isn't true. &gt;&gt; Amen. So sometimes when we get into the trial, maybe what we NEED TO QUIT DOING IS looking at the trial and start looking away around for the way of escape. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, you know, I can FOCUS ON THE TRIAL ALL DAY LONG, 24/7. AMEN. AND I CAN JUST I can just roll it over in my mind over and over AND OVER. OR I CAN start looking around AND SAYING, "THERE'S NO WAY THAT GOD BROUGHT ME HERE WITHOUT A PROVISION. &gt;&gt; There's a provision for my healing. There's a provision for my deliverance. There's a PROVISION FOR OUR FINANCE. GOD'S GOT A PROVISION SOMEWHERE. There's a way in his word with his spirit to come through." Amen. &gt;&gt; God never led his children to dead end roads without a path. &gt;&gt; Brought him to a dead end, but there was a road under the water. They didn't know that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had already paved it. Amen. He already had it laid out. &gt;&gt; But he just had to reveal it &gt;&gt; at the appropriate time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother goes back here in God's provided way. He said they're down now. When they marched out under there, they got marching orders. They started out when they crossed the bridge, went across, God made a bridge through the bottom of the sea for them. Not exactly where you expect to find a bridge. &gt;&gt; Our bridges normally go over the water. &gt;&gt; But God's bridge can go under the water. &gt;&gt; So don't already get in your mind figured out how God's going to fix it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what throws us off. We get narrow vision AND THINK GOD HAS to do it this way because we're always looking at situations humanistically and we always think a provision will come within our realm of understanding and most of the time God will bring a provision from outside our realm of understanding &gt;&gt; so HE CAN SHOW US HOW POWERFUL he is &gt;&gt; that he's NOT LIMITED TO OUR PERSPECTIVE OUR understanding our vision. AMEN. WE'RE WALKING IN this world with blinders on naturally speaking. AMEN. THAT GOD'S not living with blinders. He can see the end from the beginning. He's got every resource at his fingertips and he already knows what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. They crossed the bridge to the bottom of the sea. When they got over there, when they needed something to drink, the water's all run out. There was a pool there, but the water was bitter. They couldn't drink it. God had a provided tree. He just walked over there, cut the tree down, throwed it into the pool, drink all you want to. God has a provided way. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to Exodus 15 and look at this. And let's go to uh verse 24. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?" And he cried unto the Lord. And the Lord showed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statue and an ordinance. And there he proved them. They come to the bitter waters of Mara. And the people began to murmur because they didn't know how to drink this water. They didn't know what to do. And neither did Moses know what to do. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SHOWED HIM A TREE. a tree &gt;&gt; that IF HE WOULD CUT DOWN THIS TREE AND THROW IT INTO the waters, it would turn the bitter waters sweet. &gt;&gt; When did the tree get there? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; DID GOD ALREADY HAVE A TREE? &gt;&gt; BEFORE THEY HAD A PROBLEM, &gt;&gt; DID GOD PLANT THE TREE AND GROW THE TREE AND have the tree there? When they needed the tree, THE TREE WAS ALREADY THERE. GOD LED THEM TO BITTER WATERS. SO WHAT? IT'S BITTER. THERE'S A PROVISION ON THE BANK OF THE WATER. THE VERY PLACE WHERE you're standing and murmuring and complaining and desparing AND LOSING HEART, THAT VERY PLACE ALREADY HAS A PROVISION PROVIDED BY GOD LONG BEFORE YOU GOT HERE. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW BITTER THE WATERS ARE YOU'RE DRINKING RIGHT NOW. IF YOU STAND NEXT TO THAT POOL AND YOU SAY, "I DON'T SEE ANY WAY. I DON'T KNOW. I can't live like THIS ANY LONGER." JUST KNOW THAT SOMEWHERE RIGHT AROUND THAT TRIAL IS A PROVISION THAT GOD THAT GOD ALREADY PROVIDED BEFORE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY HE'LL NEVER LEAD YOU IN a place. AMEN. WHERE HE'S NOT MADE A WAY OF ESCAPE, AMEN, THAT YOU'RE able to bear. &gt;&gt; HE'S NEVER BROUGHT US ANYWHERE TO DESTROY US. HE'S NEVER BROUGHT US ANYWHERE FOR US TO FAIL. AMEN. EVERYTHING GOD HAS DONE IS TO BUILD US UP, TO SHOW HIS GLORY, TO SHOW HIS LOVE TO US, TO ESTABLISH OUR FAITH, AND TO BRING us into greater endurance and patience to be able to walk this life. &gt;&gt; It's all for our good. And God showed Moses a tree. Oh, I just love the symbolism of the Bible because Christ is that tree. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Amen. If you can't see Christ in every line in the Bible, go back and read it again because he's showing up everywhere. He is that tree. He is the tree of life. HE IS THE ONE. AMEN. That could be thrown into the bitterness of life and make IT SWEET, &gt;&gt; NOT TOLERABLE. &gt;&gt; SWEET, NOT BEARABLE. SWEET. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us. I just say, God, help us to believe the word. &gt;&gt; Not help us to endure. not help us to bear down, but help us to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to take faith. Amen. Brother Be goes on to say, "Now when they were there, the waters were bitter and they couldn't drink. God provided away a little old tree swinging there on the bank. Moses just cut it down and throwed it in the water. Changed the whole thing to good, sweet water. Now, when you come up against one of your bitter waters or something another like that, there's a tree tonight, spiritually speaking, hanging over Galatha or the world tonight that'll sweeten any bitter waters that you may be led by. That's right. That Calvary will sweeten any experience. Many times we get into hard places and wonder how. But I shut my eyes sometimes and I think yonder on Galtha where my redeemer bled and died for my life. Then my trials seem so little I just throw it aside and walked on. It makes it sweet. It sweetens every experience I ever had. &gt;&gt; WHO WAS THAT TREE? WHY WAS THAT TREE SITTING ON THE BANK? AMEN. THAT WAS CHRIST AND A TYPE. AMEN. IT was a foreshadow of the tree that would bring bitter TO SWEET, &gt;&gt; DEATH TO LIFE. AMEN. AMEN. AND I CAN IMAGINE, AMEN. AND THEY'RE ALL UH UH GATHERED AROUND THE WATERS AND somebody takes a sip and they smell it and they OH WE CAN'T DRINK. OH, THIS IS HORRIBLE. OH, WHY ARE WE HERE? OH, WHY DID YOU LEAD US HERE? OH, MOSES. OH, GOD. OH, WE'RE IN DESPAIR. OH, EVERYTHING'S RUINED. WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE. &gt;&gt; And God was sitting in the tree &gt;&gt; just waiting. &gt;&gt; The provision's already here. I'm here. &gt;&gt; You haven't noticed me yet, but I'm here. Right? &gt;&gt; You're not aware of it, but I'm the solution to your problem. &gt;&gt; I mean, how many times they walked around it? HOW MANY TIMES THEY BRUSHED UP AGAINST IT? AND THEY IGNORED IT. THEY ABSOLUTELY IGNORED THE PROVISION. &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T NOTICE IT. THEY DIDN'T SEE THAT GOD ALREADY HAD A PROVIDED WAY. BUT GOD SHOWED MOSES. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SHOW MOSES? AMEN. BY VISION. SO, BY REVELATION, all of a sudden, MOSES GOT A REVELATION. THERE'S A PROVISION RIGHT HERE, FRIENDS. GOD HAS NOT LED US SOMEWHERE THAT HE'S NOT MADE A PROVISION. AND HE SHOWED HIM A TREE THAT IF YOU CUT DOWN THE TREE AND THROW IT IN THE WATERS, IT MAKES THE WATERS SWEET. &gt;&gt; OH, LISTEN. I don't care where you are in life. Amen. There's a tree. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what's happening. AMEN. IN YOUR LIFE, NO MATTER HOW BITTER IT TASTES, AMEN, THERE'S A TREE. THERE'S A PROVISION. THERE'S SOMETHING. IF GOD CAN JUST GIVE A REVELATION OF WHERE the solution is, AND HE IS ALWAYS THE SOLUTION. &gt;&gt; THE SOLUTION IS ALWAYS CHRIST EVERY TIME, 100% OF THE TIME, he is always the solution. &gt;&gt; He comes as a tree. He comes in another way through a different trial. HE COMES SOME OTHER WAY. AMEN. But it's always him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Brother Bam says, "Now remember, he is that tree of life. Contrary to the serpent seed, he is that seed, the woman's seed, the tree of life in the garden. Unless they put forth their hands and move this tree, they'd eat that tree and live forever." And he's the only tree that can be taken that you can live forever. His word is life. And that and that be the word then, the word of God, which Eve turned down in the Garden of Eden. Then here is Christ, the word made manifest. And when he come on earth, he was the tree of life. Do you believe that? And Rome, what did they do? &gt;&gt; THEY CHOPPED DOWN the tree. WHY DID THEY CHOP DOWN THE TREE? TO TAKE THE BITTERNESS OUT OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LIFE HAD BECOME BITTER BECAUSE of hybridization. AMEN. BECAUSE A FALLEN CONDITION. AMEN. WE WERE STUCK AND TRAPPED IN A CYCLE OF DEATH AND DETERIORATION. AMEN. BUT WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY CHOPPED DOWN THE TREE OF LIFE AND HUNG IT ON A TREE IN GALATHA TO DO WHAT? TO SWEETEN THE WATERS OF OUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; TO REVERSE THE DAMAGE, TO MAKE THE BITTER SWEET. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And Rome, what did they do? HE HAD TO BE CHOPPED DOWN. And he was put on a tree of disgrace. Curses he that hang on a tree became a curse for the human race. Amen. The tree was chopped down so the bitter waters could be made sweet. So the promise could be confirmed. So redemption could be purchased. &gt;&gt; So that we could be brought back to what we were always intended to be. &gt;&gt; To take the bitterness out of life. Let's turn to Second Kings chapter 4 together. Oh, don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love his provisions? Don't you love how he's hiding in every trial &gt;&gt; there waiting for our eyes to come open? &gt;&gt; I wish that I could change just myself overnight. &gt;&gt; I wish that I could go into my programming, &gt;&gt; change a few lines of code. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can't do that. But I'm depending on his spirit to lead me into the things that are right by his word. &gt;&gt; To where I no longer go to despair every time something happen something happens in life, but where I begin to start going on a scavenger hunt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every time I hit a bitter pool of water. Amen. Um Oh, he's here somewhere. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's He's here somewhere. cuz he promised he'd never leave me. He promised he'd never forsaken me. He promised he'd be my guide and my leader. And he hasn't quit the job. Amen. SO, THE PILLAR OF fire has led me here. If he's led me here, he's already got a provision. And if this is bitter water, THEN HE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING TO SHOW HOW MUCH HE LOVES ME AND SHOW HIS POWER TO ME. AND INSTEAD OF LOOKING at the water AND MOURNING OVER THE WATER, I'M GOING TO START SCANNING THE BANKS and say, "Somewhere, &gt;&gt; somewhere there's a provision." &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF EVERY TIME WE ENTER INTO A TRIAL, WE CAN QUICKLY SWITCH SWITCH OUR MIND OVER FROM BITTER WATERS TO THERE'S A TREE HERE SOMEWHERE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A PROVISION. GOD IS HIDING IN THIS TRIAL SOMEWHERE. AND WHEN I FIND WHERE HE'S AT, WHEN I FIND WHERE CHRIST IS IN THE TRIAL, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE'S GOING TO TURN THE TRIAL SWEET AND I'M GOING TO SEE CHRIST WORKING IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; Second Kings chapter 4 verse 38. And Elisha came again to Gilgal, and there was a darth in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. And he said unto his servant, "Set on the great pot, and seize pottage for the sons of the prophets. And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered there of wild gourds, his lap full, and came and came and shred them into the pot pottage, for they knew them not." Oh my goodness. Praise God. keeps getting better. &gt;&gt; Uh, so they poured out for the men to eat and it came to pass as they were eating of the pottage that they cried out and said, "Oh, thou men of God, there is death in the pot." And they could not eat thereof. But he said, "Then bring meal." And he cast it into the pot. AND HE SAID, "POUR out for the people that they may eat." And there was no harm in the pot. &gt;&gt; Amen. They come up to another trial. Amen. where they they they made a mistake and they gathered the wrong ingredients and put the wrong ingredients into the pot and the pot was supposed to be life. It was supposed to be food for nourishment and strength and for life and what was meant to be life became death. And brother Brandham shows this. This is what happens in the seminaries. Amen. They were up there in a seminary and somebody had put something in that wasn't healthy. &gt;&gt; ADDED TO THE WORD, ADDED MAN'S IDEAS. AMEN. THEY PUT SOMETHING in and they didn't know what it was and they were confused themselves and they added IN AND NOW IT BROUGHT DEATH. BUT THERE WAS A PROPHET ON THE SCENE AND A PROPHET ON THE SCENE COULD CATCH THE VISION of how to turn death into life. &gt;&gt; TURN POISON INTO HEALTH. AMEN. WHAT WOULD KILL INTO WHAT WILL SUSTAIN LIFE. AMEN. AND WHAT DID HE DO? HE TOOK A BUNCH OF MEAL. HE SAID, "BRING MEAL." AND BROTHER BAM SAID CHRIST is the meal offering. Amen. And the meal offering is A TYPE OF CHRIST BECAUSE HE'S THE GRAIN AND EVERY THE BUR IS CERTAIN WAY THAT it grinds everything TO THE SAME BECAUSE HE'S THE same yesterday, today, and forever. Cuz the word IS ALWAYS THE SAME IN every age. &gt;&gt; And the word, THE MEAL OFFERING, AMEN, WILL ALWAYS HEAL THE POISON. &gt;&gt; And he bring me meal. He threw it in and HE SAID, "POUR OUT to the people." And there was no harm in the pot. Brother Bam said the meal offering was Christ. Every burr had to be set the same and every little piece of meal had to be ground the same for the meal offering showing that he is the healer. He sub he substitutes and takes away death and puts life by the two laws. Hallelujah. There where death is one place when Christ comes in life comes in. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And where there was death, there became life because that Christ was brought in the meal offering. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says it again this way. You remember when some of the schools up there didn't know the difference between gourds and peas and throw some wild gourds in a pottage of peas to cook and they cried out, "There is death in the pot." Elijah got a handful of meal and cast it into the pot and said, "Eat." What did the meal do? The meal in the pot changed it from death to life. From a deathgiving resource to a lifegiving resource. That's the same thing it is tonight where there's death in your vessel. Christ throwed into your vessel brings you from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Christ makes the difference coming into the human heart. He gives a peace that passes understanding and also it gives eternal life. He that believeth on the son has eternal life and shall never perish. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ is still the tree that can be thrown into the bitter waters of life. He's still the meal offering that can be thrown into the pot. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ through the Bible comes in many forms, through many types, in many shadows, many ways. Even after his resurrection, Amen. He appeared as a gardener to Mary. But then on the road to Emmas, he appeared to them in another form. &gt;&gt; He showed himself AS PILLAR OF FIRE TO PAUL. &gt;&gt; You see, Christ is always around. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's always the provision. He's always present. Amen. But but he can hide himself in a tree by the bank of the water, in a handful of meal offering. He can hide himself &gt;&gt; anywhere in your trial. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he wants to. &gt;&gt; He can be in a brother and sister. He can be in a stranger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can be he can be anywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why for me, I want life to become more exciting. &gt;&gt; When the trials come, because they're going to come, you're not going to stop them. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire led them from one to another to another to another. &gt;&gt; Who led pillar of fire? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who's leading now? The pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Well, today he's going to bypass all the trials like We have a better understanding and he's kind of different now than he No, &gt;&gt; he's going to lead us from trial to trial to trial. But oh, if every trial could be a new scavenger hunt, &gt;&gt; if every trial could be a new new game of hideand seek. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where is he? Show me, Lord. Where are you hiding in this trial? Because I know you haven't led me here without a provision. &gt;&gt; I know we haven't come here in vain. I know I'm not here without a purpose. God, would you show yourself to me? &gt;&gt; Amen. like you did to Moses. Amen. Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; I want to read this quote. A testimony on the sea. Said, brother Bram tells this whole story, a testimony on the sea about the disciples getting in a boat and Jesus going to the mountain to pray and them crossing, amen, the Sea of Galilee. And he says, it must have been getting late. They had a great meeting that day. The sun was going down, setting across the little Galilee lake, and they was all tired. They were worn out. A great day meeting people. He said, "I'm making this a drama so the children can catch it. I'm glad he made it a drama so I could catch it &gt;&gt; cuz I'm one of the babes." &gt;&gt; And everybody was weary and tired. And I can see the great brrawy backs of the big fisherman as he tugged at the boat, pushing it out across the sand until he got in the water so that it could it would float in the water, climbed up into the stern of the boat and took a seat by the side of his brother Andrew. And all on the bank there must have been thousands of people, all some of them wiping their eyes from tears and saying, "Come back, see us again. Bring him back." Amen. Brother said, "This is the end of a great meeting." And he even begins to talk AND HE SAYS, "ALWAYS WHEN YOU'VE had a great meeting, you've seen God do great things. It's always hard to separate from the people." And that's what Brother Ram's showing us here in this drama. They're having to separate now. And they're saying, "Come back." And they're wiping their eyes. They had seen God do marvelous things. &gt;&gt; And brother goes on to say, "But this was real smooth." Talking about the water that day. It was a beautiful day. And the old sea was just as quiet, not a riffle in it. And what a pleasure it must have been to dip those ores down into that fresh water and bend those back to that. And just in time each ore, it's like a rhythm when they when they make two or three ores and somebody would stop and all them wave goodbye and on and on till the little group on the bank begin to get smaller and smaller to them and the little boat got smaller and smaller as they went out. Finally, they were passing each other out into the sea. The sun was getting well down now. Just red streaks up in the sky from the sun from the distant Galilean mountains. And this where brother Brennham begins to break into more of the story. They're going along and it's a beautiful day. It's a beautiful afternoon. The meeting is over. Jesus sent them across. He went up to pray and the the the the the lake is as smooth as glass. It couldn't have been better. They're rowing across and THEY WOULD JUST STOP every two or three rows and wave back to the people and it was a glorious and then they start sharing testimonies but John starts it off and brother said it must have been John starting it off and John says brothers I want to testify for a minute and he says you know all my life my my mom used to uh take me up and tell me the stories and she told me the Exodus STORY AND HOW GOD WHEN they were in the wilderness and they had no bread and they were starving Amen. HOW GOD BROUGHT BREAD. AND AS a little boy, I used TO ASK, "OH, MOMMY, DOES GOD HAVE ANGELS up there with big ovens? Did he bake all that bread for them?" And his MAMA WOULD SAY, "OH, GOD'S A MIRACLE WORKING GOD. HE doesn't need angels baking ovens. God just provided." &gt;&gt; AND THEN JOHN'S SAYING, "DID YOU SEE, BROTHERS, WHAT WHAT THE LORD DID TODAY? HE TOOK those loaves and he took those fishes and he broke that BREAD AND HE FED 5,000. HE SAID, "ISN'T THIS THE same one? Yeah. &gt;&gt; ISN'T THIS THE SAME GOD THAT PROVIDED FOR 5,000 PLUS men women and children in the desert? ISN'T THIS THE SAME ONE THAT WAS THERE leading them in in in the Exodus providing mana for them then? And then Andrew says, "LET ME TESTIFY. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT I saw and what happened to me." And then Peter and then different ones, they begin to testify. &gt;&gt; They begin to share what they had seen in the campaign, what the Lord was doing. And it WAS BEGINNING TO DAWN on them who this was in their midst. AMEN. THIS IS THE SAME LIFE, THE SAME POWER, THE SAME ONE. WE'RE SEEING THE same things. THE THE BLIND BARAMEUS, HIS EYES CAME OPEN, THE LAME, AMEN, ARE LEAPING. ISN'T THIS THE PROPHECY being fulfilled? And they begin to testify &gt;&gt; of what God has done. And as they were testifying, Brother Bam says it this way. He said, "Oh, the testimony meeting was just getting stirred up good." Oh, and you know, the devil happened to look down across the hill and found them without Jesus. They'd went off without him. That's when the devil had his chance. He said, "Now I've got my opportunity to sink them because they've gone on with without their master." And what does he do? He brings a a great storm up. in the storm. Amen. Begins to toss the boat about and begins to to to to take them beyond their capability of handling it. &gt;&gt; They were fishermen. &gt;&gt; They were professional fishermen. &gt;&gt; They fished generationally for a living. Amen. They knew the boat. They knew the ship. Brother Bam said they knew just how to handle it. Amen. But the storm WAS SO GREAT, THE TRIAL WAS SO INTENSE, it took them beyond their natural capabilities. And they began to despair for their life. They began to lose all hope. Amen. And that's where brother Bam says this. He says all hopes was gone. But you know what? He was still watching them. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he climbed up the mountain and he was standing up there watching them, seeing what they was that that they was in trouble. I'm so glad that grace is still in existence. If it wasn't, we'd all be gone. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY JUST THOUGHT HE WASN'T THERE. AND THEY THOUGHT HE COULDN'T HELP. AND THEY THOUGHT HE WASN'T NEAR. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SEPARATED AND FAR AWAY and removed. Amen. From the hand of the Lord. THE ONE THAT THEY'D JUST BEEN TESTIFYING ABOUT. The one who turned the bread and broke THE THE THE FIVE LOAVES OF BREAD AND FED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THEY WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW GREAT HE WAS. THE ONE WHO OPENED BLIND BARNAMEUS'S EYES. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW GREAT he was. Amen. And then they get into this situation WHERE ANOTHER TRIAL COMES UP THAT'S bigger than they expected. That's beyond their capabilities. That's more intense than anything they could handle. Brother Brandon said THE SAILS WERE TORN. AMEN. The ores were broke. AMEN. THEY HAD NO OTHER MEANS and no other ability. And they began to lose all hope and despair for life because they didn't realize he has a provision in this, too. &gt;&gt; He's still watching. He still knows. And he knows what he's going to do. Yeah. &gt;&gt; NOT FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION, BUT HE'S GOING TO INCREASE THEIR FAITH. HE'S GOING TO SHOW HIMSELF MIGHTY ON THEIR BEHALF. HE'S GOING TO SHOW THEM. HE'S GOING TO CONFIRM EVERYTHING they've been witnessing AND TALKING ABOUT. THIS TRIAL IS GOING TO BE THE CONFIRMATION OF EVERYTHING they've been saying. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. He begins to testify. Brother Bam says, "What happened when the dark hour come along and they realized they had not had him with them and the first thing you know here he come walking to them on the sea? The only thing that could help them and what did they do? They cried out. They were scared of him." Now listen close. This is so good. They were afraid. Scared of the only thing that could help them &gt;&gt; because it looked spooky. They said, "He's a spirit. That's a spirit walking in the water." Nothing could do that but a spirit. Oo, they were scared. And the only hopes they had, they were afraid of. That's the same thing tonight. The only hope of the coming of the Lord Jesus is appearing amongst the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the ministry of brother Bam. That was the son of man ministry in a son of man. And it was scaring people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they seen it. They they went to call it mental telepathy. They went to call it fortuneelling. They want to call it every kind of devil that they can be called. And it's the only thing that can help you. What was the voice that came from him? Fear not. &gt;&gt; Fear not. Be of good courage. It is I. Looked kind of scary at first, but it is I. Be not afraid. Now, we've had a lot of testimony meetings and we see what's happened to the church. Don't be scared. He's still God. He's just as much God as he ever was. Do you believe that? The same testimony that he was of them in that day, he can believe. We can believe that him being the same testimony to us today. Can't you believe that? &gt;&gt; It is. You may get into a situation. You and I get into him all the time where we can't see God. We can't feel God. We don't know he's there. It feels like he's a million miles away. Amen. And that's how they FELT IN THEIR TRIAL. HE WASN'T THERE. AMEN. Within arms reach. They couldn't talk to him. They couldn't GO AND PHYSICALLY GRAB HIM. They didn't know. But he was watching THEM THE WHOLE TIME, WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME to make his appearance. Amen. So that he can get the maximum benefit OUT OF THIS TRIAL FOR their sakes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 6:18 says this, "And the sea arose by reason of great wind that blew. So when they had rode about five and 20 or 30 furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea. And drawing nigh to the ship, and they were afraid, but he saith unto them, it is I. Be not afraid. Then they willingly received him into the ship. And immediately the ship was at the land whether they went. &gt;&gt; A swamped boat with broken sail and broken oars. &gt;&gt; He was the provision. HE WAS THE ANSWER. ALL THEY NEEDED WAS TO WATCH FOR HIM. AND WHEN HE CAME, they received him into the boat. And when they received him into the boat, instantly they WERE AT THEIR DESTINATION. THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED. EVERYTHING WAS FINE. THEY WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE PROVISION. AND THE VERY PROVISION SCARED THEM AT FIRST. THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THIS LOOKS SCARY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. WHY IS IT HAPPENING THIS WAY? THIS LOOKS LIKE A BAD THING. BUT IT WAS THE VERY thing that they needed. It was him coming on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "It is I. Be not afraid. Don't be scared. I've been watching you. Don't be scared. I've got a provision." DON'T BE SCARED. I WAS ALWAYS GOING TO DELIVER YOU FROM THIS. I WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BRING YOU THROUGH THIS TRI. I WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BRING YOU TO THE OTHER SIDE. AMEN. I TOLD YOU TO GET IN THE BOAT TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE. I WILL TAKE CARE OF GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hey, listen. We do what we can. We try with the ores and we try with the sail AND WE TRY. BUT SOMETIMES WE COME to the end of any of our mental power, our ability, even sometimes to the end of our willpower. We've come to the end of all of our reasonings. We've come to the end OF OUR STRENGTH. AND sometimes you just lay in bed at night with tears rolling down your tree cheek and say, "God, I can't do it one more day." AMEN. BUT INSTEAD OF GOING THERE, WHY DON'T WE GO TO GOD? I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. YOU HAVEN'T led me here in vain. You've never forsaken your children. You've promised TO LEAD AND GUIDE ME. YOU'VE PROMISED TO BE WITH ME ALWAYS. AMEN. WHY CAN'T WE LAY IN BED AND TURN EVIL INTO GOOD? WHY CAN'T WE TAKE AND BEGIN TO CONFESS THE WORD AND AND AND AND PREDICT GOOD, NOT EVIL? &gt;&gt; AMEN. Why can't we be believers &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT THE WORD? Let's believe the word &gt;&gt; instead of just GOING TO A SERMON AND HAVING IT PREACHED AND SAYING, "THAT'S NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, BROTHER." AND THE NEXT TRIAL WE FALL TO PIECES AND FALL TO A A LUMP OF CLAY ON THE GROUND. WHY DON'T WE GO AND TAKE THE WORD AND SAY, "HE'LL NEVER leave me. HE'LL NEVER FORSAKE ME. HE PROMISED TO BE WITH ME ALWAYS. He's going to come on the scene. IF HE WALKS ON THE WATER, IF HE opens the Red Sea, if he becomes the meal offering, if he's the TREE IN THE WATER, I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'LL COME, BUT I'M LOOKING FOR him to come on the scene. YES. &gt;&gt; I'M CALLING FOR HIM TO COME ON THE SCENE. LORD, I need rescued. LORD, I NEED YOU. GOD, SHOW ME LIKE YOU SHOWED MOSES. WHERE IS YOUR PROVISION? &gt;&gt; AMEN. There going to come a time this bride's going to be a believer of the word. NOT JUST A CONFESSOR, but a believer of the word. And she's going to act LIKE IT AND TALK LIKE IT AND STAND ON IT. &gt;&gt; SHE'S GOING TO HAVE PATIENCE. PATIENCE IS going to do a perfect work where SHE THAT THIS BRIDE CAN ENDURE THROUGH EVERY TRIAL BEING STEADFAST AND FAITHFUL TO THE word &gt;&gt; and you wonder why we go from trial to trial because that's the goal &gt;&gt; to trust the Lord to trust his word to stand fast upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I confess I'm not where I want to be &gt;&gt; but I can confess I'm not what I used to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is molding us and growing us and changing us. Friends, &gt;&gt; if we just keep our eyes focused on what's important if we just change our expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do we always expect bad to happen? And why do we always expect to fail? &gt;&gt; I mean, we should expect trials. &gt;&gt; That's a fair expectation. &gt;&gt; But why can't we expect in every trial God's going to do something wonderful? &gt;&gt; That this is the next best thing that's ever happened to me. right? &gt;&gt; Instead of the next worst thing in a line of bad things. And I'm just going to chalk this up as another horrible thing so that every time I'm around people and I need sympathy, I'll talk about this one again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's look for every child to go into our bag of testimonies. &gt;&gt; I want it to go from the bag of trial to the bag of testimonies. &gt;&gt; And it's going to go from the bag of trial to the bag of testimonies when Christ comes on the scene. So, where is he? Where is he at? Is he on the bank of the river? Is he in the meal offering? Is he going to come walking on the water? I don't know how he's going to come, but he's going to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. OH, THAT'S JOYFUL EXPECTATION. That's hope. AMEN. THAT'S A POSITIVE OUTLOOK. That's faith in the word. That's believing in the integrity of our God. &gt;&gt; Why would we expect him not to keep his word? &gt;&gt; Amen. In Hebrews 13, he says, "Let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things as you have, for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it true for you? &gt;&gt; I mean, it's one thing for it to be true. It's something else for it to be true to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, everybody knew it was true that a virgin shall conceive. Everybody in Israel, &gt;&gt; they've been taught all their lives. They all knew that it was true. A virgin shall conceive. &gt;&gt; But to Mary, that truth was different &gt;&gt; than what it was to everybody else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That wasn't a scripture to believe that was her life now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, this isn't a scripture to believe. This is our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is TO BE FLESHED OUT IN US. is to be made manifest in you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody believes. Everybody's a Christian. Do you believe Hebrews 13? Absolutely, I believe it. But how do you believe it? Do you believe it as an intellectual exercise? Do you believe it as part of a sermon? Or do you believe it experimentally in your in your life every day that this is the truth? He will never leave me nor forsake me. &gt;&gt; We say we believe it, BUT WHY DO WE ACT like he left us and forsook us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Matthew, he says, go you therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, &gt;&gt; even to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Is there an expiration date &gt;&gt; on all way? &gt;&gt; John 14, I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. Who's Who's this eye? It's Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit. Yet a little while and the world sees me no more, but ye see me. Because I live, you shall live also. At that day you shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in me, and I in you. &gt;&gt; Is that true? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's true. Is it always true? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother said, "And maybe tonight you're a little sick just to have a little child training, just a little testing. Don't be discouraged." Oh, praise God. Can we say this? Don't be discouraged. Listen, if you're sick, it's discouraging. If you're hurting, it's discouraging. &gt;&gt; But Brother Brandham says it's just child training. God's just teaching us to overcome. He's teaching us to endure. He's teaching us to stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged. God's on the throne. He knows all things. If you were truly born of the spirit of God, everything's working for our good. He's going to make everything right. He promised he would. He swore he would. He's got to keep that word. He's kept it now for thousands of years to every believer. Would you be any exception? No, sir. We're no exception. &gt;&gt; So, let's not act like we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to the book of Ruth. Turn with me to the book of Ruth, please. Oh, I just get so excited at the word. It corrects me. It shapes me. It teaches me. &gt;&gt; Amen. It It shaves me down. And And I need shaving down. All right. Ruth chapter 1 and verse 19. Ruth 1 19. So they too went unto the went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass when they were come to Bethlehem that all the city was moved about them. And they said, "Is this Naomi?" And she said unto them, "Call me not Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me." This is the same word as the waters of Mara. &gt;&gt; The same word for bitter. Call me not Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. I went out full, and the Lord has brought me home again empty. Why then call you me Naomi seeing the Lord hath testified against me and the Almighty hath afflicted me? Listen, she her name I don't remember the name her name right now. I just looked it up, but I think it it means blessed or something like that. And she says, "Why are you calling me blessed? Call me bitter." &gt;&gt; And look at the accusation against God. The Lord hath dealt bitterly with me. My life is now bitter. Don't call me Naomi. Don't call me anything pleasant. Call me Mara. And this is the way Ruth felt. Amen. And she might not be the only one who's ever felt this way. Amen. But we know the story of Ruth and we know the story of redemption and we know a kinsman redeemer and Boaz and Ruth and all of these things. But when we get to the end of the story, when we go to chapter 4, turn with me to chapter 4, verse 13. The end of the story. At the end of this book, it says, "So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife. And when he went unto her, the Lord gave her conception, and she bare a son. And the woman said unto Naomi, the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the Lord, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel. And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age. For thy daughter-in-law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him." And Naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became nurse to it. At the end of the story, what does Naomi receive? She receives Christ. &gt;&gt; Christ showed up in another form in this story. Amen. He was the baby born of the gentile bride. Amen. Through the kinsman redeemer. Amen. The one that's going to be the restorer of Israel. And now Naomi, SHE GOES AND DISASTER STRIKES HER LIFE. SHE COMES BACK EMPTY. She said, "I went full and I come back empty." Well, she had left the word. Her husband had left the word. Amen. And she comes back. HER LIFE IS BITTERNESS. BUT GOD ALWAYS knew what he was going to do. God had a plan from the beginning. And God was going TO GIVE NAOMI CHRIST IN A PREFIGURE. She was going to receive Christ. &gt;&gt; And she WENT DOWN THIS ROAD. AMEN. SO HE COULD SHOW HIMSELF MIGHTY ON HER BEHALF. SO GOD COULD BRING REDEMPTION in a way she never imagined redemption coming. Amen. SHE SHE LOOKED AT HERSELF. AMEN. AND SHE SAYS, "I CAN'T DO IT." SHE TOLD RUTH, "LISTEN, YOU YOU AND YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG. Go marry again. I'M TOO OLD. ARE YOU GOING TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER SON TO COME? THERE'S NO HOPE OF REDEMPTION. THERE'S NO way to GET OUT OF THIS TRIAL. I'M TOO OLD. AMEN. IF I MARRY AGAIN, IF I HAVE A BABY, ARE YOU GOING TO WAIT 18 years? &gt;&gt; Past your time." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; She couldn't see a solution anywhere. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But God showed up. &gt;&gt; He was always there. Where was Christ? He was in Boaz, the kinsman redeemer. Christ was on the scene. They came TO BETHLEHEM AND THEY STARTED GLEANING. WHERE? Where did THEY START GLEANING? WHERE DID THEY START PICKING UP LITTLE BITS OF FOOD JUST TO SURVIVE ONE DAY? IN BOAZ'S FIELD, HE WAS THE TREE STANDING BY THE SIDE OF THE WATER. HE WAS WAITING TO BE CUT DOWN AND THROWN INTO THE WATER. HE WAS THERE TO TAKE THE BITTER AND MAKE IT SWEET. IT WAS CHRIST, THE KINSMAN REDEEMER. &gt;&gt; HE WAS ALWAYS THERE. HE WAS AN OLD MAN. HE HAD NO SEED. HE WAS SITTING THERE waiting himself. &gt;&gt; GOD HAD ALREADY PROVIDED FOR NAOMI, BUT SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS FINISHED. SHE WAS DONE. ALL HOPES are over. SHE GOES BACK INTO THE PROMISED LAND, WHICH SHE SHOULD HAVE NEVER LEFT. SHE COMES BACK TO THE WORD. SHE'S COMING BACK TO THE WORD, NOT SAYING, "OH, I'VE COME BACK TO THE MESSAGE. I'VE COME BACK TO THE CHURCH. EVERYTHING'S FINE." SHE COMES BACK SAYING, "EVERYTHING'S OVER. EVERYTHING'S FINISHED. I've ruined everything and my life IS NOW BITTER." AND SHE HAS NO IDEA. Sweetness is coming. &gt;&gt; SWEETNESS IS COMING CUZ SHE'S COME BACK TO THE WORD. AND COMING BACK TO THE WORD, GOD ALWAYS HAD A PROVISION. IT WAS ALREADY there in THE KINSMAN REDEEMER. AND NOW the birth from the kinsman redeemer and THE GENTILE BRIDE WAS GOING TO PRODUCE a baby. And that baby was going to be given to Naomi. And this was GOING TO BE CHRIST TO NAOMI. AND Naomi in HER TRIAL RECEIVED CHRIST. AND HE TURNED THE BITTER into sweetness. And the women said, "HE WILL BE A RESTORER OF THY LIFE AND A NOURISHER of thy old age. He will be a blessing to you. &gt;&gt; He was there all along." &gt;&gt; You just had to find him. &gt;&gt; Had to catch a revelation of where he was. Oh, praise God almighty. Praise God Almighty. Are you happy to serve God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to look at one more scripture. &gt;&gt; And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again. And so go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. And I went unto the angel, and I said unto him, "Give me the little book." And he said unto me, "Take it and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." Amen. This now is the book of redemption. There's a book that is offered to the bride in the end time. But there's there there in the scripture, he tells us that this book is going to have an effect on our lives. And when we're receiving the book, when we're when we're taking it in, when we're when we're eating it, it'll be sweet in our mouths. &gt;&gt; But in our belly, when we go, brother Benson said, when you go to digest it, when you have to live it, when you face the rejection that comes with this message, it'll be bitter in thy belly. &gt;&gt; Amen. Has anybody experienced that? &gt;&gt; But the prophet says something else that I want to share with you that's amazing to me. He says, "And this sevenfold book of seven redemption plans has been brought to us." And that's what this book holds. Now, we're going to get it over in the 10th chapter where this mighty angel proclaimed something. And he had a little book that John had to eat. And when he did, he got it into his belly and it was bitter. But in his lips, it was sweet. When you have to digest it, then it gets bitter. Everybody's against you. everybody telling you're a holy roll or you're this that or the other. You're you're off your head. So, it's hard to digest it. But when you're testifying of his glory, it's sweet in your lips. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're going to get somewhere now. That's all. And when you stand up in the meeting, say, "Glory to God. Hallelujah." Oh, when you're going through that great siege, it's hard. But then when you're out of that great seed, you can testify of it. Then it's sweet in the lips. Brother Benham told us that this book that we can eat, which is the book of redemption, which is the revelation of the hour. Amen. Which is THE MYSTERY OF GOD. AMEN. When we take that in, it's sweet in our mouth. When we when we receive the revelation of it, it's everything. It's life. AMEN. IT TAKES the bitterness of life and makes it sweet. It takes the MISUNDERSTANDING OF OUR LIFE AND PUTS IT IN PERSPECTIVE AND SHOWS US WE'RE CHILDREN of God. WE WERE ALWAYS PART OF GOD. WE COME FROM GOD. WE'RE GOING BACK TO GOD. IT'S SWEET in the eating. Amen. But when WE HAVE TO DIGEST it and start to live this manifestation with the rejection and the ridicule AND THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS ALL AROUND, it becomes bitter. But listen, the bitter BE CAN BECOME SWEET AGAIN. HOW do you take the bitter in the belly and make it sweet again? Get it out OF YOUR BELLY AND PUT IT BACK ON YOUR LIPS. AND WHEN YOU PUT IT BACK ON YOUR LIPS, IT'S SWEET ALL OVER AGAIN. TESTIFY OF WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN YOU. TALK ABOUT THIS WORD. TALK ABOUT THE MESSAGE. TESTIFY OF THE GOODNESS OF GOD AND THE TESTIMONY OF THE CONTENTS OF THIS BOOK WILL TAKE THE BITTER IN THE BELLY AND MAKE IT sweet again. &gt;&gt; KEEP EATING THE BOOK. IT'S SWEET. GOT TO LIVE IT. IT'S BITTER. TESTIFY OF IT. IT'S SWEET AGAIN. AMEN. CHRIST IN YOU. CHRIST THE WORD IN EVERY SITUATION makes the bitter sweet. &gt;&gt; TESTIFY OF HIM. TALK ABOUT HIM. AMEN. TELL THE WORLD. AMEN. WHAT'S MADE YOUR BITTERSWEET? &gt;&gt; AMEN. The problem is when we get in the bitterness IN LIFE AND BITTERNESS IN LIVING THE WORD AND BITTERNESS AND REJECTION AND bitterness and misunderstanding AND THE BITTERNESS AND TRIALS. AMEN. THEN ALL WE DO IS TALK ABOUT BITTERNESS AND THE ONLY THING ON OUR LIPS is bitterness. &gt;&gt; BITTER IN, BITTER OUT. EVERYTHING IS BITTER. BUT OH, IF WE'LL JUST FORGET ABOUT THE BITTERNESS AND JUST TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT HE IS, WHAT THIS WORD IS TO ME, WHAT THE REVELATION HAS DONE IN MY LIFE, WHAT GOD HAS REVEALED TO ME AND WHAT this message IS AND WHAT GOD IS DOING, IT TURNS TO BITTERSWEET ALL OVER AGAIN. &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE? WORST DAY, HAVING A TERRIBLE DAY, EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG AND SOMEBODY AT WORK ASKKED YOU A question &gt;&gt; and you don't want to talk to them. You don't want to share the word. You want everybody to leave you alone. And all of a sudden they start drawing it out and you start telling them, you know, the word says this and God this and there's a provision here and here's my testimony. This is what God did for me. And all of a SUDDEN THE BITTER DAY JUST TURNS SWEET. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY WERE IN A TESTIMONY ON THE SEA. THEY WERE TESTIFYING OF THE GOODNESS OF GOD, THE MIRACLES THEY HAD SEEN. AND THEN THEY GO INTO A BITTER SITUATION. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TESTIMONY MEETING? WHY DID IT STOP? WHY DID THEY STOP CONFESSING HIS GREATNESS? WHY DID THEY STOP CONFESSING THE MIRACLES? WHY DID THEY STOP? BECAUSE THE TRIAL WAS SO OVERWHELMING, THEY STOPPED THE TESTIMONY MEETING. THE TESTIMONY MEETING WOULD HAVE KEPT THE BITTERSWEET. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT HAPPENED ON THE SIDE UH OF THE RED SEA? THEY PLAYED THE TAMBOURINE. THEY DANCED. THEY SANG. EVERYTHING WAS WONDERFUL. THREE-DAY journey into the wilderness. 3 days LATER FROM A REJOICING TESTIMONY MEETING. AMEN. NOW IS MURMURING and complaining and despair because we're all GOING TO DIE. AMEN. WHERE DID THE SONG GO? SING THE SONG AGAIN. AMEN. YOU'RE BESIDE THE WATER, THE BITTER WATERS. WHY DON'T YOU GET THE TAMBOURINE OUT AND SING IT ALL OVER AGAIN and make THE BITTER SWEET WHILE YOU WATCH FOR GOD TO COME ON THE SCENE? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; GOD, CHANGE MY WAYS. GOD, CHANGE MY HABITS. GOD, CHANGE MY THINKING AND MAKE ME ACT LIKE A BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where did the song go? Where did the testimony go? Where did the great things GOD DONE GO? WHY IS IT ALL THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRIAL IS HOW BAD IT IS AND HOW BLEAK IT LOOKS AND how impossible IT'S GOING TO BE AND how everything's about to fall apart. LISTEN, GET THAT LANGUAGE OUT OF YOUR MOUTH. AMEN. AND PUT SOMETHING SWEET BACK INSIDE. AND THE SWEETNESS IS THE REVELATION OF THIS WORD. LET'S TALK ABOUT JESUS. LET'S TALK ABOUT CHRIST. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MESSAGE. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE DID IN THE PAST. WHAT DO WE EXPECT HIM TO DO TODAY? AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HIM TO DO TOMORROW. &gt;&gt; If he came WALKING ON THE WATER, HE CAN STILL COME WALKING ON THE WATER. &gt;&gt; If he can rain mana from heaven, HE CAN STILL RAIN MANA FROM HEAVEN. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO COME, BUT HE'S GOING TO COME. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO REJOICE WHEN HE COMES IN A MEAL OFFERING. AND I WANT TO REJOICE WHEN HE COMES IN a tree. AND I WANT TO REJOICE WHEN HE COMES HOWEVER HE COMES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I want to look for his provision. &gt;&gt; Oh, we serve a mighty God. AMEN. WE SERVE A GOD WHO'S NEVER FAILED. AMEN. WE SERVE A GOD WHO CANNOT FAIL. AND HIS PROMISES TO US ARE SURE. &gt;&gt; Let's put the honey back in our mouth. Let's eat the word, not the bitterness of life. &gt;&gt; Will he still lead us by bitter waters? Absolutely. But if they would have just kept singing the song from three days ago, &gt;&gt; I got a feeling it would have encouraged them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Instead of writing a new song, we're all going to die. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thirsty. So thirsty. Yeah. &gt;&gt; With nothing good to drink. &gt;&gt; Is this life? &gt;&gt; This is life. &gt;&gt; I want to live a different kind of life. &gt;&gt; I want to count it all joy. &gt;&gt; I want to move to expectation. Not expectation for evil, expectation for good. &gt;&gt; Because he says, "I know. I know the plans I have for you." that bring you to an expected plans of good and not of evil to bring you to an expected end. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can claim all the words. We can shout all the praises. We can say everything that we've said today. We can say it all. Amen. It can just be words. But I want it to be more than words. I want to be this word. I want to be to me what God will a virgin shall conserve meant to Mary. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. Amen. It meant something different to Mary than to the high priest who was chanting it in the temple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the priests could say every Sunday they could say, "A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE." WE WANT TO REMIND YOU ALL, "A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE." And we believe that, don't we? And everybody say, "Amen. WE BELIEVE IT. A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE." WE ALL BELIEVE THAT. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; But Mary believed it differently. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way I want this word to be in my life. I want it to be the reality of my life. I want it to be my bread. I want it to be my portion. I want it to be the words that guide my words is this word. &gt;&gt; Help me, God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Help me, God. &gt;&gt; There is a provision that can turn all the bitter waters sweet. &gt;&gt; That provision hasn't went anywhere. He's still here. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will be with you always, &gt;&gt; even to the end of the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. Where is he? He might be in a little bush on the bank of the water just watching. &gt;&gt; I wonder when they'll notice I'm here. &gt;&gt; I wonder when they'll see I'm still here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus came walking on the water. How long he was walking before they noticed him? I don't know. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He was walking and he was just waiting for them to see &gt;&gt; that I'm here. I've showed up. I've come in the midst of your trial. I'm here. &gt;&gt; Yes. And all of a SUDDEN THEY SAW IT ONLY THEY DIDN'T SEE IT as provision. They saw it as SOMETHING SCARIER ON TOP OF WHAT WAS SCARY. &gt;&gt; OH, sometimes the very thing God's going to do to solve our problem looks scarier than the problem. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But that's when we have to trust him. &gt;&gt; God, I don't know what you're doing, but I know you're doing something. &gt;&gt; And if you can open my eyes like you open Moses' eyes so I can see where's your provision in this trial. &gt;&gt; Is it here? There. Where is it? What's happening? You're You're doing something. Lord, help me not to miss you. &gt;&gt; Help me not to miss you. And and help me start to get excited to see what you're going to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to finish with this this scripture. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits. Don't forget what he's done and what he's promised to do. &gt;&gt; Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases, who redeemth thy life from destruction, who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies, who satisfaith thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like an eagle's. How many want to worship that God? &gt;&gt; And worship that way. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're my life. You're my strength. You're my strength. You're my song. You're everything to me. And you have never failed. You're not going to start failing today. &gt;&gt; You redeem my life from destruction. You crown crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender. Who satisfied thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like an eagles. God is renewing our youth. He's taking us back to what we were. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the tree that was cut down and thrown to the bitterness of life to make it sweet again. WHAT'S SWEET ABOUT LIFE? CUZ I'm walking WITH A JOYFUL EXPECTATION. CUZ I KNOW THIS doesn't endure forever. AMEN. THAT THIS LIFE IS FOR A PURPOSE and for a season. BUT I GOT A HOPE WHICH ENDURETH. And that hope could go beyond the veil. I'VE GOT A BODY waiting for me beyond this one. I've got a promise for a life on this earth after this LIFE IS OVER. PRAISE GOD. WHAT IS BITTER ABOUT LIFE? WE'VE been given life and the hope OF LIFE AND THE PROSPECT OF LIFE AND A LIFE THAT NEVER ENDS. &gt;&gt; IF THIS TEMPORARY LIFE HAS SOME JUNCTIONS IN IT THAT NEED TO PROVE GOD'S WORD AND NEED TO MANIFEST Christ in our lives in A CERTAIN WAY, THEN SO BE IT. I'VE NEVER LOST LIFE AND I'VE NEVER LOST ANYTHING, BUT ALL I'VE EVER GOTTEN IN THIS WORD IS GAIN, GAIN, GAIN, GAIN, GAIN. STOP LOOKING AT TODAY AND START LOOKING AT THE PROMISE AND TAKE THE WORD AND PUT IT BACK ON OUR LIPS AND MAKE THE BITTER SWEET AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, it's hard to be bitter when you're testifying of the word. &gt;&gt; And having a testimony service, it's hard to be bitter. All you can say is God is good. &gt;&gt; He does all things well. He rescued me when no one else can. He delivered me. Amen. When I needed delivered. He did things for me that I didn't even know I needed done. I look back and I see a provision all the way through. He walked me through this wilderness journey and he kept me from pitfalls and traps AND SLIME PITS. AMEN. AND I THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS one disaster of another. And I realized IT WAS ALL PERFECT working towards his ordained plan to bring me to an expected end. &gt;&gt; What do I HAVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT? WHAT DO I HAVE TO BE BITTER ABOUT? I SHOULD BE REJOICING BECAUSE HE HAS GUIDED MY STEPS. HE HAS PRESERVED MY LIFE. HE HAS GIVEN ME ANOTHER DAY TO PRAISE his name and he has performed his WORD IN MY LIFE FAITHFULLY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; What should I be bitter about? I should rejoice. &gt;&gt; Rejoice. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. &gt;&gt; I promise if you do that, it's hard to be bitter. It &gt;&gt; is hard to be bitter while rejoicing &gt;&gt; in the Lord and praising his name with all that is within you. &gt;&gt; Oh, God bless you. That's all I'm going to say today. Let's stand. Amen. Musicians, if you'll come, I say, God, change my language. &gt;&gt; Change my attitude towards trials. Just change me, God. How many believe he's changing you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From glory to glory. He's changing us, friends. He's growing us into a stature of a perfect man into that very life that Jesus Christ lived. Jesus had bitterness in life. He had disappointments. He had rejection. He had pain. He had suffering. But he knew who his father was. And he knew there was a plan for his life. And he knew there was an expected end. and he kept pressing on. I want to manifest that life. God, help me to manifest that life, man. Let's just bow our heads for a moment. Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you for God. We could have never made it in life without you. And those things that look like the worst, many times they ended up the best. And God, we thank you. As we look through the word, we see what you've always been and what you've always done. And you're the same thing today. And God, I want to raise my hand and say, "Thank you for making my bittersweet." There was bitterness and trials. There was difficulties, but I look back on them now and there's fond memories of what you did. The supernatural, the deliverance. You've kept us. You've sustained us. You've delivered us. And God, you who worked miracles in the past, you're just as capable of working in them now, in the future, and for always. God, I pray that you would forgive me for speaking bitterness, but help me to speak that which is sweet, to take you, which is the revealed word of this hour, and put it on my lips. Lord, not the bitterness and the pain, but the rejoicing and the truth, the word of life, the word made manifest, Christ for our day. May we take you and put you on our lips and may it be like honey on our lips, sweetness. Lord, help us to testify, to speak of your goodness, of your truth, of your righteousness, of your mercy, which endureth forever. and help us to keep eating, Lord, on this sweet word of promise, this truth for our day, this revelation of the hour. May we continually feed on it. Maybe it's sweet. And Lord, though, there must be bitter experiences in life. It's part of the plan, God. May we never be consumed by the bitterness and give in to the bitterness, but may we constantly be looking for the sweetness to come and make every bitter sweet. For you've promised it, Lord. You'll do it. We believe you. every bitter in life you can make sweet. We love you, God. We ask for your blessings, Lord. May you bless us as a people. May we grow. May we understand better. May we be illuminated with clearer vision. And may we walk in a clearer vision. I ask for it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. And I tell you friends, so many times the sweetness of the trial is not the deliverance. I know I've preached that so long, but sometimes the sweetness of the trial is not the deliverance. &gt;&gt; Brother V says, "Why does God let trials come?" He puts bits in their mouth and makes it obey them. And those trials bring us into a closer fellowship with him. Sometimes the sweetness of the trial is not the deliverance, but the sweetness of the trial is the closer fellowship it brings us into with him. If we look for him, we'll always find him. He's there. Remember, brother told the story of the shepherd who broke the sheep's leg. And somebody questioned him, "Why did you break his leg? Were you mad at him?" And he said, "No, this sheep kept wandering off, and I wanted to break his leg so I can show him some special attention. Love on him a little bit so I can show him how much I love him so he'll learn to stay close to me." You know, that sheep with a broken leg went through some pain. Would you call that bitterness? But what would you call the special attention of the shepherd? A little special food carrying him around, holding him close to his heart, slinging him over his shoulder, what no other sheep was getting at the time. I would call that sweet. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, was there sweet in the midst of the bitter? Was the bitter turned to sweet? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God lets trials come, puts bits in their mouth, makes it obey him, and those trials bring us into a closer fellowship. Listen, sometimes what we're looking for, what God's providing is not always what we're looking for. Sometimes we're looking for the parting of the waters. And that's wonderful. And God does that, and those are great testimonies. But sometimes what he wants to do is show you a little extra love and draw you up close to him and have a little more time in prayer and meditation that he can speak back to your heart peace and love and sweetness and turn the bitter into sweet. Not because he parted the waters and the the skies open and thunderbolts. No, but because he came into the midst of the trial and he held your hand a little tighter and he put his arm around you and consoled you more personally than he had the day before. Sometimes we look for great big things and we miss where Christ is making the bittersweet every day. Amen. Let let him bring you and I into a closer fellowship. Because I tell you friends, for the bride, a closer fellowship is sweet. &gt;&gt; Amen. It may take a little bitterness, but he'll turn it sweet. Christ is the answer. He is the tree.
