each time with this fresh expectation lord that will receive something from you that we have need of lord that we might grow in this dark hour that our light might shine brighter in this dark world lord and we might accomplish what you've purposed for us to accomplish god i pray you would take these lips under your control and speak your words of eternal life god i pray that you would have preeminence among us and you'd be the great one among us this evening we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to isaiah chapter 26. i want to greet our visitors i know we've got a brother joseph musinga and his family here god bless you brother it's good to have you this brother is a deacon in brother burley williams church so brother burley is a good friend of ours so a friend of our friend is also our friend amen god bless you brother i believe he's here visiting sabasu family so no you want to greet them after service amen also i want to mention i'm looking forward to the kids service as a reminder for everybody that will be the kids service this sunday at 4 p.m so we're looking forward to that and let's look in isaiah chapter 26 and verse 3. isaiah 26 and 3 thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind has stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee amen god bless you as you're seated amen if there was ever a time this world needs peace amen perfect peace the world is going crazy people are losing their peace they're losing amen their their sense of whatever they're just losing it i mean whatever it is they're losing you can safely say they're losing it amen whatever it is we can see the effect of it but thou will keep him in perfect peace this is not just peace this is perfect peace whose mind has stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee so why is his mind stayed on him because he trusteth in him this is the one i focused my attention on the one that i trust in amen the one that i have confidence in the one that i know amen will see me through amen i have my mind is stayed on christ because i know that christ will see me through so that will bring perfect peace i'd like to speak this evening on just a simple subject the lord's been dealing with me on for about a month uh on the channel of the mind and if we could just take some time this evening and talk about the channel of the mind and ask the lord to bless us as we as we we share what's on our heart brother venom says in in the message taking god at his word the five senses wasn't given to man to contact god with we know that brother beam says that many times that our this our senses were not meant to contact god you cannot contact god through your senses amen you can only contact god by faith he goes on to say the five senses wasn't given to man to contact god with however five senses was given to man to contact his earthly home we contact god by faith the sixth sense amen so the only way for us to contact god is by faith is that right so none of the senses that we have we have five amen in the body and five in the spirit none of these senses were meant for us to contact god by but i would like to just just pose a thought for you if you'll just bear with me for a minute as we developed it we cannot contact god through the senses we contact god through faith but god uses those senses to contact us so i would like to talk about that through the scriptures if we can turn to john the gospel of john chapter 20 and i'd like to just go through a few scriptures as we paint this picture john chapter 20. so we cannot contact god with the senses but god will use those senses to contact us so john 20 verse 26 john chapter 20 verse 26 and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas was with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then said he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither my hand thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god jesus said unto him thomas because thou has seen me thou has believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed and who we know that blessing applies to us amen but yet you know when thomas was having an issue with his faith god was going to come down and encourage his faith because the only way that thomas amen could touch god was by faith but god was going to come down and touch thomas amen so that thomas could believe and he come down and he said take thy finger and thrust it into my hand take thy hand and thrust in my sight he stood there amen as the resurrected christ and said see me and touch me and don't be unbelieving but believe amen and thomas believed now let's go to romans chapter 10. romans chapter 10. we're just going to hit three more places here romans chapter 10 verse 17. so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god so we we cannot contact god with our senses but here he's using the sense of hearing to contact us because we have to have faith to touch him but faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word amen so i want us to get this straight in our mind that the only way for us to contact god is by our faith amen but god is using these senses to bring us into faith to bring the word to us for us to believe so that we can contact him so god is contacting us through the senses so that we can contact him without any of the senses only by faith amen this is all going to come to a point first john chapter one let's go over to first john over here as we get close to revelation first john chapter one first john chapter one and we'll read verse one that which was from the beginning which we have heard hearing which we have seen with our eyes seeing which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifest unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ so now the apostle john is telling you we have seen we have heard we have handled of the word of life and now we are here to declare it to you so that you can hear what we say about what we saw and about what we touched there's a lot of senses amen a lot of human senses involved but the whole point was for god get the word down into the soul so that you can believe because that's the only way that you can touch god so god is using your senses to contact you so that the only way that you can contact him is by faith now let's go over to revelation chapter 1. revelation chapter 1 verse 3. blessed is he that readeth now in order to read you have to be able to see you have to have a mind you've had to learn i mean reading is not looking reading also involves the intellect blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand so even a blessing will come to those that read or that hear amen the words of this prophecy and i just if i could just take a minute to share what my thought is you know we we know that the only way we can contact god amen is by faith amen we can say a lot of words we can come to church we can do a lot of things light candles give offerings but none of those things will bring you in contact with god only faith is what will contact god but god has a way of unlocking the faith that is in us by bringing us the word and he brings that word through our senses we have a bible in print so that we could look at it we have the sense of sight so that we can read we have a mind amen that we can learn so that we can read so that when we read the word amen we can receive the word and it can unlock faith in us so that we can touch god amen and so god begins to use amen these senses in us amen so that we can begin to know him and the word can unlock even brother banham would use these senses in us to get us to receive the word amen what about the sense of imagination amen what about when brother banham goes to tell the story and he begins to see amen he said i can just see adam and eve walking out of the garden he said i can just see amen as the bloody skins are slapping against their leg as they walk out and the blood is trickling down amen i want to ask you can you see it in your mind what is that that's your imagination so what is god using he's using your mind using your imagination amen using all of these things amen even using your affection even using your memory amen because something will happen and god will trigger a memory of a scripture you read or something brother branham said then bring the word to light in your life amen so that faith can grow so we can only contact god by faith but god is constantly contacting us through our senses and that's why i wanted to talk about the channel of the mind because of some things brother benham said and and because god is always trying to contact us through our senses i think it's very very important that we keep the channel of these senses open for god to use and not allow the devil to plug up these channels amen so that we can't receive the word the way god wants us to receive the word amen and all of a sudden things become amen we we just don't hear him like we should hear him because the channels are plugged up with so many other things amen you think about the realm of imagination my goodness in noah's day they had a problem with imagination because all the imagination of their heart were wicked or evil continually amen and god was going to condemn them because their imagination realm was only evil continually amen but we know there was so many times that the imagination realm for many of the prophets of god amen were being used as they meditated on god as david would sit amen at his sheep when he was tending his father's sheep and they would all be at rest amen in the pasture sitting down amen his meditation his imagination and his thoughts would meditate on god continually and he would begin to write praise songs and worship songs amen because the meditation of his mind was on god but when it comes to noah's day their imagination was on evil continually and we live in a day where the mind of humanity is bombarded with images bombarded with messages bombarded with information until the imagination can be so plugged up amen with information and images and and all of these things amen i think it's time that we as the bride of jesus christ say i am not going to give all of my senses to the world but i'm going to reserve them to hear from god because that's how god is trying to communicate with me brother branham said in spoken word is the original seed he said but any time a woman takes a wrong step she has to first receive it in her mind some slicker has to persuade her and she listens to it against her own better judgment than the act is committed see first it hit satan hit eve's mind and the womb of her mind she doubted god's word then came the actual act amen everything was fine and shall she begin to give her senses amen to the voice of the serpent and the serpent began to use her sense of hearing he began to use her her imagination he began to use he began to sow a seed in her mind before he could ever sow a seed in her womb he had to first sow a seed in her mind amen amen so he said the only way that we can ever be born again is first the womb of the mind receive the word and then the spirit comes on top of that and brings it to life there you are that's what it does that's the real gospel teaching brother i believe if saint paul was standing today he teach the same thing i do in this hour we believe it amen we're resting on that what was the result with her physical and spiritual death what is the result of those who accept the other way it goes into this frolic today that they got both physical and spiritual death both body and spirit shall be annihilated be no more that's exactly right note mary's wound mary's womb the physical mind see was a virgin womb why she believed god's word no matter how much anybody criticized how many things somebody else said that didn't have one thing to do with it she believed god's word regardless oh i wish i could just get that over are you getting it first was her mind before the act ever took place in her literal womb now he's speaking of the virgin mary first she must receive the word from an angel messenger when she received the word from the angel messenger she received it first and then she conceived in the womb so god was using the channel that's why gabriel comes and appears to her so now she sees with her eyes an angel she hears the message with his voice why god is trying to get to her to unlock faith that's inside of her to receive the word so god is using the senses amen and he begins he appears visibly audibly gives a message unto her amen and she she doesn't even know how these things can be but he begins to work amen even in into her mind amen and begins to tell her that this is going to happen by the holy ghost and something in her unlocks and say be it unto me according to thy word so no angelic visitation no audible sounds coming from the voice of that angel amen there would have been no faith for mary to receive the promise amen so he goes on to say for mary it first was her mind before the act ever taken place in her little room the act had to take place in in here first to let the spirit come in to do the rest of the work oh my glory before the actual spiritual birth can take place the word has to find it itself through your mind he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life and shall never come into the judgment or through the tribulation period but has passed from death and to life now brother abraham says in the message the end time signed seed says now what if god would send his message by an angel to mary and said hail mary blessed art thou amongst women you're going to have a baby knowing no man she said now wait a minute here let me take you down to the laboratory and you tell me let the doctor prove to me just how i'm going to do this then i'll believe you it would never happen but what did she what what did she come to the womb of her heart the womb of her spirit the womb of her spirit is your mind your mind is a channel so i want you to catch that your mind is a channel and that's what god was using as gabriel was speaking unto mary he was using the channel of her mind amen to unlock the faith that was laying down in here because she was predestinated to bring forth that virgin seed amen the seed of the woman from before the foundation of the world remember that that faith had to be unlocked amen and we know that it had to do with mary's faith because when she went to go visit elizabeth amen she gave a salutation her salutation caused that baby the leap in the womb of elizabeth and elizabeth began to prophesy and as elizabeth began to prophesy amen he says she begins to say something on the order of because these things shall be performed in you because you believed because you believe these things will be performed because you believed amen because everything in the kingdom of god operates by faith amen so these things that the angel told you they're not happening because the angel told you they're happening because you believe what the angel told you amen because it requires faith but faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of god amen so god is using our senses to bring in us amen the quickening power amen to bring the word and then when the words receive the spirit comes on top of the word which is quickening power to make the word live and because you believe it'll be done according to your faith praise god so mary had to receive and believe the angel's message praise god but he used the channel of her mind the womb of her mind your mind is a channel amen let's turn to ephesians chapter 4. ephesians chapter 4 verse 17. verse 17 this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind now something in your mind has to change if paul's paul's saying don't walk like other gentiles in the vanity of your mind you've got to now not allow the vanity of your mind you've got to do something different with your mind having the and then he goes on to describe them having the understand the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over into lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness but you have not so learned christ if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus that you put off concerning the former conversations the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind that you that ye put on the new man which after god has created in righteousness and true holiness don't walk as gentiles in the vanity of your mind but be renewed in the spirit of your mind amen what will renew you in the spirit of your mind the word will renew you in the spirit of your mind so don't walk like other gentiles in the vanity of your mind but be renewed in the spirit of your mind by the word amen praise god amen brother baby says in the greatest battle ever fought he says but your mind accepts it it grasps it what is your mind controlled by your spirit your spirit catches the word of god and that's the thing that's got life in it now brother branham when he begins to explain in greatest battle ever fought he he talks about three circles the inside circle amen the outside circle and then the out and then the big circle on the outside and that's body spirit soul but when brother branham comes the greatest battle ever fought he swifts switches the terminology on spirit and soul and he labels it body soul and spirit but that's no problem at all because he doesn't change his doctrine one little drop he only changes terminology but never his doctrine his doctrine remains the same all the way through it's just terminology so don't worry about the terminology now here when he speaks in greatest battle ever thought he already defined the term spirit he means the innermost part of you which later he clarifies in 1964 and 63 64 and 65 to be your soul so you just have to adjust your thinking on the terminology not the doctrine now he's talking about the inside inside inside he says your spirit so he's talking about your soul so what is what is your mind controlled by he says your spirit so what he's referring to that third part down on the inside and your spirit catches the word of god and that's the thing that's got life in it amen what's got life in it the word and the soul it brings life into you oh brother when that takes place when life comes down that channel into you the word of god is manifested into you so it comes through the channel it comes through the mind into the soul and there's a gate to the soul brother bam talks about and that gate is your free will you can accept it or you can reject it it'll come into your mind if you sit through preaching it'll come into your mind if you listen to a tape it'll come into your mind if you read your bible or you read your book but there's a gate there's a channel the channel to the soul is through the mind but there's a gate in that chat in that channel and that gate is your own free choice you can accept it or you can reject it if you accept it as it comes into the mind then it drops into the soul quickens the seed to life amen and begins to express back out through the mind because the mind controls the actions of the body amen so it comes into the channel of the mind it quickens the life and then it's expressed back through the mind because the mind controls the body and now begins to express the word of god manifested in you so there's a channel amen between amen between the the the spirit and the soul and that channel is your mind amen so let's look at first peter chapter 1. first peter chapter 1 verse 13. first peter 1 13 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober that means steady and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ this gird up the loins of your mind the girdup means to gather up the loose fabric of the robe amen of men as they would work gird up the loin gather it up and bind it up around the hips amen so it's not loose it's not getting caught up and stuff they would gather they would gather up the the loins as they would go to work or as they would run a race amen and now he's telling you don't allow your mind to run loose don't be loose in your mind don't be like gentiles in the vanity of your mind don't be loose amen but gather up the amen gather up let me read it again uh 113 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind and be sober amen don't allow all this crazy thinking amen gather up the loins of your mind and be sober be steady amen be right thinking so there's a there's a commandment here amen not to be loose in our mind not to be vain in our minds and vain in our imaginations amen but we're supposed to gather that together gather the thought life together gather the mind up and be sober amen and be focused and be diligent about how we use the senses amen in our body and our mind and we have to be diligent about what we look at what we hear what we allow to come into the wound of the mind what we what we what we imagine about and think about he said don't let those things run around gather them up amen in the greatest battle ever fought he says that great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had he satan came to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and begin in us all right let's catch that and has been raging ever since so this great war that broke out in heaven amen and i don't think we will ever i don't think we have even begin to scratch the surface of how terrible that war was in heaven i mean we're talking about war in heaven amen a division amongst the angels and war that broke out in heaven i don't think we will ever realize and then maybe maybe we will someday maybe after a body change but realize what a terrible thing took place in heaven and now cast down to the earth and that same battle rages on but it rages on in us it's not going on over here and over there and over there but that battle has now come to humanity and is raging in us amen so we must be diligent amen we must gird up the loins of our mind and not walk as gentiles in the vanity of our mind because the mind is the channel to the soul it is the womb amen it is something that has to be guarded has to be protected and has to be focused he goes on to say and greatest battle ever fought he says when this great battle started on earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that battlegrounds begin in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was begin and that is because the decisions are made from the mind the head now they never started it from some organization they never started it from some mechanical affair the grounds never started there therefore the organization can never never do the work of god because the battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you so this great battleground where these two forces brother ben begins to describe this and greatest battle ever fought where these two opposing armies are testing their strength to see who will be victorious it's taking place in the minds of man let's look at romans chapter 12. romans chapter 12 and i'll begin reading in verse 1 romans 12 and 1. i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will have gone amen we've got to watch the mind we talked about last week i don't remember which service it was but they asked jesus what is the greatest commandment of all and jesus said the greatest commandment of all was to the the lord the hero o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment so that means god wants all of our hearts all of our mind all of our soul and all of our strengths he wants all of us remember where the bible says he's a jealous god i believe he's still a jealous god and he wants us all of our mind greatest battle over thought he goes on and says the battle raged when eve opened up her mind to listen to her reasoning that's the flu it come in that's the channel it run down her reasoning she in her soul she reasoned her eyes was sight she saw the serpent he started talking about the senses her eyes were psyched she saw the serpent he was beautiful handsome far better than her own husband he was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field and he was probably a fairer man than her husband he looked like a great masculine beast standing there how great he was and he was trying to tell her what a great thing it was and the first thing she did she opened up her mind and when she did human reasonings caught it why wouldn't that be a thrill that was the thought she had wouldn't that be a thrill he begins first it comes into the mind amen and he begins to appeal to all of these senses then she turns and looks at the tree and sees that it's pleasant to the eye it's good for food it's desirable to make one wise and it begins to appeal to these senses as he opens the channel of her mind and she opens her mind to him to listen to him to his reasonings and all the sudden the fall it brings in the fall amen and we know that that you know the devil hasn't changed his tactics if it ever worked it'll always work like he realized that religion was the best way to keep people close to god and the closer he can keep them the further he can keep them away it was a tremendous tactic to bring religion on the scene and not to try amen to destroy everything god did but just come and try to pervert what god did and he found out in the garden he can come close pervert it amen bring the judgments of god upon it and he can sit as a squatter with squatters rights and begin to rule over the earth amen so they did the same thing to the jewish church he did the same thing to the church in eden he did the same thing to the jewish church he did the same thing to the gentile church and because it worked he always does the same thing and the battlefield is in the mind amen and god begins to uh begins to admonish us not to have a loose mind to be diligent about our mind to be transformed in the mind don't go after the vanity of the mind so the scripture is always giving us this admonition amen to guard our mind amen and brother bran begins to explain it to us in greatest battle ever fought and i think it behooves us to hear what he says and not forget some of these simple things because it's the little foxes that spoil the vine so many times the things that trip us up amen are not the the great big things the things that are flashing red lights of sin amen but the little foxes spoil the vine the little gaps the little things left undone the the little the the little areas that we leave a door open amen for the devil to creep into and begin to work in our imagination and in our thoughts and in our affections and next thing you know amen we we we have to snap ourselves out of something and say what is going on with me and we didn't realize amen that i wasn't diligent about gathering up the loins of my mind and we have to be diligent in this day because there's never been a day amen that we know of amen noah's day was like this day brother madam said i don't know what kind of devices they had and what kind of access they had amen but i know what we have in this day and whatever access they had in their day made the imaginations of their thoughts evil continually we've come right back to that place in the world whatever access they have has brought this world their minds evil continually remember god everything in the kingdom of god operates by faith faith cometh by hearing the word so brother branham said god will have a civilization amen but it won't be a civilization a science and it won't be anything like this civilization of the politics and science and corruption he'll have a civilization but that civilization will be based on faith amen that's what the garden was based off the garden of eden was based off faith amen the next civilization will be based off faith that's why this one is based off science man's thoughts his reasoning his achievements and that would this that's why he says this is of the devil amen that next one will be a different kind of civilization all together he said do you think we'll have automobiles and airplanes in that one no way amen we won't need it amen because it'll operate by faith but listen god wants a people who now operate by faith that are going to live in that civilization this is our training for reigning in that civilization so we have to begin to operate by faith and to operate by faith we don't operate by science amen we have to begin to operate by faith amen amen praise be to god and so in order to operate by faith you've got to guard your mind amen i was doing thinking on this imagination and and all of the uh the bombardment that we have almost 24 7 by all by communications by internet by whatsapp messages and whatever social medias and news and all of these other things amen and and you know we all carry a phone and and listen i'm going to tell you right up front i'm not telling you to throw your phone away i'm not going to get rid of my phone any more than i'm going to get rid of my car because in the world we live in today amen everything now needs an access point you can't do your banking you can't there's so many things that you can't do anymore and i mean pretty soon i don't even know i mean i still get out my wallet and i take out money and i've become an odd person like i like to hand people money and now cashiers they get a little annoyed with you if you hand the money it's like i'm going to have to count back change they use the credit card now they use something on their phone i don't even know what that is and i don't ever want to know but i probably someday will have to know i'm being reluctantly dragged in to technology i like paper i like pens i like writing down notes i'm archaic i'm a dinosaur and i like it that way but listen we're not going to have a cell phone in the millennium but i'm not going to need a notepad either because i'm going to have the right kind of mind i'll remember something over there i can actually remember more than two items at a time probably when i get over there but one thing i realized for me is it's so easy to allow this access point which we need in life i'm not preaching against it because it's necessary listen i'm not going to preach against facebook i'm not going to preach against whatsapp so you can rest easy i'm not going to touch on anything like that and say you got to get rid of this and you got to get rid of that i'm not going to i'm not going to tell you that because this is the world we live in but what i am going to tell you is you better gird up the loins of your mind you better be very aware that the devil has a tactic amen and brother banham says the pentecostals used not to let their children go to the picture show but the devil brought one in and he brought it right in your house well i mean you just fill in the rest of the sentence i'm not going to tell you you know the rest of it you know and so this isn't a message of condemnation this is a message of encouragement because what we need to know is how dangerous this device is amen not dangerous because i'm going to get lured into sin amen i don't believe amen because the god's given us the holy ghost that just because i have a cell phone with access in my pocket amen i've had it for years it's not luring me into sin it's not driving me into evilness and wickedness but what it's doing is it's polluting my mind amen it's filling my head full of garbage it is taking the senses that god wants to use to speak to me the word of god and it's so full of news and so full of information and i mean it's all the time there's a notification going off a notification a contact point a question a testimony a video from overseas none of these things are evil not one of them are evil amen there's news to watch and there's the weather to check but i started thinking a little while ago i said why do i need to know the weather every hour and a half like i find myself checking the weather like it hasn't changed i'm outside the other day my wife told me it was raining i was back in my office there's no windows in my office at home said it's raining i said no it's not the weather said it's not raining my phone says it's not raining it's not raining and she just looked at the water running down the window she said it's raining it's not planning and you realize how subtle this thing is not wickedness not evil not debauchery but plugging the channel that god wants to use to bring the word just filling it up with just stuff somebody bought a new car somebody's going on vacation somebody just bought a new whatever whatever i i mean not evil not wicked somebody just passed out bibles in another country somebody and wanted to say hello somebody said happy birthday and i got to find out what the weather is because it might have changed an hour ago and then i better check my email while i'm here checking my weather just in case somebody's trying to get a hold of me and the next thing i know flip flip flip flip flip flip flip 30 minutes are gone and i have received so much information that i did not need in any way shape or form did not change anything and did zero to build faith inside of me because faith cometh by the word not by news not by weather amen not by pictures of somebody's grandchild amen none of that will bring faith only the word will bring faith and i've got to operate by faith not news i've got to operate by faith not not financial projections i've got to operate by faith amen by faith and all of these things are filling our minds with information and it's actually weakening our minds and it's actually subtly taking away our ability to hear from god all the time i've been with people before amen and and they they check their phone like they have nervous ticks it's like what's changed and nothing i don't think they're doing anything evil i trust i trust the believers it's not evil but god god is going to the battle is in the mind so the devil has found a way to fill the mind so that those the the god doesn't have as much access amen you know i was thinking about the process of coming to church when we come to church we either silence our phone turn it off or leave it somewhere else and the prophet of god told us come 30 minutes early to church to get your your spirit quiet so we come to church early amen and we begin to pray and we begin to meditate and on the way to church we're thinking about church we're wondering about you know what will the sermon be like today and we're thinking about church and maybe your thoughts are on the what was preached last time will be a continuation will be something else and so we're coming as we come to church we're starting to align our senses our memory of last service our thoughts our imagination of what might be preached then we come into the service and we quiet ourselves down and we begin to focus on what's about to happen begin to pray begin to meditate read our bibles read the message amen and then all of a sudden the musicians come out and they begin to create an atmosphere which you hear in your ears and all the senses what church is doing is aligning all of our senses to one focal point our feeling our hearing i mean everything our thought life everything begins to align and then after the song leader comes out we all begin to sing we begin to sing the same songs and the songs are about the word and the songs are about the lord the songs are about our position with him and what's it doing it's bringing the imagination it's bringing the thoughts it's bringing the affections everything begins to line up and then we come to the preaching of the word amen then god begins to speak through the preaching of the word amen and we receive something he begins to talk to us repeat our sentences back to us answer the questions that we came with and god begins to speak to us amen and then afterwards amen we we have time of worship and a time of prayer and we begin to thank god for what he's done and meditate on what we've heard and let it soak in and we walk out of here and we say god was speaking directly to me in that service and and i'm here to tell you that's a wonderful thing but i don't think this is the only place that god wants to speak to his children i believe if we can do the same thing elsewhere we can receive the same thing from god i believe god wants to speak through the channel of the mind i believe god wants to tell us amen what his plan is what he wants us to do i believe god wants fellowship with you and i yeah but how many times amen do you go to read your bible and then you go to to prayer and all of a sudden notification and somebody's sick notification somebody's engaged notification somebody's traveling and then all of a sudden you're trying to pray but actually what you're doing is saying god i love you help me with my day and in your imagination you're rolling through all of those notifications i mean i hope i'm not the only person that this happens to all of a sudden and so there's words but there's no connection there's words but there's no prayer amen god's not after words you can only contact him by faith so for me this is just me personally i'm not telling anybody else what to do this is just me this is what i found when i wake up in the morning i leave my phone back by my bedside because it's my alarm clock and i go to prayer and i go to read my bible without my phone because too many times goes off goes off goes off and even if i don't check it i'm already wondering what it is could it be this and could it be that and nothing evil there's nothing evil going on nothing wicked nothing ungodly nothing contrary to the word of god but my mind is already distracted at the time when it should be focused and for me this is just me like i say i'm not giving any commandments but i like a bible amen and i'll tell you why a lot of people use their phone or whatever to read the bible and that's fine there's a daily devotion my wife and i do i do on the phone amen but for me personally i like a bible because when i pick up this bible there's only one function for this bible it does nothing else this bible doesn't tell me the weather it doesn't tell me who's getting married it doesn't tell me who's having a good day and who's on vacation and all this bible does is give me the word which will give me faith and when i pick this up i'm singularly focused on the word of god and there are no interruptions no notification you say well i don't check them you don't have to check them bing bing and then the name pops up at the top and you know oh man i'll answer her later and you go back to reading what are you reading what impact is it having you're thinking about who you got to remember to call back later right so for me i like a message book because there's only one purpose for that book i'm going to read the message i mean you can still use whatever device you want i'm not against it i mean i read the message on my my phone all the time amen i read the bible on my phone i've got an app that i use for the concordance on my bible all the time when i'm talking to you i will always use it i'm not against that but i'm telling you i've had to take steps myself to gird up the loins of my mind because i realize leaving this mind loose is not working to build any more faith in me it's the distractions polluting the channel of the mind that god wants to use to get to my soul to unlock the faith that's laying there so this isn't about this isn't about everybody lining up and you all throw this away and you all get that no absolutely not friends i'm telling you what i've had to do myself amen to gird up the loins in my mind because the other was not working i mean it worked partially i mean i still read the bible and i did devotions but now i need quiet undistracted intentional focused time to put my mind to the purpose of hearing god's word man i'll just ask you because i've been through all of this lately when was the last time you just meditated on the lord for 20 30 minutes no other noise no music playing nothing audio all by yourself when was the last time and not a list of prayer requests when was the last time you just let your thoughts focus on god and meditate on him for a period of time i mean sometimes we get in our car and we have to have noise all the time stimulation stimulation stimulation because we live in a world where we've been overly stimulated all of the senses have been stimulated non-stop visually stimulating audio stimulated stimulation stimulation stimulation so that when everything goes quiet we feel a little bit weird awkward i don't think god wants it to be awkward when we get quiet i don't think i i i think god is a gentleman he never screams and shouts for attention he's patient and he's a gentleman amen and he has to be invited even when jesus was speaking to them on the road to emmaus he was going to walk by until he was invited in and for me i've had to i've had to gird up the loins in my mind and say i'm not throwing away my smartphone there's a lot of it i need to function a lot of work i need to do i'm not throwing away i'm not suggesting you throw it away but what i am saying is we better be careful we better pay attention we better wake up and realize that the battle is in the mind and the word is coming through the mind through the soul amen in the and the devil's message is coming in the mind and he's trying to block the channel to the soul amen and doesn't want that word to be expressed in you and i and there's a battle raging in our mind and we better pick which side we're going to be on and say you know what i'm not going to take this distraction i'm not any longer going to waste this time i'm no longer let's read a scripture first corinthians let's go to first corinthians this will embody what i'm hopefully will embody what i'm trying to say first corinthians chapter six first corinthians chapter six and i want to read verse 12. all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient that means profitable all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any let's make this our cry i'm not doing evil i'm not doing wrong i'm not committing sin all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient for me all things are lawful unto me but i will not be brought under the power of any i will not let this thing plug up the channel that god wants to use to speak his word to me i will not give my mind to such as that 24 hours a day i will not give all my waking time and my attentiveness to that amen so that it can plug up my mind and begin to reduce my ability to hear from god and receive the word i will not be brought under the power of that although it's not sin it's not wrong i don't have to get rid of it amen but i will not be brought under the power of that this is overcoming time this is an overcoming people in the midst of satan's eden when satan's eating come to its pinnacle to its peak and everything is available everything that you ever want amen anything that you can imagine amen it can be available to you amen but you won't be brought under the power of any because there's been a bride that's been awakened to the word in this day and she will overcome every one of satan's tricks and tactics she will prevail she will amen by free choice give god the best time give god her might not by force not because somebody beat him over the head with the word and made him so guilty that they wanted to do this and that amen but just somebody said hey watch your mind watch what god wants to do god wants to speak to you and there's a little bride so in love with him that says if he wants to speak to me then i want to be quiet and hear what he has to say i want to be focused i want to be dedicated i want to be diligent because if he wants to speak to me i want to hear what he's saying there's not about guilt this is not condemnation amen this is not this affects every single one of us but we have to be aware it affects us and we've got to be willing to take action amen i found out that i don't need my phone with me all the time what an awful idea i mean you know the boys have dumb phones these little dumb flip phones it's it's the it's the bane of their existence it's an embarrassment in this world today to pull out an old phone and flip it open it's like the badge of shame but they don't need anything else i want to be able to communicate with them i want to know where they're at that's all they need then one of the girls says you know you really should get maybe a smartphone to think about you know routing directions so they'd know how to drive because it'd be safer that way i said listen i didn't have a mapping feature when i got my license i didn't have a phone i didn't have a pager and i survived we made it through when i was a boy we didn't even have seat belts in our car like well you got to have this and you got to have that and you got to have this and all of a sudden you're like who's this dictating what i have to have and what i don't have to have now of course i want them to be safe so we bought one of those little garmin things that you stick on the window that you can't do anything else but see directions so they were perfectly safe but you understand the world everything's shifting this way and i like my mapping feature i enjoy it i got tired of getting out of the car and asking directions going into the gas station do you know where such and such a street is i like my mapping feature i'm not going to get rid of it i'm going to keep using it but i'm not going to be brought under the power of this thing i i realized you know when covert broke out and all that thing was going on amen i was watching news and there was a certain necessity to watching news because things were changing and as a church we needed to know what requirements were and what laws were changing and there was a certain requirement but i realized that during that process i got in the habit of watching news and my mind was filled and i always wanted to make sure something hadn't changed so i would watch 20 minutes to realize nothing changed and then at the end of the day i'd watch 20-30 minutes to realize nothing changed and then the next day i'd watch 30 minutes to realize nothing changed hey guess what nothing's changing and so i realized what was happening i said no more i don't need that anymore and i quit and then when the war in ukraine broke out all of a sudden we want to know what's going on fulfilled prophecy what brother ben said about russia could this be it could this be that and so we're interested we're curious because of the word so we begin to watch the news and and then all of a sudden you know some drastic things are changing believers are fleeing it's affecting some of the people that we know and there's news but then it gets into then very quickly it moves into the repetition of the same thing every day i mean the name of the city is different and who did what is slightly changed but it becomes a thief that steals my mind and i recognize what was happening he said i don't need that anymore and it wasn't like i was watching all day i might have watched 30 minutes a day but but then you think about it after that and then the things that are said and the images that are there they have an effect on you things that you see and things that you hear they affect you and they don't leave you immediately when you shut the phone you shut it off and you put it down you got the news you needed but what you heard and what you saw remain rolling around in there for quite a period of time and sometimes it could even pop up weeks later or years later and i'm telling you i am older now i'm not old but i'm older now and i have limited capacity to store information and i cannot waste what precious resources i have upstairs on things that make zero difference for me in my daily life i will still amen i will still get up in the morning go through the same exact routine come into the office read the message amen all the news that has happened has it changed anything in your life in the last six months nothing's changed all that i was doing was hearing about what's happening somewhere else in other cities and other names and i was still had to go through the same routine only i was going through the same routine more distracted i'm saying we can't live this way we've got to be focused friends we the devil is constantly after the bride trying to trip her up and god is constantly trying to lead us we don't have time for this the what we're called to is it's too important amen what god wants to do in us amen is so critical in this hour that we have to be tuned in amen the dial's got to be tuned in to the right frequency and it's got to stay there amen let's turn to matthew chapter 6. matthew chapter 6. and verse 22 matthew chapter 6 verse 22 the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine i be single thy whole body shall be full of light that i looked up i this word i in the greek and in the concordance when it gives the description of i it says the i metaphorically the eyes of the mind the faculty of knowing now let's go back and read it with the concordance description metaphorically the eye of the mind the faculty of knowing if the light of the body is the eye or the mind if therefore thine eye be single that means focused on one thing if it be single the whole body shall be full of light or what light are we talking about we're not talking about sunlight friends we're talking about illumination the word of god but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness i i don't want any more darkness coming in i mean you can't you drive down the road messages billboards messages information you walk through stores there's information everywhere it's on racks it's coming from other people i mean it's you're inundated with information you go to work and you you work with geniuses who knows what's going on in the world they know everything and they're willing to tell you all about it they know what's problem with the government they know what the solution will be they they they know they know everything they know what is really about right that's why they're working next to you is because they're so smart they got it all figured they're undercover they're really they could run the whole world but they're just working next to you just so nobody else knows people crack me up the world is funny but you're inundated with information and it's all from a civilization of unbelief all of it is unbelief the message is at work what you run into in the store what's on the magazine racks what's coming through the news amen it's all unbelief from a civilization is unbelief and it is none of it taking us to the civilization of faith none of it is preparing us amen these are things we have to overcome we have to avoid at all costs amen and i'm stuck right in the middle of satan's eating but god knew i would be here amen and god knew my senses would be battled all day and bombarded all day with lies and unbelief and lies and unbelief so what did god do in this day when our senses of sight and senses of hearing we're going to be inundated with unbelief god amen brought a prophet up in a day when he would have an audio recording we'd have books printed we'd have videos of him deep called to the demon 20th century prophet so as satan's inundating the senses god has provided something for the senses amen you can read the book you can listen to the tape you can watch the video you can be singly focused god has provided what we need to overcome this lying deceptive civilization god is so good he hasn't left us lacking anything friends there has never been this much recorded information from a prophet's ministry everywhere in the history of the world and no no other ages how much do you have about jeremiah how much do you know about isaiah amen even paul's writings is very limited but here we have the majority of a lifetime of a prophet of god on earth and we watched his life we watched his character we heard him preach in multitudes of situations and explain numerous doctrines amen and we can all receive it in our senses the same senses the devil is trying to use to plug our mind if we'll it will move that junk away from our mind and be singly focused amen if our mind will be single on this message amen we will get everything we need to overcome i don't need information amen from the news to overcome laodicea i need this message to overcome laodicea the news is not helping me overcome it's not giving me that tip that insider bit of information no everything i need is coming from this message everything that i need to fulfill god's purpose in my life to accomplish what he's called me for and to receive a body change and to move into the the millennium everything that i need is in the message nothing outside of that will produce faith in me so what do we want to spend the most time with i'll ask you another question and i'm not just asking to you i've asked them to myself when was the last time you just drove down the road by yourself in a car with no noise no radio no music no nothing and just talk to god not even pray like a traditional prayer but just say god i love you god i love you and i'm so thankful for you see i think that should be our life that should be our daily life that should be how the bride lives amen but the devil's trick is to keep the noise going keep the noise keep the information keep the flashing lights keep the keep it all of it amen keep it going keep it going keep it going until we're so strung out on that stuff as soon as it goes quiet we're looking for a button to push somewhere uh you know what i don't want any more buttons i i started in the evening time now i've had several times in the evening time where i just go and i take my phone and i lay it on the dresser or my nightstand because my alarm clock in the last couple hours of the day i have no phone and the world has not quit spinning there has been no emergency that needed my immediate attention where folks would have died or i realized you know what else i started doing when i'm going out running errands and i'm going to run into the bank and i'm going to run into the storm pick something up i realize that i can leave my phone in my truck you know what happened when i left my phone in my truck whenever i would go into the store and you go to the bank and all of a sudden you didn't expect it but now there's a line and the person in front of you runs some sort of business because they want 5 000 ones and 100 tins and you're standing here and the first thing you do is stick your hand in your pocket and pull it out and make sure nobody texts you and nobody emailed you and we're trying to get something done while we're standing in line and all we're doing is putting more stuff in the mind that doesn't need to be there hey listen we don't need to be more efficient we don't need to multitask if your mind be single that's not multitasking if your mind be focused your whole body shall be full of life there's times we have to multitask we have to work we have to get things done but i think there should be times that we're not multitasking i think there should be times that we let our mind go quiet and let the noise shut the noise down and just focus our attention on god and his word it's the only thing that'll overcome satan's nothing else is going to work and we always think this is me i always think this is a busy day tomorrow will be different it's a busy day tomorrow will be different it's a busy day tomorrow how many times have you had a busy day but you knew tomorrow would be different i'll have a little more time tomorrow i'll be a little more quiet it never happens and i'm tired of deferring my time with the lord to another day when i'm less busy why should god wait for me to get less busy he's the creator of heaven and earth why does he need to wait for me to get less busy like god i don't have time for you right now because i've got weeds growing in the yard all of a sudden we just need to wake up it's it's it's the dream world it's the fantasy world of electronic and entertainment and the the devil's trying to get us drawn into that and trapped into that but there's got to be a people who says i will not be brought under the power of any it's lawful for me it's not sin all things are lawful for me but this is not expedient and i will not be brought unto the power of this thing because i was not put on this earth to live like everybody else lives i am not here to just get along in laodicea i'm not here to multitask and get a bunch of stuff done amen just so i can pay more taxes to the government i am here to serve the purpose that he had on me before the foundation of the world and i'll never catch that purpose without this message and i'll never fulfill it without quieting down and getting direction from god and hearing from him i say god help us abraham had a visitation when he was separated from sodom david wrote hymns when he was separated with the flock moses received the visitation of the pillar of fire and word from the lord when he separated amen paul the apostle paul amen he received the revelation of jesus christ when he went to arabia none of these times were mentally busy times none of these times were full of mental stimulation there were times where they were drawn aside and then brother branham made the statement he said jesus was always fasting and praying and if jesus christ the son of god had to constantly fast and pray what about you and i and i said god help me lord i need your help god i want to be more diligent i want to be free i do not want to be brought under the power of these things but god i'm going to need supernatural help from you amen because there's habits in my life there's things that i'm not even aware of but god if you'll help me god will do everything in my power to dedicate myself to you to dedicate my mind to dedicate my time my attention the things i feed on the things i look at i want to bring them back center to you almighty god i want to shut everything off and pick up an old paper bible when the only thing that i can do with this bible is read god's word i want to go to a place and pray where i cannot hear the vibration of a phone to distract my attention i don't want in my pocket i don't want on the table next to me i do not want to hear a notification tone because i want to hear a notification from him i want to catch that something's coming today i want to catch that little nudge that tells me i need to be quiet i i do not want to be brought under the power of any of these things god has chosen the channel of the mind and i want to give him my mind i want to focus my mind on him i just want to read a couple more scriptures together let's turn to the psalms and we'll wrap up with a couple of scriptures psalms chapter 19. psalms 19 and 14. before that i read that i want to read this quote from greatest battle ever thought he says how does he get in he's talking about satan how does he get in through this mind this door the battlefront standing there how does he get in through the mind that's the door he comes in psalms 19 14 it says let the word of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in my sight o lord my strength and my redeemer that the words of my mouth you know god has hearing too he can hear what we talk about he can hear what we're most enthused about in the whole world what we talk to everybody about the most exciting thing that's ever happened to us he hears what that is and is it him or is it something else that he's hearing all the time let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength in my redeemer let's go to psalms 119. psalms 119 and verse 97. psalms 119 97 oh how i love thy law in the old testament whenever they said the word or the bible they said the law so oh how i love thy word oh how i love thy law it is my meditation all the day amen let it be my meditation all the day too though through thy commandments has made me wiser than mine enemies for they are ever with me i have more understanding than all my teachers for they test for thy testimonies are my meditation i understand more than the ancients because i keep thy precepts friends this is available to you and i because we have the full revelation of the full word of god and we know more than our teachers we know more than anybody else around us we know more than our enemies amen we don't have to know how to operate everything in this world and what's going on and we don't need to know all the catch phrases i think it's wonderful amen blake was telling me one day he's at work and somebody made some statement and they're referring to some something that's trending on tick tock that's gone viral that everybody knows about and somebody said it's like such and such and such and blake just looks at him and the guy goes you've never heard that have you he goes no praise god i don't want to know what they're talking about i don't want to know i want him to look at me and says you don't know about this no i don't know about that is it in the bible if it's in the bible i might know about it i don't want to know what's trending i don't want to know what's viral i don't want to know what the hottest this that and the other is i don't even wanna know what the best game is and i don't even wanna know what the what has the most views i don't i don't wanna know what the greatest toy is gonna be this next christmas season i don't care i don't care i don't care i don't care amen what is it that keeps putting this in my mind i don't want to know i want to know thy precepts i want to know thy law i want to know thy plan for me i want to know what you want me to do oh god help me god to break away from this satan's eden and focus my mind to be singularly focused amen so that my body can be full of this illumination of the word so that i can manifest it in every conversation manifest it in my life praise be to god brother baby says in the forgotten be attitude but i said this that god can use what you yield like samson would not yield his heart to god he give that to delilah but he gave his strength to god and god could only use his strength that's all right so god will use what you yield but if i fall but if a fellow could only yield his complete being to god now that's it if you can heal your body god will use your body if you can yield your mind your heart whatever it is god will use what you give to him to use with he's seeking to find somebody that he can find yielded like that i say if we can give him our mind he'll use our mind he'll reveal his word to us he'll quicken our understanding he will lead us and direct us if we will give him our mind give him our time give him our focus let's look at philippians 4 and 8. philippians chapter 4. philippians chapter 4 verse 8. finally brethren whatsoever whatsoever things are true tell me what's true on your phone other than the message app and the bible app what sovereign things are true what sort of things are honest whatsoever things are just what sort of things are pure what sort of things are lovely whatsoever things are of good rapport if there be any virtue and there are many praise think on these things everything they listed describes the word of god the message of the hour think on these things let's bend our mind to the thing that matters most let's look at malachi chapter 3. this is the last scripture i'd like to read together musicians you can come on up if you'd like to make your way and brother then malachi chapter 3 verse 16 malachi 3 16. this scripture is one that brother gene petrie has quoted to me over and over and over again i think it's one of his favorite scriptures malachi 3 16. then they that feared the lord spake often one to another what is that fellowship and what are they talking about what do they have in common they fear the lord let's read that again then they that feared the lord spake often one to another we should be talking to each other about the word and the lord hearkened and heard it when you're fellowshipping about the word god hears it and listen and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name do you want to be in that book of remembrance i want to be in that book of remembrance it was a book of remembrance amen was written before him for them that feared the lord and and that thought upon his name what do we think about we think about the lord and they shall be mine saith the lord of hosts in that day when i make up my jewels and i will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him i say praise god i want to be in that book of remembrance i who fear the lord want to speak often one to another with somebody else that fears the lord and god will hear it and put it in a book of remembrance those who thought upon his name i'm so excited that we know where his name is we know what his name is we've been given the word that declares his name and we can think on those things i'm so thankful for tapes i'm so thankful for books i'm so thankful for fellowship i'm so thankful for services twice a week i'm so thankful for those things those are the things that should be we should give the most diligent time and attention to because those are the things that will equip us for the civilization of faith listen i don't need to know how to make it in this world because if anything comes that i can't handle i have a father if anything happens that i i can't find my way i have a father i don't need to be the most educated person in the world i don't need to be the most informed person in the world about carnal earthly things but if i can be singularly focused on him he promised he will provide everything i need he promised that he would take care of me he promised he would lead and guide me and that he would order my steps amen i don't need to be informed i don't need to have all the information i've got all the information i need in the word of god and i need to focus on it and let him pick my foot up and put it down let him part the waters let him move whatever and provide whatever i've got to stop trying to be so smart and so informed and so i just need to give my attention to this word and let the word make a way i'm telling you it's hard it's hard for me it's hard for all of us amen we're inundated with this but i will not be brought under the power of these things anymore and i tell you one thing i found when i took my phone and i left my phone all by itself back on the dresser you poor little phone i was in charge and it felt good i wasn't attached to that thing it wasn't stuck on the hip i wasn't worried about it every second of the day when i laid the thing down and walked away from it i mean i know it's just a goofy little bunch of plastic and metal but when i laid that thing down and walked away from it it was like i say you can't control me there's something liberating about taking control we weren't put here to be in subjection we were put here to bring everything into subjection i'm not going to be brought under the power of any of these things though they be lawful i will not be brought under the power because all things that are lawful are not expedient and i want that which is expedient in my life and i want that which will take me out of this life into the next life spend so much time trying to figure out how to live better in this life i don't want to live better in this life i want to get out of this life i want to move to the next one so i want to look at the information that's going to take me there and say god help me let's all stand let's all stand i pray to god that you receive this in the spirit it was sin the spirit it was preached in amen this is where god's been dealing with me this is where i've been learning these are things that i've had to take control of these are things i have to be more diligent about but i don't think i'm the only one i think the world we live in requires that we gird up the loins of our mind and be sober man let's bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father i'm so thankful for your word lord i'm so thankful for this message where your prophet lord will will illuminate that word and show us the day we live in and where the battle is and what we have to do to overcome god i just want to tell you the lord i'm sorry i'm sorry for not being diligent i'm sorry for not being singularly focused i'm sorry lord for being a little loose in my mind but god i'm asking that you'd forgive me and give me the power and the strength lord to come back in line to this word to give you my best time to give you my thoughts to give you my energies to give my best to you lord help me god i'm more determined than ever not to be brought under the power of these things i pray you help me and help these people lord help us as your children lord that we would lord not give our mind away to the devil in all his tools but we would give our mind to you that we would focus on you and lord i pray that you would come through that channel and quicken us lord bring the word to life inside of us build us in faith the lord everything can be overcome by faith that every obstacle can be mounted by faith in every circumstance lord can be overcome by faith help us lord defeat on this word and not give our senses to the devil but let's take all the senses lord help me take all the senses that you give to me and focus them towards you so that i can receive from you god bless us as we go from here help us lord to climb higher than we are now we're not satisfied where we are lord there's got to be a higher walk there's got to be a closer walk there's got to be a greater faith there's got to be more than what we have now lord help us to focus so that we can go to where you want us to be so that we can grow into all that you want us to become help us lord to channel our attention into this word that this word might build faith and that faith might grow in us we love you and we ask that you would take us
