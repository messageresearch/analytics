========================================

let's just bring this down home amen how many times oh my goodness how many times are we tempted to do something that's a little deviation from the word and from the plan of god but it's not something that's completely wrong amen what you know what about what about uh i don't know even i don't what about taking a job amen and taking that job moves you away from fellowship or takes you away amen from church or takes your family away and you say but you know i've got to support my family and it looks like god gives this to me but you know the word says don't forsake the assembling together of yourselves you know that that is the word and it doesn't mean that you never never have to work a job never miss a service i'm not talking about that but i'm just talking about a principle brother ben brought this out and i thought it was so good the principle of it not the law but the principle you can take in a relationship you know this relationship is forbidden by god the prophet speaks against it amen but what you can do is then you can start praying about it and don't think the devil can't give you supernatural experiences to tell you that that's okay don't you think that circumstances won't start lining up or you'll have a dream as a confirmation or somebody will call you up and say you know i was thinking about so-and-so or all right have you ever thought of employment over here don't you think that the devil cannot work in the supernatural and you think it's god giving you the permission to go against his scriptures because it was supernatural but because it was supernatural is no right to go against the word of god so we can look at jesus's temptation but what about our temptations what about the things that come to us what about when we know good and well the prophet taught this the word of god is against it the scripture says but you know what i'm going to go to prayer why if you go to prayer you better be praying that god gets that desire out of your heart so your desire matches his word don't go to prayer to ask god for permission to do something his word forbids listen i mean this works in all kinds of circumstances i mean i i mean if you want to leave one job to go to another but god hasn't given you permission to leave that job it's not wrong to leave a job to go to another that's not sin but we want to be led by the spirit we want to be led of god we want to ask god god do you want me to leave this job and go to this other and you can pray about that until you get supernatural signs and what is it really you'll pray until something matches your own desire that's why brother branham said you have to first get neutral when you go to pray
