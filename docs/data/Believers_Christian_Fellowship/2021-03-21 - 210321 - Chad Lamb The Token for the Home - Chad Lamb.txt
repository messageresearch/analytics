all stand now we'll go to the word let's go to hebrews 11. hebrews chapter 11. okay let's read verse 28 hebrews chapter 11 verse 28 through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them let's bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing lord jesus we thank you lord for this word nor we just ask now as we come to this part of the service lord where there's the preaching of the word we pray that you would take preeminence lord and god that you would yourself by your own hand break the bread of life to us lord for we come to worship you to sing your praises to glorify your name and lord we come to feast from your hand and eat the fresh man and i pray you would provide it now lord i prayed you'd work through this vessel as i yield myself to you and may your holy spirit have free reign in our hearts and our lives and may you change us lord by your word and may you equip us by your word and may you grow us by your word we ask that you would have first place in all things this morning in our lives in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can each be seated and when you're seated let's turn to exodus exodus chapter 12. and in exodus chapter 12 we'll begin at the beginning uh verse chapter or chapter 12 verse 1 and we'll read down to verse 13. and for a text for this morning i'd like to talk about the token for the home and there's a few very specific things that i'd like to highlight and talk about for much of much of this will be review we know a lot of these things but i want to talk about the the things that we understand and the things we know and go over those things again so that we have confidence in what god has given us this day and we want to talk about the application of the token and the token for the home in the effect of that and we want to rehearse these things again so let's go to exodus chapter 12 verse 1 and begin there and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speak you into all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out of the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two sideposts and on the upper doorpost of the house wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the flesh in the in the in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not of it raw nor sodden or all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs with the pertinence thereof and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning that which that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn it with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the lord's passover for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt this is a lengthy reading but we want to highlight from there that that the lamb was for the house that's what the prophet or that's what the prophet moses here is saying god is saying that every household take a lamb the lamb was for the house and he said in the in verse 13 in the blood shall be for you a token upon the houses where you are when i see the blood i will pass over you we know that the death angel was going to strike and and death was coming in the land and this was the promise that if the token was applied then the death angel would pass over and not strike in that house and so god was giving them a a token to given a means of escape from the death angel but you know that was very natural in that day but it's very spiritual in our day because the brother banh said there's really only one kind of life and there's really only one kind of death and real the only real life is eternal life and the only real death amen is spiritual death amen and death is in the land today but there's a way for the death angel to pass amen there is something that we have been given amen that we can be applied there can be a token for the house and the death angel will pass and death will not strike in our lives amen the real death we're worried about i'm not so much worried about going out and passing away today or tomorrow or the next day that's not my concern amen because i have life and because i have life i cannot die this this body can cease to breathe this body can cease its existence upon this earth but i can't die amen but also the only real death is spiritual death amen and the only real life is spiritual life for eternal life and that's what we put all of our focus on but god has given us in this day a token a guard a true token an assurance against the death angel that's marching in this land amen and so we want to apply that with faith let's go to joshua turn forward to the book of joshua chapter 2. as i was saying this is a lot of this is review we've been through these things before but there's just something highlighted in my heart that i really want to gather out of this and and just remind you of again amen and in joshua 2 verse 12 it says now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have showed you kindness that you will show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token now rahab the harlot of of jericho has received the messengers that she received the spies they've brought into her house the message and she has received it and she has believed it and she's guarding them and now she's sending them out and she's asking them for a true token she's asking for the same thing they had a token that saved them in the day that the death angel the destroying angel was passing and brother branham tells us that joshua was the death angel in that day isn't that amazing joshua was not the death age but the destroying angel he was coming to destroy all the heathen but there was one who wanted protection amen from the destruction that was imminent in her day she saw that was coming amen she knew that it was justified but she wanted a protection and that protection would be a true token and she asked the messengers for a true token and then we go to verse 13 and that you will have alive you that you will save alive my father and my mother my brethren and my sisters and all they have and deliver our lives from death and the men answered her our life for yours if you utter not this our business and it shall be when the lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she let then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she said unto them get you to the mountains lest the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned and afterward may you go your way and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou has made us swear behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou just let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house unto the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on on our head if any hand be upon him and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of thine oath which thou has made us to swear and she said according to your words so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the window now we see these are two instances of a token that's been given for salvation in the face of destruction amen one was the token of the the lamb being slain and the blood being applied to the lentil and to the doorpost amen and when the death angel that was striking the land saw the token applied and it's important to realize that brother branham he was very he was very careful of in emphasizing that the token must be applied he said they could take the lamb they could believe in the lamb they could have the right kind of lamb they could see the lamb slain and they could collect the blood but if they left the blood in the bucket and put it by the door it would do no good because that blood had to be applied on the outside of the house and so these are important things that brother bram was bringing to our attention and we we want to pay attention to those and be reminded of them again and again because it was the token that was applied and so it was for the home and now rahab amen the harlot she sees destruction coming in the day of destruction and the day of death amen she wants salvation for her and for her family and they tell her and she received the message she believed the message she believed in the god that they were talking about and she received it by faith amen and then she said i want a token amen a true token and they said take this scarlet thread and bind it on in my window so that we can see it amen you got to put the token you have to apply it on the outside so that it can be seen and it can be visible and when a token is applied and the token is on display amen when the destruction when the destroying angel passes by that home will be under protection no death or destruction will come because they have a token but they have a token applied see it's really interesting to note for me that where did the scarlet thread come from amen she she had a scarlet thread she had a scarlet card that she let them down by amen and there was something that was in her house and i presume it was in her house i don't know maybe the spies brought it but but the way the text reads it looks as if she already had this cord and she let them out of the window by this cord so she had something in her home amen that could be salvation for the home when it was applied when it was displayed when what she let them down by amen what she aided them by and helped them by when they she would they would take that cord and bind it to the outside of the window now when the token was on display when the token was applied and on display it meant now salvation for this home so we don't ever want to we don't ever want to miss these points because they're important because you know it's not so much it's not just what we believe that matters because there's a lot of people who say they believe i believe this and i believe that i believe the message and but it's the application of the token it's the it's the token we're going to talk about what the token is in a minute but it's the token that's put on display it's the token that's applied and put on display and then that becomes the protection for that house so talk is cheap we can say we believe we can say that we believe we can say that uh you know i believe the message and i believe that god sent a prophet i believe in the message of the seventh angel amen but there has to be a token applied and that token has to be on display and that token is for the house that token is for the home and so these these is where i'm drawing my context out of these two scriptural passages brother bennett says in the message the token and remember israel come through many things but it was evening time when the token was required not in the morning not in the preparation the 14 days of keeping up the lamb israel knows something was coming so did luther know it so did wesley know it so did finney knox calvin know it this is it they knew there would come a time that the pillar of fire would return back to the church they know there would come a time that these things would happen but they didn't live to see it and they looked forward to it israel knew something was coming but it was in the evening time when the lamb's blood the token was placed on the door yet the lamb was already put up you know we've talked about this many times but just to bring it fresh to our minds and our memory amen that that brother brahma is now telling us he's going back and he's picking up the the he's picking up the passover and he's showing that there was a lamb and the lamb had to be kept up and it had to be a lamb without blemish and without spot it had to be kept up and it had to be watched over to make sure that it was a good lamb a healthy lamb a perfect lamb and once it was identified and kept up and held in place and proved to be a perfect lamb without spot without blemish there was no weakness there was no sickness there was no problem with the lamb then once that was taken that taken place in the evening time they took and they slew the lamb and they took the blood and they applied the blood the blood became a token and that token was a display on the outside of the home amen and that was for salvation so brother brahma is telling us it wasn't in the morning it was in the evening time and what brother ben was pointing to is the evening time message he's pointing to this day that we live in now and he said he goes back says luther knew wesley knew calvin and knox and finney they all knew this was coming and he says israel knew something was coming because they were holding this lamb they knew something was coming but it was in the evening time when the lamb's blood the token was placed on the door yet the lamb was already put up it's been the lamb all the way through it was the lamb in luther's time it was the lamb in wesley's time but now is the token time that each house must be covered by the token each house of god must be covered by the token now brother van is now he's making a distinction and a distinct point and the place we've come through the church ages and the time that we're now in he said they had the lamb and luther's time they had the word they had christ the word amen they were holding it up making sure it was a perfect word as god was building it back through justification and sanctification and the baptism holy ghost they were watching it making sure there was no blemish there was no spot that it was a good word it was a perfect word but in the evening time amen that lamb was slain and the blood that come from that lamb amen was going to be a token because a token was required in the evening time when the time of destruction was upon the earth their hat and the judgment was coming amen there had to be a token that they could take in display by an application and display that would mean salvation in that day and you know they had the lamb he says it's been the lamb the lamb's been there the word's been moving through amen the lamb's been there but but in the evening time now is the token time that each house must be covered by the token each house of god must be coverted by the token so when we talk about this token for the home i'm going to highlight two different things and they run on parallel tracks and and i hope that you can you can stay with me on this we want to talk about the application of the token in our homes in our homes as families and our homes as individuals and then we want to talk about the application of the token because it's very pertinent things that brother branham says in the application but also in our home the house of god where the the temple of the holy ghost us as individuals that's why brother branham said each house of god must be covered by the token that's each individual amen so if you sit here today and you don't have a wife and children or a husband and children this still applies to you amen this is for the single this is for the families this is for the old this is for the young this is for every age in between and every status of life this applies amen but there'll be times that i'm referring to family life amen but they run on parallel tracks they work just the same for the individuals they do for the family each house of god must be covered by the token all that's inside of it must be covered by the token and the house of god is the body of jesus christ and by one spirit we're all baptized in this token and become part of it that god said when i see this token displayed i'll pass over you what an hour that we're now living a blood identified identified the believer because the life had gone out could not come back so he had to have a chemistry he had to have a pain a blood a chemistry that showed that life went from it now the very spirit itself is the token the holy spirit itself is the token not the blood the blood was shed at calvary that is true but the blood as far as it is went back into the elements from which it come from the food that he lived on but you see inside that blood cell was a life and that started the blood cell to moving it was the chemistry had no life in it itself and therefore it could not move but when the life come into the chemistry of the blood it formed a cell it formed its own cell then cell after cell then it become a man and that man was god a manual in flesh but when the life returned back the chemistry went to it but the token is the holy ghost upon the church that they see christ the brotherhood is telling us now it's not a physical blood there was physical blood that was shed at calvary and that blood was the was the price the exchange price paid for our redemption but he's saying in this time in this age in this token time now the life that was inside of that blood that life has been released now he said in the in the passover all they had was chemistry all they could do is take physical blood and paint it on a door to make it red so that there was a display and application and that application proved that they were a genuine believer they believed the message because they obeyed the message amen we say we believe but don't obey then everything's in question you know but they they obeyed the message showing on the outside of the house that they believed what the prophet had said because they did exactly what he said to do they took the blood and they applied the blood the way they were told amen and it left a distinction a display of the there was a life that there was a lamb and that life of that lamb was given in exchange for redemption and salvation and now in order for us to be saved remember it is so important in the evening time when the death angel is passing is they they if they slayed the lamb if they took the perfect lamb without blemish and slayed the lamb and collected the blood amen and they kept the blood by the door there was still no salvation for that house although they come part way amen they had to obey every word they had to believe the whole message partial partial faith didn't bring salvation in that day but a complete faith brought a complete obedience and now there was a display of faith amen there was a display that that there was a life that was given in exchange and that life now is on display and on display the application put it on display and now the death angel would pass so that's why brother brahma is telling us now we've come to the day and it's amazing he said it was the lamb and luther's day the lamb and wesley's day he said but now it's token time the token the life amen the life of the word the life that was in the lamb amen the life that was in the blood now that has to come back upon the church and it has to be on display it has to be applied and it has to be on display brother mum said in desperations desperations was the evening message he preached token the first time he preached token he preached it in the morning and in the evening he comes in preaches desperations and in the beginning of that message he refers back to the morning message he says now the same thing about this token the token we have talked to the token all all the way along but now is the manifestation of the token we've talked about the token we've talked about the baptism holy ghost we talked about the life of jesus christ but now is the manifestation of the token that it has to be made manifest now we have sometimes allowed it the lutherans allowed it to accepting the word accepting christ's personal savior the methodist said when you get happy enough to shout that's it the pentecostals say speak in tongues then you got it and we find out that all of it was wrong see the token is the token it's you and christ as persons together see it's the holy spirit his life in you working his own life through you and it's for the rich the poor or for whosoever will receive it so now we know clearly what this token is in this day amen and that token has got to be applied it's the life of jesus christ in you it's you and christ together as persons and his life living through you and that has to be on display it's got to be applied and it's got to be on display on the outside of this house not just something we believe on the inside but it has to be on display on the outside let's turn to revelation chapter 5 and grab another scripture here revelation chapter 5 and verse 6 and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne into the four beasts and in the midst of the elder stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne brother bam was referring to the scripture in the breach but i wanted to read this scripture and show that that when we saw the lamb we saw him as a bloody lamb when he comes to take the book of redemption he's a bloody lamb brother ben refers to this in the breach the message the breach he says now he said the line of the tribe of judah why out of judah a judah a lawgiver shall not go before or between thy knees until shiloh comes but he will come through judah and the lion the symbol of tribe of judah has prevailed he's overcome and when he looked around to see where the lion was he saw a lamb strange he looked for a lion and he see a lamb the odor called him a lion but when john looked he saw a lamb a lamb as it had been slain from the foundation of the world a lamb having been slain what was it what was that lamb it was bloody wounded a lamb that had been slain but was alive again and he was bloody oh my how can you look at that folks and remain a sinner a lamb stepped up the elder said a lion has overcome the lion of the tribe of judah and john looked to see the lion and there come a lamb shaking blood on him wounds he had prevailed he could tell he's been in battle he's been slain but he was alive again john hadn't noticed this land before you know here he hadn't been mentioned before nowhere had it been mentioned john didn't see it all over the heavens as he was looking but here he come forth notice where it came forth where did it come from it come from the father's throne where he had been seated since he had been slain and raised again he raised up and set on the right hand of god ever living to make intercessions amen raised there today as an intercessor with his own blood to make intercession upon the ignorance of the people no that's the one i'm depending on he still was covered with bleach the bleach of the forgiveness of sins john looked at the lamb and the lamb looked like he'd been slain and then he noticed he was wounded and cotton bruised and bleeding a bloody lamb that's what took our place it's amazing when we come to this breach amen and the lamb steps forward then we know that he was the word made flesh amen he was the logos the word and the word was made flesh and he was the word made flesh and and he gave his life and he gave us blood amen and when the blood was shed the life was released so that the life could come back into us but when we look at that picture now of him standing there in the breach to take the book amen he's still a bloody lamb amen he was bloody all the way through and we're gonna read some more things that brother branham said but i want you to catch this image in your head that he was always a bloody lamb he was the bloody the bleeding lamb because we need the blood and we get to the message things that are to be it says oh but the other one is called my father's house i'll go and prepare a place for you take you out of this pesthouse and deliver you into my father's house amen there you are take you out of this old earthly pest house he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there the bible said so jesus said be there for perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect it's a perfect kingdom so it must be a perf a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to the to a perfect son of god and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of god which is the waters of separation that washes us from our sins amen that's right the blood of jesus christ think of it the dripping bloody word now these are statements brother brennan makes and just hold on to them amen don't don't try to process them on your mind we're going to talk about these things but he was a bleeding lamb amen and we have to have the dripping bleeding word amen amen and because there's got to be an application of the blood of the blood life the life that was in the blood has got to be applied amen so there's got to be a fountain springing forth in our day there has to be a bleeding lamb somewhere there has to be a fresh blood somewhere so that there can be an application of the blood the dripping bloody word amen the blood the word of god bleeding blood to wash the bride in he just said we're washed by the water of the word amen and the word was made flesh and the word bled for us the lead the word died for us amen he was a it was a sacrificial lamb and he was bleeding and as he was bleeding he was giving out the life amen and the life was coming out as he was bleeding so that the life could come back in us to be the token in this day and that token can be applied in our lives and be on display so it come from the bleed as he was bleeding amen the life was coming out so he has to be a bleeding a bloody word a bleeding the word of god bleeding blood to wash the bride and amen yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place amen she was trapped into it in the message the invisible union of the bride of christ is what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you and you are washed in bleeding word now listen to what brother ben is saying i mean we've heard these things so many times and i don't want to become common i don't want to skip over it amen but but i want to find where that bleeding word is because where the bleeding word is there's a life coming forth amen because that was the purpose of the blood the blood came forth to physically pay a price of redemption but so that a life could come forth and that life could come forth and be a token in this day so it's important that the the word is bleeding amen the life of god in the word and the word is bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleansed and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on god and on his word it's interesting to know that brother branham he was preaching and he was you i don't have notes on it but just comes to mind that he was he was talking about you know jerusalem was the the the the place the center amen of god's church the center that god established for worship and but jerusalem became the seat of the nominate of the denomination amen and man got in and corrupted god's ways and added his own reasoning and it became the seat of denomination for the jews and and jerusalem was in effect and it remained in effect until a change came and that change is when the word was made flesh and the word the lamb of god amen that taketh away the sin of the world that lamb was there and they were keeping up the lamb for a period of time watching him to make sure that he didn't fail on any of the word and he kept all of the commandments of god and after he was proved to be a perfect lamb with no spot no blemish amen the high priest took him and they slayed him he became the passover lamb for the nation amen and they slayed that lamb and and the blood came out amen for the remission of our sins and that life went forth amen from that body and and now you know now brother branham said jerusalem was in effect because it was established by god but jerusalem was in effect till that day and after that day then it was the lamb of god there was a change in that day and brother brenham comes into his day and he says now there's another change amen he said it's been you know it it's it's been the word it's been the lamb amen but but now they've taken and they've crucified afresh the son of god he preaches this in the indictment and he says now they've taken this word brother branham had given the word he had given the perfect interpretation the word with divine vindication he had been the he'd done what he was supposed to do as the seventh angel and under the seventh angels message there was a a revelation of the mystery of god and it was rejected and as it was rejected they took and they slew amen he says i condemned this generation for the second crucifixion of jesus christ jesus christ in what form in the form of the word he come forth in the word and they took the word and they slew it again amen and i tell you friends it proves that there's still a blood flowing from that lamb today and he said after that day now it's the word and the word only amen now it's no longer he would work through denominations he would work through systems because like he worked through jerusalem was it perfect in jesus day no was it perfect 20 years before he got there no there was corruption in it it was mixed amen but god but jerusalem was still in effect until they slayed the lamb until they took the son of god the lamb of god and they slayed it you could still find god through jerusalem you could still come in obedience to the commandments and find forgiveness of sins and all of these things because jerusalem was in effect until they took the lamb until they took jesus christ and crucified him and the blood was shed and the life was released and that that day it switched from jerusalem to christ to the lamb but in this day amen they took jesus christ again the word that came in fullness he was the fullness of the word made flesh amen and he come back the fullness of the word and they took the fullness of the word and they rejected it and they slayed it and when they slayed it now the denominations is no longer in effect these systems of man is no longer in effect now it's the word and the word only no more partial no more mixing now it's the word and the word only amen it's very important because after the crucifixion of jesus christ amen now to go back to the old system in the old way what was accepted and what would bring salvation and repentance and forgiveness of sins was no longer in effect and now you had to move and find where the life was where you could have a token now amen where you could be forgiven and in this day it's the same thing the old system is not working anymore amen because there's been a change at the second crucifixion of jesus christ and now it's the word and the word only and we've got to come to the full word amen to find the token to find the true token to find the assurance for salvation in this day because destruction is in the land judgment is here again there's got to be an application of a token to save us from destruction in this day and it has to come from the bleeding word the word was crucified in this generation but the life of the word was restored to the church the life of the word came back again and that is a token to the church it's the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word is bled for you you know when i look at this i just can't help but say that there's a continual fountain that's flowing that's giving out blood that's giving out the life of the word amen is it rejected in this day yes is it pierced in this day absolutely but but through all the piercing and all the rejection amen there's a life that's coming from the word there's a blood that's coming out from the word amen that can be a token in this day and that token can be applied and the applied token is on display and it's an assurance against the death angels and assurance against the day of destruction but we have to have the fresh bleeding word let's go back to leviticus 17. i want to read two scriptures back to back the first one will be from leviticus leviticus 17 and 13. leviticus 17 and 13. we're going to read 13-14 and whatsoever man there be of the children of israel of the strangers that so join among you which hunteth and catcheth any beast or foul that that may be eaten he shall even pour out the blood thereof and cover it with dust for it is the life of all flesh the blood of it is for the life thereof therefore i said unto the children of israel you shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut off that's where this principle comes from it comes from god god is the one who established this he said the life is for the blood thereof and you're not to eat the the blood and any in any beast any animal anything you kill pour the blood out to god because the blood represents the life and god's the one who's given all life and you're not to take of the blood you're to pour it out amen because because it's the life and it represents the life so don't drink the blood let's go to john chapter 6. john chapter 6 and verse 53. john chapter 6 53 then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you accept you eat the flesh of the son of man and drinketh his blood you have no life in you now you understand now that we see the picture this is what jesus was talking to jews he was talking to jews who understood the law they knew what was in leviticus what we just read that they were forbidden amen to drink the blood of anything because the blood represents the life the blood is for the life and that blood has to be poured out and not taken because god gives a life and here comes jesus christ standing here talking to jews who had heard this their whole life and had practiced it the whole life of pouring it out and now he stands here and he's telling them i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you why because the blood is for the life amen now to get the life you have to drink the blood amen and what is the blood amen the blood is for the life so when the blood was shed it represents the life coming forth and the life comes out and now you have to drink the life amen unless you drink his blood you have no life in you no wonder they protested because they knew amen they knew they weren't to do this because it the blood represents the life and it would be an abomination to god because god gave life amen but but it was god's life that was in jesus christ and he's standing there saying unless you drink my blood amen you have no you have no life you have no life unless you drink my blood you have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him amen jesus knew what he was saying and he meant what he was saying you know we we know that he was the word made flesh and he said you must eat my flesh you must eat the word but you also must drink my blood and if you don't drink my blood you have no life in you it's not enough amen just to play the tapes and read the bible and agree with it but there has to be a receiving of the blood a receiving of the life the life has to come amen and if you don't drink my blood you have no life in you you can eat the flesh but if you don't drink the blood amen in leviticus they could eat the flesh but not drink the blood but now jesus is saying i am the sacrifice i am the lamb amen and now you have to eat the flesh and drink the blood because you have to have the word and you have to have the life of the word [Music] it was the lamb the word and luther's day the word in wesley's day but now is token time amen now you have to receive the life not partial but in fullness let's turn to matthew 26. matthew 26 and verse 26 this is the passover meal jesus is in the last supper with his disciples and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to his disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins he's now sitting with his disciples and he's giving them bread he said this is my body amen it's not his literal body he's giving them a representation amen that's where the catholic church and so many have picked it up and went wrong amen they've made uh they've made a ceremony and a prayer of the priest amen to have an effect where it can turn uh pieces of bread or the bread into the literal life of the body of jesus christ so that they break it or they give it to you and you you now have received the word or you have to receive the body and they have a wine that they drink and now you receive the blood jesus was just giving this as a token he was giving this as a representation amen because that's why uh you'll just put it this way you can eat all the bread you want and drink all the wine you want amen but if you don't have that life the destroying angels still going to destroy you but when he says eat my flesh and drink my blood that means you're holy partaking of the lamb amen you're receiving all of the word you're feasting on the word and you're receiving the life of the word the life of the blood amen is coming into you and and that will be a token unto you when it's on display when it's been applied when it's on display and you will not be destroyed in the season of the destroying angel you got to have the right blood the right life it has to be a bleeding word i mean the uh it would say it if i could say it this way it must be a bleeding word it can't be a word where all the blood has already spilled out you understand it can't be the old order of just just taking the animal without the life but there's got to be a bleeding word in our day so that we can have the word and the life of the word we have to find a bleeding word it's got to be a word that's dripping with blood it's got to be the lamb that steps forward and is bloody it is bleeding there's got to be a bloody word so that we can receive the life of the word because we're supposed to take the body and the blood i hope this is hitting home i hope it's making sense i hope it's showing our day i want us to understand what we have in this day this this is not a sermon where i'm trying to get you to get to something i'm trying to show you what we have amen because we have to have confidence in what's been given to us and what we have amen you know rahab had to have confidence in that scarlet thread amen israel had to have confidence in that blood that they painted over the length on the door but they had to know that it would do the job amen because they had faith in it she had to have faith for the saving of her household amen and we have to have faith in what god has given us we have to know what god has given us and have faith in what god has given us and not chase after some other means of salvation and deliverance in the day of judgment but he's already given us what we have need of the word has been put into effect it's still a bleeding bloody word there's still as he's bleeding there's still a life that's coming from this word it's still a fountain that's open amen for cleansing and healing and deliverance and salvation there's still a fountain open friends there's still a bleeding word in our day in god's only provided place of worship the prophet says now there is a way a pure holy way an only meeting place that god will meet you not because you say god now i'm a good methodist i'm a good baptist i'm a good pentecostal no because that you are in jesus the word the part of the word that's being manifest today this day's message not luther wesley's pentecostal but your jesus the reflection that has come up into this you can't go back to that that's adding leaven to your bread amen man shall live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god in its season further down in the message god's only provided place of worship i guess further up i got them out of sequence jesus said i come in my father's name and you receive me not you want the scripture on that saint john 5 43 i come in my father's name and you receive me not then the father put his own name which is jesus in the son and he is the way he is the door he is the house he's where god chose to put his name god never put his name in me he never put it in the church he never put it in the methodist baptist catholic but he put it in christ the anointed emmanuel and the name is in the word now listen everything you do both in word and do do all in the name of jesus christ where's his name his name is in the word amen millions of people can recite a name amen they can say that name in multiple languages with different dialects they can say the name but they have nothing it doesn't produce anything amen they're supposed to do everything in that name but all they have is a vocabulary all they have is air passing over vocal cords an air passing over vocal cords won't produce anything amen it has to be a revelation it has to be the the right word and the right season in the right time by the right revelation which is faith and then it will produce what it's supposed to produce and where is the name the name is in the word so without the word how can you take the name and the name is in the word because he is the word amen what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god you understand what we have in this day the word interpreted we've got the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication we have the word interpreted the word interpret is the manifestation of the name amen and it didn't change the name the name is still jesus christ we still pronounce it the same amen but it doesn't have the same effect now it comes with the life with the full revelation because with the full word his name is in the word when we have the word for our season and for our day it brings the life with it and now when we say that name it has life behind it because the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god not that somehow we secretly get a new pronunciation and if you hold your mouth right and say it rest right and it's the same name that we've known all through the church ages amen but now he comes in the fuller it is the mighty god unveiled before us it is god who has taken the veil off the mystery of god is now revealed and the interpretation of the word is the manifestation of the name of god and now we've got something more than a pronunciation we've got an understanding we've got a knowing we have a personal knowledge of jesus christ he's been made personal to us he's revealed personally to us and the in the name is in the word see we're talking about the token is for the home amen when we go to our homes and establish our homes on the token it's not hocus pocus it's not incantation it's not enchantments amen it's not well i believe the message everything's fine no it's got you got to have this word you've got to have this life amen it's got to be on display there's got to be an application of this life and when it's on display then the death angel will pass it's got to be real it's got to be genuine it's got to be the reality of the message not a not an acknowledgement of the message and not not being friends with the message but it's got to actually the message has got to be alive inside of you because his name is in the word i mean there's all kinds of token words given and i believe brother there was a prophet i believe this and i believe that but there's absolutely no manifestation of the life and if there's no manifestation of the life there is no guard against the day of destruction friends but it's got to be an application of the life that is on display without hypocrisy what kills families what kills young people what kills churches is hypocrisy that what happens at home is not the same as what happens at church and the things we say around believers and the way we act and the things we do is not the way we act in the things we do and how we around unbelievers we want we want a token for our home we want to bring our children under the token and we'll talk more about that later we want to bring everybody around us under the token but there's got to be a true token and it's got to be applied by faith it's got to be real it's got to be genuine it's got to be the same token at church it's got to be the same token at home because remember when we read in exodus and we we read also in joshua that the token was for the home that's why i'm so encouraged by the things that i see i was here wednesday night and wednesday night we played a tape many of you were here we played a tape we played the second part that we're listening to it is the rising of the sun and afterwards we had a worship service started singing songs and and the worship was sweet and then as we sang more songs people trickled out one by one as they had need to go and i sat over here because the atmosphere was good and i just wanted to sit and i was sitting there and worshiping and pretty soon you know another would go another would go another would go until i looked around and the majority of who was sitting here worshiping standing with their hands lifted up was our young people teenagers and young adults i said thank you god there's something real in those homes because teenagers catch hypocrisy like that i mean fast and they won't stand for it but when i looked around and i seen young men young women girls and boys mom and dad's already gone sorry young people i don't say this to make you feel bad or make you feel awkward but mom and dad was gone most of the adults were gone but there's young people standing there lifting their eyes closed heads up worshiping god that's what i want something that produces reality it's a token that brings something real into the hearts and lives of of young people our children amen not hypocrisy not a double standard not something that causes confusion and questioning amen but something that they they can look at and say that's real amen there's many many of you who are older than me has had to suffer with with children you've done everything right you applied the token at home you lived the word amen and they still left amen but but don't believe that that token didn't take effect amen don't allow yourself to believe that no matter what you see amen no matter what your eyes declare don't doubt the fact that if you lived a genuine life before them and i'm not talking about a perfect life i'm talking about a genuine life not a double standard not hypocrisy but you nobody lives a perfect life everybody fails and makes mistakes but they saw repentance they saw forgiveness they saw a dad a mom who would line back to the word and line back to the word and line back to the word if they saw something genuine if they saw a token on display amen don't ever doubt the power and effect that we'll have friends amen don't let the devil discourage you because when things get bad amen when things fall to pieces they know what truth is and they know what reality is and they know where it was real remember the prodigal son had got away from his father's love he had gone away from his father's house and under his father's protection and under his father's token but when he got down to nothing he knew he knew he could go back to his father's house there was no doubt that his father would be gone there was no doubt that his father would have backslid he had no doubt that father would have disappeared he knew dad would be there because he must have seen something real and dad there must have been a reality a life a genuineness where he knew that dad would be there doing what he's always done because dad is faithful [Music] amen we have to have confidence in what god given us this day if we put the life on display amen and we've done all that that god had required we've done it all with the best of our heart with pure intentions with pure motives with our heart in the right place don't don't lose confidence in the power of the token it doesn't matter what we see we will see what we need to see in due season but we must believe the promise for our day we must believe the word for this day and the power that that word brings and the life of that word what it will produce so i was encouraged on wednesday night listen friends we play the tape we play the tape we didn't whoop it up we didn't we didn't preach it up we played a tape and we began to worship and there was teenagers in laodicea who would stay and raise their hands and worship god we underestimate the power of the token but let's not do it let's know what god has given us let's understand what god's put in our hands and let's have faith in it rahab had faith in that scarlet thread because it was she was obeying what she was commanded to do and when she did what they said do took it and put it on display amen then she could go run around and gathering all her house and bringing them under her token because she had confidence that this token will hold in the day of destruction this will hold amen the fathers who would paint the little and the doorposts amen in egypt that day they had confidence that the token would hold the death angel would pass and we're in a day of destruction friends and then we see destruction all around us but the destruction i'm worried about is not that kind of destruction where you lose money and there's wars and bombs are falling the destruction i'm worried about is the destruction of souls amen where the death angel is coming in and bringing spiritual death into lives what's the guard against that amen you may raise a boy or a girl to be successful in this life they may hold down a job they may be good parents they may be able to have a house and and then pay their bills and be good citizens and do all of that but if the death angel strikes spiritual death in their lives what good did it do friends but what they need is they need to know what the token is and see it on display this this is the day for the manifestation of the token not to talk about it but to manifest the token and it brings a power with it because it's the life of jesus christ he said the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god no wonder flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who i am and upon this rock i'll build my place of worship and the gates of hell can't shake it down amen a living church of god standing in firm foundation on jesus christ alone you can sing the song but if you're not on christ the word you're on teetering faltering sand but upon this rock christ my word let's go to revelation 19. all of these are familiar scriptures but they mean so much to us in this day that we live in they're familiar yes we know what they say but they mean so much to us let's not let them lose their meaning revelation 19 11 and i saw heaven open and behold a white horse he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he'd judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with the vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god his name is called the word of god and the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name he jesus christ absolutely but his name represents his person his person represents his personal presence and his personal presence is here with the word he came when the word was restored the life came back and the presence of god is here among us and the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of god the anointed ones at the end time brother brahma says jerusalem jerusalem how oft i would would i from the beginning of time not a third person somebody else but i i would have hovered you as a hen did her brood but you would not but now your hours come see where the carcasses the eagles will gather but after the carcass is rotten then the buzzards gather see notice moses he never give the children of god moses was an eagle and he never gave the children of god noah's leftovers he had the fresh word of god the lord god met him in the wilderness and confirmed his word and sent him down there to call to call you out then they were coming impersonators around impersonating at sea but he had the word of the hour because god said to abraham the one who had the promise your seed shall so join in a strange land for 400 years but i'll visit them and take them out with a mighty hand moses said now the lord god will speak to me and show me and as told me what to do and i tell you said i am sent me i am not i was or will be i am the present tense the word now not the word that was or word that will come the word that's noun see you get it i am i am is the word let that statement soak in i am is the word he said not not the word that was or the word that will be i am is the word if i want the word and the life of the word i have to find the i am that i am is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god is that right i am god sent me as this prophet to vindicate this to be true i am the answer to this word to this word told me come down here and do this and when he did it pharaoh said well we got plenty of boys in our group can do that too impersonators jesus said now that's going to repeat again in the last days see claiming the same thing watch who come down first watch who stayed with the word that's it that's how it's known see you see we notice moses never give them what was noah's time we'll build an ark now because that's the word you know noah built an ark one day no vultures was eating on that let's think now think of today he said moses couldn't say and you know let's build an ark and that that's the word it it was the word amen what is the word is always the word that's the eternal word of god he don't know how to build an ark but that word was for that day and he could not bring it to this day he said buzzers was feeding on that but he started off this by saying where the carcass is there the eagles will gather not buzzards vultures was eating on that no no no this is a promised word notice for this message he had from god he had the genuine predestinated word of god for that hour neither did jesus serve them moses is left over moses had the word for that hour but moses was a prophet here is god himself see he never served them moses is left over you know how offensive that kind of statement was to the jews they studied moses and they had the word of moses and it was the word of god it's what god gave them it's what god gave them to move them forward in the program of god amen the word always came to move them forward in the program of god he would send a fresh word for that day the eagles would gather that word and he would move forward his program amen the problem was not that that was good word the problem was when they moved forward amen the life was always in the present tense word the fresh kill of the word with the blood with the life was always in present tense amen but when they would go back to the old and vultures would go back to that and you know how offensive that was to the jews it's just offensive today when say we're not going back to pentecostal teaching we're not going back to baptist teaching we're not going back to catholic teaching amen the buzzers are feeding on that but where the carcass is the eagles will gather that's an offensive statement to many but if they would just turn and look at it differently it's the most liberating statement in the world because there's a place today there's a fountain today there's a bleeding word today bleeding out life and his name is in the word and the word interpreted is the manifestation of his name amen you can have him and know him and unite with him and have his name when you have the word interpreted for your day what's been given to us everything we need neither did jesus sir then moses left over moses had the word for that hour but moses was a prophet here's god himself he never saw them moses left over but just look at the vultures there in that organization was glutting over it we know we got moses we don't have to have you he said if you'd have known moses you would know me because moses spake of me oh my where the carcass is the eagles will gather eagles the fresh kill of the word here's another one of brother benham's statements and i want it to be not just a statement we've heard but i want to come home now this morning like it's never come home before he's talking about the bleeding word a bloody word a dripping word and he's talking about the fresh kill of the word amen it all all these statements go together where the carcasses the eagles will gather eagles the fresh kill of the word the word that raised up and and fattened and made and made manifest and give out to the food for the children now the old carcass that's laid there for hundreds of years there it'll be same now luther had a message of repentance but you bunch of lutheran buzzards baptist had a message but you baptist buzzard see the pentecost had a message come home now pentecostal buzzards but where the carcass is there the eagles will gather remember you couldn't feed lutheran back in them days uh catholic a carrion no sir he had fresh meat that was that church age you couldn't feed methodist lutheran message oh no he didn't want that carrying this rotten see the life had then left it and went into something else but that's the old stalk that's dead back there the life is moving on neither can you feed the bride of jesus christ pentecostalism no indeedy maggot blown organization nothing doing no no for the promises and before that great and terrible day shall come i will send unto you elijah the prophet he will restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers again all these promises has been made in the bible i will do it and there the eagles will gather all that the father has given me will come to me where will the eagles gather wherever that elijah ministry brought us back to the faith of the fathers and there the word has been restored and the mystery of god has been unveiled amen and the eagles will feed on the fresh kill of the word and the fresh kill of the word is a bloody word there's a token available from the bloody word let's turn to matthew 24. matthew 24 and we'll start at verse 27. matthew 24 and 27 for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even into the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together this is where brother bran was talking about this scripture and where the carcass is the eagles will be gathered and you can find it again in luke 17. but when you read this it reminded me of a verse in job if you'll turn with me back to job job 39. job 39 and 27 let the eagle mount up a thyme command and make her nest on high she dwelt and abideth on the rock upon the crag of the rock and the strong place now listen friends take this home where does the ego go on high the eagle maker she abideth on the rock the rock of revelation upon the crag of the rock and the strong place because christ is a uh he's a mighty tower the word of the lord is a tower that the righteous run into and are safe from then she seeketh the prey in her eyes behold afar off her young ones also suck up the blood and where the slain are there is she this is the same thing that they're saying over in matthew where the carcass is there the eagles will gather but i thought it was so interesting the description of the eagle that god is giving to job amen the eagle mounts up on high on the rock and the crag of the rock and the strong place from there she seeketh her prey where does she seek her prey from the high rock of revelation where she can see her young ones also suck up blood and where the slain are there she is where the carcass is the eagles are gathered and i want to i want to say her young ones amen she's taken her young ones to the fresh kill she has taken her young ones to the fresh kill of the word or brought the fresh kill of the word back to her young ones but her young ones amen as they're feeding on the fresh kill of the word are sucking up the blood and in our homes amen we want to feed our children the right diet amen so that they can receive the blood we want to give them the fresh kill of the word for this day amen we want to talk about the message we want to demonstrate the message we want to live out the message before them we want to bring them the fresh kill of the word so that our children can be feeding on the fresh kill of the word and that they can suck up the blood because this is a bleeding word friends the eagle the eaglets can take it amen the eaglets can receive it amen the eaglets of all the ages and all the anointings on the ages you have lion and ox and man and eagle lion oxen man start on milk but a little eagle starts on meat amen eaglets can handle the meat it may be a smaller portion it may be bite-sized they may not be able to take the portion that mama eagle can but they start on meat and they drink up the blood and in our homes and with other people amen let's give them the fresh kill of the word because it has the blood the fresh kill of the word is the bleeding bloody word the word that's bleeding the fresh kill of the word has the life of the word in it and the message the oddball brother bam says i don't believe i was ever in any sweeter worship and fellowship brother man's going to start talking and he's going to start talking about atmosphere he says i don't believe i was ever in any sweeter worship and fellowship as these songs and things that i sit there and bit my lips and shake my feet and try to hold myself back from screaming out when i heard those old songs saying in the way i think they ought to be sung and that's sung in the spirit and that's the way he ought to be sung sung in the spirit now that's why paul said if i sing i'll sing in the spirit now i can't imagine the spirit as being screaming to the top of our voice i think the spirit of christ is love and gentleness and peace and that brings something to our souls that feed us i think there that's the way them songs should be saying i'm going to go back and read this again because you can talk about the old songs that sung right in the right way they're sung in the spirit and he says i and he records paul if i sing i'll sing in the spirit now i can't imagine the spirit as being screaming to the top of our voice i think the spirit of christ is love gentleness and peace and that brings something to our souls that feed us i think there that's the way them songs should be saying and to be here with you i dedicated people to a cause cause of christ there's just so many things i could say that time would wouldn't permit me i come i thought well i'll run up and visit brother leo and the church up there and the portion of the body of christ that's waiting for his coming and part of the bride that's so joining here and how you've separated yourself from the rest of the world and come over here to live this way i was thinking even the little creek you're on the side of jordan now you're in the land here you're come over on an exodus coming out of the world into a place where you can congregate yourselves together and worship god really according to the dictates of your conscience and that's what we stand for as a democracy as a nation we stand for this very thing that each man can worship and it's just too bad we don't have more like this that's right where that let the world be in their place in god's people in their place where we can have this and i certainly if i said amen and walked out the door i'd say it would pay me every sunday to drive up here or have my children even to come up to set under an atmosphere like this because it's always the atmosphere that brings the results remember we want the token applied for the home and and brother bam was talking about a church a small group that was set aside and separated from the world and many he loved the worship and the consecration and the dedication and the separation and they had the right atmosphere that he wanted to get his children into that atmosphere because it's always the atmosphere that brings the results you can lay a seed out there in the ground no matter how much that seed is dermatized and lay it there it's got to have an atmosphere to make it live that sun has got to come a certain power before and bring it to a certain atmosphere an egg has to have an atmosphere or it won't hatch no matter how fertile it is it's got to have that atmosphere and i think that in a group like this christians hatch out are born again in such an atmosphere as this that encourages me because we can set an atmosphere we can set an atmosphere around us we can set an atmosphere in our homes we can set atmospheres we gather here in the church and if there's a if there's a fertile egg there under the right atmosphere it'll hatch out and brother branham said in a group like this christians hatch out are born again in such an atmosphere as this this kind of atmosphere i was born under no matter where i go and visit the cold world and mission fields and so forth i can even stand and close my eyes and think of this atmosphere this reminds me when i was just a boy preacher and just starting out we had a little groups to meet from house to house we separated ourselves from the things of the world too that's what made my heart the way it is today in love with christ where we can dwell together listen brother ben put a lot of emphasis on atmosphere and you cannot you cannot create a seed gene of god in your children you can't do it if it's there it was there before the foundation of the world you can't fertilize the egg once the egg's already out but if there's a seed there if there's a fertile egg there if you keep it in the right atmosphere it'll hatch out atmosphere is so important he said doesn't matter how fertile the egg is in the wrong atmosphere brother brandon said i would have given my heart to the lord earlier but i run with the wrong crowd it kept me from it he was in the wrong atmosphere but when he got in the right atmosphere he was born again and we want to keep the right atmosphere here as we congregate together as a church as we fellowship amongst believers but more importantly we want to keep the right atmosphere in our homes we want to keep the right atmosphere around us i mean if we can keep an atmosphere around us and in our homes amen the atmosphere can bring about a birth amen it can't change what was written on the land's book of life amen as far as a predestinated seed but the right atmosphere can help bring that seed to life and that's something we can do for our children is keep the right atmosphere at home not compromise not confusion not hypocrisy amen not they hear something preached at church and they go home and see something completely different amen what are we doing we're ruining the atmosphere amen we're going to hinder the birth amen but for our children's sake we can live the life and apply the token and create an atmosphere and our children can lay in that atmosphere and if there's a seed there they can come to life in that atmosphere brother graham said in elijah in the meal offering he said talk about running around with the world and flirt with the world and then expect to see angels and have miracles done it's out of god's program you must live right clean up the house clean up your habits clean up the things of the world get rid of your cards and your worldly association get ready and then the angel of god can speak and say fear not it is i then things take place but the man says we expect supernatural we expect to see an angel and hear all that when there's compromise no he says now you know listen friends i'll tell you you can get rid of everything and clean everything up it doesn't guarantee that you're gonna have a supernatural visitation but one thing brother benham said is is if you don't clean up you won't have it i want to keep the atmosphere right where angels are welcome in my home all the time i don't want to grieve them away i don't want to create an atmosphere where the holy angels of god are not welcome where the holy spirit is not welcome in me in my life in the environment around me in my home but i want an environment where the angels of god the ministering spirits of god are welcome in my home that can minister to me but can minister to my children the token he says remember there was a lot of them came by them women that night said hey gertie lily some of you come on out we're going to the party tonight huh i'm under the blood i'm under the token to stay here my love is to my baker death is in the land tonight and death is in the land today judgment is waiting she's pending atomic and hydrogens and all kinds of disaster is waiting for the nations and god is moving his church and showing all we we've been keeping the lamb up now for quite a while this is brother ramsey we've been keeping the lamb up for quite a while watching seeing what he's doing watching his nature and everything but now the token has got to be applied when brother bam come and he preached the token and when he got the desperation he said we've talked about the token all along but now is the manifestation of the token the token has got to be applied it's no more holding the lamb and saying yes this is the word this is the word and the blood is in the word and the life is in the word amen that's holding up the lamb amen that's wonderful until you get to the time where the token has got to be displayed and you can't keep holding up the lamb that was proper for a season that was appropriate action for a season but there came a time in the passover where the appropriate action was to take the life that was in that lamb and the blood represented the life and put it on the outside of your house apply it the way the prophet said apply it amen and know that the death angel was going to pass and we've been holding up the lamb been keeping the lamb now for quite a while brother says watching seeing what he's doing watching his nature and everything but now the token has got to be applied it's got to be applied it's the only thing except a man be born of the spirit under the water he will no wise enter in and and should love one another listen listen to where brother branham goes he's talking about we got to apply the token but i want you just to hear what he says we should love one another believers should separate themselves from the world don't just take it now lightly now you people that's listening to this on tape you women you men you listen a minute if you ever believe me you believe me now it's time for to quit fussing with one another believe the message of the bible believe jesus christ and love and honor and respect one another he's talking about the applying of the token man respect your wives you respect your homes bring your home together because remember this lamb was for the home not just one for the whole home too had to be brought everything had to be brought in we should love one and each other and believers should separate themselves from the world notice they were not just yet come together to talk about the message they come together to apply the blood to apply the token that's what you must do pastor neville into this congregation trust these deacons to you brethren it's time that we laid aside all the foolishness of the world time we laid aside everything else we've seen enough now till we are positive sure and the token must be applied without it you're going to perish you must perish that's the only thing oh don't come together say i believe it get beneath it get into it we didn't come together to talk about the message but we came to get into the message and the message to get into us we're here to eat the flesh and drink the blood like i said i'm not here to admonish you you're wrong you need to start doing this i'm here to say this is what god has given us and there's a power that comes with this and that power will keep the death angel from us again in the token he says that's what they did in egypt that's what they did in jericho if you want to read another one acts 16 31 paul told the centurion believe i'm the messenger of the hour believe on the lord jesus christ thou in thy house shall be saved that right believe for your house bring them all under now you've seen the god of heaven perform miracles it's it's before judgment do you believe it yes what can i do he said rise and be baptized paul took him out and baptized him said now believe in the lord jesus christ and thou in thy house shall be saved believe what believe the lord jesus christ for your house apply the token to your house then what do you do when you apply it to your house listen this is some basic instructions who loves it when it's basic instructions in play i say give it to me playing brother what do you do when you apply it to your house move all the trash out get all the short skirts and the shorts and the cards and the cigarettes and the televisions and what more and kick them out the door when you go apply the token won't stand still for it yes sir take it all out all the dances and parties and rock and roll and old vulgar newspapers and the stuff that's of the world kick it out the door say we're cleaning out this place around here you can take that to your physical home or you can take it to this house too we're cleaning it all out we're getting rid of it what's he doing he's applying the token get ready he said we're cleaning out this place like jacob did he said told his wife and all of them said wash your clothes and everything put away them gods you know what joshua said before crossing over he said wash your clothes come not out your wives and say well then get ready for within three days we'll cross jordan amen he was getting ready was applying the token amen that's it get ready apply it believe it clean up let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you it'll take effect this is the main sentence i want to labor on as we finish he's saying kick it all out all the world all the entertainment all of this and we've done that there may be some here they're still struggling with something and there may be some who haven't totally committed their lives and if that's the case it's for you if you want the token apply the token listen to the messenger believe the prophet of god kick the worldly entertainment out kick the vulgarity kick everything out but those of you have done it you've already brought your home in order you've already obeyed the prophet you've already kicked out the worldliness and the entertainment and you've already cleaned it up you've already accepted the message of the hour you believe the full word of god and you've obeyed the full word and you brought yourself you brought your home you brought everything subject to this word you've been received the baptism of the holy ghost you've received the blood of the word it's in you he said apply it apply it take the life and put it on the outside live it demonstrate it live the life of jesus christ speak as he would speak love as he would love act as he would act apply it believe it clean up let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you you can try to bring him to the church you can try to point out brother this and sister that or grandma this and grandpa all that you can try to point them to brother bantam but brother branham said let them see it in you see the token applied in you and i surrendering our lives greater and greater and greater and as the word goes higher and higher amen then then we just keep emptying out and emptying out and emptying out and let your children let your family let your loved ones let them see it in you amen if brother branham says let them see it in you it means that you're still under amen free moral agency and even though amen you've committed your life to god you've been born again you still get to choose what you display but if we can just keep dying to self and dying the self and letting the life of jesus christ live we found the bleeding word we feasted on the bleeding word amen the life of the word has come in now we've got to let the life of the word come out we've got to take it and apply let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you that's right it'll take effect and this is the part that i wanna i wanna believe with all of my heart that if i've done if if i've received the word i've received the life amen and i've obeyed the word and i've obeyed the messenger i've obeyed god and i've gotten rid of these things and i've done all that i know to do and what he still shows me i still obey as i walk with him i want him that first place i want to apply it i want the word living in me i want the line up to that word amen and i believe i've done it to the best that i know when i failed i've repented and now i want to have confidence that it'll take effect amen that it'll work amen that i don't i don't have to force anything i don't i don't have to ram anything i just have to live the life and that life will take effect amen remember rahab was the harlot she was the harlot of rahab and harlot rehab of jericho how in the world did she convince all of her family and all of them to get into her how did she get them to believe i don't know what was different about her i don't know what she said or how she said it but there was something after her encounter with the message after the messengers have told her the truth after she had the token applied she went out and she talked to her family and whatever i don't know the situation in the family or how it was but you can only imagine if your daughter or your sister your cousin was a harlot but there was something about her amen she was able to bring them in and they got under the same token she got under listen friends it's not about you saying i've got the token you stand next to me you'll be fine no they had to get under the same token your children got to get under the same token you're under amen it's not just your token that i stretch out over top of them no they've got to come under my token they've got to receive the same token i've received how will they do it where's the attraction that's my question where's the attraction where's the attraction amen it was rahab who went to her family it was the woman at the well who went to the city of samaria they knew her reputation they knew that she had to go to the well at a certain time but she had an encounter with jesus christ and she left and she went down there and began to tell him tell come see a man who's told me something about her amen was enough of an attraction that they would come and see what she was talking about and they said now we believe we've we've met jesus we've heard you now we believe because we've heard with our own ears not just because she said but they come and they got what she got clean up let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you that's right it'll take effect then apply the token in prayer with consideration with believing apply it with such love and so for until you know it's going to take it's going to take place apply the token in prayer say lord this is your life in me i've received the life of your blood i've received your word and god it's your life in me i've received the baptism of holy ghost and now in love i want to apply this token in love amen i've been sealed by you i'm your son i'm your daughter and now in love i want to apply this token i want to ask lord that you would touch this one and touch that one and bring them in lord apply it with believing apply it with such love and so forth till you know it's going to take it's going to take place that's all applying confidence believing it's going to help when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband talk to your wife talk to this loved one believe that it's going to help just stand there and say lord i've claimed them they're mine i'm getting them for you lord apply it and create that atmosphere around you that they'll just drop right into it see oh you are if you got the token you create a spirit around you a power that when you walk people know that you're a christian they love for you to say something to them they believe your word what you say they hold on to it that's it apply the token then walk with it claim your house so you must do it now this is the evening time now you've been listening a long time now this is the evening time it's applying time now the wrath will strike one of these days it might be too late then see apply the token with confidence i say it this way if you believe you've got the token have confidence in the token if you know you've got the token and you've cleaned up and you've cleaned out you've surrendered your life and you know that it's not you but it's christ you've been born again it's a different life it's not the life you lived but but something's changed amen you had a soul change and you know there's another life amen then have confidence in that life have confidence in that token because it creates an atmosphere it creates an atmosphere that will drop into it and have faith in that have confidence into it when you pray pray with confidence don't we we don't want to pray amen and pray as if we don't have a god and pray if we don't have a father amen but we want to pray with confidence because we know who we are and we know who he is and we know why we're asking for what we're asking for and then go forth with confidence amen that it will take a fact that when i come in contact with somebody there's another life here and they'll sense that there's another life here and that'll take an effect and just pray lord flow through me lord flow through me i mean take an effect and move in their life make them hungry lord bring them to you and you just keep going out there and shining and being a lie and then live the life of christ and believe that it'll take an effect believe that your encounters have a power don't ever believe why i talked to them and that was a waste of time you realize we can't believe that we have to know who we are and we have to believe that it'll take effect it's not me it's him god go after them god get them god use me god use somebody else but i've got confidence lord that you're living in me if we can just come in contact then i believe that you'll be working on the other end though it takes 20 years 30 years 40 years i don't care how long it takes but i believe lord that it'll take effect that you'll find brother branham said rahab went out there hunting out all the predestinated seed that would kill him and get under the same token i say lord help us to seek out the predestinated seed help us to have confidence lord that that that confidence that that life will have an effect we applied the token now let's have confidence in the token have you applied the token the best you know how you've applied the token then have confidence that the token will take effect be confident be sure be sure that the death angel will pass brother brahm says in the token that's what egypt had to do remember they tested the lamb for 14 days get all the filth out of your house put every all the leaven out you can't have no leaven when this mark is coming to your house this token you cannot have a leaven in it that's the world you can't love god and mammon the world at the same time all the cares of the world all the cares and your creeds and your fusses and your difference you are coming to jesus christ see if we have confidence in the token we have confidence in the life then we won't allow ourselves to mar that token by living hypocrisy before others by by you know if we have confidence in the token we need to live to the token and let the token be on display and nothing else we've got to be careful that in our homes we don't we have confidence that the token will work the life will work and i've got so much confidence in it that i'll preserve that life and i'll keep surrendering myself to that life i'll keep dying daily as paul said i die daily i'll keep dying paul said i keep under my body and bring it to subjection unless when i preach to others i might be a cast away i'm going to keep this thing subdued so the life of christ can come because i've got confidence in that token i've got confidence that it'll take an effect it'll create an atmosphere it'll create an atmosphere that others will come in contact with and if there's a predestinated seed there it'll have an effect and then god will do whatever god will do what's the motivation to clean out what's the motivation to surrender what's the motivation to obey you know for many times we have a motivation i want to be right i just want to go to heaven i want to be right but now the way brother branham brings it home here it's not just for me but it's for others amen when rahab got that true token amen as soon as she got that token she said i want a token amen so my family can be saved for my my mother for my father for my sisters i want them to be safe too amen her display of a toca was not only so she could say i'm safe but she knew how to get other people saved they had to get under the same token now i want to live this life i want a token for my home i want an atmosphere in this home i want an atmosphere in my physical home for my children and for my wife but i want an atmosphere in this home too amen so that there could be an effect of the life and i want to keep in obedience and keep under this body so that it doesn't mar the effect of that life why because it's not just for me it's for others it'll create an atmosphere it'll take an effect and i want to live that life i want to live that token life i know where the bleeding word is i've fed on the bleeding word i've received the life of that word and i want that life now to live out of me and i don't want anything to hinder it because it's not just so i can say i'm safe i'm okay the death angel will pass but i want my household saved i want my family safe i want my associates saved i want anybody who can believe to be saved and i want to walk in this life with confidence that greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world and believe that god will touch will reach out will have an effect through my life people are looking for something real people are looking for a real christianity a real christ something genuine in this day last wednesday when i looked and i saw those young people raising their hands no prompting no prodding no workup no fear of hell no condemnation nothing just a real genuine worship from the heart i say that's the christianity i want i want it real and i want it from the heart and you think that doesn't take an effect that takes an effect friends you think our families and our lives and it doesn't have an effect on the associates with it has an effect do you think when you go back and visit family and you're the only believing family you think it doesn't have an effect it has an effect you think when you go to work and you don't run the same shenanigans everybody else does and you're honest and you do what you ought to do you think it doesn't take an effect it takes an effect how did you come in what life did you see what influenced you i would say there was somebody around you that had the token on display i would imagine there was somebody in your life whether the parent or relative a co-worker a friend whatever it was there was somebody around you that had the token on display that's how you got to where you're sitting now did the token take effect on you yes it did will the token in your life take effect on somebody else yes it will i want to have confidence in that token because the token's for the home let's go to galatians chapter 2 we'll read this scripture and then we'll be done galatians chapter 2. galatians 2 and verse 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me this life of christ is to be lived in the flesh and i say lord live it in this flesh here we found the bleeding word are you confident of that have you found the bleeding word have you feasted on the word have you ate his flesh and drank his blood if you evade his flesh and drank his blood then his life is in you if you've been crucified with christ you live but not you it is christ that liveth in you and that life is a token on display it's got to be applied it's got to be on the display but if it is it'll take effect amen let's all stand musicians if you'd come i want the word to take effect in my life we don't like put the light under a bushel basket but we put it on a hill for all to see and that's the life of christ on display we live it i see it in you i see it in your families i see it in your lives but don't doubt the effect of that token being on display it'll save if you can if somebody can come under the token under the same token with the same faith and come under the token they'll be saved too we're out there we we may you know we may be running around and saying come maybe all of rahab's family didn't come maybe they did maybe they didn't i don't know i don't know how many came how many friends how many associates but you know what some came we don't we can't control everything but one thing i can believe is that the token will have an effect that the life of christ will have an effect on the seed of christ and i don't want to doubt that i don't want to forsake that i don't want to hinder that in any way let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father for this word we thank you lord and we ask god that you would just make it real in our lives god you had put somebody to cross our path there was somebody in our lives lord and there was something about their life that affected us whether it was a parent or a family member or friend some associate somehow each one of us has been affected by a life that was lit for you a token on display and god it had an effect on us and it brought us under and we've got the same token that they had and god now i pray lord that you would use us and use our lives wherever we go and wherever we do lord let it be your light that's shining through us and may it take an effect may it take an effect on our co-workers may it take an effect on our associates may it take effect in our families god let us have confidence in that little confidence in your life in your name for we've come to the fountain where the life is still flowing i pray god that you'd help us to feed on that life but that also our lives would make it available to others have your way with us lord keep us by your grace keep us in your word help us lord to stay surrendered and humble and submissive use us lord and may you get all the glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen flow through me [Music] holy spirit [Music] me as i lift my hands to worship [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is that your prayer amen nor just flow i know many because we know situations many have children that have left the message left the truth left and there is a prodigal out there amen just don't lose faith don't lose faith that when they were with you and they were in your home they heard the truth they saw the truth they saw a life don't lose faith in that believe it what could the prodigal's father do what could he do he let his son go there was nothing he can do but what did he do in the meantime between when his son left and his son came back no doubt he continued to pray for him but he stayed consistent amen he stayed where he was he stayed in obedience he's lived the same life that he lived when his son was at home and if you've got somebody that's there that's gone amen don't let the devil lie to you and bring doubts into your heart you believe that what they saw was genuine when they were in your home that what they heard was truth that they had heard the truth and they had saw a genuine life perfect life no but a genuine life yes and then in the absence stay consistent stay put because they'll know where to come back and find something real stay connected to christ live the life stay in the token keep displaying the token amen and who knows what god will use and what circumstances he'll use to turn that situation around but when he does they'll know exactly where to find the reality because they saw the reality before people around you maybe they know you for years maybe they associate with you for 10 15 years and you thought there's nothing going on there but god knows how to turn the circumstances to where when they need something real they know where they saw something real don't grow weary in well-doing for in due season you shall reap a harvest if you faint none live that life let it flow apply it the very commandments of the message put it on live it display this word in full display believing it'll take an effect amen we don't know what's going on we don't even know what's going on in people's hearts i remember you know i remember when i was being witness to and somebody's witnessing the message to me i was just holding into my heart and everything they said was having an effect i was having war in my mind and i was keeping them at arm's length amen because i didn't want to show my hand too early but everything was taking an effect and over time i couldn't resist it anymore i knew where truth was i knew where reality is i know i knew where the real christianity was keep displaying the token keep seeking after this lost but don't be don't worry god knows how to turn the circumstances stay consistent stay true when that person comes back to find that truth make it sure that it's still the real living word distill real living christianity that they can come back to that's what i want to do brother branham said christianity is living for others i want to live for christ in a way that i'm living for others so somebody else has the opportunity may god bless you do you know that song there's a fountain open in the house of david do we have the bleeding word do you believe that we have the bleeding word do you believe it's bleeding still that the blood is still coming from the word do you believe that the blood that has the life that can be applied as a token amen and that means what we have is powerful friends it's not it's not something and not a little kitty toy god has given us the bleeding word we're caring as priests and kings we're carrying the word amen we're carrying the bleeding word the sacrificed lamb we've got it and the blood is still flowing and that blood can still be applied if somebody will come take that life believe it and apply it they can be saved in the hour of destruction don't doubt what you hold in your hands don't doubt what you have in your heart don't doubt the life that's living believe it and believe it'll take an effect and believe it is the message in this hour let's just sing this song as we go amen for i will take you from the nations and bring you to your own land and i'll be sanctified in you
