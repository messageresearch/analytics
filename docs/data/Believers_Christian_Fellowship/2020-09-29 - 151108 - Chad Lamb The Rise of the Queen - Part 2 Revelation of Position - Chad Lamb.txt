========================================
[Music] peace [Music] sweet [Music] peace wonderful peace [Music] forever amen how many have his peace amen when things get hectic we know where to turn to don't we amen let's just take our bibles and turn to saint john chapter 16. this morning i'd like to finish what we started two weeks ago we talked about esther and the message we titled the rise of the queen amen and this is going to be the rise of the queen part 2 revelation of position amen so we find ourselves in the book of esther how many found themselves in the book of esther last time and then we're going to find ourselves in the book of esther again while you're turning there i just want to remind everybody that this coming saturday and sunday we have special meetings with brother abraham myra from uganda and the brothers and i got to meet brother abraham when he was down at the men's meeting and we had a really good time he got to speak there briefly and he's got a neat ministry he has an office he holds the office of a prophet he has a prophetic ministry in his life and it's been confirmed amen and so we're excited to have him here to minister for us he'll be ministering saturday night sunday morning and we're going to invite him back in the afternoon for whoever can make it and let him share his testimony so that one can go a little lengthy be one let everybody know he's got a testimony that is out of this world it is the book of acts in our day amen so we want to make that available to you all so just remember that there's been announcements for it also remind everybody that there is communion today so i'll be announcing that at the end of service let's look in saint john chapter 16. starting at verse 19. now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do ye inquire among yourselves of that i said a little while and you shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lay men but the world shall rejoice and you shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy a woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembers no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world and you know therefore having sorrow and you now therefore having sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you so here we see that when jesus is telling them that he must go from them and now they're sorrowful but he says you shall sorrow and the world shall rejoice why when christ is put down the world rejoices because they're under the power of the prince of the power of the air and but he says but your sorrow shall be turned into joy for i go away i'll be gone a little while you'll see me know more but in a little while you'll see me again amen and he repeated the same thing in our day through the church ages he was put down and put down and put down but there's been a restoration back amen and he's come again and our sorrow has been turned into joy why because christ the king is here that's why our sorrows been turned into joy so this very much applies to us today let's keep reading we read verse 23 and in that day and in what day the day when your sorrow is turned into joy that's today for us that's this day because he was gone in a little while we saw him no more but we have seen him again the king has come and that day he shall ask sorry in verse 23 yeah and that day this day you ask shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whosoever whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it you hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs but the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs amen we're in that day no more proverbs is the full unveiling of the word no more hidden manna but the bread of life has come down from god out of heaven and we have beheld him amen but i shall show you plainly of the father at that day what day the day when he's not speaking proverbs anymore in the day when he's returned in the day when we see him and in the day when he speaks plainly of the father that's this day at that day you shall ask in my name and i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you because you have loved me and have believed that i come out from god i come forth from the father and them come unto the world again i leave the world and go unto the father amen let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you so much for the reading of this word lord we ask that it would be more than just reading of the word but lord that you would be the divine interpreter of your word this morning lord we're looking to you to come and just to move on the scene lord and move me out of the way and i pray that you would take over these lips lord i yield myself unto you and i pray that your holy spirit would speak this morning to your people that we all can receive what we have need of this morning from you we glorify your name we yield ourselves to your word in jesus name we pray amen you can all be seated i just wanted to say friday night we had a youth meeting out of our house and a bonfire and i'd asked several of the a few of the youth to give a testimony of just what the lord had been doing recently in their lives and a few other picked up the inspiration and they gave some testimonies and i just want to say we have a wonderful youth group here in this church we are very blessed we have some young people who are committed to the lord and god is working mightily in their lives and i just sat there and i was so proud to be associated with these young people these young adults and these teens because they've got a hold of something that most of the world doesn't know anything about they're not ashamed of it they're not ashamed to talk about it they're not ashamed to talk about the word they're not shamed to say we don't believe in denomination they're not ashamed to use the name mention the name william branham in conversations they're not ashamed of the gospel and because of that the gospel is working mightily in their lives and they're overcoming and so i just want to say i'm very proud of them and you as parents should be very proud of them too god has done a work in our young people amen get back here to our subject the rise of the queen we're going to go to esther but i wanted to start hearing john because there was a promise that jesus was giving to his disciples and he says you won't see me a little while you'll see me then you'll see me again your joy will be full and then i'm not going to speak to you in proverbs anymore but there's coming a day when i'm going to speak plainly to you and i and i say we're in that day this is that day and he says in that day amen you just ask directly to the father in my name and he'll give it to you and i'm not telling you that i'll pray to the father amen but you ask yourself and he'll give to you because he loveth you amen why because the bride and the groom have become one amen i just want to remind you before we get into esther of this quote that we've been talking about quite a bit lately and christ is the mystery of god revealed he's talking about the seventh seal in this and i just want to bring it to your attention again he said god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and the seven thunders uttered their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord the seventh seal is the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't know he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible what is he showed or revealed the seventh seal his coming he showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible not that we understand it in every type that's in the bible but we know it's there and by believing it's there he's revealing it more and more and more amen as the negative moves into the positive we're beginning to see what's been laying there for thousands of years is the picture of redemption that is the mystery of god the mystery of god is the mystery of redemption how he's going to reverse everything that went wrong in the garden and restored all back for his elect seed that is the mystery of redemption that's the mystery of god the mystery there's one mystery that's been revealed by the sounding of the seventh angel and that mystery has many mysteries laying under it but it's one mystery and it's the mystery of redemption how is he going to redeem his seed back to where they've fallen from and the seventh seal is the wrapping up the coming of the lord the finalizing of all that and he showed it or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible what's that redemption that's the one purpose that's his one goal in the entire theme of the piper he had one desire and that's to restore fallen man back to the position he fell from oh it's so simple praise god and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type in expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and he shows it what what his great goal is redemption amen the bible is not broken down into a history with the jews and you know what he did in moses time and not broken down into individual stories it's one story it's not a story for the jews and then a separate one for the gentiles it's one story it's the story of redemption let's go back to esther we'll just do a really quick review and then move on in esther we find out that there is a queen her name's vashti which means beautiful and that queen uh was was bidden to come to a feast amen and this is a feast that's in the third year of the king and and if you look at the numbers we're going to see the numbers three the numbers 7 the number's 10 and the number's 12 all the way through this this book it's amazing brother branham says if you miss the numerology of the bible you're going to miss the bible you're going to miss the meaning you have to go back and get it again so we can't miss what god is trying to show us because there's a reason it wasn't in the in this in the sixth reign the reason it wasn't in the first year of his reign there's a reason it was in the third year of his reign there's a reason why he had a feast for 180 days which is six months and after that and the seventh month is when there's going to be a change in the order of the queen there's a reason all these numbers are laid out there amen and then he had seven chamberlains which were seven eunuchs which were the seven servants that served before the lord which represent the seven spirits of god amen which represents the seven church age messengers and so he wanted vashti to come in the seventh month and in the seventh month he wanted her to present herself before all the nobles and so he didn't go himself he sent the seven chamberlains and the seven chamberlains went and delivered the message of the king to the queen and the queen refused the king by the chamberlains same thing that's happened in our day the church has refused the voice of all seven sounding in one day they refused the seven church age messengers amen and because of that the king put her away amen and then he decided he's going to get another one who is better than she all right we found out he's not looking so much for somebody more beautiful he's not looking for beauty he had beauty but beauty refused him the the thing that he's looking for is not just beauty he's looking for character someone that won't refuse him and how will they not refuse him amen they refused him by not listening to the chamberlains by not listening to the his voice as it came through the voice of the chamberlains now he's looking for somebody who's not going to refuse and so we find out that esther a girl in obscurity not known to anybody else through a process of time she goes through purification and the house of the women which was which was oversaw by another chamberlain haggai which is represents brother branham and our day the seventh messenger who is giving a message of purification amen a message of get out of this and stop that and don't do that and dress this way and talk this way and act this way amen what is it he's preparing esther to meet the king preparing esther to meet the king and they want to call it legalism it's not legalism it's the most liberating thing on this earth because we don't want to be rejected by the king and we can only come according to his word and so now we've had a chamber out here who's saying don't wear that don't go there don't talk that way don't believe those things it's not legalism he's not trying to make a church more beautiful he's trying to prepare her for her encounter with the king because he's getting a bride ready to meet the king so they're going to be an invisible union of the bride and the bridegroom he's trying to get her in position so that the king will find favor she'll find favor in the eyes of the king why she's come according to his will according to his desires according to his likings so we find out it was time that the virgins could go before the king and they all had an opportunity to go before the king and they all could take anything that they desired out of the house of women into their encounter with the king anything so who knows what they took who knows what their desire was but god never took away free moral agency and he still today has not taken away form free moral agency he'll tell you plainly without proverbs what's the right way this is the way walk you in it but you've got the choice amen if you want to dress him honestly it's your choice if you want to disbelieve part of his word it's your choice if you want to correct the prophet that's your choice you have a choice but there was only one virgin remember only one virgin that was accepted when she went into the king and made queen only one and that was the one esther which says of her when she went she required nothing but what haggai had had appointed unto her she took none of her own ideas none of her own thinking none of her own concepts none of her own wishes she laid it all down and she subjected herself and only took what haggai had required and there's going to be a bride in this day that's only taking what haggai said not what she thinks about it but what haggy i said amen a lot of people don't like that but if you want to be accepted of the king you're going to love that because remember haggai was the one who'd been in the inner chamber of the king's court haggai knew what the king was like haggai had gotten commandment from the king himself esther had never met the king none of these virgins had ever met the king but look at the pride of them that decided that they knew better than haggai what they could take what the king would like well i could take the hill like this oh surely he'll accept me surely this is okay in his sight they had never met him before and they don't know what his court's like and they don't know anything about him and they're rejecting the one voice that's been there done that and knows all about it [Applause] what pride and arrogancy in the church systems of the world today they're doing the exact same thing thinking that they found a good way to present themselves to the king and they don't even know who he is but haggie i had been there so haggai had required certain things and that's the only thing that esther took in and she accepted oh you betcha she was accepted and she was made queen so we pick up the story right there that's our ketchup we're caught up are we caught up amen do we find ourselves in esther absolutely this is my story amen so when we talk about esther last time we talked about choosing a bride but this time i want to talk about the revelation of position because esther has there's still things that are changing in her right she's the queen now but she needs to start acting like the queen she's been she's been called and she's been chosen she was called with all the fair young virgins she was chosen by the king when her time came to meet the king but now she's got to step into that position she's been called to and that she's been chosen for we're going to take a look at that let's start in esther chapter 2. verse 21 i don't know if we'll finish this today if not we'll just move on amen but we're going to we're going to monitor the time here and see how far we go esther chapter 2 verse 21 in those days this is right after that esther is chosen as queen in those days while mordecai sat in the king's gate two of the king's chamberlain's big thin and teresh of those which kept the door were wroth and sought to lay hand on the king ahazeras and the thing was known to mordecai who told it unto esther the queen and esther certified the king thereof in mordecai's name and when inquisition was made of the matter it was found out therefore they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king now we find out here this is the first time that esther is going to send word to the king now that she's queen but look at the manner in which she does it she certifies to the king or sends a message to the king in mordecai's name all right now she didn't go herself she didn't make a special appointment she just sent words she she communicated to the king in mordecai's name and the thing was found out we're going to find out we're going to watch esther progress in her relationship with the king we're going to watch esther progress in her positional placement with the king because this is the first time and the first time she just sins word she just certifies to the king in mordecai's name amen and the thing the thing works out but we want to move from there a little bit it says after these things after the queen was selected after all of this after these things did the king ahazers promote haman the son of hemadetha the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him now this is the same time amen the same time that the queen comes into power is the same time that haman comes into power and haman is called an esther the enemy of the jews and haman is a type of satan all right and this is satan's eden and satan is coming to full power today amen so we always have two opposing forces on the earth amen where the the the powers of god and the powers of satan and they're always there's only two opposing forces there's not three there's not four there's not ten there's only ever two we ourselves we're falling subject to one or the other all the time as we make decisions and there's no neutral decisions we believe that there's no neutral decisions there's no gray area that we can operate in we are either being influenced by evil or we are either being influenced by righteousness so here at the time esther comes to power haman comes to full power and authority this is amazing i want you to watch mordecai also because mordecai is an interesting figure in esther mordecai we found out last time is a benjamite amen the benjaminite is the little tribe brother benham talks about and he types benjamin little benjamin with 144 000. so mordecai represents the 144 thousand that are going to be saved amen that are going to be part of that elect that's called out through the two prophets in revelations 11. so but mordecai also in typology and esther represents christ in many ways so we're going to find that here it's amazing you know no type in the bible is exactly perfect right because god's doing several things he's telling what happened in history he's showing what happened in the future he's showing what's going to happen to the jews he's going to show what happens to the bride so god's always accomplishing so much in every story in the bible amen so we want to watch we want to watch mordecai he's an interesting figure so haman rises to power and haman's got a problem mordecai won't bow to him now you've got to think on first reading this and i've heard commentators from denominations say you know mordecai he's a good jew he just won't worship anybody he won't bow to anybody that cannot be true because if mordecai would not have bowed to a hazaris mordecai would be dead so it's not what denominations are thinking it's not that mordecai refused to bow down anybody he's a servant of the king a keeper of the gate he has to bow to azaris we understand that so this denominational thinking is absolute foolishness it's not that mordecai won't bow to anything else it's mordecai won't bow to haman he won't bow down to haman why because haman is an agagite comes from king ag which was the last of the amalekites the amalekites were the largest tribe of the canaanites so the malachites represent the canaanites which were which ruled canaan land which they were supposed to dispossess the land of and drive them out and they became their eternal enemies so here is why he calls him the the haman the enemy of the jews because he was an amalekite from king ag and agagite and this is the last time that we're going to see an amalekite in scripture hallelujah haman's about to meet destruction him and all his sons in his whole household and we're going to find out the destruction of the amalekites which is the destruction of satan is going to take place right here when the queen comes to power in esther so there's a reason that mordecai will not bow to haman because haman is the enemy of the jews haman is an agagite which is an amalekite amen i love the way god puts things in the scriptures verse eight let's skip down to verse eight and haman said unto king ahazerus there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from all the people neither keep they the king's laws therefore it is not for the king's prophet to suffer them if it please the king let it be written that they may be destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it unto the king's treasures and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it to haman the son of hamadatha the agagite the jews enemy here he's got a problem with mordecai amen but to get mordecai he recognizes that the reason mordecai won't bow is because he's a jew and so now haman decides to wipe out all the jews the the people of god the chosen and elect of god he's going to wipe them out because mordecai will not bow and this reminds me of an interesting story i think in the book of luke let's go to luke chapter 4. keep your place in esther we're coming right back but let's look at luke chapter 4. luke chapter 4 jesus is in the wilderness being tempted of the devil we get to verse 5 and it says in the devil taking him up into a high mountain showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee this is political power power over the nations he said all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me who's the ruler of all the kingdoms the devil scripture tells us right here he's offering it to jesus this power all this power of all these kingdoms will i give unto thee amen and in the way he words it he says uh i will give to thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me so devil the devil has the power of all the nations and the glory of all the nations have been delivered unto him what did the king give to haman his ring amen amen delivered to me for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it is the devil lying no he's not lying amen he's the prince of the power of the air amen he is the ruler of satan's eden he sets as a king over this world amen and this is a type of haman and he says i've got the power and he's offering it to jesus but jesus only has to do one thing if thou therefore will worship me all shall be thine and jesus answered and said to him get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve haman was given a ring and haman want to destroy the jews because mordecai would not bow to him amen i love the typology now when he goes and make this decree to the king it's interesting what year in the reign of atazeras he decides to do this and at verse seven it says in the first month that is the month nisan in the twelfth year of king and hazaris they cast per in the lot before haman from day to day and from the month to month to the 12th month that is the month adar so in the 12th year he spent the whole year casting this lot before he goes into the king and he goes in amen he decides to do this he's not given the authority to do it until the 13th month but in the 13th or the first 13th day of the first month in the next year but it all takes place and transpires in 12 12 12 12. it's the number of the jews the number of the jews are going to be redeemed as 12 12 tribes amen so let's move on to verse or chapter four so it in the meantime just keep our story straight haman decides that he's going to he's going to cast this plan and he's going to overthrow all the god's people the elect of god and so he goes to the king and and the king gives him the power and the authority to do what he wants to do the devil shows to jesus that he's got the power and the authority over the kingdoms and the power and his glory is his has been delivered unto him right so we're keeping our type straight so then then mordecai then he writes a decree that that the people are allowed to destroy the jews and they're allowed to plunder their stuff and they're allowed to take all their things and he says on a certain day in a certain time then we can all attack the jews and have all their stuff so the plan is sealed by the king's king's ring and so nothing can change that amen it's amazing how we have received a law there's been a law and that law is cut that law is predicting our destruction there's been a law of the lord and it was written by moses and moses took the law of the lord and in that writing of the law he said the soul that sinneth that soul shall die amen and there was a substitute offered for sin for the covering but we're still we're sold under sin paul is telling us in romans 7 that which i would do i do not and that's what i don't know that's the thing i do and he says i find out that i'm a slave to sin amen in the law the decree the law of the land that was sealed amen it was our destruction hallelujah so we find ourselves in the same place so mordecai he's he's fasting he's in sackcloth and ashes and and they come and they tell esther about it and esther sends inquiry to find out why mordecai is so distraught and he sends a copy of the law that's going to destroy all the people of god and she reads that and she says what shall i do and he says you go unto the king we're going to pick up the story there remember last time mordecai talked to esther she certified to the king in mordecai's name now mordecai saying you go to the king she's progressing in her positional placement she's progressing or she needs to progress 411 this is her response all the king's servants and the people of the king's prophet says do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king and to the inner court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter and that he may live but i have not been called to come unto the king these thirty days i want to talk about the golden scepter for just a minute this is interesting the golden scepter the king and many times the kings their power authority to rule was represented in the scepter they held in their hand when they were on the judgment seat amen and here they have a law that nobody who approaches on the king will be accepted and the king unless he extends this scepter and this scepter is symbolic of his entire kingdom with his power and authority to rule so the scepter has a lot of symbology attached to that and unless they extended the scepter which was the power of the kingdom and you came up and touched that scepter received it it's extended and it's received then you're going to be killed all right so and it's a golden scepter it's not a silver it's not a wooden it's a golden scepter which is a type of deity amen so so she says i've not been called unto the king these 30 days i know that whosoever goes they're going to die except one thing except the king extend the golden scepter unto them other than that they're going to die so esther's afraid to approach unto the king not according to his bidding but according to her will she's afraid to go right to the throne of god esther knows that she's been called esther knows that she's been chosen but one thing esther doesn't know for sure she doesn't know what's in the back part of the king's mind she doesn't know what the king is thinking about her she doesn't know how much the king loves her she doesn't know if she'll be accepted or she doesn't know she'll be rejected so though she's called though she's chosen those she can send by certification certified to the king though the king can bid her to come at certain times she doesn't know for sure what's in the back part of his mind she doesn't know for sure how the king feels about her amen she's about to get a revelation verse 16. she tells esther finally decides she's going to go in so she says go gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish she knew she knew you're not supposed to go in there outside the appointed time but she didn't realize atonement was already complete the high priest has already been atoning for blood and now she can go boldly into the throne of grace she's still stuck in the old legal thinking only the high priest only once a year not outside the appointed time and not without blood can go in but she's failed to realize there's already been a high priest laying back there for seven church ages laying the blood stripes of atonement down and now she can boldly anytime she wants approaching to the throne of grace she's got to catch a greater revelation amen so she says fast for me three days esther five verse one now it came to pass on the third day oh do we love the numerology of god do we love his numbers on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel what did we learn last time brother branham said let this be the crowning of my ministry that i am clothing a bride amen in the word amen watch the royal apparel the royal apparel is the word of god and this bride has been clothed amen in the word of god and so now esther knows that when she's going to approach unto the king she can't just come any away she's got to wear the royal garment she's got to wear she's been trained in the house of haggai she knows what the right kind of dress is and that's to be dressed in his word so when she approaches him she approaches him covered in the word amen in the third day jesus says destroy this temple and in three days i'll raise it up again and he spoke of the temple of his body but we know that wasn't his last body he's got another body what is his body the body is the church amen the body is the bride and that body was destroyed by babylon in the dark ages but through three ages he's been restoring back and in the third age he's restored back now he's brought the the bride into the presence of the king and the third day so it came to pass on the third day that esther put on a royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight how could she not she's clothed in his word she's got the royal apparel on amen she's come at the right time she's coming the third day hallelujah in favor in a sight and the king held out to esther the golden scepter that was in his hand so esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter then said the king unto her what will thou queen esther and what is thy request i it shall be given thee to half of the kingdom is there any doubt nestor's mind what the king thinks of her now she may have been nervous about going to the inner chamber she may have been nervous about going of her own bidding of her own desire according to her own will before the king she may not have known for sure what was in the back part of his mind but as soon as she entered into his presence and he extended the golden scepter and she received mercy because he extended unto her mercy and she received mercy just as soon as she had then he makes a declaration not she but he what's your petition what shall be done for you it shall be done for you up to half my kingdom oh all fear melted away right then then she knows he loves me he loves me he really loves me he didn't say what is it you want just a short session just hurry and tell me what you want no he said i delight in you you found favor in my eyes i'm not just giving you mercy i'm glad you came i'm so glad you came i'm so happy about you approaching unto me not waiting for me to bid but you so desired it that you would come of your own and that you would put on the royal apparel i'm not just giving you mercy i'm giving you half the kingdom anything you ask for up to half the kingdom that's how happy i am that you came to me today oh esther's not afraid anymore if that was you if that was you where would fear go it would just twitter away and dissipate man i want to look at the scepter for just a minute let's look at the hebrews chapter 1. hebrews chapter 1 verse 8 he's speaking of christ he says but unto the son he has said thy throne o god now catch the wording here who's he speaking to unto the son he saith the son is jesus christ unto the son he saith thy throne o god. how many gods do you see there how many gods is that did he just call the son god he just called the son god amen unto the son he saith thy throne o god amen is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom what is the scepter of the sun what's his scepter a scepter of righteousness how do you get righteousness esther needed the scepter to be extended unto her the golden scepter amen the symbol of authority the symbol of the kingdom she needed to be extended her and she had to come up and accept it the symbol the scepter of christ the scepter of the kingdom of god is righteousness a skeptic of righteousness how do we get righteousness the same way abraham got it how did abraham get righteousness abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness oh she needed mercy esther needed somebody to extend amen somebody to extend mercy in the scepter of the kingdom the power of the kingdom the the symbol of the power of the kingdom need to be access extended unto her and she had to accept it and now we know that christ has a scepter of righteousness but how do i get righteousness the only way i can get righteousness is if he extends his word to me that's the only way abraham got it and we're the royal seat of abraham we've got to get it the same way abraham got it by faith by faith and want by faith in god's word he believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness because god gave him his word and abraham come up and received it and it was accounted unto him for righteousness and now in our day he's given us his word a golden scepter amen he said heaven it consists of his word god is the word christ is the word the bride is the word the kingdom is the word he's extended unto us a golden scepter mercy has been extended to the bride but she's got to go up and take it she's got to go up and take it i was studying on the scepter yesterday and it was amazing to me they don't know what the scepter looked like in this day but shortly after that when we move into the roman kingdom it said the roman scepters were always topped with an eagle on top oh i wish we had a picture of the scepter because could you just imagine esther walking up to a golden scepter with an eagle on top and where does she find mercy she touches the top of the scepter through the eagle anointing through the eagle anointing which is the fourth anointing to come to the church which is the anointing that shows the positional placing of the church which is the one that's the extension of the royal scepter in our day men you can't go anywhere else and find this you can't go anywhere else and find this kind of mercy extended from the king but the king has a very specific way that he's going to extend the mercy in our day and it's through the eagle anointing and the only way that you'll find mercy in his cords is if you come his way clothed in his clothes and then if he gives his word a revelation of his word to you then you've got to come and accept it outside of that is death amen he has extended his word and we have accepted it how many has touched the royal scepter how many has touched the royal scepter if you've touched the royal scepter you found mercy you're clothed in righteousness and he has said not thank you for coming now move along he said what is it that you want my dear up to half my kingdom i don't know about you but the word says i'm a joint heir with christ joint heir brother bam says 50 50. up to half the kingdom up to half the kingdom is mine why because he loves me hallelujah now esther knows brother branham said in revelation of jesus christ in the church age book now remember this this is when the angel tells him to pick up your pen and write and i refer to this all the time but i want to read it again christ at the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it so first we want to see that christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts amen but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless now he didn't say that the antichrist spirit would come against the church making it lukewarm and powerless and defiling he said it would come into the church it's not the outside forces we have to watch and worry about that's not the problem it's never been the problem in the church never the outside forces it's always the inside forces because the antichrist spirit is trying to move inside to the church it exposes satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the desecration of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is it's amazing brother bam says many times and he always says what not who what because she's made out of something she is part of something what is she the body of christ that's what she is what is she the word on earth the word made manifest what is she she is part of the godhead that's what she is when the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what is she part of the godhead he says brother i said you can no more be lost than god can be lost because god can't lose himself and god has had seed that he's sown into the earth and he's portioned himself out over time and that is him what is she part of the godhead amen are we afraid of being lost ain't no way in the world i'm afraid of being lost i can't be lost afraid of disbelieving this word there ain't no way i can disbelieve this word because i can't disbelieve it any more than jesus christ could disbelieve it because i'm made out of the same substance he was part of the godhead amen praise the lord what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she's got to catch a revelation of what she is first and then she'll catch the revelation that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army when when she realizes what she is when she recognizes the true revelation of the true church and what she is when she and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works when she catches all those revelations then she will be an invincible army why wouldn't she be an invincible army if she actually catches the revelation that she's part of the godhead what in the world you have to be afraid of if god before me who shall be against me what shall i say unto these things amen famine and peril and sword and nakedness and all these things what shall we say to these things if god before me who can be against me why is he for me because i have a special smile he likes why is he for me because i'm a part of him because down inside of me is an attribute a chip off the old block that's never going to be lost he knows his own he calls his own they are in the hand of christ and no man pluckett them out of his hand not because of a pretty smile not because i have a wide part in my hair which is beautiful but because of who because of what she is amen she will be an invincible army she can be nothing else god is invincible the children of god have to be invincible if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today is when christ was stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert just want to remind you you know this how was satan defeated in the desert by the word it is written jesus jesus had the power to smote him into obliteration jesus had the power to throw him into the lake of fire right then jesus had the power to call for legions of angels amen he had the authority to do so but he would not because he was restrained by his own word and he was laying down a pattern that every believer every single believer can follow this pattern and this pattern is it is written the word says it is written who can say that you can you say it is written can you just quote the word you don't have to be strong you don't be good-looking you don't have to have anything figured out you can be as confused as confused can be about what's happening in your life you can be weak laying on your bed that tired and weak from cancer but you can still speak the word and it's the word it's the spoken word of god that's going to bring deliverance to the children of god amen it's got to be believed when it's spoken it's got to be believed he will be definitely thwarted today as with christ which stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it who loves it we love it hallelujah with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them we could probably read this quote every sunday because this is our victory right here this is what overcomes the devil this is what amen this is what totally thwarts his attempts to overcome us right here this revelation so esther had to come to this revelation esther had to come to a greater revelation in her walk she couldn't just take the revelation that i'm called she couldn't just take the revelation i'm chosen she couldn't just take the revelation i'm the queen but she had to experience it she had to hear it from the king's own lips the king had to tell her personally not through a messenger amen not through the chamberlains but there come a time when esther was brave enough to approach unto king there was a time when she went into his inner chamber amen and the king the king told her himself what would you want anything it'll be given to you up to half my kingdom her doubt just faded away she knew he loves me she caught a revelation right there that day this king loves me nobody's willing to give half their kingdom to somebody they tolerate or half their kingdom to somebody they're obligated to or half their kingdom to somebody in a pre-arranged marriage they don't even like but only in those that they delight in would they be willing to give half the kingdom brother branham says in recognizing your day in its message in 64. like israel back in her promised land she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically put back there why national force put her in her place now i'm going to say something national force put israel on her homeland national force will put the church in the world council of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride not national force not governments not anything else you think persecution will do it persecution's not going to put anybody in the bride amen talk about the squeeze coming on and there is going to be a squeeze there's a persecution and i believe it's already set in motion but that's not going to put anybody into the bride no because the bride comes by revelation but the power of god will put the people in the bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place what's going to put the bride in her place the word of god the word of god is going to positionally place because it's the word that tells us we're joined heirs with christ is the word tells us that he delights in us so the word will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in christ will put her in her place no national force will do it but the national force did drive israel to the homeland and the national forces of the council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of god will raise the bride and to glory out of it amen not national force but revelation on the word it's the word that puts the bride into position that's why we love this word that's why if you neglect this word you don't know who you are and you don't know what your position is and you don't you don't know that the scepter's been extended and you don't know that whether or not you've actually taken it or not you don't have a revelation of that because we're neglecting the word brother branham said you let so much take it out of you he said you let your jobs and you let your family and you let your spouse you let so much take this out of you why because we're caught in this world called laodicea and we're tied up with all kinds of foolishness amen but that's not going to put us in position right sports endeavors and hockey games and whatever else it's not going to put us in position it's the word that puts us in position it's the word of god amen backed by the spirit of god that's got the power to positionally place the bride amen you can't hang back and wait for your wife you can't hang back and wait for your husband you can't stop moving on you can't pull back from the word for your children to save your children you'll never save your children outside of this word you'll never save your children amen you can't the only thing that's going to positionally place you the only thing is the word amen that's why we sell out to everything else around us we put the word preeminence in our life amen there's people who have the word will be preeminent in their life until college football season comes around and ohio state's back on the tube and then now the word's not preeminent anymore now ohio state's preeminent because it gets four hours of my time every week and the word might get 15 minutes a day or sunday and wednesday that's not going to positionally place you in the land that's not the power you need to overcome but the power you need is in the word and not that i hate football please don't think that but what's taking it out of us where's our distractions what is it what is it that's keeping us from finding our position in christ because it's not the word you can't spend too much time in the word and in prayer amen brother brahma goes on to say in christ is the mystery of god revealed the new birth is christ is re is a revelation god has revealed it to you this great mystery and that's a new birth pretty easy the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth but we make it so hard don't we we'll make it well if i don't speak in tongues well i never shouted i didn't dance in the spirit i've never seen tongues and interpretation where's that said where is that mention and where is that in the scripture as a requirement no the new birth is the revelation of jesus christ this great mystery unfolding to you you hear your name called as he unfolds the book amen now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew it its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is hallelujah i don't know about you but i want to go i'm looking for that rapture that's why i'm dedicating my life to this word to find my positional placement in the word and let the word chip off everything that's ungodly out of my life and get me fit for my positional placement so that i can find my place in this body so that we can go oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what not who what it is what is it the very manifestation of the deity of god almighty on earth that's what it is amen well we can say it but believing it's differently than saying it we've got to know it it's got to become part of us until we don't blush when we say i'm part of the body of jesus christ i'm part of that bride which is the manifestation of the deity of god on earth this day that takes a tremendous let's get back to esther pick up our story in esther chapter five he she comes to the king and the king says what can i do for you in verse 3 he says what what is thy request it shall be given to thee to half of my kingdom and in verse 4 then and esther answered if it seemed good unto thee unto the king let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him then the king said cause haman to make haste that he may do that he may do as esther hath said so the king and haman came to the banquet and esther had that esther had prepared 6 and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even to half of the kingdom it shall be performed then it then answered esther and said my petition and my request is if i have found favor in the sight of the king and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for the for them and i will do tomorrow as the king hath said you know when things like this happen in the scriptures i always say what what what is she afraid how could she be afraid this is the second time he says west thy petition it'll be given to thee up to half my kingdom how could she's not afraid esther's not afraid here there's no way that esther could be afraid to tell the king because what's going to be different tomorrow than today nothing changes between tomorrow today except that now we have the first coming of the king but there's going to be two comings of the king hallelujah esther esther's going to find deliverance for herself and for her people not in the first coming of the king but in the second coming of the king and it's not when she approached unto the king that she's going to find deliverance it's when the king comes to her banquet of wine she invited the king to come to her inner chamber won't you come to my house to my and we know this is the entertainer because later we find haman throwing himself upon esther on the bed why don't you come to my inner chamber for my banquet of wines to have communion with me in my house this is the baptism of the holy ghost when does the baptism of the holy ghost come to the church in the third day justification through looser sanctification through wesley but the baptism of the holy ghost in pentecost amen it's the third day of the three days of restaurants restoring the temple the three dispensations of time where he's bringing it back and the third day we have the holy ghost baptism of the holy ghost but guess what there's not deliverance in the third day there's not deliverance in the third day there's deliverance in the fourth day praise god let's go on and read it this is going to get good so esther asks if i have found favor this is my request come tomorrow then haman storms off and he tells his wife what a wonderful person he is and how the queen loves him and it's amazing that when the king comes to communion in the inner chamber of esther the queen the king comes to esther's house all right the first time the king came to esther's house was in the book of acts in the upper room when there was 120 there and that's the first time the king came to esther's house but when the king came to esther's house guess who else was there haman was there amen brother brahma said the man in the mirror is your enemy nobody else is your enemy that old sin nature that's inbred into you because of hybridization in the garden of eden your enemy your haman has been with you from day one and when you invite the king to come to your banquet of wine guess who's there haman's there brother ma'am talked about the white dog and the black dog right the white dog and the black dog you don't ever get rid of the black dog not in this life he's always there you got to keep him on a short leash you got to put him on a choker chain you got to put studs on the inside of that choker chain all right keep him tied down because haman's always there and in the first coming in the book of acts when the king came to his little bride there in acts 120 in the upper room guess who else was at that banquet of wines amen but now we've had the return of the baptism of the holy ghost in the third day and then that third day the king comes amen and who's there haman but the queen says i'm not going to tell you today and the third day but if you'll come back tomorrow which is the fourth day then we're going to find out what happens in the fourth day hallelujah brother branham says in revelations chapter 4 in 1961 now remember god's got god's guards of the ark or the mercy seat he's got guards now remember that to how many john saw how many four he's talking about the four cherubims around the the throne of god how many did he see he saw four four living creatures now watch they both seen the same vision amen the four is the number of earth did you know that how many knows now before we have to go on into four is the earthly number sure like the uh it's the number of the earth of deliverance deliverance now keep that in your mind deliverance because i'm going to strike it just a minute real hard see deliverance now there was three hebrew children in the fiery furnace but the fourth one came in it was deliverance lazarus was within the grave three days but on the fourth one came he was delivered four is god's number of deliverance so it showed that these beings must have been something about the earth he's talking about the cherubims they're four four is the number of deliverance there's been four anointings through the church ages the lion knocks the man and the eagle he types it with matthew mark luke and john the same anointing on those four gospels but he says they're always there guarding the ark but he said it's deliverance doesn't come in one or two or three but four which happens to be the eagle anointing and the fourth anointing comes deliverance amen he says that in uh the seed is not here with the shuck in 65. now remember according to the revelation the whole mystery of the book is sealed with seven seals that the reformers didn't have a chance to bring forth four stages of reforming the four beasts four stages of reforming the four stages of four beasts that went out to meet the four powers so there's reformation finishes in four stages it's completed in four stages four is the number of deliverance so we pick up the story in verse five esther says come back tomorrow now there's a long gap between the first and second coming of the king because in scripture all of chapter 6 which is the number of man all of chapter 6 is wedged right in between this first coming and second coming and we don't pick up the second coming again until which chapter chapter seven people thought they were just dividing out the chapters you know just however led and paragraphs and verses god is in the numerology in the bible five is the number of grace six is the number of man seven is the number of completion hallelujah so in in six haman can hardly enjoy his time with the queen because this mordecai oh this mordecai still wouldn't bow to me so he goes home and he's telling his wife oh how great i am and the queen even no man could go in but me and the king and oh it was wonderful but this mordecai and his wife said why don't you build a gallows 50 foot high on top of the house and then go to ask the king if you can hang haman it's a great idea so next day he comes in in chapter six which is the number of man it just shows the foolishness of man he comes in number six and it happens to be that that night the king can't sleep and the king asked for the chronicles of the of the records of the court to be read to him and there he reads how these two two rotten dirt bags were going to try to kill him but mordecai told him about that and he was saved and he says hey have we done anything for this mordecai he says no we haven't he says okay well end walks haman and he says haman what should be done to the man whom the king highly delighteth in well and of course he's like he's talking about me amazing how the devil plans his own destruction amen and how he's deceived by his own beauty is that what the scripture says about him he was deceived by his own beauty amen so haman says get the royal apparel put on your own clothes on that man put your crown on his head get your horse put him on your horse and lead him through the street and proclaim loudly with one of your most noble princes going before him saying behold this is the man whom the king highly favors the king goes good idea go get mordecai do everything you just said and do it to mordecai god's got a sense of humor so now haman goes chapter six he goes and he does all this stuff for mordecai because mordecai's got to be exalted amen so he does all this to mordecai then after that he goes home and he's fuming oh i'm going to get that mordecai he's going to hang on those gallows i built it just for him amen i've etched his name in the side of it we're going to get him and all of his people with him we're going to get him amen so so then we go to chapter seven and in verse six it's at that time that he's very upset and he's wroth that they come to get him to take him back to the second second banquet of wines in esther's house amen haman's always on the scene let's go to chapter 7 esther chapter 7. so the king and haman came to the banquet with esther the queen now remember when did they come in the third day or in the fourth day the fourth day four is the number of deliverance brother branham said in the restoration of the bride tree he said four killers took it he's talking about the bride tree and he's talking about four manifestations of the same bug that took it down to death four messengers destroyed it four messengers of death took it away in dogmas four messengers of righteousness restored back again four is the number of deliverance four took it down four bring it back what are those four messengers of righteousness the four anointings on the church ages amen prophesy son of man can these bones live look he's jumping ship he's moving from joel in the restoration of the bride tree now he's moving to ezekiel prophesy son of man can these bones live wish we had time i got it wrote down here but i have to miss that prophesy can these bones live what's the four stages of that coming forth of the church what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the life only came not when the sinew skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when came back that fourth message of life we got it i will restore saith the lord hallelujah glory praise be to god the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs watch justification brought back the pulp sanctification brought back the bark the doctrine of holiness brought back the leaf pentecostals what is it pentecostal leaves clapping their hands joy rejoicing pentecostal what the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the resurrection signs that christ was finally after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism of the holy ghost organizations died out and christ has again centered himself like the cap of the pyramid he preached this in 1962 before the seals first line justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost then coming of the cap that's the fourth stage that's the fourth anointing that's the eagle anointing that's that is deliverance he says in the masterpiece 1964 notice here the life that was in the husk in the in the stalk and in the tassel and the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stalk went one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptisms of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself amen you couldn't marry amen the outpouring of the gifts you couldn't marry the holy ghost being poured out upon the people but you can marry the holy ghost itself because this is marriage time now it's not courtship time but the baptist holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself now you know why the error of denominationalism had to be corrected because the holy ghost itself cannot come where there's error in the hearts of the people so he's got to dissolve the error of denomination the denominationalism of false teaching before he can come himself to indwell the people he says in the feast of the trumpets 1964 the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2 000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time hallelujah by the way i want to point out something here in esther that we haven't pointed out before esther in the third day she invites the king and haman to come into her inner chamber into her banquet of wines to have communion with her but then we know that she says come again on the fourth day come again the next day the fourth day which that's the number of deliverance he's showing he's showing how the bride is getting deliverance over the devil not in the third stage but in the fourth stage not just in the outpouring of the gifts of the holy ghost not just the baptism holy ghost but the holy ghost himself the personal holy ghost dwelling inside of you not an anointing on your flesh not an anointing on your spirit but a baptism in the soul fourth stage so in chapter six we have haman going home after the banquet getting all upset his wife giving him this great idea him going in the next morning as the king's waking up then haman's got to take mordecai and the garments and the crown and the horse and lead him through all of shunam shushem declaring this is the one whom the lord delights in then he goes back home and he's complaining to his family all these things and speaking even a mordecai then they come to get him for the banquet when is the banquet taking place in the evening time in the morning he's with the king all day he's leading mordecai around town the banquet of wines is taking place in the evening time this scripture is absolutely perfect this word is perfect oh my goodness those who think brother brandon made this up to to just exalt himself that's absolute foolishness that man had a seventh grade education how in the world could he make this stuff up i mean never mind there is no way there's no way in the world that he can make this stuff up they say he got it from larkin i mean i was talking to dwayne lawson the other day we were comparing notes he said brother branham could sum up all of larkin's life work in 30 minutes in preaching but in 30 minutes of preaching it's taken the rest of our lives to try to unravel what brother branham has brought in 30 minutes of preaching amen praise god he didn't copy lark and he corrected larkin i want that to go on the record because larkin had some major errors in what he taught so he did not copy larkin he corrected larkin he did not copy uriah smith he corrected uriah smith don't get that wrong i don't care how much of it is the same which is not a whole lot not as much as they claim but it doesn't matter this is the only one on earth that could correct larkin that could correct smith hallelujah so we get into chapter seven i love that at seven verse 1 so the king and haman came to the banquet with esther the queen now fourth day number of deliverance the second time the king has come all right and the king said again unto esther in the second day at the banquet of wine what is thy petition queen esther and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request and it shall and it shall be performed even to the half of my kingdom this is the third time he's told her this praise the lord then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favor in thy side old king and if it please thee let my life be given me at the petition in my people at my request what is she asking for she's asking for life she's asking for her life in this age what is it that we want what's the greatest desire of our hearts is life not this life i want my life i want the life i had with him before i want the life that i was eternally predestinated to have i want my life back not the one that i've i found myself in because of hybridization in the garden not the one that i'm trapped in because of sin in the beginning that's not the life i want i want my life back my life the one that haman has taken from me who was it that caused the deception in the garden who was it that was deceiving eve in the garden who was that that was whispering to the woman amen who was that that was incarnate in the serpent who was that that was haman that was the devil and he's trying to take my life but i want my life and i'm coming to the king and the kings come to my inner chamber amen not the first time he came in the book of acts but now in this day in the fourth stage of the restoration amen and the wrapping up of all things under the eagle anointing i'm imploring the king and he's offering me anything i want up to half the kingdom but you know what i want i want my life back i want the thing that was taken from me back in the garden of eden i want that back eternal life amen eternal sonship that's what i want back hallelujah when are we going to get it back in the number four second time he come in the banquet of wines verse 4 for we are sold i and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we had been sold for bond men and bond woman i had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage then then the king of hazeras answered and said unto esther the queen who is he and where is he that there's presumed in his heart to do so who in their right mind would try to take the life of my queen and esther said to the adversary it said the adversary in enemy is this wicked haman now get this then haman was afraid before the king and the queen haman was afraid before the king and the queen amen you know what scares haman to death to be exposed by a queen who's in her position by a queen who knows who she is and know whose he is and knows how to expose his works she knows who's trying to take her life it's not a mystery it's this wicked haman the aga guide the amalekite it's he take him he's the one who's taken my life it's not that we have any mystery now we don't know why we're so we're sold unto sin we don't have a denominational thinking of not knowing why i don't understand an apple in apricot why why do i lose eternal life we know who it was we know what it was the whole plan his whole plan has been unveiled to us and what's happened haman has been utterly exposed by this message all of his tactics all that he's trying to do all his deception how he's moving the nations how he's moving the denominations how he's doing everything it's been exposed and who is going to expose him who's going to defeat him the queen win in the second banquet of wines when the king comes into her in her chamber and he she says this wicked haman amen this wicked haman this amalekite that the jews could never be free from this son of agag that could never they didn't do what god had told them the first time and now they're dealing with ambalakites they're dealing with the son of ag and now we're dealing with haman the amalekite in my flesh he's my enemy but in my banquet of wine he's there he shows up but the king has come and now i'm telling the king this wicked haman this hybridization this evil that was sown into my flesh this wicked haman's got to go and guess who was afraid haman was afraid not just before the king because you know where the devil has access right now to the throne of god the devil's not afraid to go into the throne room of god is that what the scripture says that's what job tells us he's been there he talks to he talks to god they have conversations about the believers is that what the book of job says he he wasn't afraid in the presence of the king haman wasn't afraid in the presence of the king in fact haman knew that he had certain rights and privileges and authority had been given to him because they were they they were forfeited by adam and now he's got them amen they've been delivered to me that's what he told jesus these things have been delivered unto me he's got them he has the power and rule over them amen so he wasn't afraid in the presence of the king he was afraid in the presence of the king and queen when the queen exposed him that's what put fear in haman's heart and that's what gave her deliverance and that's what gave deliverance to the people of god amen praise the lord verse 7 and the king arising from the banquet of wine and his wrath went into the palace garden and haman stood up to make requests for the life to esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king then the king returned out of the palace and isn't it funny this is always the tactic of the devil when he knows he's in trouble he tries to make a deal with you every time he knows he's in trouble he tries to make a deal with you amen you know there's preaching anointing preaching coming across the pulpit that's just hitting you right between the eyes and you know that old devil that's been duping you into believing certain things he's being exposed right there and whether it's whether it's video game addiction or whether it's pornography or whether it's gossip or or whether it's wasting time and romance novels or whatever he's nailing you right between the eyes and all of a sudden he starts making a deal with you well don't go down we'll just do less of it right don't go get deliverance from the it's not an addiction it's just something you enjoy and it's okay we'll stop we'll stop we won't do it no more haman starts to make a deal with you when he's being exposed haman oh no no no no no no it's not like that really really it's not like no no no just just cut it back a little bit and everything's going to be all right it's not going to be all right it's time for haman to get hung on his own gallows it's time for haman to be destroyed by his own vices it's time for haman to go to where he was trying to take god's people trying to take mordecai it's time for haman to be destroyed and for esther to be completely delivered brothers and sisters we've come to the fourth stage of the ministry we've come back to four and it's time for complete deliverance i don't want to cope with my flesh i want to be delivered from my flesh i don't want to cope with the devil i want to be delivered from the devil i want to expose haman at every turn everything he does i'm going to go to the king he's doing this i want to be a tattletail hey hey hey god guess what haman's doing now i want to expose him in every part of my life i want to expose him in every trick and in every trap and i want that devil to be so afraid of me because i'm standing with the king and he's scared in the presence of the king and the queen he's not afraid when he get the queen to herself he's not afraid just in the presence of the king but he's scared to death before the king and the queen the whole world someday is going to stand before the king and the queen and then all that the devil has done through all the ages is going to be fully exposed in the white throne judgment and he's going to quiver because he's standing before the king and the queen we have to know our position brothers and sisters i want to go just a little bit further and then we'll wrap it up king goes to the palace garden haman was falling upon the bed where on esther was then said the king will he force the queen also before me in the house as the word went out of the king's mouth it covered haman's face and harman on one of the chamberlain said before the king behold also the gallows 50 cubits high which haman had made for mordecai who had spoken good for the king standeth in the house of haman then the king said hang him thereon all of his trappings all of his plan turned right back on his head brother brenham starts talking in the seal book maybe before but i was reading it in the seal book and thereafter do you remember his story of the drop of ink and clorox there's an interesting part of the story i'd like to bring out right now he says when that drop of ink he said i might have my chemistry wrong he's not trying to be a chemist he's just trying to prove a point he said when that drop of ink goes into the bleach it goes completely disappears you can't even see it anymore see what it do he goes it went back to its original form it went back to what it was before so he starts talking about the blood of jesus christ and he says if the clorox bleach that when we drop our sin our lives drop into that bleach it obliterates all sin and takes it back to what it was before and brother brennan said see puts it back on the devil the original source of all the problems the originator of all the troubles amen haman haman had this great elaborate plan he had these gallows built he had a destruction coming to all the jews but guess what everything that he had been working for however long he had been working in everything wrapped up and that he fell in his own pit he hung on his own gallows everything that he had worked out everything that he had accumulated all his plans was his destruction and now we've got a clorox bleach of the blood of jesus christ that if we by faith can step into that everything goes back to the original everything that he tried to do all of his plans through time all of his little uh treaties and all of his little undermining deals it goes right back to haman all fingers point back to haman when we cross through the blood of the of jesus christ and now it's not my sin now it's his sin i get deliverance he gets judgment hallelujah verse 10 so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai then was the king's wrath pacified verse eight on that day did the king azaris give the house of haman the jews enemy unto esther the queen what's this think about this in the fourth day and the banquet of wines the second time the king comes do we believe he's come the second time do we believe this is the second coming of christ he's come where to my banquet of wines he's come to my house into my inner chamber and he's and i'm exposing haman there and after he comes there haman's got all this stuff and we see him in luke talking to jesus saying all these kingdoms and all of this stuff and the power and the glory of it i'll give to you for it's been delivered unto me but after haman in the fourth day is exposed all esther has to do is invite the king to come to her banquet she's not working she's inviting the king to come to a banquet jesus says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice i will and open unto me i will come into him and sup with him and he with me what and a banquet of wines and sweet communion where in your house in your inner chamber and now in the second coming of the king he's in my inner chamber and haman is being exposed on the fourth day under the fourth anointing under the number of deliverance he's being exposed guess what happens next in chapter eight what's eight eternity new day in chapter eight esther didn't destroy haman the king destroyed haman and the king just allowed haman to destroy himself it was his own plan it was his own gallows he hung in his own plan but in the eighth day after deliverance is made everything that was haman's becomes the queens becomes esther's oh we may not be much of a people on earth today but you just wait because we're in the day of deliverance we're in the fourth day right now and the king's in my house and haman's being exposed right now and very shortly he's going to be utterly destroyed and guess what's going to happen we're going into the eighth day sometime after the millennium and all that was his it will be mine why because i'm a joint heir join heirs with jesus amen it's mine let's all stand i didn't get to finish this so we'll have to do this one more time how many love esther love the story of esther how many have found yourself in the story of esther better than that than that how many have found the plan of redemption in esther how many found the seventh seal in esther brother ben was right wasn't he he showed it in every type that's in the bible has he showed it in esther absolutely this entire scripture is telling us the same story it's the mystery of redemption and when is it unfolded in the last day you know what scholars want to do with the book of esther they want to take it out of the bible because they say they can't really validate it and they don't clearly understand why it's there and it doesn't really make sense and so they think esther should be removed from the bible how many think esther should be removed from the bible no way that's my book i'm there it's a story of redemption it fits perfectly in with the rest of the scriptures and you don't have to be a theologian and go to school for six years to figure that out all you got to do is listen to the fourth age messenger to the eagle anointing to the number of deliverance and you find out that esther's my book and it's a story and picture of redemption not just for the bride but for the 144 000 oh this word is good musicians if you want to come come forward let's just ask the lord to bless his word how many so blessed when i was brother brother eugene bronze in edmonton he had this saying that he would he had with his church that i really enjoyed he talked about the road to emmaus and the breaking of bread and i've referred to it several times but he says how do you know that it was the lord that's been talking to you you come to church on wednesday night you come to church on sunday you listen to the message through the week and how do you know that it's the lord that's breaking down these scriptures how do you know it's the lord that is talking about the old testament prophecies see they didn't know at the time but when they sat down in the evening time across the table from jesus and he broke the bread personally to them their eyes were opened and they understood what he was talking about your heart might burn during the preaching of the word and the road to emmaus their heart did burn but it's not the burning of the heart that really means much because that could just be a man who's gifted in speaking that could just be somebody who's stroking the kitty the right way and you really like it but when you know that this was the lord all along on our journey to emmaus this morning is when he sits across your table and personally before your eyes breaks the bread and you know that's not a man that's jesus christ that's not a pastor that's not an evangelist amen that's not a teacher that's jesus christ how do you know i saw him break the bread he broke the bread for me did he break the bread for you this morning then you know who's been talking on this journey this morning it wasn't a man it was jesus christ himself breaking the bread amen we could take anything we want and make up all kinds of types and shadows out of it but that's not what we're after we want jesus christ to reveal himself in the word we want him to break the bread we don't want the thoughts of a man we want the thoughts of god almighty has he broken the bread to this morning oh then we just worship and praise him let's let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord your word is so good it's so true lord we appreciate lord all that you've given to us lord this word is more meaningful to me than life itself lord this is my life this is my deliverance this is the thing that's bringing me into life lord i'm so thankful for what you've done help me never to neglect this thing god keep revealing your word to us opening our eyes and helping us to see this for what it is this is you o god this is you revealing yourself to us we receive it as you coming from you it's life this is spirit and this is life and this is the very thing that is going to change our body someday we ask for your revelation on your word we ask that you bless us lord in jesus christ's name amen i want to remind everybody we've got communion we're going to go and welcome to here or eat wherever and and then we'll gather back here for communion let's have communion at uh 3 30. all right so we gather back here at 3 30. uh do we know the song we are heirs with the father joiners with the son let's sing that song who believes we're heirs he told esther three times you're going to get anything you want up to half the kingdom he's told me and guess what i believe it i actually believe i'm gonna get everything that haman thinks he's got right now everything that haman's been acquiring and amassing guess what he's just collecting it for me he's just holding it until the day it comes to me because haman's got my stuff and i get haman's house amen let's sing this well we are aires of the father we are joined with the sun we are the people of his kingdom we are family we are one oh we are the father we are joyous with the son we are the people of his kingdom we are family we are one we are once we are sanctified we are cleared by his blood we are born of the spirits we are children of the

like him we shall see him face to face we are longing for his coming we are looking to the skies oh we are watching we are waiting we shall dwell with him we shall rise we shall reign with him forever oh man and angel shout and sing more dominion has been given to [Music] [Music] god bless you how many believe that oh call me crazy if you want but i believe it and i'm going to receive it not just
