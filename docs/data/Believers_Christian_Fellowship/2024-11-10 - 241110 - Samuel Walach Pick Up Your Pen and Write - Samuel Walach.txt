the voice of the Lord amen I want that word to change me I want my life to be changed I want to be molded into his image and I know he's going to take the sword of the spirit which is his word and he's going to remove whatever whatever needs removed to mold me into His Image amen man we're just going to turn the service over to brother Samuel and ask him to take his Liberty and relax and just Minister from his heart amen let's sing a song surely the presence of the Lord is in this place I can feel his mighty power and his great I can hear the brush of angels sweet I see glory on each face oh surely the presence of the Lord is in this oh surely the presence of the Lord is in this place I can feel his mighty power and his gra I can hear the brush of angels wings I see glory on each face oh surely the presence of the Lord is in this amen praise the Lord God bless you this morning Saints it's so wonderful to be in the presence of the Lord amen that's the only presence that we need to be in amen that's the only desire of our heart to be in his presence amen and then when we are in his presence then we see glory in each face amen we can see his power we can see his glory we can see his glory and on display and we are so thankful for that for for those that are bought with the with the blood of the Lamb amen for the purchased amen for those that are included in the book The Book of redemption amen we are so glad to be a part amen it's good to see all of your faces uh most of you you I know at least by faith and hopefully like brother brother Chad said that we are no strangers to each other amen even if we hadn't seen each other before we know that we've seen each other before before the foundation of the world Amen so if we do not recall seeing each other let's just look further back amen amen and we we were all found in the back part of God's mind amen amen so we are so thankful that the word put us together amen the word let us recognize our family amen praise the Lord so I'm so thankful to be here thank you for the invitation BR Chad and it's an honor to stand before you amen not just before you because I I like you I like your pastor you know but uh it is an honor to stand before the Bride of Jesus Christ amen to serve each other amen because it's not only uh the vessel that standing behind the pulpit that's serving the people in the audience but it goes from the audience back to the pulpit you know it's God everywhere it's God not only behind the pulpit but it's God in the pews amen it is the response of the word it is the Deep calling to the Deep amen not only calling but there is an answer back there's a response amen so I I believe that it is a time to move into the depth of the message amen we've covered the length we've covered the width we've covered the height of the message amen but you know with the width the the length it is only as far as you can go amen sometimes there are limits to that but when you enter into the deep amen that's where the limits are off amen you think you've reached uh the the bottom of the ocean but then you keep diving you keep diving and there's an another place a de deeper pocket that opens up to you amen and that's what we we we came here for Amen to discover the depth of the word amen not to be just shallow Believers amen I believe I believe there there aren't any shallow message Believers amen if you're a true message believer amen you you've recognized that four dimension amen the depth of the word the depth of the message praise the Lord amen so we want to cast to The Deep this morning amen praise the Lord so while you're standing Let's uh turn thank you musicians I appreciate you amen music uh we'll turn to Ephesians chapter 1: 3-2 amen you know it's it's good to relax in the presence of the Lord amen actually that's the only way how we can receive blessings from the Lord is when we are relaxed amen and be being relaxed as uh in the fact of who you are amen that brings such a comfort amen uh you know uh I can do myself best you know I cannot replicate anybody else I may try we as humans we try to replicate we try to copy each other uh but if you stay you that's how God likes you best amen amen because he purchased you amen exactly how you are he thought of you before the foundation of the world and he liked you that way amen so don't try to be somebody else amen you are ruining the plan of God Amen praise the Lord so Ephesians chapter 1: 3-2 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times amen he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ amen and another scripture found in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 2 through 6 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verses 2-6 so Paul writes ye are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all man for as M for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the apost the Epistles of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency our ability is of God Amen who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen I'm so glad for the balance in the teaching of Paul amen he he he points to our position and then he writes but our sufficiency is of God Amen our ability comes from God Amen let us remember that as we bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we want to stand here father appreciate you for who you are father appreciate your love appreciate your mercy appreciate your grace father appreciate father what you've done in our day and age Lord that you stoop down father that you made your presence known to your people father what what we could do father without your presence we couldn't do much Lord we could guide here we could gather here around a a word of a man father maybe have a good feeling about it but Lord your presence does the difference Lord your presence is here to heal every broken heart father M every situation Lord give us a better perspective of your word father give us a better perspective of the Plan of Redemption that you have for our lives Lord so let us just come Lord and relax in your presence because we know that we are in the presence of our bridegroom Lord we don't want to be tense Lord we don't want to uh put up a show Lord we don't want to uh try to be somebody else we just want to be ourselves Lord in your presence Lord having the confidence that you've chosen us before the foundation of the world Lord and we thank you for that we want to commit ourselves into your hands with the scriptures that we've read may you open the depth of the word to us Lord may we dive in today Lord and just be found immersed in your presence Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you you can take your seats praise the Lord amen so you know what it's it's it's it's a wonderful thing the time that we live in the end times amen for some people that's a dreadful thought to even think that we are at the end of time that uh these are the the end times you know and people even in the world people that have nothing to do with the Bible with with religion or or with the message they just recognize that it's the end time amen that something is coming to a close amen and they are fearful and they should be fearful amen because if you are not right with God the end times should be a dreadful day of the Lord amen but in the same time at the time of the Dreadful day of the Lord it is the most glorious time revealed for the Believers amen so God works in the law of contrast there is always a contrast on one hand the end times are Dreadful to the unbeliever but they are the GL most glorious time for the believer amen so it is so wonderful to be found on the right side of the end times Amen to be in the Glorious part of the end times because that's a glorious bride that's a glorious Church you know and we've been observing serving we've been watching The Plan of Redemption for so many years we look at the Bible we look at the scriptures we see the Plan of Redemption being unfolded before our eyes you know but the thing is that we don't want to just observe it we don't want to watch The Plan of Redemption because if you are a theologian maybe you are a scholar maybe you are going to see parts of the Redemption of the Plan of Redemption throughout the Bible and see and observe what God has been doing throughout history but you know what it's something different to be a a participant in the Plan of Redemption to be included in the plan amen that gives you a totally different perspective on things amen that makes you enjoy the Plan of Redemption even more because the Plan of Redemption is not just a wonderful plan it's not a wonderful scheme a wonderful concept or an idea but you're included in that amen so you know it's it's like in the natural you you have somebody who's building a house and that may be a stranger but that may very well be your close friend he's building a house and and he's all excited about it you know and that's very re reasonable and and we enjoy how people are are excited about the things that are happening in their lives you know and they are all excited they bring you the blueprints the designs of the house they they they can talk hours on how they are going to fix this or that or how they thought it out what kind of you know materials they are going to use what kind of brick what kind of wood you know and they are all excited about it and you know when you are in that conversation you are also excited you get excited about it amen because you're excited for your friend for somebody that's close to you amen but then you know after after you leave after two days you don't remember anything about the blueprint of the house amen you are not that excited about the plan of your friend's house amen he may have the best materials that he's going to use but you know that's just his blueprint that's his plan amen but is something different if that's your own plan amen if that's the plan of your house amen then you can become excited amen about it and and and you know in in a few days you'll still still keep thinking about it amen because that's your plan amen you know all about it because you're included you're not just observing the plan you're not watching somebody else getting excited but you are a participant you are a partaker amen and the scripture uh was written not to be just a book not to just be a good concept A Plan of Redemption but it it it always stresses The Importance of Being a partaker amen of having even Jesus in the time of the Comm union he told Peter that if you do not uh do these things you will have no Parton me amen you will not be a partaker of the plan of God you will not be involved amen but we are so thankful that we are involved and included in the Plan of Redemption praise the Lord you can be excited about the Minor Details but you can be excited about where the the electric Outlets will be how you will run your cables what type of isolation you'll use what kind of you know sound system you'll use in the church amen if you are invested in that that changes your perspective amen I'm so thankful for the message of this hour that gave us a new perspective on the word of God a fresh look on the word of God Amen and and perspective in the Greek is the art of seeing amen and we've had somebody who came in our day and age he was the prophet of this age he was the eyes for Our Generation amen and so we received the art we saw the art art of seeing amen seeing from another perspective from from another Viewpoint from a different position amen because the message of this hour revealed our position in Christ amen it put us on a higher pedestal it put us on a higher position that's why we look at things differently praise the Lord amen so we know about the Plan of Redemption that uh we saw God in the very beginning he was The Great I Am he was the alls sufficient one the the one that was so glorious so in inaccessible that the Angels they had to cover their faces because of the glory that was involved the the glory that was in heaven amen it was so distant it was so powerful that was so awesome and So Glorious amen and we knew that God had a certain plan amen once things were going uh bad and everything uh just collapsed during the fall amen we knew that God was in control we knew that God had a plan that's been uh that's been in his mind a a plan to fix the situation amen he already had that plan before the problem arose amen that's so wonderful that God is a good parent he's always prepared he's always prepared for every kind of situation amen because he gave us the free will to choose amen he gave us options and you know what he's prepared for every option that you take amen he's always been prepared for a human being to choose whatever he likes whatever was in his heart but God had a plan amen he had a plan to bring the the elect back to the line with the word amen praise the Lord you know so we knew God he was inaccessible we knew that he had a plan and we didn't understand his plan amen we just knew that he was in control that he was going to take care of the situation amen but you know if you are not if you're just watching God fixing something or or watching watching how God plans a certain route for your life or for somebody else's life you know you're just an observer amen and and so that's why you cannot be excited about the word if you're just an observer this morning amen but the word calls us to be partakers Amen partakers to Take A Part A an active part in the plan of God Amen not just being passive about it not just coming to church and watching What will what will come out of it what the preacher has in store whether he's uh he's in a good mood or in a bad mood whether he's on fire or he's Less on fire brother and sister you need to to be on fire amen you need to be in the same Plan of Redemption as the preacher is amen we are working in it together there is no place for an observer in the kingdom of God Amen there is only place for somebody who is a an adopted son of God that means there is a son in its position ready to be active ready to be used of the Lord praise the Lord so you know we see God that from this in visible God he became a visible God in the form of Jesus Christ amen it was the same God he he he he told the people that before Abraham was I am amen so he revealed that there is not something new that it is not a a different God it is the same God just in a human form amen so we saw God that from this being that was inaccessible he became tangible he became accessible for from somebody that was far away he became somebody close to us amen and that's that makes such a difference amen from the god in the heavens uh the the the object of worship there where he was worshiped by the angels and by the by the Heavenly beings and so on it was so glorious but God was not satisfied with the state of being amen he wasn't satisfied with this glorious Arrangement that that was happening in heaven amen he needed something more amen he needed something more than than just to be praised and worshiped and adored amen praise the Lord so that's why he implemented his Plan of Redemption praise the Lord so and you know uh the Mysteries the Mysteries all of the prophecies everything that was spoken in the Old Testament was revealed in Jesus Christ amen he was the exposition of the mystery he was the revelation of all of the prophets all of the seers all of the Scrolls that were written amen all of the scriptures that pertained to Christ they they were embodied in that man of Galilee amen praise the Lord so that was the revelation of Jesus Christ and it turned out that these crws these prophecies that were written about him he that was the Fulfillment of the law he was the Fulfillment of the law he was the Fulfillment of this cross praise the Lord amen but the secret was unveiled to just a few amen he made himself known just to the elect just to the few amen he had a public Ministry in Israel yes amen but his revelation of who he truly was was just to the very elect amen so there are people in our ranks in in in denominations that know the prophet that know the know the message because it is public it is available amen but there are there is just a handful of people who are able to receive uh what the message is truly what what what the message is truly about amen praise the Lord you know so when when when the disciples like the two disciples on the road to EMAs they were traveling there and they talked with a stranger that's at least what they thought there was a stranger that joined to them and they started to have Fellowship Fellowship around the world and Jesus uh being revealed in another form that's what the scripture tells us he he was the same Jesus but he was in a different form that was the same God but he had a different mask on and the people that were following him the people that were uh just around him every day for three and a half years they weren't able to recognize him that's right amen wow that's that's that's something amen that shows us the nature of God how he would hide himself amen even from the elect it seemed but he knows that the elect they've got something on the inside of them that eventually they'll they'll recognize him amen and that's what God expects of us today to eventually recognize him despite the mass despite the form despite the uh how odd or weird it seems to recognize God behind human skin Amen to recognize God in a certain situation that comes your way to recognize God in a problem amen we wouldn't associate God veiling himself in a problem but that's usually what he does Amen if there is a problem if there is a challenge coming your way and coming my way Amen Let us be still and see the salvation of the Lord let us see what's in that problem amen we need to enter our storm Amen brother Bram during the manifestation of the third pole God didn't you know he taught the people that once you see the snowflakes coming and the wind blowing head to Camp go back to Camp that was the teaching of the prophet of that hour he taught it to his brothers to the brothers that were with him go back to safety amen Whenever there are problems come back to church maybe go and talk with the minister talk with your pastor we'll fix it amen you'll be all right don't worry but then God came to the prophet when he was about to to to agree and to follow H his instructions and he was heading to the camp like he taught the brothers but then God stood in his way and he told him go back to the storm you see that problem coming your way don't run away from it you used to run away from it you used to teach the people that it's the best possible solution to run away from your problem amen come to church come to a place of safety but God wanted to deal with the prophet individually not in the camp amen Camp is all right amen Fellowship is fine it's all good it's all there for a purpose but there comes a time when you need to have an individual walk with God Amen you need to have a relationship you need to have a change in your life amen and change won't happen in the camp amen you need to go back to the place where God asks you to go amen where it's him and you alone amen that's the fellowship between you and the almighty God Amen so B Brown was reluctant because it it went against all of his teaching all of his experience as a guide yes everything that he was used to amen it went against it but anyways there was something on the inside amen there was something at first he didn't recognize God in the storm but then eventually he recognized that it was the form of God God veiled himself in a storm in a big huge problem amen something that was that was ready to kill him amen but he entered the storm amen and that's when God told him don't you want want to walk with me amen don't you want to have Fellowship sh with me and that's when the prophet he he was transformed he said my body it became new in every aspect of the word amen I I not only looked like a boy I I felt like a boy I thought as a boy amen praise the Lord so that's where the change is when you recognize God and he may be veiled you know he may be veiled in your brother he may be veiled in a situation in a problem he may be veiled in your enemy amen he can do it amen and every time he expects you to recognize him amen not only in a brother it's very easy to recognize him in a brother or or in a brother that you like amen because they're are different Brothers amen sometimes we have brothers that we have a you know uh we know they are brothers right but we don't think there is much behind that mask but God expects us to to look Beyond The Mask amen he doesn't make it easy he didn't make it easy for the two disciples that were on the way to EMAs amen that's right it wasn't easy but there was a little pattern amen there was a little something that they could tell by the breaking of the bread how the word was being shared they said that's God Alone amen that's the same God that we've witnessed for three and a half years amen praise the Lord you know and once they saw God not only in the Jesus of of Galilee or or or Jesus of Nazareth they they saw him in a stranger that was passing their way amen they saw him in a different form that's when the Scrolls came alive amen because they were fellowshipping they were fellowshipping around the word around the Scrolls but during that Journey from Jerusalem to to to EMAs amen these crws became a new book to them amen these craws contained something more than they ever had a chance to read in amen they read something in those crws that they hadn't seen before praise the Lord and so the next time they opened this cross they opened the law of Moses they opened Jeremiah they opened Isaiah all they could see was Christ amen because they met him face to face they recognized his presence and that changed their whole perspective praise the Lord amen you know that was the same Jesus that they touched that they uh had fellowship with that they ate bread and ate fish and so on but now that was somebody else somebody more than that praise the Lord and once they saw the unveiling of God they couldn't unse see it amen once they saw this the Scrolls uh made a new they couldn't see it in the old pattern amen they they couldn't I mean they could sympathize with the with the people in the synagogue they could relate to them because they've been that way but they couldn't have the same kind of Fellowship amen because once you see the word that's that's been revealed to you you cannot unsee it amen and I'm not talking just about a quote that's been revealed to you amen that you like or that makees sense to you or or you put or you could attack some logic to it amen that's seeing the word made flesh amen bam tells us in the sermon the Masterpiece he says now for nearly 2,000 years God has been again making a masterpiece because he struck Adam to get a masterpiece off of him part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he he got a piece off of him it's just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled see the old and the new is husband and wife see and it taken the new the all to foreshadow the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill that listen now now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another Masterpiece in the making amen praise the Lord so the pattern repeat heal amen Christ he he he came to fulfill the the Old Testament amen the Masterpiece but again we are living in the time of the second coming amen praise the Lord and the prophet tells us that now the bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament amen praise the Lord amen how how will she do it amen how by being a a a strong independent woman like leysia is today amen that the image of a a strong independent woman is being glorified today amen that's the ideal for a woman you know uh but she's not that way the Bride of the of the last age though he has a she has a great ministry though she has the word that speaks volumes of her amen how does she do it not as as a dominant woman amen but a woman that has a Meek and gentle spirit amen that's how God likes it amen she understands the word that's been spoken of her but it doesn't make her proud it doesn't make her independent from her bridegroom amen because we have that balance amen amen the same balance that Paul had in the very beginning where he would tell us all sorts of things that we are partakers of his divine nature and tell us that we are the Fulfillment of scripture and then he would tell us but remember Saints our ability our sufficiency is from Christ amen so if you're married Amen in the natural or in the spiritual you need to recognize that your sufficiency comes from your husband amen your ability if not for him if not for his presence we would be nobody amen we would try our best we would maybe read the scriptures in a carnal way and become an arrogant a dominant church amen puffed up people amen reading the message without the Revelation without that relationship with Christ will make you arrogant will make the church rough and dominant and and taking a on itself the the masculine spirit amen but God separated these two Spirits amen they are part of that one Spirit but they have a different work to accomplish amen so if the masculine Spirit accomplished the work for the Old Testament now the prophet tells us that the feminine amen is supposed to fulfill the the the things that were spoken in the New Testament praise the Lord and God's power to trans transformed 1965 brother Brown tells us now it's hard to say this it's very hard he says because I'm speaking to people who feel the same way I do and the way I have been for many years amen so that is a tra a a thing of tradition amen a a thing that's been taught to the church for years and that's how we all feel amen we we all feel as you know more or less uh like uh the mainstream of Christian Christianity amen but BR Bram goes on and he says it's very hard because I'm speaking to people who feel the same way I do and the way I have been for many years but since the opening of those Seven Seals of them Angels just behind the mountain Yonder this has become a new book amen so he had his feelings he he he knew that he he saw the book in a different way from a different perspec itive four years and he says it's hard it's difficult because now you see everything in a different light amen but he tells us that it was the opening of those seals that made this book become a new book is the things that's been HD is being revealed as God promised in Revelation 10 he would do it and we are the privileged amen people that God has chosen of the earth that do we might see and understand these things amen which is not some mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying to make it up it's the word of God made manifest proven that it's right proven not by science amen but by God praise the Lord science is all right if it proves God then we are glad for it but we do not trust science amen the world outside they say trust the science amen you know dur dur during the times that we've experienced in recent years they stressed out trust the science we tell you what to do trust the science that's right and they thought we are science whatever we tell you we are science trust us amen but there is something more than just science there is science that proves God Amen because he is the one who who developed of the laws the law of gravity the the laws that guide the universe that guide our natural uh human existence here on Earth amen but there is something more than that amen that's the word of the Lord God as I have said before in the message God doesn't need anyone to interpret his word he is his own interpreter he says it will happen and it happens he confirms it and that interprets it praise the Lord you know so brother Bram he puts a thick dividing line between the times where the seals were not open amen and the times where the seals became open to him amen that was a a thick dividing line as how he looked at the book as as at how he looked at the word of God Amen it is a a a separating line it is a dividing line it is a line that will that will just uh uh distinguish you from any other amen if you understand what God did in our day and age amen you are you've crossed the line amen you are on the other side you may look at the others you may sympathize with them amen but on the other hand they are not able to understand you amen because they haven't crossed the line because they are in in the old thought pattern in the old way of looking at the word amen praise the Lord so the opening of the seals the opening of the word and you know what uh the opening of the word is not a matter of argumentation right amen it is not not up for debate praise the Lord amen because we we can we can look at the word we can look at the message we can have all sorts of quotes amen we can pull out quotes that say that the the the the seals are not open yet amen that the that the book is closed amen we can have all sorts of quotes and then we can pull out quotes that say that the the word is open the the seals are loosed amen but it's not a matter of argumentation amen it's not that somebody has 500 quotes that say that the seals are not open and somebody has 5001 amen and that's how we win arguments amen it God's word is something more than than debate than argument praise the Lord it is not a matter of Doctrine that's right amen the seals the word for theour that's something more than Doctrine praise the Lord I'm so glad for it amen it's not about Doctrine Hebrews 810 and 11 maybe we'll we'll just quickly turn to it amen Hebrews 810 and 11 tells us for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days says the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord For All Shall know me from the least to the greatest amen praise the Lord so there is a a a time where the law is not only written somewhere but is put in the mind of a believer that means that it transforms his thinking the way he thinks about the word is different amen and I believe that we are not going to fight over Doctrine on the other side amen so and I believe that maybe we should quit fighting about Doctrine on this side as well amen because that's just not productive amen you you you cannot force anybody to believe something you cannot convince somebody to believe the opening of the word amen we are not here to to to just have proales Amen to proelite to them to the church to ask them in and just talk nicely and convince them that the opening of the word is Right amen praise the lord we are not followers of a Doctrine that's right amen we are not followers of a certain Movement we are not followers of a certain Camp praise the Lord amen you know Doctrine is very important and brother Brown tells us that the doctrine is the wall around it is the fence it is something that protects the church amen that's the doctrine amen but I believe that the doctrine is here H it is like a map a road map here on this side of glory amen that will just give you a detailed look upon things amen it will let you go from here to glory in the in the shortest shortest ways possible amen it it won't let you go on a detour here a and to go to a dead end and then you'll have to reverse and lose time and so on if you're Doctrine is Right amen and I believe that the doctrine that the prophet of of the Lord restored amen that's the right way to follow amen praise the Lord but but Doctrine these are not laws written in the book that's not a law that's not regulation amen that's not something written down the that that we look at you know for guidance we need to be guided by the spirit of the Lord amen praise the Lord amen so the word is not just debates over terminology amen the word is something more than just a dictionary amen because a dictionary will give you the the the exact definition of a word amen and that's what people are good at today they they they know everything about every subject they they hear the seventh seal they'll give you a definition of what the seventh seal is amen they they hear about the Thunders they will give you a definition amen but the word of God is something more than just a definition amen it is something more than just a letter amen it's something more than just a reference book that you can go into and and pull out of a COR condence or or a table or something like that it's more than that we use all of these things amen but we do not trust these things we trust the spirit of the Lord amen to show us in the right direction amen so so that's why you know it's it's something more than just Doctrine amen because on the other side I don't believe that we'll fight over Doctrine amen when we are there we we see the reality we are in that reality amen the doctrine will be redundant we'll see face to face amen we can touch we can talk amen we can have full relationship amen praise the Lord because that's how marriage works you know before you are married you can read about marriage amen you can talk about marriage you can you can ask this brother or that brother and you'll get all sorts of responses amen all sorts of Lookouts upon marriage amen amen but then when you are married amen it's not like when there is you know there is an issue coming up or you need to talk to your wife you go back to your reference book you you Google what to say you ask chat GPT what to say next amen how to respond to my wife in a loving way but in in in a way that will show that I also have needs I also want this not to be too dominant but and not to be too polite how to do it amen but then if you're in a relationship amen you grow in it you learn you learn how to fix stuff amen you you you you know the other the your spouse you know the partner amen praise the Lord amen so I'm so thankful that the word is something something more than just a book amen more than a physical book more than a a reference point more more than a dictionary amen because otherwise it is just dead letter amen and that's how people die today they have they know the text of the message they know the the text of the Bible and they are dead as that can be amen but what we need to know is the context amen something more than text text is very shallow it is it is it seems plain amen it's it's black black letters on white paper it seems plain and it couldn't be pler amen but if you don't know the context you know nothing at all amen if you don't have the relationship amen that guides you the depth of the word that is there to strengthen you to give you the anchor that you need text will be very very difficult for you amen it will get you in all sorts of troubles if you don't know the context amen it will be just another religion amen but the bride has the mind of Christ she has the context for the text that she hears amen when you hear the word there is a certain context amen there is something underlying that text amen there is there is a reference point but not a reference point in a book but the reference point in the back part of God's mind praise the Lord amen so everything everything changes when you see Christ there is a thick dividing line from the from the way you used to look at things and and now the things that that you see now amen praise the Lord and everything changes when the word tells you who you are amen and Christ is the the anointed word for the day amen he's been anointed especially for this day amen but I'm so thankful that not only the word not only what was spoken what was preached was anointed amen but there are people under the same anointing amen so there is a match in anointing amen praise the Lord so the anointing can flow not only not only on the head not it doesn't only stop on the head but it covers the entire body it runs runs down down the beard of the high priest and all over His Garment everything is Anointed with the same anointing oil amen and you know Paul tells us and and quoting the Old Testament I believe in Psalms he said then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God Amen praise the Lord that is so profound amen that is so profound that it was used in the Old Testament amen and then it was used in the New Testament amen by Paul he quoted the Old Testament we know Christ came to fulfill the Old Testament amen so this scripture pertained to Christ lo I come because in the volumes of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God but then comes Paul and he repeats the same thing in the New Testament pointing that there is somebody who needs to fulfill that new testament amen you have to fulfill that word in the scripture amen that you need to come because you recognize that in the volume of the book it is written of me and you come to do what to do thy will oh God Amen praise the Lord amen and yeah like we've uh read in the Masterpiece Christ come in the Old Testament the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another Masterpiece in the making right amen praise the Lord amen you know so there is a great uh division between being an observer and being a participant a partaker amen you know it's it's not about Doctrine it's it's it's something more it's about you amen about you being a partaker amen you know you can observe Doctrine you can learn about Doctrine you can study Doctrine am amen but to be a partaker that that means that's something uh something personal praise the Lord amen 1 Peter 51 tells us amen I'll just give you a chance to turn to it amen first Peter 51 the elders which are among you I exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed amen Peter says I am a partaker amen not only in the sufferings amen but there there there there is something that continues from the sufferings to the Glorious part amen I I am a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed praise the Lord you know brother Branham at the time of the of the opening of the seals when we know that he was in the sunset on Sunset mountain and you know there were these angels there was this Supernatural Cloud there were these angels that came down and told him to go to Jeffersonville and open the seals amen we know that it wasn't brother Bram opening those seals amen we know that it was the lamb taking the seals off of the book amen but you know the it goes alongside amen it is not BR Bram was here the lamb was there it was the lamb in the person of BR branam the lamb who was veiled behind human skin amen RI ripping those seals off of the book amen that's why brother Bram he was not he saw that glorious thing he described it but he was not just an observer at sunset Mountain amen baham tells us that he was caught up in that constellation of the seventh Angels amen so he was a partaker amen of what was going on in our day and age amen that's why he could preach the seals that's why he could open them amen that was the lamb taking off the seals from the book amen bra Braham could not have done it if if he was just an observer he had to be a partaker in that amen praise the Lord so like Jesus was lifted up Amen in the Old Testament he was lifted up and he said that when I am lifted up I will draw you nigh unto myself amen the prophet of this hour Amen in the ministry of that son of man amen who was he he was veiled behind human skin he was caught up in the constellation of the Seven Angels amen that's why we can be drawn to the same Cloud we can enter into the same hatch the same revelation of Christ amen we can also become partakers of his glorious mystery amen partakers of his divine nature not just observers amen there are a lot of observers here on this Earth amen but they are going to stay here that's right because there is nothing that will catch them up amen but once you've been caught up to that Revelation once you've seen yourself reflected in that cloud amen your representation that came from Heaven it matches your being your inner being amen praise the Lord then you can be a partaker in the catching away amen praise the Lord amen you know because he was a participant he's he he could say that's a totally new book to me amen I used to be an observer of the book and I liked it BR Brown said but now it's something totally different now I recognize that I am a a partaker and I've always been a partaker of the book Amen in the volumes of the book it Is Spoken of me amen and I recognize it and therefore I come to do thy will oh God Amen praise the Lord once brother Bram saw it the opening of the word he couldn't unsee it he couldn't return back to to the previous ages to the previous reformer messages amen he recognized that it is a time of restoration praise the Lord amen praise the Lord in Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother Bram tells us look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation that's a very known uh quote but I'll read it anyhow Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing amen amen see what God is trying to do the prophet says amen you need to see what God is trying to do amen it's not only Christ who's the center of Revelation but Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing amen bream tells us that God without you is incomplete amen you know before the foundation of the world when uh we we could see that that glorious arrangement of Heaven everybody was worshiping everybody was praising the the Lord God he was Elohim he was the all sufficient one amen so he could sustain himself without any help from anybody else amen he didn't need anybody amen and that's how you know forgive me for the types sometimes that's how we feel as Bachelors you know we are single people single young people you know and many times we think I'm all sufficient you know I'm I'm very young I'm all sufficient I don't need anybody why would anybody want a wife why would you amen but then once you're married amen you realize that you've been incomplete all along amen there is a part of you that just matches you exactly amen amen and the same thing was with God he was complete amen he felt complete amen the Elohim the all-sufficient one the self-existing one amen he didn't need any body else but then when he started to reveal himself in flesh amen bar Brown tells us that he is not complete without you amen God made it in such a way that he is not complete without you he needs you to be complete amen praise the lord we should be happy about it amen that he needs you to be complete amen amen what a thought amen praise the Lord that means that for sure you're not just an observer you need to be a participant you need to be a part you are the missing part of God yeah amen amen but you are not missing any anymore amen you've been found by the end time message amen the message called you out and you've responded there was a deep that called that used to call for ages but there was no deep to respond amen because that deep that is the missing part of God that's the missing part of God that he placed inside of you amen that's the seed Gene of God that responds just to the word just to the right kind of frequency amen praise the Lord then I said lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God Amen we know in Revelations 5 we recognize this situation there we see John uh the Revelator the type of the Bride you know standing there in wonderful conditions amen standing in in in Heavenly places we would say standing there and seeing the everything that transpires amen seeing the book in the hand amen seeing the seals he saw the seals amen am but they were on the book that's right they were not loosed amen what we actually cherish is is not just the seals but the book that's been released because of the seals that were taken off amen praise the Lord so we see beneath the seals amen what's inside there is it's not just the the event of the breaking of the seals but there is a message that's been released to the bride of Christ amen so we remember John he didn't have he was John the Revelator but he didn't have Revelation at this Point amen he was standing there and he was weeping because he was just an observer amen he was looking at the entire scene and he knew that nobody was worthy amen he didn't know whether he he was accepted or he was not accepted that's why he wept because he was an observer amen but then he heard a voice there was an elder that came to him amen he heard a voice from from behind him amen he he heard that still small voice voice that told him amen you are part of that plan amen you are a partaker your name is in the book and there is somebody worthy to take the book amen not only to take the book to to to show you the seals but to break the seals for you amen so there are many people who who can accept the seals you know and and then and they can preach the seals amen but they preach the seals that are still on the book right but what what we want to preach and what we want to hear back is what's behind those seals amen we want to break the seals Amen in our lives amen sir that was personal for John the seals were broken personally for John amen because that was a personal revelation John wasn't weeping because of the state of the entire world the the the the the entire age he wasn't consumed with that he was consumed with the fact that I don't know if I'm I'm going to make it amen because I'm standing here in the presence of the Lord I have nothing to show for myself I have no merits of my own I have nothing you know he had a Ministry behind him amen he walked with Jesus Christ amen he was sent to to the a of patmas he had everything to show for him at least that's what we humans think that he had a a good resume amen his resume he didn't even pull out his resume in the presence of the Lord amen so whatever you think of yourself whether you think you have a bad resume or a really good resume amen don't pull it out before the Lord amen if you find yourself in the presence of the Lord amen right that won't even cross your mind to go on your own merits amen praise the Lord because our own merits they they they condemn us amen Braham says it's the record that con condemns us it's what we've done that condemns us and many times we want to bring it as evidence amen I'm so glad that we are not representing ourselves in court amen that we've got somebody who represents Us Praise the Lord he's not only the the the judge but he's also our Advocate amen he represents our case yeah we would be really bad at showing our case amen we would pull out our records what we've done amen and that would actually prove that we are guilty amen but what happened with John he from a state of being an observer over everything he became a partaker because he saw his name in the book amen he saw that I am a partaker of divine nature amen because it's not just the book of life it's the Lamb's Book of Life Meaning included in the book are names of the people who live the life of the lamb amen that's right that do not live a a life of their own amen they don't come because they can present God a a wonderful resume amen they come to God because they can they can display the resume of the Lamb amen they can say I live the the the life of the Lamb amen praise the Lord and when he saw himself in the book amen praise the Lord once he saw his name in the book he couldn't unsee it amen he couldn't look at the book differently he he he couldn't look at the seals in a different way because not only did he see the the the seals being broken of the book but he saw his name in the book amen praise the Lord so it was the word that changed the position of John from a mere Observer to a participant praise the Lord amen hallelujah he looked in in the volumes of the book yeah amen and he saw himself right that's why he could come and do the will of God Amen praise the Lord it had to become a new book Amen to John so what we've read uh what we've read actually I didn't give you the title I'm sorry pick up your pen and write amen that's the title for for today if we get to that amen amen I'm not a long-winded preacher at least that's what I want to think of myself amen uh but BR Brown tells us in the unveiling of God he says as it is written see ye are written Epistles the Bible said now what is epistle it is a written word and you are the written other words you are read like this you could read it like this you are written epistle you are the word says that has been written and made manifest right nothing can be added to it let it sink in amen nothing can be added to the epistle the written epistle you can't say I'm a written epistle and living some other kind of a something but what this has already wrote right amen so you can live what's been written about you amen you are a written epistle because nothing can be added or taken away amen oh wow that's deep amen ye are written Epistles and nothing can be added or subtracted from that written epistle amen praise the Lord you know in the beginning there was the word and it was with God and God was that word amen and then it became flesh and dwelt amongst us amen that's that's John John chapter 1 the the first few verses but I believe that's also our scripture amen that in the beginning there was the word amen that in the very beginning there was the word and we were part of that word amen we are the word that was written and manifested amen it's being manifested right now Hallelujah you cannot add or subtract anything from your life from the life of the Lamb amen if you are part of the Lamb's Book of Life there is nothing to add to the life of the Lamb or SE ract from the life of the Lamb amen praise the Lord there is nothing to to change there is nothing to to improve upon amen that's the life of the lamb praise the Lord and we've been we've been made written Epistles hallelujah praise the Lord and that's the good pleasure of his will that's that's that's how God wanted it amen and it it brings joy to God when he sees that you accept his plan amen praise the Lord that's the secret of his will and we've read it in the very beginning having made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times amen this our time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being destinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ amen and another quote from the unveiling of God baram says he relates a story he says now someone has been many has been saying to me and theologians said BR branam if the Lord God said with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people humbly saying this said you would be eligible to write a Bible yourself your word if God has manifested I said that might be true see he was trying to catch me see I said but you see I couldn't do that he said why couldn't you you have all the qualifications amen wow what a statement he wasn't like that wasn't just opposition that came to brother Braham that was a the Theologian but he he would Elevate the ministry of brother Brown he would Elevate his position amen right but the prophet knew where he stood amen I said but you look one word cannot be added or taken away see and he said well then then seven tunders you see amen that was a theologian he he was up to date amen he knew the lingo he knew everything amen he just didn't have the revelation amen but he was talking to somebody that had amen wouldn't them seven Thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation to give to some man I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was that's what it was see see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word and God's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and Open the Eyes of others it'll always do that amen and now that's that's paragraph 280 that's the very next paragraph BR Bram says after the the encounter with the Theologian that proposed BR Brown to write another word to add something add to the Revelation because he he he had that revelation of bar Bram it seems in high esteem he would regard it as something great something that would be the extension the continuation of the word but then brother R says that would be off the word and but then he adds ye are written Epistles read of all men I translate that turn around this away see just turn it around your epistle that has been written cuz you can't add nothing to it that's read of all men manifested God word word of God in other words a amen so brother Bram had the right kind of perspective amen with the amount of Revelation with everything that happened in his ministry and and the seals and the Thunders amen he wouldn't add nothing to the book amen because he knew that everything that God wanted to tell us is included in the book amen it is included in the written Epistles amen you are written Epistles amen everything that God wanted to tell us he included in his Epistles written Epistles read of all men amen they are written they're they are not being written amen they are written already praise the Lord amen so there is nothing that you can add to it or subtract from it amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah you know that was a nice idea you know if somebody comes and he appreciates the ministry and everything and he wants to lift you up but but you know you need to know where you stand amen it is not a further Revelation that's off the book that's that's a part two of the book amen it is within the book amen and you are not just a a a a good quote that's right amen you're not just a good leaflet amen a good summary something short a onepage review of the word amen you are the word amen amen you are that book you you don't have to add anything you don't have to subtract anything from it amen it's just a perfect word amen you're not an addition to the book you're not an addition to the word you are the word amen amen but then on the other hand you know we as people we we like to be humble amen because the religion told us to be humble amen if you want to be a Christian if you want to be a servant of God if you want to be a child of God you need to be humble amen and and and what people do being humble they disagree with the word amen they say okay that's a wonderful quote but yet let's balance it out let's say you know I'm so sinful and I do mistakes and so on Amen but the word expects you to be humble and accept the word of God that's how you are humble amen praise the Lord that's how Mary was humble amen she said amen to the word of the Angel amen she didn't reason with it amen praise the Lord you know Zachariah in when when the angel came to him you know he reasoned with the word maybe he tried because he was religious right he was brought up in the religion of the day he tried to be humble he tried to you know he he didn't say well yeah thank you let's do it he wanted to he wanted to be polite to the angel and he wanted to strike a conversation with the angel and give a a a sense of humility that you know I'm not worthy but if you explain it to me maybe maybe you'll convince me that it's that way amen the angel didn't play games with him amen he expected humility but not the the human kind of humility that's right amen today your human and my human humility won't stand before the Lord that's not a good thing on your resume amen if you want anything on your resume it should be the humility of the Lord that's right which would be when you hear the word that has been spoken you say Amen Lord amen you do not reason you don't fall back on your experience you do not fall back on on what you've read because there are so many good quotes there there are so many good scriptures and you know your your religious mind your carnal mind will try to form a nice response that's right yes but on the other hand you know and all these filler words amen God doesn't use filler words amen he's sure of his word amen if he said says it's like that it's like that he doesn't have to make it nice and polite and then anything why because he is not hunting for people that are religious that like this sort of language you know that like being convinced to the truth amen and and that somebody would talk them into it amen the word comes for its own that's right meaning that when he comes and speaks the word amen he is sure and he is positive that there is a response based on the word amen not some religious response not not a a a big thank you letter to the word of the Lord but saying amen that's enough praise the Lord amen so being humble is accepting the will of the Lord for your life that's right amen the word of the Lord praise the Lord being humble is being subject right amen when Mary said yes to the word of the Lord it wasn't boastful it wasn't well I was expecting that no she didn't expect it but when the angel came and and spoke to her something said yes in her heart and she just she she didn't have reservations to speak it out amen when there was the word of the Lord when there was the encounter that even the deacons of bar branam would question a little bit or or they were not sure about it about the squirrels being uh being created they're in the house of sister hatti amen they had reservations because they they've been brought up maybe religiously as all of us have been or most of us have been amen when many times we come to church we are just you know we accept the word we accept the message but what we accept is that intellectual Faith which is religious Faith amen it is a faith that that you know that will try to be humble that will put up a mask you know of a good Christian a good message believer amen because we have you know we we we have like an image of what a a good message believer should look like amen and being humble is on the list yeah amen it's in top three priorities amen but when the word comes don't be too humble and reason with the word amen if it strikes a cord in your heart if it strikes the right kind of frequency amen just let it out amen sister heide just let it out amen she said amen there's nothing but the truth amen she wasn't very Bal she she wasn't very a an outspoken woman she she didn't give a a huge spe and then you know rebuking the deacons for not believing that amen she didn't do it that was just very very simple very subtle very quiet she would say there nothing but the truth amen praise the Lord so being humble is to be subject amen and being subject means to be a wife of the Lamb amen you're subject to the lamb praise the Lord hallelujah you're not reasoning with the lamb amen you are not dominating the lamb you're subject to the lamb praise the Lord amen so topic for this morning amen pick up your pen and write amen and we've been dealing with the will of the Lord lo I come because I've read of myself I've seen myself in the volumes of the book that's why I come to do thy will oh God Amen and you know and I was looking recently at the definition of the will you know when there's a a will written amen and that really blessed me I I'll read you the definition or the description of the will when it comes to drafting the last will there are no concessions when it comes to two conditions a handwritten will in order to be valid must be entirely written in handwriting for it is difficult to falsify the handwriting and the other concession is it has to be signed if in drawing up such a will for example one forgets to sign it or writes it down in whole or in part on a typewriter or on a computer or signs a will written in whole or in part by another person's hand it will be completely invalid and will not have the intended effect amen that's the natural will amen but I really like the fact that it has to be done in handwriting amen not partly in handwriting amen entirely in handwriting amen it has to be handwritten and signed amen you know and the writer of the will it cannot be just anybody amen it cannot be somebody else amen it it has to be the E exact same person amen it has to be the exact same handwriting the will from the beginning to the end amen praise the Lord and brother Brown tells us in the perian church age he says one night as I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as I grasp the pent toite his Spirit gave me a message for the church I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride amen praise the Lord so the Lord he he he he he he came to BR rown and he told me pick up your pen and write I need a handwritten letter to my bride amen I need to State my will for the bride amen pick up your pen and write and you know that's that's a lengthy letter and I encourage you to read it when you get back home but that was his will recording the bride amen he said that she will reach the headstone amen he said that she will be a super Church in other words my will for the bride is that she be a super race that she be so similar that she will be in His image that they together the bridegroom and the bride they will be one amen she will manifest the word of the Living God Amen she will love him amen that's written down in the will of God Amen she will have his potential amen and then later on he says also paman Church age he says those in the bride do only his will no one can make them to do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or keep still amen there's an option amen it's not just that sayth the lord it's also to keep still and be comfortable with that amen they know that it has to be God in them doing the works amen we've read it through Paul our sufficiency our ability is from God Amen fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride amen she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which is left for this specific time amen praise the Lord Lord pick up your pen and write amen hand write my will hallelujah amen praise the Lord the bride she is the new book amen she is the living epistle amen she is she like like we've read from the prophet you cannot add or subtract from it amen that is a perfect living epistle amen she is the Fulfillment of the will of the father amen and it is the Father's will amen that's right it's not our will that's right that's the father's will but it has to be written in handwriting there has to be a hand amen and brother Ram tells us that God in our day and age he doesn't have any other hand but yours he doesn't have any other feet but yours he doesn't have any other eyes or ears or any members of the body but yours amen that's why the prophet for this age Who was the the first fruit amen he was the the example for our day he got a voice there was a voice that came to him and told him pick up your pen and write amen it wasn't it it wasn't uh like in the Old Testament that God would hand down the tables of stone to Moses they were already already written but there was a human being now on Earth that had to pick up his pen amen it wasn't a a Heavenly pen it wasn't a Heavenly hand it was an Earthly hand an Earthly pen an Earthly piece of paper but the will of God Amen praise the lord we remember Jesus in The Garden of of Gethsemane amen he said not my will but yours be done which is very profound and I I I I really like it because that that just tells us that Jesus had his own will Jesus had his own idea Jesus had his own perspective amen not a carnal not a sinful perspective not a carnal idea not well I'm going to the world or I'm going to do or I'm going to join the Pharisees and the Sadducees he was the word he knew the word amen he looked in the volumes of the book that's why he came amen that's why he came and he wanted to do the will but you know he he he was the scriptures you know he he read all of these scriptures and maybe I presume that he had another idea a of how to achieve the same goal but in a different way if he didn't have his own will why would he say that amen why would he struggle what why would he content to the point that his perspiration turned into blood amen that was the greatest battle ever fought amen that it it wasn't a physical combat amen he wasn't struggling physically but he was struggling in his mind amen that was the greatest battle ever fought praise the Lord amen that speaks of our day and age B tells us that the the age that we live in we are in the midst of the battle that the greatest battle that's ever been fought why why because there there is this contention amen between our own will and the will of the father amen like in the Garden of Gethsemane uh it was the greatest victory that was achieved not on the cross of Calvary that was a consequence of that victory amen but he had to fight himself he had to he had to uh acknowledge the will of the father and esteem it higher than his own amen and I believe that his own will was quite good probably as Jesus of Galilee he thought that his will would be better you know many times we stress so much the the godhead of of of Jesus and how he was God you know he was not only human but he was God but for us knowing that we also should stress the opposite side amen because he he was also he was God made flesh amen that was a different body than ours amen that's for sure but he also learned obedience by what he suffered amen amen he was growing in Statue yeah amen and favor yes amen that's right when it comes to man and God Amen so he was growing he he was tired and you know and and and and then he had his own will right amen if that was just God you know without the the the the the human part the fleshly part what could we do how could we ever achieve anything how could we think of ourselves as something more than just mere flesh amen but we see our example amen we see Jesus Christ who was fighting until the point of death between his own will and the will of the father amen but what made him Victorious was that he acknowledged the will of the father over his own amen many times we come up with a very good idea a very very scriptural a very quote-based a very message likee answer to our problems or answerers to the challenges of today amen but then we need to recognize that maybe that's just our own will amen and we need to lay it as sacrifice amen that's the ultimate sacrifice something that we've been working for something that we've thought of that something the best that we've we've brought up amen but we need to still lay it on the on the base of the Altar and just slay it amen and just acknowledge and glorify the will of the father amen praise the Lord Hallelujah so the father couldn't force him to do anything that's right amen God will not force you to do anything right that's very far from how God runs his plans amen true he put men in the Garden of Eden on the basis of free Mor moral agency amen he could choose amen God was prepared for anything amen but then because he knew amen because he fornew because he predestinated you he knew there was something in you he knew the power that he placed on the inside amen he knew that there would be a certain frequency that when he calls you will answer according to the same frequency amen praise the Lord and that will give you the power to withstand amen that will give you the power to sacrifice your own achievements your own experience your own position your own will amen your own Ministry or whatever amen bam says whatever Ministry needs to be ruined if my Ministry needs to be ruined let it be ruined amen if my will everything that I've been working for needs to be ruined let it be ruined amen because it's it's nothing amen comparing to the will of the Lord amen to the will of the father so Jesus was not forced to go to the Cross amen that was his decision yeah amen he did it amen he took that pen and he wrote on that piece of paper amen praise the Lord he wrote the will of the father he didn't write his own will amen we are not writing our own will friends amen Lord the word tells us pick up your pen and write Hallelujah but he knows already what you're going to write amen that you are going to write the will of the father for your life amen you're not going to write your own will hallelujah praise the Lord why because you know that is already written of you amen it is written in the volumes of the book that's why you cannot add you you're not writing another another book another Bible another section a followup nothing else like that but you understand also that you are living Epistles written and read of all men amen amen nothing can be added or taken away isn't that wonderful amen because that's not your will if that was your will that you would have to scribble all over it you would have to cross out a sections and write different sections and and use all sorts of colors and then throw it away then write a new one amen but once you re you write the will of the father it is final amen It's the final word of the Lord but many times it is uh is a struggle amen it will be a struggle it is a struggle for me it will be a struggle for you it was a struggle for Jesus Christ in the god Garden of Gethsemane it won't be as easy you know oh give me a piece of paper I'll write it no it takes it it took years it took the entire Ministry of Jesus Christ here on Earth to be able to finally sacrifice his own will yeah do you think will be any different amen I believe that we are here still for a purpose because we we still keep writing our own Wills amen good Wills message Wills amen logical Wills amen everything everything is nice and smooth and we've scribbled all over it we've come up with the best of the best amen we came with our own fruits of our labor amen but then we need to sacrifice it at the foot of the of the altar amen and agree with the will of the father praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord it must be your writing it must be your will amen you have to acknowledge amen you you need to have the desire God will not force you to write anything amen praise the Lord amen you know the reward comes the reward came for the prophet to the prophet you know the the great victory in love divine amen the voice said because that was your decision yeah it wasn't forced because you've chosen this narrow path yes and because of your own choosing amen there is a tremendous Victory awaiting for you amen tremendous victory in love Divine Praise the Lord amen and that victory that reward is for you amen it it was for Jesus Christ amen it was for brother brandham when they they would sacrifice their own will and write the will of the father amen there is a reward for you amen if you disre guard your own flesh your fleshly desires your religious desires whatever your desires are whatever your will is for your life amen just seek the will of the father amen and write it down praise the Lord hallelujah let's stand to our feet amen I'm so thankful you know when Esther she became Queen amen the king told her write what you think is best yes write it down and sign it amen that will be my will it will be in handwriting it will be signed amen these are the two concessions that need to happen for the will amen but what what he knew that what Esther would all right she he didn't tell her write this write that sign it this way he had the confidence amen because they were one amen Esther and the King they were one amen amen so that's why whatever she wrote she knew my sufficiency my ability is from the King amen it's not my kingdom amen I'm not hijacking the rulership of the king I'm not I I'm not uh having a spirit of rebellion amen cuz that's how people they want Power amen people want Power today if they get the chance they want to write something something new something extra something uh that seems wonderful but we need to sacrifice amen our will and choose the father's will praise the Lord BR Brown tells us that power without character is satanic right it is devil like yeah amen but you know if you have the character of Christ if you have the nature if you're partakers with him in his divine nature amen and everything is different praise the Lord amen then you can escape corruption amen amen then your body can be changed amen because you are partakers of this divine nature H Allelujah praise the Lord so this morning everybody I believe that we are here we have our own will we have our own idea but you've been given this pen amen you have a hand of Faith amen so this is the time to override your own way will amen and write the will of the father amen fulfill the the the will of the father for your life for this time for this specific time as the prophet said praise the Lord let's bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we just love you we appreciate you Lord for who you are Lord not what you have given us Lord but who you are Lord we are not like the world seeking your hand father seeking what you're going to give us or how you're going to bless us but we have a different kind of relationship with you father and we are so so thankful that you came down lord you uh you revealed your presence to us Lord and we can just immerse ourselves in that presence Lord find our peace our satisfaction

the word has been restored Lord may we just during this greatest battle that has ever been fought may we just seek the will of the father may we seek your will father may we be in such a communication
