to leave amen [Music] so there is a lighter on a hillside [Music] that overlooks life's sea and when my soul is tossed then i send out a light so that i might see and the light that shines in the darkness now say it release me home if it wasn't for the lighthouse this ship would be no more [Music] and i thank god for [Music] i owe my life to him jesus is a lighter he keeps me from the rocks of

light [Music] tell me where [Music] thank you jesus [Music] to be my heart glory praise god let's go ahead and stand and go to first peter chapter four we'll start there i'd like for a subject for a title i'd like to just take uh preparing for the golden age and just along the lines of what we've been talking about for the last several weeks god is still stirring in my hearts and things along these lines and i'd like to look at the life of solomon and solomon coming into power and it's just interesting we've talked and touched on these things before but i can't get away from it my attention keeps getting drawn back here so we'll see what the lord has for us today first peter 4 17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god i mean let's pray lord jesus we thank you for this day and for your goodness to us lord we thank you god that you've extended such mercy and grace in our lives to bring us here that we might feed on your word lord the word of life lord the word of this hour that we might know you as you are lord as you reveal yourself to us lord i pray that you would take us a little higher today lord that we might see you more clearly god that we might see ourselves more clearly as well and we might follow after you with all of our heart i pray you would accomplish your great purpose in our lives we ask that you would do it this this morning that you would carry us from here to whatever purpose you have for us as individuals in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seats and when you sit down let's turn to first chronicles and we're going to read quite a few scriptures so keep your bibles handy i want to look at this story as this story unfolds through the scripture and following solomon coming to the throne and we know that david was a great king and then david was god's choice to be king we know saul was the choice of the people or what god had chose to fulfill the desire of the people what they wanted in a king a great man a warrior a man that was head and shoulders but when god chose a king he he was looking for character not size he was looking for character not ability so he chose david who was a man after his own heart and so you follow the life of david and we see that david you know routed the enemies david was a great warrior he led israel in many battles and destroyed destroyed all of the the enemies the philistines all of the canaanite enemies that were there and he brought a a relative peace to the kingdom by the end of his life amen but god god had another thing to do to move israel to the golden age there was another step and in that step it was going to be a transition from david to solomon and brother bam tells us in many places that solomon is a type of christ and solomon is a type of christ moving into that position moves them into a golden age and i would like to look at how he does that because it's very interesting let's look at the first chronicles 22 and verse 7. and yeah first chronicles 22-7 and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build a house into the name of the lord my god but the word of the lord came to me saying thou has shed blood abundantly and has made great wars thou shalt not build a house unto my name because thou has shed much blood upon the earth in my sight behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be solomon which means peace name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days he shall build a house for my name and he shall be my son and i will be his father i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel forever now my son the lord be with thee and prosper thou and build the house of the lord thy god as he has said of thee only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee charge concerning israel that thou mayest keep the law of the lord thy god so we see so david now is passing on uh the word to his his instructions to solomon and solomon's coming into the kingdom and he reversed to him to a prophecy a word from the lord that word the lord gave to david concerning solomon said he'll be a man of rest and he'll be at rest all about so now israel's going to move to the golden age they're going to move into the rest which is a type of our holy ghost amen moving into the rest holy ghost baptism and he said now now he's going to be a man of rest and he's the son of david he's the prince of peace and in here he says he'll be a son to me and i'll be his father so he's the son of god so he's a he's a perfect type of jesus christ here early in his ministry so when we look at this we're we're looking at a type or a foreshadow of christ and what christ will do and so brother brother bam says in the message the queen of the south god raised solomon up as a type of christ the son of david and gave him a gift and he says then all the nation rallied around that gift and they began to prosper because they rallied around the gift and they supported the gift amen that god had sent and they yielded themselves to that gift and god established them in peace amen let's turn over to first kings chapter 3 and start reading from there first kings chapter 3 and verse 5. we went through this a a a while back a few weeks ago i don't remember how long but let's read through this again first kings three and five in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night and god said ask what i shall give thee and solomon said thou has showed unto thy servant david my father great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and an uprightness of heart with thee and thou has kept for him this great kindness that thou has given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day and now o lord my god thou has made thy servant king instead of david my father and i am but a little child i know not how to go out or come in and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou has chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people and the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing and god said unto him because thou has asked this thing and has not asked for thyself long life neither has asked riches for thyself nor has to ask the life of thine enemies but has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment behold i have done according to thy words so i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none likely before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee so we read this before but god was pleased at solomon because solomon when he had an opportunity to get anything he wanted god says you know what shall i give thee and he says i'm but a little child and solomon was able to humble himself before god amen because jesus christ would only do what the father showed him jesus was able to humble himself under the father and solomon now humbles himself and says hey this is a great people this is a mighty people and i'm but a little child i can't lead this people i need understanding i need wisdom and god was pleased what solomon asked for and says i'll give you an understanding heart you'll be wise there'll be none like you none like you before there'll be none like you after amen and i'll give you the things that you didn't ask for riches and wealth and if you'll follow me long life so we know solomon solomon was god's choice amen others thought that they were right absalom thought that he was he would have been the right one and he by himself made himself the choice and maybe the people's choice maybe the people thought absalom would have been the choice but solomon was god's choice because god is always expressed in humility because the way up is always the way down and solomon didn't have the nicest birth he didn't come the nicest way there was a there was controversy in in his past in his in his with his parents but yet god brought solomon in such a way that god could bestow upon him wisdom because he approached humbly he asked for the right thing and god is now trying to establish israel now jerusalem uh brother branham says the the church natural types the church spiritual so when we look back at here we're not just trying to learn something about the nation of israel and the jews we're trying to see something about us about the church and the journey we've been on and jerusalem is a is a type of the church brother branham said the headquarters of the church the headquarters of the the religion amen is in jerusalem so jerusalem is a type of the church and and israel's a type of the church so when we look at this we want to we want to glean from this for ourselves uh the scripture says that the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom the fear of the lord to just obey to keep his commandments to obey the lord is the beginning of wisdom amen not to be so wise that we we come up with our own idea and make our own choices and go our own way and use our own reasoning amen that's not the beginning of wisdom amen sometimes we think wisdom is knowing a lot and wisdom is not an abundance of knowledge amen wisdom is the ability to discern right and wrong and apply the word in the right way you know jesus was wise amen but the pharisees and the sadducees the religious leaders they had knowledge of the word and they come to jesus and start asking jesus questions and it proved the wisdom that was in jesus because jesus could properly place the word they couldn't properly place the word they began to ask him you know they asked him questions like tribute money should be given to caesar we give unto god trying to trap him always trying to stumble him amen by the word but jesus has wisdom not just knowledge and he says bring me the tribute money and he looks upon it and says who inscription is that they said caesar so give to caesar what caesars and give to god what's god's now they have nothing to say they come and they bring to him a woman caught in the very act of adultery and they say she's caught in the very act of adultery amen and they they did this tempting him to test him to have an accusation against him so i don't know if they were hoping that he would let her go and they say he doesn't keep the law or he would condemn her to death i don't know what they were looking for but they were looking for in a way to accuse him amen and they were trying to use the word to trap the word and he was the word how are you going to use the word to trap the word amen jesus now he he just he doesn't say anything he just bends down and starts riding amen in the sand and i've said many times i would love to have a picture of what he wrote in the sand and know what it was that he wrote because whatever it was he wrote amen it was something discernible to the people who were there because it was he didn't say anything you know he began to write amen he gets up and he says you who are without sin cast the first stone and he goes back and starts writing again i mean i don't believe it was just the statement if you're without sin that caused him to walk away i think it was the statement in conjunction with what was written in the sand loved to know what it was because it was a setup we've talked about this before we all know it was a set up because here you have a woman caught in the very act of adultery if she's caught in the very act of adultery there was a man there too and where is the man where did they bring the man because it was all the setup and jesus could see through it amen because they had not the love of god they only had a love for self and they were coming against jesus because jesus was a threat to their religion and this is this is really what i i want to talk about today is is is the pharisees and sadducees i don't want to lump them all together but the ones that jesus had discourse with so often they did not love the word because the word was made manifest standing before them and they didn't love it but they loved amen they loved the rhema or the written word and the position that that word put them in they loved their religion they didn't love god and so now jesus is they're trying to trap him with the word amen because they love the religion they don't love god if they knew god they would be looking at the picture differently than what they're looking at and so now jesus uh he he writes in the sand he tells him you're without sin cast the first stone amen and whatever it was he wrote and whatever way he handled it he handled it perfectly by wisdom amen because solomon was just a forerunner amen a foreshadow of jesus christ the wisdom that was in solomon was in jesus christ and they all leave and then he looks at the woman he said woman where are thine accusers and she says i have none and he says neither do i accuse you go and sin no more amen see jesus never left the word in judgment and discernment it wasn't an issue of intellect of reasoning and he just never left the word he knew that they were off the word because if that woman was caught in the act they're already off the word by not bringing the man so he knows something's wrong here because they've already left the word you realize so many people want to come and bring a portion of the word to try to bring a condemnation or try to change your opinion or get you to think differently or change a decision you make but they leave out a whole nother portion of the word and they just bring the portion that they want you to see to try to persuade you their way and it's like it's negligent sometimes in the rest of the word that's left out and you realize there's something fishy here amen they want me to keep the word but they haven't kept the word they caught on the very act they brought a woman with no man right off the bat amen their motive is impure because they don't love god they don't want to keep his word they want to keep their religious order going and they don't want to be threatened by this prophet from galilee amen who's shaking up their whole system praise be to god remember spirits don't die nothing changes only the people everything else stays the same amen and jesus is here and he says woman where are their accusers because nobody can be put to death without the witness of two or three 2 or 3 so jesus gets rid of the witnesses because he's not going to leave the word he knows they're off the word but their being off the word will not make him get off the word he knows it's a setup he knows it's the trap but he's not going to leave the word amen just because he knows they're off the word and so he says woman where their accusers he says she says i have none he says neither do i accuse you amen because you have to be an eyewitness jesus wasn't there but he knows she's guilty because he says go and sin no more what a statement to make amen jesus knows that she's guilty amen but by the law by the law he cannot condemn her to death so he sets her free why because he stayed with the word you see so many times when we face situations and we come into obstacles amen we have a difficulty sometimes discerning what to do but discernment is always by the word friends discernment is by the word god has given us his word we have it in written form amen we have it translated in our language and god sent a prophet in this day so that we have the perfect interpretation of the word but so many times we want to mix in some reasoning because we don't know how the word applies to this situation and we don't know what to do in these circumstances and we face these issues we face issues that we really don't find the exact scripture to plug and play i don't know what to do and i would say in those times it's time to wait don't get ahead of god but just wait wait for god to bring his word on the scene wait for god to bring clarity out of the scriptures and then move forward by the scriptures because that's where our discernment comes from from the word praise god so we see that jesus was also displaying to us the wisdom that was in solomon and solomon amen as a son of david as the son of god as the prince of peace was foreshadowing jesus christ i'm going to read to you out of luke 11 stay in chronicles and kings because we're going to go right back here but he says jesus says in luke 11 31 the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here brother branham made this statement over and over he preached the message on the queen of the south the queen of sheba greater than solomon i mean he's got all kinds of titles and he's trying to get us to see that there's a man here that can turn on the light that there's a greater than solomon what was there amen was in jesus day what was in jesus day is in our day amen and brother branham wasn't talking about himself friends when he said the greater than the psalmist is here he wasn't talking about himself i mean he was talking about the one that was there working through him and if there was a greater than solomon there amen that day when brother brennan was there discerning there's still a greater than solomon here today that is able to discern our situations amen let's look at this in second chronicles second chronicles chapter nine second chronicles nine and verse 1. and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she came to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem with a very great company and camels that bear spices and and gold and abundance and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she commended she communed with him of all that was in her heart and solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing hid from solomon which he told her not and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon in the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the setting of his servants and the attendants of his ministers and their apparel his cup bears also in their apparel and his ascent by which he went up to the house of the lord and there was no more spirit in her and she said to the king it was a true report which i heard in my own land of my thine acts and of thy wisdom howbeit i believe not their words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom has not told me for thou thou exceedeth the fame that i heard happier thy men and happier these thy servants which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne to be king for the lord thy god because thy god loved israel to establish them forever therefore made he the king over them to do judgment and justice so she recognized what was there she heard it she didn't believe it she traveled to it and she saw the wisdom of solomon to answer all of her hard questions she had hard questions and sometimes i wonder what her questions might have been so many times you know we tried to surmise you know it might have been you know how did the earth get here and in its orbit and the bible said that he spoke of birds and insects and all kinds of stuff but i wonder if she didn't wonder maybe maybe her questions this is just me maybe your questions were about the original sin and how we got in this state that we're in and and why is the world and the way it's in and why is there death and murder and why why is god a good god and why are we a fallen people and why are there so many religious ideas out there and why so many churches and i mean these are hard questions amen what happened amen and what happened to the original earth that was under the waters and and what what happened in heaven with lucifer what happened with all these things these are hard questions who can answer them who can go back and and tell us that there was war in heaven before the foundational world who can go back and tell us amen that there was something on earth before it was covered in water in genesis 1 2. who can tell us amen how god amen cast the stars in heaven who told us who could tell us where he wrote his first bible who can tell us where he wrote a second bible who can answer these hard questions amen for this gentile woman that has come amen to see solomon amen it's the wisdom of solomon amen to take what's in the mind of god amen and break it to the people i say there's a greater than solomon that's still here they can tell us why we're here why we're in this condition where we came from where we're going to amen and how to travel the road now greater than solomon is here and i'll tell you if you really if you really study the message you come across things brother benham said it is absolutely astonishing because it says solomon spoke of birds and trees and insects and all these other stuff and brother branham does the exact same thing he tells us amen about the animals knowing about an earthquake he tells us amen that that that sometimes a woman she can't conceive just because she's all nervous and worried about it but if she'll adopt a child or something like that watch she'll get pregnant again amen the same thing science has proven who even say a woman has trouble getting pregnant there's something in her blood and they found that to be true he'll talk about a cancer and how it gets started and they find it to be true where did this wisdom come from not from the sev not from the seven years or eight years he had in grammar school that he didn't complete amen because there's a greater than solomon that's here and he's still here so you know all those little things that brother branham would tell us amen and how things work in the world and how they used to be and how the the earth got knocked off its axis and it began to cool and condense the the the the uh moisture that was in the air and began to rain and cause a flood when it knocked over the water sloshed out from underneath and broke open the fountains of the deep and that's how you have noah's flood oh praise god we should get really excited i don't need to go back to solomon's day amen i don't need to go back to another day because there's a greater in solomon here today so that we would we would know that we would know what condition we're supposed to be and we would know how to be pleasing to the lord that the wisdom would be given to us through the message now wisdom that's given to us amen come to to rightly divide the word of god amen and give us the correct interpretation of scripture so it could be placed correctly for us so we could take that wisdom and we can discern by the word and the message shalom brother baby says no wonder he said the queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with her generation and condemned this one because she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here how that little queen weighed down he then saw that light and came from miles through the desert three months on a camel's back to hear the wisdom of solomon and them standing right there with solomon being a type a figure of him he says as you're in the message is your life worthy of the gospel do like the queen of the south did she came took her three months to get to where a man was representing jesus christ or the god of heaven solomon jesus said she come from the uttermost parts of the world to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here and we know that greater than solomon is here the great holy spirit himself is here working through the people so greater than solomon is here who's that the great holy spirit himself is here working through the people and the masterpiece he said notice here the life that was in the husk in the stalk and the tassel in the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stall when one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself so he brother bam's talking about something different amen than just the restoration of the gifts under the baptism of the holy ghost and the pentecostal age but he's saying that made a way amen justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism the holy ghost and the restoration of the gifts but that dispensation made a way for what the holy ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again you see you see one thing builds on top of another on top another one thing rolls into another and rolls into another and when justification made a way for sanctification sanctification didn't do away with justification it came with it sanctification moved into the restoration of the gifts under the baptism the holy ghost amen and then you didn't lose sanctification you didn't lose justification they rolled into it and now in this dispensation we didn't lose the gifts under the baptism the holy ghost we didn't lose any of those things they rolled right into it but one was building building building until it comes right back to the original grain which is the word not a certain emotion not a certain dynamic thing but back to the original word again to manifest itself that's why brother says in the fourth seal it says as the natural wine reveals itself in a stimulation power so does the new wine as it reveals the word of god which is spirit the word of god which is spirit see the word itself is spirit you believe that let's read it let's see who said it and then we'll know whether it's truth or not saint john the sixth chapter and the 60 or 63rd verse it's the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet and nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are alive the word itself is spirit it's spirit and word form and then you see when it's quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts so now we've come through you know what luther's age wesley's age pentecostal wave to come back to the word of gin and if you have the word amen we have the wisdom of god we have amen i would say we have discernment between right and wrong that's what that's what solomon asked for that's what god gave him amen but we see discernment by the word and the message the feast of trumpets says the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost two thousand years but is to be loosed in the evening time the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again we've talked about this many times but i'm going to labor on it still i thought the holy ghost was already in the church i thought the holy ghost was moving all through the church through the church it was in measure and in portion it was always the holy ghost through the church so what is brother branham talking about let's read it again so we don't miss it he said the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2 000 years so it wasn't that the holy ghost wasn't in the church through the church ages but it was bound it was bound in the churches it was limited in the churches amen it was resisted it could not have full expression or full range of motion but it was bound why what what denominational rivers by creeds and dogmas and reasonings and man's understandings and schools of thought was what was it doing binding the holy spirit so the holy spirit wasn't loosed oh my goodness it wasn't loosed under the pentecostal dispensation under the pentecostal dispensation the holy ghost was still bound [Music] amen i would say it was more loosed yes just like when you moved from luther to wesley it was more loose from wesley amen to pentecost it was more loose brother man said they had more he said he said wesley i had more than what luther had the pentecost had more than what wesley had it was more loose but still bound so we have a holy ghost that's bound amen and the holy ghost is the one that's the greater than solomon still bound but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said he promised it there was three stages of it as i said the martyr's age of the martyr's age 4 then the stage of the reformers and now the calling out time he said there's three stages for this holy ghost being loosed and coming back in amen it was through the it was through the martyr's time amen when they would give their lives as the first church age on through the dark ages it was the martyr's age amen then it was the time of the reformers and that goes all the way through the pentecostal age in laodicea amen the pentecostal revival was the last stage of the reformation but that was not the calling out time the calling out time comes after that because that takes place in the church ages that takes place in laodicea but god has called us out of laodicea and he's called us out of the church ages amen they call us out to meet with him amen a holy ghost that is unbound by denominational rivers and you can't have a holy ghost unbound by denominational rivers if you're still down in the apostasy and darkness and blackness of laodicea christ has been put on the outside in the laodicean h on the outside of the church amen and he showed it in the heavens with an eclipse of the moon where there's not a seventh picture because it's a total blackout an absolute apostasy christ put outside of his church see man destroys himself amen man man was the one who put christ out christ came like he said he would come he come like he said he would come according to all the old testament prophecies he's standing in jerusalem in the midst of his church and they put him out and crucified him and he suffered without the camp and so now you can't stay in that old system anymore now you've got to go wherever he went because he's the head the body always follows the head praise be to god where the head goes the body goes and christ is the headship the word is the headship amen and when the word come in fullness through the message of the hour amen the word was rejected which was jesus christ he come exactly like he was supposed to come at the end of time at the end of the ages and it was exactly what happened amen in revelation chapter 3 behold i stand at the door and knock he's on the outside of his church knocking trying to get somebody to come out to him and he's put outside the church amen now laodicea goes into absolute total apostasy there's no light there if there's no light there and christ has left the church christ is on the outside and then he suffered beyond the camp now brother brahma said going beyond the camp let us go out to him beyond the camp amen beyond the old order of jerusalem let's leave and let's go let the body follow the head if the headship's been put out the body has to leave too why because if you stay there the holy ghost is bound but a greater than solomon is here but he's not in the system he's not in the denomination he is his word he has come as the full revelation in the full measure of the full word and if we don't get the word we don't get him i don't know how else to say it this is what the prophet taught us many people think they have him because they have they have uh uh they have uh uh some sort of an emotional experience or they have something that that took place brother ben said to shaking or speaking in tongues or at dancing and they think they have him but what they got was a result of coming in contact with him those things are all true and they're genuine and real but to have him to embrace him to become one with him you have to receive the word and not portions of it that was the church ages that's not for us now this is the bride day this isn't a portion day this is a fullness day we receive the fullness of the word we may not understand the fullness of the word but we receive the fullness of the word we may not we may not be able to intellectually explain it but hey we don't explain it away and we don't put it away we just take it all in amen if the prophet taught it if it's part of the message i want it all and i'm going to receive it all amen even the hard sayings so now a greater than solomon is here but it's the unbound holy ghost and how do you come in contact with the greater than solomon that's here is you have to come to the unbound holy ghost and the the word is the spirit the words that i speak to they are spirit and they are alive amen when the word was restored the holy ghost was unbound right it's what he said but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message what was the evening time message it was the third pool the sword in the hand the revelation of the seven thunders the opening of the seals the seventh seal unveiled that was the evening time message not the healing campaigns that was the that was the bait on the hook that was the lure amen but it was the word the opening of the word the restoring of all the truths that were lost amen the revelation of the seven mysterious thunders that were unknown in the book of revelation that is the message amen and that brings the holy ghost unbound when that when that when those seals were loose the holy ghost was unbound and a greater than solomon is here and that is the wisdom that's been given to us to discern right and wrong by what by the message by the word that's been restored so we've got to throw away our thinking we've got to throw away traditions we've got to be able to revisit everything with the message and i don't mean revisit one time i mean revisit and revisit and revisit and revisit amen because the mighty god is still unveiling himself through this message he is still making the word more clear he is still crystallizing things that he spoke 50 60 years ago are still crystallizing to us today it's still becoming clearer amen and greater manifestation and it's going deeper than we ever thought it would go so we got to keep revisiting these ideas and revisiting amen and there's nothing wrong with revisiting because a lot of times when you revisit this you'd find out that's absolutely what he said that's exactly what the word says and i've just re-encouraged myself in the same revelation it's not changing understanding all the time it's not like i've got to oh if i'm not changing my understanding of the message every few weeks and i'm not growing that's not it at all folks some things that have been correct have been correct all the way through you got a revelation early on and it never has to change but don't think god can't take that revelation another layer deeper and it's the same thing you've believed the same thing you've known to be true all along but now another layer unpeels and now you see it in places in the bible you didn't see it before now what you saw here you see from genesis to revelation it's not a new revelation it's not something different amen it's just god unlocking more of his mystery through the same truth and when it does these things become clear and it gives us more wisdom more wisdom with a greater understanding of the word more wisdom to discern right and wrong praise god now after the reformers the stage of the reformers which in the i i want to be clear the last part of the reformation was the pentecostal revival now brother bam said the pentecostal age was the laodicean church age so we got to be real clear on that so we know where we're at and that was the finishing of the reformation now it's the calling out time calling what calling the bride out of the city which is the church to meet him outside the city or outside the camp that's what the bridegroom call came to do the midnight cry the friend of the bridegroom amen the eliezer call comes to call us out of the church systems out of our religion and go and meet him we're outside the camp outside of laodicea praise god let's turn to hebrews chapter four hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12. for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joint and the morrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do this is a really big verse these two verses because in in saying what i'm going to say i don't intend to take away from a gift of discernment like brother branham when he would discern something and god was showing something people's lives but i want to show how we've received the gift of discernment as a body of believers we received the gift of discernment amen because we received the word and it said for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword the word of god piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and the joints in a morrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the hearts so watch the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart what will come in and separate you from you the spirit from the soul and the bone if you're gonna if you're gonna if you're gonna separate the bone in the morrow you're separating part of you from part of you and that's pretty close cutting if you just look at it and because you know the morrow's like totally encased in the bone so we're going to divide that out that's some pretty delicate work and the word of god is this is able to do this is able to get down to the nitty-gritty and get down so close to the inside of the inside which would be your morrow your bones are inside and inside your bones or your morrow so the sword can get to the inside of the inside and can separate those two things just like the spirit and the soul amen it can come down and separate you from you amen the hybrid you the false you from the real you which is the soul because sometimes sometimes uh we we sometimes we make decisions in the wrong realm sometimes we take action and we do things in the spirit realm and you know influenced by the old nature amen and it's us right that's us but then sometimes god speaks to us through the word out of our soul and what's that that's us that's the real us but what is going to separate us from us the word the word is the separator the word is the one that comes and it says here in verse 13 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him which with whom we have to do he is the word amen and the spirit is the spirit of the word amen and the word has been given to us today to do what to discern and to separate us from us because your greatest enemy is who it's me the guy i look at in the mirror that's my enemy who's going to save me from my enemy who's going to save me from the closest deception that i've ever been deceived by and that's the devil using my old nature to bit my own voice in my own head to get me to leave the word can you think of a closer deception than that friends it's not the devil whispering in your ear amen it's that old nature amen using your voice in your head to get you to leave the word i know of no greater deception amen what can save me from myself the word the word that's been given to us can save me from myself this word that has been restored in this hour can separate me from me separate the old man from the new man amen separate the old creature amen that was born in sin and shape and iniquity and come through hybridization from the new creature that's born again from the soul praise god that's why we needed this word amen we couldn't do this without a restoration of the word we couldn't achieve to the place he wants us to come amen we couldn't unite with our husband because our husband was bound that's right the word was bound by the nomination of the rivers the holy ghost was bound by these denominational rivers we were separated from our husband we were separated from our mate because of denominational ideas and reasonings and creeds and dogmas but he's been loosed now to what to the head can unite with the body the word comes back to the body and now we live by the word not by anybody else's idea not by our own idea but we live by the word brother says in the message queen of sheba from 1960 when god sends a gift to the people and they'll recognize it it's always a golden age don't start thinking because brother bam so many times types he types this golden age that that solomon brought him to with the millennium amen and he ties it but don't forget amen millennium is a place of rest and you can come to a place of rest in your soul amen you can come to this place solomon can bring you to this place and brother bam says it says i'll read it again when god sends a gift to the people that they'll recognize it it always it's always a golden age but when they refuse it there's nothing left but chaos for that generation now listen closely if god had sent the holy spirit in this age for a sign and we reject it there's nothing left but a destruction but if you receive it it's a golden age to you you've come to your golden age amen we're going to the golden age of the millennium we'll be there in flesh amen and bodies oh you know how much i long do you know how much i long to have to have a flesh body to have a spirit and to have a soul that's all in line with no conflict well you and i we don't know what that feels like we have never experienced that before as a complete triune being because we got this war all the time with the inner man and this outer man and they're at war with one another a black dog and a white dog fighting all the time amen and we're never at peace we're constantly subduing the philistines but you know when we come to this great millennium when jesus sets the son of david upon the throne of his father you're going to have a body that is lined up from the soul through the spirit to the flesh you talk about peace peace like you can't imagine i could pick you up send you to the most tranquil island there is in the world with lush vegetables and fruits all around white sandy beaches and perfect climate amen and you still can't get free from yourself you're gonna have rest for a day but then wrong thoughts and wrong desires and selfishness creeps in how can you be free from yourself and then fear and worry and but praise god amen there's a millennium coming amen we'll be free free free we'll know peace like we've never known peace before [Music] when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time amen he left his flesh body back here he stepped into a theophany a word body and he says there's no words that to describe it he says sublime and he's beyond human language amen and he wasn't even completed yet because you're completed in your triune form so it will be even better than that and he couldn't describe that so now when when god sends a gift if we recognize it it's always a golden age so i want to look at that personally for us and for the church solomon bringing them into a golden age amen and this this this release of the word and the holy ghost amen to bring us into a golden age because it is the thing that'll bring us all the way to the millennium it'll bring us to a golden age let's go back to first kings chapter three and look at this gift begin to operate first kings chapter 3 and verse 16. all right verse 16. and now i ask one petition of the whoa whoa first kings chapter three not chapter two first kings chapter three verse 16. then came there two women that were harlots and to the king and stood before him and the one woman said my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no stranger with us in the house saved we too in the house and this woman's child died in the night because she overlaid it and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when i had considered it in the morning behold it was not my son which i did bear and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and the dead is thy son and this said no but the dead is thy son and the living is my son thus they spake before the king then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is dead and the other the other saith nay but thy son is the dead and my son is the living and the king said bring me a sword and they brought a sword before the king and the king said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other then spake the woman whose the living child was and to the king for her bowels yearned upon her son she said oh lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it but the other said let it be neither mine nor thine but divide it then the king answered and said give her the living child and in know why slay it she is the mother thereof and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to do judgment now we look at this and this is the the first record of this judgment that we have after he comes to the throne and when you look at this uh you see the same thing jesus christ was doing he comes and he begins to discern because there's principles and laws with god that are unchanging so solomon is going to discern by the word by the spirit of the word he's been given the spirit of wisdom amen the the word is our wisdom and now he's got that same spirit that's working through him and he looks at these two women amen who both have a child and the argument is over the living child amen and he says one says it's mine the other one says it's hers amen you could attach all kinds of reasonings to this and now today we would do a dna test but in that day solomon could discern just as accurately as a dna test maybe more accurately than a dna test by following the principles of the word because god is love amen and the woman who bore the child amen has a natural love amen that is even inferior to god's love but is still amen after the same manner it's a love and and solomon knows that love is self-sacrificing see there's a principle that we're going to look at through solomon's judgment and it's amazing this principle in solomon's judgment several of his judgments because you'll find that evil evil is self-serving self-love evil self-serving self-love but but godliness sacrifices for others and sacrifices for god so you have two pictures that emerge in solomon's judgment one is a picture of good and evil because he wanted to discern between good and evil and one of these women was good and the other one was evil she was so evil but but for selfish reasons she would more she would more rather that the child be slain than let the original mother have it for for her own selfishness but the the real mother of childhood was because of the principle of love she was willing to give up her right to the child to let the child live she was self-sacrificing because of love she was displaying the nature of good and the other woman was displaying the nature of evil and so solomon was discerning by the word because god is love right and he would even use an analogy of a mother's love sometimes to compare his love how much greater it is than a mother's love in the book of isaiah and so now now solomon by the word by the gift of discernment he's given he's watching this woman i mean these two women both lay claims to the child let's just cut it in half and one woman said that's fine with me and the other woman says no let her have it and he says that's the mother the one who has love and is willing to sacrifice is the good and this is the evil in this situation see we're faced with good and evil every day amen we're making decisions based on good and evil every day and sometimes we just think well it's just me and and i'm just going to make this decision and not realizing that we're coming to the same place we're either going to display the word or we're going to display self-will it goes all the way back to cain and abel amen judgment and discernment all the way back there cain offered what cain wanted to offer abel offered what god desired and his love for god caused him to wait to bring a sacrifice that god wanted but cain's love for himself caused him to ignore abel amen and offer a sacrifice that was pleasing to himself and when god comes down and gives him the word on it he becomes angry angry any any any withstands god to his face and he kills his brother you see i hope i hope that we're learning how to discern ourselves i told somebody the other day i said this is uh at the beginning of the year i said this is 2020. we were talking with some brothers 2020 the year of clear vision perfect eyesight 2020. you know what i think 2020 means for me the ability to see myself it's easy it's easy discern that's wrong and that's right and it's not easy sometimes it's hard but i tell you the greatest challenge is to see your own backside you see everybody else's backside they got a backside they got a backside but the the greatest challenge is to see your own backside and the only way you're going to ever see your own backside is to find a mirror somewhere if you find a mirror you can see your backside and i don't know of any greater mirror than the mirror of the word they keep checking our backside to see if everything is pleasing to the lord i say let the year 2020 be perfect vision for me to discern myself because i think that's where the real challenge is see david fought david fought for the church he thought to free the church amen from outside influences he fought to liberate jerusalem he fought to liberate jerusalem from the jebusites he fought amen to to bring back the ark he he fought to establish the nation he fought amen for the church from all outside influences but when solomon comes to power solomon's not fighting those fights anymore now solomon's rooting evil out of the church david was was dispelling evil from all around the church but solomon comes to a different kind of ministry he's not fighting wars on the outside now solomon is dealing with spirits that are embedded in the church and have been embedded for generations amen when jesus christ comes he does the same thing he doesn't fight romans and he doesn't fight greeks and he doesn't talk about fighting this or liberating this jesus starts fighting the spirits that are embedded in the church and when brother branham comes he does the same exact thing i say god root all the spirits out of your jerusalem bring them out and cast them out so now we see the wisdom of solomon as he begins to deal with these issues we see what discernment really looks like between good and evil let's go back to chapter 2 and look at a commandment i'm going to labor in the word here because there's several things we want to see in the word so stay right with me in the word and don't wander away in your mind praise god are you with me let's do this journey together friends first corinthians three i'm sorry two and one not corinthians kings first kings chapter two verse one now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying i go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and his testimonies that is as it is written in the law moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself that the lord may continue his word which he spoke concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the throne of israel moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two captains of the host of israel unto abner the son of nir and under a mesa the son of jether whom he slew and shed the blood of war and peace and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and his shoes that were on his feet do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his head go down to the grave in peace but show kindness unto the sons of barzilla or zelaya the gileadite and let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they come to me when i fled because of absalom thy brother and behold thou has with thee shemia the son of gira of benjamin a benjamite of beirum which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanan but he come down to meet me at jordan and swear to him i swear to him by the lord saying i will not put thee to death with the sword now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and know us what thou ought us to do unto him but his head bring thou down to the grave with blood so these are some of the final words of david to his son what a charge what responsibility was given to solomon don't forget joab don't forget the one who did me good don't forget shimmy i see david david never judged jerusalem david judged all the demons outside and all the forces outside but now solomon when he comes to the throne david is telling him don't forget these things need judged it wasn't that david didn't know they were there david knew it was there but it had to be the right time because john 5 22 says for the father judges no man but he hath committed all judgment unto the son amen because what is this this is a type of jesus christ coming amen and all judgment is now given to the son david didn't do it he didn't judge it he knew what was right he knew what was wrong but he's committing judgment to the son because solomon is foreshadowing the coming of christ amen for the father judges no man but has committed all judgment to the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father he that on earth not the son on earth not the father which has sent him so now solomon has got to deal he's got to bring judgment into the church david judged outside now we've got to bring judgment into the church and friends that's what jesus christ did he brought judgment into the church that's what brother branham did he brought judgment into the church not not fighting i mean not so much fighting all of these outside influence and getting political and fighting abortion and rallying for life and rallying for this and rallying for that amen that was that was done through the church ages but now the son has come amen and judgment's been given to the son to judge what's going on within the church and get everything rooted out of the church to bring them into a golden age this is the precursor for coming to a golden age and if we're going to come to a golden age in ourselves and we're going to come to a golden age on this earth amen god has got to have preeminence in his church and every old spirit that's laying there has to be driven out who's going to do it there's a greater than solomon's here if a greater than solomon's here then that discernment that judgment that ability to judge and move out of the church is still here first kings chapter one let's go back and let's read the story of adonijah adonijah is a the second son of david absalom has been killed because he rebelled against his father he's been killed when david told them not to kill him joab killed him many ways see joab has a problem joab's a mighty man he's of the family of judah he's a relative of david but he keeps exerting his own self-will over the commandments of his king that's one spirit that has to be dealt with but let's look at adonisia adonijah now is the second and anonysa being the second son after absalom's death adonijah is the most likely to become king if you would look with human reasoning and if you look at a natural order and progression of things you you would not fault anybody for assuming that adonijah will be the next king but the problem is there's going to be a movement that takes place and begins to move and they move ahead of the holy spirit they get ahead of what the king's commandment and they see the king getting old they see his health failing they see that he's diminishing and he's going to pass off this earth soon and the most likely reasonable uh replacement for him is going to be adonijah amen so they begin to bring it about before the king gives the commandment see this is another thing that needs to be dealt with in the church amen so many times we think well this is the obvious next step this is the obvious solution this is what we should do and not waiting for the king to give the commandments adonis verse 5 then adenizer the son of haggath exalted himself saying i will be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and 50 men to run before him he comes up with his own jubilee 50. and his father had not displeased him at any time and saying why has thou done so and he also was a very goodly man and his mother bear him after absalom and he conferred with joab the son of zariah and with abby athar the priest and they followed adonijah helped him they following adonai helped him but zodak the priest and bania the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shemia and riya the mighty men which belonged to david were not with adenija sometimes it's interesting who gets invited and who doesn't sometimes it's very telling who gets invited and who doesn't he he called for there was two priests working in this day through the through the reign of david into solomon there's two kings abby athar amen and and zodac and there are two priests that are working there then you have banaya that's head over one company of the army and you have joab that's that's head over another company in the army and he gathers and adonijah calls for abi athar one of the priests and he calls for one of the mighty men one of the captain of the hosts joab and he says come with me and the others were not included the others were not invited solomon was not invited nathan the prophet was not invited they want to go somewhere without the prophet i say leave me out of that plan if your plan you have to go beyond the prophet or without the prophet to come up with your plan leave me out of that plan without solomon without without nathan the prophet without bania amen without zodak the other priest amen they're going to start a movement amen without amen including the others and they're going to try to take the throne amen because it's the likely place to do but let's just get ahead of the program if we get ahead of program we'll get everything established before david dies amen and everything will be fine and we'll be in position you see this is a selfish move this has nothing to do with the love of the nation the love of david the king amen the love of god this is all selfish selfish selfish selfish selfish and no doubt they had re religious uh uh speech abe arthur the priest was there no doubt they they would say things like oh this will save turmoil we won't have trouble and we'll get things established amen but it wasn't for the king it wasn't for the kingdom it wasn't for god i wonder how many of our plans are just for self not for the love of god or for the love of the kingdom or for the love that came let's look at chapter 50. or verse 50 not chapter 50 verse 50 chapter 1 verse 50. adonis is planned as is unraveled by nathan the prophet and bathsheba david now appoints solomon to be his heir he sends down banai he sends down zodak the priest and nathan the prophet they anoint him they blow the trumpets he rides on the king's mule amen and they all find out and now adonijah becomes afraid he fears for his life because now that now that the king had appointed the successor amen the plan of adonijah all comes unraveled just as soon as god establishes solomon adonis is exposed for what he really is a false king a false believer verse 50 and adonijah feared because of solomon and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feareth king solomon for lo he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword and solomon said if he will show himself a worthy man there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die this is key words so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar and he came and bowed himself to the king solomon and solomon said in him go to thine house. he says he goes and grabs a hold of the horns of the altar and says make him swear he won't kill me he says if he shows himself a worthy man nothing will happen to him but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die so now the stage is set the word is given now we're going to find out what's inside of adonijah because now the word of the king has come the word of the king is sure amen now we're going to find out whether adonijah is good or whether adonijah is evil let's let's go over to chapter 2 verse 17. adonis and now in the next chapter comes the bathsheba solomon's mom and he makes a request and he says in verse 17 and he said speak i pray the end of solomon the king for he will not say the name that he give me a baishag the shunammite to wife now abbashag the shunamai was the fair young virgin they had found for david when david's strength was failing when he could no longer keep his body warm and then they found a fair young virgin that would be a nurse to him and would lie with him and give him heat and cherish him and care for him and it says at the end of that passage it says and he knew her not she remained the king's virgin and then she was there to cherish him and care for him and now ambassador comes to bathsheba and he says because the king won't tell you no i wonder if this was such a great idea why didn't he go to the king himself if it was such a noble plan if it was such a good idea why does he go through a back door and not come through the front door and go through the back door of bathsheba's mother and says now if you'll ask he won't tell you no and and i will get this thing that i desire i will accomplish my plan amen it's just like the serpent if the serpent had a good idea why didn't he tell it to adam why did he have to tell it to the woman amen why why could he just come through the front door and tell adam say adam this is a great idea i understand you should do this this and this but no through subtility he began to beguile seduce amen the woman because he knew it was an evil plan and adonison now comes through the back door not through the front door amen you see the same thing happened in churches all the time if it's such a good idea just tell the pastor amen don't try to talk to his wife and don't try to talk to his friend if it's a great idea just talk to whoever the idea is for if it's a great idea for this family don't tell the wife tell the husband do you think it would be good for them and you think it'd be a great idea and you think it would bless their home i may just go through the front door not the side door it saves us a lot of trouble sometimes our approach exposes our motives you see this is the discernment that solomon has he's discerning by the word amen so many times we get confused by words that are said and sometimes we need to forget the words and look at the action what was the approach was it through headship and did it come the right way because sometimes the approach displays the motive instead of adam isaac going up and asking his dad can i be king next he wakes those dead as weak and sick and in bed amen and his strength is failing amen and he then he grabs himself horses and chariots and 50 men and he gets a zone or abby athar and he gets joab and he says come on i'm going to be king and let's go and let's just do this if it was such a great idea and you were sure you're the next in line why not go ask your dad the reason he didn't go ask david is because he wasn't sure what david would say and he wanted to accomplish his own will because his will mattered more than the kingdom and matter more than the will of the king i hope we're getting 20 20 vision don't put this on anybody else put it right here say what's my motive what's my objective what's my approach is it honest and straightforward and straight up or is there something am i afraid to go right to the front door if i am why why am i afraid to go ask this person or talk to this man and talk to why why am i trying to talk to this one and this one on the side i would check your motive first kings 2 and 22. and king solomon answered and said unto his mother she she asked him she comes to him and asked for adani and king solomon answered and said unto his mother and why does thou ask shag the shunammite for adonisia good question what do you have to do with any of this why are you asking me to give a bishop to him right out from the bat he goes shady deal shady deal shady deal do you know how many shady deals i fell for because i didn't recognize that the approach was wrong and i got caught up in some nonsense because the approach wasn't right oh praise god let's keep going solomon answered and said to his mother and why does thou has a by shaq the shunam my friend and niger ask for him the kingdom also for he is my elder brother even for him and for abe arthur the priest and for joab the son of zariah then king solomon swear by the lord saying god do so to me and more also if adagi have not spoken this word against his own life now therefore as the lord liveth which hath established me and set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me a house as he promised adonai shall be put to death this day and king solomon sent by the hand of banaya the son of jehoiada and he fell upon him that he died solomon gave his word if you're found an upright man nothing will happen but the wickedness be found in you you'll die that day so that means adonijah had no good intentions with this woman adam niger there was another plan because he says why do you ask the woman you might as well just ask for the kingdom there was something else murking underneath amen there was a reason he came to his mother not to him there's a reason he asked for the king's virgin amen so that so that he could sow seed into the king's virgin going after the virgin amen that that virgin was reserved for the king of israel and now solomon was the king of israel what would happen if adonijah took that virgin so you might as well ask for abathur you might as well you might as well hand over the kingdom there's something fishy going on there's wickedness in adonisia and i can tell by his approach he doesn't come the right way amen a lot of trouble in our lives would stop if we just watch for how people approach do they come the right way they come in honor and respect and reverence do they come through the order of headship so many so many young men try to start a relationship with a young lady and they don't come and they don't come down god's order down through headship and speak to her father amen and and if you're a wise dad when you find out you're not going to say well you know he's a good boy he should have asked me he didn't it was an oversight we'll let it go there's a reason he didn't ask you brother have discernment in the word and open your eyes and say something's going on here that i don't like praise god hey i'll just give a disclosure right now i'm not talking about anything that i know is going on and the church in your life but i may be talking about something that's going on i can't say i cannot say i'm not talking about anything that's going on but i can say i'm talking about anything that i know is going on because the word is still a discerner and don't miss it friends i have no knowledge of anything i am not speaking this because i have no knowledge of anything that's going on this is what god laid on my heart so open your eyes and open your ears because the word is a discerner and you may not need this word today but you might need it tomorrow amen so so now because wickedness was found in adonisia he had the wrong approach he had the wrong desires we didn't want the girl he wanted the kingdom and solomon could tell his intentions were evil because of his approach and so now he lost his life and what was that that was righteous discernment and righteous judgment what was solomon purging out of the church he was getting out this conniving subtle serpent spirit that would come and speak to the woman again to try to take over authority and hedge it what did the serpent do what did the devil do through the serpent he come to the woman and seduced the woman so that he could set as a king and god of this evil age on this planet he took it he usurped it amen he sowed his seed in the king's virgin first it's the same thing amen if we just look at what's happened what's happened will happen again we may change the circumstances it may change the names but it's the same thing that happened in the garden of eden the same thing that happened with cain and abel the same thing that happened in the early church is happening now god's given us a word he's given us his whole word to open our eyes and have discernment let's look at abe ethar in verse 26 same chapter and unto abe athar the priests said the king get thee to anathoth thy unto thine own fields for thou art worthy of death but i will not at this time put thee to death because thou bearest the ark of the lord god bear the ark of the lord god before david my father and because thou has been afflicted and all wherein my father was afflicted so solomon thrust out abe athar from being priest unto the lord that he might fulfill the word of the lord which he spake concerning the house of eli and shiloh all of a sudden this judgment doesn't have really it's not just based off the events that's taking place in solomon's life around solomon this goes all the way back to eli's sins for not taking care of his sons back in the days of samuel and there was a prophecy came forth amen from samuel that said amen the the priesthood will be taken from thy house and there were two priests in the days of david abe athar amen which was at the house of eli aaron had four sons and the priesthood was given to aaron but abihu and nadab they they offered strange fire before the lord and he sent down fire and killed them immediately in the inauguration of the temple so there's only two sons left eleazar the elder and then the younger i don't remember his name forgive me eliezer was the one that the high priesthood was given to eliezer and zodak zadok is as a descendant of eliezer he is the rightful high priest but somehow it got mixed up and went through eli amen but eli failed to reign in his sons and there was a prophecy said it will be stripped from your house and where is it going to go back it's going to go back to the house of eleazar god under the ministry of solomon is correcting everything that's crossed up and wrong amen he's bringing it all back to the order it should be this is church order this is the way it should be this is what a true priesthood is you're out of position you're not even a cold man you're not called to that position what is the ministry of solomon doing so the ministry of solomon is correcting the priesthood and bringing it back to the way it should be where it's not uh it's not a succession amen it's not popularity it's not by education but it's by god called men god placed men solomon is correcting the priesthood and a.b athar you think abathar didn't know this do you think there wasn't any competition between him and zadok amen he was invited to the feast of adonijah zadok was not do you think abby athar didn't realize that he didn't know that zadok wasn't invited why didn't he ask the question what about zadok he's my buddy he's my partner we're in this thing together we're both priests we're both the priests of david hey if we're going to do anything right let's do it together no why was he content to go along when zadok was not included it's because he wanted to be the high priest he wanted the authority he wanted the position he wanted to hold on amen even though there's a prophecy that he doesn't have a right to it in the scriptures he doesn't have a right to it and by the prophecy of samuel doesn't have a right to it so he's trying to assert his own will over the will and the word of god because the word is already said it's eleazar and he already said eli will be stripped of the priesthood see we still try to operate in old hangover things that got that way through the church ages but there's a greater than solomon here is to right every wrong whatever got mixed up in the church ages there's a greater than solomon here to straighten it back out straighten back out the offices straighten out the position straighten out the gifts whatever got crisscrossed and got off the word amen there's a ministry of a judge here to discern by the word and bring everything back the way it's supposed to be amen friends we are the most blessed people in the world to have this message if we would just let this message cut us we would be shaped right if we would just die to self-will and the selfishness and try to have a position and hold on to something and be somebody if we could just die to all of that and let that word cut us it'll move us right into the position where we belong our approach amen sometimes what we side with what abe ather sided with when he sided with adonijah adenija excluded zadok and in the exclusion it automatically exalted abiather over zadok and that's what he really wanted but the way up is zadok stayed with david in his failing health in his weakness and his infirmity and the uncertainty of what will happen next and the unknowing of who will be the next king zadok stayed there and all the wrongs in the priesthood were righted by solomon praise god i hope my point is coming clear stay with the word regardless of what our fathers did regardless of what hungover traditions come from the church ages and blended itself in among regard forget it all check it back with the word and let it greater than solomon discern now let's look at joab next verse 28 chapter 228 then kinds came to joab for joab had turned after adonijah though he turned not after absalom and job fled into the tabernacle of the lord and caught hold on the horns of the altar and it was told to king solomon that job was fled into the tabernacle of the lord and behold he is by the altar then solomon sent bania the son of jehoiada saying go fall upon him now there's a couple things that i want to look at here joab joab was i believe a nephew of david and joab was one of the mighty men of david he was a captain over the host but job had a problem and joab's problem was he was willing to kill the righteous line to keep himself in position he killed abner when abner abner had separated amen with the son of saul they thought they were going to start another kingdom and the kingdom was divided and david just had judah and benjamin and they had the other team kingdoms when they found out that that king wasn't god's plan abner was going to bring peace and he was going to bring israel back to david and they had an agreement for peace and part of that david was going to let abner be the captain of the host and joab didn't like this because abner had killed his brother and he had vengeance on his heart and he had his own position to protect and it wasn't love for the king it wasn't love for the people or love for god it was love for himself and in a time of peace when there was an accord of peace when they were coming together in peaceful terms he he enticed abner to the side of the gate and slew him there then when when uh when absalom rebelled against david absalom had taken a part of judah away a mesa another one of the the nephew cousins they they were part of the captain of the host there and david promised him that if you when you come back if you be joined back to me you'll be captain of the host so what did job do when he come amen they were they were routing the enemy amen when they come he come up to him with a hidden sword underneath his mantle and he grabbed him by the beard to kiss him while he was kissing he took the sword and smote it through his fifth rib through deception through deceit he says jesus looked at judas and says thou betrayus the son of man with a kiss you act like my friend he says how are you my friend my brother how are you my brothers what he said before he grabbed by the beard and kissed him pretending to be a brother pretending to come in peace and what did he want he wanted to hold on to his position and he wanted vengeance see that's why david said don't forget joab don't forget what i didn't judge him it wasn't part of my administration to judge him i've given all judgment to the son but now you're coming on the throne now you judge these things that have been hanging on it's been too much strife and too much back fighting and too much acting like a friend and then going and talking about that person because if you destroy their influence it's the same as murder murder so brother branham said murder if you destroy their influence we'll act like a friend act like a brother we'll hug that shake hand and go off and tell everybody all the evil things this brother's done destroying their influence the same as murder but i tell you there's a greater than solomon that's here and he's judging those things and that's thing's not going to stay in the church friends don't greet me with a kiss and stab me under the fifth rib with your hidden sword amen if you don't want to kiss me don't kiss me just don't kill me don't destroy the influence don't speak evil of one another amen just because that they're promised a position that you want to hold on to just because the king delights in them amen and you want the kingdom to delight in you just because you're angry about something that happened years ago amen you stick with the word no strife no backbiting no contention in the church but but fervent love for one another joab forgot that day in sunday school he didn't show up for that bible verse that you have fervent love for one another so joab now see man always destroys himself he sends banaya over to fall on him banaya is always there with the king banaya is one of those mighty men one of those mighty warriors and and one thing i like about banaya if you read about banaya in the scriptures benign never does anything unless the king tells him to do it banaya is is there and he says go follow night of niger he goes and kills adam nigel not because he wanted to kill adam niger but because the king told him to joab was told not to kill absalom he did because he wanted to he was not supposed to kill abner he's not supposed to kill a mess he did it because he wanted to stay on top so why does somebody kill another person's influence only because they want to stay on top so now joab he's got a hold of the horns of the altar when adonijah had the hold of the horns of the altar amen so when he asked for mercy solomon granted him mercy and said if you be found a worthy man you'll be fine but if the day evil is found in you amen so he set up the guidelines to the word adonisja went outside the word and according to the word he had to die but look at job now now solomon has to bring judgment to joe adam has to but he's got to wait because he's got to pass judgment the right way just like when jesus wanted to let this harlot go this woman caught an adulterer he's got to do it the right way so now joab comes banaya goes to fall upon him verse 30 and banaya come to the tabernacle of the lord and said unto him thus saith the king come forth and he said nay but i will die here and baniya brought the king word again saying thus said joab and thus he answered me listen friends what else is solomon supposed to do he said come on out but he says no i'll die here he spoke his own judgment and he spoke his own hurt joab thought he could hide in the church joab thought that he could he could speak evil of brothers that he could slay and kill and ruin the influence of other men of god that are leading host in the army of god and he thought that he could speak evil this and evil that one and he could hide in the church amen but king solomon the prince of peace said you slay him in the church you know how many people are spiritually dead in the church they've been slain at the very altar they're trying to hold on to because they're not repenting for anything they're hiding they think they're hiding from judgment they think they're hiding out and that they won't be destroyed as long as i'm here holding on to the orders you can't kill me here but you can be slain anywhere by the sword of the lord he didn't he didn't believe amen because adonijah when he grabbed ahold of the horns of the altar found mercy but joab didn't ask for mercy job refused the commandment of the king and said i'll die here thinking that he could be safe as long as i hid in church and as long as i say i believe the message and as long as i hold on to the horns of the altar god won't kill me here and you've spoken your own destruction you'll be slayed by the word and spiritually die right in the message church you can't hide from god you can't hide from the greater the solomon that's here the word is slaying your own words will slay you so joe banaya goes and tells him said this is what job said he won't come he said he'll die there and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon him and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which job shed for me from the house of my father and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword my father david not knowing thereof to wit abner the son of nur captain of the host of israel mesa the son of jether captain of the host of judah their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab and upon the head of his seed forever but upon david and upon his seed and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace forever from the lord so banaya the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him he slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness and the king put banaya the son of jehoiada in his room over the host and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar what did banaya do to get joab's position he didn't do what joab did to hold on to it joab killed job deceived joab tricked his brothers in thinking they were friends and then went around and spoke evil of them and ruined their influence see i'm bringing it to today we don't want to leave it there we want to bring it today all these things were written for our examples but what did banaya do all he did was obey solomon when solomon said go he went when psalms don't go he didn't go he didn't use his own mind he didn't exert his own will he didn't seek for a position he just stayed put he stayed with david like zadok stayed with david and david's diminishing when david was going down he stayed put when david had no more strength he stayed put when there was turmoil in the kingdom he stayed put waiting for the king to tell him what to do sometimes what we need to do friends is nothing sometimes what we need to do when things are falling apart around us it looks like weakness and it looks like things are going downhill what we need to do is stay put and wait for the king to tell us what to do because there is a greater than solomon here and he will not instruct us outside of his word whatever he tells us to do will be right in line with his word let's look at one more you guys with me for another one praise god shimmy i remember he's purging the church for spirits this is judgment in the house of the lord these are israelites that he's judging now and casting out we can bring this right to ourselves it is not those nasty philistines those idolaters out there there's people who don't believe in god no this is the chosen people and he's got to root this out of them and we're the chosen of god he's got to root this out of us friends so that we can come to the golden age this is the precursor to coming to the golden age they would never come to the golden age with these spirits hanging around the church they have to be rooted out and if we're going to come to the golden age these things have to be rooted out of us a love for position a desire to get ahead of god amen a root of bitterness towards our brothers are self-willed to do our own thing it's got to get out of us friends until we can be like bania and just stay put the king says do that do it no matter how unpleasant the task it wasn't a pleasant task binay was sent on to go into the temple and get a man who's holding on to the horns of the altar and slay him there do you know how difficult a task that would have been the respect that they had for the house of god the respect that he had for job they had fought battles together side by side but he did what his king told him to do not more not less first kings chapter 2 verse 36 and the king sent and called for shemitah and said unto him build thee a house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not fence in each other shimmy i was the one that when david ran from jerusalem because absalom was coming and david didn't run from jerusalem because he feared absalom david ran from jerusalem to save the inhabitants of jerusalem and he ran away and while he was running shimmy i came and shimaya happens to be of the family of the household of saul and so he's not real happy about david being king because if it had followed in saul's house he would have a position see he's not upset about david being david he's upset about david's position putting him out of his position all of these things that are being judged they all have a common thread self-will self-love every one of them all the way back to the two harlots they all have the same theme self-will self-love what are we dying to ourselves what's our greatest enemy self who do we have to die to self self will self love has got to be rooted out of this church it's got to be rooted out of this jerusalem remember we started the year because i felt like the lord impressed us on jerusalem judea samara the uttermost parts of the earth and taking jerusalem as us that we can't we've got to be witnesses within ourselves we've got to be the real deal no hypocrites genuine believers then our families and then our local church and then we can spread out and boy did god do a good job of helping us keep that commitment stuck us in our homes for a while shut down travel so now these things have to be rooted out of jerusalem we got to have 20 20 vision oh boy i got a problem that's what the word's supposed to do chapter 2 verse 36. we read 36 let's go 37 first shall be that on the day thou goest out and passes over the brook kedron thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die thy blood shall be upon thine own head and shimmy said unto the king that saying is good as my lord the king hath said so will thy servant do and shed me i dwelt in jerusalem many days i this is probably my favorite of all of them shimmy i when when david's down and when david strong shimmy i says nothing i'm telling your friends you'll find a shimmy eye in your life sometime when everything's going wrong right nobody says anything but when things go bad shimaya shows up to kick dust on you and throw stones at you and tell you you're wrong it's like if you love me why didn't you come tell me i was wrong back when everything was fine but why do you wait till everything goes wrong to say you're wrong you're a bloody man now the episode's taking over it's all your fault shimmy i look up shimaya means renowned his name means renowned he's the son of giro which means grain or the seed do you think he thinks a lot of himself of the house of saul he he might have been in the royal lineage he might have been he might have you know had stake on a position if saul would have if it wouldn't would it would have went to jonathan or somebody else one of the other heirs in benjamin but he lost out and he could not submit himself all the way to david it only looked like he was submitting until these spirits lay there god allows things to happen to show what spirit's laying there brother ben said he'll allow you to get sick just to see what you'll do about it he'll allow cut trump brother said he'll allow troubles to come in the church just to see what you'll do about it just to expose spirits that are laying there shimmy i was an evil spirit that was laying in the church and it went unrecognized until absalom tried to take over and david looked like he's losing everything and when david's completely defeated and marching out then shemia shows where he's really at and where his allegiance really is and david didn't forget about it but he gave all judgment to the son he said don't forget shimmy i bring his hori head to the grave in blood but solomon's going to act like christ he's not just going to run up he's going to extend mercy he's going to extend an opportunity how does he extend an opportunity he gives him a commandment see the word the word is the judge see shimaya is not going to keep the king's word and when shemiah doesn't keep the word the word was already the judge if you would have loved the king you would have loved his word when you failed his word you showed you didn't love him so the word is the judge as soon as as soon as shimmy i violated this word which was given as an extension of mercy why did shimmy i say that's good that's good what you said that's a good word because he knows he's guilty he knows he deserves death you know he was he was sweating bullets when david came back across jordan to be reinstated king and he goes down and he bounces before him david and he begs him for mercy and david granted him mercy even though joab's brother said let's kill him he said nobody's going to die today today's a great day we're coming back but david didn't forget he gave judgment to the son and now shimmy i you know now he acts like he's submitted but that old spirit still laying there it doesn't matter how long amen i've seen it already in my in my lifetime somebody will do something they'll get off they'll do wrong then they'll come back say they're sorry and then another week or two or month or so later they do the exact same thing showing that spirit was never rooted out it still laid there and shimmy i said that's a good word that's good what you said is good i'll do that but look at this verse 39 and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of shimaya ran away into his son of mayaka king of gath and they and they told shimaya saying behold thy servants be in gath and shimmy i rose and saddled his ass and went to gath to achis to seek his servants and shemia went and brought his servants from gath and it was told solomon that shemia had gone from jerusalem to gath and was come again and the king sent and called for shemitah and said unto him did i not make thee to swear by the lord and protested thee saying know for a certain on the day that thou goest out and walk us to broad any thither any weather that thou shalt surely die and thou sayest unto me the word that i had heard is good why then has thou not kept thy oath of the lord and thy commandment that i have charged thee with the king said moreover to shimmy i thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to that thou didst to david my father therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head and king solomon shall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established before the lord forever so the king commanded banaya the son of jehoiada which went out and fell upon him that he died and the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon this is the last spirit that he gets rid of a spirit that when it's in trouble and cornered and caught can submit when it's caught when it's exposed when when the when when everybody's in strength and everything looks good it can cement but it never died it never went away he said solomon's words were good but he didn't love solomon and he didn't love his commandment he loved himself because after three years when his servants ran away amen that was a loss and he was not willing to sacrifice for the word that spirit's still alive as long as there was no sacrifice he could keep the word the moment that he had to sacrifice for the word he was no longer willing to sacrifice for the word he probably assumed after three years solomon forgot he won't mind it'll be okay i'll be able to go out and do this and slip back and he'll never know don't think that spirit doesn't still try to work right here among us doesn't matter how long it's been doesn't matter how many years it's been the word is the word doesn't matter how long ago that happened or how many years ago that the word is the word and he would not sacrifice himself for the word he was willing to sacrifice the word for himself and because he was willing to sacrifice the word for himself he died also i wonder how many people spiritually die in jerusalem i wonder how many people refuse the word do like job hold on to the altar i'll be safe as long as i stay right here with all these believers as long as i stay in this house affair as long as i stay at this altar of incense i'll be safe nothing will happen to me here and that's the very very place you die spiritually stay under the word but but these circumstances like that was i agree i should stay here but i've got two servants run away i mean you understand the circumstances there was no there was no clauses in the in the statement solomon made there was no exemptions to the word and he acknowledged that it was a good word until he had to sacrifice for that word then all of a sudden he was willing to lay the word aside for himself i say friends let's not let that spirit creep in let's keep it out god said it that's the way it's going to be if god restricted me here i'm restricted here not for three years not for 10 years not for 30 years but if i'm restricted by the word here and i'm told to stay here i will stay here if it cost me everything i will stay here see after these spirits were rooted out adenisia who threw subtility in the wrong approach tried to take what wasn't his through joab who was willing to kill and murder to stay on top shimayai amen who would hide out in submission until the right time and show what was really in him 8th are the wrong person in the wrong position of those things were in the church but under the king under the rulership of solomon solomon purged all of that out of the church and i want to say it greater than solomon's here if it could be persian that day jesus christ came and plotted together accords and he went and beat the money changed out of the church because he had zeal for the house of the lord don't think that he doesn't still have zeal for the house of the lord only the house of the lord is not this building the house of the lord is you and he has the same zeal for you as he had for that temple there and if he's got to take a whip and come after us with a whip in our lives to drive out the money changers amen so that his house will be a house of prayer and worship he will do it friends he still has bonaires in this day he still has zadoks he still has those that will stand with him in the word and accomplish his word still zealous over his house and we are that house and he's still going to purge out everything that's hindering us friends a greater than solomon is here i'm going to read another passage of scripture with you matthew 23. we'll look at jesus talking to some priests and then we'll finish up with this matthew 23 and i think we'll start matthew 23 and verse 13. woe unto you scribes pharisees hypocrites for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for you neither go in yourselves need to suffer you them that are entering to go in woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you devour widow's houses and for a pretense make long prayer therefore you shall receive the greater damnation woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte and we as maid you make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves woe unto you you blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is in a debtor ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the ghoul whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon the opponent he is guilty he fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the altar that sanctified the gift whosoever therefore shall swear by the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth thereon and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of god and by him that set it thereon woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and anas and common and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought you to have done and not to leave the other undone you blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites if you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess you blind pharisees cleanse first that which is within the cup and the platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for your likened to the white of sepulcher which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness let's go back to chapter six i want to read one more passage and then comment on that matthew 6 and 1. matthew chapter 6 verse 1 take heed that you do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your faith father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thine alms may be in secret that thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward the openly and when thou prayest thou shall not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou will now prayest enter into thy closet when i will shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and my father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly i read this two passages of scripture for a reason because by that you can begin to see by the way jesus talks to the pharisees that he realizes that they don't love god they do not love god and they do not love the word all that they love is themselves he's finding the same thing that day in that church that solomon found in his day joab loved himself more than he loved the king abathur loved himself more than he loved the king shimmy i loved himself more than he loved the king adonijah loved himself and when he loved the king it was all for self self self you brought in your phylacteries amen when you're fasting you whiten your face and so that you look gone so that you look so everybody knows you're religious but you have no love of god you're outwardly like a wider wall but inside you're full of dead men's bones you look right you look close to the top you're going into the altar amen you're burning incense you're giving sacrifice you're sounding a trump and you're dumping alms by the truckload into the basket amen but you don't do it for me you don't do it for god you do it for you joab amen when he killed absalom and when he killed a mesa and when he killed abner he wasn't doing it for david he was doing it for himself when abby athar went to pour the anointing on adonijah he wasn't doing it for david he was doing it for himself and jesus come and unraveled the whole system your whole system is to look good but it's not because you love god it's because you love yourself if you loved god you would keep the word you would keep it in spirit and in truth you wouldn't make a form or a religion out of it whereby you could hold others in bondage and you yourself can be exalted it's not about self when jesus came it wasn't about him it was about the father they had a they had a system like they had joab wanted to be the mighty man abe author wanted to be the high priest shemiah wanted saul's kingdom to continue so he could be something and adam naija wanted to be the next king but banaya wanted to please david but zadok wanted to serve god you see the difference these things got to be rooted out of jerusalem why because there's another gift there's another gift to rally around friends it wasn't it wasn't the gift it wasn't another solomon that can stand here and give you wisdom about birds and trees it wasn't just like another jesus christ it was the same thing that was in solomon is the same thing that was in jesus christ the same thing that was in our brother branham and it's the same thing that's here now it's the word the full life of the word is here and looking for those who will keep the least of his commandment looking for those who will sacrifice who will die who will wait till he speaks before they move who will not exalt themselves but will base themselves those that will stay low and stay humble and stay with the word and wait for him to speak that's what he's looking for and i want to be one of them and i say lord in 2020 give me 20 20 vision of myself not everybody else around me i mean denominational people can discern that the world's in trouble and in judgment it doesn't take a lot of discernment to know what's going on out there i mean people who don't even go to church knows that the world's in judgment it doesn't take much discernment to find faults in your brothers and your sisters and your problems but jesus says make sure you get that beam out of your own eye first before you pluck the boat how are you going to get the beam out of your own eye without a mirror there's a greater than solomon here and the greater than solomon is here to purge all the spirits away from the church to bring us to a golden age this is our golden age friends if we can accept the gift that's among us which is the restored word if we can accept the gift that's among us we can have a golden age it could be in a golden age in your heart it can be a golden age in your family it can be a golden age with your brothers and sisters if we'll just let the word rule and discern and purge out all the spirits i say god if you have to cup me cut me if you have to cut me to save me cut me but don't let me go the wrong way let's all stand musicians you can come i want to read romans 6 and 3 where we're standing know you not that so many of us that were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism in the death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we've been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for and that he died he died in the sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god likewise reckon you're also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive in god through jesus christ our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither you yield yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god you know who i want to be banaya don't have to be on top i don't have to be the best i don't have to have the most stories or songs song about me i just want to wait for the lord's command and i want to fulfill the lord's command no matter how hard no matter how much it costs me i don't want to chase false movements and i won't chase false empires and i don't want to have to tear down others to keep myself up i just want to be banaya i just want to stay there i saw i saw the ministry of david he served david and now he saw david he saw him move from the ministry of david to the ministry of solomon and now he moved because he wanted to be where god was and when he's here with solomon there's a greater than solomon here and i want to be benign i want to stay here serve him not serve me serve him banaya got his position not because he fought for it clamored for it spoke for put it in a good word made alliances with other people he got his position because he gave his whole life to the king and i want to give my whole life to the king and wherever he grants me to be i want to serve him there amen whether it be up or whether it be down amen whether go good or whether or go bad i want to give my whole life to the king and serve the king if you'll be a beast thou shalt be exalted in due time i don't care i don't care if it comes at the judgment of rewards it never comes in this life i'm fine with that i don't care if he defers everything for me until future i'm fine with that but right now i want to stay with the king a greater than solomon is here and it's not in one person where is it where is that gift we're rallying around is it my pastor is it this preacher over here is it this gifted man over here that's not the gift we're rallying around the gift we're rallying around is the holy ghost it's come with the word the opening of the word the third pull christ himself here in his bride that's the gift we're rallying around and to stay subject to that king we have to stay submissive to that word let's pray lord jesus i thank you thank you god for your word lord god you didn't lay that in the bible just for somebody to see in solomon's day for it wasn't even written in his day but you wrote that out for us today so you would know what you want from us lord i believe you're here you're greater than solomon you're here you're dwelling in the tabernacle of your people you're dwelling in the new jerusalem and it's a golden age lord for your bride god you come lord to purge every wrong influence that would take us the wrong way every wrong spirit lord everything that would assert itself observe itself over you let us die to it now as we looked in this word lord you showed us lord how you cleansed the church in solomon's reign how you cleansed it when jesus was here and how you cleansed it through brother banham i pray lord that you would keep cleansing it you're here lord you're greater than solomon you're establishing your kingdom in the hearts of men upon this earth your new jerusalem is here and your bride you are here lord be glorified be magnified lord let us be like banaya and give our whole selves to you what you say your commandment your least your commandment that's for us let us live it faithfully let us be purged lord from iniquity lord our own thinking and self-love [Music] god you allow things to happen in our lives so that we can see ourselves you allow situations arise so we can judge ourselves let us not miss the judgment lord let your word judge us let your word cut us let it cut out all unrighteousness god i pray you take away self-love god you said if we go down in the likeness of your death we shall come up in the likeness of your resurrection and you died humble and submissive submitting your own will to the will of the father and god i want to go down in that same likeness to die to myself to humble myself under your word whatever it says that's my command whatever you spoke that's my limitation those are my boundaries and i choose to accept it and stay within it forgive us for our failures lord heal us lord from the wounds that we've given ourselves in disobedience purge us lord and bring us each one individually into a golden age bring our families into that golden age under the ministry of the word bring this church this local assembly into the golden age under the word and then bring your bride out into the golden age of the millennium oh how we thank you for your word and how we love you god how we ask all that you would just minister unto us we give you ourselves a fresh we give you ourselves anew take the mirror of your word and show us lord show us ourselves we love you god in jesus name we pray amen [Music] lord is [Music] [Music] all i ever really want is you so take the grandest thing you know that life can give one thing i have [Music] [Music] we're going to ask brother peter and sister sarah to come forward and bring their baby for dedication you all can have your seats as they come little girl was born in june they've been able to make it over since since that time till now and so we're really glad to have them here so we're going to dedicate little nazarene kusukika you know when miradi their first baby was born she was an absolute miracle the doctor said she couldn't have a child she couldn't conceive but but god had showed them and he had showed brother peter in a dream that they'd have a baby and brother peter and sister sarah both knew the baby would come and god against all odds he brought little miradie and after she was born sister sarah had so many complications and so much trouble the doctor said don't have another child you can't do it you can't have another child she can't take it and but sister sarah said god will take care of it and the next little girl has come along by the grace of god when god heals god heals the doctors say all they know to say and that's fine let them say what they need to say all that they can see but we don't look at what we see we look to the unseen we look at a promise so if the first little girl was a miracle the second little girl is also a miracle and we thank god for that god bless you brother praise the lord let's bow our heads friends lord jesus we thank you lord for this little life that we hold in our arms god we know as your prophet taught we're just here in your stead because when you were here you took the little children in your arms and you blessed them god now you want to stand in

grace lord you've healed our sister you've blessed our brother and sister and given them this life and you've placed this little life in their hands and i pray god you'd strengthen their arms and give them wisdom and your leadership to raise little nazarene for your glory i pray god that she would know what it's like to be raised in a home that's set aside and sanctified and holy with the presence of the holy ghost and your holy angels there god that she might grow in your presence she might give her heart to you from a young age she might be born again receiving the new birth while she's young and in her parents home god i pray that you would use her for your glory and let her light shine in this world for everything you do is for a purpose and nothing is in vain and you've done this for a purpose as well bless my brother and sister thank you as a church we stand by them we thank you together for this little life and for the miracles that you work in our in our lives all the time lord
