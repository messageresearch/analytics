[14:02] reminder for everybody that will be the
[14:03] kids service this sunday at 4 p.m so
[14:06] we're looking forward to that
[14:08] and let's look in isaiah chapter 26
[14:12] and verse 3.
[14:14] isaiah 26 and 3
[14:18] thou will keep him in perfect peace
[14:20] whose mind is stayed on thee
[14:22] because he trusteth in thee
[14:25] that will keep him in perfect peace
[14:26] whose mind has stayed on thee because he
[14:29] trusteth in thee amen god bless you as
[14:31] you're seated
[14:33] amen if there was ever a time this world
[14:36] needs peace
[14:38] amen perfect peace
[14:40] the world is going crazy people are
[14:43] losing their peace they're losing amen
[14:45] their their sense of whatever they're
[14:48] just losing it i mean whatever it is
[14:50] they're losing you can safely say
[14:51] they're losing it amen whatever it is we
[14:54] can see the effect of it
[14:55] but thou will keep him in perfect peace
[14:58] this is not just peace this is perfect
[15:00] peace
[15:01] whose mind has stayed on thee because he
[15:03] trusteth in thee so why is his mind
[15:06] stayed on him because he trusteth in him
[15:08] this is the one i focused my attention
[15:10] on the one that i trust in amen the one
[15:12] that i have confidence in the one that i
[15:14] know amen will see me through amen i
[15:17] have
[15:19] my mind is stayed on christ because i
[15:22] know that christ will see me through
[15:24] so that will bring
[15:26] perfect peace
[15:28] i'd like to speak this evening on just a
[15:30] simple subject the lord's been dealing
[15:32] with me on for about a month uh on the
[15:34] channel of the mind and if we could just
[15:36] take some time this evening and talk
[15:38] about the channel of the mind and ask
[15:40] the lord to bless us as we as we we
[15:42] share what's on our heart
[15:44] brother venom says in in the message
[15:46] taking god at his word the five senses
[15:48] wasn't given to man to contact god with
[15:52] we know that brother beam says that many
[15:54] times that our this our senses were not
[15:56] meant to contact god you cannot contact
[15:58] god through your senses amen you can
[16:00] only contact god by faith he goes on to
[16:02] say
[16:03] the five senses wasn't given to man to
[16:05] contact god with however five senses was
[16:07] given to man to contact his earthly home
[16:10] we contact god by faith the sixth sense
[16:13] amen so the only way for us to contact
[16:16] god is by faith
[16:18] is that right
[16:19] so none of the senses that we have we
[16:22] have five amen in the body and five in
[16:24] the spirit none of these senses were
[16:26] meant for us to contact god by but i
[16:29] would like to just just pose a thought
[16:31] for you if you'll just bear with me for
[16:33] a minute as we developed it
[16:35] we cannot contact god through the senses
[16:38] we contact god through faith
[16:40] but god uses those senses to contact us
[16:45] so i would like to talk about that
[16:46] through the scriptures if we can turn to
[16:48] john the gospel of john chapter 20
[16:51] and i'd like to just go through a few
[16:53] scriptures
[16:54] as we paint this picture
[16:57] john chapter 20.
[17:00] so we cannot contact god with the senses
[17:04] but god will use those senses to contact
[17:06] us
[17:10] so
[17:11] john 20 verse 26
[17:17] john chapter 20 verse 26 and after eight
[17:20] days again his disciples were within and
[17:22] thomas was with them then came jesus the
[17:25] doors being shut and stood in the midst
[17:27] and said peace be unto you
[17:29] then said he to thomas reach hither thy
[17:31] finger
[17:33] and behold my hands and reach hither my
[17:35] hand thy hand and thrust it into my side
[17:37] and be not faithless but believing
[17:40] and thomas answered and said unto him my
[17:42] lord and my god jesus said unto him
[17:45] thomas because thou has seen me thou has
[17:47] believed blessed are they that have not
[17:49] seen and yet have believed and who we
[17:51] know that blessing applies to us amen
[17:54] but yet you know when thomas was having
[17:56] an issue with his faith god was going to
[17:59] come down and encourage his faith
[18:01] because the only way that thomas amen
[18:03] could touch god was by faith but god was
[18:06] going to come down and touch thomas amen
[18:09] so that thomas could believe and he come
[18:11] down and he said take thy finger and
[18:13] thrust it into my hand take thy hand and
[18:15] thrust in my sight he stood there amen
[18:18] as the resurrected christ and said see
[18:19] me and touch me and don't be unbelieving
[18:22] but believe amen
[18:24] and thomas believed
[18:26] now let's go to romans chapter 10.
[18:31] romans chapter 10.
[18:35] we're just going to hit three more
[18:37] places here romans chapter 10
[18:39] verse 17.
[18:45] so then faith
[18:47] cometh by hearing
[18:49] and hearing by the word of god
[18:52] so we we cannot
[18:54] contact god with our senses but here
[18:56] he's using the sense of hearing to
[18:58] contact us because we have to have faith
[19:00] to touch him but faith cometh by
[19:03] hearing and hearing by the word amen so
[19:07] i want us to get this straight in our
[19:08] mind that the only way for us to contact
[19:10] god is by our faith amen but god is
[19:13] using these senses to bring us into
[19:15] faith to bring the word to us for us to
[19:17] believe so that we can contact him so
[19:20] god is contacting us through the senses
[19:22] so that we can contact him without any
[19:25] of the senses only by faith
[19:28] amen this is all going to come to a
[19:30] point
[19:32] first john chapter one
[19:34] let's go over to first john
[19:36] over here as we get close to revelation
[19:38] first john chapter one
[19:44] first john chapter one
[19:48] and we'll read verse one
[19:51] that which was from the beginning
[19:53] which we have heard
[19:55] hearing
[19:56] which we have seen with our eyes
[19:59] seeing
[20:00] which we have looked upon and our hands
[20:02] have handled of the word of life for the
[20:06] life was manifested and we have seen it
[20:09] and bear witness and show unto you that
[20:12] eternal life which was with the father
[20:14] and was manifest unto us
[20:16] that which we have seen and heard
[20:18] declare we unto you
[20:20] that you also may have fellowship with
[20:22] us and truly our fellowship is with the
[20:25] father and with his son jesus christ so
[20:28] now the apostle john is telling you we
[20:30] have seen we have heard we have handled
[20:33] of the word of life and now we are here
[20:36] to declare it to you so that you can
[20:38] hear what we say about what we saw and
[20:40] about what we touched
[20:42] there's a lot of senses amen a lot of
[20:45] human senses involved but the whole
[20:47] point was for god get the word down into
[20:49] the soul so that you can believe because
[20:51] that's the only way that you can touch
[20:53] god so god is using your senses to
[20:55] contact you so that the only way that
[20:57] you can contact him is by faith
[21:01] now let's go over to revelation chapter
[21:02] 1.
[21:09] revelation chapter 1
[21:12] verse 3.
[21:16] blessed is he that readeth
[21:19] now in order to read you have to be able
[21:20] to see
[21:22] you have to have a mind you've had to
[21:24] learn i mean reading is not looking
[21:26] reading also involves the intellect
[21:30] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[21:33] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[21:35] those things which are written therein
[21:37] for the time is at hand
[21:39] so even a blessing will come to those
[21:41] that read or that hear
[21:43] amen the words of this prophecy and i
[21:46] just if i could just take a minute to
[21:48] share what my thought is you know we we
[21:50] know that the only way we can contact
[21:52] god amen is by faith amen we can say a
[21:55] lot of words we can come to church we
[21:57] can do a lot of things light candles
[21:59] give offerings but none of those things
[22:01] will bring you in contact with god only
[22:04] faith is what will contact god
[22:06] but god has a way of unlocking the faith
[22:09] that is in us by bringing us the word
[22:11] and he brings that word through our
[22:12] senses we have a bible in print so that
[22:15] we could look at it we have the sense of
[22:17] sight so that we can read we have a mind
[22:19] amen that we can learn so that we can
[22:21] read so that when we read the word amen
[22:23] we can receive the word and it can
[22:25] unlock faith in us so that we can touch
[22:27] god
[22:29] amen and so god begins to use amen these
[22:32] senses in us amen so that we can begin
[22:35] to know him and the word can unlock even
[22:38] brother banham would use these senses in
[22:40] us to get us to receive the word amen
[22:43] what about the sense of imagination
[22:46] amen what about when brother banham goes
[22:48] to tell the story and he begins to see
[22:50] amen he said i can just see adam and eve
[22:53] walking out of the garden
[22:55] he said i can just see amen as the
[22:58] bloody skins are slapping against their
[23:00] leg as they walk out and the blood is
[23:02] trickling down amen i want to ask you
[23:05] can you see it in your mind
[23:07] what is that that's your imagination so
[23:09] what is god using he's using your mind
[23:11] using your imagination amen using all of
[23:14] these things amen even using your
[23:16] affection even using your memory amen
[23:19] because something will happen and god
[23:21] will trigger a memory of a scripture you
[23:23] read or something brother branham said
[23:24] then bring the word to light in your
[23:26] life amen so that faith can grow
[23:29] so we can only contact god by faith but
[23:32] god is constantly contacting us through
[23:34] our senses
[23:36] and that's why
[23:38] i wanted to talk about the channel of
[23:40] the mind because of some things brother
[23:42] benham said
[23:43] and and because god is always trying to
[23:46] contact us through our senses i think
[23:48] it's very very important that we keep
[23:51] the channel of these senses open for god
[23:53] to use
[23:55] and not allow the devil to plug up these
[23:58] channels amen so that we can't receive
[24:01] the word the way god wants us to receive
[24:03] the word amen and all of a sudden things
[24:05] become amen we we just don't hear him
[24:07] like we should hear him because the
[24:09] channels are plugged up with so many
[24:11] other things amen
[24:14] you think about the realm of imagination
[24:16] my goodness
[24:18] in noah's day they had a problem with
[24:20] imagination
[24:22] because all the imagination of their
[24:24] heart were wicked or evil continually
[24:27] amen and god was going to condemn them
[24:29] because their imagination realm was only
[24:32] evil continually
[24:34] amen
[24:35] but we know there was so many times that
[24:38] the imagination realm for many of the
[24:40] prophets of god amen were being used as
[24:43] they meditated on god as david would sit
[24:46] amen at his sheep when he was tending
[24:48] his father's sheep and they would all be
[24:50] at rest amen in the pasture sitting down
[24:53] amen his meditation his imagination and
[24:57] his thoughts would meditate on god
[24:59] continually and he would begin to write
[25:01] praise songs and worship songs amen
[25:03] because the meditation of his mind was
[25:06] on god
[25:08] but when it comes to noah's day their
[25:10] imagination was on evil
[25:12] continually and we live in a day where
[25:15] the mind of humanity is bombarded with
[25:18] images bombarded with messages bombarded
[25:21] with information until the imagination
[25:24] can be so plugged up amen with
[25:26] information and images and and all of
[25:29] these things amen i think it's time that
[25:32] we as the bride of jesus christ say i am
[25:34] not going to give all of my senses to
[25:37] the world but i'm going to reserve them
[25:39] to hear from
[25:40] god because that's how god is trying to
[25:43] communicate with me
[25:45] brother branham said in spoken word is
[25:47] the original seed he said but any time a
[25:50] woman takes a wrong step
[25:52] she has to first receive it in her mind
[25:55] some slicker has to persuade her and she
[25:58] listens to it against her own better
[25:59] judgment than the act is committed see
[26:02] first it hit satan hit eve's mind
[26:05] and the womb of her mind she doubted
[26:07] god's word then came the actual act
[26:10] amen everything was fine and shall she
[26:13] begin to give her senses
[26:15] amen to the voice of the serpent
[26:19] and the serpent began to use her sense
[26:21] of hearing
[26:23] he began to use her her imagination
[26:27] he began to use he began to sow a seed
[26:31] in her mind before he could ever sow a
[26:34] seed in her womb he had to first sow a
[26:36] seed in her mind amen
[26:39] amen
[26:40] so he said the only way that we can ever
[26:42] be born again is first the womb of the
[26:44] mind receive the word
[26:46] and then the spirit comes on top of that
[26:48] and brings it to life
[26:50] there you are that's what it does that's
[26:52] the real gospel teaching brother i
[26:54] believe if saint paul was standing today
[26:56] he teach the same thing i do in this
[26:58] hour we believe it amen we're resting on
[27:01] that
[27:03] what was the result with her physical
[27:05] and spiritual death
[27:07] what is the result of those who accept
[27:09] the other way it goes into this frolic
[27:11] today that they got both physical and
[27:13] spiritual death both body and spirit
[27:16] shall be annihilated be no more that's
[27:17] exactly right
[27:19] note mary's wound mary's womb the
[27:21] physical mind see was a virgin womb
[27:26] why she believed god's word no matter
[27:28] how much anybody criticized how many
[27:31] things somebody else said that didn't
[27:33] have one thing to do with it she
[27:34] believed god's word regardless
[27:37] oh i wish i could just get that over are
[27:40] you getting it first was her mind
[27:43] before the act ever took place in her
[27:45] literal womb now he's speaking of the
[27:47] virgin mary
[27:49] first she must receive the word from an
[27:51] angel messenger when she received the
[27:53] word from the angel messenger she
[27:55] received it first and then she conceived
[27:58] in the womb
[28:00] so god was using the channel that's why
[28:02] gabriel comes and appears to her so now
[28:05] she sees with her eyes an angel she
[28:08] hears the message with his voice why god
[28:10] is trying to get to her to unlock faith
[28:13] that's inside of her to receive the word
[28:15] so god is using the senses amen and he
[28:18] begins he appears visibly audibly gives
[28:22] a message unto her amen and she she
[28:25] doesn't even know how these things can
[28:26] be but he begins to work amen even in
[28:29] into her mind amen and begins to tell
[28:32] her that this is going to happen by the
[28:33] holy ghost and something in her unlocks
[28:36] and say be it unto me according to thy
[28:38] word
[28:40] so
[28:41] no angelic visitation no audible sounds
[28:44] coming from the voice of that angel amen
[28:47] there would have been no faith for mary
[28:49] to receive the promise
[28:52] amen
[28:56] so
[28:57] he goes on to say
[28:59] for mary
[29:02] it first was her mind before the act
[29:05] ever taken place in her little room the
[29:07] act had to take place in in here first
[29:09] to let the spirit come in to do the rest
[29:11] of the work oh my
[29:13] glory before the actual spiritual birth
[29:16] can take place the word has to find it
[29:18] itself through your mind
[29:21] he that heareth my words and believeth
[29:22] on him that sent me hath eternal life
[29:24] and shall never come into the judgment
[29:26] or through the tribulation period but
[29:27] has passed from death and to life
[29:30] now brother abraham says in the message
[29:31] the end time signed seed says now what
[29:34] if god would send his message by an
[29:36] angel to mary and said hail mary blessed
[29:39] art thou amongst women you're going to
[29:40] have a baby knowing no man she said now
[29:43] wait a minute here let me take you down
[29:46] to the laboratory and you tell me let
[29:48] the doctor prove to me just how i'm
[29:49] going to do this
[29:51] then i'll believe you it would never
[29:53] happen but what did she what what did
[29:55] she come to the womb of her heart the
[29:57] womb of her spirit the womb of her
[29:59] spirit is your mind your mind is a
[30:01] channel
[30:03] so i want you to catch that your mind is
[30:05] a channel and that's what god was using
[30:08] as gabriel was speaking unto mary he was
[30:10] using the channel of her mind amen to
[30:13] unlock the faith that was laying down in
[30:15] here because she was predestinated to
[30:17] bring forth that virgin seed amen the
[30:20] seed of the woman from before the
[30:21] foundation of the world remember that
[30:23] that faith had to be unlocked amen and
[30:26] we know that it had to do with mary's
[30:28] faith because when she went to go visit
[30:31] elizabeth amen she gave a salutation her
[30:34] salutation caused that baby the leap in
[30:36] the womb of elizabeth and elizabeth
[30:38] began to prophesy and as elizabeth began
[30:41] to prophesy amen he says she begins to
[30:44] say something on the order of because
[30:47] these things shall be performed in you
[30:49] because you believed
[30:52] because you believe these things will be
[30:54] performed because you believed amen
[30:57] because everything in the kingdom of god
[30:59] operates by faith amen
[31:01] so these things that the angel told you
[31:04] they're not happening because the angel
[31:06] told you they're happening because you
[31:07] believe what the angel told you
[31:10] amen because it requires faith but faith
[31:14] cometh by hearing hearing the word of
[31:16] god amen so god is using our senses to
[31:19] bring in us amen the quickening power
[31:22] amen to bring the word and then when the
[31:24] words receive the spirit comes on top of
[31:26] the word which is quickening power to
[31:28] make the word live and because you
[31:30] believe it'll be done according to your
[31:33] faith
[31:35] praise god
[31:36] so mary had to receive and believe the
[31:39] angel's message
[31:41] praise god but he used the channel of
[31:44] her mind the womb of her mind
[31:46] your mind is a channel amen
[31:49] let's turn to ephesians chapter 4.
[32:02] ephesians chapter 4
[32:04] verse 17.
[32:12] verse 17 this i say therefore and
[32:14] testify in the lord that ye henceforth
[32:16] walk not as other gentiles walk in the
[32:19] vanity of their mind
[32:21] now something in your mind has to change
[32:25] if paul's paul's saying don't walk like
[32:27] other gentiles in the vanity of your
[32:29] mind you've got to now not allow the
[32:32] vanity of your mind you've got to do
[32:34] something different with your mind
[32:37] having the
[32:38] and then he goes on to describe them
[32:40] having the understand the understanding
[32:43] darkened being alienated from the life
[32:45] of god through the ignorance that is in
[32:47] them because of the blindness of their
[32:48] heart
[32:50] who being past feeling have given
[32:52] themselves over into lasciviousness to
[32:53] work all uncleanness with greediness but
[32:56] you have not so learned christ if so be
[32:58] that you have heard him and have been
[33:00] taught by him as the truth is in jesus
[33:03] that you put off concerning the former
[33:05] conversations the old man which is
[33:06] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[33:09] and be renewed
[33:10] in the spirit of your mind
[33:12] that you that ye put on the new man
[33:15] which after god has created in
[33:16] righteousness and true holiness
[33:19] don't walk as gentiles in the vanity of
[33:21] your mind but be renewed in the spirit
[33:23] of your mind amen what will renew you in
[33:26] the spirit of your mind the word will
[33:27] renew you in the spirit of your mind so
[33:29] don't walk like other gentiles in the
[33:31] vanity of your mind but be renewed in
[33:33] the spirit of your mind by the word amen
[33:37] praise god
[33:39] amen
[33:41] brother baby says in the greatest battle
[33:43] ever fought he says but your mind
[33:45] accepts it it grasps it
[33:47] what is your mind controlled by your
[33:49] spirit your spirit catches the word of
[33:50] god and that's the thing that's got life
[33:52] in it now brother branham when he begins
[33:54] to explain in greatest battle ever
[33:57] fought he
[33:58] he talks about three circles the inside
[34:01] circle amen the outside circle and then
[34:03] the out and then the big circle on the
[34:05] outside and that's body spirit soul but
[34:08] when brother branham comes the greatest
[34:10] battle ever fought he swifts switches
[34:12] the terminology on spirit and soul and
[34:16] he labels it body soul and spirit but
[34:20] that's no problem at all because he
[34:22] doesn't change his doctrine one little
[34:24] drop he only changes terminology but
[34:27] never his doctrine his doctrine remains
[34:30] the same all the way through it's just
[34:32] terminology so don't worry about the
[34:34] terminology now here when he speaks in
[34:37] greatest battle ever thought he already
[34:38] defined the term spirit he means the
[34:41] innermost part of you which later he
[34:43] clarifies in 1964 and 63 64 and 65 to be
[34:48] your soul
[34:49] so you just have to adjust your thinking
[34:51] on the terminology not the doctrine now
[34:53] he's talking about the inside inside
[34:55] inside
[34:58] he says your spirit
[35:00] so he's talking about your soul
[35:03] so what is what is your mind controlled
[35:05] by he says your spirit so what he's
[35:07] referring to that third part down on the
[35:10] inside
[35:12] and your spirit catches the word of god
[35:15] and that's the thing that's got life in
[35:16] it
[35:18] amen what's got life in it the word and
[35:20] the soul
[35:24] it brings life into you oh brother when
[35:26] that takes place when life comes down
[35:28] that channel into you the word of god is
[35:30] manifested into you
[35:32] so it comes through the channel it comes
[35:35] through the mind into the soul
[35:38] and there's a gate to the soul brother
[35:40] bam talks about and that gate is your
[35:42] free will you can accept it or you can
[35:45] reject it
[35:47] it'll come into your mind if you sit
[35:49] through preaching
[35:50] it'll come into your mind if you listen
[35:52] to a tape it'll come into your mind if
[35:54] you read your bible or you read your
[35:55] book but there's a gate there's a
[35:57] channel the channel to the soul is
[36:00] through the mind but there's a gate in
[36:02] that chat in that channel and that gate
[36:04] is your own free choice you can accept
[36:06] it or you can reject it
[36:08] if you accept it as it comes into the
[36:10] mind then it drops into the soul
[36:12] quickens the seed to life amen and
[36:14] begins to express back out through the
[36:17] mind
[36:18] because the mind controls the actions of
[36:20] the body amen so it comes into the
[36:22] channel of the mind it quickens the life
[36:24] and then it's expressed back through the
[36:26] mind because the mind controls the body
[36:28] and now begins to express the word of
[36:30] god manifested in you
[36:32] so there's a channel amen between amen
[36:35] between the the the spirit and the soul
[36:38] and that channel is your mind
[36:41] amen
[36:43] so let's look at first peter chapter 1.
[36:49] first peter chapter 1
[36:51] verse 13.
[36:57] first peter 1
[37:00] 13
[37:01] wherefore
[37:02] gird up the loins of your mind
[37:07] be sober
[37:08] that means steady
[37:11] and hope to the end for the grace that
[37:13] is to be brought unto you at the
[37:14] revelation of jesus christ
[37:16] this gird up the loins of your mind the
[37:18] girdup means to gather up the loose
[37:21] fabric of the robe amen of men as they
[37:23] would work gird up the loin gather it up
[37:25] and bind it up around the hips amen so
[37:28] it's not loose it's not getting caught
[37:30] up and stuff they would gather they
[37:31] would gather up the the loins as they
[37:34] would go to work or as they would run a
[37:36] race amen and now he's telling you don't
[37:38] allow your mind to run loose
[37:42] don't be loose in your mind don't be
[37:44] like gentiles in the vanity of your mind
[37:46] don't be loose amen but gather up the
[37:50] amen gather up let me read it again
[37:53] uh
[37:55] 113 wherefore gird up the loins of your
[37:58] mind and be sober amen don't allow all
[38:01] this crazy thinking amen gather up the
[38:04] loins of your mind and be sober be
[38:07] steady amen be right thinking
[38:09] so there's a there's a commandment here
[38:12] amen not to be loose in our mind not to
[38:15] be vain in our minds and vain in our
[38:17] imaginations amen but we're supposed to
[38:19] gather that together gather the thought
[38:21] life together gather the mind up and be
[38:24] sober amen and be focused and be
[38:26] diligent about how we use the senses
[38:29] amen in our body and our mind and we
[38:31] have to be diligent about what we look
[38:33] at what we hear what we allow to come
[38:35] into the wound of the mind what we what
[38:37] we what we imagine about and think about
[38:40] he said don't let those things run
[38:41] around gather them up
[38:45] amen
[38:47] in the greatest battle ever fought he
[38:49] says that great first battle
[38:51] that was ever fought begin in heaven
[38:54] when michael and his angels fought
[38:56] against lucifer and his angels
[38:58] it it first started the first battle was
[39:01] in heaven
[39:02] so sin did not originate on earth it
[39:04] originated in heaven and then it was
[39:06] thrown down from heaven cast out of
[39:07] heaven to the earth and fell on human
[39:09] beings then the battle from angels
[39:11] became human battles and satan come to
[39:14] destroy god's creation what god had
[39:16] created to be for himself
[39:18] he had he satan came to destroy this
[39:21] that's what his purpose was was to
[39:23] destroy it
[39:25] then the
[39:26] battle began here on earth and begin in
[39:29] us
[39:31] all right let's catch that and has been
[39:33] raging ever since
[39:35] so this great war that broke out in
[39:37] heaven amen and i don't think we will
[39:39] ever i don't think we have even begin to
[39:41] scratch the surface of how terrible that
[39:43] war was in heaven
[39:45] i mean we're talking about war in heaven
[39:48] amen a division amongst the angels and
[39:51] war that broke out in heaven i don't
[39:53] think we will ever realize and then
[39:55] maybe maybe we will someday maybe after
[39:57] a body change but realize what a
[40:00] terrible thing took place in heaven and
[40:02] now cast down to the earth and that same
[40:04] battle rages on but it rages on in us
[40:09] it's not going on over here and over
[40:10] there and over there but that battle has
[40:12] now come to humanity and is raging in us
[40:16] amen so we must be diligent amen we must
[40:20] gird up the loins of our mind and not
[40:22] walk as gentiles in the vanity of our
[40:24] mind because the mind is the channel to
[40:26] the soul it is the womb amen it is
[40:28] something that has to be guarded has to
[40:30] be protected and has to be focused
[40:34] he goes on to say and greatest battle
[40:36] ever fought
[40:39] he says
[40:40] when this great battle started on earth
[40:42] there had to be a mutual meeting place
[40:45] there had to be a place selected for the
[40:47] battle to begin and for the battle to
[40:48] rage
[40:49] and that battlegrounds begin in the
[40:51] human mind
[40:53] there is where the battle starts the
[40:54] human mind was chosen
[40:57] for the place of the battle
[40:59] where it was begin and that is because
[41:01] the decisions are made from the mind the
[41:03] head
[41:03] now they never started it from some
[41:05] organization they never started it from
[41:07] some mechanical affair the grounds never
[41:10] started there therefore the organization
[41:12] can never never do the work of god
[41:14] because the battlegrounds where you've
[41:16] got to meet your enemy is in the mind
[41:20] you've got to make your choice it meets
[41:22] you
[41:23] so this great battleground where these
[41:25] two forces brother ben begins to
[41:26] describe this and greatest battle ever
[41:28] fought where these two opposing armies
[41:30] are testing their strength to see who
[41:31] will be victorious it's taking place in
[41:34] the minds of man
[41:38] let's look at romans chapter 12.
[41:46] romans chapter 12
[41:49] and i'll begin reading in verse 1 romans
[41:51] 12 and 1.
[41:56] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[41:59] mercies of god
[42:01] that you present your bodies a living
[42:03] sacrifice
[42:04] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[42:06] reasonable service
[42:08] and be not conformed to this world but
[42:10] be transformed by the renewing of your
[42:12] mind that you may prove what is that
[42:15] good and acceptable and perfect will
[42:18] have gone
[42:20] amen we've got to watch the mind
[42:25] we talked about last week i don't
[42:27] remember which service it was but they
[42:28] asked jesus what is the greatest
[42:30] commandment of all and jesus said the
[42:32] greatest commandment of all was to
[42:34] the
[42:35] the lord the hero o israel the lord our
[42:38] god is one lord and thou shalt love the
[42:39] lord with all thy heart
[42:42] with all thy soul with all thy mind and
[42:45] with all thy strength
[42:47] this is the first commandment
[42:50] so that means god wants
[42:52] all of our hearts
[42:55] all of our mind
[42:57] all of our soul and all of our strengths
[43:00] he wants all of us
[43:02] remember where the bible says he's a
[43:03] jealous god
[43:05] i believe he's still a jealous god
[43:08] and he wants us all of our mind
[43:12] greatest battle over thought he goes on
[43:13] and says the battle raged when eve
[43:14] opened up her mind
[43:17] to listen to her reasoning that's the
[43:20] flu it come in
[43:22] that's the channel it run down her
[43:24] reasoning she in her soul she reasoned
[43:27] her eyes was sight she saw the serpent
[43:29] he started talking about the senses her
[43:31] eyes were psyched she saw the serpent he
[43:33] was beautiful handsome far better than
[43:35] her own husband he was the most subtle
[43:37] of all the beasts of the field and he
[43:38] was probably a fairer man than her
[43:41] husband he looked like a great masculine
[43:43] beast standing there how great he was
[43:45] and he was trying to tell her what a
[43:47] great thing it was
[43:48] and the first thing she did she opened
[43:50] up her mind and when she did human
[43:53] reasonings caught it why wouldn't that
[43:55] be a thrill
[43:57] that was the thought she had wouldn't
[43:58] that be a thrill he begins first it
[44:01] comes into the mind amen and he begins
[44:03] to appeal to all of these senses then
[44:05] she turns and looks at the tree and sees
[44:07] that it's pleasant to the eye it's good
[44:10] for food it's desirable to make one wise
[44:13] and it begins to appeal to these senses
[44:15] as he opens the channel of her mind and
[44:17] she opens her mind to him to listen to
[44:19] him to his reasonings and all the sudden
[44:22] the fall it brings in the fall amen and
[44:25] we know that that
[44:27] you know the devil hasn't changed his
[44:29] tactics
[44:32] if it ever worked it'll always work
[44:34] like he realized that religion was the
[44:36] best way to keep people close to god and
[44:38] the closer he can keep them the further
[44:40] he can keep them away
[44:42] it was a tremendous tactic to bring
[44:44] religion on the scene and not to try
[44:46] amen to destroy everything god did but
[44:48] just come and try to pervert what god
[44:50] did and he found out in the garden he
[44:52] can come close pervert it amen bring the
[44:54] judgments of god upon it and he can sit
[44:56] as a squatter with squatters rights and
[44:58] begin to rule over the earth amen so
[45:00] they did the same thing to the jewish
[45:01] church he did the same thing to the
[45:03] church in eden he did the same thing to
[45:05] the jewish church he did the same thing
[45:06] to the gentile church
[45:09] and because it worked he always does the
[45:10] same thing
[45:12] and the battlefield is in the mind amen
[45:15] and god begins to uh begins to admonish
[45:18] us not to have a loose mind to be
[45:20] diligent about our mind to be
[45:22] transformed in the mind don't go after
[45:24] the vanity of the mind so the scripture
[45:26] is always giving us this admonition amen
[45:29] to guard our mind amen and brother bran
[45:31] begins to explain it to us in greatest
[45:33] battle ever fought and i think it
[45:34] behooves us to hear what he says and not
[45:37] forget some of these simple things
[45:39] because it's the little foxes that spoil
[45:40] the vine
[45:42] so many times the things that trip us up
[45:44] amen are not the the great big things
[45:47] the things that are flashing red lights
[45:49] of sin amen but the little foxes spoil
[45:52] the vine the little gaps the little
[45:54] things left undone the the little the
[45:57] the little areas that we leave a door
[45:59] open amen for the devil to creep into
[46:01] and begin to work in our imagination and
[46:03] in our thoughts and in our affections
[46:05] and next thing you know amen we we we
[46:08] have to snap ourselves out of something
[46:10] and say what is going on with me and we
[46:12] didn't realize amen that i wasn't
[46:14] diligent about gathering up the loins of
[46:16] my mind
[46:19] and we have to be diligent in this day
[46:20] because there's never been a day amen
[46:23] that we know of amen noah's day was like
[46:25] this day brother madam said i don't know
[46:27] what kind of devices they had and what
[46:29] kind of access they had amen but i know
[46:32] what we have in this day
[46:34] and whatever access they had in their
[46:36] day made the imaginations of their
[46:38] thoughts evil
[46:40] continually we've come right back to
[46:43] that place in the world
[46:45] whatever access they have
[46:47] has brought this world their minds
[46:51] evil continually
[46:54] remember god everything in the kingdom
[46:56] of god operates by faith faith cometh by
[46:58] hearing the word
[47:00] so
[47:01] brother branham said
[47:02] god will have a civilization amen but it
[47:05] won't be a civilization a science and it
[47:07] won't be anything like this civilization
[47:09] of the politics and science and
[47:11] corruption he'll have a civilization but
[47:13] that civilization will be based on faith
[47:15] amen that's what the garden was based
[47:18] off the garden of eden was based off
[47:19] faith amen the next civilization will be
[47:21] based off faith that's why this one is
[47:23] based off science man's thoughts his
[47:25] reasoning his achievements and that
[47:28] would this that's why he says this is of
[47:29] the devil amen that next one will be a
[47:32] different kind of civilization all
[47:33] together
[47:35] he said do you think we'll have
[47:36] automobiles and airplanes in that one no
[47:38] way amen we won't need it amen because
[47:41] it'll operate by faith
[47:43] but listen
[47:44] god wants a people who now operate by
[47:47] faith that are going to live in that
[47:48] civilization this is our training for
[47:51] reigning in that civilization so we have
[47:53] to begin to operate by faith and to
[47:56] operate by faith we don't operate by
[47:58] science amen we have to begin to operate
[48:00] by faith
[48:02] amen amen
[48:04] praise be to god
[48:07] and so in order to operate by faith
[48:10] you've got to guard your mind
[48:14] amen i was doing thinking on this
[48:17] imagination and and all of the uh
[48:20] the bombardment that we have almost 24 7
[48:24] by all
[48:25] by communications by internet by
[48:28] whatsapp messages and whatever social
[48:30] medias and news and all of these other
[48:32] things amen and and you know we all
[48:35] carry a phone
[48:37] and and listen i'm going to tell you
[48:39] right up front i'm not telling you to
[48:40] throw your phone away
[48:42] i'm not going to get rid of my phone any
[48:44] more than i'm going to get rid of my car
[48:46] because in the world we live in today
[48:49] amen everything now needs an access
[48:51] point
[48:52] you can't do your banking you can't
[48:54] there's so many things that you can't do
[48:55] anymore and i mean pretty soon i don't
[48:58] even know i mean i still get out my
[49:00] wallet and i take out money
[49:05] and i've become an odd person
[49:09] like i like to hand people money and now
[49:12] cashiers they get a little annoyed with
[49:14] you if you hand the money it's like
[49:18] i'm going to have to count back change
[49:23] they use the credit card now they use
[49:25] something on their phone i don't even
[49:26] know what that is and i don't ever want
[49:28] to know but i probably someday will have
[49:29] to know
[49:31] i'm being reluctantly dragged in to
[49:34] technology
[49:35] i like paper
[49:37] i like pens
[49:38] i like writing down notes
[49:41] i'm archaic i'm a dinosaur and i like it
[49:44] that way
[49:45] but listen we're not going to have a
[49:47] cell phone in the millennium
[49:51] but i'm not going to need a notepad
[49:52] either because i'm going to have the
[49:53] right kind of mind i'll remember
[49:55] something over there
[49:56] i can actually remember more than two
[49:58] items at a time probably when i get over
[50:00] there
[50:03] but one thing i realized
[50:05] for me
[50:07] is it's so easy
[50:10] to allow this access point
[50:12] which we need in life i'm not preaching
[50:14] against it because it's necessary listen
[50:16] i'm not going to preach against facebook
[50:18] i'm not going to preach against whatsapp
[50:20] so you can rest easy i'm not going to
[50:21] touch on anything like that and say you
[50:23] got to get rid of this and you got to
[50:25] get rid of that i'm not going to i'm not
[50:26] going to tell you that because this is
[50:28] the world we live in but what i am going
[50:29] to tell you is you better gird up the
[50:31] loins of your mind
[50:33] you better be very aware that the devil
[50:36] has a tactic amen and brother banham
[50:38] says the pentecostals used not to let
[50:40] their children go to the picture show
[50:41] but the devil brought one in and he
[50:43] brought it right in your house
[50:45] well i mean you just fill in the rest of
[50:47] the sentence i'm not going to tell you
[50:49] you know the rest of it
[50:51] you know and so this isn't a message of
[50:53] condemnation
[50:54] this is a message of encouragement
[50:56] because what we need to know is how
[50:57] dangerous this device is amen not
[51:00] dangerous because i'm going to get lured
[51:02] into sin amen i don't believe amen
[51:05] because the god's given us the holy
[51:07] ghost that just because i have a cell
[51:09] phone with access in my pocket amen i've
[51:11] had it for years it's not luring me into
[51:13] sin it's not driving me into evilness
[51:16] and wickedness but what it's doing is
[51:18] it's polluting my mind amen it's filling
[51:21] my head full of garbage
[51:24] it is taking the senses that god wants
[51:26] to use to speak to me the word of god
[51:28] and it's so full of news and so full of
[51:31] information and i mean it's all the time
[51:34] there's a notification going off
[51:38] a notification
[51:39] a contact point a question
[51:42] a testimony a video from overseas none
[51:46] of these things are evil
[51:48] not one of them are evil
[51:50] amen there's news to watch and there's
[51:52] the weather to check but i started
[51:54] thinking a little while ago i said why
[51:56] do i need to know the weather every hour
[51:59] and a half
[52:04] like i find myself checking the weather
[52:07] like
[52:08] it hasn't changed
[52:11] i'm outside
[52:17] the other day my wife told me it was
[52:18] raining i was back in my office there's
[52:20] no windows in my office at home said
[52:21] it's raining i said no it's not the
[52:22] weather said it's not raining
[52:25] my phone says it's not raining it's not
[52:26] raining and she just looked at the water
[52:28] running down the window she said it's
[52:29] raining
[52:30] it's not planning
[52:36] and you realize
[52:39] how subtle this thing is
[52:42] not wickedness not evil not debauchery
[52:46] but plugging the channel that god wants
[52:48] to use to bring the word
[52:50] just filling it up with just stuff
[52:55] somebody bought a new car
[52:58] somebody's going on vacation
[53:01] somebody just bought a new whatever
[53:03] whatever
[53:05] i i mean
[53:06] not evil
[53:07] not wicked
[53:09] somebody just passed out bibles in
[53:11] another country somebody and wanted to
[53:14] say hello somebody said happy birthday
[53:17] and i got to find out what the weather
[53:18] is because it might have changed an hour
[53:20] ago
[53:21] and then i better check my email while
[53:23] i'm here checking my weather just in
[53:24] case somebody's trying to get a hold of
[53:26] me and the next thing i know flip flip
[53:27] flip flip flip flip flip 30 minutes are
[53:30] gone and i have received so much
[53:32] information that i did not need in any
[53:35] way shape or form did not change
[53:37] anything and did zero to build faith
[53:40] inside of me because faith cometh by the
[53:42] word not by news not by weather amen not
[53:45] by pictures of somebody's grandchild
[53:47] amen none of that will bring faith only
[53:50] the word will bring faith
[53:52] and i've got to operate by faith not
[53:54] news i've got to operate by faith not
[53:57] not financial projections i've got to
[53:58] operate by faith amen by faith and all
[54:01] of these things are filling our minds
[54:04] with information and it's actually
[54:06] weakening our minds and it's actually
[54:09] subtly taking away our ability to hear
[54:12] from god all the time
[54:15] i've been with people before
[54:17] amen
[54:18] and and they they check their phone like
[54:20] they have nervous ticks
[54:28] it's like what's changed
[54:31] and nothing i don't think they're doing
[54:33] anything evil
[54:35] i trust i trust the believers it's not
[54:38] evil
[54:40] but god
[54:41] god is going to the battle is in the
[54:44] mind
[54:45] so the devil has found a way
[54:48] to fill the mind
[54:51] so that those the the god doesn't have
[54:53] as much access
[54:57] amen you know
[54:59] i was thinking about the process of
[55:00] coming to church
[55:02] when we come to church
[55:04] we either silence our phone turn it off
[55:06] or leave it somewhere else
[55:08] and the prophet of god told us come 30
[55:10] minutes early to church to get your your
[55:12] spirit quiet
[55:14] so we come to church early amen and we
[55:17] begin to pray and we begin to meditate
[55:19] and on the way to church we're thinking
[55:21] about church
[55:22] we're wondering about you know what will
[55:24] the sermon be like today and we're
[55:26] thinking about church and maybe your
[55:28] thoughts are on the what was preached
[55:29] last time will be a continuation will be
[55:30] something else and so we're coming as we
[55:33] come to church we're starting to align
[55:35] our senses
[55:37] our memory of last service our thoughts
[55:40] our imagination of what might be
[55:42] preached
[55:43] then we come into the service and we
[55:46] quiet ourselves down and we begin to
[55:48] focus on what's about to happen begin to
[55:50] pray begin to meditate read our bibles
[55:52] read the message amen and then all of a
[55:54] sudden the musicians come out and they
[55:55] begin to create an atmosphere which you
[55:57] hear in your ears
[55:59] and all the senses
[56:01] what church is doing is aligning all of
[56:03] our senses to one focal point
[56:07] our feeling our hearing i mean
[56:09] everything our thought life everything
[56:12] begins to align
[56:14] and then after the song leader comes out
[56:16] we all begin to sing we begin to sing
[56:18] the same songs and the songs are about
[56:20] the word and the songs are about the
[56:22] lord the songs are about our position
[56:24] with him and what's it doing it's
[56:25] bringing the imagination it's bringing
[56:27] the thoughts it's bringing the
[56:28] affections everything begins to line up
[56:32] and then we come to the preaching of the
[56:34] word amen then god begins to speak
[56:36] through the preaching of the word amen
[56:38] and we receive something he begins to
[56:40] talk to us repeat our sentences back to
[56:42] us answer the questions that we came
[56:44] with and god begins to speak to us amen
[56:47] and then afterwards amen we we have time
[56:49] of worship and a time of prayer and we
[56:51] begin to thank god for what he's done
[56:53] and meditate on what we've heard and let
[56:55] it soak in and we walk out of here and
[56:57] we say god was speaking directly to me
[56:59] in that service and and i'm here to tell
[57:01] you that's a wonderful thing but i don't
[57:03] think this is the only place that god
[57:05] wants to speak to his children
[57:07] i believe if we can do the same thing
[57:10] elsewhere we can receive the same thing
[57:12] from god i believe god wants to speak
[57:15] through the channel of the mind i
[57:16] believe god wants to tell us amen what
[57:18] his plan is what he wants us to do i
[57:21] believe god wants fellowship with you
[57:23] and i
[57:24] yeah but how many times amen do you go
[57:28] to read your bible and then you go to to
[57:31] prayer and all of a sudden notification
[57:35] and somebody's sick notification
[57:38] somebody's engaged notification
[57:41] somebody's traveling
[57:43] and then all of a sudden you're trying
[57:45] to pray but actually what you're doing
[57:47] is saying god i love you help me with my
[57:49] day and in your imagination you're
[57:51] rolling through all of those
[57:52] notifications
[57:55] i mean i hope i'm not the only person
[57:57] that this happens to
[58:00] all of a sudden and so there's words but
[58:02] there's no connection
[58:05] there's words but there's no prayer
[58:08] amen
[58:09] god's not after words
[58:11] you can only contact him by faith
[58:16] so
[58:18] for me this is just me personally i'm
[58:20] not telling anybody else what to do this
[58:22] is just me this is what i found
[58:24] when i wake up in the morning i leave my
[58:26] phone
[58:27] back by my bedside because it's my alarm
[58:29] clock and i go to prayer and i go to
[58:31] read my bible without my phone
[58:34] because too many times goes off goes off
[58:37] goes off and even if i don't check it
[58:39] i'm already wondering what it is
[58:42] could it be this and could it be that
[58:43] and
[58:44] nothing evil there's nothing evil going
[58:46] on nothing wicked nothing ungodly
[58:49] nothing contrary to the word of god
[58:52] but my mind is already distracted
[58:56] at the time when it should be focused
[59:00] and for me this is just me like i say
[59:03] i'm not giving any commandments
[59:05] but i like a bible amen
[59:08] and i'll tell you why
[59:11] a lot of people use their phone or
[59:12] whatever to read the bible and that's
[59:14] fine there's a daily devotion my wife
[59:15] and i do i do on the phone amen but for
[59:18] me personally i like a bible
[59:20] because when i pick up this bible
[59:22] there's only one function for this bible
[59:25] it does nothing else this bible doesn't
[59:27] tell me the weather it doesn't tell me
[59:30] who's getting married it doesn't tell me
[59:31] who's having a good day and who's on
[59:33] vacation and all this bible does is give
[59:36] me the word which will give me faith
[59:38] and when i pick this up i'm singularly
[59:41] focused on the word of god and there are
[59:43] no interruptions no notification you say
[59:46] well i don't check them you don't have
[59:47] to check them bing bing and then
[59:48] the name pops up at the top and you know
[59:50] oh man
[59:51] i'll answer her later
[59:54] and you go back to reading what are you
[59:55] reading
[59:57] what impact is it
[59:58] having you're thinking about who you got
[1:00:00] to remember to call back later
[1:00:03] right
[1:00:04] so for me
[1:00:06] i like a message book
[1:00:09] because there's only one purpose for
[1:00:11] that book
[1:00:12] i'm going to read the message
[1:00:14] i mean you can still use whatever device
[1:00:16] you want i'm not against it i mean i
[1:00:18] read the message on my my phone all the
[1:00:20] time amen i read the bible on my phone
[1:00:22] i've got an app that i use for the
[1:00:24] concordance on my bible all the time
[1:00:25] when i'm talking to you i will always
[1:00:26] use it i'm not against that but i'm
[1:00:28] telling you i've had to take steps
[1:00:30] myself to gird up the loins of my mind
[1:00:34] because i realize leaving this mind
[1:00:36] loose is not working to build any more
[1:00:39] faith in me
[1:00:40] it's the distractions polluting the
[1:00:42] channel of the mind that god wants to
[1:00:45] use to get to my soul to unlock the
[1:00:47] faith that's laying there
[1:00:49] so this isn't about this isn't about
[1:00:51] everybody lining up and you all throw
[1:00:53] this away and you all get that no
[1:00:54] absolutely not friends i'm telling you
[1:00:56] what i've had to do myself amen to gird
[1:00:59] up the loins in my mind
[1:01:01] because the other was not working
[1:01:04] i mean it worked partially i mean i
[1:01:05] still read the bible and i did devotions
[1:01:09] but now
[1:01:11] i need
[1:01:12] quiet
[1:01:15] undistracted
[1:01:16] intentional
[1:01:18] focused
[1:01:19] time
[1:01:20] to put my mind to the purpose of hearing
[1:01:23] god's word
[1:01:28] man
[1:01:29] i'll just ask you because i've been
[1:01:30] through all of this lately
[1:01:33] when was the last time
[1:01:35] you just
[1:01:36] meditated on the lord
[1:01:40] for 20 30 minutes
[1:01:42] no other noise no music playing nothing
[1:01:46] audio all by yourself
[1:01:48] when was the last time and not a list of
[1:01:50] prayer requests when was the last time
[1:01:53] you just let your thoughts focus on god
[1:01:55] and meditate on him for a period of time
[1:02:00] i mean sometimes we get in our car and
[1:02:02] we have to have noise all the time
[1:02:03] stimulation stimulation stimulation
[1:02:05] because we live in a world where we've
[1:02:06] been overly stimulated
[1:02:09] all of the senses have been stimulated
[1:02:11] non-stop visually stimulating audio
[1:02:13] stimulated stimulation stimulation
[1:02:15] stimulation so that when everything goes
[1:02:16] quiet
[1:02:18] we feel a little bit weird awkward
[1:02:22] i don't think god wants it to be awkward
[1:02:24] when we get quiet
[1:02:28] i don't think
[1:02:30] i i i think
[1:02:32] god is a gentleman
[1:02:34] he never screams and shouts for
[1:02:36] attention
[1:02:38] he's patient and he's a gentleman
[1:02:41] amen and he has to be invited even when
[1:02:44] jesus was speaking to them on the road
[1:02:45] to emmaus he was going to walk by until
[1:02:47] he was invited in
[1:02:50] and for me i've had to i've had to gird
[1:02:53] up the loins in my mind
[1:02:55] and say i'm not throwing away my
[1:02:57] smartphone
[1:02:59] there's a lot of it i need to function a
[1:03:01] lot of work i need to do i'm not
[1:03:03] throwing away i'm not suggesting you
[1:03:04] throw it away
[1:03:05] but what i am saying is we better be
[1:03:07] careful
[1:03:09] we better pay attention we better wake
[1:03:11] up and realize that the battle is in the
[1:03:14] mind and the word is coming through the
[1:03:17] mind through the soul amen in the and
[1:03:19] the devil's message is coming in the
[1:03:20] mind and he's trying to block the
[1:03:22] channel to the soul amen and doesn't
[1:03:25] want that word to be expressed in you
[1:03:26] and i and there's a battle raging in our
[1:03:28] mind and we better pick which side we're
[1:03:30] going to be on
[1:03:33] and say you know what i'm not going to
[1:03:35] take this distraction i'm not any longer
[1:03:37] going to waste this time i'm no longer
[1:03:40] let's read a scripture first corinthians
[1:03:42] let's go to first corinthians this will
[1:03:44] embody what i'm hopefully will embody
[1:03:46] what i'm trying to say
[1:03:48] first corinthians chapter six
[1:03:52] first corinthians chapter six
[1:03:54] and i want to read verse 12.
[1:03:59] all things are lawful
[1:04:02] unto me
[1:04:03] but all things are not expedient that
[1:04:06] means profitable
[1:04:08] all things are lawful for me
[1:04:10] but i will not be brought under the
[1:04:13] power of any
[1:04:15] let's make this our cry
[1:04:18] i'm not doing evil i'm not doing wrong
[1:04:21] i'm not committing sin all things are
[1:04:23] lawful unto me but all things are not
[1:04:25] expedient for me
[1:04:28] all things are lawful unto me but i will
[1:04:31] not be brought under the power of any i
[1:04:34] will not let this thing plug up the
[1:04:36] channel that god wants to use to speak
[1:04:37] his word to me i will not give my mind
[1:04:40] to such as that 24 hours a day i will
[1:04:43] not give all my waking time and my
[1:04:45] attentiveness to that amen so that it
[1:04:48] can plug up my mind and begin to reduce
[1:04:50] my ability to hear from god and receive
[1:04:52] the word i will not be brought under the
[1:04:55] power of that although it's not sin it's
[1:04:57] not wrong i don't have to get rid of it
[1:05:00] amen
[1:05:01] but i will not be brought under the
[1:05:02] power of that
[1:05:04] this is overcoming time
[1:05:07] this is an overcoming people
[1:05:09] in the midst of satan's eden when
[1:05:11] satan's eating come to its pinnacle to
[1:05:13] its peak and everything is available
[1:05:15] everything that you ever want amen
[1:05:18] anything that you can imagine amen it
[1:05:20] can be available to you amen but you
[1:05:23] won't be brought under the power of any
[1:05:24] because there's been a bride that's been
[1:05:26] awakened to the word in this day and she
[1:05:28] will overcome every one of satan's
[1:05:30] tricks and tactics she will prevail she
[1:05:34] will amen by free choice give god the
[1:05:36] best time give god her might not by
[1:05:39] force not because somebody beat him over
[1:05:41] the head with the word and made him so
[1:05:42] guilty that they wanted to do this and
[1:05:44] that amen but just somebody said hey
[1:05:46] watch your mind watch what god wants to
[1:05:49] do god wants to speak to you and there's
[1:05:50] a little bride so in love with him that
[1:05:53] says if he wants to speak to me then i
[1:05:55] want to be quiet and hear what he has to
[1:05:57] say
[1:05:58] i want to be focused i want to be
[1:06:00] dedicated i want to be diligent because
[1:06:02] if he wants to speak to me i want to
[1:06:04] hear what he's saying
[1:06:07] there's not about guilt this is not
[1:06:09] condemnation amen this is not this
[1:06:11] affects every single one of us
[1:06:14] but we have to be aware it affects us
[1:06:17] and we've got to be willing to take
[1:06:19] action amen
[1:06:20] i found out that i don't need my phone
[1:06:22] with me all the time
[1:06:24] what an awful idea
[1:06:29] i mean
[1:06:31] you know the boys have dumb phones these
[1:06:33] little dumb flip phones
[1:06:35] it's it's the it's the bane of their
[1:06:37] existence it's an embarrassment in this
[1:06:39] world today to pull out an old phone and
[1:06:41] flip it open
[1:06:43] it's like the badge of shame
[1:06:47] but they don't need anything else
[1:06:49] i want to be able to communicate with
[1:06:51] them i want to know where they're at
[1:06:52] that's all they need
[1:06:56] then one of the girls says you know you
[1:06:58] really should get maybe a smartphone to
[1:07:00] think about you know routing directions
[1:07:02] so they'd know how to drive because it'd
[1:07:04] be safer that way
[1:07:07] i said listen i didn't have a mapping
[1:07:10] feature when i got my license
[1:07:12] i didn't have a phone i didn't have a
[1:07:14] pager
[1:07:15] and i survived
[1:07:18] we made it through
[1:07:20] when i was a boy we didn't even have
[1:07:21] seat belts in our car
[1:07:25] like well you got to have this and you
[1:07:27] got to have that and you got to have
[1:07:29] this and all of a sudden you're like
[1:07:31] who's this dictating what i have to have
[1:07:34] and what i don't have to have
[1:07:36] now of course i want them to be safe so
[1:07:38] we bought one of those little garmin
[1:07:40] things
[1:07:41] that you stick on the window that you
[1:07:42] can't do anything else but see
[1:07:43] directions
[1:07:44] so they were perfectly safe
[1:07:48] but you understand the world
[1:07:51] everything's shifting this way
[1:07:54] and
[1:07:55] i like my mapping feature
[1:07:58] i enjoy it i got tired of getting out of
[1:08:01] the car and asking directions
[1:08:03] going into the gas station do you know
[1:08:04] where such and such a street is
[1:08:07] i like my mapping feature i'm not going
[1:08:08] to get rid of it i'm going to keep using
[1:08:10] it
[1:08:12] but i'm not going to be brought under
[1:08:13] the power of this thing
[1:08:16] i
[1:08:17] i realized you know when covert broke
[1:08:19] out and all that thing was going on amen
[1:08:21] i was watching news and there was a
[1:08:23] certain necessity to watching news
[1:08:24] because things were changing and as a
[1:08:26] church we needed to know what
[1:08:27] requirements were and what laws were
[1:08:29] changing and there was a certain
[1:08:31] requirement but i realized that during
[1:08:33] that process i got in the habit of
[1:08:34] watching news
[1:08:36] and my mind was filled and i always
[1:08:38] wanted to make sure something hadn't
[1:08:40] changed so i would watch 20 minutes to
[1:08:42] realize nothing changed
[1:08:46] and then at the end of the day i'd watch
[1:08:47] 20-30 minutes to realize nothing changed
[1:08:50] and then the next day i'd watch 30
[1:08:51] minutes to realize nothing changed hey
[1:08:53] guess what nothing's changing
[1:08:56] and so i realized what was happening i
[1:08:58] said no more i don't need that anymore
[1:09:00] and i quit and then when the war in
[1:09:02] ukraine broke out all of a sudden we
[1:09:03] want to know what's going on fulfilled
[1:09:05] prophecy what brother ben said about
[1:09:06] russia could this be it could this be
[1:09:08] that and so we're interested we're
[1:09:09] curious because of the word so we begin
[1:09:11] to watch the news and and then all of a
[1:09:13] sudden you know some drastic things are
[1:09:15] changing believers are fleeing it's
[1:09:17] affecting some of the people that we
[1:09:19] know and there's news but then it gets
[1:09:21] into then very quickly it moves into the
[1:09:23] repetition of the same thing every day i
[1:09:26] mean the name of the city is different
[1:09:27] and who did what is slightly changed
[1:09:32] but it becomes a thief
[1:09:34] that steals my mind
[1:09:37] and i recognize what was happening he
[1:09:39] said i don't need that anymore and it
[1:09:41] wasn't like i was watching all day i
[1:09:42] might have watched 30 minutes a day
[1:09:45] but but then you think about it after
[1:09:48] that
[1:09:49] and then the things that are said and
[1:09:50] the images that are there they have an
[1:09:52] effect on you things that you see and
[1:09:55] things that you hear they affect you and
[1:09:57] they don't leave you immediately when
[1:09:59] you shut the phone you shut it off and
[1:10:01] you put it down you got the news you
[1:10:02] needed but what you heard and what you
[1:10:04] saw remain rolling around in there for
[1:10:07] quite a period of time
[1:10:09] and sometimes it could even pop up weeks
[1:10:10] later or years later and i'm telling you
[1:10:13] i am older now i'm not old but i'm older
[1:10:16] now and i have limited capacity to store
[1:10:18] information
[1:10:22] and i cannot waste what precious
[1:10:25] resources i have
[1:10:28] upstairs on things that make zero
[1:10:31] difference for me in my daily life i
[1:10:34] will still amen i will still
[1:10:37] get up in the morning go through the
[1:10:39] same exact routine come into the office
[1:10:41] read the message amen all the news that
[1:10:44] has happened
[1:10:46] has it changed anything in your life in
[1:10:48] the last six months nothing's changed
[1:10:52] all that i was doing was hearing about
[1:10:54] what's happening somewhere else in other
[1:10:55] cities and other names and i was still
[1:10:57] had to go through the same routine only
[1:10:59] i was going through the same routine
[1:11:01] more distracted
[1:11:04] i'm saying we can't live this way
[1:11:07] we've got to be focused friends
[1:11:09] we
[1:11:10] the devil is constantly after the bride
[1:11:13] trying to trip her up and god is
[1:11:14] constantly trying to lead us we don't
[1:11:16] have time for this
[1:11:19] the what we're called to is
[1:11:21] it's too important amen
[1:11:23] what god wants to do in us amen is so
[1:11:26] critical in this hour that we have to be
[1:11:28] tuned in amen the dial's got to be tuned
[1:11:31] in to the right frequency and it's got
[1:11:33] to stay there amen
[1:11:35] let's turn to matthew chapter 6.
[1:11:50] matthew chapter 6.
[1:11:57] and verse 22
[1:12:02] matthew chapter 6 verse 22
[1:12:05] the light of the body is the eye
[1:12:08] if therefore thine i be single thy whole
[1:12:10] body shall be full of light
[1:12:14] that i looked up i
[1:12:16] this word i
[1:12:17] in the greek and in the concordance when
[1:12:19] it gives the description of i it says
[1:12:21] the i
[1:12:22] metaphorically the eyes of the mind the
[1:12:25] faculty of knowing
[1:12:28] now let's go back and read it with the
[1:12:29] concordance description metaphorically
[1:12:32] the eye of the mind the faculty of
[1:12:34] knowing
[1:12:35] if the light of the body
[1:12:37] is the eye or the mind
[1:12:43] if therefore thine eye be single that
[1:12:45] means focused
[1:12:47] on one thing if it be single the whole
[1:12:51] body shall be full of light
[1:12:53] or what light are we talking about we're
[1:12:55] not talking about sunlight friends we're
[1:12:57] talking about illumination the word of
[1:12:59] god
[1:13:01] but if thine eye be evil thy whole body
[1:13:04] shall be full of darkness if therefore
[1:13:06] the light that is in thee be darkness
[1:13:08] how great is that darkness
[1:13:12] i i don't want any more darkness coming
[1:13:15] in
[1:13:16] i mean you can't you drive down the road
[1:13:18] messages billboards messages information
[1:13:21] you walk through stores there's
[1:13:22] information everywhere it's on racks
[1:13:24] it's coming from other people i mean
[1:13:26] it's you're inundated with information
[1:13:28] you go to work and you you work with
[1:13:30] geniuses who knows what's going on in
[1:13:32] the world
[1:13:34] they know everything and they're willing
[1:13:36] to tell you all about it
[1:13:38] they know what's problem with the
[1:13:39] government they know what the solution
[1:13:41] will be they they they know they know
[1:13:43] everything they know what is really
[1:13:45] about
[1:13:48] right
[1:13:50] that's why they're working next to you
[1:13:52] is because they're so smart they got it
[1:13:54] all figured they're undercover
[1:13:56] they're really they could run the whole
[1:13:58] world but they're just working next to
[1:13:59] you just so nobody else knows
[1:14:03] people crack me up
[1:14:05] the world is funny
[1:14:08] but you're inundated with information
[1:14:11] and it's all from a civilization of
[1:14:13] unbelief
[1:14:16] all of it is unbelief the message is at
[1:14:18] work what you run into in the store
[1:14:20] what's on the magazine racks what's
[1:14:22] coming through the news amen it's all
[1:14:25] unbelief
[1:14:26] from a civilization is unbelief and it
[1:14:29] is none of it taking us to the
[1:14:31] civilization of faith
[1:14:33] none of it is preparing us amen these
[1:14:35] are things we have to overcome we have
[1:14:38] to avoid at all costs amen and i'm stuck
[1:14:41] right in the middle of satan's eating
[1:14:42] but god knew i would be here amen and
[1:14:45] god knew my senses would be battled all
[1:14:47] day and bombarded all day with lies and
[1:14:50] unbelief and lies and unbelief so what
[1:14:53] did god do in this day when our senses
[1:14:55] of sight and senses of hearing we're
[1:14:57] going to be inundated with unbelief god
[1:15:00] amen brought a prophet up in a day when
[1:15:02] he would have an audio recording we'd
[1:15:04] have books printed we'd have videos of
[1:15:06] him deep called to the demon 20th
[1:15:08] century prophet so as satan's inundating
[1:15:11] the senses god has provided something
[1:15:13] for the senses amen you can read the
[1:15:16] book you can listen to the tape you can
[1:15:18] watch the video you can be singly
[1:15:20] focused god has provided what we need to
[1:15:23] overcome
[1:15:24] this lying deceptive civilization
[1:15:28] god is so good he hasn't left us lacking
[1:15:31] anything friends there has never been
[1:15:33] this much recorded information from a
[1:15:36] prophet's ministry everywhere in the
[1:15:38] history of the world and no no other
[1:15:40] ages how much do you have about jeremiah
[1:15:42] how much do you know about isaiah amen
[1:15:44] even paul's writings is very limited
[1:15:48] but here we have the majority of a
[1:15:51] lifetime of a prophet of god on earth
[1:15:53] and we watched his life we watched his
[1:15:55] character we heard him preach in
[1:15:57] multitudes of situations and explain
[1:16:00] numerous doctrines amen and we can all
[1:16:02] receive it in our senses the same senses
[1:16:05] the devil is trying to use to plug our
[1:16:07] mind if we'll it will move that junk
[1:16:10] away from our mind and be singly focused
[1:16:13] amen if our mind will be single on this
[1:16:16] message amen we will get everything we
[1:16:18] need to overcome i don't need
[1:16:20] information amen from the news to
[1:16:22] overcome laodicea
[1:16:25] i need this message to overcome laodicea
[1:16:32] the news is not helping me overcome
[1:16:36] it's not giving me that tip
[1:16:38] that insider bit of information
[1:16:41] no everything i need is coming from this
[1:16:43] message
[1:16:46] everything that i need to fulfill god's
[1:16:49] purpose in my life
[1:16:51] to accomplish what he's called me for
[1:16:53] and to receive a body change and to move
[1:16:56] into the the millennium everything that
[1:16:59] i need is in the message
[1:17:03] nothing outside of that
[1:17:05] will produce faith in me
[1:17:09] so what do we want to spend the most
[1:17:11] time with
[1:17:14] i'll ask you another question and i'm
[1:17:16] not just asking to you i've asked them
[1:17:17] to myself
[1:17:20] when was the last time you just drove
[1:17:22] down the road by yourself in a car with
[1:17:25] no noise
[1:17:26] no radio no music no nothing
[1:17:30] and just talk to god
[1:17:33] not even pray like a traditional prayer
[1:17:36] but just say
[1:17:37] god i love you
[1:17:40] god i love you
[1:17:42] and i'm so thankful for you
[1:17:45] see i think that should be our life
[1:17:49] that should be our daily life that
[1:17:52] should be how the bride lives amen
[1:17:54] but the devil's trick is to keep the
[1:17:56] noise going
[1:17:58] keep the noise keep the information keep
[1:18:00] the flashing lights keep the keep it all
[1:18:03] of it amen keep it going keep it going
[1:18:05] keep it going until we're so strung out
[1:18:07] on that stuff as soon as it goes quiet
[1:18:10] we're looking for a button to push
[1:18:11] somewhere
[1:18:14] uh you know what i don't want any more
[1:18:16] buttons
[1:18:18] i i started in the evening time now i've
[1:18:21] had several times in the evening time
[1:18:22] where i just go and i take my phone and
[1:18:24] i lay it on the dresser or my nightstand
[1:18:26] because my alarm clock
[1:18:29] in the last couple hours of the day i
[1:18:31] have no phone
[1:18:34] and the world has not quit spinning
[1:18:37] there has been no emergency that needed
[1:18:39] my immediate attention where folks would
[1:18:41] have died or
[1:18:44] i realized you know what else i started
[1:18:46] doing
[1:18:47] when i'm going out running errands and
[1:18:49] i'm going to run into the bank and i'm
[1:18:50] going to run into the storm pick
[1:18:51] something up i realize that i can leave
[1:18:53] my phone in my truck
[1:18:56] you know what happened when i left my
[1:18:58] phone in my truck
[1:19:00] whenever i would go into the store and
[1:19:02] you go to the bank and all of a sudden
[1:19:03] you didn't expect it but now there's a
[1:19:05] line
[1:19:07] and the person in front of you runs some
[1:19:08] sort of business because they want 5 000
[1:19:10] ones
[1:19:11] and 100 tins
[1:19:15] and you're standing here
[1:19:16] and the first thing you do is stick your
[1:19:18] hand in your pocket and pull it out and
[1:19:19] make sure nobody texts you and nobody
[1:19:20] emailed you and we're trying to get
[1:19:23] something done while we're standing in
[1:19:25] line
[1:19:26] and all we're doing is putting more
[1:19:28] stuff in the mind
[1:19:31] that doesn't need to be there
[1:19:34] hey listen we don't need to be more
[1:19:35] efficient we don't need to multitask
[1:19:39] if your mind be single
[1:19:42] that's not multitasking
[1:19:45] if your mind be focused
[1:19:47] your whole body shall be full of life
[1:19:50] there's times we have to multitask we
[1:19:52] have to work we have to get things done
[1:19:54] but i think there should be times that
[1:19:55] we're not multitasking
[1:19:57] i think there should be times that we
[1:19:59] let our mind go quiet
[1:20:01] and let the noise shut the noise down
[1:20:04] and just focus our attention on god and
[1:20:07] his word
[1:20:08] it's the only thing that'll overcome
[1:20:10] satan's
[1:20:12] nothing else is going to work
[1:20:14] and we always think this is me i always
[1:20:16] think this is a busy day tomorrow will
[1:20:18] be different
[1:20:20] it's a busy day tomorrow will be
[1:20:21] different it's a busy day tomorrow how
[1:20:23] many times have you had a busy day but
[1:20:25] you knew tomorrow would be different
[1:20:27] i'll have a little more time tomorrow
[1:20:29] i'll be a little more quiet it never
[1:20:32] happens
[1:20:35] and i'm tired of deferring my time with
[1:20:37] the lord to another day
[1:20:39] when i'm less busy why should god wait
[1:20:41] for me to get less busy
[1:20:43] he's the creator of heaven and earth why
[1:20:45] does he need to wait for me to get less
[1:20:47] busy like god i don't have time for you
[1:20:50] right now because i've got weeds growing
[1:20:52] in the yard
[1:20:56] all of a sudden we just need to wake up
[1:20:59] it's it's it's the dream world it's the
[1:21:02] fantasy world of electronic and
[1:21:04] entertainment and the the devil's trying
[1:21:06] to get us drawn into that and trapped
[1:21:08] into that but there's got to be a people
[1:21:10] who says i will not be brought under the
[1:21:12] power of any it's lawful for me it's not
[1:21:15] sin all things are lawful for me but
[1:21:16] this is not expedient and i will not be
[1:21:19] brought unto the power of this thing
[1:21:20] because i was not put on this earth to
[1:21:22] live like everybody else lives i am not
[1:21:25] here to just get along in laodicea i'm
[1:21:27] not here to multitask and get a bunch of
[1:21:30] stuff done amen just so i can pay more
[1:21:32] taxes to the government
[1:21:34] i am here to serve the purpose that he
[1:21:36] had on me before the foundation of the
[1:21:38] world and i'll never catch that purpose
[1:21:40] without this message
[1:21:42] and i'll never fulfill it without
[1:21:44] quieting down and getting direction from
[1:21:47] god and hearing from him
[1:21:50] i say
[1:21:51] god
[1:21:52] help us
[1:21:56] abraham had a visitation when he was
[1:21:57] separated from sodom
[1:22:00] david wrote hymns when he was separated
[1:22:02] with the flock
[1:22:04] moses
[1:22:06] received the visitation of the pillar of
[1:22:08] fire and word from the lord when he
[1:22:09] separated

[1:22:25] stimulation there were times where they
[1:22:26] were drawn aside and then brother
[1:22:28] branham made the statement he said jesus
[1:22:31] was always fasting and praying

[1:28:09] word so that i can manifest it in every
[1:28:11] conversation manifest it in my life
[1:28:16] praise be to god
[1:28:17] brother baby says in the forgotten be
[1:28:19] attitude but i said this that god can
[1:28:21] use what you yield
[1:28:22] like samson would not yield his heart to
[1:28:24] god he give that to delilah but he gave
[1:28:27] his strength to god and god could only
[1:28:29] use his strength that's all
[1:28:31] right so god will use what you yield
[1:28:35] but if i fall
[1:28:37] but if a fellow could only yield his
[1:28:39] complete being to god now that's it if
[1:28:42] you can heal your body god will use your
[1:28:44] body if you can yield your mind your
[1:28:46] heart whatever it is god will use what
[1:28:48] you give to him to use with he's seeking
[1:28:51] to find somebody that he can find
[1:28:53] yielded like that
[1:28:55] i say if we can give him our mind he'll
[1:28:57] use our mind
[1:28:59] he'll reveal his word to us he'll
[1:29:01] quicken our understanding he will lead
[1:29:03] us and direct us if we will give him our
[1:29:05] mind give him our time give him our
[1:29:08] focus
[1:29:10] let's look at philippians 4
[1:29:14] and 8.
[1:29:22] philippians chapter 4.
[1:29:32] philippians chapter 4 verse 8.
[1:29:38] finally brethren

[1:29:47] other than the message app
[1:29:49] and the bible app
[1:29:52] what sovereign things are true

[1:29:56] whatsoever things are just
[1:29:58] what sort of things are pure what sort
[1:30:01] of things are lovely whatsoever things
[1:30:03] are of good rapport if there be any
[1:30:05] virtue and there are many praise think
[1:30:08] on these things
[1:30:12] everything they listed describes the
[1:30:14] word of god
[1:30:16] the message of the hour
[1:30:18] think on these things let's bend our
[1:30:21] mind to the thing that matters most
[1:30:25] let's look at malachi chapter 3.
[1:30:28] this is the last scripture i'd like to
[1:30:30] read together
[1:30:32] musicians you can come on up if you'd
[1:30:33] like to make your way and brother
[1:30:36] then
[1:30:37] malachi chapter 3
[1:30:42] verse 16
[1:30:44] malachi 3 16.
[1:30:47] this scripture is one that brother gene
[1:30:49] petrie has quoted to me over and over
[1:30:51] and over again i think it's one of his
[1:30:53] favorite scriptures malachi 3 16.
[1:30:56] then they that feared the lord
[1:30:59] spake often one to another what is that
[1:31:02] fellowship
[1:31:04] and what are they talking about
[1:31:07] what do they have in common they fear
[1:31:09] the lord let's read that again then they
[1:31:11] that feared the lord spake often one to
[1:31:15] another
[1:31:16] we should be talking to each other
[1:31:19] about the word
[1:31:22] and the lord
[1:31:24] hearkened and heard it
[1:31:28] when you're fellowshipping about the
[1:31:30] word god hears it
[1:31:33] and listen
[1:31:34] and a book of remembrance was written
[1:31:36] before him for them that feared the lord
[1:31:39] and that thought upon his name
[1:31:43] do you want to be in that book of
[1:31:44] remembrance i want to be in that book of
[1:31:46] remembrance it was a book of remembrance
[1:31:48] amen
[1:31:50] was written before him for them that
[1:31:52] feared the lord and and that thought
[1:31:54] upon his name what do we think about we
[1:31:57] think about the lord
[1:32:00] and they shall be mine saith the lord of
[1:32:02] hosts in that day when i make up my
[1:32:04] jewels and i will spare them as a man
[1:32:06] spareth his own son that serveth him
[1:32:10] i say praise god i want to be in that
[1:32:12] book of remembrance
[1:32:14] i who fear the lord want to speak often
[1:32:16] one to another with somebody else that
[1:32:18] fears the lord and god will hear it and
[1:32:20] put it in a book of remembrance those
[1:32:22] who thought upon his name
[1:32:25] i'm so excited
[1:32:27] that we know where his name is we know
[1:32:28] what his name is
[1:32:30] we've been given the word that declares
[1:32:32] his name and we can think on those
[1:32:33] things
[1:32:34] i'm so thankful for tapes i'm so
[1:32:36] thankful for books i'm so thankful for
[1:32:38] fellowship i'm so thankful for services
[1:32:40] twice a week i'm so thankful for those
[1:32:42] things those are the things that should
[1:32:44] be we should give the most diligent time
[1:32:46] and attention to
[1:32:48] because those are the things that will
[1:32:50] equip us for the civilization of faith
[1:32:54] listen i don't need to know how to make
[1:32:55] it in this world
[1:32:57] because if anything comes that i can't
[1:32:59] handle
[1:33:01] i have a father
[1:33:05] if anything happens that
[1:33:07] i i can't find my way
[1:33:09] i have a father
[1:33:11] i don't need to be the most educated
[1:33:13] person in the world
[1:33:14] i don't need to be the most informed
[1:33:16] person in the world about carnal earthly
[1:33:18] things
[1:33:19] but if i can be singularly focused on
[1:33:22] him he promised he will provide
[1:33:24] everything i need
[1:33:26] he promised that he would take care of
[1:33:27] me he promised he would lead and guide
[1:33:29] me and that he would order my steps amen
[1:33:32] i don't need to be informed i don't need
[1:33:34] to have all the information
[1:33:36] i've got all the information i need in
[1:33:38] the word of god and i need to focus on
[1:33:40] it and let him pick my foot up and put
[1:33:42] it down
[1:33:43] let him part the waters let him move
[1:33:45] whatever and provide whatever i've got
[1:33:47] to stop trying to be so smart and so
[1:33:49] informed and so i just need to give my
[1:33:52] attention to this word and let the word
[1:33:54] make a way
[1:33:57] i'm telling you it's hard it's hard for
[1:33:58] me it's hard for all of us amen we're
[1:34:01] inundated with this but i will not be
[1:34:04] brought under the power of these things
[1:34:06] anymore and i tell you one thing i found
[1:34:09] when i took my phone and i left my phone
[1:34:12] all by itself back on the dresser you
[1:34:14] poor little phone
[1:34:17] i was in charge
[1:34:21] and it felt good
[1:34:24] i wasn't attached to that thing it
[1:34:26] wasn't stuck on the hip i wasn't worried
[1:34:28] about it every second of the day when i
[1:34:30] laid the thing down and walked away from
[1:34:32] it i mean i know it's just a goofy
[1:34:34] little bunch of plastic and metal but
[1:34:36] when i laid that thing down and walked
[1:34:37] away from it it was like i say
[1:34:40] you can't control me
[1:34:44] there's something liberating about
[1:34:46] taking control
[1:34:48] we weren't put here to be in subjection
[1:34:50] we were put here to bring everything
[1:34:52] into subjection
[1:34:56] i'm not going to be brought under the
[1:34:58] power of any of these things
[1:35:02] though they be lawful
[1:35:04] i will not be brought under the power
[1:35:06] because all things that are lawful are
[1:35:08] not expedient
[1:35:10] and i want that which is expedient in my
[1:35:13] life
[1:35:14] and i want that which will take me out
[1:35:16] of this life
[1:35:18] into the next life
[1:35:20] spend so much time trying to figure out
[1:35:22] how to live better in this life i don't
[1:35:24] want to live better in this life i want
[1:35:25] to get out of this life
[1:35:27] i want to move to the next one so i want
[1:35:29] to look at the information that's going
[1:35:31] to take me there
[1:35:33] and say god help me let's all stand
[1:35:36] let's all stand
[1:35:39] i pray to god that you receive this in
[1:35:40] the spirit it was sin
[1:35:42] the spirit it was preached in amen this
[1:35:45] is where god's been dealing with me this
[1:35:47] is where i've been learning these are
[1:35:48] things that i've had to take control of
[1:35:50] these are things i have to be more
[1:35:52] diligent about
[1:35:53] but i don't think i'm the only one
[1:35:56] i think the world we live in
[1:35:59] requires that we gird up the loins of
[1:36:01] our mind
[1:36:02] and be sober
[1:36:04] man let's bow our heads and pray
[1:36:06] dear lord jesus we thank you father
[1:36:09] i'm so thankful for your word lord i'm
[1:36:11] so thankful for this message
[1:36:13] where your prophet lord will will
[1:36:15] illuminate that word and show us the day
[1:36:17] we live in and where the battle is and
[1:36:19] what we have to do to overcome
[1:36:22] god i just want to tell you the lord i'm
[1:36:24] sorry
[1:36:26] i'm sorry for not being diligent i'm
[1:36:28] sorry for not being singularly focused
[1:36:31] i'm sorry lord for being a little loose
[1:36:33] in my mind
[1:36:34] but god i'm asking that you'd forgive me
[1:36:36] and give me the power and the strength
[1:36:38] lord to come back in line to this word
[1:36:41] to give you my best time to give you my
[1:36:43] thoughts to give you my energies to give
[1:36:45] my best to you lord
[1:36:47] help me god
[1:36:49] i'm more determined than ever not to be
[1:36:51] brought under the power of these things

[1:37:47] be more than what we have now
[1:37:49] lord help us to focus so that we can go
[1:37:51] to where you want us to be so that we
