TRANSCRIPT
========================================
The question is what do we want out of life? Do we want an easy life or do we want to come to adoption maturity? It's going to take patience. This word patience I told you earlier it means steadfastness, constancy, endurance. Another definition is a patient enduring, a sustaining, a perseverance. He says, "Count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations, knowing this, that the try of your faith workketh patience." So Jesus told his disciples, "All of these things are going to happen to you, but he that endureth to the end shall be saved." So what's it going to take to make it to the goal? It's going to take endurance. So why should we count it all joy when we fall into diverse temptations? Because the trying of our faith workketh endurance. How do we get endurance? By the trying of our faith. It teaches us to be patient, to endure, to just stay fast. Because Amen. It's all God working something in my life. We'll get through this, too. Amen. Amen. And when the next one comes, we'll get through this, too. Amen. I'm not derailed because there's trouble about I'm not derailed because of rejection or sickness. I'm not derailed because of falling away. I'm I'm not derailed by all of that. But let me set my face on the joy that lays ahead. This will end too. But let me count this all joy because this is going to bring about the patience that I need to be saved because he that endured to the end will be saved. Amen. And we're not going to make it without endurance, without patience. And we're not going to get patience without trials because the trying of our faith. So maybe rather than to despair every time something should happen, maybe we should say, "Praise your name, Lord Jesus. You're working something out of my life." Maybe the next time our heart is broken because of something somebody said to us or a circumstance that happened in family or happened in church or maybe we should just go, Amen. just like Paul in stalks beaten and naked in a prison cell and just start singing praises to God because he's good anyhow and this thing will work together for good because it's a promise in the scriptures. Maybe we could just change our attitude about troubles and disagreement and strife and sickness and trials and falling away and false brethren and false doctrine. If we could just change our attitude, maybe all of a sudden we would realize there's nothing to worry about because the destiny is still secure. What is that to thee? Follow thou me. You say, "Didn't you hear what they're preaching over in so- and so city? What's that to thee? Follow thou me." Didn't you hear there was a bunch of people that fell away because of a new internet site? What's that to thee? Follow thou me. Do you see that there's people bowing down and lighting candles and worshiping William Brandon? What's that to thee? Follow thou me. It's nothing unusual in the scriptures. It's nothing out of the ordinary. Wherever Christ was, there's always been a big bunch of noise. What does he want me to do? Look to the glory that lays ahead and endure.
