========================================

To me, I have to get to the place where I say what the word says and stop saying what I feel because what I feel is so often opposite to what the word says. And this is what revelation of sunship will do to us once God reveals to us where we came from, who we are, why we're here, where we're going, and what his purpose is. It gives us the ability to look beyond the trial and look beyond to the things that God has laid in store for us and say, "This is working for that goal. this is working for the purpose he has in my life because without revelation of sunship we just become the victims of circumstances in life and there are circumstances for everybody in life and not just Christians not uncchristians not I mean if you're Muslim if you're Jew if you're Hindu it doesn't matter who you are amen he a man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble amen but but that's because of the fallen nature that's because of the curse upon the earth so everybody falls falls into trouble. Everybody has tribulations. Everybody has troubles on the earth. But a son and daughter of God was born into this situation with a sin-cursed body and a sin-cursed world because God wants us to get an education cuz he's bringing us to a perfection. And he's using all of these circumstances that eat away and destroy the world. He's using the same circumstances to build us up and bring us into perfection, to bring us into maturity and bring us into our adoption where he can place as sons and daughters of God with authority that he places in us so that he can give us the signate ring so that he can give us the sword. Amen. Amen. So though our though our troubles are the same, we lose loved ones, we get sick, we lose jobs, we have financial crisis, we have things that go wrong, we have vehicle breaks down, we have family relations that go south, we have everything that everybody else has, but they are victims of circumstances of a sin-cursed world. We are never victims of circumstances because we have a heavenly father who knows all things and has orchestrated everything for our good. Amen. Amen. See, this is why unless we have God revealed to us who we are to break the spiritual amnesia, this world will whittle us down into depression, into discouragement, into a place where we just can't feel like we can go on anymore and brings us into states of depression and despondency and hopelessness. Amen. Because there's nowhere else to go. If we're just born of whoever our earthly mother and father was, if the only truth in our lives is the truth that's on our birth certificate and the truth that we feel and see and hear, Amen. then we're of all people most miserable, we're going to fail because this world is falling apart. There's no sure place to stand. There's no foundation. This thing is rumbling. Amen. And crumbling because it's going to be remade. Amen. It's going to bring forth. A it's going to be reformed for a new millennium. So everything is starting to crumble and fail. So God can bring a fresh everything, a fresh government, a fresh civilization, a fresh earth. Amen. So we we there's got to be something that happens in us. Amen. That lets us look beyond the circumstances or else, friends, we're just going to fall into the same despair that the rest of the world's falling into or or we'll move into some sort of coping mechanism to cover it up. Y which is where a majority of the world is and addictions and pleasure seeking and all of these other things. But when we have a revelation of sunship and we know that we have a heavenly father who has orchestrated our lives, he has written it in code. He has desired. Amen. A definite purpose.
