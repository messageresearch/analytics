[0:00] this is the same problem that started
[0:01] this whole thing saints in the garden
[0:03] eve tried to fend for herself
[0:08] let's not go let's not get so
[0:11] spiritually lifted up in our position
[0:13] that we can start that we can start
[0:16] deviating from the pattern and do the
[0:18] same mistake that happened in the
[0:20] beginning to bring all of this
[0:22] about eve
[0:25] stepped out and tried to fend for
[0:27] herself she tried to shift for herself
[0:29] she
[0:30] tried to make something happen because
[0:32] she didn't have a proper understanding
[0:33] and she didn't have proper trust in adam
[0:36] to fulfill this word
[0:37] remember the word was multiply and
[0:39] replenish the earth
[0:41] the the motive was not a bad motive it
[0:44] was a motherly motive
[0:46] it was a motherly instinct she
[0:48] recognized that was her position she
[0:50] recognized that's what she was to do
[0:51] but brother branham says where adam
[0:53] lacked was he lacked in the knowledge of
[0:54] how to reproduce himself
[0:56] so adam is lacking in this knowledge god
[0:58] has withheld this knowledge from him at
[1:00] this point in time so how can he give it
[1:01] to his wife
[1:02] but in that meantime his wife gets
[1:04] impatient and she doesn't have trust in
[1:06] him
[1:07] let's put it this way adam adam lost his
[1:10] job
[1:12] and what did eve do did she stick with
[1:15] him
[1:15] or did she go try to fend for herself
[1:20] think spiritually i was praying in the
[1:22] back before i came out and
[1:24] you would just have to be really i'm
[1:27] just going to say this you all forgive
[1:28] me i'm
[1:29] it may sound really blunt but we've
[1:31] we've
[1:32] recognized the last several services god
[1:34] is trying to say something
[1:36] very specific very clear um
[1:42] to the point that it's almost laughable
[1:44] like
[1:45] this is kind of obvious at this point
[1:47] everybody's saying the same thing
[1:48] but nobody can help it we don't have
[1:50] anything else to say
[1:52] everybody's saying the same thing but i
[1:54] was just praying in the back before i
[1:55] came out
[1:56] and i was asking the lord it's like help
[1:57] me not to miss it
[1:59] what specifically is this about
[2:02] everybody's coming along and just saying
[2:05] the same thing everybody's in the same
[2:06] vein everybody's saying this
[2:08] what specifically is it and i didn't
[2:11] hear a voice but just what dropped in my
[2:13] heart was this
[2:14] very clear i don't want my bride
[2:18] trying to fend for herself that is what
[2:22] this is about saints
[2:24] that's as clear as i know how to make it
[2:27] maybe we should sing
[2:28] him and go out but that's as clear
[2:31] as i know how to make it that is the
[2:33] point of all of this
[2:35] the laodicean age is all about that
[2:39] woman
[2:39] fending for herself
[2:43] it's wrong in the natural and it's wrong
[2:46] in the spiritual
