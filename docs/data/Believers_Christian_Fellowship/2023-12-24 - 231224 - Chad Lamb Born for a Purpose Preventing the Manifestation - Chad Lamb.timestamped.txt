[30:12] just want to let you know that uh this
[30:14] coming week my family and I are going to
[30:15] get away for a couple days we had a
[30:17] little window of opportunity where David
[30:20] was off school the girls had a few days
[30:21] off so we're jumping on and we're going
[30:23] to spend a few days together so I won't
[30:25] be here Wednesday night but brother Ben
[30:27] SEO will be taking the service so
[30:29] remember him in prayer and we'll be back
[30:31] for the uh Sunday service for New Year's
[30:34] Eve amen when we look at this
[30:38] scripture I I I look at this and I I
[30:41] remember whenever we get to this season
[30:43] of time I always reflect on all the
[30:45] Christmas messages that brother Brandon
[30:47] preached some of the greatest messages
[30:48] that were ever preached were at
[30:49] Christmas time and I love the way
[30:51] brother Brandon preached his Christmas
[30:53] messages because you know while while so
[30:56] much of of the world I mean even in his
[30:59] day we're preaching about an event that
[31:01] had transpired 2,000 years ago brother
[31:03] Brandon would take the event that
[31:05] transpired 2,000 years ago he' bring it
[31:07] right to our day and he would show us
[31:09] that the same thing continues on Amen
[31:12] and he preached uh in 1960 he preached
[31:14] God's wrapped gifts amen showing us that
[31:17] God's gifts still come wrapped amen and
[31:19] how are they wrapped they're wrapped
[31:21] behind a veil of Flesh God still has
[31:24] gifts in this day but they're wrapped
[31:26] gifts amen and Jesus was a wrapped gift
[31:28] wrapped in swaddling cloth which was
[31:30] what amen it was the it was it was the
[31:33] the the fabric off the inside of a yok
[31:35] it was nothing absolutely nothing that
[31:37] you would desire no special garment no
[31:40] nothing of praiseworthy it smelled like
[31:42] the ox it was it was rough amen but what
[31:45] was it it was it was the Garment that
[31:48] Christ would be wrapped in amen and when
[31:50] the shepherd saw him where how would
[31:51] they shame they would see a wrapped gift
[31:54] amen and it wasn't what the wrapping was
[31:56] it was what inside the the wrapping that
[31:59] mattered and inside this wrapping it may
[32:01] be rough and it may be smelly and it may
[32:04] but praise God there's a gift
[32:06] inside amen I I love how brother
[32:09] brandham could take Christmas amen and
[32:12] preach the
[32:14] message then in 1963 he preached why
[32:17] little
[32:18] Bethlehem he preached we have seen a
[32:20] star and have come to worship Him amen
[32:24] we know in this day we have seen a star
[32:27] yeah amen the Morning Star showing the
[32:31] rising of the Sun and we' have seen a
[32:33] star and come to worship him and he says
[32:36] and he preached God's gifts always find
[32:38] their place places that was good in 1964
[32:43] he preached why it had to be Shepherds
[32:46] had to be Shepherds amen and he goes and
[32:48] preaches that amen and and we're going
[32:50] to uh read this scripture this morning
[32:54] but I love those messages and and I I
[32:57] didn't do it this year but usually every
[32:59] every year around December I start going
[33:00] through all of them and listening to all
[33:02] of them I didn't get a chance to do that
[33:03] this year but they've always meant a lot
[33:05] to me and I don't just listen to them at
[33:06] Christmas time I like why little
[33:08] Bethlehem I listen to that all the time
[33:10] that's an outstanding message but this
[33:12] time when the world is is reflecting the
[33:15] whole world is is is believing that
[33:18] Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem they
[33:20] believe the story of the baby in the
[33:22] manger amen but as we just sang amen
[33:25] there's still a Manger amen there's
[33:27] still amen a birth taking place only now
[33:30] he's been being born in you and I amen
[33:33] so the story is just as relevant today
[33:36] as it's ever been we brother Brandon
[33:39] preached the message uh and that message
[33:41] was calling him out of
[33:43] History amen calling him out of history
[33:47] and I say today let's call him out of
[33:48] History amen let's not just reflect on
[33:51] the historical acts of Jesus but what's
[33:53] going on now what does Christmas mean to
[33:55] us now when brother brand come and
[33:57] preach that is the rising of the sun
[33:59] amen he and he preached the Easter seal
[34:01] and the rising of the sun these were
[34:02] Easter messages and brother brandham
[34:04] said what does Easter mean what does it
[34:06] mean to you and I amen what does it mean
[34:08] to us today not that Jesus just Rose
[34:11] 2,000 years ago but what does Easter
[34:13] have to do with us today and then
[34:15] brother brandom started showing hey it's
[34:17] Resurrection now amen we've been
[34:19] resurrected out of denominationalism
[34:22] we've been brought amen into newness of
[34:24] life into the word of the hour he said
[34:26] what a resurrection that was what a
[34:28] resurrection this is he says now it's
[34:31] Easter with me and Jesus and you and I
[34:33] and Jesus it's Easter with all of us
[34:35] it's Easter amen so brother benam never
[34:38] left the historical events in history he
[34:41] always brought it to our day and say
[34:43] what was there is here amen what was
[34:45] there that day is here this day praise
[34:48] God I love a present tense
[34:52] Revelation because it gives us life
[34:55] today so when we look at at this this
[34:58] scripture that we just read the
[35:00] Shepherds were keeping watch over their
[35:03] flocks by night and the angel of the
[35:06] Lord bed them in the glory of the Lord
[35:08] and gave them a message for unto you was
[35:11] born this day in the city of David a
[35:13] savior which is Christ the
[35:16] Lord amen this
[35:20] birth was a birth with a purpose that's
[35:23] what I'm going to talk about to today
[35:26] born for for a purpose and then for a
[35:28] subtitle I'd like to take preventing the
[35:32] manifestation born for a purpose he was
[35:35] born to save men from their sins he was
[35:37] born to be the savior of the world Amen
[35:40] and we know to do that he would give his
[35:42] life so he was born to die in our place
[35:45] to be the sacrificial lamb he was born
[35:48] with a purpose let's pick up the story
[35:51] over here in verse 15 and it came to
[35:53] pass as the Angels were gone away from
[35:55] them un Heaven the Shepherds said one to
[35:57] another let us now go even unto
[35:59] Bethlehem and see this thing which has
[36:01] come to pass which the Lord hath made
[36:03] known unto us amen it's amazing that the
[36:06] Shepherds brother bam when he preached
[36:08] why had to be Shepherds he was talking
[36:10] about he was talking about uh men who
[36:13] were illiterate they were uneducated
[36:16] they were they were you know not in the
[36:18] in group of society but they were out a
[36:21] bit separated and he talked about they
[36:23] were simple amen they weren't the priest
[36:25] they weren't the high priest they
[36:26] weren't the well educated amen and these
[36:29] these simple men these simple Shepherds
[36:32] that were out here doing the work of a
[36:34] Shepherd amen how who else would
[36:36] recognize the birth of a lamb who else
[36:38] was there to attend the birth of lambs
[36:40] this was the Lamb of God coming to the
[36:42] Earth it's very fitting that the angel
[36:44] would notify the Shepherds the Shepherds
[36:46] would need to know that there's a
[36:47] newborn lamb amen but them being the
[36:50] simple men that they are amen they
[36:52] didn't say let us go to Bethlehem and do
[36:54] some investigation and find out is true
[36:57] they believed it as soon as the angel
[36:59] told them they believed that let's say
[37:01] let let they said let's go see this
[37:03] thing that's been done oh why did it
[37:06] have to be Shepherds because they were
[37:07] simple enough to believe the Angel's
[37:09] message amen and what are we to be not
[37:12] religious amen not theologians not
[37:14] highly educated we need be as simple and
[37:17] humbled as the Shepherds to recognize
[37:19] amen the Angel's message is true let's
[37:21] go see this that's been done amen the
[37:24] word has returned let's not analyze it
[37:26] let's not take scientific analysis of it
[37:29] and see no let's go see it it's done
[37:32] it's here let's go witness this
[37:35] thing why I had to be Shepherds because
[37:37] Shepherds could receive this
[37:40] message verse 16 and they came in haste
[37:43] and found Mary and Joseph and the baby
[37:45] lying in a manger and when they had seen
[37:48] it they made known abroad the saying
[37:49] which was told them concerning the child
[37:52] and all they that heard it wondered at
[37:54] those things which were told them by the
[37:58] Shepherds so the first Earthly Herald of
[38:02] the newborn king was Shepherds simple
[38:06] humble Shepherds who did God send with
[38:08] the message of the birth of Christ amen
[38:10] to their fellow man he sent the angel to
[38:13] the Shepherds he sent the Shepherds to
[38:14] everybody else in Bethlehem and they
[38:16] wondered at what these Shepherds were
[38:18] talking about not they're not the normal
[38:21] oracles amen for the word of God they
[38:23] weren't the they weren't the customary
[38:25] amen Oracle that they were used to
[38:27] hearing great messages from God from
[38:29] amen but they were exactly right on par
[38:31] with what God wanted amen amen we not we
[38:36] may not be much amen we may not be the
[38:39] upper crusted Society but praise be to
[38:41] God if we can be like Shepherds we can
[38:43] run through the city proclaiming that
[38:46] Christ is here amen he is
[38:49] here and the message Shalom brother B
[38:52] says that son is the word of God the
[38:54] beginning God said let there be light
[38:56] and when the manifested word of God when
[38:58] the word of God was manifested there was
[39:01] light first God spoke it what if it
[39:04] didn't manifest then it wasn't light yet
[39:06] but when he spoke it and then it was
[39:08] manifested Vindicated his word was a
[39:11] Vindicated light came into existence and
[39:14] that's the only way it can be done now
[39:16] is when the word is Vindicated God's
[39:18] written word Vindicated then it shows
[39:20] light it's a it's a portion is lit or
[39:24] put out for each age we find in the
[39:27] church ages we find in the Old Testament
[39:28] Church ages each time that there came a
[39:31] time a certain manifestation of the
[39:33] journey there was a prophet came to
[39:35] Earth and the word came to the prophet
[39:37] and he made that word live and when that
[39:40] word was identified it reflected God and
[39:43] there was the age there was the light
[39:46] and that's the way light comes today am
[39:50] how when God when it's a when it's a
[39:52] time for another age another
[39:54] dispensation God would send the prophet
[39:56] the Prophet would declare the word amen
[39:58] and and that word would be Vindicated
[40:00] and it became the light for that
[40:02] age there was a prophecy amen a prophecy
[40:05] laying in the word that a virgin shall
[40:08] conceive a child shall be born unto us
[40:11] amen and and and the government shall be
[40:13] upon his shoulder we know that these
[40:15] prophecies are laying there there was a
[40:16] prophecy all the way back in Genesis
[40:18] chter 3 that the seed of the woman would
[40:20] bruise the head of the serpent so
[40:22] there's been a prophecy of this seed
[40:24] coming down all through and now now it
[40:26] was a word it was a word it was a word
[40:29] but now it's manifested
[40:32] word
[40:34] amen and so now we see that Jesus says
[40:38] let's turn together to John chapter 8
[40:40] together and let's look at
[40:46] this John chapter
[40:52] 8:12 in John 8:12 he says then spake
[40:55] Jesus again unto them saying I am the
[40:57] light of the world he that followeth me
[41:00] shall not walk in darkness but shall
[41:03] have the light of life amen what made
[41:07] him the light of the world because he
[41:09] was the manifested word for his day he
[41:12] was that prophecy he was that word The
[41:14] Prophecy from Genesis 3 The Prophecy
[41:16] from Isaiah chapter 7 The Prophecy from
[41:19] Isaiah 53 all these prophecies were
[41:22] round up in him and now he wasn't he
[41:24] wasn't just the word because the word
[41:26] was already there he was the manifested
[41:29] word and he says I am the light of the
[41:31] world Amen and he was the manifested
[41:34] word amen and that's where the rub
[41:36] always comes friends it always starts a
[41:39] battle it always starts a war war is
[41:41] when the word comes into manifestation
[41:43] amen because once the word Goes Forth
[41:46] the spoken word of God the devil can do
[41:48] nothing to retract that word that word's
[41:50] already been spoken and a spoken word of
[41:52] God will go out there and circle around
[41:54] the earth amen that's what brother abam
[41:56] said amen Isaiah said a virgin shall
[41:58] conceive that word went forth and that
[42:00] word was circling around the globe
[42:02] waiting till that word could drop and
[42:04] it's appointed time and it's appointed
[42:06] Place amen and he can't stop that word
[42:08] from moving around but what he's trying
[42:10] to do is prevent the manifestation amen
[42:13] because the manifestation of that word
[42:14] brings light and light brings life
[42:18] amen amen when when uh when Jes when God
[42:23] Amen told uh his his uh new formed son
[42:27] he says go forth multiply and replenish
[42:31] amen that was the word of God the spoken
[42:33] word was given to the son and his son's
[42:36] wife to multiply and replenish amen and
[42:38] he can't stop that word he can't stop
[42:40] that word that God spoke as a prophecy
[42:43] amen but what does the devil do he comes
[42:45] to Mar the manifestation and he comes
[42:47] and he gets into the womb of the woman
[42:49] Amen to try to disrupt the manifestation
[42:51] of that word because the manifestation
[42:53] of the word brings life yeah amen right
[42:57] this is what the devil has always tried
[42:58] to do he began to to to try to either
[43:02] prevent or pervert or or or sometime
[43:04] hold back the manifestation of that word
[43:07] because when the word comes in the
[43:08] manifestation amen it begins to end
[43:11] something for
[43:14] him let's go to John chapter 3 look at
[43:18] another scripture
[43:21] here he said I am the light of the world
[43:24] he that followeth me walketh shall not
[43:26] walk in darkness but shall have the
[43:28] light of Life John 3:
[43:32] 19 says and this is the condemnation
[43:34] that light has come into the world and
[43:37] Men love Darkness rather than light
[43:39] because their deeds were
[43:41] evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth
[43:44] the light neither cometh to the light
[43:46] lest his deeds should be
[43:48] reproved this is the reason that the
[43:50] devil would always use these who hate
[43:53] the light to try to put out the light
[43:56] right because the light was a reprove to
[43:58] them let's turn to Matthew Chapter
[44:10] 2 Matthew chapter 2 verse
[44:15] 1 Matthew 2 verse 1 says now when Jesus
[44:19] was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the
[44:22] days of Herod the king behold there came
[44:24] wise men from the east of Jerusalem
[44:26] saying where is he that is born King of
[44:28] the Jews for we have seen his star in
[44:30] the east and are come to worship him
[44:33] when Herod the king had heard these
[44:35] things he was troubled and all Jerusalem
[44:38] with him why was he troubled amen here
[44:41] was the prophecy coming to fulfillment
[44:43] here were these wise men coming saying
[44:45] the time of the prophecy is now at hand
[44:48] but Herod Who Loved darkness and not lie
[44:51] he was troubled because the word was
[44:52] coming into
[44:54] manifestation and and
[44:57] now uh verse four and then he had
[45:00] gathered all the chief priests and the
[45:01] scribes of the people together he
[45:03] demanded of them where Christ should be
[45:05] born and they said unto him in Bethlehem
[45:07] of Judea for thus it is written by the
[45:09] prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land
[45:12] of Judah art not the least among the
[45:14] princes of Judah for out of thee shall
[45:16] come a governor that shall rule My
[45:18] People Israel then Herod when he had
[45:20] privately called the wise men inquired
[45:22] of them diligently what time the star
[45:24] appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem
[45:27] and said go and search diligently for
[45:29] the young child and when you have found
[45:31] him bring me word again that I might
[45:33] come and worship him also so here is
[45:38] Herod he's sitting he's a tetrarch he's
[45:40] sitting as a king amen over uh Judea and
[45:45] and when he finds out that the wise men
[45:47] come with a with a message amen that
[45:49] we've seen the sign in the heavens amen
[45:51] we've seen the star declaring the birth
[45:54] of Christ amen all the all of a sudden
[45:56] he's troubled amen this this is
[45:58] perplexing to him because now Christ has
[46:01] come amen for the rest of the world for
[46:04] those who are trapped in darkness and
[46:05] want light this is the greatest thing
[46:07] that we could ever hear for the
[46:08] Shepherds it was a wonderful message for
[46:10] Herod it was perplexing and
[46:12] troubling so he he FS that he wants to
[46:16] worship him so he says go and and then
[46:19] diligently seek out the child before he
[46:21] sends him he ask when did this star
[46:23] appear what when did you first see the
[46:24] sign in the heaven he's trying to
[46:26] determine when Jesus was born and he's
[46:28] acting super interested in the word and
[46:30] the Fulfillment of Prophecy and he is
[46:33] very interested in the Fulfillment of
[46:35] Prophecy not because he loves light but
[46:37] because he loves darkness and he's
[46:40] afraid of the
[46:41] light now we go down to verse 16 after
[46:45] the wise men left by another way being
[46:47] warned of God verse 16 it says then
[46:50] Herod when he saw that he was mocked of
[46:52] the wise men was exceeding wroth and
[46:54] sent forth and SLE slew excuse me slew
[46:57] all the children that were in Bethlehem
[46:59] and all the coast thereof from 2 years
[47:01] old and under according to the time
[47:03] which he had diligently inquired of the
[47:06] wise men amen Not only was he troubled
[47:10] about the birth of the word he was
[47:13] trying to kill
[47:16] it this is the condemnation to the world
[47:19] that light is come to the world and Men
[47:21] loved Darkness rather than light because
[47:23] their deeds were
[47:24] evil he didn't love the Fulfillment of
[47:27] the word he didn't love the prophecy
[47:29] coming to manifestation no matter what
[47:31] he pretended to like and no matter what
[47:33] kind of religious ceremony or whatever
[47:36] kind of religious pretense he put on
[47:38] when it came down to it when the
[47:40] prophecy moved from the spoken word
[47:42] prophecy to manifestation now he had to
[47:45] kill the
[47:47] manifestation and this has been the
[47:49] tactic of the devil all the way through
[47:51] he's trying to stop that manifestation
[47:54] amen and we know that he can't stop it
[47:56] amen he's only been attempting to stop
[47:58] it but we see all of his efforts from
[48:00] the very beginning In the Garden of Eden
[48:02] all the way through to today he's trying
[48:04] to stop the manifestation of the
[48:06] word but what God has spoken amen will
[48:09] come to pass amen nothing will stop the
[48:12] manifestation of the word but he's sure
[48:14] on a rampage to try to stop it to
[48:16] squelch it amen to to do all he can to
[48:19] discredit it disprove it amen put a
[48:22] black mark upon it he's trying to keep
[48:24] everybody away from the manif
[48:27] a amen let's go to John
[48:30] 18 you know I first titled this uh born
[48:35] with a purpose and I want to look at
[48:37] what Jesus says here in John chapter 18
[48:41] he's standing before Pilate he's been
[48:44] arrested put on trial he's undergoing
[48:47] questioning from pilate and in John
[48:52] 18:37 he says pilate therefore said unto
[48:55] him art thou a king then Jesus answered
[48:58] thou sayest that I am a King Jesus had
[49:01] just said my kingdom is not from the
[49:03] earth my Kingdom's from above if my
[49:05] kingdom was from Earth my subjects would
[49:07] fight for me but my kingdom is not from
[49:09] here my kingdom is from above and he
[49:10] says Thou Art King he says you say that
[49:12] I'm a king but then Look what Jesus says
[49:16] to this end was I
[49:17] born and for this cause came I into the
[49:20] world that I should bear witness unto
[49:22] the truth why was Jesus born born to
[49:26] Bear witness of the
[49:27] truth this is what he says to this end
[49:30] was I born this is the reason that I've
[49:32] been born and for this cause came I into
[49:35] the world that I should bear witness
[49:37] unto the truth everyone that is of the
[49:39] truth heareth my
[49:42] voice amen what was the purpose of Jesus
[49:45] we know he's born to be the Savior he's
[49:46] born to be the Lamb of God he's born to
[49:48] take away the sins of the world that's
[49:49] all the purpose but when Jesus stands
[49:51] before Pilate he said this is the reason
[49:53] I came into the world for this purpose I
[49:55] I was born to Bear witness of the truth
[49:58] amen and everybody that loves the truth
[50:00] will hear my
[50:02] voice
[50:04] amen if that was Jesus's purpose I want
[50:07] that to be my purpose amen why have I
[50:10] been born again amen my first birth I
[50:12] come into the Earth but God knew when I
[50:14] would be planted God knew what time I
[50:16] would come and he planted a seed in this
[50:18] earth and down in my soul was a SE Gene
[50:20] of God and he knew when it would come
[50:22] forth he knew what vessel it would be
[50:24] trapped in and he knew what journey I
[50:26] would be on and where in the journey
[50:27] that he would meet that seed and bring
[50:29] it to life but I've been born again amen
[50:32] this is the reason I've been born this
[50:33] is the reason to Bear witness of the
[50:35] truth that's the reason I've been born
[50:38] again that's the reason I've encountered
[50:40] this message that's the reason the light
[50:42] of this hour has struck the seed and BR
[50:44] it to life is so that I can bear witness
[50:46] of the truth that's why he came that's
[50:48] why we've come amen we've been born for
[50:52] a purpose and born again for the purpose
[50:54] of God
[50:58] but just as the devil never was
[51:00] welcoming to the manifestation of the
[51:02] word he's still not today yeah right
[51:07] amen Jesus I I want to I want to look at
[51:10] John chapter
[51:12] 8 I'm flipping back and forth in John
[51:15] here but I like the Book of
[51:18] John that when you look at the four
[51:20] gospels John is the bride's gospel
[51:23] through and through amen it's it's got
[51:25] the eagle anointing on it amen so John
[51:31] 8:31 then said Jesus to those Jews which
[51:34] believed on him so there was a whole
[51:36] slew of Jews that believed on him they
[51:37] would eventually Fade Away amen but they
[51:39] were Believing on him at this point and
[51:41] here's what he says if you continue in
[51:44] my word then you are my disciples indeed
[51:48] and you shall know the truth and the
[51:50] truth shall make shall make you
[51:53] free oh my goodness and you know you
[51:55] know what this was perplexing to the
[51:56] Jews because the next statement they say
[51:58] we're Abraham's children and never were
[52:00] in bondage to any man how can you say
[52:02] you'll make us free amen they were
[52:03] looking at a natural condition and he
[52:06] was looking at a spiritual condition and
[52:08] he says I will speak the truth amen
[52:11] let's see it again uh if you continue in
[52:16] my word this is why brother brandham
[52:18] said you know Judas was walking in the
[52:20] word but Judas couldn't continue in the
[52:22] word he couldn't go all the way to
[52:23] Pentecost amen that's why brother said
[52:25] the greatest evidence I know of of the
[52:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen is being
[52:29] able to go all the way with the word not
[52:32] getting hung up somewhere amen Judas got
[52:34] hung up somewhere many got hung up
[52:36] somewhere Deus got hung up somewhere and
[52:38] could no longer continue with Paul amen
[52:41] but not that you just can believe
[52:42] because he's saying these were the Jews
[52:44] who believed on him but if you continue
[52:46] all the way through that's the greatest
[52:48] evidence that brother bham knew of of
[52:50] the baptism of the Holy
[52:53] Ghost and he said if you you continue in
[52:56] the my word then you are my disciples
[52:58] indeed and ye shall know the truth and
[53:02] the truth shall make you
[53:04] free what brings freedom is the
[53:08] truth Jesus he says to this end I was
[53:11] born and for this cause I came into the
[53:13] world to Bear witness of the truth
[53:16] because it's the truth that makes us
[53:20] free
[53:21] amen religion doesn't make us free a a a
[53:25] United States Constitution doesn't make
[53:27] us free but the truth makes us
[53:30] free amen we're thankful for the
[53:33] Privileges that we have living in the
[53:35] United States we can worship the way we
[53:37] want we can live where we want we've got
[53:39] a lot of freedoms amen but there's so
[53:41] many people that are free in the United
[53:42] States and they're Bound in their soul
[53:45] Bound in their Spirit realm Bound by
[53:47] traditions of men Bound by all kinds of
[53:49] deception Bound by lies and all kinds of
[53:52] traditional teachings of man with no
[53:54] understanding of god with her mind
[53:56] alienated darkened to the things of God
[53:58] Bound by all kinds of addictions Bound
[54:01] by all kinds of habits Bound by all
[54:03] kinds of past issues
[54:06] amen but he said the truth shall make
[54:09] you
[54:12] free I thank God that he's given us the
[54:17] truth so that we can experience real
[54:23] Freedom Jesus came came into this world
[54:26] to Bear witness of the
[54:29] truth I believe that's why we're
[54:32] here to Bear witness of the
[54:35] truth in the message
[54:38] Paradox brother bam says John Came Upon
[54:41] the Earth he was the manifested word of
[54:44] God for that hour we know that he was
[54:47] God's manifested word because why Isaiah
[54:49] said there would be a voice of one
[54:51] crying in the wilderness Malachi the
[54:52] last prophet said behold I send my
[54:54] messenger before my face to prepare the
[54:56] way before the people so what was what
[54:59] what was
[55:01] John uh Jesus says John was a
[55:04] light and you were happy to walk in that
[55:06] light for a season he wasn't the light
[55:09] he was bearing witness of the light he
[55:11] was a lesser light showing the great
[55:14] light he was a light why was he a light
[55:17] amen because he was the word made
[55:19] manifest for his
[55:21] day that's what made him the light and
[55:24] God provide a place of worship he said
[55:27] that what say how do you know he was a
[55:29] prophet the word come to the prophet and
[55:31] he was the manifested word of God for
[55:34] his age so when the word come to the
[55:36] prophet and the prophet declared that
[55:38] word amen he was the manifested word of
[55:41] God for that hour and and Jesus said he
[55:44] was a
[55:47] light
[55:49] amen when God would call the Apostle
[55:54] Paul
[55:55] on the road to
[55:57] Damascus he would call him a chosen
[56:01] vessel and he say he's a chosen vessel
[56:04] unto me to Bear my name before the
[56:07] Gentiles and Kings and the children of
[56:09] Israel he was to bear or carry the name
[56:12] of Christ and take it into the darkness
[56:15] of the Gentiles and he was to be a light
[56:17] amen he was actually called to be a
[56:20] light he was going to be the Fulfillment
[56:22] of the prophecy of Isaiah 49
[56:26] in in Acts 13 let's turn there together
[56:30] and look at this in Acts 13 He and
[56:32] Barnabas are going along and they're
[56:34] preaching to the Jews as they move
[56:36] around in a missionary journey and the
[56:39] Jews now are going to reject
[56:43] them acts 13:
[56:52] 46 then Paul and Barnabas wax both gold
[56:55] and said it was necessary that the word
[56:57] of God should first have been spoken to
[57:00] you but seeing that you put it from you
[57:03] and judge yourselves Unworthy of
[57:04] everlasting life Lo we turn to the
[57:06] Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded
[57:09] us saying I have set thee to be a light
[57:11] of the Gentiles that thou should us be
[57:13] for salvation unto the ends of the Earth
[57:16] and when the Gentiles heard this they
[57:17] were glad and glorified the word of the
[57:19] Lord and as many as were ordained to
[57:21] eternal life believed and the word of
[57:23] the Lord was published throughout all
[57:25] the region amen when Paul amen when he
[57:29] come Paul and Barnabas come preaching
[57:31] what the truth amen they were there
[57:33] bearing witness of the truth amen and
[57:36] God told go told Paul he was to be a
[57:38] chosen vessel to bear his name before
[57:41] the Gentiles and Kings amen and now he
[57:44] he he comes and he and he says we are a
[57:46] light unto the Gentiles for salvation to
[57:49] the end of the Earth God had told him
[57:50] what is that that's quoting Isaiah 49
[57:53] Isaiah 49 was now now coming into
[57:55] manifestation in the Apostle Paul it was
[57:58] the word made flesh amen amen and who is
[58:02] the light of the world it's Christ but
[58:03] Christ was working in
[58:05] paulen amen so now he's claiming Isaiah
[58:10] he's claiming God spoke Isaiah 49 over
[58:12] him he's now standing here saying that
[58:15] he's the Fulfillment of Isaiah 49 and
[58:17] Isaiah 49 was to be a light amen coming
[58:20] to the Gentiles amen because the word
[58:22] made manifest for your day is the light
[58:24] of the age and now he's there bearing
[58:26] witness of the truth bringing the light
[58:28] of the age and what happens immediately
[58:31] the Gentiles that were ordained to life
[58:33] amen they came to
[58:35] life why because light brings life amen
[58:39] when there was when was deadness upon
[58:41] this earth when it was under judgment in
[58:43] Genesis 1:2 and darkness covered the
[58:45] face of the deep God first was going to
[58:47] speak a word and that spoken word was
[58:49] that there'll be light because life
[58:51] comes by light and Jesus was the word
[58:54] and in in him was life and that life was
[58:56] the light of
[58:58] men and so now the Apostle Paul is
[59:01] claiming to be a light unto the Gentiles
[59:04] why because he's bearing record of the
[59:08] Life of Christ that's right and it
[59:11] brings them to
[59:15] life let's look at Galatians chapter
[59:23] 1
[59:38] Galatians 1:
[59:42] 13 Paul says here for you have heard of
[59:45] my conversation in time past in the Jews
[59:48] religion how that beyond measure I
[59:50] persecuted the Church of God and wasted
[59:52] it and profited in the Jews religion
[59:54] above my mine equals and my own Nation
[59:56] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[59:58] traditions of my fathers but when it
[1:00:01] pleased God who separated me from my
[1:00:03] mother's womb and called me by his grace
[1:00:06] to reveal his son in
[1:00:09] me we've been through this before but I
[1:00:11] have to highlight it friends because
[1:00:13] it's so perfect he didn't say when God
[1:00:16] finally decided to reveal his son to
[1:00:18] me of course he revealed the son to him
[1:00:21] but that wasn't the purpose of his
[1:00:23] calling he called him so that he could
[1:00:25] reveal his son in me amen where was the
[1:00:28] sun revealed in Paul amen where was the
[1:00:31] light it was shining through Paul Paul
[1:00:34] was now a carrier of this truth amen he
[1:00:36] came he was born for a purpose amen he
[1:00:39] knew that God had separated him from his
[1:00:41] mother's womb and let him go but when
[1:00:43] the due season was along that God was
[1:00:46] going to inject himself into Paul's life
[1:00:48] amen because he's a chosen vessel unto
[1:00:51] God chosen before the foundation of the
[1:00:53] world to do what Amen to Bear record of
[1:00:56] the truth to shine forth the light amen
[1:00:58] so that the sun would be revealed in
[1:01:01] Paul not to Paul and I'm telling you
[1:01:04] friends the sun has been revealed to us
[1:01:06] in this day through a prophetic Ministry
[1:01:08] at the end time but that sun was not
[1:01:10] just to be revealed to us but in this
[1:01:13] day the sun is to be revealed in
[1:01:15] us where is the Sun supposed to be
[1:01:18] shining where is the light of the world
[1:01:20] supposed to be it's supposed to be
[1:01:22] contained in Earth and vessels cuz we
[1:01:24] have this treasure in Earth and vessels
[1:01:26] that the Excellency might be of God and
[1:01:27] not of
[1:01:29] man we've been born for a
[1:01:32] purpose to testify of the
[1:01:38] truth God told Paul that he as he was
[1:01:41] getting to the end of his ministry he
[1:01:43] got arrested and had rejection and and
[1:01:45] God says don't worry you're going to
[1:01:47] Bear witness of me in Jerusalem as well
[1:01:50] what was he doing testifying of the
[1:01:53] truth you know and and Paul if we just
[1:01:56] look at the life of Paul he had it
[1:01:59] pretty good you know he before his
[1:02:03] conversion I should say BC before
[1:02:08] conversion Paul BC had it pretty good
[1:02:12] zealous for the traditions of the
[1:02:13] fathers come from good stock come from a
[1:02:16] good family uh his religion was all
[1:02:18] tucked in nice and in order and he was
[1:02:20] getting uh accolades and compliments and
[1:02:23] positions and prestige all because of
[1:02:25] his religious Duty and service amen but
[1:02:27] when God who separated him from his
[1:02:29] mother's wound saw fit to reveal his son
[1:02:32] in him he he he totally messed up his
[1:02:35] whole
[1:02:37] life because he was born for this
[1:02:41] purpose he wasn't born to propagate the
[1:02:44] traditions of the fathers he was born to
[1:02:45] Bear witness of the
[1:02:48] light and you know when Paul had this
[1:02:52] massive conversion where he met Jesus
[1:02:54] Christ in the pillar of fire he spoke to
[1:02:56] Jesus Christ amen lip to ear he had this
[1:03:00] uh magnificent uh uh encounter and when
[1:03:03] he came out of this encounter amen he
[1:03:05] knew he knew where he went wrong and he
[1:03:08] knew what was wrong with what he was
[1:03:09] doing and he instantly knew who Christ
[1:03:11] was and all of a sudden so much of the
[1:03:14] scripture started unlocking to Paul that
[1:03:16] immediately he goes into Damascus and
[1:03:18] starts in the synagogue amen confounding
[1:03:20] them teaching from the scriptures that
[1:03:23] Jesus was the Christ amen why cuz an
[1:03:26] encounter with the light turns on the
[1:03:27] light there was a man there that could
[1:03:29] turn on the light and when the light got
[1:03:30] switched on for Paul all the sudden
[1:03:32] those Scrolls that he had read and read
[1:03:34] and then the school of G sitting at the
[1:03:36] feet of G he had memorized certain
[1:03:38] passages and he knew certain things and
[1:03:40] he had it all misplaced and he had it
[1:03:42] all in the wrong context and now the
[1:03:44] things that he was hoping for he was
[1:03:46] fighting against he was trying to kill
[1:03:48] amen and keep in darkness the very light
[1:03:50] that was the Fulfillment of the
[1:03:51] scriptures that he loved yeah but but
[1:03:54] then he come in contact with a man that
[1:03:56] could flip on the
[1:03:58] light
[1:04:01] Hallelujah brother Brenham preached the
[1:04:03] message there's a man here that can turn
[1:04:05] on the light amen and when you look at
[1:04:07] that message brother Brenham starts to
[1:04:08] break it down and type it he says there
[1:04:10] was a there there's a in the Carl's Bad
[1:04:12] Caverns you go way down under the ground
[1:04:14] and down under the Earth there's a
[1:04:16] little cave in there amen and it's so
[1:04:18] dark in there there's no light in there
[1:04:20] amen and and then there was a guide and
[1:04:22] the guide was going along and and some
[1:04:24] point in the tour he'd flip off the
[1:04:25] light and it was so dark you couldn't
[1:04:27] see your hand in front of your face
[1:04:29] remember the
[1:04:31] story amen there's a little a boy and a
[1:04:34] girl down there a brother and a sister
[1:04:36] amen and and when they flipped the light
[1:04:38] off the sister went into hysteric she
[1:04:39] was frighten she began to scream amen
[1:04:42] but the little boy knew the guide could
[1:04:44] turn on the
[1:04:47] light the little boy knew who was in
[1:04:49] control of the
[1:04:50] light and the little boy said Don't Fear
[1:04:53] little sister there's a man here that
[1:04:55] can turn on the light and this is the
[1:04:57] whole basis for brother Ben preaching
[1:04:59] this message there's a man here that can
[1:05:00] turn on the light and brother B said I
[1:05:03] know of another little sister amen our
[1:05:06] church that's in hysterics cuz it's so
[1:05:08] dark amen and so you got to look at this
[1:05:10] whole story playing out here's the
[1:05:12] little sister in the cabin but the
[1:05:13] little sister wasn't alone because in
[1:05:16] the darkness there was an older brother
[1:05:18] amen there was a brother brandom there
[1:05:20] was a prophet the older brother to the
[1:05:22] sister who knew the guy was here who
[1:05:25] could turn on the light and who was
[1:05:26] calling to the sister in this Dark Age
[1:05:29] it was the older brother the prophet of
[1:05:31] the age saying don't be afraid little
[1:05:33] church shalom it's good morning there's
[1:05:35] a man here that can turn on the
[1:05:38] lightall amen where were they they were
[1:05:41] in a little room under the
[1:05:44] Earth down under our Earth there's a
[1:05:47] little cave called The Soul amen and
[1:05:49] light hadn't shined on it yet it was
[1:05:51] dark but there's a guide that's present
[1:05:54] today and there's an older brother
[1:05:55] saying don't fear there's a man here
[1:05:58] that can turn on the light that's what
[1:06:00] the Apostle Paul met on the road to
[1:06:02] Damascus he met the man that could turn
[1:06:04] on the light who was it it was the guide
[1:06:06] who's the guide the Holy Ghost who is
[1:06:08] the Holy Ghost it's the life of God it's
[1:06:11] the life of Jesus Christ and there's a
[1:06:12] man here that could turn on the
[1:06:17] light
[1:06:19] amen and when the man turned on the
[1:06:22] light all of a sudden
[1:06:24] Paul could see yeah amen and he runs
[1:06:27] into Damascus the very place that he was
[1:06:29] going to go to arrest
[1:06:32] Christians to Snuff out the
[1:06:35] light now he goes into the synagogues
[1:06:38] and preaches to the Jews and confounds
[1:06:40] them teaching from the scriptures that
[1:06:44] Jesus was
[1:06:48] Christ why Paul was born to bear bear
[1:06:54] witness of the
[1:06:56] light he was born to bear that name he
[1:07:00] was born to carry that light he was born
[1:07:03] to Bear witness of the
[1:07:06] truth when everything changed for Paul
[1:07:09] so drastically changed he had met the
[1:07:12] pillar of fire he had met the same
[1:07:14] Pillar of Fire that Moses met in a
[1:07:16] burning
[1:07:17] bush he had met the same Pillar of Fire
[1:07:20] that led the children of Israel out of
[1:07:22] Egypt and you you would think that all
[1:07:25] of his old religious buddies would have
[1:07:27] been happy for
[1:07:29] him you would have thought the high
[1:07:31] priest and the elders and and those the
[1:07:33] students in the school of Gia they would
[1:07:35] be so thrilled amen that Paul come in
[1:07:38] contact with the same Pillar of Fire
[1:07:40] that they believ the same Pillar of Fire
[1:07:42] that they love the same one that spoke
[1:07:44] to Moses but no amen now when when the
[1:07:47] light was flipped on for Paul now Paul's
[1:07:49] carrying the light now it proves that
[1:07:51] they hate the light because they're
[1:07:53] Children of the Darkness amen and what
[1:07:56] do they immediately try to do they start
[1:07:58] trying to stop the manifestation of
[1:08:01] Isaiah
[1:08:02] 49
[1:08:06] amen they don't just let him go on and
[1:08:08] preach what he wants to preach and do
[1:08:10] what he wants to do and say it's fine
[1:08:13] no what immediately what they tried to
[1:08:16] do is they try to stop this manifested
[1:08:19] word from Shining
[1:08:21] Light this has always been the Devil's
[1:08:24] tactic amen when it was time for a
[1:08:26] deliverer to be born down in Goan in
[1:08:28] Egypt amen there was a prophecy laying
[1:08:30] there and the prophecy was showing that
[1:08:32] after 400 years God would bring them out
[1:08:34] with the mighty hand and they knew that
[1:08:36] God was going to send a deliverer to
[1:08:38] bring them out and when the time got to
[1:08:40] approaching near to where this baby
[1:08:42] needs to be born all of a sudden there
[1:08:44] was an anointing that struck Pharaoh
[1:08:46] amen where did that anointing come from
[1:08:48] on Pharaoh where he decided amen these
[1:08:50] people are multiplying too much we need
[1:08:52] to kill them and instead instead of
[1:08:54] killing all of them they said let's just
[1:08:55] kill the
[1:08:57] males let's just destroy the sons of the
[1:08:59] Hebrews what was that anointing that was
[1:09:02] the anointing of the devil trying to
[1:09:04] stop the manifestation of the promised
[1:09:06] word that's what he's always tried to do
[1:09:09] that's what he tried to do with with Eve
[1:09:11] that's what he tried to do in The Exodus
[1:09:13] Journey that's what he tried to do down
[1:09:15] in Bethlehem when Herod sent his
[1:09:17] soldiers down there to destroy all the
[1:09:18] children to and under what's he trying
[1:09:20] to do he's trying to stop the
[1:09:22] manifestation of the world
[1:09:26] he couldn't stop the word it was already
[1:09:29] spoken when Herod gathered the the
[1:09:31] scribes and the priests gather them
[1:09:33] together and say where will this child
[1:09:34] be born they knew they had the word they
[1:09:36] knew in Bethlehem they knew the prophecy
[1:09:39] he couldn't stop
[1:09:41] that so what was he trying to stop
[1:09:44] because he couldn't stop the word he
[1:09:45] tried to stop the manifestation of the
[1:09:48] word because it's the manifestation of
[1:09:51] the word that brings life oh yes that's
[1:09:54] what the devil
[1:09:56] hates as long as we can keep it in Pro
[1:09:59] prophetic word and keep it away from
[1:10:02] manifested word the devil can deal with
[1:10:05] that he's been dealing with it for years
[1:10:07] he brings confusion and different
[1:10:09] interpretation different ideas and he as
[1:10:11] long as he can he can't stop it from
[1:10:13] going forth It's Already Gone forth so
[1:10:15] he he he tries to just hold it here just
[1:10:18] don't let that prophesied word move into
[1:10:20] manifested word because that's dangerous
[1:10:22] for the devil
[1:10:27] on Amen Herod felt secure until the
[1:10:31] prophecy come into
[1:10:33] manifestation then his insecurity begin
[1:10:36] to
[1:10:38] show and the message
[1:10:40] Shalom the prophet said our heavenly
[1:10:42] father we now bring to you every hand
[1:10:45] that's up everywhere and let the Holy
[1:10:47] Ghost of God bring to them the rhythm of
[1:10:49] the word and its truth that they are to
[1:10:52] be molded now to Sons and Daughters of
[1:10:54] God and they are to be the reflecting of
[1:10:56] the light of God upon the Earth they are
[1:10:58] to be the manifested
[1:11:04] word oh I'm going to say something in
[1:11:07] just a minute there to be the reflecting
[1:11:11] of the light of God upon the Earth what
[1:11:14] are we supposed to be whatever Paul was
[1:11:16] we're supposed to
[1:11:18] be they are to be the reflecting of the
[1:11:21] light of God upon the Earth they are to
[1:11:24] be the manifested word that men and
[1:11:28] women are to live the way Jesus lived
[1:11:30] and to believe every word of God and
[1:11:32] live by it like he
[1:11:38] did
[1:11:42] this this what what I'm I'm dealing with
[1:11:45] and what I what I'm laboring in and
[1:11:47] what's in my
[1:11:49] heart we we cannot just be message
[1:11:53] believers
[1:11:55] and do any damage to the kingdom of
[1:11:59] Satan we cannot just be Believers of a
[1:12:02] truth and Believers of a word and
[1:12:04] Believers of a prophecy I mean we must
[1:12:07] be Believers don't get me wrong but if
[1:12:10] we stop at just believing or identifying
[1:12:12] that this is truth I know this this this
[1:12:15] and Truth amen the the believing has to
[1:12:18] move into
[1:12:20] manifestation and instead of I I I don't
[1:12:24] want to say anything wrong I'm so afraid
[1:12:25] that I'm always going to be Mook but you
[1:12:27] all know me by now so don't mistake me
[1:12:30] right we we've got to move from being
[1:12:32] message
[1:12:34] Believers to being the
[1:12:39] message because the prophet came to
[1:12:41] forun
[1:12:43] something and he come come to forrun a
[1:12:45] manifestation he came to forerun a
[1:12:48] declaration a happening upon the Earth
[1:12:50] amen and that what he came to for run
[1:12:52] was the coming of of the Lord and he
[1:12:54] came as an eleazer to unite The Head and
[1:12:56] the body the bridegroom and the bride
[1:12:58] amen and he did his work he United
[1:13:00] together and now that was the premise of
[1:13:02] the message amen was the bride coming of
[1:13:04] Christ but that can't just be something
[1:13:06] we talk about that can't be something we
[1:13:08] just believe in but that has to
[1:13:10] translate into a life it has to come to
[1:13:12] life and it has to become
[1:13:14] light because brother brandham said when
[1:13:17] when God said let there be light amen
[1:13:19] that was the word it was the spoken word
[1:13:21] of God and in that spoken word of God
[1:13:23] was the power to produce itself he said
[1:13:25] but you could question the word you
[1:13:26] could talk about it you could discuss it
[1:13:28] amen but and it didn't bring any seeds
[1:13:31] to life when he said let there be light
[1:13:33] amen potentially it was all there it was
[1:13:35] all in the power of God's word amen but
[1:13:37] it had to forego a transformation from
[1:13:40] spoken word to manifested word and when
[1:13:42] it manifested word it was light and that
[1:13:44] light brought life to those
[1:13:47] seeds
[1:13:50] amen we can talk yes but talk is
[1:13:55] cheap we can claim we believe things but
[1:13:57] when the Press really comes on what do
[1:13:59] we really believe it has to move from it
[1:14:01] has to move from word to manifested
[1:14:05] word let's look back again in John John
[1:14:09] 15 let's just spend a little bit time in
[1:14:16] this we had the the spoken word of
[1:14:22] God and the prophecies in the Old
[1:14:24] Testament about the seed that would come
[1:14:27] the son that would be born we had all
[1:14:30] those
[1:14:31] prophecies but really what started
[1:14:34] trouble was when the prophecy moved into
[1:14:37] manifestation that really started a
[1:14:39] whole load of
[1:14:40] trouble if you think about it listen if
[1:14:43] we just stop and think how many babies
[1:14:46] died in Bethlehem how many mothers
[1:14:51] cried h i mean think think of all the
[1:14:54] trouble that came because the word came
[1:14:56] into the manifestation and the devil
[1:14:58] wanted to stop that
[1:15:01] manifestation I I I'll go out on a limb
[1:15:03] I'm going to go out on a big
[1:15:05] limb but here we are in
[1:15:10] 2023 getting ready to move into
[1:15:12] 2024 and the devil is still trying to
[1:15:15] stop the manifestation of the sons of
[1:15:18] God and you think that abortion being
[1:15:21] legalized in America was just
[1:15:23] no he's trying to stop you and I from
[1:15:26] coming forward every tactic every not
[1:15:29] just abortion but but all the things
[1:15:31] that have flooded the Earth all the
[1:15:32] things that have flooded your mind all
[1:15:34] the things that have happened in your
[1:15:35] past all the troubles that have come
[1:15:37] what do you think the devil's afraid
[1:15:41] of he's afraid of the manifestation of
[1:15:44] this promised
[1:15:45] word amen
[1:15:49] amen let's look at John 15: 26
[1:15:57] but when the comforter has come whom I
[1:16:00] will send un you from the father even
[1:16:02] the spirit of Truth what did Jesus come

[1:16:07] to the Earth to Bear record of the truth
[1:16:09] to Bear witness of the truth amen now

[1:16:29] me from the beginning amen what is the
[1:16:32] what is the Holy Ghost he is the spirit
[1:16:34] of Truth what's he coming to do bear

[1:16:42] new birth under the baptism of Holy
[1:16:44] Ghost with the spirit of Truth we are
[1:16:45] here to Bear witness of the truth We are
[1:16:48] following in Christ's line that's why
[1:16:51] Jesus said in Acts when he was speaking
[1:16:53] to the disciples after his resurrection
[1:16:55] before his Ascension he said you shall
[1:16:57] receive power after the Holy Ghost has
[1:17:00] come upon you and you shall be Witnesses
[1:17:02] unto me both in Jerusalem and in all
[1:17:04] Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost
[1:17:07] part of the earth you know he didn't say
[1:17:10] you shall receive power after the Holy
[1:17:12] Ghost has come on you and you'll have
[1:17:14] gifts and Sensations and that'll be
[1:17:16] really exciting and a real blessing for

[1:18:43] seven Church age Messengers they had
[1:18:45] their
[1:18:46] people right Moses had his people amen

[1:19:14] just coming together and talking about
[1:19:16] the message but getting under it what is
[1:19:18] the token the very life of the message
[1:19:20] coming into me to what to live out the
[1:19:22] life of the word what I I am one of
[1:19:25] those people amen I'm not ashamed to say
[1:19:27] I'm one of those people I'm not a
[1:19:29] wesleyian amen I'm not a Lutheran amen
[1:19:32] but I'm a message believer of the end
[1:19:34] time message God sent a prophet
[1:19:36] according to the prophecies in the word
[1:19:37] of God according to Malachi 4 in Luke
[1:19:40] 17:30 God sent a man to fulfill that
[1:19:43] amen and there's people that follow that
[1:19:45] message and I'm one of those people and
[1:19:48] when he said their people I am their
[1:19:50] people their is included because T he e
[1:19:53] i there I am
[1:19:59] are do you find yourself in that
[1:20:02] statement now there people came and
[1:20:05] lived
[1:20:07] it I'm not just here to play a tape
[1:20:11] right right and then to keep walking in
[1:20:14] the earth as I am and to play another
[1:20:17] tape and say oh that's good word and
[1:20:20] read another message and come to another
[1:20:22] service say boy that's a good word
[1:20:23] that's exciting did you see how I
[1:20:25] connected that scripture and that
[1:20:26] scripture I never seen that before and
[1:20:28] you know friends that's amazing and
[1:20:30] that's wonderful and we should all get
[1:20:31] excited we all do get excited every True
[1:20:33] Believer gets excited about that but
[1:20:34] it's got to move from the enthusiasm of
[1:20:36] seeing a fulfillment of the word and now
[1:20:38] we've got to take that word and be the
[1:20:40] Fulfillment of that word when he
[1:20:43] instructs us on how to live we live it
[1:20:45] amen when he tells us how to honor God
[1:20:46] we do that to honor God when he tells us
[1:20:49] what's right and what's wrong amen their
[1:20:51] people take that word and live
[1:20:54] it amen and so I'm going to read it
[1:20:57] again now that we understand what's
[1:20:59] being said he says we find in each age
[1:21:01] when God said a certain thing would
[1:21:03] happen here come that man along and
[1:21:05] manifested that here come their people
[1:21:07] along and live
[1:21:10] that that's what I want to be I want to
[1:21:13] be one of their people that live that I
[1:21:15] want to be Associated and attached to
[1:21:17] this word that came and not just say I
[1:21:19] have a mental agreement with it I think
[1:21:20] it's all right but I want to manifest my
[1:21:23] faith in that word by living
[1:21:27] it I want to live the
[1:21:31] message he said then look at the next
[1:21:33] statement after he says this that was
[1:21:36] God himself living in the
[1:21:38] people because it was an answering of
[1:21:41] his
[1:21:43] word praise be to God when their people
[1:21:46] take that word amen that was manifest
[1:21:49] and preached through those men when
[1:21:50] their people take it and live it that's
[1:21:53] God himself being manifest in the
[1:21:56] people why because it's the word and God
[1:21:59] is the word and when the word's made
[1:22:00] manifest amen it's manifesting
[1:22:05] God praise
[1:22:08] God 2 Corinthians chapter 3 let's turn

[1:22:30] wonderful Easter is
[1:22:33] wonderful all of these things that we

[1:23:02] the religious Motions like so many
[1:23:04] others no it's Easter's got to be
[1:23:06] brought up today let's call him out of
[1:23:08] History amen that was Easter what a
[1:23:11] resurrection that was now let's go to
[1:23:13] the next statement what a resurrection
[1:23:14] this is what a birth of the word that
[1:23:18] was what a birth of the word this
[1:23:20] is that was the birth birth of the word
[1:23:23] the fullness of the word comeing to
[1:23:25] birth amen but the word has come back
[1:23:27] and being born in Sons and Daughters of
[1:23:29] God by the new birth Amen Let the birth
[1:23:31] be in me
[1:23:33] now let there be a Christmas in my
[1:23:37] heart second Corinthians chap
[1:23:40] 3:2 Paul says ye are our Epistles
[1:23:43] written in our hearts known and read of
[1:23:45] all men brother BR refers to this so
[1:23:47] many times about being written Epistles
[1:23:50] he says for as much as you are
[1:23:51] manifested ly declared to be the Epistle
[1:23:54] of Christ ministered by US Written not
[1:23:58] with ink but with the spirit of the
[1:23:59] Living God not in tables of stone but in
[1:24:03] the fleshly tables of the
[1:24:07] heart you're the Epistle of
[1:24:10] Christ when we read you know when we say
[1:24:13] turn to 1 Corinthians 2 Corinthians or
[1:24:15] first thess those are the
[1:24:17] Epistles right so when we when we turn
[1:24:21] to Ephesians that's theist to Paul
[1:24:23] what's epistle it's a letter it's a
[1:24:25] letter he wrote to the
[1:24:27] Ephesians when you the Epistle of 1 and
[1:24:30] 2 Corinthians the Epistle of 1 and
[1:24:32] second thessal those are Epistles and
[1:24:35] those Epistles were written amen by Paul
[1:24:37] and by Peter and by various
[1:24:40] ones but there's an
[1:24:42] epistle that's written of Christ amen
[1:24:47] that's what he says let's let's look at
[1:24:49] it again for as much as you are man
[1:24:52] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[1:24:56] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[1:24:59] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[1:25:02] God not in tables of stone but in the
[1:25:06] fleshly tables of your heart where
[1:25:08] Christ himself has come and written this
[1:25:10] epistle in it was ministered by Paul but
[1:25:13] it was Christ writing the word in your
[1:25:15] heart and now you're to be a written
[1:25:17] epistle read of all men now men are
[1:25:20] going to read what are they going to
[1:25:22] read they can't open up your heart and
[1:25:24] see what the spirit described they're
[1:25:25] reading your life and in reading your
[1:25:27] life they're reading the epistle that
[1:25:29] Christ wrote on the inside how will Men
[1:25:32] read this epistle that Christ wrote in
[1:25:35] me they will read it by my conduct my
[1:25:37] actions amen the way that I conduct and
[1:25:40] live my life is a epistle written the
[1:25:43] question is is it the writing of Christ
[1:25:45] that was written in the fleshly tables
[1:25:46] of my heart or is it some other writing
[1:25:48] that I'm declaring to the world Amen
[1:25:55] in Matthew 5 let's turn there together
[1:25:58] Matthew 5 and verse
[1:26:08] 14 Matthew 5:14 says ye are the light of
[1:26:13] the world Jesus said I'm the light of
[1:26:15] the world but now he's looking at his
[1:26:17] disciples you're the light of the world
[1:26:18] what makes them the light of the world
[1:26:20] when they are the word made manifest F
[1:26:22] they are the light of the world what's
[1:26:24] that mean when they're living the word
[1:26:27] for their day they're the light of the
[1:26:28] world am he said ye are the light of the
[1:26:31] world a city that is set on a hill
[1:26:33] cannot be hid neither do men light a
[1:26:35] candle and put it under a bushel but on
[1:26:37] a Candlestick and it giveth light unto
[1:26:39] all that are in the house let your light
[1:26:41] so shine before men that they may see
[1:26:44] your good works and glorify your father
[1:26:46] which is in heaven what is he talking
[1:26:48] about what kind of light it's a life
[1:26:50] lived before
[1:26:53] that's it the light lived before men
[1:26:55] that is your
[1:26:57] light brother bam said in the message
[1:26:59] turn on the light no life can come
[1:27:00] outside of light light produces light
[1:27:04] produces life there can be no life
[1:27:07] outside of light natural or spiritual
[1:27:09] there must be and only light can come by
[1:27:12] the word of God God's word is a light
[1:27:15] when it's
[1:27:16] manifested so life only comes by
[1:27:21] light brother man said life comes by
[1:27:24] light and God's word is light when it's
[1:27:29] manifested so what purpose were we born
[1:27:32] for why were we born again why are we
[1:27:34] here to manifest the light because light
[1:27:38] brings
[1:27:42] life this world is steeped in
[1:27:45] darkness but we're here to manifest the
[1:27:48] word amen we've been given the word to
[1:27:51] manifest the word
[1:27:53] we've not been given the word to keep it
[1:27:54] in a pocket we've not been given the
[1:27:55] word just to keep it in our mind we've
[1:27:57] been given the word to
[1:28:00] live and when that word by the spirit of
[1:28:03] God is Manifest fleshed out in our life
[1:28:06] it is the light of the age and light
[1:28:11] brings
[1:28:13] life Paul became the light to the
[1:28:19] Gentiles his old friends didn't like it
[1:28:21] and anymore his old buddies in seminary
[1:28:25] the high priest and the elders they
[1:28:28] didn't like it anymore so what did they
[1:28:30] tried to do they tried to stop him from
[1:28:33] manifesting
[1:28:35] light we're going to get down to the to
[1:28:39] the challenge of the
[1:28:41] day the challenge of the day is for us
[1:28:43] to manifest the light but the devil
[1:28:46] hates the manifested
[1:28:49] word that's what he's fighting
[1:28:52] he's fighting us amen he's fighting us
[1:28:54] to what to not manifest the
[1:28:57] word brother B made a couple statements
[1:29:00] here that and then I want to get into
[1:29:02] another thought in the trial he said
[1:29:04] Lord we believe this to be the last
[1:29:06] commission to the church we believe that
[1:29:08] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:29:09] us and we believe that any man is no
[1:29:12] better than his word therefore we
[1:29:13] believed that the word is you and we
[1:29:16] believe that it is you which the same
[1:29:18] yesterday today and forever come today
[1:29:20] oh father God in the form of the word to
[1:29:23] us and let the people see that thou art
[1:29:25] the Risen Christ and raised in this last
[1:29:28] day in the form that you said you would
[1:29:30] be in the manifested word is he raised
[1:29:34] in the last day yes in what form in the
[1:29:37] form of the manifested
[1:29:39] word then he
[1:29:43] says he said in the message things that
[1:29:45] are to be he said what is the word
[1:29:48] bride the manifestation of this hour
[1:29:53] what is she she is the manifested word
[1:29:56] for
[1:29:57] today which if she's the manifested word
[1:30:00] then she is to be the light of the world
[1:30:04] and this generation and light brings
[1:30:08] life
[1:30:10] amen but you
[1:30:12] know those in darkness hate the light
[1:30:16] Satan hates the light there was a quote
[1:30:19] that brother Ron read last Sunday and I
[1:30:22] was meditating on it as he was reading
[1:30:23] it there I've been thinking about it all
[1:30:25] week and I'm going to go I'm going to
[1:30:26] read it again in Revelation CH 4 verse
[1:30:30] three says nowadays there we we we don't
[1:30:33] believe in saying Hell in the Pulpit or
[1:30:35] Mercy or so blah we need men of God who
[1:30:38] won't hold back now everybody can't be a
[1:30:41] preacher but you got a voice and if you
[1:30:43] can't preach the people a sermon if
[1:30:44] you're a preacher you're called to the
[1:30:45] pulpit to preach if you're not you're
[1:30:47] still a preacher but live the people a
[1:30:50] sermon let your sermon be lived and it's
[1:30:53] the voice of God that will bring
[1:30:55] reproach to them who reject it why
[1:30:58] because it'll be the word made manifest
[1:31:02] in our lives our Holiness our conduct
[1:31:04] our our reverence to God all of these
[1:31:07] things that are manifest in our life
[1:31:09] amen it's it's a sermon that's lived
[1:31:11] amen and it's an epistle that's read of
[1:31:13] all
[1:31:14] men he said now he
[1:31:17] says
[1:31:20] uh he said oh my
[1:31:23] goodness I've lost my space anyways he
[1:31:26] said if you're a preacher you're called
[1:31:30] to the pulpit to preach if you're not
[1:31:31] you're still a preacher but live the
[1:31:32] people a sermon let your sermon be lived
[1:31:34] and it's the voice of God that will
[1:31:36] bring reproach to them who reject it
[1:31:38] they say no one could put a finger on
[1:31:39] his or her life they're sweet living if
[1:31:42] there ever was a man of God it's that
[1:31:44] man or woman or that woman see live your
[1:31:47] sermons don't try to preach them if
[1:31:49] you're not called to be a preacher
[1:31:50] you'll get all mixed up up anyhow and
[1:31:52] messed up and you'll get people tangled
[1:31:54] up and you know he said you'll ruin them
[1:31:57] and yourself too just live your sermon
[1:32:00] the preacher is called to preaches and
[1:32:01] to live it too so nobody gets out of

[1:33:01] shakes the devil why because that's the
[1:33:04] word made manifest that's what he's been
[1:33:07] fighting from Genesis all the way down
[1:33:09] through he can't fight the spoken word
[1:33:11] he's fighting the manifested word he's
[1:33:13] trying to prevent it pervert it God hold
[1:33:16] it down discredit it darken it give it
[1:33:18] an ugly name he's trying anything he can
[1:33:20] to get the people people away from the

[1:33:25] is the light that'll bring
[1:33:30] life he

[1:33:35] you say if I could preach like Billy
[1:33:37] gramar or Roberts or somebody a great
[1:33:39] influential speaker oh no sometimes the
[1:33:42] devil just laughs at that he don't pay
[1:33:44] no more attention to that to nothing you
[1:33:46] get all the theology you want to and all
[1:33:48] the Seminary training and devil just sit
[1:33:50] back and laugh at it but but when he
[1:33:52] sees that
[1:33:54] life what causes him to tremble that
[1:33:56] life what causes him to back up that
[1:33:59] life what what what what's he trying to
[1:34:01] shut down that
[1:34:03] life amen and if that's the Thunder that
[1:34:06] shakes the devil if that's the thing
[1:34:08] that hurts the devil if that's the voice
[1:34:10] of God thundering out in sweetness and
[1:34:12] Holiness amen then where is the
[1:34:14] Battleground today amen you can say the
[1:34:17] Battleground is is over amen I don't
[1:34:20] even know what we would say what the
[1:34:21] world would say where the Battleground
[1:34:23] is over truth but I'll tell you where
[1:34:25] the Battleground is the Battleground is
[1:34:27] right in your life the devil trying to
[1:34:29] stop you from manifesting the word
[1:34:32] that's where the fight is taking place
[1:34:34] because that's what he wants to stop
[1:34:35] amen he's tried to discredit the message
[1:34:38] amen he's tried to prove by by by proofs
[1:34:40] and evidences that brother Brenham was
[1:34:42] wrong and he he may continue to try that
[1:34:44] attack amen the problem that he's having
[1:34:46] is no matter what discrepancies he shows
[1:34:49] there's a life being manifested that
[1:34:51] message was the
[1:34:54] truth the Apostle Paul says you are our
[1:34:57] Epistles amen you are the letter you are
[1:34:59] the evidence read of all men amen you
[1:35:01] were ministered by us but written by
[1:35:03] Christ in your heart amen and the same
[1:35:05] exact thing is true today amen the
[1:35:07] evidence of the message is not amen the
[1:35:10] testimonies that we can piece together
[1:35:12] and it's not our understand no the
[1:35:14] evidence of the message amen is the
[1:35:16] message was calling forth for Christ to
[1:35:18] come in the formation of the Bride that
[1:35:20] there would be a people on the earth
[1:35:22] that would manifest the very life of
[1:35:24] Jesus Christ that's the evidence that
[1:35:26] the message is
[1:35:28] true that's the Battleground that's the
[1:35:31] fight that's where the devil's fighting
[1:35:34] amen we tried to defend the message and
[1:35:37] say no there was 16 men on the bridge no
[1:35:39] there's a testimony that men fell on the
[1:35:41] bridge how many they didn't count them
[1:35:43] just a bunch of men and the Andy listen
[1:35:44] forget that argument you're never going
[1:35:47] to prove anything by trying to prove
[1:35:49] details and testimonies forget all that
[1:35:51] if you want to prove the message then
[1:35:53] you take that message in your heart
[1:35:55] surrender your life to Christ and say
[1:35:57] God transform that word into my life and
[1:36:00] that's the epistle that's read of all
[1:36:02] men that's the testimony that this
[1:36:04] message is the truth it's the word made
[1:36:07] manifest in our
[1:36:09] lives that's the fight friends yeah
[1:36:12] that's where the battle is right there
[1:36:14] trying to get you amen quiet trying to
[1:36:17] get you discredited trying to get you
[1:36:19] cold and indifferent trying to keep you
[1:36:21] from being RedHot on fire sold out
[1:36:24] absolutely consecrated and dedicated to
[1:36:26] this message that's the battle that's
[1:36:28] why Leo deia is trying to creep in
[1:36:30] constantly that's why entertainments are
[1:36:32] always moving in that's why
[1:36:34] disappointment and discouragement is
[1:36:35] piling on top of you he's trying to stop
[1:36:38] the manifestation of the word in your
[1:36:43] life that's the battle and when we don't
[1:36:46] recognize the battle amen we start
[1:36:48] falling into all kinds of trap
[1:36:55] s you know brother B said in spoken
[1:36:58] words The Original Seed he said Jesus
[1:37:01] was born to destroy the works of the
[1:37:04] devil that's what he was born for to
[1:37:07] destroy the works of the devil he said
[1:37:09] his body is to do the same so what were
[1:37:13] you born for to destroy the works of the
[1:37:16] devil how are you going to destroy the
[1:37:18] works of the devil well let's back up to
[1:37:20] the th that shakes the devil let's go to
[1:37:23] the thing that actually hurts the
[1:37:26] devil it's that consecrated sweet humble
[1:37:29] life sold out and dedicated to
[1:37:35] God Amen I say many times I've said
[1:37:38] before I said it I think Wednesday our
[1:37:42] struggle may not be poverty our struggle
[1:37:45] may not be religious persecution our
[1:37:47] struggle is soft living right right
[1:37:51] right amen and we all struggle with it
[1:37:55] right but I want to be aware of the
[1:37:57] devil in all of his
[1:38:06] tactics brother says in the message
[1:38:09] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:38:10] light said life is only by the word of
[1:38:13] God made
[1:38:14] manifest I I just love that he says this
[1:38:16] over and over and over again life is
[1:38:19] only by the word of God made manif
[1:38:21] EST the word has to
[1:38:25] live the word has to become
[1:38:28] light life comes only by the word of God
[1:38:31] made manifest as long as it's in just in
[1:38:33] the book like this it's still can to be
[1:38:35] questioned but when it's made manifest
[1:38:38] then you see the product of what he
[1:38:40] spoke of being manifested then that is
[1:38:42] light on the
[1:38:44] word that's what brings the word said so
[1:38:47] and then when it comes to pass that is
[1:38:50] life in life light bringing Life Light
[1:38:53] brings life what light when the word
[1:38:57] takes on flesh and my flesh and begins
[1:39:00] to manifest the message of the hour
[1:39:01] begins to live the word amen that brings
[1:39:04] a light and that light can bring life
[1:39:07] that's what the devil doesn't want he
[1:39:09] doesn't want your light to bring life to
[1:39:12] another seed yeah amen right remember
[1:39:16] when when remember when Gabriel came to
[1:39:18] Mary and Mary was told amen that she was
[1:39:21] going to now bear Christ she was going
[1:39:22] to be the Fulfillment of Isaiah chapter
[1:39:24] 7 amen and that was a hard thing for a
[1:39:27] little virgin girl from nowhere a nobody
[1:39:29] from nowhere to absorb and to believe
[1:39:31] that that you remember the prophecy you
[1:39:33] heard in Isaiah 7 a virgin shall
[1:39:35] conceive yeah I've heard it all my life
[1:39:37] it was a Sunday School uh uh memory
[1:39:39] verse that I I got a star on my chart
[1:39:41] from
[1:39:43] remembering and Gabriel says that's
[1:39:46] you you're that scripture Isaiah was
[1:39:49] talking about you God had you in mind
[1:39:51] before the found I mean that may not be
[1:39:54] the dialogue that took place but that
[1:39:55] was the point of the
[1:39:58] conversation and now this little girl
[1:40:00] she had to come to terms with the fact
[1:40:02] that she was the word yeah Amen in her
[1:40:07] flesh is going to be the manifestation
[1:40:10] of that word that word was speaking
[1:40:12] about her she is the manifestation that
[1:40:15] word is going to come to light and bear
[1:40:17] light in her
[1:40:19] flesh and you know what because she's a
[1:40:22] seed of God she believed it amen she had
[1:40:25] some questions she had some concerns but
[1:40:27] after talking to the uh Angel amen the
[1:40:29] angel told her you're it and she
[1:40:31] believed it she received it you know
[1:40:33] what she became she became the light of
[1:40:35] her
[1:40:36] hour is that right she was the word made
[1:40:40] manifest she was light and that light
[1:40:41] can bring life and now she finds out
[1:40:43] she's got a cousin and that cousin also
[1:40:46] has a word inside of her amen a
[1:40:48] predestinated word in her because
[1:40:50] there's there's a prophecy in Malachi 3
[1:40:53] there's a prophecy in Isaiah of one that
[1:40:55] will prepare the way of the Lord that
[1:40:57] make straight his path there's a word
[1:40:59] now that word is laying in
[1:41:02] Elizabeth we're on the same page now her
[1:41:04] cousin Elizabeth has the word in her now
[1:41:07] Mary has the word in her that's been
[1:41:09] quickened to life the problem is
[1:41:11] Elizabeth has not felt the quickening
[1:41:13] power yet this word is laying there dead
[1:41:15] in her womb that's right the word is in
[1:41:18] her but the word has no life it's dead
[1:41:21] brother man said she never felt the baby
[1:41:23] kick yet it was dead it was 6 months she
[1:41:25] was starting to get
[1:41:30] concerned I love the word of
[1:41:34] God no doubt she had
[1:41:37] prayed God I don't feel anything you
[1:41:40] promised in your word amen your your
[1:41:43] angel said to Zachariah amen we we know
[1:41:46] that this is the the the one that's
[1:41:48] coming and I don't feel anything there's
[1:41:50] no change in my life I it feels dead
[1:41:52] like it's not alive amen and and she
[1:41:55] could pray she could ask Zechariah to
[1:41:57] pray they may even fast and pray amen
[1:41:59] but what is it going to take it's going
[1:42:01] to take that little virgin girl with the
[1:42:02] word awake inside of her the manifested
[1:42:05] word for her day when she comes in
[1:42:07] contact with Elizabeth and she begins to
[1:42:09] declare the message that she received
[1:42:12] that this I'm blessed of the Lord I'm
[1:42:14] going to have a baby his name is Jesus
[1:42:16] and when she heard that word that had
[1:42:18] come to life and and and and Mary the
[1:42:21] word in Mary that was alive brought the
[1:42:23] word laying dormant in Elizabeth and it
[1:42:25] sprung to life life came to life word
[1:42:28] came to word manifested word came to
[1:42:31] promis word and it sprung to life in her
[1:42:33] womb and started leaping and jumping
[1:42:35] around you think your testimony doesn't
[1:42:37] do anything it's your testimony that
[1:42:40] brings
[1:42:43] lies amen you're not just here to take
[1:42:46] up space you're not just here to breathe
[1:42:48] oxygen in and out you're not just here
[1:42:50] to to retire and have a retirement
[1:42:52] you're here to testify of the truth
[1:42:55] that's why we are born we have been born
[1:42:57] and we've come into this life to testify
[1:42:59] of the truth so that the truth in us
[1:43:01] being manifest can bring a seed that's
[1:43:04] laying dormant somewhere else to
[1:43:07] life let it be
[1:43:10] Christmas all over
[1:43:15] again this is why the distractions of
[1:43:18] the world are so wicked yeah
[1:43:21] right the prophet of God would come and
[1:43:23] warn us away from entertainment he would
[1:43:25] warn us away from religion he would warn
[1:43:27] us away from all the trappings of the
[1:43:29] world he wasn't trying to bring us into
[1:43:31] legalism he wasn't trying to make us
[1:43:34] amen into some monks or some nuns what
[1:43:36] he was trying to do is break away all
[1:43:38] the little suckers that suck the life
[1:43:40] away all the little distractions that
[1:43:42] distract us away from what our purpose
[1:43:44] and intent really is amen and anytime
[1:43:47] somebody comes down and starts preaching
[1:43:49] about watching movies and going to these
[1:43:51] places and running around in
[1:43:52] entertainment we start to say legalism
[1:43:55] it isn't legalism those things are
[1:43:57] driving you away from the very purpose
[1:43:59] that you're
[1:44:00] here amen spending hours searching the
[1:44:03] web all this time bringing nonsense into
[1:44:06] our minds amen we've got to find out why

[1:45:27] we've got a calling we've got to shed
[1:45:29] the light and the devil's trying to
[1:45:31] choke it down amen remember the seed

[1:45:40] life amen the devil's trying to use the
[1:45:42] circumstances in this life to choke out

[1:45:47] life to
[1:45:49] manifest we we get tied up in all kinds
[1:45:51] of things amen and and some of those
[1:45:53] things are absolutely unavoidable they

[1:46:57] about it that whenever you make up your
[1:46:59] mind that you're going to see him there
[1:47:01] isn't nothing going to stop you but
[1:47:03] remember when you make up your mind then
[1:47:05] the devil is going to do everything he
[1:47:07] can to stop you he's determined that
[1:47:10] you're not going to understand it you're

[1:47:15] black sheet across he can to keep you
[1:47:18] from seeing it what is he trying to stop
[1:47:21] he's trying to stop the manifestation of
[1:47:23] the word in your
[1:47:27] life and things that are to
[1:47:30] be he says the gene of your life
[1:47:33] spiritual life was in God the Father
[1:47:35] before there was even a
[1:47:37] molecule and you're nothing but the
[1:47:39] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:47:41] was in God as a Son of
[1:47:44] God now you're expressed after his word
[1:47:47] has come in you to light up this age you
[1:47:49] are expressing God's light life in you
[1:47:51] because you are a son or daughter of God
[1:47:53] therefore you get what I mean see you
[1:47:57] are now made you're sitting in this
[1:48:00] church tonight because your duty is to
[1:48:02] express God to this nation and this

[1:48:07] associate God has coming to you to light
[1:48:10] up this
[1:48:12] age this age is steeped in darkness but
[1:48:16] there's still a
[1:48:17] light the church world's gone into
[1:48:19] absolute apostasy but there's still a
[1:48:22] light and Lord help me not to let that
[1:48:26] light get darkened because of the
[1:48:28] circumstances I find myself in because
[1:48:31] of getting distracted by troubles or
[1:48:34] getting distracted by Pleasures or
[1:48:36] getting derailed by circumstances or
[1:48:38] getting overwhelmed God help me not to
[1:48:41] lose sight of my purpose amen Jesus
[1:48:44] always knew what his purpose was when he
[1:48:46] was 12 years old amen he told Mary and
[1:48:48] Joseph I must be about my father's
[1:48:50] business he had a Clear Vision of why he
[1:48:52] was on the earth amen and by the message
[1:48:54] of the hour we have a Clear Vision why
[1:48:56] we're on this
[1:48:57] Earth and help me God not to stay away
[1:49:01] from all the devices of the devil that's
[1:49:03] trying to obscure my vision and stop me
[1:49:05] from manifesting this
[1:49:07] life because this is the
[1:49:10] testimony your life my life is the
[1:49:13] testimony that this message is the truth
[1:49:18] yes revelation 22
[1:49:21] 217 very end of the Bible when we get to
[1:49:23] the very last last few verses says in
[1:49:27] the spirit and the bride say
[1:49:32] come that's the day we live in
[1:49:35] friends that's our calling we are here
[1:49:39] to Bear witness of the
[1:49:41] light and just as Herod sent out his his
[1:49:45] army to try to kill that manifestation
[1:49:48] before it could take off the devil has
[1:49:50] sent his army after you and I to try to
[1:49:52] kill the
[1:49:54] manifestation tried to kill it in church
