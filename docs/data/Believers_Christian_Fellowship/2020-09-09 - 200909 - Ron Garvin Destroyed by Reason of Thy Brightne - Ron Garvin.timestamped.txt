[4:26] me
[4:30] praise the lord god bless you it's good
[4:33] to see each one of you today
[4:39] let's turn to ezekiel chapter 28.
[4:49] i just like to open with the word of
[4:52] prayer before we read the
[4:54] scripture so if you just bow your heads
[4:57] with me
[4:58] heavenly father we know the prayers have
[5:01] been
[5:01] made lord and the songs have been sung
[5:04] and the praise and the worship lord
[5:06] and as we've prepared our hearts to hear
[5:08] the word lord
[5:10] and we come to this portion lord to hear
[5:12] from you lord
[5:13] and i pray that each one has come with
[5:15] an expectation lord and a
[5:17] a desire on their heart lord
[5:20] to to get something from you lord to
[5:24] give something
[5:24] but also to get something lord it's a
[5:27] needy day and age lord and if
[5:28] if we think we're without need i don't
[5:31] know where we're
[5:32] living it's just a wicked world with
[5:35] influences all around us lord so we just
[5:37] pray father that you would
[5:39] speak something to our hearts lord
[5:41] tonight
[5:42] that would be a blessing of eternal
[5:44] value lord and i'm
[5:46] very aware lord that i'm not capable of
[5:48] delivering that
[5:50] so i'm not intimidated by that lord
[5:52] because
[5:53] we just come yielded and just ask you to
[5:56] use
[5:57] myself lord and i pray that you'd anoint
[5:59] the hearers lord
[6:01] because i know how much i can fumble
[6:02] around and not be
[6:04] understood and and lord we just ask you
[6:07] to anoint the ears
[6:08] to take the words that are spoken lord
[6:11] and uh
[6:12] apply them to the lives of each
[6:14] individual lord you're able
[6:16] you're capable of doing that and i know
[6:18] that you will
[6:19] for each one that comes with an
[6:20] expectation when it comes to the desire
[6:23] on their heart
[6:23] i know that you'll meet that need lord
[6:25] because you're faithful and we thank you
[6:27] for it
[6:27] so we just commit the service to you
[6:29] lord i commit myself the congregation
[6:31] lord the words that will be spoken
[6:33] which is place it in your hands for your
[6:34] honor glory in jesus name
[6:36] amen praise the lord
[6:40] ezekiel chapter 28 very familiar
[6:42] scripture
[6:44] and i want you to hold your place in
[6:46] ezekiel if if you want to follow
[6:48] along because we'll be referring back to
[6:49] this quite often
[6:51] through the service and like i say very
[6:54] familiar scripture
[6:57] verse 12-17
[7:00] son of man take up a lamentation upon
[7:02] the king of tyrus
[7:04] and say unto him thus saith the lord god
[7:06] thou sealest up the sum
[7:08] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
[7:11] like i say i know this is familiar to us
[7:13] but let's just look at it afresh again
[7:16] and just see
[7:17] what because we're god's addressing the
[7:20] spirit that anointed the king of tyrus
[7:23] lucifer and let's just take a look
[7:26] a fresh look at his uh characteristics
[7:32] you won't find anything negative amongst
[7:34] these
[7:36] to start with anyway full of wisdom
[7:39] perfect in beauty
[7:40] the aspen in eden the garden of god
[7:42] every precious stone was thy covering
[7:44] the sardis topaz the diamond the burl
[7:47] the onyx the jasper the sapphire the
[7:49] emerald
[7:50] the carbuncle and the gold the
[7:52] workmanship of thy tablets and of thy
[7:53] pipes was prepared in thee
[7:55] in the day that thou was created thou
[7:57] art the anointed cherub that covereth
[7:59] and i have set thee so
[8:00] thou wasted upon the holy mountain of
[8:02] god thus walked up and down in the midst
[8:04] of the stones of fire
[8:06] that was perfect in thy ways from the
[8:07] day that thou was created
[8:09] till iniquity was found in thee by the
[8:11] multitude of thy merchandise they have
[8:13] filled the midst of thee with violence
[8:15] and thou hast sinned therefore i will
[8:17] cast thee as profane
[8:19] out of the mountain of god and i will
[8:20] destroy the old covering cherub
[8:22] from the midst to the stones of fire
[8:24] thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[8:26] beauty
[8:27] thou hast corrupted thy wisdom he didn't
[8:29] say you didn't have wisdom
[8:31] he didn't say he didn't have beauty but
[8:33] because of thy beauty
[8:35] thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[8:38] of thy brightness
[8:39] i will cast it to the ground i will lay
[8:41] thee before kings that they may behold
[8:43] thee
[8:44] and it goes on to speak of his
[8:47] destruction
[8:48] like the title the thought this evening
[8:50] destroyed
[8:51] by reason of thy brightness taking that
[8:54] from verse 17.
[8:55] now this is reminiscent of what brother
[8:56] chad preached back in
[8:59] july i think it was he preached two
[9:01] sermons one was
[9:04] i was paying attention really brother
[9:05] chad i was uh
[9:10] the danger of having it too good and i
[9:12] think another one was uh
[9:15] strength without weakness is a weakness
[9:17] so this may be a little review on that
[9:20] but if you're like me you probably
[9:21] forgot it and we'll just refresh
[9:23] because paul admonished timothy that if
[9:26] you remind the brethren you'll be a
[9:28] faithful minister so we're going to be
[9:29] faithful
[9:30] to remind you and uh we just want to
[9:32] take a fresh look
[9:34] uh through this uh vessel we
[9:37] we know i'm uh you know me and it's not
[9:40] gonna be
[9:42] something deep it's gonna be something
[9:43] you're gonna put in your pocket and
[9:45] you're gonna be held accountable for it
[9:47] so we're we're not gonna let you off the
[9:48] hook we're not here for cupcakes and
[9:52] ice cream social we're here for the word
[9:54] of god so
[9:55] so look past the vessel let's see what
[9:57] he has to share with us today
[10:00] so we know that god wasn't addressing
[10:01] the king of tyrus but he's addressing
[10:03] that
[10:03] anointing that spirit that was anointing
[10:05] him which was lucifer and we're very
[10:07] familiar that we've been taught that
[10:09] all along uh lucifer was a perfect
[10:13] uh a being an angel a cherub i don't
[10:15] know the difference i'm not a teacher i
[10:17] can't break all that down that's not the
[10:19] purpose today
[10:20] but let's say that he was more than just
[10:21] an angel there was angels but he was
[10:23] more than just an angel
[10:24] he had a special position the covering
[10:27] cherub now i'd say that's pretty high up
[10:29] in the order of god
[10:30] and you know we're not going to dig out
[10:32] those things all the brother branham
[10:34] said on that we're not
[10:34] studying lucifer we're trying to apply
[10:37] something to ourselves today
[10:39] we're not trying to go back go home
[10:41] educated about lucifer today
[10:43] we want to go home educated or with a
[10:46] revelation
[10:47] of ourselves and we want to see in the
[10:50] mirror of the word ourselves where
[10:52] you can hold up a mirror and you can
[10:55] hold it at an angle
[10:56] if it's skewed they call it if it's
[10:58] skewed you can look at your brother you
[11:01] can look at everybody and not see
[11:02] yourself
[11:03] but that's not the purpose of the mirror
[11:06] that's to get a
[11:07] look at yourself so let's take the word
[11:09] and examine ourselves this evening
[11:11] so he was the covering cherub you know i
[11:14] don't know how special of an angelic
[11:16] being this was
[11:17] but he was above the ordinary let's just
[11:19] let it suffice and say that
[11:21] and god had made him this way but he
[11:23] fell because it became lifted up
[11:25] and pride was his downfall and like i
[11:28] said you don't know that i'm not a
[11:29] teacher i'm not going to approach it as
[11:30] a teacher
[11:31] a teacher could pull so many things on
[11:33] here out of here and we would just
[11:34] really
[11:35] enjoy that and be blessed by it but i'm
[11:37] going to try to extract a simple lesson
[11:40] that and just let god magnify that
[11:44] to you by revelation uh
[11:47] you know we're not here for an education
[11:49] we're here for revelation
[11:51] god brother braham didn't say pray for
[11:53] education
[11:54] pray for information he said pray for
[11:56] revelation
[11:58] so brother chad read a quote the other
[11:59] night uh from 1960 adoption
[12:03] series where he said teaching places a
[12:05] man positionally what he is
[12:07] and we want to be placed and part of
[12:09] that being placed as
[12:11] as uh you know knowing your position
[12:14] and staying in it uh you know it's not
[12:16] just good to know where you're placed
[12:18] you know that's my spot over there if
[12:20] you're not in it
[12:21] it's done you no good to learn that so
[12:23] if you want to benefit from it you've
[12:25] got to get in your position you've got
[12:26] to get in your place
[12:28] and brother braham told us not to try to
[12:30] take another man's place
[12:31] don't try to be a billy graham of course
[12:33] maybe the younger crowd doesn't know
[12:35] billy graham but in brother branham's
[12:36] day that was the
[12:37] you know pre-eminent minister so whoever
[12:40] the preeminent minister is in your mind
[12:42] or the preeminent christian oh if i
[12:44] could be like brother son so if i could
[12:45] be like sister son so that's that's no
[12:47] good
[12:47] you are you are who you are and that's
[12:49] who you need to be
[12:50] so i i guess just give me a chance to
[12:53] preach it myself and not try to be
[12:55] somebody else
[12:56] so we know that uh i'm no preacher no
[13:00] teacher so
[13:01] we don't want to get get over there and
[13:03] try to be that and just make a mess of
[13:05] things
[13:06] uh you know the uh the teacher
[13:09] places positionally where we are and who
[13:12] we are
[13:12] you know working in construction you've
[13:15] got the guys that
[13:16] run the heavy machinery equipment
[13:18] operators and they place
[13:20] the large heavy objects whatever it is a
[13:22] bridge beam or a
[13:24] air conditioner on top of a skyscraper
[13:27] with a helicopter
[13:28] and oh we admire those guys that do that
[13:31] but what if the helicopter operator
[13:34] set that uh air conditioner unit on top
[13:37] of that skyscraper and 100 stories up
[13:39] and there was nobody there to bolt it
[13:41] down his work's in vain
[13:43] there's nobody there to hook it up now
[13:45] nobody sees that guy
[13:46] one guy down there with a wrench
[13:48] tightening things up
[13:49] but we need him so uh we'll let brother
[13:53] chad do the do the teaching and i'll
[13:55] just crank down the bolts okay
[13:58] praise the lord so don't squeal when i
[13:59] get the cranking on you
[14:01] amen just say amen
[14:05] uh-oh i already hear an amens so uh
[14:08] so we've got to find our spot for me to
[14:10] be in my position
[14:12] i've got to stay there if it's just a
[14:14] bolt tightener
[14:15] that's what i want to be can't be of any
[14:18] uh help
[14:19] trying to run the other guy's job
[14:22] so i knew the same so we all admire
[14:26] those heavy lifters but
[14:28] if we're not a heavy lifter stay out of
[14:29] that position
[14:31] so let me uh make a little confession
[14:34] here
[14:35] and maybe this will help somebody else
[14:36] as well
[14:38] i was raised in the message but was
[14:41] never raised around
[14:42] a ministering gift
[14:48] i guess 40 some years you know
[14:51] in a in a message church but really
[14:54] didn't
[14:55] the pastors there did not have a
[14:58] ministering gift and we didn't have a
[14:59] lot of
[14:59] or a lot of didn't have a teaching gift
[15:01] we didn't have a lot of teaching gifts
[15:03] coming through
[15:04] so it's kind of a foreign thing to me
[15:07] and
[15:08] it's always been a little bit hard for
[15:09] me to receive from that and maybe even
[15:12] be a little skeptical because i knew
[15:14] that quote that brother chad read and
[15:15] i'm going to read it to you here again
[15:17] out of adoption 1960 it says bible
[15:20] teaching is usually a little treacherous
[15:22] and who wants to be in a tractor's
[15:24] position a little you know kind of
[15:26] walking out on thin ice now who wants to
[15:28] walk on thin ice
[15:30] not me
[15:33] but let's not quit reading the quote and
[15:34] i appreciate brother chad going on with
[15:36] it
[15:36] he says further on says at this time it
[15:39] might be good kind of to bring the
[15:40] church to what i think
[15:41] to a complete understanding position
[15:44] that
[15:45] who wants an incomplete understanding
[15:46] any volunteers for that
[15:48] so we want to come to a complete
[15:50] understanding positionally what we are
[15:52] in christ jesus
[15:53] and sometimes i think that preaching is
[15:54] a wonderful thing but i believe
[15:56] sometimes brother biller that teaching
[15:58] goes beyond that
[16:00] i probably knew that part also
[16:04] but you know satan let's put a little
[16:06] fear a little hesitation
[16:08] a little apprehension there because of
[16:10] that thin ice thing and who wants to be
[16:12] on thin ice
[16:14] and continuing on now preaching usually
[16:16] catches a sinner
[16:17] brings him under condemnation by the
[16:19] word but teaching places a man
[16:21] positionally what he is
[16:22] and we can never rightly be able to have
[16:24] faith until we have
[16:26] until we positionally know what we are
[16:29] so if we can never rightly know we need
[16:31] the teacher
[16:33] i don't care maybe i'm well this church
[16:36] has been raised
[16:37] with teaching ministry very prominent in
[16:39] it so maybe i'm speaking to somebody
[16:41] that's streaming or archiving
[16:44] the service we need each gift
[16:47] we need that teaching yeah it's a little
[16:49] thin ice maybe it's a little hard
[16:51] especially if you've not been
[16:52] around it uh been
[16:55] used to it accustomed to it maybe it's a
[16:57] little difficult
[16:58] to uh a little apprehensive about it
[17:01] but we need it so let's uh let's just
[17:04] get past our apprehension
[17:06] and uh and accept the gifts of god
[17:09] so maybe i'm speaking to somebody like i
[17:11] say that's uh
[17:12] that's been there or is there you know
[17:15] why
[17:16] if i could look back at myself and if i
[17:17] could go back in the years past and say
[17:20] you know i could ask myself why are you
[17:22] skeptical of it well
[17:23] it's thin ice but if god put a teacher
[17:26] there
[17:27] and it's god's gift do you think he
[17:30] probably equipped him with the ability
[17:32] to teach do you think he probably
[17:34] equipped him with the ability to skate
[17:36] on thin ice
[17:37] amen now a lumbering
[17:41] uh clawed like myself just better stay
[17:44] off thin ice
[17:45] that ain't no place place for me to be
[17:48] but
[17:48] the teacher is equipped with that you
[17:50] know why would you
[17:51] you know what a water strider is they'll
[17:53] go back to just speaking about nature
[17:55] water strider i think it's got six legs
[17:57] look like a big spider it just floats on
[17:59] top of the water
[18:00] and if you look at it it's his feet are
[18:03] there on the water
[18:05] but not sinking he's equipped
[18:09] now you and i say don't do that don't
[18:10] get in the water
[18:12] you better not get in the water but he
[18:14] can he can go right across it
[18:16] skip right across it god's equipped him
[18:18] for that uh
[18:19] if if you're a turtle you know don't try
[18:22] it you know
[18:22] you're going to sink so let's let the
[18:25] water strider be a water strider let's
[18:27] let the teacher be
[18:28] a teacher let's let him skate on thin
[18:29] ice god's equipped him for that
[18:31] and let's be blessed by it he may not
[18:33] have the gift of evangelize like brother
[18:35] chad was saying you know
[18:36] maybe not so good at uh making an altar
[18:38] call and and doing those things but
[18:40] well that's just just let god be god and
[18:43] use you as
[18:44] he as he uh desires to use us
[18:48] let's get in our place let's stay there
[18:52] every gift is one that god has placed in
[18:54] the in the body so
[18:56] let's let's make use of each one of them
[18:59] why would god place the five-fold
[19:01] ministry
[19:02] a teacher and then never use him to
[19:04] teach just
[19:05] sit on the light sidelines there and
[19:09] god doesn't do it that way it's a
[19:10] five-fold ministry and
[19:12] god gives him ability gives evangelist
[19:14] the ability to do that he gives each one
[19:15] of us ability to do whatever we do
[19:17] and i'm i don't want to come up here
[19:19] trying to do
[19:21] what i do i just want to come get out of
[19:23] the way and let him take the gift
[19:25] and bless you with it so it's a little
[19:27] intimidating to
[19:29] to stand up and speak and i'm sure i've
[19:32] uh related that to you before
[19:34] but i've got to walk in confidence that
[19:36] it's god's placing
[19:38] it's god's gift and he can do something
[19:39] with that if i'll let him
[19:41] if i'll let him use his gift as he wants
[19:43] to use it so
[19:45] you just suffer through be blessed by it
[19:47] because it's god's gift
[19:50] so praise the lord
[19:54] so people you know we look back i
[19:58] have no people that they don't believe
[19:59] in a five-fold ministry they believe in
[20:01] a one-fold ministry you know
[20:03] profit and profit only and then there's
[20:05] others that believe in fourfold ministry
[20:07] you know
[20:08] take all but the evangelists maybe maybe
[20:10] a threefold they don't want the teacher
[20:12] or the evangelist
[20:13] uh what what use do we have enough of a
[20:15] missionary an apostle you know we're
[20:17] here in america
[20:19] they're limiting god to twofold
[20:20] threefold fourfold
[20:22] uh you know that's almost like brother
[20:25] brandon talked about the trinitarians
[20:26] the
[20:26] oneness the twoness the threeness so
[20:28] what are you one two three four or five
[20:30] this
[20:31] you know what what what are you to limit
[20:33] god to he's got a five-fold ministry
[20:35] let's let's let him use that
[20:37] uh and uh sure we recognize the error
[20:41] when somebody
[20:41] gets up and tries to do something that
[20:43] they're not equipped to do
[20:45] but it's just a scarecrow and we've got
[20:47] to look past that and just
[20:49] and just trust the lord to uh to use his
[20:52] gifts to bless us so
[20:54] i'm i'm appreciating the teaching that
[20:57] we're receiving
[20:58] and been blessed by it but i think it's
[21:01] just individuals
[21:03] that want to re when they want to refuse
[21:06] a portion of the ministry which is a
[21:07] portion of god himself
[21:09] if they want to refuse that it's pride
[21:11] lifting themselves up
[21:13] which is kind of the subject today
[21:15] speaking about pride
[21:16] lucifer's pride that lifted him up
[21:20] when we become lifted up in pride and we
[21:23] don't want to subject ourselves
[21:24] to the evangelist because he's just too
[21:26] loud i don't like his presentation he's
[21:28] just in your face he's rude he's just
[21:31] uh we can come up with all kinds of
[21:34] excuses because we don't want to be hit
[21:36] and touched by that gift that god's
[21:39] going to use
[21:40] we don't want the teacher to get up and
[21:42] and and destroy our theology that
[21:44] we thought we had all figured out but
[21:46] then the gift of god comes through
[21:48] and places it because if if you and i
[21:50] are not places
[21:51] teachers we may think we've got it all
[21:52] figured out and the teacher comes and
[21:54] lays it all out and it's contrary to
[21:56] what we believe but
[21:57] well we don't want to receive the
[21:58] teacher because it's pride in ourselves
[22:00] lifting us
[22:01] up so we don't want to receive that so
[22:04] we're going to speak about that pride
[22:07] so they want to receive well they want
[22:08] to reject teachers of angels pastors
[22:11] whatever it is
[22:12] reject the pastor just we just we have
[22:15] the prophet we don't need all these
[22:16] other gifts
[22:17] and you know he fulfilled all those
[22:18] gifts or whatever their excuses
[22:20] so now they're free to wander around and
[22:22] just do as they feel free uh
[22:25] feel led to do of their own choosing
[22:27] that's not the way sheep act
[22:30] sheep have a shepherd
[22:33] you know people can get offended by that
[22:36] you can say to a crowd of people say
[22:37] well
[22:38] sheep need a shepherd so if you don't
[22:41] have a shepherd you must be a goat
[22:43] and some people go out all angry because
[22:47] they've been called a goat
[22:49] but it's because they've taken that
[22:50] description on themselves
[22:52] some people go out and bless thank the
[22:54] lord i'm a sheep and others walk out
[22:56] saying well
[22:57] he called me a goat so it becomes
[23:00] evident
[23:00] what we are that's pride again
[23:04] pride because if if the sheep is there
[23:07] and you call him a goat
[23:09] he'll examine himself brother brahma
[23:11] said the holy spirit always receives
[23:12] correction
[23:13] if you see someone or you are that
[23:15] someone doesn't receive correction
[23:18] and wants to rebel or resist
[23:21] check at nature because the holy spirit
[23:24] always received correction
[23:26] even when it's maybe not properly placed
[23:29] or not properly applied
[23:32] can you be humble enough to receive that
[23:35] can you receive the wrong accusation
[23:38] or do you rare up resist lord help us
[23:42] because it's a human condition through
[23:44] the fall
[23:46] that pride has come down from heaven
[23:49] it's come down
[23:50] to every one of us to one degree or
[23:52] another
[23:53] i've been amply blessed with that if you
[23:55] want to call it a blessing
[23:57] so i know what i'm speaking about so
[24:00] don't don't don't say i don't know what
[24:02] i'm talking about i
[24:04] do and i'm not proud of it so
[24:12] people don't want to be subject to the
[24:13] spirit of god
[24:15] whether it's whatever the fivefold
[24:18] gift is or maybe not a not even a
[24:22] fivefold minister maybe it's your wife
[24:24] you
[24:25] don't want to hear from that maybe it's
[24:26] your child or your husband you don't
[24:28] want to hear from that
[24:30] that resistance that what what is that
[24:32] raising up
[24:33] what is that resistance that raises up
[24:35] in you uh it's not the spirit of christ
[24:38] can we be humble enough just receive
[24:41] correction even from a child
[24:44] amen
[24:54] you know the apostle the apostle sets
[24:56] things in order
[24:57] we don't want things set in order we
[25:00] don't want to be taught
[25:00] we don't want to learn
[25:07] let's continue with that quote that i
[25:09] was just reading my brother
[25:10] chad had read teaching places a man
[25:12] positionally what he is and we can never
[25:14] rightly be able to have
[25:15] faith until positionally we know what we
[25:18] are
[25:19] i don't i don't know if you read this
[25:21] part by the chad but the following
[25:22] paragraph now if the united states of
[25:24] this fair land here sent me over to
[25:26] russia
[25:26] as an ambassador of this nation to
[25:28] russia then if they have officially sent
[25:30] me to russia
[25:31] all the power that the united states has
[25:33] is behind me
[25:34] my word is just the same as the united
[25:35] states if i have been recognized as an
[25:37] ambassador
[25:38] and then if god has sent us to be his
[25:40] ambassadors all the power that's in
[25:42] heaven
[25:43] all that god is all of his angels all of
[25:45] his power stands behind our words
[25:47] if we are correctly an ordained sent
[25:49] messenger to the people
[25:50] god has to honor the word for he has so
[25:53] solemnly written that whatever you bind
[25:55] on earth
[25:56] that will i bind in heaven whatever you
[25:58] loose on earth that will i loose in
[25:59] heaven
[25:59] and i give unto thee the keys of the
[26:01] kingdom oh
[26:02] such great promises he's given the
[26:04] church but how can we
[26:06] how can we avail those promises to us if
[26:10] we're not placed
[26:11] we've got to have the teacher place us
[26:13] in there correctly that's god's gift to
[26:15] us
[26:16] and how are we going to recognize our
[26:18] position how are we going to get there
[26:20] without that teaching gift so i guess
[26:23] that's for me and any others that are a
[26:25] little intimidated by skating on thin
[26:26] ice
[26:28] you just sit back and watch the teacher
[26:29] skate on the thin ice and enjoy it
[26:32] and benefit by it so i admit that i'm no
[26:35] teacher
[26:36] and uh so the focus of the service
[26:39] tonight
[26:40] is not to bring out details and and tie
[26:43] a lot of things together but just to uh
[26:47] bring a lesson uh that's taught by those
[26:51] facts and details maybe we won't go into
[26:53] all that but you know we could learn
[26:55] all about the seven church ages and we
[26:58] could know all the dates
[26:59] the names and all the details of
[27:02] everything about the church ages or the
[27:04] seals or
[27:05] or whatever great doctrine we we know of
[27:08] but if we don't understand the lesson
[27:10] that's being taught
[27:12] we really miss the purpose of all the
[27:13] facts and the details
[27:15] so we're not going to focus on the
[27:17] details let's let's get the lesson
[27:19] that's that's in this uh uh
[27:22] scripture reading for us tonight now
[27:24] hold your place there in ezekiel if you
[27:26] want to turn to first corinthians
[27:27] chapter eight
[27:28] verse one to uh one to two uh for me or
[27:32] we'll just read it here i didn't have
[27:34] time to put it up on a powerpoint
[27:37] we just give you a little
[27:41] exercise in your fingers first
[27:43] corinthians eight
[27:45] verse one and two now as touching things
[27:47] offered unto idols we know that all
[27:49] that we all have knowledge knowledge
[27:51] puffeth up but charity edifieth
[27:54] and if any man think that he knows
[27:55] anything he knows nothing
[27:57] yet as he ought to know that knowledge
[28:00] puffeth up
[28:02] you know speaking on the teaching
[28:04] ministry uh
[28:06] puffeth up means to be lifted up exalted
[28:08] become proud
[28:09] that's an effect of knowledge now that's
[28:12] the scriptures it says
[28:13] knowledge puffeth up you say well then
[28:16] i'm going to have to be stupid all my
[28:17] life
[28:17] no there's a difference between
[28:19] information
[28:20] and revelation if you can take the
[28:23] information
[28:24] and it can become a revelation to you
[28:27] that doesn't exalt
[28:27] it doesn't puff up but if it's just
[28:30] information
[28:31] and just knowledge head head knowledge
[28:34] it's going to puff you up have you ever
[28:36] seen a message believer
[28:38] smart as a whip about the message about
[28:41] the doctrines and they were puffed up
[28:43] have you ever been there don't raise
[28:44] your hand you know
[28:49] it's so easy for us to to
[28:52] learn the things the revelation of this
[28:56] word
[28:56] and become puffed up by it i remember my
[29:00] brother
[29:00] burley williams uh speaking one time i
[29:03] think it was brother burley
[29:05] forgive me if it was the wrong man but
[29:07] he was giving his testimony one time
[29:09] i thought he was pretty sharp christian
[29:11] and
[29:12] seen a guy reading the bible knee kind
[29:15] of come up to him and
[29:16] must have that proud spirit and said
[29:20] you know what you're reading there he
[29:21] knows i seem to
[29:23] think well maybe i can educate you
[29:25] because you know i i know something
[29:27] well the scripture we just read says if
[29:29] you think you know something you don't
[29:30] know it like you should
[29:32] so when he comes up you know what you're
[29:35] reading there
[29:36] and the man looked at him says well how
[29:38] did elijah go up
[29:40] he said well he went up in a chariot of
[29:42] fire he said no he didn't
[29:44] he went up in a whirlwind just deflated
[29:47] him you know i think i was correct you
[29:48] have to go home
[29:49] check it out and see if i know what i'm
[29:50] talking about but anyway we think we
[29:53] know what we're talking about
[29:55] and we get puffed up and if you think
[29:58] you know something
[29:59] you don't know it like you should
[30:01] because if if this message
[30:03] if this revelation the message of the
[30:05] hour begins to lift you up you don't
[30:07] know what
[30:08] you're not believing the message you
[30:10] might believe the seven seals and the
[30:12] and everything you're taught here
[30:15] intellectually
[30:16] but you don't know it like you know it
[30:17] if it's lifting you up because it does
[30:18] not exalt you
[30:20] if you've got the spirit of god it's not
[30:22] exalted it's humble
[30:24] amen knowledge puffed up
[30:32] we don't want to just become data data
[30:35] information
[30:36] there's got to be a revelation that's
[30:37] why we're supposed to re
[30:40] we're supposed to pray for revelation
[30:42] not information
[30:46] if if this is lifting you up you don't
[30:48] know it like you ought to know it let's
[30:49] go back to ezekiel here
[30:52] let's look at this description of
[30:53] lucifer and you know we could say he had
[30:56] his act together he had his ducks in a
[30:57] row
[30:58] he had the knowledge which puffed him up
[31:01] he didn't have the charity which edify
[31:03] us because that's
[31:04] that was just i didn't uh focus on that
[31:07] verse one of first corinthians eight
[31:09] there says
[31:09] uh knowledge puffeth up but charity
[31:12] edifieth
[31:14] satan had lucifer had the knowledge
[31:18] full of wisdom so he had the knowledge
[31:21] he was puffed up by it
[31:23] he did not have the charity that
[31:26] so he was no edification to anyone
[31:29] the same is going to be true for you if
[31:31] you've just got the knowledge you've got
[31:32] the information
[31:33] you're not gonna be a benefit to anybody
[31:35] you just become puffed up by it
[31:38] now where was i get lost here
[31:46] ezekiel chapter 28
[31:50] the characteristics of lucifer full of
[31:52] wisdom perfect in beauty
[31:54] verse 12 that was verse 14 thou art the
[31:56] anointed cherub that covereth
[31:58] he had a position verse 15
[32:02] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[32:04] that was created
[32:06] from the very beginning verse 17
[32:09] speaks of his wisdom his brightness
[32:13] how did lucifer get like that he's
[32:15] perfect he had a special position he had
[32:17] these characters these qualities
[32:19] characteristics and qualities verse 14
[32:22] says thou art anointed cherub that covet
[32:24] i have set thee so god put him there god
[32:28] anointed him
[32:29] think of judas iscariot there was
[32:31] walking with jesus and jesus made him
[32:33] the treasure
[32:35] being in the position like that is not
[32:38] the end all
[32:39] right we've got a position but that's
[32:41] not the end all
[32:42] if we get uh lifted up in that it will
[32:45] be the end all
[32:46] end of all god ordained it god placed
[32:49] him god created him
[32:50] god created him perfect god created him
[32:52] beautiful full of wisdom he did all
[32:54] these things
[32:55] that was god's choosing god's business
[32:58] god's decision
[33:00] what right did looser have to get lifted
[33:01] up it was all god's doing
[33:05] lucifer had no place but yet he he
[33:07] didn't have the character he didn't have
[33:08] that
[33:10] seed of god down in him that
[33:13] characteristic
[33:14] and it was just knowledge to him and it
[33:15] became lifted up
[33:18] and lucifer made a decision it says in
[33:20] verse 17 it says thou
[33:22] has corrupted thy wisdom it was his
[33:24] wisdom but he
[33:25] corrupted it it was his decision
[33:30] we've been blessed be called to this end
[33:31] time message this revelation
[33:33] of this day but we have a responsibility
[33:36] that goes with that
[33:38] we have to make choices we must make
[33:41] choices
[33:42] we can't just make one choice say yeah
[33:44] i'll serve you lord and then coast
[33:45] and free will the rest of the life's
[33:47] journey every day is a decision
[33:50] you've placed that before you just like
[33:51] adam and eve it's placed before you
[33:53] the choice every day
[33:56] we're free mortal agents we have to
[33:59] choose
[34:02] lucifer also had free will and he chose
[34:05] the path
[34:06] god did not force him down that path he
[34:08] chose the path
[34:09] that he went down we were also free will
[34:12] agents we've got to choose our path
[34:16] now this choice that lucifer made was
[34:19] not just a bad
[34:20] bad choice or a mistake uh an oversight
[34:24] of his
[34:24] it was a conscious decision on his part
[34:27] isaiah 14
[34:28] 12-14 says how out there fallen from
[34:30] heaven oh lucifer
[34:31] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[34:33] to the ground which did weak in the
[34:35] nations
[34:36] for thou hast said in thine heart i will
[34:39] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[34:41] throne above the stars of god
[34:42] i will sit upon the mount of the
[34:44] congregation and the size of the north
[34:45] i will ascend up on the above the
[34:48] heights of clouds i
[34:49] will like the most high it was his
[34:51] decision
[34:52] his choice not just an oversight
[34:56] we all make mistakes uh i'm going to put
[34:58] you in the same crowd that i am
[35:00] because i think you're all the same way
[35:02] we're just we just make mistakes we do
[35:04] we make wrong choices we make things uh
[35:07] decisions we have to apologize we got to
[35:09] go back and correct and and
[35:10] things that have got to be corrected and
[35:13] fixed
[35:14] every day this wasn't that kind of
[35:16] decision
[35:17] this was a conscious decision that i
[35:20] will
[35:21] it was his will placing his will above
[35:24] god's will
[35:28] now you know we're not here just to
[35:30] glorify satan
[35:31] or to just discuss his uh
[35:35] his downfall and go home but we want to
[35:39] we want to learn from this we want to
[35:40] see ourselves in this we want to see
[35:42] what can we learn from this
[35:44] who gave loose for these qualities god
[35:46] did who gave him his position god did
[35:49] so how's that apply to you and i
[35:52] well who gave you your position your
[35:54] position
[35:56] well i chose to come here to this church
[35:58] did you really
[35:59] uh i didn't choose this message my my
[36:02] parents chose this message when i was
[36:03] three or four
[36:04] it's well i had to come to a choice
[36:05] myself but i could have been anywhere
[36:09] you may have been raised in this message
[36:10] yourself there's been a whole bunch of
[36:13] people raised in this message
[36:15] and they didn't see it and they walked
[36:18] away
[36:19] so how come you're here not by your
[36:21] doing if you think that you're doing
[36:23] you're just you just haven't got the
[36:25] revelation yet you're going to be puffed
[36:27] up by that
[36:28] if you think that you made a decision
[36:30] and you can be proud and say
[36:33] man i chose the right path
[36:36] you're on the wrong path even though
[36:38] you're on the right path you're
[36:40] you're in the you're on the wrong track
[36:42] uh get the teacher just
[36:43] to straighten that out so you know what
[36:46] i mean though
[36:48] you ain't gonna arrive who's give you
[36:51] wisdom
[36:52] god gave lucifer wisdom who's given you
[36:54] wisdom you say well i don't have any
[36:56] wisdom
[36:57] the things we know in this message
[37:01] maybe we don't know how to relate it
[37:02] like a teacher would
[37:04] but if if you was to come across
[37:08] a seed of god that was a theologian
[37:12] and of the highest order and you would
[37:15] just
[37:16] tell him what little bit you think it is
[37:17] that you know
[37:19] it can spark that seed to life because
[37:21] it's something they've never heard
[37:23] before
[37:23] they've never seen before they've never
[37:25] realized before we're blessed
[37:28] uh so many people out there walking in
[37:30] in darkness and in blindness
[37:32] and you and i are not that way but it's
[37:35] not our fault it's god's choosing
[37:37] god's decision he didn't have to put a
[37:40] teaching ministry in our midst
[37:42] he didn't have to do these things we
[37:44] could be out there struggling along just
[37:47] believing god sent a prophet and uh
[37:50] and that be all we've got and never be
[37:52] positionally placed
[37:53] we're blessed beyond beyond our uh
[37:56] realization
[38:00] so many people around us don't have
[38:01] these blessings in their lives
[38:02] denominational people or even message
[38:04] people
[38:05] people attend attendees of a message
[38:07] church let's put it that way
[38:09] people that are better than ourselves
[38:11] better people more likeable than you and
[38:13] i
[38:14] kind loving sweet all the good
[38:16] characteristics but but
[38:18] just lacking that revelation
[38:21] this is god's choice not your choice you
[38:24] don't say i'm going to go and learn
[38:26] the teacher doesn't say well i'm going
[38:28] to go and study and learn all about the
[38:30] seven
[38:30] seals and i'm no if god doesn't show him
[38:33] if god doesn't if he doesn't yield to
[38:35] that gift in his life
[38:37] it's just going to come out as head
[38:38] knowledge which will puff up
[38:40] so we're blessed
[38:43] lucifer was the anointed cherub he had a
[38:46] position
[38:46] a position in heaven a great position
[38:50] you do too right of jesus christ would
[38:53] you say that's a good position
[38:55] i say it's pretty important
[38:58] but you didn't put yourself there god
[39:01] chose that
[39:02] before the before you was here to make
[39:04] the choice he chose it
[39:06] so really why why or how could we get
[39:09] puffed up
[39:10] uh well if it's just head knowledge you
[39:13] know the pastor
[39:14] the teacher the evangelist they all come
[39:15] here and they hammer it into us you're
[39:17] the spotless bride of jesus christ
[39:19] if it doesn't become a revelation it's
[39:21] only knowledge you will be proud of the
[39:23] fact
[39:23] that i am the bride of jesus christ and
[39:25] you'll go out
[39:26] flaunting it and just a lot of
[39:29] misrepresentation
[39:31] as the bride of jesus christ because the
[39:33] bride of jesus christ as we've been
[39:34] hearing
[39:35] is going to be the feminine
[39:38] manifestation of christ
[39:39] christ did not manifest pride if you're
[39:42] manifesting pride then
[39:43] that's a complete conflict with what you
[39:47] claim to be
[39:48] a good idea to re-examine and uh
[39:52] and check yourself out lucifer had a
[39:55] choice
[39:55] you've got a choice as well we are free
[39:57] moral agents we can be lifted up with
[39:59] wisdom
[40:00] because of our position in christ uh i'm
[40:03] sure you've
[40:04] known like i say ben maybe or or have
[40:07] seen people
[40:08] in the message lift it up and pried
[40:10] proud of it
[40:11] just oh they just maybe they want to
[40:13] debate and argue and just
[40:14] put their point and their doctrine to
[40:16] you and just uh
[40:18] you know to me i i can't
[40:21] compete why compete i i can't i can't
[40:24] outsmart nobody
[40:26] so but just you know let them argue and
[40:29] fuss
[40:30] that's that's not my my uh place
[40:35] now i've got written in my notes here
[40:37] that i'm approaching thin ice i don't
[40:38] even know i'm on thin ice
[40:39] so let me back up a little bit here
[40:44] the thin ice is say lucifer got lifted
[40:47] in pride and you can too
[40:49] unless you're bride of jesus christ you
[40:50] can't fall okay let's
[40:53] let's let the teachers clarify that
[40:55] that's a little thin ice we can go into
[40:57] all kinds of
[40:57] areas on that the bride of jesus christ
[41:00] cannot fall
[41:01] but she can be misled she can get
[41:04] anointed by other spirits
[41:06] uh and we're not gonna go into that but
[41:08] let's just clarify that a little bit
[41:10] matthew 16 verse 22 and 23 says then
[41:13] peter took him and began to rebuke him
[41:15] jesus saying be it far from thee lord
[41:17] that this shall not be unto thee
[41:18] but he turned and said unto peter get
[41:21] there behind me satan
[41:23] now that was peter he was talking to
[41:24] just like the king of tires he was
[41:26] talking to the spirit
[41:27] that was anointing peter yet they behind
[41:29] me satan thou art an offense to me for
[41:31] thou savers not the things that be of
[41:33] god
[41:33] but those that be of men now he was know
[41:35] that peter wasn't converted at that time
[41:38] uh let's continue on luke 9 verse 51-56
[41:42] and it came to pass when the time was
[41:43] come that they should be received up
[41:44] that that he should be received up he
[41:47] steadfastly set his face to go to
[41:48] jerusalem
[41:49] and sent messengers before his face and
[41:51] they went entered into a village of the
[41:52] samaritans to make ready for him
[41:54] they did not receive him because his
[41:56] face was as though he would go to
[41:57] jerusalem
[41:58] and when his disciples james and john
[42:00] saw this they said lord wilt thou that
[42:02] we command fire to come down from heaven
[42:04] and consume them even as elias did
[42:06] but he turned and rebuked them and said
[42:08] you you know not what manner of spirit
[42:10] you are of
[42:13] that is not the spirit of christ now of
[42:15] course this was before their conversion
[42:17] but we're going to continue reading for
[42:19] the son of man has not come to destroy
[42:21] men's lives but to save them
[42:23] and they went to another village when we
[42:25] get to a position
[42:26] or an attitude where we want to destroy
[42:29] lives
[42:32] you know i i hate to make the confession
[42:35] publicly
[42:36] but we all get that way i suppose
[42:40] i guess i have i'll not throw you in the
[42:42] same boat
[42:43] but we want to reach out and rebuke
[42:46] without
[42:47] without charity charity edify it
[42:50] if you don't have charity how's it going
[42:51] to edify and i may have said it before
[42:54] one time there was a young young boy
[42:55] that had come to our church
[42:57] with his father that's from a broken
[42:59] home so he came to church time to time
[43:01] and i knew him growing up kind of had a
[43:02] burden for the for the young man just
[43:04] wayward out in the world and just really
[43:06] you know just he had no christian
[43:08] testimony and just
[43:10] you know he he probably didn't even
[43:12] claim to be a christian but
[43:13] but he had been raised around the
[43:15] message and he knew the right way to go
[43:17] and one day i was driving through a
[43:19] little town where he lived and i seen
[43:21] him
[43:22] and it just looked like he was on drugs
[43:24] he's just all bloodshot eyes and
[43:26] and just bleary looking and so i stopped
[43:30] there by him and i said isn't there a
[43:32] better you know
[43:33] i forget how i said it you know but
[43:35] isn't there a better way of living or
[43:38] something better that you could do with
[43:40] your life you know and he just looked at
[43:42] me and said i've been swimming
[43:45] well even if he was on drugs what kind
[43:48] of spirit
[43:50] is that that wants to lash out rebuke
[43:53] and
[43:54] and uh i don't know maybe it's maybe
[43:56] it's my own nature
[43:57] i have to stop here and have an altar
[43:59] call because
[44:00] it's so easy to get lifted up
[44:04] and think you know it's so plain you
[44:06] know why are you living like that
[44:08] we've got a beautiful message and why
[44:09] are you walking away from it and just
[44:11] uh is there as a is there a charity
[44:14] that can edify that person
[44:17] or is it just knowledge knowledge
[44:20] speaking out
[44:21] that doesn't edify anything just puffing
[44:24] you up
[44:24] lord help us galatians
[44:28] chapter 2 verse 11 and 12 but when peter
[44:30] now this is after his conversion but
[44:31] when peter was come
[44:32] to antioch this is paul speaking i was
[44:35] stood him to the face because he was to
[44:36] be blamed
[44:38] for before that certain came from james
[44:40] he did eat with the gentiles but when
[44:41] they were come
[44:42] he withdrew and separated himself
[44:44] freeing them which were of the
[44:45] circumcision
[44:46] so even after his conversion peter still
[44:50] could be swayed all of us the same boat
[44:54] all of us brother brandon i i don't have
[44:58] the quote here
[44:59] but i think most of you are familiar
[45:00] with it and if those young ones maybe
[45:02] are not familiar with it brother branham
[45:04] early in his ministry he
[45:06] stepped into a diner to get a bite to
[45:07] eat
[45:10] and it was against the law to gamble and
[45:13] there stood a cop
[45:14] a policeman playing a slot machine a
[45:16] gambling machine
[45:18] had his arm around i think if i get the
[45:21] details right hank he had his arm around
[45:23] some young girl
[45:24] so here's the law of the land breaking
[45:26] the law
[45:27] his arm around some young girl and an
[45:29] old woman over there i think she was
[45:31] drunk sitting with a couple of old drunk
[45:32] guys and
[45:34] brother brandon just grieved his spirit
[45:36] and he just died
[45:37] god why don't you just how can you stand
[45:39] it lord just just wipe them off the face
[45:41] of the earth you know just
[45:42] just come down and judge this place and
[45:44] however he said it but
[45:46] but god rebuked him and said come over
[45:48] here
[45:49] took him behind the door of the of the
[45:51] diner there and
[45:53] i forget how it was that he he said i
[45:55] think he showed him a vision that's what
[45:56] it was he showed him
[45:58] the earth with the blood of jesus christ
[46:02] encapsulating it circling it
[46:05] and every time brother bran would make a
[46:06] mistake that sin would go up
[46:08] but the blood of jesus christ would
[46:10] catch it
[46:11] and and spare him from judgment he says
[46:14] now i've done that for you but you want
[46:16] to condemn them
[46:18] and made a difference in his life he
[46:20] went back with charity
[46:23] and it edified because he went and
[46:24] talked to that old lady he says
[46:26] can i talk to you you know what's led
[46:29] you down this road you know
[46:30] and and they had a prayer meeting right
[46:32] there got down on their knees and led
[46:34] her back to christ
[46:36] now that's a different situation than
[46:39] wiping them off the face of the earth
[46:41] too often
[46:43] we can get under that influence we've
[46:45] got to recognize what that influence is
[46:47] we
[46:48] we can want to rear up especially if
[46:50] somebody
[46:51] says something sharp to us or or rebukes
[46:53] us or
[46:54] something we don't like and just lord
[46:56] how can you stand this sin your
[46:58] oh lord come quickly that's a selfish
[46:59] prayer
[47:01] uh this isn't in my notes but it's on my
[47:03] heart
[47:05] that's a selfish prayer oh lord come
[47:06] quickly well that's what the scripture
[47:08] says you know you know if if i don't
[47:11] cut the time short then no flesh will be
[47:13] saved or i forget how it reads but
[47:16] but go back and read that we'll let the
[47:18] teacher clarify that
[47:19] what was they speaking of there were
[47:20] they talking about the rapture the
[47:22] catching with the bride
[47:23] let's take a look at abraham the father
[47:25] of our faith
[47:26] instead of saying yes lord that sodom
[47:28] and gomorrah is a filthy place you mean
[47:29] you ought to go down and wipe it off he
[47:30] said can you spare them
[47:32] if there's 50 write on down to 10 can
[47:34] you spare them
[47:36] and god would have spared however many
[47:38] thousands of people in that city
[47:40] wicked city for ten souls
[47:44] he couldn't find ten they drug four of
[47:47] them
[47:49] out of the city and one of them turned
[47:51] back so only three were saved
[47:53] but that's how much he cares um
[47:59] yeah i'm right here but god rebuked
[48:02] brother branham
[48:03] for that attitude uh
[48:07] i guess you could call it arrogance
[48:09] pride lord strike them down
[48:11] i've spared you but you you don't want
[48:13] to spare them
[48:17] charity surfaced charity edified
[48:22] god help us to have that same tenderness
[48:24] to be subject to the holy spirit that he
[48:26] can speak to us
[48:28] the holy spirit's tender meek gentle
[48:32] we should cherish it that spirit
[48:36] is so opposite to everything
[48:39] in our culture especially america you
[48:42] don't see any
[48:44] any charity out there i mean you can
[48:48] you can get little glimpses of it kind
[48:50] of like you know
[48:51] uh and maybe kind of whitewash it and
[48:53] make it look like charity
[48:55] and i know you know maybe i would offend
[48:57] somebody by saying that and they said no
[48:59] there's good people out there there's
[49:00] salvation army okay okay
[49:02] i know let's just say let's just say the
[49:04] majority if that suffices you
[49:07] it's not out there you've got to go
[49:09] looking for it if you're going to find
[49:10] it
[49:10] it's a foreign experience to our to our
[49:12] culture
[49:14] we should shine it brighter and brighter
[49:17] uh all the time people are hungry for it
[49:20] and they're not getting it anywhere else
[49:22] we all know the story of joan and the
[49:24] whale and uh you know
[49:26] from sunday school we've got that lesson
[49:28] but perhaps the greatest lesson is
[49:30] like the last two verses jonah chapter 4
[49:32] verse 10 11 then said the lord thy hast
[49:34] had pity on the gourd because you know
[49:36] god raised up the gourd to shade
[49:38] jonah and give him a little respite from
[49:40] the
[49:42] from the heat and but then the gourd
[49:44] withered and we know the story there
[49:45] he says you have had pity on the gourd
[49:48] and you didn't even do anything
[49:49] uh to bring that upon you know to bring
[49:52] that about
[49:53] so you had video on the gourd for which
[49:54] that's not labored neither made us to
[49:56] grow
[49:57] which came up in a night and perished in
[49:59] a night and should not i spare nineveh
[50:01] that great city wherein are more than
[50:03] six core six score
[50:05] thousand persons that cannot discern
[50:07] between their right hand
[50:08] and their left hand and also much cattle
[50:11] that's a
[50:12] story of grace right there because in
[50:15] jonah chapter 1 verse 2 he says arise go
[50:17] to nineveh that great city and cry
[50:19] against it
[50:20] for their wickedness has come up before
[50:22] me this was a wicked city
[50:24] no denying it god admitted it go out and
[50:27] cry i'm going to judge him
[50:30] why didn't he just go go judge him why
[50:32] didn't he just go wipe them off the map
[50:35] but yet there was six score thousand
[50:38] that didn't know the difference between
[50:39] left and right he had mercy and grace on
[50:41] them
[50:42] he offered them a chance even though
[50:43] they weren't elected they weren't
[50:45] uh they weren't his people but they were
[50:48] living souls
[50:49] um let's let's say they were six score
[50:52] thousand serpent seed but
[50:54] yet it was life and he had mercy up on
[50:56] it
[51:00] like saying i'll preach myself under
[51:02] conviction here and you have the
[51:03] preacher down
[51:04] down on the altar here and i don't know
[51:06] what we're gonna do with about after
[51:07] that
[51:09] his tenderness amazes me
[51:12] if we're of his spirit then his
[51:15] character
[51:15] characteristics are going to show out
[51:18] you don't know what spirit you're of
[51:20] what's what characteristics are you
[51:22] displaying
[51:24] is it his characteristics john and james
[51:27] they didn't know what spirit they were
[51:29] of
[51:30] they were showing the wrong spirit let's
[51:34] let's look at our text again let's see
[51:36] if we can read about ourselves in there
[51:37] ezekiel chapter 28
[51:40] full of wisdom perfect in beauty now
[51:43] didn't jesus tell his disciples
[51:44] that i was given to them to know all the
[51:46] mysteries you know you'd say well i'm
[51:48] not i'm not a wise man i'm just i'm just
[51:50] a dumb farmer i'm just just a worker out
[51:52] here i
[51:53] don't have any gifts i don't have any
[51:55] knowledge i'm just not that smart
[51:57] but god told his jesus told his
[51:59] disciples it's been given to you know
[52:01] the mysteries
[52:02] it's been given to you you are blessed
[52:06] to know the mysteries what magnificent
[52:08] revelation we've been given
[52:10] around this this message
[52:13] and and we'd i'll speak for myself and
[52:16] just take it for granted
[52:18] uh i can't imagine being out there in a
[52:21] trinitarian
[52:22] uh environment or uh believing in a
[52:25] trinity i can't belie
[52:27] you know what they what do they believe
[52:28] about the sin in the garden and just
[52:30] walking in darkness don't let it puff
[52:33] you up though
[52:35] be thankful to the lord that he's shown
[52:37] us
[52:38] perfect in beauty he said well i'm not a
[52:40] beautiful person i've got all these
[52:41] problems i've got all these faults and
[52:44] all these failures and uh
[52:46] are you justified justified means as if
[52:49] you've never done it
[52:51] that's perfect right you know if you've
[52:53] never done it if you've never done
[52:54] anything if you've never committed any
[52:56] crimes you've never
[52:57] committed any sin you're perfect is that
[52:59] the way
[53:00] you read it that's the way i read it so
[53:02] are you justified well then you're
[53:03] perfect
[53:06] people say well i'm not beautiful
[53:07] brother ron
[53:10] well you're not marred by sin he said
[53:13] well
[53:14] you haven't seen my past no you're not
[53:16] looking at it right
[53:19] when we become positionally placed we're
[53:21] going to realize all those sins that
[53:23] we've been tagging around on our back
[53:26] that don't belong to you you say but i i
[53:28] committed that
[53:29] i did that uh we'll let the teacher
[53:33] bring in the position on that
[53:36] um how we doing on time here
[53:41] you're all doing good i got a two-hour
[53:43] drive i'm doing good too
[53:45] this is more than life to me
[53:49] i'll just share a little thought when i
[53:51] came to this part
[53:52] i didn't write it down trying to
[53:53] conserve time i just ain't got no more
[53:56] sense than to go ahead and share this
[53:58] you know as a farmer and a simple person
[54:02] i like alice chalmers tractors they're
[54:04] orange
[54:05] and you may be a john deere fan they're
[54:07] green just imagine a john deere
[54:10] farmer going out and buying an alice
[54:11] chalmers tractor but being so ashamed of
[54:13] that orange
[54:14] tractor on his farm that he he just goes
[54:15] out and paints it green
[54:18] so so one day the alice farmer
[54:22] looking for that special collection
[54:24] tractor for his collection he uh
[54:26] he sees that green alice chalmers and he
[54:28] says that's that's not a john deere
[54:30] that's an alice chalmers so he buys it
[54:33] brings the alice chalmers and
[54:34] now you have to stretch your imagination
[54:36] on this one it brings that tractor back
[54:38] down
[54:39] on the farm with all the orange tractors
[54:40] and that tractor is so ashamed of itself
[54:42] so
[54:43] i'm just a lowly john deere now don't
[54:45] get offended if you're a john deere fan
[54:46] we're not going to have a riot here
[54:50] says i'm just a lowly john deere i can't
[54:52] fit in with all these perfect
[54:54] uh orange tractors around here and and
[54:56] the owner could say but you're not
[54:58] a john deere you're a green alice
[55:00] chalmers no i've been an alice i've been
[55:02] a john deere all my life i've
[55:04] i lived with the john deere's i had the
[55:06] same fuels of john deere's and i was
[55:08] maintained by the john deere mechanic
[55:09] and i
[55:10] i've been a john d i was on i come off
[55:11] the john deere farm i'm a john deere
[55:14] no you're not that man can take that
[55:17] tractor in and strip it all down and
[55:19] paint it back orange
[55:20] with that tractor for lack of a better
[55:24] example never accepts the fact that
[55:27] from the factory it was at alex chalmers
[55:30] it was painted the wrong color and it
[55:33] lived on the wrong
[55:34] farm but it was created and now it's
[55:36] chalmers
[55:37] he said but i i pulled it alice chalmers
[55:39] plow and i did alice chalmers
[55:40] i pulled a john deere plow and i did
[55:42] john deere things and i
[55:44] you've been a you've been in alice just
[55:47] in disguise
[55:50] maybe that'll positionally place
[55:51] somebody i don't know you never heard a
[55:53] teacher like that have you
[55:56] but we get to look in the paint looking
[55:58] at the paint on the outside
[55:59] and say i i've walked through this world
[56:02] and made a mess of things
[56:04] and from the factory
[56:07] that's not what you were when we can
[56:10] become positionally placed
[56:12] and we can recognize that it's not going
[56:14] to exalt you if it exalts you you're the
[56:17] wrong spirit
[56:18] but if you're of the right spirit now
[56:20] i'm getting way ahead of myself i'm
[56:22] getting on thin ice again
[56:24] but that's okay god will save me
[56:28] if we can see who we are we can walk
[56:30] fearless
[56:32] you know that let's say that alice
[56:34] chalmers it shouldn't lift them up in
[56:36] friday you just
[56:36] give them joys like this is where i
[56:39] should have been all the time
[56:40] i i should have been walking in heavenly
[56:42] places i was over there on that farm but
[56:45] i really belonged here and this is you
[56:46] know and i had nothing to do with it the
[56:49] the people the factory put me together
[56:51] like this this is this is what i was
[56:52] ordained to be
[56:54] so what you ordained to be the bride of
[56:56] jesus christ the queen of heaven
[56:59] what better position that's better in my
[57:02] book than the covering cherub
[57:05] but we can't get lifted up because if we
[57:07] do it's the wrong spirit
[57:10] oh so perfect in beauty
[57:13] you know i i think orange is beautiful
[57:17] that house chalmers i don't care what
[57:18] color it is it's still an iced chalmers
[57:21] of course it's prettier when it's orange
[57:22] then when it's green and god's gonna
[57:24] clean you up
[57:26] and he's going to he's going to make you
[57:27] what he desires you to be
[57:30] perfect in beauty that collector that
[57:33] bought that green alice chalmers
[57:35] it was beautiful in his sight he knew
[57:37] what was hiding under there
[57:39] there's some orange paint under there
[57:40] and i'm going to expose it
[57:43] that's the way he sees us he knows
[57:45] what's hiding under all that corruption
[57:48] and muck of our lives
[57:51] he knows what's there he's going to
[57:53] clean it up
[57:54] and he keeps telling you he brings the
[57:57] teachers in and tell you
[57:58] the evangelist and everybody else and me
[58:00] tell you
[58:02] you're looking at you're looking at
[58:03] things wrong i'm looking at things wrong
[58:05] we see ourselves wrong we we get to look
[58:08] at the outside
[58:09] and we don't realize who we are we're
[58:12] beautiful in his sight
[58:13] and so how can that be take his word for
[58:15] it
[58:16] walk by faith sin you know
[58:20] satan's sin lucifer sinned sin is doubt
[58:24] don't you be doubting take take his word
[58:28] for it
[58:29] you're beautiful in his sight justified
[58:32] as if you've never done it
[58:34] that alzheimer's never was a john deere
[58:37] never
[58:38] it may have been green but it never was
[58:39] a john deere
[58:41] you never were a sinner now i'm on thin
[58:44] ice help me brother chad
[58:47] you never were a sinner you you walked
[58:50] out there and and things got looking
[58:53] pretty bad
[58:54] but in god's sight he knows what you are
[58:57] because you
[58:58] are part of him and god's not a sinner
[59:01] amen
[59:03] praise the lord don't try to undo what
[59:06] god's done
[59:07] if he says you're beautiful take manny's
[59:10] word
[59:11] believe it you know you know somebody
[59:15] so easy for us to say well okay lord if
[59:17] that's what you're saying
[59:18] but you really don't believe it you
[59:20] haven't got the revelation yet
[59:22] if you had the revelation if i had the
[59:23] revelation
[59:25] how would we walk how would we walk
[59:28] the spotless bride of jesus christ is
[59:30] that what you are is that your
[59:31] description
[59:32] now perfect in beauty spotless bride
[59:35] come on
[59:36] are we talking about the bride of jesus
[59:37] christ do you have a position lucifer
[59:39] had a position you've got a position
[59:42] spotless that's perfect lucifer was made
[59:45] that way from the day he was created
[59:49] our history goes back further than that
[59:51] amen
[59:54] before the foundation of the world a
[59:56] part of him
[59:57] okay when was god created that's when
[59:59] you were created go figure that one out
[1:00:01] that spins my head i'm going to get off
[1:00:03] that thin ice
[1:00:07] so lucifer was a covering cherub but
[1:00:09] you're the bride of jesus christ
[1:00:10] he had a position he fell from it you've
[1:00:12] got a position
[1:00:14] the bride of christ will not fall from
[1:00:16] that position
[1:00:17] so it's we we want to keep that straight
[1:00:21] he said well if i can't follow then i'm
[1:00:22] going to just paint the town red
[1:00:24] that shows you have not arrived yet you
[1:00:27] think you know but you don't know as you
[1:00:28] ought to know
[1:00:30] lucifer's heart was lifted up because of
[1:00:32] the things that
[1:00:34] of these things these characteristics
[1:00:36] the qualities
[1:00:37] his wisdom his beauty he was lifted up
[1:00:40] because of these things
[1:00:41] that's what caused the fall but the
[1:00:43] bride will not fall
[1:00:44] let's keep that straight
[1:00:49] but if we get lifted up what's going to
[1:00:51] be our outcome
[1:00:53] the bright she can she can get
[1:00:57] influenced by the wrong spirit and she
[1:00:59] can become proud
[1:01:00] if you see a proud message believer
[1:01:03] don't say well
[1:01:04] they're lost no how about a little
[1:01:07] charity there on your part to edify that
[1:01:09] person
[1:01:11] to bring them back to their proper
[1:01:13] position
[1:01:15] if we are the uh if we're the elect lady
[1:01:18] we're not gonna fall
[1:01:20] if we're not the elect lady we we will
[1:01:22] fall
[1:01:24] but the elect lady will also not
[1:01:27] be ruled by that spirit of pride now
[1:01:29] we've got that influence in our lives
[1:01:30] through the fall
[1:01:31] every single one of us it's a human
[1:01:33] condition to one degree or another
[1:01:35] we've got that and we've just got to
[1:01:37] keep squelching that
[1:01:38] and and subduing that crucifying
[1:01:42] our that flesh that wants to raise up
[1:01:44] with that
[1:01:46] pride
[1:01:50] so pride brought lucifer down you know
[1:01:53] the loose the
[1:01:53] angels were put on free moral agency uh
[1:01:56] 1960 that dale calvary brother branham
[1:01:58] says uh
[1:02:00] god put the angels and so forth upon the
[1:02:01] same basis that he put human beings on
[1:02:04] knowledge the tree of knowledge the true
[1:02:06] life and the tree of knowledge where man
[1:02:07] could take his choice and when lucifer
[1:02:09] was given the preeminences to make his
[1:02:10] choice
[1:02:12] he wanted something better than god had
[1:02:14] that started the trouble
[1:02:21] we've been given given the same position
[1:02:24] same circumstances as lucifer had
[1:02:27] qualities
[1:02:27] and a position brother braham says in uh
[1:02:31] breach between the seven church ages
[1:02:32] and the seven seals he says you see when
[1:02:35] we
[1:02:35] are redeemed we no more want our own
[1:02:38] choice we want his choice
[1:02:40] we're free moral agents
[1:02:44] but when you're redeemed you surrender
[1:02:46] your will
[1:02:48] now adam and eve wanted their own choice
[1:02:50] they wanted they wanted to find out what
[1:02:51] it was to have wisdom
[1:02:52] so they probed into it and it caused
[1:02:54] death now when a man's been redeemed he
[1:02:56] don't care anymore anymore for
[1:02:57] scholarship
[1:02:58] he don't care for any more of the things
[1:03:00] of the world the wisdom of the world
[1:03:02] he don't want no choice at all christ
[1:03:04] has been his choice and that's all of it
[1:03:06] he's redeemed he just
[1:03:07] no more wants to lead himself he don't
[1:03:09] want nobody to talk him into where to go
[1:03:11] and what to do he just
[1:03:12] waits and finds out the choice of his
[1:03:14] maker seeing and then he goes in the
[1:03:16] name of his maker when the maker tells
[1:03:17] him to go
[1:03:22] there's the difference we're free moral
[1:03:25] agents
[1:03:26] but when we're redeemed we surrender our
[1:03:29] will
[1:03:30] we surrender our choice uh
[1:03:34] maybe a teacher can explain that to us
[1:03:37] jesus had to surrender his own will he
[1:03:39] had a will he had a choice
[1:03:42] but he surrendered that you'll do the
[1:03:45] same if you're the
[1:03:46] if you are if you are the feminine
[1:03:50] manifestation of christ you will also
[1:03:52] surrender your will
[1:03:53] if you're not you won't so when you see
[1:03:56] yourself being lifted up pride
[1:03:58] because of your beauty because of your
[1:04:00] knowledge because of your wisdom because
[1:04:02] of your
[1:04:03] position uh take a good close look
[1:04:06] if you're just okay with being proud
[1:04:09] then that's manifesting who you are
[1:04:12] but if it terrifies you and causes you
[1:04:15] fear
[1:04:17] then there's a way back and you've got
[1:04:20] to humble yourself
[1:04:22] let me see if i can wrap this up
[1:04:25] we've been called to a position but
[1:04:27] that's not our security
[1:04:29] sitting here in this church because your
[1:04:31] parents brought you
[1:04:32] it's not a security being married to the
[1:04:36] pastor being married to a preacher the
[1:04:37] song leader
[1:04:38] the deacon that doesn't that doesn't do
[1:04:41] anything
[1:04:42] being elected as a trustee or a deacon
[1:04:45] by the voice of the church that doesn't
[1:04:48] is not your security
[1:04:52] so having the position is not your
[1:04:53] security
[1:04:55] lucifer lost his because of pride the
[1:04:58] choices
[1:04:59] that he made but like i say we know the
[1:05:02] bride's not gonna
[1:05:03] lose her position but she can come under
[1:05:05] that influence and be lifted up
[1:05:08] arrogance and pride have no fellowship
[1:05:10] with the spirit of christ
[1:05:12] it didn't in heaven pride lifted him up
[1:05:15] that's why he was cast out
[1:05:17] he god is not going to take pride back
[1:05:20] into heaven at the end
[1:05:22] so if you've got even a hint of it in
[1:05:25] you
[1:05:26] it's got to get out it's got to be
[1:05:27] surrendered it's got to be
[1:05:29] crucified you know we all know people
[1:05:32] have walked in the knowledge of the
[1:05:34] message
[1:05:35] and but choices have led them to places
[1:05:38] that
[1:05:38] they would have never never thought
[1:05:40] possible to be
[1:05:42] and we all make mistakes we all make
[1:05:43] blunders we're all
[1:05:45] full of faults in that sense of the word
[1:05:48] because we're still struggling with this
[1:05:50] this human vessel that we've got here so
[1:05:52] we all make mistakes
[1:05:53] and that's that's not the problem the
[1:05:55] problem comes when you make a conscious
[1:05:56] decision
[1:05:58] i'm gonna go this way i'm gonna you know
[1:06:00] god's pulling me
[1:06:01] i i i feel it i feel i feel it but i'm
[1:06:04] gonna go this way
[1:06:05] and when you exert your will over god's
[1:06:07] will
[1:06:08] and he'll let you do it because he's a
[1:06:09] gentleman that's when the trouble comes
[1:06:13] if you're a child of god he'll let you
[1:06:14] go down that path till you get sick of
[1:06:17] your own choices
[1:06:19] don't go too far don't go at all
[1:06:23] but so many times we have to learn the
[1:06:25] hard way
[1:06:26] and god's been merciful to me to spare
[1:06:29] me a lot of trouble
[1:06:31] but i've done my own fair share of
[1:06:33] creating enough trouble for myself
[1:06:36] but when we make a conscious calculated
[1:06:39] decision
[1:06:41] to deviate from the truth we're on
[1:06:43] dangerous ground
[1:06:44] we're showing what spirit's leading us
[1:06:47] it's our own self-will
[1:06:50] i don't know how much more sober of a
[1:06:52] message we could ever receive
[1:06:54] because you're just right on the brink
[1:06:55] of death
[1:06:58] the bride will not exert her own
[1:07:00] self-will
[1:07:01] if you see you've got a tendency to
[1:07:03] exert your own self-will
[1:07:05] you need to come to the altar because
[1:07:07] that's not going in
[1:07:11] you know it's very disheartening to see
[1:07:14] someone claim to be a christian
[1:07:16] and living any kind of a life it's
[1:07:20] embarrassing at work they they call them
[1:07:21] cussing christians
[1:07:23] and you know they're just mocked there's
[1:07:26] no
[1:07:26] relevance put on that individual's lives
[1:07:28] it just
[1:07:30] they're just you know people may like
[1:07:33] them as an individual but they put no
[1:07:35] value to their opinion because they're
[1:07:36] just
[1:07:37] they're wishy-washy you know don't be
[1:07:39] cussing but then they're cussing over
[1:07:40] here don't be cussing don't be smoking
[1:07:42] well i'll i'll take a cigar but just
[1:07:44] when i'm out fishing and or just when a
[1:07:45] baby's
[1:07:46] born and i'll smoke a cigar but you
[1:07:48] ought to get rid of that
[1:07:49] they're not going to listen to that so
[1:07:53] so that's embarrassing to to see that
[1:07:54] kind of a
[1:07:56] christian example that's not christ
[1:07:58] that's not it's not
[1:07:59] uh christian values what about the
[1:08:02] message i mean
[1:08:04] even as an american you know let's take
[1:08:06] it on down to the
[1:08:07] super colonel here you hate to see
[1:08:09] americans
[1:08:10] you think america had had things good
[1:08:13] and
[1:08:13] and we had values and we had uh good
[1:08:16] characteristics and and we see
[1:08:18] americans go around doing this that and
[1:08:19] the other it's kind of embarrassment to
[1:08:21] you
[1:08:21] uh we gotta realize who were what
[1:08:24] kingdom we're of we
[1:08:25] because we can't be a proud of this
[1:08:26] nation and the conduct
[1:08:28] of americans you're not an american i'm
[1:08:31] not an american
[1:08:32] uh we gotta admit it we don't have the
[1:08:35] characteristics of it
[1:08:36] they don't have our characteristics uh
[1:08:38] we've got to realize our
[1:08:40] our nation's from above but then we get
[1:08:43] down to the a message believer that
[1:08:45] that's arrogant and proud and just rude
[1:08:48] and
[1:08:49] profane or you know just not displaying
[1:08:52] the characters of christ it's just a
[1:08:54] it's grieving to our spirits
[1:08:58] but how do we react to that do we uh do
[1:09:00] we have the charity
[1:09:02] that can help that brother or do we do
[1:09:04] we uh
[1:09:05] judge him and say well you know just uh
[1:09:07] infidel there
[1:09:09] a wolf in sheep's clothes but it's an
[1:09:11] embarrassment to us
[1:09:13] because we see that that's not the
[1:09:15] characteristic
[1:09:16] that was displayed by our lord jesus
[1:09:18] christ
[1:09:19] it wasn't the characteristics displayed
[1:09:21] by
[1:09:22] william branham that wave sheep that's
[1:09:25] that's come before so we see how an
[1:09:28] adopted son
[1:09:29] acts are you an adopted son if you're an
[1:09:32] adopted son you're not going to be
[1:09:33] acting in a contrary manner to that
[1:09:35] say well brother brandon made mistakes
[1:09:36] he did and he made him right
[1:09:38] had his wife lie he uh he made mistakes
[1:09:41] yeah and that's that's what that's what
[1:09:43] we do as humans we make mistakes but we
[1:09:46] go back
[1:09:47] and we fix it if you're willing to just
[1:09:49] let it ride
[1:09:50] and go on down the pike
[1:09:54] maybe your experience needs to become a
[1:09:56] little deeper
[1:09:58] and god help me god help the evangelist
[1:10:01] that we
[1:10:02] stand up here and speak we can speak
[1:10:04] with the spirit of charity
[1:10:07] we can speak with a spirit of pride and
[1:10:10] even though we're speaking
[1:10:11] the truth if it's coming across in a
[1:10:14] spirit of pride it just it's uh it's not
[1:10:16] going to benefit
[1:10:17] it's not going to edify i you know i
[1:10:20] love the things we're being taught
[1:10:21] because i think we're being taught the
[1:10:22] truth i
[1:10:23] appreciate that but if it comes across
[1:10:25] in a spirit of pride
[1:10:28] i don't want to be a part of that
[1:10:30] because we can't
[1:10:31] something's going to go wrong somewhere
[1:10:34] lucifer had the beauty he had the wisdom
[1:10:36] but he didn't have the right spirit and
[1:10:39] if you've got
[1:10:40] the wrong spirit up here speaking truth
[1:10:42] it's going to go off
[1:10:44] the serpent spoke some truth to eve
[1:10:49] but there had to be in a different a
[1:10:50] little dif there's a different spirit
[1:10:53] because it was saying but but surely
[1:10:57] you know surely surely there's god
[1:10:59] wouldn't do this
[1:11:00] something that's just kind of saying
[1:11:01] that you know surely you're above that
[1:11:04] you know surely that's not going to
[1:11:05] happen a little bit of i guess pride
[1:11:07] coming up there
[1:11:08] if we would want to say it that way so
[1:11:11] even though
[1:11:12] truth may be coming but if it's coming
[1:11:13] across in a proud way
[1:11:17] that's the serpent speaking uh husbands
[1:11:20] wives if you're speaking to your
[1:11:22] children speaking to one another
[1:11:24] speaking to your workmates whatever your
[1:11:26] schoolmates
[1:11:28] speaking the truth and if it's not
[1:11:30] through charity
[1:11:32] then it's the wrong spirit and it's not
[1:11:34] going to be beneficial
[1:11:36] let's examine ourselves
[1:11:40] you know down through history christians
[1:11:43] killed
[1:11:44] and murdered and tortured and name it in
[1:11:46] the name of christ
[1:11:50] we're beyond those days hopefully don't
[1:11:53] reoccur but we better
[1:11:56] you and i better be beyond those days uh
[1:11:59] but that's an
[1:12:00] oxymoron that's a that's a false
[1:12:02] disciple
[1:12:04] to say i'm a believer in jesus christ
[1:12:07] and then go out and live
[1:12:08] by the sword and go ever just contrary
[1:12:10] to what jesus christ
[1:12:11] uh everything he taught that proud
[1:12:16] they're you know false disciples because
[1:12:18] they're out killing in the name of
[1:12:19] christ
[1:12:21] so what about a proud belligerent
[1:12:24] rebellious arrogant
[1:12:27] message believer how's it any different
[1:12:31] wrong spirit if you fit in that category
[1:12:36] proud belligerent rebellious arrogant
[1:12:39] message believer you need to get saved
[1:12:43] you need a conversion you know it even
[1:12:47] leaves a bad taste in my mouth to even
[1:12:48] say those characteristics
[1:12:51] along with the name of christ or a
[1:12:55] message believer
[1:12:57] leaves a bad taste in the mouth
[1:13:00] let alone to witness it amongst someone
[1:13:03] and worse yet
[1:13:04] would be to witness it in myself
[1:13:07] i hope that it would grieve our spirits
[1:13:10] to see that
[1:13:12] i'm not saying i'm above it saying god
[1:13:15] help me
[1:13:16] i'll exhort you this evening if you find
[1:13:19] yourself identified
[1:13:21] that proud spirit we've spoken of
[1:13:24] repent there is a way back
[1:13:28] if you're too proud to repent there's
[1:13:30] little hope for you there is no hope for
[1:13:32] you
[1:13:34] until you repent if you've got that
[1:13:37] proud spirit now
[1:13:38] it manifests itself in different ways
[1:13:41] america is proud beyond any
[1:13:43] nation that i know of i've been
[1:13:46] privileged to
[1:13:47] just meet a few you know the pakistanis
[1:13:50] are most humble people just
[1:13:51] precious people but if you're with them
[1:13:53] long enough you realize
[1:13:55] they got proud pride too it just
[1:13:57] manifests in a different way
[1:13:59] some a little more palatable to an
[1:14:02] american
[1:14:04] all of us are that way you know we
[1:14:06] appreciate i
[1:14:07] really enjoy the overseas brothers
[1:14:08] because it's a breath of fresh air to
[1:14:10] get away from the pride and arrogance
[1:14:12] of america but it's a pleasure
[1:14:16] it's a breath of fresh air to be with
[1:14:19] god's people wherever they're at
[1:14:21] you know if if we can't come to church
[1:14:24] and get a breath of fresh air
[1:14:26] from walking out in in the society and
[1:14:30] and the workplace if we can't get a
[1:14:32] breath of fresh air here
[1:14:33] we're in the wrong church we're in the
[1:14:36] wrong place we need to find
[1:14:37] somewhere where there's a spirit of god
[1:14:41] living in people manifesting in people
[1:14:45] you be that breath of fresh air for me
[1:14:48] let me be that breath of fresh air for
[1:14:49] you
[1:14:52] repent humble yourself if you see these
[1:14:53] things in yourself
[1:14:55] turn from that path reject that spirit
[1:14:58] of pride
[1:14:59] would the musicians come please
[1:15:02] we know the bride won't be lost so we're
[1:15:05] not trying to put a
[1:15:06] spirit of fear when you say
[1:15:10] because we see that spirit of pride in
[1:15:11] us i suppose all of us see that
[1:15:14] demonstrated or are evident at some
[1:15:16] point in our life
[1:15:20] no doubt multiple times a day repent
[1:15:23] don't wait till the communion night why
[1:15:25] why wait why wait for the next communion
[1:15:28] you may not be there let's get it right
[1:15:29] now let's have communion every day amen
[1:15:32] we may not stand in the front and take
[1:15:34] the bread and the wine let's have
[1:15:36] communion let's have the true communion
[1:15:40] you know if if god could keep the smell
[1:15:42] of smoke off the three
[1:15:43] hebrew children in the fiery furnace
[1:15:46] even the smell of smoke
[1:15:48] then he can also keep that smell of
[1:15:50] pride off of you
[1:15:53] you can be delivered to that oh it's
[1:15:55] gonna be a battle
[1:15:56] uh and i i'm gonna battle it tomorrow
[1:16:00] and the next day the next day the next
[1:16:02] day
[1:16:04] but it's not mine it's this it's this
[1:16:07] green paint i've got on me

[1:16:12] have come into the service

[1:16:17] have a word of prayer
[1:16:23] we've got to be delivered to that every
[1:16:26] trace of it

[1:21:32] i've been edified by the word been
[1:21:36] corrected
[1:21:37] but corrected in a good way and there's
[1:21:39] so many golden nuggets that was dropped
[1:21:41] so many
[1:21:42] things that i wrote down that blessed me
[1:21:43] so much
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:21:46] one thing at the end that he was talking
[1:21:48] about is he'd be willing
[1:21:51] to remain a little longer i mean the
[1:21:53] world is wicked
[1:21:55] the world is wicked it's evil and it's
[1:21:57] grieving on every hand every
[1:21:59] where you turn everything you hear every
[1:22:01] conversation it's wicked it's evil it's
[1:22:04] grieving
[1:22:06] but yet is there something in us that
[1:22:08] has a heart for souls
[1:22:11] i remember what it was like when i heard
[1:22:13] the message
[1:22:14] i was steeped in darkness but i thought
[1:22:16] i was in light
[1:22:17] i was blind but i thought i could see
[1:22:20] then the message
[1:22:21] came and it opened my eyes and it did
[1:22:23] something on the inside of me that was
[1:22:25] permanent and forever
[1:22:26] things that i couldn't do for myself the
[1:22:28] word did for me
[1:22:31] and do i have enough love in my heart to
[1:22:32] wish somebody else if there's one more
[1:22:34] that can experience what god gave me
[1:22:36] i'm willing to stay how many say i'm
[1:22:38] willing to stay for one more song
[1:22:42] how can we can we take the spirit of
[1:22:44] abraham the father of faith and say lord
[1:22:46] would you spare it could you
[1:22:48] is there any way you could spare can we
[1:22:50] implore with god
[1:22:51] oh what a what a spirit
[1:22:54] you know i went monday brother jeremy
[1:22:57] sanders and i went monday to go see levi
[1:22:59] yoder and his family
[1:23:01] and just to hear levi talk about the
[1:23:03] message
[1:23:04] talk about his church and his burden
[1:23:07] for souls anybody that would believe the
[1:23:09] message
[1:23:10] in his amish church he said he's trying
[1:23:13] to get reinstated to the church
[1:23:14] and he says he goes if i have to keep
[1:23:17] the rules i'll keep the rules just so i
[1:23:19] can witness to him
[1:23:21] he said if i if i have to keep a beard
[1:23:23] and drive a buggy
[1:23:24] and he said even said and not use a
[1:23:26] power drill he said which would be
[1:23:28] really nice
[1:23:30] which would be really nice he doesn't
[1:23:34] believe he has to do those things he
[1:23:36] doesn't believe he has to keep his beard
[1:23:37] unto him he doesn't believe he has to
[1:23:39] use
[1:23:39] manual tools he doesn't believe that he
[1:23:41] can't have power
[1:23:43] but he's willing to do it so somebody
[1:23:46] else in the amish community can receive
[1:23:48] what he received
[1:23:51] that's the love of god that's the
[1:23:53] reality
[1:23:55] i just say god give me that heart where
[1:23:58] if there's somebody else that can hear
[1:24:00] give me a willingness to endure evil and
[1:24:02] wickedness and
[1:24:03] debauchery i'll take it one more day
[1:24:06] even
[1:24:06] the weakening of my flesh as i get older
[1:24:09] and then i'll take it
[1:24:10] one more day i'll take it 10 more years
[1:24:12] i'll take it 40 more years if somebody
[1:24:14] else can have what i have
[1:24:19] that's that's the attitude of jesus
[1:24:22] his bride will have the same spirit
[1:24:26] you know god made lucifer all that
[1:24:28] lucifer was
[1:24:30] and if lucifer would have just stayed in
[1:24:32] position and stayed humble and stayed
[1:24:33] submissive
[1:24:34] he could have remained that forever
[1:24:38] he didn't lose it because god wanted him
[1:24:41] to lose it he lost it because he
[1:24:43] couldn't stay where
[1:24:44] he was and he couldn't stay humble he
[1:24:46] had to have something more he had to be
[1:24:47] a little bit better
[1:24:49] he said god help me be satisfied with my
[1:24:51] portion
[1:24:53] help me whatever portion whatever my lot
[1:24:55] in life whatever my position in the body
[1:24:57] whatever it is you've given me do let me
[1:24:59] be satisfied with my portion
[1:25:02] and let me live in it with all of my
[1:25:04] hearts
[1:25:05] [Music]
[1:25:07] something that blessed me is brother ron
[1:25:10] just being brother ron i love that he
[1:25:13] can take the freedom and just be himself
[1:25:15] and i was thinking in my seat when he
[1:25:17] was talking about the alice chalmers
[1:25:18] tractor
[1:25:20] i think it's shamgar using ox goad and
[1:25:22] brother ron just using alice chambers
[1:25:24] tractor to do the same thing to beat
[1:25:27] back the philistine forces the demonic
[1:25:29] forces that bring doubt
[1:25:31] and confusion about ourself and
[1:25:33] questionings about our past and ourself
[1:25:35] amen shamgar took an ox code because
[1:25:37] that's what he had and he beat back the
[1:25:39] philistines
[1:25:40] who were trying to rob him of his
[1:25:41] god-given possession amen but
[1:25:43] in in this place amen the devil's been
[1:25:46] trying to rob us of our god-given
[1:25:47] possession
[1:25:48] true justification a revelation of where
[1:25:51] we really came from that we never sinned
[1:25:53] in the
[1:25:53] first place and our brother ron being a
[1:25:56] farmer
[1:25:56] amen took an alice chambers tractor and
[1:25:59] drove back the philistines
[1:26:03] what an example if god can use
[1:26:07] brother ron and his love for an orange
[1:26:09] tractor
[1:26:10] to preach a truth and drive back the
[1:26:12] enemy what can he do with us
[1:26:14] the way he made us and where he's
[1:26:16] positioned us let's just be happy being
[1:26:18] what we are and let god do that
[1:26:21] whatever he wants to do with us
[1:26:25] and remember humility cannot be
[1:26:31] faked humility cannot be
[1:26:35] it's you can't pretend you can't fake
[1:26:37] humility
[1:26:38] the only way for the bride of jesus
[1:26:39] christ to express true humility
[1:26:42] is because it's a characteristic that's
[1:26:43] in the seed already
[1:26:46] you can't make it up you can pretend
[1:26:48] that all all that it needs is for that
[1:26:51] seed to get enough light
[1:26:52] enough word the right environment enough
[1:26:55] things moved out of the way so it can
[1:26:56] express what's already in it
[1:26:58] so what do we have to do we have to die
[1:27:00] to ourselves and get everything out of
[1:27:02] the way to express the humility
[1:27:04] that's already there you can't take
[1:27:05] humility and put it in humility has to
[1:27:07] already be there
[1:27:09] because it's the life of jesus christ
[1:27:11] and it just needs to be displayed
[1:27:13] i say god let me stay in the word let me
[1:27:15] stay under the shining light of your
[1:27:17] spirit
[1:27:18] until you can bring humility out of the
[1:27:20] sea in my life
[1:27:22] amen i've been blessed and been
[1:27:24] encouraged
[1:27:25] to keep pressing the battle keep doing
[1:27:28] what we do
[1:27:30] may we have charity that edifies
[1:27:34] i don't ever want to have a puffed up
[1:27:35] attitude when i drive by a drunkard or a
[1:27:37] homeless person under a bridge or
[1:27:40] or whatever crime i see i don't want to
[1:27:42] have any more pride or arrogancy
[1:27:45] say how could they my goodness if it
[1:27:48] wasn't for the grace of god i could be
[1:27:49] the one
[1:27:50] under the bridge i could be the one who
[1:27:53] abused his child or the one who stole or
[1:27:55] the one
[1:27:56] i could be that same person amen i
[1:27:59] didn't have any
[1:28:00] better start to life i didn't i didn't
[1:28:02] make any better decisions amen it was
[1:28:04] the grace of god that interrupted me
[1:28:06] from my own plans
[1:28:07] of self-destruction
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:10] man how can i i mean cast condemnation
[1:28:14] all i can say is god if there's any way
[1:28:18] if there's any way for that man to come
[1:28:19] out of the gutter let it be lord
[1:28:22] if there's any way if you want to use me
[1:28:24] use me use whoever but god if there's
[1:28:25] any way
[1:28:26] somebody can find mercy if there's any
[1:28:28] way somebody can find your grace
[1:28:30] lord just let it be oh
[1:28:33] jesus beard plucked out of his face beat
[1:28:36] over the head with the stick
[1:28:38] mocked hanging on a cross being being
[1:28:41] mocked and ridiculed and scourged and
[1:28:43] forsaken and rejected
[1:28:44] could still look down and say father
[1:28:46] forgive them
[1:28:48] they don't know what they're doing what
[1:28:49] ought the bride of christ to do when she
[1:28:51] walks to this evil world
[1:28:53] say the same thing amen i've been
[1:28:55] edified
[1:28:56] i hope you have too i hope we walk out
[1:28:59] here different than the way we walked in
[1:29:01] with a different focus and a different
[1:29:03] attitude and a prayer in our heart

[1:29:08] of the lord may god bless you and go
