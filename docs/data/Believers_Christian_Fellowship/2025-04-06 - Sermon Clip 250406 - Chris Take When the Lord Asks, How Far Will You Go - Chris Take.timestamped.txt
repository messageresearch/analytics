[0:00] And he turned to the woman and said unto
[0:02] Simon, "Seeest thou this woman. I
[0:03] entered into thine house, thou gavest me
[0:05] no water for my feet, but she hath
[0:08] washed my feet with tears and wiped them
[0:11] with the hairs of her
[0:13] head." Do you know? I tried to get a
[0:15] picture and I just couldn't find one
[0:17] that was worthy of it. But do you know
[0:19] how dirty and nasty their feet got?
[0:22] They're in
[0:23] sandals, not walking on asphalt.
[0:27] you know, pretty little country asphalt
[0:29] thing. You know, I always crack up about
[0:30] this. Like, we're going to go on a
[0:31] nature walk and it's got asphalt or
[0:34] pavement. No, they were walking through
[0:36] the dust, the same trail that the
[0:39] donkeys and the horses and everything
[0:42] right there. Trapping and you know, you
[0:44] can't avoid it after a while. Just all
[0:46] mixes together. Stink. I mean, you can't
[0:49] imagine it. It's hot. It's humid.
[0:52] There's sweat. Well, maybe not humid cuz
[0:53] it's kind of the desert, but I'm sure
[0:54] there was. Anyways, the feet were
[0:57] really, really gross. Really, really
[0:59] dirty. How many of you sisters, you
[1:01] know, you you keep the hair up, right?
[1:03] You go to wash the gross dishes, you put
[1:05] it up, right? You keep it out of the
[1:06] nasty water. You keep it you keep it
[1:08] clean. It's your honor. It's your glory.
[1:10] Take good care of it as you should. And
[1:12] here is this woman willing to surrender
[1:14] everything cuz she was a prostitute. So,
[1:16] looking good was good for business. She
[1:19] was willing to
[1:20] surrender all of that and say, "I'm
[1:22] gonna guess, you know, it might damage
[1:24] my hair. It might
[1:26] you know, whatever it be. And she was
[1:28] willing to do all that at the feet of
[1:30] Jesus and wipe that stuff with her hair.
[1:33] And kiss his feet. Amen. How far will
[1:37] you go? You say, "Oh, brother, I'll
[1:41] wash, you know, I'll get a I'll get some
[1:44] paper towels and I'll wash the feet."
[1:47] And everyone, you know, we say, "Oh,
[1:48] wow. Praise the Lord. That brother's
[1:50] washing the feet of Jesus." Jesus is
[1:52] looking and saying, "I asked you to go
[1:53] all the
[1:55] way." You see how far you go and then
[1:58] you don't go all the way. You might as
[1:59] well have not gone at all.
[2:02] The point is total surrender.
[2:06] Total
[2:08] surrender. Saints of God ch I mean take
[2:11] it back to your
[2:12] studies. See where it doesn't
[2:15] fit where God is always asking us how
[2:18] far will we go?
[2:20] But instead of going at how far he asks
[2:24] us, we go how far we think we should go.
[2:28] And we lean to our own understandings.
[2:31] God is asking for a mature bride to be
[2:34] willing to do anything he asks him to
[2:38] do, asks us to do when he asks us to do
[2:42] it.
