[16:11] going to continue on with the seven
[16:12] golden candlesticks this will be part
[16:14] four
[16:15] and like i said before i'm having a hard
[16:17] time getting off of this and
[16:19] i've been enjoying it and so there was
[16:21] something special that the lord really
[16:23] inspired me with
[16:25] in this that i want to share with you
[16:27] tonight
[16:28] and i'm going to preach this in a way
[16:30] that i didn't expect to preach it but
[16:32] god just dropped an inspiration in my
[16:34] heart and it was really a blessing to me
[16:37] let's begin reading in revelation
[16:39] chapter 1 verse 9.
[16:40] [Music]
[16:42] i john who also am your brother in
[16:44] companion and tribulation and in the
[16:47] kingdom and patience of jesus christ was
[16:50] in the aisle that is called patmos for
[16:52] the word of god and for the testimony of
[16:53] jesus christ
[16:55] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[16:57] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[16:59] a trumpet
[17:00] saying i am alpha and omega the first
[17:03] and the last
[17:04] and what thou see us to write in a book
[17:06] and send it unto the seven churches
[17:08] which are in asia under ephesus and unto
[17:10] smyrna under pergamus and unto thyatira
[17:13] and unto sardis and then to philadelphia
[17:15] and until leo to see him and i turned to
[17:18] see the voice that spake with me and
[17:20] being turned i saw seven golden
[17:22] candlesticks and then god bless you as
[17:25] you're seated
[17:27] and then the subject that i i want to
[17:28] take the subtitle is the presence of the
[17:30] judge so the seven golden candlesticks i
[17:33] want to talk this evening about the
[17:35] presence of the judge and when i came to
[17:38] this i've been looking at this for for
[17:39] several weeks and as i i knew i was
[17:42] coming to this section and wanted to
[17:43] minister on it amen i had an expectation
[17:46] of how i would minister on this but like
[17:49] i said before my expectation has changed
[17:51] amen and i thank god for that and so
[17:54] first i want to start off with this
[17:56] statement where he heard a voice amen he
[17:58] was he was uh
[18:01] in the spirit on the lord's day and
[18:02] heard a voice behind him as of a trumpet
[18:04] and then he turned to see the voice and
[18:07] he saw seven golden candlesticks here's
[18:10] what brother benham said under the
[18:11] church age book and i've alluded to this
[18:13] a few times but he said
[18:16] i turned to see the voice that spake
[18:17] with me and being turned i saw seven
[18:19] golden candlesticks
[18:21] john does not say that he turned to see
[18:23] the one whose voice he heard
[18:25] but he turned to see the voice oh i
[18:28] liked that he turned to see the voice
[18:31] the voice and the person are one and the
[18:33] same jesus is the word
[18:37] amen this is such a statement amen that
[18:39] he turned to see the voice the scripture
[18:42] is very uh specific in the way it's
[18:45] worded he didn't turn to see the one who
[18:48] spoke he turned to see the voice amen
[18:51] because the the the voice in the person
[18:54] he says you're a one and the same jesus
[18:56] is the word then he goes to john 1 1. in
[18:59] the beginning was the word and the word
[19:00] was with god and the word was god the
[19:03] same was in the beginning with god all
[19:05] things were made by him and without him
[19:07] was not anything made that was made
[19:09] if you can ever get to really see the
[19:12] word you will be seeing jesus
[19:17] that statement did something for me if
[19:19] you can ever if you can ever get to
[19:22] really see the word you will be seeing
[19:25] jesus amen that's what we want to see
[19:27] amen everybody wants to see the lord
[19:30] amen but with this in order to see him
[19:32] if you ever
[19:33] really
[19:34] see the word you will be seeing jesus
[19:38] because he is the word
[19:40] amen let's continue on
[19:43] and pick up at verse 13 and continue
[19:45] reading
[19:47] and in the midst of the seven
[19:49] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[19:51] man clothed with the garment down to the
[19:53] foot and gird about the paps with a
[19:55] golden girdle his head and his hairs
[19:57] were white like wool as white as snow
[20:00] and his eyes were as a flame of fire
[20:02] and his feet like undefined brass as if
[20:05] they burned in a furnace in his voice as
[20:07] the sound of many waters and he had in
[20:10] his right hand seven stars and out of
[20:12] his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword
[20:14] and his countenance was as the sun
[20:16] shineth in his strength and when i saw
[20:18] him i fell at his feet as dead and he
[20:20] laid his right hand upon me saying unto
[20:22] me fear not i am the first and the last
[20:26] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[20:28] behold i am alive forevermore amen and
[20:31] have the keys of hell and of death
[20:34] write the things which thou has seen and
[20:36] the things which are and the things
[20:38] which shall be hereafter the mystery of
[20:40] the seven stars which thou sawest in my
[20:42] right hand and the seven golden
[20:44] candlesticks the seven stars are the
[20:46] angels of the seven churches and the
[20:48] seven candlesticks which thou saw us are
[20:51] the seven churches amen
[20:55] so
[20:56] brother branham goes on to say in the
[20:58] thyatiran church age referring to this
[21:00] portion of scripture
[21:02] he says but between his priestly
[21:04] operation when the sanctuary is left
[21:06] then we find him standing there and john
[21:09] said he was in the spirit on the lord's
[21:11] day not the seventh day not sunday
[21:14] that's all mistaken we found we found
[21:17] that out searching it through the
[21:19] scripture it was the lord's day this is
[21:21] the day of man the coming of the lord
[21:23] will be his day
[21:25] and we find him in the lord's day and
[21:27] when and when he seen the lord he had on
[21:30] a snow white hair and we know that that
[21:33] represents a judge another thing he
[21:36] he was not priest then because the
[21:38] priest was tied around the middle means
[21:40] service but he was tied around the paps
[21:43] up here which means that he was a judge
[21:45] amen and we see him walking in the midst
[21:48] of the seven golden candlesticks and now
[21:50] we took
[21:51] back to the ancient of days being white
[21:54] at the white throne judgment when daniel
[21:56] saw him
[21:57] come to the ancient of days whose hair
[21:59] was as white as snow now white the old
[22:02] english judges down through the years
[22:04] used to be when they went into judgment
[22:06] seat they put on a big white wig snow
[22:08] white wig because they were judges and
[22:11] john saw him in the lord's day when he
[22:13] was a judge
[22:15] amen
[22:17] so when john
[22:19] turns to see the voice and many see
[22:22] seven golden candlesticks and one like
[22:24] unto the son of man in the midst and
[22:26] then we have the description and the
[22:27] description begins with the white hair
[22:30] and it moves all the way down through
[22:31] eyes is a flame of fire feet is brass
[22:34] sword going out of his mouth and we see
[22:36] him as a judge and brother brahma says
[22:38] in several places not a priest but as a
[22:41] judge amen not in a priestly
[22:43] dispensation but in a judge dispensation
[22:47] and so it brings us to this picture
[22:50] and i'm going to quote out of the
[22:51] message it is the rising of the sun it
[22:54] says and now as as this went up we have
[22:57] the picture outside on the plaque
[22:59] but then i have the picture laying
[23:00] present here if you notice as life
[23:03] magazine had it but i wonder if my
[23:05] audience visible here has ever really
[23:07] looked at the picture see see in the way
[23:09] it should be
[23:11] you remember i was preaching when this
[23:13] vision came upon the subject of the book
[23:14] of revelations where the old judges
[23:17] where we seen jesus in revelation 1 when
[23:20] we started to open the seven seals or
[23:22] the church ages rather just prior to the
[23:24] opening of the seven seals christ was
[23:27] standing with hair like wool white and i
[23:30] described that to you that the old
[23:31] english judges and judges of long ago
[23:33] when they went to the bench to be sworn
[23:35] in their supreme authority was given
[23:37] them they wore a white wig as it was
[23:40] over their heads to show their supreme
[23:42] authority
[23:44] well if you'll turn the picture like
[23:46] this
[23:47] if you'll turn the picture like this and
[23:49] look you can probably see it from the
[23:51] audience it's christ see his eyes
[23:54] looking here just as perfect as could be
[23:56] wearing the white wig of supreme deity
[23:58] and judge of all heavens and earth can
[24:01] you see his eyes nose his mouth just
[24:03] turn the picture from this the way they
[24:05] had it this away the way it's supposed
[24:08] to be and can you see it he is supreme
[24:11] judge there is none other but him and
[24:13] that is a perfect identification again a
[24:16] vindication that this message is the
[24:19] truth this is the truth it is true and
[24:22] making him not a third person but the
[24:24] only person
[24:26] so when brother venom was instructed to
[24:28] take the picture and turn it to the
[24:29] right he knew that it was a pyramid of
[24:32] angels and he knew he had gotten caught
[24:34] up in the constellation of angels amen
[24:36] he knew it was a supernatural cloud
[24:38] and but when he's told to turn it then
[24:40] he recognized that it was christ and he
[24:42] even said in one place that is our lord
[24:44] up there and he saw christ come as the
[24:48] white wigged one as the judge as the
[24:50] supreme judge of all heavens and earth
[24:53] supreme deity amen and he says this is
[24:56] another vindication that this message is
[24:59] the truth amen why because when we see
[25:02] him this time we see him coming as a
[25:04] judge it's a vindication that the
[25:06] message is true
[25:08] so why is it a vindication the message
[25:10] is true amen because if he's taken the
[25:14] book and loosed the seals amen he's not
[25:17] coming now as priest he's coming now as
[25:20] judge so when brother branham sees him
[25:22] as the white wigged one amen it's a
[25:24] vindication that the message he had
[25:26] preached is the truth the seals are open
[25:29] amen
[25:31] so he said this is another vindication
[25:34] there's
[25:35] this is none other but him and there's a
[25:37] perfect identification again a
[25:40] vindication that this message is the
[25:43] truth this is the truth it is true and
[25:45] making him not a third person but the
[25:48] only person
[25:50] praise be to god
[25:53] so
[25:54] brother lamb goes on to say further in
[25:57] it is the rising of the sun and the very
[25:59] seven angels which represented the seven
[26:01] churches all completed and we couldn't
[26:03] even see it they did they took the
[26:05] picture not us and there he's standing
[26:08] there supreme judge showing that he is
[26:10] alpha omega the beginning and the end
[26:13] what identification quickening power did
[26:16] that to us
[26:19] so it was very significant that brother
[26:21] bannon saw him amen and we all could see
[26:23] him amen in this dispensation as the
[26:26] white wigged one
[26:28] and we he shows it in revelation chapter
[26:31] one that in the day of the lord amen he
[26:34] uh john is in the spirit on the day of
[26:37] the lord amen and that's at the coming
[26:38] of the lord and he sees the the a
[26:41] seasoned image when he hears a voice he
[26:43] turns to see what he sees is seven
[26:45] golden candlesticks which represent the
[26:47] seven church ages and one like the son
[26:49] of man in the midst in the form of a
[26:51] judge so the judge is in the midst of
[26:54] the seven golden candlesticks are in the
[26:56] midst of the bride
[26:58] amen
[27:00] and so
[27:01] there's something significant that that
[27:04] transpired in a transition of
[27:07] dispensations amen and brother branham
[27:09] was talking in 1961 in revelation
[27:12] chapter
[27:13] four part three and i just want to uh uh
[27:16] rehearse some things we've been over
[27:18] before but so we're all on the same page
[27:20] so that we can move forward together
[27:22] amen brother branham goes to in this in
[27:25] this message revelation chapter 4 from
[27:27] 1961 he preaches this after he's done
[27:30] with the church ages and before he's
[27:32] come to the revelation of the seven
[27:34] seals and he's in revelation four and he
[27:37] takes us to back to leviticus 16 the day
[27:40] of atonement and the movement in the
[27:42] work of the high priest on the day of
[27:44] atonement and brother ben shows us that
[27:46] on the day of atonement which was one
[27:48] day out of the whole year the high
[27:51] priest would go alone into the holy of
[27:54] holies amen and he would go first
[27:56] offering blood for himself and his
[27:58] household so that he would be an
[28:00] accepted high priest and then he would
[28:02] go and he would carry in blood from a
[28:04] sacrifice representing the entire nation
[28:07] of israel amen so that he could he could
[28:10] he could perform the ceremony that would
[28:12] bring an atonement or a covering for all
[28:14] the people of israel all of god's people
[28:17] and in doing so he would go when he took
[28:20] that blood he would go around behind the
[28:22] altar behind the throne amen the mercy
[28:26] seat the ark of god and he would turn
[28:28] back to the east and he would sprinkle
[28:30] seven times upon the top of the mercy
[28:32] sea and brother brenham said in this
[28:35] message he said don't forget that word
[28:37] eastward where's jesus coming from the
[28:39] east and the cloud of glory where does
[28:41] the sun rise in the east so brother baby
[28:42] keeps pointing back to the east
[28:45] and and he and he he says oh isn't that
[28:48] beautiful seven times towards the east
[28:50] what is it the seven church ages shall
[28:53] be covered by blood
[28:56] so he's showing that we have amen a high
[29:00] priest that has gone into the heavenlies
[29:02] as paul talks about and he's there
[29:04] making an atonement he's mediating for
[29:06] the sins of man and and what's he doing
[29:09] he's atoning for our sins and brother
[29:11] man shows us in the day of atonement
[29:13] that's what the high priest was doing
[29:15] and and the high priest had to go around
[29:18] amen behind the altar this is why amen
[29:21] jesus or brother venom is saying in the
[29:23] seals amen john looked all over heaven
[29:26] but he didn't see he didn't see the man
[29:28] that could take the book he didn't see
[29:30] the lamb and all of a sudden he began to
[29:32] weep and they said hey behold the lion
[29:34] of the tribe of jude and he turned and
[29:35] from the midst of the throne came the
[29:37] lamb he hadn't seen him brother graham
[29:39] said where was he he said he was back
[29:41] behind the throne amen
[29:43] so when john in in revelation chapter
[29:46] five and the cry goes out where's a man
[29:49] who's worthy and john looks all over but
[29:51] he doesn't see this slain lamb he
[29:53] doesn't see the lord amen and where is
[29:56] he at and brother man said he's back in
[29:58] the eternities he's back there he uses
[30:00] all this language through the seals he's
[30:02] back behind the throne you have to say
[30:04] what's he doing back behind the throne
[30:06] amen he's mediating for seven church
[30:09] ages that's what he's doing back behind
[30:11] the throne because that's where the high
[30:12] priest went amen and then when the high
[30:15] priest was done with seven stripes he
[30:17] came out before the throne and he
[30:19] sprinkled in front of the throne seven
[30:21] times as if he's tearing seven seals off
[30:24] before the throne
[30:27] amen almighty god
[30:31] so
[30:32] so we know that through the church ages
[30:35] he's in the office of priests
[30:38] but brother ben says here in revelation
[30:40] chapter 1 in the day of the lord or the
[30:43] lord's day
[30:44] we see him in the midst of the seven
[30:46] golden candlesticks as a judge
[30:49] and then brother branham when he comes
[30:51] to the preaching of the seven seals
[30:53] which we know the lamb is the only one
[30:55] who can take the book
[30:58] and the lamb has to take the book amen
[31:01] and when he takes the book now we see
[31:03] him coming as the white wig one now he's
[31:06] coming as the judge
[31:08] so this places us in time in our
[31:11] dispensations and i want to go and look
[31:13] at this day of atonement of the book of
[31:15] hebrews hebrews chapter 9.
[31:18] verse 6
[31:19] now when these things were thus ordained
[31:21] the priest went always into the first
[31:23] tabernacle accomplishing the service of
[31:26] god but unto the second which is the
[31:28] holy of holies went the high priest
[31:30] alone once every year not without blood
[31:33] which he offered for himself and for the
[31:35] errors of the people
[31:38] now this becomes really important
[31:39] because paul is giving us information on
[31:43] this on this sacrifice this feast of
[31:46] atonement and this work of mediation of
[31:49] the high priest he is atoning for the
[31:51] errors of the people and this word error
[31:54] means a sin committed through ignorance
[31:56] and thoughtlessness
[31:59] it's become so important a sin committed
[32:02] through ignorance and thoughtlessness
[32:07] and it god
[32:08] in his mercy when he when he set the
[32:11] feast for israel to keep they were the
[32:14] feast of the lord he provided a feast
[32:17] in which a high priest would make an
[32:20] atonement to cover their sins of
[32:22] ignorance and thoughtlessness not what
[32:25] they did on purpose and not even what
[32:27] they knew was wrong but the things they
[32:29] didn't even know that they were doing
[32:31] that were wrong god was even going to
[32:33] cover those sins by the mediation of a
[32:36] high priest
[32:38] all right well this becomes so
[32:40] incredibly important when you get into
[32:42] the church ages because the church ages
[32:44] were blinded from the full revelation of
[32:47] god they did not have the full word we
[32:49] know that luther smoked and luther drank
[32:52] and luther consented to the persecution
[32:54] of jews amen we understand that that
[32:57] john wesley ordained women ministers and
[33:00] and then they both held to trinitarian
[33:02] ideas and trinitarian baptisms and and
[33:05] all forms of of things that are contrary
[33:08] to the word of god amen and steeped in
[33:10] unbelief but yet
[33:12] luther was a man of god wesley was a man
[33:15] of god they meant the pentecostals in
[33:17] the pentecostal revival they were people
[33:19] of god they were god's children god's
[33:21] elect god's bride and how could they be
[33:24] baptizing in trinitarian baptisms and be
[33:26] god's elect how could they be adorned uh
[33:29] ordaining women ministers and be god's
[33:31] elect how could they be smoking and
[33:33] drinking and swearing and condemning the
[33:35] jews and be god's elect amen because
[33:38] there was darkness amen because of the
[33:41] falling away
[33:42] of the of the cycle of redemption the
[33:45] fall of the church and the restoration
[33:47] of the church they were in in a
[33:49] condition amen where the church had been
[33:51] hybridized where the word had been lost
[33:53] and god was going to restore back the
[33:55] word but god in his mercy in his love
[33:58] for his people he commissioned a high
[34:01] priest to make an atonement for them
[34:03] with seven sprinklings of blood to cover
[34:05] the seven church ages
[34:08] so
[34:09] so
[34:10] you it's so imperative to understand
[34:13] that this is god's great love for his
[34:15] people that he will cover for sins of
[34:18] ignorance because the word wasn't
[34:20] available to luther amen
[34:24] but when you go back to israel
[34:26] that the the only sacrifice was not the
[34:30] feast of atonement in the in the and the
[34:32] goat that was sacrificed that wasn't the
[34:33] only sacrifice there was sacrifices that
[34:36] went all
[34:37] daily into the tabernacle upon the altar
[34:40] there was peace offerings transgression
[34:43] sacrifices sin offerings uh
[34:46] iniquity offerings for iniquity
[34:48] and transgressions of the law they were
[34:50] constantly offering sacrifices to the
[34:52] lord according to the commandment of the
[34:54] law so the law wrote that if you
[34:58] if you disobeyed the word and you knew
[35:01] that you were wrong you were obligated
[35:04] to take a sacrifice amen to the priest
[35:06] so that that sacrifice would atone for
[35:09] your sins
[35:12] so it's not that a worshiper could just
[35:14] wait for the day of atonement no if he
[35:16] knew he was wrong he was obligated to
[35:18] bring a sin offering to bring a
[35:20] transgression offering amen he had to
[35:22] offer for his sins he had to confess his
[35:25] sin and he had to repent of his sins he
[35:28] couldn't just leave it to the high
[35:29] priest on the day of atonement to take
[35:31] care of it no the high priest was there
[35:33] for the things that were not revealed to
[35:35] him that he was doing wrong they were
[35:37] the things that were in darkness to his
[35:38] mind he didn't understand and he didn't
[35:41] know god in his mercy was covering that
[35:43] because he didn't know but if that
[35:45] worshiper knew he was required to repent
[35:48] of that sin and offer a sacrifice
[35:52] that's why in luther's day you were
[35:54] required to come to the knowledge of
[35:56] justification amen you were required to
[35:58] accept that word and surrender
[36:00] everything to that word
[36:03] jesus was not there mediating amen to
[36:07] cover your sin for refusing a word that
[36:09] he'd revealed
[36:11] because to reject the revealed truth in
[36:13] every day was to reject christ
[36:17] and he was not there mediating to cover
[36:20] for your sins of rejecting the revealed
[36:22] word he was there covering for what was
[36:24] not yet revealed
[36:27] luther didn't live a sanctified life but
[36:29] it wasn't the age of sanctification that
[36:31] wasn't revealed to god's people that
[36:32] would come under wesley's dispensation
[36:35] so christ was mediating to cover for
[36:39] luther's lack of sanctification
[36:44] that's why we you know
[36:46] my
[36:48] god when god reveals the truth he
[36:50] requires
[36:52] he requires a repentance and a
[36:54] submission to that word
[36:56] and it's god's grace that he reveals
[36:59] something from his mind his will when he
[37:01] brings a revelation through a messenger
[37:03] through a prophet when he brings that
[37:05] that's god's grace to us to know his
[37:07] will and his desire and his people want
[37:10] to know his will and it's a true it's a
[37:12] pleasure for them to obey the lord it's
[37:15] a pleasure for them to repent and line
[37:17] up with the word
[37:20] so that israel was not free
[37:24] if they transgressed willfully and
[37:27] knowingly against god
[37:29] and refused to bring the required
[37:32] sacrifice
[37:33] and was saying the high priest will
[37:34] cover for it for the day of atonement no
[37:36] it wasn't covering for that sin
[37:38] it was covering for the sins of
[37:40] ignorance
[37:42] this is how god could require
[37:45] adherence to his word through each
[37:47] church age
[37:51] amen
[37:52] so we're all together
[37:54] on this
[37:58] so
[38:01] the white wigged one is present
[38:03] how many believes that
[38:06] the white wicked one is present
[38:08] in the patmos vision brother bam says
[38:10] now let's watch him just a little
[38:12] further as we take the rest of the 13th
[38:14] verse and in the midst that's the middle
[38:16] of the golden candlesticks one like the
[38:18] son of man clothed with a garment down
[38:20] to the foot and gird about the past with
[38:22] a golden girdle
[38:24] now here's more proof that this doctrine
[38:26] is right about it being the lord's day
[38:27] did you notice him he was not a priest
[38:30] during this time neither was he a king
[38:32] he was a judge
[38:35] this is amazing
[38:36] jesus christ is always the prophet
[38:39] priest and king
[38:41] right always he's always but he has
[38:44] dispensations and of operation and here
[38:47] brother branham saying he's not a priest
[38:49] during this time neither was he a king
[38:52] because we're not yet ready for the
[38:54] millennium
[38:56] but we're not yet we're not still under
[38:59] mediation through the church ages and
[39:02] we're not yet ready for the throne of
[39:04] david to be established
[39:06] but there's a dispensation in between
[39:08] these dispensations between the
[39:10] priesthood and between the kingship amen
[39:12] and that is judge
[39:14] that's what he's saying he was not a
[39:16] priest during this time neither was he
[39:18] king he was judged so so there's no time
[39:21] there's i'd say this way there's not any
[39:24] time that he's not a priest there's not
[39:26] any time that he's not a judge there's
[39:27] not any time he's not a prophet there's
[39:29] not any time he's not a king
[39:31] he's still the king when he's the priest
[39:33] he's the king when he's the judge but
[39:34] brother bram's talking about
[39:35] dispensations he's showing we're between
[39:38] mediation and the setting up of the
[39:40] kingdom on earth
[39:44] he was a judge notice a a priest a high
[39:47] priest when he went to the sanctuary or
[39:49] went to minister to serve
[39:51] to service he tied himself around the
[39:53] waist tying his girdle around the waist
[39:55] meant he was serving never tied it over
[39:57] his shoulder but here he comes out
[39:59] walking out with the girdle tied around
[40:01] the top with a sash over his shoulder
[40:03] girded about the paps the breast with a
[40:05] golden girdle girded up high what is it
[40:08] an attorney a judge the judge with the
[40:10] sash over his shoulder girded up there
[40:13] not down as a priest that shows he
[40:15] wasn't in his priesthood now john went
[40:18] all the way over to the lord's day and
[40:20] saw him coming as the judge
[40:24] i'd like to read another quote out of
[40:27] christ as the mystery of god revealed
[40:30] he says see what i mean
[40:32] he has begun to give life into his body
[40:36] why the one that he has redeemed
[40:39] the mediatorial work is done
[40:42] he's bringing his life to body
[40:47] what does that mean
[40:48] he's bringing his life to body what body
[40:52] the body of his bride
[40:54] the mediator work is done he's bringing
[40:56] his life to body and a vindication for
[40:59] the rapture
[41:01] amen brother bram says this isn't christ
[41:02] is the mystery of god revealed he's
[41:04] showing amen where we're at and
[41:06] dispensations amen the mediator work is
[41:09] done the lamb has taken the book the
[41:11] church ages are finished amen now he's
[41:14] coming to unite with his bride and he
[41:16] gives the sign in heaven as the sign of
[41:19] the white wig one as the judge showing
[41:21] what dispensation we're in now is this
[41:24] of judge
[41:26] so
[41:27] we know these things we've talked about
[41:29] these things but they're they're so
[41:30] important that brother ben spent time
[41:32] explaining these things to us so that we
[41:34] would understand and now we realize that
[41:38] that there's a scare and there's a fear
[41:40] in saying that the mediator work is done
[41:43] and he's no longer in the ministry of
[41:45] high priest now he's judged because the
[41:48] fear is
[41:49] that there will be no hope for anybody
[41:51] after that point
[41:53] right has anybody ever heard anything
[41:54] like that
[41:55] that there's no hope for anybody after
[41:57] that point amen and and i would like to
[42:00] just uh i'd like to just say that it's a
[42:03] dispensational change but god has never
[42:06] left his people without mercy
[42:08] never at any time has he left his people
[42:11] without mercy
[42:12] he's a merciful god and his mercies are
[42:14] new every morning he is not going to
[42:16] leave his people his seat his elect
[42:19] without mercy amen at no time has he
[42:22] ever left his people without mercy
[42:25] he's a merciful god and so now he's
[42:27] coming as judge because this is the
[42:29] dispensation amen and he's in the midst
[42:32] of the seven golden candlesticks or in
[42:33] the midst of the bride and and i and i
[42:36] just want to take and and go on a
[42:38] journey the journey that i went on when
[42:40] my mind shifted monday morning in prayer
[42:43] and realize that the greatest thing that
[42:45] ever happened to the bride of jesus
[42:47] christ as that he came among her as a
[42:50] judge
[42:51] that he came among her as a judge amen
[42:54] because it shows that the days of
[42:56] ignorance are passed amen that the
[42:58] partial revelation are over amen that he
[43:01] doesn't need to sit back and mediate
[43:04] like he did through the church ages
[43:06] because at the opening of the seals he
[43:08] unlocked the mystery that was in the
[43:10] back part of his mind and he had already
[43:12] tied together the loose ends and gave
[43:14] the revelation of the whole book unto
[43:16] his bride and now he does not need to
[43:19] stay back and mediate but what he needs
[43:21] is to come amongst her as a judge amen
[43:24] and not as a judge unto condemnation but
[43:28] as a judge unto perfection
[43:30] [Music]
[43:31] amen
[43:32] jesus christ did not come amongst his
[43:35] bride as a judge to condemn her and to
[43:37] cast her away and find every fault and
[43:40] ex
[43:41] use every fault in her as an excuse to
[43:43] put her away he came to unite with her
[43:45] not to put her away he came to be one
[43:47] with her amen not to cast her away but
[43:49] he came as judged with the full measure
[43:52] of the word so that he can begin to
[43:54] judge by the word amen to make his bride
[43:59] perfect in a rapture condition by the
[44:02] word that's been released in this day
[44:05] so the greatest thing that ever happened
[44:08] to the bride of jesus christ is that he
[44:10] come among her as a judge
[44:14] it is his mercy it is his grace it is
[44:16] his love to his bride
[44:19] everybody's so afraid of the judge but
[44:21] if the judge is your husband you're not
[44:23] afraid of the judge
[44:25] there's nothing to fear amen if the if
[44:29] if your husband is the judge then you
[44:31] don't fear the judge amen
[44:34] praise god and if your husband is the
[44:37] judge you should not fear accidentally
[44:41] falling into a transgression and getting
[44:43] arrested by the cops and taking the
[44:45] court and casting the prison your
[44:47] husband is there to make sure that
[44:49] you're going the right way because he's
[44:51] the judge he knows the law and he's
[44:53] there to help you stay out of trouble
[44:57] [Applause]
[44:58] amen
[45:00] so we say judge and people begin to lock
[45:02] up but i don't think this bride should
[45:04] lock up when we say judge or judgment i
[45:06] think the bride should open up and say
[45:08] oh god thank you amen that there's
[45:11] somebody here that knows the right way
[45:13] there's somebody among us that knows the
[45:15] absolute right correct way and there's
[45:17] somebody here that can reveal it amen
[45:19] and give us a chance to line to that
[45:21] right way
[45:24] so if he had stayed as mediator if he
[45:27] had stayed as high priest it would show
[45:30] us that part of the word was yet un
[45:32] unrevealed
[45:34] or unlocked and we would be waiting for
[45:36] the day that the rest of the world would
[45:39] open
[45:40] but when he moved from high priest to
[45:43] to judge it showed that there's nothing
[45:46] left unrevealed or unavailable to the
[45:49] elect of god but now everything is
[45:52] available to god's children
[45:55] that's why i say when you see that sign
[45:57] that cloud that's the greatest thing
[45:59] that has ever happened to the bride of
[46:00] jesus christ
[46:04] let's turn together to first peter
[46:05] chapter 4.
[46:15] first peter chapter 4
[46:19] and i'm going to begin reading
[46:22] verse 17.
[46:27] for the time has come that judgment must
[46:29] begin at the house of god
[46:32] and if it first begin at us what shall
[46:34] the end be of them that obey not the
[46:36] gospel of god and if the righteous
[46:38] scarcely be saved where shall the
[46:40] ungodly and sinner appear
[46:44] now you can look at that scripture and
[46:47] tremble
[46:49] or you can look at that scripture and
[46:50] rejoice
[46:53] because judgment begins at the house of
[46:55] god and if i'm in the house of god
[46:58] if the sin are scarcely be saved
[47:02] the ones that are in the house of god it
[47:04] shows that only the judgment and the
[47:06] presence of the judge will keep us amen
[47:09] from the deception that's in the world
[47:10] that'll keep us from the corruption
[47:12] that's in the world we need judgment to
[47:15] begin at the house of god we need the
[47:17] presence of the judge amen to line us up
[47:19] to the word the deception is so great
[47:22] amen the perversion is so terrible that
[47:24] we have to have the white wig one among
[47:27] us or we won't make it
[47:29] if the righteous scarcely are saved what
[47:31] about the sinners and the rest of the
[47:33] world hey listen friends we're barely
[47:35] going to make it and we're only going to
[47:37] make it because the judge is present
[47:38] it's the only option we have it's the
[47:41] only way is the one who is the word the
[47:43] one who wrote the word the one who
[47:44] restored the word the one who reveals
[47:46] the word is present in the midst of the
[47:48] seven golden candlesticks to keep the
[47:51] bride lying to the word
[47:54] it is our only hope it it's it's a
[47:56] blessing to us it's mercy to us it's his
[47:58] grace it's his love his love is to judge
[48:02] us daily his love is to judge us by the
[48:05] word judges by the message judges by the
[48:08] preaching of the message judges by the
[48:10] confidence of a friend as iron sharpened
[48:12] iron it's like is his love to us to
[48:14] judge us because of the righteous barely
[48:17] are saved
[48:20] how would we make it without the
[48:22] presence of the judge
[48:24] and so wicked and deceptive a day
[48:29] brother bam says in the message
[48:31] indictment he said i want to kind of use
[48:33] it more like if it was like a room of
[48:35] courtroom
[48:36] and after all the pulpit in the church
[48:38] is a courtroom
[48:39] the bible said it's a judgment seat that
[48:41] it must begin at the house of the lord
[48:44] and this is like the throne he's talking
[48:46] about the pulpit this is like the throne
[48:48] and the jury and the witnesses and so
[48:50] forth so brother man preaching
[48:52] indictment he begins to set up the
[48:54] church as a courtroom
[48:57] and so
[48:59] every sunday
[49:00] and wednesday court is in session
[49:04] [Music]
[49:05] the judge's presence
[49:08] he's here to pass judgment
[49:11] brother bam says in the message
[49:13] perfect strength by perfect weakness
[49:16] he said there's a little there's little
[49:18] things that we do
[49:20] and that's what we want to come to
[49:21] church for is to find out where our
[49:23] faults is
[49:27] listen that's many times the reason
[49:29] people leave a church and go find
[49:30] another one or that's why the world
[49:33] begins to become
[49:34] fun and entertaining is because people
[49:37] don't want to hear their faults
[49:40] that's why the the church is the church
[49:42] nominal i mean
[49:44] has become so passive and so
[49:47] afraid to call out sin because the
[49:49] people don't want to hear their faults
[49:53] but
[49:56] for me
[49:57] i say god
[49:59] help me
[50:00] because i can't help myself
[50:06] see that's what we come to church was to
[50:07] find out our faults is and the things
[50:09] that we might better ourselves by if we
[50:12] come to church for any other any other
[50:14] objective than this i'm afraid we won't
[50:16] get too much out of coming to church
[50:19] we must come to find our weaknesses find
[50:22] our bad places and and now see how
[50:24] little we are and put our trust in
[50:26] somebody that's strong
[50:29] amen
[50:31] it's so good when the judge will come to
[50:34] the throne to the judgment seat and
[50:36] begin to judge by the word and the word
[50:39] begins to expose areas in our life where
[50:42] we have bad attitudes where we have
[50:44] selfishness we have wrong motives where
[50:46] we have we have
[50:48] the wrong desire the wrong understanding
[50:51] amen the wrong relationship with people
[50:54] or whatever we're acting in the wrong
[50:56] way as a husband as a wife as a mother
[50:59] as a father as a believer and begin to
[51:01] expose secret sin and secret thoughts
[51:04] and the judges begins to do that amen we
[51:07] can walk away and say you know there's
[51:09] always condemning and always condemning
[51:11] and always condemning and then you could
[51:13] walk away feeling condemned or you can
[51:15] walk away feeling liberated and said
[51:18] there's somebody here there's a man here
[51:20] that can turn on the light amen there's
[51:22] somebody here that can show me i've had
[51:24] a wrong attitude i've had a wrong spirit
[51:26] i've had i've been influenced by the
[51:29] wrong thought or the wrong channel amen
[51:31] and now i'm aware of it and thank god
[51:33] i'm aware of it what if i wasn't made
[51:35] aware of it what if i continued down
[51:37] with the wrong spiritual influence with
[51:39] the wrong thought with the wrong
[51:41] attitude amen with bitterness locked in
[51:43] my heart amen what if i was going
[51:45] contrary to the word and there was
[51:47] nobody to show me the way there was
[51:50] nobody present that could show me what
[51:52] the word said
[51:54] what if the judge wasn't here
[51:58] that's why he was on that's why he was
[52:02] back there doing the mediatorial work
[52:05] because there were so many things that
[52:06] were locked away
[52:08] and hidden from the children of god out
[52:10] of the word of god
[52:12] but this day he's here to open the book
[52:15] and show them all to us
[52:20] see
[52:22] the message didn't come
[52:25] to give us
[52:27] intellectual understanding
[52:30] the message didn't come just to give us
[52:32] something intellectually tantalizing to
[52:34] speak about
[52:37] but the message came to bring us into
[52:39] the perfect image
[52:41] of the bride of jesus christ
[52:44] that's why this message came
[52:46] it came to give us rapturing faith to
[52:49] put us in the right condition it came to
[52:52] put us in our position
[52:54] but be in the right condition for that
[52:56] position
[52:58] and that's why the life of the prophet
[53:01] was so exposed to us because amen that
[53:04] life became uh an exposure of god
[53:07] working with an elect seed amen and we
[53:09] see him coming to maturity and we see
[53:11] god dealing with him and we see god
[53:13] judging him and exposing his sin to him
[53:18] remember when he went to pray for the
[53:19] little baby amen and he had already
[53:22] worked this uh a little plan out where
[53:25] he would deceive the attorney and have
[53:27] his wife tell the attorney that he's
[53:28] outside and and he pulls it off and he
[53:31] goes to pray for a little a baby that
[53:33] his father brought her to be prayed for
[53:36] brought the child to be prayed for and
[53:37] he goes to the hotel and before he lays
[53:39] hands on the child the lord speaks to
[53:40] him and says how can you lay hands and
[53:42] pray for that child when you lied
[53:46] when you lied
[53:49] now
[53:51] brother branham stopped immediately and
[53:54] he tells the man i'm sorry i can't pray
[53:56] for your baby there's something i've got
[53:57] to make right
[53:59] and he goes to the attorney makes it
[54:00] right he makes it right with his wife
[54:02] and he goes out and he prays all day to
[54:05] god
[54:06] and repentance to make that thing right
[54:09] and then when he makes it right and he
[54:10] comes back and he prays for the baby god
[54:12] heals the baby
[54:16] listen that wasn't god's hatred and
[54:19] contempt for brother branham that
[54:20] exposed his sin to him that was god's
[54:22] love for him
[54:24] that was god keeping him in the right
[54:26] channel keeping him in the right line
[54:28] not allowing amen a son of god to go off
[54:31] into the weeds and create havoc and
[54:33] destruction and confusion that was god's
[54:36] love
[54:37] [Music]
[54:39] and we thank god for it
[54:42] when brother benham comes to the message
[54:43] standing in the gap where he you know he
[54:45] you know he wanted to go up near alaska
[54:47] and go up and be a guide and all of
[54:49] these things and god stopped him and
[54:51] corrected him and chastened him and i
[54:54] say thank god amen that was god's love
[54:56] to the man it wasn't god's hatred it
[54:58] wasn't god's contempt it wasn't god's
[55:00] anger it wasn't god's wrath amen it was
[55:03] the love of god amen there was a there
[55:05] was a judge present that could tell him
[55:08] you're going the wrong way and if you do
[55:10] this this is where your life will wind
[55:11] up and that was the love of god
[55:16] and the prophet of god was thankful for
[55:18] that
[55:20] let's go together the first first
[55:22] corinthians let's turn together to first
[55:24] corinthians chapter 11.
[55:32] first corinthians chapter 11.
[55:45] first corinthians chapter 11 verse 31
[55:49] if we would judge ourselves we should
[55:52] not be judged
[55:54] i would say that's the preferred method
[55:57] for how many of you that's the preferred
[55:59] method when you judge yourself read the
[56:01] word god opens them to you say i'm wrong
[56:03] make it right praise god but then verse
[56:06] 32 but when we are judged
[56:10] we are chastened of the lord
[56:12] that we should not be condemned with the
[56:17] world
[56:19] when god when we fail to judge ourselves
[56:22] he'll judge us
[56:25] but when he judges and chastens us
[56:27] spanks us
[56:29] he doesn't do it because he's angry with
[56:31] us
[56:32] because he doesn't like us
[56:34] because he wants us to feel condemned
[56:37] and
[56:37] he wants us to feel
[56:40] punished
[56:42] he does it so that we will not be
[56:45] condemned with the world
[56:47] it is his grace that causes him to judge
[56:51] it is his love that brings judgment it
[56:54] is his great love for the elect it is as
[56:56] overwhelming love and compassion that
[56:59] causes him to judge sin when he finds it
[57:02] in his elect he must do it to save us he
[57:05] must do it for us to save us from
[57:07] ourselves amen he must do it to save us
[57:10] from being condemned with the world amen
[57:12] in his love he will expose our sin to us
[57:15] he will judge us and chasten us amen so
[57:18] that we won't be lost
[57:20] with the world
[57:22] so when brother branham says judgment be
[57:25] must begin at the house of god amen
[57:27] that's not a that's not a a a
[57:30] terrorizing thing where we're afraid to
[57:33] come to church and i and if the and if
[57:35] the word is being preached in such a way
[57:38] that it is hammered in and forced
[57:40] conformity and and making you feel
[57:42] condemned and cast away and no good amen
[57:46] that's not the nature of god that's not
[57:48] what he comes even when god says
[57:49] something hard he says it hard but it's
[57:51] in love amen it's not for condemnation
[57:54] it's not amen to it's not you know to
[57:57] punish you with words god is not
[57:59] punishing you with words amen god is
[58:01] using the necessary words to open your
[58:04] eyes to your condition amen so that
[58:06] you'll repent so you won't be lost with
[58:08] the world
[58:09] he can say it's soft he can say it hard
[58:12] amen however he has to say it amen as
[58:14] long as he gets the point across the
[58:16] whole purpose is love amen that's why
[58:19] amen if it's brought outside of love it
[58:21] doesn't carry the right nature
[58:25] amen
[58:26] even when we even when we chastise our
[58:28] children amen it's because of our great
[58:31] love for them that we chasten them it
[58:33] should never be done because we're mad
[58:35] at them and we can't stand them and we
[58:37] want to get make them suffer a little
[58:39] bit
[58:40] if chastisement is ever performed that
[58:42] way it's not in the nature of god that's
[58:45] why that kind of chastisement is always
[58:47] dangerous and always harmful to a child
[58:51] but the chastisement that is done in
[58:53] love no matter how firm it must be
[58:55] applied and no matter how painful it is
[58:57] to the recipient but when it's done in
[58:59] love it never brings damage amen to the
[59:02] heart of the one who is chastised it
[59:04] always brings freedom from their sin and
[59:06] brings them back into a condition where
[59:08] they can love more willingly
[59:11] that's the purpose of proper
[59:12] chastisement
[59:14] god has chastised men we as parents must
[59:16] have chastisement but it must be in line
[59:18] with god's chastisement
[59:21] our judgment for our children and our
[59:23] and our chastening for our children must
[59:25] be right in line with the way god does
[59:27] it if not we're doing it wrong
[59:34] so
[59:36] god's purpose
[59:38] is love
[59:39] god's motivation is love
[59:43] god's
[59:44] uh
[59:45] the force behind his judgment to his
[59:48] elect his force behind his chastening is
[59:52] love
[59:54] so that
[59:55] we won't be lost he won't lose a one
[1:00:00] so valuable and so precious
[1:00:03] to us
[1:00:06] to him is us
[1:00:08] that he won't allow us to go the wrong
[1:00:10] way
[1:00:12] sometimes chastening is painful
[1:00:15] judgment is harsh sometimes
[1:00:17] it hurts
[1:00:19] but in the end
[1:00:21] it always brings to peaceable fruits of
[1:00:23] repentance
[1:00:24] and brings us back into a closer
[1:00:26] fellowship with god that's always the
[1:00:28] purpose
[1:00:31] now
[1:00:32] when we look at i want to look at this
[1:00:34] scripture here
[1:00:36] jeremiah 17 9
[1:00:38] the heart is deceitful above all things
[1:00:41] and desperately wicked who can know it
[1:00:46] i put this scripture here because it was
[1:00:48] i was meditating on this and thinking
[1:00:49] this is the truth
[1:00:52] this is true about my heart and this is
[1:00:55] true about your heart
[1:00:57] and if you if you don't recognize this
[1:00:59] scripture as true you're falling in the
[1:01:01] worst trap of self-deception there is
[1:01:05] we must all recognize that this is the
[1:01:07] truth
[1:01:09] the heart is deceitful above all things
[1:01:11] and desperately wicked
[1:01:14] who can know it
[1:01:16] there's so many times friends that we
[1:01:18] cannot accurately discern ourselves
[1:01:22] because we're deceived by our own human
[1:01:25] emotions by our own carnal heart
[1:01:29] and we think we've got the right motives
[1:01:31] we think listen when brother branham was
[1:01:34] going to go
[1:01:35] up on the alaskan highway up in northern
[1:01:38] british columbia amen he made religious
[1:01:41] excuses for going
[1:01:44] and he was going up there because he was
[1:01:47] a prophet of god and prophets of god
[1:01:49] they don't mingle with the people they
[1:01:50] don't do all this they go out in the
[1:01:52] wilderness and god gives a message they
[1:01:54] stomp out and they deliver their message
[1:01:56] and they go back and and all of a sudden
[1:01:58] he was deceiving himself
[1:02:01] it was his own wicked heart coming up
[1:02:04] with that plan
[1:02:06] and in the plan he was using scriptural
[1:02:09] types
[1:02:11] he was using he was using the bible he
[1:02:14] was using religious notions to justify
[1:02:17] his own actions
[1:02:21] listen you're not even safe amen if you
[1:02:24] have the bible
[1:02:27] you're not even safe from this kind of
[1:02:29] self-deception if you're holding a bible
[1:02:30] in your hand or reading in the bible
[1:02:32] reading the message but you're still not
[1:02:34] safe from self-deception because a man's
[1:02:36] heart is is desperately wicked
[1:02:42] that's why to have the white wig one
[1:02:45] among us is the greatest privilege we
[1:02:47] could ever have to have a judge that
[1:02:49] knows that heart and knows the word and
[1:02:52] can reveal the word and bring the
[1:02:53] solution to the problem and expose
[1:02:55] what's going on and bring the word upon
[1:02:58] the subject that's the greatest thing
[1:02:59] that we could experience we don't know
[1:03:01] how blessed we are and how thankful we
[1:03:04] are that there's the righteous judge of
[1:03:06] all heaven and earth the supreme judge
[1:03:08] is here amen the white wigged one is
[1:03:11] here the book has been opened the word
[1:03:13] is present and there's a loving god who
[1:03:15] wants to marry you amen but marrying you
[1:03:18] he's got to keep you in the right
[1:03:20] condition so that he can stay married to
[1:03:22] you to take you out of here and he will
[1:03:24] keep you right at all costs
[1:03:29] what a privilege to have the judge in
[1:03:31] our midst
[1:03:32] how we should thank god for judgment
[1:03:34] judgment's not scary judgment's
[1:03:36] beautiful
[1:03:39] have you ever seen a child
[1:03:41] so loved of his parents they never
[1:03:44] judged it
[1:03:46] they never spanked the child they never
[1:03:47] chastened it not once
[1:03:50] the bible says
[1:03:52] that that parent does not love that
[1:03:54] child
[1:03:56] that's what the bible says
[1:03:58] withholding spanking withholding
[1:04:00] chastisement is not an act of love it's
[1:04:03] an act of hate
[1:04:05] god does not withhold chastisement from
[1:04:08] his elect
[1:04:10] he doesn't
[1:04:11] because it's love
[1:04:13] have you ever been in the grocery store
[1:04:15] and seen a child who has never received
[1:04:17] chastisement
[1:04:19] that parent doesn't love that child
[1:04:21] because by the time that 45 minute one
[1:04:24] hour whatever shopping trip is done
[1:04:26] everybody else in that store hates that
[1:04:29] child
[1:04:32] is that the truth
[1:04:34] you've been in a restaurant amen mom and
[1:04:36] dad come in
[1:04:37] two three little children amen and mom
[1:04:40] and dad are consumed in their social
[1:04:42] media or whatever what they're watching
[1:04:44] one's got a phone this way one's got a
[1:04:46] phone the other way and the children are
[1:04:47] climbing over the table and knocking the
[1:04:49] salt shaker off and then knocking stuff
[1:04:51] in the floor and up on the table and
[1:04:53] making a mess of everything the waitress
[1:04:55] is at her wit's end mom and dad aren't
[1:04:57] doing anything about it everybody in the
[1:04:59] restaurant hates that child
[1:05:03] i've whispered to my wife many times i
[1:05:04] said do you think a public display of
[1:05:06] proper chastisement would be appropriate
[1:05:08] right now because i would help
[1:05:11] i would offer my services
[1:05:16] i wonder if i just made a suggestion to
[1:05:18] the mom do you think could i demonstrate
[1:05:24] but that's not love
[1:05:26] that's not love because that child will
[1:05:29] never
[1:05:30] that child will never
[1:05:32] have the right outlook on life have
[1:05:34] self-discipline have the ability to
[1:05:36] manage its own emotions and its own
[1:05:38] passions it'll never it'll never be in
[1:05:41] the right position because it didn't
[1:05:43] have parents who loved it correctly and
[1:05:44] would apply the word properly
[1:05:46] and the nature of god to keep that child
[1:05:50] growing healthy being established to be
[1:05:53] secured to have boundaries to know that
[1:05:56] it's loved
[1:05:58] god won't do that to you and i
[1:06:01] the heart is desperately wicked that's
[1:06:03] why we must train our children that's
[1:06:05] why god trains us
[1:06:08] that's why the judge is present to judge
[1:06:11] us
[1:06:13] the heart is deceitful above all things
[1:06:15] and desperately wicked who can know it
[1:06:17] verse 10
[1:06:19] i the lord search the hearts
[1:06:22] i try the reigns
[1:06:24] even to give every man according to his
[1:06:26] ways and according to the fruit of his
[1:06:28] doings
[1:06:29] a man's heart is desperately wicked who
[1:06:31] can know it i the lord know it
[1:06:34] i the lord will search it i the lord
[1:06:36] will prove it out
[1:06:38] first chronicles 28 9 david's speaking
[1:06:41] to his son solomon he says and thou
[1:06:43] solomon my son know thou the god of thy
[1:06:46] father and serve him with a perfect
[1:06:47] heart and with a willing mind for the
[1:06:49] lord searcheth all hearts
[1:06:52] and understandeth all imaginations of
[1:06:55] the thoughts
[1:06:58] you cannot discern your own heart your
[1:07:02] own heart will deceive you
[1:07:05] you need the lord who searches all
[1:07:08] hearts to search out your heart and show
[1:07:10] you where you're wrong
[1:07:12] we have to have
[1:07:14] and we have to have the one who can
[1:07:16] discern the hearts amen to expose our
[1:07:19] wrongs to us so that we can make them
[1:07:21] right because if not we'll continue to
[1:07:23] walk in self-deception never knowing
[1:07:26] we're deceived never knowing we're off
[1:07:28] the word and will continue walking that
[1:07:30] way to be lost with the world if it
[1:07:32] wasn't for a god who searches the hearts
[1:07:35] and has a word that's open that he can
[1:07:37] reveal in this day to snap us out of
[1:07:39] that condition
[1:07:43] and now i say thank god for the white
[1:07:45] wig
[1:07:46] thank god for the judge in our midst may
[1:07:48] he always be free to judge us may he
[1:07:51] always be free to express his love to us
[1:07:53] through his judgment amen may may this
[1:07:56] place always be a house of judgment amen
[1:07:59] may this pulpit always be the throne of
[1:08:01] judgment may he be free to speak amen to
[1:08:05] deliver his word and to judge us to
[1:08:07] straighten us to chasten us to make us
[1:08:10] line up to his word so that we can be
[1:08:12] what he's called us to be in this
[1:08:13] generation
[1:08:15] the judge came
[1:08:17] to make sure we can go
[1:08:22] the judge came it was the only way for
[1:08:25] us it was the only hope the judge came
[1:08:27] to make sure we can go
[1:08:30] can you imagine
[1:08:32] can you imagine
[1:08:34] a woman being married to the judge
[1:08:37] and she's the worst law breaker in town
[1:08:41] she's the embezzler she's the drug
[1:08:43] dealer she's the this and that but she's
[1:08:45] married to a judge amen how how contrary
[1:08:49] to his nature how wrong that would be
[1:08:51] amen but how so to say i'm the bride of
[1:08:54] jesus christ i'm married to the judge
[1:08:56] but i live absolutely contrary to his
[1:08:58] laws
[1:08:59] that i transgress his laws and i and i
[1:09:02] walk contrary to obedience to his law
[1:09:04] it's just as pathetic it's just as sad
[1:09:06] it's just as wrong as having the worst
[1:09:08] criminal in the city married to the
[1:09:10] judge there's something wrong the judge
[1:09:12] should be taking care of that the judge
[1:09:14] should be keeping it straight the judge
[1:09:16] should be keeping the law in his own
[1:09:18] house and to say that the white wig one
[1:09:21] is here amen that the judge is here he's
[1:09:24] present in the midst of the seven golden
[1:09:26] candlesticks and i'm the bride and i can
[1:09:28] do whatever i want and the judge will
[1:09:30] cover for it it's wrong it's wrong in
[1:09:33] every way it doesn't match anything the
[1:09:35] nature of god amen but she the bride
[1:09:38] should be submitted to the judge and if
[1:09:40] he's the judge she should be the keeper
[1:09:42] of his word amen
[1:09:45] and it should be a pleasure to her
[1:09:49] i found that in the elect of god the
[1:09:51] problem is not keeping the word they
[1:09:53] love the word
[1:09:55] the problem is
[1:09:57] exposing the hidden sin
[1:10:00] the wrong motive that's deep inside
[1:10:04] the the bad attitude and the bitterness
[1:10:07] that stays locked in it's not that the
[1:10:10] children of god don't want to obey the
[1:10:11] word of god when they see it amen they
[1:10:13] make great sacrifices for the word of
[1:10:15] god the problem is when they're in their
[1:10:17] own self-deception and they've got
[1:10:19] bitterness and they don't know it and
[1:10:21] they're harboring a bad attitude and
[1:10:22] they don't see it amen and they're going
[1:10:25] the wrong way spiritually and they don't
[1:10:27] know it amen that's that's pitiful
[1:10:29] that's sad remember but what's worse is
[1:10:32] when god and his mercy and grace will
[1:10:34] come and lay it out and expose it at a
[1:10:36] seat of judgment amen and we would
[1:10:38] refuse to obey what god has given and
[1:10:41] when god exposes us we would walk away
[1:10:44] angry walk away mad we'd walk away upset
[1:10:46] at being exposed
[1:10:52] can you imagine again with me
[1:10:55] the judge's wife
[1:10:59] and
[1:11:00] he sees her
[1:11:02] transgressing the law
[1:11:05] but he never says anything to her
[1:11:08] and never makes it right
[1:11:10] or if she tells him
[1:11:13] he would say honey now listen you can't
[1:11:15] do that because there's a law there's an
[1:11:17] ordinance in this town such and such and
[1:11:19] such and you're not allowed to do that
[1:11:20] you're going to stop that and she says
[1:11:22] what right do you have to tell me what
[1:11:23] to do i'll do whatever i want and
[1:11:25] continue doing
[1:11:27] something's wrong
[1:11:29] and we as the bride of jesus christ
[1:11:31] can't live that way amen we have to say
[1:11:33] god expose my sin to me and when god
[1:11:36] exposes it it doesn't matter how much it
[1:11:38] hurts or how much it rakes against our
[1:11:40] personality how much how deep this
[1:11:42] thing's been embedded in our heart and
[1:11:44] we don't want to let it out we got to
[1:11:45] open up and say god judge me god get
[1:11:48] this out of my life god i recognize now
[1:11:50] that i have a wrong attitude but i can't
[1:11:52] free myself from it come and free me
[1:11:55] i recognize now that i'm holding
[1:11:57] bitterness in my heart but god i don't
[1:11:59] know how to root it out would you come
[1:12:01] and pluck it out of me amen how many how
[1:12:04] many times do you think that if we cry
[1:12:06] out to the lord and we recognize our air
[1:12:08] we recognize where the problem is and
[1:12:10] has been exposed and we lay ourselves
[1:12:12] before the lord and say lord this is my
[1:12:14] problem i'm bitter towards mom i'm
[1:12:16] bitter towards dad i'm bitter towards a
[1:12:18] brother and sister i see it now but i
[1:12:20] have no power to deliver myself come and
[1:12:22] deliver me what do you think the judge
[1:12:24] of all heaven and earth is going to do
[1:12:26] turn his back on you and walk away
[1:12:28] you've just exposed yourself back to him
[1:12:31] and laid yourself at his feet and say
[1:12:33] free me almighty god from this problem
[1:12:36] you didn't hide it you didn't tuck it
[1:12:38] back away amen at the end of service and
[1:12:41] put it back there and walk out and act
[1:12:42] like everything's fine but you laid
[1:12:44] yourself bare and said god i need your
[1:12:46] help i'm wrong in this area i'm wrong
[1:12:48] with this attitude i'm wrong with this
[1:12:50] idea i'm wrong with this form of conduct
[1:12:52] i'm wrong take it out of me almighty god
[1:12:57] amen amen amen
[1:13:00] god is so
[1:13:02] good to us
[1:13:04] let's go to revelation chapter 3.
[1:13:16] revelation chapter 3
[1:13:18] verse 14
[1:13:21] and unto the angel of the church of the
[1:13:23] laodiceans right these things sayeth the
[1:13:25] amen the faithful and true witness
[1:13:27] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:13:30] i know thy works and thou are neither
[1:13:33] cold nor hot i would that thou were cold
[1:13:35] or hot
[1:13:36] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[1:13:38] neither cold nor hot i will spew thee
[1:13:41] out of my mouth
[1:13:43] because thou sayest i am rich and
[1:13:45] increased with goods and have need of
[1:13:47] nothing and knoweth not that thou art
[1:13:49] wretched and miserable
[1:13:51] poor and blind and naked
[1:13:55] what a pitiful condition brother brenham
[1:13:57] said
[1:13:59] to think that everything's fine
[1:14:02] when it's not
[1:14:04] to think to believe
[1:14:06] that we're rich and increased with goods
[1:14:08] and have need of nothing
[1:14:10] not knowing that we're wretched
[1:14:12] miserable poor blind and naked
[1:14:16] turn me to revelation 17
[1:14:20] we're going to see the false church
[1:14:23] revelation 17.
[1:14:28] 17 verse 3
[1:14:32] so he carried me away in the spirit into
[1:14:34] the wilderness and i saw a woman sit
[1:14:36] upon a scarlet colored beast full of the
[1:14:38] names of blasphemy having seven heads
[1:14:40] and ten horns and the woman was arrayed
[1:14:43] in purple and scarlet color and decked
[1:14:44] with gold and precious stones and pearls
[1:14:47] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[1:14:49] abominations of the filthiness of her
[1:14:51] fornication and upon her forehead was a
[1:14:53] name written mystery babylon the great
[1:14:56] the mother of harlots and abominations
[1:14:57] of the earth
[1:14:59] and i saw the woman drunk with the blood
[1:15:00] of the saints with the blood of the
[1:15:02] martyrs
[1:15:03] and of jesus and when i saw her i
[1:15:05] wandered with great admiration
[1:15:07] so you can see this is the condition
[1:15:10] of this great church amen she she's
[1:15:14] full of the filthiness of her
[1:15:16] fornication she's a harlot amen she is
[1:15:19] drunk on the blood of the martyrs but if
[1:15:21] you go to chapter 18 verse 7
[1:15:25] she gives this
[1:15:28] description of herself so we have the
[1:15:30] description that we have of john now she
[1:15:32] has her own description and verse 7 says
[1:15:34] how much she hath glorified herself and
[1:15:36] lived deliciously so much torment and
[1:15:39] sorrow give her for she saith in her
[1:15:41] heart i sit a queen
[1:15:42] and am no widow and shall see no sorrow
[1:15:46] she has no idea of her own wretchedness
[1:15:51] she has no idea of what she looks like
[1:15:53] in the eyes of god she thinks she's fine
[1:15:57] and the false church doesn't think it's
[1:15:59] wicked
[1:16:01] the false church doesn't think it's a
[1:16:05] the denominations don't believe they're
[1:16:06] harlots
[1:16:08] they believe they're right with god they
[1:16:10] believe they're pure they believe
[1:16:12] they're they're doing right standing for
[1:16:14] right this is the condition and god sees
[1:16:16] them they see themselves in a different
[1:16:18] condition amen but god has brought his
[1:16:21] word in this day to expose the condition
[1:16:24] so that there can be a repentance so
[1:16:26] that we don't have to remain in these
[1:16:28] conditions amen nobody on this earth has
[1:16:31] to remain in that condition because the
[1:16:33] word has come to free us from those
[1:16:35] conditions
[1:16:37] let's go back to revelation chapter 3.
[1:16:43] revelation chapter 3
[1:16:46] verse 18.
[1:16:48] jesus in the laodicean church he says i
[1:16:50] counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:16:53] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:16:54] rich and white raiment that thou mayest
[1:16:57] be clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:16:58] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[1:17:01] eyes with i salv that thou mayest see
[1:17:03] as many as i love i rebuke
[1:17:06] and chasten
[1:17:09] what's the sign of his love
[1:17:12] rebuke
[1:17:13] and chasten him
[1:17:16] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[1:17:19] be zealous therefore
[1:17:21] and repent
[1:17:23] amen there should be a zeal in the bride
[1:17:26] in the end time to repent
[1:17:28] but the describes this as an end time
[1:17:30] condition
[1:17:31] a zeal to repent when we recognize that
[1:17:35] we're wrong
[1:17:36] amen and recognize
[1:17:39] that as many as he loves he rebukes and
[1:17:42] chastens
[1:17:43] that's a sign of his love that makes you
[1:17:45] an object of his affection that makes
[1:17:48] you the recipient of his desire is that
[1:17:50] when he finds wrong he'll rebuke and
[1:17:53] chasten he will judge and chasten so
[1:17:55] that we won't be lost with the world it
[1:17:57] is god's special care of his elect it's
[1:18:00] god's tender love for his elect that
[1:18:03] that the world may get away with
[1:18:04] everything you may see other believers
[1:18:06] seemingly they get away with living in
[1:18:08] compromise they get away with doing
[1:18:10] things that that you can't do and all of
[1:18:13] a sudden it feels like you're under the
[1:18:14] critical eye of jehovah that every time
[1:18:17] you take one half step he comes down
[1:18:19] heavy with a rod and stops you and you
[1:18:22] can be you can become bitter over this
[1:18:24] and you become resentful that god won't
[1:18:27] let me do anything i do this much and
[1:18:29] god comes down that hard they're over
[1:18:31] here living it up and living in
[1:18:33] compromise and doing all these things
[1:18:34] and seemingly nothing's happening to
[1:18:36] them and you don't realize his love is
[1:18:39] being expressed more to you ten to them
[1:18:42] it shows that you're the apple of his
[1:18:44] eye that he's watching over you that you
[1:18:47] can't have a wrong thought without him
[1:18:49] correcting it you can't come to church
[1:18:51] without having got a little bit
[1:18:53] a little bit uh uh judgmental or
[1:18:56] critical that god won't call it over the
[1:18:58] pulpit and you're saying i just it was
[1:19:00] one sentence it was five minutes one in
[1:19:02] the world is this why can't i get away
[1:19:04] with anything amen that's god's love for
[1:19:07] you and i it's an expression of how
[1:19:09] closely he's watching over his elect and
[1:19:11] how interested he is in our lives and
[1:19:14] how much he's going to keep us lying to
[1:19:16] his word because everything is dependent
[1:19:19] on us lining to this word because this
[1:19:21] will be the bride amen that restores all
[1:19:24] that was lost this will be the
[1:19:25] dispensation that goes back to being the
[1:19:28] original bride and won't fall like he
[1:19:30] fell why she's predestinated not to so
[1:19:33] his predestination forced him to come
[1:19:36] himself and keep his bride lined up
[1:19:40] he couldn't leave it to you and i the
[1:19:41] heart is deceitfully wicked who can know
[1:19:43] it we don't know our own condition we
[1:19:45] can't see ourselves we don't know how we
[1:19:47] look before the lord so in this day
[1:19:49] because he's prophesied that he will
[1:19:52] have a bride without sparta wrinkle he
[1:19:54] is prophesied amen that he'll have a
[1:19:58] a bride a wife at this time that won't
[1:20:00] fall like he fell it forced him to come
[1:20:03] as the white wig one to make sure you

[1:20:08] to make sure that we will be spot-free
[1:20:11] and wrinkle-free by the washing of the
[1:20:13] water of the word he came as the white
[1:20:15] wig one so that he can keep his word and
[1:20:17] his promise to you and i
[1:20:20] he's here service after service tape
[1:20:22] after tape book after book in your
[1:20:24] prayer time and then with your friend

[1:20:29] line us up don't grow weary in the lord
[1:20:32] rebuking don't get tired of his
[1:20:34] chastening don't get resentful of him
[1:20:37] exposing our sin just say praise be to
[1:20:40] god there's a one here that can keep me
[1:20:43] there's one here that can save me
[1:20:44] there's one here that can purify me and
[1:20:47] perfect
[1:20:50] don't get discouraged when every time
[1:20:52] you make a misstep the rod comes down
[1:20:56] don't that's his
[1:20:58] love don't get weary
[1:21:02] amen when every wrong thought gets
[1:21:04] exposed back to you over the pulpit
[1:21:08] don't go tired of that
[1:21:10] receive it as god's token of love
[1:21:13] receive it as his great love his
[1:21:15] tremendous affection
[1:21:19] we thought to be the apple of his eye
[1:21:21] would make us a spoiled trophy wife
[1:21:26] that's sometimes the mental picture we
[1:21:28] get
[1:21:29] where his bride the apple of his eye the
[1:21:30] treasure of his heart as somehow we're a
[1:21:33] spoiled rich trophy wife
[1:21:35] that he gives luxury cars to in
[1:21:37] vacations and she goes to the spa and
[1:21:39] gets manicures and all of this we think
[1:21:42] somehow that's the picture of what it
[1:21:43] means to be the bride that's not love
[1:21:46] amen that that's not true love amen to
[1:21:49] be the bride amen is to be lined up to
[1:21:51] the word and become a perfect reflection
[1:21:54] of the bridegroom that's what it means
[1:21:55] to be the bride
[1:21:58] if he suffered we must also suffer if he
[1:22:00] fully submitted we must also fully
[1:22:02] submit
[1:22:04] and he's not leaving it to us
[1:22:07] he's come
[1:22:08] himself he's come as the white wigged
[1:22:11] one

[1:22:14] that what he promised in this age will
[1:22:16] come to pass
[1:22:18] he's here to make sure
[1:22:21] that we'll be
[1:22:22] sprinkled with the word
[1:22:24] spotless white and wrinkle-free
[1:22:27] he's here to make sure that this one
[1:22:29] won't fall like evolve because he's here
[1:22:32] to say uh-uh we're not going that way
[1:22:36] thank god the judge is in her midst
[1:22:40] in the day of the lord
[1:22:42] thank god there's a judge that's present
[1:22:44] that loves us
[1:22:45] and will judge us in chasing us
[1:22:48] let's turn together to psalms 23.
[1:23:06] psalms 23
[1:23:09] we'll read verse 1
[1:23:12] the lord is my shepherd
[1:23:14] i shall not want
[1:23:16] he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:23:17] pastures he leadeth me beside still
[1:23:19] waters
[1:23:20] he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in
[1:23:22] the paths of righteousness for his
[1:23:24] name's sake
[1:23:25] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:23:27] the shadow of death i will fear no evil
[1:23:30] for thou art with me
[1:23:31] thy rod and thy staff
[1:23:35] they comfort me
[1:23:37] the rod is used for correction the staff
[1:23:40] is used for guidance and supports
[1:23:42] thy rod and thy staff
[1:23:45] they comfort me
[1:23:47] thou preparest the table before me in
[1:23:49] the presence of mine enemies thou anoint
[1:23:51] as my head with oil my cup runneth over
[1:23:54] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:23:56] me all the days of my life and i will
[1:23:58] dwell in the house of the lord
[1:24:01] forever
[1:24:04] everybody wants to be in verse 5 and 6.
[1:24:08] we all want to be in verse 5 and 6.
[1:24:11] but we'll never make it to verse 5 and 6
[1:24:13] without verse 4.
[1:24:15] if there's not a shepherd with a rod and
[1:24:17] a staff to keep us lined out
[1:24:19] to keep us on the path and the
[1:24:21] correctness one is wrong we'll never
[1:24:23] make it to five and six
[1:24:25] so thank god for verse four
[1:24:27] thank god for a loving shepherd thank
[1:24:30] god for the supreme judge of all heavens
[1:24:33] and earth
[1:24:34] who's in the midst of his bride
[1:24:36] and won't let her go

[1:26:24] that i want to read
[1:26:28] and i'll just recite it to you
[1:26:36] yeah i'll just recite it to you it's a
[1:26:38] psalm oh psalm 139
[1:26:41] psalm 139 23
[1:26:43] says search me o god
[1:26:46] and know my heart
[1:26:49] this is david crying out to the lord
[1:26:51] this is his prayer he's not running away
[1:26:54] from the presence of the lord he's not
[1:26:56] hiding from the judgments of god but in
[1:26:59] prayer he says search me o god
[1:27:02] and know my heart
[1:27:04] try me and know my thoughts
[1:27:07] and see if there be any wicked way in me
[1:27:10] and lead me in the way everlasting
[1:27:15] i say can we make david's prayer our
[1:27:17] prayer
[1:27:18] can we say lord search my heart lord
[1:27:22] search my heart try me know my thoughts
[1:27:25] and see if there be any wicked way in me
[1:27:27] and lead me in the way everlasting
[1:27:31] david had so much confidence in god he
[1:27:34] knew god would not find something in him
[1:27:37] that would cause him to be destroyed
[1:27:40] cast away thrown to the side rejected
[1:27:43] never to be redeemed again he knew he
[1:27:45] was god's he knew he belonged to god he
[1:27:48] knew god called him and if you and i
[1:27:50] know that we are his that we are the
[1:27:52] apple of his eye that we're his delight
[1:27:54] that we're his counterpart on the earth
[1:27:55] if we know that we are sons and
[1:27:57] daughters of god then we should not be
[1:27:59] afraid of god searching our hearts
[1:28:02] we shouldn't be afraid of god going to
[1:28:05] the deep recesses of our heart and
[1:28:07] rooting out things that have been laying
[1:28:08] there since we were a child complexes
[1:28:11] and fears and things we shouldn't be
[1:28:13] afraid we should throw open the doors
[1:28:15] remember brother ben preached doors and
[1:28:16] doors amen we only let him in so far but
[1:28:19] we don't open the inner chamber we don't
[1:28:21] open the doors to the inside but he says
[1:28:23] throw open the doors the doors within
[1:28:25] the doors and the doors and the doors
[1:28:27] and the doors until we say god i'm open
[1:28:30] search my heart oh god and know me amen
[1:28:33] see if there's any wicked way in me know

[1:28:47] no matter how horrible it is no matter
[1:28:50] how grieving it is no matter how much it
[1:28:52] hurts he'll never cast you away and
[1:28:54] throw you away because of what he finds
[1:28:56] he already knows it's there he just
[1:28:59] needs you to submit and yield so that he
[1:29:01] can do the heart surgery to remove it
[1:29:04] he knows it's there he knows what
[1:29:06] happened to you when you were five he
[1:29:08] knows what you went through as a

[1:29:13] abandonment he knows it all he knows the
[1:29:16] abuse he knows it all he knows it's
[1:29:18] there but he's a gentleman he doesn't
[1:29:21] pry open doors amen he's waiting for
[1:29:23] somebody to throw the door open and say

[1:29:28] need of a deep heart surgery there's

[1:30:02] his scalpel is sharp and it cuts deep
