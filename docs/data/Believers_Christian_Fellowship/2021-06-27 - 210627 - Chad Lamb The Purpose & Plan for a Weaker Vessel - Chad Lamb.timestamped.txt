[8:24] amen it's good to be here i was talking
[8:26] to somebody and said i haven't preached
[8:27] two services in a row here and so now
[8:29] i'm nervous again
[8:31] i'm always a little nervous but it's
[8:32] amazing how you get out of
[8:35] just a little bit you just get out of it
[8:37] a little bit and then you get
[8:38] all nervous again you ask god please
[8:40] lord you're in the back saying what am i
[8:42] doing
[8:43] why am i here praise god you'd have to
[8:47] be a preacher to know what that's like
[8:50] but i just want to say it's a privilege
[8:52] i'm so glad to be back and
[8:54] when i think about being back here just
[8:56] the fellowship around the world it makes
[8:58] me excited amen
[8:59] and i just appreciate everybody being
[9:01] here i want to look at first peter
[9:03] chapter 3 verse 7
[9:07] and we'll just read this one portion of
[9:08] scripture and we'll let you have your
[9:10] seats
[9:11] likewise you husbands dwell with them
[9:13] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[9:15] the wife
[9:16] as unto the weaker vessel and as being
[9:18] heirs together of the grace of life
[9:21] that your prayers be not hindered you
[9:23] can have your seats
[9:25] we ask the lord to bless the reading of
[9:26] his word
[9:29] amen i i wanted to take for a subject
[9:32] today out of this scripture
[9:34] the purpose and plan for a weaker vessel
[9:38] the purpose and plan for a weaker vessel
[9:40] drawing that context out of this text
[9:43] and i have to do some explaining to you
[9:46] this is
[9:47] something that last sunday when uh i
[9:49] preached down in north carolina for
[9:51] brother steven shimba we went back
[9:53] to one of the brethren's house there and
[9:54] we were visiting there with some of the
[9:56] a minister and brother stephen and a
[9:58] couple of the deacons and another
[9:59] brother
[10:00] when we were sitting around the table we
[10:01] were just fellowshipping back and forth
[10:03] and we had a
[10:04] wonderful time i think we sat and
[10:05] visited for i think it was close to five
[10:08] hours and it was just word word word
[10:10] word
[10:10] and that's the fellowship we love but
[10:13] brother stephen shared something he had
[10:14] just preached with me and it was along
[10:15] these lines
[10:17] and boy when he shared that it just
[10:19] clicked in me
[10:20] and it something just began to open up
[10:22] many things that
[10:23] we've preached around before but it
[10:25] opened up so
[10:26] i i'm stealing a sermon
[10:30] that's my confession today and uh
[10:33] i tried hard not to preach this i
[10:34] thought i've got something else in my
[10:36] heart i want to preach this
[10:37] and i couldn't get away from this i just
[10:38] have to share it with you
[10:40] and so if you'll just forgive me for
[10:41] doing that but we all plagiarize every
[10:43] sermon we ever preach it comes from the
[10:45] bible comes from the message or from
[10:46] fellowship
[10:47] or something somebody else said and so
[10:50] he
[10:50] we had some tremendous fellowship and
[10:52] just to be fair
[10:54] i started sharing with him something i
[10:55] preached about two years ago
[10:57] and he said brother i've got notes on my
[10:59] desk i'm getting ready to preach that
[11:06] so it's all fair amen
[11:09] it's all fair but that's what it is
[11:11] nobody has a corner on this we need one
[11:13] another
[11:14] and we all are looking at this mountain
[11:16] and observing what god is doing and
[11:18] we're all catching things and we're
[11:19] feeding from one another
[11:20] so i fed i mean i drew deep from that
[11:23] well
[11:23] and this is this is something open to me
[11:25] and i hope it blesses you the way it did
[11:26] in me
[11:27] i'll never be able to preach it the way
[11:28] he did neither will he preach the notes
[11:30] that's in his death the way i did
[11:32] but god will still bring his word to his
[11:35] children the sheep will still get the
[11:37] sheep food
[11:39] so the purpose and plan for a weaker
[11:41] vessel we read this scripture and this
[11:43] scripture has caused a lot of tension in
[11:45] the past
[11:46] because of misuses and misunderstandings
[11:49] unfortunately but that's the way most of
[11:51] the scriptures went through that kind of
[11:53] trial
[11:53] been manhandled and misused and
[11:55] misunderstood and
[11:56] fought against from two polarizing
[11:59] positions
[12:00] but nonetheless it's the truth amen and
[12:02] the word of god is written the way it's
[12:04] written for a reason
[12:05] and so there's an admonition that peter
[12:07] is giving to husbands he said husbands
[12:09] dwell with them according to knowledge
[12:11] giving honor to the wife is unto the
[12:14] weaker vessel so we understand that the
[12:16] wife or the woman is the weaker vessel
[12:19] and i hope you know we live in that
[12:21] laodicea
[12:23] and then this age is so corrupted what
[12:25] feminism
[12:26] really is the femininity of a woman and
[12:29] motherhood and
[12:30] and womanhood and masculinity and it's
[12:33] twisted it all
[12:34] up and i just want to throw all those
[12:35] ideas out the window and come back to
[12:37] the word
[12:38] and i hope by the end of this message
[12:40] that everybody will see the value in the
[12:43] weaker vessel
[12:44] and say praise god for a weaker vessel
[12:47] i just want to at the beginning of the
[12:50] onset i just want to make note
[12:52] that it says to the husbands when he's
[12:54] when he's giving them instructions
[12:56] he said dwell with them according to
[12:58] knowledge giving honor
[12:59] this word honor means value or price
[13:03] so what what peter is not saying
[13:06] as you know you're going to have to
[13:08] understand she's not very good
[13:11] and you're just going to have to deal
[13:13] with it that's not what this scripture
[13:16] is saying
[13:16] it's saying dwell with them according
[13:18] knowledge giving honor or placing
[13:20] value because
[13:24] she's the weaker vessel so there's a
[13:26] value
[13:27] in the weaker vessel and i think that's
[13:30] what we want to look at as we move on
[13:32] let's go to genesis chapter 2
[13:37] and i probably was no surprise to you
[13:38] that we'd wind up in genesis at some
[13:40] point
[13:41] genesis chapter 2 verse 16.
[13:49] genesis 2 16 and the lord god commanded
[13:52] the man saying of
[13:53] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[13:55] freely eat
[13:56] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[13:58] and evil thou shall not eat of it
[14:00] for in the day that you eat us thereof
[14:02] thou shalt surely die
[14:04] and the lord god said it is not good
[14:07] that man shall be alone
[14:08] i will make him a help meet for him and
[14:11] out of the ground the lord
[14:13] god formed every beast of the field and
[14:15] every fowl of the air
[14:16] and brought them unto adam to see what
[14:18] he would call them
[14:19] and whatsoever adam called every living
[14:21] creature that was the name thereof
[14:25] and and adam gave names to all cattle
[14:27] into the fowl of the air and to every
[14:29] beast of the field
[14:30] but for adam there was not found a help
[14:32] meet for him
[14:34] i want you to notice here right off the
[14:36] right from the beginning
[14:37] that every creature that god was
[14:39] bringing before adam
[14:41] was made the same way adam was made
[14:45] for god for god formed man out of the
[14:47] dust of the earth
[14:48] amen and he breathed into his nostril
[14:50] the breath of life and so we know now
[14:52] that
[14:53] every one of these animals now that god
[14:55] is he's
[14:56] he's saying it's not good that man shall
[14:57] dwell alone i shall find a help meat for
[14:59] him
[15:00] so god now is creating and is an
[15:03] original style of creation
[15:05] he's bringing out of the dust of the
[15:06] earth and he's giving the breath of life
[15:08] and he's presenting them to adam
[15:10] and there's not finding a suitable help
[15:12] me but they're
[15:13] all coming according to the original
[15:15] fashion of creation
[15:18] i want you to catch that
[15:22] in verse 21 and the lord god caused a
[15:24] deep sleep to fall upon
[15:26] adam so now god is going to do something
[15:28] different than what he's done before
[15:31] this is something new something
[15:33] different this is
[15:35] not according to the original fashion of
[15:38] creation
[15:40] and the glory god caused a deep sleep to
[15:42] fall upon adam
[15:43] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[15:45] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[15:48] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[15:50] from man made he a woman
[15:52] and brought her unto the man and adam
[15:54] said this is now
[15:55] bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh
[15:58] she shall be called woman because she
[15:59] was taken out of man
[16:01] therefore shall a man leave his father
[16:03] and his mother and shall cleave
[16:05] unto him unto his wife and they shall be
[16:08] one flesh so now we know this scripture
[16:11] so well but
[16:12] when god went to fashion the woman he
[16:15] does it
[16:15] not in his traditional style of creation
[16:18] he's doing it in a different fashion a
[16:21] different form of creating
[16:22] he's doing something different because
[16:24] every time he's been creating
[16:26] he's been bringing out of the dust of
[16:28] the of the ground
[16:30] forming giving the breath of life then
[16:31] they're moving on as creatures and that
[16:33] was god's original way that's the way
[16:35] that he made man that's the way he made
[16:37] adam
[16:37] amen but but now he's taking something
[16:40] from that original creation
[16:42] and making another creation off the
[16:44] original creation
[16:46] and this is the first time he does that
[16:48] and whenever we see things in the
[16:50] scripture like this
[16:51] you always have to put the question mark
[16:53] why did he do it that way
[16:56] we have so much understanding we know
[16:58] that adam's wife was within him amen
[17:00] that he was made male and female that
[17:02] the woman the counterpart
[17:04] that he was looking for was already in
[17:05] him had to be taken out of him
[17:07] couldn't be something different than him
[17:09] had to be the same thing
[17:11] as he is so it was taken out of him
[17:14] formed into another vessel and brought
[17:16] back and the two were won
[17:18] so we know that part of the story but
[17:20] yet god still
[17:21] he has made this woman this help me for
[17:24] adam and he fashioned her differently
[17:26] than he did the rest of his creation now
[17:28] brother branham has quite a bit to say
[17:30] about this and
[17:31] i want to pick up the quote in marriage
[17:33] and divorce
[17:34] he says remember adam was both masculine
[17:37] and
[17:37] feminist in the original creation one
[17:40] but then he was separated by a rib
[17:42] notice by a byproduct and notice the
[17:45] only one of all god's creation
[17:47] all of every animal and anything else
[17:50] she was the only she was only one
[17:53] designed this way
[17:55] every other female was in the original
[17:58] creation
[18:00] catch this brother branham's he he's
[18:03] drawing attention to this difference in
[18:05] the scripture
[18:08] he was not in the original creation
[18:12] she that had to be made that way will
[18:14] get to it after a while notice
[18:16] in this creation that she was in not in
[18:18] the original but a byproduct in this
[18:20] creation
[18:21] now i don't want to hurt your feelings
[18:23] but i want to tell you the truth and you
[18:25] just sit still
[18:26] you're doing nice you guys are doing
[18:29] nice
[18:32] there is nothing designed to be so
[18:34] deceitful as a woman that's deceitful
[18:37] there cannot be nothing else there's
[18:38] nothing made to be that way
[18:40] also there is nothing that can be so
[18:41] easily deceived as a woman
[18:43] now the fall proves this statement to be
[18:45] true the fall in the beginning
[18:48] she was not in the original beginning
[18:50] creation she was an adam
[18:52] but not in a female sex herself at the
[18:54] beginning
[18:55] she was the byproduct made
[18:59] death burial resurrection whoa
[19:09] no no no no
[19:12] hold on just a minute just sit real
[19:14] still you're doing real nice
[19:18] every once in a while this program
[19:21] splices two pages together
[19:24] and i'm not gonna have that happen all
[19:26] right
[19:29] now i'm gonna finish this quote and then
[19:31] i'm moving to the next chord it cut off
[19:32] the top of it
[19:33] she was not in the original beginning
[19:35] creation she was an adam but
[19:36] not in a female sex herself at the
[19:39] beginning
[19:39] she was the byproduct made now we want
[19:42] to go down further in marriage and
[19:43] divorce we're skipping several
[19:45] paragraphs and coming down
[19:46] so now watch his great program unfold as
[19:49] we go on through here now
[19:51] just as perfect as perfect can be i
[19:54] didn't know this till the other day
[19:56] so this is something brother branham's
[19:58] catching why didn't he make her like
[20:01] that in the beginning like the rest of
[20:02] his females
[20:04] because it would be unbecoming to him he
[20:07] is the fountain of all purity that's the
[20:10] reason he had
[20:11] to let satan get a hold of her what he'd
[20:14] done
[20:15] in the perversion such a creature would
[20:18] be would not be becoming to him
[20:20] originally designed for so brother
[20:23] branham is telling us he's going to go
[20:24] on to share this and make this clear
[20:26] he said the woman was created
[20:28] differently than the rest of creation
[20:30] and the reason she was created
[20:32] differently is so that she could be
[20:34] deceived and so that she could fall
[20:38] and it wasn't becoming to god to make
[20:40] the original creation that way because
[20:42] that stepped
[20:43] from his original method of creation so
[20:45] what he did is he made it differently
[20:47] and when he made it differently he took
[20:49] from the original creation
[20:51] and made a byproduct brother ben said or
[20:53] took a portion
[20:54] and made something else off the original
[20:56] and when god made something else off the
[20:58] original
[20:59] what he did is he he he created in such
[21:02] a way
[21:02] that there could be a door open to sin
[21:07] god didn't make her sinful god didn't
[21:10] make her wrong
[21:11] he made her perfect but there was laying
[21:14] a door that could be opened
[21:17] god didn't make the door open
[21:20] he just made her with a door that could
[21:22] be opened
[21:24] and she was put under free moral agency
[21:26] to make her choice whether she opened
[21:27] this door or not
[21:29] right because god had a lamb slain from
[21:33] before the foundation of the world
[21:35] and if there was a lamb slain before the
[21:36] foundation of the world
[21:38] then god already in his mind understood
[21:41] that there would be a fall
[21:42] but it would be unbecoming to him to let
[21:45] his original creation be perverted amen
[21:48] so he
[21:49] made a way that his plan could come to
[21:51] fruition
[21:52] and still amen his creation could still
[21:55] be pure
[21:56] so what he did is he took off the
[21:58] original he pulled something out of the
[22:00] original
[22:01] and made another vessel with a door that
[22:03] could be opened
[22:07] this is why she's called the weaker
[22:10] vessel
[22:12] that's the reason he had to let satan
[22:13] get a hold of her
[22:15] what he'd done in the perversion such a
[22:17] creature would would not be becoming to
[22:19] him
[22:20] originally designed for all his works
[22:23] that he designed
[22:24] in the original is in continuity all of
[22:27] his original works was in continuity
[22:29] the female dog male dog female cow mount
[22:32] male cow
[22:33] everything in continuity all nature's in
[22:35] continuity
[22:36] seed die go in the ground just like
[22:38] death burial resurrection
[22:40] the the sap goes down out of the tree
[22:42] drops its leaf
[22:43] comes back the next year with the
[22:45] resurrection of a new leaf
[22:46] see what i mean everything even nature
[22:49] of god is all in continuity
[22:52] in one and here is one designed out of
[22:54] the continuity of god
[22:58] when he made a male dog he made a female
[23:00] dog he made the female dog the same way
[23:01] he made the male dog
[23:03] he made the male cow he made the female
[23:05] cow the same way he made the male cow
[23:07] but when he made man he made man in his
[23:09] own image male and female
[23:11] when he pulled out of the man the female
[23:12] he made the female differently than he
[23:14] made the male
[23:15] 1 the difference is what matters friends
[23:19] the difference is what there's there's
[23:21] something drawing our attention and
[23:22] brother branham when he gets to marriage
[23:24] and divorce he said i didn't see this
[23:25] till the other day
[23:27] he's recognizing why she was made thus
[23:32] now let's let's go on and keep reading
[23:37] he said now everything's in continuity
[23:41] the sap goes down out of the tree drops
[23:43] his leaf comes back the next year with
[23:44] resurrection of a new leaf see what i
[23:45] mean
[23:46] everything even nature of god is all in
[23:48] continuity in one
[23:49] and here is one designed out of the
[23:51] continuity of god nature is so designed
[23:53] so it can't sin
[23:56] think the original creation of god could
[23:59] not sin
[24:02] so you have to understand god if there
[24:04] was a lamb slain before the foundation
[24:06] of the world
[24:06] there had to be a door somewhere that
[24:08] could be opened
[24:11] to let satan in to bring the deception
[24:14] adam was not deceived adam was the
[24:15] original creation he could not be
[24:17] deceived
[24:18] but the byproduct off of adam part of
[24:21] himself that was fashioned another way
[24:23] not in the original way but in the other
[24:25] way now that
[24:26] part of adam had an open door and the
[24:30] devil went to the weaker vessel the one
[24:32] with the open door
[24:33] the one that was not fashioned after the
[24:36] original creation
[24:37] and began to work on that because he
[24:39] could not deceive adam
[24:40] but he could deceive the woman
[24:44] and the woman under deception opened the
[24:46] door and when she opened the door
[24:48] now adam was fallen because part of adam
[24:51] was now in a fallen condition
[24:52] and adam not being deceived amen he was
[24:55] not deceived
[24:56] he was not an unbeliever amen but he
[24:58] chose to disobey the commandment of god
[25:00] to go with his wife
[25:02] because she was already fallen and she
[25:04] was him
[25:06] so god had to open the door had god
[25:08] didn't open the door god had to have a
[25:10] door
[25:12] you understand that god had to have a
[25:13] door that could be open god couldn't
[25:15] open that door and remain just
[25:19] god couldn't make her with an open door
[25:22] god couldn't make her sinful
[25:24] but god made her with a door
[25:28] that she could open or she could keep
[25:30] closed
[25:32] it was her choice
[25:35] amen let's keep reading here
[25:42] he said oh don't you see it now
[25:46] in this view here the perversion of the
[25:49] church
[25:51] the original is the word
[25:55] the original is god's word amen
[25:58] and god's word was made flesh and dwelt
[26:00] among us and it was made after a spoken
[26:02] word fashion fashioned and
[26:03] a in a virgin womb god had created amen
[26:07] his own blood cell god had created
[26:09] everything that was needed it wasn't
[26:11] part of
[26:12] mary mary was only the incubator he said
[26:14] so god
[26:15] fashioned amen his word made flesh in
[26:19] jesus christ
[26:20] he fashioned his body that way and he
[26:22] came out and that body couldn't sin by
[26:24] deception or unbelief
[26:28] he couldn't sin by deception or unbelief
[26:31] but out of him was taking a byproduct
[26:34] and out of him came the ingredients for
[26:37] the church amen
[26:38] and that church was not fashioned in the
[26:40] original creation
[26:41] she was fashioned off of the original
[26:45] and it left a door
[26:48] it left a door in the bride of jesus
[26:51] christ
[26:51] and that door could be opened by their
[26:53] own choice
[26:55] and in the first age they begin to open
[26:57] the door
[26:59] and by the time we come to nicely we
[27:01] find out she's a fallen woman
[27:05] so brother man says now don't you see it
[27:08] don't you see it now
[27:10] the original is god's word there is no
[27:12] sin in god see what i mean
[27:14] here is a creature that come into
[27:16] existence by a perversion god is going
[27:18] to have a church
[27:19] but look at this perverted thing we got
[27:21] out here
[27:22] god has male and female but this woman
[27:25] see the very symptoms if it shows back
[27:27] what is god's mind
[27:29] he could take we could take an hour or
[27:31] two and break that down
[27:33] she made this creature for for that way
[27:35] he made the creature and
[27:37] turned her so satan could get a hold of
[27:39] her
[27:40] and he did he was still got her she had
[27:43] better flee to the cross like a man too
[27:46] notice all nature runs in continuity if
[27:49] he'd have had the woman in the same
[27:51] original creation
[27:52] there'd have been no sin because she
[27:55] couldn't have done it
[27:56] she couldn't have done it she is a
[27:58] perversion of the original creation
[28:02] these things brother branham saying
[28:03] there are very strong statements
[28:06] but you'll find it's absolutely the
[28:09] truth
[28:10] in the invisible union of the bride of
[28:12] christ he says when you see the woman
[28:14] a byproduct not another female like her
[28:18] so he's going back to the recreation and
[28:19] say there was no other female creation
[28:21] made the way she was made
[28:23] that's the bible she was made different
[28:26] than all the others
[28:29] said not another female like her made in
[28:31] that order knowing
[28:32] that she could be deceived god knowed
[28:36] if he didn't know the end from the
[28:37] beginning then he wasn't god
[28:40] if he isn't infinite he can he can't be
[28:42] infinite without being omniscient
[28:44] omnipresent knowing all things eternal
[28:47] so he knowed all things and he had to
[28:49] make that woman
[28:50] the man didn't have a wife the wife and
[28:53] the man was the same thing
[28:55] he had the feminist masking spirit in
[28:56] himself he had to separate
[28:59] take a byproduct after the whole
[29:00] creation was made
[29:02] no female created by god and the
[29:04] original creation can do a thing like
[29:05] that
[29:06] she was made thus to do it he knowed she
[29:08] would do it
[29:09] if he didn't he wasn't god
[29:12] but we but see listen to this paragraph
[29:17] but see that the attributes that's in
[29:21] god
[29:21] had to be displayed
[29:26] he was to be a savior and to make
[29:29] everything perfect the way he did it
[29:31] then there could be nothing lost oh
[29:33] don't be children
[29:34] be men and women we're at the end of the
[29:36] road
[29:38] brother ben said listen if god had made
[29:40] her the original way made everything
[29:42] amen it couldn't come into a perversion
[29:44] now the attributes of god is savor and
[29:46] healer and deliver
[29:47] it could never be expressed but there
[29:48] was attributes of god that had to be
[29:50] expressed
[29:51] and they were expressed in the mind of
[29:52] god before the foundation of the world
[29:54] when the lamb was slain and your name
[29:56] was put on the book of redemption
[29:59] so god in order to display all of his
[30:01] attributes
[30:02] he can't he looks at all of creation
[30:04] amen and it's all made in the same
[30:06] fashion where's the open door going to
[30:08] be
[30:08] amen in the open door was in adam in his
[30:12] sign
[30:12] he was going to pull off of the original
[30:14] and make another creation off of the
[30:16] original
[30:17] and he had never made anything in
[30:19] creation this way yet
[30:22] and so where does the serpent go amen he
[30:25] goes
[30:25] right to that that was fashioned
[30:27] differently
[30:30] why because god had a plan of redemption
[30:34] and now he created amen a weaker vessel
[30:38] and then that weaker vessel fashioned
[30:40] differently than adam was in a different
[30:41] way than all other women
[30:43] she was made in a way that there was a
[30:44] weakness implanted in her
[30:49] there was a weakness implanted in her
[30:51] that could be expressed if she chose to
[30:54] express it
[30:55] that could be open if she chose to open
[30:57] it and so then you realize
[31:00] this is the part that just thrills my
[31:02] heart if you can just catch this
[31:03] you'll never be sorry for a weaker
[31:05] vessel and after this there won't be a
[31:07] woman in this building that's not
[31:08] thankful that god's fashion into the way
[31:10] she's fashioned
[31:12] because the key the key
[31:15] to redemption the key to the expression
[31:18] of god
[31:18] laid in the woman the woman was the key
[31:23] that unlocked the mystery of redemption
[31:26] she was the key
[31:27] that unlocked the attributes of god
[31:30] being on display
[31:31] because without the fall you don't know
[31:33] a savior you don't know a healer you
[31:35] don't know a deliverer
[31:37] there's so much of god that cannot be
[31:39] expressed so the key to the full
[31:41] expression of god
[31:42] was the woman she was fashioned
[31:45] because of the because the the the the
[31:48] redemption
[31:49] the sealing and unsealing of the book
[31:51] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[31:52] the world
[31:53] god as a savior god is a healer god is a
[31:56] deliverer
[31:57] it was all locked up and bound up
[32:02] is that true it was all locked up
[32:05] and bound up in order for that to be
[32:08] expressed there had to be a fall
[32:10] but god cannot make anything fallen
[32:14] he can't make it corrupted
[32:18] he can't make it fallen he can only make
[32:20] it
[32:21] with the ability to be corrupted but he
[32:24] can't make it corrupted
[32:28] so he made a byproduct
[32:32] not because he hated woman but she was
[32:34] going to become the tool in his hand
[32:38] and that weaker vessel would become the
[32:39] tool in god's hand
[32:41] that would unlock the mystery of
[32:43] redemption
[32:47] that's why god is going to take the very
[32:50] same tool to finish the mystery of
[32:53] redemption
[32:55] amen he had to have the weaker vessel
[32:58] the weaker vessel is attached to
[33:00] redemption amen
[33:01] so the serpent came to her the devil
[33:03] through the serpent
[33:04] and and to deceive amen so that she
[33:07] could
[33:07] unlock amen all the attributes that were
[33:11] in god
[33:11] and now god could step on the scene he
[33:13] could be a heavenly father
[33:15] he could be a redeemer he could be a
[33:17] healer he could be a deliverer he could
[33:19] be a comforter he could be
[33:20] all that he ever intended to be because
[33:23] of the weaker vessel
[33:27] but because god fashioned her so and god
[33:30] foreordained for
[33:31] new and for knowledge knew it would be
[33:33] this way he also chose the very
[33:35] same vessel to continue the work of
[33:38] redemption
[33:38] all the way down to the finished mark
[33:40] it's the weaker vessel that he's going
[33:42] to use
[33:44] the weaker vessel is attached to
[33:45] redemption
[33:48] hallelujah now husbands dwell with wives
[33:51] according to knowledge
[33:52] giving honor unto the weaker vessel
[33:55] because this is the vessel god is using
[33:57] for redemption
[34:00] it's not a shame to be a weaker vessel
[34:03] it's only a shame if you keep letting
[34:04] satan open the door
[34:10] it can be a shame but it's not a shame
[34:13] it can be corrupted but it doesn't have
[34:15] to be
[34:19] see satan saw an opening
[34:23] something that god did differently
[34:26] and he goes down into the serpent
[34:29] through the serpent he begins to
[34:31] subtility to begin to speak to her
[34:34] because the devil is always looking for
[34:36] weakness
[34:38] what's he doing in you is he looking for
[34:40] your strength and looking for your
[34:41] weakness he's always looking for
[34:42] weakness
[34:43] he's always looking for the crack the
[34:45] way that he can get in the way that
[34:47] where he can find the the way to disrupt
[34:50] god's plan
[34:51] and he began to converse with the woman
[34:52] until he found out that the woman wasn't
[34:55] so sure about the word i mean she was
[34:56] messing up the the words a little bit
[35:00] adding to just a little bit not exactly
[35:02] what was said but
[35:05] and he begins to explore this avenue and
[35:07] he finds there's a door here that can be
[35:10] open
[35:11] and he works on that door until the
[35:14] woman of her own free choice opens the
[35:15] door
[35:17] brother said god knew it would happen he
[35:20] couldn't make it happen
[35:22] and remain just he couldn't force it to
[35:23] happen and remain just but he knew it
[35:25] would happen
[35:27] and so that's why she was made that way
[35:32] let's go to genesis 33.
[35:48] i'm sorry i didn't have my bifocals in
[35:51] the right spot
[35:53] genesis 3.
[35:59] getting old is embarrassing
[36:03] and i've just gotten started genesis
[36:06] chapter 3 verse 13.
[36:09] if you get your bifocal sideways it
[36:11] erases the one and you have three and
[36:12] three together
[36:15] genesis chapter 3 verse 13
[36:20] and the lord god said unto the woman
[36:22] what is this that thou has done
[36:24] and the woman said the serpent beguiled
[36:26] me and i did eat
[36:28] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[36:30] because thou hast done this thou art
[36:32] cursed above all cattle and above every
[36:33] beast of the field
[36:35] upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus
[36:37] shalt thou eat
[36:38] all the days of thy life and i will put
[36:41] enmity
[36:42] between thee and the woman and between
[36:44] thy seed
[36:45] and her seed it shall bruise thy head
[36:48] and thou shalt bruise his heel
[36:51] now god comes right back and says this
[36:54] very woman that you used
[36:57] this very woman that you used
[37:01] is going to bring forth the seed that
[37:02] will be your destruction that will
[37:04] bruise your head that will crush and
[37:05] destroy
[37:06] you used her because i made her in a way
[37:09] that she could open the door you
[37:10] exploited that
[37:12] and you used it for your own gain now
[37:14] you're a curse
[37:15] now you're no longer going to be a
[37:17] mighty beast and more subtle than all
[37:18] the beats of the field
[37:19] amen you're going to be cast down to the
[37:21] ground amen and the very
[37:23] the very vessel that you use to bring
[37:26] this fall
[37:27] is the very vessel that's going to bring
[37:29] forth the promised seed of redemption
[37:30] that is going to bruise your head
[37:36] because god is going to use the weaker
[37:39] vessel
[37:40] for redemption there's a mystery laying
[37:43] in the weaker vessel in the weaker
[37:45] vessel
[37:45] the mystery of the weaker vessel is the
[37:47] mystery of redemption
[37:50] let's go to isaiah 7.
[38:03] isaiah 7 and 14
[38:12] therefore the lord himself shall give
[38:14] you a sign
[38:15] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[38:18] a son
[38:19] and shall call his name emmanuel
[38:22] this is the coming forth of that seed of
[38:24] the woman amen that is going to bruise
[38:26] his head
[38:27] let's go to luke chapter 1.
[38:41] luke chapter 1 verse 26.
[38:50] and in the sixth month the angel gabriel
[38:51] was sent from god
[38:53] unto a city of galilee named nazareth to
[38:55] a virgin a spouse to a man whose name
[38:57] was joseph
[38:58] of the house of david and the virgin's
[39:00] name was mary
[39:02] and the angel came in unto her and said
[39:04] hail thou that are highly favored
[39:07] the lord is with thee blessed art thou
[39:09] among women
[39:10] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[39:12] the saying and cast in her mind
[39:14] what manner of salutation this should be
[39:16] and the angel said unto her fear not
[39:18] mary for thou hast found favor with god
[39:20] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[39:22] womb and bring forth a son and shalt
[39:24] call his name
[39:25] jesus he shall be great and shall be
[39:28] called the son of the highest and the
[39:30] lord god shall give unto him the throne
[39:32] of his father david
[39:34] and he shall reign over the house of
[39:35] jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[39:37] shall be no
[39:38] end then said mary unto the angel how
[39:41] shall this be seeing i know not a man
[39:43] and the angel answered and said unto her
[39:45] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[39:46] and the power of the highest shall
[39:48] overshadow thee there
[39:50] therefore also that holy thing which
[39:52] shall be born of thee
[39:53] shall be called the son of god and
[39:56] behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath
[39:57] also conceived a son in her old age
[40:00] and this is the sixth month with her who
[40:02] was called
[40:03] barren for with god nothing shall be
[40:05] impossible
[40:07] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[40:09] lord
[40:10] be it unto me according to thy word and
[40:12] the angel
[40:13] departed from her now the weaker vessel
[40:18] had had opened the door that brought a
[40:21] fall
[40:22] in an opening the door and brought a
[40:24] fall it would start a cycle of
[40:26] redemption
[40:27] that would that would display the
[40:29] attributes of god the plan of god from
[40:31] before the foundation of the world
[40:32] and the desire of god to reveal himself
[40:35] would now be set in motion by the woman
[40:37] amen but in order for god to have this
[40:40] plan of redemption before
[40:42] he had a lamb slain from before the
[40:44] foundation of the world
[40:45] and when god was going to bring that
[40:47] lamb forth on the earth
[40:48] amen because god's redemption is so
[40:50] complete the very tool that he uses for
[40:53] redemption he holds steady with that
[40:55] tool
[40:56] and it was the woman who caused the fall
[40:59] amen now he's going to come to a woman
[41:02] and that woman now will bring forth the
[41:04] seed the seed of the woman
[41:05] amen that will be the smiting stone
[41:08] that will be the the foot that bruises
[41:11] his head that will be the one
[41:12] that brings about the the redemption
[41:15] price being paid
[41:16] and so god now is coming to the weaker
[41:18] vessel and look at what a weak vessel he
[41:20] comes to
[41:22] when god chose to use the weaker vessel
[41:24] god was not going to all of a sudden
[41:26] change it and make it a strong vessel
[41:27] when he chose a weak vessel he choked a
[41:29] weast vessel
[41:31] and so when he comes to this woman he
[41:32] comes to a woman that has no ability to
[41:34] bring forth the promised word
[41:36] she's known no man she has no ability to
[41:38] do this in fact she's a young virgin
[41:40] girl
[41:41] amen tucked out of the way of the
[41:43] mainstream of the culture and society
[41:45] that way
[41:46] she's tucked back in nazareth which we
[41:49] know
[41:50] the bible says can any good thing come
[41:52] out of nazareth
[41:54] she was in a weak condition and not in
[41:57] jerusalem
[41:59] not in shiloh not and she wasn't in any
[42:03] place that you would expect to find her
[42:05] she wasn't able she didn't have capacity
[42:08] there was
[42:08] nothing that she could do because god is
[42:10] not looking for a strong vessel for
[42:12] redemption he's looking for a weak
[42:14] vessel
[42:16] and when god chose the weak vessel amen
[42:18] the devil thought because of weakness he
[42:20] can manipulate it
[42:21] but god chose a weak vessel that he can
[42:24] show the strength of his redemption
[42:26] through weakness so when he comes to the
[42:28] woman he doesn't come to a high priest
[42:30] daughter he doesn't come to somebody in
[42:31] jerusalem
[42:32] he doesn't go to the family of nobility
[42:34] he goes someplace where there's no
[42:36] ability whatsoever to have credibility
[42:39] to have support to have substance to
[42:41] have any way to even make this a logical
[42:44] story
[42:46] to make it so unbelievable amen to make
[42:49] it so impossible
[42:50] because when god chose a weaker vessel
[42:52] in the back part of his mind before the
[42:54] foundation of the world
[42:55] he said the weaker vessel is going to be
[42:57] linked to redemption
[42:58] all the way through he's going to use
[43:02] the woman
[43:03] the weaker vessel to bring redemption
[43:05] now it's no more ashamed to be a weaker
[43:07] vessel
[43:08] when mary was there she was weak she was
[43:10] incapable she had
[43:12] nothing on her side there was no way
[43:15] that she could fathom in her mind the
[43:17] fulfillment of isaiah 7 would be by her
[43:20] there was it was a ridiculous idea it
[43:22] was a foolish concept it was a notion
[43:24] she may have never entertained
[43:30] but yet she was the one because of her
[43:34] inability
[43:35] it made her perfect for a display of
[43:38] redemption
[43:41] so now he sends an angel to her and this
[43:43] angel messenger comes to her
[43:45] and begins to say you're highly favored
[43:47] of god my goodness she wasn't even
[43:49] highly favored of the people she lived
[43:52] with
[43:54] wasn't living in a favored place in a
[43:56] favored city in a favorite situation
[43:58] she wasn't highly favored in any other
[44:00] way but she was highly favored by god
[44:04] because he had a prophecy laying there
[44:05] then i'm going to take a weaker vessel
[44:07] with no ability
[44:09] in a condition that's impossible and i'm
[44:11] going to bring forth my promised seed
[44:18] brother branham says in the church age
[44:19] book out of the tyre and church age
[44:25] i think by the time we're done with this
[44:27] us men will be like
[44:29] man wish i was a woman
[44:34] because of what god has done with the
[44:36] woman we've seen what the devil has done
[44:38] with the woman
[44:39] we see the perversion we see the filth
[44:41] we see the fallen condition
[44:42] we saw when he began to manipulate the
[44:45] weakness in the woman what it has caused
[44:47] amen but god is also taking that same
[44:49] tool that the devil thinks he has all
[44:51] wrapped up
[44:52] and he's coming in the same way because
[44:54] the devil doesn't understand
[44:56] weakness he doesn't understand humility
[45:00] he doesn't understand weakness he only
[45:02] understands brightness wisdom perfection
[45:05] and strength
[45:06] he cannot fathom weakness he doesn't
[45:08] understand he is always tripped up by
[45:11] the weakness and humility of god
[45:15] so go out in the weaker vessel has you
[45:18] know
[45:19] it looked oh praise god it looked like
[45:23] when god fashioned her this way
[45:25] as a byproduct seemingly like an
[45:27] afterthought
[45:29] was she an afterthought she was the
[45:32] thought amen
[45:33] she was not an afterthought she was the
[45:35] finishing of the masterpiece
[45:37] she was the completion of the
[45:38] masterpiece she was not an afterthought
[45:40] she was the part of the main thought
[45:43] the main thought was not a frog or a
[45:45] horse the main thought was a man in his
[45:47] own image male and female the two
[45:49] becoming one
[45:50] that's the masterpiece he was working on
[45:52] from the beginning when volcanoes were
[45:54] erupting he was thinking of his
[45:55] masterpiece
[45:57] when grass started coming up amen and
[46:00] the sun
[46:00] and a cycle began to start to the earth
[46:02] amen and this
[46:03] and the sun began to traverse across the
[46:05] sky he was thinking of the finishing of
[46:07] his masterpiece
[46:09] the woman was in his mind amen when
[46:12] there was molten lava covering the earth
[46:17] when it was covered now in judgment and
[46:19] deep covered the earth and he's going to
[46:21] refashion it for his eden
[46:23] what's he thinking of he's thinking of
[46:25] that masterpiece image
[46:27] the seventh seal himself
[46:30] made flesh and manifest
[46:33] so it looks in the bible as if she's an
[46:36] afterthought
[46:38] but she's not an afterthought she's part
[46:42] of the mystery thought
[46:45] the hidden thought because
[46:49] because god he has thoughts
[46:53] and he has hidden thoughts
[46:57] he has seals and he has hidden seals
[47:01] he has written seals and unwritten seals
[47:07] god had a thought in that thought amen
[47:09] was the
[47:10] that manifest himself have something in
[47:12] his image upon the earth
[47:14] and that thought come into manifestation
[47:16] when adam was on the earth
[47:17] amen and it looked as if now god has an
[47:20] afterthought
[47:21] he looks down and he sees that adam is
[47:23] lonely and he needs a help meeting
[47:25] and okay i didn't think of this before
[47:27] so what can i do
[47:28] i'll start bringing up in my original
[47:31] form to try to find a help me
[47:33] this is no afterthought this is the
[47:35] expression of his main
[47:36] thought that's why he takes so much time
[47:39] on it that's why he's laying it down
[47:41] this is god expressing what his real
[47:43] desire
[47:44] what is real thought what his real
[47:46] purpose is
[47:50] so he makes what looks like an
[47:52] afterthought
[47:54] now remember the the satan is watching
[47:57] all of this
[48:00] male and female from the dust from the
[48:02] dust
[48:03] now adam and what is he doing
[48:06] it's different you think the devil
[48:08] didn't notice the difference
[48:12] seemingly an afterthought
[48:15] oh friends god has a way of pulling the
[48:18] devil right into his trap
[48:21] he's got a way through humility and
[48:23] simplicity
[48:25] he's got a way of going down low
[48:29] to pull the devil in because the devil
[48:31] can only think high thoughts he can't
[48:32] think low thoughts
[48:34] he can only think in intellectualism he
[48:36] can only think in reasoning and
[48:37] wisdoms and in beauty and intellect he
[48:39] cannot
[48:40] think through the humility of god and
[48:42] god reveals his humility
[48:44] amen by by revelation it's the only way
[48:46] to catch it not by intellectualism
[48:49] so it looks as if there's an
[48:51] afterthought here
[48:52] an afterthought then it looks as if
[48:55] though
[48:56] god as a father he's bringing a bunch of
[48:59] toys or presents to adam
[49:00] you know here's this and and here's this
[49:02] and adam's shaking his head no at each
[49:04] one of them
[49:07] oh praise god it's like what is he doing
[49:12] this is the next one and the next one
[49:13] and the next one adam's giving names but
[49:15] no suitable help meat is found and all
[49:18] of a sudden
[49:20] it's as if god was like
[49:23] that didn't work
[49:28] what do i do next
[49:31] what's he doing he's sucking lucifer
[49:34] right in
[49:36] because lucifer only understands perfect
[49:38] and brightness and wisdom and
[49:40] understanding and intellect and god is
[49:44] pulling him right into the trap
[49:48] and now he takes something out of adam
[49:52] he's not done this before this is
[49:53] different
[49:55] nothing else he tried worked
[49:59] he pulls it out and he fashions a
[50:02] separate vessel
[50:04] out of the piece that come off of adam
[50:07] and he made a woman and now he wakes up
[50:11] at and he brings the two together and he
[50:12] performs the first marriage that was
[50:14] ever produced
[50:15] ever performed in the garden of eden and
[50:18] made the 2-1
[50:19] and adam began to rejoice and said this
[50:21] is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone
[50:23] and then so now they begin to live their
[50:25] happy life in the garden
[50:27] and the serpent you know the serpent is
[50:30] always trying to disrupt god's plan
[50:32] because the serpent's trying to usurp
[50:33] his authority over god
[50:35] to take god's kingdom and make it for
[50:37] his own
[50:38] that's his works that's what he's doing
[50:40] so he's trying to penetrate to the
[50:42] garden of eden
[50:43] and he's trying to take what god made
[50:45] for his own pleasure
[50:46] and he's trying to take it unto himself
[50:48] and so now
[50:50] who knows where he probed i don't know
[50:51] where he probed and where he poked and
[50:53] where he looked and what he did
[50:55] but he finally come to this byproduct
[50:59] and he found there a weaker vessel
[51:04] and the devil began to exploit that
[51:06] weaker vessel
[51:07] and brought a fall
[51:11] so what do you think the devil thinks
[51:13] now
[51:15] god messed up he should have stuck with
[51:18] his original
[51:20] he doesn't know this is in his original
[51:22] mind
[51:24] this is an original thought
[51:28] it wasn't part of the original creation
[51:29] but it was part of the original
[51:31] thought and so now
[51:34] he now he has attached himself to the
[51:38] woman
[51:38] the devil has attached himself to the
[51:40] weaker vessel as the mechanism that
[51:43] he will use to bring his eden
[51:47] he's done it all through the woman
[51:50] he he is moved and manipulated amen and
[51:53] he began to use this woman for deception
[51:56] amen and now when you get to genesis
[51:57] chapter six you see the sons of god saw
[52:00] the daughters of men that they were fair
[52:01] they took them to his wives
[52:02] amen it was bringing a collapse to the
[52:04] system of god then god would bring a
[52:06] judgment to free his children from them
[52:09] and then afterwards the serpent goes
[52:11] right back to work and he begins working
[52:13] through the women
[52:15] and he comes down and and he begins to
[52:18] work
[52:19] on sarah and sarah
[52:22] there's a prophecy now that abraham's
[52:24] going to have a son so he begins to work
[52:26] on sarah
[52:27] and now sarah the weaker vessel gets a
[52:29] concept
[52:30] that now we can take hagar
[52:35] through intellectualism through
[52:36] reasoning and understanding
[52:38] she knows that it's legal amen she can
[52:40] now do this and her reasoning tells her
[52:42] god
[52:42] has left off me god is he's held
[52:45] withheld children from me
[52:47] so this is the only way so through
[52:50] reasoning and intellect and wisdom
[52:52] she begins she becomes deceived by the
[52:54] devil to
[52:55] thinking this is the only way for the
[52:57] promise to come to pass
[52:59] and she takes hagar and offers it to
[53:01] abraham abraham accepts they bring forth
[53:03] an ishmael amen what was that
[53:05] it was the devil exploiting the weakness
[53:09] of the woman
[53:12] the children of israel when they're
[53:14] coming in the exodus journey amen they
[53:16] now come to moab to the border of moab
[53:18] and what was it that he used to entice
[53:21] the the sons of god
[53:22] he used the daughters of moab the
[53:24] beautiful enticing daughters of moab to
[53:26] trap them at the feast of baal pior
[53:29] what's he doing this this woman
[53:32] this weaker vessel the devil has now
[53:35] taken for his
[53:36] own tool of destruction his own tool of
[53:39] breaking god's word
[53:41] his own tool of tearing down the things
[53:44] of god
[53:44] so that he can build his own
[53:46] civilization
[53:47] he can build his own empire his own eden
[53:54] and he doesn't know that it's the trap
[53:57] that god set before the foundation of
[53:59] the world
[54:01] it looks like he's having success
[54:05] it looks like it's working but all i
[54:08] want to say is it's working
[54:10] perfectly according to god's plan
[54:14] in the thytire and church age out of the
[54:17] church age book
[54:18] brother brahm said sid let us go back to
[54:20] the beginning
[54:21] in the original physical creation as we
[54:23] know it today
[54:25] god made everything in pairs male and
[54:27] female there were two chickens rooster
[54:29] and hen there were two cattle
[54:30] the cow and the bull and right down the
[54:32] line but when it come to a man there was
[54:34] only one
[54:36] they were not a pair adam had been made
[54:39] in the image of god he was a son of god
[54:41] as a son of god he could not be tempted
[54:43] and fall
[54:45] that would be impossible so god took a
[54:47] byproduct of a man to cause
[54:50] the fall woman never stepped fresh from
[54:53] the hand of god as a true product of god
[54:56] she was produced from man and when when
[54:59] god
[54:59] caused her to be brought forth from man
[55:01] she was vastly different from the other
[55:03] females he had created
[55:04] she was able to be seduced no other
[55:07] female creation can be immoral but the
[55:09] human female may be touched at almost
[55:11] any time
[55:13] and that weakness in her allowed satan
[55:16] to seduce her by way of the serpent
[55:18] and has brought the woman to a very
[55:20] peculiar position before god and his
[55:23] word
[55:24] catch this position of the weaker vessel
[55:27] she is the type of all things vulgar
[55:30] foul and loathsome on the one hand and
[55:32] on the other hand she is the type of all
[55:34] things clean and beautiful
[55:36] and holy as the receptacle of the spirit
[55:38] and the blessings of god
[55:40] on the one hand she is called the
[55:41] who is drunk with the wine of her
[55:42] fornication
[55:43] fornications on the other she is called
[55:45] the bride of christ on the one hand she
[55:48] is called mystery babylon the
[55:50] abomination before god
[55:51] and on the other hand she is called new
[55:52] jerusalem our mother
[55:54] on the one hand she is so foul and
[55:56] wicked and lewd that she is summarily
[55:58] cast into the lake of fire
[55:59] as the only place for her and on the
[56:02] other hand she is exalted to heaven
[56:05] sharing the very throne of god as the
[56:07] only place befitting such a queen
[56:11] what queen the weaker vessel
[56:15] god's design god's plan
[56:21] first corinthians let's turn to first
[56:22] corinthians chapter one
[56:40] see this weaker vessel
[56:45] satan came in and found that there was
[56:47] something exploitable here
[56:50] he began to exploit it for his own lusts
[56:52] his own desires
[56:54] and as he exploited he continued to
[56:56] exploit until we
[56:58] we find that that when christ was
[57:00] smitten
[57:01] out of him was taking the agreements for
[57:03] the bride and the bride was born at
[57:05] pentecost but
[57:06] then the devil goes right back to the
[57:08] same thing he always goes to he goes
[57:09] right back to the woman he goes right
[57:11] back to the church
[57:12] and then the church amen began to flirt
[57:14] around the church
[57:15] began to take in other seed the church
[57:18] began to produce
[57:20] a hybrid product and the church
[57:23] became the mechanism by which he
[57:25] deceived the sons of god for seven
[57:27] church ages the same pattern
[57:31] the same thing is what's upheld
[57:36] it says in first corinthians 1 25
[57:41] because the foolishness of god is wiser
[57:43] than men
[57:44] and the weakness of god is stronger than
[57:47] men
[57:48] for you see your calling brother and how
[57:50] that not many wise men after the flesh
[57:52] not many mighty
[57:53] not many noble are called
[57:56] but god has chosen the foolish things of
[57:58] the world to confound the wise
[57:59] and god has chosen the weak things of
[58:02] the world to confound the things which
[58:03] are
[58:04] mighty and the bastings of the world and
[58:06] the things which are despised
[58:08] hath god chosen yea things which are not
[58:11] to bring to not
[58:12] things that are that no flesh should
[58:16] glory
[58:17] in his presence
[58:20] god decided to choose weakness
[58:24] to show his glory and his strength he
[58:26] chose the he chose nothing
[58:29] to bring to nothing things that are
[58:30] things that are not to bring to not
[58:32] things that are
[58:33] god has chosen the foolishness things to
[58:35] confound the wisdom god has chosen the
[58:36] weak to show his strength
[58:40] god is coming through the weaker vessel
[58:43] second corinthians chapter 12.
[58:54] second corinthians chapter 12 and verse
[58:56] 8
[59:00] for this thing i besought the lord
[59:01] thrice that it might depart from me and
[59:03] he said unto me my grace is sufficient
[59:05] for thee for my strength is made perfect
[59:08] in weakness most gladly therefore will i
[59:11] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[59:13] power of christ
[59:14] may rest upon me therefore i take
[59:16] pleasure in infirmities and reproaches
[59:19] and necessities and persecutions
[59:21] in distress for christ's sake for when i
[59:23] am weak
[59:24] then am i strong
[59:30] my strength is made perfect
[59:33] in weakness so god fashioned the woman
[59:38] the weaker vessel so that he could show
[59:40] his perfect strength
[59:43] what's the purpose of the woman what's
[59:45] the purpose of the weaker vessel
[59:47] so that god can show his strength god
[59:50] chose weakness he didn't make her
[59:54] weak because he despised her he made her
[59:57] weak because he had a great plan
[59:58] and she was the mechanism he could use
[1:00:01] to fulfill his great plan
[1:00:04] and the message the anointed ones at the
[1:00:06] end time
[1:00:07] he said now i want you to know this is
[1:00:09] sure and you that listen to this tape
[1:00:11] you might have thought today that i was
[1:00:13] trying to say that about myself being
[1:00:15] that i was packing this message
[1:00:17] i have no more to do with it than
[1:00:19] nothing
[1:00:21] no more than just a voice and my voice
[1:00:23] against my better judgment
[1:00:25] i wanted to be a trapper but it's the
[1:00:27] will of my father that i declared to do
[1:00:28] and determined to do
[1:00:30] i wasn't the one that appeared down on
[1:00:31] the river i was only standing there when
[1:00:33] he appeared
[1:00:34] i'm not the one that performs these
[1:00:36] things and foretells these things that
[1:00:37] happens as perfect as they are
[1:00:39] i'm only one that's near when he does it
[1:00:41] i was only a voice that he used to say
[1:00:43] it i wasn't
[1:00:44] it wasn't what i knew it's what i just
[1:00:46] surrendered myself to that he spoke
[1:00:48] through
[1:00:49] it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel
[1:00:51] oh no
[1:00:52] it was the manifestation of the son of
[1:00:54] man it wasn't the angel his message it
[1:00:56] was the mystery that god unfolded
[1:00:58] it's not a man it's god so brother
[1:01:01] is trying to show you it's not me i have
[1:01:04] nothing to do with this
[1:01:05] i am weak and when god chose his seventh
[1:01:08] angel amen so that he could declare his
[1:01:10] voice and reveal
[1:01:11] the mystery of god when god chose a
[1:01:14] vessel
[1:01:15] he chose the weakest thing that he could
[1:01:17] choose as far as christianity is
[1:01:19] concerned
[1:01:21] he took a man from the hills of kentucky
[1:01:24] with a seventh grade education
[1:01:25] and no christian teaching
[1:01:29] no fundamental sunday school teaching no
[1:01:32] understanding of the bible
[1:01:33] he had he had no support he had no
[1:01:36] fellowship
[1:01:37] he had no financial backing he had no
[1:01:39] seminary
[1:01:40] education he had nothing going for him
[1:01:44] but god wanted a weak vessel
[1:01:48] god didn't want a strong vessel god
[1:01:50] wanted a weak vessel so he
[1:01:52] bypassed the seminaries he bypassed the
[1:01:54] denominations
[1:01:55] he bypassed those with a high school
[1:01:56] diploma
[1:01:58] he bypassed the grammar he bypassed the
[1:02:01] finances
[1:02:02] he bypassed everything till he could get
[1:02:04] one of the weakest preachers
[1:02:06] that he could find as far as
[1:02:09] earthly things go the one who had poor
[1:02:12] grammar
[1:02:13] the one who had a sawdust florida's
[1:02:18] church
[1:02:20] the one who had no denominational tithes
[1:02:23] the one
[1:02:23] who was working full time just to
[1:02:26] support the church because the church
[1:02:27] couldn't support him
[1:02:31] and god chose that weakness
[1:02:34] to display his redemption plan
[1:02:39] god chose the weaker vessel
[1:02:43] god always chooses the weaker vessel
[1:02:48] when it was time to kill goliath who did
[1:02:50] he get
[1:02:53] saul who was head and shoulders above
[1:02:56] everybody else in israel who was the
[1:02:57] mighty warrior
[1:02:58] who who was able to take them to battle
[1:03:00] and fight amen
[1:03:01] he he was the strongest of israel and
[1:03:04] the strongest of israel was afraid and
[1:03:06] was rejected
[1:03:07] but he went to a boy a shepherd boy a
[1:03:10] a small brother said a runt
[1:03:16] a runt who is a shepherd boy making a
[1:03:19] delivery for his dad
[1:03:22] who is being chastised by his older
[1:03:23] brothers for being a naughty boy
[1:03:27] who is this little runt who his brothers
[1:03:29] are after him to show him all and he
[1:03:31] brought some cheese and some bread from
[1:03:33] his dad
[1:03:34] what is he he's the weak vessel that's
[1:03:37] god going to use to deliver you today
[1:03:41] see god is taking the nothings
[1:03:44] the those that are not to bring them not
[1:03:46] the things that are
[1:03:48] this is always god's plan
[1:03:52] he all the way back
[1:03:55] in the fall before the garden you know
[1:03:58] there was a fall before the garden
[1:04:01] there was a fall in heaven and in that
[1:04:03] heaven brother bam tells us
[1:04:05] that lucifer thought that he could build
[1:04:07] a greater kingdom than michael's
[1:04:10] humble kingdom
[1:04:14] you mean in heaven michael had a humble
[1:04:16] kingdom
[1:04:19] there was something in lucifer that he
[1:04:22] thought he could do better
[1:04:25] than what he saw there was a strength a
[1:04:28] wisdom a brightness and we know that he
[1:04:29] was deceived by his own brightness
[1:04:31] but he looked at the humility and he
[1:04:34] didn't
[1:04:34] understand that god's strength is buried
[1:04:38] under humility that there was the most
[1:04:42] powerful
[1:04:42] force that you have ever reckoned with
[1:04:45] is hidden in simplicity
[1:04:47] and in humility and in weakness god
[1:04:54] chose the base things
[1:04:57] brother branham preached he said when he
[1:04:59] said remember the sermon i preached when
[1:05:01] i left this church i preached on david
[1:05:02] going out to face goliath and i went as
[1:05:05] a david facing the great
[1:05:07] goliath of denominations
[1:05:11] because god chose the weak things
[1:05:15] all the way back in the garden of eden
[1:05:19] when the devil was going to bring a
[1:05:21] deception
[1:05:22] he chose the serpent
[1:05:26] what was the serpent he was the highest
[1:05:29] order of creation next to man
[1:05:31] he was handsome he was strong
[1:05:36] and he was intelligent
[1:05:39] he couldn't get to adam
[1:05:43] so he went to the next greatest thing
[1:05:45] that he could
[1:05:47] he went to the serpent because that's
[1:05:49] all he understands
[1:05:51] he only understands beauty strength and
[1:05:54] intelligence
[1:05:56] so when he was going to bring the
[1:05:57] deception against the weaker vessel
[1:05:59] he went and found the strongest tool
[1:06:01] that he could use
[1:06:04] and he brought that too when he came in
[1:06:05] that tool the serpent to try to exploit
[1:06:08] the weakness that was in the woman
[1:06:09] and through the serpent he was able to
[1:06:11] exploit the weakness
[1:06:13] and there was a fall and they were in a
[1:06:15] fallen condition and now god comes down
[1:06:17] and he judges this condition
[1:06:18] but god is going to restore fellowship
[1:06:21] so what kind of animal does god choose
[1:06:23] to restore fellowship
[1:06:26] he chooses the weakest of the beast he
[1:06:28] takes a lamb
[1:06:31] the serpent the the devil took the
[1:06:33] serpent but god took the lamb the one
[1:06:35] that couldn't defend itself the one that
[1:06:37] was weak
[1:06:38] the one that was incapable the one that
[1:06:39] had no strength the one that needed to
[1:06:41] be led
[1:06:42] he took the very weakest of the beast
[1:06:45] satan took the greatest of the beast
[1:06:47] god took the weakest of the beasts
[1:06:50] and god is always displaying his
[1:06:52] strength and his redemption and his
[1:06:54] reconciliation
[1:06:55] through weakness so he takes the weakest
[1:06:58] of the beasts of the field he takes
[1:07:00] a lamb and he takes that lamb and sheds
[1:07:02] his blood and all the lamb has to do to
[1:07:04] be part of god's great redemption plan
[1:07:07] is surrender his life into the hand of
[1:07:09] the master
[1:07:10] and when he surrenders his life into the
[1:07:12] hand of the master now that blood
[1:07:14] becomes the blood of an innocent one
[1:07:16] shed to atone for the lost children to
[1:07:19] bring back a fellowship
[1:07:20] and to provide a covering
[1:07:23] god didn't need any strength god needed
[1:07:26] weakness and he needed a surrender
[1:07:30] and today god doesn't need a strong
[1:07:32] church god needs a weak church
[1:07:38] i'll prove that to you by what the
[1:07:39] prophet said we're always going to be
[1:07:41] strong a strong
[1:07:42] church a strong ministry a strongness a
[1:07:45] strong net
[1:07:46] that listen that's the tool that the
[1:07:48] devil use we don't want strength we want
[1:07:49] weakness
[1:07:50] we want a bunch of people who have no
[1:07:52] idea what to do next
[1:07:54] we want a bunch of people that have no
[1:07:55] concept of what's going to happen next
[1:07:57] or to get how to get ourselves out of
[1:07:58] trouble
[1:07:59] or how to solve the next problem
[1:08:02] you just want a people that'll say
[1:08:04] whatever the word says amen when it
[1:08:05] comes time god will show it out of the
[1:08:07] word i'll take the word that's my head
[1:08:08] ship that's my husband that's the leader
[1:08:10] that i follow
[1:08:11] i can't use my mind i can't use my
[1:08:13] history i can't use my training
[1:08:15] all i can use is this word i have to
[1:08:17] follow the shepherd because i'm a sheep
[1:08:20] [Music]
[1:08:22] god doesn't want us to become strong and
[1:08:24] powerful
[1:08:26] and wise and beautiful
[1:08:30] he's looking for the beauty of character
[1:08:37] you know haman had a plan
[1:08:41] and the book of esther haymon had a plan
[1:08:43] to bring the demise of israel
[1:08:47] and god was going to bring a deliverance
[1:08:48] but he wasn't going to use
[1:08:50] a priest an educated man
[1:08:54] a soldier a warrior
[1:08:58] what was going to defeat haman he was
[1:09:00] going to be defeated by a woman
[1:09:04] and how is this woman going to defeat
[1:09:05] him not with her strength
[1:09:08] not with her intelligence how is she
[1:09:11] going to defeat haman
[1:09:12] how was haman defeated haman was
[1:09:14] defeated by her humility
[1:09:16] and her subjection and her reverence
[1:09:21] he was destroyed his plan was destroyed
[1:09:24] his children was destroyed and all of
[1:09:26] his health became a spoil
[1:09:28] for esther how what great strength did
[1:09:31] she use
[1:09:31] what great gifts did she use the only
[1:09:34] thing that she used was humility
[1:09:36] and reverence and submission and through
[1:09:40] humility
[1:09:41] and reverence and submission she
[1:09:43] defeated the entire plan of haman
[1:09:45] what was haman haman was the right-hand
[1:09:48] man of the king
[1:09:50] haman was the second in power haman was
[1:09:52] so
[1:09:53] powerful so tied in with the king that
[1:09:55] he could enter into the court of the
[1:09:57] king whenever he wanted
[1:09:59] esther didn't even think she could come
[1:10:03] you recognize esther didn't even know
[1:10:05] that she could come
[1:10:06] and then she says if the scepter's not
[1:10:08] extended unto me i'll be killed
[1:10:10] but there's no record of haman ever
[1:10:11] having a scepter extended to him
[1:10:13] there's no record haman just marches
[1:10:15] right in even when the king has been
[1:10:17] up in the night and they've been reading
[1:10:18] to him out of the book of of chronicles
[1:10:20] of the king and
[1:10:21] he remembers what mordecai had done for
[1:10:23] him amen haman just marches in and
[1:10:24] starts talking to him
[1:10:27] haman is in so good the king the king
[1:10:29] takes off his ring
[1:10:32] and he hands it to haman
[1:10:37] this is who the jews are dealing with
[1:10:40] takes us off his ring and he hands it to
[1:10:42] haman and says you seal it
[1:10:46] you write it and you seal it it'll be
[1:10:47] what you say
[1:10:49] with the king's seal
[1:10:52] and that become the death sentence for
[1:10:54] the jews
[1:10:57] but god had a little orphan girl
[1:11:02] she had no mommy no daddy she had a
[1:11:05] cousin who took her to raise her in
[1:11:06] mordecai
[1:11:07] she had no money she had no wealth she
[1:11:09] had no position yet nothing
[1:11:11] in fact her name was hadassah she's just
[1:11:12] a little myrtle plant
[1:11:14] nothing special just a common weed
[1:11:20] but god was going to take myrtle and
[1:11:22] turn her into a star
[1:11:24] because esther means star she could not
[1:11:27] put herself there
[1:11:29] she could not become that by effort
[1:11:31] there was nothing she
[1:11:32] could do to move from the myrtle from
[1:11:35] myrtle from hadassah from orphan girl
[1:11:37] amen orphan girl jew in a foreign land
[1:11:40] there's nothing she could do to become
[1:11:41] wife of the king
[1:11:43] queen queen of the there's nothing in
[1:11:45] her power she could do
[1:11:46] but god had her laying there he knew the
[1:11:49] heart of haman
[1:11:50] he knew what was going on there was a
[1:11:51] great warfare between the amalekites
[1:11:54] because haman was an amalekite in the
[1:11:56] jews and this was going to be the final
[1:11:58] blow to the amalekites
[1:12:00] and god knew it he'd do it from before
[1:12:02] the foundation of the world
[1:12:04] and so there's a vashti there and the
[1:12:05] vashti is strong
[1:12:07] and beautiful and powerful and wise so
[1:12:09] much so that she's lost humility and
[1:12:11] submission
[1:12:14] and she's rejected because of a lack of
[1:12:16] humility and submission
[1:12:18] she's cast out so now the king is
[1:12:21] looking for character
[1:12:23] so god is working out all the
[1:12:26] circumstances to get hadassah
[1:12:28] moved into the the king's chamber of the
[1:12:30] house of the women
[1:12:31] and there's a haggy eye there which is
[1:12:33] the prophet of the age which is going to
[1:12:34] begin to tell her the things that she
[1:12:36] needs to go and present herself to the
[1:12:38] king
[1:12:40] and what is going to bring her into the
[1:12:42] union with the king
[1:12:44] her submission her reverence for haggy
[1:12:48] eye
[1:12:50] and her humility because when it was her
[1:12:53] time to go
[1:12:54] she took nothing of her own thinking
[1:12:59] nothing of her own desire she only took
[1:13:02] what haggai required
[1:13:04] what he had appointed and when the king
[1:13:07] saw her
[1:13:08] fashioned after his desire he found the
[1:13:10] character he's looking for
[1:13:12] and he loved her above all the virgins
[1:13:14] and he took her to wife
[1:13:15] and now she becomes the wife but she has
[1:13:17] not lost her reverence
[1:13:19] her submission and her humility
[1:13:24] now a decree goes out from haman
[1:13:27] remember who haman is
[1:13:30] what are the jews going to do there's
[1:13:32] nothing they can do about it
[1:13:35] they can't amass an army they don't have
[1:13:37] a mighty warrior there's nothing that
[1:13:39] they can do
[1:13:40] but god has a weaker vessel
[1:13:45] that will stay weak
[1:13:48] and display his strength of redemption
[1:13:51] through her
[1:13:52] weakness
[1:13:56] so we know how the plan unfolds and we
[1:13:59] know but what she does she doesn't even
[1:14:01] know that she can go to the king she
[1:14:03] doesn't even know if she'll survive
[1:14:04] she tells mordech i pray we'll pray and
[1:14:06] fast if i die
[1:14:08] i die she's surrendering she's
[1:14:10] submitting
[1:14:11] and when she comes to the king she comes
[1:14:14] dressed in the royal peril he gave her
[1:14:15] she comes dressed the way he wants her
[1:14:17] dressed
[1:14:19] and she bows herself before the king and
[1:14:22] waits for the king to extend the scepter
[1:14:24] to receive her she doesn't march and she
[1:14:26] doesn't become bold amen
[1:14:28] when she comes in she comes reverently
[1:14:30] she comes
[1:14:31] reverently to the king and she doesn't
[1:14:32] just declare what her need is
[1:14:34] she says if it be pleasing to you and
[1:14:36] have i found favor in your sight come to
[1:14:38] a banquet of wine
[1:14:40] let me entertain you she doesn't just go
[1:14:43] in and say i want this and i want this
[1:14:44] and i want this and i want this
[1:14:47] she comes reverently in submission
[1:14:51] and with humility this is why brother
[1:14:55] branham said the way up is down
[1:14:57] not because he felt like saying it
[1:14:59] because the whole bible's written that
[1:15:00] way
[1:15:03] when brother brennan makes statements
[1:15:05] like this the way up is down if you want
[1:15:07] to see how big you can become see how
[1:15:08] little you can get
[1:15:09] amen all of these things the reason
[1:15:11] brother ben says that he doesn't have to
[1:15:12] quote you the scripture that says that
[1:15:14] the whole scripture says that from
[1:15:17] genesis to revelation that's what it's
[1:15:19] saying
[1:15:19] and when brother branham's preaching
[1:15:21] amen he doesn't have to give you bible
[1:15:23] references because the bible is his
[1:15:25] reference
[1:15:28] because he knows the author real well
[1:15:33] so now we know that haman is destroyed
[1:15:36] the jews are set free
[1:15:38] all because there was a weaker vessel
[1:15:42] who would allow god to use her in
[1:15:45] her weakness she didn't have to become
[1:15:48] strong
[1:15:49] she didn't have to become powerful she
[1:15:51] didn't have to become smart all she had
[1:15:52] to do is stay the way god made her
[1:15:54] in the position that god put her and
[1:15:57] being what she was with the character
[1:15:59] she had in the position god
[1:16:01] brought her in brought the victory haman
[1:16:04] was destroyed
[1:16:06] i'm telling you there's a haman that's
[1:16:07] laid a trap in this day and he's going
[1:16:09] to hang on his own gallows
[1:16:11] but he's not going to hang on his own
[1:16:13] galas because there's a proud
[1:16:14] arrogant self-sufficient bride on this
[1:16:17] earth
[1:16:18] who makes bold boasts and bold claims
[1:16:20] and claims that
[1:16:21] she's got this power she's got this
[1:16:22] story she's got that the only thing she
[1:16:24] has is a position in that position she
[1:16:26] didn't get herself
[1:16:27] that position was given to her by the
[1:16:28] grace of god
[1:16:31] she didn't attain it by her wisdom and
[1:16:32] her intellect and her much study
[1:16:34] and her wisdom and character to be able
[1:16:36] to understand the bible
[1:16:37] she was brought into this position
[1:16:39] because she could humble herself to the
[1:16:41] word
[1:16:41] she could reverence god's gift she could
[1:16:43] submit to the authority that's over her
[1:16:47] whenever you see that arrogant attitude
[1:16:49] slip into the bride you're looking at
[1:16:51] bashti
[1:16:55] i say god help us stay weak
[1:16:59] help us stay humble it's not wrong to
[1:17:03] have confidence in your position you can
[1:17:04] have confidence in your position
[1:17:06] and over time amen the king brought
[1:17:09] esther into a confidence and his love
[1:17:11] for her
[1:17:11] he brought into a confidence of her
[1:17:12] position but she never forsook her
[1:17:15] reverence
[1:17:16] and her submission in her humility
[1:17:22] when god was going to bring his lamb
[1:17:30] god chose redemption through a lamb when
[1:17:33] he's going to bring his lamb
[1:17:35] he was he was the seed of david he was
[1:17:39] the lion of the tribe of judah but in
[1:17:42] what form did he come
[1:17:43] he come in the form of a lamb he come in
[1:17:46] the form of a man and when jesus christ
[1:17:48] came
[1:17:49] he came in weakness brother branham said
[1:17:51] i saw him he said when i saw him in the
[1:17:53] sagebroom field he said he was a little
[1:17:56] man
[1:17:58] wasn't big and powerful amen
[1:18:02] let's let's turn and look at this in
[1:18:03] john 14.
[1:18:16] john 14 and 9
[1:18:24] jesus saith unto him philip asked let's
[1:18:27] go to verse 8 philip sayeth unto him
[1:18:28] lord show us the father and it suffices
[1:18:30] us jesus said in them have i been so
[1:18:32] long time with you
[1:18:34] and yet has thou not known me philip he
[1:18:37] that hath seen me had seen the father
[1:18:38] and how sayest thou
[1:18:40] then show us the father believeth thou
[1:18:42] not that i am in the father and the
[1:18:43] father and me
[1:18:44] the words that i speak unto you i speak
[1:18:46] not of myself
[1:18:48] but the father that dwelleth in me he
[1:18:50] doeth the works
[1:18:53] believe me that i am in the father and
[1:18:54] the father in me or else believe me for
[1:18:56] the very work's sake
[1:18:58] jesus did not even take credit for his
[1:19:01] own works
[1:19:05] when when god brought jesus christ on
[1:19:07] the scene
[1:19:09] he was humble submissive
[1:19:13] reverence to the father and that was his
[1:19:17] power
[1:19:18] when god was going to bring a son on
[1:19:20] earth and that son was going to become
[1:19:22] the lamb and he was going to take away
[1:19:24] the sins of the world
[1:19:25] he brought him in weakness and in
[1:19:28] humility
[1:19:30] he brought him through a virgin who
[1:19:33] nobody knew about
[1:19:34] he even would allow a nasty rumor to be
[1:19:37] told about him so that through his life
[1:19:38] he would have to contend with that rumor
[1:19:40] that he was illegitimately born
[1:19:43] he had him born to parents who were
[1:19:45] nobodies
[1:19:47] and and he didn't even grow up a stable
[1:19:50] childhood because he was born in
[1:19:51] bethlehem and when he was
[1:19:53] two or three years old he was taken down
[1:19:54] to egypt and then as he was a child he
[1:19:57] was
[1:19:57] brought back in uh to galilee and
[1:20:00] he he was moved about and tossed about
[1:20:02] him
[1:20:04] and what was he he was the lamb of god
[1:20:07] he was a manual god made flesh what kind
[1:20:09] of flesh
[1:20:10] not big not powerful not beautiful
[1:20:14] but submissive reverent humble
[1:20:18] weak let's turn to isaiah 53.
[1:20:27] see what the bible says about him
[1:20:35] isaiah 53
[1:20:42] who hath believed our report and to whom
[1:20:44] is the arm of the lord revealed
[1:20:46] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:20:47] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[1:20:49] ground
[1:20:50] he hath no form nor comeliness and when
[1:20:54] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[1:20:55] we should desire him
[1:20:58] he is despised and rejected of men
[1:21:01] a man of sorrows and acquainted with
[1:21:03] grief and we hid as it were our faces
[1:21:05] from him
[1:21:06] he was despised and we esteemed him
[1:21:09] not when god was going to come and flash
[1:21:12] he was going to come in a weak form
[1:21:15] does it mean he was weak nope he was
[1:21:17] fashioned in weakness
[1:21:20] but the power of god was going to be the
[1:21:22] strength
[1:21:24] matthew chapter 12. let's turn there
[1:21:27] next
[1:21:28] matthew 12 14.
[1:21:39] matthew 12 and 14 says then the
[1:21:41] pharisees
[1:21:42] went out and held a council against him
[1:21:44] how they might destroy him
[1:21:46] but when jesus knew it he would through
[1:21:48] himself from thence and great multitudes
[1:21:50] followed him and he healed them all
[1:21:52] and charged them that they should not
[1:21:53] make him known that it might be
[1:21:55] fulfilled which was spoken by isaias the
[1:21:57] prophet saying behold
[1:21:59] my servant whom i have chosen my beloved
[1:22:01] and whom my soul was well pleased
[1:22:03] i will put my spirit upon him and he
[1:22:05] shall show judgment to the gentiles
[1:22:07] he shall not strive nor cry
[1:22:11] neither shall any man hear his voice in
[1:22:12] the streets a bruised reed shall he not
[1:22:15] break
[1:22:15] in a smoking flack shall he not quench
[1:22:18] until he send forth judgment
[1:22:20] unto victory jesus
[1:22:23] wasn't boastful
[1:22:27] arrogant loud
[1:22:30] he didn't bulldoze his way through
[1:22:32] situations he didn't plow
[1:22:36] do you see his nature amen
[1:22:39] he wouldn't even break a bruised reed or
[1:22:42] quench a smoking flax
[1:22:45] he was tender humble
[1:22:49] submissive reverent to his father
[1:22:54] in second corinthians 13
[1:23:01] turn their second corinthians
[1:23:07] chapter 13
[1:23:13] and verse 4 for though he was crucified
[1:23:18] through weakness how was he crucified
[1:23:22] through weakness for though he was
[1:23:25] crucified through weakness yet he lived
[1:23:27] by the power of god
[1:23:29] for we also are weak in him but we shall
[1:23:31] live with him by the power of god toward
[1:23:33] you
[1:23:36] he was crucified through weakness
[1:23:38] remember
[1:23:39] weakness a weaker vessel is attached to
[1:23:42] god's plan of redemption
[1:23:43] and so christ compared to the pharisees
[1:23:46] and sadducees compared to the sanhedrin
[1:23:48] compared to the priest of the day he was
[1:23:50] in weakness
[1:23:52] he had no army he had no strength he had
[1:23:54] no education he had no backing
[1:23:56] he was just one man
[1:24:00] and and god is working his plan through
[1:24:02] the weaker vessel
[1:24:04] and now jesus comes in a fashion of
[1:24:06] weakness and through weakness on the
[1:24:07] cross
[1:24:08] amen you can see that that as he
[1:24:11] surrendered his life in
[1:24:13] in the garden of gethsemane he wrestled
[1:24:15] with his own flesh
[1:24:16] and he recently he rescinded his own
[1:24:19] ideas and he and he and he gave over to
[1:24:22] god
[1:24:23] all his own wants and all his own
[1:24:24] desires and he surrendered completely to
[1:24:27] god
[1:24:27] and god took that vessel and he had him
[1:24:30] arrested and everybody that claimed that
[1:24:32] they would defend him and fight for him
[1:24:33] were gone
[1:24:34] now he's an absolute weakness
[1:24:37] he has nobody to stand with it nobody to
[1:24:39] testify on his behalf
[1:24:42] he stands alone they take him and they
[1:24:45] scourge him and they beat him
[1:24:46] until his ribs show through his back
[1:24:48] where they've taken so much flesh away
[1:24:50] in the beating and they take him to to
[1:24:53] carry his own cross to calvary
[1:24:55] and he's in such weakness that he
[1:24:56] doesn't have the strength to carry his
[1:24:58] cross
[1:24:58] so they summon somebody else to carry it
[1:25:00] for him what's he doing
[1:25:02] he's coming in utter weakness surrender
[1:25:05] to the father
[1:25:06] humility in the flesh amen he's coming
[1:25:09] stripped naked and beaten
[1:25:10] humble submissive reverent to his father
[1:25:13] and what's he doing
[1:25:14] he is going to drive the death blow to
[1:25:17] the devil
[1:25:19] what is it god working in simplicity god
[1:25:22] working in humility
[1:25:23] god working in weakness and you can see
[1:25:27] he's nailed to a cross blood dripping
[1:25:30] all from all parts of his body
[1:25:32] stripped naked and shamed before
[1:25:34] everybody and he's nailed to the cross
[1:25:36] amen and he's there in weakness
[1:25:41] and he's just got his eye cracked open
[1:25:45] waiting to see if he can lure the devil
[1:25:48] all the way in
[1:25:53] he set a trap nailed to the cross
[1:25:57] naked bleeding spit on cursed everybody
[1:26:00] else
[1:26:00] and he's the one laying the trap
[1:26:07] shortly the bee of death began to buzz
[1:26:09] around
[1:26:11] and this is what he was waiting for the
[1:26:15] scripture
[1:26:15] says if the princes of this world knew
[1:26:17] that he was the lord of glory they would
[1:26:18] have never allowed him to be crucified
[1:26:21] because it would tear down every one of
[1:26:23] their kingdoms and everything that
[1:26:24] anointed them
[1:26:25] would fight against it they didn't know
[1:26:27] because he came in such a way
[1:26:28] that it could even deceive the devil
[1:26:32] and that be of death which if the
[1:26:35] princess had
[1:26:36] known that he was the lord of glory they
[1:26:38] would have never let that be of death
[1:26:40] touch him but he came in such humility
[1:26:44] he came in such weakness they didn't
[1:26:46] believe that this could be the prophecy
[1:26:48] this can't be it it can't have come that
[1:26:51] way not through that women
[1:26:52] and woman not in that life not in that
[1:26:55] vessel there's no way that this is the
[1:26:56] plan
[1:26:57] so they felt sure of himself just to get
[1:26:58] rid of him because he's causing problems
[1:27:00] and he's laying there and the trap is
[1:27:02] set
[1:27:02] amen the the tripwire is almost sprung
[1:27:05] and all of a sudden
[1:27:06] here comes the sting of death the bee
[1:27:08] buzz buzz buzz
[1:27:10] and all of a sudden it plunged his
[1:27:11] stinger into him and he said
[1:27:13] i got you now and he pulled that stinger
[1:27:17] out
[1:27:17] and freed us from the fear of death
[1:27:20] how through strength strength through
[1:27:23] weakness friends
[1:27:27] that's why he chose the weaker vessel
[1:27:33] brother branham says in the message
[1:27:35] identification 1964 remember
[1:27:38] that was the very thing that turned
[1:27:40] judas to the popular amongst the rest of
[1:27:41] the ministers he sold him
[1:27:43] for 30 pieces of silver now why did he
[1:27:46] sell him
[1:27:47] brother ben will tell you
[1:27:51] he what made him turn he actually
[1:27:54] doubted the claims of christ being the
[1:27:56] word
[1:27:59] he could see that man now listen what
[1:28:02] was his attention drawn to the
[1:28:03] physical form of the man
[1:28:07] he could see that man eat with him
[1:28:10] fish with him out there and everything
[1:28:12] else and him being the word
[1:28:14] he couldn't believe it why
[1:28:17] because of the weakness of the human
[1:28:20] form
[1:28:22] he eat with him he fished with him he
[1:28:24] slept with him he saw him out there and
[1:28:26] he
[1:28:26] just couldn't believe that he was the
[1:28:29] word
[1:28:32] i want to read that again he actually
[1:28:34] doubted the claims of christ being the
[1:28:36] word he could see that man
[1:28:37] eat with him fish with him out there
[1:28:39] everything else and him being the word
[1:28:41] he couldn't believe it he couldn't
[1:28:43] believe he
[1:28:44] was god
[1:28:48] because he saw the man he ate with him
[1:28:50] and he fished with him
[1:28:51] and it was so humble and it was so
[1:28:55] weak that he just couldn't believe
[1:29:00] that he was god
[1:29:04] he couldn't believe he was god
[1:29:07] and he was judas's character caused him
[1:29:11] to do this
[1:29:12] has your character done the same
[1:29:14] remember judas was very religious
[1:29:17] judas saw the miracles judas was the
[1:29:19] treasure of the church
[1:29:20] judas went along amen with with
[1:29:23] everything he sought he believed the
[1:29:24] miracles
[1:29:25] he believed the miracles
[1:29:29] he believed he was in the boat when
[1:29:32] peter walked on the water he was in the
[1:29:34] boat when he said
[1:29:35] peace be still he believed he was a
[1:29:38] mighty man
[1:29:38] he believed he was a prophet he believed
[1:29:41] amen
[1:29:42] all the supernatural but he just
[1:29:44] couldn't believe that he was the word
[1:29:46] he just couldn't believe that that
[1:29:47] vessel there was god
[1:29:51] don't make the same mistake today just
[1:29:53] because he comes in the weak
[1:29:54] form of the bride
[1:29:58] humble submissive reverent
[1:30:02] nothing special in this world no special
[1:30:04] appointments
[1:30:05] no special features no special powers or
[1:30:07] strength she's just as humble as humble
[1:30:09] can be
[1:30:10] one from here one from there one from a
[1:30:12] broken home
[1:30:13] one from a denominational system one
[1:30:15] from a bad marriage
[1:30:19] one from a sinful life one from a
[1:30:21] religious life one from education one
[1:30:23] from no education he pulls them all
[1:30:25] together and what are they they're a
[1:30:26] hodgepodge ragtag of
[1:30:28] weakness displays of weakness from this
[1:30:31] whole earth
[1:30:31] the weakness here and the weakness there
[1:30:33] and the weakness there and he's pulled
[1:30:35] it all together to make his bride and
[1:30:36] she doesn't look like
[1:30:38] much in the eyes of the world she's got
[1:30:40] no strength no financial backing no
[1:30:42] denominational system
[1:30:43] no nobody to stand up for her
[1:30:48] don't mistake what she is
[1:30:52] don't say she's pretty nice she's just
[1:30:54] that don't mistake this she's the word
[1:30:56] or you'll fall like judas fell
[1:31:01] in 1964 the masterpiece he says
[1:31:04] now in closing in a few minutes i want
[1:31:06] you to notice real close something that
[1:31:08] just happened
[1:31:09] malachi 4 is to bring back back to the
[1:31:11] original
[1:31:12] she is smitten from the church
[1:31:18] she is smitten from the church from the
[1:31:20] church body smitten with her master
[1:31:23] for the same purpose she is the word
[1:31:29] there'll be judases who believe the
[1:31:30] miracles believe the supernatural
[1:31:32] saw the calming of the sea saul over
[1:31:34] that but they just
[1:31:35] can't go that far to believe that this
[1:31:37] man is the word
[1:31:39] these people are the word this is the
[1:31:42] manifestation
[1:31:43] of the mystery of god in this day i can
[1:31:45] see it all but
[1:31:48] you really
[1:31:54] smen from the church from the church
[1:31:56] body smitten with her master for the
[1:31:57] same purpose
[1:31:59] she is the word just the same as joseph
[1:32:01] was smitten from his brethren because he
[1:32:03] was the word
[1:32:04] and jesus was smitten from his brethren
[1:32:06] because he was the word
[1:32:08] the church is smitten the bride is
[1:32:10] smitten from the church
[1:32:12] because she is the word there's your
[1:32:15] stages again one two three
[1:32:17] the word living in an action the bible
[1:32:20] bride not some man-made bride the bible
[1:32:22] bride smitten
[1:32:23] and afflicted of god
[1:32:27] no beauty we should desire her what's he
[1:32:30] doing he's taking the prophecy out of
[1:32:32] isaiah 53
[1:32:34] and he's bringing it into bride form
[1:32:36] because the prophecy christ
[1:32:38] is now in bride form amen
[1:32:41] and you say that's not what the bible
[1:32:42] says it's what it said because it's
[1:32:44] referring to christ and christ is here
[1:32:48] no beauty we should desire her but yet
[1:32:51] we did
[1:32:52] esteem her smitten and afflicted of god
[1:32:56] that's right she stands alone
[1:32:59] she is smitten from all the
[1:33:00] denominations according to revelations 3
[1:33:05] catch this friends brother brenham says
[1:33:08] she
[1:33:08] is smitten from all the denominations
[1:33:12] according to revelations 3. what did
[1:33:15] revelations 3 say
[1:33:16] behold i stand at the door and not
[1:33:20] because christ the word was put outside
[1:33:22] the church
[1:33:23] and where is the word now what is the
[1:33:25] manifestation of the word
[1:33:26] the word is in bright form now and now
[1:33:30] brother branham is taking
[1:33:31] he's taking revelations chapter 3 in the
[1:33:34] laodicean church age and he's pinning
[1:33:36] it right upon the bride and saying she's
[1:33:39] rejected
[1:33:40] she is smitten she is cast out of the
[1:33:43] churches
[1:33:43] according to revelations chapter 3.
[1:33:48] she is smitten out of the laodicean
[1:33:50] churches that she was raised up in
[1:33:54] behold i stand at the door and knock
[1:33:59] if any man hear my voice
[1:34:04] and his voice is in his bride
[1:34:07] and she is the final voice to the final
[1:34:10] age
[1:34:10] amen and he says i'm knocking what's
[1:34:13] knocking the voice is knocking in this
[1:34:15] day
[1:34:15] and it's outside the church she has been
[1:34:17] put outside the church she has been
[1:34:19] smitten from the church
[1:34:20] because whatever he was she is
[1:34:24] there is no beauty we should desire him
[1:34:25] there's no beauty we should desire her
[1:34:27] he was smitten and cast out she is
[1:34:29] smitten and cast out he was meek and
[1:34:31] lowly she
[1:34:32] is meek and lowly
[1:34:39] praise god
[1:34:44] listen to what brother branham says in
[1:34:45] the message perfect strength by perfect
[1:34:47] weakness
[1:34:48] and i would encourage you to go listen
[1:34:49] to that from 1961
[1:34:51] perfect strength by perfect weakness
[1:34:55] so then if i should call it a text i'd
[1:34:57] like to use this of strength perfect
[1:35:00] strength by perfect weakness
[1:35:02] if we have weakness we have strength
[1:35:06] it's an unusual test in a pentecostal
[1:35:09] assembly to make take a test of weakness
[1:35:11] because we're always testifying we're so
[1:35:13] strong
[1:35:17] listen to what brother branham says
[1:35:18] friends
[1:35:21] listen to what he's saying an unusual
[1:35:24] text to take in a pentecostal assembly
[1:35:27] a text of weakness because we're always
[1:35:30] testifying we're so strong
[1:35:33] sounds like vashti to me
[1:35:37] so beautiful all the women are gathering
[1:35:40] around
[1:35:41] having a banquet of the women being
[1:35:42] admired
[1:35:47] she had no more submission and humility
[1:35:50] she began to get lifted up in her own
[1:35:52] eyes
[1:35:54] i would say she became deceived by her
[1:35:57] own brightness
[1:35:59] by her own glory she forgot who
[1:36:02] gave her her appointment and adornment
[1:36:06] and clothing and everything she had came
[1:36:07] from that king
[1:36:08] and she forgot it and she began to think
[1:36:10] that she was worthy of all of this
[1:36:12] herself
[1:36:15] and she was cast out and little hadassah
[1:36:19] was brought up to be the star
[1:36:23] because she could reverence the king she
[1:36:26] could submit to authority
[1:36:28] she could humble herself
[1:36:33] we're always testifying we're so strong
[1:36:37] further in perfect weakness he says
[1:36:39] there's so many of us
[1:36:41] likes to testify of our likes to think
[1:36:43] that we're insufficient
[1:36:45] we testify or likes to think that we're
[1:36:47] insufficient and therefore we
[1:36:49] make that an excuse
[1:36:52] i have no education i have no ability
[1:36:55] i'm
[1:36:56] unable to do this if you keep that up
[1:36:58] and do that and that way keep going like
[1:37:00] that then you can't mount to anything
[1:37:03] but the very thing that we make excuses
[1:37:05] by our weaknesses
[1:37:07] god uses that very thing to tackle the
[1:37:09] job with
[1:37:11] he waits for us to get to that condition
[1:37:15] so that he can use us
[1:37:18] what does he want he wants a weaker
[1:37:20] vessel
[1:37:23] we take the excuses and say well i can't
[1:37:25] do this i'm insufficient i can't do that
[1:37:27] and god
[1:37:27] takes that very thing to do the job with
[1:37:29] that's true
[1:37:30] that's the reason why he chooses us
[1:37:33] because we're
[1:37:34] in that condition what condition
[1:37:37] we can't do nothing that's the very
[1:37:40] reason
[1:37:41] he chooses us because we're in that
[1:37:43] condition
[1:37:44] what condition we can't do nothing
[1:37:46] that's the very reason he chooses us in
[1:37:48] that condition
[1:37:49] what's the condition we can't do nothing
[1:37:51] how many of you can't do nothing
[1:37:54] how many says i can't get anything right
[1:37:56] and everything i try i get it wrong
[1:37:58] praise god that's what he's looking for
[1:38:00] he's looking for a weaker vessel that he
[1:38:02] can bring about his redemption promise
[1:38:04] that he can bring his plan of redemption
[1:38:06] through the weaker vessel
[1:38:08] i say let's not try to be strong let's
[1:38:10] not try to get better let's not try to
[1:38:12] educate ourselves
[1:38:14] and get smarter let's just stay humble
[1:38:16] reverent
[1:38:17] submissive and let god show his strength
[1:38:19] through our weakness
[1:38:22] what's happening next in the world
[1:38:23] brother chad i have no idea
[1:38:27] what will this group do well without
[1:38:28] your group i don't know
[1:38:31] what should we do about this situation i
[1:38:33] don't know what should we do about this
[1:38:35] situation

[1:38:41] vaccines do you think they're
[1:38:42] this and one group says they're this and
[1:38:44] one group says they're this i have no
[1:38:46] idea what the vaccines are
[1:38:48] are they good maybe are they bad maybe
[1:38:51] will they kill us off possibly
[1:38:53] will they save the world i don't know
[1:38:57] why do you need to know
[1:39:01] why is it so important that you become
[1:39:03] wise
[1:39:05] figure out what's happening next and
[1:39:07] sort out
[1:39:08] what this group's going to do and what
[1:39:10] this group's going to do and
[1:39:13] i know who's going to be in the next
[1:39:14] election no you don't know who's going
[1:39:15] to be in the next election
[1:39:20] you understand what i'm saying we're
[1:39:22] always trying
[1:39:24] and god doesn't want that god wants
[1:39:27] somebody that says you know what i don't
[1:39:28] know and every time i've guessed in the
[1:39:30] past i've been wrong
[1:39:31] except that one time i got lucky in god
[1:39:33] and that makes me think maybe i can get
[1:39:34] it right again
[1:39:36] and we always talk about the one time we
[1:39:38] guessed it right and leave out the 10
[1:39:39] times we got it wrong and your wife is
[1:39:41] sitting there thinking
[1:39:46] is that right because there's something
[1:39:49] in humanity always wants to be strong
[1:39:51] but humans are weak they're fallen
[1:39:53] they're broken
[1:39:54] they're incapable of saving themselves
[1:39:56] the one that always gets in the way
[1:39:58] is you the one that's always standing in
[1:40:00] god's way is you the one that's your
[1:40:02] enemy is you the one that's messing up
[1:40:04] the plan is you so it's time to realize
[1:40:06] i am
[1:40:06] absolutely nothing without god i can do
[1:40:09] nothing i will never get this right
[1:40:11] the only thing i can do is lay myself
[1:40:13] down at his feet and say here i am lord
[1:40:19] we have to move away from every notion
[1:40:21] of strength
[1:40:23] he goes on to say he waits for us to get
[1:40:27] in that condition
[1:40:28] so that he can use us we take the
[1:40:30] excuses and say
[1:40:32] i can't do this i'm insufficient can't
[1:40:34] do that and god takes the very
[1:40:36] thing to do the job with that's the
[1:40:38] reason why i choose us because we're
[1:40:40] in that condition that sounds strange
[1:40:43] but just a few minutes we'll get to the
[1:40:45] reason of it
[1:40:45] god willing we find out just that we've
[1:40:48] been reading the weakness and rejection
[1:40:50] and we find out that those people who
[1:40:52] are the weakest
[1:40:53] and the rejected by the outside world is
[1:40:56] god's heroes
[1:40:57] that conquer up in the front lines take
[1:40:59] those who are
[1:41:00] feel themselves unworthy
[1:41:04] let's go to hebrews chapter 11.
[1:41:13] hebrews chapter 11 verse 32 this is an
[1:41:15] example what brother branham's talking
[1:41:17] about and the message perfect strength
[1:41:18] by perfect weakness
[1:41:23] he says in hebrews 11 32
[1:41:27] and what shall i more say for the time
[1:41:29] would fail me to tell of gideon
[1:41:32] and of barack and of samson and the
[1:41:34] jephthah of david also and samuel and of
[1:41:36] the prophets
[1:41:37] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[1:41:39] wrought righteousness
[1:41:40] obtained promises stop the mouths of
[1:41:43] lions
[1:41:44] quench the violence of fire escape the
[1:41:45] edge of the sword
[1:41:47] out of weakness were made strong
[1:41:50] waxed valiant in fight turned to flight
[1:41:52] the armies of the aliens
[1:41:53] women received their dead race to life
[1:41:55] again and others were tortured not
[1:41:57] accepting deliverance
[1:41:59] that they might obtain a better
[1:42:00] resurrection and others had trials of
[1:42:02] cruel mockings and scourging
[1:42:03] yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment
[1:42:06] they were stoned
[1:42:07] they were sawn asunder were tempted were
[1:42:09] slain with the sword
[1:42:11] they wondered about sheepskins and goat
[1:42:13] skins being destitute afflicted
[1:42:14] tormented
[1:42:16] of whom the world was not worthy they
[1:42:18] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[1:42:20] in dens of caves and of the earth
[1:42:22] and these all having obtained a good
[1:42:24] report through faith
[1:42:25] received not the promise god having
[1:42:28] provided some better thing for us
[1:42:30] that they without us should not be made
[1:42:32] perfect
[1:42:34] they through weakness were made strong
[1:42:38] they stopped the mouths of lions what
[1:42:41] the bible said
[1:42:43] how did daniel stop the mouths of lions
[1:42:47] he didn't he believed god
[1:42:51] and the faith that he had stopped the
[1:42:52] mouths of lions
[1:42:54] it was through his submission to god his
[1:42:57] surrender to god
[1:42:58] he would not surrender to the to the
[1:43:01] laws of the government he surrendered
[1:43:02] himself to god
[1:43:03] and through his humility and submission
[1:43:05] he never fought the order
[1:43:07] he never tried to come up with a a a
[1:43:09] pact or an alliance or an allegiance
[1:43:11] that would get him out of trouble if he
[1:43:13] should get caught praying
[1:43:14] he just honored god and prayed and he
[1:43:16] never disrespected or dis and honored
[1:43:18] the king through reverence and
[1:43:21] submission and humility
[1:43:23] amen god by his faith in god when he was
[1:43:25] cast into the lion
[1:43:27] lying in his face stopped the mouths of
[1:43:29] lions he had
[1:43:30] no physical ability to stop the mouths
[1:43:32] of those lions
[1:43:34] or quench the fire how did the three
[1:43:38] hebrew children they weren't children
[1:43:39] then but how did the three hebrew men
[1:43:41] how did they quench the fire they had no
[1:43:43] ability to quench the fire
[1:43:45] they just submitted to god and trusted
[1:43:47] in god every step of the way
[1:43:49] amen and their faith in god through
[1:43:52] submission
[1:43:53] humility and reverence amen when they
[1:43:55] were thrown into the fire the men that
[1:43:57] threw them in
[1:43:58] died amen but they didn't die how did
[1:44:00] they quench the fire
[1:44:02] they didn't quench the fire it was their
[1:44:04] submission to god
[1:44:05] it was their reverence and their
[1:44:06] humility before him they honored his
[1:44:08] word
[1:44:09] they stayed with his word and they were
[1:44:11] delivered
[1:44:13] through weakness were made strong their
[1:44:16] very weakness led them up there with no
[1:44:18] way to save themselves
[1:44:19] their very weakness and surrender to god
[1:44:21] gave them no hope of salvation amen
[1:44:24] but their faith was their hope their
[1:44:26] weakness was the path to victory
[1:44:30] when they were thrown in honoring god's
[1:44:32] word and submitting to god word and
[1:44:34] reverencing god and even the government
[1:44:38] you mean reverencing the government they
[1:44:40] said oh king lived forever
[1:44:43] they didn't disrespect him or spit at
[1:44:45] him or hiss or call him names
[1:44:47] o king live forever we cannot bow
[1:44:52] they were thrown in in submission and in
[1:44:55] reverence
[1:44:56] in humility and one of the greatest
[1:44:58] miracles that took place in the old
[1:45:00] testament took place through their
[1:45:01] weakness
[1:45:02] through their submission and reverence
[1:45:04] and humility they went in the fire
[1:45:06] and the king looked in and they weren't
[1:45:08] burnt they were up walking around
[1:45:10] all it did was burn their bonds all the
[1:45:12] bomb
[1:45:13] bombs that held them were burned off of
[1:45:15] them they were walking around and
[1:45:16] now there's a fourth man in the fire and
[1:45:19] the king says he looks
[1:45:20] like the son of god
[1:45:24] what did they do how did they get there
[1:45:27] what power that they have
[1:45:28] they had the power of faith
[1:45:32] not muscles not intellect not alliances
[1:45:35] not allegiances
[1:45:37] but just faith and that faith in the
[1:45:39] word of god would move them to humble
[1:45:41] themselves in the face of the word
[1:45:44] to reverence the word and the authority
[1:45:46] god put over him and subject himself to
[1:45:48] whatever
[1:45:49] they were subjected to to honor that
[1:45:51] word
[1:45:52] and in that they wrought a great victory
[1:45:55] and for thousands of years generations
[1:45:58] have take courage because of their
[1:45:59] actions
[1:46:00] but really what did they do what
[1:46:01] strength did they have what power did
[1:46:03] they
[1:46:04] it was the power of god when you get
[1:46:08] weak in yourself
[1:46:09] it brings the power of god on the scene
[1:46:12] when you can no more deliver yourself
[1:46:13] and god delivers you it brought the
[1:46:15] power of god on the scene
[1:46:16] when you honor his word when you
[1:46:18] reverence him and submit yourself
[1:46:20] under his hand it brings the mighty
[1:46:22] power of god and through weakness
[1:46:24] you're made strong
[1:46:30] brother goes on to say in perfect
[1:46:31] strength by perfect weakness notice
[1:46:34] that it takes the weakest and the
[1:46:36] rejected and practically every hero god
[1:46:38] ever had on the front line was that
[1:46:40] type of person a person that was
[1:46:42] rejected a person that thought he was
[1:46:44] insufficient
[1:46:45] a person that had no ability at all then
[1:46:48] that person
[1:46:49] just in good shape so god can start
[1:46:51] using them
[1:46:52] that's right when they feel like they
[1:46:54] can't
[1:46:55] they haven't got nothing that's when god
[1:46:58] can take a hold of them and do something
[1:46:59] with them
[1:47:00] but when we are thinking that we're able
[1:47:02] to do it then god can't use us because
[1:47:04] we're wanting to do it ourselves
[1:47:08] a couple paragraphs further he says the
[1:47:10] the important thing one of the important
[1:47:11] things that we must master
[1:47:14] now don't get tired on me catch this
[1:47:17] one of the important things that we must
[1:47:19] master
[1:47:20] now remember this especially you young
[1:47:23] preachers and lay members alike
[1:47:25] there's one thing that we've got to
[1:47:27] master if we expect to fulfill
[1:47:29] god's desire in our life that is we have
[1:47:31] to master the thought of human ability
[1:47:35] if we ever get to a spot where we think
[1:47:37] that we can do it with our own
[1:47:38] intelligence and our own abilities
[1:47:40] we've got to master that in such a way
[1:47:42] that we can get rid of that thing
[1:47:45] and lay it aside so that god can use us
[1:47:48] that's right and make a complete
[1:47:51] surrender we cannot use
[1:47:52] any ability we've got to make a complete
[1:47:55] surrender
[1:47:56] and to come to god you've got to
[1:47:57] surrender to him both soul
[1:47:59] body and spirit everything that you are
[1:48:01] has to be surrendered to god in order
[1:48:03] that he can work his will in you and in
[1:48:05] me now that's hard i know
[1:48:07] because we're always wanting to put our
[1:48:09] own part in it
[1:48:10] something that we know you know what we
[1:48:13] want to do it
[1:48:14] that we want to do it you say well i
[1:48:16] just show
[1:48:18] i just know it should be done this way
[1:48:21] but as long as you're doing it that way
[1:48:23] it's going to be wrong
[1:48:25] and god will never use that effort maybe
[1:48:28] with the help of the lord we're going to
[1:48:29] get into that in a few minutes and just
[1:48:31] show you
[1:48:32] how god cannot use your ability
[1:48:37] so don't use your inability as an excuse
[1:48:39] anymore
[1:48:42] i can't do it i can't do it i can't do
[1:48:45] it
[1:48:45] well praise god he never wanted you to
[1:48:47] do it anyways
[1:48:49] he wanted to do it through you even
[1:48:50] jesus says it's not me
[1:48:52] that does the works but the father
[1:48:54] that's in me he's doing them
[1:48:56] that's the same place we're supposed to
[1:48:58] get to
[1:49:00] further in perfect strength by perfect
[1:49:02] weakness he says
[1:49:04] there that's it we smother him out we
[1:49:07] drive him away
[1:49:08] from the poorest of us to the richest of
[1:49:10] us from the least to the greatest
[1:49:12] we keep god out of our lives because of
[1:49:14] our own selves
[1:49:16] i've often said the greatest enemy i got
[1:49:18] is william branham he's the one that
[1:49:20] gets in god's way
[1:49:21] he's the one that gets lazy he's the one
[1:49:23] that gets to a place sometimes
[1:49:24] where he thinks he can do something
[1:49:28] where he thinks he can do something
[1:49:30] about it and when he does that
[1:49:31] shoves god right out of the picture
[1:49:37] watch those guys out of the picture when
[1:49:38] you say i'm the bride i can do this
[1:49:43] i'm the bride i'll do this i'm the bride
[1:49:45] i'll tackle that
[1:49:52] that's when you shove god right out of
[1:49:54] the picture
[1:50:00] what you should say is i'm the bride
[1:50:04] by god's grace and he'll protect me
[1:50:08] he'll deliver me he'll step on the scene
[1:50:11] how i don't know when i don't know i
[1:50:14] have no idea but if i honor him and
[1:50:16] submit myself to him and reverence him
[1:50:18] and and humble myself before his word
[1:50:20] he'll be mighty
[1:50:21] he'll be my defender he'll be my strong
[1:50:24] tower
[1:50:25] he will come on the scene and he will do
[1:50:27] the supernatural
[1:50:29] it's not me i don't have any ability
[1:50:31] brother said the only ability he had was
[1:50:33] to get himself
[1:50:35] out of the way to surrender himself
[1:50:38] and yield himself to god it's not what
[1:50:40] he did it's what god did through him
[1:50:44] if we want to emulate the prophet's
[1:50:45] ministry if you want to be like him
[1:50:48] that's how you can be like him just get
[1:50:50] out of the way because that was his
[1:50:52] secret
[1:50:53] his secret is his surrender his secret
[1:50:56] was his weakness
[1:50:58] his secret was the the weakness with
[1:51:01] which he was raised the weakness in
[1:51:02] which he was called
[1:51:03] the rejection from all the churches the
[1:51:06] the
[1:51:07] inability to do anything on his own amen
[1:51:10] the the casting out from the church and
[1:51:12] the
[1:51:13] the inability to write properly to
[1:51:16] grammarize
[1:51:16] properly to to put things together that
[1:51:19] was his strength
[1:51:22] if we want to copy anything copy his
[1:51:24] humility
[1:51:28] we want to stand and try to have a
[1:51:30] ministry like his and be bold and
[1:51:31] proclaim things and do mighty things
[1:51:33] amen if we're going to do what the
[1:51:35] prophet did then we're going to have to
[1:51:37] have the humility that he had
[1:51:39] and the surrender that he had and we're
[1:51:41] going to have to lay our lives down
[1:51:43] and give ourselves completely to him and
[1:51:45] get ourselves
[1:51:46] out of the way and then we will have the
[1:51:50] right kind of ministry in this life
[1:51:53] god help us
[1:51:56] he said he's going on talking about
[1:51:58] himself
[1:51:59] he's the one that gets to a place
[1:52:00] sometimes where he thinks he can do
[1:52:02] something about it and when he does
[1:52:03] that shoves god right out of the picture
[1:52:06] but when i can get rid of that guy
[1:52:08] when i can get to a place that he's out
[1:52:10] of the way then god can come over and do
[1:52:12] things that william branham knows
[1:52:14] nothing about
[1:52:16] that's when god can use you that's when
[1:52:18] he can use any of you
[1:52:20] he can use anybody when we get out of
[1:52:22] the way
[1:52:23] but as long as we got ourselves in the
[1:52:25] way then we cannot
[1:52:27] all right
[1:52:31] see the feminist movement has ruined
[1:52:33] god's picture
[1:52:37] god created a woman a byproduct
[1:52:41] who did it was she made wrong
[1:52:44] no she was made right she wasn't made
[1:52:47] the same as all the other creations were
[1:52:49] made in the original creation
[1:52:51] form she wasn't made the same way they
[1:52:53] were but it was she made wrong no
[1:52:55] she was made right she was
[1:52:58] made with a weakness so that she could
[1:53:01] fall
[1:53:02] so that god could bring his plan was she
[1:53:04] made wrong no she was made right
[1:53:08] and she in her weakness and her
[1:53:11] submission
[1:53:12] in her weakness amen she was tempted by
[1:53:14] the devil
[1:53:15] and opened the door to god's redemption
[1:53:18] plan
[1:53:20] god was working through the weaker
[1:53:21] vessel and three come to another weaker
[1:53:24] vessel
[1:53:25] and he brought forth the seed that'll
[1:53:27] bruise the serpent's head
[1:53:29] he's working through the weaker vessel
[1:53:32] but the feminist movement will come in
[1:53:34] and say you're not weak you're strong
[1:53:38] that's why i hate church feminism
[1:53:42] you're a strong church you're powerful
[1:53:44] nothing's going to happen to you
[1:53:46] you got this and you got that you ain't
[1:53:48] got nothing in yourself all you've got
[1:53:50] is a promise from god
[1:53:51] and your ability to surrender yourself
[1:53:53] to that promise
[1:53:56] you keep pumping people and pumping
[1:53:58] people and pumping people
[1:53:59] until they take on the characteristics
[1:54:01] of vashti i say god forgive us
[1:54:04] we're not going to pump that we're just
[1:54:05] going to go back to the word the word
[1:54:07] the word the word the word that's my
[1:54:09] headship that's my leadership
[1:54:11] that's my god and he lives in me
[1:54:15] are you the word too yes i'm the word
[1:54:17] too but i'm the feminine part of the
[1:54:19] word that's subjecting myself and
[1:54:20] surrendering myself
[1:54:22] to the headship of the world
[1:54:25] not what i can do i can't do anything
[1:54:29] i'm about as capable as mary was when
[1:54:32] she was a virgin in nazareth
[1:54:34] to bring about isaiah 7. how capable was
[1:54:36] she she was the predestinated one she
[1:54:38] was chosen of god in the mind of god
[1:54:39] before the foundation of the world
[1:54:41] but what capability did she have to
[1:54:43] bring it to pass
[1:54:45] years later you can go up to mary and
[1:54:46] say thank you for bringing jesus on the
[1:54:48] earth and she would say i had nothing to
[1:54:50] do with it
[1:54:51] it wasn't me i was just the one standing
[1:54:54] near when he did it
[1:54:55] wasn't what i knew it's what he did it's
[1:54:58] not what my strength
[1:54:59] it was his strength it was not what i've
[1:55:01] done it's what i surrendered myself to
[1:55:06] god is looking for a bride in this day
[1:55:08] to bring forth the promised seed amen
[1:55:10] it's not going to be her ability
[1:55:12] how can you do it there's no only one
[1:55:14] thing you can do you can say be it unto
[1:55:16] me according to your word
[1:55:18] not by might not by strength but by my
[1:55:21] spirit sayeth the lord
[1:55:25] the feminism wants to take
[1:55:31] and lift the woman out of this poor
[1:55:33] position of being weaker
[1:55:38] you see how the devil is
[1:55:41] feminism wants to say no no no you're
[1:55:44] not
[1:55:44] weaker you want to be subject you're
[1:55:47] equal to
[1:55:48] you're better than men
[1:55:52] you can do anything he can do and you
[1:55:54] can do it better
[1:55:56] be strong girl power
[1:56:01] i mean have you seen the shirts
[1:56:04] girl power even i saw a shirt on a
[1:56:07] little girl one day said boys drool
[1:56:10] girls rule
[1:56:12] what mother would put that shirt on her
[1:56:14] daughter
[1:56:16] and set her up for the devil to use her
[1:56:18] for destruction
[1:56:21] why because god make her a weaker vessel
[1:56:25] because she's a key to redemption as a
[1:56:28] weaker vessel
[1:56:29] don't take away the weakness of the
[1:56:31] woman
[1:56:32] don't empower her don't
[1:56:36] leave her the way god made her because
[1:56:39] god made her for redemption purposes
[1:56:42] and he made her just right to bring
[1:56:45] about his plan of redemption
[1:56:47] don't change the woman she's made
[1:56:50] right she different yes is she weaker
[1:56:54] yes is there a door to be open yes but
[1:56:56] she's made
[1:56:57] right don't don't pump feminism into
[1:57:01] your daughters
[1:57:02] put the scripture into their minds let
[1:57:06] them know how wonderful it is to be made
[1:57:08] and fashioned that way
[1:57:09] to be to be made in weakness so that god
[1:57:12] can use a woman he's always used the
[1:57:14] woman who what's the devil after the
[1:57:16] woman what's god after the woman
[1:57:18] why is this battle over the woman
[1:57:20] because she's instrumental to redemption
[1:57:22] she's the key to redemption
[1:57:27] why is the feminist movement moving so
[1:57:29] fast why is it getting such dominance
[1:57:31] why because the woman is the key to
[1:57:33] redemption the weaker vessel is the key
[1:57:37] the devil wants to use the weakness for
[1:57:39] his purpose and god is intended to use
[1:57:41] the weakness for his glory
[1:57:45] i say glory in what you are
[1:57:49] and say thank you god
[1:57:52] for when i am weak then
[1:57:55] am i strong
[1:58:00] god bless you sisters you who will
[1:58:03] take what god has made you and say i
[1:58:05] want to be
[1:58:06] what god has made me and i want god to
[1:58:09] use my
[1:58:10] my my womanhood to display his
[1:58:13] attributes
[1:58:15] not to move out from where god has me
[1:58:17] and take on a role
[1:58:19] take feministic ideas and throw all of
[1:58:22] that in the trash because it's all
[1:58:24] antichrist
[1:58:26] come back to saying you know husbands
[1:58:30] dwell with your wives according to
[1:58:32] knowledge giving honor
[1:58:34] value something that's valuable
[1:58:37] and precious to her as the weaker vessel
[1:58:42] now she's the example of the church
[1:58:45] she's the type of redemption
[1:58:47] and then the bible comes in romans 16
[1:58:49] and paul says
[1:58:50] thus be the god of all peace who will
[1:58:53] bruise the serpent
[1:58:54] under your feet what feet
[1:58:58] the church's feet the bride's feet the
[1:59:00] woman's feet
[1:59:02] shortly she's a key to redemption
[1:59:07] but that key that key to redemption has
[1:59:10] everything to do with the way she's made
[1:59:14] and she can take that weakness and yield
[1:59:16] it to the devil
[1:59:18] or she can take that weakness and yield
[1:59:20] it to god
[1:59:22] and now the bride in this day the church
[1:59:25] she can take that weakness that she has
[1:59:29] because she's in feminine form is that
[1:59:32] true
[1:59:33] so she's the weaker vessel she can take
[1:59:37] that weakness
[1:59:38] and she can yield it to the devil and
[1:59:41] he'll bring
[1:59:41] more deception more ruin
[1:59:45] or she can take that weakness and she
[1:59:48] can yield it to her husband the revealed
[1:59:50] word in this day
[1:59:52] and it can keep unlocking redemption
[1:59:56] i say let's take our weakness and yield
[1:59:59] it to him
[2:00:01] say god i know nothing in myself i
[2:00:04] am nothing my abilities will never
[2:00:07] accomplish anything
[2:00:08] but you chose me the weaker vessel and
[2:00:10] i'm giving all myself
[2:00:12] to you and when that woman the weaker
[2:00:14] vessel yielded herself to her husband
[2:00:16] she had the ability to bring forth the
[2:00:18] seed
[2:00:20] and in this day if we'll just yield
[2:00:22] ourselves to our husband
[2:00:23] it brings the ability through his
[2:00:25] strength
[2:00:26] that's sown into her to bring forth
[2:00:29] christ
[2:00:30] she'll never do it or on her own she'll
[2:00:33] only do it
[2:00:34] in submission and weakness
[2:00:38] do you want to go to a strong church no
[2:00:44] do you want to have the best of it no
[2:00:48] i want to look around and say there's a
[2:00:50] lot of weakness around here
[2:00:55] we we need him
[2:01:00] there's a lot there's a lot that we can
[2:01:02] do better
[2:01:04] praise god we need him
[2:01:08] be the weaker vessel and yield it to him
[2:01:13] let's all stand musicians if you could
[2:01:15] come
[2:01:21] i hope every woman can leave here today
[2:01:22] saying i'm glad i'm a woman
[2:01:25] i'm glad that god has put something in
[2:01:29] me
[2:01:29] that will display what he's doing in
[2:01:31] this world and what he's done and what's
[2:01:33] happened
[2:01:34] then i can be a type of the church and
[2:01:37] the key
[2:01:38] is submission humility
[2:01:43] reverence to our headship the king
[2:01:46] which is christ the revealed word
[2:01:50] let's give it all back to him and let
[2:01:52] him take the weaker vessel in this day
[2:01:56] and let him take our weakness and turn
[2:01:58] it to strength
[2:02:01] and let him the god of all peace
[2:02:04] bruise the serpent the devil
[2:02:08] under your feet shortly not by your
[2:02:12] power
[2:02:13] but by his let's bow our heads and pray
[2:02:16] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[2:02:19] we thank you god that you've showed us
