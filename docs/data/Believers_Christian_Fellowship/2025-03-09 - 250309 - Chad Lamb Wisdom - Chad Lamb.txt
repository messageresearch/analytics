this Tuesday over in Indiana and uh then the funeral will be Wednesday morning the information's posted on the bulletin board if you want to grab that information on the funeral home in the times and also if you just want his address it's there so you can send him a card or whatever but just remember their family at this time as we stand with them and support our brother man while we're standing let's turn to Proverbs chapter 3 and we'll go and start in verse 13 Proverbs 3: 13 13 happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that GTH understanding for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain thereof than fine gold she is more precious than rubies and all the things that can't desire are not to be compared under her Length of days are in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honor her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy is everyone that retaineth her the Lord by wisdom hath founded the Earth by understanding ha he established the heavens by his knowledge The Depths were broken up and the clouds dropped down the Dew amen God bless you as you have your seats keep your Bibles handy we're going to read several more scriptures here in the Book of Proverbs but this morning I like to preach on the subject of wisdom and I couldn't think of a clever title other than than wisdom amen but how do you get more clever than wisdom praise the Lord um but it's a subject that I've been thinking on for quite a while I've been uh there's some things as we go on I'll share with you some things that have been hitting me with impact and I've been looking at it and and God's been dealing with me and uh so as I started looking at it and started looking at the things that God was dealing with me it began to open and open and open and open so I just wanted to share those things with you this morning I mean these are simple things but they're simple and profound at the the same time there are things that are common but they're deep and they're they're necessary although we we know about some of these things but we find here in the book of uh uh Proverbs it says happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that GTH understanding and then it becomes it begins to explain to us that it's more valuable than rubies the merchandise of it is better than silver and gold all that you can desire cannot even be cannot even hold a candle to this wisdom and understanding so it's the thing that we should desire more than silver more than gold more than rubies more than anything else that we can desire amen should be wisdom let's go to Proverbs chapter 4 and read more about wisdom Proverbs 4: 5 it says get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding exalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to honor when thou Dost Embrace her she shall give to thee thine head an ornament of Grace a Crown of Glory shall she deliver to thee hear oh my son and receive my sayings excuse me and the years of thy life shall be many I have taught thee in the way of wisdom I have led thee in right path when thou goest thy steps shall not be straighten and when thou runstrom wisdom is is and and when we look here especially at verse 5 to 7 get wisdom get that's an instruction get wisdom uh he says verse 7 wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding this is something I've been thinking about it says get wisdom and it's like you can't just go to the store and just get wisdom like how do I get wisdom how do I wisdom is the principal thing so in all things get wisdom and it's the most valuable more than anything you can desire so get it well okay where do I go you know where do I go get it and on what shelf do I get it from and what do I pay for it amen this is these are things that I've been thinking about and so we're going to look at that for a little bit but when it says get it it it shows that there's some aspect of attaining involved there's some aspect of the the so it it in this instructions so far it's telling you that it should be desired more than Ruby so that you should have a longing and a desire and a want above every other want for this wisdom and that you should get it that means that there's something about getting it that you don't just sit around and wait for it to hit you in the head that you get it the question is how that's a good question amen let's go to Proverbs chapter 8 now this is going to be a long reading but just stick with me it's all about wisdom Proverbs chapter 8 verse1 does not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice she standeth in the top of the high places by the way in the places of the path she crith at the gates at the entry of the city at the coming in at the doors unto you oh men I call and my voice is to the sons of man oh you simple understand wisdom and ye fools be of an understanding heart here for I will speak of excellent things and the opening of my lips shall be right things for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an Abomination to my lips all the words in my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing forward or perverse in them so now we're seeing characteristics of wisdom it's truth with no lie no evil no wickedness we're seeing these characteristics verse n they are all plain to him that understandeth and right to them that find knowledge receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than Choice gold for wisdom is better than rubies and all things that may be desired are not to be compared to it so what is the What is the greatest thing that we can have uh wisdom greater than rubies greater than gold greater than silver is wisdom amen verse 12 I wisdom dwell with prudence and and find out knowledge of witty inventions the fear of the Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy in the evil way and the forward mouth do I hate counsel his mind and sound wisdom I am understanding I have strength by me Kings reign and Prince's decree Justice by me princes Rule and Nobles even all the judges of the earth I love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me remember you have to get wisdom and get understanding and here we're admonished to seek and those that seek me early shall find me I love this seek me early kind of the the the the language in the Bible is sometimes we have to understand that the language in many ways is very symbolic and very poetic and so seek me early doesn't mean that you have to get up early although we know that's a good principle is seek the Lord early but it seek me early it seek me first this is the first thing to seek this is seek me early before you seek anything else seek me early they shall find me riches and honor are with me yeay durable riches and righteousness my fruit is better than gold yay than fine gold and my Revenue than Choice silver I lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgment that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance and I will fill their Treasures the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old so now we're start this this wisdom that we're talking about is amazing because it was with God in the very beginning before any of his Works were established or come into manifestation so the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning orever the Earth was when there were no depths I was brought forth when there were no fountain abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth while as yet he had not made the Earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the Dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he set a compass upon the face of the deep when he established the clouds above when he strengthened The Fountains of the deep when he gave to the Sea his decree that the wat should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him this is where uh this is the place in the scripture I see where brother Benham gets that uh uh that place in the message where he starts talking about amen the pillar of fire the Son of God is a pillar of fire he said playing at the feet of the father brother man and and that's referring to this scripture here let's read this again uh verse 30 then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable part of his Earth and my Delights were with the sons of men now therefore hearken unto me oh ye children for blessed are they that keep my ways hear instruction and be wise and refuse a not blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my Gates waiting at the post of my doors for though for who so findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favor of the Lord and He that sinth against me wrongth his own soul all they that hate me love death well I would say wisdom is important when we go to read what the Bible has told us about wisdom amen it and we find that wisdom here is personified amen it's given attributes is of a of a person and we know that wisdom amen is wisdom is part of God it's part of God character it's part of God's attributes it is expression of God and wisdom was he said when when he was forming everything I was there with him I was brought forth why because God in his wisdom made everything but he made everything according to his word of course his word and his wisdom go hand in hand they're one and the same and so this is an attribute of his word from the beginning but it's his wisdom that is on display and so I was looking at a definition of wisdom and I I looked in several places and I found this definition which I really likeed uh on some online Bible dictionary and and the reason I liked it is it tied into with what I've been looking at in wisdom all the definitions are good and true but I just like the way this is worded and it says wisdom and it's taking the word in the Old Testament for wisdom that we've been reading said is the ability to judge correctly and to follow the best course of action based on knowledge and understanding I'm going to read that again wisdom is the ability to judge correctly and to follow the best course of action based on knowledge and understanding that's why God created everything by his wisdom yeah because he had perfect knowledge and understanding and he did everything correctly according to knowledge and understanding that's right and then they went on to to give some examples says wisdom is the ability to see something from God's Viewpoint wisdom is God's character in many practical Affairs of life so wisdom we know is an attribute of God it's an attribute of the word uh in many ways and here it's used synonymously with the word so so wisdom is actually the character of God and relation to many things uh that we come across in life so the wisdom would be the wisdom would be the character of God in this situation so we could say it that way in this situation what what do we what what do we need sometimes we come into a place where we need to make a decision and we want to know the right way to do things and what God would have us do what we need is wisdom because we can make actions and we can we can get advices and we can we could read scriptures and we could read quotes we can come up with multiple ways Amen to to to uh maybe uh move forward in a certain direction but what we need is wisdom amen what we need is God's character in this situation and if we have God's Chara character in this situation and make our decision based off God's character in this situation then we will be operating in wisdom amen so you can see how that this kind of wisdom is so different than the wisdom of the world let's look at this in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 I've got quite a few scriptures to read uh early on here so just keep your Bibles handy we're going to flip and this may wind up like a Bible study but praise God I like Bible studies 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 17 1 Corinthians 1:1 17 for Christ sent me not to baptized but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the Jews require a sign in the Greek seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greeks full foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty in base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yay in things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are you in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord so we find that the wisdom of God is foolishness to man and the wisdom of man man is foolishness to God so this wisdom we're talking about is so contrary to the wisdom of the world it's so opposite and what he's speaking of here he starts talking about Calvary and it's a stumbling block to the Jews and its foolishness to the Greeks because no no man would no man amen would administer his plan this way no human being amen would become a king this way and purchase back his Redemption and destroy the Enemy by coming in humility and being subject to the elements of the world Amen and and being mocked and scored and persecuted and hung on a cross and killed by the very people he created amen that's foolishness to man but that's God's wisdom that's God's character that's God's wisdom that's the nature of the word and so the nature of God the wisdom of God is so different than the wisdom of man amen they runs absolutely contrary to one another that's why the Greeks with all their wisdom and and their hierarchy of Greek gods and and the gods who are punishing man and gods who are selfish and God Gods who want to uh rule over men for their own pleasure for their own desire and for their own they couldn't understand the true wisdom of God Amen who would give himself for a subjects not not sacrific his subjects for himself so the to the to the Greeks it was foolishness to the Jews it was a stumbling block how could their their God Amen how could he come on and take on flesh and be spit on and on I mean to them it was an absolute stumbling block but to God it was the wisdom of God Christ the wisdom of God the power and wisdom of God so this kind of wisdom is so different than the world that the world looks at it many times as foolishness but God looks at the wisest of men as foolishness that's why God has chosen that's why Paul says here he hasn't chose many mighty many noble many of the elite God has chose the base things of this world to confound the things that are wise why because his wisdom is contrary to man's Wisdom amen God's wisdom goes low man's Wisdom puffs up makes him high so God will take the low those of us who don't know don't have great understanding aren't tremendously uh uh established or well respected or well known or or we don't have good understanding we don't have great education we don't have all these things and God will take no bodies from nowhere like he took Mary and he would confound the wisdom of the wise amen and he would show his wisdom in humility so we we cannot be wise the way the world is wise but we have to be wise the way God is wise and God's wisdom many times looks like foolishness to man so when we say I desire to have the wisdom of God that you realize if that wisdom of God comes into your life and begins to affect your life that you're going to look like a fool to most of the world so when we when when we want this wisdom when we get this wisdom remember get wisdom it's the principal thing get wisdom and with all you're getting get understanding amen get these things but you have to realize that the things that you're obtaining for the things that you're getting amen the things that you're seeking early the wisdom that you're Desiring more than rubies and more than Cho choice that thing that you desire is not going to promote you one drop in this world we're not seeking wisdom so that we know more than the people around us amen that's not that kind of wisdom you may know more than the people around you but that knowledge that God gives you that wisdom amen will cause you to be the lowest of everybody around you because that's what that's the way Jesus Christ came so we we have to understand what we're striving for what we're getting what we're getting is not going to help our Humanity look good in the eyes of other Humanity so if you want this kind of wisdom if you seek it early and you desire you you just have to understand you're not going to you're not going to walk down the road and get the title of wisdom that attached you this guy is wise no you may get the title of fool amen yes right amen so there this is why the seek this kind of wisdom amen this kind of wisdom cannot bring arrogance and a puffed up attitude amen because it has nothing to do with your flesh it will actually abase your flesh and cause you to look like a fool in the eyes of the world Amen but it's it's it's the best kind amen you know Jesus Christ had this kind of wisdom he was so wise to the ways of the world and not not in the ways of the world contrary to the ways of the world that in the eyes of the world he was brother bam said he he walked in a world that was all his own yes amen he was despised and rejected he didn't have enough sign scientific knowledge to know that certain things were off limits to him because that's what the wisdom of the world does right the wisdom of the world will tell you that you cannot walk on water right but before the world was fashion wisdom was there and brought forth from God and wisdom knows more about this creation than scientists amen right the wisdom of God has greater understanding of how this world were formed how the laws operate what gravity really is and how molecules work and what atoms are and what the nucleus of a cell looks like and what is the life that drives it all amen listen this wisdom that was there from the beginning that was brought forth in gone and was with him when he decreed everything and he put boundaries and he said it all that wisdom knows more than any scientist on this planet because the scientist doesn't believe you can walk on water but wisdom knows you can amen amen it was the wisdom of the world would have never told Jesus that he could take five loaves of bread and a couple fishes and break them and multiply to feed 5,000 but the wisdom of God Amen who created all things knew amen knew more than the scientists knew that's right amen so I'd rather be a fool in the eyes of Science and have this wisdom amen because this is the wisdom that's going to change my atom someday this is the wisdom that's going to overcome every obstacle that's placed before us it doesn't matter where listen we have to understand that this wisdom of God Amen was before the the physical creation of the earth amen so it supersedes it rises above it has greater knowledge than the physical creation of the world so therefore this wisdom is not limited or Bound by what we call Natural laws am amen so by this wisdom listen this is the kind of wisdom that came to brother banham and said you have need of squirrels yeah amen listen that was not worldly wisdom right that looks foolish in the eyes amen that looks foolish in the eyes of the world they look at that kind of wisdom and say you're you're crazy you're off your head you don't know what you're talking about that's not possible that's the the worldly wisdom was the one that was resisting and fighting Noah and Noah looked like a fool in the eyes of the world cuz Noah said it's going to rain there's going to be a huge flood and the only way of Salvation is to get on this boat God told me to build it and building it the way he told me this is the place of Salvation amen and brother bam said they had they had science that that exceeded our science amen they had devices that they could shoot the Moon that they had all kinds of worldly understanding as far as how the world operates and they knew there was no moisture up there to fall had never reigned before they could prove all of those things but that was no limiting factor to the wisdom of God the wisdom of God knew how to get rain to fall out of the sky yeah amen just because man in his Collective wisdom over the last 6,000 years has come to Scientific achievements is no barrier over on God praise be to God so this kind of wisdom looks like foolishness to the world while we're in 1 Corinthians let's turn to chapter 3 1 Corinthians Chapter 3 Verse 18 says let no man deceive himself if any man among you seeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise praise be to God you know the problem is we don't want to look like a fool we want to look wise yes yes that's that's our problem friend we want to look like we know what we're talking about we want to look like we have our act together we want to look respectable in the eyes of others around us but in order to obtain this kind of wisdom we're going to have to just give that up yeah and become a fool that we may be wise for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the Lord knoweth the thoughts of of the wise that they are vain praise be to God that's not the wisdom I want the Book of Proverbs makes this statement I'll just read it to you Proverbs 26:12 seest thou a man wise in his own conceit there is more hope of a fool than of him you know most of the time we're wise in our own conceit that's worldly wisdom and the problem with worldly wisdom is we've come to conclusions with partial information yes that's right right all of science all of science has come to conclusions with partial information that's right amen so they're wise in their own conceit because they don't realize there's a whole lot they don't know amen and because they assume that they know a whole lot they they are wiser in their own conceit and there's more hope of a fool for somebody like that y they don't they because they will only study and they will only gain knowledge off the physical world that they can measure and test and and shape and and and and run experiments on and because they leave out the supernatural world Amen they they're automatically going to come to wrong conclusions because they only have partial information right praise God I would rather go to the source of information and not worry about how much information I can collect just go back to the source amen because he knows it all amen and be led by the spirit of God so all of humanity is wise and it's own conceit because they think they know that's one of the biggest problems that you and I have even serving God is we think we know it's one of our biggest problems is we think we know and I I pray that God will help me to get beyond that idea of I think I know because just that statement shows that you don't know because you think you know which means you don't know oh I would rather have amen I'd rather be in contact with the one who knows and I'd rather get wisdom from wisdom who does know amen so remember we're still looking at getting wisdom wisdom is the principle thing and all thy getting get understanding it is life to thee all that love me love life and though that hate me love death so we're getting down to life and death amen with this wisdom let's go to Proverbs 23 if you could go back to Proverbs with me Proverbs 23: 23 another interesting scripture proverbs 2323 says but the TR buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction and understanding so I was told to get wisdom and to get understanding I was told to seek wisdom early I was told it was the principal thing now I'm told to buy buy the truth and sell it not and wisdom and instruction and understanding so the this reminds me of uh Revelation in the leodan church age buy of me gold tried in the fire and you know I've looked at that scripture for a long time too and I'm thinking bu you know like what can I pay amen because we understand buy you know we go to the store and I want something I I give some money and I get in exchange for the money I get what I want I went and I bought I buy it I buy whatever it is I need I buy bread I buy milk I buy whatever and he's saying now Buy the truth and bu understanding by wisdom by instruction bu these get it attain it and this word bu amen it really means to attain or to acquire and and when you go so so it's interesting that the Bible doesn't just say receive but it says buy and it says get I find that interesting do you find that interesting cuz I always like buy of me gold trying to fire okay Lord you know where's it at and how much does it cost and you know if it was that way and we could physically do it we couldn't afford it for one but if we could we would sell everything we had I'd take out loans I'd sell plasma as often as they would let me go and sell my blood I would do it to acquire this because it's the principal thing but it's the terminology of buy and of get that I find interesting and it says buy and sell not buy and sell not that means that we are instructed to acquire and in order the way we buy things is there's an exchange rate for something that I go and I give something in order to get something and then it says and sell not which means to sell means another exchange on the other end that I I I have something but I will take something in replacement of this right amen so if you give me something I mean it could be a trade it could be money it could be whatever but if you give me something then I'll give you what I have that's selling buying is I'll give you something and you give me selling is you give me something and I'll give you what I have yeah and it tells us to buy the truth buy wisdom buy instruction buy understanding and sell it not and this is to me what it's saying is everything you have is worth giving up for this and nothing you can get is worth getting rid of this buy it and sell it not he's not talking about money he's not talking about a store he's talking about our whole life friends everything that we have should be in exchange for this I should give up all my thinking all my understanding all my associations I should give up everything to have this and there's nothing that I will take in this world in exchange for truth and wisdom and understanding and instruction are you with me that's why Jesus said buy of me gold trying to fire I thought that was awful interesting buy of me gold because wouldn't I use gold to buy gold yeah I mean gold is money it's a currency right he said buy of me gold how am I going to what gold am I going to have in exchange for gold yeah but this isn't any gold this is gold tried in the fire yes this is deity amen this is the deities that's been purged from all the world all the dross has been knocked out of it all the world this is pure Godly understanding he said come buy it of me what do I have to do to buy it amen what price does it take amen we know the things of God are freely given to us amen but me in my own understanding in my own life I have to give up everything else in exchange for this go amen he tells us to buy it acquire it attain it get it amen this isn't a passive statement this isn't a passive statement that requires no no effort and We Know listen if I if I could just say it this way we can never work our way into wisdom work our way it's not a Works things friends it's an understanding of there's value here and everything else is less valuable than this so it's not an attaining in the fact that I can work my way up and do good deeds and finally now it's not that kind of getting it's an understanding that this is the principal thing this is above rubies this is above gold this is above silver this is what he told me to get and sell it not amen this means this is the most valuable thing in my life and everything else is surrendered for this and I Will Never Surrender this for anything else get it and sell not oh I just love this I love it because it's been on my mind for a long time I hope by the time we get done you love it too amen as we share more let's go to Matthew 25 The Book of Matthew chapter 25 Matthew chap 25 verse 1 says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto the ver to 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps s while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all these virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves a't that interesting we're buying and selling again yeah and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him in the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not so here we have the parable of the 10 virgins which is very meaningful to us because of the message but we find out that five of these virgins were wise and five were foolish and so the separating fact between these these uh virgins is one was wise and one was foolish now they all had lamps and they all went out to meet the bridegroom and brother Brenham starts to show that these are these are churches these are these are types of churches through the denominational system and through the through the church ages so he he types this in many ways he says a lot of things about this but he goes to show that they were all virgins so that they were all clean living uh individuals they all had lamps and they all went on to meet the bridegroom but in the midnight call it was only the wise that had oil and because they had oil they could find their way to the call and then they could go into the supper the ones without oil couldn't and they were desperate they Cried unto them give us of thy oil and and and the wise virgins listen the wise virgins were told to buy and sell not yeah right amen I'm not giving up my oil for anything yeah for anything not even human sympathy or I'm giving up my oil for nothing right but what did they say go to them that sell and buy another question I've had for a long time is where do would they go who's selling and who's buying right yeah these are good questions but we have to understand that these Parables like I said the language of the Bible is poetic it's metaphorical you have to see the meaning behind things amen that there that means that you got to go to The Exchange the place of exchange where you can exchange all that you have and all that you thought and all that you were taught and receive this oil and we know that the the Holy Ghost comes to us without expense I should say without charge we don't pay a certain amount of money to receive this oil because this oil is the type of the Holy Ghost amen but the Bible says repent and be baptized everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the mission of sins and you shall receive of the Holy Ghost amen what is the price that I'm paying to receive the oil then I'm repenting meaning I'm changing my whole mind all my understanding and my whole way of thinking I'm recognizing I'm wrong and I've been wrong and I'm always wrong and everything about me is wrong and all my understanding is wrong but this word that I'm hearing now is truth and life and wisdom and everything and so now what am I doing I am buying I am selling my understanding I am selling my rights I am selling my traditions I am selling everything I had I'm selling it and giving it away because it's worth more to have this word than everything I had before that's why the wise virgin says Hey listen you got to get it the way we got it go to them that sell and buy repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift so this isn't about paying this isn't about works yeah amen this is about a revelation of what's the most valuable thing what is the principal thing what what are we selling out for so the the wise virgins aren't giving up their oil because they were told to buy and sell not yeah I've been given what I need for this journey I can't give you any I have to keep it all but you can go back to them that sell and buy and you'll get enough for your journey brother B makes some statements along this line but first uh Psalm says the word is a lamp un my feet and a light into my path all of these virgins had a lamp they had a light and we know that the word is a lamp and we know that these these represent churches amen they had a portion of the word they had some gospel understanding and they went out to meet the bridegroom they were looking for the coming of the Lord Brother Bram says amen but but some took oil with them because they realized amen that it's going to take the oil Amen to manifest or to burn to give power and life to the light amen amen some just took their lamp amen and went with no oil amen representative of the Holy Ghost meaning they that everybody everybody took a Bible amen right everybody went forth to meet him with the Bible with an understanding of the gospel and they had all kinds of understandings a Baptist understanding and a presbyterian understanding and a Baptist understanding there was all kinds of understanding amen but but listen friends there was many people who thought having the lamp was enough right amen and they went with traditional understanding they went with mean the doctrines and teaching of the elders and of the fathers and they went with the lamp thinking this lamp amen will take me all the way to my bridegroom and they didn't understand that this lamp has to have oil and the oil is the Holy Ghost which is a lifegiver to the word they had to have a power behind it to illuminate it and make it live and they thought I've got the truth I've got the word I've got Bible verses but listen friends it takes more than that and in this message it's the same thing it takes more listen we've got search programs and ways that you can type things in and find quotes you need more than a search program you need the lifegiver to the word to illuminate it and make it live it's a good lamp there's nothing wrong with the lamp but it needs the oil to bring life amen but the wise realized I need more than my understanding I need more than a quote list I need more than my search program and I need more than just being able to read a Bible amen I need more than the teachings of my fathers I need more and it doesn't listen it doesn't matter how correct the teaching of the fathers are you need more than just the teaching of the fathers you've got to have the oil Amen to make the light shine to bring manifestation to bring life into that lamp and only the oil will bring that life at the right time at the bridegroom call and will illuminate The Gospel Light from the word with the life and power behind it to make it shine so that this word will lead you all the way to your bridegroom amen so in the Midnight Hour when everything is pitched black what is it that's going to lead you your lamp but it takes the power of the Holy Ghost Amen to make it shine in your life amen to make it Shine for you it can Shine for your neighbor listen these were 10 virgins they were all I guess in close proximity to one another but each one only had enough oil for themselves yeah my oil won't shine your lamp amen that's right and you can't use my oil to make it to the bridegroom in the Midnight Hour amen amen you've got to have oil In Your Vessel amen so brother man would tell explain this to us in many ways and in many types of scenarios he would use to explain this and he would tell us that you know the they they didn't take oil the Revival died they had truth Luther had truth Wesley had truth the Pentecostal had truth amen but they didn't they didn't stay with the present tense truth the life amen and they'd had no oil with them in the midnight crime but the wise what made them wise was that they knew they needed oil they were all virgins they all went to wait for the bridegroom they all knew they had to have lamps what made them wise is that they knew they knew they needed something more yes and they wouldn't go without it I pray what would make us wise today is realizing that I can do nothing without him that I need the holy ghost in my life if I'm ever going to make it to the bridegroom and into the marriage supper it's got to be his life his power in me cuz brother R said the Holy Ghost is the lifegiver to the word and we need it friends in the message the conflict between God and Satan he said says yes yes sir yes they don't have these big things they don't claim to have anything they just claim to believe something Jesus sent the Holy Ghost which is himself he said a little while in the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I will be in you be with you even in you to the end of the world now now watch listen uh Jesus knew it so he sent the Holy Ghost to confirm the word said did you get it to confirm to those who have taken their Refuge behind the word that that he is the word see let them out there they'll laugh at the system they'll say they're crazy but Jesus sent the Holy Spirit which is himself to get it to those that's behind the word like Abraham's group to confirm the word before them to show that he still the word see you have taken the right place all right fire is the confirmation of the light coming from the word the smart virgins the wise virgins had oil in their lamb and she trimmed her lamp and lit it now what is it God is the word the oil is the spirit and the fire is the gospel so you got that amen God is the word the oil is the spirit and the fire is the Gospel Light on the oil God said so that's the vessel all right the oil is in the vessel and the fire burning it shows that it's reflecting the light of what the word said that's the reflection now that wise virgin could do that but the other foolish virgin was on the outside had no oil they couldn't reflect nothing but just their church and their denomination now you say the word you said the word was was Spirit yes sir God said my word is spirit that's right the true bride must be unified by the word now remember if she's a part of Christ she has to be the word of Christ so I read this beginning part because I liked what brother bham said he said he sent his holy ghost to confirm the word he to confirm to those who had taken their Refuge behind the word that that he's in the word see and he he goes again he says now Jesus sent the Holy Spirit which is himself to get it to those that's behind the word like Abraham's group to confirm the word before them to show that he's still the word so I need the Holy Ghost I need wisdom but what must I do remember repent yes and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what is repentance repentance is seeing the word and taking Refuge behind the word amen and then he gives the Holy Ghost to everybody who's taking Refuge behind the word amen what have I done I've sold everything and bought yeah amen sold and I've bought and those are the ones those who take refuge in their Church tradition not in the word for their day amen they don't get the oil amen so the the the the wise virgin tells the foolish virgin go to them that sell and buy where did we go it was this message friends where did we go to buy amen where what other what what other retailer has yeah what we need amen what other store which other storefront would you go to to get this promise for this hour to get this holy ghost that we need to illuminate our light where did we go to buy we came to the present tense Truth for our day and when we repented meaning everything else we thought we died to and me we accepted this and we were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then what did he do he promised us that we would receive the gift of the Holy Ghost why is because we sold and we bought because we went to the right place amen right so what we can we tell what can we tell people amen who have no light and they realize I need what you have I can't live what you live I can't shine that I can't reflect that word amen I wish I had what you had you say it's available to you it's here there's a retail shop open the doors are not closed 24 hours a day 7 days a week you can go and buy just like I went and buy where is it it's this word that God has delivered through a prophetic Ministry in this day and those who take refuge behind the word he gives them the oil amen because we realize I can't just go amen because my mom and dad believe the message I can't just go because I've had good teaching I've got to sell everything out and I've got to have the oil so I can make it all the way in amen am God is the word the oil is the spirit and the fire is the Gospel Light on the oil until that lamp you're carrying becomes the reflection of the word the gospel for our day living in you praise God I'm so glad as far as we know the door is still open I listen I can't give you my oil right amen because I refuse to part with it it's not because I don't love you it's because I was told to buy and not sell I I can't give it to you because I only have enough for me amen right but I can tell you the same thing the wise virgins told the foolish virgin in this Parable go to them that sell and buy amen it's still on the Shelf it's not outdated amen you can still partake amen you can still go and find the supply chain is still good co didn't shut it down they didn't quit manufacturing it God still has it in this day and it's available friends going by and the wise the wise aren't wise because they learned a lot the wise aren't wise because they know more than the foolish virgin that's not what the wisdom is the wise are wise because they realize I need something more than me I need another Power another life I need something to make this light shine amen let's turn to Matthew Chapter 11 Matthew 11: 16 Jesus is speaking here and he says in verse 16 but where unto shall I liken this generation it is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows and saying we have piped unto you and you have not danced we have mourned unto you and you have not lamented I just want to focus on that for a minute I went through this scripture a little while back with the youth and it was really profound to me that this Jesus saying how how will I like in this generation I'm going to show you a type as I observe you this is what you're like he says it's like un children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows and saying we have piped unto you and you have not danced and we have mourned unto you and you have not lamented what he's saying is this is the hour of visitation this is when the word and fullness has been made manifest there in Israel and he says I'll tell you what this generation is like it's like this a bunch of children in the market amen and one a group of children's here and there's children going by and he's piping and playing a happy song and the children go by like they didn't hear anything dead to it no reaction whatsoever right then he says it's like those who says I mourned i i i lamented to I mourned to you and you did not lay it so when we didn't try the Happy song Amen then we tried a sad song and same thing no reaction how what is this generation like listen I I'll tell you it's the same thing in this generation CU we've had another visitation of the word the full word has come back in this generation and what's happened I I'll tell you what this how I'll liken this generation I'll liken it to this there was children in the market and they say we piped to you but you didn't dance we played you the happiest song of all amen that the fullness of redemption has come the time that the fullness is coming to the Gentiles and you it's like you heard nothing yes yeah amen and then we lamented to you we mourn to you that this this is going to be a terrible day for those who don't have Christ amen we sung the sad song cuz it's the great and terrible day of the Lord amen and you didn't mourn you didn't you weren't sad you weren't happy you weren't sad you were numb to the message and you walked on by as if you heard anything that's what this generation is like the same thing that Jesus found and look at what he types it to now look what he says for John came neither eating or drinking and they say he is a devil the son of man came eating and drinking and they say Behold a man gluttonous and a wine Biber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is Justified of her children remember what are we learning about today wisdom he starts off saying we piped you didn't dance we mourned you didn't lay man you had no reaction John came with his ministry and you passed it off as a devil yeah the son of man came in his time in his ministry and you called him a wine bibber and a friend of publicans he says but don't worry there are children yeah yeah amen he says but wisdom is Justified of her children I looked up this word Justified because sometimes we hear the word Justified and we're like what what does exactly that mean and and one of the definitions and the concordance is to render righteous are such as he ought to be so what did the children of wisdom say that's John that's the scripture that's the son of man that's the scripture wisdom is Justified of her children what was on display before them it was the wisdom of God and the Forerunner because it was the word made manifest the very thoughts of God on display and it was wisdom that came to them in that day what was it in Jesus Christ it was God's wisdom we read that in in first Corinthians it was God's wisdom on display and they had no reaction to it in fact they had an adverse reaction to it but don't worry wisdom has children meaning the word has children the father has children God has children and wisdom is Justified of her children God is Not Looking Through the world to accept him he's not looking amen for unbelievers to accept him what's justifying wisdom her children yeah and her children are saying that ain't nothing but the truth brother BR that's exactly the word that's exactly the prophecy for our day that's exactly right now messenger that's Malachi 4 that's Revelation 10:7 that's the opening of the seals that's the coming of the son of man that's Luke 17:30 what is it this great wisdom is Justified of her children because her children are on earth who come from the same Source children of who children of this great wisdom that we're talking about and what kind of wisdom does do it give them it gives them the understanding that this is the word for this day not many mighty not many noble not many wise of the world but children of wisdom we've been through this exercise so many times you already know the answer but a child of a dog is The Offspring or child of a cat is yeah and the children of wisdom would be they have the wisdom of God it's the word it's the mind it's it's the Revelation wisdom has children God has children am the word has children and those children they may not be able to do algebra listen when my son was in high school he took a physics class his mom couldn't help him anymore so every night I went to his room for a couple of hours to work on physics it was the worst time of my life I hated school more than he hated school we may not have wisdom that competes with this world we may not be able to figure a lot of things out there might be a lot of confusing things around us us and we might be considered a little bit on the foolish side but wisdom has children and wisdom is Justified of her children not of the world or worldly wisdom yeah but of those who when he pipes they dance and when he Mourns they lament because they can respond to the word for their day and then they can respond to their day of visit ation they can respond when the words made manifest that children of wisdom can respond because that's what wisdom is it's the word let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 First Corinthians chapter 12 to me that's what proved the wise virgin wise amen because they heard the bridegroom call yeah and they knew what to do to trim their lamp and go towards that voice because if I go towards the voice of the bridegroom call I will meet the bridegroom yeah amen yeah amen because remember he came outside the city and when he come outside the city it was the friend of the bridegroom that called into the city behold the bridegroom cometh come you out to meet him that means we had to leave denominations we had to leave traditions we had to leave everything else to come and be United with our bridegroom and we're United outside the city and then he takes us into the marriage supper amen that's what's going on now we've heard the Midnight Cry of the friend of the bridegroom but the wise virgin realized amen she had to have the oil so that she could trim the lamp which what is the word of God so that the word of God could illuminate her and bring her towards that voice amen not running from The Voice towards the voice because somewhere as she moves towards the voice outside the city she's going to come in contact with her bridegroom yeah amen praise be to God what made her wise is she had oil what made her wise is she knew she needed oil what made her wise is she knew what to do when she heard the call he says in 1 Corinthians did we read this yet that thank you 1 Corinthians 12:4 says uh now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administration but the same lord and there are diversities of operation but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severly as he Wills so when we come to the list of gifts these are the gifts of the Spirit and we hear sometimes emphasis put on one gift over another or certain gifts over another but these are all gifts of the Spirit and the first one listed is the word of wisdom and brother B makes a statement about this when he says and why we are not a denomination he says now how many knows that wisdom is one of the gifts of the Spirit praise be to God Amen how many knows that wisdom is one of the gifts of the Spirit now what kind of groups he's talking to then he must be talking to a group of people that has the gifts of the Spirit operating in this church and he's referring back to the Book of Revelation when John says here is to the mind that hath wisdom I'll give you the number of the beast that's what he's talking about but brother B says who's John talking to he must be talking to people that have gifts operating in the church what gift the gift of wisdom yeah operating in the church he says now you stop find that all through these Church ages here pulling out the Holy Spirit speaking out how these gifts would be working in the last days now we've got Gifts of healing working it's going good well brother there's other gifts that's just one of them that's just a little minor thing why here's a far greater gift right here which would be the best the gift of the Holy Ghost of wisdom to put the word of God together and to show the church where we're standing than just to get somebody healed we all want to be well but I'd rather have my soul well than my body well anytime oh my hear the Holy Spirit speaking through John at patmas here's to the wisdom let him listen to this so I want to pull out of there this statement of the way brother bam describes the gift of wisdom so here's a little description and and listen don't make this all inclusive he just made a statement but it stands out to me he said the gift of the Holy Ghost of wisdom to put the word of God together to show the church where we're standing amen so there's a gift of God of wisdom and that wisdom is used Amen to take the word and put the the word of God together to show the church where we're standing because wisdom is Justified of our children amen amen so we know that there's a gift of the spirit called wisdom wisdom is part of the nature of god let's go to James chapter 3 James chter 3 and verse 13 he said who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom conversation just means manner of life with works with meekness of wisdom but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish for where envy and strife is there is confusion in every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace so he begins to tell us there's two kinds of wisdom there's Earthly wisdom and heavenly wisdom there's wisdom uh there's wisdom that he says descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish so there's more than one kind of wisdom even the devil is called wise he was full of wisdom but it's not God's wisdom right it's a different kind of wisdom so we want the wisdom that comes from above and so what are some of the attributes of the wisdom that comes from above some of the attributes are you know more than anybody else around you you've got it all figured out everybody needs to come to you for the correct answers no that's not what it says the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to be in treated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy these are the attributes of the wisdom that comes from above this if we have wisdom his wisdom a gift of wisdom the wisdom of God and our children of wisdom then this is the manifestation that that wisdom should take because if it causes arrogancy or Strife or hotty attitudes or then maybe that's not the wisdom that comes from above amen even if we're using some of God's truth in our speech right do we understand there's a certain character to wisdom because wisdom is the word wisdom is God and God is wisdom and there's certain characteristics to this wisdom the other wisdom which the devil has did the Bible say he was full of wisdom yeah amen Bible said he was wiser than Daniel yeah right that's a lot of wisdom amen but but it won't display the same Godly characteristics amen amen so I think wisdom is more than knowing facts to me it's a lot more than just knowing facts he says uh brother brandham says and God's power to transform said it's all right to have wisdom but if the wisdom is contrary if the wisdom isn't correct wisdom from God wisdom and becomes natural wisdom I don't care how much science we have and what more education it's of the devil in the second seal he says why didn't Jesus choose such people he got fishermen and men that couldn't even sign their own names to put them head of his church that's right wisdom is nothing it's against Christ worldly wisdom is against Christ always so brother Bam's not brother Bam's saying wisdom is nothing he's talking about Earthly wisdom yeah man's Wisdom carnal wisdom wisdom of the of the world worldly wisdom is against Christ always so what did God get to be head of his church he said fishermen and men that couldn't even sign their own names to put them head of the church and what did he give them wisdom yeah what did they have wisdom but not the not what the world would label as wisdom yeah amen when brother br gave a definition of wisdom earlier and he says the wisdom of God that can put the word of God together and show the people where they live amen it's that wisdom brings a correct understanding of the word of God but it brings it with the correct nature I believe too which is the nature of wisdom and they come together Amen to display the the very wisdom of God Amen but that that wisdom is contrary to worldly wisdom and worldly wisdom may take the same facts but it'll produce something much different amen so God has a gift to take the word and put it together to meet the challenge of the hour but he'll always do it in the right character of wisdom when Jesus was on Earth the the things that Jesus said to the to people was absolutely astonishing wisdom like we've never seen on on the earth displayed before amen Solomon had a gift of wisdom Jesus outshine Solomon he says there's a greater than Solomon here now amen and so now we see in that wisdom they would try to trap Jesus all the time with the word so they the Pharisees had the word but they didn't have wisdom Jesus was the word and had the very nature and character of the word amen so they were always trying to use the word to defeat the word I find that amusing and they come to Jesus one time and they said is it lawful for us to pay tribute to Caesar they're trying to trip him up because they're they're chose to take money and and this money's going to a foreign entity and they're and they're into idolatry and all kinds of horrible things and now the question comes is is it right to do this and and what they're doing is they're dealing in little details and and trying to make him look bad in one way or the other either they can accuse him amen of being tied into the Roman government and supportive of an idolatrous pagan uh uh uh form of worship and government or he won't pay and they can accuse the Roman government that he doesn't pay his tax either way they got him yeah there one of those I got you kind of questions don't you love it when somebody comes and ask you a question and you know in your heart it's an I got you question yeah you're just trying to trip me up on something you don't actually want to know anything yeah right I can't stand that and as a pastor you get quite a few of them so they come to Jesus with a question question like that and he says give me a coin and give him a penny he says whose picture is on this said Caesar so then it's easy give Caesar what's Caesar and give God what's God how did he do that yeah that wasn't worldly wisdom amen he understand the nature of the word they're trying to trip him up on the word and they don't even understand the nature of the word amen they've got everything so dialed in and so uh uh they had such a legalistic way that they could prove themselves and justify themselves by keeping so much of the word and they made it so hard that other people couldn't do it so only people with good self-control and self-will could be righteous people which were the Pharisees so they come to him when his disciples are walking through a field on a on a Saturday on a Sabbath day and they're plucking ears of corn and they're rubbing them together and blowing the chaff away and popping the Grain in their mouth and all of a sudden they've got problems they got problems because they didn't wash their hands and they got problems because they're working on the Sabbath y they come to Jesus with another I got you moment and Jesus says listen didn't you read in the Bible I love that answer because they're bringing quotes out of the Bible says did you not read where David went took the showbread yeah was not lawful for him to take Jesus is so far far beyond the pettiness of their Vision amen he's moved so far beyond these little things and he's moved into the very nature of the word he is he was the word the very nature of the word and understood what God wanted amen when they brought the woman to him that was caught in the very Act of adultery they had him nailed this time because she's caught in the very Act of adultery but somehow Jesus could discern and know that that whole thing was a setup yeah right and he unraveled the whole setup because listen this wasn't a debate between Jesus and the Pharisees on the word yeah he wasn't debating he went beyond the squabble he went beyond the tis fortat and he went to the very nature and he started to show that you who want to condemn have the wrong nature yeah amen you're claiming to be standing by the word but you're not actually standing by the word because you don't have the nature of the word and you're not applying the nature of the word in this circumstance listen they this was a total setup they found a woman caught in the very Act of adultery if she's caught in the very Act of adultery then they had a they knew exactly who the man was y right but the Bible tells us that they're both supposed to be condemned and they're both supposed to be stoned so right away amen they they're keeping the word but not keeping the word they don't have pure motives amen they're not pure they're not gentle they don't have the wisdom that come from above but this is devilish sensual wisdom trying to do trying to get rid of an enemy yeah right and to do so they'll take the word and manipulate it by their own wisdom Amen to serve their own purpose and it was never God's original intent to begin with so Jesus comes and flies higher than all of that and starts to expose the hypocrisy that's in their heart and he doesn't tell him you're wrong or you can't soner or you're off the word he just says which one of you is without sin Let Him cast the first stone and all the sudden starting from the oldest to the youngest they dropped their stones and they walked away I said oh God that's the wisdom I want in my life that's the wisdom from above amen that there's no listen Jesus in no way violated the word of God he kept it all in every point but he had a greater understanding than what the Pharisees were trying to bring him into they were trying to lower him into a tis fortat devilish wisdom on the Bible yeah amen right I want that wisdom in me the one that knows brother Brenham says this I may not know my Bible very well but I know the author very well that's what I'm after friends I think that's what this wisdom is it's it's the life of the author it's the mind of the author amen it's the wisdom of the author that's what I want amen when we go to apply the word if we don't apply with wisdom we can do more damage than good you think about even raising young children if you've if you've got a little toddler there you probably know that the Bible says you spare the rod and you spoil the child amen but if you if you apply that with no wisdom what's going to happen you realize that's not the only scripture that the Bible says about raising children you do know that right I mean that's the one that gets quoted a lot when you have a little toddler and they're that age where they need a lot of Correction but the Bible also says bring them up in the fear and admonition of the Lord It also says nurture them and it also says instruct amen your son so if we only get one part of the word but we don't get the full picture from the the wisdom of God and raising children then we go to apply the word with our narrow vision and our own human understanding amen for our own outcomes and we apply the word and we can do more damage than good and you say I don't know what's wrong with him I did what the word said you didn't do all that the word said because you didn't catch the whole nature of the word amen because the nature of the word says teach along the way instruct thy son and it tells you to nurture and admonish Amen to care for and to love and to take time to instruct and teach and then when you have to administer chastisement you must administer chastisement and also chastisement is administered for Rebellion amen right that's right not because you had them out running around all day and they're too tired and they can't control their own emotions that's your fault not their fault that's not Rebellion that's exhaustion so you understand that to apply the word correctly we must apply the word with wisdom amen and that's just one little example there's we could go through example after example after example that if we don't have the mind of Christ if we don't take the mind of the author we're going to do the same thing the Pharisees did yeah amen I said God what I want more than anything is I have to get this wisdom amen I have to buy it yeah and sell it not uh I want it it's more than rubies do we realize this now this wisdom that's from above it's far more than silver and gold we got to get it we got to get it 1 Corinthians chapter 8 I want to lay this scripture in as well 1 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 1 now as touching things offered under Idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puff puffeth up but charity edth fth and if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know oh man I if I could paste this right in an ink on the back of my hand so that I won't forget it if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know brother brenham's preaching on the revelation of the hour after the seals he's saying now I know you don't understand you don't see it like you should he said frankly I don't see it like I should oh friends that's the spirit of wisdom because Paul tolds us if you think you know anything you don't know it the way you should know it he's not saying you don't know something about it he's not saying you don't have some knowledge but if you think you know it and you got to figure it out you actually don't know it like you ought to because if you knew it like you ought to you would realize it's deeper it's wider it's broader it's higher amen every word of God is beyond my peanut brain every word every jot every tit is beyond even my comprehension it goes so farther so deeper so all-encompassing that I look at it and I think it means this amen 10 years later it expands 10 years later it expands amen if we think we know something we don't know it as we ought yet oh God let this be a warning to all of us amen we think we know the message we barely know the message friends cuz the message is Christ and he'll be unfolding himself throughout eternity amen so let that be a warning to all of us amen uh this past Friday night the uh the deacons and I and our wives we all took brother Dave and sister Bessie out to dinner and we just wanted to thank him for his service and for what we learned from him in all the years that we've worked together with him and I asked him a question I said what's a piece of advice that you would give what's one lesson you learned after 47 years of being a deacon and his answer was so good he said I don't know anything at all God after 47 years of helping people through issues dealing with church issues and he realized he doesn't know anything and he can't do anything I think that's made him a good Deacon oh God help me to get the same lesson in reality if I think I know something I don't know anything as I ought yet as a pastor I don't have anything figured out friends I have no idea what's going to happen tomorrow tomorrow or what we should do or how to fix situations we're just going one step at a time trusting his word to give us answers as the light shines as we take a step the light shines we'll take the next step amen because we ain't got it figured out God helped me to be like what Dave said I don't know anything and I can't do nothing oh praise God that's what he that's why he got fishermen who are illiterate yeah that's why that's why the Apostle uh Peter when he thought he could defend the word and he took out a sword and tried to defend Jesus amen and he find out it all went to ruin and shame amen and he had to repent of that and he he flattened himself in humility and realized I can't defend the word I can't do anything I'm wrong yeah amen oh man it's good it's good for us to have a few Peter moves in our life how many's had a few Peter moves in your life I'll not forsake you I won't let this happen I'll defend the word I and how many of it ended in humility embarrassment maybe chest chastening and a little bit of scoring oh it was the best thing that ever happened to us it'd be better if it happened to us daily so that we realize we don't know anything as we ought to know yet praise God I want wisdom it's amazing how Jesus could answer like we talked about example after example he can answer you know brother Brandon did the same thing why because that Spirit of wisdom was working through that gift in his life people would ask question and he would he would just pop off answers and I'm thinking that's the smartest man in the world I would have never thought to say that listen it wasn't the smartest man in the world it was the spirit it was the life that was working through that kid it was the same life that was working in Jesus Christ that same life was working through that prophet and he'd give answers that astonish me make my jaw jop the way he handled situations but you know the Bible says that when you're called before Kings and magistrates don't think what you'll say for to be given you of the Holy Ghost and that hour what you should speak right now I got a I got a little quiz for you not a quiz but a uh uh let's just suppose for a minute let's play the world of imagination they say you're driving to work tomorrow you get pulled over you get arrested because they found out you're part of a cult and they go and they lock you in and you're going to have to give an answer for it to the magistrate or to the judge the next day do you know what you're going to do all night I got to remember that verse and I got remember how it's worded and because this I've got a good case here because they have no right and what did the Constitution say about freedom of religion That's The Human Side Oh but if we can just break away from The Human Side and trust the spirit of God as the spirit of wisdom to come and give us wisdom in the time of need and stop trying to figure it all out before that's what that's what we were told in the Bible to do don't figure it out before just go and if that Life of Christ is in you the same wisdom that was here answering Pharisees can be here to answer whatever and if he doesn't give you an answer that means he wants you locked up then praise God if that's what he wants that's what I want to give him that's what he wanted in Paul so Paul could wrote all those letters it didn't matter what Paul said Paul wasn't getting out of there because he had Epistles to write praise be to God help us Lord amen brother benam made this statement now I want to go back to buy get buy and don't sell wisdom and understanding and Truth in the message Shalom brother bam said listen friends as we close remember the Bible is the Fountain of all wisdom it doesn't come from dror PhD lld it comes from the word of God so how many wants to buy wisdom get wisdom acquire wisdom this is the Fountain of all wisdom that means it's flowing out of the word brother Brenham say also says in another message God is the Fountain of all Grace and power and of all Divine wisdom is in God so who's the fountain is it God or the word that's the right answer am amen because God is the word and the word is God amen where do I go to get this wisdom the word of God Amen where do I go to find it it's the word of Goden and this is the thought this me personally now I'm going to share with you the thought that I've been meditating on for weeks the thought that came and I began to realize I realized in myself that so many times I've read the Bible and I've read the message to gain knowledge and it wasn't bad I don't don't think evil if that's you too but I was reading it cuz I wanted to know how to be right I wanted to know what was right I wanted to know what Doctrine was right because I didn't want to be wrong and there was times especially early on in my walk that when I went to the Bible I was going to the Bible for knowledge so that I would know more than someone else y because I was coming out of a denominational system and I was having talks with people and I would go to the Bible for knowledge so I could take the knowledge and I could and I could share the knowledge or offset what they're saying with my knowledge and it was it was really more of debate and defending my faith and defending what I believed and I was going to the Bible for knowledge what's the truth on serpent SE what are the scriptures that support serpent SE what is the truth on the Oneness of the godhead what is the truth on water baptism and what are all the scriptures that support that so that I could have knowledge and I could have a case and I could sell my case yeah but I just over the last little while I don't know how long I mean it's been a while but I started thinking that's not why I go to the word anymore amen amen now I'm going to the word for wisdom amen because all my knowledge didn't really do much those who didn't believe still didn't believe I still believe they still didn't believe and all we did was throw a few barbs at each other and nothing changed yeah and I realized what I need from the word is not just knowledge although there is a Godly knowledge it's part of a statue of a perfect man it's the knowledge of God but what I needed was wisdom to apply that knowledge because I would be applying the knowledge incorrectly I would have the right knowledge I had the right Doctrine I had the right Revelation but my application was suffering we've seen that so many times in the truth we we've got the right Revelation we've got the right word we've got the right Doctrine we've got it all right but sometimes if our application is wrong we wind up with the wrong outcome and we say Well it's not my fault because I used the word but did we use the word with the spirit of wisdom gentleness Peaceable the list we got the wisdom that is from above is first gentle well I can tell you I was not always gentle I was not always peaceful and I was using knowledge without wisdom but oh if we could be like Christ if we could be like the prophet if we could use knowledge with wisdom what could God do friends I want to go back quickly to the definition that I read at the beginning just to refresh you on wisdom is the ability excuse me is the ability to judge correctly and to follow the best course of action based on knowledge and understanding wisdom is the ability to see something from God's Viewpoint wisdom is God's character in The Many practical Affairs of life oh we've gained some knowledge but you know what I need I need wisdom to use that knowledge in fact I'm kind of afraid to use the knowledge without wisdom come to the place where I'm looking at the message I'm not just looking at the message to find out what's correct Doctrine I'm looking at the message and learning from the way brother bham handles situations because what we're seeing is the wisdom of God did he have the revelation of the word did he had the full understanding the word absolutely but now I'm looking how did he apply that word how did he deal with other people how did he correct situations how did he do that because I need wisdom to apply this word the in in John 16 I'm going to read this scripture to you in John 16 Jesus says verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth amen for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things that come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father ha our mind therefore said I that he shall take a mine and shall show it unto you what is this oil that the wise virgin had it was the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost the spirit of Truth amen do you know the spirit of Truth is also the spirit of wisdom amen because there is a spirit of wisdom but it's the same Spirit yeah so do I want the spirit of God or the spirit of Christ or the spirit of wisdom or the spirit of Truth or the comforter right it's all the same Spirit friends it's all part of that nature and we want that Spirit of Truth who will guide us into all truth listen I don't believe this guiding into all truth because God is truth so guiding me into all truth is not guiding me into all the facts because facts don't necessarily equal truth I can assemble a bunch of facts and give you facts and nothing but facts but the way I assemble those facts will cause you to believe something other than the truth yeah right so the the spirit of Truth did not come to give us all the facts the spirit of Truth came to make all those facts still true yeah that I present the truth truly yeah that I represent Christ in truth and the word that I speak I speak it in Truth in the spirit of truth because it's a representation of Truth and I didn't make the word a lie because I brought with it my temperament and my aggression and my self-serving agenda and my purpose behind it yeah cuz if I bring the word with my purpose and I want to shut you down and I want to correct you and I and I want to and I want I want to do something that I gain something out of it if I bring the word that way I have not brought the truth even if everything I said was true because there was no Spirit of Truth in it this is where the spirit of wisdom will help us so much to bring the truth in truth and so it's all truth yes praise God let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 2 1 Corinthians chapter 2:2 now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god which we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is Judge of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ how do we have the mind of Christ because of the spirit of Christ the spirit of Christ is the holy ghost that has the mind of Christ and brother Brenham uh uh in spoken words The Original Seed there's a section that we talk about all the time where where the angel told him to pick up his pen and write and he tells us it's a message from the angel to the people and in this he makes this statement he says now notice the harmony Jesus never did anything until seing of the father the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ see John 5:19 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will rise it up again amen then then he said then I got a great big Hallelujah apparently he wrote Hallelujah on there here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word word and she does it in his name she has thus sayeth the Lord then it's gerti so that the Holy Spirit Waters it until it's grown and serves its purpose this is one of those other statements I started thinking about that the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ which I would think is the spirit of wisdom Amen to know what he wants done with the word see we have the word but what we need is the spirit of wisdom we need the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word amen there's so many times we know we know this isn't exactly right or that's not exactly right or this situation the word says this and the Bible says that but the question is not what facts do I have the question is what does he want done with the word yeah when they brought when they brought the woman caught in the very Act of adultery to Jesus they had some word he had the word he knew the word he knew what Moses said but the question now was was not what does the word say just black and white the question now is what does he want done with the word oh God grant us your wisdom and the bride will have it amen because this is a promise for the end time amen she will be so much like him she will be him he is in this age God has uncapped himself amen whatever barrier there was through false teaching and Doctrine he's removed it and brought us the truth so that he could bring the fullness of his life when he brings us the fullness of his life he's bringing to the bride the spirit of wisdom and I say oh God give me that wisdom so that I know what you want done with your word amen I think if we can get to that place I think that's when he'll have preeminence that's what he's going for that's what he wants he doesn't want us to run off and do our own thing but he wants through the spirit of wisdom to to take the word and apply the word the way he wants the word so we know what he wants done with his word yeah we know what correct doctrines are many times we've been taught very well many things and we understand a lot amen but one thing I don't understand every situation I find I don't automatically know what he wants done in this word in this situation I'm going to have to the spirit of wisdom we don't have index cards we don't have a Rolodex we don't have a a database where you type in situation a situation B spit out your scriptural answer no amen we've got the word now we need his mind his Spirit the spirit of the the mind the author the spirit of the author with his word so that we do what he wants with his word amen I don't know about you but I'm tired of doing what I want with his word I want to do what he wants with his word brother bandam made makes this statement and just once more Lord I found it amazing he said if God come to me and said I want you to go to Earth and I was up there and he said go to Earth and I'm going to give you a 100-year space of knowledge but I want you to lot your your years what years you want to take the first 25 the second 25 the 3D 25 or the last 25 I would say well if I'm going to put my time here to be a football player an athlete or something I better take the first 25 if I'm going to be here to be a carpenter or some person like that well I better take the second 25 but if I want to take to serve the Lord I'll take the last 25 from 75 to 100 because I've had the accumulation of that much knowledge and I know more about it what time did he want if he could have had had any time allotment he wanted what time would he take he would have take the last 75 to 100 listen when he's the weakest yeah when he has the least capabilities when maybe even his mind isn't as sharp as it used to be and his body is not as Cooperative as it used to be if he doesn't have the energy and the stamina and the strength and all that he had amen but he said he he's going to take that time because he would have gained in those first 75 years something that will carry him through regardless of the condition of his body he wasn't looking at the weakness of his body because the weakness in weakness is strength made perfect amen what brother benam was looking at is I finally after all those years might finally know how to serve the Lord yeah amen oh praise God Amen we we we we want strength and we want vitality and we want this and that and all these other things but what God wants is God wants humility and surrender and somebody that'll just stay out of the way and let him have his way and oh God if you could give us 75 100 a th000 6,000 years with an understanding from your mind amen and put it inside of us so that we know what you've done done with your word yeah let us not rely on our strength our Vitality our mental prowess let's put all that aside and say I need the spirit of the author the spirit of wisdom to come into me found that astounding you know when I was young that wasn't such a big statement for me I was like yeah okay whatever brother man says as long as I can work walk what doesn't matter to me now that's the next thing he says as long as I can stand on my two feet and walk around what difference does it make how old I am I'm here to serve the Lord and that's it what he's saying is I wasn't here to accomplish anything for myself anyways as long as I got some Mobility I'll serve the Lord and before I used to think yeah that's whatever but listen anymore as I'm finishing my second 25 years and getting ready to go into the third I realize what a big deal that is that he would volunteer for those years oh if we could just have that mindset friends you know we've been many many decades now that the word of God's been delivered to us many decades since the message has come it's been over 60 years since the seals have been preached and but maybe God just needs for us to have enough time to finally know how to do something maybe we maybe we needed to fail in a lot of human efforts maybe we needed our churches to fail and our Ministries to fail and ourselves to fail and our families to fail maybe we needed to come to this place where that you come in human life after 75 years of trying and failing and getting it right getting it wrong and learning something where you finally come to the place where you says like brother brother Dave Wood says I don't know anything and I can't do anything praise God maybe that's what he wants us to achieve maybe the Pinnacle of our Revelation the highest we come in humanity at the end of all of this in adoption as we get to the place where it says I don't know anything and I can't do anything help us Lord Paul the Apostle he prays in Colossians 1:9 he says for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord into all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God what was Paul's prayer for that early church that they would be filled with all knowledge of his will and all wisdom and understand spiritual understanding in Ephesians 1:15 he says wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all Saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him Paul was praying for his disciples he was praying for the church that God would grant them this Spirit of knowledge Spirit of understanding Spirit of wisdom I'll take those prayers now amen I want to look at one more scripture if you can turn with me to James and we'll finish here if the musicians want to come brother Blake if you'd like to come on up let turn to the Book of James chapter 1 James chapter 1 I just want to read one scripture and that's verse five if any of you lack wisdom let them ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and unrath not in a shall be given him I'll take it I'm going to take this as my promise amen do you know what I realize I lack wisdom I need more wisdom I need the more of the mind of the author in me but he told us if you're in that position if any of you here feel like you lack wisdom I got good news for you CU James said let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally I'm glad God's a liberal he give to all men liberally and unrath not and it shall be given himen you know what I'm going to do I'm going to go get some wisdom amen because the Bible told me to get it yeah the Bible told me to buy it and sell it not Bible told me it's worth more than rubies or riches it's the principal thing and it's the thing we're striving for and having so what am I going to do I'm going to go to the Fountain of wisdom and every time I open up the Fountain of wisdom whether it be this Bible or the message that God given us in a message book every time I open them up I'm going to say God would you give me wisdom because God gives liberally and abrath not and gives to him that ask and I'm not going to go to the word anymore looking for facts for debate or material to win an argument or for some reason reason to show that I know more than somebody else but now I'm going to the word because I need the Fountain of the word to flow out for me wisdom and understanding and knowledge and the Very nature of Christ and I just I just believe that the Bible's true that if any of us need wisdom and lack wisdom I can't imagine any of us being here today and saying well I don't need to pray that prayer that's only for people who lack wisdom I think we all find ourselves in the Book of James if we lack wisdom I know what to do now there's a fountain there's a source and there's a father who gives liberally if we ask amen saying God teach me teach me how to know more than somebody else teach me how to be better teach me how to be right when other no God give me your wisdom let me see how you can conduct yourself how you handle your word how you save your children how you share the gospel show me Lord what you want me to do with your word praise God let's all Stand Together may God grant you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation let's bow our heads together dear heavenly father Lord I'm so thankful that you wrote in your word you had your Apostle James to write it down so we wouldn't miss it that if we lack wisdom Lord that if we ask you that you'll give it to us liberally you unraid it not you'll give to him that ask God in your word you told us to seek after wisdom to get it to buy it not to sell it you told us it was the main thing the principal thing wisdom and understanding God you instructed us on its value and God we're here we're coming to you the Fountain of all wisdom and we're asking L God you would Grant to us wisdom of your word God first I I want to repent Lord for I've taken your word and did things with it you didn't want me to do I did it of my own mind of my own will of my own accord I'm sorry Lord but God I want your mind to be in me I want to surrender my thinking I want to have your mind by your spirit the spirit of wisdom to come and flood me Lord until I know what you want done with your word God in every situation that we face and every obstacle that we come against Lord we don't automatically know what to do they're too complex for us there's too many factors involved there's too many things we don't know but God you're full of wisdom you are wisdom you are the word you are the light you are life you're everything and God in every situation give us the patience and the faith to wait for your spirit of wisdom to come and show us what you want done with your word and may you have preeminence Among Us and get glory for it all may we lord just by that Spirit of wisdom and Revelation surrender in a greater way to you so you can have the preeminence you seek in this hour for God we acknowledge that we lack wisdom and need more and we're coming to you to buy it of you Lord to buy it not to earn it but to give up everything else in exchange for this wisdom to give up our own ideas our own desires our own desire for certain outcomes Lord we give it up now cuz we want to buy and Lord with the wisdom that you've given us Lord we're not going to sell it for anything there's no value in this world there's nothing that can be exchanged for what you've given to us this word and your mind and your spirit and the wisdom that comes with it help us Lord never to sell it Lord for anything that this world has to offer but may we keep it and treasure it may it change us Lord and mold us into your image and bring out of us your very life we love you father we thank you God for keeping your word you're you're not like a man that you should lie but you're God and you do not lie and if you told us that if we ask of you a wisdom that you'll give it to us liberally and I receive it in jesus' name Let It Come to Me Lord every time we play a tape read a book open our Bibles would your spirit of wisdom flood in us and begin to give us wisdom out of the fountain Lord that we may know how to live in this hour that we're upon the Earth we love you God I ask that you bless your children that you would send a special anointing Lord of your wisdom upon them God that we can move away from ourselves more than ever before and surrender like never before may we trust in you in every situation and wait upon you Lord until you speak till you reveal and may you Lord guide us step by step day by day word by word until we finish the work you've called us to do I Love You
