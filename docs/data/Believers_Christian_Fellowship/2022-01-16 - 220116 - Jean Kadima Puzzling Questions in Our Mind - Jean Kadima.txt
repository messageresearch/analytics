========================================

oh lord pray prepare me to be a saint you wearing [Music] trying to [Music] [Music] oh let's all stand and sing it again oh yes lord [Music] [Music] trying to [Music] me [Music] as our brother jean come let's just sing this i love you lord and i live my voice [Music] to [Music] oh my soul [Music] take joy like you oh may it be a sweet [Music] oh let's just sing it again now oh yes [Music]

to be back in the house of the lord um i just spoke to uh brother chad a while ago and he's greeting the church he misses you guys so um the family is doing well sister angie is um not feeling very well so but uh your prayers will will do something so it will heal her so um and god will heal her so we it's a privilege to be here and uh let's keep up pastor in prayer this morning are you ready for the word amen oh i see a preacher here i forget the name i'm sorry my mind went blank yes brother owen uh yes uh he's uh i've seen him at but donnie reagan's church and uh his sister judy's father god bless you so um let's bow our head with a prayer heavenly father we just feel we feel good because you knew this day you knew that your children would gather together to hear your word father you made everything to work out so that we can be here we ask you to take control of the service from the beginning to the end father use us just as a true um god i'll be with us without you we cannot do anything but with you everything is possible when you open nobody closes and when you close nobody opens so we rely on you this morning once again grant to us your grace and mercy as we committing our life to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen um thank you musicians as you are standing up let's just go straight to the word of god we're going to read second corinthians so this morning i would say that i have an exhortation rather than teaching or something when i look at it it's like an exhortation could be good too right so um the theme is always about being sure of our calling and our election and uh that team has been spoken of many many times here even recently so i'm gonna just add my own you know way of looking at things my own words basically but the theme is the same nothing new second corinthians chapter 1 verse 18 okay but as god is true a word toward you was not yea and nay for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by us even by me and sylvanas and timos timotheus was not yea and nay but in him was yea for all the promises of god in him are yea and in him amen unto the glory of god by us now he which established us with you in christ and had anointed us is god who had also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts may god had a blessing to the reading of the word you may take your seats so as i say we need to be certain of our calling we need to be certain of the word that we hear day in day out we need to be sure that this is the true word of god and it doesn't come from man and his impact is tremendous when we bring this word somewhere else you guys are used to this word but when we bring it to some somewhere else ah people get hungry amen and they want more i'm not saying that you don't want more but maybe what i want to say is is not about our ministry but is about the word and the word was always there the message was already there but god has opened our understanding to it and even for people that have been in a message for very long time when we bring it to them they want more amen but think about this if there are questions in our mind if there is anybody on the sideline who still have question in the mind then the word will be nay and and yey and that's a very bad position to be in that's why this morning by god's grace i want the person or persons that may be on the sideline to hear something from the lord that will remove those questions in their mind because this message is true this world has a power of transformation this world will transform our body to go home so nobody should have an a and yet it gotta be yeah yeah yeah [Applause] amen so that's the exaltation i have this morning and i'm calling it uh you know puzzling questions in your mind we will always have questions sometimes we will have a puzzling questions but i'm calling it this way because that's how the prophet calls it they're puzzling because they're paralyzing our faith okay when they paralyze our faith our faith cannot grow if we have this kind of questions it is time for us to go into conference with him it's time to go back to the world and check it because we gotta be certain of what we heard day in day out it's tremendous hallelujah so that's the what we're trying to say this morning i got grace questions and answer in 1959 brother bottom says and now the church has assembled together tonight to worship you we've come to answer questions that's been asked it's it's the sincerity in the heart of the people that these things puzzle them in the mind and lord we do realize that if anything is puzzling us we can never have faith as long as there is a question so we we do not want any questions there will be always a questions but those questions should not puzzle our mind and paralyze our faith if there is it's your duty to seek god to check the word even to speak to brothers and sisters amen [Music] because no one has to have this type of questions now barbara continues lord we see the need of the baptism of the holy ghost among our people and among this church and we don't want any questions in the mind we want it all clear now so that they know what it is when it comes and know that it's for them amen check the word have conference with him bring it to the minister amen oh no brother uh is not the nikolaitan no not all the holy ghost is on the pastor no yes we have greater revelation of god yes but yet still we can still go to the minister to ask puzzling questions we check the word we pray we go into conference with god then we we ask the pastor the minister so that no questions are because we are called to go home amen we don't have answers to all questions if you see one person who has answers to all questions you got to run amen but any question that is a scripture question has a scripture answer anything as an answer in the in the word amen amen are you with me or i don't want to speak to brothers i have some questions maybe what is being preached or something like that but um you know i don't want to be [Music] people write you off and they think that you are not a team player right sometimes i used to be a pastor so i'm not talking about somebody here right all right but people do that and then they're hurting this they're standing on the sideline they have questions in their mind but they afraid of it and then one day because they are not progressing with the pillar of fire as the pillow fire is advancing they're not advancing then when you don't advance you become stagnant amen having questions doesn't mean that you are not a good christian right right no providing his word 1964 for it's possible that staunch christians find people hold sometimes hold to the wrong things thinking it's right so not bad people but good christians you know people filled with the holy ghost ragged christians sometimes they can hold to something that is wrong it doesn't make them wrong right it's just a situation a condition but then these things should be proven whether they are right or wrong and it's the duty of all of us as we are expecting to go to heaven when jesus comes is the minister's duty when any question is brought up that he solved this out and then proves it before the people that they might understand because no one wants to be found wrong holding to the wrong thing if i have a question it doesn't make me a bad christian it doesn't make me a less christian is that right so you see it's an exhortation yeah it's basic right but it's true where you finding the whole congregation sometimes a person there they have so many things questions why this why that when they stay they are sitting on the sideline and keeping just quiet if i ask they will write me off they will think i'm not a good christian and people have tendency of discarding you right so somebody has to talk about something like that right so unto won't you be happy if somebody was sitting on the sideline and here they smoke this morning amen and that bring a solution to them absolutely absolutely absolutely now yes so we have to be sure of what we have received so we have to be sure of what we have received what we have actually received in the world that will bring us home that's exactly right because we have received the invitation which is the shout out we haven't even received the clothes to be in the wedding supper hallelujah so there must not be a question amen proving his word i'm continuing okay see it's the son of man jesus christ will come down in the human flesh among us and will make his words so real that it will unite the church and him as one the bride and and then she will go home to the wedding supper and the verb say amen she's already united see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage fill your flesh itself and all the flesh of mighty men cause the marriage of the lamb has come so you must be sure because the world is uniting with a people right now so that is the rapture of the change in our body is a certain because right now the head has come to unite with the body we are not going to a marriage we are going to the supper and we already received the invitation we have the clothes on hallelujah the devil can exploit anything to paralyze our faith and that's why this morning our exaltation is be sure in what you have received what you hear is the word of god that will bring you to that wedding supper but the rapture is going to the rapture in itself what we call the rapture is going to the wedding supper because the marriage is taking place right now now the wedding is taking place right now but we're going to the supper but there we need clothes is that right we need an invitation we need clothes all right and they have been given to us right now amen where was i when the word here unites with the person they to become one then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theology the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing oh what an assurance right what an assurance amen what an assurance now listen what the prophets say in 1962 present stage of my ministry you say well all men have forsaken me but there is one thing he's stood by me i'm not i wasn't disobedient to heavenly vision that happened down there on the river i've stayed true to it he's been true to me i'm trusting in him someday i don't know when for a crowning of my ministry have stayed just as true as i could amen now he's continue saying that i don't know what it will be i don't know when it will be and i just when is ready i am i don't care i hope it will crown my ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the world and dress is bright in the clothes of the world and for his righteousness oh did he do it did brother branham dress the bride was it just a prayer or did he dress the bride so where is the question then so we receive the invitation which is the shout that gather everybody together the bride together we receive the close of his word now we we are ready to get there without any question and he say i hope ah i hope he will crown me let me stand on that day say behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world did he do it my did the prophet say this is the lamb of god my good think about this when john was told to look for the lamb when he looked he didn't see a lamb therefore if brother burnham said this is the lamb when we turn around we will see a lion are you with me and who is the lion is the king and the king is the judge in israel if you are a king you are a judge do you believe that so he say i will put the claws of the world on the bride and i will like john the baptist who introduced jesus i will do the same i will say here is the lamb and when people turn around they see the lion they see the cloud with the king who is a judge john turned around this did not see a lamb he said he saw the judge amen is so the lion amen so why does the devil put those puzzling questions in our mind of course he has to do that that is work to do and we need our work is to believe amen everyone has to do their job he has to do his job because he sees his days advancing he has to make the doubt in in you and me but i have to stay stand have an answer for him not a conversation with him but an answer for him don't ever have a conversation with him just an answer and keep going amen so as you can see talking about puzzling questions in your mind you can go so many directions what can puzzle a person is not just what they hear it's things in their lives you know situations but all this become puzzling when they attack it they it attack your life it attack the life that is in you it attacked the world that is in you it becomes a problem that's the problem it causes you to doubt the word that you have situation can come i can look at them and say lord i don't understand this but he will not you know this it should not get me to a point where i doubt the word that i received from the lord look at this question that they asked brother branham in 1964 brother branham what seems to be wrong in the day when we are living in the day we when we are living and being a believer and following the message and the messenger today when we cannot seem to pray like we would like to that's a good question i believe brother sister ever who ask it it's a cause of the condition of time the revival is over what revival denominations the revival is over they feel good revival is over are you with me and people we i want i feel like i'm not a christian i used to feel this way it's no longer feel good it's believing the word oh the light the revival has lasted some 15 years and never did last before over about three years i believe it's receiving its last revival okay and i believe we uh that why you can't pray and feel the spirit like you used to it's because the revival fires have gone it's about those type of revivals are gone are you with me it's gone and now it's the word it's a it's the bride revival she is becoming the word and the word alone it doesn't mean she's not happy she has no feel good but those revivals that we're expecting everybody coming yeah yeah yeah let's fill up the church ah everything is wonderful that's not the revival we're looking for it's a men women with christ the word together that's the revival that we're looking for [Music] oh i want that we don't i want a little bit of sensation you know it's over that one is over okay don't expect it but keep the life in you the word yes you will have the joy of the lord in your heart you will still have that you know people listen to the word and you can see them dancing in the bedroom in the woods with this brother what's going on with you my this world is wonderful it has the power of transformation amen amen so sometimes we look into for the wrong things and when we don't see it he puzzles us we have questions now we start questioning our christianity we start questioning what we hear every day we start questioning our church we're such questioning our minister but that's not the word the word has not promised us all this kind of sensation but the word with the individual becoming one and anything can happen in that case is that right anything can happen you don't even have to you cannot even think what can happen buddha venom says it's hard to know what will happen amen are you with me am i the only religious person here all right listen we need to keep the life that is in us that's the revival that we need to keep the life that is in us that life comes from the word amen and i read this uh code uh maybe a long time ago here in 1963 where brother ben talks about how can i overcome and it talks about being in a wood i was crossing an old log the other day down a wash and what is called a hello and i jumped up on this log on the outside it looked good looked like a big old log but when i jump on it and oh great chunk of it fell off it was real rotten daddy and i said that's the way christians have becoming are becoming so they say that they've been dead in sin and trespasses so long till become dirty they can hold no weight at all they don't know what the overcoming means and i begin to think of this text then overcome keep life in you when life went out that's what brought that love to that condition see it made it worse than ever when it laid in the branch where the water was that the branch or the uh the log had life and then it was cut it was laying there and the water came from the rain and pour on that log if life dramatized like the prophet said if the life dramatized from that branch or that log then you will see it will be very strong amen but if the word doesn't find that seed inside then it will start softening because they did not keep the life if i'm standing on the sideline as the word is coming then the word will not have life then the tree of the love will become soft dirty very quickly so hearing the word and the word not finding room inside to dramatize to reproduce according to its own kind will cause that blog too right quickly therefore i need to make sure what i'm hearing find a room in me amen because it will reproduce according to its own kind the kind of the word the word will reproduce the word in me amen and that's that's tremendous praise amen it's christ the word in you and the hope of glory it will reproduce according to its kind which kind is it the word the word kind the word will reproduce the word in you hallelujah amen amen inductment 63 whatever i'm saying oh brother this word is life if you will hold to it look it's not something we talk about that may happen here and after it's something that's already here with us and happening now not something will be something that's already we are not testifying we know that what he has done we know that he's going to do what he's going to do but now we are telling what he is doing see this is our hour it's here it's happening it's our hour keep the life overcoming is doing all we can to keep the life but it's not us it's a him keeping his own word in us but the preacher has to preach it because god keeps his church by the foolishness of the gospel amen amen that's the principle that god set for us somebody has to keep saying this keep the word keep the word no matter what's going on in your life in your family in the church whatever it is keep the word it will reproduce according to its own kind the kind of god amen is he okay i'm screaming i should be more you know okay no ah let's keep the word it comes with principles it comes with christ like life and when people come let them find a place where they can grow and let always pray that god let me be a blessing for someone amen let me just be a blessing to someone because that's what the attributes of christ are this you read it many times so you say blasphemous names so therefore we have no strings nothing to join nothing to do but just to be a christian as e howard carroll used to say we have no law but love no book but the bible no creed but christ that's right come and visit us you know we are happy too we believe the full gospel every bit of the word we believe amen that's what we need to be ask god because the holy ghost is a gentleman you have to ask him you know christ is a gentleman you have to restrain him because he's timid the holy ghost is timid you gotta restrain him and say abide with us amen and he's the one giving you the desire to abide with him but yet he wants you to say i want you to abide with me and whatever you have for me i want it and i mean it amen yes therefore when we look at any situation we have no love but the word all right word the bible brother branham did not preach on the message books you got it it preached the bible so we cannot we should not separate those two things it's the word anything we do we should ask is it the word is it the word give it the word test to see amen is it done in love oh i did this because the words say that but it's done in love amen only you can answer that it is done as christ-like that's the creed you say no creed but christ is that right uh to me i look at it i say ah christ-like amen word love and christ like i'm looking at the time i can't see from here oh it is here all right word give it the word test let it be done with love and it has to be christ christ is the anointing the inspiration and when christ acted you will just see depending on the situation but you will see that what he's trying to always do christ did not come to destroy life but to give life christ set the record right when his parents came to him and said we were me and your father were looking for you with tears he say if i leave this without saying a word that'll be a problem because it will be recorded in the court but the prosecutors say this is jesus father and mother and the defense attorney did not object therefore he will stay in the court record like christ say i am about the my father's business he set the record right and it did not add anymore it was done with love according to the word and christ like has to set the record right and that's what we do sometimes sometimes we may not be understood but i have to set the record right if if i'm given the opportunity i gotta do it because somebody will be misled therefore it's my duty as a minister to make sure that the record is right when i'm given the opportunity your mother and father your mother and your brothers are looking for you oh this will stay in the court record who is my father who is my mother the one that obey to god word the one that received the word are my family otherwise the record will show that jesus family was those people that's right he set the record right amen with love by the word don't you want to be like that anything you do you test it with the word and you make sure it's done with love and the christ-like and christ every situation is different he approached it differently by the word let's call the fire from heaven to destroy them you don't know what you're talking about christ did not come to destroy life but to give life amen he set the record right are you with me yeah woman where are those who are accusing you oh lord i don't know they're gone okay i'm not condemning you too but it could not leave the record that way because the woman will go back do the same thing you say i'm not condemning you either but go don't do it the record is right now amen amen amen everywhere it was barbara i'm saying that even when he went to the pharisees he did not say you pharisees you're gonna die ah i don't care about you i know you don't believe me but i'm saying no he actually went after them and he helped them yeah it's true he did he said verbum say that he went and speak to them help them but also told them the truth you are blind you see that you see christ like oh you are blind many people have want to see what you see they didn't see it you see it and you call it belzebub and something you're blind that doesn't make me a bad brother that brother will you know is so arrogant you know it would tell you off no i'm i'm just it's christ christ brother brenham went to switzerland and uh he was in a breakfast lunch i think according to the biography that uh you know those preachers were telling him brother brother branham we almost believe in your message we want to preach it but we have a problem with the visions your vision there can you explain to us scientific scientifically how do you get the vision because we think is a witchcraft you know what barbara told them at some point he said brother you are blind oh brother does not have love how can you tell a brother that you are blind you better tell the brother with love i guess to you you understand this that's the life of christ in you when the word comes it comes with the word everything now you do by god grace you test it with the word anything you do how i treat people i treat them with love and it's done christ-like amen oh let's go back to where we we came from changing gears again matthew chapter 22 verse 10. i realize there's so much to talk about we will just go how the lord will lead matthew 22 10 so those servants went out into the highways and and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was of a furnish with a guest this is a king who asked people to come to his party or to his feast and the people gave excuses so he asked his servant to go and find anybody just i want my house to be full and when the king came in to see the guest he saw there was there there a man which had no uh not on a wedding garment and he said unto him friend how come his doubt in in either not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then say the king to the servant bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are god but few are chosen amen so i wondered i thought brother branham never answered this question about how can someone get to heaven by the window how did he not go he did not have the clothes that the messenger of the time of this time how do you get to heaven actually when you look closely they did not it's an image all right it's someone trying to go into rapture through a back door a window it won't work revelation chapter 4 1. what is it the bridegroom stand at the door and all comes up with an invitation no man can come to the father except by me all the father has given me or invited will come to me by this time you know you were invited right by the shout amen here come if they come give their invitation the bridegroom so that everybody will look alike they all dress alike by the prophet of the end time amen there's no there's one thing about good all-time holy ghost religion it makes them all look alike yeah because they are the same body and they have the body is in same shape we heard amen whether they are rich or poor bond of free black white male or female they're all one in christ jesus and the bridegrooms stood at the door and received the invitation put the robe around this fellow so the rich and the poor are look alike that's the way it is in the kingdom of god there's no big guys and the little guys they are all one guy all one in christ notice the bridegroom is at the door all right let's go let's keep going so the to get there you got to go through the door yes the door is jesus but he is the word amen let's keep reading now what do you think when the bridegroom come back and found a man sitting there without a wedding garment on say you call him friend [Music] he didn't call son daughter a friend friend how do you get in in here he stood speechless it showed that he came some other way beside the door he came in a window he came in a back door like a virus well only computer people got it and he called him a friend sure he was a church member friend how did you get in here without a garment on so you should have peace right you got the garment you got the invitation you responded you know and you have your clothes you are untitled to get there and you're getting from the door revelation of christ the door amen okay now jesus said this himself and he called to the potter and he said bind him foot in hand and he was cast out into outer darkness where there will be whipping welling and gnashing of teeth that's christ on words right he was cast out because it proved without the wedding garment it came some other way beside the door beside the revelation of jesus christ the word he tried to that's why he didn't get there because it's proved because without the wedding garment it comes some other way beside the door if he would have come by the door he would have received a wedding garment and you have received it yet the devil speak to your mind the devil is a enemy a strong enemy we have to recognize but not the biggest enemy right the biggest is yourself right your human mind is telling you this telling you they are telling you this what is that he want to rob you from that blessed assurance jesus is mine hallelujah now let me look at the door again let me look at the door revelation chapter 4 verse 1. after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was that as it were a trumpet uh talking with me which said come up higher i will show the things which must be after and immediately i was in a spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and either sat was to look upon like a jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow around about the throne in sight like onto an emerald this is very this is tremendous jesus in the book of revelation chapter one he introduce himself and say i am alpha i am omega the beginning and the end is that right which was which is which was which to come that was the introduction it was introducing divinity every denomination will tell you that's jesus when he introduced himself in revelation chapter one everyone believes that then we make another step we realize that they are not three people persons in god that is the only one you say i am the alpha and the omega and all the message believers say amen i introduce why is he introducing himself again in chapter four are you with me before you introduce himself again it brings john to go higher so as john goes higher he sees a door and there he starts describing what was going on there i will say to you john received a greater revelation of the deity of christ that door is the revelation of the deity of jesus christ but a greater revelation now he knows who actually is christ amen the first revelation is the deity the supreme deity of jesus christ that said but why does he call john again and introduce himself again is giving john a greater revelation of actually the deity okay the deity was in the father the deity went in the sun but the deity has come down in human beings and that's the revelation and only through that you got into the door otherwise it is some back door but for his children they receive the fullness of that revelation about who christ is 1964. so you see the whole thing is god becoming tangible everybody believe jesus is the son of god no problem message believers believe that ah there is only one god and he's jesus the father son and holy ghost are function or attributes of the same god but we need to go a little bit higher and if we go higher we'll find that that deity broke down into small and tabernacle in people and that's what we're calling the bride coming of christ it should not puzzle us amen because it's god becoming tangible that one the great great day that to come when christ set upon the throne of david and reign in the millennium it's god tangible in the earth he is now in you not just in the millennium right now that's a greater revelation and we find at the door and to get there to the wedding supper you gotta go through the door the door is a revelation of deity in the way you did not see it before christ any human beings so it should not be something that will scare you issued something that you embrace you say that grace grace grace yes he is now in you you are his attribute you have got eternal life your life always he was and you was god thinking the color of your hair whatever you are you was god thinking you were just materialized that a great revelation of a deity and that god was when he was materialized in christ god displayed manifest in flesh in christ it became material god that he could that we could touch first timothy 3 16 without controversy great is the mystery of godness for god was manifested in in the flesh see it was god being manifested getting ready amen greater revelation amen question is the answer in 1964 and god became material in a man called jesus which was his son the son gave his life that he might bring other sons that god might become tangible working in all in all in that day you will know that i am in the father the father in me i in you and you in me when that day what day today now so i use my i i just repeat what was already said but i you know i put my two cents as they say you know i use my own wordings maybe somebody's sitting on the sidewalk will say oh i never heard that oh you heard it but you didn't hear it so yeah in that day you will receive a greater revelation of christ the door through which you go to the wedding supper invitation received claws on you the door is open a great revelation of a deity that's how god does for the bride john being the bride had to go higher see that divinity made manifest amen and that's what god does is so strange that god always to give a greater revelation he has to bring you come higher it's not strange that the prophet was called on sunset mountain higher to receive a greater revelation of the deity and pass it to us so we can be sure and certain and we will be there because we are already there therefore the word that we receive is not the yea and nay it is yet amen prophet did not like ney and yay we can see here joshua he say and if if it seemed evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom he will serve whether the god which your father served that we're on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorite and whose land we he there dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the lord it's not the time to be unsure it is not the time of cloud of the denominational church age it was a day that was not the day or night but now in the evening time the sun has rise there shall be light in evening time therefore i have to be sure of my calling my election that i will be there yes first king 18 and elijah came unto all the people and say how long hard ye between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if it's bad then follow him and the people answer him not a word being too being under two opinions is not good it is a nightmare what is the nightmare you are not awake you are not sleeping you are in a certain state active is very bad have you ever had a nightmare and god doesn't want that only satan has a position that is not clear but you and i are right now in heavenly places in jesus amen in heavenly places right now positionally placed ready for the change of our atoms nothing will stop us nothing amen only satan has a strange position and the lord said unto satan where cometh down then satan answered the lord and say from going to and fro in the earth from walking up and down what is the position of up and down what is the fraud and two and up and down well he's hiding something you know he doesn't want to say i'm up and down i'm not up and down okay i'm to and fro i'm not doing frau no i am positionally placed in jesus christ reading the manner from above drinking from the rock i am positionally placed amen there is no question about it amen things that are to be and now you are risen with him and manifested attributes of god setting in heavenly places already raised resurrected to the new life and sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus well we are already even raptured resurrected oh my that's that can get somebody dizzy oh that means so much nowadays oh church that means so much today hallelujah this means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in jesus christ therefore it's done now leave it to the devil so i can say where did you go to and fro where i say where to and fro that's not the position confusing now let's look at matthew 11 2. now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples and say unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another jesus instant said unto them go and show john again those things which he do hear and see church if you go by the principle that i just set everything every situation you gotta look at the word right you gotta be done by with love christ-like and christ-like is a is a uh a function that redeems save you know you know when you are down take you you know that's that's the position right so um you see what how is handling this situation john has come and in a public in the whole court open the judges the prosecutors the jury is declaring his question is terrible you know are you the one that uh uh are you the one or do we look for another the record shows that the prosecutor asked if jesus is the one and somebody has to object to it otherwise he will stay on the record that there was a question about his divinity well it set the record right but in a very different way it say go tell john what you see so only john will get the answer john will read between lines he will know that that's him but he will not correct john in the presence of other people because john is a prophet if you want to correct him he will be in a private today people try to correct the prophet who gave you that authority god when he correct moses it was in private let's have a private meeting moses but today people have set themselves as a prophet they will say they will say he made so many mistakes ah we need the holy ghost so the holy ghost is in you to correct the prophet mistakes who give you that authority the fear of god has disappeared from people what a position to be in to say i am going to correct the prophet now you look at jesus and say well tell john this he will understand the blind receive the sight the lamb locked the lepers are cleansed and the death here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them and then it through this bless he is he whosoever shall not be offended in me his faith puzzle is is questions puzzling questions in their mind as they depart jesus begin to say unto the multitude concerning john and jesus start giving a good testimony about john love the word has corrected the love of god for his people is manifested here and he does it all this christ like oh my god help me to be like that what went you out into the darkness to see really shaken with the wind now do why did i highlight this because that was the problem with my human eyes i see john as a reed shaken by wind because he is the one who said this is the lamp now he's asking questioning about it but jesus said no no no no john was not wishy-washy i no no he said he wasn't it's his human mind that was but when i look at him i still see the seed and the light on the seed is just his human mind because his eyes of an eagle is a film over film over you know the situation was so hard it has no precedent in the word that god the prophet can be on earth in prison when the messiah is on earth he could not reconcile it and he baffled him it can happen to all of us and god still see the faith in you the seed has received the light the light was received by you no matter what the your human mind is tricking you giving some tricks but overcoming is to recognize the devil in all his tricks amen and jesus gave his best testimony about john even call him they say no one no prophet like is like him oh my christ like i want to be a christ-like don't you christ-like oh my well i don't want to be sacrilegious but when i look at the situation i kind of become the jones defense lawyer you know you know john did not have you know you know he was in a prison if you have a puzzling question in your mind you go to him jesus but he was in the prison and he was not like they're gonna parole you you know that's the word right they won't give him a break from prison he has no break he's in the prison the problem is since he told his disciples two of them then the disciple came in in the middle of you know gathering and said it but let's say they had like a private email and he has sent the email to jesus i have a puzzling question we will not have all this is that right he has no way to communicate this you know i'm just sharing my mind how my mind works but the fact that everybody heard it jesus has to clean it up but yet he said john was not wishy-washy sometimes we think that when the our human mind is playing tricks on us we think it's us it never asks god when he look into us he sees his seat there and he sees that the seed has received the light and is dramatizing glowing glowing into his own kind the kind of the world for there is no condemnation for those who live in christ all right there is no condemnation thank you lord 1963 you know this brother da oh i think it was from lima is that right that was from lima i was looking for a story that i heard about him in the message i could not find it but he was so old and weak and he's telling brother brandon brother brandon i'm getting old i'm getting weak 91 91 years old he said do you think i'm ready to die do you think i'm ready to go do you think i'm saved but abraham look at this man and say when this man heard the message his seed instantly received the light instantly but yet he's still asking himself am i saved by the venom but i'm saying well what the doctor will do when you go to him he will do a checkup let's do the checkup so he goes and check the word with him and by the brother say i believe it he said well the head special you say that uh you passed the test it was very simple sometimes the word is simple do you believe the word of your time you say yes you pass oh no people no it's very simple that the clothes for the wedding supper [Music] so i was looking for one time when uh i don't know if it was somebody telling me or i read it in the message it was like brother dawg when maybe the next day when brother brennan went to look for him he had his body covered with bibles anybody had seen that i don't know maybe it was a testimony covered with bible everywhere that hurt open bible the head open bible the um open bible because the word of god promised healing amen but i'm saying that what but a dog was trying to do was to quieten his human mind and sometimes that's what we do we're trying to quieten our human mind now we have all these puzzling questions we just try to do that but the salvation is certain there is no question about it any longer amen our life will always have questions some things that we just don't have the answer some days our life turned upside down sometimes you start even questioning your christianity it's not you it is your human mind playing tricks have you ever thought about sister hattie wright we call her height right her name was mosher her husband name but never called her her husband name always call her a father's name [Music] this sister should have a puzzling question in her mind you know you get married god gives you two sons and it takes the husband living with what did she have a safety net no husband children those boys need a father they need an authority figure she could have questions but they had those questions in her mind never never had an impact on her on her spiritual life is that right but if she could come to you or to me and say look at my situation brother my husband died i have two sons to ride to raise my sister is sick my parents are i'm getting old i have to take care of them i don't know why god left me in this condition we could cry with her and we will not be wrong sister we pray with let's pray together it's a puzzling question puzzling questions and situations come to every christian you know why because we still living in the filio love now this is what brother brahm says he must be born again but without that eternal life this fellowship life it will fade away it had a beginning it will have an end but with eternal life it can no more die than eternity can itself and what is eternity a perfect sickle cycle that has no end uh just revolves it he started it laying around this way you go through the table through the floor through the earth it's a still a perfect cycle and god had no beginning or had an end and when he puts that spirit in us in this flesh that he has brought from the earth and our fellow love has become to a place that it's overrode by a gappy love that we got eternal life in this calcium and potassium that's been fed and brought from the earth and how much more can the god who made it raise it up again therefore you must be born again think about this it's so good that the word is promising us that this affiliate love that we have that make us feel the way we feel give us those puzzling questions my children are hungry i don't know how i'm gonna bring you know we're gonna pay the bills at the end of the month all these things are part of the failure but god is is saying that the world that we're carrying every day will make that feel your love being overwritten by the agape not something we do but something that comes from god that word you hear will start decreasing the feeling with the human side of things and making the agatha the god love to increase and increase and we can see what was happening with sister hattie right it was like that agape has increased so much even though she's suffering but she doesn't see it don't you want to be that place smart people have this pyramid ah we slow whatever okay now a human being need food that's the basic they need food to live they need a shelter safety net they need the social only when the bottom of the pyramid is taken care of then you can go higher is that right no wonder when harty wright said the right word brother branham told her you have basic needs you need money to buy food it's uh it's not bad to ask god for money that basic need society you need health it's not bad to ask god for good health she could even ask god for her husband why not because the children need it that was not on her mind because the feeling of love was being overwritten by the agape and it goes slowly you to have it it's not just sister hat right you made decisions in your life because of the world same thing with sister hattie right your priority was him amen therefore you acted like him maybe not her maybe you had to go to a certain job but you say it will keep you far from the church and you will not hear the word or anything that you made a decision for him you acted like her and the more we hear the word that feeling love that makes us to be earthfully bound will start decreasing so we can become a little lighter and go up there it's not something that we do is something that he does you can ask her for food it's a basic need you can ask her for this well if the prophet say that she could ask for money then it was good think about it if sister had to write ask her for money who will call her less spiritual no you see that sister that cadillac you see that their sister is a very special sister she got the cadillac with the third pool she asked god and the god dropped a couple of millions of dollars just drop this you count them they really come from the federal reserve bank real they're real because god has banks everywhere in the water everywhere pact of 20 100 and we will all look at you right that the most spiritual sister in the world every visitor that comes i'm gonna show you a special system don't stare don't stay she's over there we will never think that she asked the wrong thing but he was a god doing in her if she has asked god for a husband but i'm saying i give you the husband in the name of the lord jesus christ well we all have husbands but that one the third poor husband we will still think that she's spiritual don't you absolutely it's the prophet who told us otherwise we will not know but what was happening is the word working in her therefore the the issues of life become dim they did not have met value she after she asked for the salvation of her sons she's still going through difficult times not enough money maybe not enough food the parents are old the sister is sick and brother is praying and the sister is not healed she still have all these problems but the priorities have changed and he didn't do it by himself is god doing sister hearty right had a different pyramid are you with me in this pyramid the base is the fate the basic need without them i cannot go higher is a faith in the word of god in your time she didn't do it by herself christ in her we're doing that i want this i want this don't you amen so to these all things we are saying is not an effort a human effort will power it's the word and yet is the word that the devil attacked every day your enemy attack every day your enemy is certain but it's not the greatest enemy the greatest enemy is your human mind amen but to be sure about it there's no yeah nays just yay god gave us a greater revelation of who he is and that is the door that was open in heaven we did not go by the window or the back door we went by the word of god revealing our time god and the human being god become tangible in the human being that's what we're calling the coming the bright coming of christ and you standing on here you say you are on the sideline i come to church i hear pastor chad always talking about bride and dress and you know and and it's puzzling your mind but you don't go check the word you don't give it a test a word are you sitting there i should not say anything but you're dying the word is keep coming on you every day the lord the lord will become softer it's better to address it it's better to go into conference with god it's better to check the word because you gotta be certain of your calling in a recollection sure about what you hear every day there should not be any question about it time is so late we cannot play church churchianity is over christianity by the way is the vocabulary that brother branham created is no perfect word praying church is over it's a a matter of life and death if god is god let's worship god we don't want to be found coming from the window that the denominational system it won't go the stag is a stagnant thing and stagnant water smell bad i come from africa i know what i'm talking about you see stagnant water on the street this street some streets don't have uh asphalt whatever yeah so the water becomes stagnant then you see it change color you become a little green mosquito comes frogs all kind of beings start making the dwelling there and that's how christianity is when the world doesn't find life therefore you see somebody today in 10 years they have regrets but we are called to a greater revelation if we receive it as the pillar of fire is going if moving we move with it oh the bible becomes a new book christ is stopping knuckling in the human being we are not presumptuous it's a truly christ tabernacling and that's the bright coming of christ is not arrogance it's the truth said in love as christ like christ like said said christ like amen amen well i'm so i'm start going to close so your pizza will still keep hot i don't want to pick it on brother chad's office and say this brother takes long time don't put him again so sister hat is not the only one you too you have cut things that had value for you you did like her when you you stopped bringing those movies from your home you were doing like her if you get those entertainment or that music what you were doing was because of the kingdom of god i'm cutting my right hand my right arm is that what jesus said the email imagery is really graphic jesus said that if is your right hand that makes you s sin chop it off that's why i chopped off these movies and that music i chop it off oh you could cut it a little bit nicely so well it doesn't matter it's chopped anyway yeah you may be right that i can do better but if i consider it as a stumbling block the point is i cut off oh yeah if a surgeon came you could you could do this and take this part well it's still ugly that's the point the point is i'm cutting it off no matter how i do it i did cut it off because of the love of christ in me amen do you believe that did it make sense to you a puzzling question in your mind is a paralyzing question what does it paralyze your faith whatever the devil attack you in the natural or in the spiritual the purpose is to reach your soul and steal that seed from you and my duty i know you want by the word you won't do it because you are part of god but i still have to preach about it because that's the way god made things the foolishness of preaching that's what it is do you believe that okay let's stand the musician can come one day i was invited at the pentecostal church they had like a service it was like a group of they call them prayer group of prayers and charismatic and they start talking at the end they start asking questions maybe to the preacher i knew where i was was not my land i have to respect them they invite me i will be quiet i will say a word which i did but they keep talking asking questions they came to the point of asking about william branham oh here how come william brennaman they start talking about things you know penny putting me down well it was a question and answer so it was not like a preaching right so i have to speak because i have to straight the record right if i did not say something will you call it love do you understand that we have to set the record sometime we got to do it no matter how it hurts we have to you provoked me to speak so i spoke of course i taught them with love okay love i'm sorry uh i'm sorry i'm sorry but that's how he works yeah christ's like [Applause] and one of them followed me amen one of them followed me we baptized him is that right my wife because yeah that's true she is my memory oh don't you love that when the life of christ is new you will pass anything through the test of the world you will do it in love how do i treat that brother that i disagree with or with love but it has to be christ like christ's life is not always soft it can be shame on you brother i love you shame on you doing this you know better brother it's the love amen the motive and the objective amen because no one should be left behind we all have to go amen what well amen not in trying but entrusting it's not in running but in resting it's not in one drink but in praise that we find the strength of the lord [Music] i trust [Music] but in that we praise the strength of the lord [Music] is [Music] let's pray heavenly father there will always be in a christian life puzzling questions the thing that we don't understand we put them together with the word of god it sometimes doesn't make sense but the word tells us that all the things these trials and tests and things they are precious even though when we are going through them we can't can't understand but they should never reach our faith in your word god this morning we just pray that you give us that overcoming power that we can keep the life and the life is in the word and the word of this hour that you sent to a vindicated prophet let us keep the word [Music] no matter what our enemy [Music] no matter what our mind stay with me if there is something that [Music] puzzling us let's bring everything to god in prayer let's check the word and every question a scriptural question has a scriptural answer let just go into conference with you check the word speak to the minister do everything that you say in your word that we should do because we need to keep this life [Music] it's actually you keeping it we sometimes we just need to quieten the spirit our spirit which is an unbeliever standing between it's a make believer standing between the unbeliever and the believer father help us to know how to overcome help us to know the devil in all his tactics help us to stand by the word and stay in the line because it's over it's already over it's done god be merciful to us if there was anyone on the sideline hurting maybe questions the question this the question that but they don't say anything in the name of the lord jesus i pray for them i pray that there will be no one found in that position father that's not a good position to begin through your grace and mercy help us help us the issues will come all kind of things will come let us stay with the world because it's more precious than all the trials that we can have [Music] god grant to us your grace and mercy bless again our pastor be with him his family sister angie and all family grace and mercy be upon him give him strength so he can feed your flock again granted father through jesus christ we pray amen [Music] we've been made more than conquerors [Music] victoria through the blood of jesus christ oh we've been made more than conquerors [Music] we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus christ [Music] and [Music] through the blood of jesus christ go one more time [Music] we've been made more than conquerors [Music] oh we've been made victories [Music] you are my strength when i am we you are the treasure that i see you are my [Music] [Music] you are my [Music] jesus [Music] is your name [Music] oh taking my sin my cross my shame rising again [Music] you are my oh [Music] worthy is your name jesus [Music] is yours oh you are my strength when i am weak you are the treasurer that i see you are my [Music]
