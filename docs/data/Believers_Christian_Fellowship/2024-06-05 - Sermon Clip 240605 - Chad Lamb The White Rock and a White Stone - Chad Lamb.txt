TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the seventh angel who's the seventh angel and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seven Church age which is William brandham which is also the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7 and that day yes sir amen the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed amen they're not going to be revealed later they're going to be revealed under his ministry amen amen then he and then comes to the leosan church age out of the church age book he says now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truth that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers what what does that mean that means the seventh angel the Elijah of Malachi 4 amen has to be the one who brings the revelation of the seven Thunders not another man not anybody else it has to happen in his ministry under his sounding he's got to bring the revelation of the seven Thunders and if you don't have the revelation of the seven Thunders you don't have the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 he can't be Malachi 4 without the opening of the seventh seal he can't be Malachi 4 without the coming of the Lord he can't be Malachi 4 without the revelation of the seven Thunders because it takes these revealed mystery truths to literally fulfill Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers so you can't have brother branam as Malachi 4 and not having amen as the one who reveals the seven Thunders amen it doesn't work if he did not in his sounding reveal the seven Thunders then he did not fulfill Malachi 4 so if the Seven Seals not open he wasn't who he said he was and who we believe he is if Christ hasn't come he's not who he says he is and not who we believe he is so it's we we've come to the place in the message it's all the way or nothing amen it's either right or it's not right we can't hang up halfway anymore he's either who we believe he is and who he says he is and who God vindica him to be or we need to go start something else because you can't mix this with your own thinking anymore it's got to be the Fulfillment of the word amen still tons of things we don't understand all kinds of questions I got I I I I agree there's still things that he's got to unfold things I don't understand things he said I don't comprehend but that doesn't change anything he has got to be the seventh angel that's on Earth at the time of this coming when the mighty Angel comes down with an open book in his hand and the Seven Thunders are revealed which reveals the mysteries of the Seven Seals that's the time he has to be here and then it has to be finished when he's here
