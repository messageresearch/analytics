[14:09] with me to the end.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus,

[14:28] Jesus, [singing]
[14:29] Jesus,
[14:31] precious [music]
[14:33] Jesus.
[14:34] Oh, [singing] for grace to [music] trust
[14:38] him.
[14:42] That's [music] where the Chad comes.
[14:43] Let's go to B flat. Shut in with God.
[14:46] Shut [singing] in [music] with God
[14:51] in [singing] a secret
[14:55] place. [music]
[14:57] There [singing]
[14:59] in the spirit
[15:01] be holy
[15:04] his [singing and music]
[15:05] face
[15:07] gave [singing] me [music] new power
[15:11] to run [singing]
[15:13] in the race.
[15:16] I [music] long
[15:19] to be shed [singing]
[15:22] [music]
[15:26] [music and singing]
[15:28] with God
[15:31] in [music] a secret [singing]
[15:34] place.
[15:36] There
[15:38] in [music] the spirit
[15:41] beholding [singing]
[15:43] [music] his face.
[15:46] gaining [music] new [singing] power to
[15:51] run in the race.
[15:55] How [singing] I long
[15:57] to be [music] sh
[16:00] with God.
[16:03] Amen. Let's bow our heads together
[16:05] [music] and pray. Lord Jesus, God, we
[16:09] want to shut in with you right now and
[16:12] enter into [music] that place, Lord,
[16:13] where we can commune with you and you
[16:15] with us and you can feed us, Lord, your
[16:18] word. [music]
[16:19] God, we're asking you, we're inviting
[16:21] you, Lord, to come to the head of the
[16:23] table now as we sit to dine. That you
[16:27] would take the bread of life and you
[16:28] would break it, Lord, and pass it to us
[16:30] and feed us by your own hand, Lord. For
[16:33] we are the sheep of your pasture and
[16:35] you're the great shepherd of our souls.
[16:37] [music] And God, we've come to you,
[16:39] Lord, out of reverence and respect. Now,
[16:41] we've sung your praises because we love
[16:43] you. We want to glorify your name. Now,
[16:45] we long to feed from you that portion
[16:48] that you have. May you reveal yourself
[16:49] to us again this morning. May you take
[16:52] these lips of mine under your control.
[16:53] [music]
[16:54] May you speak eternal words, precious
[16:56] words of life. May they proceed forth
[16:59] into the hearts of your children. Lord,
[17:01] may you have preeminence among us. May
[17:03] you have your way as you move, Lord, in
[17:05] this place and in our hearts and in our
[17:06] lives. For we want [music] you to have
[17:08] that first place. We thank you for this
[17:11] opportunity. We pray you'd bless all
[17:13] that's said and done. In Jesus Christ's
[17:15] name we pray. Amen.
[17:19] Amen. God bless you. Man, while you're
[17:21] standing, if you want to turn with me to
[17:23] the book of Luke. Amen. We'll begin
[17:25] there. We just want to say God bless you
[17:27] and good morning. And we're very happy
[17:29] to have brother George Wyinners with us.
[17:31] Amen. All the way up from Louisiana.
[17:33] Amen. His name is Wyinners, but he lives
[17:35] in warm Louisiana. So, he's getting a
[17:36] little pretaste of our winner. Amen. And
[17:38] as I mentioned uh to you last service,
[17:41] Brother George is going to be sharing
[17:42] his testimony with us before communion
[17:44] here at the communion service. Uh and
[17:47] we've been familiar with Brother George
[17:48] for many years as he's worked in Japan.
[17:51] And we've been involved as a church with
[17:53] that work. And him and I have been
[17:54] sharing for quite a quite a while. and
[17:56] he's got an amazing testimony of what
[17:58] God has done in him and through him and
[18:00] and the work that he's used him for and
[18:02] the burden that he has. And so I'm
[18:04] excited for him to come this evening and
[18:06] share that. Uh brother Ron won't be
[18:08] giving his missionary report. This will
[18:09] take the place of that. And so just come
[18:12] expecting and and enjoy what uh
[18:14] listening to what God can do through a
[18:16] vessel. Amen. And and I enjoy hearing
[18:18] his testimonies. Also, he brought with
[18:20] him his pastor, Brother Jeremy Kner.
[18:22] He's the pastor there in Manning,
[18:23] Louisiana. And it didn't dawn on me till
[18:26] today when I was thinking I was going to
[18:27] introduce this pastor that when when
[18:30] brother Brandham went along with Banks
[18:31] Woods Hunting, that old man said, "Have
[18:33] you got so low down woods that you got
[18:35] to pack your pastor with you everywhere
[18:37] you go?" I thought, "Man, they must not
[18:39] trust you away from home, brother. They
[18:41] send the pastor to look after you." But
[18:43] but God bless you, brother Jeremy. It's
[18:44] good to have you here, too. And we'll
[18:46] have brother Jeremy this evening also
[18:48] just greet everybody and say hello and
[18:50] bring greetings from their home. So the
[18:52] communion service will be this
[18:54] afternoon. We have communion and feet
[18:55] washing after the testimony.
[18:58] Amen. So let's look here at the book of
[19:00] Luke chapter 18. Luke chapter 18.
[19:10] Luke 18:E8.
[19:17] He says, "I tell you that he will avenge
[19:19] them speedily. Nevertheless, when the
[19:21] Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith
[19:24] on the earth? It's a good question.
[19:27] Shall he find faith on the earth? Let's
[19:29] turn to Hebrews 11 now.
[19:39] Hebrews chapter 11
[19:44] and then we'll read verse 6. Hebrews 11
[19:47] and 6. But without faith it is
[19:49] impossible to please him. For he that
[19:52] cometh to God must believe that he is
[19:54] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[19:57] diligently seek him.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; Now turn with me to Ephesians.
[20:02] We'll read one more before we take our
[20:04] seats. Ephesians chapter 2.
[20:12] Ephesians 2 and8.
[20:16] For by grace are you saved through faith
[20:18] and that not of yourselves. It is the
[20:21] gift of God. Amen. God bless you as you
[20:24] take your seats.
[20:26] Amen. So we find out that Jesus asked
[20:30] when the son of man cometh.
[20:33] We know the coming of the son of man is
[20:35] the same time as the revealing of the
[20:36] son of man. And we've seen that. Amen.
[20:38] Through the prophetic ministry of
[20:40] brother Brandham. And when the son of
[20:41] man cometh, shall he find faith on the
[20:44] earth? That's the question. So when the
[20:46] son of man cometh, what is he looking
[20:47] for? Amen. He's looking for faith.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; That's what he's looked for in every
[20:51] age, in every dispensation. He's looked
[20:53] for his children that will believe his
[20:55] word. That's what he found in Abraham.
[20:56] Somebody who will believe. That's what
[20:58] he found in Noah. That's what he found
[20:59] in Moses. Somebody that would believe
[21:01] his word. And in this time when the son
[21:03] of man cometh, shall he find faith on
[21:05] the earth. And then in Hebrews, Paul
[21:08] tells us that without faith, it's
[21:10] impossible to please God. Amen. There's
[21:12] not works that we can do. There's not
[21:14] not any system that we can hold to or
[21:16] anything that we can do in ourselves to
[21:18] please him. Without faith, it's
[21:20] impossible to please him.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; So, will he find faith on the earth?
[21:25] Because that's the only thing that will
[21:27] please him.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; But then in Ephesians 2, the Apostle
[21:30] Paul says, "For by grace are you saved
[21:32] through faith and that not of
[21:34] yourselves. It is the gift of God." Oh,
[21:37] I thank God that he's given a gift that
[21:39] will meet the requirement. If the
[21:41] requirement is faith, God's given a gift
[21:43] that'll meet the requirement.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. If we could bring up
[21:46] the PowerPoint, please. Amen. We'll
[21:49] we'll start. I want to title this the
[21:50] real gift. And I'm going to taking this
[21:52] right from a quote. I'm going to read
[21:54] that quote to you next. And that's
[21:55] that's where the title comes from. The
[21:57] real gift. Something Brother Brandham
[21:58] said, and I want to take a look at it.
[22:00] And I've got quite a few uh uh quotes
[22:02] and scriptures I want to go through.
[22:04] Amen. I thank God for the PowerPoint so
[22:06] I can move fast and we can all stay
[22:07] together. Amen. But but pay close
[22:09] attention. And there's just something
[22:11] really profound in my heart. And it's I
[22:13] I say profound, it's not profound. It's
[22:15] simple. It's something we talk about all
[22:17] the time, but it keeps hitting me again
[22:18] and again and again. Amen. So, I love to
[22:21] talk about it because this message has
[22:23] come. It's unveiled so much for us. It's
[22:25] given us a reality, amen, that
[22:27] transcends everything we see, everything
[22:29] we can touch, everything we feel. Amen.
[22:31] There's a greater reality that we live
[22:33] by
[22:34] &gt;&gt; than the realities of this natural world
[22:36] and natural eyesight or even humanistic
[22:38] thinking. There's something that's been
[22:39] delivered to us that takes us far beyond
[22:41] all of that and it's a marvelous thing.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the message, things that are to
[22:47] be, brother says, I got the baptism of
[22:49] the Holy Ghost. That still has nothing
[22:51] to do with it. That is a statement,
[22:54] friends.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[22:57] That still has nothing to do with it.
[22:59] That's just only a temporal gift for
[23:01] you.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; The real gift is your soul down in
[23:05] there. seed that was born of God and
[23:07] that controls the whole thing through
[23:08] the word of God and the will of God and
[23:11] there you grow up see then you're a son
[23:12] and daughter of God you're a child of
[23:14] God and these things as you come up like
[23:16] the mother now you're in the bowels of
[23:18] the earth trying to come forth you're a
[23:20] son of God coming forth and you see the
[23:22] word say I should do this I should be
[23:24] born again well I belong to the church
[23:27] that don't mean one thing I'm a
[23:29] Methodist my that's good for your mother
[23:31] well my I'm Pentecostal I belong that if
[23:34] you don't line with that word, there is
[23:36] something wrong.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Then you see your real father ain't God.
[23:40] Because that real start in your soul
[23:42] before there even was a spirit, it was
[23:44] your soul. That soul didn't come from
[23:46] God. Then it wasn't a germ of God to
[23:48] begin. You're deceived.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; So just saying, "I've got the baptism of
[23:53] the Holy Ghost." He said, "That has
[23:54] nothing to do with it."
[23:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's a magnificent statement
[23:58] that the prophet made. And the only the
[24:00] only reason I'll say it is because he
[24:01] said it. Amen.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what he's showing us is
[24:04] you you can have the baptism of the Holy
[24:06] Ghost. Amen. And that can be an
[24:08] anointing that falls upon you and can
[24:10] even move you to expressions that are
[24:12] scriptural expressions. Amen. But but
[24:14] the real gift, the real thing is not the
[24:17] gift of the Holy Ghost. The gift of the
[24:19] Holy Ghost is the wake up the real gift
[24:21] which is a gene of God that's in your
[24:22] soul.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; That's the real That's what brother said
[24:25] is the real GIFT IS THAT SOUL. AMEN. And
[24:28] and that's what the baptism of the Holy
[24:30] Ghost came for. It came TO WAKE UP THAT
[24:33] SEED of God that is laying there dormant
[24:35] to bring it to life. Amen. To bring us
[24:37] to the realization of sons and daughters
[24:38] of God to quicken us and to grow us into
[24:41] the manifestation of sons and daughters
[24:43] of God. So the real gift is that soul.
[24:47] Amen. And if he said if you don't line
[24:51] with that word there's something wrong.
[24:53] You can have all kinds of manifestations
[24:55] and all kinds of gifts. Amen. And
[24:58] there's nothing wrong with the gifts,
[24:59] but the gifts without this gift.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; The gifts without the real gift. Amen.
[25:05] It it won't bring about what we want it
[25:08] to bring about. It won't accomplish what
[25:09] we're hoping to accomplish. Amen. So be
[25:12] that real start in your soul. Before
[25:14] there even was a spirit, it was your
[25:16] soul. That soul DIDN'T COME FROM GOD.
[25:18] WHY DIDN'T IT COME FROM GOD? If it won't
[25:19] cope with the word, it didn't come from
[25:21] God. Then it wasn't a germ of God to
[25:24] begin with, and you're deceived.
[25:26] He says in the message leadership the
[25:28] choice of your conduct you can't mix it
[25:31] now you're either for God or against God
[25:33] and the outward expression shows exactly
[25:35] what's on the inside the Many of you
[25:38] think I got the baptism of the Holy
[25:40] Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't
[25:42] mean one thing that you're going to
[25:43] heaven no sir you can have the baptism
[25:46] of the Holy Ghost every hour in your
[25:48] life and still be lost and go to hell
[25:50] the Bible says though Uh-huh that's
[25:52] exactly right it's another one of those
[25:56] Unbelievable statements. I grew up in
[25:58] the Pentecostal church and we would have
[26:00] never said anything like this. But we
[26:02] got a prophet who understands so much
[26:04] more. Amen. He's tapped into the mind of
[26:06] God. He's the veil's been taken off of
[26:08] the word. He's understanding exactly
[26:10] where he's standing. And he knows
[26:12] exactly what he's saying is the truth.
[26:14] Amen. You can have the baptism. The
[26:15] baptism means a dip and immersion. You
[26:18] can have a dip and immersion in the Holy
[26:21] Ghost. True, genuine Holy Ghost. But the
[26:23] dip and immersion in the Holy Ghost is
[26:25] meant to wake up or quicken a seed of
[26:28] life that's already on the inside. And
[26:30] you can be dipped, immersed, amen, uh,
[26:33] submerged into the atmosphere of the
[26:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost. But if
[26:37] there's nothing there to quicken,
[26:39] nothing will quicken.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WASN'T THE TRUE
[26:42] HOLY GHOST. IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU WEREN'T
[26:44] immersed in the true Holy Ghost. Amen.
[26:46] BUT BUT THAT THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE
[26:49] ISSUE. The issue is what is the HOLY
[26:51] GHOST FOR? WHAT DID IT COME to do? IT
[26:53] COME TO WAKE UP THAT SEED. IT COME TO
[26:55] INDWELL WHERE THAT SEED IS AND BRING
[26:57] LIFE TO IT AND GROW IT INTO THE FULL
[26:59] STATURE of Jesus Christ
[27:02] &gt;&gt; in our lives.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Not just an anointing, but anointing to
[27:07] do something
[27:08] &gt;&gt; to accomplish a purpose. Now, look at
[27:11] this scripture. We we've looked at this
[27:12] here recently. Matthew chapter 7 said, '
[27:15] Not everyone that saith unto me,Lord,
[27:17] Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of
[27:19] heaven, but he that doeth the will of my
[27:21] father which is in heaven. Many will say
[27:24] to me that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
[27:26] prophesied in thy name? And in thy name
[27:29] have cast out devils, and in thy name
[27:31] done many wonderful works. And then will
[27:34] I profess unto them, I never knew you.
[27:37] Depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
[27:40] This is an outstanding scripture. As we
[27:42] we talked about a couple services ago,
[27:46] they're coming to the white throne
[27:47] judgment. This is a scene of the white
[27:49] throne judgment, and they're talking to
[27:51] the the King of Kings, the Lord of
[27:53] Lords. And at the white throne judgment,
[27:55] I said this before, nobody's lying.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Nobody's standing before God at the
[28:00] light throne judgment and making
[28:01] anything up. And Jesus doesn't discount
[28:03] or disregard anything they say.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; So, we can take from this scripture that
[28:08] they really did do these things. Amen.
[28:10] They said, "Many will say to me in that
[28:12] day, Lord, Lord, HAVE WE NOT PROPHESIED
[28:14] IN THY NAME?" LISTEN, THEY'RE CALLING
[28:16] him Lord, declaring that he's their
[28:19] Lord. They know who he is. They know who
[28:21] Jesus Christ is, and he's their Lord.
[28:23] And they said, "We have prophesied in
[28:25] thy name."
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; AND IN THY name have cast out devils.
[28:30] And in thy name done many wonderful
[28:32] works. Listen, if we if we live a life
[28:35] on this earth where we CAN CALL JESUS
[28:38] CHRIST our Lord, Amen. And then we can
[28:41] by his name prophesy and it come to
[28:44] pass. AND BY HIS NAME CAST OUT devils
[28:46] and they go and by his name do many
[28:48] wonderful works and signs. Amen. We may
[28:51] get the feeling of security because
[28:53] we're taking the Lord's name and
[28:55] ACCOMPLISHING GREAT WORKS. BUT THAT WAS
[28:57] NO SECURITY for these guys.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS NEVER JUDGED HIM FOR THEIR
[29:05] good works.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER SAID DEPART FROM ME. HE NEVER
[29:09] SAID YOU DIDN'T DO those things or
[29:11] because of those things. THOSE THINGS
[29:13] WERE FINE. AMEN. NOTHING WRONG WITH THE
[29:15] PROPHECY, THE CASTING OUT DEVILS, the
[29:16] many mighty works. THOSE WERE FINE. BUT
[29:19] WHY DID HE CAST them out? He said, he
[29:22] said, "Depart from me, ye that work
[29:24] iniquity."
[29:27] This is why, Amen. This is why they were
[29:32] sent away from the presence of the Lord.
[29:34] Because brother Bam tells us, iniquity
[29:36] is when you know to do something and you
[29:38] don't do it.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; There is something in the word. THEY SAW
[29:42] THE WORD, BUT they didn't obey the word.
[29:45] Although they had many signs and
[29:46] wonderful miracles and these works are
[29:49] done by the Holy Ghost.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; But yet they were in iniquity.
[29:57] Iniquity because there was some part of
[29:59] the word that they were refusing.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[30:03] Praise God.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; All I say is God help us.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Help us Lord.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in things that are, our
[30:12] brother said in things that are to be.
[30:13] Now there will be false anointed ones in
[30:15] the last days. Not false Jesus. They
[30:18] wouldn't stand for that. But false
[30:19] anointed. They are anointed. Yes, sir.
[30:21] But they are antichrist. They're
[30:23] anointed with the spirit to do the signs
[30:26] and wonders that Christ did, but won't
[30:28] line up with his word.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; So they're anointed. Brother said a true
[30:33] spirit,
[30:35] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; And they're anointed to do the signs and
[30:38] wonders that Christ did, but won't line
[30:41] up with his word.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; See, it's another type of deception
[30:46] where you can have selfdeception,
[30:48] thinking that we're okay because the
[30:50] works, because the miracles, because the
[30:52] signs, Amen. But they won't line up with
[30:55] his word. And when they wouldn't line up
[30:57] with his word,
[30:59] because they weren't line up with his
[31:00] word, brother Brandham says that they're
[31:03] antichrist
[31:05] &gt;&gt; because Christ is the word. To be
[31:07] against the word is to be antichrist.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to John chapter 3 together.
[31:28] John chapter 3
[31:31] verse one
[31:37] said there was a man of the Pharisees
[31:39] named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews. The
[31:42] same came to Jesus by night and said
[31:44] unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou are
[31:47] a teacher come from God, for no man can
[31:49] do these miracles that thou doest except
[31:51] God be with him."
[31:53] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[31:54] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[31:56] a man be born again, he cannot see the
[31:59] kingdom of God."
[32:01] Nicodemus saith unto them, "How can a
[32:03] man be born when he is old, can he enter
[32:06] the second time into his mother's womb
[32:08] and be born?" Jesus answered, "Verily,
[32:11] verily, I say unto thee, except a man be
[32:14] born of water and of the spirit, he
[32:16] cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[32:19] That which is born of the flesh is
[32:20] flesh, and that which is born of the
[32:22] spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said
[32:24] unto thee, Ye must be born again. The
[32:27] wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
[32:30] heareest the sound thereof, but cast not
[32:32] tell whence it cometh, and wheither it
[32:34] goeth. So is everyone that is born of
[32:36] the spirit. Nicodemus is coming by night
[32:39] because he's afraid of of his
[32:41] colleagues. And he comes at night to
[32:43] talk to this great rabbi who he knows is
[32:46] a man sent from God because nobody can
[32:48] do the works that he does unless God be
[32:50] with him. And Jesus says, "Listen, but
[32:53] unless you're born again," Amen. You
[32:55] cannot see the kingdom of heaven. You
[32:57] can't even see it. Then later he says,
[32:59] "You can't enter into it."
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; So you don't even have eyes to see,
[33:03] Amen. that that what the kingdom of God
[33:05] is unless you're born again. And
[33:07] Nicodemus, amen, with a carnal mind, he
[33:10] doesn't understand this term being born
[33:12] again. He said, "How can I, who am
[33:14] already old, go back into my mother's
[33:17] womb and be born a second time?" What do
[33:19] you mean by born again? And Jesus says,
[33:21] "That which is born of the flesh is
[33:23] flesh, born of the spirit. You have to
[33:24] be born of water and of the spirit."
[33:26] He's talking about spiritual birth. The
[33:28] new birth is a spiritual birth. And why
[33:30] does there have to be a new birth? Amen.
[33:33] Brother Bam tells us so clearly. It's
[33:35] because our first birth is wrong.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; We come a perverted way. Amen. God never
[33:41] intended for us to come by sex desire
[33:43] where man decides by his own will when
[33:46] to procreate. Amen. That was not God's
[33:48] design. So there was a fall in the
[33:50] Garden of Eden and that brought a
[33:51] hybridization and through that
[33:53] hybridization in the self-will of man
[33:55] brought a perversion. Brother Benham
[33:57] said God made a world to take you out of
[33:59] to be a human being to be a son and
[34:01] daughter of God. Amen. And it WAS
[34:03] PERVERTED THAT WAY. GOT PERVERTED. He
[34:06] said, "You came anyhow. You came wrong,
[34:08] but you came anyhow."
[34:10] &gt;&gt; SO, WE CAME WRONG. SO, OUR FIRST birth
[34:13] birthed US INTO DEATH. AMEN. THAT'S WHY
[34:15] WE MUST BE BORN again because of the
[34:17] fall in the Garden of Eden. The new
[34:19] birth is vindication of serpent seed
[34:21] doctrine.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; That's the reason you have to be born
[34:24] again is because the first birth is
[34:26] wrong.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; So, we have to be born by the spirit.
[34:30] The spirit of God, amen, has to quicken
[34:33] that seed to life. And look at verse
[34:35] eight.
[34:37] The wind bloweth where it listeth,
[34:40] and thou be hearest the sound thereof,
[34:42] but cast not tell whence it cometh and
[34:44] whether it goeth. The wind that passes
[34:47] through, Amen. If it's passing by you,
[34:50] you can feel the wind as it's moving.
[34:52] You can hear it rustling through the
[34:54] trees or moving around whatever object
[34:56] is near you. You can hear, see, feel the
[34:59] effect of the wind. But the wind is
[35:01] invisible. It's an invisible force and
[35:03] you can't tell where it came from and
[35:05] you can't tell where it's going.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; And Jesus didn't say this is what the
[35:11] spirit's like. No, he's not saying
[35:12] that's what the spirit's like. He says
[35:15] so is everyone that is born of the
[35:18] spirit. So the actual individuals that
[35:21] are born of the spirit are like the
[35:22] wind.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; You can see them here present. You can
[35:26] see, FEEL, HEAR THE EFFECT OF THEIR
[35:29] LIFE. BUT YOU DON'T know where they came
[35:30] from or where they going. Because where
[35:32] they came from is invisible to you. And
[35:34] where they're going is invisible to you.
[35:36] WHEN YOU FEEL THE WIND, TRY TO GUESS
[35:38] WHERE THE WIND CAME FROM.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; WHERE DID IT COME FROM? AMEN. WHERE DID
[35:42] THE WIND GOING TO? WHERE DID IT START
[35:44] AND WHERE'S ITS DESTINATION? YOU'LL
[35:46] NEVER FIGURE IT OUT. AMEN. AND NOBODY
[35:48] THAT KNOWS YOU CAN FIGURE OUT, AMEN.
[35:50] WHERE YOU CAME FROM AND WHERE YOU GO.
[35:52] BUT there was one there's one thing in
[35:54] creation that knows where it came from
[35:56] and where it went to and THAT'S THE WIND
[35:58] ITSELF BECAUSE IT CAME FROM SOMEWHERE
[35:59] and it's going from somewhere. AND
[36:01] SPIRITUAL BIRTH CONNECTS US BACK TO OUR
[36:04] ORIGIN WHERE WE CAME FROM AND IS
[36:06] DECLARING TO US WHERE we're going.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; WE CAME FROM ETERNITY. WE'RE GOING BACK
[36:10] TO ETERNITY. AND JUST LIKE THE WIND CAME
[36:13] FROM SOMEWHERE, WENT TO SOMEWHERE, BUT
[36:15] MADE ITSELF MANIFEST IN THE PRESENT
[36:17] TIME. THAT'S LIKE EVERYONE THAT'S BORN
[36:19] OF THE SPIRIT. THAT'S LIKE YOU AND ME.
[36:21] AMEN.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; We're just LIKE THE WIND. I CAME FROM
[36:24] SOMEWHERE. AMEN. I DIDN'T JUST APPEAR
[36:25] HERE. I CAME FROM SOMEWHERE. YOU'RE
[36:28] SENSING MY PRESENCE. YOU'RE
[36:29] ACKNOWLEDGING I'M HERE. AMEN. BUT YOU
[36:32] CAN'T TELL WHERE I CAME FROM OR WHERE
[36:34] I'M GOING. BUT I KNOW BY SPIRITUAL BIRTH
[36:37] WHERE I CAME FROM AND WHERE I'M GOING.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING BACK TO WHERE I CAME FROM.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. It's a mystery to everybody else
[36:47] on the earth.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But the spiritual birth brings us
[36:50] back in contact with our origin.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; So
[36:56] God says you must be born again.
[37:00] You must have this spiritual new birth.
[37:05] But in order to be a birth there has to
[37:06] be a seed.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; In the church age book, brother Bam says
[37:13] this in the Smyrnan church age. Now then
[37:16] there we are coming to a conclusion.
[37:20] As the eternal logos, God was manifest
[37:22] in the son and in Jesus dwelt all the
[37:25] fullness of the godhead bodily and the
[37:26] eternal one was the father manifest in
[37:29] flesh
[37:31] and thereby [clears throat] gained the
[37:32] title of son. Even so we eternal in his
[37:37] thoughts and our turn became the many
[37:40] membered spoken word seed manifest in
[37:42] flesh. And those eternal thoughts now
[37:45] manifest in the flesh are the sons of
[37:48] God. Even as we were so called, we did
[37:52] not become seed by the rebirth. Do you
[37:55] see that all in capital letters? Are we
[37:56] reading the same thing? We did not
[37:58] become seed by the rebirth. We were seed
[38:02] and therefore were reborn. For only the
[38:05] elect can be reborn because we were seed
[38:09] is the reason we could be quickened. In
[38:11] nonseed there is nothing to quicken.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; So both seed and nonseed can experience
[38:17] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But the
[38:19] seed when they experience the baptism of
[38:21] the Holy Ghost it quickens the seed to
[38:23] life. Amen. In nonseed there's nothing
[38:26] to quicken although they can experience
[38:28] an immersion in the Holy Ghost.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Again this is next paragraph he says
[38:38] hold this carefully in mind. Now take
[38:40] the next step. Redeem means to buy back.
[38:43] It restores to the original owner. God
[38:45] by his death, the shed blood bought back
[38:48] his own. He bought back the spoken word
[38:50] seed bride. My sheep hear my voice.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Word. What's his voice? His word.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; What's his word in this day? The message
[38:59] of the hour.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; If you hear the message of the hour,
[39:01] that's his voice. If you hear his voice
[39:03] and follow, you're a sheep.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:07] Oh man, I just I just I like to just
[39:10] inject this right here. LISTEN, THE
[39:12] PROBLEM WITH ALL OF US and so many of us
[39:15] in our carnality and humanity, we go
[39:18] into look into a natural earthly mirror
[39:20] and we we analyze ourselves and we find
[39:22] within ourselves reasons why we should
[39:24] not be children of God.
[39:27] We find all kinds of complexes and and
[39:29] all kinds of habits AND WE GOT THOUGHT
[39:31] PATTERNS and we've got traditional
[39:33] thinking from our parents and genetic
[39:35] malformities.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[39:37] &gt;&gt; WE GOT ALL KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT US THAT
[39:40] WE JUST don't like. And we can analyze
[39:42] that in the in the natural mirror and we
[39:45] can come up with a list of many reasons
[39:47] why there's no way I can be a sheep. I
[39:49] can't be a child of God. I can't do this
[39:51] and that. Amen. But the Bible never uses
[39:54] that as an identification of sunship.
[39:56] The identification of sunship is always
[39:59] if you can hear his voice.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "My sheep hear my voice,
[40:06] ANOTHER THEY'LL NOT FOLLOW." WHEN YOU
[40:08] HEAR THE VOICE OF THE SHEPHERD AND
[40:10] CHOOSE NOT TO FOLLOW ANY OTHER VOICE,
[40:11] BUT FOLLOW THIS VOICE, IT IS AN
[40:13] indication you're a sheep. It doesn't
[40:15] matter how deformed you are, how many
[40:17] limps you have, if you've got lice.
[40:19] Amen. IF YOU GOT EAR MITES, IF YOU'RE
[40:21] BLIND, IF YOU'RE DEAF, IT DOES NOT
[40:24] MATTER THE QUALITY OF THE SHEEP. THAT'S
[40:26] GOD'S SHEEP BECAUSE IT'S FOLLOWING THE
[40:28] SHEPHERD.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO STOP LOOKING INTO A NATURAL
[40:33] MIRROR AND ANALYZING OUR CARNALITY TO
[40:36] DETERMINE WHAT WE ARE. WE'VE GOT TO DIG
[40:38] A LITTLE DEEPER BY FAITH AND SAY, "WHAT
[40:39] IS IT THAT I BELIEVE?"
[40:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice word and they
[40:47] follow me. You always were a sheep. You
[40:51] never were a pig or a dog turned into a
[40:53] sheep. That is impossible for every kind
[40:56] of life produces the same kind. And
[40:58] there is no change in species.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; As we were in the thoughts of God and
[41:03] then expressed in flesh. There had to
[41:05] come a day when we would hear his voice,
[41:07] the word
[41:08] &gt;&gt; and hearing that voice become aware of
[41:11] our father calling us and recognize that
[41:14] we are the sons of God. We heard his
[41:17] voice and we cried out as did the
[41:18] prodical son, "Save me, oh my father.
[41:21] I'm returning to thee."
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Now look at this part of this quote.
[41:26] Amen.
[41:27] And his voice, which is the word, we
[41:30] became aware of our father calling us.
[41:32] When we heard the voice, when we heard
[41:34] the word for our day through a prophet
[41:36] messenger brought us the voice of God,
[41:38] the word of God. Amen. And when we heard
[41:41] that voice, [snorts] we recognized our
[41:44] father.
[41:46] calling us.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; We didn't recognize a preacher
[41:49] preaching. We didn't RECOGNIZE A PROPHET
[41:52] PROPHESYING. AMEN. WHAT WE recognize
[41:55] when we heard that word and RECOGNIZED
[41:57] THAT THAT IS absolutely the TRUE WORD OF
[41:59] GOD. WHAT YOU HEARD WAS YOUR FATHER
[42:02] calling you.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND THE DEVIL WILL TRY TO TELL
[42:05] YOU, WELL, YOU JUST HEARD A good
[42:06] preacher and you agreed with it and it
[42:08] SOUNDED GOOD TO YOU. WHY DID IT SOUND
[42:10] GOOD TO YOU? WHY DID YOU AGREE WITH IT
[42:12] WHEN MILLIONS HAVE WALKED AWAY AND
[42:14] MILLIONS HEARD IT AND DISCOUNTED IT AND
[42:16] DISCREDIT IT AND DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND
[42:17] OF IT, BUT SOMETHING IN YOU RESONATED
[42:19] WITH THAT VOICE AND YOU SAID, "THAT
[42:21] SOUNDS LIKE TRUTH TO ME." THAT'S NOTHING
[42:22] BUT THE TRUTH. WHAT YOU WERE RECOGNIZING
[42:25] WAS YOUR FATHER CALLING YOU. IF THAT'S
[42:27] YOUR FATHER, THEN YOU'RE A SON. WHO'S
[42:29] THE FATHER CALLING YOU? GOD ALMIGHTY
[42:32] MAKING you a child of God.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; WE MAKE IT SO COMPLICATED. WE GET SO
[42:43] TWISTED UP IN OUR MINDS. WE GO OUT
[42:45] TOMORROW and we make a mistake at work
[42:47] and we say something wrong and we do
[42:48] something that WE REGRET AND ALL OF A
[42:50] SUDDEN WE SAY, "I I I MUST NOT BE ONE OF
[42:52] THEM." LISTEN, YOU MAY BE THE WORST SON
[42:55] HE'S GOT. YOU MAY BE DISOBEDIENT AND
[42:57] REBELLIOUS AND NEED ALL KINDS OF
[42:59] CORRECTION, BUT YOU'RE STILL A SON OF
[43:00] GOD.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; SHOW ME ANYONE THAT WAS PERFECT. SHOW ME
[43:04] THE GOOD ONES. AMEN. IT'S NOT GOOD
[43:06] CONDUCT THAT HE'S LOOKING FOR. IT'S
[43:07] FAITH THAT HE'S LOOKING FOR. WHO CAN
[43:09] HEAR HIS VOICE? WHO CAN BELIEVE HIM?
[43:14] &gt;&gt; SO, brother J, SHOULDN'T IT CHANGE OUR
[43:15] CONDUCT? ABSOLUTELY, it should change
[43:17] our conduct.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IN A CHANGE.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; I believe in THE NEW BIRTH IS A CHANGE
[43:22] that your nature's changed. YOUR DESIRES
[43:24] HAS CHANGED. YOUR CONDUCT CHANGES. BUT
[43:26] BROTHER SAID, YOU STILL GOT AN OLD
[43:27] STICKY COCKA burn nature THAT'S GOING TO
[43:29] BOTHER YOU AS long as you're in it.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; He said you're going to MAKE MISTAKES.
[43:35] HE ALSO SAID, "THERE'S TRAPS SET FOR YOU
[43:37] AND YOU'RE GOING TO FALL INTO THEM."
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. I'm so glad he said
[43:42] it.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he fell into traps himself
[43:46] and told us about it so we can realize
[43:48] that the path of a son or daughter of
[43:50] God, it may not be perfection as we call
[43:53] perfection and it may not be clean the
[43:54] way we think's clean. But God is not
[43:56] looking at perfection and conduct. God
[43:58] is looking at faith.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; He sent his spirit. He sends his word.
[44:05] He's constantly molding us and changing
[44:06] us and bringing us into his image. He's
[44:09] giving us the power to live the word by
[44:10] the power of his spirit. He's giving us
[44:12] overcoming power. And he's changing us
[44:14] from glory unto glory. It's a process
[44:17] where we're growing in his likeness.
[44:18] Amen. And as we're growing in his
[44:20] likeness, Amen. We may not we may NOT
[44:22] FIRE ON ALL EIGHT cylinders all the
[44:24] time, but we should be changing,
[44:25] friends.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. But where's my identification
[44:31] coming from? his voice.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; And the resonant inside of me that says
[44:38] that's the truth.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Peter tells us, "Being born again, not
[44:46] of corruptible seed." I I'm going to I'm
[44:50] going to write this out. I've done this
[44:52] many times.
[44:54] Corruptible seed.
[44:56] What's that?
[44:58] natural seed
[45:02] &gt;&gt; from your first birth,
[45:06] &gt;&gt; but of incorruptible.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Incorruptible what? Seed.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; What's the incorruptible seed? The seed
[45:14] gene
[45:16] &gt;&gt; of God.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; We're not born again. Nicodemus said,
[45:21] "Can I go back into my world?" No.
[45:23] That's corruptible seed. That's
[45:25] perversion. But we're born again of the
[45:28] incorruptible seed. And how? We're born
[45:32] again by the word of God which liveth
[45:37] and abideth forever. The word of God
[45:38] come. Amen. And the spirit of that word
[45:40] comes to wake up that incorruptible
[45:43] seed. That's how we're born again. When
[45:44] the spirit comes in contact with that
[45:47] seed,
[45:48] &gt;&gt; it quickens it to life.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's keep moving. I think yeah
[45:58] in the Smyrna church a said a son of God
[46:00] can go a long time before he recognizes
[46:02] that he's a son
[46:04] &gt;&gt; in fact a lot of true Christians are
[46:06] like the story of the baby eagle that
[46:08] was hatched out under a hen you know
[46:09] that eagle is a type of the true
[46:11] believer tells this story over and over
[46:13] and you guys if you've been around the
[46:15] message for any length of time you've
[46:16] heard it numerous times but it's just as
[46:18] good the thousandth time as it was the
[46:20] first
[46:22] &gt;&gt; because God says that you know A farmer
[46:24] wanted to set a batch of eggs and and so
[46:27] he had one egg short. So he climbed up
[46:29] into an eagle's nest and he took one egg
[46:31] out, put it under the hen. The hen sat
[46:33] there and hatched it out. And there was
[46:35] all these chicks plus one little eagle.
[46:37] And the eagle was a misfit all of his
[46:39] life. Thought he WAS A CHICKEN.
[46:42] IDENTIFIED with the chickens, lived in
[46:44] the barnyard, ate, scratched, tried to
[46:46] do everything they DID, BUT IT WAS
[46:48] ALWAYS KIND OF A MISFIT for him until
[46:50] one day another eagle come flying over
[46:52] the barnyard and screamed. And when the
[46:54] eagle screamed, something in him
[46:57] connected to the scream.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; And the the chickens were afraid of the
[47:01] scream. They ran and hide. The eagle
[47:03] looked up and said, "WHAT IS THAT SOUND?
[47:07] &gt;&gt; I've never heard ANYTHING LIKE IT." AND
[47:09] WHEN THEY IT SCREAMED, SOMETHING INSIDE
[47:10] OF HIM SCREAMED BACK THAT RESONATED
[47:13] INSIDE. IT WASN'T A FEARFUL SOUND. IT
[47:15] WAS A WONDERFUL SOUND. IT WASN'T A
[47:17] CONFUSING SOUND. IT WAS THE SOUND THAT
[47:19] WAS FINALLY ENDING HIS CONFUSION.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; AND HE LOOKED UP AND HE SAW MAMA EAGLE
[47:26] AND SAID, "MAMA, HOW COULD I GET UP?"
[47:28] JUST FLAP YOUR WINGS. YOU WERE BORN TO
[47:30] FLY. YOU'RE MADE TO BE THIS. YOU'RE AN
[47:32] eagle to begin with.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; And brother tells this story over and
[47:36] over many times. And here in the message
[47:38] it is the rising of the sun. He says and
[47:40] God knows
[47:42] he's got a predestinated for ordained
[47:44] church. He know he's got sons and
[47:45] daughters and a bride waiting somewhere
[47:48] when the Holy Spirit begins to fly over
[47:50] at that wave sheath. That wave sheath
[47:52] was the first part of the word to come
[47:54] to full harvest maturity. And we saw
[47:56] that in the ministry of brother
[47:57] Brandham.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; And that wave sheep waved over. He said
[48:01] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[48:03] forever. Not some mythical story but a
[48:05] reality. No matter how many tried to
[48:08] tell him eagle, he didn't know what an
[48:10] eagle was. Yet he was a eagle. He would
[48:12] not understand it until he seen
[48:14] something that reflected him, that he
[48:16] reflected rather. And when we see not a
[48:19] denomination, not a PhD, not an LLD, not
[48:22] a good neighbor, but a son of God molded
[48:24] in the image of God with the dynamic
[48:26] power of God to answer the requests of
[48:28] this day that he's the same yesterday,
[48:30] today, and forever. There ain't no h
[48:33] going to hold you. We saw that God
[48:36] manifests that through brother Brandham.
[48:39] He says he hunts for his mama. He's an
[48:41] eagle to begin with. He recognizes this
[48:43] real eagle recognizes the call of God's
[48:45] word. Why? He's an eagle. An eagle to an
[48:49] eagle. The word before the foundation.
[48:51] The word to the word. The word
[48:54] predestinated to the word written for
[48:56] the hour. You realize your position. So
[48:59] now brother takes it from the story of
[49:01] eagle screaming to eagle screaming. Now
[49:03] he takes it from a predestinated word.
[49:05] That's you.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; If you're a child of God. Amen. What is
[49:09] that C gene of you? It's a thought of
[49:10] God. It's a word. It's a thought
[49:12] expressed inside of you. And that word
[49:14] has got to connect with the word written
[49:17] for the hour.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; The predestinated word has to come in
[49:21] contact with the word written for the
[49:23] hour.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; The word predestinated to the word
[49:27] written for the hour. You realize your
[49:29] position. He hunts for it.
[49:32] Then this earthly body is quickened and
[49:34] brought by the quickening spirit of God
[49:35] to obedience to the word.
[49:38] Amen. We can't get this backwards. We
[49:41] can't bring obedience to the word and
[49:43] then have quickening power. It takes the
[49:45] quickening power of the spirit of God to
[49:47] bring this body in obedience to the
[49:48] word.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to realize
[49:54] what we are, who we are, where we came
[49:56] from.
[49:58] Luke 19. Let's turn here together.
[50:11] Luke 19
[50:15] [snorts] and verse one.
[50:21] [snorts]
[50:22] It says, "And Jesus entered entered and
[50:25] passed through Jericho. And behold,
[50:27] there was a man named Zakius, which was
[50:29] the chief among the publicans, and he
[50:31] was rich. And he sought to see Jesus,
[50:34] who he was, and could not for the press,
[50:36] because he was little of stature. And he
[50:38] ran before and climbed up into a
[50:40] sycamore tree to see him, for he was to
[50:43] pass that way. And when Jesus came to
[50:46] the place, he looked up and saw him and
[50:48] said unto him, "Zakius, make haste and
[50:51] come down, for today I must abide at thy
[50:54] house."
[50:55] And he made haste and came down and
[50:57] received him joyfully. And when they saw
[50:59] it, they all murmured, saying that he
[51:01] was gone to be guests with a man that is
[51:03] a sinner. And Zakius stood and said unto
[51:06] the Lord, "Behold, behold, Lord, the
[51:10] half of my goods I give to the poor. And
[51:11] if I have taken anything from any man by
[51:14] false accusation, I restore him
[51:15] four-fold." And Jesus said unto him,
[51:18] "This day is salvation come to this
[51:20] house. for as much as he also is a son
[51:23] of Abraham. For the son of man has come
[51:25] to seek and to save that which was lost.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[51:33] if
[51:35] Jesus didn't come
[51:38] to convert goats into sheep.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; And Jesus didn't come to find sheep.
[51:47] Jesus came to find his sheep.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "The son of man
[51:56] seeketh to save that which is lost." He
[51:59] said, "The son of man has come to seek
[52:01] and to save that which is lost."
[52:05] &gt;&gt; You can't lose something that you didn't
[52:07] previously have.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; So, this is my pen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; If I lose my pen, I can look all over
[52:16] and I say, "Oh, here's the pen that I
[52:19] lost. This is my pen.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; But if somebody else lost this pen and
[52:24] it was never my pen
[52:26] &gt;&gt; and I come by and say, "Oh, there's my
[52:29] pen." That's not my pen.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; This is somebody else's lost pen.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; It's not my lost pen.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; And Jesus came to find his lost sheep.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; He come in contact with all kinds of
[52:45] Pharisees and all kinds of Sadducees and
[52:47] scribes and religious men and political
[52:50] figures and they were dressed nice and
[52:51] acted right, paid tithe and did all
[52:53] kinds of stuff. Amen. But but none of
[52:56] them would follow his voice, proving
[52:58] that none of them were his sheep.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; They rejected his voice on every hand
[53:03] proving they were not sheep of his fold
[53:05] because his sheep hear his voice and
[53:06] another they'll not follow. Amen. So now
[53:09] he's looking for his sheep. And it's
[53:10] amazing the places that Jesus goes
[53:13] looking for his sheep cuz he knows where
[53:14] they are.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; It takes him TO A WOMAN THAT'S CAUGHT IN
[53:18] IN MULTIPLE MARRIAGES, CAUGHT in
[53:20] adultery, in a cycle of adultery. He
[53:22] takes her to a well. TAKES HIM TO THE
[53:23] BOTTOM of the tree where Zakius is
[53:25] hiding. Listen, there's not another soul
[53:27] in Israel that believes Zakius
[53:31] &gt;&gt; is seed of God.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Jesus goes to his house,
[53:36] he said, "How can he go and eat with
[53:37] somebody who's a sinner? HE WAS A
[53:39] PUBLICAN. AND BY HIS OWN CONFESSION, HE
[53:42] was robbing the people."
[53:45] &gt;&gt; SAID, "LORD, IF I HAVE DONE ANYTHING, IF
[53:47] I'VE TAKEN ANYTHING, I'LL RESTORE FOR."
[53:49] LISTEN, HE'S SAYING, "I'VE TAKEN FROM
[53:51] PEOPLE.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; I've been ripping OFF MY BROTHERS AND
[53:54] SISTERS." And they hated him for it.
[53:56] Amen. And nobody was looking at Zakius.
[53:58] Zakius wasn't acting like a believer. He
[54:00] wasn't pretending to be a believer. He
[54:02] wasn't doing any deeds of righteousness.
[54:04] But Jesus wasn't looking for people
[54:06] doing deeds of righteousness. He came
[54:08] looking for his lost sheep.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; AND HE COME UNDERNEATH A TREE and he
[54:14] STOPPED
[54:16] &gt;&gt; AND HE LOOKED UP. ZAKIUS WAS SMALL OF
[54:18] STATURE, DESPISED.
[54:21] LISTEN, IT'S ONE THING when a big hulk
[54:23] of a man robs you blind, but when this
[54:25] little pipsqueak
[54:28] &gt;&gt; is stealing your money and cheating you
[54:30] out of taxes. Listen, I imagine the
[54:33] discussions at home when men was what
[54:35] I'd like to do to that Zakius.
[54:40] He was hated. He was despised. Jesus
[54:43] looked up said, "Zakius, come down
[54:47] for today I'm going to eat with you.
[54:51] What was he look? He was he was finding
[54:53] his lost sheep.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Goes in to eat with him and everybody
[54:57] else is just mesmerized, disappointed,
[55:00] uh uh upset, whatever they were that he
[55:04] went to eat with the sinner. But Zakius
[55:06] was overjoyed. There was something about
[55:08] coming in contact with the living word
[55:10] that did something to the inside of
[55:12] Zakius. And they sat there to eat. And
[55:14] it doesn't tell us what Jesus said. It
[55:16] doesn't say what the discussion or the
[55:18] dialogue was at the table. But whatever
[55:20] happened there at that meeting, he came
[55:22] in contact with the word for his day. He
[55:24] came in contact with the living word
[55:26] made flesh. And when Zakius contacted
[55:29] that, Kakas all of a SUDDEN REALIZED,
[55:31] I'M NOT WHAT I want to be. This isn't
[55:32] who I am. I'm not going to be this kind
[55:34] of person anymore. And he stands UP AND
[55:36] SAYS, "LORD, AMEN. WHATEVER I'VE DONE,
[55:39] I'M GIVING IT AWAY. I'M CHANGING ALL OF
[55:41] THESE THINGS." AND JESUS SAYS,
[55:44] "BEHOLD,
[55:45] salvation has come to this house for as
[55:48] much as he also is a son of Abraham."
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus was not looking at his natural
[55:54] lineage. He wasn't going back through
[55:55] birth records to determine he was a son
[55:57] of Abraham because he already had a
[55:59] dialogue in John chapter 8 with a whole
[56:01] bunch of children of Abraham who he said
[56:04] were not children of Abraham. And he
[56:06] said, "I know you're the children of
[56:08] Abraham, but if you were the children of
[56:09] Abraham, but you're the children of the
[56:11] devil."
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; HOW WAS HE DETERMINING WHAT THEIR
[56:14] LINEAGE WAS? BY HOW they handled the
[56:16] word for their day.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN ZAKIUS RESPONDED TO THE LIVING
[56:21] WORD IN HIS PRESENCE AND STOOD UP AND
[56:23] CONFESSED HIS SINS AND WAS going to make
[56:24] IT RIGHT AND WAS OVERJOYED AT THE
[56:26] PRESENCE OF THE WORD in his home, JESUS
[56:29] SAID, "THIS is the son of Abraham."
[56:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to LOOK AT HIS BIRTH
[56:34] RECORD. THIS SAY, "WHO WAS YOUR FATHER?"
[56:36] HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY THIS WAS A SON OF
[56:38] ABRAHAM. AND GUESS WHAT? YOU AND I,
[56:40] AMEN, WE MAY NOT HAVE A DROP OF JEWISH
[56:42] BLOOD IN US, BUT WE ARE CHILDREN OF
[56:44] ABRAHAM BY WHAT? BY FAITH. FAITH IN
[56:47] WHAT? THE WORD OF GOD. AND FAITH IN THE
[56:49] WORD OF GOD DECREES OUR LINEAGE. WE CAN
[56:51] GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO ABRAHAM. AND ALL
[56:53] THE PROMISES OF OUR FATHER ABRAHAM
[56:55] BELONG TO US
[56:57] &gt;&gt; BY WHAT? FAITH. By faith.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God, friends.
[57:05] He says, brother says here, if I taught
[57:09] you Methodist message, it would take no
[57:11] effect on you.
[57:14] This is bride time.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; If Moses taught the message of No, it
[57:18] would take no effect. If Jesus taught
[57:20] Moses' message, it would take no effect.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; If Jesus taught
[57:26] Moses' message,
[57:30] &gt;&gt; they were all saying, "We have Moses. We
[57:32] believe Moses. They were reading Moses,
[57:35] declaring Moses, following the law Moses
[57:37] gave. It was all Moses, Moses, Moses.
[57:40] Whenever Jesus was interacting with the
[57:42] with with the Pharisees, but if Jesus
[57:44] taught Moses message, it would have no
[57:47] effect.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Y
[57:49] &gt;&gt; because the predestinated seed are
[57:51] laying there that will only be watered
[57:53] by that type of water that's give for
[57:55] that seed.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; It won't grow any other condition. And
[58:00] it must be the condition that grows it.
[58:04] That seed gene of God has always been.
[58:08] It's come in every dispensation in every
[58:10] age programmed for the age it came in.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; And that seed of God will only respond
[58:17] to the word of the dispensation of the
[58:20] word for that age.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; That's what it's programmed for.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we can't go back and
[58:27] preach denominational doctrine anymore.
[58:29] We're beyond the denominations.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; This is bride time. This what we have
[58:34] now is something different. And there's
[58:35] a message that's been sent out to
[58:38] contact and find the sheep.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Yep. AMEN.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; AND MY SHEEP WILL HEAR MY VOICE. The
[58:44] word. WHAT WORD? AMEN. NOT A
[58:46] DENOMINATIONAL WORD, but the word FOR
[58:48] TODAY,
[58:49] &gt;&gt; WHICH IS CHRIST HIMSELF.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; The person of the word.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; It won't grow in any other condition. It
[58:57] must be the condition it grows in.
[58:58] Listen, Zakius being an Israelite, being
[59:02] a Jew, no doubt he heard preaching
[59:04] before.
[59:06] [snorts]
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Anybody believe that?
[59:09] &gt;&gt; No doubt he heard preaching before, BUT
[59:11] IT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM CHEATING his
[59:12] brethren AND BEING A CROOKED tax
[59:14] collector.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. THE WOMAN AT THE WELL
[59:18] DECLARED TO JESUS THAT SHE HAD BEEN
[59:20] TAUGHT, THAT SHE WAS RELIGIOUS, THAT she
[59:22] had been to church BECAUSE SHE SAYS,
[59:24] "LISTEN, I'M CONFUSED ABOUT RELIGION.
[59:26] Our fathers, which are the Samaritan
[59:28] fathers, Amen. Tell us that on this
[59:30] mountain we should worship because Jacob
[59:32] was here and this is the mountain. But
[59:33] the Jews tell us that in in Jerusalem we
[59:36] should worship. Listen, this woman came
[59:37] in contact with a man that began to
[59:39] discern her life and tell her how many
[59:41] husbands she had and who she was living
[59:43] with now. AND THE FIRST QUESTION SHE
[59:45] COULD THINK TO ASK WAS, "WHAT IS the
[59:47] right way to worship God?"
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, SHE WAS CONFUSED ABOUT SPIRITUAL
[59:52] RELIGIOUS TEACHING. AMEN. She had heard
[59:54] it, but it didn't awaken her. THE
[59:57] TEACHING SHE HAD NEVER gave her
[59:59] OVERCOMING POWER TO OVERCOME THE CYCLE
[1:00:01] OF OF ADULTERY THAT SHE WAS TRAPPED IN.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; SO, SHE HAD RELIGIOUS TEACHING. THEY HAD
[1:00:07] QUOTED MOSES TO HER. AMEN. BUT SHE
[1:00:09] INSIDE OF HER WAS A SEED GENE OF GOD
[1:00:12] THAT WAS PROGRAMMED for a certain
[1:00:14] manifestation of that word. And the
[1:00:16] previous manifestation wasn't bringing
[1:00:17] it to life BECAUSE SHE WAS STILL TRAPPED
[1:00:19] IN HER ADULTERY. AMEN. UNTIL SHE CAME IN
[1:00:22] CONTACT WITH THE LIVING WORD.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; WHAT CAME HER WAY? JESUS CHRIST. JESUS
[1:00:27] CHRIST THE WORD MADE FLESH. THE
[1:00:29] FULFILLMENT OF THE PROPHECY. WHAT MOSES
[1:00:31] HAD TAUGHT. WHAT JEREMIAH PROPHESIED.
[1:00:33] WHAT EZEKIEL SAID WAS COMING. HERE HE
[1:00:35] WAS STANDING IN THE FLESH. HE COME TO
[1:00:37] THE WELL to meet what HE'S LOOKING FOR.
[1:00:40] LOST SHEEP.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT A THIEF. HE DOESN'T STEAL
[1:00:44] SHEEP. THESE ARE HIS SHEEP ALREADY
[1:00:46] BEFORE.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:53] And the dialogue they have is
[1:00:55] ridiculous.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:01:02] He says, "Give me some water."
[1:01:06] She says, "We're not supposed to
[1:01:08] interact with each other. You're a Jew.
[1:01:10] I'm a Samaritan." said, "If you knew the
[1:01:12] gift of God and who it was that saith,
[1:01:14] you give me water, you would ask me and
[1:01:16] I'd give you living water that you come
[1:01:17] and thirst to the one you thirst no more
[1:01:18] and you draw no more."
[1:01:21] She said, "Sir, give me of this water."
[1:01:25] First, she says, first she looks, she
[1:01:27] says, "But the well is deep and you have
[1:01:30] nothing to draw with. You don't have a
[1:01:31] bucket. You don't have any. How are you
[1:01:33] going to give me water?" He said, "No,
[1:01:34] no, no, no. The water that I give you
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; shall be a well of living water
[1:01:39] springing up within you." Yeah.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; unto eternal life. And she says, "Give
[1:01:44] me this water."
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is not a normal preaching
[1:01:49] service.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "Okay, I'll give you the water
[1:01:56] when you go get your husband."
[1:02:00] What does this have to do with anything?
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; And she says, "I have no husband." He
[1:02:05] said, "You've said, right, for you've
[1:02:06] had five, and the one you're with now is
[1:02:08] not your own.
[1:02:10] And she looked at him. Listen, when he
[1:02:13] told her she was wrong, she did not get
[1:02:16] offended.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; She did not say, "How dare you? Don't
[1:02:20] you understand my circumstances? Don't
[1:02:21] you know I was turned out as a child? I
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; What right do you have to bring that
[1:02:26] out?
[1:02:28] [snorts]
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Oh man, that's that's a that's that is a
[1:02:31] a a prick in the thigh of a side of a
[1:02:34] Leodysian."
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. [clears throat]
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; True. He told her exactly where she was.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; And she says,
[1:02:44] "I perceive you to be a prophet."
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; She was waiting for a moment like this.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; She was stuck in a religious cycle that
[1:02:57] was giving her nothing to overcome. She
[1:02:59] had been to church. She had heard the
[1:03:01] teachings. She had heard the debates
[1:03:03] between the Jews and between the
[1:03:04] Samaritans and understood what the what
[1:03:05] the conflict was all about. And she
[1:03:07] couldn't figure out was the Baptist
[1:03:08] writer, was the Methodist writer, were
[1:03:10] the Catholics writer, were the
[1:03:11] Pentecostal, RIGHT? I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
[1:03:12] I've heard it all and I'm confused about
[1:03:14] it all. And she didn't get it all until
[1:03:16] she come in contact with somebody would
[1:03:17] tell her where she's wrong and what her
[1:03:19] life's like and what's happened to her
[1:03:20] along the way. And all of a sudden, she
[1:03:22] said, "You're a prophet. Hey, listen.
[1:03:24] Our fathers tell us on this mountain we
[1:03:26] should worship. But the Jew,
[1:03:29] where shall we worship?
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; It was showing there was something down
[1:03:33] inside of her that wanted to worship
[1:03:36] God.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; And she come in contact WITH THE ANSWER.
[1:03:40] HOW DID SHE KNOW HE WAS the answer? She
[1:03:41] just knew he had the answer. when he
[1:03:44] showed the sign of the Messiah, the
[1:03:46] prophetic sign, and and and he goes,
[1:03:48] "Listen, the father neither this
[1:03:50] mountain or that mountain, but the
[1:03:52] father seeketh those that will worship
[1:03:53] him with spirit and in truth." That's
[1:03:56] who the father's looking for, someone
[1:03:58] who will worship him in spirit and in
[1:04:00] truth.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; And she says, "When Messiah comes,
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; oh yeah,
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; this woman's not educated. SHE'S NOT A
[1:04:10] THEOLOGIAN. HOW IS SHE PUTTING THIS
[1:04:12] TOGETHER? Because there's something in
[1:04:14] her that's programmed to meet the word
[1:04:16] FOR HER DAY. THERE'S SOMETHING IN her
[1:04:18] that's programmed to meet the living
[1:04:19] word, THE PROPHECY MADE FLESH, to meet
[1:04:21] the Messiah in her day and hour. AND
[1:04:24] WHEN SHE COMES IN CON, IT'S NOT A STRAIN
[1:04:26] TO BELIEVE. IT'S NOT A STRUGGLE TO
[1:04:28] BELIEVE. SHE JUST BELIEVES.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SHE DOESN'T NEED A THEOLOGIAN.
[1:04:33] SHE DOESN'T NEED A DOCTORATE DEGREE. SHE
[1:04:36] JUST BELIEVES.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:40] And she he says she says, "Messiah, when
[1:04:44] he comes, he's going to tell us these
[1:04:47] things."
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine her heart pounding
[1:04:50] when she says that?
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; She knows something's moving in her
[1:04:53] life. She knows something real. She
[1:04:55] knows she's in the midst of something
[1:04:56] real and lifechanging. Amen. And no
[1:04:59] doubt her heart is about to beat out of
[1:05:00] her chest when she says, "When Messiah
[1:05:02] comes, he'll tell us these things." And
[1:05:05] Jesus says, "I that speaketh unto thee
[1:05:08] am he."
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, put yourself in her place.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Put yourself in her. She's going about
[1:05:19] her daily routine of business. She's
[1:05:21] going down to get water like she goes
[1:05:22] and gets water every single day of her
[1:05:24] life. She's not expecting any
[1:05:25] supernatural thing to happen. And she
[1:05:27] comes across a Jewish man sitting on a
[1:05:29] well. Amen. And starts this dialogue
[1:05:31] with her. She wasn't expecting one thing
[1:05:33] to happen that day. She had no plan. She
[1:05:35] had no preconceived idea. And all of a
[1:05:37] sudden, she comes in contact with a man
[1:05:38] and he speaks kind of weird living water
[1:05:41] in you springing up and she doesn't
[1:05:43] quite understand all this and get your
[1:05:44] husband and now but he knows about my
[1:05:46] life and a prophet and a messiah and now
[1:05:49] this man with dust ON HIS FEET, DUST on
[1:05:52] the bottom of his garment, with a beard
[1:05:54] maybe with sweat running down the sides
[1:05:56] of his face and he says, "I'm the
[1:05:58] Messiah."
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:06:02] HOW ON EARTH COULD A WOMAN ACCEPT THAT
[1:06:05] AFTER A 15MINUTE CONVERSATION?
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE WAS PROGRAMMED TO BELIEVE
[1:06:11] IT. SOMETHING INSIDE OF HER, AMEN, WAS
[1:06:14] DESIGNATED A SEED GENE OF GOD THAT WHEN
[1:06:16] IT WOULD COME IN CONTACT WITH THE LIVING
[1:06:18] WORD FOR HER DAY, THERE WOULD BE A
[1:06:20] MAGNETIC DRAW THAT WOULD NOT BE
[1:06:22] INTELLECTUAL. IT WOULD BE BEYOND THE
[1:06:24] MIND. IT WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T
[1:06:26] MAKE SENSE TO THE BRAIN. BUT THERE'S A
[1:06:28] CONNECTION THAT GOES OFF INSIDE OF HER.
[1:06:30] AMEN. SHE JUST STEPS BACK AND SHE LOOKS
[1:06:32] FOR A MINUTE.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; ABSORBING IT ALL, FRIENDS.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; AND THEN ALL THE OTHER DISCIPLES COME UP
[1:06:40] AND THEY'RE WONDERING WHY he's talking
[1:06:41] to her and they've got misgivings about
[1:06:43] the whole conversation. And all of a
[1:06:46] sudden it says she left her water pot.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; She didn't need anymore
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; because now she became the well of
[1:06:55] living water.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. that seed had come to life. And
[1:06:58] now she went down into the city and what
[1:07:00] she was doing, she was spurting out
[1:07:02] water and you will be a well of living
[1:07:04] water. Amen. Rushing out into
[1:07:06] everlasting life.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; She said, "Come see a man that told me
[1:07:11] everything I ever did." Is not this the
[1:07:13] very Messiah.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; No theologian, no degree, no preacher in
[1:07:18] a pullpit.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; He was looking for his lost sheep. Amen.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; The lost sheep hear his voice and they
[1:07:27] recognize their father calling.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; We got to leave our brains checked out.
[1:07:36] Sometimes
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; we come up with our whole life and a
[1:07:41] million reasons why. We look around and
[1:07:43] we see trouble in every hand. Listen,
[1:07:45] forget about all of that, friends.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; What voice are you hearing?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; And what is it doing inside of you?
[1:07:57] In John chapter 17
[1:08:00] says, I have manifest thy name unto the
[1:08:03] men which thou gavest me out of the
[1:08:05] world. Thine they were.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And thou gavest them me, and they have
[1:08:12] kept thy word.
[1:08:15] Wow.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Thine they were.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; So these men already belong to the
[1:08:22] father. Yeah. Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; They were his sheep.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; And he gave them to the son.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Luke 15. Then drew near unto him all the
[1:08:33] publicans and sinners for to hear him.
[1:08:36] And the Pharisees and the scribes
[1:08:37] murmured, saying, "This man receiveth
[1:08:39] sinners, and eateth with them." And he
[1:08:41] spake this parable unto them, saying,
[1:08:42] "What man of you having a hund sheep? If
[1:08:45] he lose one of them, does not leave the
[1:08:48] 90 and nine in the wilderness, and go
[1:08:50] after that which is lost, until he find
[1:08:52] it. When he hath found it, he layeth it
[1:08:55] on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he
[1:08:56] cometh home, he calleth together his
[1:08:58] friends and neighbors, saying unto them,
[1:09:00] Rejoice with me, for I have found, I
[1:09:03] have found my sheep which was lost.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't lose one of his hund sheep,
[1:09:10] leave the 99, and go find another sheep.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; He doesn't need a hundred sheep. He
[1:09:15] needs his sheep.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; He's not looking for a quota. He's not
[1:09:19] looking for a number. HE'S NOT TRYING to
[1:09:21] keep the seats full in a church. It
[1:09:23] doesn't matter the number. The number's
[1:09:25] not important. He's looking for his
[1:09:27] sheep.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; They had to have been his before. They
[1:09:30] had to have been longed TO THE FATHER
[1:09:32] ALL ALONG. They had to have been given
[1:09:33] to him by the father. They were his
[1:09:35] sheep. And he was looking for his sheep.
[1:09:38] And he was willing to leave the 99 to
[1:09:40] find THAT WHICH WAS LOST. AND CALLETH
[1:09:42] ALLTO TOGETHER REJOICE BECAUSE MY SHEEP
[1:09:44] WHICH WAS LOST IS NOW FOUND.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'VE BEEN FOUND, IT MEANS YOU WERE
[1:09:50] ALWAYS HIS SHEEP.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; YOU always belong to him. You were
[1:09:54] always designated to belong to this
[1:09:56] shepherd.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD. LISTEN, STOP LOOKING AT
[1:10:01] YOURSELF AND START LOOKING AT THE WORD.
[1:10:03] LET THE WORD IDENTIFY who you are.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; John 15:16. You have not chosen me, but
[1:10:13] I have chosen you and ordained you that
[1:10:16] you should go and bring forth fruit and
[1:10:18] that your fruit should remain. He's
[1:10:21] telling me these disciples, they thought
[1:10:23] they decided to follow Jesus.
[1:10:26] And listen, you didn't pick me. I picked
[1:10:28] you and I've already ordained you that
[1:10:30] you're going to go and bring forth
[1:10:31] fruit.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; That means they had guaranteed fruit
[1:10:35] coming.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, that would BE SUCH AN EXCITING THING
[1:10:38] TO HEAR. HOW WOULD YOU LOVE IT if Jesus
[1:10:40] would come and tell you, "I've ordained
[1:10:42] you that you should go and bring forth
[1:10:43] fruit and that your FRUIT SHOULD
[1:10:44] REMAIN." OH, PRAISE GOD. THAT MEANS MY
[1:10:46] EFFORTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN VAIN.
[1:10:48] BEFORE I START, I KNOW THAT THERE'S
[1:10:50] GOING TO COME FRUIT from this ministry
[1:10:52] and that the fruit will remain until the
[1:10:54] end.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T THEM, it was him.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:01] Ephesians 1 tells us, "Blessed be the
[1:11:02] God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:11:04] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[1:11:06] blessings in heavenly places in Christ,
[1:11:09] according as he hath chosen us in him
[1:11:12] before the foundation of the world, that
[1:11:15] we should be holy and without blame
[1:11:17] before him in love, having predestinated
[1:11:20] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:11:22] Jesus Christ to himself, according to
[1:11:24] the good pleasure of his will, to the
[1:11:27] praise of the glory of his grace,
[1:11:29] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:11:32] beloved.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Listen, God's already decided.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; He already knows you. He's already
[1:11:38] decided you're his.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; That's why he chose you in Christ before
[1:11:42] the foundation of the world that you
[1:11:44] might be holy.
[1:11:46] Amen. And without blame before him in
[1:11:48] love.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; He's predestinated us unto adoption,
[1:11:53] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:11:55] Christ.
[1:11:56] Amen. according to the good pleasure of
[1:11:59] his will.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful it was his will
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; because his will won't change.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Future home brother says here is your
[1:12:10] holy convocation
[1:12:12] not having anything to do with literal
[1:12:14] things. It's beyond that. It's in the
[1:12:16] kingdom of God with eternal life with
[1:12:18] the predestinated that never did start.
[1:12:21] It never started on any day. You wasn't
[1:12:24] saved on any day. You was always saved.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus just come to redeem that.
[1:12:31] But you was saved from the beginning
[1:12:33] because you had eternal life to begin
[1:12:35] with.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; I love when the prophet does things like
[1:12:38] this. Amen. We always SAY, "I GOT SAVED
[1:12:40] IN 19 so and so and this and that."
[1:12:43] Listen, that's the day you realized you
[1:12:45] were saved. That's when the scales fell
[1:12:47] off of your eyes and you recognized it
[1:12:49] came in contact with the living God. And
[1:12:51] that living God, amen, brought you to
[1:12:53] himself and awakened a seed inside of
[1:12:55] you. That may have been the day you were
[1:12:56] saved, but in the mind of God, you were
[1:12:58] always saved because your name was
[1:12:59] written in the Lamb's book of life from
[1:13:01] before the foundation of the world.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU DON'T GET SAVED ON ONE DAY. YOU
[1:13:06] COME TO THE realization and awakening
[1:13:07] that you are saved.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:13:13] the veil has been taken off of this
[1:13:15] Bible.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; By the opening of the seals.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; By the ministry of a prophet in the end
[1:13:20] time. Listen, this book, it can be so
[1:13:23] many things. Brother Brenham said, "This
[1:13:25] book is a book of history." It is.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; This book is a It's a book of
[1:13:32] instructions.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; It is.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; It It's a book of history. Yes.
[1:13:39] Instruction. Yes. Uh [laughter] uh uh
[1:13:43] all kinds of stuff.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; But when THE VEIL CAME OFF, LISTEN, this
[1:13:48] this to me is not of a book of
[1:13:50] instruction, although it has
[1:13:51] instructions.
[1:13:55] To me, it's not a book of commandments,
[1:13:56] although commandments are included.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; For me, it's not a book of histories,
[1:14:02] although it contains history.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; But when the seals open, this became a
[1:14:08] book of redemption.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Not rules, not regulations, not codes of
[1:14:16] conduct. All of those things are
[1:14:18] included in there. But that's not why
[1:14:19] God gave us a Bible. He gave us a Bible
[1:14:22] so that you would know where we came
[1:14:24] from. What God's original purpose was
[1:14:26] for his family, how it fell into ruin in
[1:14:28] the Garden of Eden and what he's been
[1:14:30] doing ever since to bring it back to
[1:14:31] redemption and what he's going to do in
[1:14:33] the future to bring it back to right
[1:14:35] where it came from. Amen. This book
[1:14:37] starts with his family in the Garden of
[1:14:38] Eden and perfection. And this book ends
[1:14:40] with his family restored back to the
[1:14:42] GARDEN OF EDEN IN PERFECTION. THAT'S
[1:14:44] WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; IF YOU USE it for anything else, YOU'VE
[1:14:49] MISUNDERSTOOD THE BOOK. THAT'S WHY
[1:14:51] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID AT THE OPENING OF
[1:14:53] THE SEVEN SEALS, my Bible became a new
[1:14:55] book.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; SHOULD I NOT USE IT FOR INSTRUCTIONS?
[1:14:58] YES, USE IT FOR INSTRUCTIONS, BUT DON'T
[1:15:00] LEAVE IT IN INSTRUCTIONS. SHOULD I USE
[1:15:02] IT FOR COMMANDMENT? DON'T LEAVE. YES,
[1:15:04] USE IT FOR COMMANDMENT, but don't leave
[1:15:06] it in commandment. IF YOU DON'T SEE THE
[1:15:08] LOVE LETTER written to you, if you DON'T
[1:15:10] SEE THE GREAT MYSTERY PLAN OF GOD TO
[1:15:12] HAVE A FAMILY HIMSELF MANIFEST IN THE
[1:15:15] FLESH AS A FAMILY ON THE EARTH IN
[1:15:17] FELLOWSHIP WITH ONE ANOTHER, GO BACK AND
[1:15:19] READ IT AGAIN CUZ THAT'S WHAT THIS WHOLE
[1:15:21] BIBLE IS ABOUT.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING IN IT HAS TO DO WITH THAT
[1:15:28] PURPOSE OF GOD. HOW IT STARTED, HOW IT
[1:15:31] FELL, AND WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING FOR 6,000
[1:15:34] YEARS, trying to BRING IT RIGHT BACK to
[1:15:35] his original thought.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; That's why this Bible became a new book.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; That's why, listen, this message, this
[1:15:46] message is not denominational teaching
[1:15:48] plus the correction.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; This message isn't correct doctrine,
[1:15:55] although it contains correct doctrine.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE GOD GAVE US IS NOT
[1:16:01] COMMANDMENTS, although it contains
[1:16:03] commandments.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Some people look at the Bible and they
[1:16:10] see rules and restrictions and dos and
[1:16:12] don'ts.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Well, that's because the veil's not been
[1:16:15] taken off yet,
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; And some people look at the message the
[1:16:19] exact same way.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; They look at the message and say, "Well,
[1:16:22] I was taught, Brother Bam, said I'm not
[1:16:23] allowed to do this, and this is the
[1:16:24] rules for marriage and divorce, and this
[1:16:26] is the rules for all of that.
[1:16:28] Listen, if that's the farthest you've
[1:16:30] gotten the message, I pray that God
[1:16:31] would take the scales off of your eyes.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Because the message of the hour came to
[1:16:36] open this book so you would understand
[1:16:38] what was the intent and purpose of God
[1:16:40] all along.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; It came to bring us the mystery that was
[1:16:43] in the back part of God's mind. The
[1:16:45] mystery of God, what he was wanting to
[1:16:47] achieve all along. And every character
[1:16:50] in the Bible and every type in the Bible
[1:16:52] has been declaring what this mystery is.
[1:16:54] And this mystery is God wanted to become
[1:16:57] flesh as a family, his children, his
[1:16:59] seed IN FLESH UPON THE EARTH AND
[1:17:01] FELLOWSHIP with one another.
[1:17:04] [clears throat and cough]
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. People use the Bible and they use
[1:17:08] the message for all kinds of things, but
[1:17:10] that's not what it was sent for.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; It was sent so you and I could have the
[1:17:16] scales removed from our eyes
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; and so that we would know who he is and
[1:17:21] who we are.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:24] Thank you.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Listen, in seeing who we are begins to
[1:17:28] remove the struggle
[1:17:31] in our lives.
[1:17:34] So much of what we struggle with is an
[1:17:36] identity crisis.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; If we could just get the right identity,
[1:17:40] a lot of the crisis would go away.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; That's what this message to me, that's
[1:17:45] what this message is sent for, friends.
[1:17:48] It's not for debate. I'm not interested
[1:17:50] in debating the message. Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; The message is my Isaf
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; that opened my eyes.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in debating doctrine.
[1:17:58] I'm not interested in debating all of
[1:18:00] that. Listen, the message has lifted us
[1:18:02] so much higher than doctrinal debates.
[1:18:04] It's lifted us into a love relationship,
[1:18:06] a connection and union with Jesus
[1:18:08] Christ. Amen. Through the revealed word
[1:18:09] of the hour, it's wakened me to who I
[1:18:12] actually am. It's removed all the
[1:18:14] confusion. I've heard FROM MY FATHER.
[1:18:16] AMEN. I've realized that I'm a sheep.
[1:18:18] I'VE COME BACK TO MY SHEPHERD. AMEN.
[1:18:20] WHAT DO I WANT TO ARGUE ABOUT?
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; NOTHING. I'M IN LOVE. I'M HAPPY. I'M
[1:18:26] FREE. I'VE GOT EVERYTHING I COULD EVER
[1:18:28] WANT.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this Bible
[1:18:38] is a book of redemption.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; And brother Benham calls it the book of
[1:18:43] life.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Why has it become death to so many
[1:18:48] people?
[1:18:50] Because the letter kleth, but the spirit
[1:18:52] bringeth life.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; They caught the letter, but they missed
[1:18:55] the spirit.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; And that's what God brought us in the
[1:18:59] end time. He brought us back to the
[1:19:01] spirit of this Bible.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; What it's all really about. He's given
[1:19:05] us eagle vision so we can fly high and
[1:19:07] not see commandments and not see
[1:19:09] histories and not see all of this. But
[1:19:11] when you fly back and you look at it,
[1:19:14] you say, "This is a family album."
[1:19:18] Amen.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; This is a family album
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; of God's family
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; and how his family how he was going to
[1:19:29] bring forth his family and what happened
[1:19:31] and they came wrong and now all the
[1:19:33] troubles the family fell into and what
[1:19:35] he's been doing to restore the family
[1:19:36] and how he's going to bring the family
[1:19:38] back to his original purpose. This is a
[1:19:40] family album.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; What a glorious thing. But you know
[1:19:44] what's more glorious than realizing this
[1:19:45] is a family album? When you flip the
[1:19:47] page and you say, "There's me. I'M IN
[1:19:50] THE FAMILY ALBUM. I'M IN THE BOOK OF
[1:19:53] LIFE. I'M INCLUDED IN THIS STORY."
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THIS COULD NEVER BE A BOOK OF
[1:20:00] DEATH TO ME. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
[1:20:01] THERE'S COMMANDMENTS. THERE'S
[1:20:02] COMMANDMENTS. I FALL SHORT OF THEM. I
[1:20:04] REGRET AND I AM SORRY WHEN I FAIL. BUT
[1:20:07] THIS BOOK CAN NEVER KILL ME BECAUSE I
[1:20:09] WAS WITH HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF
[1:20:11] THE WORLD. IT'S ALL WRITTEN FOR MY
[1:20:13] BENEFIT. IT'S WRITTEN BECAUSE OF LOVE.
[1:20:14] IT'S WRITTEN TO TELL ME WHO I AM. THIS
[1:20:16] IS NOT WRITTEN TO CONDEMN ME. EVEN THE
[1:20:19] INSTRUCTIONS AND THE COMMANDMENTS ARE IN
[1:20:20] THERE FOR MY BENEFIT, NOT FOR MY HARM.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT THERE TO CUT ME OUT OF THE
[1:20:26] PROGRAM OF GOD. THEY'RE THERE TO BRING
[1:20:28] ME INTO THE PROGRAM of God.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Two people CAN READ THE SAME BOOK AND
[1:20:34] COME TO TWO different conclusions.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Bam said this is a love
[1:20:41] letter.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. [clears throat] And he said, "When
[1:20:43] my wife wife writes me a love letter,"
[1:20:46] Amen. I'm reading between the lines
[1:20:48] what's in the love letter, I'm catching
[1:20:50] more than anybody else who reads that
[1:20:51] letter.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT PICK UP BROTHER
[1:20:54] Brenham's love letter. And when Brother
[1:20:56] Brennham reads that love letter, his
[1:20:58] heart every once in a while skips a beat
[1:20:59] cuz he knows what his wife's saying.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; And she says, "Listen, the kids are all
[1:21:03] in bed, the house is quiet, and I'm
[1:21:05] thinking of you." And he's going, "Oh my
[1:21:07] goodness, I wish I was there to hold her
[1:21:09] hand.
[1:21:10] She's wanting me to sit by her, talk to
[1:21:12] her.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Somebody else reads the same letter and
[1:21:16] been like, "My goodness, that was the
[1:21:17] most boring thing I ever read. The kids
[1:21:19] are in bed. She's just sitting there
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; doing nothing."
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; IT DEPENDS ON WHO WROTE THE LETTER AND
[1:21:28] who received the letter.
[1:21:30] IF YOUR FATHER WROTE THE LETTER AND
[1:21:32] YOU'RE HIS SON, IF YOUR BRIDEGROOM WROTE
[1:21:34] THE LETTER AND YOU'RE THE BRIDE, WHAT
[1:21:36] YOU READ IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than
[1:21:38] anybody else picks IT UP AND DOESN'T
[1:21:40] KNOW WHO WROTE IT AND WHO'S IT FOR.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; GOD, give us a revelation of who we are.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:51] In the book of Acts, Acts 13, it says,
[1:21:53] "But when the Jews saw the multitudes,
[1:21:56] they were filled with envy and spake
[1:21:58] against those things which were spoken
[1:21:59] by Paul and contradicting and
[1:22:01] blaspheing." Then Paul and Barnabas
[1:22:03] waxed bold and said, "It was necessary
[1:22:05] that the word of God should first have
[1:22:06] been spoken to you. But seeing you put
[1:22:08] it from you, and judge yourselves
[1:22:10] unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we
[1:22:12] turn to the Gentiles. For so hath the
[1:22:15] Lord commanded us, saying, I have set
[1:22:17] thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that
[1:22:18] thou shouldest be for salvation unto the
[1:22:20] ends of the earth. And when the Gentiles
[1:22:23] heard this, they were glad and glorified
[1:22:25] the word of the Lord. And as many as
[1:22:27] were ordained to eternal life, believed
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; you got this. Now he's coming and
[1:22:33] preaching to a mixed multitude, Jews and
[1:22:35] Gentiles. He's moving out from Antioch
[1:22:36] by the bidding of the spirit to go on
[1:22:38] their first missionary journey. And Paul
[1:22:40] and Barnabas are preaching. And at first
[1:22:42] everybody's hearing them, the Jews and
[1:22:44] the Gentiles, they ask him to come back
[1:22:45] and speak again. But then the Jews begin
[1:22:47] to stir up trouble and they begin to
[1:22:49] contradict and blasphe. And when they
[1:22:51] stood against the word of God,
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Paul knew,
[1:22:57] Paul knew that they had no desire for
[1:23:00] eternal life.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Then he said, then the Bible says, "And
[1:23:05] the Gentiles heard them.
[1:23:08] They were glad and they glorified the
[1:23:10] word of the Lord.
[1:23:13] It says, "As many as believed were
[1:23:16] ordained into eternal life."
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. It didn't say that.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; As many as believed what Paul said, then
[1:23:26] became then received eternal life.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; No, it doesn't say that. Am I reading it
[1:23:31] wrong? AMEN.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; WHAT CAME FIRST?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; God's plan,
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; God's ordination, predestination,
[1:23:41] election, it came first.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; As many as were ordained to eternal life
[1:23:47] believed.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Why did they believe? They had something
[1:23:50] in them to believe with. They had a
[1:23:52] predestinated elect seed of God laying
[1:23:54] inside OF THEM THAT WAS PROGRAMMED TO
[1:23:56] HEAR PAUL.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Many heard, few believed. Why did they
[1:24:01] believe? And why did THE JEWS WALK AWAY?
[1:24:03] BECAUSE SOMETHING in them could receive
[1:24:05] what was being preached.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Bon says they deny his word,
[1:24:12] deny his baptism, deny his power, deny
[1:24:14] his signs, and with a creed or tradition
[1:24:16] again of wearing turned around collars
[1:24:18] and everything, making themselves creeds
[1:24:20] and so forth. They're trying to upon
[1:24:22] good works. They wasn't ordained to life
[1:24:25] to begin with. They had nothing to
[1:24:27] believe with.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Right? That's what happened to the
[1:24:30] Pharisees. They had nothing to believe
[1:24:32] with. But the woman at the well did. The
[1:24:33] woman who came and broke the alabaster
[1:24:35] box and washed his feet. She had
[1:24:37] something to believe with. Amen. But
[1:24:38] Simon that lived in his house didn't
[1:24:40] have anything to believe with.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Romans 10:17. So then
[1:24:46] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:24:49] the word of God.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Do we got that?
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:24:56] the word of God.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if I want somebody to have
[1:25:00] faith, I'll just give them the word of
[1:25:01] God. And if they hear the word of God,
[1:25:04] guaranteed they'll have faith.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Except Jesus said, "He that hath ears to
[1:25:11] hear, let him hear."
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, we can preach the pure word of
[1:25:18] God. True. Absolutely true.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; But if nobody has ears to hear, they
[1:25:22] won't hear it.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:26] So faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:25:29] by the word of God. Zakius believed when
[1:25:32] he heard the word of God and came in
[1:25:34] contact with the word. The woman at the
[1:25:35] well believed when she came in contact
[1:25:36] with the word. Amen. They believed when
[1:25:39] they come in contact with the word for
[1:25:40] their day. But there's others that heard
[1:25:43] what they heard but didn't believe.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
[1:25:51] Listen, this was repeated by Jesus
[1:25:54] Christ eight times in the gospel.
[1:25:57] Eight times. He that hath ears to hear,
[1:26:00] let him hear. Who was the message for?
[1:26:03] Those that had ears to hear?
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; So what came first? The message that was
[1:26:08] preached or the ears to hear with?
[1:26:12] [laughter]
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't have been preached unless
[1:26:15] there was ears to hear. And those ears
[1:26:17] were predestinated ears. Amen.
[1:26:20] programmed by God to hear and they
[1:26:21] weren't these EARS BECAUSE EVERYBODY
[1:26:23] that was in attendance that day, we can
[1:26:26] assume statistically could hear.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; THEY HEARD WHAT HE SAID, BUT THEY DIDN'T
[1:26:31] HEAR WHAT HE SAID.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Because they didn't have the internal
[1:26:35] ears to hear
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; what he said. [clears throat]
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; He goes on, he says, "Jesus said unto
[1:26:41] them, if God were your father, you would
[1:26:42] love me. For I proceeded forth and came
[1:26:45] from God. Neither came I of myself, but
[1:26:47] he sent me. Why do you not understand my
[1:26:50] speech, even because you cannot hear my
[1:26:52] word?
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Ye are of your father, the devil, and
[1:26:56] the lust of your father you will do. He
[1:26:58] was a murderer from the beginning, and
[1:26:59] abode not in the truth, because there is
[1:27:01] no truth in him. When he speak of the
[1:27:03] lie, he speaketh of his own. For he is a
[1:27:05] liar and the father of it. And because I
[1:27:07] tell you the truth, you believe me not.
[1:27:10] THIS IS HOW JESUS KNEW EXACTLY who their
[1:27:12] father was. Because I tell you the
[1:27:13] truth, YOU BELIEVE ME NOT. YOUR FATHER
[1:27:15] Abraham didn't do this. You're not
[1:27:17] Abraham. See, Abraham's seed believe the
[1:27:19] truth when they hear the truth.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Then he says, I I want to go back to the
[1:27:27] beginning. Why do you not understand my
[1:27:30] speech?
[1:27:32] Was he not speaking the right language?
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Did he have a speech impediment?
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Did he slur his words? He said, "Why
[1:27:43] don't you understand my speech?" This
[1:27:45] wasn't the ability of these ears to
[1:27:47] hear.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; They were hearing clearly what he was
[1:27:50] saying, but they didn't understand what
[1:27:52] he was saying. And they didn't believe
[1:27:54] what he was saying. And they sought to
[1:27:55] kill him. Amen. Proving that they were
[1:27:58] of their father, the devil.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm telling you friends, Jesus
[1:28:05] never did anything to persuade anyone to
[1:28:07] believe.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; He never twisted anybody's arm. He never
[1:28:11] said pretty please. He never asked them
[1:28:13] to please sit come and listen again. He
[1:28:15] when the rich young ruler asked him what
[1:28:17] must I do in inherit eternal life. He
[1:28:18] said well do what the commandments say.
[1:28:20] And and and this young ruler said I have
[1:28:22] done all of these. He said one thing
[1:28:24] you're lacking. And before he told him
[1:28:26] he said BEHOLDING HIM. HE LOVED HIM.
[1:28:27] Jesus wasn't angry with him. Jesus loved
[1:28:29] him. He was going to set him free from
[1:28:31] his own vices. He was going to give him
[1:28:33] the opportunity. Amen. AND HE SAYS SELL
[1:28:35] ALL THAT YOU HAVE AND GIVE TO THE POOR
[1:28:37] AND THOU SHALT INHERIT ETERNAL LIFE. AND
[1:28:39] HE says he went away grieved because he
[1:28:41] had much riches.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus never said, "NO, NO, STOP. YOU
[1:28:44] DON'T UNDERSTAND. LET ME EXPLAIN it
[1:28:46] again." Jesus never explained it again.
[1:28:58] looking for sheep. He was looking for
[1:29:00] his sheep.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm afraid too many times that
[1:29:06] we try to use our personalities and
[1:29:08] persuasion
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; and performance and and all kinds of
[1:29:12] other things to attract people.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, and there's nothing wrong with
[1:29:16] having a nice personality. There's
[1:29:18] nothing wrong with being friendly with
[1:29:19] people. There's nothing wrong with
[1:29:19] spending time with people. But none of
[1:29:21] that will ever hold. And none of that
[1:29:23] was ever used to find the children of
[1:29:25] God. God always used the same measure to
[1:29:28] locate his children all down through
[1:29:30] time. And he always did it by his
[1:29:32] revealed word for the hour and the hour
[1:29:34] in the dispensation of time that that
[1:29:36] word was come forth. There would be a
[1:29:37] seed there to meet that word and a word
[1:29:39] to meet that seed. And when those two
[1:29:41] connected, there would be something that
[1:29:42] would come forth.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; We don't have to worry about this
[1:29:47] message. This message will find the
[1:29:49] children of God.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; This message is right. This message is
[1:29:52] true. And listen, God never called me to
[1:29:54] correct the prophet, to smooth out his
[1:29:56] rough edges, to make him sound nicer,
[1:29:58] and apologize for what HE SAID.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; GOD PICKED THE vessel he wanted to carry
[1:30:03] the message. So the way the message came
[1:30:04] is the way God wanted it to come.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; And if it came right straight and it
[1:30:08] came true AND IT CAME ROUGH, THAT'S THE
[1:30:10] WAY GOD DESIGNED THE man and that's the
[1:30:13] man God chose. And it didn't come with
[1:30:14] eloquence of speech and it didn't come
[1:30:16] with high flattering words. It came from
[1:30:18] a man with a seventh grade education out
[1:30:20] of Kentucky who couldn't pronounce the
[1:30:21] big words in the Bible, BUT HE WOULD
[1:30:23] JUST SAY IT STRAIGHT AND he would use
[1:30:24] all kinds of examples and he would just
[1:30:26] tell THE TRUTH. AND THAT'S GOD'S DESIGN.
[1:30:29] AND I'M not here TO SAY, "GOD MADE A
[1:30:31] MISTAKE. LET ME SMOOTH IT OVER for you
[1:30:33] and make it nicer because the tapes are
[1:30:35] hard to listen to." Listen, you should
[1:30:37] listen TO THE TAPES. THAT'S THE VOICE OF
[1:30:39] GOD ON THOSE TAPES. AND EVERYTHING I TRY
[1:30:41] TO DO HERE IS JUST SAY BACK TO YOU WHAT
[1:30:43] I HEARD ON THOSE TAPES.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; WHAT I READ IN THE BOOK, AMEN, THAT GOD
[1:30:48] WILL ANOINT ME FOR A SPECIFIC TIME AND
[1:30:50] PLACE TO SPEAK BACK TO YOU SOMETHING
[1:30:52] SPECIFIC FOR YOUR LIFE. BUT I AM NOT
[1:30:54] HERE TO CHANGE WHAT'S ON THE TABLE. I AM
[1:30:56] NOT HERE TO SMOOTH IT OUT AND POLISH IT
[1:30:58] UP AND MAKE IT NICER AND MORE
[1:30:59] DIGESTIBLE. GOD BROUGHT IT IN A WAY THAT
[1:31:02] THE CHILDREN OF GOD COULD DIGEST IT.
[1:31:05] AND IF YOU CAN'T DIGEST WHAT'S ON THE
[1:31:07] TAPE, I WOULD PRAY TO GOD, GOD, WHY IS
[1:31:10] THIS MESSAGE GIVING ME INDIGESTION?
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S GOD'S METHOD OF DELIVERY.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; God knew how to find his sheep.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Our job is not to soften it
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; so it's easier.
[1:31:33] My job is just here to proclaim it. The
[1:31:36] way he's called me and anointed me to
[1:31:38] proclaim it. It'll be unique.
[1:31:40] Absolutely. It's unique to me. God's
[1:31:42] just using me with my temperament to
[1:31:44] proclaim the word. But I'm not here to
[1:31:46] change it, friends.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; God forbid that we should ever change
[1:31:49] it.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; God did a good job.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; He picked the right man for the job.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; You never hear from me. Don't listen to
[1:32:00] that. You won't understand. Just listen
[1:32:02] to me. If you ever hear me say that, you
[1:32:04] run away.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Because the bride of Jesus Christ can
[1:32:07] take that voice and they love it.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; The voice of the sign. This is always
[1:32:17] God's way of making his voice known to
[1:32:18] his people. He sends his prophet and
[1:32:21] gives a sign and then takes his voice
[1:32:23] that's been spoken before on his word
[1:32:25] and vindicates it by this man. And they
[1:32:28] know that it's his voice because it's
[1:32:29] the promised word of the day. Oh, if
[1:32:32] people would only see that, if they
[1:32:33] could only stop just a moment and
[1:32:35] realize that. You see, there is no way
[1:32:37] to make them believe it. There's no way
[1:32:39] a man God himself can't do it. Can't do
[1:32:43] what? Make them believe it.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's let's just stop for a
[1:32:47] minute.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; There's no way to make them believe it.
[1:32:52] God himself can't do it.
[1:32:56] Is that what you just read? Did you read
[1:32:58] what I read?
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF CAN'T MAKE the unbeliever
[1:33:01] believe.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; God himself can't make the people
[1:33:05] believe it. They got to believe it. And
[1:33:07] if there's nothing there to believe
[1:33:08] with, how can they believe? SEE, NO
[1:33:11] MATTER WHAT YOU DO.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; In Luke 16,
[1:33:19] he says, "Then he said, I pray thee
[1:33:21] therefore, father, that thou would
[1:33:22] ascend him to my father's house." Who's
[1:33:24] this? The rich young RULER WHO FILLED
[1:33:26] HIS BARNS, who walked away from Jesus,
[1:33:28] filled his barn to the fool and said,
[1:33:29] "Soul, take thy rest." And that day,
[1:33:31] that fool found his soul in hell.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; And he's LOOKING UP AND HE'S CRYING TO
[1:33:36] FATHER ABRAHAM TO help his to help him.
[1:33:39] And Father Abram said, "I can't help
[1:33:40] you." Then he says, "Help my brothers."
[1:33:42] And listen to the answer. He said that I
[1:33:46] He said, "I PRAY THEE, FATHER, THAT THOU
[1:33:47] WOULD send him." Who's that? Lazarus the
[1:33:49] bum that he wouldn't take care of. Send
[1:33:51] him to my father's house. For I have
[1:33:53] five brethren that he may testify unto
[1:33:55] them, lest they also come into this
[1:33:58] place of torment. And Abraham saith unto
[1:34:00] them, they have Moses and the prophets.
[1:34:03] Let them hear them. What's he saying?
[1:34:05] They have the word. Let them believe the
[1:34:07] word. Yeah.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Nay, Father Abraham, but
[1:34:11] if one went unto them from the dead,
[1:34:14] they will repent." And he said unto him,
[1:34:16] "If they hear not Moses and the
[1:34:18] prophets, neither will they be
[1:34:20] persuaded, though one rose from the
[1:34:23] dead."
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; A MIRACLE, A SIGN, A WONDER IS NOT
[1:34:28] WHAT'S REQUIRED TO BELIEVE. The believer
[1:34:30] will believe the word. Amen.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, when brother Bannon WAS SENT
[1:34:33] WITH THREE POOLS, it wasn't the FIRST
[1:34:35] PULL OR THE SECOND PULL THAT CAUGHT THE
[1:34:37] RAINBOW TROUT. THE first pull AND THE
[1:34:39] SECOND POOL CAUGHT their attention.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT CAUGHT THE FISH WAS THE OPENING
[1:34:44] OF THE WORD. IT WAS THE WORD THAT CAUGHT
[1:34:46] THE RAINBOW TROUT, NOT THE FIRST AND
[1:34:48] SECOND POOL. IT WASN'T THE MIRACLES THAT
[1:34:51] CAUGHT THEM BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE WERE
[1:34:53] DOING MIRACLES. AMEN. THE MIRACLES
[1:34:55] CAUGHT THEIR ATTENTION. THEY SAW A
[1:34:56] MESSIANIC SIGN. THEY SAW BIBLICAL SIGNS.
[1:34:59] THEY SAW THIS WAS ALL WHAT JESUS DID.
[1:35:01] AND WHEN the when the seed come close,
[1:35:03] when the RAINBOW TROUT CAME NEAR, AMEN.
[1:35:06] THAT THAT SECOND PULL WAS SUPPOSED TO
[1:35:08] SCATTER ALL THE FISH AWAY. BUT WHAT IT
[1:35:09] DID WAS CAUGHT A LITTLE BITTY ONE. BUT
[1:35:11] THE ONE THAT WAS SUPPOSED to catch him,
[1:35:13] to really hook them, to bring them in,
[1:35:14] was the third pull, the opening of the
[1:35:16] word.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you ask me, what do I want to
[1:35:25] emphasize? Third
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; pull. Yeah.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; The opening of the word. Amen. That's
[1:35:30] what will catch the rainbow trout.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean they're still not
[1:35:34] healing AND THEY'RE STILL NOT GIFTS. ALL
[1:35:35] OF THOSE ARE STILL OPERATING WITHIN the
[1:35:37] church. Amen. God uses those in
[1:35:39] appointed time and seasons. THEY STILL
[1:35:41] SHOW THE POWER AND MIGHT OF GOD. AND THE
[1:35:43] SPIRIT OF GOD STILL FALLS ON PEOPLE TO
[1:35:45] DO ALL KINDS OF SIGNS and wonders and
[1:35:47] miracles ALL OVER THE PLACE. ESPECIALLY
[1:35:49] IF YOU'RE IN THE MISSION FIELD bringing
[1:35:51] the word for the first time. God
[1:35:52] vindicates his word over and over and
[1:35:54] over again. BUT THAT WON'T HOOK THE
[1:35:57] RAINBOW TROUT. THAT WILL GATHER THEIR
[1:35:59] ATTENTION. BUT THE hook is the word.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; That third pull, when they set the hook,
[1:36:07] it brings the fish home.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 6, "But there are
[1:36:16] some of you that believe not."
[1:36:19] For Jesus knew from the beginning who
[1:36:20] they were that believed not, and who
[1:36:22] should betray him. Who's he talking to?
[1:36:25] his group of followers,
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; his disciples, the one that gathered
[1:36:28] around him and told him he's great and
[1:36:30] we're following you and we're off
[1:36:31] preaching two by two in all these cities
[1:36:33] and villages and they come back to him.
[1:36:35] He says, "But there are some of you that
[1:36:37] believe not."
[1:36:40] Their close proximity to Jesus Christ
[1:36:43] could not make them believe.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Is that astounding to you? That's
[1:36:55] astounding to me.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Eating with him, hearing him talk in the
[1:36:59] house, hearing him explain parables,
[1:37:01] walking with him, riding in a boat with
[1:37:03] him, seeing all of his miracles,
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; could not make them believers.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; We always think if somebody would just
[1:37:16] see something, if they would just come,
[1:37:17] if they would just,
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; that doesn't necessarily mean that
[1:37:20] they'll be a believer. [clears throat]
[1:37:23] If they can receive the word for their
[1:37:25] day, they'll be a believer.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; He says this later, Jesus answered them,
[1:37:32] "Have not I chosen you 12? And one of
[1:37:34] you is a devil."
[1:37:39] Judas being a close friend of Jesus
[1:37:43] could not change Judas.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Judas being taken in confidence to
[1:37:54] be the treasurer and hold the money bag
[1:37:56] and be sent out on special missions.
[1:37:59] Judas going out into the villages and
[1:38:00] casting out devils and healing the sick.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Did Judas cast out devils?
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Did he heal the sick?
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Did Jesus give him the money back?
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Was he trusted above his brethren?
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Was any close fellowship with Jesus?
[1:38:14] Absolutely. At the supper table when
[1:38:16] Jesus over and whispered to him, "What
[1:38:18] thou doest do quickly?" They assumed
[1:38:20] that Judas had just been sent on another
[1:38:21] errand. So that must have been common
[1:38:23] business. Jesus would have a private
[1:38:25] conversation with Judas and Judas take
[1:38:27] off because he had the money back.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; That's what they assumed in the last
[1:38:30] supper. So his close proximity, his
[1:38:34] office in the church, his his his
[1:38:38] riding in the boat with Jesus, his
[1:38:40] sleeping next to him, him spending night
[1:38:42] and day next to HIM COULD NOT CHANGE
[1:38:44] WHAT JUDAS WAS. CUZ YOU CAN'T CHANGE a
[1:38:47] goat into a sheep. YOU CAN'T CHANGE A
[1:38:49] COCKER TO A WHEAT. WHATEVER it is from
[1:38:52] the mind of God is what it is.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "Not even God can make
[1:39:00] them believe."
[1:39:02] Not even Jesus, not even God in flesh,
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; preaching the pure word 2,000 years ago
[1:39:09] standing there, God perfectly embodied
[1:39:13] in a body of flesh, not fallen, perfect
[1:39:15] flesh, preaching the pure unadulterated
[1:39:18] word. Even he himself in his own body,
[1:39:22] preaching with his own vocal cords that
[1:39:24] he created, could not make them
[1:39:26] believers. Yeah.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; So, do we think that we can do it
[1:39:31] better?
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; IF I JUST PREACH IT DIFFERENTLY, IF I
[1:39:35] JUST DO THIS OR IF I JUST DO THAT or if
[1:39:37] we add a program or if we just change
[1:39:39] this or change that, we'll make them
[1:39:41] believers. NONE OF THAT IS going to
[1:39:43] work. Believers are going to believe the
[1:39:45] word of God because they have a seed
[1:39:47] gene of God. And if THEY COME IN CONTACT
[1:39:49] WITH THE true word that matches the gen
[1:39:52] genetics on the inside, the genetics of
[1:39:54] this word and the genetics OF THIS WORD
[1:39:56] WILL COME TOGETHER.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; So God, HELP US TO PREACH THE WORD.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Help us with all OF OUR MIGHT TO PREACH
[1:40:04] THE truth of the word.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; A God who is rich in mercy. I'm only
[1:40:11] saying this not to mix up doctrine, but
[1:40:13] to straighten it out that we might get
[1:40:15] away from this fear and scare. You don't
[1:40:18] know who you are. You are not going to
[1:40:20] be. But now you are sons of God. See,
[1:40:22] you always were the sons of God. For
[1:40:23] when God had you in his thinking at the
[1:40:25] beginning, you have to be some part of
[1:40:27] you. Your life that's in you now had to
[1:40:30] be with God before there. Well, when he
[1:40:33] before he even became material here on
[1:40:35] earth, before there was anything but
[1:40:37] God, you were one of his attributes.
[1:40:40] He knowed what your name would be. He
[1:40:42] knowed the color of hair you would have.
[1:40:43] He knowed all about you. The only thing
[1:40:45] happened is when you being a sinner,
[1:40:48] many of you can fellowship with me on
[1:40:49] this thought. When you was a little boy
[1:40:51] or little girl, you would walk around
[1:40:52] and there would be certain things that
[1:40:54] would just where it wouldn't bother the
[1:40:56] other kids. It seemed like there was
[1:40:57] something in you that cried out. There
[1:40:59] was a God somewhere, yet you were a
[1:41:01] sinner. You remember that? Certainly.
[1:41:04] Now, what was that? That was that little
[1:41:06] form of life in you then.
[1:41:08] [clears throat] When was it in you? When
[1:41:10] you were a little boy and girl.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:13] And then after a while you heard the
[1:41:15] gospel. Maybe you went to church. You
[1:41:17] picked out this and that and went from
[1:41:18] denomination to denomination. But one
[1:41:21] day you being part of God, you had to be
[1:41:24] part of the word. And when you heard the
[1:41:26] word, you know where you come from. You
[1:41:28] know that was the truth. You were always
[1:41:31] the seed was in you always. The word
[1:41:35] seen the word that was in you that was
[1:41:37] before the foundation of the world saw
[1:41:39] the word and you come to it. Amen.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; I love this. Let's look at this. Let's
[1:41:43] look at this. The word seen the word.
[1:41:47] That was bad.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; I did not mean to cross it out.
[1:41:53] Let's look at this. The word seen the
[1:41:55] word that was in you.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; That mean the word was already in you.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; The word that came to you seen the word
[1:42:03] that was in you.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; I believe Jesus Christ, the word, saw
[1:42:07] the word that was in the woman at the
[1:42:08] well. Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; I believe he saw the word that was in
[1:42:10] Zakius.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, before the foundation world,
[1:42:15] listen,
[1:42:17] saw the word and you came to it.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; So the word seen the word that was in
[1:42:23] you and the word that was in you seen
[1:42:25] the word and you guys moved to one
[1:42:27] another.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; the word saw the word in you. The word
[1:42:33] in you saw the word.
[1:42:37] They were magnetized to each other.
[1:42:38] Friends,
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; this gives me such confidence. Amen.
[1:42:42] When I go out and witness or share the
[1:42:44] word or or SHARE WITH SOMEBODY, LISTEN,
[1:42:46] I'M NOT THERE to convince anybody. I'm
[1:42:48] not there TO TWIST ANYBODY'S ARM. I'M
[1:42:50] NOT THERE TO MAKE ANYBODY a believer.
[1:42:52] They're either one of his sheep or
[1:42:53] they're not one of his sheep. I'm just
[1:42:55] there to bring the voice of the Messiah.
[1:42:57] I'm just there to bring the word for the
[1:42:58] age and bring some little nugget that
[1:43:00] will trigger something on inside. And I
[1:43:02] guarantee IF SOMETHING YOU SAID PRICKS
[1:43:04] SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE, THEY KNOW WHERE
[1:43:06] TO COME BACK for more. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[1:43:07] DUMP THE WHOLE LOAD AT ONCE. FRIENDS,
[1:43:09] ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GIVE A PORTION of
[1:43:11] the word for this day. Amen. Whatever
[1:43:13] doors open to you when you DROP THAT
[1:43:14] SEED IN. If there's fertile soil there
[1:43:17] AND IT AND IT STICKS, THEY'LL NEVER
[1:43:19] FORGET IT. EVEN IF they wait years,
[1:43:21] THEY'LL COME BACK. THEY KNOW THE SOURCE
[1:43:23] OF where they felt that, where they
[1:43:25] heard THAT, AND THEY'LL COME BACK TO IT.
[1:43:27] FRIENDS,
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Rest assured, we don't use
[1:43:30] persuasion techniques. This is why
[1:43:32] brother Brenham said, "I'm against altar
[1:43:33] calls." HE WASN'T AGAINST ALTAR CALLS.
[1:43:35] LISTEN, HE had altar calls all the way
[1:43:37] up till the end of his ministry. It
[1:43:39] wasn't just coming to the altar and
[1:43:40] praying. He was against. He said, "I'm
[1:43:42] against that Methodist FORM OF PUTTING
[1:43:44] PRESSURE on people saying, "Now listen,
[1:43:46] Charlie, you know, your mom prayed for
[1:43:47] you and she died years ago. She's in
[1:43:49] heaven praying for you NOW BECAUSE
[1:43:50] THAT'S NOT A TRUE CONVERSION."
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T BRING THE RIGHT RESULTS.
[1:43:56] PUTTING PRESSURE ON PEOPLE, PUTTING FEAR
[1:43:57] ON PEOPLE, DOING A COUNTDOWN. GET TO
[1:44:00] THIS ALTAR BY THE 10. BY THE COUNT OF
[1:44:01] 10, 10, NINE. IF YOU DON'T, THIS COULD
[1:44:04] BE YOUR LAST TIME. YOU MAY BE DEAD
[1:44:05] BEFORE THE MORNING. LISTEN, THAT'S WHAT
[1:44:07] BROTHER BRANDON WAS AGAINST.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW ANYBODY IN THE
[1:44:13] BIBLE was converted.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Where were they converted? When they
[1:44:19] heard the word, they were pricricked in
[1:44:21] their heart.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; And they said, "MEN AND BRETHREN, WHAT
[1:44:23] SHOULD WE DO? YEAH.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE WORD THAT GRIPPED HIM. IT WAS
[1:44:28] THE WORD THAT PRICRICKED HIM. AND WHAT
[1:44:30] WORD WAS IT PETER WAS PREACHING? PETER
[1:44:32] WAS TAKING THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHECIES
[1:44:34] AND SAYING, "THAT DAY IS THIS DAY.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; WHAT JOEL WROTE IS HAPPENING BEFORE YOUR
[1:44:38] EYES. YOU'RE WITNESSING THE PROPHECIES
[1:44:40] BEING FULFILLED." AND THERE WAS
[1:44:42] THOUSANDS OF MEN THAT DAY. AND ALL OF A
[1:44:44] SUDDEN, THEY WERE PRICRICKED IN THEIR
[1:44:45] HEART AS PETER PREACHED.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; He didn't have an altar call. HE DIDN'T
[1:44:51] HAVE A PROGRAM. HE DIDN'T have an
[1:44:52] emotional pull. HE DIDN'T TELL THEM THIS
[1:44:54] IS YOUR LAST CHANCE. YOU GOT TELL YOU
[1:44:56] GOT FIVE MORE MINUTES. FIVE MORE MINUTES
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; and the altar's closed.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; No, they preached the word.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; And the word did the work.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; He sent his word and healed their
[1:45:10] disease.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; What is our disease? Hybridization.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; What is our disease? Spiritual amnesia.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how we were born. We were
[1:45:18] born in hybridization with spiritual
[1:45:20] amnesia. And how did he heal our
[1:45:22] disease? He sent his word
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; and healed our disease.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; So listen friends, I'm not against alter
[1:45:29] calls. Brother Brennham wasn't against
[1:45:30] alter calls. He said I'm against alter
[1:45:32] calls. And he had an alter call.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:37] [laughter]
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Brother says in spiritual amnesia,
[1:45:43] in amnesia you don't know who you are.
[1:45:47] Listen,
[1:45:49] this is the biggest problem.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why we were living in sin.
[1:45:53] This is why we were failing. This is why
[1:45:55] we were falling apart.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; We come into this life spiritual
[1:46:00] amnesia, blind, our minds alienated,
[1:46:03] darkened to the things of God, becoming
[1:46:05] an immity towards God, hating the things
[1:46:07] of God by an old nature.
[1:46:10] And we were in spiritual amnesia. We
[1:46:11] didn't know who we were. When you have
[1:46:14] amnesia, you don't know who you are. and
[1:46:16] you can't identify yourself.
[1:46:21] He says, "You can walk around, eat, and
[1:46:23] everything, but you still you can't
[1:46:25] identify yourself. You've got your
[1:46:26] scholarly education, some same education
[1:46:29] you had, but you don't know where it
[1:46:31] come from. You don't know who you are,
[1:46:33] where you belong. That's amnesia, so
[1:46:35] we're told."
[1:46:37] He goes on and says, "You said, I don't
[1:46:39] believe that God promised to do these
[1:46:40] things in this last days. Then you've
[1:46:42] listened to a creed or some doctrine
[1:46:44] instead of the Bible. You have spiritual
[1:46:46] amnesia. You don't know where you do
[1:46:48] belong. Then you're confessing a
[1:46:50] Christian and denying the word.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Brings you right back to spiritual
[1:46:55] amnesia again. See, don't know where you
[1:46:57] stand. You got spiritual amnesia. You
[1:46:59] can't identify yourself with the
[1:47:02] scriptures.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; What I was I was ministering this to the
[1:47:07] youth the last youth meeting on
[1:47:09] spiritual amnesia.
[1:47:11] You can't identify yourself with the
[1:47:14] scriptures.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Listen, it's not I can identify myself
[1:47:18] with a church.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; I can identify myself with a pastor. No,
[1:47:25] I can identify myself with a m ministry.
[1:47:27] No,
[1:47:28] I can't identify myself with the word of
[1:47:31] God. I can't find out who I
[1:47:33] [clears throat] am by the word.
[1:47:36] This is the mind of God. This is the
[1:47:40] family album.
[1:47:42] This is where I find my identification.
[1:47:46] Amen. I took the kids and I I took them
[1:47:48] to Malachi 4 and repeated what brother
[1:47:50] Gabe did a few weeks ago when he says,
[1:47:53] you look at Malachi 4 and says, "Behold,
[1:47:55] I that's God send you."
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; That's the mystery.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet. And we believe we
[1:48:02] know who that is.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; William Brandham.
[1:48:08] So those who receive the prophet
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; and receive his mis ministry, who are
[1:48:14] they?
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; I'll go through it again.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Behold, I
[1:48:20] send you
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; So this scripture identifies three
[1:48:27] people.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; That identifies God. It identifies
[1:48:31] Elijah the prophet. And it identifies a
[1:48:34] people who Elijah the prophet was sent
[1:48:36] to.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; So if you've received the ministry of
[1:48:41] Elijah the prophet,
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; who are you?
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Did you just identify yourself
[1:48:49] scripturally?
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; You just identified yourself
[1:48:53] scripturally. You didn't look in your
[1:48:55] mirror. You didn't look at your past.
[1:48:56] You didn't look who your parents were.
[1:48:57] You didn't consider what you done right
[1:48:59] yesterday or wrong yesterday. You found
[1:49:02] your identification in the prophecy for
[1:49:04] this day. I'M PART OF THE PROPHECY.
[1:49:07] BEHOLD, I SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET.
[1:49:11] I'VE RECEIVED that Elijah the prophet.
[1:49:13] SO, HE SENT ME. I'M IN THE WORD.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; I'M PART OF THE WORD.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; I FOUND MY IDENTIFICATION IN THE MIRROR
[1:49:21] OF GOD'S WORD.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; What about where the carcass is, the
[1:49:28] eagles will be gathered.
[1:49:30] What carcass? Brother Bram said, the
[1:49:32] fresh kill of the word where the word is
[1:49:34] fresh for your day.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; The fresh mana that fell. Not the old
[1:49:38] carryover from a previous age. Not what
[1:49:40] had been killed the day before on the
[1:49:41] road, but the fresh kill of the word,
[1:49:44] which is what? The message of the hour.
[1:49:46] And the fresh kill of the word is where
[1:49:48] the eagles are gathered. The question
[1:49:49] is, is this message the fresh kill of
[1:49:52] the word?
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU ATTRACTED to it?
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Are you feeding on it?
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Do you like it? YEAH.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT'S YOUR IDENTIFICATION? ARE YOU
[1:50:02] AN EAGLE
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; BASED OFF WHAT? THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT
[1:50:05] YOURSELF. NO. BASED OFF THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:50:07] I'M AN EAGLE. I FOUND MY IDENTIFICATION
[1:50:10] IN THE WORD TO BREAK MY AMNESIA.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BUT I CAN'T CALL MYSELF AN
[1:50:16] EAGLE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID
[1:50:17] YESTERDAY." LISTEN, I DON'T CARE WHAT
[1:50:18] YOU DID YESTERDAY. I'M LOOKING AT THE
[1:50:20] PROMISE FOR THIS HOUR. AND THERE'S GOT
[1:50:22] TO BE A PEOPLE WHO CAN IDENTIFY
[1:50:24] THEMSELVES WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND STOP
[1:50:26] RELYING ON FEELINGS AND STOP GOING UP
[1:50:29] AND DOWN EVERY FIVE MINUTES BUT COME
[1:50:31] BACK TO THE BASIS OF FAITH IN THE WORD
[1:50:33] AND FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE BY THE WRITTEN
[1:50:35] WORD.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; THIS DOESN'T CHANGE YOUR EMOTIONS
[1:50:38] CHANGE. THIS DOESN'T CHANGE YOUR YOUR
[1:50:41] IDEAS CHANGE. YOUR EMOTIONS CHANGE. YOUR
[1:50:44] RESOLVE TO DO GOOD CHANGES.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; But this word can't change.
[1:50:51] We have to find our identification in
[1:50:54] the word.
[1:50:57] Amen. Who am I? I'm an eagle.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Who am I? I'm one of those that God sent
[1:51:06] Elijah the prophet to.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; I'm part of the end time sequence. I'm
[1:51:10] part of the program. I'm part of the
[1:51:12] prophecy.
[1:51:14] That prophecy wasn't just to identify
[1:51:16] William Brandham. That prophecy also
[1:51:19] identified me.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; It's who I am.
[1:51:25] Praise God. Brother Benham says again,
[1:51:28] spiritual amnesia. You that wants the
[1:51:30] Holy Spirit, you that wants that
[1:51:32] experience, not an emotional excitement.
[1:51:33] You want the Holy Ghost, the life, the
[1:51:35] germ of life inside you. And you want to
[1:51:38] get rid of that amnesia that's making
[1:51:39] you can't identify yourself. You don't
[1:51:41] know where you stand. You don't know
[1:51:43] what you are. Let's get rid of it right
[1:51:45] now. There's a new birth here for you.
[1:51:47] to a real genuine new birth.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Born of incorruptible seed by the word
[1:51:53] of God. Let the spirit come and quicken
[1:51:55] that word to life.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam tells this story and I love
[1:52:00] the story. We all talk about the eagle
[1:52:02] story,
[1:52:03] but we don't often talk about the duck
[1:52:05] story.
[1:52:08] It's what brother Benham said. And God
[1:52:09] who is rich in mercy said, "I heard a
[1:52:11] similar little story. I hope it don't
[1:52:13] sound sacriiggious about a little duck
[1:52:15] being born under a hen one time. He
[1:52:18] couldn't understand a funnyl looking
[1:52:19] little fellow, odd guy, and he couldn't
[1:52:21] understand the dust and everything. They
[1:52:23] were playing in the barnyard. But one
[1:52:25] day, the old hen led the little brood
[1:52:27] out beyond the behind the barn and he
[1:52:29] got a smell of water.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Well, he took out towards that water as
[1:52:33] hard as he could go. Why? He had never
[1:52:36] been on a pond before. He had never been
[1:52:38] in the water, but he was a duck to begin
[1:52:41] with.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Only thing he had to do was come to
[1:52:44] himself. That's the same thing the
[1:52:46] believer is. There is something in him
[1:52:48] that when he meets God face to face, he
[1:52:50] comes to himself. That seed is in him
[1:52:53] and it's quickened. My, that's right.
[1:52:55] And he flies away from the things of the
[1:52:57] world, they become dead to him. My I
[1:52:59] remember uh I remember we all had our
[1:53:01] life in the past and those things of the
[1:53:03] world. But once we got a hold of the
[1:53:05] real thing, something that quickened us,
[1:53:07] a little seed that comes to life, then
[1:53:09] all the things of the world rotted right
[1:53:11] there. We had no more desire of it.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; We heard the eagle story, but now we
[1:53:16] hear the duck story.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT LITTLE DUCK, ALL HIS LIFE,
[1:53:20] DUST IN THE DIRT AND THE barnyard and
[1:53:22] all that, but once he got near the
[1:53:24] water, the smell OF THE WATER ATTRACTED
[1:53:26] HIM. It didn't have a pull on the
[1:53:28] chickens. that had a pull on him because
[1:53:31] inside HE WAS A DUCK. GENETICALLY HE WAS
[1:53:34] A DUCK. NOBODY HAD TO TEACH HIM. NOBODY
[1:53:36] HAD TO PERSUADE HIM. NOBODY HAD to
[1:53:38] convince him because it was in him TO BE
[1:53:40] A DUCK. AND THE SMELL OF WATER WASN'T
[1:53:43] ATTRACTED TO HIM. AND HE WENT AS hard as
[1:53:45] HE COULD RIGHT INTO THE WATER. AND GUESS
[1:53:46] WHAT? NOBODY HAD TO TEACH HIM HOW TO
[1:53:48] SWIM. HE WENT RIGHT IN AND STARTED
[1:53:50] SWIMMING. WHY? HE WAS GENETICALLY BUILT
[1:53:53] TO BE A DUCK. AMEN.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU WERE PROGRAMMED BEFORE THE
[1:53:58] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD TO BE A BELIEVER
[1:54:00] IN THIS END TIME TO BE PART OF THE
[1:54:02] MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; To be THE WORD MADE MANIFEST. YOU WERE
[1:54:07] PROGRAMMED. AND WHEN YOU SAW IT, WHEN
[1:54:09] YOU HEARD IT, SOMETHING IN YOU, YOU
[1:54:11] CAUGHT A WHIFF of it. And you may HAVE
[1:54:13] HEARD IT WITH FRIENDS AND YOU MAY HAVE
[1:54:14] HEARD IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE. AND THEY MAY
[1:54:15] HAVE STRAYED AWAY. AND THEY MAY HAVE
[1:54:17] SAID THEY DON'T LIKE IT. THEY MAY HAVE
[1:54:18] GOT IN THE WATER AND GOT BACK OUT AND
[1:54:20] SAID, "THAT'S NOT FOR ME." BUT IT
[1:54:21] DOESN'T change you. YOU CAN'T CHANGE
[1:54:24] BECAUSE THIS IS WHO YOU ARE.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; LISTEN,
[1:54:30] this message for me is something more
[1:54:32] than what I believe.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; It's who I am.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; And I believe it because it's who I am.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; This message identified who I was.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; It took the spiritual amnesia away. It I
[1:54:46] heard my father calling and all of a
[1:54:48] sudden realized I'm a son.
[1:54:50] I'm a son not because I'm worthy. I'm a
[1:54:53] son not because I worked my way up to
[1:54:55] I'm a son because I heard my father
[1:54:57] calling.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; And something in me responded.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:55:06] Listen friends, [laughter] this is this
[1:55:08] is life.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; This message isn't a gospel preaching
[1:55:13] plus some truths attached.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; This message is the gospel.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the good news. It is the way
[1:55:21] of salvation for our day. It is the
[1:55:24] program of God. It is deliverance. It is
[1:55:26] our rescue. It is our healing. It is our
[1:55:29] restoration.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; It's not the first four, the the the New
[1:55:34] Testament corrected and now with a
[1:55:36] little more life. It's not that,
[1:55:38] friends. It's more than that. This is
[1:55:40] Jesus Christ, our bridegroom, coming to
[1:55:42] connect with you.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Bringing the fullness of who he is,
[1:55:45] showing you the fullness of who you are.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. giving us the confidence that we
[1:55:50] can move away from traditions, move away
[1:55:52] from our own thinking and accept what's
[1:55:54] not possible.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Listen, when when the angel came to Mary
[1:56:01] the virgin in Nazareth and said,
[1:56:03] "Listen, time for the word to be
[1:56:05] fulfilled. I was sent to send you and
[1:56:07] tell you that you're the one."
[1:56:10] Listen, that was not reasonable.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:13] This one woman in Nazareth, 16 years old
[1:56:17] or so, engaged to a man, she believed
[1:56:21] something that was not even reasonable.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; and besides that, can you imagine the
[1:56:28] audacity of a 16-year-old girl, not born
[1:56:31] in nobility, not from a priest family,
[1:56:33] ignorant as ignorant can be, doesn't
[1:56:35] even know, doesn't even have the Bible
[1:56:36] verses memorized. What right does she
[1:56:38] have to say that I'm the fulfillment of
[1:56:40] Isaiah 7?
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; I'm sure priests would look at her, she
[1:56:45] would say that, they would just scorn
[1:56:46] and say, "What arrogance,
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; what pride,
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; how can you say a thing like that?" She
[1:56:53] could say it cuz she believed it.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; She could say it because the angel
[1:56:58] messenger that was sent her told her who
[1:57:00] she was. LISTEN, THIS ISN'T ARROGANCE
[1:57:03] THAT GOD WHEN GOD REVEALS who you are
[1:57:04] AND YOU SAY, "I'M A CHILD OF GOD. I
[1:57:06] MEAN, FROM THE FOR FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:57:08] WORLD, I'M PART OF HIS BRIDE." THERE'S
[1:57:10] NOT ARROGANCE. I MEAN, SOMEBODY CAN HAVE
[1:57:12] ARROGANCE, BUT THAT'S NOT AN ARROGANT
[1:57:13] STATEMENT BECAUSE AN ANGEL MESSENGER
[1:57:15] came to TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; AND HE GAVE YOU THE WORD FOR YOUR DAY
[1:57:19] AND something in you, it resonated. IT
[1:57:21] WAS THUMP THUMP. THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; I'M IDENTIFIED NOT BY MY good deeds. I'M
[1:57:26] NOT IDENTIFIED BY MY SCHOLARLY
[1:57:28] INTELLECT. I'M NOT IDENTIFIED BY THIS.
[1:57:30] I'M IDENTIFIED BY THE VERY FACT THAT
[1:57:32] WHEN ELIJAH WAS SENT TO ME, I RECEIVED
[1:57:35] IT.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. And amen.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Let's get back to the simplicity of
[1:57:43] faith.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "The seed of God is
[1:57:49] actually placed in us from the
[1:57:50] foundation of the world. When that light
[1:57:53] first strikes that seed, it brings it to
[1:57:54] life. But the light first has to come
[1:57:56] upon the seed." Like I've taught many
[1:57:59] times of the little woman at the well
[1:58:00] and her that condition. Though she be
[1:58:02] ill fame, though her life was degraded,
[1:58:04] she was in that condition because that
[1:58:06] traditions had never touched her. But
[1:58:08] when the light first struck her, quickly
[1:58:10] she recognized it because there was
[1:58:12] something there to respond to it. When
[1:58:14] the deep calleth through the deep, there
[1:58:16] must be a deep somewhere to respond to
[1:58:18] that call. Oh friends, if there's
[1:58:21] something deep in you to respond to the
[1:58:22] call, then you should thank God every
[1:58:24] day of your life. Best day, worst day,
[1:58:27] good things, bad things, you should
[1:58:28] thank God every moment of your life
[1:58:30] because there was something deep in me
[1:58:31] to respond to this deep. I didn't work
[1:58:34] my way up into it. I didn't try to
[1:58:36] believe. Amen. I there was just
[1:58:37] something in me that believed.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; What's that? That's the real gift.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; That's the real gift. It wasn't a brain
[1:58:46] strain.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; It was a natural reaction.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Listen, when I come to the message, my
[1:58:52] brain was twisted up in knots, but
[1:58:54] something inside of me was believing.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; I was confused as all as all get out
[1:58:59] because I had been raised in what I
[1:59:00] thought was the truth and was perfectly
[1:59:02] understandable. It was right. And then
[1:59:04] we know this is absolutely right. And
[1:59:05] the message came and ripped my whole
[1:59:07] understanding upside down and twisted me
[1:59:09] all IN KNOTS. BUT IT WASN'T MY MIND that
[1:59:11] brought me to the message. IT WAS
[1:59:13] SOMETHING INSIDE THAT COULD NOT stay
[1:59:15] away from it. It was irresistible to me.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH it was harmful TO MY MIND,
[1:59:21] IT WAS HARMFUL to my flesh. BUT IN MY
[1:59:24] SOUL, IT WAS IRRESISTIBLE. I COULDN'T
[1:59:26] stay away.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:59:31] Brother Beam said back in the Smyrna
[1:59:33] church age he speaks of Jacob. He says
[1:59:36] so it was the thought AND THEN THAT
[1:59:38] THOUGHT BECAME expressed and so God
[1:59:40] bought back Jacob because Jacob alone
[1:59:42] was seed.
[1:59:45] Jacob alone had the seed. That is why he
[1:59:47] had respect to the birthright and
[1:59:48] covenant of God. If you are true seed,
[1:59:51] you will hear that word. The spirit will
[1:59:53] baptize you into the body of Christ
[1:59:55] filling you and empowering you and you
[1:59:56] will receive the word for your day and
[1:59:58] age. See how clear the true evidence
[2:00:00] becomes when the word is revealed to
[2:00:03] you.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Who was the better boy, Esau or Jacob?
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Who took better care of their daddy,
[2:00:12] Esau or Jacob?
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Beam said Esau was a much better
[2:00:16] man.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Took better care of his dad. Had a
[2:00:20] better works program.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Far outshine Jacob.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; But but it didn't matter,
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; right? Jacob was the predestinated seed.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Jacob was a mama's boy. He was a shyer.
[2:00:34] He was a cheat.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; And he was a predestinated seed gene of
[2:00:40] God.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; He would eventually have to wrestle that
[2:00:43] out with the angel and be changed and
[2:00:44] change his walk and change everything
[2:00:46] about. He was going to have to come to a
[2:00:48] change. Absolutely. But what he was
[2:00:50] before, Amen, didn't determine what what
[2:00:53] he was in his natural life as a boy did
[2:00:55] not determine what he was. what he was
[2:00:57] in the mind of God determined what he
[2:00:59] would be.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; He had to go through his corrections. He
[2:01:03] had to go through his journey. He had to
[2:01:05] meet God face to face. He had to have
[2:01:07] his WALK CHANGED. HE HAD to wrestle it
[2:01:09] out with God. He had to go through all
[2:01:10] of these things. Absolutely. Amen. But
[2:01:13] it wasn't anything he did that make him
[2:01:15] a child of God. He came to the earth a
[2:01:17] segene of God.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; That's why God dealt with him the way
[2:01:22] that he did.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:25] Brother Bram tells in the message
[2:01:27] communion. This is the last message that
[2:01:29] he preaches before God takes him home.
[2:01:31] And it's a small meeting, an intimate
[2:01:33] meeting there in the in the tabernacle
[2:01:35] in Tucson. And he begins to talk to them
[2:01:39] in the communion service. He said, "See,
[2:01:40] there's a little grain of life laying
[2:01:42] there that you wonder where did it come
[2:01:44] from? What these strange things?" I was
[2:01:48] saying this taking for myself like you
[2:01:49] was going to say William Brandon. Well,
[2:01:51] 40 years ago, the William Brham, it
[2:01:53] isn't the same one tonight. If somebody
[2:01:56] back there would say William Brandham,
[2:01:58] he was a rank rascal. See, because I was
[2:02:00] born of Charles and Ella Brandham. In
[2:02:02] their nature, I was a sinner. I came to
[2:02:04] the world a liar and all the habits of
[2:02:06] the world laid right in me. But down in
[2:02:08] there, too, was another nature present.
[2:02:10] See, predestinated was in there by God
[2:02:14] in this same body. See, two natures in
[2:02:16] there. Well, I only catered to the one.
[2:02:18] As it growed, I I grewed as a baby. Da
[2:02:21] da. First thing you know, I became a
[2:02:22] liar. Became everything else that is
[2:02:24] that's a sinner because I raised up that
[2:02:26] way. But down in there was a little
[2:02:29] speck of life all the time.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; What was it? There was another William
[2:02:35] Brandham. See, a little spot of eternal
[2:02:38] life down there from the genes of God.
[2:02:39] The word of God that was placed in
[2:02:41] there. Each one of you can think of
[2:02:44] similar things. See, it was working.
[2:02:46] Then look up to the trees and think,
[2:02:47] "Leaf, I seen you fall off last year.
[2:02:49] And why are you why are you back there
[2:02:51] again? Where'd you come from? What
[2:02:53] brought you here?" See, it was that
[2:02:55] eternal life working in the body. Now
[2:02:58] then, one day as I walked on, that voice
[2:03:00] talked, "Don't never smoke, drink, so
[2:03:02] forth." And the young fellas and all got
[2:03:04] and and all got older. See, there was
[2:03:06] something moving. But yet, all at once,
[2:03:09] I looked up and I said, "I'm not the son
[2:03:11] of Charles and Ella Brandon.
[2:03:14] There's something calling me like my
[2:03:17] little eagle. I'm not a chicken. There's
[2:03:19] something up yonder somewhere. Oh, great
[2:03:21] Jehovah, whoever you are, open up. I
[2:03:24] want to come home. There's something in
[2:03:26] me calling. Then I was born again. That
[2:03:30] little life was laying there. The life
[2:03:31] of the water was poured on it. Then it
[2:03:33] began to grow. Now that old life was
[2:03:35] forgiven, put in the sea of God's
[2:03:37] forgetfulness to never be remembered
[2:03:39] against me no more. Now we stand
[2:03:41] justified as though we never had sinned
[2:03:43] in the presence of God.
[2:03:46] Praise God. Brother Bam sitting there
[2:03:48] telling us his own conversion story. And
[2:03:50] he's recognizing that he didn't receive
[2:03:53] the segene of God when he confessed the
[2:03:56] word. He always had it. He had to come
[2:03:58] in contact with the word to awaken it.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; And he tells us we're the same way.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; We come wrong. We were all kinds of
[2:04:08] different things and we've done all
[2:04:10] kinds of different things
[2:04:12] as we've got backgrounds and histories
[2:04:14] and we've got failures after coming to
[2:04:16] the Lord.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; We've got all things in our flesh to
[2:04:20] distract us and we got all kinds of
[2:04:22] signals signaling to us that maybe we're
[2:04:24] wrong and maybe we're this and maybe
[2:04:26] we're that. But there's something inside
[2:04:29] that one day wakes up and says, "I'm not
[2:04:32] the son of Charles and Elabbrand."
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; What does that mean?
[2:04:37] He's saying, "I'm the son of God."
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; There's got to be an a spiritual
[2:04:43] awakening. There's got to be the
[2:04:45] breaking of spiritual amnesia. Amen. The
[2:04:47] confusion about who I am has to leave.
[2:04:50] And I have to find out that this word
[2:04:52] that's [clears throat] calling me is
[2:04:53] calling me.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. NOT A GENERAL CALL THAT the word is
[2:05:00] calling the no but this word is calling
[2:05:03] me
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; because something in me is responding to
[2:05:06] the word and if something in me is
[2:05:08] responding to the word then the word
[2:05:10] finds the word and the word finds the
[2:05:13] word and that means if I'm attracted to
[2:05:15] the word only the word is attracted to
[2:05:18] the word and if I'm attracted to the
[2:05:19] word then I must be
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; word
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS I CAME FROM THE MIND OF GOD
[2:05:25] THAT MEANS THERE'S SOMETHING IN ME TO
[2:05:27] BELIEVE WITH.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; And there wasn't something in ME TO
[2:05:30] BELIEVE WITH, I COULDN'T BELIEVE.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD. THAT'S MY
[2:05:36] IDENTIFICATION. NOT THE GOOD DEEDS I'VE
[2:05:39] DONE OR THE BAD DEEDS I'VE DONE. I'M I
[2:05:41] PRAISE GOD THAT I HOPE IN THE FUTURE TO
[2:05:43] do good deeds.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; AND I'M ASHAMED TO SAY THAT I'LL
[2:05:46] PROBABLY DO BAD DEEDS.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; But one thing I KNOW IS I CANNOT MAKE
[2:05:50] THOSE MY IDENTIFICATION. I can't make
[2:05:52] works or signs or wonders my
[2:05:53] identification because at THE WHITE
[2:05:55] THRONE JUDGMENT THAT PROVED NOT TO BE
[2:05:56] ENOUGH.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NEITHER CAN I MAKE MY BAD DEEDS MY
[2:06:01] IDENTIFICATION BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S HAD
[2:06:03] THEM.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING ELSE
[2:06:06] THAT I CAN IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH AND FIND
[2:06:08] MY IDENTITY. AND I CAN FIND MY IDENTITY
[2:06:11] IN THE WORD. I CAN SCRIPTURALLY IDENTIFY
[2:06:13] WHO I AM. I AM A CHILD OF God
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; because of the word.
[2:06:20] because something in me received this
[2:06:23] word.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, what a privileged people we
[2:06:28] are.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Listen, what's the real gift? There's
[2:06:32] all kinds of gifts given to the church.
[2:06:34] There's gifts of tongues. There's gifts
[2:06:36] of interpretation of tongues, gifts of
[2:06:37] wisdom, gifts of knowledge. There's even
[2:06:39] gifts of giving. There's there's all
[2:06:41] kinds of gifts and helps and things that
[2:06:43] are given. There's the gift of the Holy
[2:06:44] Ghost. There's so many gifts given to
[2:06:46] the church. But Brother Brandham said
[2:06:48] the real gift is that soul. Amen.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; That soul that came from God, that gene
[2:06:52] of God that's in there. And if you find
[2:06:54] in yourself something that can believe
[2:06:57] this message despite all circumstances,
[2:06:59] but it still resonates with the word,
[2:07:01] then we can get on our knees and say,
[2:07:03] "Thank you, God, for that gift. Thank
[2:07:05] you for giving me the gift to believe.
[2:07:07] Thank you for placing SOMETHING IN ME.
[2:07:08] MY MIND WOULD HAVE NEVER been enough. My
[2:07:10] willpower would have never been enough.
[2:07:12] But there's something that's more than
[2:07:14] me in me that keeps bringing me back to
[2:07:16] this word."
[2:07:18] And that's my identification. And I
[2:07:20] thank God for it. That's the real I
[2:07:22] couldn't put it there. I can't
[2:07:23] manufacture it. I can't copy it. It's
[2:07:26] either there or it's not there. And it's
[2:07:27] there by the predestinated will of God.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; If it's there, all I can say is thank
[2:07:32] you, Lord Jesus.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; And God, you've stripped away my
[2:07:36] spiritual amnesia and now I'm no longer
[2:07:39] an identity crisis. [snorts]
[2:07:43] You know, sometimes we get an identity
[2:07:45] crisis
[2:07:47] because we we we can't clearly identify
[2:07:50] who we are.
[2:07:52] Am I a believer or am I not a believer?
[2:07:56] One day I'm a believer, the next day I'm
[2:07:57] not a believer. So, one day when I'm a
[2:08:00] believer, I feel like I'm close to God.
[2:08:01] Next day I'm not a believer. I feel like
[2:08:03] I'm I'm out of the program of God. One
[2:08:04] day I feel like, yeah, I'm probably
[2:08:06] bride. The next day I feel like I'm
[2:08:07] probably not bride. Listen, what kind of
[2:08:09] manifestation will that have?
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:08:13] Is that confusion?
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Do we all struggle with it?
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; But that confusion will keep our life
[2:08:21] topsyturvy back and forth bringing us
[2:08:23] into amnesia. And brother Bham said, one
[2:08:25] thing that brings amnesia is being halt
[2:08:26] between two opinions.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Am I talking about not child of God?
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Why? The question is, how are we
[2:08:35] identifying ourselves?
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ted, yesterday.
[2:08:40] What about yesterday?
[2:08:43] How's that an identificate? Yesterday I
[2:08:44] said something to my wife. It was a
[2:08:46] little sharp.
[2:08:48] Yeah, that was wrong. Repent.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Say you're sorry. But what does that
[2:08:53] have to do with your sunship?
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; How is that your identification?
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, Brother Brandham's wife slammed
[2:09:02] the door in his face.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter]
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was going to trick his
[2:09:07] wife into going up.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean,
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; we all do wrong. BUT WHAT? BUT I I'M
[2:09:14] THIS, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW MY PAST, BUT
[2:09:15] you don't know how bad I've been. No.
[2:09:16] No. Listen.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Can you find your identification in the
[2:09:21] scriptures?
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Do you see your place in the word? Can
[2:09:25] you find yourself part of the program of
[2:09:28] God for this end time? If you can find
[2:09:30] your identification in the scriptures
[2:09:32] and in faith in the word that's promised
[2:09:35] for this day, that identification can
[2:09:38] trump all other IDENTIFICATIONS AND PUT
[2:09:40] IT all to rest so that we can finally
[2:09:42] get the right identification. Father, I
[2:09:45] hear THE VOICE OF MY FATHER. I heard
[2:09:47] this message. It's the VOICE OF MY
[2:09:49] FATHER. I heard the voice of MY FATHER.
[2:09:53] I DIDN'T HEAR THE VOICE OF A FATHER. I
[2:09:56] didn't hear THE VOICE OF THE FATHER. I
[2:09:57] HEARD THE VOICE OF MY FATHER.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; AND IF I HEARD MY FATHER CALLING ME,
[2:10:02] THEN I'M HIS SON.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; The great shepherd come and found me.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; And I heard his voice and something in
[2:10:14] me trusted that voice and wanted to
[2:10:16] follow him.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; That makes me his sheep.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I found the fresh kill of
[2:10:23] the word for my day and it tasted good
[2:10:25] to me and I wanted to eat it. That makes
[2:10:28] me eagle.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; I'm an eagle sheep son.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; And a recipient of Malachi 4.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; I found MY IDENTIFICATION IN THE WORD.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; NOT IN MY FLESH, IN THE WORD. NOT IN MY
[2:10:41] PAST, IN THE WORD.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; And now I can stand upon the word and
[2:10:47] declare I am a child of God. Amen.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; God, help me from my mistakes. God,
[2:10:54] please cleanse me from my errors and
[2:10:56] fails. God, forgive me for all that I do
[2:10:58] wrong, but I know I belong to you. I
[2:11:00] know I came from you. I'm like the wind.
[2:11:02] Nobody else may be able to determine
[2:11:03] where I came from or where I'm going,
[2:11:05] but I came from somewhere and I'm going
[2:11:06] somewhere. And you're meeting me in my
[2:11:09] journey, and you're sensing the rustling
[2:11:10] of the leaves and hearing the THE WIND
[2:11:12] BLOW BY AS I COME BY. BUT I KNOW WHERE I
[2:11:15] came from now. By the new birth, BY
[2:11:16] SPIRITUAL BIRTH, I CAME FROM GOD. I'M
[2:11:19] GOING BACK TO God
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God. I've been redeemed
[2:11:23] by the blood of Jesus Christ. When he
[2:11:25] shed that blood, HE WAS BUYING ME BACK
[2:11:28] BECAUSE HE CAME AND HE BOUGHT THE FIELD
[2:11:30] TO GET THE PEARL. AND I'M PART OF THE
[2:11:32] PEARL,
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; which is his bride, his people. I'm part
[2:11:37] of it.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; I'm part of the program. I'm the
[2:11:40] recipient of the prophecy. I found my
[2:11:42] true identification.
[2:11:44] And I found in me the real gift and I'm
[2:11:47] thankful for that.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Let's stand
[2:11:50] together.
[2:11:52] Musicians, if you'll please come. And
[2:11:54] Blake, if you'll come, please.
[2:11:56] I want to read one more scripture
[2:11:59] together as we're standing.
[2:12:03] And because you are sons,
[2:12:06] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[2:12:08] into your hearts crying, "Aba, Father."
[2:12:12] What makes us cry back, father? Because
[2:12:15] we are sons.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; And because we are sons, he sent us the
[2:12:20] spirit of his son
[2:12:23] into our hearts crying, "Aba, father."
[2:12:27] God sent his spirit to wake up that seed
[2:12:30] of God so we could cry out, "You are my
[2:12:33] father.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; You are my father and I'm your son. And
[2:12:37] no matter what happens to me on this
[2:12:39] life, I've got that revelation of who I
[2:12:43] am. This is why, listen, all the bad
[2:12:46] circumstances in the world can't smudge
[2:12:48] this out.
[2:12:50] Your own failure and mistake can't
[2:12:52] smudge this out. The whole world turning
[2:12:54] upside down and against you can't smudge
[2:12:56] this out. This is a revelation based on
[2:12:58] his word, not on external circumstances.
[2:13:02] When we come to this revelation and have
[2:13:04] the spiritual amnesia removed from us,
[2:13:06] then all of a sudden on my worst day,
[2:13:09] I'm a son of God.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; On my best day, I'm a son of God. In
[2:13:14] every day and in every circumstances,
[2:13:16] when things go against me, I'm a son of
[2:13:18] God. When things go for me, I'm a son of
[2:13:20] God because my revelation is based off
[2:13:23] his word.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; I heard his voice. Amen. Let's bow our
[2:13:27] heads together and just thank God. Lord
[2:13:30] Jesus, we thank you for this word, Lord.
[2:13:33] God, you have showed us through your
[2:13:35] word, God, that we're not here by
[2:13:38] accident.
[2:13:39] And we're not believers by accident. We
[2:13:42] didn't stumble upon something, Lord, and
[2:13:45] as [clears throat] if we tripped over
[2:13:47] you and accidentally found you. That may
[2:13:50] be our humanistic perspective, but God,
[2:13:53] you were waiting in the way. You knew
[2:13:56] the way we would take. And just like you
[2:13:58] had an appointment in Samaria with a
[2:14:00] woman coming to the well, you had an
[2:14:02] appointment with us. And you made sure
[2:14:04] that we would bump into you along the
[2:14:06] way somewhere so that you could give us
[2:14:09] your word.
[2:14:10] And that word would identify us like it
[2:14:13] did the woman at the well, God, like it
[2:14:16] did all of your children down through
[2:14:18] time. We've come in contact with this
[2:14:20] manifestation of the word, and it
[2:14:23] quickened us to life.
[2:14:25] Your spirit came upon the word and it
[2:14:27] woke us up to who we really are. And
[2:14:30] God, now we want to live to the fullness
[2:14:32] of that life.
[2:14:34] God, I don't want to stay halt between
[2:14:35] two opinions. That means no forward
[2:14:38] progress.
[2:14:40] I don't want to be going around the same
[2:14:41] question trying to answer again and
[2:14:43] again whether or not I'm a son of God.
[2:14:45] If I stay there, I'm making no progress.
[2:14:48] But Lord, you've called us into
[2:14:50] adoption. You've called us to grow up
[2:14:53] into the full measure of the stature of
[2:14:54] Christ. God, you've called us to move
[2:14:57] from faith under temperance and on and
[2:15:00] on and on to perfect love. God, help us,
[2:15:03] Lord, answer the questions that are in
[2:15:05] our lives.
[2:15:06] Lord, we pray you by your word quiet the
[2:15:09] voice of the enemy. Silence the lies of
[2:15:12] the devil and may your word become our
[2:15:16] truth, our light, our portion.
[2:15:20] God, bring us higher and higher in this
[2:15:22] revelation. May we get further and
[2:15:24] further from the world and the carnality
[2:15:26] that's associated. And may we realize
[2:15:28] with clearer vision all the time who we
[2:15:31] really are. And God, may that change our
[2:15:33] conduct. May it change the way we
[2:15:35] conduct ourselves in this world. May it
[2:15:37] change the way we face every day of our
[2:15:39] lives. May we have, Lord, that uh
[2:15:41] inspiration and understanding that will
[2:15:44] guide us through life. God, I give you
[2:15:46] my life aresh again. And I thank you for
[2:15:50] the gift you placed within me before the
[2:15:52] foundation of the world. [music] A gift
[2:15:54] of faith that could believe your word.
[2:15:57] Love you and thank you for it, Lord, in
[2:16:00] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:16:04] Amen. God bless you. We'll be back here,
[2:16:07] Lord willing, at 4 p.m. Amen.
[2:16:11] Well, I'm resting on [singing] the
[2:16:14] finished [music] work of Jesus Christ
[2:16:18] today.
[2:16:20] All circumstances [music and singing]
[2:16:22] will be gone. The word of God will still

[2:16:30] guilt or sin [music] can have control
[2:16:34] and worry me. The keys [singing] of

[2:21:53] All things [music]
[2:21:56] are possible with God. [music]
[2:22:01] It's Jesus
[2:22:05] I really [music and singing]
[2:22:07] want to see.
[2:22:12] [music]
[2:22:14] Well, [singing]
[2:22:15] it's Jesus
[2:22:18] that I really [music]
[2:22:21] [singing] want to see.
[2:22:27] [music] And the more [singing]
[2:22:31] I see of this old world, the less
[2:22:37] [singing]
[2:22:38] it [music] means to me.
[2:22:42] For it's [music and singing] Jesus
[2:22:46] that I really
[2:22:49] want to [singing] see once more.
[2:22:54] [music]
[2:22:55] Where [singing] is Jesus?
[2:22:59] [music] I really [singing] want to see.
[2:23:06] [music]
[2:23:09] Oh, it's Jesus
[2:23:13] that I [singing]
[2:23:14] really [music]
[2:23:16] want to see.
[2:23:19] Want to see. [music]
[2:23:23] And [singing]
[2:23:24] the more I see
[2:23:28] this old world, the [music] less
[2:23:32] [singing]
[2:23:33] it means to me.
[2:23:36] Lord, it's Jesus [music]
[2:23:41] that I [singing] really
[2:23:43] want to see. [music]
[2:23:52] Little
[2:23:53] [singing] by little,
[2:23:57] I'm changing. [music]
[2:23:59] I'm growing.
[2:24:03] Little
[2:24:05] my [singing]
[2:24:06] little
[2:24:08] I [music] know that it's your
[2:24:14] I'm not who [singing] I'll be [music]
[2:24:16] but I'm not who I was.
[2:24:20] I'm [music and singing] somewhere in the
[2:24:23] middle.
[2:24:26] God is changing [music and singing]
[2:24:29] me
[2:24:30] little by little.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it [singing] seems that I'm so
[2:24:41] far away
[2:24:43] from all I want [music and singing]
[2:24:45] someday to be.
[2:24:49] But [singing] his word said that'll
[2:24:52] finish one [music] day
[2:24:55] all that he started in me.
[2:24:59] [music and singing]
[2:25:01] I look at me and I don't understand.
[2:25:05] [singing]
[2:25:06] But God has a vision. God has a [music]
[2:25:11] plan.
[2:25:12] [singing]
[2:25:15] Oh, [music]
[2:25:17] little
[2:25:19] by little. [singing]
[2:25:21] [music]
[2:25:22] I'm changing.
[2:25:25] I'm growing. [singing]
[2:25:28] Little home, [music] my little [singing]
[2:25:32] home.
[2:25:34] I know that it's [music and singing]
[2:25:37] showing
[2:25:40] I'm not who I'll be, but I'm not who I
[2:25:44] was.
[2:25:46] I'm somewhere [music and singing]
[2:25:48] in the middle.
[2:25:51] God [music and singing] is changing
[2:25:56] little by [music and singing] little.
[2:25:58] little sometimes.
[2:26:02] [music]
[2:26:03] Sometimes it seems that I'm so far away
[2:26:07] [singing]
[2:26:08] from all [music] I want someday to be.
[2:26:15] But [music] his word [singing] says that
[2:26:17] he'll finish one day
[2:26:20] all that he started [singing]
[2:26:22] in me. [music]
[2:26:26] I look at me and I don't understand.
[2:26:30] [singing]
[2:26:31] But God has a vision. [music]
[2:26:35] God has a plan.
[2:26:38] [singing]
[2:26:41] Oh,
[2:26:43] [music]
[2:26:44] my little
[2:26:47] I'm changing. [music and singing]
[2:26:50] I'm growing.
[2:26:53] Little
[2:26:55] by little. [singing]
[2:26:58] I know [music]
[2:27:00] that it's showing.
[2:27:04] I'm not who [singing] I'll be, [music]
[2:27:07] but I'm not who I was.
[2:27:10] I'm somewhere [singing]
[2:27:12] in the [music] middle.
[2:27:16] God is changing
[2:27:21] little [singing] by little. [music]
[2:27:27] Lift your wings,
[2:27:31] little [singing] legal,
[2:27:34] and fly.
[2:27:39] You [singing] weren't born for the
[2:27:43] valley, [music and singing]
[2:27:45] you were born for the sky.
[2:27:51] Don't let [music and singing] your
[2:27:52] trials
[2:27:53] ever get you down. Drive your spirit
[2:27:58] [music] so [singing] close to the
[2:28:00] ground.
[2:28:02] Bound up with wings, [music]
[2:28:06] little [singing] leg
[2:28:09] and fly.
[2:28:13] [music]
[2:28:13] Now [singing] lift your wings
[2:28:17] a little
[2:28:20] and fly.
[2:28:25] [music] You [singing] weren't born for
[2:28:29] the valley. [music]
[2:28:32] You were born [singing]
[2:28:34] for the sky.
[2:28:37] Don't let your [music] trials
[2:28:40] ever get [singing] you down. Drive your
[2:28:44] spirit [music]
[2:28:45] so close to the ground.
[2:28:49] Mountain up with wings,
[2:28:51] [music and singing]
[2:28:52] little eagle,
[2:28:56] and fly.
[2:29:00] Now lift your wings, [singing]
[2:29:03] [music]
[2:29:04] little eagle
[2:29:07] and fly.
[2:29:12] You [music and singing] weren't born for
[2:29:15] the valley.
[2:29:18] You [music] were born for the sky.
[2:29:23] Don't [music and singing] let your
[2:29:24] trials
[2:29:26] ever get you down. Drive your spirit
[2:29:30] [singing]
[2:29:31] so close [music] to the ground.
[2:29:34] Bound up with wings [music]
[2:29:38] that'll le
[2:29:42] and fly.
