preeminence and the service now is maybe it seems to be a long day for some already and there's many demands upon our time and attention and our thoughts as the monday begins to encroach lord may we just again set everything aside now look to you come break the bread of life and may we partake in a spiritual feast now lord feasting at your table the word being rightly divided in it nourishing our soul before we come to the communion table lord to partake in a divine ordinance that you've asked us to keep and lord there's happiness and joy in obeying those things and doing those things so lord i believe you're pleased may you come now may your presence be felt may your word have preeminence bless your people we pray the name lord jesus christ amen amen i'm just going to read again from revelations chapter 10 verses 8 to 11. revelations chapter 10 and verses 8 to 11. again i want to reiterate it's a wonderful privilege to be together with you we've enjoyed the fellowship we've had through the years and brother chad and i were fellowshipping on one of the first times i ever preached here at your church and he remembers it maybe a little bit differently than i do but he remembers that i was preaching a sermon i was just a young really really young almost 20 years ago maybe um and i was talking about the rivalry between coke and pepsi and then he says that i said but dr pepper's the right one baby uh-huh and uh i uh i don't know that i said that but i'm i'm i'm pretty sure i said dr pepper's the right choice but it just shows how revelation strikes and stimulation and i could say dr pepper's the right choice and he's like amen uh-huh baby you know so and it's just how it's just how it works um but we've uh we've always um had a you've had a special place in our heart we appreciate the opportunity to be here together with you and so if i hit myself a little bit between services to get ready it's because boy you can just feel the uh the pressure and the burden of the word comes upon your heart so we just wanted to steal away and be sure that we are ready for this afternoon service may god bless you hope to shake your hands if we don't get the opportunity we love you very much if anything other than the word comes across i want you to know that we love you and that you can sense that um in in our service to you revelations chapter 10 verses 8 to 11 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings amen you may be seated i'm just going to continue on the subject of bittersweet and it i will admit that to me it's a little unique how the lord's impressed some of these details on my heart but we just we know that if we're faithful to deliver what he burdens us with and there's a blessing for you in it and for myself likewise but verse 11 says thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings we looked at how the bride is the voice of god or she is his voice his body performing his works on earth bill abraham said she is him so this is the ministry of jesus christ on earth in physical form and what we were looking at this morning is how there's a conditioned precedent a condition that must be fulfilled an event or a state of affairs that must occur before she can fully manifest him so she's not just anointed to be him and just overnight she changes into this uh this uh image of christ and this great manifestation and the mystery of christ and the ministry of christ but rather the word of god brings her through a process there has to be something happening beforehand we called it a conditioned precedent before this before this ability to fully manifest christ occurs and we see this in verses 9 and 10 as the angel said take the book and eat it up and tells them when you eat it it's going to make your belly bitter but it'll be sweet in your mouth and so john describes it how he experiences it first he says i took the book and i ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and we know that we must take all the book and eat it just not part of it we want to take all the book and eat it and it must be sweet in our mouth if it's not sweet in your mouth you won't want any more of it you won't come back to that well you won't partake of it and so i believe to the believer the word is sweet in their mouth i believe it's something that doesn't grow old and you just think there's people in this congregation right now who've been listening to the same sermons you've been listening to for 40 or 50 years been listening to it there's some who are still today listening to the tapes and they were in the meetings why because it's sweet to them it doesn't get old it's a voice that thrills them it's a message that excites them and they just listen to it over and over again it's must be sweet in our mouth but it also must become bitter in our bellies and brother branham showed us how that that bitterness in john's belly was when you digest it and when you digest it that's when you fully begin to understand it you fully begin to comprehend it becomes a part of your person and there's a consequence for digesting this book there's a there's a bitterness that comes when that word strikes deep in your belly and some read the scripture and they say well there's blessings in the book and there's cursings in the book and john was it was sweet to see all the power and glory that would be in the church but it was sad to see all the persecutions and that that type certainly exists but us as individuals we take this book so there's something sweet to us and there's a bitterness that also comes when you digest this book and so the the condition proceeding it's not just a sweet taste in the mouth but it's a bitterness in the belly and we mentioned just briefly how that bitterness means a harshness or a piercing and the belly speaks of a womb or even a stomach so there's a piercing and a harshness that comes with the sweetness and this is and i know it's review and some of you are saying man this we just heard this this morning but i'm saying this just by chance maybe someone showed up this afternoon and wasn't here this morning i know brother daniel ratliff said he was coming a pastor there near ann arbor in brighton and he desired just to be in fellowship with you tonight and said he was on his way down so i'm not sure if he's here yet he told me to take my time so that if he's a little late i still have still have more to go and i just try to please everybody so i i just feel pulled but none of you who wanted me to be short said anything so don't say it now don't say it now but the part that's really uh impressed upon me is how the bitter belly represents the consequence for eating the word and that it's uh it's the i don't want to say say the negative side but it's the hard part the difficult side the difficult things that come with the word there's a lot of glory a lot of praise a lot of wonderful things but what comes with it is that bitter part and so we must we must eat it till it hurts not just sympathize with the message not just believe it not just kind of be a you know a believer a closet believer we don't want anybody to know but we must believe it live it manifest it till it hurts and the bitter part has a purpose to it it's not just merely to make you hurt and make you feel pain and to make you suffer but suffering brings forth perfect character and that god has a purpose and a reason for things otherwise he would be the author of frustration and not of peace so he has a he desires that there would be a perfect work that would be undertaken in your life and so the bitter parts to produce the humility it's there to produce a meekness not a roughness not an exterior of someone who's been hurt a lot and people who would draw themselves and they go into a shell but it's a to produce a humility and a meekness so that the power of god can work freely in the proper vessel the word bittersweet it means pleasure accompanied by suffering and so there's a there's a pleasure that we experience with the word of god but there's also a suffering that we experience in so eating the book produces power and glory and we can say amen to them it produces power and glory but it also produces humility and suffering so that that power and glory could be the right expression of christ and and i want to read a statement now and kind of just picking up where i left off this morning and if i could say this the power and glory of christ can only be achieved through the humility and suffering of christ he was who he was because of what he obeyed and what he did and what he went through and so there's a similar path he laid for us an example that we should follow in his steps is what the scripture says and the in the message desperations and it just even the subject matter for you message believers you know he preached desperation the night after he preached the token so he's continuing on the thought of the token the type of the exodus and and a translation of a bride as he uses the the first token as an example and then when he preaches desperation he adds this element and layer to it that there's got to be some some desperation in your heart there's got to be some sense of urgency and you have to really be serious about what we're doing because you can't just eat it they said they had to eat in haste they had to have the shoes on they they ate it like we're going on a journey they just weren't kicking back wearing whatever they wanted to wear cook it however you want to cook it have the house wherever you want to have it no those elements of the first exodus were written for our example that how we dress matters what we eat matters and all these different things it all matters i mean how it was cooked mattered you couldn't just take the lamb i want it medium rare make sure you cook it with this make sure you cook oh make a good mutton curry mama that'll be really really good no you had to do it a particular way otherwise it was no benefit to you and so he adds this this layer test there's got to be a desperation and what usually causes desperation is crisis what usually causes desperation when there's a real need it's life or death and you're not sure what you can do and i'm sure some of you have experienced it before when your life or death situation the sister wrote that testimony when that car just decided not to not to turn and it backslid and what did she she called on the lord there's desperation in that and you it's usually when you get right down to something in it and you're going through it it's some difficulty it's life or death or great loss you get desperate well brother branham brings this idea into view when he preaches desperation am i just listen to how rich these things are and now the entire holy spirit visits the church making god in human flesh i like that he says as he did before sodom so now we see luke 17 30 coming to view the burning there which was a type then abraham he appeared to him and all the things that he hasn't done down through the church ages in the through the ages in the church ages he is now doing so now he's doing something different what he's done through the church ages was one thing now he's doing something different because now the entire holy spirit visits the church making god in human flesh fulfilling luke 17 30. he says back to the word because the messages and the messages and the messages has to wind up in the entire word so the entire holy spirit the entire word is he's come to produce the entirety of the life god bless you with daniel he made it i was just kind of vamping here for a little while until you made it all right we can start now everybody ready praise the lord he says so he is now doing back to the word it has to wind up in the entire word and in the last days the seven seals being opened was to pick up every straggle that's been left off in it and make the whole thing in one great big body of the bride wow that we did it for you right now sister brenda lewis wrote that song he did it for me he did this for you that's why he did it he didn't do it just for him he didn't do that for the prophet so it could come together in a great big body of the bride that them who live back there were not perfect until this church be perfected this bride group in the last days to bring them in and all together be taken up so this is this is the this is the view that we're looking at this is wonderful he says the token jesus christ the holy spirit is amongst us he says we should reverence that we can't humble ourselves enough taking off your shoes or getting on your knees wouldn't expel it it wouldn't satisfy wouldn't suffice us but a life that brings forth the fruit of the spirit that's what will sacrifice that's what will satisfy in light of what he's done the entire holy spirit visiting the church making god in human flesh what he's doing now he hasn't done in the church ages it's back to the word to wind up in the entire world opening the seven seals to make the whole thing one great big body of the bride and he says we must reverence that this doesn't produce an arrogance he says we should humble ourselves we couldn't humble ourselves enough taking off your shoes get it on your knees nothing would satisfy you saying or suffice but a life that would bring forth that word a life that brings forth the fruit of the spirit and then he says in a few paragraphs later he says i truly believe that we're on the verge of one of those mightiest things that has ever struck the earth since the days of the lord jesus but now we can only be known as and he says it'll be so humble when man calls mighty god calls abomination but what man calls foolish god calls mighty he says so now watch and see it it'll be so humble that you'll miss it if you not got the token there to examine it you've got to have the token to examine it otherwise you'll be looking for something in the flesh some fantastic some pie in the sky something big and great something that sensitizes the flesh some denominational idea of how god has to fulfill his word how the church is going to look how it's going to act how it's going to operate but he says we have to humble ourselves and he says he couldn't do it enough and he says that the natural act of taking off your shoes or getting on your knees won't do it it's got to be your life that does it that's how you're going to reverence it you're going to reverence for you with your life he says because there's something great striking the earth and it's going to be so humble it's going to be foolishness to the world but mighty to god the world's going to call it an abomination the world will call it blasphemous but to the bride it's great because it's the humility of christ being expressed in simplicity and if you think about the first token and in the exodus god's going to bring the uh the children of israel with his mighty hand and what he asked him to do the night that the death angel passes through the land was not anything pretty and and to imagine how it was to look that token that was applied in that day which was a visible token it was hideous to take the lamb and to slay it and bleed it out and then take the hyssop and then put it on your doorpost and lentil so everybody could see there's blood upon the door posted and it was such a an outlandish thing to do and i'm sure the question was as why do you need to do that can't god just spare you can he is that their grace and mercy enough why would you need to do something like like that why would you need to do something outward why does it even matter why does the outward appearance even matter well god said to do it so we'd do it and it was a hideous thing and it was a shameful thing but it was a public sign that the people in that house believed the message you could tell when you walked around the corner and go no oh there's those believers [Applause] why because it stinks to the world it's hideous to the world but to the son that was in that house he could look at that say that's power over death that child would have been in desperation as he heard the cries of those children dying down through the valley he said daddy are you sure the tokens applied says son i'm sure i obeyed the prophet's message and listen we're living in a desperate time when all hell the lid has come off hell and the world is full of insanity you need the token now more than ever [Applause] and it may seem to be a hideous thing may seem to be a shameful thing but it's the protection for you and your family [Applause] it was a humbling thing to apply the token in that day it's very different the way that it was spelled out and i believe it's the same today the visible token is to the world foolishness he said thou must prophesy revelations 10 11 i must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings as we're speaking on the subject bittersweet that sounds glorious and grand doesn't it i mean i have a ministry to kings and to prophets and peoples and nations but it doesn't look like what the flesh thinks it'll be people can even describe the ministry of brother branham and he preached to kings and he did this he traveled the world but look at the suffering he went through look at what he had to lose what he had to go through to be able to have the kind of ministry that he had this this to me is i'm just reading these things sharing these things with you knowing that we're going to be coming to the communion table just to parry in our minds and our hearts it's a huge it's through humility and he says hollywood shines just going to read these statements hollywood shines with glitter while the gospel glows with humility it's going to be it'd be easy to produce glitter but it takes the word to produce a glow he said there's quite a difference between shining and glowing the gospel glows and humility and meekness and humbleness and power while hollywood shines and everybody hurrah and hollering and going on he says god is not in class and glamour we try to put him in and we pentecostal people he says god is in humility this is where god is he's in humility not on the glitter not in the glamour not in the hurrah in hollering but in the humility in the sweetness the meekness he says humbleness and power in the masterpiece he says that's not the way god polishes his he don't polish his with education he polishes in humility in power of his manifested word showing off the shape of the grain that it went from amen i love that he says he polishes with humility in power of his manifested word showing off this of the shape of the grain that it went from that's how god polishes his bride that's how the masterpiece is polished in humility not something that's going to glitter like the world but it's going to it's going to glow like the word he says in presence of god unrecognized god ain't in these great fine fancy places and all this stuff that we see he comes in humility in the form of meekness and gentleness and pass right through and he says and if you're acquainted with the word you'll see it if you're acquainted with the word you'll see it why so many times he's trying to get them to see the presence of god unrecognized so as we would see jesus and all these different sermons he preached and he's trying to get them to see do you recognize jesus christ in our myth now he says if you're acquainted with the word you'll see it because it comes in humility in the form of meekness and gentleness and if you don't if you can't catch it it just passes right on by you so it takes humility the gospel glows with humility god is in humility he polishes in humility and the power of his manifested word he comes in humility in the form of weakness and gentleness and if you're acquainted with the word you'll recognize it but the braham said the spirit of god is always ready for correction sweet and humble and willing see if it stands up and say i'll do it anyhow he says just remember arrogant spirits are not of god arrogant spirits are not of god but a spirit that is ready for correction sweet humble and willing that's the spirit that's pleasing to the lord amen and i realize this challenges our notion that um the full word has been unfolded to us and it challenges our thought process when we believe that there's no more error in the word of god there's no more the full word's been unveiled so there we don't have an excuse ignorance is no excuse now at the open of the word we believe all things the full word's been restored we have the mind of christ and we have a perfect word and it challenges our notion when it says the zeal of this age is to repent or you've got to be willing to take correction you got to be sweet and humble and willing to receive instruction and it challenges this idea we have our minds but we got the full word we've got all the word we've got all the truth and listen that may be so about the message and that may be so about the perfection of it it may be soul even about your soul if it's been sealed through the baptism of the holy ghost but there's a lot of correcting of this nature that we need by the word of god so that it can come in harmony with the word that's down inside of us the spirit of god is always ready for correction he says if it stands up and says i'll do it anyhow he's saying that's not of god something that's going to try to push past the word of god the word of god says don't do it and then we justify ourselves and say that we can do it in light of the clear scripture or word that says we shouldn't he says that's not of god well i know brother branham said but or i know the word says this but you got to be careful with that quote it doesn't mean what you think it means well he said that because he was preaching to a bunch of pentecostals and needed to tone them down he said that because he was afraid to defend the baptist over here you know what i don't know why he said it to them but i know why he said it to me and that's so that i would line up with the word of god because the bride's revival is when she lines up with the word the bride's revival has nothing to do with the song service has nothing to do with dancing or emotion or even the manifestations of the spirit the bride's revival is when she begins to line up with the word of god and that tells me every single one of us can have a revival when we humble ourselves to the word of god and desire to walk in it that's the bride's revival so he says this arrogant spirit that will say i'll do it anyhow it reminds me of king uzziah in the second chronicles chapter 26 you read the first 15 verses it begins to describe the life of uziah he was a good king who did that which was right in the lord's sight so he starts out good says he sought the lord and the god made him to prosper we see how god helped him in battle he served the people he built uh towers to protect the the herds out in the desert he dug wells he planted vineyards there's a lot of great things that he did he had a great army he was a brilliant leader and the bible says his name was known far and wide and then it says in verse 16 but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction you see now why god knowing that we're human beings knowing that we are born of a woman knows just how to temper us just how to raise us up just how to instruct us so that all men and women born of a woman could defeat death it's got to be through the channel of bitterness it's got to be through suffering it's got to be through humility because it says here when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction so what does god do he always keeps us in opposition he always keeps things coming against us he always keeps us in a test or a trial why because our hearts cannot be get lifted up to our destruction because this bride cannot fail when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction for he transgressed against the lord his god and went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense he intruded upon an office that he wasn't called to and what caused him to do that he got lifted up and his successes where he was he was successful as a king and he got to a place where he thought god is blessing me so much in what i'm doing that i can do whatever i want and presumed and thought that he could go forward and do had so much vindication so much good so much power the people the will of the people behind him he entered into an office that displeased the lord that he had no right to enter into and as you read this scripture you find that he's in their burning incense and these valiant men these valiant priests rebuked him and the priest who he was intruding on their office they stood up in defense of the word and said god oh king you can't do that and the bible says he was wroth instead of saying oh what am i doing i'm so sorry i'm putting down the the incense or the scepter putting those things down the bible says he was wroth and he continued to burn the incense he had this attitude towards them who are you to tell me what to do i'm the king who are you to tell me what i can do look at the vindication look at all the things i've done look how many years i've been doing this look how much god has blessed me look at all these great things i'm doing and he was indignant towards them and because he continued to burn the incense he was struck with leprosy what he liked was the humility to apologize and say he was wrong when this valiant man said hey what do you think you're doing instead of him saying i don't know what got into me i have no idea what i was thinking he pushed past the rebuke he pushed past the correction of the word of god and continued to do it and he was struck with leprosy brother man said now that's exactly what uzziah done a good man you say well that person was he says i was a good person too fine person a god blessed man but no matter what it was he must always stay in his place because god give him an opportunity to influence others by being a righteous king not a priest so take that example go in the place that god put you is the place that you can rightly influence others when you get into another position that's when you're a negative influence on others it's only in the place that god put you can you be a good influence he says in the word forbid him to do that so he went in and was going to offer and when he was called down the word was given to him that he wasn't supposed to do that thing and that god had blessed him in his business and whatever it was but not to try to take the priest's place he was out of the word well he was going to do it anyhow no matter what anyone said now isn't that the attitude of too many people today they won't take correction of the word what is it we must humble ourselves to the word of god brother man said when cain wouldn't humble himself to the word of god that showed the serpent scene so the very thing that the bride possesses that nobody else possesses is the ability to completely and totally humble herself to the word of god some can do it so far but not all the way but the bride can become absolutely and completely dependent upon him from start to finish there's no point where the bride gets to the place where he says god i think i've got it from here but she feels in her heart lord you began this lord you need to finish it lord you started it lord you finish it i am unable lord no matter how much you've done for me no matter how much you've shown me no matter how much you've used me i'm nothing without you and what a great what a great uh a relationship then because he's saying i can't do this without you you're my body you're my voice there's a work that i had that i didn't finish in the days of my early ministry but i now work by and through the bride so i need you to finish my work and she said i need you to finish your work and it's a perfect example of how being mutually dependent we get the job done he says and uzziah ought to have taken that heed now remember we call him today a christian that god had blessed he wasn't just some ordinary man he was a man that was blessed by god but he did not want to stand correction no matter how much the word said it was so he didn't want to understand that because he felt secure enough that god would let him get by with something else and that's what's the matter with our peoples today around the world they think that god will let them get by with something contrary to this word he will never do it we must come back to correction and stand by and stand correction by the word he says and because of his arrogant way he acted he paid no attention to what this minister had to say he would do what he wanted to do my humbling ourselves to the word of god amen correcting ourselves disciplining ourselves that's the whole reason why god opens up the word to us to see him and his program so we can correct ourselves discipline ourselves and learn how to live and act in this evil age so we must correct we must be able to be corrected by the word of god humble ourselves to the word of god even when it hurts no matter how much we've been blessed no matter how successful we've been we must be able tender willing and humble as he said willing to be led by the spirit always ready for correction sweet humble willing but uzziah through his arrogance he said because of his arrogance he didn't pay attention to the word of god didn't pay attention to what the message was saying through his arrogance he thought he was so blessed he thought he could get away with everything he felt secure enough that god would let him get by with something else wow what a what a caution to us to not get be lifted up in this great ministry that god has given us the bride's ministry the ministry of the son of man and because we've been given a ministry it's appropriate to consider what brother branham said were the three dangers to a minister you all familiar with this and um i'm still pretty young in ministry and i had a minister's convention here our minister's meeting here recently and i was asked to speak at it i haven't spoken at very many ministers conventions or meetings uh maybe one or two and this one i was asked to speak to about 30 or so ministers i was probably the youngest one in the room and i was like i want to speak on the three things that a minister must watch many women in popularity they're all like we're supposed to debate the seventh seal not talk about these things they said there's three things that a minister must watch that hurts ministers hinders a minister brings the minister back to the rut wrecks a minister's life from the start those are all different ways he described these things he must watch them it hurts ministers hinders the minister brings the minister back to the right wrecks a minister's life from the start he said it was money women and popularity and if you pay attention to those three different instances money women in popularity it's not always the first thing we think of well it's going to hinder a minister if he's rich or it's going to hinder a minister if he has an affair with the woman it's going to hinder her minister if he's the most popular minister there's other ways that the money women in popularity can manifest itself a pastor cannot handle the tithes correctly use it to manipulate or control or to buy influence and that's the way that money becomes a problem too he may not be very disciplined in the way that he manages his money and therefore he constantly finds himself in debt and it's not because he has a lot of money that he hinders them it's because he doesn't know how to handle money that hinders them so there's a lot of different ways these things could be applied also with the woman it doesn't necessarily mean that the minister lust after a woman or has taken an adultery though that part applies but the woman is also a church and when a man lusts after a church or even as abusive towards a church there's a lot of ways where a minister's relationship to the woman which is the church is thing something that hinders him or brings him back to a rut erects his life from the start then the other one was popularity and i mentioned this because if the bride's going to have a ministry she's got to watch many women in popularity how do you mean how does the bride need to watch women she doesn't need to pattern herself after the other women should have to try to be like the other churches she don't have to chase after those other things and brother branham equates popularity with pride and uses saul as the example we find with money women in popularity they correspond with the the lust of the flesh the less of the eyes and the pride of life and the three temptations of eve in the beginning the temptations of christ in the wilderness and brother branham says that the bride will have to stand and face the same thing under temptation of the enemy so we'll be faced with the temptation the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life money women in popularity those three things that are in the world and brother branham uses these statements when he begins to think he is something when he's talking about this pride of life or this popularity and if you think you're better than somebody else then you must work to prove it you thought about that if you think you're better than somebody else then you're gonna have to work to prove it so if you think you're a better cook than sister so-and-so and she bakes a pie at that church potluck and you think you're better than her then you're out of work to try to cook a better one the next time because you got to prove it to yourself you got to prove it to others so when you think you're better than somebody else you're always trying to work your way to be better and prove yourself to be better and that's not a work you need to undertake this might start to be getting a little prac a little practical about being bittersweet but i want you to ponder that and think about that if you think you're better than somebody else then you got to prove it to yourself and prove it to others and many times being unable to prove that we're better we just try to make the other person worse [Applause] brother braham says in the message second miracle he said there's three things that i've watched in my life in reading other ministers when god blesses the minister just a little bit on the he says now we're all friends aren't we he says i guess he knew he was about to step on some toes you're my friend right we're all friends here i hope you don't have to line me up over here to the side and make everybody make right with me their thoughts they had about my wife's preaching before they take communion i resented you brother aaron when you said that he says when he blesses him just a little bit above maybe someone else or give him an opportunity to do a little more work for him or something the first thing that satan goes to work in with that administers three things three major things the first thing is money women popularity he'll work on him with money or if he can get him like his first bait like that's like in the garden of eden he says well or if he can get him thinking he's something when he ain't nothing he's got him right then that's the popularity when he gets him thinking that he's something when he's ain't nothing he's got him right then you have to guard against and if i could put this maybe in terms that makes sense and in the bride's ministry and fulfilling revelations 10 11 we can't think ourselves to be more than what god has made us we don't want to go presuming we don't want to go forth in the flesh and we don't want to have this arrogant idea well i'm going to be creating squirrels and i can rebuke the devil no i want to stay right behind his word i want to stay humble under his protection i need his protection i need his grace i'm no only in christ am i more than a match to the devil only in christ can i handle the things that are coming my way only in christ can i do the things that i desire to do that are right and correct i'm never able on my own the mark of a mature christian is total dependence upon christ a christian is reaches a full and supreme maturity when he realizes that in nothing he can do he can't do anything without christ that he's nothing on his own it's the exact opposite in the world we recognize that a person's mature when they can sustain themselves on their own they can live on their own they could they're sovereign they can to pay their own bills they can pay their own rent they can live on their own we think that's a man who's arrived when he can live on his own and support his own family but we've arrived when we've shed all our ability and stand before christ and say lord take me and use me for your glory brother said we must master the thought of human ability brother man says being popular popularity usually leads to sin and disgrace we shouldn't try to strive to be the most popular church the most influential church the most visible church he says popularity usually leads to sin and disgrace and the message show us the father he says there are three things that i noticed in the bible that always it's either cutting the tape it says and maybe it says hinders or hurts a minister he says one of them was money the other one was popularity and women so i know that saul fell because of popularity and he brings us to the mind of of saul so i know these three things balaam because of money samson because of women so then i know these three things was a hindrance that we must always keep covered up and money of course would be the greatest he says or trying to think you're just a little better than somebody else this is a this is a it's a paradox it's bittersweet how can we be pure gold how can we have the very life of christ on the inside of us how can we be all these things that brother braham says about the church the church of christ the bride is like and under pure gold her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest in fact and her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god but the expression is completely humble completely broken completely sweet so in so how it has to be dressed this great power this great glory this great deity is is once again behind badger skins as it were once we get behind something stinky and filthy something meek and lowly something humble we cannot think that we're better than somebody else and the example of saul is quite striking he was he was the people's choice to be king and they chose him because he was taller than everybody else he was tall he was handsome he's very charismatic and he was one that looked like a king and he seemed to start out right when they went to find him he was hiding he was reluctant but the scripture says something that gives you a clue that something's not right with saul because it says when he was anointed be king god gave him another heart that meant the heart he had wasn't the right one to rule so god had to give him another one but when it came to god's choice god didn't say he gave david another heart he said david already had a heart like his and so david had the kind of heart that god could mold that god could correct that god could use to fulfill his word but with saul he had to give him another heart just to be a good kind of king but when saul would not take correction that anointing left and he was given over to his worst behavior in his worst instincts and an evil spirit came upon him and you look at the mistakes of saul saul made a mistake by being impatient and he was and the prophet told him i'll be there in a few days and after these several days i'll be there and offer worship that time passed and the saul got anxious and wanted to offer sacrifice for his men before they went to battle and if you just described it you would think that saul was doing an honorable thing to protect his men and give glory to god i offered sacrifice before battle to give lord you the first place to offer protection upon my men and to glorify you but he intruded on an office that wasn't his and it's because he was impatient because he did that that little mistake samuel shows up and says because you've done this this kingdom will be taken away from you and you think my goodness oh that's all it took but saul would never humble himself as a matter of fact when saul once again was found disobeying the lord and he was told to destroy all the amalekites and he went and he he was to destroy them all and then samuel shows up and he says and saul says oh i've obeyed the lord samuel he even saved tells him presuming i've done exactly what you've asked sam says what's this bleeding of rams why do i hear all these things he goes oh oh we've saved those to offer to the lord and then when he gets called out he's all the people made me do it and what is he doing i may be getting my different instances mixed up in verse chapter 13 or 15 but then he grabs the prophet in his anger and he rents his clothes he says because just as you have rent this vesture from me so will the kingdom be rent from you and given to another that is better than you it's one thing for god to say it but you'll never find david saying it david never told saul he was better but he but the word said he was david never gloated over saul david never bullied saul david never went out of his way to try to provoke saul all he had to do was be himself and minister and that would be enough to provoke saul and listen i'm getting just venturing off into other territory here but i just believe it would be a blessing a necessary for one of us even if it's from my own reminder for myself but if you look at the mistakes of saul and compare him to the mistakes of david saul would still be your choice offered sacrifice for his men before battle without the prophet kept the best of the flocks and the pure the pure beast of the flock to offer sacrifice to god those were saul's mistakes that took the kingdom away from them but saul was an adulterer and then a murderer and yet god kept the kingdom with him one's an adulterer and a murderer the other one just worships out of season the other one just tries to do god's will but just doesn't doesn't wait properly and and he's trying he's doing his best wanting to give god first you first you can't take what david did and try to whitewash it and spin it where it's something righteous and something gloriful glorious it's something awful but yet david was a man after god's heart saul was it and you'll find the difference is when paul saul was rebuked he could never humble himself when david was told david you're that man he fell and broken man said lord i'm sorry please forgive me i've sinned against my god and he accepted the consequences for his action the difference was the ability to humble himself and repent and make things right listen we believe we are the sinless pure spotless virgin pride of the lord jesus christ but we still make mistakes and the difference between you and the rest will be you will be willing to say lord i'm sorry please forgive me lord i made a mistake and i'm sorry lord let that blood cover me not sit back and say well i did it because of this i did it because of that and blame everybody else but say lord let it rest upon me i'm sorry [Applause] god allowing david to do something that just so boggles our minds to think it would be a child of that union that would be that would be the one that would take the throne solomon but yet before solomon could take the throne david owns up to his mistakes and david there in his brokenness before god and before the prophet says i am that man and the bible tells david don't fear the prophet nathan said don't worry about you don't worry about your throne but the child will die well who died the innocent the one that didn't sin but god took the sins and passed them over david upon the innocent son of david portraying christ and because he took our sins and they bypassed us and they've been placed upon his son jesus christ we have a right to ascend to the throne the saul was made more obstinate the correction didn't produce humility with him it just encouraged his arrogance and so this as we're saying speaking on bittersweet i just hope it makes sense to you i trust that god the holy spirit's piece it together i m by nature i i i can study for years before i preach a sermon just trying to wait on the lord wait on the lord and i want to know just just how the message teaches it and these things and and i just this message is just burning on my heart and god gave me this channel to express it and it may seem to be scattered and all over the place that i just trust god's putting it together in your heart bitterness is a suffering it's to produce a character to shape our hearts to be like christ amen james 1 2 4 my brother counted all joy when you fall into diverse temptations that didn't mean doesn't mean fall into sin but when you suffer tribulation not for not for your own evil sake but for god's sake for god's will for the word's sake it says knowing that this that the trend of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if you can have patience it's virtue he says let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing but what's going to produce uh patience the trying of your faith you have faith you have a great faith you have a faith of god's elect of faith that has been given in the end time to triumph over death but that faith faith has to be tested this is the bitterness we experience the trying of our faith falling into diverse temptations but as brother chad even pointed it out and this is where i was wanting to come to in the remainder of the time that we have together this afternoon is we cannot let the things we experience make us hardened or bitter bitterness cannot produce more bitterness our bitter experience our bitter suffering should not produce a bitter attitude a bitter demeanor and an attitude towards others and certainly not an attitude towards god [Music] but a softness a sweetness to us a humility now i'm just going to go further in this i want this to be maybe more instructive than something that might seem to be uh revelatory or exciting or even evangelistic but just instructive he says i think one of the horriblest things is to see a man or woman that's constantly complaining you can always complain about the bitter part and that wouldn't be pleasing to the lord i've always thought god keep me from it see that weakens faith all the time you know if we're to have faith to triumph over death if we're even wanting faith for our own divine healing you cannot achieve it by complaining if we're always complaining for expressing bitterness and not processing the bitterness in our bellies then it weakens our faith he says i know and this he just he enters into our suffering i know as they get older each one of us we're going to get something happen and something happened and i know these little things are going to keep accumulating as you get older they just got to and that's what happens to us the longer we serve the more things we go through we think oh finally we're through a trial what happens we're in another one oh finally we're going to go forward finally that hurts been healed finally i'm moving past that well there's another one and there's another one and there's another one where are we going to catch our breath you might think even as an assembly maybe even as a minister brother chad as a pastor when am i going to catch my breath when am i going to be able to rejoice in what god is doing when i might be able to have my hands lifted up with no sorrow no suffering no persecution it may seem like you can never catch your breath brother is identifying these things will just keep accumulating he said they just got to but i think one of the most horrible things is for satan to crown some person's life a crabbed old man or old woman wouldn't it be the worst crown for bcf it's just a he says a crabbed old man or old woman could you imagine if you had to change the sea to crabbed vcf just so hardened just so bitter bitter crab fellowship i might want to stop using those initials do you go to bcf no i go to believers christian fellows he says i hope that i don't get to that place i hope that i can bear it to my burdens and get to that spot where i want my life crowned with the glory of god his long-suffering gentleness peace meekness and filled with the holy spirit not exactly what he said we don't the only thing that would suffice in this hour of desperation we can't humble ourselves enough it wouldn't satisfy it would suffice but a life that brings forth the fruit of the spirit i know the devil can impersonate all these but the bride is the one that can perfect all these and you know we complain because hurt's been afflicted on us and we can begin to complain brother bram says oh someone is constantly complaining it weakens their faith we begin to complain because we've been hurt and then we criticize because we desire justice someone hurts us and we complain but then we criticize because we desire justice and then when we don't get it we get bitter and it's the bitterness that'll rob you of every single victory in your life he says that indifference and prejudice and everything exists among the people get that out of your soul right now the canker will canker you it rots you it rots into the life away it takes life out of you james says grudge not one against another brethren lest you be condemned behold the judge standeth at the door behold the judge has standeth at the door the the word has been opened to us grudge not against one another lest ye be be condemned graduate means to complain or groan and what does complaining lead to your condemnation not theirs yours the word messes word became flesh brother brown says he says i'm by myself but not by myself there's one who brought me from my mother who's fed me who's taken me through these deep trials his grace has brought me safe thus far i'm trusting that to take me on through that he says he's honest with himself and i've come to a place where i have says i want to ask the church one more thing before we get someplace study in the scriptures that it is that you will pray for me i've developed a critical spirit and it haunts me this is his honesty he says i i'm not by myself the lord's with me he's brought me from my mother's womb he's fed me he's taken me through these deep trials it's his grace that's brought me thus far i'm trusting that'll take me further but he acknowledges that the trials have created a critical spirit i've developed a critical spirit and it haunts me could we have the humility to at least admit to it and also that it's not a benefit to us said i told my wife yesterday the first time something happened now that i was sitting in the yard and i told her she'd reminded me i told her about it said honey i've got to a place to become critical of people i don't want to be whose job is it it's not mine and god's the one to criticize not me what we suffer what we go through should never create in us this attitude where we get offended and by those offenses we were hurt and so we become uh this affliction on us we begin to complain and we desire to see god's justice and god's wrath oh god how could you let that continue how could you let them get away with it and then we get bitter when we don't see justice it's a vicious cycle amen what we're doing what i'm wanting to remind you if we acknowledge the bride's going to suffer great offenses and great hurt everyone says this little persecuted bride she's going to have before that before she shows this great power manifestation this little hunted persecuted bride she's going to be hunted she's going to be persecuted then she'll display god's power and glory and go home to be with the lord what does he tell us we must do we must conduct ourselves with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass not being crabbed up as he says and the bride's crown is a crabby spirit he says no let my life be crowned with the glory of god not a critic not a complainer says i've developed a critical spirit and and i'm just saying this to be instructive too i'm just saying this from my heart and i believe it's very practical critic usually sees in others what he's unwilling to see in himself you've heard the phrase the pot calling the kettle black you heard that phrase before the pot's black the kettle is polished so when the pot calls the kettle black what does he see his own reflection that's that's what that phrase originally meant and the origin of it a pot calling the kettle black he's he's beholding his own blackness in the kettle and he's criticizing the kettle but what he sees is himself jesus says in matthew chapter 7 verses 1 to 5 judge not that you be not judged for with that what judgment you judge ye shall be judged and with that what measure you meet it will be measured to you again and why behold this thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye the sliver just the little sliver you're going come here come here real close real close let me just look look yeah see it you see it yeah you've got a sliver in your eye he says but consider not the beam that is in thionai and he's saying whoa watch it as you get close there or how will it i'll say to that brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye he says thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out this mote out of thy brother's eye let's start with us say lord start with me if i'm ever going to be an effective husband effective teacher to my children then lord teach me first lord i need to learn to follow you if my wife's going to be able to follow me lord i have to be under subjection to you first if i can ever expect my wife to be under subjection to me lord let it begin with me lord remove the being from my eye maybe i'm beholding the molt in others merely because of the beam in mine but when the beam can be moved from mine then i can see clearly to help my brother when we're just fault finders and critics and always complaining we view ourselves better than everyone else and when we do that we lose focus on the work that god's doing in our own lives to clean up our lives as brother chad said this afternoon when he closed the service too much self get self out of the way as i said before if you think you're better than somebody else then you'll try to work to prove it i'll say also if you think you're better than somebody else it's easy to criticize them and your criticism is your effort to prove it but do you realize when you criticize something you make yourself subject to the thing you criticize you've given the very thing you've criticized power over you and you come under its influence no wonder brother brown says it weakens our faith because when we complain we come under the power of it brother brahman says in the message flashing red light of the signs of his company says i'm getting old i know that each day i get a new ache and pain i accidentally covered up the clock that's why i'm not paying attention here so now i know what time it is maybe i'll just cover it back up that was feeling that was that was feeling good there not knowing what time it was i'm getting old i know that each day i get a new ache in pain every one of us do you might as well tell the truth i thought god don't let me one of the most miserable things is to see a man or a woman who's never accepted christ and just lived an old moss back church member meaner than satan himself and see him out there with a crabbed old something well i tell you he says that's the horriblest crown that satan could crown a life with a grouchy old woman about 60 or 70 years old with fat hanging down her underarms and the wrinkles all over her face and her hair bobbed up in four or five different colors and strutting herself down a little pair of shorts if that ain't the crowning of satan i've never seen him or some old crabbed man he says oh god give me grace to never complain so i'm glad he brought it down to that because i don't think we'll have if i even have hair it won't be four or five different colors he says i want my life lord i want my people's life god grant that our life could be crowned no matter if we suffer whatever takes place how many turns against me i know this one thing in my life as i get older my friends the streams behind me will soon be running out narrower and narrower as i go down the road why because notice that's exactly what happened in his ministry the more narrow it got more the more you got to that point in the climax of that capstone the fewer people could follow him in it he says i know one thing it'll come past after a while that there'll be nobody come to me and say and ask me advice the one who knows me in my younger days will be going on if i shall live my friends will get fewer and fewer as i get older now he saw he saw he could see it but yet he persevered for our sake he knew he would go into a place where he'd be used because of his gift for an offering but he did it to put a message on tape [Applause] not ashamed of this messenger he says my friends will get fewer and fewer as i get older now and i know that someday i've got to die i hope that god never let satan crown me as an old crabbed and different man in my wife an old nagging woman or your wife or you that way even if we're to walk the same road the prophet walked suffer the same rejection fewer friends narrow and narrow even if we're to go the same way christ went lord don't crown my life as an old crabbed and different man don't crown my wife as an old nagging woman or your wife for you that way i pray brother that our lives will be crowned with the fruits of the spirit love joy longsuffering gentleness peace patience truth faith in the holy spirit that's the crowning of the bride's ministry through her pain through her sorrow through her difficulty there's a crown to be won through your bitterness hebrews 12 15 looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of godless any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled we must look diligently lest we of this grace he says lest any root of goodness spring up and what happens to root of business it troubles you and defiles many it's not just a root of businesses it's not without consequence so the only thing the matter is get all these little differences away from you little isms and little funny feelings around you for the brethren things like that shake it away don't let no root or business ever get into your soul if you do it'll canker you keep love i don't care how much people hate you you love them anyhow [Applause] he says in the message why they already can prove that man that hold grudges and women who fuss and stew and fight and argue they'll die it'll cause cancer fungus and everything else said in ulcers and they have scientifically proven that harboring anger and a lack of forgiveness creates a chronic state of anxiety and the tenseness and the and the way the nerves are stretched it becomes toxic to physical health is he says they can already prove that i found a number of studies at least maybe a eight or so where studies show that people who forgive are happier and healthier than those those who hold resentments study after study from university after university after brethren said they can already prove it that holding grudges these things the lack of forgiveness will actually cause your body to weaken and die they've proven it through scientific study studies have shown that the habit of fault-finding and constant criticize criticism is a precursor to stress and that stress wreaks havoc upon the body what fault finding negativity why brother brahman said a critical spirit just weakens faith you're not only weak in faith but it harms your physical body it says a root of business will trouble you and defile many our attitude is so important he says your attitude towards christ will make a great impression on what your children will be your life that you live before your family will make an impression on what your children will be our attitude yes we have the truth yes we believe precious things that are ridiculed and mocked and sometimes even by people that are close to us but we never have the license to have the wrong attitude we never have a right to be cocky or arrogant we never have a right to be mean or harsh there's a phrase that says bride won't persecute bride brother i said bride won't persecute bride i believe that do you believe that i also believe that bride doesn't persecute anybody [Music] so i don't i don't have a a persecuting a pitchfork in my hand i said well brother are you bride okay then i won't use it on you she doesn't have persecution in her bag she doesn't persecute anybody so you want to know bride bride's the one not persecuting because not only does bride not persecute bride bride doesn't persecute our attitude towards christ the attitude with which we carry this word i meant to bring the statement to to the pulpit i just forgot but there's a there's a statement that's been shown through a number of different studies how that children millennials and children these days and teenagers and young adults are leaving christianity because of the the way that their parents lived and expressed what they believed they're not leaving because of what they have a disagreement with christ or the bible they're leaving leaving because they have a disagreement with those people who believe the christ of the bible the life that was lived has not been the proper expression of the grace and humility of christ i just have a few more statements to read here several more statements and i'll we'll turn we'll approach the communion table but i hope that there's something building in your hearts to have a real sweet time in the presence of god when we take communion tonight the message how can i overcome he says lord jesus you see those hands as he's asked maybe for a response here at the end of this message how can i overcome how did jesus overcome by the word and humility as your servant stand between the living and the dead i condemn everything that's bothering these people and myself and i ask in the name of jesus christ we can leave it laying here on the altar of god and walk away this morning free as overcomers if our sisters haven't had the grace before may it be granted now lord if our brothers haven't had the grace may be granted now could we all just say lord for me i haven't had the grace before today lord even though i've known i've known these things these things have been preached but lord if i haven't had the grace before may i have it now he says in may in humility mother with her children instead of being arrogant she knows she's a preacher to them little children her life is an example mama don't be harsh don't be arrogant mother don't be a bully to your own children dad is an example to mother for he's the head of the house the mother has been trying to boss him around she'll never do it no more if he's been using her for a doormat it'll never be done no more she's a helpmate he says granite lord may all these things that hinder us lord be taken away we are consecrating ourselves father for what time of life we have ahead of us knowing this that we got to come to the end of it the right and that right away so this morning we take this opportunity after this message we take the opportunity lord to come because we're bidden to come cast your cares upon him for he careth for you i know you care lord you cared enough to die for us and we surely can care enough to come and accept what you died for sanctify us lord fill us anew with the holy spirit may the holy ghost just reign in our hearts supremely that we'll walk forgetting the things that are in the past the muck and the mire that we once lived in will press towards the mark of the high calling where our light can shine in sweetness and humility till every passerby can say there's a christian that lives on that hill that person that man that woman is a real consecrated flower of god they're so sweet and kind always loving and sweet and understanding granite father let us be salty that the earth might thirst granite father and overcome the things of this world and the cares of this life you realize the precision with which he zeroes in on how can i overcome he's not merely saying i need to put away drinking and put away cigarettes and put away the television and lord help me put away the shorts and put away the pants and cut my hair as a man and not cut my hair as a woman but he says let me be a godly woman a mother to my children let me be a wife to my husband let a husband love his wife correctly let the wife respect her husband correctly oh god let's sanctify us fill us anew with the holy spirit consecrating ourselves let us shine with sweetness and humility and let us overcome the things of this world and the cares of this life this is the day of small things it could be said the bible says don't despise the day of small things the brother would come and preach to this afternoon about overcoming cigarettes there wouldn't be one of us that would need to come to the altar perhaps and preaching about overcoming certain things of the world whether it be some fashions or some perversions there might be a lot of us that feel that we're free and sanctified in those things but we can't be lifted up in that sanctification and be living free from those things but living as a brute in our homes and cheating our wives as a doormat or a woman who can claim to go to church or pair ties and understand the mysteries but yet we'll boss her husband around it's time for the full word to take effect arrogant spirits are not of god and the way he's describing is a humility within the family where the wife sees that she reverenced her husband but the husband loves his wife now i just i i want to bring it now to my my closing statement i'm done calling witnesses i'm just going to go to my closing statement brother brahm says in the message greater than solomon is here he says if you want to manifest christ jesus christ in your life he says come on if you want to manifest jesus christ in your life come on don't play church no more the hour is here we mustn't trifle with this great thing that god has given us no more play in church this isn't about perfecting church order this isn't about getting our worship services just perfect and our deacon's just perfect our trustee is just perfect and everything built just right we can have great church services if we don't leave and live the life then our church services are in vain no matter how pretty it can be in here no matter how perfect it can be in here if it's not changing the inner man and we don't come to play to church but we've got to get serious we must not trifle with this great thing god has given us we're not living to go to church we go to church to live and our church experience should be feeding our life experience [Applause] i don't want to just go to a church that entertains me on two times on sunday and once on wednesday and then i don't have any ability to learn and to achieve a a relationship with christ that allows me to live in overcoming life monday to saturday we need ministries that make the seventh seal relevant monday to saturday just not on sunday morning wow we must not trifle with this great thing god has given us let's not play church anymore the hour's here lord i consecrate myself to you [Applause] in the message paradox brother branham gives the vision of the black mamba and he says that mamba was certain death he says that everyone was scared to death and brother brother brad had a feeling for his brother he saw him like leaping away everyone was scared they're scared of death if you got bit by that it was certain death and he said we were just two-thirds of the way what was it bringing us to the third pool come in there to the jordan for this third pool and we know that in the vision that he gives the angel tells him to bind him and he binds them and and just just skipping some of the details of that he says and a voice came from above and said you've been given power to bind him the worst or any the greatest and the least you've been given power to bind him the death you've been given the power to bind death he's the greatest and since you combine him you can bind them all he says you've been given power to bind him the worst or any and i said well god what must i do now right that there immediately is instructive immediately it's corrective because if someone came and said just saith the lord you've been given power to blind the devil we would all go and run out and start binding devils where's the devil let me find him i need to bind a devil come here come here devil where are you i'm going to bind you [Applause] but brother branham knew enough to say then what must i do [Music] what must i do this that power cannot be given unless there be some consecration lord if you've been giving me power to bind the greatest delays he recognized and inability himself he knew at that very moment i'm not to leave here arrogantly i'm not the face of black mamba arrogantly what must i do he said you must be more sincere [Applause] he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere you must be more sincere i said well god forgive me for my insincerity let me have sincerity [Applause] if brother branham could say that how much more ought to we when we're told these great things in the world of god what we are and the voice of god is in us we are the glory and power of christ oh god what must we do [Applause] amen we must be more sincere because it's the sincerity of our hearts that determines the extent to which the power of god can work and if we haven't seen the power of god working in our lives like we should then we need to check our sincerity as we come to the communion table he says let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth must be more sincere speaking about a greater consecration this is the bitterness this is what happens when you eat the word you have to become more consecrated you have to be brought low you have to suffer the loss of all things he says in the message recognizing your day i just have two statements to read to you and we'll close it he says god created me a revival let me be the revival let each one of us be the revival the revival in me make me lord to hunger make me to thirst create me lord that which is needed in me let me from this hour on be thine more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humble more kind more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past and the negative let me press toward the mark of the high calling of christ would that be your prayer this afternoon there's healing and communion i believe there's great power in partaking of it maybe you could join this with your prayer if it strikes in your heart but from this hour on let me be your a more consecrated servant more blessed of you more able but then he says more humble more kind more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive forgetting the things that are in the past and the negative let me press toward the mark of the high calling of christ musicians if you please come create in me a revival let me be the revival so he says let each one of us be the revival he says make me to hunger make me the thirst i just if the musicians have a song in their heart just play as you would feel led i want to read a lengthy statement to you but i just felt so impressed by the holy spirit to share this with you we've been over over an hour now and if it's been lengthy for communion service i i i just trust that god would still take these things and use them for your benefit for his glory in the message i've heard but now i see he describes an instance where a woman washes jesus feet and the way he describes it it's appears as if it would be from luke chapter seven [Music] and he says we see a woman who believed on him she had had need and seen he had need [Music] had need for his feet to be washed she'd only she had only to be inspired to go into action he says now before we close she only had to be inspired to go into action because she had already heard about him she heard that he forgive a woman of her sins a harlot and said which one of you is without sin cast the first stone she had heard about him but now she'd seen him she was inspired to serve him that's the only thing you have to be let the holy spirit tell you that you're a sinner let the holy spirit tell you you're wrong let the holy spirit prove you by the scriptures that you're scripturally wrong because it'll only stir through one straight channel of every scripture of god it won't bypass for nothing don't be afraid to let the word tell you you're wrong if you do he says if you don't you'll never do you any good because the holy spirit can inspire it to you but if the soul isn't right with god as we've been through this week it's no good anyhow remember false anointed ones will rise in the last days not false jesus is false christ anointed ones and will deceive the very elect if it were possible and if you go and study that message you'll find in the very beginning brother bram says what i'm preaching you to today and i'm paraphrasing it is prophecy false anointed ones wasn't so much an assessment of what was going on then but a prophecy for the bride to be able to recognize the false anointed ones now she says notice she had a service to do for him she had heard of him now she had seen him with her eyes she had a service to do she had nothing to do it with that's what we have to come to realize we've got nothing to offer him nothing that we can give she wasn't she was a harlot she wasn't rich by any means she had nothing she could give but she rushed for it anyhow to do the service god furnished the water the towels to wash his feet she had heard of a living god all of her life but now she'd seen him with her eyes all cajun members of this church tonight members of the body of christ put yourself in this story she knew it was him and inspiration struck her she said this is the messenger he needed a service she had nothing to serve him by his feet were dirty but she rushed forward anyhow to do him a service because she was inspired to do it he says oh backslidden church member denominational man or woman can't you see the need jesus has tonight if inspiration can only strike you this is the hour to do it how much more can we my inspiration say oh bride of jesus christ can't you see the need that jesus has tonight [Music] if inspiration can only strike you this is the hour to do it but she's seen him with her eyes the others there were even mocking him they didn't believe his message frankly the host pastor pastor wholesale simon had got him down there to make fun of him they didn't believe he was a prophet so then when it seemed like the devil had worked it just in right for them to say this he said to himself if this man was a prophet he would know what kind of woman that was at his feet if he was a prophet see it wasn't even revealed to him who he was there couldn't be any inspiration strike him because there's nothing there to strike but it was struck to her why cause you've been smitten you've been struck her eyes seemed beyond his criticism she believed he was the word of the prophets she know that was all the words of the prophets was vindicated to him she had heard he was on earth but now she sees them bride of jesus christ we've heard but now we see he says what was she done she seen the word made flesh the messiah the emmanuel when she gave vent to her pulsation of faith of revelation of who she was in the time she was living oh let us give vent all to this bitterness in our belly to this great rumbling down within our souls through our pain for our difficulty through our strife and through our anguish let us give vent not a frustration but of inspiration not of pain but of love not of complaining and criticism but glory and praise and honor and adoration let your word live in me oh god [Music] she gave venture pulsation of faith of the revelation of who he was and the time she was living that he was god's lamb for sinners as she was she went forth to serve his needs without knowing how she would do it [Music] that's why we've got to come to a place of humility lord i bring nothing to this ministry i bring no gift no talent no ability i just bring you me she went forth to serve his needs without knowing how she would do it that's the way a genuine healing comes when it's revealed to you he was wounded for your transgressions bruised for your iniquity with the stripes you're healed when it's inspired you to see his presence here of luke 17 30 that is going to reveal himself in the last days among his people in human flesh like he did in sodom when you see that and something strikes you the doctor says the cancer's there the patient says well i i don't know if i'm going to walk i don't know how i'm going to walk we don't know how it's going to do she went forward to serve him because inspiration struck her that was the hour that was the messenger that was the messiah who was to heal and she believed it and he needed a service done to him and she went forward without anything showing that she could do it she just went upon her inspiration and watch god broke up the fountains of the tear glands in her eyes the same eyes that seen it broke up with joy the other god-given long hair god furnished her the towels and with her tears in you is what you need god has made you bride material it's in you what you need to serve him what you need for this ministry you've got it in you but let god furnish it let god bring it out of you she had it there she went forward to russia there's a need i just have inspiration oh god here i am i'll come i'll come to serve you if you're backslidden this afternoon and for some reason you made your way here and you feel like a hypocrite and you feel worthless just come by inspiration to serve him he broke up the tears in her eyes the same eyes that had seen him and that became the water she didn't have she had it within her out from your belly shall flow from that same bitter belly flow rivers of living water she had the water there in her own eyes to wash his feet but i have no towel your god-given long hair sisters that became the towel to wash his feet listen everything god has asked you to do has a purpose in his economy has a purpose to fulfill the commission that the bride has been given she served his needs the need of the living god she had heard about it but now she's seen him she could do him a service oh sinner i said oh bride why don't you do likewise as you see the needs now that he needs you your surface this is why brother chad i said oh it'd be so wonderful if we were doing feet washing to know that when i kneel before my brother to wash his feet i'm washing the feet of christ and when that brother kneels down to wash my feet christ is washing my feet listen right if you do feel insignificant that's a great start if you feel small you feel like you don't have anything listen god's gonna use what he's placed inside of you what we have to do is humble ourselves to him and go forward we've been spitting we've been struck don't go with your own attitudes don't go with your own uh understanding don't go in intellect don't go with arrogance but sweetness humility the loss of everything mastering the thought of human ability god here i am my inspiration i want to serve you here i come to luke 17 30. here i am in the presence of the son of man lord break up these tears lord let my life pour out to you a song of worship though it may seem to be a bittersweet melody it's something that's mixed with blessing and cursing oh god i'm happy to serve you let us go forward to serve him if you want to if inspiration struck you stand your face oh god i've come to serve you i've come to consecrate myself lord i won't trifle with this great thing that you've given me anymore i'm done with playing church i must be more sincere i'll take this bread tonight consecrating myself asking that you forgive me my insincerity and oh god let something be transformed in me today to be a servant of you let's bow our heads in prayer do you sense him smiting you is there anyone here that would sense the tender hand of jehovah this inspiration striking you do you want to at this moment lift yourself up to him and say god take me take me as a lump of clay take this vessel lord and use it for your glory and say lord whatever that whatever it means i remember the night that i gave my heart to god and was filled with the holy ghost i said no matter what it takes that's just maybe my own personal anecdote and it doesn't have to mean anything to you i only share it to say that i know that when god sees somebody that means business he's more willing to give you the holy ghost than you want it he's more willing to meet you right there where you're standing tonight oh he wants to see us somebody that'll turn and face him seek you with seek him with your whole heart and you'll be found of him you say i'm done playing with church anymore yes i believe the seals are open yes i believe the bright age yes i believed all these wonderful mysteries but i realized there's not something deep down the inside that allowed me to live this word and humble myself to it and tonight with no shame i'm making myself bear lord meet me in my need and it remarkable he said let the holy spirit tell you let him tell you that you're a sinner let them tell you that you're wrong [Music] are we willing to be corrected with our heads bowed if you need prayer you want to submit yourself to the lord tonight you can do it before the lord by lifting your hands however you feel that you need to meet the lord tonight don't let this moment pass you by our gracious heavenly father i must and must now yield the pulpit to you completely as we worship that you could come now behind it the word which has been preached and deal with hearts individually lord without you continue to use my voice and to use my my yielding to the gift lord now father come behind it penetrate that heart lord i believe that you could allow a minister to preach one sermon for one soul and we would rejoice in it we would greatly rejoice and father whatever the needs are that your word is meeting tonight may the individuals who have been pricked by your word the ones that are being struck and smitten tonight by your word may we yield to you now as we lift our hands in worship and praise and say god do this great work in me we believe that we're a bride that has a heart like david that can be corrected that can be molded that can be strengthened and the only thing that would make us all tonight is to refuse it so father we accept it we commit ourselves to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ and i prayed that there would be physical healing spiritual healing and salvation of souls as we lift our hands to you in worship in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen change my heart oh god [Music] change my heart oh god may i be alive sing it again change my heart oh god change my heart oh god [Music] true change my heart oh god may i be like [Music] i am mold me and make me this is [Music] make it ever true [Music] change my heart oh god [Music] yes lord jesus [Music] [Music] here because he first love me [Music] henry my salvation [Music] on [Music] unless you sing it again we love you very much we're happy to be able to take communion with you tonight and i pray that as you come to the communion table you can have the kind of humility and consecration to derive every benefit from obedience to his work and grant you tonight do you love him i believe he's here i mean there can be testimonies and miracles from your consecration and from your devotion and your humility to him tonight let us all submit to his presence now surrendering ourselves to his word can we all come into one mind and one accord to believe that what we're about to do is pleasing to him and that by partaking of this cup which represents his blood and eating this bread which represents his body we're doing something that's a divine ordinance that's pleasing to him and there's reviving in it and of one mind and one accord we believe the holy spirit can have his way him [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] praise the lord [Music] you've been pricked i've been pricked you know what it's going to take total surrender complete dependency no more self and then we're going to see god move like we've never seen him move before what was brother branham a surrendered vessel and he was smitten brother rejected persecuted and aren't you glad you got to watch him wrestle through it i feel sorry for him but on tape he wrestles through it and all the feelings and the criticism and wanting to pull away and leave the field and we watched him wrestle through it and he was honest about it and he wrestled through it because we're going to wrestle through it the wave chief it was a wave chief in more ways than just the dynamic of the spirit he was the wave chief and just showing what it was going to take to bring full maturity we should be encouraged and corrected and challenged amen i'm so glad that god had a wave chief we could watch what it's like to come to maturity what it's like for a fully mature son of god and what is how you face rejection how you wrestle with your own emotions and how you wrestle with your own feelings and how you subdue that and surrender and go back to service that's the way i want to live say god help us i just feel before we take communion we've this has been two heavy services and we've heard a lot instead of just moving into the ritual into the form and just going i think we need some time just to pray just some quiet time for just a few minutes just to just to reconsecrate ourselves and repent for those things that were exposed today and ask god to take out of us some things that we realized we had today and god to bring us into a greater surrender and that we can be used by him amen would you like to pray you can all be seated you just pray your seat you can turn around and kneel at your seat you can come and pray at the altar however you want to pray but we're just going to take a few minutes and pray if you could just play really softly brothers and let's just take some time and pray [Music] god bless your friends [Music] amen [Music] and as we move to communion let's not let the atmosphere change [Music] god knew what we would need so he offered himself a sacrifice because he knew we would mess up he knew once man fell what it would take to make things right so as we partake of the communion we take of the bread the broken body of jesus christ and take of the blood and the life that was shed given for us so that his life could come back into sanctified vessels so we take that let the power of it head us with impact though we failed he didn't fail though we've made mistakes he didn't he made a way for us as we take the bread and drink the cup let the power and gravity of what's been done for us let it affect us i don't know about you but i've got a greater desire than ever in my life to give him everything to give him all and sometimes we don't even realize what all is until somebody comes and preaches a message and shows you that there's more to giving your all we thought i've said this before i thought when i come to the message and i got rid of my tv and my shorts that i gave him all and i realized that was just a starting point amen he wants all and you know what i want him to have all and you want him to have all and because we have a desire to give him on his mercy he would send a minister to show us what more all is like so that we can say god i want to give you that too my attitudes and the bitterness i've held because of hurts and the things the attitudes that i've had lord i want to give those to you too the complaining or the wrong thinking i want to give that to you too the critic criticalness i want to give that to you too lord i want to give you all and now you're showing me there's more to my all but i want to give you that too you want a greater sincerity lord i want to be more sincere help me god you will it's going to take a greater sincerity god give me a greater sincerity because i'm giving you all i've got and it's insufficient so come down yourself and bring a greater sincerity out of me a greater consecration bring it out of me lord but i'm laying myself before you and i want to give you all is that your heart's cry you want to give him all and every time you hear a sermon like this we realize there's more to the all you want to give him that too plus anything else lord just take it all i want you to have all amen let's just take communion with that attitude that lord you gave your all for me you gave your all to redeem me you gave your all to heal me you gave your all the sanctified you gave your all to me and with all my heart i want to give my all back to you let's come to communion with that attitude let that spirit guide us let's all stand as we read through the scripture like we said this morning we don't want to come to service as a tradition but we don't want to take communion as a tradition either just the first sunday of the month we're just going to take communion but let the gravity of it impact us and our need for it amen aren't you glad there's a fountain open it's not closed off it's still flowing and let it clean us amen sing the song there is [Music] [Music] there are streams of grace that's flowing down from calvary come now receive [Music] will take you from the nation and bring you to your own land [Music] man [Music] [Music] clean water there is in the house [Music] and there are streams [Music] now will pour upon the house of my chosen one the spirit of grace and supplication and in that day that will be [Music] opened be up green there is [Music] there are streams of grace [Music] [Music] praise the lord it's been good to worship together today do you feel all cleaned out scrubbed out and clean oh what a good feeling that is to know it's all under the blood amen i pray that god will just keep us in the center of his will that if we should step to the right or to the left that he would come down and rebuke us and chasten us and keep us right in the center of his will because that's where our hearts want to be we want to be pleasing to him and as you go today go with these things in your heart and remember to be praying for brother aaron and his family lord as they as they continue to travel just be praying for them it was a blessing to have him with us we just appreciate their consecration appreciate their yielding to the gift the sacrifices that they make as a family so that brother aaron can continue to minister the word so remember to pray for them as well now let's just bow our heads ask the lord to bless us as we leave your heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for your goodness to us lord we thank you god for your instruction lord for your correction for your encouragement lord we just so appreciate you lord and our greatest desire is to be pleasing to you whatever we do let it be pleasing to you god lord as i've already said if we step to the right or to the left we just trust as you as the good shepherd as a good father lord you're watching over us that you'll correct us and bring us to the center of your will because our hearts desire is to follow your leading the greatest pleasure that we have is pleasing you lord god may it always be that way and lord let that desire grow in us lord that everything we would do would be pleasing to you oh we love you we ask that you would keep us as we go from here let the things we've heard and the experiences we had not fade away lord as we go out the doors and get in cars but lord may they remain with us lord and have an impact on us lord change our lives by these things and help us to be more like you god bless each one on the way home keep them safe lord use us for your glory let us go as bright and shining light into a dark world that we might shine the way lord to salvation that we may be able to point somebody to the path of righteousness lord use us for your glory flow through us lord and to the world in jesus christ's name we pray amen how many can say there's none like you let's just worship him now as we go sing this together is [Music] is none like you [Music] no one else can touch my heart like you i [Music] there is [Music] [Applause] who has
