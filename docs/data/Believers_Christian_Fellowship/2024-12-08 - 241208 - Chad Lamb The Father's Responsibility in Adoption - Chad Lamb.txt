perceive all that you have for us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all while you're standing together if you want to take your Bibles we'll begin reading the scripture and I want to start by just giving a special thank you for all of those who were able to attend sister Jan Golden's funeral it was nice to have everybody gathered around the family and also those who were able to help uh help the family and help out with the funeral dinner especially we always appreciate sister Mana ball she always does a great job and organize that and and sister Elizabeth Brooks and Irina bom Gunner helped her a lot to prepare and we're also very thankful for all those who came the day of to prepare to to serve to clean up it means a lot to the family and I really appreciate all your efforts and all that you did there may God bless you also I just want to say I appreciated the song special from Brother William Brother William and his SI his his wife Sally and their children have moved from Uganda and relocated here they're staying with the shares right now but they intend to make this their home not just their physical home but their home church as well so we want to welcome them officially God bless you both it's good to have you with us amen we appreciate you also wanted to let you know that um sister uh Carolyn Kai's grandmother passed away she'd been quite sick for a long time and uh they expected this to happen but still it's a great loss for sister Carolyn she was very very close to this grandmother so brother Ben and sister Carolyn will be heading up there this week for the funeral up in Canada uh they'll be going up there for the Wednesday funeral so just remember to keep them in prayer and for sister Carolyn's family that that her mother and her father and her brothers and sisters and all those uh that God will just bless them all and so we just want at times like this especially it's it's really hard to lose a loved one but it's always especially hard it seems at holiday times and so because they're such family oriented times so let's just remember those who've lost loved ones and and those who have funerals or will have funerals let's just remember them in prayer all right will you do that amen God bless you let's uh look here at Galatians chapter 4 Galatians chapter 4 and I'm going to begin right at verse one Galatians 4:1 now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage of the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father therefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ amen God be praised you may take your seats amen may God bless us as we look into his word I want to take for a subject today the father's responsibility and adoption so we want to talk about adoption but we want to look at the father's responsibility and adoption and so brother bandam had a lot to say about adoption and one thing that is so beautiful in the message that we have is we've had a prophet who would come in this day who had the mind of God and he would take the scriptures and begin to expound them in a way that would that would it's it's it's uh if I could say I don't ever want to say anything wrong I just say what's on my heart it's not just that we understand what happened and what the scriptures mean but really in the expounding of the scriptures and the opening of the word in our day he's trying to show us who we are he's trying to get over to us who we are amen and and take the scales off of our eyes CU we were born into a world in a hybrid condition being alienated from the things of God coming forth with a flesh that was at enmity with God hating the things of God Amen and we were born into the world this way amen but it takes the word of God to begin to take the scales off of our eyes so we can recognize who we actually are and so I I appreciate this message and one of the things brother benam taught we're going to focus on today is adoption and he used adoption to begin to show us our purpose in this life and what God's goal is and where he's bringing us to and so it's it becomes really really important and so uh I want to look at the word adopt op option brother Brown tells us the definition but I go to the Greek concordance and it and it it tells us the word adoption and it says from a presumed compound of two words 5207 and 5087 those are just references and the strong concordance but when you go look at those two words which which this word adoption uh is a compound of these two Greek words the first one just means son just means an heir or a prodigy a progyny a son an offspring amen and you sisters when he says adoption of sons you're included so it sounds masculine but it really means Offspring yeah and then the second word I I can't pronounce but it means the definition of it is to set to put to place to set to fix establish to establish or to ordain so this word adoption isn't like the way we understand adoption where you take a child who has no parents and you bring him into the family it's not that kind of adoption this kind of adoption is where you take a son and you put them in position positional placing of a son to establish to set to fix uh uh to ordain to put or to place uh a son and so when we go back here to the scriptures if we go back to chapter 4:1 here in Galatians again says now I say that the air as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all so brother M's going to show us that he's already a child and he's already an heir but he differs nothing from a servant because he's not been brought into adoption yet he's not been placed in his position in the family he's just a child he's born into the family and being born into the family he's an heir he's part of the family but yet he's no different than a servant because he hasn't he hasn't been positionally placed yet yeah but he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father and this is one thing that I think is amazing when I look at the father's responsibility and adoption it says here until the time appointed of the Father the father is the one who's in control of the adoption it's his responsibility to bring a son to adoption amen and and he's the one who decided he want a son to begin with he got married amen he brought forth a son amen none of us came here because we decided to come here we we came here because somebody decided to be a father amen and because somebody decided to be a father then they had to take the responsibility as a father and and fulfill the role of a father for a son amen and we didn't come to this Earth because we decided to God decided to bring us forth and we are his sons and he he appointed us a time and a place to come forth on this Earth and now he has the responsibility of bringing us into adoption amen now that doesn't mean we don't have any responsibility we'll get that to another time but this time we're just looking at the responsibility of the father so he's under tutors and governors that means he's being trained up or taught until the time appointed of the father and so I'm going to just going to read the whole thing again even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son so the spirit of his son is the Holy Ghost it's the spirit of Christ why did he send it to us that our hearts will cry Abba Father because we were Sons that's who the spirit comes to because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart crying out but father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ praise God this is God's plan for us now brother bandam he says in the message a hidden life from 55 he starts to talk about this uh uh adoption and he says now the same son that was born into a family could be adopted into the same family or placed in the same family so I want you to catch that the same son that was born into a family so the son was already Born Into the family but he was going to be adopted into the family could be adopted into the the same family or placed in the same family or listen this or give a position in the family that he was born into so this is what we're really looking at through this kind of adoption that's what we're really focusing on this morning is given a position in the family that he was born into amen amen so he's already born into it but there's another purpose for him being born into the family not to just say hey I've got a son but I've got a purpose for this son this son is going to find a position in the family amen and I do believe that that is the work of the Holy Spirit today among the church is trying to place in the church positionally Apostles teachers prophets and so forth and we've seen many false alarms and so forth moving amongst the people which only indicated that the real genuine adoption was at hand I believe it God has to place into the church that's the business of God not of man cuz that's the father's business he decides where he wants to place the Sun how much responsibility he wants to give to the Sun and when he's going to place the sun there it's the responsibility of the father I was looking uh uh I was looking up biblical and Roman uh adoption practices and principles just looking up on the Internet trying to understand what the ancient adoption principle was like and it was it was interesting how it was uh very much what brother bam taught us but the one statement that I pulled out from there I thought was interesting is Roman adoption was almost always something that happened to an adult not a child and that makes sense with what we understand it's positional placing somebody's grown into a place where they can be positioned with a position of responsibility amen so you don't do that for children you do that for adults which means when you're born into the kingdom of God by the New Birth by the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a certain growing up that needs to take place so God can position you because this is almost always for adults not children amen that's what makes that adoption process uh quite different uh with them than what we understand he brother M says in the message hear ye him he says but now when this son they dressed this son and put him on a nice robe and they set him up in a public place where everybody could see him and the father had a ceremony of adoption and he placed the son or adopted him into his family then that son he was a full-fledged son his name was just as good on the check as his father's was woo that's interesting he finally come to a place where he could be trusted amen finally come to a place where the father could give him a certain realm of responsibility and trusted that he would act right in that responsibility and in giving him responsibility he also gave him Authority because responsibility without Authority will never work right right that's why when we strip Authority away from those who have responsibility amen the whole system begins to collapse so you you have school teachers who no longer have authority they only have responsibility it collapses you have police officers who have responsibility but no Authority because it's been stripped from them it collapses so that when God adopts a son amen and brings them into a position of responsibility he also gives them a certain amount of authority and so they can operate under that Authority amen they can operate operate as if God was operating in that position as if the father was operating in that position amen so they have a certain amount of authority now I I like what brother B said or they can be uh uh oh I forgot exactly how he worded I'm going to skip back to the quote he said or give a position in the family that he was born into so the we know there's levels to adoption if I could say it that way in different ways brother brandham used the principle of adoption Amen to describe several things one he describes adoption for us personally that we're born into the kingdom of God that God Amen raises us up and then places us and gives us a work to do and a certain responsibility and and uh authority to work in that realm amen for that's for us personally but we also know that we're growing to the ultimate of adoption and the ultimate of adoption will be the change of the body that'll be the great that'll be the great procedure when the father takes us and sets us on high and changes our garment and gives us a royal garment what's that Royal garment a glorified body amen and then he will position us position us into the kingdom as joint air with Jesus Christ in the Kingdom of David on this Earth in the Millennium so we know there's an Al there's another level of adoption that's coming and we're growing to that level of adoption so don't get confused when we start talking about this amen if God has raised you up matured you in Christ given you some responsibility a work to do here on Earth you've come to a certain level of adoption you've got a position in the family and that position may have parameters it may have you you're you you have been given this position in the family and that position could be limited so the father in ancient times he could he could give the son a position to rule over a certain estate but maybe not take the whole estate yeah that makes sense so that's a position and if he operates in that level of responsibility he has Authority he can make decisions he can do what he needs to in this realm but he can't rule the whole thing yeah amen that's right so now that's us as individuals God's placing Us in certain places and and and we can operate because it's God it's Christ operating through US Amen in this position but that doesn't change the fact that we're still growing to another adoption so don't think that all of our lessons are over just because we have a work to do we're still growing to to what I would say the fullness of adoption for us as individuals and when we come to a perfect Triune being amen when we drop the robe of Flesh and it's glorified and changed Amen to a perfect body but then also the church is growing into adoption not just now we're not talking about individuals now we're talking collectively the church is growing into adop op option and it's been growing amen through seven Church ages it's been growing as he's been building character and as he's been had her under tutors and and under Governors until the time appointed and bring so he's bringing the whole body of Believers to an adoption so we understand amen see the problem when we when brother man starts to uh uh grab types and he starts to parallel something with something else amen if we if we if we get too narrow-minded on that Parable we miss that it fits here and it fits here and it fits there the same principles hold true in many different areas so the principles of adoption hold true for me personally Amen in a work that he wants me to do while in this body while in the church while in this life but he's also grooming me under the tutor of the Holy Ghost to full adoption which is a change of a body where now I don't just have uh uh Authority in this one little area he's going to give the entire creation to Christ and his bride and she's going to sit on the throne with him ruling and reigning for a thousand years so that's that's not just one estate that's the whole thing and along with that God is growing the entire church into adoption all right so we're all on the same page amen amen because some things fit into one analogy better than the other or we say I've already got a position I already come to a adoption Oh no you're not done growing yet don't don't think because God's giv you a position giving you a work to do amen don't you dare think you're not done yet you're not done till till either you go to the sixth Dimension to your resting place or your atoms change until then amen he until he takes this up and changes our garment this flesh then we're still learning amen so now he says in uh a hidden life back to this message a hidden life in 1955 if you'll notice in a perfect type God did his own son the same way he taken three as a witness where the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word to be established Peter James and John love Faith and Hope and he taken them up into a mountain apart from the rest of the world and there before official Witnesses God adopted his own son he was transfigured before them and his reignment did shine as the sun god lifted him up and robed him in a glorified condition so that they could see he put a special garment on him of glory amen and they saw this was God this was God's adoption ceremony for Christ amen he was transfigured before them and his reignment did shine as the sun and a voice out of the cloud said this is my beloved Son hear ye him set him upon a mountain put the witness there to see it clothed them in a robe as bright as the sun shining and this then Even Shine Like the Sun and its strength and God spoke out this is my beloved Son hear ye him God adopted his own child into the family hear me no longer this is now this is in quotation so brother brandham is paraphrasing what brother what what God had spoke there when he says this is my beloved Son we know that at Jordan when when John the Baptist was baptizing Jesus came to Jordan and he was baptized and when he came up amen there was a voice out of Heaven said this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased so God had already declared this is my son and I'm pleased in him I'm working in him I'm dwelling in him but now when we come to this ceremony he adds a statement at the end of the statement so he repeats the first part this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased then he adds hear ye him and when he adds hear ye him there's a change now he added that phrase and that phrase means now he's the one with full Authority he's been given the kingdom everything I have is poured into him hear him amen he's the only voice he's the only source he's the only Authority and this is what brother bam says God adopted his own child into the family then he puts quotes here hear me no longer that doesn't mean we don't listen to God we don't that's not what he's saying hear me no longer but this is is my son who takes over from here on amen God is saying he fulfilled he's come to the place he's been proved he's been tested he's been tried he's been faithful to the word and never left one I owe to the word hear ye him I've poured everything I have is poured into him all authority all power everything is now subject to him amen then listen what brother B says he says amen that adoption is near the time and parable of the church it's time for that remember saying now that kind of adoption that Jesus Christ had it's coming close to that time for the church amen why because she's a joint Heir with Christ she's to rule and reign with him to sit on his very throne with him in marriage as a part of him United with him so she must come to the same position of adoption amen amen I want to look at Jesus's adoption if you will with me let's go to Matthew chapter 3 we just referred to it but I want to go back and and grab the scriptures and read it Matthew chapter 3 Matthew 3:16 and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and loow the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and L a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased so now God is showing and brother man uses this as a type and he begins to show us this is this is the fullness of the god coming into a body Jesus Jesus Christ and he say this is my son and I'm pleased to dwell in him this is where I'm at now amen and this is a type of our new birth because our new birth are you're born again when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost that's our new birth and our new birth brings Christ brings God dwelling within us declaring that we're a son this is our birth we're he's declaring we're a son we're born into the family and he's pleased to dwell in US amen by the by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so then I want to look now at the next verse chapter 4:1 then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil so after he declares this is my son and I'm pleased to dwell in him the very next things that happen is the tutor remember the Holy Ghost is our tutor brother benam says our governor he's he's training us the he's led by the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted tested proved amen verified this what all those words mean by the devil amen so God when he when he birthed his child now he starts the training process so Jesus is typing all of this out for us and showing us amen the the pattern that will follow so we know that that through Jesus's entire life uh he's being tested he's being buffeted he's being battled he's being rejected he's being he's being chased he's being all kinds of things are happening there's constantly tests and trials there's constantly manifestations and glor glorified things that are happening in his life is all these things that are happening for him and through him but then in Matthew 17 let's turn there this is Mount Transfiguration this is when he comes to the end of it Matthew chapter 17 and verse 1 and after 6 days Jesus taken Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto him Moses and Elias talking with them then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Eli Elias and while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him don't build any other Tabernacles don't look anywhere else only look to him he's come to adoption everything is poured in to him and God if we could say it this way in a type in a shadow God tested him God proved him and he was proved over and over and over to be a perfectly faithful son am to be he became the last Adam by by by doing what nobody else could do nobody else could fully obey God and keep the word of God but he could he could become a perfect son he could be a perfect son and demonstrate a perfect son Amen to become the last Adam and becoming the last Adam gave him the right now because he had no sin no flaw no Disobedience now he could come and shed his own blood as a substitute for all the seed Amen to buy back all that Adam lost and that's what Jesus Christ did but now God brings him to adoption and when does he bring him to adoption he brings to adoption and he says I've poured everything now to him you hear him and he did it when he was going to give him the greatest responsibility of all now he was going to lay upon him the responsibility to reverse all that had been done in the fall in Eden and he was going to do it by requiring iring that he bear the sins of the entire world and become the sin offering and become sin and become rejected of the father and become chastised and beaten and and mocked and scored and and take the sins of the world and carry them and separate them from the children of God and God was giving him the greatest responsibility of all but before he would give him this responsibility he tried him he tested him he proved him and he proved to be faithful he would never leave that word and now in the face of the greatest opposition ever in his life amen the greatest struggle until he struggled within himself amen the Bible says when he was at the Last Supper with his disciples he knew it was coming it said he was sorely vexed and grieved this wasn't you know Jesus wasn't he was a human being brother said he was completely God and completely man now when you've got that completely sorted out you come and talk to me but it's nonetheless the truth and as completely man he felt what men feel he felt what rejection was he felt what separation was he knew what loneliness was he knew he knew he knew what it was to be betrayed and he felt pain he knew what it was Amen to have the sting of a whip hit his back he wasn't it wasn't like he was immune from all of that because he was God in flesh no he was made a complete human being a man that when the whip come across his back he probably screamed out in pain like any man would scream out in pain and he felt the intensity the bite the sharp bite the pain the blood he could feel the warm blood flowing down his back and down the back of his legs he was a man and this man was in agony of spirit because he knew it was coming then he goes to Gethsemane and in Gethsemane amen uh he's he's agonizing so intently that his sweat was falling as great drops of blood listen this wasn't trivial this wasn't tiny this was Major and none of us may have ever felt that kind of Agony before in our lives I certainly know the blood is not separated from the water in my body and begin to come out like sweat I I know that for sure so I've never felt the intensity of the agony when all the resp responsibility was placed on his shoulders for the entire world am amen but before God brought him to adoption he tested him and he knew there's one thing I know he'll never leave the word and God could trust him with this level of responsibility when he comes to Gethsemane and he he struggling as a man he's saying father is there any way this cup can pass that's completely man but then he would say but not my will thine will that was the perfect son that was the one who who could be entrusted that's the one who could be given this level of responsibility amen amen so so we see in in Jesus's adoption what God had done bringing him to adoption but he brought him to adoption at the time he was going to give him the greatest responsibility and make him responsible for the whole family and the whole world but he had to know before now we say this in a type like God doesn't know and like he wasn't perfect sin sinless flesh we know that but God was demonstrating and showing that he already tested and proved this son amen and he could give him this level of responsibility and he wouldn't fail amen so brother bam goes on in the message hear ye him he says then how the father says sure proud of that son you know what happens when he gets his schooling his training yet he might not be able to exercise all authority he hasn't got it yet he's still a son but he hasn't been placed now you ministers know what I'm getting to a placing of a son now if that son proven to be a right kind of son and then he's got something in parenthesis here so he's going to give us the definition of what it means to be the right kind of son if that son proven to be the right kind of son so what's the right kind of son love the father's business stayed right with his instructions so what does it mean to be the right kind of son what does it mean to be the right kind of son today do you want to know what it means to love the father's business amen not our own business we have to love the father's business to love the father's business and stay right with his instructions see the the na in the natural the father's not going to bring a son to adoption and give him authority over part of his of his inheritance or part of his estate or all of it he's not going to do that until he knows that the son loves his business because if the son continues to have his own agenda and his own desires and he wants to go a different direction and he's got all these grandiose ideas and he's got these things he wants to do amen the father's not going to risk the estate what he's worked for all of his life and what what he has for the future uh uh of his progeny he's not going to risk it to a son who's taking his own idea and doesn't love the father's business but loves all kinds of other things and is not interested in what the father's interested in but he's looking for a son that loves the father's business amen it's why Jesus when he was 12 years old disput disputing with the the Pharisees in the temple amen and Mary comes to him and says amen my my father your father and I were looking for you he says don't you know I must be about my father's business why because that's what he was here for that was his whole purpose he was being tested and tried to see if he would be only about the father's business amen and stay right with his instructions God so for us to stay with the father's business amen and to O fully obey the word the father then on a certain day took that son out before the public set him up on a high place clothed him in a beautiful garment and and he had they called the adoption of a son or placing a son positionally what he was they had a ceremony and then the father said this my son I adopt him or I place him positionally and they had checks in those days that son's name on the check would be just as good as his father's name was cuz he was placed and the son could fire who he wanted to he could hire who he wanted to he was in full possession of all the father had let's go to the book of Ephesians together now and we're going to go to Ephesians chapter 1 all right Ephesians chapter 1 verse4 Ephesians 1:4 according as he ha chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without him without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his Grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved so why are we coming to adoption because he predestinated us unto adoption we're not coming to adoption because we want to come to adoption now I I don't disagree with that statement I want to come to adoption I don't know about you but I want to please my father I want to be about my father's business I I want to follow his instructions I want him to be able to trust me and to do something for his kingdom I want to come to the fullness of adoption where he can change my atoms and I can move into another position I want those things I do want them but me wanting them will never produce it it had to be God Desiring it before the foundation of the world and God birthing me into his kingdom God bringing forth a son with a purpose for that son and that purpose was to bring the son to adoption amen so he's predestinated us unto an adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will so it's not my will it's his will it wasn't my idea it was his idea so the father now God himself is responsible for our adoption that's doesn't mean we have no responsibility like I said we'll get into that some other time but God is the one who predetermined that he is going to birth us into his kingdom and bring us into adoption amen so now he has to see fit that he does everything necessary for the son so the son can be brought into a position of adoption why because that's the good pleasure of his will that what that means is God wants me to come to adoption God wants me to give a position in his kingdom he wants to give me Authority and responsibility he wants me to be a partaker of all that he is and all that he has that's according to his good pleasure so no matter how much I want to do something for the kingdom my want is only a reflection of his want that came first amen it was according to the good pleasure of his will and this scripture is the very thing that gives us courage to keep pressing forward because it wasn't me who wanted to do something for God it's God who wanted me to do something in his kingdom and he foresaw it he knew it ahead of time I was a thought in his mind and he saw what works I would do and he wanted me to do them amen it's and and it's not like God says well I want this son to take this part and I want this son to be in this position ah they're not working out I'll just get somebody else to take that position if that's the way it is then he's not perfect in his thoughts before the foundation of the world he's having to change them so that means friends he wants you and I to come to adoption he wants you and I to be partakers of the Kingdom that's his desire he wants us to have a part he wants us to mature he wants us to grow he wants to give us a position he wants us to come to a body change he wants us to rule and reign with Christ for a thousand years that's what he wants amen now you can have a rebellious son who doesn't want what the father wants and boy that makes the process of adoption really difficult he wants to do his own thing and have some fun and he wants to experience this and he doesn't want to have to do all of this learning all of this stuff I don't why am I learning Latin why am I learning math why am I going through this why am I having to obey this why do I keep having to come back to class over and over and over again the Father Knows Why the father knows the position you're going to hold and everything that you have to learn along the way to take that position he knows you're going to need trigonometry and you're looking at trigonometry say why do I have to do trigonometry the father knows you're going to need it down the road that's why so many of us say why did I have to go through this as a child and why do I have to be like this and why couldn't it be like why could my uh past as a child not be like this other brother's past as a child because God knows the position from before the foundation of the world he's got a position for you to hold and you must come through tutors and governors Amen to be trained up to take that spot and your training won't be like somebody else's training because your spot is unique to you now if the son's rebellious and always resisting with the father it's going to be harder it's going to be harder and in the natural in the natural some Sons never come to adoption they're Sons but they never got with the program the difference between that and this and the types is God predestinated us to the adoption of sons by the good pleasure of his will amen so that means if we're like the rebellious son and we're not we're not we don't want to follow the instructions and follow the tutor and we got our own ideas about things not so much interested in the father's business or all of his instructions don't worry he's predestinated us to adoption so he knows how to change the circumstances to get us to change our mind God can't force us into anything that's not the way he works he works off free moral agency and he hasn't taken that away but his predestination trumps are free moral agents now he never takes away our choice but he absolutely knows how to change the circumstances till we want to choose what he wants us to choose and I say thank God I'm so thankful God didn't let me go the way I wanted to go but he changed the circumstances and brought hard things in my life until finally I recognized there's only one way that I want to live when I want to live according to the word and that's my desire that's not because I'm afraid of being Cast Away or lost now I've come through so many battles and so many difficulties there's only one thing I want I want to be about the father's business I want to follow his instructions amen so God has predestinated us unto adoption now remember we understand adoption now it's it's not just saying God's predestinated me to be part of the family for that's true also but he predestinated me to be positionally placed and that you know what friends that's 100% true for everyone there's nobody who doesn't have a position in the body so don't let the devil lie there's so many times I see people struggle so many times with what's my position what am I called to do what should I do my my my my word to you is relax he predestinated it right you're going to fit in yeah reality really is you're probably already doing it and you just don't recognize it as your position amen we'll get into that in a few minutes in the adoption message adoption part two he preaches a series on adoption in 1960 and adoption part two he says your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing when you were born again uh John 1:7 I believe when we are born of the spirit of God we are sons of God but we were predestinated now there's what I'm trying to get to you for the sons of the last day you see we we were predestinated unto adoption now here we are now this is what hurts Pentecostal a little they say I got born again praise the Lord got the Holy Ghost fine you're a child of God that's right but yet that ain't what I'm talking about see you were predestinated unto adoption adoption is placing a son so it's not it's it's it's exciting to be part of the family and say I've been born again I'm part of the family that's a thrill it's a thrill to know who your father is it's a thrill to know what family you're part of it's a thrill to know what your last name is and where you belong that's a thrill but that wasn't the purpose of your birth the purpose of your birth was to come to adoption amen and adoption part two again he says but now to place how are you you're first born into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost how many knows that all right the next you are predestinated unto the what adoption what is that you are predestinated unto the placing so that's God's will let's turn to John uh 15 together John chapter 15 we're going to go to verse 16 he says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you oh I love that friends amen you have not chosen me but I've chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he will give it you so Jesus is saying you've not chosen me but I've chosen you and ordained you this word ordained is different than other words translated ordained in the Bible do you remember when I told you that the word adoption comes from two Greek words one meaning a son and the other meaning to place or position this ordained is that second word I placed you put you in place I positioned you and this is what Jesus is telling his disciples says you've not chosen me but I've chosen you and ordained you placed you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain God determined where their place would be and 1 Corinthians chapter 12 let's turn there 1 Corinthians 12 12 and verse 17 1 Corinthians 12: 17 in this uh uh portion of the book of Corinthians Paul is writing about the body and he's typing the natural body with the spiritual body with the church with the body of Christ and and he's running parallels all through there but I just want to pull out uh two verses verse 17 and 18 he said if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where the smelling but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him amen that is key friends that is a key phrase amen it to me it doesn't really matter what we think amen I I I don't want to say that in a derogatory way it matters what we think it's important what we think but but God has set in the body every member as it pleased him amen so whatever he determined us to be in whatever position he told us to hold or ordained for us to hold in the body is according to his pleasure according to the uh Good Will of his pleasure and it's going to be that way so we might desire something else for ourselves but Desiring something else for ourselves means we're no longer about the father's business or his instructions it means we're not a fit son yet for adoption because we want something other than what God ordained for us right we can say well this is my position but I would like to have that position well you can't have that position because God as it pleased him set you in this position and listen I tell you every other position looks better to the one who's in a position cuz when you're in a position you get the full experience of it and The Full Experience is not always positive there's self-sacrifice there's some negatives there's some things go along with it and then when you're in this position serving in the capacity God's told you to serve you say oh it would be great if I was this but just as soon as you got over there and you started working in that position you'd be like oh it'd be great if I was over here because everything we requires a selflessness a sacrifice everything we do for the body is something that we give of ourselves for the body it's not for us it's for the body to benefit the body as a whole which means it comes with self sacrifice amen amen amen and so whatever we think and however we think about oh you know I just wish I could be a nose I wish I could be a finger the thumb is so important until you're a thumb and you're like why am I always so odd why am I always different than everybody else around me how come I don't fit in amen that's the way it is friends that's exactly the way it is for us but God set us as it pleased him and God wants to positionally place us because that's the reason we were born into the kingdom and in that position there's a certain amount of authority and responsibility that go together let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God ha before ordained that we should walk in them so we just keep reinforcing the same idea that God has done it according to his good pleasure amen he's ordained it he even knows the very works that we're going to do and he's ordained us to do those Works back in the message of adoption this is adoption part one now now now who could doubt that that's what Paul said that's Paul's scripture that's Paul's writing that's what he taught his church the church positioning before the foundation of the world when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body then listen what he says next he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or to be that he placed you position amen and and I go through that because it's a little bit stunning when you think about it because when we start thinking about being positioned in the body of Christ we think of only spiritual things and we think when we say what's my position in the church so many people have asked what's my position in the church what's my position in the body and the misconception is is what is the role I play during our church services well there's only a few people that's going to play a role during the church services what's everybody else on Earth to do so what's my position the church is not the building and the church is just not what happens on Sunday and Wednesday the church is the body of Christ and the body of Christ has many members and every member is there to function in the body to the benefit of somebody else in the body amen so there's a lot more positions than just the position we see active when we come together on Sunday and Wednesday and so he says he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a pro well I understand preacher I understand Prophet but how am I positionally placed in the body to be a housewife because God God wants to demonstrate his kingdom in a housewife and a farmer and whatever the occupation or the position amen and the reality is we believe that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord do we believe that we believe so the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord absolutely that's the truth if that's the truth then the position I'm in is the position he wants me to be in and the problem that I find so many times in myself and others is we're always looking for another position but we're not operating the kingdom in the position we have now cuz we're always saying what can I do for the body what can I do for the kingdom what should I be what should I do relax the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord he's got you in a position live in that position when he moves you to another position live in that position amen let's go to some examples let's go to Acts chapter n there's several scriptures are going to read and um several weeks ago I was invited to a a a lunch and fellowship with the the single sisters in the church and I really enjoyed that and I I was thinking of something to share with them and I shared this thought with them I'm not going to share the whole thought that I shared with them but there was certain part of it that really I don't know when I started reading it just things started clicking for me I really enjoyed I really enjoyed it so I'm going to share just the point of that and what I was doing with them is showing them examples of people who are ministering to the body but it was in ways that uh you wouldn't normally think and I Ed three examples of three different women or groups of women because I was talking to all sisters at that time so you Brothers this is all sisters but you're going to have to include yourself just like when we say Sons the sisters have to include themselves so now when I talk about these these women these sisters you men going to have to include yourself it's their turn now Acts chapter 9: 36 acts 9:36 now there was at japa a certain disciple named Tabitha which by interpretation is called Dorcas this woman was full of of good works and arms Deeds which she did and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber and for as much as Lydia L Lita was nigh to japa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent unto him two men Desiring him that he would not delay to come to them then Peter arose and went with them when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them but Peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and turned him to the body saying Tabatha arise and she opened her eyes when she saw Peter when she saw when she saw Peter she said sat up and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the Saints and widows presented her alive praise God so now we have this sister named Tabitha which is Dorcas by interpretation and she had passed away and they went and got Peter when Peter comes in the first thing they do is start to show her they they start to show him the value she is to the body what was she doing she was making garments and coats and the widows were showing she probably made them for more than widows but the widows were there showing the garments and coats that Dorcas had made and and it's amazing to me they're presenting to Peter tokens of This Woman's position and showing the value she has to the body and the way she served the body oh know I love that now let's go to Luke Chapter 2 Luke Chapter 2 Luke 2:36 and there was one Anna a propheus the daughter of uh fuel the of the tribe of Asser she was of great age and had lived with a husband 7 years from her virginity and she was a widow of about 4 score and four years which uh departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day and she came in that instance gave thanks likewise unto the Lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem so here you have Anna a prophetess who never leaves the temple and she's in fasting and prayer constantly and she recognizes Christ also and she goes in declares of him to everyone that was looking for Redemption now let's go from there to uh Mark 15 Mark chapter 15 Mark 15: 40 and it says in Mark 15:40 and there was also women looking AAR off this is at the crucifixion among whom was Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and the Les the less and of Joseph and of solom who also when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered unto him and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem so this word here it says they followed him and ministered unto him this word Minister means to serve these sisters were following Jesus and Jesus's Ministry in his travels and they were actually cooking food for him and serving him and so here we've pulled three examples and in the three examples the first was a sister named Dorcas and she had made garments and coats amen for those who were in need and they were showing the garments and coats the second was Anna a prophetess who spent all her time in fasting and prayer and third was a group of women who followed Jesus around they were cooking for him and serving him and make sure he had a meal and had rest and had the things that he needed three completely different works in the body and listen the in order to to make it like well the best was to do what Anna did or the best was to do what dor no these women did what came natural for them because God had ordained a position for them when Jesus was on Earth he need somebody that was going to cook for him and maybe take care of his cleaning who knows what else they took care of for him but they ministered unto him following him about in his ministry amen God needed somebody to fulfill that role God needed somebody to take care of garments and coats for the widows but God needed somebody that was given to fasting and prayer in the temple day and night and these people weren't trying to do the best works these people weren't trying to find out what's the best thing I can do they were actually doing what came natural to them amen this message doesn't come to bring us into bondage the gospel never come to bring us into bondage it come to free us from bondage to where I don't have to follow somebody I don't have to become what I'm not amen what God wants me to be is what he ordained me to be what he purposed for me to be and he wants me to fit into the position in the body that he ordained me to fit so in order to fit in that position it should be a fit like a hand in a glove amen amen because why this is his good pleasure he ordained it he's done it as it pleased him God and brother B teaches us that God watched over us as we came down genetically as we came down from grandfather grandmother and he and brother B said he would breed this one to that one to get a certain characteristic amen he he talked about a man making Chimes he would put in so many different metals to make a certain alloy to get a certain thing he need so much tin and so much copper and so much lead and so much of these things and to get a certain sound because he needed that certain note to play so that there could be a piece of music that was played and without that note it couldn't be played so God God is showing amen that down through time he has watched over even your physical body to get certain characteristics and attributes into you because he had designed a purpose for you before the foundation of the world and he had to get the ingredients just right so you could express what was in his mind before the foundation of the world the problem we run into is because of the Fall we got a few extra ingredients but that's why it takes the sword of the word to cut some of those off that's why we keep coming back under the preaching of the word because brother B said the end time evangelism is shaping the stones to fit into the temple and there's got to be a man that can take the sword of the word amen and begin to shape Stones amen and that that's Christ working through his fivefold ministry in the end time evangelism to shape us because we got a few extra ingredients along the way because of the Fall we may have got a temper we may have got jealousy and we may have got a a propensity to lie we may have got an extra dose of Pride but by the grace of God he's got a sword of the word amen and Ministry of the word that's going to start cutting that away so everything else he put inside of us can begin to shine forth so when we look at positional placing our position is what we've been made for amen we've been made for we've been shaped for even the shaping of the trials and troubles and struggles and the good and the bad and everything through life is all working together for God to place Us in the body according to his good pleasure and don't forget that pleasing could be a housewife or a farmer or a preacher or a prophet and you can fill in all the blanks with wherever you are in life that could be a positional placing in the body and that means if God's put put us in that position there's a certain amount of responsibility he wants to give us and if that's what's in us to do then we have the responsibility to do it because it was in Anna to fast and pray Anna was responsible to fast and pray am that was her position in the body if she let it down it was let down because who else was going to do it right if it was that these group of sisters job to minister to Jesus Christ along the way in physical Ministry if they let down the bar amen who's going to M they were ordained for that work and so we I think we should stop uh this is just me we should stop fussing and worrying so much about what our position is in the church and just do what comes natural and trust God to lead and do it with all of your heart and do it according to his word and do it according to his kingom and keep focused on the father's business and his instructions and just keep focused no matter what it is in your heart to do keep focused on one thing the father's business and his instructions and God will use whatever is in your desire for his kingdom yeah and if he wants to correct you he can correct you if he wants to change you he can change you if he wants to move you he can move you but it's not about us wandering around like lost souls trying to find something God has made us to do it he is fashioned us to do it he's put ingredients in us to do it and he pre he predestinated us to do it the biggest thing we need to do is relax and be about the father's business and whatever is in our hand to do do it with our might whatever God has given us to do fully embrace it and do it is if he's given you a position in the body fully embrace it if he's given you a position as a housewife do it as unto the Lord if you're a mother amen be the Fifth Gospel amen be the preacher to those kids do it as part of your kingdom work if you're a father lead your family into the ways of righteousness because that's the kingdom work don't say what's my position are you have a family are you married there's a position work that according to the will of God amen amen amen amen and whatever else he has God will God's not going to ordain us for something and leave the position vacant he's going to move us into that position because it's his predestinated will it's his predestinated plan Amen brother B says in adoption part two he says yep sure do uh said the Holy Spirit I've given him test this is the holy spirit reporting back to the father so this is the tutor reporting back to the father now brother B's using this in a way of dramatizing because who is the Holy Spirit it's the spirit of God Amen so he's reporting back to the father like he's got to go back and report to the father we don't have three persons in a godhead but he's dramatizing it the holy spirit said I give him test boy I tried him this way and I tried him that way I throwed him down Sick I put him under I stomped him I let the devil do everything to him he could do he came right back up again listen okay remember what adoption is the father wants this son to inherit either all the kingdom or a portion of the of the estate and so he gives him to the best tutor he can to bring the child into position to take the position he has for him so what does this best tutor do here's what he does I've throw him down sick I've put him under I stomped on him I let the devil do everything to him I could do he came right back up again oh praise God you mean this Troublesome life that I've been living it isn't outside the desire of God it means it's part of God shaping me for the work he wants me to do it means this isn't a pointless series of a bunch of bad things happening in my life absolutely not friends it is ordained of God under the tutelage of the Holy Ghost and he's bringing us just as Jesus Christ was led to the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil God has a plan for us and a position we must fit into and we've got to learn how to follow the father's business and keep his instructions despite whatever happens to us you know what's so discouraging what becomes so discouraging is trial after trial after trial with no purpose it's just an endless cycle of pain and confusion and disappointments but when the isav comes on when the word of God comes to clear away the crust off our eyes we don't see it as an endless cycle of pain and confusion and suffering we see it as a Godly plan to bring us into a great position he had for before the foundation of the world because if God's got to shape me and mold me to bring me to a body change to sit with him on his throne then I say God shape me God mold me if you got to stomp me down if you got to put me under if you got to cause rejection to come whatever Christ went through do you think we're not going to go through Jesus Christ and his pilgrim he come down the the the the spirit descended like a dove claimed this vessel dwelt in the vessel what a glorious thing from then on it was nothing but trouble we don't even hear much about Jesus's life previous to his baptism and previous to his baptism we only have one little interjection and that's when he was 12 amen uh disputing with them in the temple amen but we we don't have any reason to believe that for 30 years it was like it was after after he was claimed as a son after amen he was infilled with the fullness of God after he was declared to be the son whom I'm well pleased we do have record of that life from then on and go read the record and tell me when did he have A Moment's Peace why he was being shaped molded tested proved because God had something wonderful and glorious for him to do he had ordained it so now our Liv shouldn't be such a mystery we shouldn't be crying out all the time God where are you why are you letting this happen to me and why it doesn't mean that in the times of trouble we shouldn't have self-reflection we should have self-reflection say God is there any way I'm not pleasing to you is there anything that you want me to do different amen are you trying to get my attention those things are important friends but I've said to many many people when I've talked to them about this I say this once you've reflected and once you've asked God don't start making up stuff right because that's what we tend to do we tend to think this has to be happening for a reason Maybe I'm Wrong somewhere and we start overanalyzing things and we start making things a problem that weren't a problem I believe if God is correcting us and chastising us it's in his best interest to tell us what he's chastising us for amen he doesn't keep it a secret I'm just going to Chas but I'm not going to tell him why because the whole point of chastising is correction so we won't do it again so why would he keep it a secret why would it be a mystery what we did wrong if the whole point of chastisement is correction to change our Behavior I believe if we've done something wrong God would show us so after a time of self-reflection then just settle in and say God's working something in my life he's molding my character he's proving me he's demonstrating something he's living his word through me he's shaping me for something else Glory to God Amen it's that attitude that takes hopelessness away it's that attitude that we we as sons of God we know the Revelation in our hearts and we know what God has told us through this messenger and this end time what he showed us in his word and we know that God is not purposeless in the things he he's purposeful and my life is not a vain empty treasury my life is to to serve a I'm on this Earth for the years I'm here to serve uh on this Earth to serve a purpose in the kingdom of God that God ordained before the foundation of the world and he wants to do something it may still yet be a mystery me to me and I may not have a full picture of what it is but I believe it's there and I believe he's working and all I need to do is trust that the father is responsible to bring me to adoption and everything he has the tutor do in my life is for the end purpose that's right so I'm going to read this again I've throw him down sick I've put him under I stomped him I let the devil do everything to him he could do he come right back up again he come the same come up again I made him sick I done this I throwed him in the hospital I took him out there and I done this I done that I turned his wife against him I turned his neighbor against him I turned everything that didn't make a bit of difference said though he slay me yet will I trust him I killed his family I took this I did this I done this I did this that the other still he stood right up though he slay me yet I'll serve him he's mine what was this son showing that he was in love with the father's business and the father's instructions right if God purposed for me to walk this path then glory be to God let me walk it according to his word so that he gets the glory and whatever he wants to do in my life he said he goes on in the message oh well I believe we ought to call him out somewhere to a little special place and have an adoption now when the father in the Old Testament understood that his son was come of age and he had been seasoned out into adoption they've borned a child but they're they're a son right then but then they never they'll never be no more than just a child just an ordinary son until they mature and show what they are then he calls him out then now here we are church are you ready now it's a little bit late everybody bite your finger pinch your soul pluck your heart just for a minute now we're going to to place the church now when the church gets to that place he says manasse You Belong over here Ephraim you over here then he takes them out to a certain place the father does and he sets him up on a high place like this and he has a ceremony and they all come around and he said I want everyone to know that this is my child and I adopt my son and I want everyone to know from hence forth that I dress him up a special dress on him and I want you to know that that his name is just as good on any check as my name is he's my child I adopt him into my family although he's been my son since he was born since he received the Holy Ghost he's been my son but now I'm going to place him positionally in Authority what he fires is fired what he hires is hired amen amen amen amen amen you know we look at great big things but brother M taught us stop looking at great big things start looking at where you are if you're a father in your home and a spirit starts getting a comes against your home whoever you fire is fired you've been given Authority in your position to take Dominion over your own hous why cuz you're the father you're the gatekeeper God gave those that wife to you gave those children to you you're the father don't be afraid to exercise your rights as a father sir don't move outside your boundary but within your boundary in the estate that he's given you okay son I'm giving you I trust you to raise these these Souls you know if God put you in a position he trust you to operate in that position see we're plagued because of humanity we're plagued with self-doubt and self- reses we're we we we understand what it means to be fearful to be reserved to to to have uh uh restraint and self-doubt and we we all know what that feels like but if God's put you in that position don't be afraid of that position if God's called you to be a mother amen then you you take authority as a mother you have a right over that jurisdiction of those Souls of your child Amen to be a preacher a pastor to them to be the Fifth Gospel to them and to keep your home in a certain way and you've got Authority and anything that comes against that you've got the right spiritually to resist it amen God trusted you yeah if you have a position in the church God trusted you to have that position don't be afraid to take the position God's put you in why because it's all part of his program when we when we go to the workplace don't be afraid if God's called you to be a farmer don't be afraid to be a farmer or whatever trade don't be afraid of the position you're in amen if you've got a coworker who trust in you and they ask you for prayer don't be afraid to take authority in the position God put you in don't be afraid to be a son wherever he's placed you don't be afraid and if we keep looking to something else will happen in my life and I'll be somewhere else and God will move me somewhere else we're missing exactly where he wants us to take dominion and take authority we're missing the responsibility and the authority that he's given us in our position so God God is showing brother B is showing us here that when we come to adoption under the tutelage now remember I want you to remember we're talking about personal adoption of placing in the body of Christ but we're talking about ultimate adoption too so we're still in the path is the Holy Ghost still your tutor amen amen so we go back to the Holy Ghost put the boy under all kinds of tests throwed him down Sick put him under stomped him let the devil do anything he could he turned his wife against him turned his neighbor against him killed his family did this that and the other but all those things were necessary in the training of the boy and all those things are necessary in our training because to come to the fullness of adoption for us we we we're going to have to grow all the way to the body change and this church has got to grow to Perfection to full maturity to completion and I believe this is the generation that it has to happen in amen according to the prophecy according to the word it has to happen in this generation and God is going to have to train us and teach us and what is he trying to teach us he's trying to teach us to love the father's business and to keep his instructions to me I believe that's the lesson that he's trying to get over to us what Jesus learned the bride of Christ is learning brother bam said in the Philadelphian Church age out of the church age book he makes a statement that I I really enjoyed he says you see the spirit is speaking about the word of God which is given to us to wait for the Fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of Abraham he endured a seeing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word finally was fulfilled this is the way God teaches his people patience remember we're still learning we're not done if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestation the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience but would become even more impatient with love life so what are these trials doing what is this I've got this God I've come to you with this problem and I know your word says and I know you've promised and I believe your word God I'm trusting in you I don't understand why it hasn't gone away this is how he teaches his children because if every time as the children of God if every time we had prayed it'd come into instant manifestation we would actually become more impatient with life not more patience and the greater impatience would create a character flaw that would actually hinder us when we come into needing to have greater manifestation in times of trouble so God in his goodness I I I I I don't know I just don't know for sure I'm just going to share something with you I don't know for sure this is just brother Chad completely but if God is moving us amen into this position of of full adoption the change in the body if he's adopting the church and he's going to display the church under its full maturity at the very end of the end time we know the things the prophet said that there's going to be difficulties coming to that time exactly the way they were for Jesus Christ and when Jesus Christ came to those difficulties it got more and more and more difficult and the and the level of the supernatural became more and more and more diminished until at the end the very spirit of God leaves him and he feels like he's abandoned and all by himself by the time he gets to that position he's going to have to know how to move in the word know his position and know how to hold steady and trust in God because he's not feeling much at that time he's not seeing everything around him is absolutely negative at that time he's been betrayed all his disciples run away from him he's under trial the government is conspiring or the the the priesthood is conspiring with the government there's a coalition coming together everything everything around him is coming to take him out and he has to stand with patience and trust God now if there's any semblance of that even a fraction of that that's coming for the bride in the end time then I think as we near that God's going to have to train us to stand in that day and how will he train us to stand in that day maybe he needs to teach us more patience than we have to have now and how does he teach us Patience by not allowing it to happen the moment we pray it doesn't come to instant manifestation he's teaching us to trust him he's teaching us to love the kingdom and stay within the instructions and watch God work amen now I say that's just me just seeing what Jesus went through the things that brother Benham said it could be completely different than my understanding but I believe that the responsibility of the father bringing us to adoption he will he will have us prepped he will have us trained he will have us taught how to to handle that hour and what do you think's happening right now in our lives as we constantly have one trial after another trial one circumstance after another I believe the father has the tutor preparing us for that hour amen what is it that I need more than anything else to focus on what should I be doing God where should I be going what work should I be doing amen I after reading these quotes the one thing that's come alive to me is there's two things that I need to focus on more than anything that's the father's business it's got to become priority focus in my life that I love his business not my own right because the problem with us is we still love our own business we still have our own agenda and our own things that we want to accomplish and not all of that is evil some of that goes right along with the business of the father but my priority has to be the business of the father my love has to be his kingdom work and two I have to follow his instructions and now I may not understand everything that's happening or how it plays in or or or why it's happening or what God's trying to do I don't know if he's trying to teach me character I don't know trying if he's trying to display an attribute through me to so I don't know I have no idea but one thing I know is what he wants from me is for me to love his business and to keep his Commandments to stay with his word regardless so I want to be able I want to be able to fulfill that above everything else brother bam goes on in this same quote he says he quotes Hebrews 11:17 by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise the word of God offered up his only begotten son there it is there is Abraham was tried after he received the promise of the word most think that as soon as we pray in jesus' name over the good Promises of God that there could there could not be a trial but here it says that Abra Abraham was tried after he received the promise that is exactly correct according to the psalmist referring to Joseph 1059 uh that's is Psalms 10519 until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him God gives us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patience into our souls for only in patience do we possess life do you believe that we're coming to the fullness of adoption to the change of the body do you believe the church is coming to adoption to full maturity amen then he's training us he's training us in this work why because it's the father who wants to bring us to adoption it's not us I don't say that as if we don't also want it but it's the good pleasure of his will it's what he's ordained and what he's purposed and he and he wants it and he's going to have it and in his goodness he's watching over the whole adoption process and he's making sure that we have every everything we need to make it to adoption we have the tutor we have the word we have instruction now we're going to have patience we're going to have self-sacrifice we're going to have denial we're going to have faith we're going to have courage we're going to have everything that we need and he's looking after it to make sure that under the tutelage of the Holy Ghost which is himself his spirit in us he's bringing us to everything we need to take that final position in James chapter 1 I'm just going to read it to James chapter 1 says my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith work is patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so this thing we talk about patience it's not a little thing it's not just a side characteristic but but when patience has her perfect work it'll make you perfect that's fully mature and entire that's complete and wanting nothing so this work of patience that he's working in our lives I mean what is it you're going through what is it you need an answer for what is it that's come about again and again and again and you don't see the light at the end of the tunnel what is that maybe that's the father working patience in your life because patience when it's done her perfect work will make you perfect entire wanting nothing maybe that's the very love of the father bringing you to the position he wants you to be in praise be to God this word patience means enduring steadfastness constancy endurance praise God it it gives this description said in the New Testament the characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfastly oh I want to read that again I'm going to read that again this is this is when James says the trying of your faith worketh patience and patience when she's done a per this is the patience this is what patience is steadfastness constancy endurance in the New Testament the characteristic of a man who is not swered from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Fai faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfastly he his sufferings are patiently and steadfast amen what can I do to please God Amen brother B told us in the message I know he said Sunny bright skies and cloudless days they no sign of God's approval neither are cloudy skies and rain and all these things signs of his disapproval his his love is proved to us in the Beloved that we were chosen in the Beloved election is his love for us so we don't we can't doubt God's love in the midst of a trial because we're elected how do we know we're elected because he revealed it to us amen he brought us into the revelation of the hour showing us who we really are so I can't doubt that now he's revealed it and he loves me oh yes he loves me even when the cloudy skies are bursting forth and the rain is coming amen he still loves me but but listen to what he says next but how can I prove my love to him by conducting myself with joy in the midst of the trials that he sees fit to let come my way amen I pray that God brings us into a revelation of adoption to where to where when things are going sideways and backwards are upside down and mean that we don't lose our minds that's what that's what I've wanted all my life and all of especially my Christian Life I just want to be stable and steadfast and trust God I I can't control my emotions always the emotions go everywhere but I want an anchor deeper that'll pull the emotions down and say wait a minute wait a minute God never changed his mind about me he can't change his word it's still the promise is still true regardless of what these eyes see or this mind thinks or these emotions feel the word is true and I'm putting all my faith in him amen I tell you friends I'm not there yet but that's where I want to be I want to be a son that he can trust I want to be a son that shows my love for him how do I prove my love for him by conducting myself with joy in the midst of the trial you know how hard that is it's the hardest thing in the world how are we going to do that beat down knocked down made sick wife turned against neighbor turned against us everything turned against us how are we going to still prove our love to him by saying God I thank you for everything I know this has a purpose amen how do we get to this position it's the revelation of the message it's the only isap that can take the scales away so where life circumstances doesn't keep tripping us up remember when we go into the holy of holies in the temple and the journey to the holiest of holies where it's just you and God Alone that Journey has to go through stages and the first stage is the is from outside of the camp of God outside of God totally ignorant to the things of God now you come through the gate Amen to the sacrificial altar to recognize Jesus Christ as your savior and as you move in there you're now walled off from the world Amen but there's no covering for you so if it's sunny it's outside it's sunny on you if it's rainy outside is rainy on you your emotions are up and down and whatever is happening to the world is having an effect on you but that's not the end of our journey we got to get to God where it's just me and God as one unit and to do that I've got to go from the outer Court into the inner court amen where now I have the light of the messengers of the light of the word the showbread of Fellowship the table of incense when my prayers are before God and when I move in there now the curtain falls behind me now if it's sunny outside I'm not aware I've got another light if it's dark outside I'm not aware if it's raining I'm unaware amen I'm not affected by those things anymore I'm still here I'm here I'm approaching to God I'm moving closer but that's not the destination because brother brandom said that bread grows old it had to be eaten every week and replenished amen and these this this lamp stand it carboned up the Wicks had to be trimmed and the oil had to be put back in he said that's not enough that's just a stage on the journey but we've got to go beyond that last Veil into the holy of holies now brother said there's a lot of people outside the gate then there's still a lot of people in the outer court but fewer people in the inner court amen in the Holy place but when you get to the holy of holies there's only two you and God and you're becoming one and in there there's the light that won't fade won't carbon up doesn't need anything doesn't need maintenance doesn't need attention that's a fire of God burning in your soul where's the holy place in you we got to get out of this outer Court out of the inner court and down into the place where that light never Fades no matter what happens to the place where there's a bread down in there and that's the that's the holy Mana of God that in the presence of God that word never grows old never grows stale but is as fresh as the day it fell amen and God's there himself amen that's our journey that's where we're going that's where I want to be if there's war outside doesn't matter if there's a Tumo it doesn't matter times are good doesn't matter times are bad it doesn't matter if the economy is good the econom is bad nothing matters cuz here I have light here I have life here I have bread here I have everything that I need is applied to me right here and this holy of holies that's where I believe God's growing us to that's where I want to be that's why when brother brenon preached the the Rapture amen he goes to the psalm and he says thou has hidden me in thy Tabernacle in the privacy of thy Pavilion where where was David amen when all my enemies were gathered about me when they desired to eat up my flesh what's he preaching he's preaching the Rapture message he's preaching the end time events that lead lead up to the change of the body and where do we find God's chosen we find him in a tabernacle up on a rock with his head above his enemies what's that rock that's the revelation of Jesus Christ the Revelation that's contained in this message set him up on the safety of a rock head above all the heads of the enemies greater understanding greater Revelation and in there amen he's communing with God trouble all around him but there's no trouble in this Pavilion I want to get to the place where there's trouble all around me and that trouble can affect this flesh and that trouble can affect this mind yeah but I want to go deeper than my flesh and my mind cuz the answer is in the soul it's the holy Place praise be to God Amen when we come back to adoption he says I'm going to read just a couple quotes out of adoption and then we're going to come to a close said did you notice Moses that great miracle performer that brought down Israel down through the land and brought them up to the promised land but did not Place their inheritance to them he did not give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but Joshua divided the land to the people is that right and Christ brought the church up to the place where their possession was made to them was given to them just the Jordan to cross but the holy spirit is the one who sets the church in order the Joshua of today puts the church in its order giving to each one gifts places position and he's the voice of God speaking to the inner man that Christ has saved the holy spirit so this Joshua of today is the Holy Spirit and he's the one putting you into place and giving gifts and operations but he's also the voice of God speaking in the Inner Man Amen brother man makes this statement an adoption and he's typing our adoption with Crossing Jordan and going into the promised land which was their land flowing with milk and honey all the promises were there and he says this he says in this Promised Land everything belongs to us in the promised land see it brother Colin see everything in the promised land when Israel crossed over the Jordan into the Promised Land fought down everything now remember in this promised land that don't mean that you're immune from sickness that don't mean that you're immune from troubles but it does spell this oh let this sink deep it says this that it's yours just rise and take it it doesn't mean that you're you're immune from sickness you're immune from trou what it means is everything God promised you is yours in this promised land under the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're a son you're coming to adoption amen it's yours just fight for it just take the authority they gave you and take the word and go fight for what's yours doesn't mean there's not trouble doesn't mean there's not sickness under adoption amen but what it does mean is you have been given the promised word for this hour amen and it can be on your lips it can be in your heart and be on your lips we can fight back and in in the adoption story when brother R's typing it with the natural now he shows now the tutors giving back a report to the father says after a while the years passed by father asked how's he getting along oh my he's even growing in Grace I'm telling you he's really why he takes them sheep can handle them just like you do I think to me this highlighted something for me that began to stand out the whole purpose of adoption was to get the son to be just like the father because the father it took the father to bring the estate to where it was yeah it took the thinking of the Father the the rules of the Father the temperament of the Father the character of the father it took the father to get to the state where it was the only way that he could turn that estate over to someone else is if they could come in the same thinking that he had it's the only way to EXC secure the State amen and now the the the Holy Ghost is saying he handles the she he's doing it just like you oh you should have seen him down there when he was selling that bunch of hay amen and how he barred he did it just the way you did it amen he handles the Sheep just the way you handle the Sheep he what's the goal what is our goal in adoption friends our goal is to come into the very image of Jesus Christ to be just like what he was on this Earth what was he he was somebody that was always about the father's business and kept all the word amen that's why for us we've been given a treasure Trove of the scriptures which is the mind of God the the the examples where God overcome and how he overcome and what character it took to overcome and so now when we're looking to overcome let's look to the scriptures amen and not use reasoning and find where did God overcome I want to overcome the way my father overcame I want to overcome by faith I want to overcome by the word I want to overcome by the promise I want to stand fast I want to believe and in spite of all the obstacles I want to stand flat-footed and believe the word of God cuz that's the example that I saw that's how we overcome and every other Overcomer he overcame that way that's what I want to be amen let's look to the word and let's be just like him I'm going to finish with this thought I just want to wrap up with this thought and I want to look at the prophet of God because I believe the prophet came to adoption amen I believe he's a wave sheath he's an example to us come to adoption and remember there's a positional placing you can be placed in a position in the family and then he can place you in another position in the family but the ultimate positioning is going to be the change of the body brother says then one day in Sabino Canyon while God called me early in the morning up there I was up with my hands in the air praying in a sword come into my hands you know I stood there and looked at it just natural as my hand is now not knowing what it meant and it was left me with a voice that said this is the sword of the king and then later when the angel of the Lord revealed it it was the word in the hand immediately after that the angel of the Lord appeared and told about the seven TR or the Seven Seals that I was to return back to Jeffersonville and preach the Sev seals what was taking place when that sword came into the prophet's hands it was brother Bram said it was the word in the hand so that sword there's only one sword it's the sword of the spirit which is the word of the Lord and he says it fit my hand listen how he said he he just fit my hand that means his hand was a perfect match to the sword amen amen do you remember how when Elijah threw his mantle over Elisha brother B said it didn't fit threw his mantle over Elisha but it didn't fit Elisha had some growing up to do and in following Elijah he would grow up until the place where when God took Elijah he would leave the mantle behind because now it was time for Elisha to wear this mantle and the years that he followed Elijah and the the time period there where he watched him and he learned and he grew he grew into the prophet's mantle brother brandham he went through a lot of things in life he was molded and he was shaped and he was tried and he was tested but when he gets down to the end of his ministry and the end of his life he comes to a place where when that sword is placed in his hand it's a perfect fit and that sword is the word that sword is the word of the Lord and the word of the Lord was given to the hand of a prophet and he says immediately after that them Angels appeared and said go back for the preaching of the Seven Seals what was placed in his hand it was the revelation of the Seven Seals God was going to place in that person's hands the great mystery of the seven Thunders that was sealed up amen and God had to work on him for how long to get him to this position where he could put him in the position of the seventh angel for Revelations 10:7 that was also the Fulfillment of the position of Malachi 4 because Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 are going to going to do two things they're going to reveal the mystery contained in the Seven Seals which literally turned the hearts of the children back to the fathers what was it going to take it was going to take that revelation of the seven Thunders when did it come not in the beginning of his ministry but after he'd been beat down he had been rejected they had walked away from him he had been all kinds of things that happened to him he had been betrayed he had been lied against he had had all kinds of he even had a government case against him right a tax case but now when he comes to this when God up in Sabino Canyon takes him up on a high place he drops a sword in his hand that was now a perfect fit he could trust this Prophet look at what he trusted him with friends he would go into a little room every day and every day an angel would appear and give him a vision a revelation of one of the seals and then he would write it down quickly and go chasing Through the Bible and all together and he would come out and he would say what was revealed to him in the little room now listen look what God entrusted him with God put in his hands the very word that was the Vindication of the end time and the Seven seal and the coming of the Lord and all of that the very the very Revelation that indicated all of this was true was placed in his hands and he trusted him that whatever he saw and heard in that room he would come out and say it just that way amen not add himself in not promote himself not try to become that he had he had to trust a man to take what was not written in the Bible amen the revelation of the seven Thunders which was sealed up to the end time and he had to trust a human being that he wouldn't inject himself and meddle with it and change it he had to come out and he had to put the word in his hand but he had molded that man's character with the word for decades to get him to this place Amen to where he would love the father's business and stay with the father's instructions God confirmed that he was the seventh angel by giving him the mystery of God my goodness brought him to an adoption positionally placed him as the seventh angel in Malachi 4 placed him in Revelation 10 placed him in Malachi 4 and he gave him such a responsibility but with responsibility came Authority so that was a demonstration to us because we know God is going to bring the church to adoption that's all of us friends all of us who remain alive all the way to the end they're we're coming to adoption the adoption of the church brother benam says this in the uh Church age book in the the laty in church age so when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in the last day there is there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sure the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is his own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her amen amen amen do you remember when Jesus was taken up on Mount Transfiguration and he was gloriously changed and he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him brother brandham showed us back then that that's coming to the [Applause] church she will be the final voice to the final age how under the prophet messenger shall be in subjection to the word he will confound her the the false Church through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come God has got to get a bride he's got to bring her to adoption question is whose responsibility is it it's his why because he predestinated it it was his plan from the beginning he's going to do it and all that he's doing now is working for that same purpose friends all that's happening in our lives all that he's revealing and all that he's working in and out of us through the circumstances of life is all for one goal to bring us to that adoption in order to have a bride that's that has the voice of God in her she has to be under a prophet Messengers meaning she's a bride who's subject to Authority what does she have to be she has to finally come to the place and I'm talking the global bride at the end time she has to finally come to the place where she loves the father's business amen more than anything else her greatest love is the father's business and she keeps his instructions if there's any goal for us if we leave with any goal let that be our goal that I love the father's business and I keep his instructions in Hebrews 11:39 he says this is at the end of the chapter of Faith Of The Heroes of Faith Hebrews 11 at the very end the last two verses he said and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect they can't complete they can't be complete until we become complete brother Brenham says in the Statue of a perfect man he says you get it those people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection that's right why do we got to come to Perfection to bring the resurrection because he can't bring the resurrection till he's brought the Capstone bride to adoption and then he can adopt the whole family amen this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and they're under Souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its Perfection that when Christ does come now he comes down here to Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he makes this statement and I'm going to I'm going to give you a declaration right now I don't completely understand the statement I'm just going to read it Christ is the mystery of guard reveal he says Satan said uh said oh no but she turned around and listened to him he's speaking of Eve in the Garden of Eden but the Eve in the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to do it she's been predestinated unto adoption yes sir God's going to do it he knows he'll have it he said his church would be there without spot or wrinkle she's going to stand there in the Splendor of him his word made manifest she'll be a token to the worldj how do we know that's absolutely nothing but the truth because he said that's the way it would be because he predestinated to be that way and he's going to work every circumstance around if he's got to squeeze us he'll squeeze us if he's got to train us he'll train us but he has promised that he will have he will present to himself a bride without spot or wrinkle or any blemish he will absolutely present to himself a Perfect Bride because he said he would in the book of Ephesians because the prophet of God came and confirmed it he is going to because he predestinated there's going to be an eve in the end time that will not fall just like he promised that there'd be a son who would not fail the way Adam failed and bought back the rights of redemption there's going to be a daughter amen there's going to be a bride of Christ who will not fall because she's been predestinated unto the time of adoption so I say God have your perfect work in me here's the statement that I don't fully understand now same message he said he's talking about James and jambre they withstood Moses they could do Miracles he could do Miracles they had a Ministry they could have a group but he says but their Folly will be made manifest when Jesus takes his bride and sets her up here and said this is her and the way he goes with her that's right and their Folly will be made man made known that looks like an adoption to me but I don't know how that will transpire I'm just confess you I don't know what that looks like to set her up here and say this was her and then away he goes with her it's a two-step process I don't know how it will work I don't know what it will look like but God's going to have that bride that he somehow will lift up hold up and say this is her amen he's going to I want to read one last scripture as we close let's read together to Romans chapter 8 musicians if you'll please come brother Ben if you can make your way up as well Romans chapter 8 verse 14 Romans chapter 8 verse1 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us you know it said it didn't say to us the glory that should be revealed in US us for the earnest expectation of the creature that's all creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God and it's not just us who are craving it all of creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature this creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected to same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption and to the Glorious Liberty of the children of godone for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why do he yet hope but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it praise God all of creation is waiting for this adoption for the manifestation of the sons of God for the change of their bodies and then it will set forth a cycle that'll bring a purging and restore back Christ and his kingdom on this Earth all of creation gr not only creation groan but we within ourselves are groaning for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our bodies we're still growing in adoption I say God help us let's all Stand Together amen I say God rub that iav in my eyes so I'm not confused by life circumstances but I understand it's all working together for your great purpose friends let's let's strive to go into the holy of holies where rain wind circumstances don't disrupt but where in the secret of his Pavilion he hides us amen upon a rock and though troubles all around there's a place of communion with Christ that brings such a satisfaction that I know everything's going to be okay and can we come to maturity and let the circumstances in our life not push us down but let the circumstances in our life push us up to bring us into this position of adoption he wants us to be in say God bless you all I'm so thankful for the word of God amen amen all lives would be such a confusion how can it be I've served God this long and it seems to be getting harder how can it be we've come so close to the end but it seems to be more difficult than because you're coming close to the end he's got to train us for patience everything is working together for that one purpose say praise be to God let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus I'm so thankful for your word God I'm so thankful you sent a prophet in our day who could peel back to mystery Lord we we'd be so confused if it wasn't for these truths Lord we'd be so distraught and discouraged by by life's trials we would miss the very blessing that's veiled in every trial we would miss Lord the very purpose that's behind every negative seemingly negative thing in our life Lord It's Your word that shows us it's positive not negative you're working un expected end you're bringing us Lord to to your desired position you have predestinated us to adoption according to the good pleasure of your will now Lord as you work your work in us and bring us to the Perfection that you've predestinated for this hour God help us to be focused on your kingdom God I pray that you'd put your love inside my heart that you'd fill me with a greater portion of your spirit may your life emanate out of me more than before may I be singularly focused on loving your business and keeping your instructions May the word that You' sent to us become everything to me Lord God forgive me for the distractions forgive me for everything else God that's my desire that's what I want and I know you're working things in my life to bring me to that place and God for every trouble that's troubled me I say thank you for every time I've been pushed down beat down rejected I say thank you because you've done it with a purpose in mind to bring me to a adoption I love you Lord I know that everything you do is perfect I know every plan you have is perfect and I know that you'll keep your promise you will present me to you the way you promised to present me to you I love you father I trust you help me to surrender to your hand God give us confidence in the places and positions you've put us in your body give us confidence to operate there with authority give us the confidence to take your word and to press back against the enemy give us confidence in everything you've done in us and everything you've placed us for everything you've taught us is not in vain and everything you worked in US was with a purpose may we start to take that word and push back against the enemy may we take our place as Sons and Daughters of God positionally placed in your body whether it's a finger a toe an ear or nose or mouth wherever we are Lord help us to take our our position and have faith in where you placed us and may that Faith give us power to overcome for it was shamgar in his position that defeated the Philistines God he was in position he was defending his family he was defending the land you gave him may we rise up amongst the shamgar who will stand when the enemy comes that will stand in our position and fight back Lord that you might have Victory through us we love you God we ask your blessing upon your people may we go from here encouraged with our eyes open may we go from here resolved and may patience let it have its perfect work in us as we patiently wait for you to finish your work that you promised to do we love you God bless us and help us I pray help us God we need that isav worse than ever God we need the we need the film that's on our eyes to be removed Lord we need to see the way you see we need to think the way you think we need your word Lord to be more than words on paper more more than audio on tape more than a man preaching behind a pull pit we need it to become the only reality we see we need it to become our correct vision Lord and we need everything else to be false help us God make the transition to where it's your word and your word only we love you father we know that's your purpose we know you're moving us into it we we believe you we trust you we declare that you are good and you do all things well
