[Music] no before we before we read our scripture i have an announcement to make brother franco if you can pull up on the overhead brother jeriah sister rebecca wholesale had their little baby girl and then on monday and so clarissa bell wholesale away man got to go meet her yesterday and she's beautiful and it was nice to get to see them they got home this afternoon but then i found out just short a short time ago that brother luke and sister ariel hatfield have had their little baby today amen so praise the lord two babies in one week amen this is a good week praise god so i don't have any details i know they had a little girl i believe her first name is vivian but i don't have any of the other details i'm pretty sure i know what her last name is but uh i don't have the rest of it but praise god that was exciting amen so god's been good you know we had it lined up we were going to have a baby every month from now till november but i mean now the perfect plan has been frazzled now we've got two in june so but praise god we're happy for ariel it's always better to go early than to go late amen so we're happy for her and luke and it's an exciting time so we can't wait for them to get into the assembly hopefully we have a picture to show you uh on sunday amen god is good we're thankful for these things these are these are things that we can rejoice in together the lord giving life like this to families and and we just pray that god will bless those families and bless those little lives amen so while we're standing let's turn to john chapter 13. brother bob was good to see you in service amen brother bob just had the opportunity to have doctors tell him that he's perfectly healthy praise god amen we love it when the doctors can find nothing when god so moves on the scene that there's no longer anything to be found and they is a good clean bill of health thank god for that amen john chapter 13 and let's read verse 1. now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world and to the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel where with he was girded men god bless you as you're seated may the lord bless his word amen keep your finger on the scripture i want to look at this again but i also want to say that many of you know and are aware that there was an accident sunday night for thomas sproles jr and his family were driving home from the wedding from the mcdivitt wedding sunday night and they were in an accident and thomas sproles jr lost his life in that accident so i know many of you are already aware of that but it's yet another difficult situation for the assembly there at true word and and we know that god is in all things and i expect to hear testimonies even from this but we know it's been a difficult time for the assembly there for the believers in that church after losing the collins and having that funeral and so it's not been an easy time so we want to remember them in prayer i know that there was a gofundme page set up for the family and then they're going to have some needs some expenses for the funeral they want to cover and also a vehicle because now the grandparents are going to take the children into the home and thomas's wife and they're just there's some needs there so if you could get that information from somebody i know several here already have it and that gofundme page and help out with that we don't have any details as yet for the funeral service or memorial service or how they're going to do that but when we do we'll we'll get the word out and let everybody know but i just really want to stand together with our brothers and sisters in prayer and hold them up in prayer and ask that god would bless that family bless those children and their wife and the grandparents and the entire assembly amen there's it's hard to understand and hard to explain but god knows what he's doing there were testimonies that came out of what some would call a tragedy god knew to us it's a tragedy to god it's a plan and the same thing i believe will be true that we'll hear testimonies come forth that what is to us a tragedy to god is a plan and god knows what he's doing so let's just remember them in prayer as an assembly and and stand by them and if there's anything that we as an assembly can do to help i would love to be of help so we'll just stay in touch and see if there's anything if there's something comes up that we can be helpful with we'll get the word out and see if we can do something to help them out amen so remember to be in prayer amen for tonight i'd like to go back and look at this scripture again while we've got our bibles opening on this page and i want to talk about a revelation that holds and we know that the world is not getting more stable is that right i mean how many beliefs is becoming more stable things are becoming less stable all the time we thought covert would be a cycle and that cycle would come and go and and for the most part it seems like it's tapered off and it's going away but right on the heels of that is something else and something else and something else and i think we're just in the cycle of destruction which brother branham said started the judgment began on the west coast that judgment is still rolling on throughout this world they rejected a prophet they rejected the word of god amen and there's no there's nothing else that can come but this cycle of judgment is is is and the birth pains are increasing in intensity and in frequency amen so as we see amen the end drawing nigh we've been believing that i've been believing that for the majority of my life i mean since we come into the message 20 some years ago i thought that i barely slipped in i slid under the wire right before the thing shut down and here we are 20 years later so we've been seeing the cycles as the cycles increases as things get worse but we can definitely see an uptick amen the world is in chaos things are uncertain and they may get much much worse we don't know but yet there's a revelation that holds us in every hour through every circumstance in our lives both in as individuals as families as churches as the bride as a whole there's a revelation that has to hold us because as we're here for the wrapping up of all things as civilization crumbles in this earth groans and travail ready to bring forth a bright new millennium we're not expecting things to get better but they must get worse amen the contractions must get harder the birth planes must be get more intense and the frequency must come closer together everything else must continue to fall apart amen because everything has to completely fall apart amen so christ can come and set up his kingdom every kingdom has to be destroyed amen so we don't expect large improvements amen we but what we expect is to see things continue to become chaotic but praise god there's a revelation that holds amen the one thing that we don't know is we look at we know things the prophet said we've been looking at them for years we know that between where we stand now and the change in our bodies we know several statements that the prophet made things that must transpire and must take place but what it will exactly look like and and how intense things will be to us as individuals or certain individuals and what exactly how exactly this is going to manifest there's question marks we don't know i mean we don't know how quickly these things will unfold how long that it will take we don't know how intense things will get but praise be to god we know one thing for sure that we are his bride that he has his eye on us amen he will not lose a one for we are in in his hand amen so there's a revelation that holds and here we see jesus he's coming to the point of crucifixion he's coming to in many ways he's coming to the climax of his purpose of coming in flesh the first time and that was to pay the price of redemption for all of the elect of gone and so now he's coming down to what looks like a terrible time but yet it's a great time amen it looks like it's going to be horrible but yet it's going to be wonderful because the scripture says concerning god it pleased him to bruise him and you look at this scripture and it says it pleased him to bruise him and and sometimes it doesn't compute in our minds but god is always looking at something so much bigger he is not like us his thoughts are so much higher than our thoughts we we would come like the disciples we would be with if we didn't have the understanding we have now on the day of calvary we would be exactly like the disciples we would be distraught we would be destroyed we would think all is lost that this is the worst thing that's ever happened to us not knowing that it was the best thing that ever happened to them it was by and far the greatest thing that could ever happen to them but at the moment they thought it was the worst thing that could ever happen to them amen so jesus now is moving to this and we know by the scriptures he knows what's coming and and verse 1 says now before the feast of passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world and to the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end supper being ended then the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from god and he went to god so jesus had a revelation of who he was he comes to this part knowing that he must depart out of this world and to the father knowing now he spoke to simon he told him do what thou must do so judas judas son of simon he took off everything was set in motion amen and he knew that he come from god look it says jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god so we see now jesus coming to the crucifixion he had a perfect understanding of who he was he knew who he was he knew god had given all things into his hands he knew he come from god he knew he was going to god he knew that this was the hour's departure he knew all things amen and there was a revelation amen that was going to keep him through dark hours let's turn to luke chapter 18. luke chapter 18. and verse 31 luke 18 31 then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully and treated and spitted on and they shall scourge him and put him to death in the third day he shall rise again so you think jesus knew what was going to happen to him i think he had a pretty good indication of what was going to happen to him verse 34 and they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken that's an amazing this is a verse 34 is an amazing scripture to me because when we read verse 31 through verse 33 it's plain english there's no mincing words he's not speaking in types he's telling them plainly what's going to happen to them and it was as if he spoke nothing amen they understood not amen none of these things they understood none of these things and the saying was hid from them neither knew they things which were spoken it was as if he didn't say anything like it completely they completely missed it amen and and you know for years that has been sections of the message for you and i yeah we've been listening to tapes amen for some of you have been listening to tapes for 40 50 years amen you've been reading books amen and listening to the prophet's message amen but some parts of it was as if you you understood none of it as if nothing had even been spoken amen and then all of a sudden you go back through and you read that and you're like where did that come from amen then you i mean if i don't know if you're like me i'll read something and go whoa then i'll flip it over to read the cover and to see if i've read this message before and i've read it before amen like i've read it a lot but praise be to god amen god has a way of holding things back until the time amen god can close eyes god can open eyes in fact god is the only one who can open eyes we come to this earth with closed eyes amen he's the only one that can open our eyes and here he's speaking to his disciples plainly what is going to happen and i'd like to say the prophet of god has spoken plainly to us what is going to happen amen but but maybe we're still missing parts i mean we would be foolish to say you know we missed some things before but we got it all now the fact that we missed things before amen should lead us to believe that there's a possibility we could be missing things now right that's the logical way to think amen but somehow we're so self-deluded that we think no no no no i mean there were some things yeah there were some things i missed but i caught those now now i got it all right god help us god help us to stay humble brother madam when he comes to the seventh seal amen he says now don't try to figure anything out just live a state he said don't interpret anything just live a simple humble christian life and if he wants you to know anything he'll reveal it to you how easy that is but boy if there's anything that we've ever messed up it was those instructions amen if there's anything we as a people have have failed on it was to do exactly what he said but but brother branham said he goes you're not getting it you're not supposed to get it he knew somehow he knew that it wasn't going to be these people sitting here maybe some of them but as a whole amen that the revelation of this was coming lord that was coming down the pike things were going to open and be revealed and if he wants you to know anything he'll reveal it to you and when he reveals it to you it's plain it's simple it stands out it's absolute it's not this uh it's not this spooky hocus pocus putting odd things together and and maybe it fits no when god reveals something he reveals it you got it you see it and he told us not to do this odd piecing things together and make this complicated way of the word coming to pass and this fits and the thunders are this and this and that no he said just live a simple humble christian life if he wants you to know anything he'll reveal it to you and i say he has done that for his friends he has absolutely revealed things in that word that we never saw before amen and we read it but we didn't see it amen we read it but it wasn't open just like the disciples heard jesus here in luke 18. they he told him plainly but it was as if they he didn't speak i mean they didn't hear anything and we were told plainly what the third pool was plainly what the thunders were but it was as if we didn't hear it remember when when the time came god begins to open it amen and he doesn't open it to everybody at the same time i know some saw it long before others but but praise god when god wanted to open it he opened it amen and he still has that ability so it's not for us to get nervous not to try to figure something out but also we have to be careful that we don't allow our ignorance on a subject to cause us to fear to cause us to doubt just because we don't understand it or don't see it or don't know how this fits into the picture amen things come amen and they happen and maybe we don't know how this fits into what brother venom said we have a an event or something transpires in our life or in a church or in the world and we don't know exactly how to place it amen we've got to be careful that we don't start trying to shove it into spots where it doesn't fit we've got to be very careful we don't start saying drawing conclusions and say well this is that and this is this because that's what's happened with every major conflict in crisis since the prophet left the scene have you been around for a while the gulf war was the rise of babylon crossing the the great river to go and destroy israel it was the beginning of of armageddon did anybody hear that one back in the 90s and we found out it wasn't is that right don't try to figure anything out if god wants to reveal anything he'll reveal it it's not trying to piece things and figure things out and just live a simple humble christian life and the thing that god gives you he will give you at a time to build faith in you to go through whatever you need to go through but when we see things happen we don't know exactly where to fit them and we don't know exactly where to place them then it's time to leave it alone but don't let that don't let our ignorance cause doubt or a fear or a scare i mean sometimes i think there's a temptation to figure this out amen to figure it out so it will bring some level of security for us and the message and blah blah blah my security isn't that i was known by god before the foundation of the world amen and nothing will change that security a true revelation will bring a security that will not that that doesn't have me needing to interpret modern events amen to bring security i already have security there's nothing that can change that security what's happening brother chad i don't know it's birth pains what will happen next more birth pains [Laughter] amen amen but there's going to god is giving a revelation that will hold us through it all amen an understanding that no matter what happens amen we will we will know amen that we are his and that all is under control all is fine and i tell you there's still a lot of material in the message there's still a lot of things in there to be discovered friends there's still a lot that god can unfold amen because it's the word that's why amen how many believe you've come to the end of understanding of your bible i'm glad you didn't raise your hand the bible is the word the message is the word we haven't come to the end of it yet thank god so whatever we have need of the word is there it's in the word and god will reveal it as we have need of it so here he tells them plainly but they understood none of these things and neither knew they the things which were spoken and and god had told them later they could go back and say he told us this amen and it would bring him understanding but jesus himself he had a revelation of who he was now the revelation of who he was was going to have to carry him through amen some difficult times in the message adoption from 1960 brother brahm says when he last cried eli eli my god my god that was a man why hast thou forsaken me speaking of jesus he said in the garden of gethsemane the anointing left him you know he had to die as a sinner he died a sinner you know that not his sins but mine and yours that's where that love came in how he took mine oh hallelujah how he took mine amen let's look at john 19 together let's go back to the book of john and look at john chapter 19. then i'm going to get back to this thought john chapter 19 verse 9. john chapter 19 verse 9 and when again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus whence art thou but jesus gave him no answer then said pilate and him speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee and i have power to release thee jesus answered thou could have us no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin this is an answer from somebody who's confident and who they are he's been captured he's been arrested he's been taken he's been he's been through one trial already uh in caiaphas house he's been beaten he's been carried off and delivered to the romans he everybody who swore they would stay with him has left him he's all alone nobody to send him nobody to stand with him he's in the hands of enemies amen he's standing before pilate and pilate is asking him to defend himself and he won't say anything he's asking him questions he won't answer amen because he already knows what needs to happen he doesn't need to get himself out of this situation this is the situation he was ordained for he doesn't need to bypass this amen he already wrestled that out in gethsemane with the with the human side he was wrestling out lord is there another way amen and when he when god would show him no other way he already surrendered and yielded to god's way and he already knew it was god's way he had already spoken luke 18 what was going to happen he already knew he was going to be turned over he was going to be scourged he was going to be spitted upon and crucified he already knew that he was going to be killed amen but in the garden of gethsemane he begins to ask god is there any other way amen and god is allowing us to see that when he came in human flesh he came in human flesh amen to feel amen what we would feel and he begins to wrestle this out with his own will and saying god is there any other way and when no other way was present he yielded to the way that he knew was the only way and he said not my will but thy will be done and when he surrendered to god's way now he's in the channel now amen he's being swept into the fulfillment of prophecy and they come and they arrest him and they scourge him and they do all of these things and he's standing before pilate and he knows what his father wants he knows he's in the will of god he know that all things are in his hand that he he told peter he says no you not that i could call for legions of angels to deliver me but he wouldn't do it because he knew it wasn't the will of god he had the power to do it but he had not been given permission by god to do it see to me this is this is real power with character that's fit to rule he had the power to call for legions of angels to deliver him but he had the character to stay with the [Applause] [Music] the word told him there's no other way he wasn't going to exercise any of his power or authority to bring another way even though all things had already been delivered into his hands and so he's going he's following after the word and he's a and he's in obedience to his father and now instead of answering there's nothing for him to answer because he is he defendable yes is he innocent yes could he give a good testimony absolutely could he unravel the trial without question without question he's not guilty he could defend himself he he has a right to answer for himself because he's done nothing wrong amen but he forfeits his right to take the will of god and he stands there in silence because he doesn't want to change the outcome because the outcome is god's will i said god help me to grow into this kind of character to where i want your his will and his word more than i want anything else in my life [Music] and so he he says you know why won't you answer don't you know now pada says don't you know i have the power he doesn't even know who he's talking to you know i have the power to say the i have the power to crucify thee and he says you have no power unless it was given to you from above and then he pronounces his own judgment the one who delivered to me to you is in greater sin than you because the judge was on the scene and he knew what was happening so jesus had a revelation that would hold him he wasn't looking for a way out wasn't looking to be rescued he was willing to walk every step god wanted him to walk in the message it is the rising of the sun he says now notice this quickening power zoe bring the word the mind that was in christ was in you then i'm trying to show you that when you raised when god raised jesus from the dead he raised up you also and also quickened the life with him you are now quickened to life although then you were but an attribute in his thoughts but god had saw all in him at the finish see when god looked down upon the body the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was god god anointed that flesh which was human flesh and he didn't if he had went up there as god he'd have never died that kind of death can't kill god but he didn't have to do it jesus chose the will of god but remember he went there with you in him see god had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body see they are one same same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the bride so now he's going to tie the the bride in here she was with him when he went to calvary amen and he held his peace and didn't say anything because he had to pay the price of redemption amen and he was not alone he was the fullness of the word so all the attributes all the thoughts of god was wrapped up in that body of flesh which means there's a portion of that's in you today that was there then [Music] and i'm standing here today so glad he yielded so glad he didn't speak so glad that he took it amen and didn't try to maneuver a way out and didn't use the power of gifts that were in his hands but he submitted himself to the will of the father because i was there amen and i do not have to go through tribulation because he endured tribulation for me i do not have to shed my blood in tribulation like the foolish version of 144 thousand because i already paid for my sins when i was with him at calvary [Applause] so i get to bypass that in the flesh because i was there in that flesh i'm so glad he was yielded i'm so glad he was obedient i'm so glad he was surrendered amen amen but the very fact that we were there makes it possible for us to endure now jesus went there with a tremendous revelation of who he was he knew that all things were given to him by god all things were in his hands and he came from god and he went to god i'm telling you that's a tremendous revelation and if we can catch that same revelation we can endure anything amen let's turn to ephesians chapter one i want to take our time and go through a few scriptures here together ephesians chapter 1 see we see all through the scriptures really if we take the scriptures as our textbook for life how many believe we should take the bible as our textbook for life god never came to bring a revelation to a people to give them so much peace that they entered into frolic and play where do you see it in the scriptures but god always brings a revelation to the people at a time that they need a revelation to go through his plan and through his will they have to pass through difficult waters and go through difficult things amen and god gives them a revelation that will sustain them amen and let's look at ephesians chapter one verse three said blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both with both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ so we have been predestinated amen god has elected us and chosen us before the foundation of the world according to the good pleasure of his will for his purpose amen that's why everyone was elected that's why we were predestinated for his purpose not for ours but for his amen in in the message israel in the church from 1953 he says now before you can become a christian god called you not you calling god god called you now he called abraham and he's the father of us all the faith notice now he said abraham now now it's election i want to get on that election strong because it's the truth now you didn't you didn't become a christian just coincidence because you became a christian before you was in this world what you became a christian before you was in this world before you was born as a baby you were ordained to be a christian before you were born god ordained you to be a christian from the garden of eden from before the foundation of the world all you say is that right brother that's the truth god before there was ever you knowed anything there was a time that you knew now listen what he's saying before you knew anything he before you knew anything god called you to be a christian from the garden of eden before the foundation of the world god ordained you to be a christian now listen he says there was a time that you knew your mind is darkened to that now there's only been one man on the earth that knew that he was before and that was jesus he said glorify me father with the glory that i had with you before the foundation of the world he was the incarnate god he could move back there and know what it was but our minds are blackened there but we were ordained predestinated you know what predestination means the destination of anything was pre-sold by god amen that's not skilled milk now notice i believe that stumped you we better go over there just a minute turn over with me to ephesians the first chapter and let's just read just a little because i'm afraid you're missing that and just think that that i'm saying that i'm not listen closely now we get down to the church in a few minutes a few moments or after a bit now paul is speaking addressing ephesians 1 directly straight to the shoulder to the church that's what we're doing tonight this is not for babies this is for grown-ups not for babies little babies i got a little one back there just learning to walk he'd boop and fall down and get back up and he thought he was doing something great i was that way one day but now i'm a man i'll put away childish things now we got to come to full doctrine i like good old shout meetings where we just clap our hands and shout and have a good time have great powerful services and things dance on the bubble as it were but wait then when the showdown time comes you don't know where you're standing let's get back and find out let's find out what's making us do that let's get back to the foundation see where we're at paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and he's reading right now the beginning of ephesians he goes i just love that no seminary sent me out the will of god to them which are at ephesus now watch he addresses it to the faithful in jesus christ watch addressing it straight to who not to center not to babies but to them that's grown up you see god never asked paul if he wanted to be the first church age messenger you remember when brother abraham was here he was talking about brother branham being a victim amen he said leave the man alone he's a victim because abraham never asked to be the father of faith abraham wasn't praying and said god make me the father of faith god choose me and bring a nation out of my life and abraham never prayed that it wasn't in abraham's mind it wasn't abraham's desire it was the will of god that came down and called abraham and told him to come and separate from his people it wasn't it wasn't abraham's idea and you can see abraham didn't even want to separate from his people it wasn't like abraham was sick of his country and wanted to get out of here and say god can i leave and god comes down and says yes abraham took his father along and took lot along amen and we understand the story but abraham didn't pick himself god chose abraham from before the foundation of the world amen david never asked to be a king amen david i mean we don't know what david's ambitions were in life i mean he was just a young lad keeping his father's sheep amen tending the sheep worshiping god on the backside of the desert i don't know what his dreams or ambitions were i mean i don't know what if he wanted to keep tending sheep inherit his father's inheritance get married live in bethlehem who knows what he wanted amen but it didn't matter what he wanted what mattered is what god wanted for him amen and he sent a prophet one day to say you're the next anointed king over israel without asking him if he wanted to do it or not [Music] god never asked brother abra brother branham if he wanted to be the seventh angel would you like to be the seventh angel no he never asked him he just called him that's what he was amen and god called him and ordained him and anointed him for such a work and let him amen and he never asked you if you wanted to be bride right no matter how much we want to be the bride of jesus christ our great desire what gratitude we have amen it was never originated with our idea it originated with god and god designed it this way god ordained it this way god called you you didn't call yourself you never asked to be the bride he called you bride amen and so when we come to this understanding it brings us this revelation brings us a strength amen i wasn't my idea to be bright it was god's idea i didn't call myself to this he called me to this and when you come to that understanding there's a revelation that settles in amen and whatever god wants me to do to portray my portion of the bride of jesus christ then that's what we'll do amen because he ordained it before the foundation of the world nothing can stop that expression and i don't want to alter it in any way so you see the elect predestinated c gene of god are different others might get to choose those who come at the white throne judgment they may choose to do good and choose to align with it but you didn't get the pick he chose before the foundation of the world is that right in the message adoption 1960 he said so beautifully displayed in the prodigal son i was lost this is my son he was lost and now he's found he was dead and he's alive again bring forth the fatted calf and the best robe a ring and put it on his finger no wonder when the morning stars sing together and the sons of god shout her for joy when they seen the plan of salvation god putting your name on the book before the foundation of the world amen brother branham said you knew once but you're darkened to that now is that right and he said no wonder and he's typing it with the prodigal son returning no wonder when the morning stars staying together and the sons of god shouted for joy when they seen the plan of salvation so that means before the foundation of the world they seen the plan of salvation was god putting your name on the book before the foundation of the world and it caused a shouting and it caused a rejoicing is that right let's look at a couple more quotes 1955 beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation see we come out of eternity we was before there was a world did you know that god made man in his own image where was you he said to job when job thought he had some wisdom he said where was you when i laid the foundation of the world before i laid it when the sons of god sang together and the morning started shout out for joy the morning star shouted for joy them shining ones listen to this them shining ones shouted for joy when they seen that someday they would tabernacle here on earth what a quote them shining one shouted for joy when they seen that someday they would tabernacle here on earth and the king melchizedek would come in the righteousness of god and give his life to redeem us to god back again and outshine the stars forever and ever amen brother madam is in 1960s and preaching the rejected king and he was in the hospital for some tests and the nurses speaking to him and and she asked him a question about a denomination and here's what he said i said oh i belong to the oldest denomination there is. and she said what denomination is that i said it's the one that was organized before the world was ever organized oh she said what i don't believe i know just that she said i belong to a certain church is that is it that organization i said no ma'am that was only about 200 years ago that organized but this organization started when the morning star sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy when they seen the coming of a savior to redeem mankind amen are you part of that organization hallelujah the oldest one that was organized before the world was organized amen that's the one brother ben said he was a part of that's the one the true elector a part of amen amen let's look at romans chapter 8. romans chapter 8 verse 28. romans 8 28 we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called then he also justified whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called that little v is so important in that scripture to them that are the called according to his purpose we are the called but remember we're the called according to his purpose and we're here to fulfill his purpose not our purpose his purpose and and i'd like to just say this say this we have no right to complain we have no reason to fuss about circumstances in our lives no right to complain about things that are happening oh we're guilty of it i'm guilty of it i i'm ashamed of myself sometimes how quickly i start spouting off at the mouth and have to go back and say god forgive me for that amen so we're guilty but we need to come to a higher revelation amen we need to climb just a little bit higher and say god ordained my life before the foundation of the world and god already showed a movie and i already watched the movie is that true god showed the plan of salvation amen the sons of god shouted for joy when they solved the plan of salvation are you a son of god i mean that means at some point he showed you the plan of salvation and you rejoiced and shouted over you thought it was a great plan praise god that's wonderful that's exactly perfect it's just right amen so now we come into the world in spiritual amnesia that part is blocked off to us we don't remember that amen so now we're down here crying why are you crying you already watched the movie you already said that's a good plan that's the right way to do it i agree praise god wonderful hallelujah and down here we're going why is this happening to me amen amen we need the revelation that's been given in this hour no church age ever knew this amen they never been given what we've been given amen they never realized to what extent we're predestinated they've never realized what god had done before amen and where we were before and how we've come to this amen and that's not just uh to tickle our ears that's not to give us something exciting to talk about or a point of differentiation to differentiate us between the denomination that was given to us to give us a higher revelation to live a higher life amen just like jesus was given a clear understanding of who he was amen he was given a clear revelation of who he was and what god's plan was and what purpose he was fulfilling so that when the time got tough he could just surrender and move right in with god's plan never speaking back to pilate never answering for himself never accusing those who are accusing him but just walking in submission to the plan of god a higher revelation held him through it all and there's a reason we've been given so much in this day not so that we can complain not so that we can uh run to and fro every time circumstances get tough so we could settle down and say i don't know what's happening but i know it's in the plan of god i know it's for his purpose and i know that i was happy about this at some point [Music] amen when god first revealed to me the plan of salvation when i was an attribute in his mind i said good plan father so now i don't want to say anything different in the message spiritual amnesia from 1964 brother branham says now to be a true christian you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was i'm identified with him i'm identified with him notice and he is in me and i in him notice then every christian that's a real genuine christian was with him when the morning star sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy were you are you a real christian let's read this again every christian that's a real genuine christian was with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy before there was a foundation in the world we were identified in the immortal realms with god 10 million years before the world was ever formed i was back there with him if i got eternal life i was there with him i was identified with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy amen brother branham brings it on down the line and says i was with him when abraham was manifesting i was with him when jacob he goes through all the characters of the bible and joseph and all of that and moses then he comes out and says what every christian has been what every believer has been every believer now is identified with the same person so when the word was coming through the bible is a record of the word of god coming into manifestation through the lives of people when it was in moses i was there because i'm part of the word that was the word all right i'm identified with that because that was word and i'm word so what are the words in the book the believers what is the book the record of christ what are the words in the book the believers so it's one book and i'm part of that book so if you flip to the to the beginning of the book and you say there's moses it's the same book that i am amen we're the we're in the same thing together hallelujah amen he says i'm identified with that same person whatever it is you must be identified don't forget that when you do you've got spiritual amnesia you've forgotten who you are amen we start going through trials and tribulations amen that's been out of this book before amen you can say the word that's in me amen this word that i'm a part of has already conquered this already conquered it in moses already conquered into three hebrew children already conquered it here and conquered it there conquered it there i'm part of that same word the word has already overcome this there's nothing for me to worry about i can look at the book and i'm identified with that victory so today there's nothing different there's no problem amen amen praise be to god and if we forget that then we got spiritual amnesia we forgot who you are sometimes i'm surprised in me at the lingering effects of amnesia i get surprised at my own self how on sunday we remember it all right during the preaching of the word when brother was laying it out you were in god before the foundation of the world you're a part of god you can no more be lost and god can be god and you're amen hallelujah you sound just like you did before the foundation of the world when he showed you the plan of salvation and then monday morning you go to start the card it won't start and you forgot you're a son of god and you forgot you're in the mind of god and you forgot all things work together for good i hope i'm not the only one because i'm this is very exposing if i'm the only one and all of a sudden we we slip right as soon as it goes click click spiritual amnesia creeps right back in the lingering effects of spiritual amnesia instead of allowing a higher revelation to stop and say god's doing something it's all under control i don't have to fret it's going to be okay and and you know what you don't even have to be a son of god to know it's going to be okay the battery's dead or starters i mean it's going to be fine it's good don't worry it's going to be okay but how quickly we slip in to you know grumbling complaining moaning and groaning and and we went from having the most wonderful existence on this earth on sunday to now our life is miserable nothing ever works out for me and but sunday you were a son of god and then the whole thing plan was orchestrated for you amen and now your car won't start or somebody else got the promotion or there's going to be a layoff and your life never works out it works out for everybody else never works out for me and why doesn't god like me and i said we got to have a higher revelation amen the word that came in this day was to bring us higher than that amen it was to bring us out of that if we can't take that how are we going to take squeeze pressure things binding or tying up or our brother bam said they'll close your churches amen and they'll prevent the ministers from preaching when i don't know how i don't know for how long i don't know i mean what will we see what we don't see i don't know but how will we ever endure that if we can't take all these little things in our life and cause us to come down from a higher revelation back to carnal thinking back to being troubled and bound by the things of the world amen this message has been given to us was for the eagles to fly higher and in the higher realm all of a sudden everything in the carnal starts coming into perspective and so we have the message to lift us above this amen we've got the word of god to give us a vantage point that the rest of the world doesn't have so that we don't forget who we are so that the lingering effects of spiritual amnesia don't creep back in with every trial in every circumstance so that we can stay sons of god all the time so let's look at john 15 together i just want to reinforce this idea of the sons of god shouting for joy seeing the plan of salvation this is why there's nothing i'm telling you today you haven't heard before but this is why we'll preach this over and over and over again because we've got to fly higher we've got to break out of the cardinal we've got to get past our flesh we've got to start seeing things the way the message paints them for us john 15 26 but when the comforters come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and he also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning the question is what beginning hallelujah brother branham says in the message serpent seed from 1958 dear god the great and mighty god who formed all things by the power of his spirit and has brought jesus christ his only begotten son who freely died for sinners the just for the unjust to reconcile us back unto his marvelous fellowship that we have again with god as we are taught in the blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world so brother said we're taught in this blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world where did jesus say that you have been with me from the beginning he tells him you'll be witnesses because you've been with me from the beginning i want to ask you why are you a witness today amen i think for the same reason it says as we are taught in the blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain that when god in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our salvation through jesus praise be to god later in the same message he says further down he says he never said he'd done it in the shadow he potentially done it the bible said he paid tithes amen he's talking now about levi paying tithes and abraham then if we come through the right seat when paul preached the gospel i was there and you were there is that right maybe that's why we can believe paul's gospel when others have rejected it we're going to get into that just in a minute plumb up to our ears notice that's what the scripture claims to us it even went way back just think levi then jacob his father than isaac his father then abraham his father his great-grandfather when levi was in the loins of his great-grandfather he paid ties to melchizedek i want to ask you who is this job 27 38 when he said where was you when i laid the foundation of the earth when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy who were those sons of god that was shouting for joy jesus told them that i had joy with you before the foundation of the world we're not creatures of time we're creatures of eternity no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that comes to me i'll give him them eternal life and raise him up at the last days no one can pluck them from my father's hand he gives them to me how are you going to lose see you're scared you're afraid you'll run around and that's one of the best evidences in the world that you haven't been nowhere yet that's right when you get scared you get afraid and you run around that's the best evidence in the world that you haven't been nowhere yet i said god take me a little further than what i've been go to john chapter 6. verse 44. it's amazing how the message came to reveal the bible now we have to allow the message to teach us the bible because if we don't let the message teach us the bible we're still letting the baptist teach us the bible we have to be careful or we're still letting the pentecostals teach us the bible or we're still letting the methodist teach us the bible because remember they they in each in each of those uh ages they would get another glimpse of light another nugget but everything else was still obscure they would get one truth amen and that truth would break them into another revival amen and bring them higher in the things of god but we have to stop reading the bible with the baptist understanding or a pentecost or a methodist understanding of the bible and we've got to allow the message to teach us the bible and that's why it's so foolish for somebody to try to use the message or the bible to correct brother branham it's it's ludicrous in ways because god sent the message to teach us the bible to illuminate the word to show us what's been hiding in this word for thousands of years he brought up he brought a prophet to be an interpreter of the word to show us even brother branham would tell us in his day the contemporaries were saying brother ben was a good man he has a good gift amen we believe he's a prophet of god and he says when he's and when he's discerning and he's praying for the sick you can go but when he starts teaching leave because he's off the word and brother man said you don't even know you don't even know what a prophet is you don't even know what i'm here for so we we have to we have to let the we have to let the prophet of god the message of the hour give us the correct interpretation of the word because if not we won't understand what brother brahm's saying he makes these statements and we don't understand what he's saying because every time we read the word our mind is adjusted to a formal understanding of what we're reading and we have to let the message keep breaking that away from us john chapter 6 verse 44. no man can come to me except the father which has sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me don't read that like a baptist let's read verse 45 again it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard already heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me so you cannot come to jesus unless you've already been taught of the father and you've already heard the father and been taught of the father if you haven't previously heard from god and been taught by the father you don't come to jesus is that what the bible says we're not changing the words we're reading exactly what's written amen not that any man hath seen the father because you never saw him as a man in your flesh body not that any man has seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father so if you're of god you've seen the father let's turn quickly over to first john chapter 4. first john chapter 4. first john chapter 4 verse 4 ye are of god little children this is the same john who wrote the gospel of john is that right and he said ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world the heir of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god hereth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error so john the apostle john says year of god little children said we are of god back in the gospel of john of john when he's recording jesus he says those who are of god have seen the father let's go back to john chapter 6 and read that again one time john chapter 6 verse 46. not that any man has seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father john said you are of god little children are you of god then you've seen the father amen and you have heard from him and been taught by him when i don't know maybe when he showed the movie in heaven maybe when i watched the plan of salvation unfold in a mysterious way how i don't know i don't think it was a projector in a big screen i mean we're not carnal i don't know how but but god alone with his attributes amen began to show his plan of salvation and the sons of god begin to shout for joy amen the mechanics of how that happened i don't even care all i know is i was there i saw it i heard from the father i've been taught father father i'm of god amen and that is why i could come to jesus amen because i've been taught of the father because this message didn't come to quicken your mind to quicken your body to quicken your human spirit it came to quicken the seed that was in the soul amen and that seed is part of god it's more than these ears it's more than this mind it's that part of god that god is calling back to himself he said in the message god who is rich in mercy now we are a part of god you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in god you were only in this thinking your very name if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of god see you always were the sons of god see so who was shouting in glory before the sons of god and you always were the sons of god see for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there well then he before he even became material here on earth before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he knowed the color hair you would have he knowed all about you in 1965 the rising of the sun he says no wonder he said fear not for now notice we are redeemed by him and now risen with him that's what easter means to the people risen with him notice now we have his spirit in us the abstract title the abstract deed fully paid no you don't say well i hope i make it you've already made it not i will make it i've already made it there's not i'm going to make it you're that you've already made it i mean that that's a given amen i'm gonna make it and you know brother chad i'm gonna make it if you're ever going to make it you already made it you made it before you started i like this kind of race the one that's already determined you're a medal winner before you run amen then he goes on to say i've already made it i never made it he made it for me so then it was absent from my effort it was void of my determination and will he already made it for me without my perseverance he already made it for me so how do i think that by my will and my perseverance and my trying harder that i will attain to anything no he already did it for me he made it for me not me him well brother branham i don't care what they say there he made it for me that's all i want all i'm caring about i just want to see him manifested how can you do it call him down no he's in you he's in you well then lord if i can get myself out of the way you can manifest so now all this effort in achieving all this effort and and and running harder listen he's already made it for us amen but brother man said i just want to see you manifest how will you do it call him down no he's in you what you're going to do is move out of the way and give him preference relax your thinking move your will aside your plans and your ambitions separate from them and let he who is already in you come and manifest himself through you i want to look at just a one or two more scriptures but let's turn to luke 22 real quickly because i want to i don't want to stop until i lay this in luke 22 and verse 31. this is really important at least in my heart right now luke 22 31 and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not how many times did peter look back on the incidents of his life at this stage he didn't know what was going to happen next he had no inkling that he would deny the lord that he would run away and abandon him and leave him in curse as he tried to prove that he didn't know even know him but how many times would he look back and say i'm so glad he prayed for me it was his prayer that kept me it was jesus doing amen he said amen but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren and he said in them lord i am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death. and he said i tell thee peter the shall not crow this day before that thou shalt thrist deny that thou knowest me peter could never in himself imagine denying the lord he believed he was ready to die he was ready to go to prison he was ready and we know that peter had a revelation of who jesus christ is a revelation not from his intellect but a revelation given to him by the father that he knew he was the son of the living god that he was christ the son of the living god and so he had a revelation of who jesus was and jesus you know is telling him you're going to be sifted satan has desired a city but i've prayed for you that your faith failed not that you don't lose faith and and peter says you know it's okay i'm going to i'll give all for you and just a short time after this he's running away cursing and claiming that he never knew him thank god that he prayed in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed he says the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that grouped together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is what is it a revelation knowing what it is see peter knew who jesus was but peter didn't yet know who he was when peter gets to this place peter has a revelation of who jesus christ is but peter yet does not have the revelation of who he is because peter is still in arguments with the disciples wondering who's going to be the greatest in the kingdom and you know even the the mother of james and john come to jesus and say oh lord will will you answer my request and he said what's your request well my sons one sit on your right hand and one on your left he says it's not for me to give but for my father to give and you can see that they don't even yet know who they are they don't understand the plan of god amen they've got carnal ideas of who will sit on the right hand who will sin and what the kingdom of god is even going to be like and peter's in arguments with the disciples of who's going to be the greatest they have no revelation of who they are but they know who he is and by knowing who he is they're trying to find who they are in relation to who he is can i be the greatest can i sit on the right hand can i sit on the left hand but if they had a revelation of who they are which we know john got because john's a type of the bride when he went to the heavenly realms he saw 24 thrones round about the throne amen they already had a position they already had a place but they were blind to who they were so peter knowing who jesus was but he lacked the revelation of who he was he ran away he forsook the lord he cursed but in an upper room he was going to receive a revelation this was a change in dispensation it was moving from jesus christ and the flesh body of the man from nazareth and now he says i will come to you and now the spirit of god was going to come back to them and he was going to indwell them and become one with them and now peter was going to know that christ was not amen somebody he could get close to but christ was going to be somebody that dwelt inside of him and that he and christ would be one and now now with this revelation peter is ready to face the sanhedrin he's ready to be crucified upside down he's ready to be mocked and spit upon and laughed at and ridiculed amen he's ready to stand because he got a greater revelation on the day of pentecost than the revelation he had before jesus died why because he had come to him personally and he'd become one with him and now when he goes to the gate beautiful and the man's begging he says gold and silver have i none but such as i have now peter's no longer worried about who's going to be greatest in the kingdom now they're not asking who's going to sit on the right hand and sue says on the left hand they've been unified with christ he's returned amen he's dwelling in them amen by the baptism of the holy ghost and now he's walking out with a higher revelation of where he fits into the program of god and now when they come to crucify him he doesn't resist he doesn't run he doesn't hide he doesn't slander and speak swear words and try to hide like he's not a believer he says could you just do me a favor could you crucify me upside down because i'm not worthy to be slayed like my lord the revelation carried him through every other trial and tribulation it was a greater revelation first john 5 4 says for whatsoever is born of god overcome with the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith and faith is a revelation how are we going to overcome the world by revelation how will we pass from where we stand now and to the change of the body through whatever we pass through to get there how will we get from here to there by revelation because this is the victory that overcome with the world even our faith our revelation i want to read one more quote and then we can go in the church age book and the revelation of jesus christ now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word so what is the works of satan the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her listen what's the antichrist spirit if i could just say it this way the antichrist spirit is the anti-word spirits anything that's contrary to the revealed word of the hour is antichrist so if it's denying the revealed word of the hour is taught by a prophet it's an antichrist spirits so antichrist is anti-word because christ is the anointed word so anything that stands against the word for our day the anointed word of this the revelation of the message is the antichrist spirit if by god's spirit they can discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her listen satan was powerless before eve until eve amen took that antichrist spirit amen and deviated from the word of god and then he overcame her amen this bride has been given back the pure word of god and as long as she stays with that amen he is powerless over her his power will come by getting her to deviate away from the revealed word that's why this revelation of who we are is so important satan will be powerless before he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert don't forget how christ overcame him in the desert it is written it is written not his gifts not his power he overcame him with it is written yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them there's been a revelation given to the people of god in this hour and i say it's a revelation there's been things open to us that have never been opened before they've been open to us in the opening of the seals that have never been opened before and that wasn't so that we can have a another move like we've had moves before it wasn't so that we can like i said before have a point of differentiation that makes us different than denominations that's not why this was open it was open to give us eyes to see amen to give us eagle vision to bring us out of the man age and bring us into the eagle earth to fly higher to see clear so that we would have the revelation to overcome all things that are coming in this day so what do we need to overcome the message of the hour amen and what revelation do we need we need to know who we are so many people know who brother branham is and that's wonderful but who are you peter knew who jesus was but who's peter amen we know who the prophet of god is we know who the seventh angel is but who are you that's my question today as we close who are you you know who the seventh angel is you can you can recite all of the church age messenger you know all seven angels in the hand of christ amen you know who christ is in this day and how he returned but who are you amen that's the revelation that we need in this hour is who am i amen and what is my purpose amen and now we've got to come to a time that we know that god has called his bride amen he's put the word in her hands amen and she knows now she's come from god and she goes to god now she doesn't need to defend herself protect herself run from danger she just needs to say god not my will but thy will be done whatever you want in my life is what you'll get but let me stand like a believer and face every trial amen and say all things are working together for good today amen all things are working together in this situation amen nothing shall defeat me nothing shall hinder me because god has a purpose for my life this too shall work together for god we need a greater revelation to bring us through we need a revelation that holds in the hour of trial i say god give us eagle eyes to see let's all stand together musicians if you'll come blake if you'll come you know we said earlier you didn't ask to be bride at least in the carnal remembering i have now i don't remember that i may have in the mind of god but i don't remember asking to be bride and i don't remember asking to come in laodicea but god chose me elected this portion of himself to come in this body of flesh and come in this age and he didn't put me here to be defeated by laodicea to be overwhelmed with the world to fall at every trial and test that is not why i'm here i've got a revelation that climbs higher than that and i'm not here to exhaust myself with my own efforts finding sin i'm here to say god you placed me here god you've got to carry me through i'm one of yours and i'm here for your purpose and let god bring his manifestation what am i here to do get out of his way and let him do what he always intended to do in this body of flesh in this hour that we're alive listen when you hear news reports don't break a sweat when chaos breaks out don't lose sleep you were ordained to be here now [Music] nothing happens in the life of a believer that doesn't first cross god's desk and he signs off on it nothing is to destroy you or hurt you everything is for your benefit and for the good for god's plan and so now it's time it's time to grow up if i've ever felt anything in my heart it's this it is time to grow up and act like the bride of jesus christ and stop acting it's time to awaken to the fact that we're eagles not chickens it's time remember brother branham saw that eagle that got blown down in that storm and he was in the blow down and he was there and and and and he was there drying off his wings and stretching his wings and brother venom encounters this eagle and says you know i could shoot you and he has this dialogue but the eagle didn't really worry about the hunter and he got annoyed with the chatter chatter chatter and he just set his wings and flapped a few times and set him and he went back into the heavenlies listen that's the solution to every problem you know when when trials come and difficulties come and and circumstances that we don't really know the answer to i i encourage you stop worrying and wringing your hands and walking around in circles just play a tape just read your bible just come back to church for fellowship amen let just just flap those wings a couple times and set them in the word amen and just get above that thing and realize this isn't going to hurt me this won't destroy me god hasn't planned for me to be here for a millennium then all of a sudden show up and i fail and fall apart god knew this was going to happen and god has me where he wants me so he can do something to display this word in this flesh so then every trial becomes an opportunity every circumstance becomes a way for the word to be manifest in your flesh and let let the let the winds set your wings and let the winds carry us a little bit higher above these things so that we can get away from all the carnal and away from all the threats and realize there is nothing that can threaten me nothing outside of god's will is going to be successful and if it's god's will why would i want to avoid it so nothing outside god's will is going to be successful but if it's in god's will why would i want to change it when it will work for good see god has done something special in this day not in the denominational ages where we had to make excuses you know every time something bad happened to a believer you know i grew up in a pentecostal church and everything is spiritualized so if something bad happened well you know you weren't clapping your hands last sunday and you've lost your praise and luck just say god's ordained it and allowed it to happen maybe i do need to learn something that's fine but god's ordained it he's brought it for good amen not for evil say god have your way in this trial and you have me as a yielded vessel to surrender to you that whatever you want you'll get right i think it's so much better than worrying and wringing our hands and trying to find our own solutions listen i have chased my tail time and time again trying to fix a problem and all i've ever done is make it worse but the times i did nothing were the times that they worked out the best praise be to god and that goes totally contrary to my nature but god knows what he's doing friends no matter what happens next in the world it's okay no matter what news report comes out no matter what natural disaster is next no matter what what what crisis hits next it's okay don't you worry a drop god has a plan and it's all okay man let's just bow our heads in thinking lord jesus we thank you lord for the message god what kind of people would we be without this message what kind of neurotics would we be in the age of neurosis if it wasn't for this message how many of us lord would be on antidepressants and anti-anxiety pills if it wasn't for this message god you have spared us we know that the men's hearts are failing for fear god help us lord to see your word and see the reality of the day we live in and recognize who we really are god for that revelation will bring us so much higher than the carnal things of life god i pray if there's anybody here who's still struggling with doubts about their personal identity i pray you'd quicken it to them now lord that you would come personally to them and bring them a new birth experience where that they would know who they really are god i praise that you allow them to rejoice like they rejoiced before when they saw the plan of salvation may they rejoice now in the plan of salvation like they did there may god you comfort our hearts to know that all is well that everything's under control gone that we are your expressed attributes on this earth in this day forgive us father help us to act like it lord we give you glory and praise and thanksgiving in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen i want to make one final statement i want to say quit whining when you saw the movie before you said it was good you said that's a good plan that'll work and now it's not time for us to go back on what we originally thought was great but it's time for us to let spiritual amnesia be clipped away by the word until we can go back to saying it's a good plan it's a good plan oh i don't understand it in my carnal mind i know that the devil can't even figure this one out and all his wisdom and intellect it's a good plan let's go back amen we may not be able to that still may be darkened to us in ways we may not still see what we saw that day and understand this clearly amen but remember there's something in you that saw it there amen there's an attribute of god a thought of god inside of you that knew it amen and let that thought carry you through every trial let that thing that bubbles up and says all is well amen when the when the when the shunamite woman had her baby die and she was making her way back to elijah he said is all well she said all is well that didn't come from her brain friends that didn't come from her emotions that came from something much deeper amen and let's stay connected to that part of god by his word that says in every circumstance all as well all is well amen god bless you let's sing [Music] to me according to your word
