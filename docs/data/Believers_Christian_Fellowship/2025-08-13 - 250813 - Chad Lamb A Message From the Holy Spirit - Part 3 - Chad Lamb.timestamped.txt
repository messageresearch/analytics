[0:00] What a wonderful change in my life has

[10:32] Won't you come inside my home? I need
[10:39] you more and more.
[10:44] Oh Lord, my heart is open.
[10:50] Won't you come inside
[10:56] and fill up all my being
[11:02] a virtue

[11:08] I've opened all the windows in my room.
[11:15] Wide every door.
[11:20] Won't you come inside my Lord? I need
[11:27] you more and more.
[11:30] Amen. We can say that with sincerity
[11:32] tonight. We need him more and more. As
[11:34] brother Chad comes tonight, let's just
[11:36] sing that song. Holy Spirit, thou art
[11:38] welcome. Kibby flat. Holy Spirit,
[11:42] thou art welcome
[11:45] in this place.
[11:49] Holy Spirit,
[11:51] thou art welcome
[11:54] in
[11:56] this place.
[11:58] Oh my
[12:01] father
[12:03] of mercy
[12:05] and grace.
[12:07] Thou art welcome
[12:10] in
[12:12] this place. Oh, sing that second verse.
[12:16] And fill all the hungry
[12:21] and empty
[12:23] within.
[12:25] Restore us, oh Father.
[12:30] Revive us again.
[12:36] Holy Spirit,
[12:38] thou art welcome
[12:41] in. Let's just stand together as we sing
[12:44] it. Thou art well
[12:48] in this place.
[12:53] Holy Spirit,
[12:56] thou art welcome
[12:59] in
[13:01] this place.
[13:03] Holy Spirit,
[13:05] thou art welcome
[13:08] in this place.
[13:12] Omnipotent
[13:15] Father
[13:17] of mercy
[13:19] and grace. Thou art welcome
[13:24] in this place.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's bow our heads together.
[13:32] Dear Lord, we're so thankful, God, to be
[13:35] here once again.
[13:37] And God, your your prophet taught us
[13:39] that you keep all of your appointments
[13:42] and you come where you're invited, Lord.
[13:45] You were invited to Simon's house once
[13:47] and you came, but you weren't welcome,
[13:49] Lord. But we've invited you to this
[13:52] place, Holy Spirit, but want you, we
[13:53] want you to find welcome, Lord. May we
[13:56] greet you with a kiss, Lord. May we
[13:58] anoint you with our prayers, Lord. May
[14:00] we wash your feet with our tears of
[14:02] repentance, Lord, as we so thankful and
[14:05] grateful for what you've done in this
[14:06] hour and what you've done in our lives.
[14:09] God, may you find welcome in our hearts,
[14:11] Lord, and in our lives. May there be
[14:13] room for you to work in each one of us,
[14:14] Lord, as we surrender to you tonight.
[14:17] And may you take your liberty in this
[14:19] place and speak your word to us, Lord. I
[14:22] surrender myself as a vessel that you
[14:24] can use. Lord, may you take full
[14:26] control, have preeminence. Lord, help me
[14:29] learn to surrender more. And God, may
[14:31] you give us each ears to hear, a heart
[14:34] to perceive, Lord, all that you have for
[14:36] us. And may Lord, we have your mind,
[14:39] Lord. And all these things, may you
[14:41] shape us and mold us into your very
[14:43] image. We love you, Lord. We ask that
[14:45] you would have your way this evening.
[14:47] And may you take us, Lord, from here.
[14:50] And as we go from here, may we go having
[14:52] gained something, Lord, grown in some
[14:55] way and have a clearer vision, brighter
[14:58] eyes, and a more determined walk, Lord,
[15:01] to fulfill your purpose in our lives in
[15:03] this end time. We love you, and we ask
[15:05] that you would accomplish this in Jesus
[15:07] Christ's name. Amen.
[15:11] Amen. God bless you all, man. It's good
[15:13] to be here together this evening. While
[15:15] you're standing, if you'll take your
[15:17] Bibles, I think we'll go right to the
[15:18] book of Genesis. Genesis chapter 1.
[15:21] We're going to continue on with the same
[15:23] thought we've been on the last couple of
[15:24] services. And uh I've been enjoying
[15:27] myself immensely. Amen. And I enjoyed
[15:29] the study very much today. And we'll
[15:32] we'll look forward to getting into it
[15:34] again. Amen. I just want to let you know
[15:36] too that brother Dave and Sister Bessie
[15:38] Wood left yesterday for their train trip
[15:41] to uh to Glacier National Park and
[15:44] they've got their daughters Becca and
[15:45] Sister Becca and Sister Rachel with
[15:46] them. So I know they're having a
[15:47] wonderful time. So keep them in prayer.
[15:49] They have a wonderful time. This was the
[15:50] gift the church gave them for for
[15:53] brother Dave's 47 years of service as a
[15:55] deacon. So we want the Lord to shower
[15:57] them with manifold blessings on their
[15:59] trip. I think it's going well so far.
[16:01] And so we just pray they have a
[16:03] wonderful time. Amen. Let's uh let's
[16:06] look here at Genesis 1
[16:10] and verse 9. We've read this the last
[16:13] two services, but we'll read it again
[16:15] quickly. Genesis 1:9. And God said, "Let
[16:18] the waters under the heaven be gathered
[16:20] together into one place. And let the dry
[16:23] land appear." And it was so. And God
[16:25] called the dry land earth, and the
[16:27] gathering together waters called he
[16:29] seas. And God saw that it was good. And
[16:32] God said, "Let the earth bring forth
[16:34] grass, the herb yielding seed, and the
[16:36] fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[16:38] kind, whose seed is in itself upon the
[16:40] earth." And it was so. And the earth
[16:43] brought forth grass and herb yielding
[16:45] seed after his kind, and the tree
[16:46] yielding fruit whose seed was in itself
[16:48] after his kind. And God saw that it was
[16:51] good. And the evening and the morning
[16:53] were the third day. Amen. May God bless
[16:55] you as you take your seats.
[16:58] Amen. Hopefully you still have your
[17:00] little booklet. If not, we have some in
[17:02] the back where the deacons are seated
[17:04] and also out in the forer. Keep this
[17:06] with you over the next couple of
[17:08] services. Well, not the next couple
[17:09] because I'll be gone. But when I get
[17:11] back, we'll go right back into it. Amen.
[17:13] So, I don't I don't imagine we'll finish
[17:16] it up today. Um, like I said, I think I
[17:18] I I think I mentioned this on Sunday
[17:20] that I intended just to kind of go
[17:21] through it. You know, I thought we would
[17:23] just go through it. We've never gone
[17:24] through it as a whole. We've gone
[17:26] through it in bits and pieces. So, I
[17:27] kind of imagined we would just kind of
[17:29] go through it. I didn't realize that
[17:31] every sentence was going to explode, you
[17:33] know, but that's the way it is. And so
[17:35] we got into it today again and it and it
[17:37] just kind of did the same thing it's
[17:39] been doing. It just keeps growing. And
[17:41] so I'm thankful for that because the
[17:43] word of God is eternal. Amen. And what
[17:46] God does is immeasurable and we'll never
[17:48] find the end of it. We'll never come to
[17:50] the end of any word that he gives is
[17:53] eternal. Amen. And I don't think we'll
[17:54] ever come to the end of it. Amen. Uh
[17:57] just as a a bit of review, when brother
[18:00] Benham had this experience where he was
[18:02] told by the Holy Spirit to take up his
[18:04] pen and write was the days prior to him
[18:06] preaching spoken word is the original
[18:08] seed. He was fasting and in prayer and
[18:11] and he had known that they were coming
[18:13] to a transition time. He had he he he
[18:16] says and we'll we'll read the quote
[18:18] where he knows that we've come to the
[18:20] end of the church systems. It's
[18:22] finished. It can't go on anymore. That
[18:24] it's done. that the seeds have been sown
[18:27] and now they were waiting. The seeds
[18:29] were sewn under the previous revival
[18:30] which was the former rain and now
[18:32] they're the seeds have been sewn before
[18:34] the latter rain and now they were in a
[18:36] holding pattern. He says everything's
[18:38] dying back. Amen. The revival fires
[18:40] aren't going like they were. Everything
[18:42] kind of died back and it's it's not the
[18:44] revival that was sweeping like it was.
[18:47] And he says now he he he he says I've
[18:50] got the people in this spot but I don't
[18:51] know where to go next. I don't know what
[18:53] to tell them to do next. And that's
[18:55] where he's at and that's what he's
[18:56] praying when the Holy Spirit says pick
[18:58] up your pen and write and gives him this
[19:00] message. And so we want to it first
[19:04] appears in the spoken word is the
[19:06] original seed. You can hear it on tape
[19:07] as he reads it. Uh and then it it's
[19:09] again in the church ages book under the
[19:11] Pamian church age. And so uh let's look
[19:14] at these two quotes to give us the
[19:16] background and then we'll move on in the
[19:17] book. Are we up? All right. We're coming
[19:20] up. We are up. All right. The spoken
[19:23] word is the original seed. Now remember,
[19:26] every spoken word of God is the original
[19:28] seed. God planted everything in the
[19:30] earth by his word. And as long as you
[19:32] stay with the original seed, it will
[19:34] breed itself right back and reproduce
[19:36] itself again. Hybrid, it dies. This is
[19:39] such a fundamental principle to
[19:41] everything that brother Benham is
[19:43] teaching us. And it's the very beginning
[19:45] of the message from the Holy Spirit, the
[19:47] same principle. Amen.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham when he
[19:50] started spoken words the original seed
[19:52] he started where we've been starting in
[19:54] Genesis Genesis chapter 1 he reads verse
[19:56] one to verse 13 and he starts going into
[19:59] the seed the original seed and the seed
[20:02] will only bring forth after its kind.
[20:04] And so this is the statement that he
[20:06] makes. Then here we are again. This is a
[20:09] review quote. I got a place here where I
[20:11] got so in the spirit. I got the church
[20:14] up to show it and prove it in the word
[20:16] here exactly what's happened all along.
[20:18] And then when I did, I thought, Lord, I
[20:20] got the people standing here now. I'll
[20:22] have them standing there. What can I
[20:24] tell them? I can't predict a future. I
[20:27] can't tell them what to do. What will I
[20:29] do? I'll leave them standing on a limb.
[20:31] I raised up my hand. I said, "God, I
[20:33] think I'm doing this by your will. I've
[20:36] never did this. Never did it before."
[20:37] Cuz the seed hadn't been sewed yet.
[20:40] said, "Now I believe it's time for me to
[20:42] say it, but now what am I going to say
[20:45] now?" And just as plain as you hear my
[20:47] voice, something said, "Pick up your
[20:49] pen." I'll read it to you in a minute.
[20:51] And when I got through, there it was,
[20:54] just the answer. I didn't even know what
[20:56] I was writing. Just started writing. And
[20:58] when I got through, I laid the pen down.
[21:01] I looked. I thought, "God have mercy.
[21:03] There it is right there. That's what I'm
[21:05] looking for." Amen. So, we have to
[21:09] remind ourselves, and we've been talking
[21:10] about this, but we have to remind
[21:12] ourselves of where brother Benham is in
[21:14] the timeline of his ministry because
[21:16] it's so important to remind ourselves of
[21:18] that. We are here looking back. And
[21:21] looking back, we know what came next in
[21:23] his life. We know that, you know, 1962
[21:26] is a pivotal year. He starts preaching
[21:28] present stage of our ministry, serves as
[21:30] this the time. He goes out west. Um, God
[21:32] leads him out west. He moves out west.
[21:34] at the time that this came, he didn't
[21:36] know he was moving out west.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Right. He didn't know that was going to
[21:39] happen. He didn't learn that until late
[21:41] in the fall. So, so, uh, all of this
[21:44] stuff hasn't happened yet. And then he
[21:47] goes out west to get the interpretation
[21:49] of of the seven thunders. He's going to
[21:52] reveal the the mystery of the seven
[21:53] seals. And he's going to come back and
[21:55] he's going to preach it in
[21:56] Jeffersonville. But at this time, he
[21:58] doesn't know that. Amen. He hasn't
[22:00] preached that. He doesn't know that.
[22:01] He's alluded to it when he preached the
[22:03] church ages and got done and come to
[22:05] Revelation chapter 4 and chapter 5 and
[22:07] preached it, but he couldn't go far. He
[22:09] couldn't go into Revelation chapter 6
[22:11] because that starts the seals. And so he
[22:14] had preached all the way through and he
[22:15] stopped and he couldn't go any farther
[22:17] and he starts talking about the seals on
[22:20] the back part of the book. And he's what
[22:21] he's talking about is the thunders that
[22:23] John heard and he was told to write it
[22:24] not. It was sealed up till the time of
[22:26] the end. So he knows there's something
[22:28] laying in the Bible. There's a
[22:30] revelation. And there's a mystery there.
[22:31] He knows it's there because John heard
[22:33] it and John was going to write. But John
[22:35] was told to seal it up. So he knows it's
[22:37] got to be revealed in the end time. But
[22:39] now he's standing over here previous to
[22:41] that and doesn't know how's God going to
[22:43] do it, what God's going to do, how it's
[22:45] going to work out. And he's sitting here
[22:47] wondering in himself what his ministry
[22:49] is. And he he's wondering, could I be
[22:52] that seventh angel? Is it me? Is it not?
[22:54] And and this is where the prophet is
[22:56] when this takes place. Yeah.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; So, when we're all the way over here in
[23:00] 2025, looking back, it's like, "Yeah, of
[23:03] course. Yeah, of course. Yeah, of
[23:04] course." But now, when you when you when
[23:06] we place ourselves back where he was,
[23:09] Amen. He had come and he preached the uh
[23:11] uh uh he had a healing revival that went
[23:14] all over the world, started revival,
[23:15] fires burning. God did some of the most
[23:17] supernatural things that had ever been
[23:19] done and recorded. Amen. And and now uh
[23:22] uh it was the very ministry of the
[23:24] Messiah on earth again. And then he
[23:26] starts preaching doctrine, starts tying
[23:28] together the loose ends and sewing the
[23:29] seed of the original word again. And
[23:31] then he preaches the seven church ages.
[23:34] Then he preaches Revelation chapter 4
[23:36] right after that. Then he comes into in
[23:38] June of 1965 and he preaches Revelation
[23:40] chapter 5. What's he doing? He's an
[23:43] endtime prophet. He's the seventh angel
[23:45] and he's working his way through the
[23:46] book of Revelation.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; But he's hung up at the end of chapter 5
[23:51] and he can't go any further. And now he
[23:54] knows something else has to come. He
[23:57] knows that the church systems are done.
[24:00] He knows we're in the Leodysian church
[24:01] age because he's already preached the
[24:03] church ages. He know Christ is on the
[24:05] outside. He knows all of these things,
[24:07] but he doesn't know how what's going to
[24:09] happen next. How it will transpire, what
[24:11] to do.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; That's why he's saying, "I'll have him
[24:15] on a limb. I'm telling them it's done.
[24:16] The church systems are done. The church
[24:18] ages are come to an end. But I don't
[24:20] know what I'm going to tell him to do."
[24:21] He goes, "I can't predict the future. I
[24:23] can't tell him what comes next.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; That's why when he put his pen down and
[24:28] picked it up and read this, he says,
[24:30] "That's it. That's exactly what I'm
[24:32] looking for because this is the answer
[24:34] to this question."
[24:36] &gt;&gt; So when we look back, sometimes it
[24:38] doesn't hit us with as much impact as I
[24:40] think it should. But if we were standing
[24:42] where he was in the timeline, I think it
[24:45] would have I don't think we could
[24:47] actually understand how much impact this
[24:49] had on him.
[24:51] Amen.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; So, let's go to our little booklet now.
[24:55] If you can take your little booklet out
[25:01] &gt;&gt; and let's go to page one. I'm going to
[25:03] read through and get us up to where we
[25:05] stopped. And I am going to try my very
[25:07] best not to stop and comment because
[25:09] we've done that along the way. So, just
[25:13] Yeah,
[25:16] &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what my intentions
[25:18] are so you know what I mean to do.
[25:20] And if it goes sideways, you know. Yeah.
[25:22] Well, you know. So, he says, "One night
[25:26] as I was seeking the Lord, the Holy
[25:27] Spirit told me to pick up my pen and
[25:29] write. As I grasped the pen to write,
[25:31] his spirit gave me a message for the
[25:33] church. I want to bring it to you. It
[25:35] has to do with the word and the bride.
[25:38] Here is what I'm trying to say to you.
[25:41] The law of reproduction is that each
[25:43] species brings forth after its own kind,
[25:46] even according to Genesis 1:11. And God
[25:49] said, "Let the earth bring forth grass,
[25:51] and the herb yielding seed, and the
[25:52] fruit true yielding fruit after his
[25:54] kind, whose seed is in itself upon the
[25:57] earth." And it was so. Whatever life was
[26:00] in the seed came forth into a plant and
[26:02] then into fruit. The very same law
[26:05] applies to the church today. Whatever
[26:07] seed started the church will come forth
[26:09] and be like the original seed because it
[26:11] is the same seed. In these last days,
[26:14] the true bride church, Christ seed, will
[26:16] come to the headstone, and she will be
[26:19] the super church, a super race as she
[26:22] nears him. They and the bride will be so
[26:24] much like him. They will even be in his
[26:28] very image. This is in order to be
[26:30] united with him. They will be one. They
[26:33] will be the very manifestation of the
[26:35] word of the living God.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; I'm trying, folks. I'm trying.
[26:42] This is some of the most exciting things
[26:44] I've ever read in my life
[26:46] &gt;&gt; because this is what God's going to
[26:48] accomplish.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; This is what God's going to do. This is
[26:51] what he's doing now. It's taking place
[26:54] currently. This is what we're caught up
[26:56] in. This is what's going on all around
[26:58] us. This right here,
[27:01] &gt;&gt; they will be the very manifestation of
[27:03] the word of the living God.
[27:05] Denominations cannot produce this wrong
[27:07] seed. They will produce their creeds and
[27:09] their dogmas mixed with the word. This
[27:11] mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid
[27:14] product. The first son Adam was the
[27:16] spoken seed word of God. He was given a
[27:19] bride to reproduce himself. That is why
[27:21] the bride was given to him to reproduce
[27:23] himself. To produce another son of God,
[27:27] but she fell. She fell by hybridization.
[27:30] She caused him to die. The second son,
[27:33] Jesus, also a spoken seed word of God,
[27:36] was given a bride like as was Adam. But
[27:39] before he could marry her, she also had
[27:41] fallen. She, like Adam's wife, was put
[27:44] to the test whether she would believe
[27:45] the word of God and live or doubt the
[27:48] word and die. She doubted. She left the
[27:51] word. She died. From a little group of
[27:54] the true seed of the word, God will
[27:56] present Christ with a beloved bride. She
[27:59] is a virgin of his word. She is virgin
[28:02] because you got that word because
[28:05] because she knows no man-made creeds or
[28:07] dogmas. By and through the members of
[28:09] the bride will be fulfilled all that was
[28:11] promised of God to be made manifest in
[28:14] the virgin. So what was promised of God
[28:16] to be made manifest in the virgin. Amen.
[28:19] God in flesh.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God coming in flesh through the
[28:23] virgin to produce another son of God.
[28:26] Amen. The word of promise came to the
[28:28] Virgin Mary. But that word of promise
[28:31] was he himself to be made manifest. Why?
[28:35] Because he is the word and he is the
[28:38] word made manifest. God was made
[28:40] manifest. He himself acted at that time
[28:42] and fulfilled his own word of promise in
[28:44] the virgin. It was an angel that had
[28:47] brought her the message. But the angel's
[28:49] message was the word of God. Isaiah 9:6.
[28:52] He fulfilled at that time all that was
[28:54] written of him because she accepted his
[28:56] word to her. The members of the virgin
[28:59] bride will love him and they will have
[29:01] his potentials for he is their head and
[29:04] all power belongs to him. They are
[29:06] subject to him as the members of our
[29:08] bodies are subject to our heads.
[29:11] Notice the harmony of the father and the
[29:13] son. Jesus never did anything until it
[29:16] was first showed him by the father. John
[29:18] 5:19.
[29:20] This harmony is now to exist between the
[29:22] groom and his bride. He shows her his
[29:24] word of life. She receives it. She never
[29:27] doubts it. Therefore, nothing can harm
[29:29] her, not even death. For if the seed be
[29:32] planted, the water will raise it up
[29:34] again. Here is the secret of this. The
[29:37] word is in the bride as it was in Mary.
[29:40] The bride has the mind of Christ, for
[29:42] she knows what he once done with the
[29:44] word. She performs the command of the
[29:46] word in his name, for she has thus
[29:48] sayeth the Lord. Then the word is
[29:50] quickened by the spirit, and it comes to
[29:52] pass. Like a seed that is planted and
[29:55] watered, it comes to full harvest
[29:57] serving its purpose. I am going to stop
[29:59] and comment just a wee little bit.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; She has listen it says she performs the
[30:06] command of the word in his name for she
[30:08] has thus sayeth the Lord. Then the word
[30:10] is quickened by the spirit and it comes
[30:12] to pass. How does she have thus sayeth
[30:14] the Lord on the word? It's because God
[30:16] sent a prophet to give the correct
[30:17] interpretation of the word. We have the
[30:20] We have the perfect interpretation of
[30:22] the word with divine vindication because
[30:24] God sent a prophet to bring the perfect
[30:27] interpretation of this word. We don't
[30:29] have to guess about it. We don't have to
[30:30] argue about it. We don't have to worry
[30:32] about it. We just have to stick with
[30:33] what God gave us.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; And we have to obey it. We have to
[30:38] perform it. We have to get under it. We
[30:40] have to put it on. We have we have to we
[30:42] have to manifest it. We have to take
[30:44] this word that was given to us. Amen.
[30:47] Listen. This this word was not given to
[30:49] us by William Brandon. This word was
[30:50] given to us by Christ our Lord
[30:53] &gt;&gt; through his prophet. Amen. And it was
[30:55] the restoration of the word bringing
[30:57] back the restoration of the virgin
[30:59] bride. He washed us by the water of a
[31:02] pure word to bring us back into a virgin
[31:04] condition by washing us by his own word.
[31:07] Amen. So that he could plant his word
[31:09] into us so that out of us will come the
[31:11] word.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, she's not looking for
[31:19] her own. Thus sayeth the Lord.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; She already has it.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; We already have the perfect
[31:27] interpretation of the word. What we need
[31:29] to do is submit to it and live it and
[31:31] yield to it and obey it and read it and
[31:34] absorb it and let it become our life.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:41] All right. Paragraph 172-3.
[31:44] Those in the bride do only his will. No
[31:48] one can make them do otherwise. They
[31:50] have thus sayaith the Lord or they keep
[31:52] still. They know that it has to be God
[31:54] in them doing the works, fulfilling his
[31:56] own word. He did not complete all his
[31:58] works while in his earthly ministry. So
[32:00] now he works in and through the bride.
[32:04] So where is he going to work in the end
[32:06] time? In and through the bride.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; That's where he's working. This is what
[32:11] This is what brother Brandham was.
[32:13] Listen, he This is where he's at. The
[32:16] church is done. It's finished. Christ is
[32:18] on the outside. We're legacy in
[32:19] churches. Amen. It doesn't work anymore.
[32:21] God's done with the church. I got the
[32:23] people out on a limb. I don't know where
[32:24] to take them. I don't know what the next
[32:26] step is. And now pick up your pen and
[32:28] write is telling us what the next step
[32:30] is. The next step is he's God is
[32:32] presenting Christ with another virgin
[32:34] bride. And this virgin is going to have
[32:36] the perfect word. And she's going to
[32:38] stand on the word. She's going to live
[32:41] under the word. She's going to manifest
[32:42] the word. And God is going to finish the
[32:45] work that he left for this time. And
[32:47] he's going to do it in her
[32:50] &gt;&gt; because she's part of the original seed.
[32:52] She's going to bring forth. She's
[32:54] receiving the original seed to manifest
[32:56] the original seed.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[33:02] He works in and through the bride. She
[33:04] knows that for it was not yet time for
[33:07] him to do certain things that he must
[33:09] now do.
[33:11] But he will now fulfill through the
[33:13] bride that work which he left for this
[33:17] specific time.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Now brother Brandham has realized what's
[33:22] the next step? The next step is come out
[33:25] from her my people
[33:27] &gt;&gt; and be you separate and touch not the
[33:28] unclean thing and I'll receive you.
[33:31] Now, paragraph 172-4, this is where
[33:34] we're picking up. We stop there.
[33:38] Now, let us stand like Joshua and Caleb.
[33:41] Now, when I get to this, my heart just
[33:44] jumps.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Says, "Now, let us stand."
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Now,
[33:51] &gt;&gt; now, why now? What does now mean? What
[33:54] is the now all about? The now is in
[33:56] reference to what was spoken previously.
[33:58] He's he's referring back to what he just
[34:00] said when he says now because of this
[34:02] now let's stand.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; So what did he just say? I'm going to
[34:06] read it again. Those in the bride do
[34:08] only his will. No one can make them do
[34:10] otherwise. They have thus sayeth the
[34:12] Lord or they keep still. They know that
[34:13] it has to be God in them doing the works
[34:17] fulfilling his own word. He did not
[34:19] complete all his work while in his
[34:20] earthly ministry. So now he works in and
[34:23] through the bride. She knows that for it
[34:25] was not yet time for him to do certain
[34:27] things that he must now do. But he will
[34:29] now fulfill through the bride that work
[34:32] which he left for this specific time.
[34:34] Now
[34:36] &gt;&gt; because this is his plan because this is
[34:38] the time because it's now time for him
[34:41] to manifest his finishing of his works
[34:43] in his bride form. Now let's stand like
[34:46] Joshua and Caleb because now it's going
[34:48] to require a Joshua and Caleb stand in
[34:51] order to make this last stand. Amen.
[34:53] Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Now, let's stand like Joshua and Caleb.
[34:56] Our promised land is coming in sight
[34:58] even as theirs did. Now, Joshua means
[35:00] Jehovah's Savior, and he represents the
[35:03] end time leader that will come to the
[35:04] church even as Paul came as the original
[35:07] leader. So, any guess what he's
[35:09] referring to here?
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. In previous messages, he refers to
[35:14] Joshua as the Holy Ghost. And and he
[35:16] does after this, too. Amen. It's the
[35:18] Holy Ghost leadership coming to the
[35:20] church. Amen. In an adoption series in
[35:22] 1960, he says the Holy Ghost placing the
[35:24] church positionally placing coming to
[35:26] adoption. Amen. But but brother Brandham
[35:29] also says that the messenger for the
[35:31] last age is the Holy Ghost.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; But who is the messenger of the last
[35:38] age?
[35:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost
[35:42] &gt;&gt; and the seventh angel. Who's the seventh
[35:43] angel? William Brham. Because God has to
[35:46] have a vessel to work through. It's the
[35:48] Holy Ghost. It's the power of God. It's
[35:50] Christ working his own ministry, but
[35:51] he's doing it in that vessel.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; So Joshua means Jehovah's savior. And he
[35:57] represents the end time leader that will
[35:59] come to the church even as Paul came as
[36:02] the original leader. So he's showing
[36:04] there's got to be an end time leader
[36:05] like Paul. Paul was alpha. There's got
[36:07] to be an omega. Paul was a prophet.
[36:09] Amen. He was a prophet messenger. In the
[36:11] end time there's coming a prophet
[36:13] messenger.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Caleb represents those
[36:19] that stayed true with Joshua."
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; So,
[36:28] I think we can discern who Joshua
[36:30] represents.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; But who's Caleb?
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope by the grace of God it's me.
[36:37] I believe it's me. Amen. Now, he's
[36:39] telling me now because of this, stand
[36:41] like Joshua and Caleb. Joshua is not the
[36:43] only one making this stand, but the
[36:45] Calebs in the end time have to make the
[36:47] stand as well.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to Numbers chapter 13
[36:52] together.
[36:58] Numbers chapter 13
[37:01] and we'll begin at verse 26.
[37:11] All right. Numbers 13
[37:13] 26.
[37:15] They sent the spies out. They came back
[37:17] to Moses. They spied out the land for 40
[37:20] days. It says, "And they went and they
[37:22] came to Moses and to Aaron and to all
[37:24] the congregation of the children of
[37:25] Israel unto the wilderness of Peron to
[37:28] the Kadesh, and brought back word unto
[37:30] them, and unto all the congregation, and
[37:32] show them the fruit of the land." And
[37:34] they told him, and said, We come unto
[37:36] the land whether thou sentest us. Surely
[37:38] it flowest with milk and honey. And this
[37:41] is the fruit of it. Nevertheless, the
[37:44] people be strong that dwell in the land,
[37:46] and the cities are walled and very
[37:48] great. And moreover, we saw the children
[37:50] of Anoch there. The children of Anoch
[37:52] were a race of giants.
[37:55] The Amalachites dwell in the land of the
[37:57] south. The Hittites and the Jebusites,
[37:59] and the Amorites dwell in the mountains,
[38:01] and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and
[38:03] by the coast of Jordan.
[38:05] And Caleb, oh, who's Caleb?
[38:09] And Caleb stilled the people before
[38:11] Moses and said, "Let us go up at once
[38:14] and possess it,
[38:17] &gt;&gt; for we are well able to overcome it."
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Let's stand like Joshua
[38:23] and Caleb." This is Caleb's stand. This
[38:26] is how Caleb stood. Amen. When everybody
[38:29] else said, "It's too hard. It's
[38:31] impossible. Look at the obstacles. Look
[38:33] at how hard this is to believe. There's
[38:36] no way we're going to do this." Caleb
[38:38] didn't care about giants and Amorites
[38:40] and Hittites and walled cities and land
[38:43] that eats up the inhabitants. He was
[38:45] only looking at one thing. There was a
[38:46] promised word. Amen. And God had
[38:48] confirmed it through a prophet. And
[38:50] there was nothing else for him to look
[38:51] at and nothing else to stand upon
[38:53] because he wasn't worried about
[38:55] strength. He wasn't worried about
[38:56] numbers. He was looking to that word.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Now, let's stand like Joshua and Caleb.
[39:01] If we want to stand like Caleb, Amen.
[39:03] Caleb wasn't in Caleb was not looking at
[39:06] his own strength and his own ability and
[39:08] his own listen Caleb had no power to
[39:11] overcome walled cities of the Anakans.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; He had no power to drive out Amorites
[39:15] and Hititta. He had none of that. But
[39:17] what he had was a promise of God that
[39:19] God said, "I would give you this land."
[39:21] And he had the it was the power of the
[39:23] spoken word
[39:25] &gt;&gt; through a prophet confirmed through a
[39:27] prophet given to a prophet Abraham
[39:29] confirmed through a prophet in Moses.
[39:31] And now he had the audacity to believe
[39:34] that word.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; And because he believed that word, he
[39:37] believed that they could walk in there
[39:39] and they could throw them all out of the
[39:41] land and possess the land.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; He didn't believe it because of his
[39:45] military prowess. He didn't believe it
[39:47] because of his intellect. He didn't
[39:49] believe it because he had a plan. He
[39:50] probably had no plan. I can imagine they
[39:52] could ask Caleb, "Caleb, how do you
[39:54] think we're going to do it?" He said,
[39:55] "We're more than able."
[39:57] &gt;&gt; How? I don't know how. Let's just go.
[40:00] Yeah.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Listen, I don't know how God's going to
[40:06] keep all of his promise that he promised
[40:08] us in the end time. I can't mechanically
[40:10] explain it. I don't have the intellect.
[40:12] I don't know how he's going to move
[40:14] governments around and he's going to
[40:15] change everything. I don't even know how
[40:17] he's going to change all of my atoms.
[40:19] But he's going to do it. Amen. Because
[40:20] I've got a promised word. And now, let's
[40:23] stand like Joshua and Caleb. Amen.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Let's just stand on that promise that
[40:28] he's going to have victory through his
[40:30] bride. He's going to finish the work he
[40:32] left for this specific time and he's
[40:34] going to do it in and through his bride.
[40:35] And I believe he's part I'm part of that
[40:37] bride. So, it's going to happen in me.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Listen, that does not matter how many
[40:46] times I've failed. It doesn't matter how
[40:47] many times I've tried and I've got it
[40:49] wrong. It doesn't matter how many times
[40:51] I've embarrassed myself trying to live
[40:53] for God. Amen. It doesn't matter. I
[40:56] believe I'm part of the promise. And he
[40:57] said he will have it.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; And he will have it.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; And if I'm part of it, he'll have it in
[41:04] me.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:08] Doesn't matter how long it takes. It
[41:09] doesn't matter what we have to go
[41:10] through to get there. It's going to
[41:12] happen.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; So, it's not by might nor by power, but
[41:18] by my spirit, sayeth the Lord.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not going to happen because
[41:22] we figured something out and we finally
[41:24] got this all arranged and we finally
[41:26] strengthened ourselves and no friends.
[41:30] Let's just go possess it.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Let's just go now.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Let's just claim the promise. Let's just
[41:37] believe for our healing. Let's believe
[41:39] for our deliverance. Let's believe that
[41:40] he's going to have this body to do the
[41:42] supernatural. Let's believe that all
[41:44] things are possible to them. Believe.
[41:45] Let's just believe it. Amen.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know how, but I know he will.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Let's keep reading. Verse 30 again. And
[41:54] Caleb stilled the people before Moses,
[41:56] said, "Let us go up at once and possess
[41:58] it, for we are well able to overcome
[42:00] it." But the men that went up with him
[42:03] said, "We be not able to go up against
[42:05] the people, for they are stronger than
[42:07] we."
[42:09] Oh,
[42:11] and they brought an evil report of the
[42:13] land which they had searched unto the
[42:14] children of Israel, saying, The land
[42:16] through which we have gone to search. It
[42:18] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[42:20] thereof, and all the people that we saw
[42:22] in it are men of great stature. And
[42:24] there we saw the giants, the son of
[42:25] Anch, which come from the giants. And we
[42:28] were in our own sight as grasshoppers,
[42:30] and so were we in their sight.
[42:33] You know what the problem here is?
[42:36] &gt;&gt; They're looking at all the natural
[42:37] circumstances. Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Everything they mention is natural
[42:42] circumstances. Natural. Natural.
[42:43] Natural. Natural. Natural.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, Caleb had the same kind of
[42:48] eyeballs they had.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; And he walked through the same land that
[42:52] they walked through. And he saw the
[42:54] walled cities. And he saw everything
[42:56] that they saw. Amen. But the eyes of his
[42:59] faith saw something they couldn't see.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; All they saw were obstacles. What he saw
[43:04] was the promise. Amen. He said, "Amen."
[43:07] And he comes back and he's looking at
[43:09] he's looking at a land that flows with
[43:10] milk and honey. He's not even paying
[43:12] attention to the Anakans. Amen. Yeah,
[43:14] they're giants. They're huge in stature.
[43:15] Yeah, they got big walls. So what? Did
[43:17] you see their field? Did you see all the
[43:19] fruit that's hanging there? What about
[43:21] this cluster of grapes that we put on a
[43:22] rod and take two men to carry back? What
[43:25] are you guys looking at? Look at what's
[43:26] ours.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; And Caleb wanted it. Yeah.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; You know, these other these others had
[43:37] no faith.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Caleb had faith.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; I mean, they had faith as long as
[43:43] everything was going fine. They had
[43:45] faith as long as as Moses was there
[43:47] doing mighty works in Egypt and and and
[43:49] and and you know, overcoming Pharaoh. I
[43:52] mean, they they had faith until they
[43:53] come to the Red Sea. They had no faith
[43:54] anymore. Then they got across the Red
[43:56] Sea and it's amazing how their faith
[43:57] sprung so high. Amen. And Mirram took a
[44:00] tambourine and the and the daughters of
[44:01] Israel were singing up and down a song
[44:03] that Moses had wrote. They were
[44:05] rejoicing. Amen. They had faith again.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Until they come to the bitter waters of
[44:10] Mara and then they had no more faith.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; And then he made the bat water sweet and
[44:14] all of a sudden they were rejoicing
[44:15] again. Amen. Until they came to a place
[44:17] they got they ran out of bread.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; They had no more faith. And then he sent
[44:21] mana and all of a sudden they were
[44:22] rejoicing again. That's not the kind of
[44:25] believer I want to be. Amen. I want to
[44:27] be like Caleb that it doesn't matter
[44:29] what the circumstances are, I'm not
[44:31] looking at the natural circumstances.
[44:33] I'm looking at a promise in God's word
[44:35] that no matter what happens in my life,
[44:38] God is going to do something in and
[44:40] through me to show himself in this end
[44:43] time to finish his works. And if
[44:45] finishing his works is overcoming this
[44:46] obstacle, he'll overcome the obstacle.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to overcome it because I
[44:51] don't have any strength. It's got to be
[44:53] him doing his works in me.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; But nothing happens if we don't believe.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; We have to believe
[45:07] now. Let's go to chapter 14. They they
[45:09] mentioned all of this stuff.
[45:12] They said, "Listen, verse, let's go back
[45:13] to 31." Verse 31. But the men that went
[45:16] up with him said, "We be not able to go
[45:18] up against the Well, I mean, that's a
[45:20] given.
[45:21] Come on.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; We knew before you went to spy out the
[45:25] land, you weren't able.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; That's not the point. The point is God's
[45:30] given you the land.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. I'm not able to solve
[45:39] one of my problems,
[45:41] &gt;&gt; but he's more than able.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Numbers 14:1. And all the congregation
[45:48] lifted up their voice and cried. And the
[45:51] people wept that night. And all the
[45:53] children of Israel murmured against
[45:55] Moses, against Aaron. And the whole
[45:57] congregation said unto them, Would God
[45:59] that we had died in the land of Egypt?
[46:01] Or would God we had died in the
[46:03] wilderness? And wherefore hath the Lord
[46:05] brought us unto this land to fall by the
[46:07] sword, that our wives and our children
[46:09] should be a prey? Were it not better for
[46:12] us to return unto Egypt?
[46:15] And they said one to another, "Let us
[46:16] make a captain, and let us return unto
[46:18] Egypt." And Moses and Aaron fell on
[46:20] their faces before all the assembly of
[46:22] the congregation of the children of
[46:23] Israel. And Joshua the son of Nun, and
[46:26] Caleb the son of Jeffina, which were of
[46:28] them that searched the land, rent their
[46:30] clothes. And they spake unto all the
[46:32] company of the children of Israel,
[46:33] saying, "The land which we pass through
[46:35] to search it, is an exceeding good land.
[46:39] If the Lord delight in us, then he will
[46:41] bring us into this land and give it us a
[46:44] land which flowth with milk and honey.
[46:46] Only rebel not ye against the Lord,
[46:48] neither fear ye the people of the land,
[46:50] for they are bred for us. Their defense
[46:52] is departed from them, and the and and
[46:55] the Lord is with us. Fear them not.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Let us stand like Joshua and Caleb.
[47:02] Friend, there's nothing for us to be
[47:03] afraid of. There's no circumstance in
[47:05] our life for us to fear. Amen. Because
[47:08] God already has a promise in our lives.
[47:10] Amen. And we are the vessels that he's
[47:12] using to manifest his word in this end
[47:14] time.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; And they know that it has to be him,
[47:20] God, in them doing the works.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Who was Joshua and Caleb depending on
[47:27] here?
[47:29] They weren't depending on themselves.
[47:31] They said, "The people are bred for us.
[47:34] They're not Their defenses are vanished.
[47:36] They're deteriorating. and they're
[47:37] nothing. What were they looking at?
[47:39] Certainly not the walls.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; They were looking at the promise because
[47:44] they're saying if God delighted in us.
[47:47] Verse 10,
[47:49] but all the congregation bade stone them
[47:51] with stones and the glory of the Lord
[47:52] appeared in the tabernacle of the
[47:54] congregation before all the children of
[47:56] Israel.
[47:58] One thing that I found to be true in my
[48:01] own life and in just associating with
[48:03] people,
[48:04] once somebody has given up hope and lost
[48:07] faith in the word of God and they begin
[48:09] to complain about what's not working in
[48:11] their lives, they hate it when you tell
[48:13] them
[48:14] &gt;&gt; the promises of God and stop that and
[48:17] just believe and that doesn't matter and
[48:19] that doesn't matter. lying vanities
[48:21] because once they've lost hope and once
[48:23] they've already given over to all the
[48:25] uncsurmountable circumstances, they
[48:27] can't stand to have somebody near them
[48:28] speaking faith.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; The moment they've lost faith, they
[48:32] can't stand to hear somebody talking
[48:33] about faith anymore.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And now they wanted to stone them with
[48:38] stones for what?
[48:40] What offense did they commit? What did
[48:42] they do wrong? They just believed God's
[48:44] promise. Yeah,
[48:46] &gt;&gt; they just believe that they were able to
[48:47] take the land that God said he would
[48:49] give to them and that he would drive the
[48:51] inhabitants out for them.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Let's go down to uh uh verse 23 now.
[48:58] Surely they shall not see the land which
[49:00] I swore unto their fathers, neither
[49:02] shall any of them that provoke me see
[49:04] it. But my servant Caleb, because he had
[49:07] another spirit with him, and hath
[49:09] followed me fully, him will I bring unto
[49:12] the land whereto he went, and his seed
[49:14] shall possess it. Praise be to God.
[49:17] Amen. Why? Because he followed God
[49:20] fully. With all of his heart, he
[49:23] believed the promise of God.
[49:26] Amen. Let's go down to verse 30.
[49:29] doubtless you shall not come into the
[49:31] land concerning which I swear to make
[49:33] you dwell therein save Caleb the son of
[49:35] Jeffina and and Joshua the son of none.
[49:39] So I'm going to ask you friends in this
[49:41] day we live in who's crossing to a body
[49:43] change? Those who stand like Joshua and
[49:45] Caleb?
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Those who believe this message and stick
[49:48] with it no matter what. When it looks
[49:51] impossible, when it looks like it's
[49:53] going the wrong direction. When it looks
[49:54] like the obstacles are getting higher,
[49:56] that's the time to make the stand. Amen.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[50:02] Amen. Now, let's look at Joshua 14
[50:05] together. Turn with me over to Joshua.
[50:13] Remember, we've got to stand. Now that
[50:15] we know what God's doing at the end
[50:17] time, now let's stand like Joshua and
[50:19] Caleb.
[50:20] Joshua chapter 14 and verse 6.
[50:27] Then the children of Judah came into
[50:29] Joshua and Gilgal. And Caleb the son of
[50:32] Jeffina the Kennzite said unto him,
[50:34] "Thou knowest the thing that the Lord
[50:36] said unto Moses, the man of God
[50:38] concerning me and thee in Kadesh Barnea.
[50:41] 40 years old was I when Moses the
[50:43] servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh
[50:45] Barnea to spy out the land. And I
[50:48] brought him word again as it was in mine
[50:50] heart. Nevertheless, my brethren that
[50:52] went up with me made the heart of the
[50:54] people melt, but I wholly followed the
[50:57] Lord my God.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Stop for a minute. How did he wholly
[51:02] follow the Lord his God? Listen, this
[51:04] wasn't talking about uh good deeds and
[51:07] paying alms and no, how did he wholly
[51:11] follow the Lord? What was attributed to
[51:13] him? Why did God bless him so much and
[51:15] promise? Because he believed the whole
[51:17] word. Yes,
[51:19] &gt;&gt; because he had faith. Because he had
[51:21] faith, righteousness was imputed unto
[51:22] him. He was part of the promise. And God
[51:24] was going to ensure he got the promise.
[51:26] What did it mean to wholly follow the
[51:28] Lord? Listen, it wasn't going around and
[51:30] doing kind deeds for elderly people.
[51:33] Amen. He may have done that, too, and
[51:34] that's fine. But that's not what God was
[51:37] looking at. God wasn't looking like his
[51:38] niceness. It wasn't looking at his arms
[51:40] deeds. It wasn't looking at how what a
[51:42] good neighbor he was. He was looking at
[51:44] one thing. This is a man that wholly
[51:46] followed after me because he believed
[51:49] all of my word when it was impossible.
[51:51] When nobody else did, he stayed with it.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Listen, that's what it means to wholly
[51:57] follow the Lord. Amen. We can be as nice
[51:59] as we want to be. And we can do all the
[52:00] nice things that we want to do. Amen.
[52:02] And we can live clean and live nice and
[52:04] be a nice person and make everybody
[52:06] think we're wonderful. Amen. But if we
[52:08] don't wholly follow this message, we
[52:10] haven'ty followed the Lord.
[52:15] Praise God.
[52:19] So
[52:21] let's get back to Caleb
[52:26] verse 9.
[52:30] And Moses swear on the day saying,
[52:32] Surely
[52:34] the land wherein thy feet hath trodden
[52:36] shall be thine inheritance and thy
[52:38] childrens forever because thou hast
[52:40] wholly followed the Lord my God. And
[52:43] now, behold, the Lord hath kept me
[52:44] alive, as he said these 40 and five
[52:46] years, even since the Lord spake this
[52:49] word unto Moses, while the children of
[52:51] Israel wandered in the wilderness. And
[52:53] now, lo, I am this day four score and 5
[52:56] years old, 85 years old. And yet I am as
[53:00] strong this day as I was in the day that
[53:02] Moses sent me. As my strength was then,
[53:05] even so is my strength now for war, both
[53:08] to go out and to come in. Now therefore,
[53:11] give me this mountain whereof the Lord
[53:13] spake in that day. For thou heardest in
[53:15] that day how the Anakans were there, and
[53:18] that the cities were great and fenced.
[53:20] If so be the Lord will be with me, then
[53:22] I shall be able to drive them out, as
[53:23] the Lord said. And Joshua blessed him,
[53:26] and gave unto Caleb the son of Jeffa,
[53:28] Hebrin, for an inheritance. Hein
[53:30] therefore became the inheritance of
[53:32] Caleb, the son of Jeffa, the Kennesite,
[53:34] unto this day, because that he wholly
[53:36] followed the Lord God of Israel.
[53:40] Let us stand like Joshua and Caleb.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. 45 40 years. He made it 40 years
[53:47] to the promised land. He spied it out.
[53:49] He saw it. It was a good land. He wanted
[53:51] to go possess it. Amen. But all uh uh
[53:53] everybody else in in Israel, their heart
[53:56] melted and they gave up. Amen. And they
[53:58] wanted to turn back. But he stayed true
[54:00] to the word and never backed down. He
[54:02] said, "We're more than able." Amen.
[54:04] They're bred for us. Their defenses have
[54:06] melted away. If God delights in us,
[54:08] he'll give us the land. He kept going
[54:10] back to the word.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Just the word. Not his own thinking. Not
[54:14] his way he felt about it. Just the word.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; And now 45 years as that nation melts
[54:21] away and they're digging graves every
[54:24] day.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Remember, there was 600,000 men able to
[54:28] go to war age 20 and up, plus their
[54:31] wives. Amen. And so, however many Amen.
[54:34] However many you want to attribute that
[54:36] to, everybody over 20 years old. Amen.
[54:38] They all had to die in a 40-year period.
[54:41] So, you do the math. About a million or
[54:42] more people over 40 years, 365,
[54:46] it's 360 then. 360*
[54:50] 40 equals whatever. And divide that out
[54:53] of 1.1 1.2 million. And think about how
[54:56] many graves they dug every day.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; So, they would realize only the word
[55:03] works.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Only the word works. Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; So that next generation would see them
[55:08] all die and realize only the word works.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Because they said our children, we
[55:15] brought us out for our women to be
[55:17] slaughtered and our children to be
[55:18] slaughtered. And why have you done this?
[55:20] And God says out of your mouth, Amen.
[55:23] I'm going to make you basically eat your
[55:25] words. You're going to die, but those
[55:27] children you said were going to be
[55:28] slaughtered, they're going to go in and
[55:29] possess the land because I'm going to
[55:31] keep this covenant.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:34] So after Caleb watched all this failure
[55:37] for 40 more years, then they cross over
[55:41] Jordan and then they're fighting to take
[55:42] the land for another five years.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; But finally, amen, after 45 more years,
[55:47] when he's 85 years old, he comes up to
[55:50] Joshua and says, Joshua, do you remember
[55:52] this is a man that does not forget the
[55:54] promises of God. He does not forget the
[55:56] word. 45 years doesn't change the effect
[56:00] of the word coming through a prophet's
[56:01] mouth to him. Cuz when Moses told him,
[56:03] God through Moses said, "I'm going to
[56:05] give him that inheritance." He believed
[56:07] that word of God that came through that
[56:09] prophet's voice for 45 more years. Amen.
[56:12] 85 years old. And there was not a
[56:14] diminishing of his memory concerning the
[56:16] word of God.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; He may have forgot his children's name
[56:21] and couldn't name him in order, but he
[56:22] remembered what God promised him.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; And that's what God was looking at. And
[56:29] he says, "I'm just as strong today as I
[56:31] was then." Listen, you've got we've got
[56:33] people sitting here, Amen, that's been
[56:35] watching for this promise as it's
[56:36] unfolding for the last 40, 50 years,
[56:39] some maybe in 60 years. But I they're
[56:41] just as strong in faith as they were the
[56:43] day they set out. Strong enough to go to
[56:45] war and come in and go out and take this
[56:48] sword of the word and drive it to the
[56:50] heart of the enemy because the word will
[56:52] never fail.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; If it's been 60 years since the prophet
[56:56] left the scene, it doesn't change
[56:57] anything. We remember the promise.
[57:01] That's right.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Give me this mountain.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And which mountain after 45 years, which
[57:08] mountain did he want? Listen, he
[57:10] describes it cuz you remember there
[57:12] there was the Anakans and there was the
[57:13] great fence cities. He wanted the worst
[57:16] of the worst, the hardest of the hardest
[57:18] where the giants were dwelling in walled
[57:20] cities.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Said, I'll take that one
[57:25] &gt;&gt; because that's the one God gave me. and
[57:28] don't feel sorry for me because I'm 85
[57:30] years old. I still believe the word of
[57:32] God.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; And he said, "If God be with me, I will
[57:35] drive them out."
[57:37] &gt;&gt; He was not looking at himself. He was
[57:40] looking at his promise.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how low down we get
[57:47] and how discouraged we get and how hurt
[57:49] we get. Amen. It doesn't matter how much
[57:52] we feel like we're failing. Keep our
[57:55] eyes on the promise. Amen.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; And confess the word.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Now, let's stand like Joshua
[58:03] &gt;&gt; and Caleb.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; What a stand, friends.
[58:07] Joshua is the end time leader.
[58:10] Amen. That God will bring like Paul
[58:14] and Caleb is those that stay true.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; And it says it didn't say and Caleb
[58:21] represents those that stayed true. It
[58:23] didn't say to Joshua.
[58:25] They stayed true with Joshua
[58:29] &gt;&gt; because Joshua was staying true to the
[58:31] word and Caleb was staying true to the
[58:33] word.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen.
[58:39] Now,
[58:41] let's go to the let's keep keep reading.
[58:44] So, so far today, we've made it through
[58:46] about five lines.
[58:49] Glory to God. Let's stand like Caleb and
[58:52] Joshua. I think we could preach a whole
[58:54] series on stand like Caleb and Joshua.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Remember, God had started Israel as a
[59:00] virgin with his word, but they wanted
[59:02] something different. So did the last day
[59:04] church. Notice how God did not move
[59:06] Israel or let her go into the promised
[59:09] land until it was his own appointed
[59:11] time.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, God's in control of this thing,
[59:14] friends.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; This is what the Holy Spirit's writing
[59:17] through the prophet. He's letting us
[59:19] know that there is an appointing time
[59:21] for everything.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Now, the people might have put pressure
[59:25] on Joshua, the leader, and said, "The
[59:27] land is ours. Let's go and take it.
[59:30] Joshua, you were all through. You must
[59:32] have lost your commission. You don't
[59:34] have the power you used to have. You
[59:36] used to hear from God, and now the will
[59:38] of God and and know the will of God and
[59:39] act quickly." There's a reason brother
[59:42] Brandham said this is the reason this is
[59:44] being written to brother Brandham so he
[59:45] can read this because this has
[59:47] everything to do with his life and where
[59:48] he is in the present stage of his
[59:50] ministry because the revival fires are
[59:52] burning down. He said it's not that you
[59:54] know they used to be burning up the
[59:55] country but it doesn't seem to have the
[59:57] effect that it used to have and it's not
[59:59] going like it was. And he says mine is
[1:00:00] the worst of them all.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; This is the reason this is being written
[1:00:05] like this because this is the answer to
[1:00:07] his question.
[1:00:10] But just like Joshua, the prophet of
[1:00:12] God, Amen, is following a God-given
[1:00:15] process. When Joshua brought them into
[1:00:17] the land, everything was orchestrated by
[1:00:20] God. Joshua wasn't using his own mind.
[1:00:23] Joshua wasn't moving as his own timing.
[1:00:25] Joshua wasn't deciding how to move
[1:00:27] forward. Everything was given to him by
[1:00:29] the Lord. And as it was given to him by
[1:00:31] the Lord, he was leading the people in
[1:00:32] the ways of the Lord.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; And the same thing's true with this end
[1:00:36] time prophet. He would get to a place
[1:00:37] where he'd get hung up and he would be
[1:00:39] hung up. He can't go until God tells him
[1:00:42] what to do.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; In Joshua 1, it says, "Now after the
[1:00:48] death of Moses, the servant of the Lord,
[1:00:49] it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto
[1:00:51] Joshua the son of Nun. Moses minister,
[1:00:54] saying, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now
[1:00:56] therefore, arise, go over this Jordan,
[1:00:58] thou and all this people, into the land
[1:01:00] which I do give them, even the children
[1:01:03] of Israel."
[1:01:04] Joshua wasn't moving because he felt
[1:01:06] like moving.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; And he wasn't going to move just because
[1:01:09] the people said, "Let's go do it."
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; He was waiting for the word of the Lord.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; And Joshua 3:5 says, "And Joshua said
[1:01:18] unto the people, sanctify yourselves,
[1:01:20] for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders
[1:01:22] among you." They were getting ready to
[1:01:24] cross Jordan and cross into the promised
[1:01:26] land. But he brings them back to
[1:01:29] sanctification.
[1:01:31] And he's going to move them through the
[1:01:33] process of God. They're going to come
[1:01:35] through sanctification. They're going to
[1:01:36] cross over Jordan, leaving the world
[1:01:38] behind and move into the promised land.
[1:01:40] And even they're going to go a step
[1:01:42] further by the direction of God. It says
[1:01:44] at that time the Lord said unto Joshua,
[1:01:46] "Make these sharp knives and circumcise
[1:01:49] again the children of Israel the second
[1:01:51] time." Amen. What is he doing? He's
[1:01:53] bringing them back to the seal of the
[1:01:55] covenant
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; because the seal of the covenant was
[1:01:58] circumcision because God made a covenant
[1:02:00] with Abraham. And God sealed Abraham's
[1:02:03] faith with the seal of circumcision. And
[1:02:06] so every male that came forth of the
[1:02:08] lineage of Abraham was circumcised. And
[1:02:10] circumcision was a sign that they were
[1:02:12] part of this covenant. And now as
[1:02:14] they're coming through sanctification
[1:02:16] and they're moving by justification,
[1:02:18] sanctification into the land before they
[1:02:20] go to possess the land, they've got to
[1:02:22] come back under the covenant of Abraham,
[1:02:25] which today is a faith covenant, a faith
[1:02:27] covenant with the seed of Abraham. And
[1:02:29] the seal that confirms God's received
[1:02:32] your faith is the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:34] Ghost. And before you can possess the
[1:02:36] land, we got to come back to
[1:02:38] sanctification, justification,
[1:02:40] sanctification, and the baptism of the
[1:02:42] Holy Ghost. And Joshua couldn't move
[1:02:45] forward till everything was in place.
[1:02:49] The end time, all the word had to be
[1:02:51] restored.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; All the truth, everything that was lost
[1:02:54] had to be brought back. And brother Bam
[1:02:56] wasn't doing it of his own thinking.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; He was leading that church, that bride,
[1:03:02] right through the process of God
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; to bring her all the way back from the
[1:03:07] foundational truth all the way to the
[1:03:10] headstone.
[1:03:12] Praise God. Let's keep reading now.
[1:03:20] He says he he's talking about the
[1:03:22] criticism that Joshua in the end time
[1:03:24] could be getting. You used to hear from
[1:03:26] God and know the will of God and act
[1:03:28] quickly. Something is wrong with you.
[1:03:30] But Joshua was a God-scent prophet and
[1:03:33] he knew the promises of God. So he
[1:03:35] waited for them. He waited for a
[1:03:38] clearcut decision from God. And when the
[1:03:41] time came to move, God placed the full
[1:03:43] leadership in Joshua's hands because he
[1:03:45] had stayed with the word. God could
[1:03:47] trust Joshua but not the others. So it
[1:03:50] will repeat in this end day the same
[1:03:53] problem, the same pressures.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; So glad God had somebody he could get
[1:03:59] control of
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; that wouldn't move till he moved him.
[1:04:02] That wouldn't speak unless he God spoke.
[1:04:05] Amen.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; He says uh in this message at the as and
[1:04:10] the church organizations denominations
[1:04:12] has failed. They'll they'll not take the
[1:04:14] church over. God will raise up a new
[1:04:16] system, an interdenominational system by
[1:04:19] the power of God that'll take the church
[1:04:21] into the promised land. Organizations
[1:04:23] and denominations has messed it up. Each
[1:04:26] one after their own theology, each one
[1:04:28] after their own way of thinking. But God
[1:04:30] will take his Holy Spirit and will raise
[1:04:32] his Joshua. that'll take the church to
[1:04:34] the promise with no denominational
[1:04:36] strings tied anywhere but will take over
[1:04:39] his church.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Back in spoken word, he says, "And I
[1:04:45] don't know where he's going to lead me.
[1:04:47] I don't know. I'm waiting." Remember, we
[1:04:50] talked about where brother Brandon was
[1:04:51] in the stage of his ministry here in
[1:04:52] 1962 and March of ' 62. He says, "I
[1:04:56] don't know where he's going to lead me.
[1:05:00] I don't know. I'm waiting.
[1:05:04] I am so glad this was the character of
[1:05:06] this prophet.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; So that we didn't get another system of
[1:05:10] man and somebody else's idea
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; because somebody would just put the
[1:05:13] brakes on and if God didn't show them,
[1:05:15] they wouldn't do anything.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; And say that they don't know what to do.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; I mean, what a true prophet of God. He
[1:05:25] doesn't have to act for the people and
[1:05:26] act like he knows everything to keep his
[1:05:28] reputation in front of the people. If
[1:05:30] God didn't tell him what to do, he
[1:05:31] didn't know what to do. And he had no
[1:05:32] problem saying, "I don't know what to
[1:05:33] do." Because he was a true prophet
[1:05:35] because he was really hearing from God.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; And when God didn't tell him, he had
[1:05:39] nothing to say. He wasn't making
[1:05:41] anything up.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "I've been waiting for a year."
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. What did he what what what
[1:05:52] transpired in that year in n in the
[1:05:55] beginning of 1961 in January the first
[1:05:59] two messages are Revelation chapter 4
[1:06:01] part 1 and two
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; he comes he goes away ministering away
[1:06:06] the next time he's in Jeffersonville the
[1:06:08] very next time is early in June and he
[1:06:10] preaches Revelation chapter 5 part one
[1:06:12] and two
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; and then he can't go into Revelation 6.
[1:06:17] He's stuck. He can't go until God tells
[1:06:20] him the appointed time
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; because Revelation six is the seals.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now I've been waiting for a
[1:06:27] year."
[1:06:29] He knows something else. He talks about
[1:06:31] it all through Revelation chapter 4 and
[1:06:33] Revelation chapter 5. But he can't move
[1:06:35] on his own.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Says, "I I've been waiting for a year. I
[1:06:42] may wait for two years. I may wait for
[1:06:44] three. I don't know.
[1:06:48] I don't know the next move. I'm waiting
[1:06:50] for it. That thrills my heart.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know the next move. I'm waiting
[1:06:56] for it. But I think according to the
[1:06:58] scripture, the word has been swed. The
[1:07:01] next thing is the coming forth of the
[1:07:02] spirit or what he's referring to as the
[1:07:04] latter rain.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness, I get so excited.
[1:07:10] Now look, here we are in 1965. There's a
[1:07:13] lot of things I want to get into, but
[1:07:14] I'm not not right now. We might get into
[1:07:15] it next time.
[1:07:17] the in the invisible union and and this
[1:07:19] is November of 1965 says you may say
[1:07:22] what's this all got to do with
[1:07:24] thanksgiving this is this thanksgiving
[1:07:26] message what are you talking about
[1:07:28] brother Benham here it is4 to 9 you
[1:07:30] didn't say nothing about thanksgiving
[1:07:32] what a message for the occasion to me
[1:07:35] yes indeed the pilgrim fathers were very
[1:07:38] thankful for their newf found way of
[1:07:39] life being separated from the old
[1:07:41] English denominations and creed they
[1:07:43] could marry to the new anointed word for
[1:07:45] their age. That's right. The new
[1:07:47] anointed word for their age, for their
[1:07:49] day. So, can we be thankful as pilgrims
[1:07:52] like Abraham separated ourselves from
[1:07:54] the things of the world, all of our
[1:07:56] associates? Abraham was a pilgrim. God
[1:07:58] has separated us from all the dead
[1:08:00] religions.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking across the nation now. All
[1:08:04] the dead creeds and to what? Separated
[1:08:06] us and opened to us a new land, a new
[1:08:09] message to this day.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Joshua of the end time had led
[1:08:14] us into the new message, the new land.
[1:08:16] Amen. And what a thanksgiving we should
[1:08:19] be having because of the new land that's
[1:08:22] open to us.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:27] We're not afraid of this land
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; because it's ours.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; It's promised to us. Doesn't matter if
[1:08:36] there's scarecrows on and if there's
[1:08:37] things that people say are scary. It's
[1:08:39] not scary to us. It's our land. This
[1:08:41] message is our land. This word is
[1:08:43] Christ, our husband, our bridegroom, the
[1:08:45] revealed word of the hour and he's
[1:08:47] unveiled himself for us and we're
[1:08:49] partaking of him.
[1:08:52] And so now when brother Bam's here in
[1:08:54] this last paragraph that he read, he's
[1:08:57] talking about the criticism to Joshua
[1:08:59] and he and it's it's referring to his
[1:09:01] own ministry at that stage with the
[1:09:03] revival dying down and people trying to
[1:09:05] push him. Amen. He even he even even has
[1:09:08] this to say and uh this is a message at
[1:09:11] the end of 1955 called the darkest hour
[1:09:14] then Jesus comes along. He talks about a
[1:09:17] conversation he has with a brother.
[1:09:19] Says, "Some time ago I was in a city.
[1:09:21] It's been a number of years now. About
[1:09:23] three or four years ago, very famous
[1:09:25] fine man and a scholar and a student and
[1:09:28] there was a newspaper that had just
[1:09:29] criticized me and said that I was oh, I
[1:09:32] don't know. Everything but a Christian,
[1:09:34] I guess." And the brother when I wrote
[1:09:36] home said, "Brother Brandham, you know
[1:09:38] what I'd do? If I had favor with God
[1:09:40] like that, I'd curse that newspaper and
[1:09:42] have God to burn it down.
[1:09:45] I said, 'Oh, you wouldn't do that.' I
[1:09:47] said, 'I don't believe that's even in
[1:09:49] your heart.' I said, 'I don't believe
[1:09:50] you.' Oh, he said, 'Yes, sir. I said, 'n
[1:09:53] now, brother, the first place, we
[1:09:55] wouldn't want to do that because that
[1:09:56] wouldn't be just like Jesus would want
[1:09:58] to do. You see, he wouldn't want us to
[1:10:01] do that. He said, well, brother
[1:10:02] Brandham, the prophets has changed in
[1:10:04] these last days. Said, we need some
[1:10:07] prophets like Elijah who went up there
[1:10:08] and proved God and called their own fire
[1:10:10] down out of heaven.
[1:10:12] You see, he's criticizing brother
[1:10:14] Brandham
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; because he knows brother Brandham to be
[1:10:17] a prophet of God because of the
[1:10:18] discernment. But he's criticizing him.
[1:10:21] Amen. For not having power, not
[1:10:23] overcoming this all this stuff. But he
[1:10:25] doesn't realize he's dealing with a real
[1:10:27] prophet, not one of these denominational
[1:10:28] prophets.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Who do things for themselves.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; This is a prophet under control. Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, uh,
[1:10:41] we need some prophets like Elijah.
[1:10:44] He started off saying, "The prophets has
[1:10:46] changed in these days." That's
[1:10:47] criticism. That's a little
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; barb.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; I guess prophets aren't like they used
[1:10:52] to be.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; What we need is some prophets like
[1:10:58] Elijah who went up there and proved God.
[1:11:00] Listen, he was talking to Elijah.
[1:11:03] Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; What ignorance.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; We need some prophets like Elijah who
[1:11:08] went up there and proved God and called
[1:11:10] their own fire down out of heaven. I
[1:11:12] said he only done it after he saw a
[1:11:14] vision.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Oh no. He said he just challenged him
[1:11:18] and said I said after he saw the vision,
[1:11:21] brother.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; He said no. I said now watch what he
[1:11:24] laid out all the stuff in order. He said
[1:11:27] Lord I have done all of this at thy
[1:11:29] word. That's right. All at his word. So
[1:11:32] no man, no time ever does anything like
[1:11:35] that unless first it's showed by God.
[1:11:37] Now I mean just acts of faith to go do
[1:11:40] certain things. But I mean something
[1:11:41] definitely that you know is going to
[1:11:43] take place. Brother Benam now is
[1:11:45] teaching this man a lesson. He thinks if
[1:11:47] you have prophet you got power, you
[1:11:49] should be shutting them down and
[1:11:50] shutting their mouth and showing the
[1:11:51] power of God. Hey, listen. The greatest
[1:11:54] power of God that was ever showed was in
[1:11:55] a humble man named Jesus Christ who let
[1:11:57] him spit on him and rip out his beard
[1:11:59] and mock him and make fun of him and go
[1:12:00] to Calvary for you and I because that's
[1:12:02] what his father wanted.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; That was the greatest power that was
[1:12:06] ever manifest in humankind. Not to go
[1:12:09] shut everybody up that criticizes, but
[1:12:10] to stay obedient to the word of the
[1:12:12] father and the will of the father.
[1:12:14] That's power under control.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; That's real power. That's real gifts.
[1:12:18] That's real anointing. Amen. is to stay
[1:12:21] under the control of God. Amen. And God
[1:12:23] is the word and to stay perfectly lined
[1:12:26] up with the word regardless of what we
[1:12:27] think.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; That's what this prophet does. So,
[1:12:31] there's some poking around and then
[1:12:33] brother Bham starts talking in this
[1:12:34] interim period about things are slowing
[1:12:36] down. There's not many open doors and
[1:12:38] and all this stuff happening. He's
[1:12:40] talking about the criticism coming to
[1:12:41] Joshua trying to push him forward.
[1:12:43] Brother Brennham himself is feeling the
[1:12:45] urge. He's feeling a transition. and
[1:12:47] he's feeling something and he's talking
[1:12:48] about it not knowing we swed the seed
[1:12:51] we've got this I've got him on a limb I
[1:12:53] don't know what he's feeling it himself
[1:12:55] and then he's feeling the criticism and
[1:12:57] say why aren't the meetings like they
[1:12:59] used to be it used to be so glor gl
[1:13:01] glamorous we'd go into a city and
[1:13:03] thousands and miracle lines and all of
[1:13:05] this stuff and he himself is feeling the
[1:13:08] pressure that's what that's what that's
[1:13:10] what the spirit is revealing to him here
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; and he says said, "But Joshua would not
[1:13:20] move without a clearcut decision."
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; That's why this prophet, Amen, he had to
[1:13:27] wait. He he was looking at the seals
[1:13:31] knowing that that has to be revealed,
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; He's he's he's he's looking at his own
[1:13:36] ministry and what God's doing. He's
[1:13:38] piecing it all together. He has some
[1:13:40] questions and he has some concerns and
[1:13:42] he doesn't know what all it means, but
[1:13:44] he knows he's got to go another step
[1:13:45] further. He doesn't know how to get
[1:13:47] there because he can't make up what the
[1:13:48] mystery is in those seven thunders.
[1:13:53] And so God starts coming to him in a
[1:13:56] dream. And remember, he has the dream
[1:13:58] about his family sitting in the parish
[1:14:00] prairie schooner after his uh gate is
[1:14:03] all busted up. There's rocks all around.
[1:14:04] He goes out west. And he says, "When you
[1:14:06] see this, head west." And then people
[1:14:08] start coming to him starting in I think
[1:14:10] September, October of 1962. And they
[1:14:13] start bringing him dreams. And every
[1:14:14] dream starts to point to either a
[1:14:17] marriage, amen, and a feast or or uh him
[1:14:20] being the immortal Elijah or or all of
[1:14:22] these uh uh and Junior Jackson's dream
[1:14:25] about the pyramid in the W. All of these
[1:14:26] dreams have to do with this transition
[1:14:29] into the prophetic ministry and the
[1:14:31] opening of the seals.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; And there's he says six dreams right in
[1:14:35] a row. Six dreams right in a row without
[1:14:37] anybody coming in between over several
[1:14:39] weeks period of time. And then
[1:14:43] all of a sudden he sees somebody driving
[1:14:45] a survey stake out in his yard and he
[1:14:46] goes and talk to the man and the man
[1:14:48] says they're going to widen the road and
[1:14:51] they're going to take out your gate. He
[1:14:53] says, "Oh, I'll get Brother Wood to move
[1:14:55] the gate." He says, "No, let the city
[1:14:57] take care of that. Don't touch it and
[1:14:59] we're going to have to take it all out.
[1:15:00] We're going to take it all out. Take the
[1:15:02] gate." And he walks back in the house.
[1:15:03] He tells his wife, "I think there I have
[1:15:05] a vision, something about this." and he
[1:15:07] goes to his little book and reads the
[1:15:08] vision and he remembers the dream and
[1:15:10] the vision when this happens, turn west.
[1:15:12] And he comes and he tells it all to the
[1:15:14] church. Amen. In the uh in December, I
[1:15:17] think December uh 31st in the morning
[1:15:19] service, he comes and he tells the
[1:15:21] church and he says, "I'm going out
[1:15:22] west." Amen. There's a brother out there
[1:15:24] looking for a place. He couldn't do it
[1:15:26] until God gave him the specific time.
[1:15:29] Even though he knows it's transition
[1:15:31] time, he knows it's coming and he's
[1:15:32] feeling the pressure all around and the
[1:15:34] healing ministry is diminishing and all
[1:15:36] the revival ministry is diminishing, but
[1:15:38] there's something else coming, but he
[1:15:40] can't himself go there.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:15:50] do you ever feel like something's
[1:15:51] coming, friends?
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; You ever feel like God's got something
[1:15:54] for us? Amen. There's a manifestation
[1:15:56] coming. Amen. We got to take our stand
[1:15:58] on the word. But listen, we can't do
[1:16:00] anything by ourselves. All we can do is
[1:16:03] hold fast like Caleb. Amen. And hold to
[1:16:06] the promise of God and believe every
[1:16:07] word of God and all the possibilities.
[1:16:10] And God, we she knows that it has to be
[1:16:13] God and her
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; fulfilling his own works.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; So we saw a prophet now, he's got to
[1:16:23] move by the will of God.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And here he is before all of this
[1:16:26] happens. All of this is going to happen
[1:16:28] in about seven or about eight or nine
[1:16:31] months from now.
[1:16:33] And now let's go to paragraph 173-1.
[1:16:37] He says, "Take the example we see in
[1:16:39] Moses, the mighty anointed prophet of
[1:16:41] God, had a peculiar birth, being born at
[1:16:44] the right time for the deliverance of
[1:16:46] Abraham's seed from Egypt. He never
[1:16:48] stayed in Egypt to argue scripture with
[1:16:50] them, nor fuss with the priest. He went
[1:16:53] to the wilderness until the people were
[1:16:54] ready to receive him. God called Moses
[1:16:57] to the wilderness. The waiting was not
[1:16:59] on Moses's part, but because of the
[1:17:01] people who were not ready to receive
[1:17:03] him. Moses thought the people would
[1:17:05] understand, but they did not. Remember,
[1:17:08] the spirit, the Holy Spirit is giving
[1:17:11] brother Brandham the answer to his
[1:17:13] question.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Now he's realizing why he's pulled back,
[1:17:17] why the the invitations has died down,
[1:17:20] why the revival's died down. He now
[1:17:22] realizes and he's starting to show him
[1:17:23] Bible principles and examples from the
[1:17:26] scripture of where he's at.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; He says in invisible union, he says what
[1:17:32] did he do? He opened up the seven seals
[1:17:34] of the last message. You notice that the
[1:17:37] seven seals which all the mysteries of
[1:17:39] the seven church ages was sealed with
[1:17:41] seven seals. The reformers didn't have
[1:17:43] time to do it in their days. They didn't
[1:17:44] live long enough. But this blessed
[1:17:46] revelation of the seven seals is open to
[1:17:48] us in this last days from a prophecy
[1:17:51] that went forth to Arizona. How I asked
[1:17:54] God the other day, "What are you doing
[1:17:55] with me out here in this desert? Where
[1:17:58] did Moses go?" Desert.
[1:18:03] Where did Elijah go? Desert. Where did
[1:18:05] the Apostle Paul go? Desert. Where did
[1:18:08] God send brother? To the desert. Amen.
[1:18:10] You see the pattern? Yeah. Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; What are you doing with me out here in
[1:18:15] the desert? Did you know Moses wrote the
[1:18:17] New Testament or the Old Testament? He
[1:18:18] certainly did. First four books gives
[1:18:20] the law, everything. Genesis, Exodus,
[1:18:22] Leviticus, Deuteronomy. He wrote the Old
[1:18:24] Testament. To do that, he had to leave
[1:18:26] all of his associates and loved ones and
[1:18:28] go into the desert. Paul wrote the New
[1:18:30] Testament. That's right. And he wrote
[1:18:32] Romans and Romans and all the rest of
[1:18:34] their Hebrews and Timothy and so forth.
[1:18:36] And to do that, he had to separate from
[1:18:38] himself and go down into Arabia into a
[1:18:40] desert for three years to get the
[1:18:42] revelation of God. Oh, you say, "How
[1:18:44] about Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John?"
[1:18:46] They they were scribes that just wrote
[1:18:47] what Jesus did. Paul separated, put the
[1:18:49] word together. That's right. Well, then
[1:18:51] look, if it taken that and had to go to
[1:18:54] a desert away from their loved ones,
[1:18:56] remember that what time is it, sir?
[1:18:58] That's the message when he talks about
[1:18:59] he's going out west to get the
[1:19:01] revelation of the unwritten word under
[1:19:03] the under the pyramid. Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; They we've got the re I'm sorry. You
[1:19:09] remember what time is it, sir? How many
[1:19:12] ever heard it? Say amen. What is it
[1:19:14] exactly? Right then. We've got the
[1:19:16] revelation in the last days for the
[1:19:18] message of the Lord God to gather his
[1:19:20] bride together. No other age has it been
[1:19:23] promised. It's promised in this age.
[1:19:25] Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, St. John 4:12,
[1:19:29] Joel 2:38. these promises is just
[1:19:31] exactly like John the Baptist
[1:19:33] identifying himself in the scriptures.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; What was it? It was our messenger, the
[1:19:39] end time messenger and the forerunner of
[1:19:41] the coming of the Lord identifying
[1:19:43] himself in the scriptures. Where did
[1:19:45] John go before his ministry to the
[1:19:47] desert?
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; And he had to wait for the right time.
[1:19:55] That means when he come forth for the
[1:19:57] opening of the seals, it was the right
[1:19:59] time.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; That means it was the time for Messiah
[1:20:03] to come. It was the coming of the Lord.
[1:20:05] It was time for him to leave the
[1:20:08] churches and unite with his bride and
[1:20:09] now finish his work in her.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't have moved if it wasn't
[1:20:13] time. But because he moved, it was time.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:19] Praise God.
[1:20:21] Okay, let's let's let's
[1:20:25] finish.
[1:20:27] Oh my goodness.
[1:20:29] I didn't make it very far.
[1:20:32] I want to do one more paragraph.
[1:20:37] Then there is Elijah to whom the word of
[1:20:39] the Lord came. When he got through
[1:20:42] preaching the truth and that group back
[1:20:43] there that is the forerunner of the
[1:20:45] American Jezebel group would not receive
[1:20:47] the word, God called him off the field
[1:20:49] and plagued that generation for
[1:20:51] rejecting the prophet and the message
[1:20:53] that God had given. God called him to
[1:20:55] the wilderness and he could not come out
[1:20:58] even for the king. Those who tried to
[1:21:00] persuade him to do so died. But God
[1:21:02] spoke to his faithful prophet by vision.
[1:21:04] Out of hiding he came and brought back
[1:21:06] the word to Israel.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; What do you think this is referring to?
[1:21:11] Everything else, all the other types are
[1:21:12] referring to Moses, John the Baptist,
[1:21:14] Paul. Amen. Uh Joshua, it's referring to
[1:21:18] the ministry of brother Brandham.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; And I just want to look at First Kings
[1:21:25] as we wrap up. We're going to finish
[1:21:26] here with the scripture. First Kings
[1:21:29] chapter 17. Let's turn there together.
[1:21:34] First Kings chapter 17
[1:21:37] verse one.
[1:21:46] My my my
[1:21:49] first Kings 17:1
[1:21:52] and Elijah the Tishbite who was of the
[1:21:54] inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab,
[1:21:56] "As the Lord God of Israel liveth,
[1:21:58] before whom I stand, there shall not be
[1:22:00] due nor rain these years, but according
[1:22:02] to my word." And the word of the Lord
[1:22:05] came unto him, saying,"Get thee hence,
[1:22:07] and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself
[1:22:09] by the brook Cherith that is before
[1:22:11] Jordan." God was sending him into the
[1:22:15] wilderness and hiding him away while
[1:22:18] everything dried up.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Remember what brother Brandon was
[1:22:21] talking about? The seeds been planted,
[1:22:23] the revival fires are dying down. It's
[1:22:24] drying up. Everything's pulling back.
[1:22:26] Amen. And he's he's waiting, but he's
[1:22:29] got to come back. Amen. And Elijah went
[1:22:31] and waited during the dry period. But
[1:22:34] when it was when it come to the end of
[1:22:36] the dry period, Elijah was going to come
[1:22:38] back
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; out of hiding. All of this the spirit is
[1:22:42] trying to use these type to show brother
[1:22:43] Benham where he's at.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; All right, let's read over in chapter 18
[1:22:50] now.
[1:22:53] So while he was away hiding in church,
[1:22:56] there was a drought going on. It was a
[1:22:59] dryness. no revival fires.
[1:23:02] Everything was stale and dry.
[1:23:06] In First Kings 18:1, he says, "And it
[1:23:08] came to pass after many days that the
[1:23:10] word of the Lord came to Elijah in the
[1:23:12] third year, saying, go show thyself unto
[1:23:15] Ahab, and I will send rain upon the
[1:23:17] earth. And Elijah went to show himself
[1:23:19] unto Ahab, and there was a sore famine
[1:23:22] in Samaria." So in the dry period,
[1:23:25] everything had gone dry. The revival
[1:23:26] fires died down. Everything was becoming
[1:23:29] desperate. Amen. But God says, "I'm
[1:23:31] going to bring rain upon the earth. You
[1:23:33] go show yourself now because rain's
[1:23:35] coming."
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 17.
[1:23:38] And it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah
[1:23:40] that Ahab said unto him, "Art thou he
[1:23:43] that troubleth Israel?" And he answered,
[1:23:45] "I have not troubled Israel, but thou in
[1:23:47] thy father's house, and that you have
[1:23:49] forsaken the commandments of the Lord,
[1:23:51] and thou hast followed Balum. Now
[1:23:53] therefore send and gather to me all
[1:23:55] Israel unto Mount Carmel and the
[1:23:57] prophets of Baal 450
[1:24:00] and the prophets of the gross 400 which
[1:24:03] sat at Jezebel's table.
[1:24:06] So
[1:24:08] uh yeah I want to read one more. So Ahab
[1:24:11] sent unto all the children of Israel and
[1:24:14] gathered the prophets together unto
[1:24:16] Mount Carmel. Verse 21. And Elijah came
[1:24:20] unto all the people and said, "How long
[1:24:22] wil you how long halt you between two
[1:24:24] opinions? If the Lord be God, follow
[1:24:27] him. But if Baal, then follow him." And
[1:24:29] the people answered him, "Not a word."
[1:24:31] Then said Elijah and to the people, "I
[1:24:34] even I only remain a prophet of the
[1:24:36] Lord. But Baal's prophets are 450
[1:24:39] men." Listen, this is brother Brandham
[1:24:42] now under the under the ministry of
[1:24:43] Elijah in the end time. and he's come
[1:24:46] here and now he's come back at the time
[1:24:48] of the Lord to come for the opening of
[1:24:50] the seals. And listen, he stands as the
[1:24:52] only prophet of the Lord.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; And all the other preachers and all the
[1:24:57] other denominations and everything
[1:24:59] stands against him. But there's one
[1:25:01] prophet of the Lord. Amen. Who's come at
[1:25:03] the end of the dry period because
[1:25:05] there's going to come rain on the earth
[1:25:06] again. And his coming to Carmel shows
[1:25:09] that there's a rain about to fall. Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; And he does it all at the bidding of the
[1:25:15] Lord.
[1:25:17] And he says, now he says, why halt you
[1:25:19] between two opinions? This is where he's
[1:25:21] coming to now. This is where the Elijah
[1:25:23] and our day come to. He says, the
[1:25:25] denomination systems dead. The systems
[1:25:27] of man are dead. You've got to separate
[1:25:29] from that. Why halt you between two
[1:25:31] opinions? Stop with the Jezebel
[1:25:34] religion. Stop with the idolatry and
[1:25:36] come back to the word.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; That's what the call is. Elijah on Mount
[1:25:40] Carmel is trying to call them back to
[1:25:42] the original word. And it wasn't that
[1:25:44] they weren't serving the Lord, but they
[1:25:46] had mixed it with the service of Baal.
[1:25:48] He said, "If Baal be God, serve him. If
[1:25:50] if the Lord be God, serve him." Just
[1:25:52] pick who you're going to serve. Stop
[1:25:54] mixing it together. And what do we have?
[1:25:56] We have hybrid religion in the day, a
[1:25:58] mixture, amen, of Jezebel religion,
[1:26:01] which was balumism, then come from the
[1:26:02] Catholic Church, mixed into all
[1:26:04] Protestantism, and mixed with worship of
[1:26:06] the Lord. And now Elijah on Mount
[1:26:08] Carmel's coming back at the appointed
[1:26:10] time. He's come out of hiding after the
[1:26:12] revival died down because it's time for
[1:26:15] rain to fall. And he says, "Now you
[1:26:17] choose this day what you're going to do.
[1:26:19] Are you going to see the go all the way
[1:26:20] in the bail or you going to come all the
[1:26:22] way back to the original word."
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; What a day we live in, friends.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Verse 30.
[1:26:33] And Elijah said unto all the people,
[1:26:34] "Come near unto me." And all the people
[1:26:36] came near unto him and
[1:26:39] and he repaired
[1:26:42] the altar of the Lord that was broken
[1:26:44] down.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; He brought back the original worship the
[1:26:48] correct way.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Which is what Elijah in our day did.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; He repaired the altar of the Lord that
[1:26:54] had been broken down. And Elijah took 12
[1:26:57] stones according to the number of the
[1:26:59] tribes of the sons of Jacob and to whom
[1:27:01] the word of the Lord came, saying,
[1:27:02] "Israel shall be thy name." And with the
[1:27:05] stones he built an altar in the name of
[1:27:06] the Lord. He made a trench about the
[1:27:09] altar as great as would contain two
[1:27:11] measures of seed. And he put wood in the
[1:27:13] order and cut the bulllock in pieces and
[1:27:15] laid him on the wood. And laid him on
[1:27:18] the wood and said, "Fill four barrels
[1:27:20] with water. Pour it on the burnt
[1:27:21] sacrifice and on the wood." And he said,
[1:27:23] "Do it the second time." And they did it
[1:27:25] the second time. And he said, "Do it the
[1:27:27] third time." And they did it the third
[1:27:29] time. And the water ran round about the
[1:27:31] altar and filled the trench also with
[1:27:33] water. And it came to pass at the time
[1:27:36] of the offering of the evening sacrifice
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; in the evening time.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; In the evening time after he repaired
[1:27:47] the altar of the Lord when the fire
[1:27:49] revival fires died down there was a
[1:27:51] drought and when God had sent him back
[1:27:53] because there was going to be rain.
[1:27:55] Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; You see why, brother? Do you see why the
[1:27:58] Holy Spirit pointed him to this?
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; In the e time of the evening sacrifice,
[1:28:04] Elijah the prophet came near and said,
[1:28:07] Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
[1:28:09] let it be known this day that thou art
[1:28:11] God in Israel, and that I am thy
[1:28:13] servant, and that I have done all these
[1:28:15] things at thy word. Hear me, oh Lord.
[1:28:18] Hear me that this people may know that
[1:28:20] thou art the Lord God and that thou has
[1:28:22] turned their heart back again.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; What is the ministry of Elijah at the
[1:28:27] end times? To turn the hearts of the
[1:28:29] children back to the fathers.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Verse 38. Then the fire of God fell and
[1:28:37] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:28:39] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:28:42] licked up the water that was in the
[1:28:43] trench. And when all the people saw it,
[1:28:45] they fell on their faces and they said,
[1:28:47] "The Lord, he is God. The Lord, he is
[1:28:50] God."
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; God showed himself. Amen. Let's go to
[1:28:53] verse 41 now.
[1:28:56] And Elijah said unto Ahab, "Get thee up,
[1:28:59] eat, and drink, for there is a sound of
[1:29:03] abundance of rain."
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. When it were when the word was
[1:29:07] restored, when Elijah came out of
[1:29:09] hiding, when he come to Mount Carmel
[1:29:10] showdown, when he brought him back to
[1:29:12] the original faith, when he brought him
[1:29:14] back from mixed religion to pure
[1:29:15] religion, Amen. And he did it all at
[1:29:18] God's word and the impossible was done.
[1:29:20] Then he says, "Now the rain's going to
[1:29:22] fall." So Ahab went up to to eat and to
[1:29:26] drink.
[1:29:28] And Elijah went up to top of Carmel and
[1:29:30] he cast himself down upon the earth and
[1:29:32] put his face between his knees. And he
[1:29:34] said to his servant, "Go up now. Look
[1:29:36] toward the sea." And he went up and he
[1:29:38] looked and he said, "There's nothing."
[1:29:40] He said, "Go again seven times."
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass at the seventh time
[1:29:46] in the seventh church age.
[1:29:49] This
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; has to do with the seventh seal.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; The seventh time that he said, "Behold,
[1:29:55] there ariseth a little cloud out of the
[1:29:58] sea like a man's hand." And he said, "Go
[1:30:01] up, say unto him, prepare thy chariot
[1:30:03] and get thee down, that the rain stopped
[1:30:06] thee not." Amen. What was the sign that
[1:30:09] the rain was coming? There was a cloud.
[1:30:11] Amen. There was a cloud. Amen. When And
[1:30:14] the seventh time, the seventh time he
[1:30:16] looked and the seventh under the seventh
[1:30:18] seal in the seventh church, there was a
[1:30:21] cloud that announced that rain was
[1:30:23] coming.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, Amen. God mean by the
[1:30:29] Holy Spirit. Brother Brandham is sitting
[1:30:30] in this spot where he doesn't know what
[1:30:32] the next step is. He doesn't know how to
[1:30:34] get there. He doesn't know what's going.
[1:30:36] So the Holy Spirit says, "Listen, you're
[1:30:38] just in a place like Moses was." Amen.
[1:30:40] Waiting for something. You're in a place
[1:30:42] like John the Baptist was waiting to
[1:30:44] come out and announce the Messiah.
[1:30:45] You're where Paul was waiting to come
[1:30:47] out with the true word. Amen. You're
[1:30:48] where Elijah was waiting to come and
[1:30:51] bring the Mount Carmel showdown so that
[1:30:53] the rain can fall again because it's
[1:30:54] time for the latter rain revival.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:00] Oh, the spirit knew what he was saying
[1:31:02] when he told brother man. And brother
[1:31:03] Ben picked it up and said, "That's
[1:31:05] exactly what I was looking for. That's
[1:31:06] just it. That's the answer to my
[1:31:08] question."
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. If I read one more
[1:31:17] thing,
[1:31:21] we won't go nowhere.
[1:31:24] Oh, friends. I love this word. Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; I love this message. I love everything
[1:31:29] God has done. He's made himself so real.
[1:31:31] All we have to do is open our eyes and
[1:31:33] see what he's done. Amen. And consider
[1:31:36] what it is God's done and what it means.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; It's more than life to us, friends. This
[1:31:43] is everything. There's no human being
[1:31:45] can orchestrate all of this.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; There's no body that can put this plan
[1:31:50] together. And listen, he had it recorded
[1:31:53] before it happened. Amen. It it was he
[1:31:55] he was living his life out. He was just
[1:31:57] a normal man. I don't mean that in any
[1:32:00] disregard. He was a prophet of God, but
[1:32:02] he was a human being like you and I are
[1:32:04] human beings. And if God didn't show
[1:32:05] him, he didn't know what was coming
[1:32:06] next. He's just living his life asking
[1:32:08] God's questions, taking one step at a
[1:32:10] time. Amen. And and and he's so
[1:32:12] desperate now when he gets the spoken
[1:32:14] word original seed that he doesn't know
[1:32:16] what to do next because he knows it's
[1:32:18] finished. He knows it's done. He knows
[1:32:19] it won't work anymore. that God's got to
[1:32:21] change the order, but he doesn't know
[1:32:23] how he's going to change it. Amen. So
[1:32:25] God says, "Pick up your pen. You can't
[1:32:27] figure this out with your own mind, but
[1:32:28] pick up your pen and I'm going to work
[1:32:30] through you, and I'm going to give you
[1:32:31] the answer to your question."
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; And the answer to your question is, you
[1:32:36] are the end time prophet. And your life
[1:32:38] is going to manifest what all the other
[1:32:39] prophets manifest down through time. And
[1:32:42] it's coming a time for this bride to
[1:32:43] come forth.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; And you're the key.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Like John the Baptist was the keystone.
[1:32:50] You're the key.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; To bring the transition.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God, friends.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; I say we're the most blessed people
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; ever walked the earth. So many of God's
[1:33:03] children were caught up in God's plan,
[1:33:05] living God's plan day by day. They even
[1:33:07] wrote the scriptures after them and we
[1:33:09] read it and that's the word of God.
[1:33:11] Amen. But they didn't know what they
[1:33:12] were doing. But we're in a different
[1:33:14] place because we've had a prophet to
[1:33:15] reveal to us who we are, where we're at,
[1:33:18] and what God's plan is for today.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; We may not have the answer to every
[1:33:22] question, but we got enough answers to
[1:33:24] keep moving forward without answers to
[1:33:26] questions.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; I may not know what I'm supposed to do
[1:33:29] tomorrow. I may not know how I'm going
[1:33:31] to fix the problem that's facing me in
[1:33:33] my life. But I know who I am, and I know
[1:33:35] who's living in me. And I know what he's
[1:33:37] trying to accomplish. and all I got to
[1:33:39] do is hold steady and believe and keep
[1:33:41] moving forward with faith and God will
[1:33:43] overcome.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; He told the He told the Israelites, "I
[1:33:47] will drive out the enemies. Now you go
[1:33:49] up and you possess the land and as you
[1:33:52] move forward, I'll move them out. But
[1:33:53] when they stop moving forward, he
[1:33:55] stopped moving them out."
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. They lost heart. They lost sight.
[1:34:00] But oh, this bride's not going to cuz
[1:34:02] she's predestinated not to. Yeah,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; we're going to keep moving forward and
[1:34:08] believing that God is going to have his
[1:34:10] way with me.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; He's going to live in me. He's going to
[1:34:14] manifest himself in me. He's going to
[1:34:16] overcome through me.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, he didn't just do all of that for
[1:34:23] brother Brandham.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; He did all of that for you and me.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; He didn't just bring John the Baptist
[1:34:31] for John the Baptist. He brought John
[1:34:32] the Baptist for the elect to hear that
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; the lamb of God is here.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; He didn't just bring Moses on the scene
[1:34:41] for Moses. He brought Moses on the scene
[1:34:43] for the promise to be confirmed to the
[1:34:45] children of Abraham.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't just bring brother Brandham in
[1:34:51] the end time to call him the seventh
[1:34:52] angel so he could get a special
[1:34:53] position.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; He brought him to show us where we are.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Who we are. Yes.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; So that we can live by faith. So that we
[1:35:04] can make our stand like Joshua and Caleb
[1:35:06] made their stand.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; How many want to make that stand like
[1:35:10] Caleb?
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; We're more than able.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; God delight in us. The enemy is bred for
[1:35:18] us.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; God be praised. Let's bow our heads
[1:35:21] together.
[1:35:24] Dear Lord Jesus, I'm so thankful God for
[1:35:27] this word that you've given to us. I'm
[1:35:29] so thankful, God, that you
[1:35:32] have let us in on private conversations
[1:35:35] you've had with your prophet,
[1:35:38] God. You revealed so much, Lord, through
[1:35:41] that ministry,
[1:35:43] through your word, Lord, as you opened
[1:35:44] it up through a prophetic ministry so
[1:35:46] that we could rejoice in all the things
[1:35:49] that we see,
[1:35:51] God. He suffered with not knowing. He
[1:35:54] was troubled and perplexed, Lord, so
[1:35:57] that we could see that you hold the
[1:35:59] answer and that you hold the timing in
[1:36:02] your hand and that all things work out
[1:36:04] perfect.
[1:36:05] And God, now that we stand in our place
[1:36:07] and it's our time and this is our
[1:36:09] position, may we have the same
[1:36:12] confidence just as we watched you work
[1:36:13] through that prophet's life. May we have
[1:36:15] the same confidence you're working in
[1:36:17] our lives that you have the answer to
[1:36:20] the question. You know what the next
[1:36:21] step is. You know what's going coming
[1:36:23] next and what you're going to do in us
[1:36:25] and through us.
[1:36:27] God, I pray that you would help us to
[1:36:29] make our stand like Joshua and Caleb did
[1:36:33] that. Knowing all that we know, all that
[1:36:35] you've revealed, may we just stand upon
[1:36:37] the promise in your word and stand with
[1:36:39] faith and move forward with confidence
[1:36:42] and joy, excited to see what you're
[1:36:45] going to do next. For God, you've never
[1:36:47] been defeated and you've never failed to
[1:36:49] keep your promise. We love you. We ask
[1:36:52] your blessings upon this congregation.
[1:36:54] Pray you watch over them, Lord. Pray you
[1:36:56] bless us in our absence, Lord. And you
[1:36:58] bless the ministry that'll be here. And
[1:37:01] God, may you just rejoice in all that
[1:37:03] you're revealing and all that you're
[1:37:04] showing and all that you're doing. May
[1:37:06] it become the enthusiasm of our lives
[1:37:09] and the excitement that possesses our
[1:37:11] attention. Lord, may nothing else grip
[1:37:13] our attention like this word. May
[1:37:16] everything else be second and third and
[1:37:18] fourth and may it be low in comparison
[1:37:20] to the enthusiasm and excitement we have
[1:37:22] for this revelation.
[1:37:24] We love you, God. We yield ourselves to
[1:37:27] you all over again and ask that you
[1:37:29] would take your possession and do with
[1:37:31] it as you wish. We love you. We thank
[1:37:34] you. May you have preeminence in us. We
[1:37:37] pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:37:41] Amen. God bless you all. Love you so
[1:37:43] much. Amen. Brother John,
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; make yourself ready
[1:37:50] with a sanctified
[1:37:52] life
[1:37:56] completely set apart. This world is not
[1:38:01] your home.
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:04] He's calling you
[1:38:07] to be

[1:39:15] to be
[1:39:17] separated
[1:39:21] for you are his
[1:39:23] and his
[1:39:25] alone.
[1:39:28] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[1:39:34] forever. I will sing.
[1:39:39] Oh, I will sing.

[1:39:58] will I make known
[1:40:02] thy faithfulness.

[1:41:19] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[1:41:23] forever. I will sing of the mercies of
[1:41:28] the Lord.
[1:41:30] And can't you see
[1:41:33] why
[1:41:35] I'm so happy?
[1:41:39] For I've accepted
[1:41:42] the word
[1:41:44] of the Lord.
[1:41:48] The revealed
[1:41:51] word that was spoken.
[1:41:57] Oh, by the prophet
[1:42:00] of Malachi
[1:42:02] 4.
[1:42:05] Oh, can't you see

[1:42:32] by the prophet
[1:42:35] of Malachi
[1:42:38] 4.
