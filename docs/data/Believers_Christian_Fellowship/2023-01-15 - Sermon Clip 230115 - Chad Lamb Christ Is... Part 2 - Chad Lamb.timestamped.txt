[0:00] Nicodemus saying unto him how can a man
[0:02] be born when he is old can he enter the
[0:04] second time into his mother's womb and
[0:06] be born Jesus answered verily verily I
[0:08] say unto thee accept a man be born of
[0:10] water and of spirit he cannot enter the
[0:12] kingdom of God that which is born of the
[0:14] flesh is flesh that which is born of the
[0:16] spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said
[0:19] unto thee thou must be born again the
[0:22] wind bloweth where it listeth and thou
[0:24] Hearst the sound thereof but cast not
[0:26] tell whence it come and whether it goeth
[0:28] so is every one that is born of the
[0:31] spirit
[0:32] the spiritual birth is invisible
[0:35] it doesn't work like the physical birth
[0:38] and he says You must be born again and
[0:40] Nicodemus said he says how can a man
[0:42] when he's old be born again in through
[0:44] the second time in his mother's womb he
[0:45] says no be born of the spirit and it's
[0:47] like the wind the wind comes from
[0:50] somewhere and it goes somewhere you have
[0:52] no idea where it started and where it
[0:54] ended and you try to go go ask a
[0:56] meteorologist to tell you the starting
[0:57] point of wind
[1:00] on the earth and the ending point
[1:02] that wind started here on the map and it
[1:05] ended here on the map it works totally
[1:08] different than anything we understand I
[1:10] I don't know how it started I don't know
[1:12] where it ended but one thing we know is
[1:14] that when it blows through the tree I
[1:15] see the effect of it
[1:17] I see that the wind and you can say
[1:19] there is the wind you're not seeing the
[1:22] wind you're seeing the effect of the
[1:24] Wind
[1:25] and the effect of the wind lets you know
[1:27] that's where the wind is
[1:29] so he says so is everybody that's born
[1:31] of the spirit he that's born of the
[1:33] spirit you don't know where he came from
[1:34] you're not seeing where he's going
[1:35] because his life didn't start on this
[1:38] Earth his life started before and will
[1:40] continue beyond
[1:42] but what you're seeing in the spiritual
[1:44] birth amen is the birth has come to him
[1:46] amen and quickened the seed the part of
[1:48] him that was meant to be him from the
[1:50] beginning has come to life by coming
[1:52] encounter with the word for his day and
[1:55] now that part has started somewhere
[1:57] before and when it's like the wind
[2:00] and you can't see where a man starts and
[2:02] where he finishes but you can see the
[2:04] rustled of the leaves and say that's the
[2:06] wind right there and you can see the
[2:08] life that a person lives and say that's
[2:10] Jesus Christ in my brother and my sister
