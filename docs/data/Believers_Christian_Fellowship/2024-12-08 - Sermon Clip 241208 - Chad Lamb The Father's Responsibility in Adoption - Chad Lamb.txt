========================================

boy I tried him this way and I tried him that way I throwed him down Sick I put him under I stomped him I let the devil do everything to him he could do he came right back up again listen okay remember what adoption is the father wants this son to inherit either all the kingdom or a portion of the of the estate and so he gives him to the best tutor he can to bring the out into position to take the position he has for him so what does this best tutor do here's what he does I've throw him down sick I've put him under I've stomped on him I let the devil do everything to him I could do he came right back up again oh praise God you mean this Troublesome life that I've been living it isn't outside the desire of God it means it's part of God shaping me for the work he wants me to do it means this isn't a pointless series of a bunch of bad things happening in my life absolutely not friends it is ordained of God under the tutelage of the Holy Ghost and he's bringing us just as Jesus Christ was led to the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil God has a plan for us and a position we must fit into and we've got to learn how to follow the father's business and keep his instructions despite whatever happens to us you know what's so discouraging what becomes so discour enaging is trial after trial after trial with no purpose it's just an endless cycle of pain and confusion and disappointments but when the isav comes on when the word of God comes the clear away the crust off our eyes we don't see it as an endless cycle of pain and confusion and suffering we see it as a Godly plan to bring us into a great position he had for before the foundation of the world because if God's got to shape me in mold me to bring me to a body change to sit with him on his throne then I say God shape me God mold me if you got to stomp me down if you got to put me under if you got to cause rejection to come whatever Christ went through do you think we're not going to go through Jesus Christ and his pilgrimage he come down the the the the spirit descended like a dove claimed this vessel dwelt in the vessel what a glorious thing from then on it was nothing but trouble we don't even hear much about Jesus's life previous to his baptism and previous to his baptism we only have one little interjection and that's when he was 12 amen uh disputing with them in the temple amen but we we don't have any reason to believe that for 30 years it was like it was after after he was claimed as a son after amen he was infilled with the fullness of God after he was declared to be the son whom I'm well pleased we do have record of that life from then on and go read the record and tell me when did he have A Moment's Peace why he was being shaped molded tested proved because God had something wonderful and glorious for him to do
