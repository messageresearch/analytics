[15:26] I claims
[15:30] in Jesus shed on
[15:38] those precious blood 's needs
[15:44] mermaid they're just for me
[15:51] for all my sins
[15:56] my sickness
[15:59] in my name
[16:04] when I eat healing
[16:08] I just blame those precious
[16:17] I have a soul
[16:21] of strength when I am
[16:29] me it helps me through when life is
[16:38] pressing me
[16:40] [Applause]
[16:43] I have a soul
[16:47] of
[16:48] power
[16:50] from above
[16:56] uncovered over
[17:01] by a shield of blood
[17:08] I believe the blood
[17:13] Jesus shed on Calvary
[17:21] those precious floods
[17:26] were made they're just for me
[17:32] [Music]
[17:33] before
[17:39] my sickness
[17:49] [Music]
[17:51] I just claim those friends
[17:57] [Music]
[17:59] I do not know
[18:04] how others make it through
[18:12] who
[18:13] never
[18:15] go
[18:17] to
[18:18] Calvary as I do
[18:25] for there's a key you
[18:31] and things dream which flows
[18:38] with peace
[18:43] [Music]
[18:44] [Applause]
[18:54] [Music]
[18:56] [Applause]
[18:57] [Music]
[19:05] [Music]
[19:08] were made they're just for me
[19:17] for all my sins
[19:21] in my sickness
[19:24] in my face
[19:31] [Music]
[19:33] I disclaim those friends
[19:40] foreign
[19:46] says that
[19:48] he bled and he died
[19:51] to give you this message
[19:55] so in Act 2 000 years ago
[19:58] we can still claim that blood
[20:01] because he bled and died so that me and
[20:03] you could know the truth and that we
[20:06] didn't have to stumble in darkness
[20:08] that's the blood that I claim I claim
[20:10] the blood the physical literal blood
[20:12] 2000 years ago I claimed that that paid
[20:15] the penalty for my sin
[20:17] but I claimed the blood
[20:19] of what he bought to deliver to me
[20:23] let's just pray this evening
[20:25] precious Lord Jesus we're so grateful
[20:28] that we can come once again and gather
[20:30] ourselves together according to your
[20:32] word Lord
[20:34] that we can assemble ourselves as your
[20:36] word is instructed
[20:38] but Lord as we so often say we've come
[20:41] now to a great juncture of Time Lord
[20:43] that we've done all that a mortal being
[20:46] can do
[20:47] and Lord it's time now that the lamb
[20:49] must come and take the book and loose
[20:51] the seals for a man cannot do that Lord
[20:54] and these people certainly did not come
[20:57] here this evening to hear me or a man
[20:59] Lord and quite frankly I can find no
[21:03] fault in that because I didn't come to
[21:04] hear myself Lord
[21:06] but we're asking that you would come on
[21:09] the scene that you would come and that
[21:11] you would take this precious word that
[21:13] you bled and that you died for and that
[21:15] you would pick it up and that you would
[21:17] break it to us and feed us and reveal
[21:19] yourself to us
[21:21] Lord we're ever so grateful of what
[21:23] you've done for us Lord and we're ever
[21:25] so grateful of the truth that you have
[21:26] given us Lord that the billions of
[21:29] people that's walking around on the face
[21:31] of this Earth in darkness and gross
[21:33] Darkness we select small group of people
[21:37] have truth to walking may we never take
[21:40] that for granted Lord may we cherish it
[21:42] and may we give it the proper place that
[21:45] it deserves we ask now that you would
[21:47] just come and have your way we pray that
[21:50] you would just move me aside Lord Jesus
[21:52] father we just ask that you would come
[21:55] and be the speaker here this evening
[21:57] Lord and that you would come and be the
[21:59] hearer and that you would accomplish
[22:01] what you've set this service to
[22:03] accomplish we commit ourselves to you in
[22:06] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[22:10] God bless you if you'll take your Bibles
[22:12] we'll go to Hebrews chapter 12.
[22:19] I would like to
[22:22] just maybe put a little finishing
[22:25] touches on where I'd left off last time
[22:27] of being called to Mount Zion
[22:30] not a physical Mountain as Israel was
[22:33] called but a spiritual mountain and a
[22:35] spiritual habitation
[22:37] being that we are a gentile people
[22:41] so brother Frank if you wouldn't care
[22:43] just to do the lights like you did that
[22:45] time the last time that would be great
[22:48] you'll forgive me I've got sensitive
[22:50] eyes so these spotlights really do a
[22:53] number on me
[22:54] the uh
[22:55] I've always said that's why the Lord had
[22:57] to give me a beautiful wife is because
[22:59] I've got sensitive eyes I couldn't look
[23:01] at somebody that was hard on the ass so
[23:05] I should get some kind of points for
[23:06] that I think
[23:10] Hebrews chapter 12 before I get myself
[23:12] in trouble
[23:15] beginning at verse 1 wherefore seen we
[23:18] also are compassed about with so great a
[23:20] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[23:23] every weight in the Sin with thus so
[23:25] easily beset us
[23:26] let us run with patience the race that
[23:29] is set before us looking unto Jesus the
[23:32] author and finisher of our faith who for
[23:35] the joy that was set before him endured
[23:38] the cross despising the shame in a set
[23:41] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[23:43] God
[23:44] skipping down to 18 now
[23:48] for ye are not common to the mount that
[23:51] might be touched and that burned with
[23:53] fire nor unto Blackness and darkest and
[23:56] darkness and Tempest and the sound of a
[23:59] trumpet and the voice of Words which
[24:01] voice they that heard and treated that
[24:04] the word should not be spoken to them
[24:05] anymore
[24:06] for they could not endure that which was
[24:09] commanded and if so much as a beast
[24:11] touch the mountain it shall be stoned or
[24:13] thrust through with a dart
[24:16] and so terrible was the sight that Moses
[24:19] said I exceedingly fear and Quake but ye
[24:23] are come unto Mount Zion and unto the
[24:26] city of the Living God the heavenly
[24:28] Jerusalem and to an innumerable company
[24:31] of angels to the general assembly and
[24:33] the Church of the firstborn which are
[24:36] written in heaven unto God the judge of
[24:38] all and to the spirits of just men made
[24:41] perfect
[24:42] and to Jesus the mediator of the New
[24:44] Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[24:47] that speaketh better things than that of
[24:50] Abel God bless you as you would have
[24:52] your seats
[24:53] this evening so the scripture here Paul
[24:57] speaking is very clearly saying that we
[25:00] are a different type of people we are a
[25:03] gentile people Paul was sent as a light
[25:05] to the Gentiles and we are not a natural
[25:07] people called to Natural things as a
[25:10] natural mountain and uh things of that
[25:13] nature as the Jews were they were very
[25:16] much natural called to a natural
[25:17] Mountain they were numbered people of
[25:21] you know 12 tribes and so forth
[25:23] everything to the Jews was natural but
[25:25] Paul is obviously drawing a clear
[25:27] distinction here that we are not such a
[25:29] people that we are a spiritual people
[25:32] being Gentiles
[25:34] and the triggering point if you want to
[25:38] say the inspiration for this thought
[25:40] that I was putting together was when I
[25:43] was studying the message things that are
[25:44] to be I get a portion of that message
[25:47] read and It just strikes me that brother
[25:51] Branham is preaching a message things
[25:53] that are to be
[25:55] um but yet he's not speaking of anything
[25:57] natural or anything carnal that is to be
[26:01] everything in that message is spiritual
[26:04] everything
[26:05] and you know I guess maybe like I said
[26:09] sometimes I'm slow but it just really
[26:11] had impact on me and I went back to the
[26:14] beginning and started again to you know
[26:17] really grasp what he was pointing to and
[26:20] drawing to because here's a major
[26:22] prophet standing on the scene declaring
[26:26] a message things that are to be and he's
[26:28] not trying to tell us how to avoid a
[26:30] financial collapse he's not trying to
[26:32] tell us how to make sure we have perfect
[26:34] health or you know how to have the best
[26:37] car the best house or how to avoid
[26:39] pitfalls in the natural life but he is
[26:42] only and exclusively speaking of
[26:46] spiritual Heavenly things and directing
[26:48] our attention there
[26:49] so I think that's extremely important if
[26:52] and remember this was at the very tail
[26:54] end of his ministry and I was talking
[26:57] with a brother yesterday whether brother
[26:59] Branham knew it was at the telling of
[27:01] his ministry or not to me
[27:04] is not relevant I'm prone to believe
[27:06] that he did but God knew he was at the
[27:09] tail end of his ministry and God is the
[27:12] one orchestrating what he's going to be
[27:13] speaking and this is now at the tail end
[27:17] if you're standing in the position of
[27:19] God this is him looking to say I'm now
[27:21] at the tail end of my Ministry
[27:23] before I remove my voice
[27:27] and this is what I must say
[27:29] so to me it just carries a lot of weight
[27:32] and it's not that there's one portion
[27:35] more important than the other portion I
[27:37] would just say that it's a significant
[27:39] portion here it draws special attention
[27:41] to these closing moments of time
[27:45] and pick up your pen and write brother
[27:47] Branham speaks this in the church age
[27:49] book
[27:51] he says the second Forerunner of Christ
[27:54] will sow for the latter reign
[27:57] Jesus will be the showdown between the
[28:00] denominations and Creeds for he will
[28:03] come to back up his word and take his
[28:06] bride in the rapture
[28:08] the first Showdown was Mount Carmel
[28:11] the second was Mount Transfiguration but
[28:15] the third will be Mount Zion
[28:17] Mount Carmel was physical Mount
[28:20] Transfiguration was physical Mount Zion
[28:23] is spiritual
[28:25] and he says that Jesus Will Be The
[28:28] Showdown Jesus will be the one to come
[28:31] on the scene at that point in time and
[28:34] show who is who
[28:36] he says there's coming in Exodus this is
[28:38] in the Third Exodus he says there's
[28:40] coming in Exodus where God will show who
[28:43] is who
[28:47] so if God's going to show who is who why
[28:50] should we spend our time trying to
[28:51] figure out who is who why don't we just
[28:53] let God show who is who
[28:58] we want to make sure that we stay in our
[29:00] position
[29:02] if you want to figure out who is who at
[29:04] least start with yourself
[29:08] make sure that you are who you are
[29:11] supposed to be before we start figuring
[29:13] out who else somebody else is
[29:16] he says God will show who is who where
[29:19] the church itself the Bride of Jesus
[29:22] Christ will be Exodus out into the land
[29:25] that's promised in my father's house are
[29:28] many mansions in this place you don't
[29:32] have to go there and fight like they did
[29:34] speaking of Israel
[29:36] it's already prepared if this Earthly
[29:39] Tabernacle dwelling be dissolved we have
[29:43] one already waiting that where I am
[29:46] there ye may be also the great Exodus at
[29:50] hand
[29:51] so now the Mount Zion Showdown is also
[29:54] the final Exodus and God is going to
[29:57] determine who is who and he's going to
[29:59] show who and who is who
[30:02] but I want to emphasize this is a
[30:05] spiritual
[30:06] manifestation this is a spiritual battle
[30:08] does it have physical effects absolutely
[30:13] it will physically change your atoms
[30:17] but if you do not come to a spiritual
[30:20] Showdown first a spiritual Mount Zion it
[30:23] is not going to evolve into a physical
[30:25] manifestation
[30:27] so this scripture in my father's house
[30:30] are many mansions obviously is the one
[30:33] brother Branham is using as his keynote
[30:35] scripture for things that are to be and
[30:37] this is the scripture that he commonly
[30:39] references and what we're going to be
[30:40] referencing multiple times tonight and
[30:43] things that are to be brother random
[30:45] says and last night speaking over in
[30:46] Yuma for the Christian businessman I
[30:49] spoke on the subject of the rapture
[30:51] now that might be a strange subject to
[30:54] speak among at a banquet but most
[30:56] everyone there was Christians and so if
[30:59] we're Christians I think we ought to be
[31:02] kindly notified ahead we don't have to
[31:05] just guess at it we're notified what our
[31:09] destination will be how many are
[31:11] thankful that God kindly notified you
[31:13] ahead
[31:15] if you remember brother Branham
[31:18] um well I'm gonna get ahead of myself
[31:20] I'm not going to go there and I want to
[31:22] speak on that tonight and the subject is
[31:24] going to be things that are to be and
[31:27] now speaking last night on The Rapture
[31:30] so tonight I want to speak on this
[31:33] subject that I might tie it together
[31:35] with last night's message so he just
[31:38] preached on the Rapture he's coming to
[31:40] preach on things that are to be in the
[31:41] first right out of the gate he says I
[31:43] want to tie these two things together
[31:45] now there's going to be a rapture we
[31:48] know that that's in the future to be
[31:52] Revelation 4 verse 1 you don't have to
[31:55] turn there you know this by heart after
[31:57] this I looked and behold a door was open
[31:58] in heaven and the first voice which I
[32:01] heard was as it were of a trumpet
[32:04] talking with me which said come up
[32:06] hither
[32:08] and I will show thee things which much
[32:10] which must be Hereafter so brother
[32:14] Branham is doing exactly what the
[32:16] scripture did the scripture says come up
[32:18] higher and I'll show you things
[32:20] thereafter brother Branham comes and
[32:22] preaches the Rapture and then he goes
[32:23] immediately to things that are to be
[32:26] verse two and immediately I was in the
[32:28] spirit and behold a throne was set in
[32:31] heaven and one set on the throne
[32:34] John 16 verse 13 says how be it when he
[32:38] the spirit of Truth has come he will
[32:40] guide you into all Truth for he shall
[32:43] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[32:46] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[32:48] will show you things to come
[32:53] John 14 verse 1.
[32:56] this is the primary scripture that he
[32:58] was using
[32:59] let not your heart be troubled ye
[33:02] believe in God believe also in me in my
[33:06] father's house are many mansions if it
[33:08] were not so I would have told you I go
[33:11] to prepare a place for you and if I go
[33:14] and prepare a place for you I will come
[33:16] again and receive you unto myself that
[33:19] where I am there ye may be also and
[33:22] whether I go you know and the way you
[33:25] know Thomas saith unto him Lord we know
[33:28] not whether thou goest and how can we
[33:30] know the way look at what he's talking
[33:33] about here
[33:35] how you get there and the way you get
[33:37] there
[33:39] Jesus said unto him I am the way
[33:44] the truth the life
[33:47] and no man cometh unto the father but by
[33:50] me
[33:52] back to things that are to be brother
[33:53] random says now notice in my father's
[33:55] house there's many mansions we read this
[33:57] last time but I just want to refresh
[33:58] your memory and in case somebody wasn't
[34:00] here they'll have a clue what what
[34:01] direction we're going he says I don't
[34:04] mean to add to the word or take from it
[34:06] because we're not to do that but let me
[34:08] just make this as not an additive but
[34:11] just to bring out a point in my father's
[34:14] house is many kinds of mansions I don't
[34:17] believe that when we get to heaven that
[34:19] we will be just like just everybody look
[34:21] alike I don't believe that we will be
[34:23] blondes or brunettes or little or all
[34:26] big or all Giants I believe that God is
[34:29] a god of variety the world proves that
[34:32] he made you in a variety some men are
[34:35] real blusterous and some are real
[34:36] dogmatic and others are fine and others
[34:39] are kind and you just find all different
[34:41] kinds of people in his kingdom
[34:44] now notice many many mansions many kinds
[34:49] of mansions so brother Branham comes out
[34:51] with this opening scripture and he
[34:53] immediately brings clarification to it
[34:55] that we're not talking about sticks and
[34:57] stones and drywall he says that these
[35:00] houses these Mansions some of them have
[35:02] blonde hair some brunettes some are
[35:04] little some are big
[35:05] so I thank God for this Revelation I
[35:08] thank God that he would bring what does
[35:10] he say here not as an additive but just
[35:12] to bring out a point
[35:13] to bring Clarity to this he says when
[35:16] you see a man here struggling to live
[35:18] somebody in a hospital or a sick bed or
[35:20] in an accident struggling and the death
[35:22] rattle is in their throat and pulling
[35:24] and crying and screaming for Life what
[35:26] does that mean there's a place somewhere
[35:29] there's a body that doesn't struggle and
[35:32] scream for that now they are temporal
[35:35] gifts to us these things only expressing
[35:38] that there is one where it's the Eternal
[35:41] one that's what Jesus has gone away to
[35:45] prepare the Eternal one
[35:48] but remember when Thomas was talking to
[35:50] him he says I don't know where you're
[35:51] going I don't know the way and Jesus
[35:53] says I am the way I am the truth I am
[35:55] the life so we know these aren't houses
[35:58] that he has to go over there and put
[35:59] some two befores together and some
[36:01] drywall up these are bodies that we are
[36:03] going to move into and he says that I am
[36:06] I am going away to prepare those for you
[36:08] and oh by the way I am that way
[36:11] I am the way that you get to that body I
[36:14] am the truth I am the life
[36:17] so he doesn't need
[36:20] to go and build anything
[36:24] but he does need to provide a way for us
[36:27] because there's somebody that has to
[36:29] breach that Chasm there's somebody that
[36:33] has to remove my spiritual Amnesia in
[36:36] order for me to get to where we're going
[36:39] because remember we're not on a physical
[36:41] Journey although we are on a let me say
[36:43] it this way we're not on just a physical
[36:45] Journey
[36:46] we are on a physical Journey but we're
[36:48] not just on a physical Journey we're on
[36:51] a spiritual journey
[36:53] so if we're on a spiritual journey we
[36:56] need somebody to make a spiritual way
[36:59] and I'll remind you in the Book of
[37:00] Revelation when John was looking to see
[37:02] if he was qualified he was sorely
[37:04] disappointed
[37:05] and he also said that you were sorely
[37:07] disappointed and I was sorely
[37:08] disappointed because nobody
[37:11] nobody was worthy in heaven on Earth or
[37:14] under the Earth
[37:16] to cross this chasm to open this book to
[37:20] bring us back to where we needed to be
[37:23] Fellowship by Redemption 1955 brother
[37:27] Branham says this is astounding to me
[37:29] this is all the way back in 1955. I've
[37:32] never believed that heaven was a place
[37:34] where there was a bunch of buildings
[37:35] where there's a bunch of houses up there
[37:37] made with mortar dobbed up with paper
[37:39] and pain on the wall I've never believed
[37:41] that a supernatural being would have to
[37:44] live in a literal house
[37:48] I believe when Jesus spoke in John 14
[37:50] said in my father's house as many
[37:52] mansions he meant a body a Dwelling
[37:55] Place I can't tell you how desperately I
[37:57] would have loved to have found this
[37:59] quote years ago
[38:00] because I'm reading things that are to
[38:02] be and I'm wanting to put the pieces
[38:04] together and declare yes he's clearly
[38:06] talking about a body but I've just you
[38:08] know going back and forth until things
[38:10] click but here in 1955 he's openly
[38:12] declaring this mystery
[38:15] Jesus spoken John 14 in my father's
[38:18] house as many mansions he meant a body a
[38:21] dwelling place for the scriptures verify
[38:23] the same thing and say if this Earthly
[38:26] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[38:28] already waiting you see it more this is
[38:31] key listen to this Mortal beings is the
[38:35] only one who lives in mortal habitations
[38:40] Immortal beings live in immortal
[38:43] habitations
[38:48] you decide what you are you decide what
[38:50] you're living in
[38:51] if the Sticks and Stones house that
[38:53] you're living is is your only habitation
[38:57] there's not going to be much left of
[39:00] that pretty shortly I think I mean
[39:02] they're wanting to send nukes every day
[39:04] so we better be in we better be certain
[39:07] that we have an immortal habitation to
[39:11] move into
[39:12] he says then the place that we go into
[39:16] until we return back is not a place of
[39:20] brick and mortar and clay or precious
[39:22] stones or Jewels it's a place of
[39:25] condition
[39:29] it's a place of condition
[39:35] that we move out of this Dimension that
[39:38] we live into into another dimension
[39:42] and it's a house a tabernacle a Dwelling
[39:46] Place
[39:48] I'm just going to go ahead and let the
[39:49] cat out of the bag this is not something
[39:51] you have to wait on
[39:54] if you want to move move
[39:57] if you want to transcend Dimensions you
[39:59] as the Bride of Jesus Christ have the
[40:01] ability to transcend dimensions
[40:04] you might have to wait for your 16
[40:06] elements to catch up to you
[40:08] but if you want to move move
[40:10] if you want to come to Revelation
[40:12] chapter 4 and come up higher come up
[40:14] higher
[40:15] you have a house waiting for you to come
[40:17] into
[40:19] Jesus said destroy this Temple and I'll
[40:22] raise it up in three days
[40:24] and they thought he was speaking of of
[40:26] the Solomon's Temple but he was speaking
[40:29] of his own body
[40:30] and he has gone to prepare a place for
[40:34] every believer that the very moment we
[40:37] step out of these mortal regions don't
[40:40] Define that by death Saints it can be
[40:43] death but don't just limit it to that he
[40:46] says the very moment that we step out of
[40:48] these mortal Dimensions mortal regions
[40:52] how many want to step out of their
[40:53] mortal regions this evening I don't know
[40:56] about you but I do I desperately want to
[40:58] step out of this Mortal region that I am
[41:00] stuck in and get in into immortality to
[41:03] get into a different dimension an
[41:06] immortal dimension
[41:08] we don't go into a myth or some
[41:12] Supernatural Spirit but we go into a
[41:15] tabernacle a dwelling place oh praise
[41:18] the Lord I got ahead of myself and that
[41:21] might be right here in this building
[41:23] this morning
[41:27] well I don't think that was just back in
[41:29] 1955 that it was stuck in the Branham
[41:32] Tabernacle
[41:35] if you want to transcend regions
[41:38] Dimensions from mortality into
[41:40] immortality he says and that might be
[41:44] right here in this building this morning
[41:46] in a place that no other radio activity
[41:49] or nothing can touch it's there solely
[41:52] fixed by God Alone listen Moses had been
[41:54] dead for 800 years Elijah had been
[41:56] translated for around six or seven
[41:58] hundred years and there they stood on
[42:00] Mount Transfiguration both of them in
[42:03] their mortal looks talking to Jesus just
[42:06] before he went to Calvary see what I
[42:09] mean then what am I trying to say that
[42:11] we are looking at some mythical
[42:13] something a way off out yonder a hundred
[42:15] million years I got a revelation the
[42:18] other day standing up there on Mount
[42:21] polymor Palomar I'm probably saying that
[42:24] wrong at the observatory and seeing the
[42:27] time the space over to Mars and to the
[42:29] last continents and so forth and like
[42:31] traveling at so many thousands miles per
[42:33] second
[42:34] if an angel started from the farthest
[42:36] star and coming here it would take it
[42:38] billions times billion times billions of
[42:40] years to get here I cannot believe that
[42:43] there is a house way out yonder but I
[42:45] believe that that house that God was
[42:47] speaking of is Right present here now
[42:50] that's the place where they're mortal
[42:52] beings when we cease to be mortal here
[42:55] we step into Immortal immortality Yonder
[43:00] into a place and I believe that's where
[43:03] Jesus is today the resurrected Lord
[43:06] Jesus not out yonder somewhere a million
[43:08] miles away but right here present with
[43:11] us now
[43:14] the question is do we want to be stuck
[43:16] in this dimension
[43:19] that we're here as stuck in a mortal
[43:22] condition in a low to see and condition
[43:25] or do we want to transcend Dimensions to
[43:28] step in immortality
[43:31] because remember what Jesus's prayer was
[43:33] that where he is they may be also
[43:37] I don't think that he put a time limit
[43:40] on that to where where I am they may be
[43:43] also when they die
[43:46] I believe that's an open door as it says
[43:49] in Revelation chapter four that if we
[43:51] want to be where he's at we have that
[43:54] capability in that invitation
[43:56] brother random continuing says in the
[43:58] fourth dimension people can prove that
[44:00] right through this room now as coming
[44:01] radioactivity radio messages coming
[44:04] right through this building now is
[44:05] coming television pictures but it's too
[44:07] fast for our eyes now you go millions of
[44:10] miles beyond that Dimension and you'll
[44:12] get into a place that's just as real as
[44:14] television pictures is in this room this
[44:16] morning there is the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:18] the resurrected Son of God standing here
[44:21] and the reason I love how he says that
[44:24] if you go millions of miles beyond that
[44:26] you'll find him and then he says there
[44:28] he is the resurrected Son of God
[44:30] standing here
[44:37] and the reason that you can't see him is
[44:39] because our hearts hasn't become tuned
[44:43] down to it
[44:46] I say God tune my heart
[44:51] I say God get me out of the mortal
[44:54] laodicey and hybrid condition that I am
[44:56] stuck in in my mind and in my spirit
[44:58] realm and tune my heart into the
[45:02] frequency and the dimension that you're
[45:04] in
[45:08] I believe that we have had a message
[45:12] come to do that for us
[45:15] I believe that we have the capabilities
[45:18] in our grasp to do that if we will allow
[45:22] it to do that
[45:24] he says in the reason
[45:26] that we can't see the television
[45:28] pictures is because our bodies are not
[45:32] set as instruments to pick up
[45:34] mechanically sent things
[45:38] but when our body becomes in tune with
[45:42] God
[45:43] becoming a part of him then our soul can
[45:47] pick up the power of the Holy Spirit to
[45:50] vindicate the presence of the Lord Jesus
[45:52] Christ and all of his power and
[45:54] omnipotence he is risen from the dead he
[45:58] lives among us today he says I know
[46:00] that's a long ways around but I wanted
[46:02] to get this picture to you so that
[46:04] you'll never forget it
[46:07] I'm glad he took the long way around to
[46:10] make sure I understand the picture that
[46:12] he's seen and that I never forget it
[46:15] back to things that are to be brother
[46:16] Branham says that's where we are we have
[46:20] become from Mortal beings
[46:24] I'll remind you I'm not an English
[46:25] teacher but I'm pretty sure that's past
[46:27] tense
[46:29] we have become from Mortal beings from
[46:33] time beings to Eternal beings when the
[46:37] word of God lit in our souls and we
[46:40] became Sons and Daughters of God with
[46:42] the attributes the gene of God in us to
[46:44] be Sons and Daughters of the father God
[46:46] in heaven crying Abba Father my God my
[46:50] God In My Father's House
[46:54] so this house is a very special house
[46:56] because when you get into this house you
[46:59] no longer are limited by time you're no
[47:01] longer limited by Dimensions you're no
[47:03] longer limited to your mortal resources
[47:07] I would almost say it's a magic house
[47:12] it's a very special house
[47:14] and one that I long to be in and stay in
[47:18] and get tuned into
[47:21] so that it can have an effect on my
[47:23] mortal body
[47:24] 1964 the unveiling of God brother
[47:26] Branham says it was so great until even
[47:28] Moses feared the Quake then if that time
[47:31] he shook just the mountains this time
[47:33] he'll Shake heavens and earth what about
[47:36] this Glory if that was veiled by the
[47:39] natural Veil then this is veiled by a
[47:42] spiritual Veil
[47:43] he says so don't try to look at the
[47:47] natural
[47:48] break into the spirit and see where
[47:51] you're at see what hour we're living in
[47:55] so the prophet standing on the scene
[47:57] he's preaching the unveiling of God and
[48:00] the first thing he wants us to know is
[48:01] get out of the natural if you want to
[48:03] see God get out of the natural break
[48:06] into the spirit to see where you're at
[48:07] he comes in things that are to be and
[48:10] speaks of nothing natural nothing carnal
[48:13] nothing Earthly all spiritual
[48:18] I think I'll speak for myself but I
[48:21] think my Dao still needs tuned a little
[48:24] bit
[48:24] because I find myself caught up in too
[48:27] many natural things
[48:29] not sinful necessarily but Natural
[48:32] Things
[48:33] cares of the world
[48:36] I say Lord adjust my dial tune me in
[48:39] John 16 verse 7 nevertheless I tell you
[48:43] the truth it is expedient for you that I
[48:46] go away for if I go not away the
[48:48] comforter will not come unto you but if
[48:51] I depart I will send him unto you down
[48:54] to verse 13 how be it when he the spirit
[48:58] of Truth has come he will guide you unto
[49:01] all Truth for he shall not speak of
[49:04] himself but whatsoever he shall hear of
[49:06] that shall he speak and he will show you
[49:08] things to come
[49:11] First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 12 now
[49:15] we have received not the spirit of the
[49:17] world but the spirit which is is of God
[49:20] that we may know the things that are
[49:23] freely giving to us of God remember what
[49:25] brother Branham was exhorting us to do
[49:28] get out of the natural get out of the
[49:29] get into the spiritual and that's
[49:31] exactly what Paul is doing here we're
[49:34] not
[49:36] we're not
[49:39] receiving the spirit of the world but
[49:41] the spirit which is of god that we might
[49:44] know the things that are freely given to
[49:46] us of God which things also we speak not
[49:49] in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth
[49:52] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[49:54] comparing spiritual things with
[49:57] spiritual so Paul the first church age
[50:00] messenger was already exhorting the
[50:02] gentile people to do this
[50:05] get out of the natural get into the
[50:07] spiritual get out of the natural get
[50:08] into the spiritual obviously our
[50:10] messenger came on the scene and preached
[50:12] what Paul preached so it's no surprise
[50:14] that he would exhort us to do the same
[50:16] thing
[50:17] first Peter 2 1 wherefore laying aside
[50:20] all malice and all GAO and hypocrises
[50:23] and envies and all evil speakings as
[50:27] newborn babes desire the sincere milk of
[50:31] the word that ye may grow thereby
[50:34] remember these Mansions are not houses
[50:37] made of sticks and stones these Mansions
[50:39] are bodies
[50:42] they are people and in order to build
[50:45] these people as newborn babes desire the
[50:49] the sincere milk of the word that ye may
[50:52] grow thereby if so be
[50:57] if so big ye have tasted that the Lord
[50:59] is gracious to whom coming as unto a
[51:03] living Stone
[51:04] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[51:07] God and precious ye also as Lively
[51:10] stones are built up a spiritual house
[51:15] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[51:18] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[51:21] Christ
[51:22] wherefore also it is contained in the
[51:25] scriptures behold I lay in Zion a Chief
[51:28] Cornerstone elect precious and he that
[51:32] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[51:36] so remember our topic is to be called to
[51:39] Mount Zion wherefore to be called to
[51:41] Mount Zion we're obviously going to be
[51:43] built upon the Chief Cornerstone that
[51:45] lays in Zion
[51:47] and that Chief Cornerstone is built up
[51:50] of a living Stone
[51:53] and other living stones
[51:56] and Paul and Peter says that they are a
[52:00] spiritual house these are not the
[52:03] Natural Stone altars that Israel
[52:05] assembled
[52:07] that Joshua when he built after he
[52:10] crossed the Jordan this is not what we
[52:12] were called to but we are called to
[52:14] build up living stones and to be living
[52:18] spiritual habitations
[52:25] Jude 1 verse 20. but ye be loved
[52:30] building up yourselves
[52:34] on your Most Holy Faith
[52:36] praying in the Holy Ghost keep
[52:39] yourselves in the love of God looking
[52:42] for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
[52:44] unto eternal life
[52:48] so herein lies the scripture Jesus said
[52:50] that I'm going to go prepare a place
[52:54] but Paul says you're living stones and
[52:56] you need build up into a spiritual
[52:58] habitation or Peter says that Jude comes
[53:01] along and says build up yourself
[53:03] on your Most Holy Faith Brethren Branham
[53:06] would come and preach stature of a
[53:07] perfect man
[53:09] of adding virtues on top of Virtues on
[53:12] top of Virtues
[53:14] so if Jesus went and prepared all of
[53:15] this why do I have to build anything why
[53:18] do I have to do anything
[53:20] why does the scripture say in Revelation
[53:22] that the bride has made herself ready if
[53:24] Jesus went to prepare a place
[53:28] I'm not trying to confuse you I'm just
[53:30] trying to make you think for a second
[53:31] there might be more to this than what we
[53:33] realize there may be two forces at work
[53:36] in two different dimensions
[53:39] and he has prepared a way and made a way
[53:43] for those Dimensions to blend together
[53:46] for you to do what you need to do
[53:48] remember you are elected you are chosen
[53:51] and you are
[53:53] faithful by your own choosing
[53:55] the bride has prepared herself
[53:58] into a living habitation
[54:00] we'll get into that here in just a
[54:01] little bit but I want you to start
[54:03] thinking about it in Ephesians chapter 2
[54:06] verse 19 says now therefore ye are no
[54:10] more strangers and foreigners but fellow
[54:12] citizens with the Saints and of the
[54:14] household of God and are built upon the
[54:17] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[54:19] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[54:22] Cornerstone remember that Cornerstone
[54:25] was the stone that was land in Zion the
[54:28] spiritual habitation
[54:30] in whom all the building fitly framed
[54:33] together groweth into a holy Temple in
[54:36] the Lord in whom ye also are building
[54:38] together for a habitation of God through
[54:42] the spirit
[54:45] spiritual habitation
[54:47] spiritual Dwelling Places
[54:49] called to Mount Zion not as Israel
[54:53] called to a spiritual place
[54:55] and that spiritual place
[54:58] has been prepared by our Lord Jesus
[55:01] Christ
[55:03] faith is the substance 1947.
[55:07] I want to start maybe tying these two
[55:10] things together that you can understand
[55:11] what I was referring to
[55:14] Jesus did a work when he was here on
[55:17] Earth he paid the penalty
[55:19] and he went and he presented that
[55:21] sacrifice
[55:23] on the throne
[55:24] to make a way for us if it was not for
[55:27] that we would not stand a chance every
[55:28] one of us would we be rejected when we
[55:30] got there there was none of us capable
[55:33] to pay that penalty
[55:36] none of us to even attempt it
[55:38] but he says I will do that
[55:42] I will go and I will prepare a place for
[55:44] you I will go and I will prepare a way
[55:46] for you
[55:49] but there's multiple scriptures some of
[55:51] them that we just read some that we
[55:53] haven't read to where it clearly states
[55:56] that we have a part in this
[55:58] that the bride is to make herself ready
[56:01] that we are to take the sincere milk of
[56:04] the word and build ourselves up that we
[56:06] are to be written Epistles red of all
[56:08] men that we have something to do this
[56:11] that we are elected that we are called
[56:13] but we have to be faithful to that
[56:15] calling
[56:17] so it's not just him
[56:20] uh well it is him knowing everything but
[56:23] there is an effect that it has on us to
[56:27] make us then do something if you follow
[56:29] me
[56:30] and that's the portion that lays in our
[56:33] hands because remember brother Branham
[56:36] taught that God would never do away with
[56:37] free moral agency
[56:39] [Music]
[56:40] free moral agency is different than
[56:43] election
[56:45] you can be elected and make bad
[56:48] decisions by your free moral agency and
[56:50] hinder I'll say it as brother Raymond
[56:52] says paralyze the plan of God
[56:55] it will never change your election
[56:57] your election is your election it is
[57:00] what it is and you can't change it and
[57:02] you know what I'm happy about that
[57:05] I take great comfort in that I am not
[57:08] looking to argue about that I'm
[57:11] perfectly fine with the system he has in
[57:13] place
[57:14] but we can't disregard that he has
[57:17] obviously laid out portions of scripture
[57:20] that dictate to us I need a response
[57:23] from you remember brother Branham taught
[57:26] us that he created the angels to worship
[57:28] him they didn't have a choice but that's
[57:30] not what he was looking for he was
[57:31] looking for love he was looking to be
[57:34] worshiped out of love out of choice and
[57:37] that's why he had to give us a choice he
[57:39] had to make man different put them on
[57:41] free moral agency so that he's not a
[57:44] dictator to them but they can worship
[57:45] Him in love
[57:49] so there is a part that we play in that
[57:54] 1947 faith is the substance brother
[57:56] Branham says
[57:58] and I would love to be there tonight
[58:00] he's speaking of being back home with
[58:01] his wife and kids many of you know what
[58:04] it is to be away from home don't you say
[58:07] it's just a little old shack but it
[58:10] doesn't take a big whole a big house to
[58:12] make a home
[58:14] it's the character on the inside that
[58:18] makes a home
[58:22] it's the character
[58:25] on the inside
[58:27] that makes a home
[58:31] I can tell many of you have already got
[58:33] ahead of me
[58:37] what good does it do for Jesus to go and
[58:40] prepare you a place if you have no
[58:41] character to put into it
[58:50] because it's the character
[58:53] that's the beauty of the home
[58:55] it's the character that makes the home
[59:00] he can do everything that he has done
[59:07] and that home will set empty
[59:10] that home will set unoccupied
[59:14] because he can't force you
[59:18] to have the appropriate character to
[59:21] make that home
[59:22] that's your choice
[59:25] kind of
[59:27] because you will come to that point
[59:31] but it's your choice
[59:32] of how hard you want that to be and how
[59:35] many scars you want to carry from coming
[59:36] to that position
[59:39] so you will be tuned into that Dimension
[59:42] eventually
[59:44] it's just a matter of how hard you want
[59:46] to make that on yourself
[59:48] 1963 God hiding himself in Simplicity
[59:51] brother Branham says now I think that's
[59:53] our duty to make the inside right
[59:54] speaking of the Tabernacle by the grace
[59:57] of God to be so grateful to God that
[1:00:00] this will not only be a beautiful
[1:00:02] building that will come to but may
[1:00:04] everyone who comes in see the beautiful
[1:00:07] characteristics of Jesus Christ in every
[1:00:10] person that comes in may it be a
[1:00:13] consecrated place to our Lord a
[1:00:15] consecrated people for no matter how
[1:00:18] beautiful the structure is
[1:00:23] that we certainly do appreciate
[1:00:27] the beauty of the church is the
[1:00:30] character of the people
[1:00:34] so it works on the individual level or
[1:00:37] I'm sorry it works on the natural level
[1:00:39] of our natural houses brother Brown says
[1:00:42] whether it's just a shack it's the
[1:00:44] character of those people that's in
[1:00:46] there that make it a home it works in
[1:00:48] the religious Realms in a church it can
[1:00:50] be a beautiful Church
[1:00:52] or it can be a little mission on the
[1:00:55] corner Church it doesn't matter
[1:00:57] it can still be ugly or beautiful
[1:01:00] depending upon the character of the
[1:01:03] people within
[1:01:05] so if it works in the natural and it
[1:01:07] works then the religious World realm in
[1:01:10] the church
[1:01:11] what do you think about the individual
[1:01:14] pretty sure it will hold true
[1:01:17] Church age brother random says you had
[1:01:19] better come before it's too late saith
[1:01:21] the Lord and byeth me gold tried in the
[1:01:23] fire and then you will be truly Rich are
[1:01:26] we getting it listen to me
[1:01:29] naked physically we came into the world
[1:01:32] but naked spiritually
[1:01:36] we will not leave it
[1:01:41] oh no we are going to take something
[1:01:44] with us what that something is is all
[1:01:48] that we can take with us this is super
[1:01:51] important
[1:01:53] this is all
[1:01:56] so it's only the only thing you're going
[1:01:59] to take and it's all that you're going
[1:02:01] to take
[1:02:03] this is exclusively the only thing that
[1:02:06] you will take
[1:02:09] with us nothing less and nothing more so
[1:02:13] we had better be real careful now to see
[1:02:15] that we take something that will make us
[1:02:18] right before God
[1:02:20] so then what will we take with us we
[1:02:24] will take our
[1:02:26] character
[1:02:28] I thought that this quote was all
[1:02:30] through the message like he said it
[1:02:31] dozens and dozens of times dozens of
[1:02:33] times I was shocked that this is the
[1:02:36] only place that I can find this quote
[1:02:40] we we all know this quote we all have
[1:02:43] said this before this is nothing new but
[1:02:46] I was shocked this is the only place
[1:02:47] that he Nails this down and says this in
[1:02:49] the church age book The only thing that
[1:02:52] we will take is our character
[1:02:56] brother that is what we will take with
[1:02:58] us now what kind of character will you
[1:03:00] take with you will it be like his whose
[1:03:04] character was molded by suffering in the
[1:03:06] fiery furnace of Affliction or will it
[1:03:08] be with the softness of this
[1:03:09] characteristic laodicean people
[1:03:11] character
[1:03:13] character less laodicean people
[1:03:18] it is up to each one of us for in that
[1:03:22] day every man will bear his own burden
[1:03:27] remember we are called to Mount Zion a
[1:03:31] spiritual habitation
[1:03:35] but Mount Zion only consists of one
[1:03:39] thing
[1:03:40] and that is the character
[1:03:43] the character of Christ
[1:03:47] dwelling in each individual Stone
[1:03:52] you may be little in stature
[1:03:55] you may be big in stature you may have
[1:03:59] hundreds of gifts you may have no gifts
[1:04:01] you may be anything on either end of the
[1:04:05] spectrum natural and physically
[1:04:08] naturally
[1:04:10] but when it comes to spiritual
[1:04:13] qualifications for Mount Zion the Mount
[1:04:16] Zion Showdown
[1:04:18] there is only one thing that's going to
[1:04:20] make the cut
[1:04:21] and that is christ-like character
[1:04:26] 1965 choosing of a bride brother Brandon
[1:04:29] says that's exactly where the church
[1:04:30] stands today
[1:04:33] she sold her word given character
[1:04:39] so now he's just given us the answer of
[1:04:41] how we get that character
[1:04:44] she sold her word given character he's
[1:04:48] speaking of the worldly church that's
[1:04:50] what she's done to Satan for a
[1:04:52] scientific man-made religion when she
[1:04:56] had the right as a Church of God to stay
[1:04:59] with the word of God and have the Holy
[1:05:01] Spirit working among welding the body
[1:05:03] together with the word and love of God
[1:05:05] he says we choose by sight God chooses
[1:05:09] by character
[1:05:10] character there never was a character
[1:05:13] like Jesus Christ it lives in you and
[1:05:16] manifests him
[1:05:19] I say tune my dial to that
[1:05:23] that's an adjustment that I'm looking to
[1:05:25] make
[1:05:27] living in me manifesting him what
[1:05:31] station is that on
[1:05:34] that's what I'm looking for
[1:05:38] we'll see it's true it's not worldly
[1:05:41] beauty of him that attracts his bride
[1:05:44] it's not any worldly beauty of him that
[1:05:46] attracts his bride it is his character
[1:05:49] the character of the church that Jesus
[1:05:52] looks for
[1:05:54] perfect strength by Perfect weakness and
[1:05:57] that's the way God wants it realize that
[1:06:00] we are totally insufficient then God
[1:06:03] takes that person and begins to mold
[1:06:06] himself into that person are you
[1:06:09] adjusting your dial
[1:06:10] make his hands do what God would have
[1:06:13] his hands do
[1:06:15] I like the sound of that turn the volume
[1:06:17] up
[1:06:18] make his lips speak what God's lips
[1:06:21] would speak I like that
[1:06:23] say it louder
[1:06:25] because they're not his they're Gods
[1:06:28] he begins to build a character
[1:06:33] begins to take this weakness to make his
[1:06:36] own self
[1:06:40] so
[1:06:41] if God's going to build this character
[1:06:44] and make your hands be his hands and hit
[1:06:48] your lips be his lips
[1:06:51] and your weakness to make his own self
[1:06:55] remember where he started out at in his
[1:06:57] statement
[1:06:58] realize that we are totally insufficient
[1:07:03] then God takes that person
[1:07:09] so there is what's this big word I'm
[1:07:11] going to use there is a prerequisite
[1:07:16] for his lips to be our lip or our lips
[1:07:19] to be his lips
[1:07:20] for his hand for our hands to be his
[1:07:22] hands we first have to realize our
[1:07:25] insufficientness
[1:07:28] in identification brother Branham says
[1:07:30] we've got to take the entire Full Gospel
[1:07:33] we must and now being that we have
[1:07:37] identified ourselves as Full Gospel
[1:07:39] people let's mold our character
[1:07:43] so this is not a magic wand character
[1:07:46] this is a character that comes and it
[1:07:48] has to be built it has to be molded
[1:07:52] mode or character we're invited to be
[1:07:55] molded into his image that we might
[1:07:56] reflect his presence and the works that
[1:07:59] I do shall ye do also the life that I
[1:08:01] live so shall you we're invited by God
[1:08:04] to take him as an example and let our
[1:08:06] character be molded like his what a
[1:08:09] thing my then when we let his character
[1:08:12] be in us then we have become Sons by
[1:08:16] having the mind of Christ mind which is
[1:08:19] his character your mind makes your
[1:08:23] character this is another key
[1:08:28] you'll only get this character by the
[1:08:31] word
[1:08:32] and your mind molds your character
[1:08:36] this is why Satan
[1:08:39] is the
[1:08:41] is so polluting
[1:08:45] the entertainment dimension
[1:08:49] and
[1:08:51] he is so taken over
[1:08:55] and
[1:08:57] afflicting the people with screens
[1:09:00] everywhere
[1:09:03] I can't even pump gas without there
[1:09:06] being a screen there
[1:09:10] everywhere you go
[1:09:13] there is a screen
[1:09:15] why
[1:09:18] because Satan knows what God's tactics
[1:09:22] are he knows how God he knows the plan
[1:09:25] of God brother random said this he
[1:09:27] openly declares this not all of it he
[1:09:29] said there was one portion he didn't
[1:09:30] know and it's a good thing he didn't
[1:09:31] know that but he knows how God works
[1:09:35] and he knows that God is going to use
[1:09:38] the Mind remember the Battleground was
[1:09:40] the mind he knows God is going to come
[1:09:42] through the mind to mold the portion
[1:09:44] with his word to mold the character of
[1:09:47] the people so how is he going to mold
[1:09:49] the character of his people
[1:09:50] and how is he going to
[1:09:53] uh delay
[1:09:56] the people of God coming to their
[1:09:58] appropriate position he has got to get
[1:10:00] into a spiritual position
[1:10:03] an infiltrate and afflict them in their
[1:10:06] mind to bother their character coming to
[1:10:08] full fruition
[1:10:12] so how does he do that he enters that
[1:10:15] dimension
[1:10:16] whatever the dimension that is I don't
[1:10:17] know I always get them wrong so I'm not
[1:10:19] even going to say anything
[1:10:21] whatever Dimension that is to where
[1:10:23] there's screens everywhere
[1:10:25] and he has to constantly
[1:10:28] constantly have an image before the
[1:10:31] people to make them be thinking about
[1:10:33] something to be seeing something to be
[1:10:35] entertained by something
[1:10:37] and again I'm not even saying it's all
[1:10:39] bad or all what we would say sinful or
[1:10:41] dirty or smutty it's just I've got to
[1:10:44] tie up the cogs of their mind because
[1:10:46] what if by perchance they would start
[1:10:48] wondering about their Eternal
[1:10:49] destination and wondering where they
[1:10:52] come from and wondering about where they
[1:10:54] stand before their creator
[1:10:55] don't let them think those kind of
[1:10:57] thoughts let them think anything else
[1:10:59] don't let them think those kind of
[1:11:01] thoughts
[1:11:04] praise the Lord
[1:11:05] your mind makes your character this is
[1:11:07] why young people
[1:11:09] you have to guard against these things
[1:11:11] and we can sit here and I can go down
[1:11:13] the list if you want me to of what what
[1:11:15] they all are but it doesn't matter
[1:11:18] I'm not here to preach against social
[1:11:19] media and name them all if I don't even
[1:11:21] know half of them but it's out there
[1:11:23] it's there and if one's not going to
[1:11:25] catch your attention he'll get another
[1:11:26] one
[1:11:27] I mean I don't even know how many social
[1:11:29] media platforms there are right now why
[1:11:31] is it one good enough I mean how many
[1:11:33] social media lives do you have to have
[1:11:38] it's not about how many you have to have
[1:11:40] it's about keeping your mind tied up
[1:11:44] and it doesn't have to be just social
[1:11:46] media it can be anything it can be a
[1:11:48] nice hobby not a sinful hobby a nice
[1:11:50] hobby it can be anything to tie up your
[1:11:53] mind that is the Battleground that
[1:11:55] always has been it always will be
[1:11:59] I want to get off of that because I get
[1:12:01] carried away but we have to guard
[1:12:03] against that it is super important and
[1:12:07] we have to guard against it not in a
[1:12:08] legalistic way because a legalistic way
[1:12:11] will never work
[1:12:13] if I'm not saying don't be militant
[1:12:16] about it I would encourage you to be
[1:12:18] militant about it I'm just saying me
[1:12:20] standing here as a minister trying to be
[1:12:21] legalistic about it or militant about it
[1:12:23] it's not going to work it's got to be
[1:12:25] your decision it's got to be your
[1:12:27] guardian
[1:12:28] it's got to be you making the decision
[1:12:31] to guard your mind
[1:12:33] and it's not going to be easy because
[1:12:35] again
[1:12:37] you
[1:12:38] if you live in this world the screens
[1:12:41] are everywhere
[1:12:43] I mean you almost would have to put on
[1:12:45] blinders to
[1:12:47] to avoid it all so it's there we're not
[1:12:50] going to stick our head in the sand and
[1:12:51] it all go away and everything's
[1:12:52] hunky-dory it's there it's something we
[1:12:54] have to deal with
[1:12:56] but we have a word to overcome that
[1:12:59] we have a word
[1:13:01] to stay on the Forefront of our minds we
[1:13:03] have a word to guard our eyes
[1:13:07] your mind makes your character let the
[1:13:09] Mind Paul said of Christ this mind that
[1:13:11] was in Christ be in you let that mind of
[1:13:13] Christ be in you it molds the character
[1:13:15] of a son of God
[1:13:19] oh mercy
[1:13:24] things that are to be brother Brandon
[1:13:26] says now remember the Bible says if this
[1:13:28] Earthly Tabernacle of our dwelling if it
[1:13:30] perish if it be dissolved we have one
[1:13:32] already waiting just as the little baby
[1:13:35] it's little muscles in the mother are
[1:13:37] twisting internal he's talking about a
[1:13:39] natural birth now natural childbirth
[1:13:41] and you notice you can take a woman if
[1:13:43] she is ever so foul but when she's to
[1:13:46] become a mother a little before that
[1:13:47] baby is born there's a kindness about
[1:13:49] the woman get around her there's always
[1:13:51] something she's more tender why there's
[1:13:53] a little angel Spirit waiting to receive
[1:13:55] that natural body just as soon as it's
[1:13:58] born the Breath of Life comes into it
[1:13:59] and God breathes it in there and it
[1:14:01] becomes a living Soul now just as this
[1:14:04] baby is being born speaking of the
[1:14:06] natural one
[1:14:07] then the spiritual body is here to
[1:14:09] receive it and now when this body is
[1:14:12] dropped here speaking of the natural
[1:14:14] body when this natural body is dropped
[1:14:16] in this earth like the baby is dropped
[1:14:17] also there is an immortal body waiting
[1:14:20] to receive the spirit back into itself
[1:14:25] I want to lay emphasis on back into
[1:14:29] itself
[1:14:31] because if you go back into something
[1:14:34] that means you were already there at
[1:14:37] some point
[1:14:40] I better keep going because I'm fixing
[1:14:42] to get really excited
[1:14:44] it will go receive it don't ask me to to
[1:14:48] answer how that works Saints I don't
[1:14:49] have a clue I just know it will work and
[1:14:52] I know it's true
[1:14:53] but it will re it will receive its back
[1:14:56] into itself
[1:14:58] oh what a great thing I agree what a
[1:15:00] great thing we are now in Christ Jesus
[1:15:03] babies babes in Christ children of God
[1:15:05] waiting for the full Deliverance at the
[1:15:08] coming of our Lord Jesus to receive us
[1:15:10] up into himself
[1:15:13] when their body this Mortal will take on
[1:15:17] immortality
[1:15:18] notice how the expecting mother craves
[1:15:21] for certain things the mother in the
[1:15:24] birth of the baby if there's something
[1:15:26] lacking in her body she begins to Crave
[1:15:28] certain things look how dad would just
[1:15:30] pinch Corners everything to get it for
[1:15:32] her remember we're talking about
[1:15:33] character
[1:15:34] see it's her the body her body the
[1:15:37] calcium and so forth of her body and the
[1:15:39] vitamins that she needs Juni is being
[1:15:42] made up and he craves for things foods
[1:15:44] for the coming child when there's
[1:15:46] something needed the mother gives
[1:15:47] witness of it see her system is made up
[1:15:50] that's how that when there's something
[1:15:52] needed here to the oncoming child the
[1:15:55] mother begins to Crave for that speaking
[1:15:57] naturally
[1:15:59] changes a gear now stop a minute why do
[1:16:03] we have revivals why do we assemble
[1:16:06] ourselves together why am I always
[1:16:09] rebuking the people why does the Holy
[1:16:12] Spirit keep crying out I it knows that
[1:16:16] there's something lacking there
[1:16:20] we must be in the full stature of Jesus
[1:16:23] Christ we must be Sons and Daughters of
[1:16:25] God we must act like God's children he's
[1:16:29] saying saying why do we do all of this
[1:16:31] religious stuff that we do
[1:16:34] why does the Holy Spirit keep coming on
[1:16:37] the scene why do we have meetings why do
[1:16:38] we assemble ourselves because that body
[1:16:42] knows there's something lacking
[1:16:47] well remember there's only one thing you
[1:16:49] can take to that body
[1:16:51] character
[1:16:53] so your character my my character your
[1:16:56] character there is something lacking and
[1:16:59] the Holy Spirit will come on the scene
[1:17:03] for that lack
[1:17:04] he says now think if God in his Mercy
[1:17:07] has the mother before the little baby is
[1:17:10] born it's craving for some vitamin and
[1:17:12] the mother's word speak forth dad I want
[1:17:14] cantaloupe or watermelon I want
[1:17:16] something another why he'll do
[1:17:18] everything he can to get that because he
[1:17:21] knows that he wants his child to be born
[1:17:23] as perfect as it can be see how much
[1:17:26] more abler
[1:17:27] is he to get it
[1:17:30] he's a Creator now think how able he is
[1:17:33] to prepare us a body
[1:17:40] to live like his own glorious body
[1:17:44] he is so able to prepare us a body
[1:17:50] that he bled and died for this message
[1:17:54] that's how he prepared you a body
[1:17:55] because your body is a word body your
[1:17:58] body is a christ-like character body and
[1:18:01] there's only one way that you can get
[1:18:02] that and that's through the message of
[1:18:03] this album
[1:18:05] the words that I speak to you they are
[1:18:08] spirit and they are life there is no
[1:18:10] other word out there there is no other
[1:18:13] man's idea out there that can give you
[1:18:16] the christ-like character that you need
[1:18:18] to go to the house he's prepared for you
[1:18:21] why did he have to send Malachi for
[1:18:23] because my body was crying for it
[1:18:29] why did he have to loose the seals
[1:18:32] himself because my body was crying for
[1:18:36] it
[1:18:37] I needed spiritual vitamins to go to my
[1:18:41] spiritual habitation and there was only
[1:18:43] one channel for it to get there
[1:18:46] spiritual food in due season
[1:18:49] to build up a body
[1:18:53] there is something in us to call that
[1:18:55] calls to live and there is something in
[1:18:58] us that calls to do right then God will
[1:19:02] call somebody on the platformer to the
[1:19:04] pulpit that will preach the absolute
[1:19:06] truth why it shows you then if you're a
[1:19:09] real child of God you begin to cry out
[1:19:11] God take it away from me circumcise me
[1:19:15] from this take these things away from me
[1:19:17] why it's needed for your heavenly home
[1:19:20] that you're going to where he's going to
[1:19:23] prepare
[1:19:27] it goes to show you that he has gone to
[1:19:29] prepare it but there is something else
[1:19:31] needed
[1:19:32] what is needed
[1:19:34] a christ-like character
[1:19:40] I've got to skip some of this
[1:19:43] but I believe you've got the point
[1:19:46] There Are Spiritual vitamins needed for
[1:19:49] that body
[1:19:50] that body is made up of christ-like
[1:19:52] character
[1:19:54] and the only way to get that christ-like
[1:19:57] character
[1:19:58] is through the message of this album
[1:20:01] as delivered by Malachi 4 as delivered
[1:20:04] by Revelation 10 7.
[1:20:06] I believe you've got that I can skip a
[1:20:08] lot of this
[1:20:10] he says we live in the day
[1:20:15] the spiritual union of Christ and his
[1:20:18] church now when the flesh is becoming
[1:20:20] word and the word is becoming flesh
[1:20:23] manifested Vindicated just what the
[1:20:25] Bible said would happen in this day it's
[1:20:28] happening
[1:20:31] it's happening day by day
[1:20:35] remember what we said earlier don't put
[1:20:37] this somewhere far off Yonder a billion
[1:20:39] light years away he says it could be
[1:20:41] right here in this building right now
[1:20:43] and it's happening day by day
[1:20:50] why it's it's accumulating so fast out
[1:20:54] there in those deserts and things taking
[1:20:55] place that I couldn't even keep up with
[1:20:57] it we're near the coming of Jesus to be
[1:20:59] United with his church where the word
[1:21:02] becomes the word
[1:21:04] you wrap your mind around that praise
[1:21:06] the Lord
[1:21:08] we're closing
[1:21:11] Satan takes the poison darts of hell and
[1:21:13] tries to bruise the church that's in
[1:21:15] travail with the baby and before it's
[1:21:18] ever born they kill it
[1:21:20] why do you think abortion is on a
[1:21:22] rampage
[1:21:23] because it's Satan tactics remember
[1:21:25] brother Brandon says whatever happens
[1:21:26] natural is happening spiritual
[1:21:29] Satan is that cruel Satan is not a
[1:21:33] courageous Warrior Saints
[1:21:38] he will kill you at your weakest point
[1:21:40] he is not going to wait for a fair
[1:21:42] battle
[1:21:44] you think that little baby in the womb
[1:21:46] has a chance from the doctor going in
[1:21:48] there with his scalpel and satanic
[1:21:51] Inspire inspired instruments and sucking
[1:21:53] it out of the womb of a of a mother I
[1:21:56] mean the I don't even want to go into
[1:21:57] it's because it's so hideous
[1:22:00] that's Satan for you
[1:22:03] kill it before it even has a chance
[1:22:06] brother Branham says that's what he does
[1:22:07] to us spiritually
[1:22:09] kill it before it even has a chance
[1:22:11] that's why you take the name of the Lord
[1:22:13] Jesus Christ in baptism you better watch
[1:22:15] out
[1:22:18] because he's coming for you you're a
[1:22:19] newborn babe and he's going to kill you
[1:22:21] in the womb before it tries to give
[1:22:22] birth before you get to the Holy Ghost
[1:22:25] he's going to try to kill you he is
[1:22:27] going
[1:22:28] I don't know why I'm going down this
[1:22:29] route but praise the Lord he is not
[1:22:31] going to wait until you come to the
[1:22:33] stature of a perfect man before he says
[1:22:34] okay there's a worthy adversary let's go
[1:22:37] no Saints
[1:22:40] he's going to get you as soon as he
[1:22:42] thinks that you are a threat to him or
[1:22:45] maybe even possibly a threat to him
[1:22:49] I encourage you
[1:22:53] let yourself be born
[1:22:55] let yourself be
[1:22:58] a babe and feed on the sincere milk of
[1:23:01] the word don't let him kill you as a
[1:23:03] baby
[1:23:05] make him kill you as a man if he's going
[1:23:07] to kill you as a full adult
[1:23:09] make him earn it
[1:23:12] he's not a fair fighter
[1:23:14] he says You must take spiritual vitamins
[1:23:18] learning and that brings forth the baby
[1:23:22] to a birth
[1:23:24] so if you're wanting to be born again
[1:23:27] take the word
[1:23:28] eat the word
[1:23:30] be born
[1:23:32] here in a couple weeks little for sale
[1:23:34] is not going to have an option of
[1:23:35] whether she's been born
[1:23:36] she's going to be born
[1:23:41] I challenge you to eat the word of
[1:23:44] Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 7 and not be
[1:23:47] born
[1:23:49] I challenge you to do that
[1:23:51] it's impossible
[1:23:53] his word will not fail
[1:23:56] you will be born again with the
[1:23:58] character of Christ
[1:24:00] he says 1963 accepting God's provided
[1:24:03] way at the end time but all when you're
[1:24:05] in Flight amen when you're in Flight you
[1:24:07] pick up more than your denominational
[1:24:08] Creed you pick up the vitamins the
[1:24:11] spiritual vitamins that builds a body
[1:24:13] that's solid full of muscles with wing
[1:24:16] feathers that can lift you up off your
[1:24:17] feet and show you things
[1:24:20] that is to come
[1:24:21] or may I say
[1:24:23] things that are to be
[1:24:25] the Holy Spirit when he the Holy Spirit
[1:24:28] has come he will show you these things
[1:24:30] to you he will reveal these things to
[1:24:32] you that I've told you and he will show
[1:24:34] you things that is to come
[1:24:41] brother Branham in 1958 he says
[1:24:44] and we've been taught not only through
[1:24:46] Pentecostal Realms but through the
[1:24:49] Holiness group and the Baptist and what
[1:24:51] more that when you're born again were
[1:24:53] sons of God
[1:24:55] that's true
[1:24:57] but that's just the beginning
[1:25:01] it's your character from then on is what
[1:25:06] makes the difference
[1:25:10] you got it I don't need to say it again
[1:25:16] in the thought iron Church age brother
[1:25:18] Branham says
[1:25:19] scripture speaking I know your faith now
[1:25:22] he does not stay stay here as he did to
[1:25:25] the church in pergamus you hold my faith
[1:25:28] he is not talking about his faith now
[1:25:31] but he is commending them for their
[1:25:34] faithfulness and as he does he also
[1:25:37] mentions their patience
[1:25:39] and this is what I want to end on
[1:25:41] tonight
[1:25:43] and as he does he also mentions their
[1:25:47] patience
[1:25:50] now faithfulness and patience go
[1:25:54] together
[1:25:55] in fact patience is the outcome of
[1:26:00] faithfulness for it says in James 1 3
[1:26:03] The Train of your faith workers worketh
[1:26:05] patience
[1:26:07] there is absolutely no other way in
[1:26:10] which to gain patience
[1:26:14] how highly God regards this outworking
[1:26:17] of our patients is seen in James 4 but
[1:26:21] let patience have her perfect work that
[1:26:24] ye may be perfect an entire lacking
[1:26:28] nothing
[1:26:30] God's will for us is perfection
[1:26:35] do we all agree with that
[1:26:37] do we all want perfection
[1:26:42] and that Perfection is patience
[1:26:46] waiting on God and waiting for God
[1:26:52] this is the process of character
[1:26:57] development
[1:27:02] how many wants a christ-like character
[1:27:06] this is the process
[1:27:09] of character development
[1:27:12] waiting on God
[1:27:16] and waiting for God
[1:27:19] in the church age book on is italicized
[1:27:24] 4 is italicized so he's drawing specific
[1:27:28] attention to waiting on God
[1:27:31] and waiting for God
[1:27:34] I don't know that I have a complete
[1:27:37] understanding of why yet this is the way
[1:27:40] that I take it though
[1:27:43] is we can wait on God
[1:27:46] for an answer
[1:27:48] let's just take something simple healing
[1:27:51] we need healing in our body
[1:27:53] we can wait on God with patience
[1:27:58] on how
[1:28:00] he wants to heal us because we know God
[1:28:03] has many manifestations of healing
[1:28:07] so we can seek God for healing and we
[1:28:09] can seek God for how he wants to heal us
[1:28:12] and we can wait on him for that answer
[1:28:15] but he may give you the answer of how
[1:28:18] he's going to heal you and you still
[1:28:20] have to wait for him to manifest it does
[1:28:23] that make sense
[1:28:25] so it's not just enough in my opinion
[1:28:28] this is a scriptural teaching because I
[1:28:30] believe this is what Abel did Abel in my
[1:28:32] opinion did not just have a revelation
[1:28:34] on what the sacrifice was to be but he
[1:28:37] had a revelation on when to give the
[1:28:39] sacrifice
[1:28:40] the same as we can have a revelation of
[1:28:43] how God wants to heal us but we have to
[1:28:45] wait on God to do it
[1:28:49] that's why brother Brandon says when you
[1:28:50] come through the prayer line and I pray
[1:28:52] for you you're healed
[1:28:54] but it may be three months before it
[1:28:55] manifests
[1:28:57] this is a simple principle but brother
[1:28:59] Branham says this is the process of
[1:29:02] character development patience waiting
[1:29:06] on God and waiting for God now you can
[1:29:09] take it as simple as you want or as deep
[1:29:11] as you want
[1:29:13] but patience waiting on God for the
[1:29:17] answer and waiting for God to manifest
[1:29:20] that is the only way you will ever
[1:29:22] demonstrate christ-like character
[1:29:24] because that is exactly what Jesus did
[1:29:28] he says I do nothing but first the
[1:29:30] father show me
[1:29:38] I'm going to give you a little secret
[1:29:40] here
[1:29:43] you are not going to have to fight this
[1:29:46] battle over something you don't care
[1:29:49] about how long it takes
[1:29:52] or something you're not interested in
[1:29:56] let me make it really simple or really
[1:29:58] silly
[1:29:59] I'm not going to fight the Battle of
[1:30:02] when God is going to give me a
[1:30:04] Lamborghini
[1:30:07] I am not going to have to endure with
[1:30:10] patience
[1:30:11] and develop a christ-like character and
[1:30:13] suffer the fiery Trials of affliction
[1:30:16] over a Lamborghini
[1:30:19] because I don't need a Lamborghini
[1:30:21] and I don't care about a Lamborghini
[1:30:27] you understand the principle
[1:30:30] there's too many people in here and I
[1:30:32] don't have the gift of discernment to go
[1:30:34] through them and give you the list
[1:30:36] but the trial that you're facing and the
[1:30:39] battle that you're fighting that you're
[1:30:40] waiting on God for and waiting for God
[1:30:43] for
[1:30:46] is the very situation that God himself
[1:30:48] has laid before you to give you an
[1:30:50] opportunity
[1:30:52] to show christ-like character
[1:30:55] without the thing that you are suffering
[1:30:59] with right now
[1:31:01] you cannot prove to Satan that you're
[1:31:03] not like the first Thief
[1:31:06] this is your and mine only opportunity
[1:31:09] to prove to the devil that we're not
[1:31:11] like her
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:14] and I don't say that to belittle what
[1:31:16] you're going through right now because I
[1:31:17] guarantee you it's real and I guarantee
[1:31:19] you you're really suffering
[1:31:22] I'm not belittle that I'm not telling
[1:31:24] you to get over it I'm not telling you
[1:31:26] that you know
[1:31:28] uh
[1:31:31] to man up and you know
[1:31:34] move on with life
[1:31:36] I know it's real
[1:31:39] and I know it's a fiery trial of
[1:31:41] Affliction because I've been there and
[1:31:44] I've done that and I would say that I'm
[1:31:46] currently there and doing that
[1:31:50] but why don't we
[1:31:52] be called to Mount Zion for a second as
[1:31:55] the musicians would come
[1:31:57] why don't we stop being a carnal natural
[1:32:01] people for just a second
[1:32:04] and allow the spirit of Christ to move
[1:32:08] into our mind
[1:32:10] and to change our mind for a second
[1:32:14] to where we don't have an Earthly view
[1:32:16] of this situation that we're in right
[1:32:18] now
[1:32:20] and again I want to stress I'm not
[1:32:22] saying it's not real saints because if
[1:32:23] it wasn't real it wouldn't affect you
[1:32:25] and if it wouldn't affect you there
[1:32:26] would be no Victory and there would be
[1:32:28] no character
[1:32:30] because character is we know this
[1:32:32] character is not a gift it's not given
[1:32:34] it has to be earned
[1:32:36] you CA you can't develop character by
[1:32:39] something that's not real and that you
[1:32:41] don't care about that don't have an
[1:32:42] effect on you
[1:32:44] it's not possible if you don't care
[1:32:45] about something you don't care about
[1:32:47] something if you don't overcome
[1:32:48] something there's no there's no victory
[1:32:52] and you're not going to fight a battle
[1:32:53] that you don't care about and you're not
[1:32:55] going to overcome something you don't
[1:32:56] care about
[1:32:57] I trust that makes sense to you
[1:33:01] but why don't we allow ourselves to be
[1:33:04] called as Paul said as a spiritual
[1:33:07] people and be called to Mount Zion and
[1:33:10] to look at things from Mount Zion for a
[1:33:12] second
[1:33:14] and look into the back part of God's
[1:33:18] mind
[1:33:19] that we have so graciously been given
[1:33:21] the opportunity to do through a prophet
[1:33:23] that God sent to us
[1:33:26] and to realize the thing that I'm going
[1:33:28] through right now it is real
[1:33:31] and I am suffering and it is a fiery
[1:33:34] furnace of affliction
[1:33:36] but this is my one and only opportunity
[1:33:39] as a mortal
[1:33:43] to make my stand
[1:33:45] and to prove to Satan that I'm not like
[1:33:48] the first Thief
[1:33:49] remember we're only fighting the battle
[1:33:51] that was fought in the garden and the
[1:33:53] battle that was fought in the garden was
[1:33:56] patience
[1:34:00] that's what brother Branham said he says
[1:34:01] Eve couldn't wait
[1:34:03] I'll refresh your memory Eve wasn't
[1:34:06] waiting on a Lamborghini
[1:34:07] Eve didn't care about a Lamborghini Eve
[1:34:10] cared about reproducing because that was
[1:34:12] the promise of God but she didn't know
[1:34:15] how and she couldn't wait brother
[1:34:16] Brandon says and she messed everything
[1:34:18] up
[1:34:19] Eve wanted to be a mother not sinful and
[1:34:22] completely in the word of God
[1:34:25] Saints I believe there is a people in
[1:34:27] the face of the Earth that have come
[1:34:29] back to that position as Eve did we are
[1:34:31] not here designing sinful worldly things
[1:34:33] we are here exclusively Desiring the
[1:34:37] perfect will of God in our life but let
[1:34:39] me tell you it's not going to be easy
[1:34:41] it's going to come through a fiery trial
[1:34:43] of Affliction because in order to truly
[1:34:46] prove that we're not like that first Eve
[1:34:48] Satan has got to lay before the people
[1:34:51] of God every opportunity
[1:34:54] every opportunity and every situation to
[1:34:57] take your own idea
[1:35:04] and until we as a body
[1:35:09] overcome each one of those situations
[1:35:12] and rely on God and for God we're not
[1:35:17] going anywhere
[1:35:20] but thanks be to God
[1:35:23] he has sent us spiritual food and due
[1:35:24] season
[1:35:26] and
[1:35:27] he has placed something within to cry
[1:35:30] for that food
[1:35:33] and that is an invincible Army
[1:35:36] that is not something that Satan can
[1:35:39] overcome
[1:35:40] the only thing he can do is afflict our
[1:35:43] spirit realm and our mind to try to get
[1:35:46] us unfocused
[1:35:48] and to think that we can do something
[1:35:49] about it ourselves
[1:35:52] and not rely on God and for God and defy
[1:35:58] the principle of patience and take our
[1:36:00] own way
[1:36:01] and when he does that
[1:36:04] he's paralyzed the program of God he's
[1:36:06] not beaten it
[1:36:07] because that'll Circle right back around
[1:36:09] and you'll get another chance at it
[1:36:11] or maybe it'll go to the next member of
[1:36:13] the bride and they'll get a chance at it
[1:36:15] I don't know how all that works I don't
[1:36:16] know who keeps track of all of that but
[1:36:18] one way or the other brother brainer
[1:36:20] says this bride of Jesus Christ will be
[1:36:23] tested in every facet mentally
[1:36:25] emotionally physically I would say
[1:36:28] financially I would say psychologically
[1:36:30] I would say whatever a situation you can
[1:36:32] put in there she will be tested
[1:36:36] in every aspect
[1:36:38] I thank God I don't think one individual
[1:36:42] has to Bear all of that
[1:36:44] because I don't think we could
[1:36:46] but collectively we will
[1:36:48] and praise be to God he has given us the
[1:36:51] message of the hour
[1:36:53] to form the character that we need
[1:36:56] to fit in
[1:36:58] to that place that has been prepared
[1:37:03] Christ as we would stand Christ has went
[1:37:07] and prepared that place for us
[1:37:10] but remember Christ does not come all
[1:37:14] the way to the Earth
[1:37:16] when he gets his bride
[1:37:18] we meet him in the air
[1:37:21] which means we take something there
[1:37:28] I may be wrong
[1:37:29] but I don't think I am
[1:37:32] I believe what we take with us into the
[1:37:35] air
[1:37:36] is our character
[1:37:40] and I believe
[1:37:43] that we have been graciously given us
[1:37:45] the word given a word
[1:37:48] that we don't have to wonder if it's
[1:37:50] going to work
[1:37:51] we don't have to be despondent and in
[1:37:54] despair
[1:37:56] but we can have the mind of Christ
[1:38:01] to have a proper understanding this will
[1:38:03] work
[1:38:05] if I wait on him and I wait for him in
[1:38:10] every situation of my life
[1:38:13] and that's not going to be easy I cannot
[1:38:15] stress that enough here this evening
[1:38:17] since it is not going to be easy
[1:38:19] it is not going to be easy if it was
[1:38:22] easy it wouldn't be a battle if it was
[1:38:24] easy it wouldn't be written in the
[1:38:26] scriptures of fiery Trials of affliction
[1:38:30] it's not going to be easy it's going to
[1:38:32] be real and it's going to be something
[1:38:35] you care about and it's going to be
[1:38:37] something that you're wanting an answer
[1:38:38] to pretty quickly
[1:38:44] those are the situations
[1:38:48] that I pray God will give me and you the
[1:38:50] grace
[1:38:52] somehow
[1:38:54] as the prophet said something come
[1:38:56] tumbling down through a mystical Channel
[1:38:58] and strike me in the heart and make me
[1:39:01] change my dimensions for a second and
[1:39:04] recognize
[1:39:07] I am not just a mortal being limited to
[1:39:11] a mortal habitation
[1:39:13] but I have access to a different
[1:39:15] dimension
[1:39:17] and I'm going to tap into that
[1:39:19] is this that I'm dealing with real does
[1:39:22] it look like I need to hurry up and make
[1:39:23] a decision yes
[1:39:25] does this hurt yes is this uncomfortable
[1:39:28] yes
[1:39:29] but I know one thing for certain I don't
[1:39:31] have the answer to this problem but I
[1:39:34] know one thing for certain
[1:39:36] I can't take my own reasoning in my own
[1:39:38] way
[1:39:39] if it means just standing here and
[1:39:43] standing here and not doing anything I
[1:39:46] think I've got a scripture for that
[1:39:48] when you've done all that you can do
[1:39:50] just stand
[1:39:52] and stand and do what
[1:39:54] nothing
[1:39:56] wait for it wait on him
[1:39:58] and wait for him as our pastor would
[1:40:01] come let's pray together
[1:40:03] precious Lord Jesus we thank you for
[1:40:05] this time that you've given us this
[1:40:07] evening Lord
[1:40:10] father there are not words
[1:40:13] to express our gratitude to you
[1:40:19] that is Darkness
[1:40:22] and gross Darkness
[1:40:24] has overtaken this entire Earth
[1:40:30] you in your grace in your mercy
[1:40:34] sent us the gift of a prophet
[1:40:39] that you could come and step into that
[1:40:42] gift yourself
[1:40:45] and reveal your character and live your
[1:40:49] character before us
[1:40:51] so that we would not stumble around in
[1:40:54] our own ideas in our own decisions and
[1:40:57] our own reasonings
[1:40:59] but if we would yield ourselves and be
[1:41:03] faithful to the word that you have given
[1:41:04] us
[1:41:06] and be patient
[1:41:09] and wait on you and for you
[1:41:11] you will provide us the answer for every
[1:41:14] situation
[1:41:16] Lord it may not come when we want it to
[1:41:19] and it may not come how we want it to
[1:41:21] but one thing is for certain you are a
[1:41:24] not like a man and you will not lie and
[1:41:27] you have promised us that if we would
[1:41:29] wait
[1:41:30] we would raise rise up
[1:41:32] like eagle with wings like an eagle
[1:41:35] God please come and help us Lord the
[1:41:39] world is spinning so fast and we are
[1:41:42] such a busy people and multiple
[1:41:45] situations will come at us on a daily
[1:41:47] basis Lord and if you don't come and if
[1:41:50] you don't extend your grace into our
[1:41:52] life we are going to take our own ways
[1:41:55] and we are going to fall into our human
[1:41:57] mind and make decisions
[1:41:59] that are not going to have the right
[1:42:01] outcome Lord Lord we are going to find
[1:42:04] ourselves under pressure
[1:42:06] and make a decision that we should not
[1:42:08] make we are going to find ourselves not
[1:42:10] waiting on you for the answer and
[1:42:12] waiting for you to manifest it
[1:42:15] Lord I pray tonight that you would
[1:42:17] extend your grace upon us
[1:42:22] prick our hearts Lord when we're about
[1:42:24] to do something like that father
[1:42:27] rearrange our thinking Lord call us up
[1:42:30] to Mount Zion father and give us a
[1:42:32] different perspective
[1:42:34] and Lord as your Prophet said may we go
[1:42:37] through these trials
[1:42:39] doing the only thing that we can do to
[1:42:42] prove our love back to you and that is
[1:42:44] to conduct ourselves with joy amongst
[1:42:46] them
[1:42:48] for Lord may we not be a despondent
[1:42:52] people
[1:42:53] for we have the answer to the devil's
[1:42:56] question
[1:42:58] may we conduct ourselves appropriately
[1:43:01] Lord
[1:43:02] Lord we love you and we appreciate you
[1:43:04] we worship you for what you have done to
[1:43:07] us
[1:43:08] done for us Lord and we pray that we
[1:43:11] would just fulfill our portion of the
[1:43:12] scripture now father
[1:43:14] Lord you have called us you have chosen
[1:43:17] us
[1:43:18] Lord I pray you would extend your mercy
[1:43:21] to us and let us be faithful to you
[1:43:24] Lord we love you we ask these things in
[1:43:27] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:43:29] amen
[1:43:31] God bless you brother Lord I know the
[1:43:35] times
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:48] all my works and all my Deeds every
[1:43:54] prayer set on my knees lay before the
[1:43:59] holy
[1:44:01] consuming
[1:44:03] fire all I want to see is
[1:44:12] all I want to see is
[1:44:16] him in me
[1:44:20] all I want to see
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:43] [Applause]
[1:44:50] words of knowledge in his name and
[1:44:54] Healing Hands that touch the lane
[1:44:58] before the
[1:45:03] woman
[1:45:10] Jesus
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:13] all I want to see
[1:45:15] is him
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:20] all I want to see
[1:45:24] is
[1:45:33] up and hear him hear him say
[1:45:44] [Applause]
[1:45:48] well done
[1:45:58] before
[1:46:02] [Music]
[1:46:03] oh
[1:46:04] I see
[1:46:08] [Music]
[1:46:11] one to see is hear me
[1:46:17] all I want to see
[1:46:22] Jesus
[1:46:32] amen
[1:46:34] oh I want that character
[1:46:38] amen I have no power in myself to
[1:46:40] produce it but I believe his brother Ben
[1:46:43] said we've been given a word
[1:46:45] we've been given a word amen instruct us
[1:46:48] to teach us to show us the way and that
[1:46:51] word wasn't just preached it was
[1:46:52] demonstrated before us
[1:46:54] the life of a prophet
[1:46:56] amen whatever dial has to be turned in
[1:46:59] me that click me into that channel I
[1:47:01] want it clicked in me too
[1:47:03] I don't want to think carnal I want to
[1:47:05] think spiritual
[1:47:07] in any and he quoted the prophet when he
[1:47:09] said all that we can take with us this
[1:47:11] character and then the prophet asked
[1:47:13] what kind of character will we take with
[1:47:15] us
[1:47:16] I can tell you what kind of character I
[1:47:18] want to take I know what my heart is and
[1:47:21] where my desire is but it's going to be
[1:47:22] by his grace and it's going to be by his
[1:47:24] word and I learned tonight that it's
[1:47:27] going to take a whole lot of patience
[1:47:30] a whole lot of waiting on the Lord a
[1:47:33] whole lot of being still and doing
[1:47:36] nothing with everything around me
[1:47:37] screaming for action
[1:47:40] have you ever been there where
[1:47:40] everything around you screaming for
[1:47:42] action but you have no idea what to do
[1:47:43] that's the time just to wait a little
[1:47:45] longer until we know what to do
[1:47:49] amen I'm sure job wanted his trial to
[1:47:51] end
[1:47:53] I'm sure job wanted the pain to go away
[1:47:56] I mean look at the pain that man was in
[1:47:58] physical pain emotional pain he was
[1:48:01] being now not only losing all of his
[1:48:04] natural resources all of his assets he
[1:48:07] now is being challenged by his wife
[1:48:09] she's turned against him become like an
[1:48:11] enemy to him amen then this physical
[1:48:14] pain that he has in his body and then
[1:48:16] the pain of rejection where his friends
[1:48:18] are now accusing him of not even being
[1:48:20] the right kind of believer
[1:48:23] amen it didn't get better for him every
[1:48:25] stage it kept getting worse and kept
[1:48:28] getting worse and kept getting worse and
[1:48:31] God ordained this trial because there
[1:48:33] was something there was a character
[1:48:35] leaving in Job that God knew and God
[1:48:37] knew that job could meet the challenge
[1:48:39] but he also knew Job needed to gain
[1:48:41] something
[1:48:42] foreign
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:45] there's so many challenges that come our
[1:48:47] way and maybe God knows what's in us
[1:48:49] maybe he knows better what's in us than
[1:48:51] we know what's in us and we think
[1:48:52] there's no way I can endure this trial
[1:48:54] but he's already known that you can
[1:48:57] but there's also something you and I
[1:48:59] need to gain in the trial
[1:49:03] say God
[1:49:04] help us to be patient
[1:49:07] and then one thing that's beautiful
[1:49:09] about patience when we wait
[1:49:11] [Music]
[1:49:13] you know when we know exactly what to do
[1:49:15] we do it and all of a sudden we start
[1:49:17] sharing in the glory of the Lord
[1:49:19] this happened and I knew this and this
[1:49:21] word came to mind I took this action and
[1:49:23] look it all worked out
[1:49:26] but when you have to wait because you
[1:49:28] don't know what to do and you don't have
[1:49:29] the answer and it doesn't come easy
[1:49:32] and you have to wait on God you have to
[1:49:33] wait for God by the time you get to the
[1:49:36] end of that trial you say I had no idea
[1:49:38] what to do I could not solve my problem
[1:49:39] I had to wait and supernaturally God
[1:49:42] provided an answer
[1:49:44] then all of a sudden who gets all the
[1:49:46] glory you're not sharing in anything
[1:49:47] because you had no clue what to do you
[1:49:49] had to wait because you didn't have the
[1:49:51] answer
[1:49:53] amen
[1:49:55] that's why it's good to wait
[1:49:57] and let God be the mighty one Among Us
[1:50:01] let's just humble ourselves before him
[1:50:03] and keep him in position amen and keep
[1:50:06] trusting and keep waiting
[1:50:08] for God to come and see
[1:50:10] God is good
[1:50:12] man this was a good good instruction
[1:50:14] tonight good instruction I want to take
[1:50:18] it home and make it part of my life
[1:50:20] amen God bless you all I'm going to give
[1:50:23] a very special welcome to Sister Hannah
[1:50:25] Levy it's good to have you she's been
[1:50:27] away for a while with Bethany but it's
[1:50:30] good to have you back for a visit God
[1:50:31] bless you it's good to see you here man
[1:50:33] it's good to see you all may God bless
[1:50:35] you
[1:50:36] amen as we go may this be more than a
[1:50:39] sermon may become a life lesson and I'm
[1:50:42] I'm sure that we're going to get an
[1:50:43] opportunity probably tomorrow some of us
[1:50:45] will get to apply this amen and I pray
[1:50:47] that God will bring this back to my
[1:50:49] memory quickly so that I can apply when
[1:50:51] I meet the next challenge
[1:50:53] amen let's just bow our heads and thank
[1:50:55] God lord Jesus we thank you
[1:50:57] for your word I don't want to leave this
[1:50:59] building without saying thank you Lord
[1:51:01] thank you for giving me an opportunity
[1:51:03] thank you for opening my eyes thank you
[1:51:05] for giving me the instruction from your
[1:51:07] word to go out and live this life you've
[1:51:10] called me to
[1:51:11] and I pray God that you'd be gracious to
[1:51:14] us so that you would bring this back to
[1:51:15] our remembrance Lord and the time when
[1:51:18] the pressure comes on maybe as early as
[1:51:21] tonight or tomorrow it'll come but God
[1:51:23] you've given us good instruction may we
[1:51:26] take it to heart and may become a
[1:51:28] practice in our lives
[1:51:30] and may Lord through the practice of
[1:51:32] patience may we gain all the things that
[1:51:34] we need to gain
[1:51:36] so that we can take this perfect
[1:51:38] character with us
[1:51:41] Lord you told us that the sleeping
[1:51:43] Saints are waiting for this church to
[1:51:45] come to perfection
[1:51:47] well they're not they're waiting they're
[1:51:49] they're in support they're crying out
[1:51:51] for us to keep pressing on because they
[1:51:53] without us are not yet made perfect
[1:51:56] for there must be a display of your life
[1:51:59] and flesh once again
[1:52:01] and it must be in your bride form
[1:52:04] oh God help us to be patient as you
[1:52:07] display yourself help us to wait as you
[1:52:10] manifest yourself once again upon this
[1:52:13] Earth in human flesh
[1:52:15] In the Flesh of your bride
[1:52:17] God is going to take a whole lot of
[1:52:19] trust
[1:52:20] a whole lot of patience
[1:52:23] as we trust you to do what only you can
[1:52:25] do
[1:52:26] we love you Lord and we want to just say
[1:52:29] we're thankful for the food that you've
[1:52:31] given us today
[1:52:33] God may it become Lord more than a
[1:52:35] tickling sermon in our ears or something
[1:52:37] more than we can just say I agree with
[1:52:39] that or I agree with this or don't agree
[1:52:41] with that maybe go beyond all of that
[1:52:44] may become a real manifestation within
[1:52:46] us
[1:52:47] and a way of life all around us
[1:52:50] we love you God I pray to go with your
[1:52:52] people Lord as we go from here
[1:52:54] bless us keep us safe use us and magnify
[1:52:58] yourself through us
[1:53:00] and declare yourself to the world

[1:57:10] my heart
[1:57:12] foreign
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:52] if I just need to just leave my vessel
[1:57:55] and let him have his way
[1:58:01] Glory
[1:58:02] to change me day by day
[1:58:09] before
[1:58:11] in the manger of my heart
[1:58:14] [Music]
[1:58:24] of play
[1:58:26] and you move me day by day
[1:58:30] let your words
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:40] let your words
[1:58:42] before
[1:58:44] in the manger of my heart
[1:58:49] [Music]
[1:58:55] living science
[1:58:59] and only day my day
[1:59:03] let your word be born in the manger
[1:59:09] [Music]
