========================================

praise the lord while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to revelations chapter four we'll go quickly into the word we're going to keep on with the seals and praying that the lord will just keep opening revelation to us so we can see amen what he wants us to see amen i just want to greet a visitor a special visitor we've got all the way from germany my brother david cornmesser here god bless you this is brother gerd's grandson and he'll be staying with us for eight weeks and he's going to be working with brother franco and learning some things and it's exciting to see him god bless you brother good to have you here and jordan and rebecca god bless you it's really good to have you here and you guys have multiplied since last we saw you it's god's law of multiplication praise the lord so we're happy to see you here amen let's let's begin reading here in revelations chapter 4 verse 1. after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter. and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one side on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald and around about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god and before the throne there was a sea of glass like under crystal and in the midst of the thrones and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we ask that you would come to us now lord and you would just teach us lord just speak to us just open our hearts to receive your word lord i pray that you would take this vessel of clay and that you by the power of your holy spirit would begin to operate lord and speak words of eternal life through these lips lord that we might hear what you have for us now that we might understand what you're trying to teach us by revelation lord and that we might grow in that grace and knowledge of you lord i pray that you have your way have preeminence in this place tonight in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated praise the lord i just want to remind everybody that we're going to have two services this sunday so it's going to be a little different a little bit special i'm going to take the morning service but then in the afternoon we have brother already robertson visiting with us so he's going to take the second service and we're going to shoot for about four o'clock to have that second service so we hope that you'll be able to come back for that one and then pray for brother craig he's traveling out friday him and his family to go to west virginia to preach for brother tim mckinney and then from there he goes to north carolina because he's ministering thursday night at the missions conference so just remember to keep him in prayer during that time and then if we could bring up the powerpoint please i think this evening on one sunday we talked about the first seal and we showed how how god had a method here in operating and he shows us through the scriptures but i want to take the time to talk about the four beasts this evening because this is an important very important subject and some things we need to understand as we go along here so we see we're talking about the seven sealed book of redemption and you know the most important thing in the prophet's ministry was the opening of these seals it meant everything to him and and it means so much to us if if you brought your seal book there's something i want to look at here in the fifth seal and the fifth seal and i understand not everybody has the exact same seal book but in mine it's page 301 in the fifth seal and it's paragraph 35 of the fifth seal page 301 but i just want to read this together because i want you to see brother mentions this or phrases like this many many times in the seals he said you can't possibly hit all the things because you could take that just one of those seals and stay just bring it right through the scripture right down see it'd take months and months and months and you still wouldn't have it because the seal itself ties the entire scripture from genesis to revelations one seal of it my goodness i think there's something we we need to see he's saying one seal one seal of it ties the entire scripture from genesis revelations my i say god open my eyes open them wider than they've ever been give me revelation on your word you know because brother branham taught us that on them tapes and them seals on them tapes is rapturing grace is that what he told us so so they took from the tapes and they transcribed into a book so in this book is rapturing grace but there has to be a transition from rapturing grace grace is unmerited favor we didn't earn the opening of the seals we didn't deserve the opening of the seals we didn't deserve to be placed in the seven seal book of redemption we didn't deserve to have part of that inheritance and our name recorded under that inheritance and then we didn't deserve to have it unlocked in our day and revealed and given to us we didn't deserve that it was grace so when you listen to that tape that is the grace of god to you when you hold this book the transcription of the tape that is the grace of god to you but we have to go through a transition phase because grace has to turn into rapturing faith amen is that true and we haven't come to rapturing faith yet because the moment you receive rapturing faith then there's nothing that can stop you from taking a rapture so we've got to come to a full rapturing faith so there's a process that has to go from rapturing rapturing grace to rapturing faith and that process is revelation because faith is a revelation so we have what we need what we we've been given the grace we've been given the word we've been given the unlocked mysteries and now what we need is revelation of what we're holding in our hands what's coming into our ears and that revelation faith is a revelation so rapturing faith is rapturing revelation of the rapturing grace hallelujah how many is happy to be alive right now this moment in time i would rather be here than anywhere i'd rather be right where i know god is continually unveiling himself taking the rapturing grace by revelation producing rapturing faith and we we caught the principle of god and we don't want to miss this because there's the difference between church life and spirit life church life and the message would have you come into another system of belief forsaking another one moving into another one because you see that it's right you agree with it you see that it matches the scripture but once you make this transition now church life the deception of the white horse rider would then move you into this this this new church this new belief this new system and then have you plant yourself there and coast all the way waiting for some magic wand some fairy dust something magical to happen to to give you rapturing faith and bring you in a rapture that's church life that's the deception of the antichrist he doesn't mind if you believe or quote or or confess he doesn't believe that he just doesn't want you to grow in rapturing faith he doesn't want your faith to increase as long as you can make this transition and stay there you'll be fine but when you start to grow that's when you get in trouble and the apostle paul said grow in grace and the knowledge of jesus christ grow none of the purposes of the fivefold ministry in ephesians is that we might all grow into the head which is christ so in no time do we grow into the message we get the revelation that this is true understand malachi 4 move in and then we hit a plateau and we plateau all the way across until magic fairy dust sprinkles down from heaven and then we get a body change that's not going to be the way it is friends remember they're coming to the pinnacle this is a pyramid we're growing into rapturing grace the the rapturing faith the faith you have today should be far outshine the faith you had two years ago if we're looking back and saying ah when i first came to the message so many things happened in supernatural time and 10 years ago i can tell you god was real and god was moving 10 years ago brother banham said if that's where your testimony is you're backslidden because you should have a testimony of what god's doing now today growing in grace and knowledge of jesus christ amen growing up into the head it should be producing more faith and more faith and more faith as he unwinds the bible amen we're never taught to coast along and just drift waiting for a rapture you'll never make it this word should be bringing you up higher and up higher and up higher if we see year after year there's more compromise in our life less sincerity less consecration than you've been duped by the antichrist and it's time to come back and repentance and say god bring me back to my first love amen praise god brother brother branham says in the second seal second seal paragraph 137 and i'll give you a page number here page number 175 in the seal book that i have second seal page 175 paragraph 137 you can't make them scriptures lie they're going to be truthful always the only thing don't try to line your thought or the scripture up to your thought but line yourself up with the scriptures boy i'm telling you that's where that's where he's settled that's where he moves in and starts to work in reasoning and logic and intellect and start taking the the word and begin to compromise it because you know what everybody else believes it this way and all around me it's this way and it's been this way for the last 30 years and the message and this pastor allows it and that church allows it and my mom and dad and all this other stuff all that is is tainting the word in our minds we got to take the minds the way the word the way the prophet showed it to us the way he taught it to us the way the word is written and let that let our let our lives match up to that and not making the scriptures line up to what's been for the last 30 years or what my experience has always been or my understanding or what everybody else believes forget that take what the prophet has told us and take the word amen the illumination of the word on the scriptures and then make your life match that but line yourself up with the scriptures that's that's then you're running with god no matter how much you have to cut away or lay aside line up with that i say lord give me some grace that's what we want lord that's what we want so we see here we've got the the four the four beasts the four living creatures around the throne and i want you to notice and brother bran points this out over and over again notice the correlation between these living creatures and the throne of god because you'll find that these living creatures or these anointings or these powers are always around the throne amen they're always associated with the throne of god and they're always around the throne and so we know that these these are the powers by which he's going to combat uh the devil the antichrist spirit now we've got this quote we've used it several times now when we go to breaking these seals you're going to see it goes plumbed back in the scripture all the way back for each one of these seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals see every mystery of the bible lays in these seals and the seals cannot be broken until that time so praise the lord so now we know that the seals have been open rapturing grace has come we're saying lord give us a revelation i want to stop for a minute because usually i get going so fast i forget my name and where i live and everything else when i get up here but i just want to mention this this image here if you see this image you start back here and see this image here you've probably never seen this image anywhere before but this is a description this is drawn based off a description of what brother branham describes in the seals of what they look like one was wrapped around and the end stuck out and a seal put on the end then another one wrapped around that and then seal put on the end and another one wrapped around that and he says you would have to open a seal and unwind it and then open the next one and unwind it and so these were not found on the internet this is this is artwork that was done by a brother in poland named brother joel and and he's been helping us on some of our stuff we're working on the studio he works closely with brother franco and all we did was send him the quotes of brother branham what we wanted and he drew this image for us and then he drew this image for us i just want to say thank you that was wonderful i also want to give a special thank you to brother franco because i forget every time but i did not build this powerpoint myself so if you're sitting there thinking wow that's nice it's easy to see i had very little to do with it in fact anything that doesn't work on the powerpoint now is because i've changed it around it was perfect when i got it so we appreciate brother franco and all that he does so we found out that there's two vines and only two two spirits and only two and we're dealing with two vines two spirits and we're dealing for with war that started in heaven and came down to earth all right one vine began by disbelieving the word one vine began by deceiving and it's going to end at some point and forever be abolished and there's going to be on this earth one vine and only one vine and so the the warfare that we're in is warfare between the two vines and you're on one or the other you're not in the middle amen you're on one or the other there's no gray area there's no switzerland in this battle amen everybody is involved and they're on one vine or the other and then that cuts pretty sharp but that's the word of god that's the way it is and so now we find out we wore not with flesh and blood but principalities powers and rulers in high places and we find out that that we're battling spirits not people and so in the in the fifth seal brother bram says now notice as the antichrist went forth on his beast of ministry god sent forth the beast to combat it because it's warfare it's the battle of the two vines now watch then every time the beast rode on his horse the antichrist rode on his horse on his beast to announce his ministry god sent his beast also in his own mask to announce his combat to it now the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises a standard against it and so when the enemy went out as an antichrist god sent a certain type of power to meet him and he went out again as a red horse rider another color another power another ministry god sent another one after him to combat it to hold his church sent the third one again and sent the his third beast come and announced it he sent the fourth one so god has not left the church without a defense but god has sent a defense and he's been a battle plan for the church so you find there's a path of the antichrist but there's also a path of christ and so when the enemy comes in like a flood god will raise something against it all right and we want to find out what is raised against it and how do we fight this antichrist now now there was a quote that that i didn't read sunday i'd like to read to from the first seal and he says the white horse rider went out who is he he's mighty and his conquering power is a great fellow in his conquering power amen and he says you want me to tell you who he is he's the antichrist that's exactly what he is because you see jesus said that the two would be so close together until it would deceive the very elect the bride if it was possible so we find out that the y horse rider is the antichrist spirit that's not new to us we understood that but what is amazing is we learned that it was deception a subtle change from the word something slightly different right and we found out that he he's he is he's a mighty conqueror and he came forth to conquer so the white horse rider and on the white horse beast came to conquer conquering and to conquer but remember he comes with no crown and he comes with no arrows he has no authority over you and he cannot harm you amen but he come as a mighty conqueror with mighty conquering power so you have to understand it looks so innocent it looks so harmless but he is a mighty conqueror in the white horse face when he begins as a very very slight deviation from truth and looks white and looks innocent and looks harmless like it possibly can't harm you amen he's beginning to conquer as soon as you accept that as soon as you accept anything other than the pure revealed word any deviation from the pure revealed word of the hour this the minute you in your mind begin to accept something other than that now he's beginning to conquer your life because he's a mighty conqueror with mighty conquering power but he looks innocent harmless and not able to hurt you and he's got no authority over you so we can't play around with the white horse you can't tease around you can't try it out for a while you can't take a few steps down this road to feel it out and you can always come back you'll have you so far down the road you won't realize what happened to you when you wake up no deviation whatsoever from the revealed word of the hour that's the heart cry of the brine so we find out that the the plan here is he's going to ride now i want to just point out a few things uh there's there's definitely some things i want to get to here but but i want to point out a few things as we go now he comes on a white horse but satan has never desired to ride a white horse in your life he doesn't want to ride a white horse because if he wanted to ride a white horse he would have wrote it all down through the church ages but it wasn't the white horse that he wants to ride he wants to ride the pale horse but he's he's crafty right he's cunning amen and so what he knows he knows you'll never fall for spiritual death you'll never fall for eternal separation from god so he's got to come in with ever so slight a deviation something that looks very good very reasonable harmless and then he begins to deride on that until you put a crown on his head because who crowned the white horse rider it was the church that crowned him so you put a crown on his head and when you do he changes horses same rider new horse he moves to a red horse because he didn't want to ride the white horse anyways he's not sad that he's leaving it behind and moving on the plan is working perfect then he rides the white horse or the red horse for a while but the red horse is not his horse of destination he wants to get off the red horse as quickly as he can and he wants to get onto the black horse why because all these three powers wound up into one is where he wants to be and he wants to be in the pale horse which is spiritual death eternal separation from god don't forget he's a mighty conqueror but when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises a standard against it he sent these beasts to combat these antichrist riders so you have to know where you are and what god sent and you know how to fight now we see the devil changes four beasts meant what power that he he was revealed what power he revealed to the world and how they ended on this pale horse let's look at the powers of the beast to combat them and i want to back way up to look at these powers let's go to genesis chapter 3. i love how brother branham says everything begins in genesis and it winds up in revelation two books of the bible that the devil hates one that shows his origin and the other one that shows his defeat but you know what two books of the bible we love the book of revelation in the book of genesis so genesis chapter 3 verse 24 this is after the fall after the judgment of man and it says in verse 24 so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life so this is the first mention of these four beasts we find them right here and we're going to read where brother bram talks about this but as soon as man falls and he's judged now he's put outside of eden and in the east side of eden he put cherubims with a flaming sword to keep the way of the tree of life now that's interesting wording that he says to keep the way of the tree of life he didn't say to keep them away from the tree of life but to keep the way of the tree of life and so we find that these beasts are going to serve a dual function amen they are to keep the way so they're to keep the way pure they're to keep the way unspotted they're to keep the way uncluttered so nothing that can defile is allowed to come into the presence of god but also they keep the way so that when the conditions are right and the conditions are met those who come under the right conditions now can approach back to the east gate eastern gate of eden and we've approached back to the eastern gate of eden hallelujah brother branham says in revelation chapter 4 from 1961 he said the lord sent forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword a flying flaming sword which turns every way see the four beasts there's only four ways you can go east north west and south these cherubims had a flaming sword at the gate of the garden to keep the way of the tree of life because if ever if man ever got a hold of the tree of life then he he could live forever and these cherubims first mentioned was placed at the east gate of the garden going four ways i should have made that a little different he's drawing up on a chalkboard now he should have made that a little different from that i can't do it justly to god's orders and things so that you'll know what i mean there's the garden of eden and this is the gate right there opens up here swings out and at this gate there was cherubims how many would love to see what he's drawing oh my gate swings out and there's cherubims cherubims and remember it doesn't say cherubim it says cherubims cherubim's was placed there to guard what the tree of life that's what they was to guard the way of the tree of life now remember they're guarding or keeping to keep means to guard so if you if you if they bring you into prison they bring you into a keep they guard you so to keep the way of the tree of life is to guard the way of the tree of life the way who is the way jesus where is it reflecting from here is the holy place here are the cherubims you notice i jumped a little further down you notice these cherubims that john saw here must have been interested in keeping the tree of life they must be interested in human beings or read genesis getting back to genesis again they kept the tree of life guarded it the way of life the way of life how was the way jesus said i am that way i am that bread that come from god out of heaven if a man eats this bread he'll live forever now there is a way back to that tree of life you get it now at this i want to show now and make this shirt it's an altar this must have been an altar at the garden of eden i'll tell you why do you remember both cain and abel come up here to worship so they shows that god's altar was moved and set here at the garden of eden and the only way back to eden is by the altar here you are again see back to eden through the altar and they were kept that way there guarded that they couldn't get back there until this altar was covered with blood remember they're keeping the way of the tree of life and if they're keeping the way the guarding the way of the tree of life then these four powers or these four anointings are essential to finding the way back to the tree of life they're critical to coming back to the tree of life he said oh god can't people see it nothing but the blood there has to be an atonement a mercy seat there this altar of judgment must become a mercy seat and when this altar if the blood is lifted they will stand at that judgment day the fire of god's wrath to guard that tree again only one thing will enter in into this gate to eden again will be through the blood of jesus christ you see it now notice there's cain and here's abel all right now both boys come up to this gate to worship is that right so it must have been god's altar is that right and before this altar they built substitutionary another altar here's the true altar of god is in the heart of man so now he's saying that that after the sin and after judgment they were moved out and now there's an altar of god placed on the east side of eden and man wants to go back into eden where the tree of life is but he can't go in to eat until he crosses this altar this altar is a judgment now and the in the in the and the beasts are acting as judges get in there they're around the judgment seat keeping people away from the tree of life until blood makes this judgment seat a mercy seat and when blood comes upon it it's a mercy seat and now now what was keeping them away brother branham said now is driving them back into the tree of life so the four beasts who are saying you can't come you can't come you can't come because there's no blood as soon as their blood they're saying come come come come now these are now these are the four beasts that are combating the antichrist spirit so you got to keep that in your mind now brother brahm talks all about these altars then he says the true altar is in the heart of man now these four beasts are there so if the true altar is on the heart of man but there's no blood yet on that altar then that's a judgment seat in your own heart if there's no blood there it's a judgment seat and as long as there's no blood there the beasts are keeping you away from the tree of life keeping you away from the tree of life keeping you away from the tree of life but the moment there's now blood on the altar of your heart and now it's not a judgment seat it becomes a mercy seat they're saying come come come you meet the conditions come to the tree of life who's who's doing it who's guarding the way the four beasts they have been since the fall brother branham said these seals unlock the mystery of the entire bible genesis 3 4 beast amen ezekiel 4 beast four beasts revelations four beasts praise god what are they doing they have something to do with the throne of god guarding the shekinah glory of god and they have something to do with judgment so let's keep looking all right now we're getting into so much subject matter that i just want to go slow and let it be absorbed i'm trying to take bite-sized pieces but every bite is a mouthful friends every bite we take is like oh wow i could chew on that for a week but i just want to get to a few things now now we look at the the tabernacle in the wilderness and we've got this this picture here showing that the israelite camp was a huge camp that surrounded the this uh this tabernacle in the wilderness and in this tabernacle god said that his shekinah glory would be there his presence would be there sitting on the altar or on the throne amen and when when when when he was on that throne his presence was among the people and we find this is this is just a picture of that old testament tabernacle with the shekinah glory of god coming down but but around the encampment of israel were camped the tribes and the tribes were camped in a certain order and each tribe had a banner that represented their tribe and on those banners were different animals and different symbols and those symbols had something to do with that tribe so we find the encampment around a roundness and we won't go into it we've been into it before but we find you have the standard of the lion the tribe of judah of the ox of ephraim you have a reuben the man and you have dan the the eagle so you find that god is showing this all the way through the scriptures now when they come and there's a place for his throne there's a place for his mercy seat on earth then he must put around that mercy seat he must put the throne guards he must put the four beasts amen so everywhere that god is the four beasts are around god around his throne they have to be their friends and so now he moses is sitting the tribes in a certain order dan you camp here judah you camp here and ephraim you camped there and and and and all of these you camp ruben you camp where i tell you to camp and when they would raise up their standard and they would stake it in the ground you would see around the tabernacle in the wilderness the lion the ox the man and the eagle and they were there for a reason and the prophet of god tells us now we find out that they were the guards to the mercy seat they watched the mercy seat nothing come to it crossed over the tribes that first before it get to the mercy seat every man willing to give his life every israelite in the camp would die before anything could enter into the camp over there and take that mercy seat and now we find out that was the old testament order now see now israel becomes the guard to the mercy seat israel themselves becomes the guard so if enemy any enemy wants to come in because they represent the four beasts because they're a camp north south east and west as lions man and eagle now their purpose is to keep the way to the tree of life keep the way to the throne of god keep the way to the mercy seat now if any hittite or jebusite or anything else would come along and try to battle their way in every man to a man would give his life to keep them from the mercy seat why because they don't come in the right condition they don't come with the right blood they don't come with the right offering they're not pure seed of god they're not the chosen they're not the elect they're not true israelites they're not coming by the way of the priesthood they're not coming by the way of the blood so they can't come to the mercy seat so to a man they would sacrifice their life to keep them from that but but they were set in camp they were set in battle array they were there guarding the throne and nothing could come to it unless you were chosen elect of god coming the right way and if you were chosen elective god of the tribe of israel and you were coming with a sacrifice in your arms that you were going to offer through the proper channel through the proper priesthood they kept the path clear they kept it open they kept you safe they kept you protected all the way until your blood could be offered on the altar of sacrifice and you could you could have a substitutionary offering atoning for your sins it had everything to do with who you were and how you were approaching if you were the wrong seed you were and you come the wrong way they would slay you dead but if you were the right seed coming the right way they would keep you safe and protected and nothing would stop you from getting to the mercy seat now when you see your position you see the position of the four beasts now you know who is it who is it that's keeping the way to the tree of life who is it that's driving you into the tree of life keeping you safe and protected and guarding your way all the way back till you come in contact with the tree of life it's these four anointings which is nothing but the ministry of christ hallelujah christ is a lion christ as an ox christ is a man christ as an eagle keeping you driving you protecting you all the way back when you come with no blood on the altar of your heart keep you away when you have blood on the altar of your heart they're ushering you in hallelujah and in the new testament or we find the same thing that was guarded the mercy seat oh i hope you get it the mercy seat is still guarded still got the guards we found out that those guards are matthew mark luke and john guarding the book of acts the acts of the holy spirit among the apostles which is the book of acts of the new new testament and the four writers of the gospel matthew mark luke and john all guarded that mercy seat to show that it is god the holy spirit today each scripture matthew mark luke and john every one of them will be back up the true gospel of the lord jesus christ and the acts of the holy spirit so now we're coming to the book of acts but you cannot get to the book of acts because what is the book of acts the book of acts is the shekinah glory of god coming to another throne wherever god puts his throne and wherever his presence come you have to have the four beasts because in the temple if it's at the altar at the east side of eden they've got to be there amen if it's in the tabernacle in the wilderness they have to be there amen if it's in the new testament church it has to be there hallelujah so brother branham is telling us that there's guards guarding the way to what to the presence of god the mercy seat and how do you come you can only come now before you could come with a lamb with a dove with a goat with an oxen whatever that was required for why you were approaching you could approach unto god according to his way but something changed when jesus christ came and the gospels tell the story of the transition and now the only way to come to the throne of god to the mercy seat to the personal presence of god himself is to come through the gospels and the gospels keep the way to the tree of life amen in the gospels guard the way to the tree of life because the gospels tell you the story and ministry and life of jesus christ so what do they do they drive you to the tree of life they keep you away if you don't come the gospel way but if you come the gospel way then they usher you into the presence of god because those gospels tell you exactly what jesus christ did when he was on earth how he acted what his character was what he did his works his life they tell you all of that so now when you get to the book of acts all the book of acts is is a replica of the life of jesus christ and in many member body so the gospels telling the story of jesus christ bring you to the life of jesus christ sitting on the throne of a human heart acting the same way he always acted brother branham said if if you have the spirit of beethoven in you right now what will you do compose music if you have the spirit of diliger in you right now what will you do you'll rob banks but if you have the spirit of jesus christ in you what will you do you'll do what you saw in the four gospels and what was seen in the four gospels was played out again in a mini-member bride and a body in the book of acts hallelujah what was it it was a transition from the temple amen built built by solomon restored by herod it was moving from the temple from the old way over into the hearts of men and now you have to have four guards it's amazing if you look up amen if you look up old bibles and old pictures of matthew mark luke and john over matthew the book of matthew will be a lion amen mark will be a ox amen luke will be a man amen the old church amen the original church and the 19 fathers and three 19 fathers they knew this to be true they knew matthew mark luke and john was the lion the ox the man and the eagle and if you look at ancient documents you can find those same images now brother brahm didn't come to bring new he came to restore back to what the first fathers already knew that this is the way to the tree of life these gospels are the path to the tree of life it is the display of the tree of life and if god ever puts out another branch they'll write another and if there's another book of acts being written there then there has to be four throne guards around the bride hallelujah amen god is good so now guarding the presence of god the throne of god the shekinah glory of god is matthew mark luke and john revelation chapter 4 just exactly the tribes of israel camped around guarding their earthly guards of the right to the ark now what are they regarding the right to the ark they're not just guarding the ark they're guarding the right to the ark because if you were israelite pure in blood and you came the right way you had a right to the ark if you weren't you didn't have a right they were guarding they were earthly guards of the right to the ark mercy seat mercy seat nothing could come anywhere around it without crossing those tribes crossing one the lion crossing the man the intelligence of man crossing the workhorse as an ox or crossing the eagle the swiss swiftness of it the heaven the earth in between and all around you see they were guards and above it was the pillar of fire brother nothing touched that mercy seat without the approach and the only thing that could approach it was through the blood right they regarding that that that altar on the east side of eden and nothing could cross back into eden to the tree of life until there was blood on that altar there was a flaming sword turning every which way and they could not come back until the blood was on the altar but after the blood came on the altar now you see the temple guards moving to the throne and where is the throne the throne is in the people by the baptism of the holy ghost now this is so important we're going to make a transition watch it close the only thing that could approach it was through the blood can't approach there's four powers four anointings four beasts to keep you from the tree of life if you don't have blood but when you have blood they're there to keep the way open to the tree of life brother branham said one time they were driving you away now they're driving you back to the tree of life so around the throne of god amen the mercy seat are these four beasts he said now the the message the token which i asked you to listen to i hope some of you got a chance to the new testament means new covenant the blood life the blood life itself is the token now get that the blood life itself is the token the life out of the blood is the token remember the old testament the actual blood of the lamb had to be applied here it's the token of the blood it is the life from the blood that's in the person for the token hallelujah let's look at let's look at this again now look just to believe it is not enough to walk around where it's at isn't enough see that's to make yourself worse for he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it's sin those borderline believers jesus spoke of them the same thing hebrews the sixth chapter for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have been made partakers of the holy spirit have tasted of the good word of god and the world to come if they shall fall away to renew themselves again to repentance seeing that they crucified to themselves the son of god and count the covenant of the blood wherewith they they were sanctified now get what he's getting ray say the chemistry there sanctifies it ain't the token the blood is not the token now the life is the token so he's referring back amen to the passover to where there had to be a token or there would be death and it was the blood of a substitute and that substitute had to be visually applied this is this is the the part that is so super critical it had to be he said on display you couldn't be ashamed of it you couldn't come halfway to it he said you couldn't kill the lamb and have blood in the bucket that would do you no good you couldn't just splattered around the ground you had to do exactly what the prophet told you to do and the prophet told you to take his sip and dip it in the bucket and strike it on the lid on the doorpost and you had to do it exactly the way he said and it had to be applied so to kill the lamb wasn't enough to collect his blood wasn't enough to have it in your possession wasn't enough but to avoid death you had to be applied oh this is so super important this is the whole message of the token he's saying it's not enough just to say you believe it it's not enough to come to church and associate with it it's not enough brother braham said you say brother branham i agree with every bit of it he said that's good but that's not it yet he said you've got to take it take it into yourself become one with it and then let it change your entire life until the token which is not the blood of jesus christ it's the life of the blood of jesus christ and the life that was in that blood when he was walking the sea of galilee when he was walking in nazareth in capernaum and jerusalem that life that was in him then that life has to be in you now but it can't be in a bucket by the door it's got to be on display it's got to be so that everyone passing by can see the blood it's not questionable it's not it's not confusing it's either on or it's off amen in the days of the passover it wasn't a question mark it wasn't there's a dark spot there on the lymph i can't tell could that be blood it may not be blood if that that's not the right kind of application that's not what moses said moses wanted it clearly blood red splashed all over the door all over the lentil all over down so everyone could see that we've accepted the sacrifice you can't be walking by your neighbor and wondering did they put it on did they not put it on i can't see it if i get my microscope out can i see a little blood here or a little bit there you can't say well let's apply it faintly [Laughter] it's got to be on display for everyone to see you shouldn't be walking around as a believer and people wondering whether or not you're a believer wondering whether or not you're sold out to jesus christ you've given your life as a total sacrifice they shouldn't be saying maybe he is maybe she i'm not exactly sure maybe if i get a little closer maybe if i ask him a few questions it should be on display the life that was in the blood amen the life of jesus christ comes into you you won't write music like beethoven you won't write banks what you'll do is you'll live the life of the word you'll live it out every portion of it you'll sacrifice yourself you'll lay down your life you'll say i don't want what i want i want what god wants if the word tells me this i'll do it if it kills me i'll do it if the word tells me to pay tithe and give offering i'm going to do it if it's the last thing i got if they come and collect my lazy boy chair or they come and repossess my car the first is going to go to god until there's no mistake anymore that the blood is applied amen too many believers have been too long with confidence and blood in the bucket it's not blood in the bucket it's not saying well i have it in my heart if you have it in your heart it better be on your door it better be an invisible manifestation for all the world to see amen that you've accepted the atonement and under that condition you're ushered back to the tree of life the sixth seal if you'll remember we talked about the sixth seal several weeks ago and i'm gonna touch into it now because we realize and i realize now that i am so far away from notes and stuff but hey praise the lord amen i don't exactly know what i'm going to do praise god let's just go all right in the sixth seal we find out that the seal is the judgment seal now when we're first studying the seals we think all six seals have nothing to do with us it's to you know the tribulation period and it absolutely is the tribulation period and during that tribulation period there'll be a calling out of the 144 000 they'll be the two witnesses moses and elijah that preached to the jews calling out the 144 000 and all of that takes place that doesn't change anything in the seal but brother branham says this sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word because the word brings judgment his word is a sharp two-edged sword dividing amen the sword of the word divides and it cuts pretty close it can divide the spirit and the soul which you yourself can hardly divide in your own being sometimes you can't tell is this me or is this the lord amen your heart man's heart is deceitfully wicked who can know it your own your own spirit is deceiving you all the time your spirit's carnal of the world but the life that's in your soul by the baptism of the holy ghost that part is of god but the other part's not of god and it's so close that sometimes you can't discern it yourself but the word is what separates the word is what splits it right down the middle so you can discern what's me and what's god what's of the enemy and what's of god by what by the word and the word is there to divide all of that wrong nature all of that wrong thinking it's to cut it away and cut down to the soul the word divides so so what uh what i want to explain if i could just explain it this way these guards have a purpose and the purpose is to keep the way to the tree of life so that there's some they keep away and that there's some they usher in do we see that that's the way the prophet explained it so that means these guards are bringing us through judgment right because we have to they have to bring us through judgment so we know whether or not we're coming with the right approach and the right of condition of the right seed so that we can go to the throne of mercy so that we can go to the tree of life because if we're of the wrong seed not predestinated seed if we're of the wrong seed and come the wrong way with the wrong approach they're there to keep you away so the four beasts bring you to judgment hallelujah revelations chapter 3 let's turn there together my goodness there's never any time the word is eternal we're eternal creatures stuck in a time of condition and a condition of time i mean and we're becoming increasingly frustrated by it especially on sundays and wednesdays so we find out in revelations chapter 3 verse 14 he's saying unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things saith thee amen the faithful and true witness that beginning of the creation of god so now god's speaking to the laodicean church age then we come over here to verse 19 he says as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent so the ones that he loves now god god's love is not like you're in mind love it's not an emotional love it's not based on feeling whatsoever it's a perfect love and it's charity and god those whom he loves he rebukes and he chastens so that we will be zealous and repent so we have to come through judgment amen to come to the lord all right and we find in the church ages i i don't have time to go through it now but you read chapter 2 and chapter 3 you find the word repent shows up over and over and over and over and over again he's constantly the spirit of god is constantly saying repent repent repent repent and here in the seventh church age he changes it before it was repent repent repent now let's be zealous and repent this is a whole different layer when we come to the final stage of the journey for the church it's a whole new layer of repentance this is being zealous and repenting brother graham said in the legacy in church age but god is calling for another zeal it is the zeal to cry i am wrong that's what he's looking for in this last stage for those who are going to come out of laodicea who are going to rise above it they have to be zealous for repentance they have to be zealous to say i'm wrong not a casual i'm wrong or oh yeah i shouldn't have done that but zealous to repent not walking through life and you know so many times you find that that nobody would ever admit to doing this but this is the truth so many times we won't give our full self to the word of god because we're afraid of what we will uncover in our lives we won't give ourselves completely to the message of the hour we won't read the books listen to the tapes be in fellowship because we're not sure we can pay the price that it requires so it'd be better for us not to hear than to hear so we're afraid to hear but whether you take the time to listen to it or not amen you're still responsible to it but so many times we're afraid to hear more because it requires a repentance and so people you ask them they're living a mediocre life and struggling you're saying well how much are you into the word i'm just having struggles you're having struggles because you're not in the word you're not on the word because you're afraid you can't pay the price it takes a total death to self it takes a complete surrender sunday and wednesday won't do it it's got to be every day feasting on the word of god and making a total sellout to whatever i find i find whatever it says it says however it strips me it strips me however it exposes me it exposes me but i'm saying god if it's wrong take it away i don't want it not that we look halfway or are we dabbled just a little bit because we're afraid of what we'll hear the prophet of god saying i don't want to be afraid i want to say lay me bear strip me down take that sword and cut everything off even my own spirit until there's nothing left but what's in the soul the message oneness prophet says now when adam and eve listened to the lie of the devil the holy image of god left them their fellowship was broken with god we read this on sunday their fellowship of oneness with god was broken the very minute they listened to the lie of the devil that broke their fellowship and the very minute that you listen to the lie of the devil it'll break your fellowship that's the very minute that you go out from the presence of god like she did is when you failed to take god's word just as it is you want to know when your fellowship with god was broken it was the minute you didn't take the word just as it is some excuse some reasoning some explanation for why this won't work here and the minute we do that we break our fellowship with god first peter 4 17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god hallelujah that doesn't mean now now we have to be careful that we realize the scriptures that we're going to show especially this scripture doesn't show that the church bypasses judgment according to the scripture judgment must begin at the house of god so the bride cannot bypass judgment but the bride must come to judgment but she'll never be in the tribulation and she'll never come to the white throne judgment but it doesn't mean that she doesn't come to judgment right what is the whole purpose of the four guards around the throne to keep out and to let in they're judging first corinthians 11 31 and 32 for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world no one bypasses judgment if you judge yourselves you're not going to be judged if you don't judge yourself you're going to be judged [Laughter] you're going to be judged why because then the lord will chasten you so that you won't be condemned with the world because if you bypass judgment now you'll stand in judgment later and god will not let his children bypass judgment now because he does not intend for them to stand in that judgment so if you don't judge yourself you'll be judged and chastened to the lord that you will not be condemned with the world that's grace friends that's absolute pure grace of god that if you fail you fail of your own accord to judge yourselves and you always judge yourselves by the word not by your neighbor not by the church not by other churches you judge yourself by the word amen and if you don't judge yourself you will be judged amen and if you don't and you will be judged that you shall be chastened so you won't be lost that's god's grace to us later seeing church age it says as many as i love i rebuke and chase and be zealous therefore and repent this is the same message that john had as he cried out in the religious wilderness of pharisees sadducees and heathen repent there was no other course then there was no other course now there was no other way to go get back to god then there is no other way now it is repent change your mind turn around repent for why will you die if you don't repent you'll perish that's what john said repent or perish there's only two choices first john 1 19 if we confess our sins he is faithful than just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and the first seal he says now how can a man say that the bride of christ goes into the tribulation i can't understand it see she's take she took away from the tribulation if the church has been judged what if the church has been judged and they have judged themselves and have accepted the blood how can god judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless so how do you bypass judgment is to come to judgment and if you come to judgment amen you will bypass judgment remember there was a stone cut out of the mountain without hands remember in every body comes in contact with this stone the stone was cut and the stone is christ which is the word and the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and it says everyone who falls upon this stone will be broken to pieces but all whom the stone falls on will be destroyed those who fall on the stone which is christ the word your life is broken to bits so that he can reassemble you according to his fashion according to the word so you either of your own accord fall on the stone that's by yourself will by your own by your own submission you either fall on the stone or the stone falls on you and if the phone stone falls on you you're destroyed if you fall on the stone you're broken up but not lost i say god break me up just mess me up so that i can be perfect hallelujah we're not content friends with a mediocre life that's not going to produce a rapture we are supposed to be the full manifestation of the full life of jesus christ on display if we can't come to that we're not coming to a rapture it is not it we have to get away from thinking a denominational thinking now denominational thinking is that i just cruise along and i keep going except jesus he's in my heart and i keep doing whatever i can first kingdom and someday he'll come down pick me up and away we go if you think that in the message you are lost because you've got to shout a voice and a trumpet amen and that voice is the voice of the archangel and that voice is in a certain place and that place is in the bride of jesus christ his voice is in the bride amen and there has to be something that we do in the rapture cycle there's got to be some a position that we come to of faith that we rise to we can we can't say i'm just going to go along like this and i'm going to accept everything to be true and one day god's going to come down split the skies everything's going to change no brothers and sisters it's you he's doing it through you in you with you and without you and in you he's not doing it and as long as we're sitting on our hands brother said as long as you're not doing what god leads you to do you're paralyzing the program of god and we're sitting on our hands waiting for god to do something supernatural when he's already done something supernatural he came back in the full power of his word he came back with his full life and all you have to do to get it is take and receive his word and if you take and receive the revealed word you get the life but you reject the word you reject the message you reject the messenger you reject that life there's no we gotta we gotta change friends we got to get away from 50 90 95 is good enough we got to stop with 99 or i've been the believer 35 years we've got to throw all that out and throw it in the trash can it means nothing today i've been a believer since the prophet of god was here that's wonderful we respect that and honor that but you can come to that place amen like they followed moses through the wilderness all that time and they still rejected judas came with the lord he come all the way through healing campaigns and he was there when when when hundreds left he was there when the 70 left and he remained but he didn't go all the way in to be part of that mercy he didn't get that blood life on his altar amen so he was rejected 50 75 95 that's not it it's a full surrendered life if brother branham if the prophet of god said you do this then do it if he said you don't do this then you don't do it we're not just sitting around having a picnic waiting for god to do something powerful he's doing something powerful now he's taking a human life and a fallen condition and by the baptism of the holy ghost with the full power of the word he's growing a church stronger and stronger and stronger she's taking him out of his word she's overcoming every obstacle because you're called to be an overcomer he's not the overcomer you're the overcomer he said i have already overcome and because i have already overcome i've got a reward for those who will overcome you can't depend on his overcoming he's already overcome now he's waiting for your overcoming and your overcoming is by the revealed word of this hour as the message of god has given to us in this day all of it hallelujah praise the lord brother ben tells an interesting story i'll just relate it to you here he says i do believe in purgatory does that confuse you i do believe in purgatory but i believe it's right now you purge your own soul purgatory means to purge when you see you've done something wrong get out there and clean it out of you by confession and crying and fasting and praying someone even laughed at me when the lord came here not long ago and gave me a vision i always wanted to see about binding that serpent how many remembers the vision of him binding the serpent he was the serpent was trying to strike at a friend it wouldn't strike brother try to strike a fan and he says you can bind it all right and so he binds it and it winds up in like a s pattern it chokes itself out blue smoke goes out of it he says you can unbind it and he speaks and unbinds and he binds it again so he's got this whole experience that's what he's referring to see that i always wanted to see about binding that serpent i always wondered how to i should step out like that when that's what i've wanted all my life then i began to fast and pray and he said what'd you do that for i said in there he's talking about in the vision he said i was not sincere enough remember in the vision he said you must be more sincere after he come then i wanted to purge myself not wait till you die and let some priest try purging you purge your souls brother brandon i mean he lived a life right and he lived the life in 1961 he has this vision and he's told he can bind the serpent and after that what does he do he says you must be more sincere he says here afterwards i went to fasting and praying because in there in that vision he told me you must be more sincere sincerity matters but it's got to be sincerity based on truth so we come back to the judgment seal now whenever you come to judgment you have two paths every judgment has two paths remember the white throne judgment you're either sheep or goats separated as sheep or ghost come into eternal life go into eternal damnation there's two paths always to judgment one path is rejection which always leads to destruction the other path is repentance that puts you in position to receive the seventh seal when did brother branham open the seventh seal in the sixth seal it was in the sixth seal because the seventh seal is not an not not a thing it's not a set of happenings the seventh seal is a person the seventh seal is the lord amen and it was the lord doing it all along remember remember when we talked about uh boaz and ruth boaz is going to redeem ruth and he comes and he gives her six measures of barley and six because the six reveals the seventh and six where's the seventh it's the one dishing out the sixth remember brother branham said when he revealed those six seals who revealed those six seals the seventh it was the seventh seal revealing the six seals all right in you know the the first miracle that jesus ever does he goes to a wedding it's a mirror it's amazing his first miracle takes place at a wedding because that's what this whole thing's about anyways and they don't have any wine so he tells them to take six jugs six jugs where's the seventh it's the seventh that's filling the six with wine that's converting the water to wine so it's always six and the seventh is always shown in the six so now in the sixth seal because brother branham told us that that sixth seal began under hitler and mussolini in those in world war ii and the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet which is world war two sound at the same time so brother brenner's ministry takes place under the sixth seal during the time of the sixth seal and in that ministry the seventh seal is revealed where in the sixth and these four beasts are bringing you to judgment and what's taking place in judgment you come to judgment and the word is a sword it's going to divide you have to either go to rejection to destruction or to acceptance and when you go into septons it'll put you in position the blood life will come on your heart your altar of your heart and it will put you in contact with the seventh seal the person himself but you have to go through the sixth seal how many says take me through the six you know because if you don't go through it now you're going to go through it during the tribulation period why for the purging of your souls brother branham said the foolish virgin is purged during the tribulation because she rejected the purging of the bleach of the blood of jesus christ and i say i want the purging of the blood the the bleach of the blood of jesus right now and the way it purges you is to cut off of you everything that's not the word the sword has to come and judge what is word and not word and the sword has to be laid even to the root of the tree all the way to everything that's not of christ is cut away and the only thing standing there now is the real genuine life from the soul connecting to the seventh seal because remember it's going to be the bride the bride of jesus christ is the seventh seal remember the bride coming of christ the seventh seal has something to do with the coming of the lord and we're told that this is now the bride coming of christ so it's attached to the seventh seal when does the bride come the bride comes under the sixth seal and the sixth thousandth year since the fall and the number six which is man's number in man which is number six is number seven man's number is six inside of man is number seven the holy ghost baptism in man in carnal flesh in man is the seventh seal on display but you'll never come to it unless you pass through the judgment seal your flesh has to be judged your spirit has to be judged amen and cut away from you brother branham says joining church will never cover sin no dry eyed confession will ever cover sin it takes sorrow and repentance get this sorrow and repentance and the grace of god to cover sin for the blood of jesus christ the one that god killed at calvary to cover sin he said the bible tells us when we've done wrong that we should purge our souls by the holy spirit get down let the holy spirit reveal to us that we're wrong doing wrong and there stay before him till you die out purging our souls in ephesians church he says now it does not mean that she could not have repented it does not mean that we cannot repent we can but it must be quickly it must be a true heart cry to god in sorrow and then god will restore the glory shall come again how many wants the glory to come again the glory of the life of jesus christ the bride on display it will only come through repentance amen and repentance comes through the sixth seal because the word is here to judge us you either fall on the stone or the stone falls on you you're either judged now or you're judged later but nobody bypasses judgment we're not getting away with anything and we'll find if we're seed of god the children of god they don't get away with anything other people can it works for them it seems to go all right they seem even to prosper they can live in hypocrisy in a hybrid condition halfway believing the message it seems like they prosper they get the raises they get the jobs they have the house they have the cars it seems like everything's working out remember the seed of god don't get away with anything because if you don't judge yourselves you will be judged and chastened to the lord that you will not be condemned with the world you say why why is it always me why nothing works out for me why am i always going through the ringer why is the preacher always preaching on me why am i always crying out to the lord why am i always wrong because you're the seed of god and if you don't judge yourself he's going to judge you and chasing you that you will not be condemned with the world because everybody comes through judgment and the seed of god come through it now thy rod and thy staff they comfort me now they guard the mercy seat when god is in his shekinah glory where is his holy gosh a kind of glory where is his true throne in the heart of men where is the shekinah glory in the heart of men where are these four beasts guarding the way keeping the way to the tree of life guarding what the shekinah glory of god only letting you come through the sixth seal to the seventh never letting you come and compromise where's the shekinah glory at the mercy seat is that right they guard that shekinah glory listen friends when it goes to show that every scallywag can't come there and take of that you've got to be prepared before you come into the presence of it doesn't happen haphazard it doesn't come from without sacrifice you can never you could have never approached to the presence of god without a sacrifice and you still cannot come into his presence without sacrifice only now it's personal sacrifice of my own life and i lay it down and i choose to die to have his and so now the four beasts are still around the throne and you see through the church ages lion ox man eagle what were they they were around the throne what was the throne those genuine believers that were coming through each age and what was surrounding the throne of god these four beasts keeping the way to the throne of god god bless you saints let's all stand hallelujah well we've got some more notes for later god is good friends it's getting very very hard to preach less than an hour and a half because the word each one of these seals goes genesis to revelations they unlock the entire mystery of the whole bible and i say god i want it all i want every jot and every tittle every precept upon precept every line upon line if i've got to get it here a little and there a little i want it all amen let's just pray musicians if you'd like to come dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this wonderful time and god we recognize lord that this isn't a time to jump up and down lord this isn't a time to shout this is a time to come to the stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands lord it's time to throw ourselves down like you did in gethsemane and die completely to ourselves lord we don't want our own way anymore we don't want the way that the culture tells us social norms or what we've adapted through through the message over years we want what you called for lord in your word in the original lord your original desire in your heart for a bride that's what we want to come to lord we want to look like that image you had of her before the foundation of the world we want to come to that now and we know it means a lot of shaving down but lord we're saying shave us down i raise my hands and i say shave me down lord i'm laying myself down on the altar take this sacrifice consume it with your fire burn all of the dross out of me lord if you've got to beat me and roll me around and beat me do it lord until you bring me to that perfect place god forgive us lord forgive us for accepting things we should have never accepted lord forgive us for doing things we should have never done but lord i just pray that if we can repent according to what your prophet said the glory will return lord we pray that your glory lord would return the glory that was poured out lord on the day of pentecost we're praying that that glory would return god through repentance lord that we would judge ourselves now by your word and that you would bring us back to that position lord to that original church position that that day that that holy ghost was poured out on the day of pentecost lord that's what you're bringing us to that's what we want lord cut out of us lord by the sword of your word everything that's not like you anything that does not align to that cut it out lord help us to come to your word and your word only lord that's our desire that's what we long for we pray that you just purge our hearts now lord as we lay before you reveal to us anything lord that's in our lives that you want out that's not according to your word that's not a faith and that pray lord that you would purge it and how god by the power of your holy spirit just move it out of our lives and lord give us faith to accept your word we love you god we lay down our soul we date on our lives before you pray that you'd consume us lord lift us up lord to be that mercy seat on this earth let your shekinah glory flow through us in jesus christ's name we pray amen i just want to say there was a day in one day of the year in all of israel and it was a day when they would celebrate the feast of atonement and that day is the day that the high priest would go in and he would go with blood all the way to the mercy seat of god because if there was blood on the mercy seat then there was mercy but if there was no blood on the mercy seat it became judgment instead of the presence of god blessing israel the presence of god would have cursed israel so this was the most significant day of the whole year because if the high priest wasn't accepted they would have to purify another and send him in because if there was no blood on that mercy seat then that that presence of god would slay them all because they could not stand judgment there was no blood of jesus christ yet to abolish their says they couldn't stand judgment they needed mercy the only way that they could find mercy is when that high priest would go in but it's amazing that if you go back and read in leviticus 16 and leviticus 23 on the day of atonement on this day of atonement they were commanded every man to afflict his soul the day of atonement the most significant day the greatest day when the high priest would go in and cover the sins of ignorance with blood all the sins that they were doing that didn't know about was going to be completely covered they were going to be free it wasn't a day of rejoicing it wasn't a shouting it wasn't ascending gifts back and forth it was a day that they would fast and mourn and afflict their souls and humble themselves and they would become to afflict means to become low amen to bow down to humble yourselves and they would begin to mourn and they would begin to weep why because of their sins the feast of atonement the necessity to go in and offer blood was because of their sins and they weren't jumping up and down they were coming to the judgment seal and they were going to be they were going to be accepted or rejected now if we think ahead to israel uh to the 144 000 there's two witnesses that are going to come and those two witnesses come it's going to be during the tribulation period why because the jews have refused jesus christ and now they have to be purged in tribulation and 144 000 even have to give their lives amen as payment give their lives because of the rejection of the nation of israel and so now they're there and the two witnesses are witnessing to them and when they realize jesus christ is the atonement and they realize that they were wrong and they go to accept him it's not a day of dancing and jumping and shouting everyone separate into their own homes and mourn as one who's mourning for their only son when they see jesus christ and they recognize him and they see themselves as wrong they afflict their souls everyone's separated into their own house and they said where did you receive these wounds and he said in the house of my friends there's a times and many times in our lives that we have to come to the sixth seal now remember this happens during the sixth seal the 144 thousand the affliction of the souls we have to come to the sixth seal friends and it's not a time of dancing and shouting and running about it's a time to mourn it's a time to afflict your soul because you recognize i'm wrong and i've been wrong and i've been wrong for a long time and without the blood of jesus christ i'll never be right then you mess up again and you come back to mourning and afflicting your soul and you say god without you i'll never be right i can never be right there's nothing in me that will let me be right in this flesh body i'm i in my flesh there's no good thing no not one i'm going to fail you every time lord i'm coming here afflicted of soul and i'm saying god if you don't consume this sacrifice if you don't kill me dead and give me a new life i'm never going to make it it's a time of afflictions it's not a time it's not you don't receive the baptism of the holy ghost running around the room and shouting and rejoicing you receive it in tears amen and fasting and praying down saying god i am nothing absolutely nothing and without you i'll always be nothing i'm damned and i'm doomed and i'm predestinated i've been preconditioned to fail but i have to have a new life i have to have a burning out i have to have a total consuming of the sacrifice and you've got to totally consume this sacrifice it's travail of soul friends it's weeping then you go along and you find out that all sticky cockleburg nature gets in the way and you find you trip up again and you do something you shouldn't have done you come right back to travail a soul say god i now know over and over again there's nothing good in me nothing worthwhile who can deliver me from this body of death say lord i need you again we look back on our lives and we see we've taken this too lightly transgress the word of god disobey a prophet of god take what the culture tells us is acceptable and accept it take what other people in the church are doing is acceptable and doing it just going along in a church life and and becoming in a lukewarm condition we've taken it too lightly friends it's time we say god no more i want to die all over again i want you to consume me all over again lord give me your life give me your spirit reveal your word help me not to fail you anymore lord we are constantly coming to travail of soul brother branham said we purge our souls daily so we backslide every day and he said we purge our souls daily there's got to be a time where every day we take this serious that's why we come to communion we come serious we come serious and say lord have i let the white horse rider affect me am i in deception somewhere in my life open my eyes and show me lord let me die a greater death let me die and come to communion and receive life let me recognize your atonement your price that you paid to cover those sins but i've got to confess them i've got to repent of them so that they could be under the blood we come serious we come we come with affliction of soul we come as to the feast of atonements and the feast of atonement those two witnesses sound the seventh trumpet bringing them to the feast of atonement where they mourn as everyone mourns sometimes we have to mourn because it's our sins that put him on the cross we have to mourn because it's our own choices that have caused us all our own problems and in mourning there's a psalm that says thou has turned my mourning into rejoicing because through mourning you get a fresh perspective of the seventh seal the person of jesus christ and the baptism of the holy ghost and that that fellowship that was broken comes back like this brother branham said when we do wrong the holy ghost takes its flight right and he said when we repent he comes back broken fellowship because of deeds done but through repentance restored fellowship and through the through the sixth seal you get a fresh vision of the seventh and that's when we come up after afflicting the soul and it says thou has turned my mourning into rejec rejoicing my night and today my affliction into dancing how many wants to go that path i'd rather be a little tore up now than tore up on the day of the white throne judgment brother brahm said a christian has always tore up wanting to do the will of god it's okay to be tore up it's okay to afflict your soul it's okay to repent and it's okay to receive that fresh outpouring of the holy ghost that renewed vigor that renewed vision that renewed fellowship amen let's bow our heads and pray again god lord as we're speaking of atonement i just feel lord that we need to just lay our lives down too much is consuming us lord too much of the world too much of our own families too much of our own ambitions our own dreams our own desires god is a body we're asking that you would just consume us all over again burn out the dross all over again we can't do this ourselves lord we're never going to make it we're never going to be good enough but god if we can die you've promised to resurrect us lord if we don't die now and let you resurrect us in newness of life by the baptism the holy ghost we'll never take the resurrection in the rapture we have to die now to be resurrected now if we ever hope to be resurrected then god let us die let us die but there's a promise lord if we'll go down in the likeness of your death we'll come forth in the likeness of your resurrection i pray lord if we die to ourselves right here tonight i pray god that you would give us lord the likeness of your resurrection let us come forth lord god fill us with your spirit afresh lord pour out upon us the holy ghost give us that fresh renewed fellowship with you lord and use us for your glory put us in the work put us in the service put us in the action lord and let us be lord your very glory on display in this planet we ask it lord that you would do it through us we thank you for what we've done lord as we go our own way we go back to our homes we pray lord that you would help us not to forget what we've learned here tonight that there's a path lord to the mercy seat there's a path lord lord and it has to be covered in blood which is your life we pray god that you would give us that life we ask that you would cover us lord and you would accept us lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless your friends we appreciate you being here god is good brother branham said the way up is down if you want to be exalted be a base if you want to see how great you can be see how low you can become there's nothing wrong with affliction of soul and abasing yourself not a thing brother branham did it all the time you know in the prayer lines when brother brendan would call the prayer line he would call the prayer line then he would start talking and chatting and you know people are standing there then he'd make a comment you know i'm waiting on something right i'm just a man i can't help you unless he comes how many has heard that brother brethren gets to this point over and over again on the tapes just listen to it the lion's called they're standing there he begins to greet people and tell testimonies and start talking and you can tell he's waiting for time and the angel of the lord's not coming and so there's nothing that he can do and he even confesses i'm waiting on something and then the very next thing he starts doing is repenting now if i've said anything wrong here tonight if i've done anything that's wrong if i've heard anybody i'm sorry go back and listen to the tapes that's his path he's waiting lord is not coming what's he do he immediately starts repenting before an audience of people if i've said anything wrong if i've done anything that's not right lord if i've done anything wrong would you forgive me and then he goes he's here he's here why repentance always brings you to the seventh seal he demonstrated to us the path he showed us exactly how to do it he goes to pray for a baby amen after having lied and the angel lord said how can you pray for that baby after you lied what does he do he goes right back and he repents amen he doesn't just repent to the lord he goes back to the lawyer he lied to he had to make it right with his wife he had to make it right with the lord and then he come right back with a fresh renewed seventh seal experience and he prays for the baby and god heals the baby amen the way up is down if you want to be great belittle humble thyself before the lord let the word afflict you let it purge you let yourself be destroyed be cut fall on the stone be broke to pieces that's the only way to life friends god bless you let's sing brother tommy what song we have yeah let's sing that song consume me lord we're gonna let you be dismissed we've been a while but if you would like to just sit and pray if you'd like to come to the altar and pray you don't have to leave this atmosphere if there's things that you know that you've allowed you shouldn't have allowed you can purge your soul we can come to judgment now there's many who have to wait and they have to come to a white throne judgment to find out what's going to happen to them but we don't have to wait to find out what's going to happen friends we can come to judgment right now tonight we can come to the judgment of the word and we can let the word cut the world off of us and we can know our eternal destination with the lord we can know our position we can know it now we don't have to wait we can stand judgment tonight if there's anything you've got to make right make it right brother branham said he's only as far away as your repentance a woman come to brother branham she says i i she tells him about a dream that she has and he says i see it and he says you're feeling all washed out right and he says and you want to come back to the lord you've left the lord and you want to come back to the lord and she says yes he says you're back [Music] why because nothing can separate you from the love of god you're a seed dean of god you'll always be a sieging of god his grace was to you before the foundation of the world all that you need to do is repent and he's only as far away as your repentance she wanted to come back he says you want to come back she says yes he says you're back how many want to come back you're back just lay it down and repent and sacrifice whatever it is that's hindering cut it off let the word cut it off and you're back in fellowship with god sing the song together [Music] me lord me more like you [Music] or [Music] [Music] peace [Music] [Music] lord [Music] answer me lord me more like you
