[11:01] for Brother Steve Hollinger and by the
[11:03] grace of the Lord he's went home to be

[11:11] his reward amen passed on to us the off
[11:15] body amen and I'm thankful for our
[11:18] brother I was um been reflecting you
[11:22] know on the last week as our brother's
[11:23] been declining and on all that brother
[11:27] Steve has done for us as an assembly
[11:30] we don't ever want to forget that God
[11:31] used that man and the gifts that he
[11:33] placed in that man for all of us we've
[11:35] all benefited by his service to this
[11:39] local body and I appreciate that and you
[11:42] know he's Health has been failing for a
[11:45] while the last year has been a tough one
[11:47] for him and the last several months been
[11:48] really difficult but oh I thank God that
[11:52] he had a reward waiting for him at the
[11:54] end of life's journey and now we just
[11:56] want to remember the family and pray for
[11:58] them them and do all we can to underg
[12:00] guard them and strengthen them and
[12:02] support them and show them our love and
[12:05] as my custom is last night I was praying
[12:07] in here and I was walking the aisles and
[12:10] then I come to the empty green seat in
[12:12] the back where Steve was been sitting
[12:14] for the last couple years and oh I just
[12:16] broke down not in sorrow for my
[12:19] brother it's we just feel a loss amen
[12:22] separation this life is really tough I'm
[12:25] so glad that we've learned not to live
[12:27] for this life
[12:29] because these separations come they've
[12:31] come they'll come again if the Lord
[12:34] dares but oh when the time of Separation
[12:36] in the time of grief I'm so thankful
[12:39] that we know the truth and we've not put
[12:41] all of our our life and all of our love
[12:44] and all of our efforts into this
[12:46] Dimension alone into this barriers or
[12:48] this wall of a natural life but all that
[12:50] we believe goes far beyond the
[12:52] limitations of this life and it will
[12:54] continue on and our fellowship will
[12:56] continue on and our love will continue
[12:58] on and all that God's done for us it'll
[13:00] never cease the Eternal things move on
[13:03] and on so we just want to pray for the

[15:10] preeminence in the service in our lives
[15:13] in everything we want you to have your
[15:16] way I pray God that you would touch this
[15:18] human
[15:19] vessel that's weak and has its own
[15:22] frailties and inabilities but God it's
[15:25] your chosen method it's your chosen way
[15:28] to preach the gospel Lord I pray as I
[15:31] relax Lord that you would take over and

[15:56] and we ask God that you would have your
[15:58] way with us in Jesus Christ's name we
[16:01] pray
[16:03] amen amen God bless you all let's turn
[16:06] in our Bibles while we're standing if we
[16:08] may to Second Timothy chapter
[16:11] 3 second Timothy chapter 3 while we're
[16:14] turning there I just want to say how
[16:16] much I enjoyed the Bible Believers
[16:18] Christian School program on Friday night
[16:21] if you got to go it was amazing all you
[16:23] children who are in it you did a great
[16:25] job amen you blessed me and sister viddy
[16:27] God bless you did a tremendous job and I
[16:30] was very blessed by the message that was
[16:33] portrayed and the kids did a great job
[16:35] in reminding us of God's Great victory
[16:37] in our lives when Christ paid the price
[16:40] to bring life to us amen so I was really
[16:43] proud of him and really blessed by the
[16:45] the whole
[16:46] thing amen let's look at 2 Timothy
[16:49] chapter
[16:51] 3
[16:55] verse all scripture is given by INSP ins
[16:58] spiration of God and is profitable for
[17:00] Doctrine for reproof for correction for
[17:03] instruction and righteousness that the
[17:05] man of God may be perfect thoroughly
[17:07] furnished unto all good works so I want
[17:10] to highlight that all scripture is given
[17:12] by inspiration of God and is profitable
[17:15] for Doctrine for reproof for correction
[17:18] and for instruction and righteousness
[17:21] let's turn now to chapter 4:1 we'll just
[17:23] go down chapter
[17:26] 4:1 he says I charge thee
[17:29] therefore uh I charge thee therefore
[17:31] before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who
[17:34] shall judge the quick and the dead it is
[17:36] appearing and his kingdom preach the
[17:39] word be instant in season out of season
[17:43] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[17:46] longsuffering and Doctrine for the time
[17:49] will come when they will not endure
[17:50] sound Doctrine but after their own lust
[17:53] shall they Heap to themselves teachers
[17:55] having itching ears amen God bless bless
[17:58] you as you have your seats
[18:02] amen wanted to open with this to show
[18:05] that the word of God what what part of
[18:08] the word of God is given for is this
[18:10] instruction before I do that I want to
[18:11] welcome our visitors it's good to have
[18:13] brother Levi and his family again and
[18:14] he's brought a whole host of Fellowship
[18:16] along with him so God bless you all
[18:18] we're so good to have you the Fishers
[18:19] God bless you it's good to have you here
[18:21] as well I've seen many of you Arley back
[18:23] here and brother berer and brother berer
[18:25] and brother berer and and his family so
[18:29] it's good to have you all I may not
[18:30] remember everybody's names but God bless
[18:33] you all you're very welcome and it's
[18:34] good to see you all again just good to
[18:36] be together amen it's good to have
[18:39] something to gather about it's good to
[18:41] have something worth talking about it's
[18:43] good to have something worth living for
[18:45] amen and this world is falling apart
[18:48] amen it's going into chaos and it's
[18:51] going into ruination amen and we see
[18:53] that people are losing hope they're
[18:55] moving into despair they have nothing
[18:58] amen everything that they were getting
[19:00] excited about they see falling apart but
[19:02] I praise God that the thing that excites
[19:04] and thrills us is not falling apart but
[19:06] it's moving higher and higher and higher
[19:09] it's becoming more of a reality in our
[19:11] lives day by day so we thank God for
[19:14] that so we see that that the word of God
[19:18] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[19:21] God and is profitable so all the
[19:23] scripture is
[19:24] profitable for Doctrine for Repro for
[19:27] correction for instruction and
[19:29] righteousness and then he goes and
[19:31] admonishes uh Timothy how to use that
[19:34] word and and then when we get into uh
[19:37] chapter 4:2 he said preach the word be
[19:39] instant in season out of season reprove
[19:42] rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and
[19:45] Doctrine so the word is here to correct
[19:48] us the word is here to guide us the word
[19:50] is here to instruct us the word is here
[19:52] to encourage us the word is here to
[19:54] guide us and enable us it's it's here to
[19:56] accomplish everything in our lives that
[19:58] God wants to accomplish will be
[19:59] accomplished by the word amen and I'd
[20:03] like to continue on and the thought
[20:05] we've been on we've been talking about
[20:07] judgment we've been talking about the
[20:09] new birth and and and we last Sunday I
[20:12] believe it was last Sunday I've lost
[20:14] track of a little bit of what I've
[20:16] preached when but it's been wonderful
[20:18] amen the Lord's just been flooding into
[20:19] my heart amen over and over by
[20:21] inspiration more and more keeps coming
[20:24] and what I'm wanting to preach today is
[20:26] actually something that I had on my
[20:27] heart from the very beginning a thought
[20:29] that dropped in but as I went to look at
[20:31] it things just kept blossoming kept
[20:33] expanding but but praise God we want we
[20:36] looked at last Sunday life from judgment
[20:38] and how the World Views judgment One Way
[20:41] amen but it just depends on which side
[20:43] of judgment you wind up on and we we saw
[20:46] that life comes from judgment and we we
[20:49] realized that back in Genesis chapter 1
[20:51] and chapter 1: 2 we find the Earth in a
[20:55] state of judgment amen Darkness covering
[20:57] the face of the deep amen it's been
[20:59] judged something happened to the Earth
[21:00] and the Earth is under judgment amen but
[21:03] it was under judgment because it had
[21:05] fallen some way from the word of God and
[21:08] now it was in a judged state but God
[21:10] judged it amen not to destroy it not to
[21:14] eliminate it not to throw it away he
[21:16] judged it so that it can go on serving
[21:18] his original purpose and intent and his
[21:21] original and purpose intent for creating
[21:23] the Earth was so that his family can be
[21:26] expressed on the earth so that God can
[21:28] come tangible in human flesh upon the
[21:30] Earth and expressing himself by a
[21:34] family
[21:36] amen so when that when that purpose fell
[21:39] and fell into ruin he judged it amen but
[21:41] immediately he went by the spoken word
[21:43] and by his word he brought light and
[21:45] that light began to bring life and brood
[21:48] over the Earth and start bringing life
[21:49] back up amen until he brought it back
[21:52] from chaos to a Garden of Eden amen he
[21:55] judged it but he didn't leave it in
[21:57] judgment he Jud judge it to bring forth
[21:59] a fresh new life to bring it back to its
[22:01] original
[22:02] purpose and we see that in the Garden of
[22:05] Eden when when he when he made Eden then
[22:08] he planted a garden Eastward in Eden
[22:09] then he took the man that he had formed
[22:11] his son and and from his son he formed a
[22:14] wife and he brought the two together and
[22:16] he placed them there and he said it is
[22:18] very good he looked at all that he had
[22:20] done and all that he had made and he
[22:21] said behold it is very good this was
[22:24] God's great picture that he painted for
[22:26] us so that we could see what his desire
[22:28] is what does God want to do God wants to
[22:30] have his sons and daughters on the earth
[22:32] amen and an earth that's in Harmony and
[22:34] in Union and and in love
[22:37] amen but then we saw that it fell again
[22:40] and there had to be another judgment and
[22:42] and this time the Judgment began to fall
[22:44] upon substitutionary offerings on the
[22:46] lamb amen and it was the lamb all the
[22:48] way through until God offered his lamb
[22:52] and his lamb bore judgment for the sins
[22:55] of the world he was was beaten he was
[22:58] mocked he was rejected he was crucified
[23:01] and he was he was absorbing the full
[23:03] Wrath of the Judgment of God he was the
[23:05] substitutionary offering for you and I
[23:08] we should have been nailed to the cross
[23:09] for our sins but he took our place it
[23:12] was a substitution for us he took our
[23:15] judgment when you see Calvary and you
[23:17] see how Bloody and how brutal and how
[23:20] terrible it was he was absolutely all
[23:22] forsaken by the whole world he even
[23:24] asked God why has Thou forsaken me
[23:26] because God had to turn his back on his
[23:29] own son because he was bearing the
[23:31] Judgment of God the wrath of God for the
[23:33] sins of the whole
[23:35] world
[23:37] Amen and in that
[23:40] judgment it wasn't because he wanted to
[23:43] destroy and annihilate and do away but
[23:45] he had to judge to purge to bring new
[23:49] life and three days later we saw the
[23:52] purpose of judgment and the purpose with
[23:54] judgment was expressed and
[23:56] Resurrection amen amen so then we found
[24:00] that we ourselves must come to a
[24:02] personal judgment where we find
[24:04] ourselves in need of Salvation we find
[24:06] ourselves lost amen wandering in the
[24:09] world away and separated from God being
[24:12] alienated amen born in the world with a
[24:14] with a natural man that's at enmity with
[24:17] God and hates the things of God and we
[24:19] find ourselves in this situation and
[24:21] when we find ourselves in this situation
[24:23] there's going to need to be a judgment
[24:25] of the flesh man because the flesh man's
[24:27] under judgment amen and we saw where the
[24:29] prophet of God told us we must climb up
[24:31] on the Altar and lay ourselves upon
[24:33] God's brass Altar and say God I'm wrong
[24:36] amen I'm wrong in my thinking I'm wrong
[24:38] in my desires I'm so far away from your
[24:41] word I'm so far away from what's holy
[24:43] and just and pure God would you come
[24:46] down and burn me with the fire of the
[24:48] Holy
[24:50] Ghost burn out destroy all that's in me
[24:54] that's not like you all of the sinful
[24:56] nature all of the sinful desires God I
[24:59] can't get it out of myself I need you to
[25:01] come amen and and Purge
[25:04] me and what is that purging for it's for
[25:07] new life so you can be born again so the
[25:09] spirit of God can come in and so the
[25:12] seed of God on the inside it's in your
[25:14] soul can be birthed and you can become a
[25:16] new creation in Christ Jesus and you can
[25:18] walk forth you can come off of that
[25:21] altar that brass Altar and the old man
[25:23] is now dead now the new man is alive
[25:26] amen a new creature a brand new babe in
[25:29] Christ so we find that these judgments
[25:32] Are For
[25:34] Life For The Wicked they're
[25:37] Destruction for the predestinated of God
[25:40] they're for
[25:41] life because God has a purpose God has a
[25:44] plan God has an original intent and God
[25:46] will continue Amen to whatever gets out
[25:50] of the way he'll bring it back in the
[25:52] way because God's plan won't be defeated
[25:54] amen and if God has to judge it to bring
[25:56] it back in the way he'll judge it if
[25:57] he's got to chastise whatever he's got
[25:59] to do he'll bring it back in the way
[26:01] because God's plan won't be SW and and
[26:03] if God's plan for the Earth cannot be
[26:05] disrupted if he has to bring a judgment
[26:07] Amen to bring it back in line amen what
[26:09] about this Earth Here amen he's got a
[26:12] plan for this Earth here and if this
[26:14] Earth Here gets out of line God will not
[26:16] spare any judgment God will not spare
[26:18] anything to bring this Earth back to his
[26:22] purpose amen so we see there's a
[26:25] regenerative judgment we saw in Genesis
[26:27] one one one two there's a regenerative
[26:30] judgment he judged it so that he can
[26:31] regenerate it is that right and then we
[26:35] find amen Christ was judged to bring
[26:37] regeneration to bring life amen and now
[26:40] when we judge ourselves and we come to
[26:42] Christ and die out to self and be
[26:44] consumed amen and the Holy Ghost Fire
[26:47] Burns all the droughts out of our Lives
[26:49] amen it's for regeneration it's for new
[26:52] life we find the premillennial judgment
[26:55] and me as we go into Millennium we find
[26:57] the Earth destroyed with atomic and
[26:59] Volcanic fire amen it's a destruction
[27:02] but it's a destruction for what it's a
[27:04] destruction for regeneration so that we
[27:06] can walk out on the ashes of the wicked
[27:08] and brings new life upon the Earth then
[27:11] we find a post-millennial destruction
[27:13] amen after the Millennium amen when when
[27:15] we have the Battle of Gog and meog when
[27:17] Satan is loosed again upon the Earth
[27:19] because he was bound for a thousand
[27:21] years loosed again and brings another
[27:22] deception and gathers the world against
[27:25] Christ against the holy city amen and
[27:27] this time fire from God comes down and
[27:30] the heavens are on fire and burns it all
[27:32] off and destroys it once
[27:36] again what was it destroyed for for
[27:38] regeneration to bring forth new
[27:42] life amen we need to have a
[27:46] regeneration judgment experience in our
[27:49] lives amen where we desperately come to
[27:53] God and say God I'm not right and I'll
[27:55] never be right on my own but I'm laying
[27:58] myself out and saying God consume me
[28:01] Lord consume me with the fire of your
[28:04] spirit and make me a new creature in
[28:08] Christ
[28:09] Jesus but we find also there's another
[28:12] kind of judgment n the Judgment I want
[28:14] to talk about today there's a corrective
[28:17] judgment so there's a regenerative
[28:19] judgment and there's a corrective
[28:21] judgment and this correct in judgment is
[28:24] like a father with a
[28:26] son it's like Like a Shepherd with a
[28:29] sheep it's the one that keeps us in
[28:32] line it's the one that keeps us from
[28:34] wandering off the path as a sheep
[28:37] because sheep are prone to get lost amen
[28:40] but the great Shepherd and Bishop of our
[28:42] souls he's always there and the the in
[28:45] the 23rd psalm David says thy rod and
[28:48] thy staff they comfort me amen the staff
[28:51] is a guide that they guide with the rod
[28:53] is a rod of correction that he corrects
[28:55] he'll Smack That Sheep amen Shepherd
[28:57] will smack the Sheep amen not because
[28:59] he's mad at it and not because he wants
[29:01] to drive it away but because he's
[29:03] correcting the sheep and he'll use his
[29:05] Rod Amen to hook it over the sheep and
[29:07] pull it on the shoulder and bring it
[29:09] back in the path and move it away from
[29:10] danger and move it over here and if the
[29:12] staff won't work the rod surely will get
[29:15] the attention amen and that's a good
[29:17] shepherd right the Good Shepherd amen
[29:21] his rod and his staff they comfort me
[29:23] because I as a sheep have a tendency to
[29:26] wander and get lost I need a Shepherd a
[29:29] bishop of my
[29:32] soul amen so this is the corrective
[29:34] judgment that we're talking about amen
[29:37] after
[29:38] regeneration we need a Shepherd we need
[29:42] correction we need a father who will
[29:45] guide us as children along the way and
[29:47] say no don't do that that's dangerous
[29:49] and stop doing that or or come over here
[29:51] or move over there we need a father we
[29:55] need this
[29:56] correction so it keeps us in line amen
[30:00] and we also will find as we move on it's
[30:02] like the pruning of a
[30:04] plant a plant in order to maximize its
[30:07] growth and continue to grow and produce
[30:09] it needs
[30:11] pruning amen we'll find that in the
[30:13] scripture let's turn to Revelation
[30:15] chapter 3
[30:23] together Revelation 3: 19
[30:34] he says in Revelations 3:19 we know this
[30:37] is speaking to the leodan church age he
[30:39] says as many as I love I rebuke and
[30:42] chasen be zealous therefore and
[30:45] repent behold I stand at the door and
[30:48] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[30:49] the door I will come into to him and
[30:51] will Su with him and he with me so in
[30:54] verse 19 he says as many as I love
[30:58] I rebuke and chasen so this is God's
[31:02] love man the word is good for reproof
[31:05] for rebuke for instruction and
[31:08] righteousness amen as many as I love I
[31:11] rebuke and
[31:13] chasen be zealous therefore and repent
[31:17] amen the prophet of God tells us in the
[31:19] church age book when he's talking about
[31:21] the latery in church age which we know
[31:22] is the end age this the age that we find
[31:24] ourselves in it goes to this scripture
[31:27] and he says be zealous and repent he
[31:29] says now this false church has Zeal make
[31:31] no mistake about that her Zeal has
[31:34] literally been that of the Jews in John
[31:36] 2:17 the Zeal of thine house has eaten
[31:39] me up but it is a wrong Zeal he's
[31:41] talking about the church nominal the
[31:43] church world the denominational systems
[31:45] amen they got a Zeal but the Zeal is
[31:47] wrong the Apostle Paul had a Zeal but
[31:49] his Zeal was wrong amen his Zeal was for
[31:52] the Jews religion he thought it was a
[31:54] Zeal for God and he found out it was a
[31:55] Zeal for religion right it was a Zeal
[31:58] for his church for his system of
[32:00] theology amen but he had a Zeal but it
[32:03] was a misguided Zeal and today the the
[32:06] the many churches have a Zeal but it's a
[32:08] misguided Zeal because it's a Zeal for
[32:10] the denomination it's a Zeal for their
[32:11] own ideas but it's the wrong Zeal it's
[32:15] for the house of their own building it's
[32:17] for their own Creeds dogmas
[32:18] organizations their own righteousness
[32:20] they have put the word out for their own
[32:23] ideas they deposed the Holy Ghost and
[32:26] made men into lead ERS they they have
[32:29] put aside eternal life as a person and
[32:31] made it good works or even Church
[32:33] Conformity rather than good works but
[32:37] God is calling for another Zeal it is is
[32:40] the Zeal to cry I am wrong now who is
[32:44] going to say that he is wrong amen I am
[32:47] wrong amen there's still so many things
[32:50] about me that's wrong amen and the more
[32:52] that I walk in this walk I I I used to
[32:55] think that I was a good person and I
[32:57] used to think that everything was okay I
[32:59] was raised as a church boy I was raised
[33:01] in a in in a and I would would what I
[33:04] considered a very good church amen an
[33:06] independent Bible believing King James
[33:09] Bible believing fairly modest church I I
[33:12] I thought we had it all wrapped up amen
[33:14] I thought I was good but I found out
[33:16] amen through a few trials in life and
[33:18] through failures that I was no good
[33:20] whatsoever there was no good thing in me
[33:22] at all amen and I had to come with the
[33:24] Zeal to repent and say I am wrong oh my
[33:27] ideas are wrong everything that I
[33:28] thought was right is
[33:32] wrong and that's the Zeal of the age the
[33:35] Zeal to
[33:36] repent the Zeal to say I'm wrong we're
[33:40] going to find that this is this is an
[33:42] important Zeal to have and it's an
[33:44] important Zeal never to
[33:46] lose because the minute we start losing
[33:49] the Zeal to repent to have our mind
[33:52] changed and our understanding
[33:54] changed and to submit to the the word of
[33:57] God we're going to find ourselves taking
[33:59] the same path of every
[34:04] denomination
[34:07] because we need constant
[34:11] correcting to manifest what we're
[34:13] supposed to manifest in this
[34:15] age do you think of the level that God
[34:18] has called this generation to not like
[34:21] any level previous not like any age that
[34:24] was stuck in darkness that had partial
[34:26] revelation as the Revelation was being
[34:28] restored coming out of the Dark Ages
[34:30] from the Ning Council amen the that the
[34:33] romanist system took the church into
[34:35] utter Darkness amen but coming out of
[34:37] that God would awaken men amen and they
[34:40] would bring a reformation and bring a
[34:42] Revival and bring it all the way up
[34:43] through to the modern day what's he
[34:45] doing he's growing a body he's growing a
[34:48] church amen so that he can dwell in it
[34:50] in fullness and at the end time there's
[34:52] going to be a people standing on this
[34:54] earth that is to be the very reflection
[34:56] ction of Jesus Christ that they are
[34:58] supposed to be vessels filled with the
[35:01] spirit of God manifesting his life not
[35:04] their life his life and you talk about a
[35:06] tall order friends we're not going to do
[35:09] that unless he has absolute preeminence
[35:11] preeminence means absolute control and
[35:13] in order to do that there's many things
[35:15] in our life that are going to have to be
[35:17] corrected and cut away and changed we're
[35:19] going to have to change our mind on all
[35:21] kinds of things and we shouldn't sit
[35:23] here today with our mind made up
[35:25] thinking we already got it fig figed out
[35:27] we do not have it figured out but by the
[35:30] grace of God he has sent a word in this
[35:32] day that'll bring us all the way to the
[35:34] Finish Line we have it's been handed to
[35:37] us we have received it through a
[35:39] prophetic Ministry we have the full
[35:41] revelation of the word amen with Divine
[35:44] Vindication it's in our hands but we
[35:46] must constantly surrender to that word
[35:49] and constantly lay aside our thinking
[35:51] amen that's why we come to church we've
[35:54] been born again we've been regenerated
[35:56] by the spirit of of God why are we
[35:57] coming back every Wednesday and every
[35:59] Sunday we're not just here to make a
[36:01] atmosphere for somebody else to get
[36:03] saved that's part of why we're here
[36:05] we're not just here to show what side
[36:06] we're on that's part of why we're here
[36:08] we're here also to worship collectively
[36:10] God and sing his praises and glorify his
[36:12] name but a big part of why we come is so
[36:15] that we can have something else cut out
[36:17] of our life every Sunday every Wednesday
[36:20] so that we can move into this High
[36:22] Calling of Christ
[36:25] Jesus amen amen if we don't come with
[36:28] that intent so many times we walk away
[36:33] disappointed because we don't realize
[36:36] that the preaching is to reprove to
[36:39] rebuke to chasen also to instruct and to
[36:44] encourage it's supposed to do it
[36:48] all everybody likes the encouraging
[36:52] sermon it's so hard to like the
[36:54] corrective
[36:55] sermon that's just human nature I don't
[36:59] know that we'll ever get away from that
[37:01] until we come to a level of maturity
[37:03] where we can say thank God I see I was
[37:10] wrong anden let's go to Hebrews chapter
[37:20] 12 Hebrews chapter
[37:25] 12
[37:27] let's look at verse
[37:32] four in Hebrews 12 ver4 he says you have
[37:35] not resisted unto blood striving against
[37:38] sin and you have forgotten the
[37:40] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[37:41] unto children my son despise thou
[37:44] despise not thou the chastening of the
[37:46] Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[37:48] him for whom the Lord loveth he
[37:50] chasteneth and scores every son whom he
[37:53] receiveth if you endure chastening God
[37:56] god dealth with you as with sons for
[37:58] what son is he whom the father
[38:00] chasteneth not but if you be without
[38:03] chastisement whereof all our partakers
[38:05] then are you bastards and not Sons
[38:07] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[38:09] flesh which corrected us corrected us
[38:12] and we gave them reverence shall we not
[38:15] much rather be in subjection unto the
[38:17] father of spirits and live for they
[38:19] verily for a few days chastened us after
[38:21] their own pleasure but he for our
[38:24] Prophet oh that's a key
[38:27] phrase we had fathers who chastened us
[38:30] and fathers who corrected us and we gave
[38:31] them glory amen we look back now as as
[38:34] grown men and women we can say I'm so
[38:36] thankful I had a father who wouldn't let
[38:38] me get away with things I'm so thankful
[38:39] I had a mother amen who would make sure
[38:42] I was lined up so I didn't have all my
[38:44] own desires and all my own wants I'm
[38:46] thankful for that amen but he's saying
[38:48] amen the Father the the the father God
[38:51] he's doing it for our own profit not
[38:53] even just for his own pleasure but for
[38:54] our own profit amen but he for our
[38:57] profit that we might be partakers of his
[39:00] Holiness amen he's correcting us so that
[39:04] we can be like
[39:06] him now no chastening for the present
[39:09] seeth to be joyous but Grievious
[39:12] nevertheless afterward it yielded the
[39:14] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[39:16] them which are exercised
[39:19] thereby after reading that we should
[39:22] come to church with a different attitude
[39:25] amen
[39:27] we should come to church amen to do all
[39:30] the things we talked about we should
[39:31] come to church to throw our shoulder to
[39:33] the wheel and support the work of God we
[39:35] should come to church to to lift our
[39:38] voices with the voice of many and
[39:40] singing praises and glorifying the name
[39:41] of our God we should come to church as a
[39:44] demonstration of our faith of what we
[39:46] believe that we believe it's important
[39:47] to worship God it's important to gather
[39:50] ourselves together we should come for
[39:51] all of those reasons but we should also
[39:53] come amen seeing oursel as a little
[39:56] sheep coming before the shepherd and
[39:57] saying Lord amen if I'm spping to the
[40:00] right or to the left side of the road
[40:02] would you chasen me quickly and bring me
[40:03] back to the very center of your
[40:08] will amen because no
[40:12] chastisement let's read this again no
[40:15] chastening for the present seeth to be
[40:18] joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[40:21] afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit
[40:23] of righteousness unto them which are
[40:25] exced exz thereby and why does God
[40:28] chasen us is verse 10 for they verily
[40:31] for a few days chasen us after their own
[40:33] pleasure but he for our profit that we
[40:35] might be partakers of his Holiness amen
[40:39] he wants to keep us in line with himself
[40:43] which is his
[40:46] word let's go to Psalms I'm going to
[40:48] read something out of the Psalms David
[40:50] was so familiar with this
[40:53] principle he's the one who wrote the
[40:55] 23rd psalm he wrote so many things that
[40:58] are such a help to us in Psalms
[41:11] 118:18 in Psalms 118: 18 he says the
[41:16] Lord hath chasen me
[41:18] sore that means he's really spank me
[41:22] good the Lord has chasen me sore but he
[41:26] has not given me over unto
[41:29] death what he saying David knows what it
[41:32] was like to be under the Judgment of God
[41:36] he knows what it was like to be
[41:37] chastened to be scored to be corrected
[41:40] under the heavy hand of almighty God and
[41:44] David was a man after God's Own Heart
[41:46] David was a man who God greatly beloved
[41:49] but David also knew what it was like to
[41:50] fall under the heavy hand of a mighty
[41:54] God he knew what it was like to be
[41:56] lifted up and to be blessed he knew what
[41:57] it was like to be abased and to be
[41:59] brought back down to earth he
[42:01] experienced both by the hand of God
[42:04] because that's how God deals with his
[42:06] children that's how God deals with his
[42:09] beloved but he wouldn't deliver him
[42:12] under death amen that's the reason he
[42:15] was chastening him so that he wouldn't
[42:19] die let's go to Proverbs
[42:25] 20 Proverbs
[42:30] 20
[42:32] verse
[42:34] 30 Proverbs
[42:39] 20:30 the bless of a wound cleanseth way
[42:42] evil so do stripes the inward parts of
[42:45] the
[42:47] belly the bless of a womb cleanseth way
[42:50] evil so do stripes the inward parts of
[42:52] the belly the Bible says foolishness is
[42:55] bound in the heart heart of the child
[42:56] but the rod of Correction shall drive it
[42:58] far from
[42:59] him and that's how God instructs fathers
[43:02] and mothers to raise their children and
[43:05] when they're out of line correct them
[43:07] and correct them with chastisement with
[43:09] scoring with something that's uh no
[43:12] chastisement for the present seem
[43:15] Pleasant that's that's maybe a nice way
[43:17] of saying
[43:19] that but yet it's instruction because in
[43:21] the heart of that child is bound
[43:23] foolishness but the rod of Correction
[43:24] will drive it far away but I don't think
[43:26] it's just in the heart of our children
[43:28] but I think it's in the heart of God's
[43:29] children sometimes foolishness is bound
[43:32] in our own minds our psyches are are the
[43:35] the emotional human realm of us amen
[43:37] there's still foolishness that abides
[43:39] there there's still selfishness there's
[43:41] still Pride there's still all kinds of
[43:43] things that are laying there amen and
[43:45] the grace of God will come our way many
[43:47] many times and it'll bring circumstances
[43:49] in our life that'll cause us to to judge
[43:52] ourselves cause us to look around and
[43:54] see God where am I wrong amen and when
[43:56] God reveals it to us then he's asking us
[43:58] to be zealous and say I am
[44:02] wrong forgive me
[44:04] Lord what's he trying to do he's trying
[44:07] to keep us fit for his service he's
[44:10] trying to keep us in line for his great
[44:13] purpose in our lives and that's to
[44:15] manifest himself in this
[44:17] generation and nothing will defeat that
[44:20] purpose let's go to 1 Corinthians
[44:22] chapter
[44:25] 11
[44:31] in 1
[44:34] Corinthians 11 you'll recognize this as
[44:38] part of the scriptures that we read for
[44:40] communion service when we come here the
[44:42] first of every month for
[44:44] communion and I'm just going to pick it
[44:46] up down in verse 27 and begin reading
[44:48] from 27 to verse
[44:50] 32 and he says wherefore whosoever shall
[44:54] eat this bread and drink drink this cup
[44:56] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[44:58] of the body and blood of the
[45:01] Lord but let a man examine himself and
[45:04] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[45:07] of that cup for he that eateth and
[45:09] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[45:11] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[45:14] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[45:16] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[45:19] if we would judge ourselves we should
[45:21] not be judged but when we are judged we
[45:24] are chastened of the Lord that we should
[45:26] not be condemned with the
[45:29] world here we come to like I said we we
[45:32] read this traditionally for communion
[45:35] and it's a it's a wonderful principle
[45:37] it's an absolute truth that God has and
[45:41] he's he begin to tell us that when we
[45:43] come to communion that we're not to come
[45:45] and take of it unworthily this isn't a
[45:47] light trivial thing it's a very heavy
[45:49] very serious thing that has impact in
[45:51] our lives but but he's saying we're not
[45:54] to take the Lord's suffer supper
[45:56] communion
[45:57] unworthily but we are to examine
[46:01] ourselves I tell you the most difficult
[46:04] judgment to me the most difficult
[46:06] judgment in the world is to judge
[46:09] myself and sometimes the the the
[46:12] greatest deception and I think sometimes
[46:14] some of the most diabolical deception is
[46:17] self-deception and we know
[46:19] self-deception is what Lucifer had
[46:22] because he was deceived by his own
[46:24] brightness he was lift up by his own
[46:26] wisdom his own Perfection his own Beauty
[46:29] he he he had self-deception by his own
[46:32] brightness amen and sometimes we can
[46:34] deceive ourselves by our own
[46:38] Glory we think that we we have things
[46:41] figured out we think that we know right
[46:43] from wrong we think that I mean think
[46:45] listen friends we can think we know the
[46:47] Bible and we know the message and we
[46:48] know all of this and and that's the
[46:51] wrong attitude the right attitude should
[46:53] be I'm just a child and I know nothing
[46:55] and I want to no
[46:59] more and so now we're told to examine
[47:02] ourselves which I think is difficult yes
[47:05] and if we're instructed to do it then
[47:07] it's possible but it's going to take
[47:09] some genuine honesty to examine
[47:11] ourselves it's going to take there's
[47:14] there's a reality to this that is not
[47:16] lighthearted and trivial there's a
[47:19] reality because self- discernment is
[47:21] really difficult it's not something that
[47:23] we should do maybe in two or three
[47:25] minutes time maybe a a quick maybe we
[47:28] should really take some time when we
[47:30] come to communion not just to communion
[47:32] we should take some time once in a while
[47:34] and just quietly meditate on where we
[47:36] are with
[47:37] God where we are and what we're doing
[47:40] and and what's pleasing to the Lord and
[47:42] what's not pleasing to the Lord but when
[47:44] we come to communion now
[47:47] self-examination takes on some serious
[47:51] consequences or a lack of
[47:54] self-examination for it says I want to
[47:55] read again for whosoever shall eat this
[47:57] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[47:58] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[48:01] and blood of the
[48:03] Lord that's not a light phrase we
[48:06] shouldn't take it lightly that's very
[48:09] very serious says so but let a man
[48:12] examine himself and so let him eat of
[48:14] that bread and drink of that cup we are
[48:17] going to need the Lord's
[48:22] help for he that eateth and drinketh
[48:24] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[48:26] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[48:28] body I believe with all my heart if we
[48:30] come to God with an Hest heart saying
[48:32] God show me where I felt I believe he
[48:35] will because it's according to his word
[48:38] amen and sometimes we need God Amen we
[48:40] need an unction of the Holy Ghost we
[48:42] need something to drop in to show us
[48:44] where we're wrong because many times if
[48:46] we knew we were wrong we wouldn't keep
[48:48] doing wrong sometimes we're doing wrong
[48:50] not knowing we're doing wrong I mean you
[48:53] serve God for a while and there's things
[48:55] that you do not do today that you
[48:57] thought were okay 10 years ago is there
[49:00] anybody in the room like that and then
[49:02] when you when God deals with your heart
[49:03] and you get a greater Revelation and you
[49:05] recognize that that thing's not pleasing
[49:07] to God that was self- serving that was
[49:09] self that was done out of Pride that was
[49:11] something that not pleasing to the Lord
[49:13] then all of a sudden you're ashamed of
[49:15] yourself for being blind all these years
[49:17] amen I hope I'm not the only one in that
[49:20] position amen but by the grace of God
[49:22] Amen when we ask God God Amen when you
[49:24] go to exam yourself and God shine your
[49:27] light on any place that's not pleasing
[49:28] to you I believe God will do it amen and
[49:31] so many times there's things in our
[49:33] lives that we didn't awaken to because
[49:35] maybe by the grace of God he knew that
[49:37] we weren't ready yet or we couldn't
[49:39] handle it but when the time was right
[49:40] God opened our eyes amen and that's when
[49:43] it's time to be zealous and
[49:45] repent say God forgive me I didn't
[49:48] understand but now I see I didn't get it
[49:50] but now I do
[49:52] amen he goes on and he says
[49:57] for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy
[49:59] eateth and drinketh Damnation to
[50:02] himself not Discerning the Lord's
[50:05] body if we knowingly have things in our
[50:08] heart that aren't right and things in
[50:10] our life that aren't right and we just
[50:12] move on and assume that it's going to be
[50:14] okay and we come to this great Lord's
[50:16] Supper to this communion table and
[50:18] knowing that we're wrong in our heart
[50:20] knowing that that we have some
[50:22] condemnation laying somewhere cuz we've
[50:24] done wrong we've said wrong we've
[50:25] harbored bitterness we've done something
[50:27] wrong we've got something hidden that we
[50:29] haven't made right amen when we come to
[50:31] that he says you bring damnation upon
[50:35] yourself not Discerning the Lord's body
[50:37] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[50:39] among you and many
[50:41] sleep for if we would judge
[50:45] ourselves I want to look at this word
[50:47] judge it's interesting in the Greek
[50:50] there's just a couple definitions that
[50:52] it's given uh it's used it it's used in
[50:55] the the Bible the the English words that
[50:57] are used to translate this are
[50:59] doubt judge discern contend or
[51:06] waver what does it
[51:08] mean
[51:10] this the one of the definitions is to
[51:12] learn by discrimination to try to decide
[51:16] to determine give judgment decide a
[51:19] dispute but it also means to be at
[51:21] variance with oneself to hesitate to
[51:26] doubt this is the act of judgment not
[51:30] passing judgment once you pass judgment
[51:32] it's past tense I found myself this but
[51:34] this is the act of judgment and the act
[51:37] of judgment is to doubt your own
[51:40] self to be at variance with
[51:44] yourself to not trust
[51:48] yourself when it says judge yourself
[51:51] you're not supposed to be like you know
[51:52] well my opinion is this and their
[51:54] opinion is that and I'm this and I no
[51:57] the the judgment is not to judge
[51:58] yourself uh that way the judgment is to
[52:01] get actually down and doubt yourself
[52:03] actually question
[52:04] yourself to be at variance with your own
[52:07] self you say okay you're doing that and
[52:09] you feel like it's okay why do you feel
[52:10] like it's okay why Chad do you think
[52:13] this is okay and why do you want to do
[52:15] that and why do you keep why do you keep
[52:18] justifying this action if it's not a
[52:21] problem for you why is it always coming
[52:23] up in your mind right I'm not talking
[52:25] about judging somebody else I'm talking
[52:26] about judging
[52:28] ourselves being at variance with our own
[52:30] selves and being at doubting our own
[52:32] selves and saying amen because we
[52:35] understand that that our thoughts speak
[52:37] louder than our words in heaven and that
[52:40] God's judging us off our motive and our
[52:42] objective outside everything can look
[52:44] right amen it could actually be
[52:46] technically okay the action that we're
[52:48] taking technically you can't find maybe
[52:51] a Bible verse against it maybe you can't
[52:53] find where the Prophet spoke against it
[52:54] and there's a technicality you would
[52:56] pass but in your heart your motive is
[52:59] completely wrong your desire is
[53:01] completely wrong this isn't this is a
[53:04] selfish desire this is self-serving this
[53:06] is based on Pride this is to serve the
[53:08] lust of the Flesh and you may
[53:10] technically be okay but in the eyes of
[53:12] God you're still
[53:15] wrong God's not judging on
[53:17] technicalities and boundaries he's
[53:19] judging the heart amen why are we doing
[53:22] what we're doing why are we saying what
[53:24] we're saying why are we taking the
[53:26] actions that we're taking right that's
[53:29] why this is hard
[53:31] work this level this judge yourself is
[53:34] hard
[53:36] work to say
[53:38] why why am I doing that why am I
[53:41] struggling with this why am I having a
[53:44] hard time with this in my life and why
[53:46] can I not seem to get Beyond this
[53:51] barrier sometimes we just need to doubt
[53:54] ourselves amen this is actually what
[53:57] judgment
[53:58] is Judgment when you come to judge a
[54:01] matter you don't come to be
[54:04] gullible and believe everything is that
[54:07] right when you come to judgment that
[54:10] that's why when you come to judgment you
[54:11] don't come to judgment and you ask you
[54:13] know so why did you do that and what did
[54:15] you do I didn't do nothing wrong sir I
[54:18] did this and you're like okay he said he
[54:20] didn't do
[54:21] it that's not
[54:23] judgment that's not judgment judgment is
[54:26] to doubt him and to be at variance with
[54:30] him and push him a little bit to find
[54:33] out what really happened that's judgment
[54:35] amen and sometimes we need to push back
[54:37] against oursel and go deeper than the
[54:39] logic in our brain and go down into the
[54:42] heart and say why am I doing what I'm
[54:44] doing what's down inside why am I
[54:47] resisting the word of God why am I
[54:49] having a hard time forgiving a brother
[54:51] or sister what is wrong down inside and
[54:54] push Beyond this and get down here and
[54:57] do some real discernment and judgment
[55:00] amen we all know the word most of us
[55:03] know the word we know the message we
[55:05] know quotes we know scriptures and we
[55:07] know exactly how to intellectually
[55:10] justify everything that we in our hearts
[55:12] still want to hold on
[55:15] to but now we need to judge
[55:18] ourselves and say why Lord help me God
[55:22] to see what's going on inside my my
[55:25] heart
[55:26] amen
[55:28] but praise be to
[55:30] God verse
[55:33] 30 two verse 31 if we would judge
[55:37] ourselves we should not be
[55:40] judged but when we are
[55:43] judged what the scripture saying if you
[55:47] fail to judge yourself your father is
[55:50] going to judge
[55:51] you this is his love to us but when we
[55:55] are judged we are chasen to the Lord
[55:59] that we should not be condemned with the
[56:02] world why does he judge us to destroy us
[56:06] no does he judge us to annihilate us to
[56:08] do it no he brings judgment on our life
[56:11] so that we will not be lost with the
[56:13] world he brings judgment and chastening
[56:16] which is like spanking a child or
[56:18] scoring correction he brings judgment
[56:20] and correction so that his purpose in
[56:23] our life will not be defeated so that we
[56:26] will not be lost with the world oh I
[56:28] thank God he's corrected me I thank God
[56:31] he's judged me I thank God he's weighed
[56:33] me in the balance and found me wanting
[56:35] many many many times friend it wasn't
[56:37] just once when I gave my heart to the
[56:39] Lord and I was born again there's been
[56:41] judgment upon judgment upon judgment why
[56:44] because I'm still dealing with this
[56:46] sticky Cocker nature on the outside
[56:48] that's constantly trying to trip me up
[56:50] and so many voices trying to get me to
[56:53] stay in that Realm
[56:55] amen but oh by the grace of God he has
[56:58] judged me and he has chasen me and he's
[57:02] given me a heart to say forgive me Lord
[57:05] I want it always to be that way amen
[57:09] now this word in verse 31 if you would
[57:13] judge that's the act of judging that's
[57:16] doubting that's questioning that's being
[57:17] at variance that that's holding it in
[57:19] doubt if you would do that to yourself
[57:22] you'll not be judged but when you are
[57:24] judged these two words judged amen
[57:27] they're past tense if you don't do the
[57:30] act of searching your heart doubting
[57:33] yourself questioning yourself being in
[57:35] doubt of yourself if you don't do that
[57:37] God already knows what's in your heart
[57:40] amen and if you not if if if you're not
[57:43] you will be judged if you don't judge
[57:44] you will be judged and that's when he
[57:46] declares you're wrong yeah he doesn't
[57:49] have to search it out he already knows
[57:51] and he declares you're wrong you're
[57:53] wrong and I'm going to correct IR you
[57:55] amen because I am not going to lose you
[57:57] with the world I didn't predestinate you
[57:59] to lose you I didn't call you to be a
[58:01] manifestation of myself just to let you
[58:03] constantly wander around in your own
[58:06] self
[58:09] deceit thank God we have a father thank
[58:13] God we have a Shepherd thank God he sent
[58:15] a word in this day to keep us in the
[58:17] right
[58:20] lane the prophet of God says that
[58:22] doesn't need any explanation it's just
[58:25] this if we eat and drink unworthily we
[58:27] eat and drink damnation to our own
[58:28] selves not Discerning the Lord's body
[58:31] for this cause many are weakly and sick
[58:33] among you and many are dead when we come
[58:35] to take communion every Christian should
[58:37] take
[58:38] communion it's your duty it's a showdown
[58:42] see Jesus said if you don't take it you
[58:45] have no part with
[58:46] me but he that eateth and drinketh
[58:49] unworthily eats and drinks damnation to
[58:52] himself that is if you're still out with
[58:54] the world and doing things with the
[58:55] world and people see you taking
[58:57] communion you're doing wrong you're only
[58:59] bringing disgrace to you and it'll harm
[59:01] you it isn't it isn't that it'll harm
[59:03] God it'll harm you and so a person
[59:05] should examine the themselves and before
[59:08] we approach this sacred moment you ask
[59:10] God to search my life and if I've done
[59:12] anything that's not right forgive me I
[59:13] don't mean to do it I'll make it right
[59:15] if he'll reveal it to me I'll ask the
[59:17] same thing for you is how we should come
[59:20] to communion for each
[59:21] other God help my brother help my sister
[59:25] amen help the pastor help everybody help
[59:27] the song leader help everybody Lord help
[59:30] us to be right in your eyes
[59:32] Lord we should come searching Our
[59:35] Lives again he makes another statement
[59:37] about communion he says now I thought
[59:39] maybe tonight is communion night and I
[59:41] hear they've had a baptism and going to
[59:43] have another one I like to come down for
[59:45] communion I missed it last time not
[59:47] being here I missed it I knew that this
[59:49] was the first Sunday so I made
[59:51] preparations to be here so I could be in
[59:53] communion for tonight for I truly think
[59:55] that it's the duty of every Christian to
[59:58] take
[59:59] communion you're going to find out why
[1:00:01] he says that in a moment the Bible said
[1:00:03] if you take this not you have no part
[1:00:05] with me and I believe it is The Showdown
[1:00:07] time for Christians if we do not take it
[1:00:10] we have no part with him if we take it
[1:00:13] unworthily then we're guilty of the body
[1:00:15] and death of Christ so it gets to a
[1:00:18] place where it keeps the Christian
[1:00:20] prayed up so when he comes to communion
[1:00:22] we should come reverently uh solemnly
[1:00:25] sacredly walking up confessing all of
[1:00:27] our wrongs praying one for another not
[1:00:29] only that but we should feel if there's
[1:00:31] a brother or sister Among Us that we
[1:00:33] feel is just a little bit out of line
[1:00:35] somewhere our hearts ought to be
[1:00:36] burdened for that person on communion
[1:00:39] night especially to see them that
[1:00:41] they'll be able to walk up and take
[1:00:42] communion and not be condemned with the
[1:00:44] world because they are our brothers and
[1:00:48] sisters amen you see how serious it is
[1:00:51] Jesus gave the commandment and he says
[1:00:54] this this do in remembrance of me as
[1:00:56] often as you do this you show the Lord's
[1:00:58] death you show my death the Paul said
[1:01:01] the Lord's death till he come so we find
[1:01:03] that communion is one of the three
[1:01:05] sacraments left to the church there's
[1:01:07] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:01:08] Jesus Christ there's communion and
[1:01:10] there's feet washing these things are
[1:01:12] not optional they're
[1:01:14] Commandments they're not optional amen
[1:01:17] and he says every Christian should come
[1:01:19] to communion why should every Christian
[1:01:21] come to communion because communion is a
[1:01:23] showdown time with yourself amen you
[1:01:26] can't walk up there and take it
[1:01:28] unworthily or you bring damnation upon
[1:01:30] yourself not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:01:33] amen so you have to know that you have
[1:01:36] everything in your heart cleaned out
[1:01:37] before God repented and confess and come
[1:01:40] to take
[1:01:42] communion but if you take it not you're
[1:01:45] at variance with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:47] himself and you've separated yourself
[1:01:49] from his word from his
[1:01:50] commandment and brother bam said that
[1:01:53] that that he even refer heard that if
[1:01:54] you have no part with me and we know
[1:01:56] Jesus said that during the foot washing
[1:01:58] ceremony foot washing when he talked to
[1:02:01] Peter he says if I wash you not you have
[1:02:02] no part with me and brother brandham
[1:02:04] coupled the feet washing and communion
[1:02:07] together and he said if you don't take
[1:02:08] communion you have no part with
[1:02:12] me so when we come to communion it's a
[1:02:14] showdown
[1:02:16] friends if we don't take it we're off
[1:02:19] the word that's right we've denied the
[1:02:22] very word of Jesus Christ and the
[1:02:23] Commandment that was left to the church
[1:02:26] if we take it unworthily we brought
[1:02:27] damnation upon
[1:02:29] ourselves oh I love
[1:02:33] communion I love that God has given us
[1:02:37] something to where we have to come and
[1:02:39] face ourselves
[1:02:42] periodically amen there has to come a
[1:02:46] time where we come face to face with
[1:02:48] where we are there has to come a time
[1:02:51] where we search ourselves we should
[1:02:53] always be doing it but but listen
[1:02:54] friends life is busy and life moves fast
[1:02:57] and we get caught up in things and
[1:02:58] sometimes we don't take the time we
[1:03:00] ought to take but when it comes around
[1:03:01] to communion service time to the Lord's
[1:03:03] Supper it's a great time to stop hit the
[1:03:06] pause button say God am I pleasing you
[1:03:09] in every area of my life I don't want to
[1:03:11] come down there and take communion with
[1:03:13] something in between me and you
[1:03:15] something that's not
[1:03:18] right amen when it comes when it comes
[1:03:22] to these times amen we need these
[1:03:25] times and they don't just come at
[1:03:27] Communion they come so many times in our
[1:03:30] lives where something goes sideways
[1:03:31] something goes upside down and we feel
[1:03:33] the chastening hand of the Lord and we
[1:03:35] have to ask ourselves some hard
[1:03:38] questions say thank God for
[1:03:41] that thank God Amen that sometimes when
[1:03:46] we don't judge
[1:03:48] ourselves I'm so glad that he'll judge
[1:03:51] me so that I won't be lost with the
[1:03:53] world
[1:03:57] amen communion was commanded by Christ
[1:04:02] confirmed by Paul reconfirmed by brother
[1:04:06] brandom because we need
[1:04:10] it because we need it we need more
[1:04:15] opportunities to judge
[1:04:18] ourselves we need more time where we
[1:04:21] have to face the reality in our lives
[1:04:24] not
[1:04:26] flippantly not it's not just a
[1:04:28] traditional another ceremony but it's a
[1:04:30] time to stop and say God am I right am I
[1:04:34] doing right am I pleasing you are the
[1:04:38] decisions I've made recently are they in
[1:04:40] line with your word is this what you
[1:04:42] want from me God open my heart and show
[1:04:44] me my motive behind what I'm
[1:04:47] doing and then we can come to the
[1:04:49] communion table boldly knowing that
[1:04:52] there's nothing to hinder me and that I
[1:04:54] can I can come boldly and rejoice in
[1:04:57] what Christ did for me to purge me from
[1:04:59] my sins to wash me from unrighteousness
[1:05:02] to purchase me back to God so that I can
[1:05:05] be
[1:05:06] free I thank God for
[1:05:09] that amen
[1:05:11] so God has given
[1:05:13] us these measures by which we have
[1:05:17] opportunity to judge
[1:05:18] ourself let's turn to First Peter
[1:05:20] chapter
[1:05:23] 4
[1:05:37] 1 Peter chapter 4:1
[1:05:39] 17 before I move on I want to say one
[1:05:42] more thing whenever I I preach about
[1:05:44] things like this and bring up communion
[1:05:47] amen it's never in a way for me to
[1:05:49] persuade somebody to come communion
[1:05:50] because if you're not worthy I don't
[1:05:52] want you to come
[1:05:54] I do not want to push persuade or coers
[1:05:59] somebody to damn
[1:06:01] themselves and bring sickness or death
[1:06:04] so you don't have to come to communion
[1:06:06] to prove to me you're a Believer you
[1:06:07] don't have to come to make me feel good
[1:06:09] I'm not trying to get more people to
[1:06:10] show up it's not the not the purpose be
[1:06:14] behind this preaching whatsoever it's
[1:06:16] because it's a commandment of God and
[1:06:18] it's necessary in our
[1:06:20] lives it's something that has been
[1:06:22] confirmed in our generation to be
[1:06:24] necessary for us but it is certainly not
[1:06:27] a way to C anybody else to come because
[1:06:30] if you don't want to come please don't
[1:06:33] come if you don't feel free to come
[1:06:35] don't come if you don't have the Liberty
[1:06:38] in your heart don't do it and if you
[1:06:40] don't have a desire for it please don't
[1:06:42] come because if you don't have a desire
[1:06:44] then you're not taking it
[1:06:46] seriously then you have a
[1:06:48] misunderstanding about it and if you
[1:06:50] don't have a desire in your heart don't
[1:06:53] come but I preach these things so that
[1:06:55] we can come correctly according to the
[1:06:58] word and we can get the full benefit out
[1:07:00] of what God has laid down for us there's
[1:07:03] not a lot of things he's commanded us to
[1:07:05] do it's not like the Jews with the law
[1:07:07] amen that law was just to proed to them
[1:07:09] that they couldn't do it amen but God
[1:07:11] has given us something these these three
[1:07:14] sacraments for us to keep because we
[1:07:16] need it
[1:07:19] amen so please don't feel pushed or
[1:07:22] coerced just do what's in your heart but
[1:07:25] I pray if you find yourself on another
[1:07:27] side of the
[1:07:28] word pray and ask God
[1:07:31] why why why don't I want to come why
[1:07:35] aren't I there every time and I don't
[1:07:37] mean when you're away on vacation or
[1:07:39] when you have something going on that's
[1:07:41] understandable mean that's why we do
[1:07:42] communion once a month because there's
[1:07:44] always somebody that's going to miss
[1:07:45] sometime that's why we don't do it once
[1:07:47] a year every six months because if
[1:07:49] you're on family vacation or if you got
[1:07:51] something going you won't get communion
[1:07:52] for a whole year
[1:07:54] you won't have an opportunity for 6
[1:07:56] months or a year to come to a service
[1:07:58] where you have to judge yourself
[1:08:01] right amen some people complain about
[1:08:04] the frequency it's too frequent amen but
[1:08:07] praise God how can it be too frequent
[1:08:10] that we judge ourselves how can it be
[1:08:12] too frequent amen there's nothing said
[1:08:14] in the scripture there's no commandment
[1:08:16] we don't have to have it any certain
[1:08:17] amount of time we could do once a month
[1:08:19] we could do every other month we could
[1:08:20] do once a quarter we could do once a
[1:08:22] year we could do it as we feel do it all
[1:08:24] of those things would be fine and all of
[1:08:26] those things would be right according to
[1:08:27] the scripture amen but but but as the
[1:08:30] shepherd of this church if I see fit
[1:08:32] that we need to have communion once a
[1:08:34] month why would you resist that why
[1:08:37] would you resist that opportunity to
[1:08:40] keep that word and to come together and
[1:08:42] fulfill the word of
[1:08:44] God that needs some self- judgment that
[1:08:47] needs some time to say why Lord why am I
[1:08:52] resisting we come to First 1 Peter
[1:08:54] chapter
[1:08:58] 4 verse
[1:09:01] 17 1 Peter 4:1
[1:09:07] 17 for the time has come that judgment
[1:09:10] must begin at the house of God and if it
[1:09:13] first begin at us what shall the end be
[1:09:16] of them that obey not the gospel of God
[1:09:20] and if the righteous scarcely be saved
[1:09:22] where shall the ungodly
[1:09:24] and the centner
[1:09:26] appear my goodness what a scripture
[1:09:29] that's a heavy one for the time is come
[1:09:31] that judgment was begin at the house of
[1:09:33] God and don't just think this is the
[1:09:35] house of God this is a house of God this
[1:09:37] is a building that we we have set aside
[1:09:40] and we have given it over to the Lord
[1:09:42] and dedicated it to the worship of the
[1:09:43] Lord that's what this this house is for
[1:09:46] but the real house of God is the Living
[1:09:48] Church amen it's the body it's the
[1:09:50] habitation of God by the spirit it's the
[1:09:52] dwelling place of alight Mighty God it's
[1:09:54] the Temple of the Holy Ghost that is the
[1:09:56] body amen and judgment comes to the
[1:09:59] house of God means judgment's coming to
[1:10:01] this house of
[1:10:03] God the time has come that judgment must
[1:10:05] begin at the house of God and look what
[1:10:08] he says if it first begin at us where
[1:10:10] does it first begin at the house of God
[1:10:13] at
[1:10:14] us what shall the end be of them that
[1:10:17] obey not the gospel of God and if the
[1:10:19] righteous scarcely be saved where shall
[1:10:21] the ungodly and The Sinner appear
[1:10:24] that's why sometimes I think we take
[1:10:25] these things a little bit too lightly he
[1:10:27] said if the righteous scarcely be saved
[1:10:29] amen we make it we make it sound like
[1:10:31] everything's just so easy but it's not
[1:10:33] so easy it takes some judgment some
[1:10:35] travail some sacrifice some real judging
[1:10:38] of self amen and it takes the hand of
[1:10:40] God Amen to constantly bring correction
[1:10:42] in our lives to bring us to where we
[1:10:44] need to be and where will Judgment begin
[1:10:48] at the house of
[1:10:50] God
[1:10:51] Amen the prophet of God says in the
[1:10:54] message speak to the Rock and it shall
[1:10:55] give forth as water says that's why I
[1:10:58] don't see why so many complain that I
[1:11:00] speak too hard and try to make people
[1:11:02] straighten up and tell them the way
[1:11:03] they're living the way they're dressing
[1:11:05] and tell me I'm hurting my Ministry when
[1:11:07] the Judgment seat is the house of God
[1:11:10] that's right here's where it is to begin
[1:11:12] right here where Justice and
[1:11:13] righteousness and the Judgment of God is
[1:11:15] to go forth from the pull
[1:11:18] pit that means the pulpit is not just to
[1:11:21] make you feel
[1:11:22] good sometimes the pull pit is to make
[1:11:24] you feel
[1:11:25] bad so that you judge
[1:11:28] yourself I like it better when it makes
[1:11:30] me feel
[1:11:32] good but sometimes it does me better
[1:11:34] when it makes me feel
[1:11:36] bad but I like it better when it makes
[1:11:38] me feel good I like to be called an
[1:11:41] eagle I like to be called bride I like
[1:11:42] to be called the predestinated the apple
[1:11:44] of his eye I like it when somebody says
[1:11:47] you can no more fail than God can fail I
[1:11:49] love that
[1:11:50] preaching it makes me sore like Eagle
[1:11:53] wings
[1:11:54] but the problem is if we only get that
[1:11:56] preaching and none of the other we'll
[1:11:57] move on Flying Like an Eagle and not
[1:12:00] realizing there's parts of the world
[1:12:01] hanging on and creating drag and holding
[1:12:03] us back from the height we can really
[1:12:05] get
[1:12:07] to we need the full word of God amen
[1:12:12] amen let's go to Isaiah chapter
[1:12:22] 6
[1:12:29] says in chapter 6 verse
[1:12:37] 1 in the year that King Uzziah died I
[1:12:40] saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne
[1:12:42] high and lifted up and his train filled
[1:12:45] the
[1:12:46] temple Uzziah we know was a prophet of
[1:12:49] God he was a man of God serving God
[1:12:52] working for for the kingdom of God and
[1:12:55] he had his eyes on Uzziah we we know the
[1:12:57] the
[1:12:58] story but when he begins to express here
[1:13:03] where he was at the year that King
[1:13:04] Uzziah died he's disappointed
[1:13:06] discouraged because Uzziah was like a
[1:13:08] hero to him a Godly King and then he he
[1:13:11] had he had made a mistake and he had
[1:13:13] fell and and he said I saw the Lord
[1:13:15] sitting upon a throne high and lifted up
[1:13:17] and his train filled the temple so now
[1:13:20] he's going to get a fresh vision of God
[1:13:23] above it stood the seraphim and each one
[1:13:25] had six wings with Twain he covered his
[1:13:27] face and with Twain he covered his feet
[1:13:29] and with Twain he did fly and one Cried
[1:13:32] unto another and said holy holy holy is
[1:13:34] the Lord of hosts the whole Earth is
[1:13:36] filled full of his glory and the post of
[1:13:39] the door moved at the voice of him that
[1:13:41] cried and the house was filled with
[1:13:44] smoke then said I woe is me for I am
[1:13:47] undone because I am a man of unclean
[1:13:49] lips and I dwell in the midst of a
[1:13:51] people of unclean lips for my eyes have
[1:13:53] seen the king the Lord of hosts Here
[1:13:57] Comes Isaiah and Isaiah now is going to
[1:14:00] get a vision and he's going to see amen
[1:14:04] the Temple of the Lord and he's going to
[1:14:05] see The Throne of the Lord and he's
[1:14:07] going to be lifted up into another
[1:14:09] dimension amen and when he's lifted up
[1:14:11] to behold the glories of the Lord and
[1:14:13] the Perfection of the Lord he is getting
[1:14:15] a greater Revelation than he's ever had
[1:14:17] before but when he comes into that
[1:14:18] greater Revelation all of the sudden in
[1:14:21] that presence in that atmosphere there's
[1:14:23] an Awakening inside of him of what he's
[1:14:26] lacking amen all of a sudden he's
[1:14:27] realizing I'm not where I thought I was
[1:14:30] I'm not what I thought I was and all of
[1:14:32] a sudden he says woe is me he doesn't
[1:14:34] say lucky am I for this Vision amen I'm
[1:14:37] so I'm so elevated because I can see so
[1:14:40] much but the more he saw the more he
[1:14:42] realized what he was as a human being
[1:14:44] and how far he was from that
[1:14:47] Perfection I think it's the true in this
[1:14:49] message amen the more beautiful the word
[1:14:51] comes the more lifted up in the Heavenly
[1:14:53] the Dimensions we are the more we should
[1:14:54] realize how horrible this world is and
[1:14:57] how how terrible the old Cocker nature
[1:15:00] is and the hybridization that we were
[1:15:02] swn into what a terrible thing it is and
[1:15:04] we shouldn't trust our thoughts we
[1:15:06] shouldn't trust our emotions we
[1:15:07] shouldn't trust all those reactions of
[1:15:09] the flesh we should go high enough to
[1:15:11] say woe is me oh my goodness I need
[1:15:14] something
[1:15:18] more woe is
[1:15:20] me you say lucky am I
[1:15:24] woe is me amen for I am undone because
[1:15:29] I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in
[1:15:32] the midst of a people of unclean lips
[1:15:35] for mine eyes have seen the king the
[1:15:36] Lord of hosts something about this
[1:15:40] Revelation opened his heart and he could
[1:15:42] become so
[1:15:45] honest he could be some so
[1:15:50] honest there was no more self-de
[1:15:53] deception yeah I'm not there was no more
[1:15:57] whatever you know he was he was a
[1:16:00] prophet he had a Godly King everything
[1:16:02] was going well some trouble happens and
[1:16:05] then the year Uzziah dies and then he's
[1:16:08] lifted up and God's going to give him a
[1:16:10] greater Revelation and lift him into the
[1:16:11] heavenlies and open his eyes to see
[1:16:14] glories that he's never beheld before
[1:16:16] but as soon as he does all of a sudden
[1:16:18] he says woe am
[1:16:20] I oh God I need help yes I need more of
[1:16:25] you amen this Revelation friends when we
[1:16:28] open it up and we see what God has
[1:16:31] determined before the foundation of the
[1:16:32] world to do and that he's called you and
[1:16:34] I to be part of the program and he keeps
[1:16:36] lifting us higher and higher all of a
[1:16:38] sudden we should say oh God woe is me I
[1:16:41] got to have some help I need your spirit
[1:16:43] in me Lord I need you to correct my
[1:16:45] wrong understanding give me Revelation
[1:16:47] help keep my feet on the right path
[1:16:49] because I know amen that I cannot do it
[1:16:52] on my own
[1:16:54] amen so he come to this woe is me this
[1:16:59] reality struck him when the reality
[1:17:01] struck him a real raw honesty hit him
[1:17:06] and he could say I'm a man of unclean
[1:17:08] lips I have said things I should not
[1:17:10] have
[1:17:11] said and I dwell amongst the people with
[1:17:14] unclean lips they have said things they
[1:17:16] should not
[1:17:17] say and all of a sudden raw honesty
[1:17:22] looked him in the the face and instead
[1:17:25] of hiding from it he admitted to it he
[1:17:27] confessed
[1:17:30] it and then after he makes that
[1:17:33] statement we have verse
[1:17:35] six then flew one of the seraphim unto
[1:17:38] me having a live coal in his hand which
[1:17:40] had been taken with the tongs from off
[1:17:42] the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth
[1:17:44] and said Lo this hath touched thy lips
[1:17:47] and thine iniquity is taken away and thy
[1:17:49] sin purged hallelujah amen
[1:17:54] what does it take friends what does it
[1:17:56] take to move higher what does it take to
[1:17:57] be cleansed what does it take all it
[1:17:59] takes is a humble heart to say I am
[1:18:01] wrong am that's all it takes amen no
[1:18:04] more excuses no more justifications no
[1:18:07] more hiding behind a quote no more no
[1:18:09] more claiming Superior knowledge now we
[1:18:12] come to a time to just say I'm just
[1:18:14] playing wrong amen I shouldn't have
[1:18:16] acted like that I shouldn't have treated
[1:18:18] that brother that way I shouldn't have
[1:18:19] hid this thing in my life I'm just wrong
[1:18:24] and when he come to Raw honesty and he
[1:18:26] could place where he was and where the
[1:18:28] people he was with was and he got honest
[1:18:30] about it immediately come a seraphin
[1:18:32] with a coal off of the altar God has the
[1:18:35] power to fix the problem amen but what
[1:18:37] he needs is somebody who will lay
[1:18:39] themselves open again and say it's me oh
[1:18:42] God standing in the need of prayer it's
[1:18:43] me who's guilty oh God I'm the
[1:18:46] Man Nathan come to David and he said oh
[1:18:49] David you know he gives him a parable
[1:18:51] there was a man a rich man and he had
[1:18:53] all of these sheep then a traveler comes
[1:18:55] and and there was a poor man with only
[1:18:57] one little lamb and he loves that lamb
[1:18:59] so much and what does the rich man do he
[1:19:00] takes the poor man's lamp and he offers
[1:19:02] it and the parable is typing David in
[1:19:05] his great sin of taking bath Sheba away
[1:19:07] from
[1:19:08] Uriah and Nathan sets it all up and he
[1:19:11] declares it all and at the end when
[1:19:13] David passes a harsh judgment amen
[1:19:16] Nathan looks at him he says you're the
[1:19:18] man you're the man amen you're the one
[1:19:22] and you know what David says I'm the man
[1:19:25] I'm guilt immediately oh he shows what a
[1:19:27] child of God is like zealous to repent
[1:19:30] amen this is a man after God's Own Heart
[1:19:33] a man after God own heart may not be
[1:19:35] perfect amen may not be free of error
[1:19:37] but a man after God's Own Heart Will
[1:19:39] yield himself to God constantly that is
[1:19:43] a man after God's Own Heart because in
[1:19:45] acts when it says I've chosen David a
[1:19:47] man after God's Own Heart who will do
[1:19:49] all my will amen who will surrender
[1:19:53] himself every time he comes in contact
[1:19:56] with the word and the word exposes him
[1:19:58] as wrong he will say woe is
[1:20:02] me and then God will come with a coal
[1:20:05] off the fire god and cleanse his
[1:20:08] lips and then look at what he does next
[1:20:11] as soon as that seraphim comes with a
[1:20:14] live coal and touches his lips
[1:20:16] immediately there comes a
[1:20:18] call also I heard the voice of the Lord
[1:20:20] saying whom shall I send and who will go
[1:20:23] for us then said I here am I send
[1:20:27] me what was this whole thing about there
[1:20:30] was a purpose in Isaiah's life there was
[1:20:32] something God wanted to accomplish in
[1:20:34] his life amen but God had to bring him
[1:20:36] to another level not just another level
[1:20:38] of revelation but another level of
[1:20:40] surrender another level of humility
[1:20:43] another level of understanding the
[1:20:45] difference between him and
[1:20:47] God and when God brought in God wasn't
[1:20:50] doing away with Isaiah he wasn't
[1:20:51] punishing Isaiah he was he he had a
[1:20:54] commission a purpose a desire for Isaiah
[1:20:57] and he's going to bring Isaiah into this
[1:20:59] purpose regardless of what has happened
[1:21:01] what errors what misunderstandings what
[1:21:04] wrong Communications and all of a sudden
[1:21:06] he lifts him up and in that he's humbled
[1:21:08] he's a base and he recognizes it and
[1:21:10] then God purges him of his iniquity and
[1:21:14] calls who will go for us he says here am
[1:21:17] I send me that was God's intent all
[1:21:20] along that's what God wanted out of
[1:21:21] Isaiah's life all along and what does
[1:21:24] God want out of you and I he wants a
[1:21:26] witness of his resurrected life he wants
[1:21:28] a testimony in flesh that Jesus Christ
[1:21:31] is alive acting and breathing and living
[1:21:33] out the word of
[1:21:35] God that's what he wants amen and if
[1:21:38] anything begins to hinder that or
[1:21:40] it or hold it back amen he's
[1:21:42] going to bring judgment and chastisement
[1:21:44] why not because he likes to chastised
[1:21:47] because he's got a purpose in our
[1:21:51] life
[1:21:53] we need to be more willing to handle
[1:21:57] correction we need less pride in our
[1:22:00] lives
[1:22:03] amen prophet of God said this Pulpit
[1:22:07] this is where the Judgment seat of God
[1:22:08] is and the word is God's
[1:22:16] judge you know the prophet gives us a a
[1:22:19] battle order that we find in the Old
[1:22:21] Testament there was an order when they
[1:22:23] went to
[1:22:24] fight and and the prophet tells us this
[1:22:27] is the order of our services this is why
[1:22:29] we construct our services the way that
[1:22:31] we do because there's a certain order
[1:22:34] and in the battle order the singers
[1:22:36] would go
[1:22:37] first and as the singers went forward
[1:22:40] singing then the priest would come
[1:22:43] bearing the ark the word on their
[1:22:45] shoulders and then the the multitude the
[1:22:48] Warriors they would go into battle
[1:22:51] that's what he explains to to us and if
[1:22:53] you think about uh you think about a
[1:22:55] service now we come and the singers come
[1:22:58] first amen we all sing and we rejoice
[1:23:01] and we're making the way why because the
[1:23:03] word's coming next amen the singing
[1:23:05] comes first the word's coming next and
[1:23:07] then the levite comes bearing the word
[1:23:09] on his shoulder the minister comes to
[1:23:11] the pull pit Amen to preach the word and
[1:23:13] as soon as the word is brought forth the
[1:23:15] battle breaks out what battle the battle
[1:23:18] that's going on in your mind the battle
[1:23:19] that's all around you amen between the
[1:23:21] word of God in selfishness the word of
[1:23:24] God in Pride the word of God and and a
[1:23:26] desire the word of God in lust amen the
[1:23:29] battle breaks out right in you right in
[1:23:31] your seat right where you're sitting is
[1:23:33] where the battle's going
[1:23:35] on and it's raging as the word is being
[1:23:38] preach will I submit to this or will I
[1:23:40] resist this amen will I give in God or
[1:23:43] will I keep my
[1:23:46] ways that's the order of the service
[1:23:48] because there's a battle taking place
[1:23:50] every service amen will I receive the
[1:23:54] word or will I keep my
[1:23:59] idea will I come like Isaiah or will I
[1:24:02] just keep moving on the way I
[1:24:07] am this is why the service is
[1:24:10] constructed the way it
[1:24:12] is because it gives preeminence to the
[1:24:14] word because the word is what
[1:24:17] judges and what we need is to be judged
[1:24:23] that's right we don't need to be petted
[1:24:25] and stroked and told how good we are
[1:24:27] there's enough of that in the message
[1:24:29] and there's encouragement in that and
[1:24:30] we'll preach that all the time because
[1:24:31] it's the truth the apple of his eye but
[1:24:34] don't think just cuz we're bride that
[1:24:36] God will not correct his bride that's
[1:24:39] right we need
[1:24:44] it when let's go to Acts chapter
[1:24:48] 13 says the Judgment seat is the pull
[1:24:50] pit and God judged by his word
[1:24:58] acts
[1:25:03] 13 acts 13 and verse
[1:25:10] 44 acts 13:44 Paul and Barnabas are
[1:25:14] preaching
[1:25:15] now says in the next Sunday came almost
[1:25:17] the whole city gather to hear the word
[1:25:19] of God but when the Jews saw the
[1:25:21] multitudes they were filled with envy
[1:25:23] and spake against those things which
[1:25:25] were spoken by Paul contradicting and
[1:25:28] blaspheming and when Paul and Barnabas
[1:25:29] wax bold and said it was necessary that
[1:25:32] the word of God should first have been
[1:25:33] spoken to you but seeing you put it from
[1:25:36] you and judge
[1:25:39] yourselves
[1:25:40] Unworthy of everlasting
[1:25:44] life Lo we turn to the
[1:25:47] Gentiles during the preaching of the
[1:25:49] word there was a judgment that took
[1:25:51] place
[1:25:53] because the message of the hour is
[1:25:55] always eternal
[1:25:56] life the word of God for that day was
[1:25:59] eternal life they were preaching the
[1:26:02] word and they were presenting the word
[1:26:04] and when they turned against it he says
[1:26:07] seeing that you judge
[1:26:11] yourselves they passed their own
[1:26:13] judgment upon themselves by rejecting
[1:26:16] the
[1:26:18] word so is the pull pit a judgment seat
[1:26:23] yes but is the pull pit of Mercy
[1:26:26] Seat
[1:26:28] yes because those who received itall
[1:26:32] received it gladly and received eternal
[1:26:37] life turn to Jeremiah
[1:26:51] 17
[1:26:54] Jeremiah
[1:27:01] 17-9 Jeremiah 17 and verse 9 the heart
[1:27:06] is deceitful above all things and
[1:27:08] desperately wicked who can know it this
[1:27:12] is what's so hard with self- discernment
[1:27:15] self
[1:27:16] judgment your human heart is
[1:27:20] Crafty it hides amen you know the number
[1:27:23] one tactic of the devil is to hide not
[1:27:26] to come out and knock on your door and
[1:27:27] say I'm a devil and I'm here to deceive
[1:27:28] you
[1:27:29] today no but the devil's always hiding
[1:27:31] and he's hiding in something that looks
[1:27:33] good something that's desirable
[1:27:34] something that's not too bad he's always
[1:27:35] hiding amen and so sometimes our own
[1:27:38] desires of our heart get muddled up
[1:27:40] inside of us and the devil is hiding
[1:27:41] even our our own emotions and our own
[1:27:44] thoughts and the Heart Is desperately
[1:27:46] wicked who can know it let's go over to
[1:27:48] Hebrews
[1:27:50] Now Hebrew Hebrews chapter
[1:27:57] 4 Hebrews
[1:28:06] 4:12 for the word of God is quick and
[1:28:09] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:28:10] sword piercing even to the dividing aund
[1:28:12] of the soul and the spirit and of the
[1:28:14] joints and the marrow and is a discerner
[1:28:16] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:28:20] the heart is desperately wicked who can
[1:28:21] know it the word knows
[1:28:23] it absolutely the word knows it amen and
[1:28:27] that's why we still believe in fivefold
[1:28:29] Ministry and that's why we believe in
[1:28:30] live preaching of the word that God can
[1:28:33] anoint a man to take the sword of the
[1:28:35] word and cut you aunder till he
[1:28:37] separates your spirit and your soul
[1:28:40] because the heart is desperately wicked
[1:28:41] who can know it but the word is a
[1:28:43] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:28:45] the heart so that when the word starts
[1:28:47] getting close and en encroaching in on
[1:28:48] your problem don't get offended at the
[1:28:50] man that's preaching amen look at it and
[1:28:52] say woe is me God help me to be right
[1:28:55] with your word if you're pointing that
[1:28:57] at me I take it Lord fix me oh God
[1:29:00] humble me help me to
[1:29:03] surrender amen America is one of the
[1:29:05] hardest places in the world to preach
[1:29:07] the gospel because America was based on
[1:29:10] Rebellion the spirit of patriotism and
[1:29:12] the spirit of America is a spirit of
[1:29:14] rebellion and it's one of the hardest
[1:29:16] places in the world to preach the gospel
[1:29:18] because there's rebellious Spirits in
[1:29:20] America and there's a self uh uh uh
[1:29:23] there there's a such a sense of self
[1:29:25] ability in America we've always been on
[1:29:28] the top we've always been able to figure
[1:29:29] it out we led the world and all that but
[1:29:31] God is beginning to Humble America now
[1:29:33] because she's not going to be on the top
[1:29:35] very much
[1:29:37] longer am sometimes what we need is just
[1:29:40] Contrition and humility and surrender
[1:29:44] because the word of God is a discerner
[1:29:46] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:29:49] that's why we come for
[1:29:50] preaching we we come for encouragement
[1:29:54] for instruction and righteousness for
[1:29:56] reproof and rebuke we come for heart
[1:30:01] surgery sometimes things are so deep in
[1:30:03] our hearts wounds from when we were
[1:30:05] children Scars From the Past habits that
[1:30:09] set in generational things that were
[1:30:11] laid into us so long ago that we don't
[1:30:14] understand what happened rejection
[1:30:16] complexes that came from parents amen
[1:30:19] neglect that we suffered or abuse
[1:30:21] there's some things so deep in our heart
[1:30:22] we don't understand what's going on Amen
[1:30:25] but the grace of God he'll he'll take a
[1:30:27] man under his control and put the word
[1:30:29] of God in that man's mouth to come down
[1:30:32] and start to dive deep down into the
[1:30:34] heart and start to expose there's a
[1:30:36] problem here we've got to go deeper
[1:30:38] there's an issue laying here you got to
[1:30:40] go deeper something's laying there
[1:30:42] that's a
[1:30:44] problem we got to go
[1:30:46] deeper until that can be rooted out
[1:30:50] given to God and the coal can come and
[1:30:52] Purge and bring life and then he can say
[1:30:55] and now who will go for me say I'm here
[1:30:57] I'm here and I'm ready that's what I've
[1:30:58] always wanted was to serve you I've
[1:31:00] always wanted to do your
[1:31:02] will that's the purpose friends that's
[1:31:06] God's Great desire let's go to John
[1:31:08] chapter
[1:31:12] 15 John chapter
[1:31:17] 15 verse
[1:31:20] one
[1:31:26] John 15:1 Jesus says I am the True Vine
[1:31:30] and my father is the
[1:31:32] husbandman every branch in me that
[1:31:35] beareth not fruit he taketh away and
[1:31:37] every branch that beareth fruit he
[1:31:40] purgeth it that it may bring forth more
[1:31:43] fruit
[1:31:45] amen purgeth means to prune or to cut to
[1:31:50] it's also a word like like chasing to
[1:31:54] chastise he's not destroying this
[1:31:59] plant he's not shaming or embarrassing
[1:32:01] this
[1:32:03] plant he's cutting this
[1:32:06] plant and why is he cutting this plant
[1:32:10] so that it can bring forth more
[1:32:19] fruit I am the True Vine my father is
[1:32:22] the husbandman
[1:32:25] amen every branch in me that's not
[1:32:27] bearing he takes it away but every
[1:32:28] Branch that's bearing you know what
[1:32:31] Isaiah was doing Isaiah was bearing
[1:32:32] fruit I believe
[1:32:35] that but God purged him so that he could
[1:32:38] bear more fruit and in the end if you
[1:32:40] read down that God wasn't just after
[1:32:42] more fruit but then God was after much
[1:32:45] fruit what does he want in our life the
[1:32:47] purpose for which we're here is much
[1:32:49] fruit and God will come along
[1:32:52] and he'll take and he'll cut why because
[1:32:55] that's old
[1:32:57] growth old growth cut it off so the life
[1:33:00] can move forward it's going the wrong
[1:33:02] direction cut it off so life it's all
[1:33:05] about life it's all about fruit it's all
[1:33:07] about more life more fruit more
[1:33:11] abundance more service more display of
[1:33:14] righteousness more Holiness more of God
[1:33:17] on display in our
[1:33:18] lives that's what this whole thing is
[1:33:20] about the husbandman how will the
[1:33:23] husbandman cut us oh he's got many ways
[1:33:28] he use chastisement he use life
[1:33:30] circumstances and use the message to
[1:33:32] reading the Bible you can speak to your
[1:33:33] heart during the preaching of the word
[1:33:35] during service God has all kinds of ways
[1:33:37] to bring to our understanding that we're
[1:33:39] wrong and he's pruning and cutting and
[1:33:41] pruning and cutting instead of resisting
[1:33:44] that we should just say God cut me Lord
[1:33:47] I'm here cut me cut all the old growth
[1:33:50] cut all the wrong growth cut everything
[1:33:52] that's not shaping itself out right cut
[1:33:54] it off of me so that I can bring forth
[1:33:56] more fruit and God work with me till I
[1:33:58] bring forth much
[1:34:01] fruit scripture says he that will
[1:34:03] preserve his life shall lose it but he
[1:34:05] that will lose his life for my sake
[1:34:07] shall
[1:34:07] find we have way too much
[1:34:11] self-preservation way too much holding
[1:34:14] on to ideas and habits and things way
[1:34:18] too much
[1:34:19] self-preservation we need to good
[1:34:21] through purging from time to
[1:34:24] time God took job through a
[1:34:28] purging job wasn't a
[1:34:31] sinner job wasn't an unrighteous man is
[1:34:34] that right job wasn't a bad Jo God had
[1:34:38] confidence in Job that job wouldn't fail
[1:34:40] the trial job was righteous God loved
[1:34:43] job job was a child of God all this Came
[1:34:46] Upon job to try job and test job amen
[1:34:49] but but it was never to destroy job but
[1:34:52] there was a question laying in job's
[1:34:53] heart he wasn't sure about the
[1:34:56] resurrection and through all the trouble
[1:34:58] and through all the trial and through
[1:34:59] all it wasn't because job was
[1:35:00] unrighteous it wasn't because job had
[1:35:02] hidden sin in his life it wasn't because
[1:35:04] job wasn't a child of God or serving God
[1:35:06] it wasn't any of that but God put the
[1:35:08] clamps down upon job because he wanted
[1:35:10] to bring job into a greater Revelation
[1:35:12] he was going to answer job's question
[1:35:14] the same time he was proving what a son
[1:35:16] is to
[1:35:19] Satan oh pray praise God sometimes he
[1:35:22] wants to show what a son is in the midst
[1:35:24] of our trial and he'll let it come down
[1:35:26] but that's not usually the only thing
[1:35:27] he's doing is usually doing something in
[1:35:29] our lives at the same time bringing us
[1:35:31] in further growth bringing us higher up
[1:35:34] amen and it got to the place where job's
[1:35:35] friends kept coming along and accusing
[1:35:37] him of being a an unbeliever uh uh
[1:35:39] secretly harboring sin because God's
[1:35:41] bringing this judgment and job began to
[1:35:44] correct them and tell them that you're
[1:35:45] lousy comforters you're no good friends
[1:35:49] and why do you trouble me and why don't
[1:35:51] you come for me and why doesn't anybody
[1:35:52] help me but then he begins to turn amen
[1:35:55] and he starts to defend
[1:35:57] himself and he he starts to say I've not
[1:36:00] done anything wrong and we know he was
[1:36:02] righteous under the the the blood of a
[1:36:04] lamb under the word for his day he had
[1:36:06] offered the sacrifice he his his his
[1:36:09] sins were under that substitution we
[1:36:12] know he was righteous and he declared
[1:36:13] himself righteous he said I know had no
[1:36:15] hidden sin but what he started to do
[1:36:19] where he started to fail is he started
[1:36:22] to question God's
[1:36:25] judgment he started to question I don't
[1:36:28] know why God would do this if I could go
[1:36:30] knock on his door if I could plead my
[1:36:32] case before him like he could stand face
[1:36:34] to face with God and say God you
[1:36:35] shouldn't this and God you shouldn't
[1:36:37] that oh my goodness now when he started
[1:36:39] to defend himself and move into this
[1:36:41] place where if I could talk to God I
[1:36:43] would plead my case to his face all of a
[1:36:45] sudden U come around and elu begin to
[1:36:47] tell him you're nothing amen you were
[1:36:49] born Out of the Dust you have no breath
[1:36:52] but comes from God you have no life how
[1:36:54] dare you say you can stand toe to- Toe
[1:36:56] with him and question why he does
[1:37:01] anything and then God comes down and
[1:37:03] speaks to him directly he says G thyself
[1:37:05] up like a man I've got some questions
[1:37:07] for you where Were You Who put the
[1:37:09] boundaries on the water who decreed this
[1:37:11] and who who established that and who put
[1:37:13] the Earth Here amen if you can tell me
[1:37:15] tell me if you've got the answers tell
[1:37:17] me and God comes down to job and saying
[1:37:20] you can't question in me everything I do
[1:37:22] is right and you don't
[1:37:27] understand then we go to job 42 if you
[1:37:29] could turn there we're going to look at
[1:37:30] job's answer after God spoke to
[1:37:34] him when God come down and spoke to job
[1:37:37] like a man he spoke to him like a
[1:37:40] man not like a little boy not like a
[1:37:43] girl he said gir thyself up like a man
[1:37:46] I'm going to speak to you and God
[1:37:48] leveled it straight to him yeah
[1:37:52] amen I love that there's so much
[1:37:54] preaching that makes God sound like a
[1:37:56] like he's afraid to correct his
[1:37:58] children and he's got to talk soft and
[1:38:00] gentle to now you know dear that's not
[1:38:02] really
[1:38:03] nice look at how God spoke to job this
[1:38:06] is how God deals with the sign he he
[1:38:08] starts to lay it straight at
[1:38:11] him amen and this is Job's
[1:38:15] answer
[1:38:17] 42:1 then job answered the Lord and said
[1:38:20] I know that thou C do everything and
[1:38:23] that no thought can be withholden from
[1:38:25] thee who is he that hideth counsel
[1:38:27] without knowledge therefore have I
[1:38:29] uttered that I understand not things too
[1:38:31] wonderful for me which I knew not here I
[1:38:35] beseech thee and I will speak I will
[1:38:36] demand of thee and declare thou unto me
[1:38:39] I have heard of thee by the hearing of
[1:38:41] the ear but now mine eye seeth thee
[1:38:43] wherefore I AB bore myself and repent
[1:38:47] and dust and
[1:38:49] Ashes job who told his friends I've done
[1:38:51] nothing wrong I'm righteous there's no
[1:38:53] reason God will judge me I don't
[1:38:55] understand why he's doing this if I
[1:38:56] could go to his door if I could see him
[1:38:57] face to face I'd plead my case and I
[1:38:59] would tell him that I haven't done
[1:39:00] anything wrong you know what he was
[1:39:02] right to a certain extent but now when
[1:39:04] he comes to meet God face to face he
[1:39:06] doesn't speak as bold as he was when he
[1:39:08] was talking to his friends now when he
[1:39:10] comes face to face with God he said I AB
[1:39:12] bore myself and repent and dust and an
[1:39:16] ashes how could I be so proud and
[1:39:19] arrogant yeah
[1:39:23] verse
[1:39:25] seven and it was so that after the Lord
[1:39:27] had spoken these words un job the Lord
[1:39:30] said to elifaz the timite my wrath is
[1:39:33] kindled against thee and against thy two
[1:39:35] friends for you have not spoken to me
[1:39:37] the thing that is right as my servant
[1:39:38] job hath therefore take unto you now
[1:39:41] seven Bullocks and seven Rams and go to
[1:39:43] my servant job and offer up for
[1:39:45] yourselves a burn offering and my
[1:39:46] servant job shall pray for you God never
[1:39:50] thought less of job God never turned his
[1:39:53] back on job God never judged job to
[1:39:55] destroy him God put job back in his
[1:39:57] place so that God could put job back in
[1:39:59] his
[1:40:02] place sometimes God has to put us back
[1:40:04] in our place so that he can put us back
[1:40:06] in our place and our place is to
[1:40:08] manifest him our place is to declare his
[1:40:10] glory our place is to live this word and
[1:40:13] sometimes he's got to put us back in our
[1:40:15] place so he can put us back in our
[1:40:18] place help us go
[1:40:22] now he's using job he still got job in
[1:40:25] the right position now he's judging his
[1:40:29] friends for being wrong to job listen
[1:40:33] friends we don't ever have to defend
[1:40:34] ourselves or do anything God will make
[1:40:36] it all
[1:40:37] right God will straighten it all out God
[1:40:40] will make the wrong
[1:40:42] right amen he says offer up for
[1:40:46] yourselves a burnt offering for my
[1:40:47] servant job shall pray for you for him
[1:40:50] will I I accept less I deal with you
[1:40:53] after your Folly and that you have not
[1:40:55] spoken of me the thing which is right
[1:40:57] like my servant job so elifaz the timite
[1:41:00] and bildad the shuhite and Zur the
[1:41:02] Tonite tthy went and did according as
[1:41:05] the Lord commanded them and the Lord
[1:41:07] also accepted job and the Lord turned
[1:41:09] the Captivity of job when he prayed for
[1:41:11] his friends also the lord gave job twice
[1:41:14] as much as he had before then there came
[1:41:17] there unto him all his Brethren and all
[1:41:18] his sisters and all they that had been
[1:41:20] of his acquaintance before and did eat
[1:41:22] bread with them in his house and they
[1:41:24] bemoaned him and comforted him over all
[1:41:26] the evil that the Lord had brought upon
[1:41:28] him every man also gave him a piece of
[1:41:30] money and everyone an earring of gold so
[1:41:33] the Lord blessed the latter end of job
[1:41:35] more than the beginning for he had
[1:41:37] 14,000 sheep 6,000 camels a thousand Yol
[1:41:40] of oxen and a th000 shei asses he also
[1:41:43] had seven sons and three daughters what
[1:41:46] did God do God wasn't destroying job God
[1:41:50] was answering job's
[1:41:52] question and then he had to put job in
[1:41:55] his place when job stepped a little too
[1:41:58] high God brought a correction to him
[1:42:00] through elu and then he came down
[1:42:03] himself when elu came it's a type of
[1:42:06] Elijah elu and Elijah means the same
[1:42:08] thing it's type of brother benham's Myer
[1:42:10] Ministry he says I come to you per your
[1:42:14] request for I am in flesh I am in clay I
[1:42:18] represent God he's coming down saying
[1:42:20] you asked to meet God you asked to meet
[1:42:22] him face to face he said if God if I
[1:42:25] could talk to God Like a Man and elu
[1:42:27] comes down which elu and Elijah is the
[1:42:29] same word elu comes down and says I'm
[1:42:31] here to answer your request I'm here at
[1:42:33] your request you wanted flesh to talk to
[1:42:35] you wanted God face to face and elu
[1:42:37] started laying him out and job had no
[1:42:40] answer for
[1:42:42] elu and then after elu came
[1:42:48] God job says in one place I've spoke
[1:42:51] once I'll speak no more I spoke I'll put
[1:42:53] my hand over my mouth lest I should
[1:42:55] speak again then later he says I bore
[1:42:59] myself and dust and
[1:43:01] Ashes when job came to that level of
[1:43:04] Correction God imediately picked him up
[1:43:09] and said now this is what I've always
[1:43:12] wanted I've got a position for you amen
[1:43:15] your friends need you those who
[1:43:16] corrected you now they need you for only
[1:43:18] you will I accept and the friends had to
[1:43:20] come to him the loved ones who left him
[1:43:22] came to him they brought him money He
[1:43:24] restored everything he had He restored
[1:43:26] double and he got his sons and his
[1:43:27] daughters
[1:43:29] back friends the Way Up Is Down it'll
[1:43:34] always remain
[1:43:37] true brother Brenham said the way of in
[1:43:39] the way of a true Prophet 1962 he said I
[1:43:41] do believe in
[1:43:43] purgatory don't let that stumble you
[1:43:45] it's not Catholic
[1:43:48] Purgatory said I do believe in purgatory
[1:43:50] but I believe it's right
[1:43:52] now you purge your your own soul
[1:43:56] Purgatory means to purge when you see
[1:43:58] you done something wrong get out there
[1:44:00] and clean it out of You by confession
[1:44:02] and crying and fasting and
[1:44:04] praying man let's be serious about this
[1:44:07] we're called to a high calling in this
[1:44:09] end
[1:44:10] time let it not be a
[1:44:14] mysterymen I want to look at two more
[1:44:16] scriptures let's go to Psalms
[1:44:19] 32
[1:44:29] Psalms 32 and
[1:44:42] 1 blessed is he whose transgression is
[1:44:46] Forgiven whose sin is
[1:44:48] covered this is a Psalm of of David
[1:44:51] David knows what it's like to sin to
[1:44:54] fail to be chastened of the
[1:44:58] Lord blessed is he whose transgressions
[1:45:02] Is Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed
[1:45:03] is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth
[1:45:06] not iniquity and in whose Spirit there
[1:45:08] is no guile when I kept silence my bones
[1:45:12] waxed old through my roaring all day
[1:45:15] long for the day and night thy hand was
[1:45:18] Heavy upon me my moistures turned the
[1:45:20] drought of Summer CA I acknowledge my
[1:45:23] sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I
[1:45:25] not hid I said I will confess my
[1:45:27] transgressions unto the Lord and thou
[1:45:29] forgest the iniquity of my sin for this
[1:45:33] shall everyone that is Godly pray unto
[1:45:36] thee in a time when thou mayest be found
[1:45:37] surely in the floods of Great Waters
[1:45:39] they shall not come nigh unto
[1:45:43] him David knew what it was
[1:45:45] like he knew what it was like to have
[1:45:48] the heavy hand of God upon him day and
[1:45:51] night his hand was Heavy upon me my
[1:45:54] moisture is turned into the drought of
[1:45:56] Summer I acknowledg my sin unto thee and
[1:46:00] my iniquity have I not hid I said I will
[1:46:03] confess my transgressions and Lord and
[1:46:05] thou forgave us the iniquity of my
[1:46:08] sin oh thank
[1:46:11] God if we confess our sins he'll forgive
[1:46:14] us of our sins and cleanse us from all
[1:46:18] unrighteousness amen God's looking for
[1:46:21] Humble Hearts to just say I'm the man
[1:46:25] I'm the
[1:46:26] one David he said I'm the one I'm guilty
[1:46:30] when the Prophet come and laid it out he
[1:46:32] said I'm guilty of
[1:46:34] that and then you know what the Judgment
[1:46:39] came but God
[1:46:41] says I have heard you and I have
[1:46:45] forgiven you of your sins immediately I
[1:46:49] have forgiven you of your sins
[1:46:51] did David suffer yes he suffered there
[1:46:54] was things that he did he had to suffer
[1:46:55] for he suffered in his family in fact
[1:46:57] the child that that that Beba conceived
[1:47:00] in their sin that child the the hand the
[1:47:03] hand of the Lord was upon that child and
[1:47:05] that child
[1:47:07] died it
[1:47:09] died and think oh what a heavy price to
[1:47:12] transgress the word of
[1:47:14] God but oh after the mour he Comfort his
[1:47:19] wife again and she
[1:47:22] conceived after after the rebuke after
[1:47:26] the repentance after the Judgment after
[1:47:28] the consequences were realized then all
[1:47:31] of a sudden God brings another
[1:47:33] conception and what's coming this time
[1:47:35] coming Solomon this time oh God restores
[1:47:39] God lifts up his purpose will never be
[1:47:41] defeated he's got a plan and that plan
[1:47:43] will never change David wasn't removed
[1:47:45] from King David was still established as
[1:47:48] king amen and then out of his loin would
[1:47:50] come Solomon amen through such tragedy
[1:47:53] God will bring it back into position and
[1:47:55] now Nathan didn't call him Solomon
[1:47:58] Nathan called him jedadiah and jedadiah
[1:48:00] means whom the Lord loveth oh praise God
[1:48:03] his forgiveness is great his Mercy is
[1:48:05] new every
[1:48:08] morning what did it take a humble heart
[1:48:11] of
[1:48:14] repentance I want to read I'm just going

[1:48:19] short scripture hose Hosea

[1:48:26] he hath torn and he will heal us he hath
[1:48:31] smitten and he will bind us

[1:48:38] chastisement the hand that scores is

[1:48:43] Comforts The Hand That judges is also
[1:48:46] the hand that restores amen never to
[1:48:50] destroy but always to keep that son or
[1:48:53] daughter in their position am God's the
[1:48:56] same way he is broken but he will bind
[1:49:00] us up he is smitten but he will heal
