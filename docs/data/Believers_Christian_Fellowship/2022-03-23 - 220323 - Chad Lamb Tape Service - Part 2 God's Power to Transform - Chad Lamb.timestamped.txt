[6:34] in your presence
[6:36] god as we turn our attention to your
[6:38] word
[6:39] god we listen to this tape lord we hear
[6:42] the voice that you chose to speak this
[6:44] message through in this generation
[6:46] oh how we are privileged people lord
[6:50] may you take the words that will be
[6:51] spoken drive them into our heart lord
[6:54] and bring changes in our life and bring
[6:56] fruit lord from that seed that will be
[6:58] planted in our heart and may it bear
[7:00] fruit for your glory i pray that you'd
[7:02] bless your people tonight that you would
[7:04] take preeminence in all that we say and
[7:06] do and may we bless you lord in our
[7:08] praises and bless you and our approach
[7:10] to your word we ask lord that you would
[7:13] watch over all of this in jesus christ's
[7:15] name we pray
[7:17] amen
[7:18] man god bless you while we're standing
[7:19] let's take our bibles and go to the
[7:21] opening scripture that brother branham
[7:22] turned to in the beginning in romans
[7:25] chapter 12.
[7:27] also i'd like to inform everybody that
[7:30] we have a special
[7:31] treat this evening we've got a baptism
[7:34] tonight our young brother levi brooks
[7:36] has desired to be baptized in the name
[7:38] of the lord jesus christ so we're very
[7:40] excited to see him baptized and very
[7:42] excited for the brooks
[7:44] family
[7:45] so let's read now in romans chapter 12.
[7:49] this is the scripture brother branham
[7:50] began with
[7:52] verse
[7:53] 1 or 1 and 2.
[7:55] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[7:57] mercies of god that you present your
[7:59] bodies a living sacrifice
[8:02] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[8:04] reasonable service and be not conformed
[8:07] to this world but be transformed by the
[8:09] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[8:11] what is the good and acceptable and
[8:13] perfect will of god
[8:15] also if you could turn with me to isaiah
[8:17] 14
[8:18] there's two other scriptures that he's
[8:20] going to get into in this section
[8:22] that we're going to listen to
[8:24] tonight and
[8:26] the first one is isaiah 14
[8:30] and verse 12
[8:32] isaiah 14 and 12
[8:35] how art thou fallen from heaven o
[8:37] lucifer son of the morning howarth thou
[8:40] cut down to the ground which didst
[8:42] weaken the nations
[8:43] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[8:45] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[8:47] throne above the stars of god i will sit
[8:50] also upon the mount of the congregation
[8:52] in the sides of the north so this is a
[8:55] scripture reference brother venom will
[8:56] refer to in the tape tonight and also
[8:59] one more and second thessalonians
[9:02] chapter two
[9:04] ii thessalonians chapter two
[9:14] 2 thessalonians 2
[9:16] and verse 3 and verse 4.
[9:23] let no man deceive you by any means for
[9:25] that day shall not come except there
[9:27] come a falling away first and that man
[9:29] of sin be revealed the son of perdition
[9:32] who opposeth and exalteth himself above
[9:35] all that is called god or that is
[9:37] worship so that he as god sitteth in the
[9:39] temple of god showing himself that he is
[9:42] god amen god bless the reading of his
[9:45] word you can have your seats
[9:49] uh last time we started at the beginning
[9:51] and we went to
[9:52] uh page 14 but we're going to back up
[9:55] just a little bit just to catch a little
[9:57] bit of the context we were in and we're
[9:59] going to begin on page 12
[10:01] and we're going to start at the
[10:02] beginning of paragraph 80. so we're
[10:04] going to start at page 12
[10:06] the beginning of paragraph 80 and we
[10:08] will go to the bottom of page 26
[10:11] to 9.
[10:13] so i'm going to go through a quick
[10:14] review
[10:16] last time with the question since it's
[10:17] been two weeks since we were here for
[10:20] this tape the first question we asked
[10:22] was what is the bible and we got the
[10:24] answer from the prophet of god it is god
[10:26] in letter form
[10:28] it is the word of god and it is god but
[10:30] it's god in letter form and we ask what
[10:32] does the word transform mean it means to
[10:35] be changed
[10:36] then the next question was what is the
[10:38] channel that every seed must stay in and
[10:41] that is his line of the word we the the
[10:44] every seed must stay in the channel of
[10:46] god's word and if it stays in the
[10:48] channel of god's word every seed will
[10:50] bring forth what god designed for it to
[10:52] bring forth because he put the power of
[10:54] transformation in the seed it's already
[10:57] in the seed if the seed stays in the
[10:59] line of the word then it'll produce
[11:01] everything that god put in it but from
[11:03] before
[11:04] that's powerful friends for us that is
[11:07] powerful because god placed a seed
[11:08] within us from before the foundation of
[11:10] the world and what must we do to
[11:13] transform ourselves what must we do amen
[11:15] for all the potentials in the seed to
[11:16] come out all we have to do is stay in
[11:19] the line of his word and if we stay in
[11:20] the line of the word everything will
[11:22] come out amen
[11:25] amen the next question what what
[11:27] power does the enemy have we know that
[11:30] god placed within the seed the power of
[11:32] transformation by his word but what
[11:34] power did the enemy have was the power
[11:37] to deform the power of deformation not
[11:39] transformation and what does he do with
[11:42] that power he makes his own eden so
[11:45] that's the review from last time that's
[11:46] what we picked up on last time and now
[11:49] let's go to our questions if we can
[11:51] bring up the powerpoint brother franco
[11:53] and we'll go to our
[11:55] questions now
[11:58] all right question number one
[12:03] what was satan's purpose from eden
[12:07] sometimes these questions would be
[12:08] worded a little funny but you'll find
[12:10] out in the tape why it's worded that way
[12:11] i worded it as close to the way brother
[12:13] branham says it as possible like i said
[12:15] last time there's no trick questions
[12:17] there's nothing odd this is just the way
[12:19] it was worded there what was satan's
[12:21] purpose from eden
[12:23] question 1
[12:25] what was satan's purpose from eden
[12:29] so that means satan has had a purpose
[12:31] for 6 000 years
[12:36] and uh
[12:39] what can quicken the word
[12:44] what can quicken the word
[12:49] question number two
[12:51] what can quicken the word
[12:59] and then question number three
[13:02] how did satan deform the original seed
[13:09] how did satan deform
[13:11] the original
[13:13] seed
[13:17] tell you what as we go through this you
[13:18] could preach a sermon on each question
[13:23] brother branham
[13:24] if you caught it last time in that first
[13:26] 45 minutes or so we listened to brother
[13:29] branham dropped so many gold nuggets he
[13:31] taught so much doctrine and packed it in
[13:33] that it's hard to hold yourself back
[13:36] but question three how did satan deform
[13:38] the original seed
[13:40] and question four
[13:42] what is the true thinking man's filter
[13:46] so he preaches this message just a short
[13:48] time after he preached thinking man's
[13:50] filter and so he discusses that a bit in
[13:52] this section we're getting into what is
[13:55] the true thinking man's filter
[14:05] what is the true thinking man's filter
[14:10] and then question number five
[14:14] what
[14:15] what is satan's business
[14:18] like i said before you can answer that
[14:20] all kinds of ways but if you'll wait and
[14:21] just see how brother branham handles
[14:23] that and the way he words it
[14:25] what is satan's business
[14:30] amen question number five
[14:32] what is satan's business
[14:34] now as we begin here in paragraph 80
[14:36] you're going to find that brother
[14:37] branham as we talked about before he's
[14:40] preaching this uh september 11 1965
[14:44] towards the end of his ministry
[14:45] he's preaching it for the full gospel
[14:47] businessman fellowship
[14:50] for the breakfast at the ramada inn in
[14:52] phoenix arizona and you can tell as he
[14:54] gets into this part that brother branham
[14:56] is really laboring in a real
[14:58] evangelistic style to try to get the
[15:01] people to see the condition of the
[15:02] church to open their eyes to what's all
[15:05] around them and you can see that he the
[15:07] prophet of god is laboring to get the
[15:10] the people that are there to see what
[15:12] the systems has produced and where
[15:14] pentecost the pentecostal revival has
[15:16] gone and he's really laboring to do that
[15:18] and so you can catch his burden as you
[15:21] as you listen to this tape so we're
[15:22] going to begin now on on page
[15:25] 12 paragraph 80. brother frank if you
[15:28] can go ahead and start the tape for us
[15:31] now
[15:32] satan
[15:33] is the author
[15:36] of civilization
[15:39] he is the author of science
[15:42] he is the author of education
[15:45] he says that true all right let us read
[15:48] in god's word now genesis 4 and let's go
[15:51] back and just see for a minute i know i
[15:53] may if i get too long brother carl will
[15:55] probably tell me but uh genesis the
[15:58] fourth chapter in the 16th verse gold's
[16:01] head telling here in the beginning what
[16:03] god
[16:04] did in order to place the curse upon the
[16:07] man and the woman and all that they was
[16:09] to do not the curse on them but tell
[16:11] them what would happen to curse the
[16:12] ground for adam's sake
[16:14] and we find out here now that
[16:17] eve
[16:18] had a pair of twins
[16:20] and one of them was of satan and one of
[16:23] them was of god now you say oh no now
[16:26] brother brent just a minute you find me
[16:28] one scripture anywhere that says that
[16:31] cain was adam's son
[16:34] i'll show you in the scripture where it
[16:35] says
[16:36] cain was of that evil one
[16:39] not adam
[16:41] now notice when she conceived here we
[16:43] begin at the fourth
[16:44] chapter first and adam knew his wife and
[16:47] she conceived and bear cain and said i
[16:50] have gotten she said now i have gotten a
[16:52] son from the lord of course the head of
[16:53] me no matter if it was prostitute or
[16:55] anything had come from god see because
[16:57] that's his seed it's a law of a seed it
[16:59] has to bring forth where this corrupted
[17:01] seed perverted seed or whatever it is
[17:03] it's got to bring forth anyhow it's his
[17:05] command and she again bear his brother
[17:08] abel no more knewing adam knew his wife
[17:12] and she bear
[17:14] came
[17:15] and also bear able twins
[17:19] satan was with her that morning adam
[17:21] that after you and you see the big fuss
[17:22] in the paper here i believe the tucson
[17:24] now
[17:24] that woman bringing forth a colored
[17:26] child and a white child at the same time
[17:29] she lived with her husband that morning
[17:30] and the man that afternoon and the man
[17:32] would take care of the white man said
[17:33] take care of his own child but the
[17:34] colored man would have to take care of
[17:36] his own see i know that in breeding of
[17:38] dogs and so forth it certainly will if
[17:41] it's in a few hours afterwards this
[17:42] proves
[17:44] now the show where civilization come
[17:46] from now let us read genesis over here
[17:50] uh uh
[17:51] in the fourth chapter of genesis again
[17:54] and see where the 16th verse and cain
[17:57] went out from the presence of god and
[17:59] dwelt in the land of nod
[18:02] on the east side of eden and cain knew
[18:04] his wife and she conceived and bear
[18:07] enough
[18:08] and he built a city and called the name
[18:11] of the city after his son enoch
[18:14] civilization
[18:18] dr scofield here in my scofield bible
[18:20] says the first civilization
[18:23] notice then he begot sons and they made
[18:26] organs and music the next one begot sons
[18:29] and he began to do other things wonders
[18:32] build cities and and make uh
[18:35] instruments of brass and all kinds of
[18:37] things see that's what he did become the
[18:40] first civilization which was
[18:43] canaanite
[18:47] peace
[18:48] done the same thing down through the
[18:50] ages
[18:52] now
[18:53] let's get there with the 25th verse and
[18:55] watch what the next was
[18:57] and adam knew his wife again
[19:01] now and she bear a son
[19:04] and call his name seth for god said she
[19:07] has appointed
[19:09] me another seed instead of abel who came
[19:12] through
[19:13] and saith and to say up to him also
[19:16] there was born a son and he called his
[19:18] name enos and then
[19:21] began man to call upon the name of the
[19:23] lord
[19:24] out of the south side
[19:26] not the canaanite side
[19:28] see
[19:29] that great intellectual
[19:32] that we all so hold to
[19:35] what's communism today what's their god
[19:40] it's the intellectual science
[19:45] what are we doing anyhow
[19:48] where are we living
[19:51] consider these words today
[19:54] now
[19:55] he
[19:56] has his kind of an eden
[19:59] satan does now in these 6 000 years
[20:03] he has
[20:04] formed not created but deformed
[20:09] god's whole earth
[20:12] is creatures
[20:14] the animals
[20:16] integrating high breeding
[20:18] trees plants
[20:20] human even to religion
[20:23] the bible church
[20:25] until he's got himself
[20:27] a complete
[20:29] garden of eden of science
[20:33] everything moving by science
[20:37] automobiles
[20:39] everything that we have was given to us
[20:42] by science
[20:43] what man has done
[20:46] and he's got his great eden here
[20:49] to prove the message is timely
[20:53] to prove that it's not some other age
[20:56] but revelations 10.
[20:58] look at the high breeding today
[21:01] to make a better or prettier not a
[21:04] better
[21:05] look at little children today
[21:07] i had my daughter to a dentist yesterday
[21:10] and he said her teeth was twisting
[21:12] brother
[21:13] down in tucson brother norm and had his
[21:15] little daughter and her teeth was
[21:17] bucking out
[21:18] and the dentist says that
[21:20] soon
[21:21] he believes that maybe in times to come
[21:24] that people be born he's growing anyway
[21:27] it's the food that we're eating
[21:29] hybrid food
[21:31] did you read reader's digest last month
[21:34] about billy graham the noble advances
[21:36] have you been listening to him
[21:38] i pray for him now more than ever when
[21:40] he's talked to those turned around
[21:41] callers and so forth the other night
[21:44] laying it on that clergy something's
[21:46] happened to him
[21:49] one of these days i hope he sees his
[21:51] position where he's at
[21:53] notice
[21:55] now
[21:56] calling from sodom
[21:58] that perverted city
[22:00] and now notice
[22:02] this
[22:03] in readers digest billy had gotten so
[22:06] weak that he couldn't even hold his
[22:07] meetings and they told him he had to run
[22:09] take exercise and so forth she runs a
[22:11] mile each day i believe it is there's
[22:13] something to get extra sign man is
[22:14] rotten
[22:16] the whole human race is corrupted
[22:20] everything is like it wasn't antelopian
[22:22] time
[22:23] it's completely upset turned around
[22:27] different from the straight rule that
[22:29] god planted them in
[22:30] sin through science and deception has
[22:34] twisted the whole human race
[22:38] did you read also just below that
[22:40] article word said in in these days that
[22:43] little girls and boys are in their
[22:45] middle age according to physical
[22:47] structure between 20 and 25 years old
[22:52] think of it
[22:55] it's determined the other night i picked
[22:56] up a girl 22 years old in menopause
[23:00] called rotten that's what a doctor told
[23:02] her
[23:04] see
[23:05] it's a pollen degenerate
[23:09] hellbound race
[23:11] of corruption
[23:16] i know that sounds not ethical but it's
[23:19] biblical
[23:21] that it is true
[23:23] this race that we're living in this
[23:26] generation of people
[23:28] now
[23:30] notice today
[23:31] high breeding
[23:33] cattle
[23:34] high breeding plants
[23:37] and science comes right back around the
[23:39] same science that does it
[23:41] says that it's what's destroying the
[23:43] whole human race
[23:45] you read it the same as i do
[23:47] oh why don't this stop it
[23:51] is because that they can't stop it
[23:56] god's word is said it would be that way
[23:59] but if they think for a minute there are
[24:00] the instruments
[24:02] as judah says carrot
[24:04] placing
[24:07] exactly the thing that god said would
[24:09] happen it's doing it
[24:10] just exactly
[24:12] on their own basis of sign
[24:15] by his scientific research in the same
[24:18] pattern he deceived eve he also has to
[24:20] see the church
[24:23] which eve was a type
[24:27] now
[24:29] now adam a type there again or any
[24:32] brother of the church
[24:34] notice what it did
[24:35] through the
[24:37] wandering for knowledge
[24:39] she slips across the line between right
[24:42] and wrong
[24:43] by listening to satan's perversion or
[24:46] deformity of the original word of god
[24:50] and now
[24:51] the churches today has become
[24:54] deformed
[24:56] i'm not talking about the peoples the
[24:58] individuals i'm talking about the church
[25:01] world
[25:02] once twisted one way and one twisted
[25:05] another
[25:06] and by signs
[25:08] same pattern that it is
[25:10] he has carried out his threats
[25:13] satan has of isaiah 14 12 let's just
[25:15] read that for a minute
[25:18] in the book of isaiah let's begin the
[25:20] 14th chapter 12 first
[25:23] how art by falling from heaven o lucifer
[25:26] sun of the morning power thought cast
[25:29] down to the ground which dideth weaken
[25:31] the nations this is isaiah seeing him in
[25:34] a vision see in the age to come
[25:36] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[25:39] ascend into heaven
[25:41] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[25:44] of god
[25:46] i will set also upon the mount of the
[25:48] congregation
[25:50] the side and the gnar
[25:54] satan's purpose from eden was to make
[25:58] his own self of eden and exalt himself
[26:01] above
[26:03] so the stars of god would worship him
[26:06] son
[26:09] but worship him
[26:11] and he's
[26:12] absolutely carried out
[26:15] now
[26:16] and when he's done this and brought it
[26:18] into the church which i won't go in
[26:20] details any of it listen to them tapes
[26:22] know about him
[26:24] that
[26:25] that's exactly the hour we're living in
[26:27] and it's satan that's done it
[26:30] through educational programs better fit
[26:33] better this better that and not knowing
[26:35] all the time they're walking right
[26:37] straight into death
[26:40] blinded
[26:42] leading the blind
[26:45] blinded leaders of the nations blinded
[26:48] leaders of science blind leaders of the
[26:51] church
[26:52] blind leading the blinded
[26:56] jesus said let them alone
[27:00] they'll both fall in the ditch
[27:04] here notice the type of the two eden so
[27:07] closely typed together to almost deceive
[27:10] the very elected
[27:12] matthew 24 24 said that it would be that
[27:14] way
[27:16] but i want us to stop for a few moments
[27:18] and consider these two eden
[27:22] and one thing especially how the bible
[27:25] tells us that god's word did produce
[27:28] that eden and how god's word warns us
[27:32] that the other eden would come
[27:35] now we also know that there has got to
[27:37] be another eden if we would also listen
[27:41] to the prophet paul in 2nd thessalonians
[27:44] the second chapter
[27:46] i could read it if you want to he who
[27:48] exalts himself that day will not come of
[27:50] the lord until that man of sin be
[27:54] revealed
[27:55] he who sets in the temple of god
[27:58] exalting himself above all that's called
[28:01] god
[28:03] so that he as god is worshipped as god
[28:07] think of that
[28:09] now isaiah 14
[28:11] the prophet said that he saw lucifer in
[28:15] his heart to a vision under inspiration
[28:18] of god
[28:19] saying he would do that
[28:22] in isaiah 800 years before paul
[28:25] or approximately that now here 800 years
[28:28] later paul's season comes to his
[28:30] position
[28:33] notice it heads up is eden
[28:37] his scientific eden with his scientific
[28:40] world with a scientific bride church
[28:45] all under the
[28:48] the word of knowledge
[28:51] great seminary
[28:53] great degree
[28:55] educational program
[28:58] listen brother sister each one of us is
[29:01] going to walk that road to florence what
[29:04] i asked you in jesus name to consider
[29:07] this
[29:10] not consider it me i'm your brother
[29:14] that that isn't it consider the word
[29:16] that i'm speaking of god's bible
[29:19] and look through perfectly vindicated in
[29:23] god's own word in the age we're living
[29:25] in where we're at
[29:27] these programs are absolutely antichrist
[29:31] in themselves
[29:33] now
[29:35] he's got to have an eden he said he
[29:37] would do it here's a simple word of god
[29:39] saying he would do it and here we look
[29:41] right out and seen him do it
[29:44] he's done it
[29:46] with his intellectual
[29:49] scientific
[29:51] denominational
[29:52] bride
[29:55] he's going to take head one of these
[29:57] days
[29:58] in the world council of churches
[30:01] that'll be set up
[30:03] all will be with him
[30:05] kind the people not
[30:09] because they're bad people
[30:11] they were planted in that straight row
[30:14] like corn
[30:16] but satan sowed the creepers
[30:19] called science research education
[30:22] doctor's degree sometimes they won't
[30:23] even let you in a pulpit unless you can
[30:25] produce a doctor's degree from some
[30:26] seminary somewhere
[30:29] it's all wrong
[30:32] not the people it's the program it's
[30:34] wrong
[30:38] and now what's it done it's all headed
[30:42] up again and brought the whole entire
[30:44] world through a bunch of hybriding
[30:47] perversion of the original seed of god
[30:50] to another
[30:51] darkened chaos
[30:57] but i'm so glad
[30:59] that god is mindful of us again
[31:02] that he could still move upon the face
[31:05] of the condition
[31:08] he promised he'd do it and call a little
[31:10] flop
[31:11] which would be his bride
[31:15] notice here again now how perfect these
[31:18] churches type are these eden
[31:21] god
[31:22] through a seed
[31:24] of his word
[31:27] and there's only one thing that can
[31:29] quicken the word and that is the spirit
[31:33] for it is the life giver
[31:36] to the word and when the life in the
[31:38] word
[31:39] meets the life of the spirit it produces
[31:43] whatever the seed is
[31:47] now
[31:49] notice what's happened
[31:51] in the garden of eden was god's economy
[31:55] of innocence
[31:59] and that was one of the um
[32:01] the dispensations
[32:04] the first dispensation was innocent
[32:07] the people
[32:08] knowed no sin
[32:11] they didn't know anything about sin both
[32:14] adam and eve were naked
[32:18] but they were hid from their nakedness
[32:21] by
[32:22] a spirit veil over their face
[32:26] they never knew that they were naked at
[32:29] all
[32:32] because they were here for god's veil in
[32:35] their own mind
[32:37] they didn't know what right and wrong
[32:39] was
[32:40] and then both standing there naked
[32:42] showed that the knowledge had not yet
[32:45] come to them
[32:48] that they were naked
[32:51] the pair was naked and knew it not
[32:54] now if you'll turn if you wish you'll
[32:56] write it down to revelations the third
[32:59] chapter
[33:00] the holy spirit predicted in this last
[33:03] age to the lady of sia pentecostal
[33:07] church age and the last days it said
[33:09] thou art
[33:10] naked and blind
[33:14] and knoweth not
[33:16] there
[33:17] is god's
[33:19] seed
[33:21] under innocence not knowing at all they
[33:24] were naked
[33:26] under a veil of the holy spirit bailing
[33:28] them from sin
[33:31] and now in the last church age we find
[33:33] here that they're naked again and don't
[33:35] know it but it's not the holy spirit
[33:38] veil it's the veil that satan slipped
[33:40] over eve back there a veil of lust
[33:45] the lust veil
[33:47] they are so filthy
[33:49] so they don't know that they are naked
[33:52] are women on the street with sharks on
[33:57] sexy dress
[34:00] someone sent me a
[34:01] piece in the paper the other day of this
[34:03] new dress
[34:06] that they're going to wear
[34:07] i think the 14 inches from the hips are
[34:10] something
[34:11] and um
[34:12] i wonder
[34:15] if our of our women folks
[34:18] does realize
[34:20] that that is a lust fail
[34:24] now you you say i can prove before god
[34:27] that i'm innocent of any adultery to my
[34:29] husband
[34:30] or i i all this but still at the
[34:33] judgment you're going to be called an
[34:35] adulteress
[34:38] the bible said so
[34:40] jesus said whosoever looketh upon a
[34:42] woman to lust after her hath committed
[34:45] adultery with her already in his heart
[34:49] blind
[34:50] naked and don't know it
[34:53] not them poor little women out there
[34:55] it's nothing i got against them
[34:58] it's that evil
[35:03] and the system of the church
[35:06] seems to fail to recognize it or stand
[35:08] against it let them bubble up their
[35:10] hairs wear makeup and shorts and things
[35:14] under the name of christianity
[35:17] what a horrible thing it is
[35:20] see they're naked again and satan's eden
[35:23] and those if not
[35:25] they don't know it
[35:27] i believe i've seen
[35:29] perhaps looking across sure the swimming
[35:31] pool at women out there now
[35:33] if that woman only realized
[35:37] that what she's doing
[35:40] but she doesn't know it
[35:43] she's naked
[35:45] her body is sacred
[35:47] she strips off the clothes that god
[35:50] clothed her with with skin for this
[35:52] generation
[35:54] she constantly cuts it off she's naked
[35:58] under the
[35:59] word of civilization higher education
[36:03] better civilization
[36:05] higher ethics
[36:08] let me be sure that this soaks in is all
[36:11] of the devil and will be destroyed at
[36:14] the coming of the lord jesus amen
[36:17] it'll be destroyed every bit of it there
[36:20] won't be one thing left
[36:22] oh
[36:23] friend across the nation as you're
[36:25] listening to me here in phoenix
[36:28] think of those things
[36:31] you are here subject to them
[36:34] now
[36:35] jesus said that they would deceive the
[36:37] elected if possible
[36:40] the first spirit was a first veil was a
[36:43] holy veil holy spirit
[36:48] and
[36:49] she wasn't supposed to look out of that
[36:51] but when satan began to talk to her
[36:53] about knowledge she just had to take a
[36:56] little peep at the world
[36:59] that's exactly what
[37:01] her daughter the church has done
[37:05] you have to see
[37:06] you have to dress like uh some movie
[37:09] star
[37:10] our young man has to act like uh elvis
[37:13] presley or or pat boone or or some of
[37:16] those people under the name of religion
[37:18] pat boone's the church of christ
[37:21] elvis presley's a pentecostal
[37:25] two
[37:26] demonized characters
[37:29] that stole the world in a worse chaos
[37:32] than judas is carrick did at the
[37:33] betraying of jesus christ
[37:36] they don't know him
[37:39] them boys don't know that
[37:41] nothing that i have against those
[37:43] those boys
[37:45] man
[37:46] it's the spirit that's motivating him
[37:49] just step over on that side one bit let
[37:52] that creeper just get one little hole
[37:53] around the shuck of that corn one time
[37:56] watch what takes place the corn is gone
[37:59] oh yeah done got it and that's the way
[38:01] it'll do it he'll do it every time
[38:04] eve had to take just one peep at the
[38:06] world and let me say something to you
[38:09] brother and sister
[38:10] in first john
[38:12] the second chapter in the 15th verse we
[38:14] can read if you wish to
[38:16] the bible says if we love the world are
[38:20] the things of the world it's because the
[38:23] love of god is not even in us
[38:30] now the word there is not earth
[38:32] if the greek word is cosmos which means
[38:35] the world's order
[38:36] if we love fashions of the earth
[38:40] the world
[38:41] if we love the trend of the day
[38:44] if we think this is a wonderful time or
[38:46] we have all these things if you think
[38:48] that it's because your thinking is wrong
[38:52] it is perverted by the devil
[38:56] or if you love the world's order
[39:00] and the things of this present world is
[39:02] because the love of god is not even in
[39:04] you
[39:07] remember that
[39:08] oh god look what we're looking into
[39:12] here i want to stop just a minute
[39:15] and tell you a little story
[39:17] i heard a chaplain from the first world
[39:19] war
[39:21] they throw um
[39:23] like satan at the beginning
[39:26] when he come into
[39:28] the garden of eden he could not dig up
[39:30] those seeds
[39:31] he could not destroy him
[39:34] but he sprayed them
[39:37] with poison
[39:39] and it deformed the seed it didn't bring
[39:42] forth its right kind it deformed the
[39:44] original seed
[39:46] and that's what all these programs of
[39:48] religion
[39:52] they are still sons and daughters of god
[39:54] but being deformed
[39:57] they go to church wanting to do right
[40:00] a nun never enters a nunnry to be a mean
[40:03] woman
[40:06] a minister never goes through school
[40:08] just to be a a bad man
[40:12] you never join church and shake hands
[40:14] put your name on the book or whatever
[40:16] you do
[40:17] in your church to be a bad person
[40:21] you do that to be a good person but it's
[40:24] the deception
[40:26] it's the deformity
[40:29] that does it satan sprayed it
[40:33] god
[40:34] never had an organization there's no
[40:36] such a thing anywhere found in the words
[40:38] of god
[40:40] god is our organization we're organizing
[40:43] him a body
[40:44] and god in heaven
[40:46] that's right our names are on the lamb's
[40:48] book of life
[40:50] notice
[40:51] but you see i know it's very hard but i
[40:55] want you to suffer just a little longer
[40:57] if you will
[40:59] in the time
[41:01] of the world's war excuse me for getting
[41:03] away from my subject
[41:05] but to make this point i i wanted to
[41:08] give you my analysis of what satan done
[41:10] in eden
[41:11] spring
[41:13] horrible
[41:15] poison
[41:17] spree
[41:19] would you like to know what this spray
[41:20] was
[41:21] i can tell you i got the farmer of it
[41:24] two words
[41:26] unbelief
[41:28] which is contrary to faith
[41:31] spread unbelief doubt and science
[41:35] filled its place
[41:37] where the cavities that went into the
[41:39] sea
[41:40] satan filled that cavity with knowledge
[41:43] and science and civilization
[41:45] and it's
[41:46] deformed the whole entire creation of
[41:50] god
[41:54] i know you think i'm getting you on a
[41:56] limb
[41:58] but i'm on the lamb with you
[42:00] and we're all here to try to find what
[42:03] we can do
[42:04] we don't say those things to be
[42:05] different
[42:06] we must be honest
[42:09] we each one come down to the end of the
[42:11] road where we're going to give account
[42:12] for every word right now we know that
[42:15] our voices when we are born a reversal
[42:17] of crime goes on a tape
[42:20] it's going to be played back against the
[42:21] day of judgment even the clothes you
[42:23] wear
[42:24] will be shown your face at the day of
[42:25] judgment
[42:27] even science has found that by
[42:28] television see television doesn't
[42:31] manufacture a picture
[42:32] it only channels it the color closed
[42:35] every time you move every thoughts in
[42:36] your mind is absolutely kept on god's
[42:39] record that big thing will be laid right
[42:41] before you every one of them filthy
[42:42] dresses you wore every time you went to
[42:44] the barber shop
[42:46] cut that hair that god gave you it's
[42:47] going to be your answer for you can't
[42:49] make a move right there it is even the
[42:51] thoughts of your heart while you're
[42:52] going to be played right before you
[42:54] how you go to escape
[42:56] how shall we escape if we neglect such a
[42:58] great salvation
[42:59] we're not going to escape every move and
[43:02] the thoughts of the heart is recorded
[43:04] right in another dimension even the
[43:06] color clothes you wear
[43:08] television color television proves that
[43:10] rhino pulls it out and shows it
[43:12] that's just
[43:14] one dimension from the three that we
[43:15] live in
[43:17] now
[43:17] [Music]
[43:19] how the poison has struck the church
[43:23] struck the earth
[43:24] satan's uh
[43:29] poison upon the seeds that put cavities
[43:32] in it and cause it to be deformed
[43:34] more and more he shanks deeper into the
[43:36] hearts of the churches in the hearts of
[43:38] the people and everything science
[43:40] science until it's become a place for
[43:43] the human race by being interbred
[43:49] i believe every seed should bring forth
[43:51] of its kind
[43:53] and the human race and the plant and all
[43:56] being in a bread
[43:59] has brought us to a place in eating our
[44:01] food from the earth which our bodies
[44:02] have made
[44:03] hybrid
[44:05] it's put our whole minds now if our
[44:08] bodies are falling it from 20 to 25
[44:10] years old because of degenerated cells
[44:13] the hybrid foods don't our brain cells
[44:16] degenerate isn't that cells also
[44:19] that's why ricky runs through the street
[44:21] near this hot rod
[44:23] while ricketta
[44:25] elvis and them as we call name
[44:29] out here half naked before the people
[44:32] mentally gone
[44:35] no more conceptions of decency immoral
[44:42] my little story
[44:44] this chaplain said
[44:46] you've been down in the hospital and
[44:47] said so many boys laying the temp
[44:51] some
[44:52] just come from the outside said he went
[44:54] out there and
[44:55] some officer told him the chaplain we
[44:57] want to ride out
[44:58] to take a look at the fields out there
[45:00] that throw this mustard and chlorine gas
[45:02] as they did in them days said i got out
[45:04] there brother brown said
[45:06] there wasn't a bark on a tree during the
[45:08] spring of grass it was only easter
[45:10] morning
[45:11] he said
[45:12] there's some old wrecked tanks down
[45:14] there the
[45:15] officer had to get record of them and
[45:17] see if there's anything to be done for
[45:18] them
[45:19] near the great argonne forest said
[45:22] when i was standing there by myself
[45:24] they looked up said oh god

[45:29] that's right
[45:31] it's all coming this all burn up no life
[45:33] no word on
[45:35] grass burn off the tree with that
[45:37] gases
[45:38] trees killed everything was killed
[45:40] twisted hanging down where bullets and
[45:41] things riddle it if that isn't a picture
[45:44] of the world today
[45:46] where satan spraying his unbelief
[45:50] his high breeding his science his
[45:51] knowledge
[45:53] until
[45:54] what it was
[45:57] at the beginning when god put adam and
[45:59] eve in the garden that beautiful
[46:01] paradise without death without sickness
[46:04] without sorrow and everything perfect in
[46:06] order
[46:07] look what satan's ddt has done
[46:10] she's a chaos
[46:13] earth nothing left in it
[46:16] he said i started crying i walked back i
[46:18] was attracted to a rock
[46:22] but i just went over there and looked at
[46:23] the rock pushed it over
[46:26] down beneath the rock was a little white
[46:29] flower growing
[46:30] the only living thing left
[46:36] because it'd been shellered by a rock
[46:40] god
[46:41] rama
[46:42] shelter us today oh god
[46:45] when these poisons are flying everywhere
[46:47] in the name of science and education
[46:51] shelter us
[46:52] keep me until that day oh god
[47:01] now
[47:04] i hope that we're each one or under that
[47:06] rock
[47:06] christ
[47:09] i just preached the other day many of
[47:11] you heard it
[47:14] was going down through the woods hunting
[47:17] and i was attracted to turn around
[47:20] and i looked nearly to empty
[47:23] cigarette carton or package or what you
[47:26] call it
[47:27] and
[47:29] it's the company i don't feel i should
[47:32] call their name
[47:33] but the tobacco company had they have a
[47:36] slogan a thinking men's filter
[47:40] a smoking man's taste
[47:43] i started walking on down a little
[47:45] further in woods and something attract
[47:46] me go back to that cigarette pack
[47:49] well heavenly father i'm going down here
[47:51] to that tree where those squirrels was
[47:54] spoke into existence by you one morning
[47:57] why would you call me back because
[47:58] something said you got a sermon coming
[48:00] for sunday
[48:02] your text is wrong
[48:05] on a cigarette pack
[48:07] i went back and i began to think
[48:10] a thinking man's filter
[48:13] what a deception that is
[48:16] if a man was a thinking man he wouldn't
[48:18] smoke at all
[48:20] but you see people swallow that
[48:24] i believe it's two years ago when i was
[48:26] in one of the conventions i went up to
[48:28] the world's fair when it's on the west
[48:30] coast
[48:31] and they had
[48:32] yule brenner's picture and many of them
[48:34] there and the scientists many of us in
[48:36] the same hall
[48:38] about the
[48:39] danger of smoking how they pull that
[48:41] smoke across a marble and tuck a little
[48:44] q-tip and tuck up the nicotine off there
[48:46] and put it on a rat's back put him in a
[48:47] cage in seven days he's full of cancer
[48:49] he couldn't even walk
[48:51] he said pulled it through water and said
[48:53] filter
[48:54] said filter there is no such a thing
[48:57] said now this is science himself
[49:00] they said you cannot have smoke unless
[49:02] you got tired
[49:04] power makes a smoke and the only thing
[49:07] it is is a gimmick
[49:09] to sell more cigarettes from that
[49:11] if i don't hope you think i'm
[49:13] sacrilegious or a fanatic that devil
[49:16] in a man that makes him smoke to kill
[49:18] himself
[49:20] when he he wants the nicotine of one
[49:23] cigarette that will supply his desire
[49:25] now the company comes out of this
[49:27] deceiving gamete
[49:29] and says a thinking mass filler you'll
[49:31] have to smoke four or five cigarettes to
[49:33] make a much tar in you to satisfy them
[49:35] as you did with the one
[49:38] american
[49:41] selling death to their brethren
[49:44] sisters
[49:50] i don't get it
[49:52] but yet in there i thought
[49:54] there is a thinking man's filter
[49:58] that's right
[49:59] now if a man was smoking remember it
[50:02] produces a smoking man's taste then if
[50:05] you cannot
[50:06] have us
[50:07] to feel the desire of a smoke until you
[50:10] get the smoke there it has to produce a
[50:12] taste so you smoke four cigarettes or
[50:15] five and pay more for it than you would
[50:17] just smoke one regular cigarette
[50:19] see it's a gimmick
[50:22] a sales gimmick
[50:24] deceiving the people
[50:26] americans
[50:29] when i think of valley forge
[50:32] george washington with two-thirds of his
[50:34] soldiers no shoes on their feet on that
[50:37] cold day
[50:38] to make us the economy we are in an
[50:41] american cell on merica and his brother
[50:44] and sister of death under a false
[50:46] gimmick
[50:47] for filthy lucra the root of all evil
[50:52] the crave of money
[50:54] love
[50:55] the whole thing's gone mad
[50:58] no not that this whole thing will perish
[51:06] but
[51:09] if you don't get no smoke you can't have
[51:11] the taste
[51:13] then i thought there is a thinking man's
[51:15] filter
[51:17] a thinking man's filter and i took my
[51:20] text
[51:21] from a thinking man's filter produces a
[51:23] holy man's faith
[51:26] so i thought that our denomination
[51:29] has done a whole lot like that
[51:31] take people in call themselves
[51:33] christians and
[51:35] just anyway
[51:37] why
[51:38] they get more in their denomination
[51:41] our organizations
[51:44] we get more in there because we let them
[51:45] come in under this that and the other
[51:47] anything i don't make any difference
[51:48] just so they put their name on the book
[51:50] and say they're christian that's all by
[51:52] faith you're saved you have to believe
[51:54] the devil does the same thing
[51:58] you've got to be born again and that
[52:00] comes through god's help
[52:02] now there is a thinking man's filter i'm
[52:06] holding it in my hand
[52:08] it won't produce a denominational taste
[52:10] but it'll certainly satisfy a holy man
[52:14] how could a bob-haired woman ever come
[52:16] through
[52:17] this filter
[52:23] how could a woman with shorts don't ever
[52:25] come through it
[52:26] are slacks
[52:28] and the bible says it's an abomination
[52:30] to god for a woman to put on a garment
[52:32] that even pertains to a man
[52:34] and how can a man
[52:36] that thinks anything of himself get out
[52:39] here and dress like a woman let his hair
[52:40] grow out like a woman down his eyes with
[52:43] bangs and twirled up like that
[52:49] he's wearing his wife's underneath
[52:51] clothes she's wearing his outer clothes
[52:55] a thinking man's filter
[52:59] a thinking man won't do that or a
[53:01] thinking woman won't do it right
[53:07] god's word won't let it pass through
[53:09] there isn't one thing can pass through
[53:10] that word that's the holy spirit
[53:13] and it brings the word into you and it
[53:15] produces a holy man's taste
[53:18] look at the day ricketta on the street
[53:21] lovely beautiful anatomy
[53:24] god gave to her
[53:27] and satan using it
[53:31] and she'll dress so immorally not
[53:33] knowing that a week from today she may
[53:35] be rotten in the grave
[53:38] coming down the street you're not long
[53:39] ago with preaching a convention in the
[53:41] assemblies of god over on the west coast
[53:44] in a meeting out to the southwestern
[53:45] bible school a little lady walking down
[53:48] the road with a little little clothes on
[53:49] bikinis there what you call it and
[53:51] branch hanging around the cowboy hat and
[53:53] boots
[53:54] i was going up the road
[53:56] i thought poor little feller
[54:00] some
[54:01] mother and dad's child
[54:04] was put here to be a daughter of god
[54:08] has become a bait trap of the devil
[54:11] i thought i believe i'll just turn
[54:13] around and go back and tell that kid she
[54:15] looked to be about age of my sarah there
[54:17] 17 years 16 years old or something
[54:21] i thought no i better not i'll just go
[54:23] up here on the road and pray for
[54:24] somebody seen you stop and talk to her
[54:26] i better not do it
[54:28] now
[54:30] and listen sons of god
[54:32] you get that same place
[54:34] these jezebels of the day play up to you
[54:37] but a faking man will think first
[54:42] she may be so pretty that maybe i can
[54:44] make a hit with her but it'll cost you
[54:46] your soul boy
[54:49] some of you girls to these ricky's
[54:53] thinking man's filter
[54:56] produces a holy man's face
[54:59] you married man
[55:00] when you see them women on the street
[55:02] like that you sons of god don't you
[55:04] realize what's taking place in the first
[55:05] beginning when science had made women so
[55:08] pretty in the andalusian world until the
[55:10] sons of god took daughters of man
[55:13] not daughters of god
[55:15] and god never did forgive it
[55:17] they destroyed the whole faith
[55:20] science really
[55:22] used to be you notice the beauty of
[55:24] women lifting in the last days is a sign
[55:26] of the end
[55:27] god's prudence
[55:30] so use a thinking man's filter
[55:33] you'll have a holy man's faith
[55:35] it'll cost you your home it'll cost you
[55:37] your position it'll cost you everything
[55:40] you've got besides that your soul
[55:42] it'll break up your home
[55:44] you may have another man raise your
[55:45] children
[55:47] another
[55:49] woman
[55:50] raise your children
[55:52] take a thinking man's filter
[55:54] it'll produce a holy woman's taste
[55:57] when she starts the barber shop or
[55:59] something you tell you go to have a
[56:00] headache
[56:01] take a thinking woman's filter
[56:04] but the bible's that thing
[56:06] and turn away from it
[56:09] don't you do it
[56:11] i'm your brother
[56:13] and i love you nothing i have against
[56:15] you god knows that's what makes me say
[56:18] the things i do is because of a love of
[56:20] god for you
[56:22] if a man go out there and they won't
[56:24] tell you another pastor let you sit
[56:25] around and act like that he don't love
[56:29] he you
[56:30] love you
[56:32] i wouldn't want that kind of love for
[56:34] the women
[56:36] i want to have a
[56:38] holy taste for my sister
[56:40] or really be my sister not somebody said
[56:43] somebody talked about being so pretty
[56:44] and how she is and a little sex queen
[56:46] she goes to my hunt
[56:49] or a lady
[56:52] oh lord keep me under the rock
[56:55] yes in ephesians 5 26 the only one way
[56:58] you can get through that rock that's
[57:00] washed by the waters of separation by
[57:03] the word
[57:04] that's right
[57:06] now
[57:08] don't let this devil spray you
[57:11] with his education
[57:13] no no
[57:14] it'll kill the influence of you
[57:18] don't let the devil take that well i
[57:20] belong to the church that my mother
[57:22] belonged to it my father my grandmother
[57:24] don't let the devil spray you with that
[57:26] the bible is already said on the seven
[57:28] church ages and things there it's all
[57:30] gone to seed
[57:32] right the whole thing is corrupt the
[57:34] whole thing is a putrified sower
[57:38] don't let him spray you say well it's
[57:40] higher ethics we're more educated we
[57:42] used to be in old days
[57:45] you let the devil put that over on you
[57:47] i've showed you his whole program is
[57:48] civilization education science
[57:51] he's got it right into the church and
[57:52] don't you listen to that
[57:54] keep your head on old dirty televisions
[57:56] and things
[57:59] our text says be not conformed
[58:03] but be transformed
[58:05] not go and say i was confirmed sunday
[58:09] no
[58:10] going to be transformed
[58:12] right now
[58:14] transform from what you are
[58:16] to what god wants you to be
[58:19] now
[58:20] it depends on what kind of seed that's
[58:22] in you if an intellectual educational
[58:25] seed has been placed in you there's only
[58:28] one thing it can do
[58:30] deform you that's all to a son or
[58:32] daughter of god the only thing you can
[58:34] do
[58:35] people of the day
[58:36] as i look out they act like
[58:40] they don't even believe there is a god
[58:44] pardon this expression if anybody
[58:46] feelings is hurt for this i don't mean
[58:47] it
[58:49] a couple sundays ago i was invited
[58:52] by my own daughter
[58:54] to come in
[58:56] to a television set and to watch a
[58:58] religious singing
[59:00] that sunday morning i want to hear oral
[59:03] roberts
[59:05] on his program i told him let me know i
[59:06] said you hear this this is a great hymn
[59:08] saying
[59:09] my son standing there told me about it
[59:13] two
[59:15] i'll turn that
[59:17] set we rent from a woman that has the
[59:20] television in her house i never intend
[59:22] to have one in my house
[59:24] no sir i want that thing in my house
[59:28] i'd blow it out with my shotgun
[59:31] nothing to do with that evil thing
[59:36] but
[59:40] let me tell you about your
[59:41] arizonans
[59:43] you've seen that analysis the other day
[59:45] of schools that yeah
[59:47] eighty percent of the children in
[59:49] arizona schools are suffering with
[59:51] mental deficiency
[59:52] 67 percent of them was by looking at
[59:55] television
[59:56] how about that
[59:58] you better use your shotgun
[1:00:01] [Music]
[1:00:05] now
[1:00:06] don't let the devil spray you then
[1:00:08] no sir
[1:00:11] now people as i said
[1:00:13] uh people act like they don't have to
[1:00:15] come to judgment
[1:00:18] these boys and girls that had some
[1:00:21] indian family and a whole lot of stuff i
[1:00:23] think a fellow named mr pool
[1:00:26] it was the head of it
[1:00:28] and if i ever seen a modern mockery
[1:00:33] of hymns it was way they handled it
[1:00:37] a bunch of ricky stand there shaking
[1:00:39] their hands up and down
[1:00:42] i certainly appreciate that young man
[1:00:44] here this morning and saying look decent
[1:00:45] like a real man
[1:00:47] i i like that when you your business man
[1:00:50] sometime here get a bunch of these
[1:00:51] ricky's that stand here hoop and holler
[1:00:53] and carry on and hold their breath to
[1:00:54] their blue in the face and
[1:00:56] that's not singing
[1:00:58] that's just making a lot of scientific
[1:01:00] noise
[1:01:02] singing his melody from the heart
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:07] i thought what a pity what a shame it is
[1:01:10] so
[1:01:11] how under the name of religion
[1:01:15] they act like
[1:01:17] there is no god
[1:01:20] someone
[1:01:21] said the other day to
[1:01:23] avoid goals of my daughter
[1:01:26] christian boys that
[1:01:28] give a smart remark about
[1:01:31] adam and eve said eve going through the
[1:01:34] garden said children
[1:01:36] you see a tree there so that's where
[1:01:38] your mother eat us out of house and home
[1:01:41] could you imagine
[1:01:44] supposed to be a staunch christian
[1:01:47] that would take a promise in a word of
[1:01:49] god and throw it
[1:01:55] they act like they don't have to come to
[1:01:56] judgment but god will bring every secret
[1:01:58] into judgment
[1:02:03] they act like there's no god i don't
[1:02:06] want to call him a fool because the
[1:02:08] bible said that fool uh not right jesus
[1:02:11] said this don't call old man a fool but
[1:02:12] in psalm 14 1 the fool said in his heart
[1:02:16] there is no god
[1:02:19] they're not i don't want to call them
[1:02:20] fools but they act like they are
[1:02:24] they act like it
[1:02:27] so
[1:02:27] you see where we're at today like there
[1:02:29] is no god i belong to church now all the
[1:02:31] whole thing the bible's a big joke our
[1:02:33] church knows where they're going yeah
[1:02:35] right straight to hell
[1:02:37] exactly right on the road right down to
[1:02:39] science and education theological
[1:02:41] seminaries and things just raise them
[1:02:43] right down the road
[1:02:45] the holy spirit doesn't have a chance to
[1:02:46] give a revelation or nothing the
[1:02:48] seminaries don't got to cut out
[1:02:50] the holy spirit to lead us not a
[1:02:52] seminary
[1:02:53] not bishops and overseers and so forth
[1:02:55] the holy ghost is our leader
[1:02:59] cain was such a person is that he was a
[1:03:03] very religious indeed
[1:03:06] now if religion is all
[1:03:07] that you have to have then
[1:03:09] god was unjust by condemning king
[1:03:11] because he was religious he's just as
[1:03:13] religious and sincere as abel was
[1:03:16] now remember he thought of god
[1:03:19] he worshipped god he had a church he
[1:03:22] built an altar he made a sacrifice he
[1:03:24] prayed he worshiped
[1:03:26] but he rejected
[1:03:28] no matter how esau was also
[1:03:30] in religion see that's satan's business
[1:03:33] not to kill the whole thing but just
[1:03:35] contaminate it
[1:03:37] that's all he ain't going to kill the
[1:03:38] whole thing oh not communist no no the
[1:03:41] antichrist is not communism
[1:03:43] the bible said it would deceive the
[1:03:44] elected if it was possible
[1:03:48] don't notice the iron curtain but the
[1:03:49] purple one
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:55] you can see how brother branham is
[1:03:57] trying to get the people to see the
[1:03:59] condition of the day
[1:04:01] and boy is he brave
[1:04:03] he's standing in the face of opposition
[1:04:05] with every kind of denomination facing
[1:04:07] him and he's calling it out amen because
[1:04:09] he had a commission to do he had
[1:04:11] something that he had to do and i
[1:04:13] respect the man for that
[1:04:15] he was rejected for it even there in the
[1:04:17] phoenix convention we know in brother
[1:04:19] perry green's testimony that the wives
[1:04:22] of some of the leadership there in the
[1:04:25] full gospel businessmen fellowship
[1:04:27] wanted them to stop inviting brother
[1:04:29] branham because the way he preached
[1:04:31] against women and preached against
[1:04:32] fashion
[1:04:33] and
[1:04:34] brother williams is the one who stood up
[1:04:36] for him
[1:04:37] and brother williams is the reason that
[1:04:39] he was there preaching that that day and
[1:04:40] brother williams got up if you remember
[1:04:42] last time in the beginning and he made
[1:04:44] the statement he says we'll always
[1:04:45] brother branham is always welcome here
[1:04:47] as long as i'm here
[1:04:49] because if it wasn't for him they would
[1:04:50] have kicked him out they didn't want to
[1:04:52] have that anymore and he knew that and
[1:04:54] still preached that that day
[1:04:57] i thank god for a man with a spine
[1:05:00] a man who will stand on his convictions
[1:05:02] and say what needs to be said and you
[1:05:03] can say he wasn't saying it hateful and
[1:05:05] he wasn't offended to the people he had
[1:05:07] nothing against them but he wanted them
[1:05:08] to see the condition
[1:05:10] he's so bad one of them have eyes to see
[1:05:13] and i thank god that we had a prophet
[1:05:14] who would tell the truth amen
[1:05:17] because who else is telling the truth
[1:05:21] amen let's go to our questions now
[1:05:25] uh question number one
[1:05:26] what was satan's purpose from eden if we
[1:05:29] go to look at paragraph 102 we'll begin
[1:05:32] here to look at this
[1:05:37] paragraph
[1:05:38] 10 let's start at 101.
[1:05:42] let's just read that for a minute in the
[1:05:43] book of isaiah let's begin the 14th
[1:05:46] chapter the 12th verse
[1:05:47] how art thou fallen from heaven o
[1:05:49] lucifer's son of the morning how art
[1:05:51] thou cast down to the ground which did
[1:05:53] weaken the nations this is isaiah seeing
[1:05:56] him in a vision seeing in the age to
[1:05:58] come for thou has said in thy heart i
[1:06:00] will send into heaven i will exalt my
[1:06:03] throne above the stars of god i will sit
[1:06:05] also upon the mount of the congregation
[1:06:08] the sides in the north satan's purpose
[1:06:11] from eden was to make his own self an
[1:06:14] eden
[1:06:15] and exalt himself above so the stars of
[1:06:18] god would worship him sons would worship
[1:06:20] him and he has absolutely carried it out
[1:06:23] now and when he's done this and brought
[1:06:25] it into the church
[1:06:27] so it we look we know from last time
[1:06:30] that satan's purpose his plan over the
[1:06:32] last six thousand years was to bring his
[1:06:34] own eden but what was the purpose of
[1:06:36] that eden what was satan's eating to do
[1:06:38] he says brother bam tells us here so
[1:06:40] that the stars of god would worship him
[1:06:43] sons would worship him he what he was
[1:06:45] trying to do was exalt himself over the
[1:06:48] sons of god so that the sons of god
[1:06:50] would worship him that's why he brought
[1:06:52] this this eden this scientific
[1:06:54] intellectual religion and brought it
[1:06:56] into the church amen so that the sons of
[1:06:59] god would worship him it was all his
[1:07:02] attempt to exalt himself over the word
[1:07:04] of god so he had to bring a deformity to
[1:07:06] the way god made his
[1:07:08] children and when the children were in
[1:07:10] line with the word they were unstoppable
[1:07:12] undefeatable and they were over satan
[1:07:16] but when he deformed them now he wants
[1:07:19] to rise above them and now they're
[1:07:21] worshipping him
[1:07:23] that's why brother bram tells us in
[1:07:24] another place in the message millions
[1:07:26] worshiping the devil and don't even know
[1:07:28] it
[1:07:30] they're doing it and what he said in
[1:07:31] churches
[1:07:33] and so that was the purpose for making
[1:07:35] this eden he's trying to divert worship
[1:07:38] away from god and exalt himself over the
[1:07:40] sons of god and receive the worship
[1:07:42] that's due to god and he's been
[1:07:44] extremely successful in doing that but
[1:07:47] god has sent a message to break his yoke
[1:07:49] to expose all of his trappings so now we
[1:07:52] don't have to worry about our worship
[1:07:53] being
[1:07:54] devoted to a false god or being directed
[1:07:57] misdirected if we come back to the word
[1:07:59] that's been given to us and stay in line
[1:08:01] with that word our worship is going back
[1:08:03] to god and satan by god's grace will be
[1:08:06] put under our feet
[1:08:08] no longer will be exalted over the sons
[1:08:10] of god but the sons of god by the word
[1:08:12] of god will go right back into their
[1:08:14] rightful position amen and immediately
[1:08:16] will put satan into his position
[1:08:19] amen so i thank god that god has sent a
[1:08:22] message to break that power of satan's
[1:08:24] eden
[1:08:26] the next question we had was what can
[1:08:28] quicken the word let's go to paragraph
[1:08:30] 112.
[1:08:35] paragraph 112.
[1:08:39] what can quicken the word god through a
[1:08:41] seed of his word there's only one thing
[1:08:43] that can quicken the word and that is
[1:08:45] the spirit
[1:08:47] for it is the life giver to the word and
[1:08:49] when the life in the word meets the life
[1:08:51] of the spirit it produces whatever the
[1:08:53] seed is
[1:08:55] amen what will make the seed of god's
[1:08:56] word that's plant in our hearts grow
[1:08:58] when the spirit moves over it it'll
[1:08:59] quicken it amen what about the seed that
[1:09:02] god planted into your soul when the
[1:09:03] spirit moves in it'll quicken it to life
[1:09:05] when the life and the spirit in the life
[1:09:07] in the word and the seed they come
[1:09:09] together it produces exactly what's in
[1:09:11] the seed whether it's the seed in you or
[1:09:14] the seed of the word the spirit will
[1:09:16] quicken it to life
[1:09:17] why it's the same life it's the same
[1:09:20] life in the spirit same life in the word
[1:09:23] and when those two come together it'll
[1:09:24] quicken amen whatever god purposed in
[1:09:26] that seed
[1:09:29] question number three how did satan
[1:09:30] deform the original seed let's look at
[1:09:32] paragraph 130. we're going to spend a
[1:09:35] little bit of time on this one
[1:09:37] how did satan deform the original seed
[1:09:40] paragraph 130
[1:09:42] on page 19
[1:09:45] like satan at the beginning when he come
[1:09:46] into the garden of eden he could not dig
[1:09:49] up those seeds he cannot destroy
[1:09:52] amen what god had created so because he
[1:09:55] cannot destroy it and he cannot create
[1:09:58] the only option he has is to prefer
[1:10:00] pervert and deform
[1:10:02] amen so
[1:10:04] so
[1:10:05] i mean if you think about that satan
[1:10:07] cannot stop the word of god
[1:10:10] so what does he try to do he tries to
[1:10:12] deform or pervert your understanding of
[1:10:15] the word of god
[1:10:16] so that you don't take all the word of
[1:10:18] god or you misunderstand it or
[1:10:19] misrepresent it or misquote it because
[1:10:22] he knows he can never overcome the pure
[1:10:24] word of god so he brings through through
[1:10:27] religion through uh churches through a
[1:10:30] theological understanding a
[1:10:32] misunderstanding or a misplacing or a
[1:10:34] misquoting of scripture amen and he
[1:10:36] strips us of the power that god has
[1:10:38] given us but when we come back to the
[1:10:40] pure word with the true interpretation
[1:10:42] of the word he cannot stand against that
[1:10:44] he cannot destroy it that's why he's
[1:10:46] always trying to pervert it
[1:10:48] it's important to understand
[1:10:51] it's important for us to understand
[1:10:54] he could not dig up those seeds he could
[1:10:56] not destroy them but he sprayed them
[1:10:58] with poison
[1:11:00] and it deformed the seed it didn't bring
[1:11:02] forth its right kind it deformed the
[1:11:04] original seed and that's what all these
[1:11:07] programs of religion they are still sons
[1:11:09] and daughters of god but it's being
[1:11:11] deformed they go to church wanting to do
[1:11:13] right a nun never enters a nunnery to be
[1:11:15] a mean woman a minister never goes
[1:11:17] through school just to be a bad man you
[1:11:19] never join church and shake hands to put
[1:11:21] your name on the book or whatever you do
[1:11:23] in your church to be a bad person you do
[1:11:25] that to be a good person but it's the
[1:11:27] deception it's the deformity that does
[1:11:29] it satan sprayed it and god never had an
[1:11:32] organization there is no such thing
[1:11:34] anywhere found in the words of god skip
[1:11:36] down to paragraph 134
[1:11:39] but to make this point i want to give
[1:11:41] you my analysis of what satan done in
[1:11:43] eden sprayed horrible poison spray
[1:11:47] would you like to know what that spray
[1:11:48] was i can tell you i got the formula in
[1:11:51] two words unbelief which is contrary to
[1:11:54] faith sprayed unbelief doubt and science
[1:11:57] filled its place where the cavity is
[1:11:59] that went into the seed satan filled
[1:12:01] that cavity with knowledge science
[1:12:04] civilization and has deformed the whole
[1:12:06] entire creation of god
[1:12:09] so what did he do what what was the
[1:12:10] poison he sprayed it with unbelief
[1:12:13] he got them to doubt the word and got
[1:12:15] them to move away from the word amen he
[1:12:17] sprayed it with unbelief and into the
[1:12:20] cavity that was formed when that that
[1:12:22] poison was sprayed in he filled it with
[1:12:24] knowledge science civilization and
[1:12:27] deformed the entire creation of god
[1:12:31] why because god's entire civilization
[1:12:34] was based upon faith in the garden of
[1:12:36] eden
[1:12:37] everything was based upon faith and now
[1:12:39] he brings in reasoning and when he began
[1:12:41] the reasoning and he got eve to reason
[1:12:43] about the word amen and through unbelief
[1:12:46] he sprayed the seed and brought a
[1:12:47] deformity through science intellect
[1:12:50] reasoning wisdom and all of these things
[1:12:52] amen when god's original intention was
[1:12:55] for his children just to believe
[1:12:57] a whole eden was based on faith god had
[1:13:00] to believe his own word in order he had
[1:13:02] to speak it and believe his own word for
[1:13:04] it to come to pass so the entire thing
[1:13:06] was based on faith and he wanted his
[1:13:08] children to operate by faith and as long
[1:13:10] as they operated by faith in the word
[1:13:12] everything was in harmony but as soon as
[1:13:14] satan moved them off of faith in the
[1:13:16] original word now deformity said in
[1:13:19] perversion by the poison spray of
[1:13:21] unbelief
[1:13:22] that's why in order for god to restore
[1:13:24] the woman back and to put him back in
[1:13:26] the garden of eden first he must bring
[1:13:28] the word back into the right line so
[1:13:30] that she can have faith again because
[1:13:31] the civilization we're going to he said
[1:13:33] is not a civilization of science
[1:13:36] he said you won't have your automobiles
[1:13:37] and airplanes in this next one that's to
[1:13:39] come it's a civilization of faith again
[1:13:42] people who believe the word of god are
[1:13:45] going to be set up in a civilization of
[1:13:46] faith once again
[1:13:48] not science
[1:13:50] but with faith they'll do more than
[1:13:52] science could anyhow
[1:13:55] science and scientific achievement and
[1:13:57] scientific understanding you know we
[1:13:59] always wonder what's what's wrong with
[1:14:01] science brother branham was the one who
[1:14:03] laid it out and goes all the way back to
[1:14:04] genesis chapter four to show that all
[1:14:06] those scientific discoveries city
[1:14:08] building and arts and crafts and all of
[1:14:10] this stuff came from from satan's line
[1:14:13] through cain
[1:14:14] and he goes to show us that to show us
[1:14:17] that that that science if we look at
[1:14:19] even science today and the things that
[1:14:20] it's done for us the whole field of
[1:14:23] science is to to remove your requirement
[1:14:27] or need for faith
[1:14:31] i mean you don't even have to take your
[1:14:33] hand and physically open a door anymore
[1:14:35] you just walk up and they move
[1:14:38] everything is is being taken care of for
[1:14:41] us amen so that there's no need there's
[1:14:44] no need for faith there's no need to
[1:14:46] believe all you need to do is understand
[1:14:48] science and the whole world is operating
[1:14:51] by science but god doesn't want us to
[1:14:53] operate that way he wants us to operate
[1:14:55] by faith
[1:14:57] praise god
[1:14:59] that's why he restored his word let's
[1:15:01] look here at paragraph 137 in the same
[1:15:04] subject
[1:15:05] now how the poison has struck the church
[1:15:08] struck the earth satan's poison upon the
[1:15:10] seeds has put cavities in it and caused
[1:15:13] it to be deformed more and more he sinks
[1:15:15] deeper into the hearts of the churches
[1:15:18] and into the hearts of the people
[1:15:19] everything science science until it's
[1:15:21] become a place where the human race by
[1:15:24] being interbred i believe every seed
[1:15:26] should be fourth of its kind
[1:15:28] in the human race and the plan
[1:15:31] all being interbred has brought us to a
[1:15:33] place in eating our food from the earth
[1:15:35] which our bodies has been has made
[1:15:38] hybrid it's putting our whole minds
[1:15:40] now if our bodies are falling from 20 to
[1:15:43] 25 years old because of degenerated
[1:15:45] cells by hybrid foods don't our brain
[1:15:48] cells degenerate
[1:15:50] brother branham is just
[1:15:52] it's amazing how a simple seventh grade
[1:15:54] education can pick out the obvious and
[1:15:56] the simple if all your sales are
[1:15:58] generating because of hybrid food and
[1:16:00] scientific achievement
[1:16:02] your brain operates by cells too doesn't
[1:16:04] it
[1:16:05] our brain cells degenerate isn't that
[1:16:07] cells also that's why ricky runs through
[1:16:10] the street here with his hot rod while
[1:16:12] raquetta elvidas and many of them as we
[1:16:14] would call name out here half naked
[1:16:17] before people mentally gone no more
[1:16:19] conceptions of decency or morals
[1:16:23] what has brought the human race to this
[1:16:26] science
[1:16:28] scientific achievement that would get
[1:16:30] more production out of a field by
[1:16:33] changing the seed
[1:16:35] could get more production could get more
[1:16:38] productivity out of you by giving you
[1:16:40] things to organize your tasks to the
[1:16:43] things to simplify your day
[1:16:46] computerized things gadgets and apps and
[1:16:48] all of these things what's it about
[1:16:50] getting more production out of the field
[1:16:51] getting more production out of human
[1:16:53] beings amen driving satan's eden further
[1:16:56] and further and further and what has it
[1:16:58] done it has degenerated the humans and
[1:17:00] degenerated brother branham says why
[1:17:03] does ricky run around in his hot rod
[1:17:05] because the food's been in her bread
[1:17:08] who else can make that connection that
[1:17:10] the mental illness that we're seeing on
[1:17:12] the level we're seeing it in this
[1:17:14] generation is tied right back to
[1:17:16] scientific achievement the deformity and
[1:17:19] degeneration of god's original plan for
[1:17:22] a seed to bring forth after its kind man
[1:17:24] has manipulated it and manipulated that
[1:17:26] he's beginning to destroy himself so
[1:17:28] that man is losing his mind
[1:17:33] and now we have silly debates going on
[1:17:35] in society on whether or not who a boy
[1:17:38] who thinks he's a girl can compete with
[1:17:40] the girls
[1:17:44] and some of us who had a renewal of our
[1:17:46] mind by the word of god are looking at
[1:17:48] that and saying what on earth are people
[1:17:51] thinking
[1:17:53] to where now
[1:17:54] you know there's laws that are being
[1:17:56] passed in countries and there's laws on
[1:17:58] the books that people are trying to pass
[1:18:00] that will forbid you as parents
[1:18:02] to name your child with a
[1:18:04] gender-specific name or use
[1:18:05] gender-specific pronouns until your
[1:18:08] child is old enough to know themselves
[1:18:10] whether they're a boy or girl
[1:18:13] and it can be considered child abuse for
[1:18:15] use used for you as a parent to use
[1:18:17] gender
[1:18:18] gender specific pronouns
[1:18:21] to label your children until they've had
[1:18:23] the opportunity themselves to determine
[1:18:25] whether they're a boy or girl or not
[1:18:28] my goodness this is what science has
[1:18:30] achieved
[1:18:32] this is what a scientific based
[1:18:34] civilization has come to
[1:18:37] and if you say anything about it that
[1:18:39] you're the one with problems you know
[1:18:40] you have hate speech and no love and
[1:18:42] you're ignorant and uneducated i'm
[1:18:45] saying i don't want your education
[1:18:47] if you can't even determine what's male
[1:18:49] and female i don't want your education
[1:18:51] it's not going to do me any good it
[1:18:53] doesn't work
[1:18:54] and so now you have you have now the
[1:18:57] women who wanted equal rights
[1:19:01] they wanted the the compete in a man's
[1:19:04] world and be treated equal with a man
[1:19:05] now they're screaming because men are
[1:19:08] now competing in their sports and
[1:19:09] they're losing all their medals
[1:19:12] i say you got what you wanted
[1:19:15] you're equal
[1:19:18] my goodness
[1:19:19] and only a prophet can tie that back to
[1:19:21] hybrid food
[1:19:23] scientific achievement this is what
[1:19:25] science has proved that's why friends we
[1:19:27] have to have a renewing of our minds
[1:19:29] because we're eating the same foods
[1:19:31] other people are eating that's why more
[1:19:33] than ever you should bow your head and
[1:19:34] pray before you stick that in your mouth
[1:19:37] because the same food that makes them
[1:19:39] not know whether they're male or female
[1:19:41] is the same food we have to eat but
[1:19:43] we're living by faith not off science
[1:19:45] and faith can overcome science
[1:19:47] [Music]
[1:19:49] amen and we wonder so many times why uh
[1:19:52] a mental illness is on the rise and
[1:19:54] depression is on the rise and all of
[1:19:56] these different things are on the rise
[1:19:58] it's because of what science has done
[1:20:00] amen the environment the chemicals the
[1:20:03] the hybridization the foods the the the
[1:20:06] even this visual stimulation from all
[1:20:08] the electronics and all the
[1:20:09] entertainment it is all corrupting
[1:20:12] humanity from what god intended it to be
[1:20:14] and that's why we as believers have to
[1:20:16] have a renewing of our minds
[1:20:19] we've got to continually be going back
[1:20:20] to that renewing of our mind by the word
[1:20:22] of god so that we don't fall trapped to
[1:20:24] the same thing
[1:20:27] amen
[1:20:28] so so god is going we're not going to
[1:20:31] have a civilization of science thank god
[1:20:38] praise be to god
[1:20:40] let's look at paragraph 140 again
[1:20:44] or next if that isn't a picture of the
[1:20:46] world today where satan is spraying his
[1:20:48] unbelief his hybriding his science his
[1:20:51] knowledge until what it was at the
[1:20:53] beginning when god put adam and eve in
[1:20:55] the garden that was beautiful paradise
[1:20:57] without death without sickness without
[1:20:59] sorrow and everything in perfect in
[1:21:01] order look what satan's ddt has done she
[1:21:05] is a chaos there is nothing left in it
[1:21:09] amen
[1:21:11] after reading this i mean i really
[1:21:13] earnestly pray over my food now more
[1:21:15] than ever
[1:21:16] now it's not a ritual for me now i need
[1:21:19] god to help me
[1:21:22] because everything there's death in the
[1:21:24] pot there's death in every pot
[1:21:26] there's death in every outlet death and
[1:21:28] every resource death in every product
[1:21:32] because it all comes by man not by god
[1:21:35] and now we need to have the renewing of
[1:21:37] our minds day by day
[1:21:40] question number four what is the true
[1:21:42] thinking man's filtering
[1:21:46] paragraph 153
[1:21:53] paragraph 153 at the top of page 23.
[1:21:56] then i thought there is a thinking man's
[1:21:58] filter a thinking man's filter and i
[1:22:00] took my text from a thinking man's
[1:22:02] filter produced a holy man's taste go
[1:22:04] down to paragraph 155
[1:22:07] you got to be born again and that comes
[1:22:09] through god's filter
[1:22:11] now there is a thinking man's filter i'm
[1:22:13] holding it in my hand
[1:22:15] it won't produce a denominational taste
[1:22:17] but it'll certainly satisfy a holy man's
[1:22:19] taste you know
[1:22:21] so what is a the true thinking man's
[1:22:23] filter it's the word of god it's the
[1:22:25] bible that he's holding in his hands
[1:22:27] how could a bob tear woman ever come
[1:22:29] through this filter how could a woman
[1:22:31] with shorts would ever come through it
[1:22:32] are slacks when the bible says it's an
[1:22:34] abomination to god for a woman to put on
[1:22:36] a garment that pertains to a man
[1:22:39] how
[1:22:40] and how can a man that thinks anything
[1:22:41] of himself get out there and dress like
[1:22:43] a woman let his hair grow out like a
[1:22:45] woman down in his eyes with bangs and
[1:22:47] throw it up like that he's wearing his
[1:22:49] wife's underneath clothes she is wearing
[1:22:50] his outer clothes a thinking man's
[1:22:52] filter a thinking man won't do that or a
[1:22:54] thinking woman won't do that god's word
[1:22:57] won't let it pass through
[1:22:59] there isn't one thing could pass through
[1:23:01] that word that's the holy spirit and it
[1:23:03] brings the word into you and it produces
[1:23:06] a holy man's taste
[1:23:08] praise be to god
[1:23:12] question number five
[1:23:14] what is satan's business let's go to
[1:23:17] page 26
[1:23:19] to paragraph 178
[1:23:22] towards the bottom
[1:23:25] paragraph 178
[1:23:27] cain was such a person as that he was
[1:23:29] very religious indeed
[1:23:31] now if religion is all that you have to
[1:23:33] have then god was unjust by condemning
[1:23:35] cain
[1:23:36] because he was religious he was just as
[1:23:38] religious and sincere as abel was
[1:23:41] now remember he thought of god he
[1:23:42] worshiped god he had a church he built
[1:23:45] an altar he made a sacrifice he prayed
[1:23:48] he worshiped but he was rejected no
[1:23:50] matter how esau was also see
[1:23:53] religion see that is satan's business
[1:23:57] oh that's good
[1:23:59] religion see that is satan's business
[1:24:01] not to kill the whole thing
[1:24:04] but just contaminate it
[1:24:06] that's all he ain't going to kill the
[1:24:08] whole thing oh not communist no no the
[1:24:11] antichrist is not communism the bible
[1:24:13] said it would deceive the elect if it
[1:24:14] was possible don't notice the iron
[1:24:16] curtain but the purple one
[1:24:19] the catholic one the false religion the
[1:24:21] church he says religion is satan's
[1:24:24] business he not to kill the whole thing
[1:24:27] now listen that we understand that and
[1:24:29] the great the great uh concept that's
[1:24:31] been brought to us of the fallacy of
[1:24:33] denominations and false religion under
[1:24:35] the purple curtain and the mother having
[1:24:37] daughters and all of that but listen the
[1:24:40] the the devil he'll get into and if he
[1:24:43] can make the message religious
[1:24:48] and not personal
[1:24:50] then hasn't he done the same thing
[1:24:53] if he can if he can make the message
[1:24:56] just a form of religion and we can have
[1:24:57] a religion for religious form of worship
[1:25:00] in the message but take away the
[1:25:02] individual connection between you and
[1:25:04] christ amen you individually connected
[1:25:07] to a living god having met jesus christ
[1:25:10] personally and haven't even personally
[1:25:11] revealed to you but can move into the
[1:25:14] realm whereby a religious order of
[1:25:16] believing the message and being in a
[1:25:18] message church now i'm okay hasn't he
[1:25:20] accomplished the same thing
[1:25:23] so we can always say we see it here and
[1:25:25] we see it there but the devil hasn't
[1:25:27] quit working just because we come into a
[1:25:28] message church and say i believe the
[1:25:30] prophet he's still trying the same old
[1:25:32] tactics he's always trying
[1:25:34] so we've got to be careful that the
[1:25:35] message never becomes religion for us or
[1:25:38] we never let it become religion for our
[1:25:39] children amen but it has the message is
[1:25:42] personal amen it's not group it's never
[1:25:45] group it never it never will be group
[1:25:47] the message is to the individual
[1:25:50] this revelation is to one person
[1:25:54] and you decide who that person is but
[1:25:56] i've already decided who it is for me
[1:25:59] so satan that's his business is religion
[1:26:03] he's not going to try to kill the whole
[1:26:05] thing
[1:26:06] but contaminate it
[1:26:08] that's why we have to stay with the
[1:26:10] prophet
[1:26:12] we have to stay with the tapes and stay
[1:26:13] with what the prophet said
[1:26:16] because maybe his
[1:26:17] his method now is not to destroy the
[1:26:20] whole thing but to contaminate it
[1:26:24] but if we stay with what the prophet
[1:26:25] said we stay true to the message as it
[1:26:28] was given to us and not take our own
[1:26:30] ideas and not run two three four steps
[1:26:33] beyond the prophet but stay with what
[1:26:35] god brought us the way god brought it to
[1:26:37] us amen it'll keep us from allowing this
[1:26:40] message to be contaminated
[1:26:42] because god brought it to us in purity
[1:26:45] amen
[1:26:46] he brought it to us it was a humble
[1:26:47] vessel sure but it was pure the word was
[1:26:50] pure that came
[1:26:51] and let's stay with that
[1:26:54] never stop reading the books never stop
[1:26:56] listening to the tapes it'll keep you
[1:26:58] from taking a contaminated message
[1:27:02] we each one have to we each one have to
[1:27:05] receive the pure word from god's method
[1:27:08] god's form
[1:27:09] and it'll keep us inoculate us from
[1:27:12] taking a contaminated form
[1:27:15] amen just that was it for the questions
[1:27:17] but just a couple points i would like to
[1:27:19] bring out before we close
[1:27:22] let's go to paragraph 109
[1:27:26] and we'll just do this quickly
[1:27:31] paragraph 109
[1:27:32] and i'm going to start in the middle of
[1:27:33] the paragraph up here at the top of page
[1:27:35] 17.
[1:27:36] it says it's all wrong not the people
[1:27:40] it's the program that's wrong
[1:27:42] and now what what's it done it's all
[1:27:44] headed up again and brought the whole
[1:27:45] entire world through a bunch of
[1:27:47] hybriding perversion of the original
[1:27:49] seed of god to another darkened chaos
[1:27:52] what's he taking us back to he's taking
[1:27:54] us back to genesis 1 2.
[1:27:56] now he says it now it'll be darkness
[1:28:00] upon the earth gross darkness upon the
[1:28:02] people now in the laodicean church age
[1:28:05] we've come back to genesis 1 2.
[1:28:08] religiously through the religious world
[1:28:10] amen through the minds of men have come
[1:28:12] back to genesis 1 2 darkness covered the
[1:28:16] face of the deep but verse look at
[1:28:19] paragraph 110 but i am so glad that god
[1:28:22] is mindfulness of again that he can
[1:28:24] still move upon the face of the
[1:28:26] condition he promised he would do it and
[1:28:29] call a little flock which would be his
[1:28:32] bride
[1:28:33] amen there's darkness of poop there's
[1:28:34] darkness on the earth gross darkness
[1:28:36] upon the people we've come back to a
[1:28:38] religious chaos
[1:28:41] but in that the spirit of god once again
[1:28:43] moved over the waters
[1:28:45] and what did he do for you and i he
[1:28:47] parted the waters and so we could see
[1:28:49] the light and the light come down and
[1:28:50] set everything in order to bring us back
[1:28:53] into an eaten condition
[1:28:55] thank god for the word
[1:28:58] amen let's look at paragraph 127 i want
[1:29:01] to highlight something that he said here
[1:29:06] paragraph 127 on page 19 and let me say
[1:29:10] something to you brother and sister in
[1:29:11] first john the second chapter and the
[1:29:13] 15th verse we can read it if you wish to
[1:29:15] the bible says if we love the world or
[1:29:17] the things of the world it's because the
[1:29:19] love of god is not even in us i want to
[1:29:22] i want to highlight what he said but i
[1:29:24] also want to do that so we have a
[1:29:25] greater understanding so now the word
[1:29:27] there is not earth
[1:29:29] it's
[1:29:30] it's a greek word is cosmos which means
[1:29:32] the world's order
[1:29:34] if we love
[1:29:36] if we love fashions of the earth
[1:29:38] the world if we love the trend of the
[1:29:41] day
[1:29:42] if we think this is a wonderful time oh
[1:29:45] we have all these things if you think
[1:29:47] that it's because your thinking is wrong
[1:29:49] it's perverted by the devil for if you
[1:29:51] love the world's order and the things of
[1:29:53] this present world it's because the love
[1:29:55] of god is not even in you
[1:29:58] because the love of god in you will have
[1:29:59] you long for a civilization based on
[1:30:02] faith
[1:30:03] now when i read this for two reasons one
[1:30:06] just to highlight what he said but also
[1:30:08] so that we understand that there is
[1:30:10] nothing wrong with loving god's creation
[1:30:14] so many of us you know you'll get out in
[1:30:16] nature you'll get out uh you'll see a
[1:30:18] mountain range you'll see a river you'll
[1:30:20] see a stream you'll see something god
[1:30:22] made and something in you comes alive
[1:30:24] when you say that that's not what he's
[1:30:25] talking about if you love the world it's
[1:30:27] not saying well i hate this old world i
[1:30:29] can't wait to leave this and then you
[1:30:31] know this creation still has god's
[1:30:32] fingerprint on it
[1:30:34] especially if you get out of
[1:30:36] civilization and get away from society
[1:30:38] and get separated from all those demon
[1:30:40] spirits and that scientific civilization
[1:30:42] and get back to more it's more in line
[1:30:45] with what he made amen you'll see it
[1:30:47] still has these markings of a great
[1:30:49] creator and you can love that all you
[1:30:51] want
[1:30:52] but it's this world order this world
[1:30:54] system if you love that the love of god
[1:30:57] is not even in you
[1:31:00] amen
[1:31:01] so many people love culture
[1:31:05] i don't love culture
[1:31:07] i love i want it the way god made it
[1:31:09] that's what i'm longing for to go back
[1:31:12] before it was cultured
[1:31:14] before it was civilized
[1:31:16] when it was ordered by faith in god's
[1:31:18] word
[1:31:19] that's what i longed to see
[1:31:23] let's finish with this paragraph 166.
[1:31:34] paragraph 166
[1:31:36] and our text says be not conformed
[1:31:39] but be transformed

[1:32:02] mind
