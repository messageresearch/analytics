[0:01] There's there's a he right here and
[0:03] there's a he right here.
[0:06] &gt;&gt; Now he that leth or restrains or hold
[0:09] backs the antichrist spirit, he will
[0:11] restrain it until he be taken out of the
[0:14] way. So the antichrist spirit is held
[0:17] back from unleashing on the earth. Amen.
[0:19] That this will when when when this that
[0:22] power that lets when he that leth with
[0:24] restrains and holds back is taken away.
[0:26] Amen. Then then what we'll see is a
[0:29] tribulation period break forth on the
[0:31] earth when the antichrist spirit bust
[0:32] out and the full power. But what's
[0:34] holding it back? He that restrains.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; There's a restraining force on the earth
[0:39] that's holding back the full power of
[0:41] the antichrist spirit. Amen. And holding
[0:43] open a door of redemption and holding
[0:45] open a door of mercy.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; But let's see what brother Benham said
[0:49] about this same scripture because he
[0:52] said, "For the mystery of iniquity doth
[0:54] already work." deceivers, you see,
[0:56] deceiving the people off into something.
[0:58] That's a spirit of iniquity. Only he,
[1:01] which is God, shall let or restrain
[1:05] until the church,
[1:08] &gt;&gt; the bride,
[1:09] &gt;&gt; be taken out of the way.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Who is the second? He early in his
[1:13] ministry, he says he, God. Amen. Shall
[1:16] restrain until he, the Holy Ghost, be
[1:18] taken out of the way. Absolutely. That's
[1:20] what it is. It's God. Amen. But where is
[1:23] the Holy Ghost?
[1:25] The Holy GHOST DWELLS IN GOD'S PEOPLE.
[1:27] It dwells in the bride of Christ. AMEN.
[1:29] AND WHEN THE BRIDE IS RAPTURED, AMEN.
[1:31] THE THE HOLY Ghost lifts. And the only
[1:33] place THAT THERE'S LIGHT ANYMORE, AMEN,
[1:35] is in Jerusalem, in Israel with the two
[1:38] witnesses that are bringing back the
[1:39] 144,000. Everywhere else goes INTO
[1:41] ABSOLUTE DARKNESS. WHY? BECAUSE YE ARE
[1:43] THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. YOU ARE THE
[1:45] SALT. AND WHEN HE TAKES YOU AWAY,
[1:47] THERE'S NO MORE LIGHT FOR THE GENTILES.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO MORE SALT. THERE'S NO MORE
[1:51] CONTACT. THERE'S NOTHING. AMEN. SO, WHAT
[1:53] ARE YOU HERE FOR? YOU'RE A BLESSING.
[1:56] AMEN. YOU'RE A LIGHT AND YOU'RE A SALT
[1:58] AND YOU YOUR PRESENCE, THE HOLY GHOST IN
[2:00] YOU IS HOLDING BACK THE FORCES OF
[2:02] DARKNESS AND KEEPING THE DOOR OPEN FOR
[2:04] MERCY JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; DON'T BEGRUDGE BEING HERE. DON'T HATE
[2:10] YOUR LIFE. DON'T WISH YOU COULD GET OUT
[2:11] OF HERE. LET'S HOPE THE RAPTURE COULD
[2:13] HAPPEN TOMORROW. IF I COULD STAY ONE
[2:15] MORE DAY AND ONE MORE person can receive
[2:17] a blessing AT WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. LET
[2:19] MY LIFE BE A BLESSING ACCORDING TO THE
[2:21] PROMISE OF ABRAHAM. AS LONG AS THERE'S
[2:23] ABRAHAM'S SEED ON THIS EARTH, THERE'S A
[2:25] BLESSING ON THIS EARTH.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN ABRAHAM'S SPIRITUAL SEED, THE
[2:31] GENTILES, LIFT OFF, HE TURNS BACK TO THE
[2:33] NATURAL SEED TO THE 144,000. AND THAT
[2:36] will be the only place of light
[2:38] &gt;&gt; and the only place of blessing.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; And it won't be anywhere else.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46] God told Abraham, "You'll be a
[2:49] blessing."
[2:51] If you're part of Abraham's seed, you're
[2:54] here to be a blessing. Be a blessing to
[2:57] your family. Be a blessing to your
[2:59] co-workers. Be a blessing to your to
[3:01] your neighbors. Be a blessing to
[3:02] everybody you can be a blessing to.
[3:05] Because if they bless me, they're
[3:07] blessed. So if I bless them, maybe they
[3:09] want to bless me. And if they bless me,
[3:10] they'll be blessed.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:13] If I can be a good neighbor and a good
[3:15] employee and a good family, if I can be
[3:17] whatever that I can be to them, I'm not
[3:20] here for darkness. I'm here for light.
[3:22] I'm here for preservation. I'm here for
[3:24] life. I'm here for contact with God.
