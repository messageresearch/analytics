thankful to be here and now Lord we sing your Praises because you're worthy to be praised it's our pleasure to sing of your goodness and your greatness and your mercy and your love all that you've

on your word as we submit ourselves to your word I pray God that you would come now in a special way and break the bread of life take this vessel under your control Lord and Minister by the means that you provided Lord and may you feed us your sheep as we wait on you God give us that nourishment we need for this stage of our journey we love you we turn our eyes to you Lord give our hearts to you and may may we receive that portion we have need of today today in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you while you're standing let's turn to First Peter First Peter chapter 2 uh while you're turning there I want to remind you that tomorrow night we'll pick back up in the church ages book Bible study here in the fellowship hall at 6:30 so it'll be good to get back into that also want to give you an update I forgot Sunday I was going to mention it but last Friday I I I went back to holes County to continue the Bible study there it was the first time I had been back I think in five weeks because of the trip to Australia but uh the day before I went uh brother um Ben Yoda you know Levi very well Levi's brother Ben who was baptized last time we had a Bible study heo his wife called to let me know his oldest daughter Maddie wanted to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so we baptized her at the beginning of the Bible study she's 13 years old and coming into that age of accountability and she was pricked in the heart and she wanted to be identified with Jesus Christ and so it was a real privilege to baptize her then at the end of the uh the Bible study there was a young man there that uh brother Arley had been witnessing to and he wanted to talk so we talked and he and his wife would like to be baptized in the name of the Lord so he's asked if I'd stop on my next trip over I'll go early and stop and talk to him and if all goes well then maybe we'll baptize two more by the grace of God so we appreciate your prayers God is certain certainly doing a stirring amen we thank God for that and we pray that that God continues to have his way in all of that and while we're standing let's turn to First Peter chapter 2 and let's read uh verse 25 1 Peter 2 and 25 for you were a sheep going astray but are now returned to the shepherd and Bishop of your soul souls and let's turn from there over to chapter 5 chapter 5 verse4 and when the chief Shepherd shall appear you shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away man God bless you as you're seated amen so I hope you all had an opportunity to see the eclipse I was I thought it was a bunch of hype and overrated but when it came to it it was pretty amazing I was pretty shocked when I looked up there I said wow this is this is what is exciting I don't know that I'd go to another country to see it but I thank God it went right over our heads it was really a blessing and so it's amazing it's amazing amen that's all we can say that God's creation is absolutely amazing the way he's orchestrated and timed everything is amazing and I I thankful for the privilege to see it plus it was a beautiful day it was just a great excuse to be outside all day so we thank God for that so anyways it was a it was a good time when we get into the scriptures we just looked at I wanted to highlight here that we have a Shepherd that's what I really want to highlight we have a shepherd and Bishop of our souls and he is the chief Shepherd amen so we know there's other Shepherds but we're looking today to the chief Shepherd that's the one that that we want to look at and if we take that thought and go to Psalms 23 together I want to I want to read this scripture and and give get our text out of here for this evening Psalms 23 and we'll begin right at verse one and read the entire Psalm Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointed my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen this is wonderful but it starts off this is where I want to take my text uh the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want so I just took that for a title tonight I shall not want and it's really uh amazing the way this came to me I was just uh I I actually wasn't sitting and meditating I was actually laying down to sleep and as I was sleeping this thought came and I just started dwelling on it and I woke up in the morning and it was still there and all of a sudden it just materialized right before me I just begin to understand this in in a very uh maybe a unique way maybe not to you but to me in a unique way and and when we look at this I shall not want that word want means to lack to be without be lacking or have a need so he's saying the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I shall not lack for anything and I shall not have a need why because I have a Shepherd I have the chief Shepherd is a good shepherd and he makes sure he provides for a sheep and so when I looked at that I realized for me this is something that needs to become a revelation that goes deeper in my heart because he says I shall not want not I may not want or I ought not to want but I shall not want and and I think we need to realize this as maybe a revelation and maybe a commandment also that that there's no way that I'm going to be lacking anything because I have a Shepherd I have a heavenly father I have a Shepherd I have a bridegroom I have a husband whatever title we look to him at the title speaks of provision he's a provider he's a savior he's a Healer he's a deliverer he's Jehovah Gyra he he's the one who sees the need and provides for the need and and the shepherd and we look at the Psalms it's the psalm of the shepherd the Good Shepherd uh the shepherd knows the needs of the sheep better than the Sheep all right the Sheep is a is a dumb animal it doesn't have the wit and intellect and intelligence of the shepherd and and and sheep I'm told I haven't raised them I don't know but I've told they're they're particularly stupid maybe that's why God chose them to represent us they're particularly bad at finding their own way particularly bad at leading themselves they're particularly bad at staying out of trouble I don't know if you find any consolation in that but I do cuz he's called me sheep so at least I match the description I mean at least the characteristics are there but it's the shepherd who's watching over the Sheep it's the shepherd who's providing security safety it's the shepherd who's making sure that the Sheep don't want don't lack don't have need and so I I need to come to this Revelation in my life because I I realize that so many times I I'm deceived and I'm taken down the road that I don't want to go because the devil trips me in believing that there's something I'm lacking when there's an impossibility for me to have lack amen you know when you think about this this is really just a simple subject I shall not want the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want it's so simple that you can teach it to the forign 5-year-old Sunday CL Sunday school class but the reality of letting this live in flesh is really really really complicated and deep it's like everything in the Bible once once God took the seals off of the book we began to see so much more than we ever seen before and sometimes the most Simple Things become the most profound the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want and he goes on to describe all the wonderful things he does he makes makes me lie down in Green Pastures mean he's not he's not he's bringing me to a place of rest but he's bringing me to a place of rest in the middle of abundance I'm in Green Pastures I'm not in dry scrub grass on Rocky ground in desert he he gives me rest in the midst of of a plentiful pastures he Le me beside Still Waters not dangerous torrents not currents not floods but still waters where I can I can I can quench my thirst easily this is the shepherd He restoreth my soul he leaded me in Paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will not fear I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over in no way is this there's no way in a description of lack or barely enough or in some ways barely getting by that's not the picture because we have a shepherd amen surely goodness this is a statement a declaration surely with this kind of shepherd with his the way he watches over his sheep and with all his attributes surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever so I love how he said surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever maybe goodness and mercy aren't necessarily what Leo deia considers goodness and mercy cuz he said surely goodness and mercy shall follow me oh so I can understand that Mercy is following me because if it wasn't for his Mercy following after me there would be no hope for me I need his Mercy but it's his goodness that's following after me surely goodness and mercy shall follow after me all the days of my life so his goodness may not be uh supplying all the pleasures of leoda but it's still his goodness is there and you'll have need you'll have lack for nothing and then I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever that has nothing to do with leoda or worldly pleasures or Earthly gain so when we look at this this concept I shall not want it's emphatic I shall not want it's impossible for it to to be any other way I shall not want so we take it as an emphatic statement the Lord because the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want because he's a good shepherd he's not going to fail in his job to provide all that we need but also if I could take that for myself from my own perspective as a revelation not just as the emphatic statement but on my side if I could receive it as a revelation the Lord is my shepherd I'm not going to lack Heart come to peace because you're never going to do without surely goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days of your life and you'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever you're not going to miss out on anything you're not going to lack anything you're not going to be without what you need in this journey to fulfill God's purpose because the Lord is my shepherd and that's the Revelation that that the Lord was dealing with me in my heart I need that because we get anxious we get nervous and we get worried and we get upset about things we get depressed and we we feel we feel like things aren't working out but that's impossible because the Lord is my shepherd amen it's impossible that it's not working out it's impossible that my life is falling apart it's impossible that that that that it's not going to come to a good it's impossible because the Lord is my shepherd so I'm not looking at the in Psalms 23 there's nothing mentioned about the attributes of the sheep this is not based on the attributes of the sheep this is based on the the the this is based on the ability of the shepherd this is the competency of the shepherd not the ability of the sheep cuz remember they're particularly stupid especially so amen almighty God let's go to Philippians 4:19 it's amazing how much Revelation how much reality can come out of a little phrase the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want and I've known it since I was a little kid Philippians 4:19 but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus I love that because it puts the emphasis in the right spot God shall supply all your needs according to his riches and Glory so what do you really need not so much the things that are on Earth but the things that come from Glory that's what we really need amen if we go to Second Peter turn together to Second p Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 I've read this scripture a couple times in the last few times we preached but I I I keep wanting to go back to it and highlight it and in 2 Peter 1:3 it says according as his divine power ha given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness his power has already given us all things that pertained to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that ha called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these the promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen this is the fa statement I want to pay some attention to the corruption that is in the world through lust you've heard me say this before but the corruption entered in how did the corruption come into the world through lust this word lust means desire craving longing and it can even be a desire for what is forbidden and that's a lust so so it's a it's a craving a longing a desire and also a desire for what's forbidden and when we go all the way back to Genesis in Genesis 3:6 when when the serpent now now is beginning to beguile he's beginning to entice the woman it it he he he begins to show her that there's more there's more that you can have and when you when you go back to the Garden of Eden and you realize the state that Adam and his wife were in they were that the Lord was their Shepherd and they didn't want they were in the beginning of Psalms 23 they he the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want that's where they were in the Garden of Eden they were laying in Green Pastures they were resting in Green Pastures they were they were led by The Still Waters they were Anointed with oil they they they everything was perfect they had no want they had no lack they had no need they didn't need anything amen and so in order for the devil to bring a deception amen he's got to all of a sudden begin to break the revelation of Eve about her Shepherd and begins to be put a wedge here between the shepherd supplying and Eve wanting because now she's going to desire something amen she's going to desire more than what God's given her and I'm telling you if we ever get to this place where we begin to desire more than what's given we're on Dangerous Ground that's the playground for The Devil because we we you know what we only need we only need what he supplies we should only want what he supplies if God would help us to tame this flesh of ours to where we can get to where I only desire what he's provided what has he provided all that you need everything it's provided ACC according to his riches and glory and so now now when he begins to entice her she she doesn't want for anything nothing there's not a thing there's not a thing in creation there is not a thing outside of creation that she needs she has no need she doesn't need anything God has provided everything and everything that God will provide is exactly as needed you got that so the enemy comes in and he starts to entice Her starts to show that there's more you can have something more you can be like Gods knowing good and evil and now all of a sudden she begins to desire something more than what God has given given so how did corruption enter the world through lust she had a longing for a craving brother Benham said she didn't mean to do that she didn't know but she wanted to know she didn't understand but she wanted to understand but God didn't want her to understand he just wanted her to obey God had provided everything for her and now as the serpent comes in and begins to offer her something you know what he's offering her he's offering her something ahead of schedule it's not that God won't won't give her everything she desires amen and not that God will not will will not provide everything she needs but he's going to do it according to his riches and Glory not according to her fleshly desire but according to his riches and Glory so now the Devil comes in and he starts to create a desire for something more than what God's offered that's right and it doesn't mean that it's not going to come later this is out of season out of kilter out of time amen because everything she needed he provided right and when she needed it he would provide it right yes God had promised yes sir God had promised yes sir that it was in the plan of God Amen that Adam was to reproduce himself is that right but God gave him a wife to reproduce himself right is that true amen God gave and so the whole purpose of God separating Adam and bringing him together was to reproduce himself so God God provided what Adam needed to reproduce himself because God provides everything that's needed but what they didn't yet have was the Revelation or their permission or something I don't I'm not going to I'm not going to venture without Authority I don't know something was preventing amen the reproduction of Adam whether it was a lack of Revelation understanding or permission however it works a amen there was a there was a limitation it wasn't God's time or season amen so now the Devil comes in and starts to entice her with an understanding giving her a desire for something that's outside the boundaries that God has placed amen there's a big debate sometimes and the debate is how would Pro procreation taken place because brother bam says you can take quotes and you can find where he says both ways like it would have been something super Supernatural or it would have been something very natural the way procreation is done today and brother bam says it emphatically both ways you can make you could come up with quotes and we can argue all day and people have asked me all the time do you think it was how do you think it would have happened and I used to get on that debate and I would read all the quotes I've read from the beginning to the end every quote that I could find on that subject I don't say every quote because there's some I may not have read but every one that I could find and read it and reread it and reread it and and as I'm reading through I got to figure out this is the way he would have done it it would have been by natural processes and then all of a sudden I read something else and I come over here and I thought no there's no way it would have never happened that way because that's not God's original plan according to what brother brandham said I hope I'm not making you nervous because I'm going to give you my conclusion my conclusion is it's a worthless argument and a complete waste of time because nothing was going to happen differently than it happened you talk about asking what would have happened with the plan of God was there really a would have as if God didn't know what was going to happen you can say well I've read enough quotes and I've determined in 65 he says this but there's 15 times more he says this than he says this and I've come to the it's an absolute waste of your energy is not worth talking about because these things there's nothing out of kilter with the program of God everything's ticking right on time everything happened the way it was supposed to happen you say then it was right no it was wrong what made it wrong because it was a wrong time or without I don't know what made it wrong but it was wrong the way it happened so there's no reason to to worry there's no reason to debate God knew what was going to happen before the foundation of the world oh the things I have wasted my life on trying to figure out things that you're never going to figure out you're never going to answer this question conclusively without some little other quote or question and there's there's something that I've come to terms with amen no matter how many quotes you find there's always another quote always why CU this is a walk of Faith so now we come we come back to to the subject that was a quite a Divergent I'm sorry but when it when I came to that conclusion I was so free am there's no reason to try to figure out what are you going to figure out you're trying to figure out what wasn't in God's mind praise God you can argue with me about it afterwards but I'm not I'm too tired to argue I give up I just say all things work together for good it's as it needs to be it's according to God's plan I don't know what else to say and then you I'll send you somewhere else to argue with other people who like to argue I don't have energy for it anymore so so whatever was going to happen in whatever way the devil was trying to create a desire in her for something that was outside the limitation God had placed so the limitation that God placed when God placed the limitation what it meant was she didn't need it right then that's what it meant she didn't need it right then she didn't need to know she didn't need to understand she didn't know but she wanted to know she didn't understand but she wanted to understand amen so there was no need for her to know at that time but the devil was trying to entice her and so corruption entered by her own lusts yes if she could have just kept herself out of it everything would have worked out perfect right but she had to enter herself into the equation amen let's go to James chapter 1 James chapter 1 James chap 1: 13 says let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed that word enticed is interesting I looked it up in the concordance and it means bait on a hook that's the actual description they write under it bait on a hook boy is that not a visual what's the bait on the hook your own lust your own desire your own craving is the bait on the hook amen but every man is tempted when he has drawn away of his own lust and deceived I'm sorry and enticed and when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death that's exactly the pattern we saw in Genesis chapter 3 in the Garden of Eden that's what we saw take place let's go over to John let's just turn a few books over to the Book of John 1 John chapter two 1 John chapter 2:1 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world for If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life amen those were the three things that tripped up uh the woman in the Garden of Eden tripped up Eve and she saw that the tree was pleasant to the eyes she saw that it was good for food and a tree to make one wise the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life and and that uh John is telling us that's all that's in the world that's the that's that's describing the world Amen it's your own lust it's a craving for something uh uh beyond what God has given amen and so that that then becomes dangerous that then becomes I should say wrong if I could say it that way I mean we used to think being wrong with smoking and drinking committing adultery and run running around and going to bars and and all those were wrong and stealing and cheating on your taxes but maybe wrong is is maybe it's different than what we thought altogether maybe really when we get down to the core of wrong core is anything I desire outside what God desires for me maybe that's what wrong is maybe wrong is so much closer than I ever dreamed wrong because I can I can not smoke and drink and run around and cheat on my taxes and do all that but still I'm lusting I'm Desiring to have my way I want and I need and I have to have and I'll work to go get something that I want and the question is what is God giving me because I have a shepherd I shall not want so what is all this craving and lusting and and and in the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life amen it it's the thing that's actually the world we say I I I'm I'm a believer I'm a Christian I'm not in the world I didn't go to the world well if you've got the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and pride of life you're in the world that is the world all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life amen maybe what I need to do is come back to being a sheep and recognizing that everything that I need the shepherd's provided oh God help us God help us amen we're we're going to have to grow up before we get out of here it's going to have to happen we're going to have to grow up and quit being children when Jesus was here amen he was the perfect man he was the last Adam he was the son another Son of God that had come amen without sex birth the first Adam came without sex birth amen so he wasn't part of the fall but yet he fell and so now there has to be another another Son of God that comes outside the failure of the Fall so that he could redeem back everything that Adam lost so here comes Jesus Christ now without sex birth so now he's not subject to the fall now he's here but he's got to go through the same testings that they were tested by in the Garden of Eden so now what does God do now when he receives the Holy Ghost he's led by the Holy Ghost out into the Wilderness to be tempted by the devil and what does the devil do he replicates the three great Temptations the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life let's read that in Matthew 4 let's go together over to Matthew chapter 4 remember before a Passover Lamb could be taken and used as a Passover Lamb which Jesus Christ was the Passover Lamb it had to be taken and put up for a while to be inspected to make sure there was no flaw in that there was no sickness there was no flaw there no de deformity it had to be a perfect lamb so Jesus before he could go to Calvary he has to First be tested he has to be put up and inspected to make sure he is the perfect Passover Lamb so now part of this inspection is taking place in Matthew chapter 4 and it says here Matthew 4:1 then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward hungered I want you to catch this brother BR points this out so good he said Jesus wasn't hungry in his fast because when God puts a fast on you you don't even hunger so he says now but after 40 days of no food now he's hungry and the question is how hungry do you think he was his body had been 40 days with no food amen so he fasted 40 days with nothing to eat while he was fasting he felt no hunger but now at the end of 40 days he hungered so then God removed the barrier amen now he felt everything the humans feel how hungry do you think he was I can tell you how hungry I'd be and it says he was afterward of hunger and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command the stones to be made bread but he answered said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God what is Jesus doing he's refusing to lust amen amen you know what he's saying I don't need bread all I need is the word of God his body signaling to him he needs food he's in a human body brother benam said he was completely man and completely God Amen he got tired and went to sleep he got hungry he got ate he thirsty he was completely manad and so now his body saying you need food you need food and the devil's tempting him Amen to turn stones into bread and he's saying I don't need food all I need is the word of God this is our example friends now let's go to let's go to verse five then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and Seth him on the Pinnacle of the temple and sayith and him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands shallal thou bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against the stone and Jesus said un them it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God he said I have nothing to prove and I don't need to prove anything in this body and I don't need to protect it I don't need to prove anything to you amen again the devil takeen him up into the exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will I give to thee if thou will fall down and worship me then saith Jesus unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him three Temptations all that's in the world lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life the three temptations that tempted Eve she saw that was good for food she Pleasant to the eyes one to make one wise Here Comes Jesus and the tempter comes and tempts him and you know what Jesus proves I don't need anything you offer everything I need comes from my heavenly father I don't need to prove anything I don't need to defend myself I don't need to convince you of anything I don't need to eat all I need is the word of God and all I need to stay with the word of God and God will supply all of my needs according to his riches and glory and if God hasn't given it I don't need it if he hasn't given it he hasn't commanded it he hasn't spoken it then I don't need it that's what Jesus was proving when he was when he was going when he was reversing when he was tested and proving that he was here to be the perfect land he had to stand the test of Eden but when he stood the test of Eden he couldn't stand what e he could stand what Eve could not stand Now Eve herself desired something and she can never subject her own fleshly desire her own need to know her own want she can never subject it to the word of God and say serpent I don't care how bad I would like to know what you're talking about how bad I would like to discover a furtherance of God's word how bad I would like to know what's behind the veil what's sealed behind the seal no matter how bad I would like to know know that God said and if God said and God didn't give then I don't need anything but what God said that's where he failed that's where Jesus succeeded but verse 11 is the one that Thrills my heart then the devil leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him do you think God didn't provide everything he needed remember in the midst of the Temptation where are you God why am I alone why God was watching the sun everything had to happen this has to take place because the lamb has to be tested he's got to be tested the same way if he can't overcome what he failed to overcome then he can't wash away with his blood the iniquity of that sin amen so now he's got to be tested the father can't withhold this test from him because it's part of his riches and glory amen right but God's not unmindful of where he's at God's not lost sight of his son he's not a bad Shepherd amen the shepherd knows that this needs to take place but as soon as he passes the test what does he do he sends the Angels down to minister unto him because he's a good shepherd he's a good father he's a good husband he knows and he sends just what Jesus need just when he he needed it praise be to God the devil trips us up with hopelessness with wondering where God is with thinking our trial will never end with believing that there's no way out and and then then starting to work on a pride of life or the lust of the flesh or trying to save ourselves or the lust of eyes try to provide a want and he starts working on that and we think that now we got to make something happen cuz nothing's happening if nothing's happening nothing needs to happen this is the point that I need to come to when nothing's happening nothing needs to happen why do I feel anxious that I got to move God's program along why do I think I've got to bump it into some progress what am I going to do I'm going through my own lust and my own desire to fulfill my own wants I'm going to ruin the whole program that God has for me and I'm going to bring suffering upon myself because if God didn't provide it and if God didn't allow it then I don't need it God help me to grow in this let's jump over to Matthew 6 while we're here in Matthew let's go to 6 chapter 6 verse 25 therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not life more than meat and the body than rment behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feated them are you not much better than they what a question which of You by taking thought can add one cubit to a stature and why take you thought for rment consider the lies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spend and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not AR raid like one of these wherefore have God so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you oh ye of little faith am therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what with shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the tomorrow for the tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof we all know that's true every one of us know that's true you knew the scripture before I read it you've all read it you've all heard it you all know it's true why in the world is this so hard for us I'll tell you why because of self our enemy is self Eve's enemy was herself our enemy is ourselves that's why it's so hard it's amazing I wrote down some questions just to ask myself what do you need what do I need then the next question was what has he failed to provide now when you ask the SWAT second question it helps answer the first question cuz I said what do you need you can think well I I'm my car needs upgraded it's not running very well and the furnace is acting up and the gutters hanging out the side and and uh I'm not feeling too well right now what do you need but then when you ask the question what has he failed to provide say oh I don't need anything because now I realize that my constant need and my whining and my complaining and feel like God's not providing and nothing's right for me and I don't ever get a break and and and it works for everybody else and it doesn't does work for me what I'm doing is I'm declaring that my shepherd's failing he's not doing a good job he's not very watchful he's not powerful and he doesn't know where I'm at he's lost sight of me I'm a sheep wandering around with no Shepherd and what what a terrible what a terrible way to characterize your great Shepherd the chief Shepherd the next question I wrote is there something I want that he he is not providing now we're all scared of death to answer Even in our minds we're trying to keep our minds blank I'm not thinking anything maybe it's a lust and not a need maybe it's a lust and a not a maybe we think we need it but maybe he knows we don't there is No Lack in his kingdom the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want for the Chad should we ask for Stuff of course ask ask that your joy might be full you have not because you ask not ask he's invited us to ask but when he asks let him answer and let him provide and let him tell us what we do and don't need ask remember when David and David took B Sheba in adultery and she became pregnant and she she had a son but as part of the punishment a part of the curse that he brought upon himself that first son was going to die and look at what David does David goes in fasting and supplication and prayer and he lays on the dirt before the Lord the entire time I think it was seven days or so that that child was sick he would take no food and he was constantly asking God would you please chave the child would you please save the child would you please save the child he wasn't listen he wasn't taking a a a a halfhazard attitude like well if God wants to save him he'll be saved if God doesn't want to save me he won't be saved no he was he was fervently praying he got down on his face he was desperate for God to save this child's life and and for seven days no food nothing he laid on his face and WPT before the Lord asking God to save this child but after the the whatever period of time it was when the child died the servants saw his distress and his fervency and his anguish and prayer they were scared to tell him that the child had passed away and so he could hear the whisperings around him and he assumed that he knew what was happening he got up and he asked them and they told him the child is dead and they were amazed because immediately he washed himself changed His Garment sat down and asked him to bring him something to eat what's wrong with this man this is what they're looking at what is wrong why why were you so heartbroken and so fervent and Desiring God to move and then when the child dies that's when we usually start mourning and start weep in and start begging and but David knew that God had just answered and David was content with the answer he got up and he washed himself yes anointed himself changed His Garment and got something to eat and he says God's answered now I can't he can't come to me but I can go to him he never lost sight of God and he never felt like God failed him God never failed him he knew that child was waiting over in glory for him and he would see him one day because David wasn't living for his own fleshly desires he hadn't lost sight that there's a God and there's a program of God he kept it all in perspective did he ask he asked should he have asked he should have asked somebody's got to ask somebody's got to intercede somebody's got to pray but when God has answered what do we do once God answers we say blessed be the name of the Lord the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord what else can we do insult his character make accusations I don't want to accuse my god of failing me he can't fail I don't want to accuse my god of not caring how can he not care he is love let's turn to Philippians together Philippians chapter 4 you see how such a little thought a little simple scripture we probably learned it as children if you went to church when you were a child it's so much more than we ever thought it's the problem it's the solution to the problem Philippians chapter 4 verse 6 be careful for nothing that means anxious or worried be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus he never said he's going to give you everything you ever asked for amen but if if you're not anxious for anything with with prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known to God the peace of God what will he guarantee to give you his peace and everything the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus which would you rather have everything you ever asked for or the peace of God which is going to carry us further in life every request we make or the peace of God if we can come the right way he's promised us peace Jesus came and never took the bait and never took his own way and never succumbed to the lust of the Flesh and God provided the angels to minister to him I believe God will provide angels to minister to us if we come the right way Philippians 4:10 let's go down a little further but I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again they sent him they sent him material Goods they sent him finances wherein you were also careful but you lacked opportunity not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in whatsoever State I am therewith to be content I love how the Apostle Paul says I'm so thankful that you were finally able to get some funds to me and not that you ever didn't want to but you didn't have opportunity but I'm not asking as though I wanted anything because I only want what God gives am amen I love this I speak in resp not that I speak in respect of one for I have learned in whatsoever State I am therewith to be content praise God I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound it means I I know how not to have any money and I know what it's like to have some money everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me there's another key there's another key how can I survive hunger how can I take lack when I don't have enough money amen that you the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want There Is No Lack so when there's not what I think enough funds to do what I need to do I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me he supplies the strength he supplies the peace that passes understanding he sends angels to minister God will get me through every trial there's things that we have to go through in life there's trials there's Temptations there's testings they're proving so that we can learn the grace of God you have to go through a trial to understand God's deliverance and God's power amen and we we have to go through these things and sometimes we have to go through them so that we can display Christ as somebody else who's watching our trial we have you're not going to bypass it it was predestinated before the foundation of the world and you're not going to pray it away but if you can make your request known with supplication and than Thanksgiving then he will give you peace that passes understanding and his strength he'll give you strength to Bear all things I know how to be full and I'm instructed to be hungry how to abound and how to suffer need I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me you know I've seen that written out I can do all things through Christ me all things all things all things and somehow the way it's used you think that you you you can speak you can speak things into existence and move them out he's saying I know how to do without and I know how to be hungry and I know how not to have all my physical needs met that's what that scripture is referring to we look at it one way because the Christian World uses it a way and they put it on signs and they make it look like it's one thing but the reality is the strength I need is the strength to suffer through when it's time for suffering when it's time for not having everything when it's time for a little little distress amen then I can do all things through his strength that strengthened me Christ that strengthens me that's the application of the scripture oh praise God let's go to 1 Timothy 6 1 Timothy 6 and verse 6 1 Timothy 66 but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and reignment let us be therewith content oh boy that's such an easy one to write on your refrigerator put it on a sticking note stick it on the refrigerator you know what that's a hard one to live that's a hard one to live you know you when you just think about life it's not always easy it's not always simple the Temptation in the wilderness wasn't easy our trials and and the things that we have that's ordained for us to go through it's not simple it's not easy but I can do all things things through Christ who strengthens me he can give me peace in my heart he can send angels to minister to me question is can we be content with what God allows in our life and the position God puts us in or do we lust to Envy do we desire something else or somebody else's position or somebody else's family somebody else's reward or somebody else's blessing or can we just be content and thankful for what God's given us and ask God to give us strength for the place that we're at whether you're single or you're married can you be content whether you're with child or without child whether you're widowed or a widower like this is really the question this is the reality we can stand up here and preach and get excited about we have a Shepherd but you have a Shepherd who decided that you will glorify him in widowhood are you willing to glorify him in widowhood are you going to complain and fuss and feel unfairly treated and you see but brother Chad You' never been there you know what it's like that's true but I know one who does know what everyone suffers with and I know one who can send ministering angels to minister to needs and I know one who's PR promised that he'll give you peace in your heart and one that's G promised to give you strength to endure every trial I think sometimes what causes us the most mental distress and pain is the avoidance of the trial and the resistance of the trial not the actual trial I think we get ourselves worked up and and we get ourselves anxious and and and it's always because why is this happening to me this isn't fair shouldn't be my lot in life why why why why why why and and listen it's okay there's times of distress when you cry out to God I understand that I've been there I'll probably be there tomorrow I don't understand what's going to happen to me next but the reality is there's got to be some Revelation that takes us a little bit higher so we stop in the grumbling and complaining and blaming God and we get to the place where he say God has given me everything I need and if there's something that I truly need how could he not give it to me if there I need it for the journey I need it for the next step I need it to move on in this program how could he not give it to me if it was part of his mind in his mind before the foundation of the world how can it not come to me amen we realize we we we we move away from the great Revelation that's been given to us in the opening of the seals and we fall back into spiritual Amnesia and start crying why God why did you let this happen why did that happen why am I going through this and why am I having to suffer as if he didn't know it ahead of time and as if he has no provision for the trial I mean when it comes down to it this is hard preaching simple thought hard life but I think our life would get so much easier if we K quit kicking against the Pricks yes cry out to God for everything we need cry out ask God lord would you provide would you give would you help would you deliver would you save me from this trial cry out but then have faith in God with whatever he answers and trust that he's a good shepherd and he knows what he's doing and he's not failing praise be to God let's go to James chapter 4 James chapter 4 and we're going to read verse one said from whence comes Wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your own lust that you wore in your members ye lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight in war yet you have not because you ask not you ask and receive not because you ask a miss that you may consume it upon your own lusts sometimes we don't get everything we ask for question sometimes is what's the motive behind the asking what are we asking that what are we asking for that for what's the reason behind the request and the message God's provided way he says therefore brother bim's praying he says therefore we weigh our out our prayer to see if we're going to ask anything aiss to see if we should be any wrong if there would be any wrong objective to our coming here or asking or the motive we would have in asking for such a thing so we pray God that you search our hearts brother saying search me and show me the motive behind my request why do I feel like I have to have this so bad why do I need this house why do I need this job why do I need this relationship why do I need this promotion why do I need it so bad do I need it so I can take better care of my family because of the needs in my family that's a righteous request do I need it because that promotion will make me feel good about myself and I'll be over all my colleagues and I'll finally be rewarded for all my hard work and I'll look good and I'll have a title we ask and we receive not because we ask a miss that we might consume of Our Own own lust brother bam actually said it this way in 1965 the message I have heard but now I see you have to have a reason for this God don't give you those things just because you ask and you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that to be in the will of God see if you want to be well what do you want to be well for see if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling God what do you want to do with your life when you get healed there's got you've got to have a motive and an objective and they have to be right according to the will of God and then when the faith is revealed to you and God by his Sovereign Grace places that faith in there then it's over you say God I got to be healed because I got a football game Friday night and I'm the start running back and it's the playoffs and is that really the thing you need the most is that really what God's providing for you or is it Lord I need to be healed because I got a wife and I got children and I got to go back to work and I'm not going to get a paycheck and I trust you to provide anyways but if you'll heal me I'll go right back to the job you gave me to provide as a father for my children because you called me to this oh you talk about being able to have faith in your prayer because you're in your position you're where God placed you amen and it's not just so you can have something nicer it's so that you can do what God's called you to do praise God it's amazing how we go through trials we go through different things and and there's always there's always things that there's always times of lack but there's also times of abounding it's not all lack sometimes God will bring us to lack amen so that we can learn a lesson so that he can show himself a provider there's all kinds of reasons for all the things that happen to us I there's no way in the world I could sit here and declare to you the VAR the variability or the variables and why God would allow things to happen but but the reality is there's sometimes that God for no apparent reason whatsoever just pours out a blessing on you just cuz he wants to and he gives you extra funds to do something he gives you money for a vacation and money to go do something enjoyable God's not against all of that the problem is when we want it so bad and he hasn't provided and it's the only thing we can think about and we need it more than anything else that's where we start to get into trouble but when God has poured abundantly and given you the means and given you desire and it's nothing against the word you don't have to be afraid of those things you can be a happy being a child of God and having a heavenly father who loves you and will shower more on you than you even need don't be afraid of those things that's the blessings of God Amen we should never shy away from that and we should always thank God for that but the problem is when we got to have this so bad it's the only thing I can think about and I'm trying to think of another way to get it and I just I really want what God wants for me that's what I really want in my heart I I want to subject this body to what God wants for me remember when brother brandham said he come and he was talking about tension this nervous tension I've had it all my life and I wondered why he said then I began to think this tension is a blessing this tension is a blessing you know that blessing took him off the field and a nervous breakdown that blessing caused him a sour stomach to where he couldn't even eat regular food for weeks at a time but you know what he saw he saw it as a blessing he said it where would I be without this tension it's this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ brother Brandon was thanking God for his nervous condition and his tension praise God I'm going to have to go up a few grade levels sometimes I feel like I'm I'm Junior High sometimes I feel like kindergarten and today is one of those kindergarten kind of days let's look at Second Corinthians chapter 12 2 Corinthians chapter 12 Paul the Apostle says in 2 Corinthians 12:7 and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted of a measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me I believe Paul brother Paul the Apostle Paul was in Earnest prayer I think he really wanted this thing to go away yes and he probably saw that it needed to go away to give him the freedom and Ministry that he needed I'm sure in all his prayers he was imploring God and asking God and probably had good reasons for why he needed to be free from this condition but God's answer was verse n and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me you know what I love about the Lord when the Lord doesn't answer a prayer request he doesn't say good luck I hope it works out I can't give you that you know what he says my grace is sufficient for thee it's almost like with the no comes a me measure of Grace to carry us through the consequences of the no he never abandons us he never leaves us on he is always a good shepherd even in know even know he's a good shepherd and supplies all I need I shall not want When God says no you have to walk this path of this trial and right with it he gives me peace in my heart and Grace that's sufficient for the trial I didn't have to come up with it I didn't have to have the strength I didn't have to pull up my big boy boots and just chug through I couldn't chug through I couldn't make it amen but my shepherd has provided an extra measure of Grace for the trial that he sees fit in his Good Will to let come to pass in my life he provides There Is No Lack even in the no he sends peace in your heart ministering angels and Grace that is sufficient for us what a beautiful Shepherd we have what a beautiful savior you know what I think one of the biggest problems in my life is when God gives me Grace to endure the trial and I don't want the grace I want what I wanted God help me when God has given a peace in my heart and and an ability to carry through with the trial but I don't want that because I don't want this trial and I don't want to suffer and I don't want to wait and I don't want any of this and he supplied a Grace that'll carry me right through a peace in my heart that'll Carry Me Through then the problem is there's a lust in my flesh that I don't want to go this way and I don't want to submit to the will of the Lord and I still want what I want and then what am I doing what am I doing with this precious Grace he didn't have to give that you understand he didn't have to provide he didn't have to put peace in the heart he didn't have to give Supernatural strength he didn't have to do that and how dare me reject the gift of Grace because I still wanted to have it my way amen he's going to have a bride he's going to have a bride and she's going to say I'm a little scared I don't really want this this is this is hard on my flesh but I know though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall not fear because thou art with me I'm not alone even in my trial there's a Shepherd here and I shall not want amen even in the shallow shadow of death even in the midst of a trial I will have no lack because I have a great Shepherd amen praise God brother bam says in the message is your life worthy of the Gospel he's talking about his daughter Sharon rose dying right before his eyes he said said the hardest trial of my life was when he prayed to God for her healing and it was like the sky was brass it was like God pulled down a black sheet and wouldn't hear his prayer God was refusing to answer his prayer this is what he says he said then I thought what who am I anyhow who am I to question his majest y he's talking about the death of his baby girl 18month old the one who would coup and laugh and squeal when he came home from work who am I to question his majesty who am I to question the Creator that give me my very life here on Earth where did I get that baby who give it to me it's not mine anyhow he just loaned her to me for a while I said Satan get away from me yes I went over I laid my hand on the baby I said God bless you sweetheart listen to to us this is a story to him that was no story like it it it kills us to say it what do you think it was like to live it Satan get away from me I went over laid my hand on the baby I said God bless you sweetheart in a minute daddy will take you down and put you on mommy's arms the angels will pack your little soul away and I'll meet you in that morning I said Lord you give her to me you're taking her away though you slay me like job said I love you and I believe you if you send me to hell I'll love you anyhow I can't get away from that said there you are you know what I think he had I think he had Grace that was sufficient for the trial did it take him to the edge of himself yeah it took him Beyond himself it took him Beyond his strength Beyond his ability to cope beyond beyond grief he went beyond grief and he wept and he and he tried to commit suicide but when he tried to commit suicide who kept him alive when he tried to pull the trigger who froze the trigger yes sir the one who allowed the trial was the one who was so close he wouldn't let the trigger pull where was the shepherd He was there all along when he took his glove off and tried to touch the high voltage wire to kill himself amen who was standing right there who was up on the pole who grabbed him and pulled him off and laid him down in the grass cuz brother Bram said the next thing I know I was sitting on the ground and I don't know how I got there who was that that was a Shepherd I have a shepherd I shall not want when in the worst time of his life when he couldn't go on when it was beyond grief when it was beyond a man's ability to grief he had lost a wife he had lost a baby girl amen but I say his grace is sufficient I say he sends ministering angels I say he's a Good Shepherd in the midst of the worst day of our life I shall not want there was never a lack in the prophet's life he never went without for one minute did he grieve yes was he heartbroken yes did he cry yes did he pray did he want to give it all in did he want to commit suicide all of those things are yes but through the midst of it all there was a Shepherd providing every need he had when it got too far when he couldn't go anymore and he tried to kill himself he stopped it when he tried again he stopped it when he got to the place where he was breaking down inside and there was absolutely nowhere else to go you know what he did he let him see his wife and his baby in heaven in a dream tell me we don't have a good shepherd tell me that was bad that was wrong there was something wrong with that trial there was nothing wrong with that trial he was in control all along when he was breaking up inside in a dream he was walking down the street whistling a tune will the Wagon Wheel be broken he comes to a little gate and at the little gate there's a beautiful young woman standing there she says Daddy he had no idea who that was he said what daddy why you calling me dad they were almost the same age you realize this he was a young man in his early 20s and she was about 18 19 years old and she goes in Earth I was your little Sharon Rose what's God doing he's supplying his need he's comforting he's giving Grace he's being a good shepherd we think a good shepherd won't let that happen no that's not a good shepherd cuz sometimes the Good Shepherd needs to knows you've got to walk through the valley of Shadow to death to get to greener pastures sometimes you got to transition you got to move from here to there and it's going to be scary to move from here to there but once you get there there's going to be more nutrition and better grass for a better life and you're going to grow better but you got to go through this Valley of the shadow of death but in the Valley of the shadow of death he never left us alone remember the poem of footprints person walking along the sand and walking with the Lord and they noticed two sets of footprints and they look back and there was a period of time that there was only one set of footprints not two and the person who asked the Lord they they said Lord what that was the hardest time of my life why did you leave me alone this is our perspective as dumb sheep why did you leave me alone and the Lord said I never left you alone that's where I carried you that's why you see one set of footprints he's a good shepherd and because he's a good shepherd I shall not want and heartbreak and despair he's still providing job said though you slay me yet will I trust him can we get to the place where we can say the same thing though he slay me yet will I trust him we're going to have to cuz brother remember said this bride will come face to face with the same Temptation like in the garden what is that going to be brother Chad believing in some strange Doctrine in the message and and maybe that Temptation will be giving up ourselves and dying completely to the word maybe to be closer than we think maybe it'll not be some fancy Doctrine and some some maybe it'll be self-preservation maybe it'll be a lust a want for something more than what God the boundaries that God's put us in that's right maybe it's good if we learn to trust the shepherd now brother B goes on to saying Christ is revealed in his own word from 65 this is an amazing statement says I've been this week down in a country staying with some dear friends I asked some of them at the table yesterday when we was eating we always sat around just like a little study on the Bible we was talking about love and there was a certain person said to me he said I believe you're an antichrist if somebody said that to me I'd be like you're crazy you don't know I've done this and I believe this and I'd start defending myself don't look at me like that cuz you would too in your mind even say you start proving why you're not Antichrist listen what brother R said if that would be pleasing to my Lord that's what I want to be and we think we've reached maurity if that would be pleasing to my Lord that's what I want to be I want to be whatever he wants me to be I love him you know what I want to be whatever he wants me to be that's what I want I don't want hardship I don't I don't want trials I don't want despair I don't want any of these hard things that we thought I don't want any of them I don't want lack I don't want need I don't want to be like the Apostle Paul abounding and abasing I just want to bound I don't ever pray for a basing but what I really want there's something deeper inside than self there's something way down on inside says really what I want is I want to please him I don't know how sometimes I don't have the ability in myself I fail miserably but what I want is to serve him and I know if I could just learn to trust him that his grace will be sufficient for me I know that if I can just stop trying to save myself and just submit myself to him that he's a good shepherd and in the Valley of the shadow of death if he leads me there he'll be with me there if I get down on My Darkest Day he'll be just as close to me as he was to the prophet amen some 60 70 years ago he hasn't gone anywhere he's the same loving Shepherd and we're just his sheep you know he told Peter told Peter you're going to be crucified and Peter said okay so where's that at just you have to read the Bible and find it yourself Peter says in the in one of the books of Peter he says the Lord show me the time and my departure is at hand and he wasn't whining or complaining or begging for more time God had already given him his will and he had accepted it remember when the Apostle Paul it was time for his great trial to be imprisoned at Jerusalem and and held captive he was going to end up being held for years before he finally went to trial then when he finally got to trial they were going to kill him and a prisoner for years and as he was moving into that along every every city he went and every place that he went there were prophets rising up prophesying that when you get to Jerusalem you'll be bound and you'll be in prison and then the Prophet come along one day and he he was in a place and he come and he took his girdle and he bound his own hands and said this will happen to the man who owns this girdle and they all started weeping and they all started trying to convince the Apostle Paul not to go to Jerusalem and Paul says what mean you Breaking My Heart by this weeping he said I am ready to be in prison and even to die for Jesus Christ he knew what was happening and he went anyways it was prophesy and all the prophecies were true and mean he say why would God raise up prophets to tell him that wasn't that a warning didn't Paul make a mistake Paul didn't make any mistake he went exactly where God was leading him his Shepherd let him right to Jerusalem and all the prophets they were prophesying by the anointing of the spirit that you're going to be in prison when you get there but he says None of these things move me amen because God already showed him his will amen this was just another test in this city and another test in this city and another test in this city Paul had finally got to the place where all he wanted to do was God's will what God wanted him to do is what he wanted to do that's where Peter wound up at the end of his journey that's where Paul wound up at the end of his journey and that is where this bride is going to wind up in the end of her journey to where she only wants to do what the Lord does and God will supply the grace needed to do it it's not going to be our strength friends don't don't get a bit nervous and say how am I going to do that you're not going to do it it he's going to do it in you you know what you're going to do tell this flesh to be quiet and sit still we're going to obey the word where's your struggle your struggle is going to be Gethsemane everything else he supplies his strength for Gethsemane is where you wrestle your will and submit it to his will I say God help us to surrender let's read Psalms 37 together as we close Psalms 37 in verse four Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thy heart commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass I used to read the scripture differently than I read it now could I explain to you how I see it now Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give thee the desire of their heart what would the desire of your heart be if you delighted yourself in the Lord a new job and a better car and no if you delighted yourself in the Lord the desire of your heart would be the Lord and everything that pertains to him and everything he wants I used to think well if I say good things about God I can get anything I want go to church and it's not it's not the way this works Delight thyself in the Lord and He Shall give you the desires of your heart keep reading here Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of the heart commit thy way unto the Lord there you go commit your way whatever way you want me to go I've committed it to you Lord commit your way to the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass how could he not bring it to pass because I've trusted in him and I've committed my way to him it's a guarantee what am I doing I have to turn my heart to him and he's got to become the Delight of my heart and then I'll have whatever my heart wants amen and if I commit my way and trust in him then he'll bring it to pass absolutely it can't fail because I've turned my heart completely to him and committed my way completely to him and I've trusted completely in him and it will all work outall praise God this is another cuty sign that you can put on the wall somewhere and totally misunderstand but I thank God that he's given us a reality of his word not the cliche Christianity the surface level but he's taken the seal off of that and brought us down to the depths of reality where there's a gospel that works every day there is a word that works every day of your life your best day at works your worst day at works on Brothers brenham's best day when he was standing amen with thousands in an auditorium and he's calling out diseases and calling out sicknesses and winning a tremendous victory for the Lord amen that day God was there with him the day he was trying to shoot his shoot himself in the head God was there with him the day he tried to electrocute himself on a pole God was there with him amen when did he not have a Shepherd when he was high when he was low when every stage in between he had a great Shepherd the chief Shepherd was with him and he didn't want for nothing because everything he needed was supplied when he needed it everything we need is going to be supplied when we need it why because I have a real Shepherd and I am his sheep and I don't have to provide for myself I only have to do one thing is follow the shepherd and everything's going to work out but that Shepherd is leading you into the valley of shadow of death it's going to be okay he'll be with me how can a Good Shepherd lead in such a bad way how can a good General lead him amen out of Egypt right up against the wall and right up against the Red Sea I tell you why cuz he was a good shepherd God will lead us right up against the wall and against the Red Sea and why will he do it because he's a good shepherd you know there's times that we'll ask him for something and he'll say no and you know why he'll say no cuz he's a good shepherd I'm I'm not very old yet turned 47 this year but I look back on my life if God had given me everything I desired I would have destroyed myself and if you had given your children everything they desired they would have destroyed themselves yeah I'm glad I have a Shepherd who sometimes says yes and sometimes says no sometimes who even smacked me with his rod and it makes me love him more let's go to first Thessalonians 5 this is the last scripture we'll read together 1 Thessalonians five verse 16 says Rejoice ever more can you rejoice always Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks now this is going to be an exercise to see if we can actually do this in everything you say everything does that include bad things we got it in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks man God bless you let's Stand Together amen you know musicians if you'd come brother John if youd come when I was away I preached the message in Perth and uh if God ever inspires me to I'll preach it here but I started looking at the subject that everybody wants to be a bride nobody wants to be a wife everybody wants to have their day of Glory everybody wants to be the one who's accepted everybody wants to be the one whose name is on the invitation who buys the dress who picks out the flowers who picks out the songs who comes to the wedding who's the chosen of one man his own choice it's a wonderful place to be you play a honeymoon you go on a honeymoon and it's wonderful to be a bride but when you come back from the honeymoon and you come to church on Sunday and you go home Sunday night and you go to bed and you wake up Monday morning when his alarm goes off at 5:30 you've got to get up to get the coffee and get the bagel and and then you got to pack his tuna fish sandwich and put it in his lunch box and send him down the road everybody wants to be the bride but who wants to be a wife who wants to wash the socks and who wants to do the who wants to vacuum the cloes who wants to give their body to raise the babies who wants to get up in the middle of the ton night everybody wants to be a bride but who wants to be a wife you know when you take your wedding vows when you take your vows you say for better and For Worse you know the day you take your vow you never imagine a worse there's no such a thing for better for worse for richer and for poor in health and in sickness you know what you've done you signed up to go through the valley with this man or this woman you know God is here Christ is here as a bridegroom you know what he's doing he's marrying you and I everybody wants to be a bride but who wants to be a wife who's willing to take Jesus Christ for better and For Worse for richer and for poor Paul knew how to do it brother brandham did as well Peter did can we can we make a commitment we can take our vow for sickness and in health oh when we first came to Christ it was all going to be health and it was all going to be good and it was all going to be but then we realize I must make my commitment to him in sickness and in health richer and poor for better and For Worse praise God but you know what he's faithful I don't just want to be the bride but I want to move in this transition phase to be the wife of the Lamb cuz you know Book of Revelation says the Lamb's wife that means the lamb has a wife and I want to be his wife I want to trust him I want to put my trust in him and I you know what I don't I want get to where I only want what he wants and I'll want sure we'll want but I want that want to subject to his want so that it's always his want that rules over my want and then I'll know I'll be I'll be in that place where his grace is sufficient for me amen do can we sing that song think about his love think about his love it's number 775 let's think about this this s song and there's a part in a song where it breaks out and says he satisfies um question is does he satisfy your desire oh not the desire of the flesh not the desire of this Fallen creature that always wants for worldly things but for the inner man does he satisfy all your desire has he provided Grace has he given peace peace in your heart in the midst of the storm has he come on your worst day and comforted you has the dove of the Holy Spirit Come Along when you needed it more than anything has he showed up when you were about to break has he come and brought you comfort when you couldn't go another day farther did he come and Supply a Grace that took you another step oh if he did then he's worthy of Praise if he did he's a good shepherd if he did he's proving you shall not want why because the Lord is my shepherd and my husband my bridegroom my father my deliverer Jehovah Gyra he's all of that he's my god let's sing in this song Together think about his [Music] love oh think about his [Applause] goodness oh think think about his grace that brought us through for as high as the heavens above so great is the measure of Our Father's Love [Music] great is the measure of Our Father's Love and how could I forget his love oh how could I forget his [Music] Mercy he [Applause] satisfies oh he [Music] satisfi he [Music] satisfies my Des think about his love oh think about his [Music] goodness think about his Gra [Music] that brought us through for as high as the heavens above so great is the measure of Our Father's Love oh great is the measure of Our Father's Love even when I straight up his love has brought me out and found me he said [Music] his he satisfy he said [Music] my Des think about his love oh think about his goodness think about his grace that's brought us through for as high as the heavens above so great is the measure of our father love so great is the measure of our [Music] father's amen I'd like to sing that through again but when we come to sing this song we've got to turn our whole perspective Heavenly not Earthly he satisfies All My Desire not carnally not not the things this flesh is craving and Desiring but my desire in here he satisfies he's the only one that can satisfy the things of the world you chase after him and chase after him they leave you empty at the end you get a promotion then there's always another promotion there's a job there's always a better job there's there's there's a car 10 years from now you're going to need a better car like there's there's nothing that really satisfies we need to Delight in the Lord and then he'll give us the desire of our heart amen commit our ways to him trust in him and he'll bring it to pass you know so many times the devil wants us to look carnally he wants us to lose focus on what really matters we look at we get passed over in the workplace and we feel like we've been cheated and they work then we say they pulled politics and and they got the promotion and really I've got the most experience I no listen listen it's not politics it's the will of God for your life we got to stop thinking carnally did they use politics sure they Ed politics was it Dirty Deeds sure it was Dirty Deeds but if God predestinated you have that job how could the politics outdo God's [Music] will sometimes we feel left behind in life we feel like they got to finish college I didn't get to finish college nobody had helped me pay for it I had to go to the work first if you would have went to col you have probably wound up an unbeliever so God saved you I mean nothing's out of kilter friend you say you know they feel sorry for themselves because everybody else my age got to retire some retired early and look they're enjoying the retirement but I still have to work listen God knows that you can't handle [Music] retirement what whatever reason we just should say thank you God you know what I need you know what best you know exactly you made me and you got a plan for me and you know what I need I think I need to retire I think I need a new car I think I need a promotion I think I deserve this I think I need this degree but actually God you're the one who actually knows what I [Music] need because with you I shall not want you're not going to miss out friend you're not missing out on anything that's carnal and we all strug with it every one of us don't don't don't think that you're the only one you're one of everybody else that's in the room that struggles with the same thing everybody else got married and I'm still not married it's not fair How can there be not fair with God tell me how that's possible everybody else gets to have a family but I don't get to have a family amen it's not right how is there anything out of kilter with God how can he fail how can he not be a good shepherd how can he forget about us how can his plan for us be disrupted how can the things that he's predestinated not come to pass amen [Music] right the devil wants us to look around and become dissatisfied and begin to want for things that are outside the boundaries of what God's allowed for our life at some point we need to turn our vision heavenward and say I have a heavenly father who watches over me I've got a god who's my daddy and he knows what I need and he'll give me everything according to his riches and Glory I have a husband a bridegroom I I I have a provider I have a Shepherd I've got everything I need and if I need something else he'll provide that too I'll ask him and believe that he'll give it to me and if I ask believing I'll have it and if he says no I'll still believe it's right and it either come later or I don't need it but I'm not going to quit trusting in him let's take our eyes off of these carnal things and let's keep our eyes focused on our bridegroom because what's life a vapor a Mist soon it's over you're not we're not going to live here forever when you think about the the lifespan of a average human being it's over before you know it it's boom it's gone I was thinking the other day about something that God had done for me when when I had an appendix rupture inside of me and I didn't know what was happening I was laying in a in a a CT scan with my arms up over my head and they slid the tray back and I remember just saying God whatever path you want me to walk I'll walk I didn't know what he wanted but he supernaturally came on the scene and made sure I didn't need a surgery and delivered me from that and I started thinking when was that and I started doing some math and it was almost 20 years ago I said it's impossible that was almost 20 years ago where does another 20 years put me and 20 years after that it was like that who cares about the car and the house and the relationship and the promotion and the [Music] vacation when it really put it in perspective he is all I need Christ is the only thing I need and he'll never fail me he'll never fail to be the shepherd I shall not want oh I say it because the Bible says it but now I'm saying it by Revelation I shall not want Chad Lamb is not going to come to a place of want because he's going to supply all my needs according to his riches and Glory I'm not worried will I hit stressful times I'm sure but I shall not want let's sing this together but not sing it from any carnal perspective but let your soul sing it to God he satisfies my soul he is all my inward desire he's everything to me let's sing this song again think about his love oh think about his good think about his grace that's brought us through for as high as the heavens above so great is the measure of Our
