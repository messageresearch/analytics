[0:00] When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound
[0:03] and time shall be no more and the
[0:06] morning breaks eternal bright and
[0:10] fair. When the saved of earth shall
[0:13] gather over on the other and the roll is
[0:17] called up yonder, I'll be there.
[0:21] When the
[0:23] roll is called up
[0:25] yonder. When the
[0:28] roll is called up
[0:31] yonder. When the
[0:33] roll is called up
[0:37] yonder. When the roll is called up
[0:40] yonder. I'll be there once more. When
[0:44] the
[0:45] roll is called up yonder.
[0:49] When the
[0:50] roll is called up
[0:53] yonder. When the
[0:55] roll is called up
[1:00] yonder. When the roll is called up
[1:03] yonder, I'll be
[1:06] there. He wasn't looking at me.
[1:12] When he took me
[1:16] in, he wasn't looking at my
[1:21] heart that was black my sin.
[1:27] He was looking at the
[1:31] blood flowing rich and
[1:36] free. That preious
[1:40] blood that covers me once
[1:45] more. He was looking at
[1:50] me when he took me in.
[1:55] He wasn't looking at my
[1:59] heart that was black by
[2:04] sin. He was looking at the
[2:09] blood flowing rich and
[2:14] free that preious
[2:19] blood that covers me.
[2:25] I'm a new
[2:29] creation. I'm a brand new
[2:34] man. Old things are passed
[2:39] away. I've been born
[2:44] again. More than a
[2:49] coner. That's what I am.
[2:55] I'm a new
[2:59] creation. I'm a brand new
[3:04] man. Well, I'm a new
[3:09] creation. I'm a brand new
[3:14] man. All things are pass
[3:19] away. I've been born again.
[3:25] more than a
[3:30] coner. That's what I
[3:35] am. I'm a new
[3:40] creation. I'm a brand
[3:45] new. It's the rising of the sun.
[3:50] A new day has
[3:53] begun. Rays of mercy made us free from
[3:58] sin
[4:01] today. Oh, the joy that fills my
[4:05] soul. For the message is my
[4:10] all. Thank you, Jesus, for this day of
[4:14] liberty.
[4:18] They were
[4:20] hopeless, beaten and so
[4:25] weary, slaves waiting for the day of
[4:34] liberty, just to see the glorious
[4:38] sunrise from the highest mountain top.
[4:43] And this dawn will see their shackles
[4:47] falling
[4:50] off. It's the rising of the
[4:55] sun. A new day has
[4:59] begun. Rays of mercy made us free from
[5:03] sin today.
[5:08] Oh, the joy that fills my
[5:11] soul. For the message is my
[5:15] all. Thank you, Jesus, for this day of
[5:22] liberty. The grave is
[5:25] indeed. He's risen. What a day.
[5:31] Because I live, you shall live as well.
[5:36] He
[5:39] said, resurrected with Christ
[5:43] Jesus. Lift your hands toward the
[5:47] sky. Your reward is to be ever at his
[5:55] side. It's the rising of the
[5:59] sun. I can feel the quickening
[6:03] power. Amazing grace has rent the veil
[6:07] for us that
[6:12] day. Our redeemer and our
[6:16] guide. Soon he'll catch away his
[6:20] bride. Thank you Jesus for this day of
[6:25] victory. The grave is empty.
[6:28] The grave is
[6:30] empty. He's risen. What a
[6:36] day. Because I
[6:38] live, you shall live as well. He
[6:45] said, resurrected with Christ Jesus.
[6:50] Lift your hands toward the sky.
[6:54] Your reward is to be ever at his
[7:01] side. It's the rising of the
[7:05] sun. I can feel the quickening power.
[7:10] Amazing grace as we're in the veil for
[7:13] us that
[7:17] day. Our redeemer and our God. soon.
[7:22] He'll catch away his
[7:25] pride. Thank you, Jesus, for this day of
[7:30] victory. It's the
[7:33] rising. It's the rising of the
[7:38] sun. I can feel the quickening
[7:41] power. Amazing graces are in the veil
[7:46] for us that
[7:50] day. our redeemer and our
[7:54] guide. Soon he'll catch away his
[7:58] bride. Thank you Jesus for this day of
[8:03] victory. Just your voices
[8:06] now. It's the rising of the
[8:11] sun. I can feel the quicking
[8:15] power. Amazing graces are rent the veil
[8:19] for us that
[8:23] day. My redeemer and our
[8:27] guide. Soon he'll catch away his
[8:31] bride. Thank you Jesus for this day of
[8:37] victory. Thank you Jesus.
[8:40] Thank you Jesus for this day of
[8:50] victory in Christ
[8:53] alone. My hope is
[8:57] found. He is my light, my
[9:01] strength, my
[9:03] soul, my cornerstone.
[9:07] this solid
[9:10] ground firm through the fiercest
[9:14] drought and
[9:16] storm. What heights of
[9:19] love, what depths of
[9:22] peace, when fears are
[9:25] still with striving cease.
[9:30] My
[9:32] comfort, my home in it
[9:36] all. Here in the love of
[9:39] Christ, I
[9:45] say in Christ the
[9:48] Lord who took on
[9:51] flesh, fullness of God in heaven.
[9:56] This
[9:57] faith, this gift of
[10:00] love and
[10:04] righteousness scorned by the ones he
[10:07] came to save.
[10:11] held on the
[10:13] cross as Jesus
[10:16] died. The wrath of
[10:19] God was
[10:23] satisfied for every
[10:25] sin on him was
[10:29] laid. Here in the death of
[10:33] Christ
[10:38] I there in the
[10:41] ground his body
[10:44] laid the light of the world my darkness
[10:51] lay then bursting
[10:54] forth in glorious
[10:57] day up from the grave. He
[11:01] rose
[11:03] again. And as he
[11:06] stands in
[11:09] victory, sin's curse has
[11:12] lost its grip on
[11:16] me. For I am
[11:19] his and he is
[11:22] mine. Bought with the precious
[11:26] blood of Christ.
[11:32] No guilt in
[11:34] life, no fear in
[11:38] death. This is the power of
[11:41] Christ in
[11:44] me. From life's first
[11:47] cross to final
[11:50] breath. Jesus commands my destiny.
[11:57] No power of
[11:59] hell, no steam of
[12:02] man can ever
[12:05] block me from his
[12:09] hand till he
[12:12] returns or calls me
[12:16] home. Here in the power of
[12:19] Christ, I'll stand there in the ground.
[12:26] There in the
[12:27] ground his body
[12:31] lay the light of the world by darkness
[12:37] lay. Then bursting
[12:40] forth in glorious
[12:44] day. Up from the grave he
[12:47] rose again.
[12:51] And as he
[12:53] stands in
[12:56] victory, sin's curse has
[12:59] lost its grip on
[13:02] me. For I am
[13:05] his and he is
[13:09] mine. Bought with the precious
[13:13] blood of Christ.
[13:21] Worthy. You are
[13:25] worthy. King of kings. Lord of lords.
[13:31] You are
[13:35] worthy.
[13:38] Worthy. You are
[13:43] worthy. King of kings. Lord of lords. I
[13:48] worship
[13:50] you.
[13:52] Worthy,
[13:56] worthy. You are
[14:00] worthy. King of kings, Lord of hosts.
[14:05] You are
[14:07] worthy.
[14:09] Worthy.
[14:13] Worthy. You are worthy.
[14:18] King of kings, Lord of lords, I worship
[14:23] you.
[14:27] Amen. God bless you this morning. Isn't
[14:30] it a privilege to worship a risen savior
[14:33] who's alive in our midst? Amen. As we go
[14:37] to prayer, we just want to remember that
[14:38] our brother Gabe Smith is in Pittsburgh
[14:40] preaching for brother John this morning
[14:42] and brother Jim Swanson is across town
[14:44] preaching for Bible believers. So as we
[14:46] pray for this service, we want to
[14:48] remember them as well. Let's bow our
[14:50] heads
[14:50] together. Dear heavenly father, we're so
[14:53] thankful, Lord Jesus, for your goodness.
[14:56] Lord, we're so thankful for what you
[14:57] have done for us and this opportunity we
[15:00] have just to reflect and remember, Lord,
[15:02] your death and your
[15:04] resurrection. And God, that you ever
[15:06] remain alive, Lord, with the power to
[15:08] deliver us from the strongholds of the
[15:10] enemy. You have set us free. And Lord,
[15:13] we come to worship you, Lord. and we
[15:15] thank you for the privilege. We pray
[15:17] that you'd bless our service now as we
[15:19] turn to your word. May you take and
[15:21] break the bread of life with your own
[15:22] hands. And may you feed us your waiting
[15:24] sheep, Lord, for we're hungry for more
[15:27] from you. We pray that you bless our
[15:29] brother Gabe, Lord, as he's ministering
[15:31] away. And also, Brother Jim Swanson, may
[15:33] you anoint them and use them mightily.
[15:35] May they also be in your hands as a tool
[15:38] to deliver your word to your children.
[15:40] For God, we trust in you and we trust in
[15:42] your way and we look to you, God, not to
[15:45] flesh. We love you and we ask your
[15:47] blessings over all these things. May you
[15:49] bless us as we read your word now. In
[15:51] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[15:55] May God bless you this morning and happy
[15:57] Easter. Amen. I I uh I like to think of
[16:01] it as resurrection Sunday. Amen. And so
[16:05] that was just the beginning. The
[16:07] resurrection Sunday brought the
[16:08] resurrected life back into our midst.
[16:10] Amen. Let's look at John chapter 11
[16:18] together. Uh John chapter 11. While
[16:21] you're turning there, I just want to uh
[16:22] remind you that I'll be leaving this
[16:24] week, actually tomorrow, for the trip to
[16:26] Poland. And so, uh, also the three, uh,
[16:29] young men that'll be going with me,
[16:31] Brother Josiah Priest, Brother Joshua
[16:33] Smol, and Brother Samuel Pittsenberger.
[16:36] They'll be going, we've got a couple
[16:38] family, I got a couple family camps to
[16:39] do. They're coming to the first one,
[16:41] then they're coming back home. So,
[16:42] they're leaving me, but we've got a
[16:44] family camp with brother Yatsik's
[16:46] church, uh, there in Poland, and then
[16:48] I'll go for midweek meetings in Ukraine,
[16:51] and then I'll come back to the other
[16:53] end, the opposite end of Poland, and
[16:55] have another family camp. So, it's two
[16:57] family camps on two weekends. So, I
[16:59] really would cover your prayers. I
[17:01] really would ask you to be remembering
[17:02] me in prayer that God will give us
[17:04] strength and anointing for that. And so,
[17:06] while I'm gone, I've asked several
[17:08] brothers to minister for us. I've asked
[17:10] brother Ron Garvin to take the first
[17:12] Wednesday I'm gone. This this coming
[17:14] Wednesday. And then Sunday, Brother
[17:16] Burley Williams will be coming in and
[17:17] ministering for us. And then the
[17:19] following Wednesday, Brother Gabe Smith
[17:22] will be ministering. And then that last
[17:24] Sunday that I'm gone, May 4th, Brother
[17:26] Emanuel Sabasu is coming back and he's
[17:28] going to take the service. So really
[17:29] looking forward to hearing from him and
[17:31] getting an update on how he and his
[17:33] family are doing. Amen. So pray for
[17:36] those uh brothers who will be
[17:37] ministering here as well. Amen. Let's
[17:41] look here. John chap 11
[17:44] uh in verse 21. John 11 and 21.
[17:50] This is at the death of Lazarus. We know
[17:53] the story very well. And verse 20 says,
[17:57] "Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if
[18:00] thou hast been here, my brother had not
[18:01] died. But I know that even now
[18:04] whatsoever thou wil ask of God, God will
[18:06] giveth thee." Jesus saith unto her, "Thy
[18:09] brother shall rise again." Martha said
[18:11] unto him, I know that he shall rise
[18:13] again in the resurrection at at the last
[18:16] day. Jesus said unto her, I am the
[18:19] resurrection and the life. He that
[18:22] believeth in me, though he were dead,
[18:24] yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth
[18:26] and believeth in me shall never die.
[18:29] Believest thou this. Amen. God bless you
[18:32] as you have your
[18:34] seats. Oh my. It's amazing how you can
[18:37] read a a scripture and it can be so
[18:39] familiar, but it has so much life in it
[18:41] all the time and it's constantly giving
[18:43] life.
[18:44] So Jesus
[18:46] comes, he comes on the scene when it's
[18:49] seemingly too late.
[18:54] How many times does he come on the scene
[18:55] when it seems like it's too late? Amen.
[18:57] But he's never late. He's always on
[18:59] time. So it seemed to them that he was
[19:02] late because they had called when their
[19:04] brother was sick and at the point of
[19:05] death and wanted the Lord to come and
[19:07] heal him. And they knew he had the power
[19:09] to heal them. And so they called for him
[19:12] uh to come and he delayed his departure
[19:14] intentionally and he waited till Lazarus
[19:17] was dead and once he knew that Lazarus
[19:19] was dead he told the disciples let's go
[19:22] now Lazarus sleepeth and they started
[19:25] questioning well if he's sleep he's fine
[19:27] he says no so he you know brother Ram
[19:29] tells us he had to say it in a language
[19:31] they would understand he's Lazarus is
[19:33] dead dead as far as what you know dead
[19:36] but not really dead because a saint can
[19:38] never die. Amen. Amen. Why? Because they
[19:41] have life inside. So Jesus comes down
[19:43] and Martha, you know, she makes the
[19:44] statement that we just read. Uh and and
[19:47] then she knows he Jesus says, "Thy
[19:50] brother shall rise again." And Martha
[19:53] says, "Yes, I know there's coming a day
[19:55] at the end of everything and I believe
[19:57] in that." And so she's already confessed
[19:59] her faith in a resurrection and at the
[20:02] end time there'll be a resurrection and
[20:04] all that have went in the graves will
[20:05] come up. So she's a believer. She has
[20:07] faith in the word. But Jesus said unto
[20:09] her,"I am the resurrection and the
[20:12] life." Amen. So the resurrection isn't
[20:15] just an event. The resurrection is a
[20:16] person. Amen. I am the resurrection and
[20:20] the life. He that believeth in me,
[20:23] though he were dead, yet shall he live.
[20:26] And whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[20:28] shall never die. Then he says,
[20:30] "Believest thou
[20:32] this?" He just took it up a whole
[20:34] another level. Amen. Yeah. You believe
[20:36] in a resurrection. That's good. You
[20:38] believe the scriptures. You're you're
[20:40] not like the Sadducees. You You're not
[20:42] of those who don't believe in a
[20:43] resurrection. That's wonderful. But but
[20:46] listen, there's a deeper meaning to the
[20:48] resurrection. And the deeper meaning is
[20:50] me. It's about life. And I am the
[20:53] resurrection. And I am the life. And
[20:55] whosoever believeth in me, though he
[20:56] were dead, yet shall he live. Amen. And
[20:59] I don't believe he's talking about
[21:00] people that are in the grave, but people
[21:02] who have not yet awakened to life. Amen.
[21:04] When you're walking as dead upon the
[21:06] earth, dead and alienated from God and
[21:08] separated from the things of God, you're
[21:10] as though you're dead to the things of
[21:12] God. But though you were dead, if you
[21:13] believe in him, you shall live. Amen.
[21:16] Because he is the resurrection and the
[21:18] life. Amen. Amen. Though he were dead,
[21:21] yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth
[21:23] and believeth in me shall never die.
[21:27] Amen. Do you believe that? Amen.
[21:33] I love it. I believe it. Amen. Amen. I
[21:39] believe it. Amen. Brother Brandon made
[21:42] this statement in the message
[21:44] investments. He said, "And then Jehovah
[21:45] dying on the cross, suffering the sins
[21:47] of the world. He didn't have to do it,
[21:49] but he did. He did do it. His grace
[21:52] constrained him. His love God so loved
[21:55] and his love constrained him. I I just
[21:59] think it's amazing when we look at the
[22:00] picture of Calvary. Amen. We look at a
[22:04] picture of God's love. And it was his
[22:07] love that constrained him to give his
[22:09] son. And it was his love that
[22:10] constrained the son to give his life and
[22:13] to go to Calvary. And we know that he he
[22:15] wrestled it out in Gethsemane and
[22:17] overcame even his own desires and
[22:19] surrendered to the will of the father.
[22:21] And he was constrained by love. And God
[22:24] was constrained by love to give him.
[22:26] Amen. I This is what I want to talk
[22:28] about if I can this morning for a little
[22:30] while. Amen. The love of God and and I
[22:33] want to bring it home down into our
[22:35] lives and not just leave it back in
[22:37] Jesus Christ and just leave it in
[22:38] Calvary. Amen. But whatever was in him
[22:41] then is supposed to be in us now. And he
[22:44] he went through that for our example.
[22:46] And now we're supposed to live that
[22:47] example and flesh it out in the flesh of
[22:50] our lives. So we know John 3:16 very
[22:54] well. It says, "For God so loved the
[22:56] world that he gave his only begotten
[22:58] son." So this is such a good picture of
[23:01] love. God love constrained him to give
[23:04] his son. But God so loved the world that
[23:07] he gave. And so we start looking at love
[23:09] this way. Uh a love is a the true love
[23:14] love that God demonstrated to us is
[23:16] sacrificial love. Amen. God so loved
[23:19] that he gave
[23:21] this humanistic love that we deal with
[23:24] all the time and we've preached on it
[23:25] before and we will many times more
[23:27] because it's all around us. This
[23:28] humanistic love has self at the center
[23:31] of love.
[23:33] But God's love is a projected love and
[23:36] it projects to those who are the
[23:38] recipients of his love.
[23:40] And because he loved the world, he gave
[23:42] his only begotten son that whosoever
[23:44] believeth in him should not perish but
[23:46] have everlasting life. For God sent not
[23:49] his son into the world to condemn the
[23:50] world but that the world through him
[23:52] might be saved. Amen. So God's love for
[23:56] the world provided a savior, provided a
[23:59] sacrifice, provided an atonement. So God
[24:02] so loved that he gave and we know he
[24:04] gave himself and gave his own life.
[24:06] Amen. And that love was never if I could
[24:10] say this that that love never came for
[24:13] condemnation.
[24:15] That love always came for life.
[24:18] But those who could not receive God's
[24:20] love fell into condemnation. Amen. They
[24:23] were already condemned because they
[24:24] believed not. So God never projected his
[24:27] love to condemn. He projected his love
[24:29] to save. Amen. But not everybody can
[24:32] receive God's love. We know that. So,
[24:36] these are just points that I'm making so
[24:38] that we can tie them together as we move
[24:41] forward. Let's turn to First John. Let's
[24:44] go to the book of First
[24:54] John. First John and chapter, we'll go
[24:57] to chapter 4.
[25:03] 1 John chapter 4 verse
[25:08] 10. Herein is love. So you stop for a
[25:12] minute said this is love. I'm going to
[25:14] give you a description of love is what
[25:16] John said. Here in his love not that we
[25:18] loved God but that he loved us and sent
[25:22] his son to be the propitiation for our
[25:24] sins. So once again he's saying the same
[25:26] thing. This is love. God loved so God
[25:28] gave. His love constrained him to give
[25:32] of himself. Amen. Amen. Brother man uh
[25:36] makes this statement in God's power to
[25:38] transform you being flesh and him being
[25:40] flesh, then you can fellowship with one
[25:42] another because he was God's attribute
[25:44] of love. God is love. Is that right? And
[25:46] Jesus was God's attribute of love. And
[25:49] when the attribute of love was
[25:50] displayed, which that was God himself,
[25:53] all the attributes that hung on to him
[25:55] came to him. All the father had given me
[25:58] will come to me. Sure, they had to be
[26:01] predestinated. So it was the very act of
[26:03] God's love on display that drew us to
[26:06] him. Amen. That's the reason he sent his
[26:09] son. That's why he expressed his love
[26:11] because he was drawing back all his
[26:12] attributes that were part of that love.
[26:15] Because remember, God is love. So let's
[26:18] go to Romans now and start to build this
[26:23] thought. Romans chapter 6.
[26:36] in Romans chapter 6. Let's go right to
[26:39] verse one. What shall we say then? Shall
[26:43] we continue in sin that grace may
[26:44] abound? God forbid. How shall we that
[26:47] are dead to sin live any longer therein?
[26:49] Know you not that so many of us as were
[26:52] baptized unto Jesus Christ were baptized
[26:54] unto his death? Therefore, we are buried
[26:56] with him by baptism into death, that
[26:59] like as Christ was raised from the dead
[27:01] by the glory of the Father, even so we
[27:04] also should walk in newness of life. For
[27:07] if we have been planted together in the
[27:08] likeness of his death, we shall be also
[27:10] in the likeness of his
[27:12] resurrection, knowing this, that our old
[27:15] man is crucified with him, that the body
[27:18] of sin might be destroyed, that
[27:20] henceforth we should not serve sin. For
[27:23] he that is dead is freed from sin. Now,
[27:25] if we be dead with Christ, we believe
[27:27] that we shall also live with him.
[27:30] Knowing that Christ being raised from
[27:32] the dead dieth no more, death hath no
[27:34] more dominion over him. For in that he
[27:36] died, he died unto sin once, but in that
[27:39] he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise,
[27:42] reckon you also yourselves to be dead
[27:44] indeed unto sin, but alive unto God,
[27:46] through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not
[27:49] sin, therefore, reign in your mortal
[27:51] body, that you should obey it in the
[27:52] lust thereof. Neither yield you your
[27:55] members as instruments of righteousness
[27:57] unto sin, but yield yourself unto God as
[28:00] those that are alive from the dead, and
[28:02] your members as instruments of
[28:04] righteousness unto God. For sin shall
[28:06] not have dominion over you, for you are
[28:08] not under the law, but under grace. So
[28:11] he's telling us, you have been buried in
[28:14] his likeness of his death. You have
[28:16] surrendered your life and died to your
[28:18] old nature and to your old ways, and
[28:20] you've come forth as a new creature in
[28:22] Christ Jesus. So now, therefore, you
[28:25] don't render this flesh anymore to the
[28:27] old things of sin. That is dead. We've
[28:29] died unto sin. We've died unto our life.
[28:32] We've died unto unbelief. Now we've come
[28:34] forward in a resurrected life. Amen.
[28:37] Because why? We've received him and he
[28:39] is the resurrection and the life. Amen.
[28:42] So we've come forth in newness of life.
[28:45] Amen. And now these instruments are not
[28:47] instruments unto sin, but these are
[28:49] instruments unto God. Amen. To be used
[28:52] for the righteousness of God, for the
[28:54] display of God. Amen. So that's what
[28:56] John's telling us. And so now I if if we
[28:59] could think of it this way, Jesus, he
[29:02] came and he lived the perfect life to
[29:05] display the life of God. Jesus was the
[29:08] life of God on display. He was the
[29:10] expressed image of the almighty God. So
[29:12] the father was displaying himself in
[29:14] Jesus. And so then Jesus came and gave
[29:17] his life and died to set us free and he
[29:20] resurrected in life. Right? So he came
[29:25] perfect, lived a perfect life and he
[29:28] died to free us from sin.
[29:31] And then he resurrected again so that he
[29:33] could bring that life back into us. So
[29:36] that we could we have lived an unperfect
[29:38] life, a a life of unbelief and sin. So
[29:41] that we could die to
[29:43] ourselves and resurrect in his
[29:46] life to live the life he lived before he
[29:49] died,
[29:52] which was the life of God on display. So
[29:54] when we receive the life of Christ, we
[29:55] receive that same life that was living
[29:57] before. Amen. He went through this
[29:59] process so that we could die. So that we
[30:02] could come forth in the newness of his
[30:03] life. His life injected in us so that we
[30:06] can finish his life on this earth. The
[30:09] one that he lived on this earth is now
[30:11] still living on this earth. And we know
[30:13] that through the church ages that life
[30:15] went into obscurity because the Holy
[30:17] Ghost was bound by these denominational
[30:19] waters because of misunderstanding and
[30:22] misinterpretation. But God in the end
[30:24] time is breaking the barrier down. Amen.
[30:26] And he's restored back. Amen. All that
[30:29] God was and all the revelation to bring
[30:31] back that full life once again upon a
[30:33] church and so that Christ can live once
[30:36] again and you and I in the resurrection.
[30:39] Amen. Because he is the resurrection and
[30:41] he has come back in full measure. And
[30:43] this is resurrection in life. That's why
[30:46] this is rapture season. This is
[30:47] resurrection season. Amen. This is the
[30:49] resurrection of his bride that had
[30:51] fallen into obscurity and been restored
[30:53] through the church ages. The restoration
[30:55] of the bride tree. Amen. To live his
[30:58] life.
[31:00] That's the thing that I I want to hone
[31:02] in on. It all happened to live his life.
[31:06] Amen. It didn't all that happened and
[31:10] all we believe and all we celebrate and
[31:12] all we worship was was so that we could
[31:14] be free from the life of sin to live his
[31:18] life. Not so that we could uh get a
[31:21] ticket to heaven and go on living our
[31:22] life.
[31:25] We're supposed to go through death,
[31:27] burial, and resurrection to come forth
[31:29] as a new creature in Christ Jesus so
[31:32] that we can continue the life of Christ
[31:33] on the earth. And that's our commission
[31:36] and that's the reason all of these
[31:37] things happen.
[31:39] See, when it when when when Christianity
[31:42] as a whole teaches teaches the Calvary
[31:45] and teaches the resurrection as uh they
[31:49] they teach it correctly in many ways as
[31:51] God's love, God's love for the world,
[31:52] God's sacrifice, and that's all correct.
[31:55] But in the teaching, sometimes it stops
[31:57] in the fact that Jesus died for you so
[31:59] that you could be saved, so that you
[32:00] could go to heaven. Amen. And and that
[32:02] there there's truth in that. there's a
[32:04] restoration of the of the children of
[32:06] God and there's an opportunity for
[32:08] entrance into eternal life and to others
[32:10] and all that happened because of
[32:11] Calvary.
[32:13] That's true. But that was not all that
[32:15] he was accomplishing at Calvary. He
[32:17] wasn't purchasing you just a ticket to
[32:18] heaven. What he was doing, he was
[32:20] scouring you from the old life. Amen.
[32:23] And cleansing you so he had sanctifying
[32:24] power by his shed blood so that he could
[32:27] get inside of you. Yeah. That's what
[32:29] Calvary was producing. And the
[32:31] resurrection showed that he was alive
[32:33] and he was and and he was going to bring
[32:35] that life into his church.
[32:39] So we don't want to stop with just a
[32:41] surface level of Calvary of just
[32:42] redemption and buying us back. But he
[32:44] redeemed us and he bought us back so
[32:46] that he could cleanse us and so that he
[32:47] could fill us so that he could continue
[32:49] his life on this earth. Amen. And that's
[32:52] our commission and calling. That's the
[32:54] resurrected life in a bride.
[32:59] The Rem says in the message that day on
[33:01] Calvary, he says, "I hope this helps you
[33:04] to get in a place." That's what the
[33:06] tabernacle, that's what all people has
[33:08] got to do is find out what you are and
[33:12] what's the purpose. This is so important
[33:15] for life to find out what you are and
[33:19] what's the purpose. The purpose for what
[33:22] you are, the purpose for your life, why
[33:25] are you here? Why did God call you? Why
[33:28] did he die for you? Why did he give you
[33:30] his spirit? Why did he give you the
[33:31] message? Why? What? What's the purpose?
[33:35] Church, brother says, church isn't going
[33:37] to church just to play music, sing
[33:39] songs. Church is a place where
[33:41] correction. Judgment begins at the house
[33:42] of God. We must reckon ourselves dead
[33:45] and alive to Christ. Then he made the
[33:47] way that we would we could sacrifice
[33:50] ourselves to his service to follow him.
[33:52] And if we follow him, we lead the life
[33:54] that he led. Praise God. Amen. So that's
[33:57] what we come to church for. Amen. Not
[34:00] just to sing songs. And we love to come
[34:02] to church and we love to sing songs. We
[34:04] love to worship. We love to sing his
[34:06] praises. We love to have the fellowship
[34:07] together. But really, we're trying to
[34:09] continually identify our purpose so that
[34:12] we can die to anything outside of that
[34:14] purpose. So God will continually bring
[34:16] that purpose back to our minds over and
[34:18] over Sunday and Wednesday because the
[34:20] life that we live in a human body with a
[34:22] human mind in Leodysia is not the life
[34:25] of Christ.
[34:28] So we constantly got to get realigned
[34:30] through the word to run understand
[34:32] what's the purpose for me being here?
[34:34] What's the purpose for being redeemed?
[34:36] Why did he sanctify me? Why did he fill
[34:38] me with his spirit? What what is it all
[34:40] for? And then we can keep lining
[34:42] ourselves to that purpose.
[34:46] Amen. Amen. So Jesus says in Luke 9,
[34:50] just turn turn there with me. We're
[34:51] going to turn to several more
[34:52] scriptures. So keep your Bible handy.
[34:55] Luke chapter
[35:08] 9. Luke chapter 9 and verse
[35:13] 22. Now, I'm going the long way around,
[35:17] so just hang with me. Enjoy the ride.
[35:19] Amen. But I want to get to this love of
[35:21] God expressed in Christ. But I'm going
[35:24] to go I'm going to take we're going to
[35:25] take a long trip around Luke
[35:29] 9:22. Saying, "The Son of Man must
[35:33] suffer many things and be rejected of
[35:35] the elders and chief priests and scribes
[35:37] and be slain and be raised the third
[35:39] day." And he said to them all, "If any
[35:42] man will come after me, let him deny
[35:45] himself and take up his cross daily and
[35:48] follow me. For whosoever will save his
[35:50] life shall lose it. But whosoever will
[35:53] lose his life for my sake, the same
[35:56] shall save it. So this is really
[35:57] familiar to us. But but Jesus now is is
[36:01] beginning to describe he's beginning to
[36:04] tell his disciples that he's going to
[36:05] Calvary. So he's starting to break the
[36:08] news to them that he's going to go and
[36:10] be mistreated and he's going to be slain
[36:12] and on the third day he'll raise again.
[36:14] And so when Jesus begins to tell his
[36:17] disciples about Calvary, he doesn't
[36:20] leave Calvary isolated to him alone.
[36:24] Because the same time he talks about
[36:26] Calvary, he says, "Now, if any man will
[36:29] follow after me, let him take up his
[36:31] cross."
[36:33] So Calvary wasn't just for Jesus.
[36:36] Calvary is for me. Calvary is for the
[36:39] disciples.
[36:41] Calvary became the fundamental basis of
[36:46] Christianity.
[36:48] It became the the uh it became the
[36:51] surrender to the will of God. It became
[36:53] the ultimate sacrifice. It became the
[36:56] way of bringing uh others into life.
[36:59] There's so many things symbolic in
[37:01] Calvary and resurrection. And we're in
[37:03] the we're in this season of uh what
[37:05] Easter season of the of the crucifixion
[37:08] and the burial and the resurrection of
[37:10] Jesus Christ. Amen. But we realize we
[37:13] can isolate that back to 2,000 years
[37:16] ago. And 2,000 years ago he died for me.
[37:18] And that is true. But when Jesus begins
[37:21] to describe his his uh crucifixion, he
[37:24] doesn't isolate it to himself alone, but
[37:27] he starts to share Calvar's principles
[37:30] and the need for Calvary with his
[37:31] disciples.
[37:34] So what's the fundamental basis of
[37:36] Christianity for us? Calvary, what is
[37:38] Calvary? Dying to myself. Amen.
[37:41] surrendering out everything that's mine
[37:44] and completely yielding to the word and
[37:46] will of God so that God can work his
[37:49] work in me. That's what he did in
[37:52] Christ. Christ was the lamb of God to
[37:53] take away the sins of the world. And in
[37:55] Gethsemane, he had to wrestle it out.
[37:57] And brother Benham said he won back Eden
[38:00] in Gethsemane. And you say, how did he
[38:02] win back Eden in Gethsemane? Amen.
[38:04] Because Eden was lost. Amen. When a
[38:06] woman took her own desire, Amen. above
[38:10] the word of God and she desired. Brother
[38:12] Me said she didn't know but she wanted
[38:14] to know. We know she was tricked into it
[38:15] but she was led away of her own lust and
[38:17] enticed. Amen. And so lust and desire
[38:20] and want amen drove her away from the
[38:23] word of God into her own will and she
[38:25] exercised her own will. And then Adam
[38:27] exercised his own will amen to save his
[38:30] wife. And by self-will amen and lack of
[38:33] self-sacrifice amen brought the fall of
[38:36] Eden. Amen. So ju in Gethsemane, Jesus
[38:40] is now wrestling it out. And brother
[38:42] Brandham said he came to that great
[38:43] place, that great decision. Would he
[38:46] would he bear the sins of the whole
[38:48] world or would he stay with his
[38:50] disciples what he wanted to do? And he
[38:53] came to the same place. Amen. He didn't
[38:55] want to leave his disciples. He had
[38:56] affection and love for them. He had a
[38:58] relationship for them. No doubt he knew
[38:59] they would fall into all kinds of
[39:01] trouble. He had a desire, amen, as a man
[39:04] to stay with them. But he had a
[39:05] commission and calling from God to go to
[39:08] Calvary and bear the sins of the whole
[39:09] world and be mutilated and abused and
[39:12] killed.
[39:15] And we see the we see the wrestling
[39:18] match, if we could say it that way, was
[39:20] so intense. It wasn't like Jesus just
[39:23] said, "Well, you know, whatever you
[39:25] want, God." It wasn't like that. He
[39:27] prayed with such earnestness and agony
[39:30] until great drops of as it were of sweat
[39:32] like blood was falling from his face
[39:35] because he was on tense agony because
[39:37] this was the wrestling of all
[39:39] wrestlings. This was going to prove that
[39:41] this was the last Adam, the worthy one,
[39:43] the one who could be the lamb of God,
[39:45] the pure undefiled lamb of God. Would he
[39:48] take what he wants or would he follow
[39:49] the will of God?
[39:52] I mean the whole battle, everything
[39:53] comes to Gethsemane. Yeah. Amen.
[39:57] And will
[39:59] I surrender or will I follow my desire?
[40:03] And three times he asked the Lord, is
[40:05] there any other way? Can this cup pass
[40:08] me by? He said, but nevertheless, not my
[40:11] will that I done. So three times he
[40:13] surrenders himself to the will of God
[40:15] and subjects himself. And that's why I
[40:17] believe brother Brandham said he won
[40:19] back Gim he won back Eden in Gethsemane
[40:21] because he reversed what happened in
[40:23] Eden. Amen. Right. So listen, when we
[40:26] say Calvary is our example, don't forget
[40:29] Gethsemane. Gethsemane is part of
[40:30] Calvary. Amen.
[40:33] Amen. Listen, we we all have
[40:36] Gethsemanees.
[40:38] We have many of them in our life because
[40:39] there's many times we come to a place
[40:42] where God is asking of us, Amen, a
[40:44] greater surrender, a greater sacrifice.
[40:46] And there's things that we desire in the
[40:48] flesh. And it may be carnal things. It
[40:51] may be family things. It may be
[40:52] workrelated things. Whatever you
[40:54] whatever those things are, there's
[40:56] things that we desire and we know that
[40:58] the word of God is saying no. There's a
[41:00] barrier to what we want by the word of
[41:02] God or the will of God or God asking us
[41:05] to go in another direction and give this
[41:06] up. Amen. And we may think that we're
[41:09] super spiritual and all of us are like,
[41:10] "Well, I only want the will of God." But
[41:12] a lot of times we've got to get down and
[41:14] wrestle this out in prayer. Amen.
[41:17] And a lot of times what we do is we just
[41:19] keep praying. Amen. Like Balam did,
[41:21] hoping he'll change his mind.
[41:26] When we already know in our heart what
[41:28] he's asking us to do. Amen. So we come
[41:30] to our Gethsemane where we have got to
[41:33] die to whatever it is that we want or we
[41:36] think. That's right. Take his word. and
[41:39] then come to Calvary and die to that
[41:42] thing and let it be cut out of us so
[41:44] that we can live his
[41:46] life. So Calvary isn't just for Jesus.
[41:50] Calvary is for me.
[41:53] He told me to take my
[41:56] cross and he told me to die daily.
[42:02] So that means that there's a
[42:04] continual death to me all the time.
[42:10] Praise God.
[42:12] But you can't have a resurrection
[42:14] without a death.
[42:18] You can't have
[42:20] resurrection without
[42:22] death. And so when we realize that
[42:25] resurrection follows death, then all of
[42:27] a sudden I look forward to more death.
[42:31] I'm not talking about one resurrection.
[42:33] I'm talking about many resurrections in
[42:35] our life where the word comes to life
[42:37] again and again and again because I laid
[42:39] down something else in my life so
[42:41] something else of his life can live.
[42:46] Praise
[42:48] God.
[42:50] Amen. Let's go. We're not going to turn
[42:53] Yeah, we're going to turn to Hebrews 12.
[42:55] Turn to Hebrews 12, but I'm not going to
[42:56] read it just yet. I'll go to that next.
[43:02] Hebrews chapter
[43:04] 12 in the message who is this Melzdc
[43:08] brother makes a statement he says being
[43:11] eternal with him at the beginning the
[43:13] eternal life that you had his thought of
[43:16] what you was only he wanted you to he
[43:18] wanted me to stand in the pull pit say
[43:21] he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight
[43:24] then we are serving his eternal purpose
[43:27] and the one that left home only come to
[43:30] earth to serve his
[43:31] purpose. Amen. We by the message we
[43:34] believe we're part of that statement. Do
[43:35] you believe you're part of that
[43:36] statement?
[43:38] Amen. The And the one that left home, it
[43:42] means we left home, friends. That means
[43:44] this isn't our home. I mean, that's one
[43:46] of the greatest revelations you can ever
[43:48] catch. This isn't our home. Because when
[43:51] he asked us to take our cross and die
[43:53] daily, it really it's really good for us
[43:55] to realize that this isn't my home. This
[43:57] isn't my origin. This isn't who I am.
[44:00] This is only a temporary position for
[44:02] me. Because it makes daily dying on a
[44:04] cross so much easier when you realize
[44:06] the bigger picture. And by the grace of
[44:08] God in this end time, he's lifted us up
[44:10] on eagle wings to bring us to the big
[44:12] picture to we realize it doesn't matter
[44:15] if I'm miserable on this earth for 45,
[44:17] 50 years. That's a that's a blip in the
[44:20] radar. I'm an eternal being, an
[44:22] attribute of God predestinated to be
[44:24] here for his purpose, not for mine. And
[44:27] what comes next is worth anything that I
[44:29] could ever endure in this life.
[44:34] So
[44:35] important to catch the revelation from
[44:38] God. And the one that left home only
[44:40] come to earth to serve his purpose. Is
[44:42] that right? All right. Then after it's
[44:44] finished, it's brought back in a
[44:46] glorified state. It's matured and
[44:48] brought back again. So it comes as a
[44:50] seed of God, an attribute of God. It
[44:53] goes through a process. It's matured and
[44:54] it goes right back to God. I come from
[44:56] God and I'm going back to God. Amen. And
[45:00] I'm going through a maturing.
[45:03] And please don't ask me to describe that
[45:05] to you. I have no idea. I just know it's
[45:07] God working his life out of us. Amen.
[45:12] He says, "No wonder Paul could say when
[45:14] they were building a block to chop his
[45:16] head off, he said, "Death, where is your
[45:17] sting?"
[45:19] He takes he goes right to Paul having no
[45:21] fear of death, having no uh not
[45:24] recoiling whatsoever at his own
[45:26] execution. And what caused Paul to be
[45:29] able to stand, amen, that time of
[45:30] execution because Paul had been through
[45:32] the seventh heaven, our third heaven,
[45:34] Paul had seen beyond the curtain of
[45:36] time. Paul knew, amen, that there's
[45:38] nothing you can do to me that's going to
[45:40] stop this life. Amen. that there's no he
[45:43] can surrender to the will of God so
[45:45] easily because he's got a bigger picture
[45:46] of what life actually is.
[45:49] He said no wonder Paul could say when
[45:51] they was building a block to chop his
[45:52] head off, "Oh death, where is your
[45:54] sting? Oh grave, where is your victory?
[45:56] But thanks be to God who gives us the
[45:57] victory." He said, "Death, tell me where
[46:00] you can make me
[46:02] holler." Oh, I love this. Where can you
[46:06] make me holler? Grave, tell me how
[46:08] you're going to hold me. For I'm a
[46:10] possessor of eternal life. Amen. He
[46:12] recognized that death, hell, grave,
[46:14] nothing could hold him and nothing could
[46:16] hurt us if he got eternal life. He
[46:18] realized he was blessed with eternal
[46:21] life just like a little dew drop. Now,
[46:23] brother Bam's going to take it to an
[46:24] analogy. Now, follow the analogy. This
[46:27] analogy is you. Amen. He's talking about
[46:30] Paul. Paul not being afraid of death.
[46:32] And Paul and I want to go further than
[46:35] Paul not being afraid of
[46:37] death. It's not just not being afraid of
[46:39] death.
[46:41] Paul was not persuaded otherwise by the
[46:45] threat of death.
[46:47] That becomes more important
[46:50] because no matter what threat they throw
[46:53] at Paul, Paul knew who he was and he was
[46:56] able to sacrifice himself to maintain
[46:59] his commission and his purpose for being
[47:01] on this earth. Amen.
[47:06] He says now just like a little dew
[47:08] drop. He said if I understand I don't
[47:11] know too much about chemistry but it
[47:13] must be the it's the congaling of
[47:15] humidity or atmosphere and when the
[47:17] night gets cold and dark it falls from
[47:19] heaven and drops upon the ground. It's
[47:21] fell from
[47:23] somewhere. Listen, I love this because
[47:25] he's talking about you. Amen.
[47:28] This little dew drop on a blade of grass
[47:30] in the morning. He said it fell from
[47:32] somewhere. It existed somewhere else.
[47:35] But I want you to understand this. It
[47:37] existed somewhere else in another form.
[47:39] Amen. It was vapor in another form. Now
[47:42] it's changed form to come into a
[47:44] manifestation upon the earth. He's
[47:46] talking about you.
[47:49] And he says, "I don't understand the
[47:50] chemistry of this." Now he's talking
[47:52] about uh uh mechanically. He doesn't
[47:54] understand the chemistry of the dew
[47:55] drop, but I can say everything he's
[47:57] saying is true about me. And I may not
[47:59] understand the spiritual chemistry of
[48:00] it, but I know it's true. Amen. I may
[48:03] not be able to explain it on on on
[48:05] scientific uh scriptural or or spiritual
[48:09] science. I don't know. But it's the
[48:11] truth.
[48:13] Amen. So, it's the congealing of
[48:16] humidity or atmosphere. And when the
[48:18] night gets cold and dark, it falls from
[48:20] the heavens and drops upon the ground.
[48:22] It's fell from somewhere. But the next
[48:24] morning before the sun's coming up, it's
[48:26] laying there. The little fellow's
[48:28] shivering. But just let the sun come up.
[48:30] Watch it go to shining. It's happy. Why?
[48:35] The sun is going to call it right back
[48:37] to where it came from.
[48:40] That's why this is the rising of the
[48:42] sun. This is shalom. This is good
[48:44] morning. This bright sunlight that's
[48:46] come at the opening of the seals at the
[48:48] at the breaking of the message in our
[48:50] end time. That sun is up to what? To
[48:53] call us back home, to change us into
[48:55] another state so that we can go back to
[48:57] where we came from. Amen. Amen. So, it's
[49:01] laying there in the cold dark night just
[49:03] shivering, but the sun comes up and it
[49:05] goes to shining. It's happy. Listen,
[49:08] it's shimmering and shining and happy
[49:10] reflecting the light, but it's still a
[49:13] dew drop on the grass.
[49:16] It's still on this earth. It's still a
[49:18] dew drop on the grass, but it begins to
[49:20] shimmer and reflect the light and get
[49:23] happy because it knows this light is
[49:26] taking me back home. It may not happen
[49:28] right now. It might be 5 minutes from
[49:30] now, an hour from now, 2 hours from now.
[49:32] The time doesn't matter. It knows when
[49:35] it feels the light that I'm going back
[49:36] home. And it can shimmer and shake and
[49:39] be happy and glow in the light of God.
[49:42] That's us on this earth right now. We
[49:44] know we came from somewhere. And in a
[49:45] cold, dark night, amen, something
[49:48] congealed and came together
[49:50] and we've been planted here on the
[49:52] earth. Amen. in the darkness of of
[49:54] obscurity, in the darkness of false
[49:56] religion, in the darkness of of a mind
[49:59] alienated from God. Amen. But praise
[50:01] God, as we laid here in another form,
[50:04] there was the rising of the sun. And
[50:06] when we felt that son of this message
[50:08] kiss us, amen, all of a sudden, we begin
[50:10] to shimmer and reflect the light and get
[50:12] excited and get happy. And you can say,
[50:14] "What are you happy about? You're not
[50:16] vapor. You haven't had a change of the
[50:17] body. you're still stuck on earth
[50:19] because I know that this sunlight's
[50:22] taking me back to where I was before.
[50:24] And this light will change my state.
[50:32] And listen, that light begins to change
[50:35] it.
[50:39] It begins to change it. How? Uh I I I
[50:43] don't know. It's like it's so subtle.
[50:45] You can't watch it and see it's
[50:47] happening. What's the moment that it
[50:50] goes from liquid to vapor? Yeah. I mean,
[50:53] all of a sudden it was there and then
[50:55] all of a sudden it wasn't there and you
[50:56] didn't notice it go.
[50:59] But the whole time the sun came up, it
[51:01] was beginning a process. It was doing
[51:03] the work. The work was already in
[51:05] motion. Amen. It was already excited
[51:07] because something was already happening.
[51:09] He wasn't waiting for something to
[51:11] happen. I was going to take him home was
[51:14] already working inside of him. His
[51:17] molecules were speeding up. They were
[51:19] already getting warm by the sun and the
[51:21] vibration was picking up. I want to ask
[51:23] you under the preaching of the word, is
[51:24] the vibration picking up? Are your
[51:26] molecules moving a little faster? Do you
[51:29] realize that this gospel is taking you
[51:31] back home? Amen.
[51:35] That if that's so then we can shimmer
[51:38] and we can shake and we can be happy in
[51:41] this state.
[51:46] Praise God.
[51:50] This story is so important to
[51:53] me because if this is true for this
[51:56] little drop of dew,
[52:00] if somebody goes by and looks at that
[52:02] dew and says, "You're nothing but a
[52:04] little dew drop." The dew drop don't
[52:06] care.
[52:10] He's already happy.
[52:14] You're worthless. You're nothing. You're
[52:16] not. What do you do? You don't do
[52:18] anything. What are you so excited about?
[52:20] I don't see what you're so excited
[52:21] about.
[52:25] It may not be real to the rabbit and it
[52:27] may not be real to the bird. It may not
[52:29] be real to the butterfly, but it's real
[52:31] to the dew drop.
[52:33] He can feel it working in him. And so
[52:36] now criticism doesn't matter because of
[52:38] the truth. Amen. Because of the
[52:41] identification of what he really is.
[52:46] criticism, condemnation. The fact that
[52:50] he is a dwrop on the earth and not yet
[52:53] ascended to the heavens doesn't change
[52:55] anything for him. It doesn't make him
[52:56] sad and miserable. No, he's there just
[52:59] as excited as ever
[53:01] because he's going home.
[53:04] This is such a good lesson for us
[53:07] because if if this is for us the rising
[53:10] of the sun and we are something that
[53:12] some bit of atmosphere or something from
[53:15] the spiritual realm that's congealed in
[53:16] a cold dark
[53:17] night and laying there waiting for the
[53:20] rising of the sun and the rising of the
[53:21] sun has sparked something in us a
[53:23] process that's going to change our
[53:25] atoms.
[53:27] We should be happy,
[53:29] excited, shimmering, reflecting the
[53:32] light.
[53:36] Amen. And then brother Rem tells that
[53:38] little story. Then he says, "And that's
[53:40] the way with a Christian." Hallelujah.
[53:42] We know when we walk into the presence
[53:44] of God, something in us tells us that we
[53:46] come from somewhere and we're going back
[53:49] again by the power that's up.
[53:52] Is there a power pulling you? You're
[53:55] going home, friends. the little dew
[53:57] drop, he glistens and shines and shouts
[54:00] because he knows he come from up there
[54:02] and that sun is going to draw him right
[54:04] back up again. And a man that's an
[54:06] attribute of God, born of God, knows,
[54:08] hallelujah, when he comes in contact
[54:10] with the son of God, he is going to be
[54:13] drawn up from here someday. For if I be
[54:15] lifted up from the earth, I'll draw all
[54:17] men. Amen. So, I love this quote because
[54:22] brother Bam starts off the quote with,
[54:24] "The one that left home only come to
[54:26] earth to serve his
[54:29] purpose. Then after it's finished, it's
[54:32] brought back in a glorified state. It's
[54:34] matured and brought back again."
[54:36] Then he talks about Paul not being
[54:38] afraid of the chopping block. And then
[54:41] he goes into the story of the dew drop.
[54:43] Then he attaches it to our life. Amen.
[54:45] And when you put all that together, you
[54:48] realize there should be nothing that
[54:50] we're afraid of.
[54:52] There should be nothing that turns us
[54:55] aside, stops our forward progress,
[54:58] changes our confession because the truth
[55:01] is greater than anything else.
[55:05] The power that is drawing us home is
[55:07] already upon us. The evidence that we
[55:10] come from somewhere else is already
[55:12] inside of us. Amen. the the our our our
[55:16] our security has come from this
[55:20] revelation. So there should be nothing
[55:23] outside of that that can make us
[55:25] insecure
[55:27] because of the security that comes from
[55:29] that
[55:30] revelation. But being that we're human
[55:32] beings, we deal with all kinds of
[55:34] things. There's always disappointments,
[55:37] discouragement, fears, and things like
[55:39] that. Then the devil's always trying to
[55:41] use all of these other things to derail
[55:44] us. Amen. And get us to stop or get us
[55:47] to be a afraid to get us to hold back to
[55:50] get us to change course. Amen. But when
[55:52] we can come back to this revelation,
[55:54] Amen. The power of the enemy is broke
[55:57] because how can he use fear when I have
[55:59] nothing to fear? Amen. How can he use
[56:01] rejection when I've already been
[56:03] accepted? How can he use a lie when I've
[56:05] already received the truth? Amen. Yes.
[56:08] This is where Paul got to. This is where
[56:10] the disciples came to after the baptism
[56:13] of the Holy Ghost. And now those that
[56:15] were fearful and timid and hiding in the
[56:17] upper room and and going fishing and
[56:19] doing all of these things. Amen.
[56:21] Afterwards, Amen. They came now with the
[56:23] very life of Jesus Christ, they had the
[56:24] witness within themselves. Amen. That
[56:27] they were part of the program. And they
[56:29] and and and and Peter and John, they go
[56:31] over to the temple and to the gate
[56:33] beautiful. And they heal the lame man.
[56:35] and he's leaping and jumping and they're
[56:36] preaching and and they call him before
[56:38] the Sanhedrin. This was the very place
[56:40] that he was scared to death to be. Yeah.
[56:43] Right. When Jesus was brought before the
[56:45] council in Caiaphas's house, Amen. or
[56:48] Ananas's house, I don't remember which
[56:49] one. But when he was caught to the
[56:50] council, Amen. He was standing outside
[56:52] by the fire. He wasn't even the one
[56:54] being questioned. He wouldn't even stand
[56:55] beside Jesus. He just wanted to see what
[56:57] was happening. So, he's hiding over by
[56:58] the fire as one of the servants. And he
[57:00] got called out and he said, "No, I don't
[57:02] know him." Got called out again. I don't
[57:03] know him until he till he swore till he
[57:06] cursed and he ran after rejecting Jesus.
[57:09] That was the place he was scared to be.
[57:11] Yeah.
[57:13] But something changed inside of him to
[57:15] the very place he was scared of the
[57:17] council. Amen. The Sanhedrin. Now, Amen.
[57:20] They work a mighty miracle. They they've
[57:22] got the testimony within them of Christ.
[57:25] Christ is living inside and they've got
[57:27] the witness of it. And now they're
[57:29] brought before the Sanhedrin. And when
[57:30] they're brought before the Sanhedrin,
[57:32] they're threatened.
[57:36] Listen, this isn't we're not talking
[57:38] years later.
[57:41] That's right. We're talking days later.
[57:44] Maybe weeks. I don't know how long it
[57:46] would be, but it was a short period of
[57:48] time where he was scared to death of
[57:49] this council and the high priest house.
[57:51] Not even in the Sanhedrin. He was scared
[57:53] to death to be questioned or be
[57:54] associated or be prisoned. They were
[57:56] hiding in the upper room. Now something
[57:58] changed inside of them and now there was
[58:01] nothing any man could do to them to
[58:03] change the reality that was in their
[58:04] heart. Even if you cut my head off, it
[58:06] won't change the truth that I have. Now
[58:10] they brought him to the place he was
[58:11] scared to be. And they begin to to throw
[58:13] questions at him and they begin to
[58:15] threaten him and tell him not to preach
[58:16] anymore in his name. And you know what
[58:18] Peter's answer is? Peter says, "Well,
[58:20] then you tell me, is it better that I
[58:23] obey God or that I obey man?"
[58:27] He was not intimidated. He wasn't
[58:29] afraid. Neither was he angry. Neither
[58:31] was he spitting nails at them and
[58:32] cursing them. He was just relaxed.
[58:36] Amen.
[58:39] Praise God. Amen. That's where I want to
[58:41] be. Yeah. I want to be secure in what
[58:44] Christ has done in me to the point that
[58:46] it I'm not going to become insecure at
[58:49] threats of the enemy. That's right.
[58:51] Right. Amen. Amen. Let's go to Hebrews
[58:55] chapter 12 now and look at this
[58:57] scripture that we turned to earlier.
[59:01] Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed
[59:03] about with so great a cloud of
[59:04] witnesses, let us lay aside every weight
[59:06] in the sin which does so easily beset
[59:08] us, and let us run with patience the
[59:10] race that is set before us, looking unto
[59:13] Jesus, the author and finisher of our
[59:15] faith, who for the joy that was set
[59:17] before him endured the cross, despising
[59:20] the shame, and is set down at the right
[59:22] hand of the throne of God. So now this
[59:25] becomes our example of how we should run
[59:27] our race. Yeah.
[59:29] And how? Following the example of Jesus
[59:32] Christ. Amen.
[59:34] Because for the glory that lay ahead, he
[59:38] endured the cross. And he didn't like
[59:40] it. That's why in Gethsemane, he was he
[59:43] was praying the way he was praying. He
[59:45] was despising the shame, the pain, and
[59:47] the suffering, and the
[59:49] mocking.
[59:51] But he had something greater than
[59:55] Calvary to look at to take him through
[59:57] Calvary. And that was the glory that lay
[1:00:00] ahead.
[1:00:02] And I think we have something greater to
[1:00:04] look at than our next trial.
[1:00:06] I think we all have a glory that lays
[1:00:08] ahead. I hope you believe that because
[1:00:12] if you believe that, it'll give you the
[1:00:13] strength to go through whatever comes
[1:00:15] tomorrow.
[1:00:22] Amen. Let's go to John chapter 3 now.
[1:00:32] John chapter
[1:00:34] 3 and verse
[1:00:48] 6. says that which is born of the flesh
[1:00:52] is flesh and that which is born of the
[1:00:54] spirit is spirit.
[1:00:59] So have you had the second birth?
[1:01:03] That which is born of flesh is flesh but
[1:01:05] that which is born of the spirit is
[1:01:07] spirit not flesh.
[1:01:11] Means it's greater than the flesh. It's
[1:01:15] spirit. I just like to read that again.
[1:01:18] That which is born of flesh is flesh,
[1:01:21] and that which is born of spirit, of the
[1:01:24] spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I say
[1:01:26] unto thee, thou must be born again. The
[1:01:28] wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
[1:01:30] hearest the sound thereof, but cast not
[1:01:33] tell whence it cometh, and whether it
[1:01:35] goeth. So is everyone that is born of
[1:01:38] the spirit. Amen. Everybody can see you
[1:01:41] and see your life, but they can't tell
[1:01:43] where you came from and where you're
[1:01:44] going because you're spirit. You've been
[1:01:47] born of the spirit in your spirit. It's
[1:01:49] like that little dew drop. Where did it
[1:01:50] come from? It's there now. It's gone.
[1:01:53] Where did it go?
[1:01:55] It's just like the wind. That's just
[1:01:57] like everybody that's born of the
[1:01:58] spirit. Hey, listen. We're only here a
[1:02:00] short time. We blew right in here. We're
[1:02:02] going to accomplish something for God's
[1:02:04] purpose and we're going to blow right
[1:02:05] out. And while I'm here accomplishing
[1:02:07] something for God's purpose, I I do not
[1:02:10] want to miss that purpose because of my
[1:02:12] flesh. Amen. Amen. So now I've got to
[1:02:16] take up my cross and die daily because
[1:02:20] I'm here. I came from God. I go back to
[1:02:23] God and I'm here to express something
[1:02:26] God wanted me to express in this life.
[1:02:28] In order to do that, the only way that I
[1:02:30] can properly do that is I'm going to
[1:02:32] have to die daily.
[1:02:35] So Calvary has to be more than than Good
[1:02:39] Friday.
[1:02:42] I need Good Friday every day for me
[1:02:45] because if I can have Good Friday, I can
[1:02:47] have Resurrection Sunday every day, too.
[1:02:50] Amen.
[1:02:52] Amen. Amen. And so that was the long way
[1:02:57] around.
[1:02:59] So, we just got around the cow shed.
[1:03:01] Praise God. But what I really want to
[1:03:04] talk about is the projection of the love
[1:03:05] of God. And I want to get into love for
[1:03:08] a minute because Christ was God's
[1:03:10] attribute of love displayed to the
[1:03:13] world. And now where did all that love
[1:03:16] go?
[1:03:18] It's been poured into his bride.
[1:03:21] And brother Benham says in the message,
[1:03:23] God's provided a way of approach to
[1:03:25] fellowship. Oh, here's he's still
[1:03:29] Jehovah God. Jesus Christ remains just
[1:03:31] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:03:33] Don't be afraid. Just sit still. Trust
[1:03:36] God. Believe with all your heart. Be
[1:03:38] sure of your step. Then move on with
[1:03:40] God. Pray and love him. Love is the most
[1:03:43] powerful force there is in the world.
[1:03:45] There is nothing as great as love. Power
[1:03:48] only lays in love. So I just want to
[1:03:51] talk for a little bit about the power of
[1:03:54] love. Love, brother says, most powerful
[1:03:57] force in the world. Do you believe that?
[1:04:01] It has to be true because God is love
[1:04:04] according to the scriptures.
[1:04:07] There's nothing as great as love. Power
[1:04:10] only lays in love. Then in the message
[1:04:13] conference, he says this love, God's
[1:04:15] love, love is the most powerful thing
[1:04:18] there is in the world. It conquers
[1:04:20] anything is love.
[1:04:23] By this you shall conquer by love
[1:04:25] divine, loving one another, loving the
[1:04:28] cause of God, loving Christ, loving
[1:04:30] suffering humanity. That's how you
[1:04:33] conquer. So remember, I'm not here for
[1:04:35] my purpose. I'm here for whose purpose.
[1:04:38] And the love of God is what conquers
[1:04:41] everything. So I've been put here to
[1:04:44] project his love. So I want to talk
[1:04:45] about the projection of love. If you can
[1:04:47] turn with me to 1 Corinthians 13, which
[1:04:50] is often referred to as the love
[1:04:53] chapter, we'll look at this for a
[1:04:57] minute. And when we talk about love, we
[1:05:00] all know that we're talking about God's
[1:05:02] love, not the weakness of human love,
[1:05:05] which is just a shadow of a shadow of a
[1:05:07] shadow of real love. But we're talking
[1:05:09] about genuine love. God's love. God is
[1:05:12] love. So if God is love, love is God.
[1:05:16] this kind of love. Amen. Not human love,
[1:05:19] not humanistic love. And we were going
[1:05:22] to start exploring what's so different
[1:05:23] about these two
[1:05:26] loves. In 1 Corinthians
[1:05:29] 13, we'll start at verse one. Though I
[1:05:32] speak with the tongues of men and of
[1:05:34] angels, and have not charity. Charity is
[1:05:36] love. In the King James, it's charity,
[1:05:40] but it's the same word we use for love.
[1:05:41] This is agape of love. I'm become as a
[1:05:44] sounding brass or a tinkling
[1:05:47] symbol. And though I have the gift of
[1:05:49] prophecy and understand all mysteries
[1:05:51] and all knowledge, and though I have all
[1:05:53] faith so that I could remove mountains
[1:05:55] and have not charity, have not love, I
[1:05:58] am
[1:05:58] nothing. So what is he putting the
[1:06:01] emphasis on?
[1:06:03] Love. Amen. What should we put the
[1:06:05] emphasis on?
[1:06:07] Same thing.
[1:06:09] And though I bestow all my goods to feed
[1:06:11] the poor, and though I give my body to
[1:06:13] be burned, and have not love, it
[1:06:16] profitth me
[1:06:17] nothing. Love suffereth long. So now
[1:06:20] he's going to go into attributes of
[1:06:21] love. Now we're looking at true love,
[1:06:23] God's love. Love suffereth long, and is
[1:06:28] kind. Love envieth not. Love vaunteth
[1:06:32] not itself, is not puffed up, does not
[1:06:35] behave itself unseemingly, seeketh not
[1:06:38] her own, is not easily provoked,
[1:06:41] thinkketh no evil, rejoices not in
[1:06:44] iniquity, but rejoices in the truth,
[1:06:47] beareth all things, believeth all
[1:06:50] things, hopeeth all things, endureth all
[1:06:54] things. This is God's love. This is the
[1:06:58] person of Christ. This is the fullness
[1:06:59] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:01] Now we we know in the message that
[1:07:03] brother taught stature of a perfect man
[1:07:05] and he said God was building back his
[1:07:07] bride through seven church ages or seven
[1:07:09] dispensations and he came back to the
[1:07:11] seventh with his brotherly kindness but
[1:07:13] he said there would be a capping off and
[1:07:14] a sealing of the whole thing and that
[1:07:16] capping off would be would be the Holy
[1:07:19] Ghost himself. It would be
[1:07:21] God and that capping off if you go uh to
[1:07:24] second Peter 1 that capping off is
[1:07:26] charity the same word love. So what
[1:07:29] comes down and makes the fullness of the
[1:07:32] bride manifest? It's the love of God.
[1:07:34] Amen. It's God himself. And these are
[1:07:37] the attributes of that love. It
[1:07:39] suffereth long. Means it doesn't get
[1:07:42] impatient with suffering.
[1:07:45] Now your flesh gets impatient with
[1:07:47] suffering. That's why we have to die to
[1:07:49] the flesh. But this love that's on the
[1:07:52] inside, it doesn't get impatient with
[1:07:53] suffering. It suffer long and is kind.
[1:07:58] It envth not. It vaunteth not itself. It
[1:08:02] is not puffed up. So there's no pride
[1:08:05] and there's no self- glorification in
[1:08:07] this love. It doesn't behave itself
[1:08:09] unseemingly. Seeks not her own. This is
[1:08:12] something I think so important. Seketh
[1:08:14] not her own. Is not easily provoked
[1:08:16] thinking no no evil. So this kind of
[1:08:19] love is not a selfserving love. Amen.
[1:08:23] And to me, this is what makes it so
[1:08:25] different than human love because almost
[1:08:27] all human love has some else aspect of
[1:08:30] self mixed in. But this love doesn't
[1:08:33] seek her own. This love is a love that
[1:08:36] seeks the best for the other person.
[1:08:40] So that means if this is that kind of
[1:08:42] love that seeks the best, it's the kind
[1:08:44] of love God had for the world and gave
[1:08:46] his only begotten son. That's the same
[1:08:48] kind of love. Amen. Doesn't seek their
[1:08:50] own but seeks the best for the other. to
[1:08:53] have that kind of love. I'm going to
[1:08:55] have to be willing to come become
[1:08:57] crucified to give that kind of love
[1:09:00] because now it's not about me. It's not
[1:09:02] easily provoked. It thinkketh no evil.
[1:09:05] It rejoices not in iniquity, but
[1:09:07] rejoicth in the truth. Beareth all
[1:09:10] things, believeth all things, hopeeth
[1:09:12] all things, endureth all things.
[1:09:16] So now I really am convinced more than
[1:09:18] ever that it's going to take daily dying
[1:09:20] on Calvary to express this kind of love
[1:09:23] that I in order to express all of these
[1:09:25] attributes that I have to die to the
[1:09:28] flesh man because the flesh man does not
[1:09:30] like this.
[1:09:33] Amen. So Calvary is our example. Amen.
[1:09:38] Praise God. Now I'd like to look now at
[1:09:41] the next verse. Let's go to verse eight.
[1:09:43] Charity, love never
[1:09:47] faileth. But whether there be
[1:09:48] prophecies, they shall fail. Whether
[1:09:50] there be tongues, they shall cease.
[1:09:52] Whether there be knowledge, it shall
[1:09:54] vanish away. I want to deal with two
[1:09:56] different words here. If you look at
[1:09:58] where it says whether they be
[1:09:59] prophecies, they shall fail. Amen. That
[1:10:02] that sometimes that language it can be
[1:10:04] confusing. How can true prophecy fail?
[1:10:08] Right? And how can knowledge true
[1:10:10] knowledge vanish away? But what that
[1:10:12] word actually means if you if I'm I
[1:10:13] pulled up the concordance, it means to
[1:10:16] render
[1:10:17] idol to be
[1:10:20] unemployed. At some point you won't need
[1:10:22] to employ prophecy.
[1:10:24] Amen. It will become unemployed.
[1:10:28] To render idle, unemployed, inactive,
[1:10:32] inoperative, to cause a person or thing
[1:10:34] to have no further efficiency, to
[1:10:37] deprive a force, influence, or power. So
[1:10:40] this word where it says fail, it doesn't
[1:10:41] mean that the prophecy failed. It means
[1:10:43] you've come to a time where prophecy is
[1:10:45] all fulfilled. We don't need any more
[1:10:47] prophecy. We come to a time where where
[1:10:50] God has fully expressed himself. We
[1:10:51] don't need any more knowledge. All
[1:10:53] knowledge is now fully expressed. Amen.
[1:10:56] So we don't get to a time where
[1:10:57] knowledge vanishes away. Amen. All the
[1:10:59] true knowledge now. Amen. What it is is
[1:11:02] it's unemployed. You don't need it
[1:11:04] anymore. You're looking right at it.
[1:11:06] You're looking right in the face of it.
[1:11:07] You're living in it. you fully
[1:11:08] experienced it. Amen. So though prophecy
[1:11:11] will be retired. Yeah. Whether the need
[1:11:14] for knowledge will be unemployed. Amen.
[1:11:17] Praise God. Amen. And manifestations
[1:11:21] will cease.
[1:11:23] Love will never stop. Amen. Because it's
[1:11:26] eternal. Because it's God. So this is
[1:11:28] the chief of all chief things. Amen.
[1:11:31] This word where it says love never
[1:11:34] faileth. The the word in the Greek has
[1:11:37] this
[1:11:38] definition to fall out of to fall down
[1:11:42] from to fall off. Metaphorically to fall
[1:11:44] from a thing to lose it. So when you go
[1:11:49] back charity never faileth that means
[1:11:52] charity will never fail, fall or be done
[1:11:56] away with. Charity is not going to be
[1:11:58] retired. Charity is not going to cease.
[1:12:00] Charity is not going to vanish away.
[1:12:01] Charity's never going to be unemployed
[1:12:03] because that is God. And that's why when
[1:12:05] brother Brandham went beyond the curtain
[1:12:07] of time, he said, "I was just love." It
[1:12:09] was it was just perfect love. He said,
[1:12:12] "And nothing but perfect." This is God's
[1:12:14] love. Amen. Nothing but the perfect love
[1:12:17] of God can enter in there. Amen. Because
[1:12:20] love never faileth.
[1:12:24] Praise God. Everything else will cease.
[1:12:27] Everything else will stop. Everything
[1:12:28] else will come to the end of its need.
[1:12:30] But love will will never run out of
[1:12:34] love.
[1:12:36] Will never go beyond love. Love, God's
[1:12:38] love will never stop because that was
[1:12:40] the purpose of his whole creation
[1:12:43] was to express his
[1:12:46] love. Uh let's pick this up in 1 John 4.
[1:12:50] We've quoted the scripture, but I'm just
[1:12:52] want to read it
[1:12:53] together. 1 John chapter 4.
[1:13:00] And I'm I'm still wanting to get to
[1:13:02] something. So just hang with me. All of
[1:13:04] this is good. Amen. But it's all
[1:13:07] building to a point. 1 John
[1:13:11] 4:16. And we have known and believed the
[1:13:14] love that God hath to us. God is
[1:13:17] love, and he that dwelleth in love
[1:13:20] dwelleth in God, and God in him. Now
[1:13:23] remember all the attributes of love to
[1:13:25] know what kind of love we're talking
[1:13:26] about. A love that endures. A love that
[1:13:29] suffers long. A love that thinkketh no
[1:13:30] evil. A love that beareth all. A love
[1:13:32] that is kind. A love that seeketh the
[1:13:34] truth. A love that believeth no evil. A
[1:13:37] a a love that can endure. A love that
[1:13:39] doesn't seek its own but seeks the
[1:13:41] benefit of others. So those who live in
[1:13:44] God live in this realm and God in them.
[1:13:47] And this realm lives in them. Herein is
[1:13:49] our love made perfect that we may have
[1:13:51] boldness in the day of judgment. Because
[1:13:53] as he is so are we in the world. There
[1:13:56] is no fear in love, but perfect love
[1:13:59] cast out fear, because fearth torment.
[1:14:03] He that fearth is not made perfect in
[1:14:05] love. We love him because he first loved
[1:14:11] us. So he first demonstrated his love to
[1:14:14] him us and we reciprocated our love back
[1:14:16] to him. But in this kind of love, there
[1:14:19] is no
[1:14:20] fear. I believe this is the kind of love
[1:14:23] Peter came to. Amen. and the
[1:14:25] Sanhedrin. I believe this is the kind of
[1:14:27] of love that Paul came to when he was
[1:14:30] going to the chopping block where he
[1:14:33] wasn't afraid. How could he be afraid
[1:14:37] when he was secure? Amen. How could he
[1:14:39] be afraid when he had a pure true
[1:14:42] revelation of who he was and God's plan
[1:14:43] for him and that nothing on this earth
[1:14:45] could harm him? Remember Jesus looked at
[1:14:47] his disciples and he says, "I send you
[1:14:49] out as a sheep among wolves. Amen. But
[1:14:51] have no fear. have overcome the world
[1:14:52] and nothing shall by any means harm
[1:14:55] thee. Remember he said that you know you
[1:14:58] could get the wrong understanding of
[1:15:00] what he said. You could walk out and
[1:15:01] say, "Oh, hey amen. I'm invincible.
[1:15:04] Nothing will ever harm me." And then
[1:15:06] they saw Steven stoned to death. What do
[1:15:08] you think they were thinking then?
[1:15:10] Those rocks were bouncing off of his
[1:15:12] head and cracking and crushing his skull
[1:15:14] until he laid there dead. Yeah. All the
[1:15:17] disciples except John were were were
[1:15:19] were were uh uh were were killed, were
[1:15:22] martyed. Amen. Uh Paul had his head
[1:15:24] chopped off. Peter was crucified upside
[1:15:26] down. There's all kinds of traditions
[1:15:28] that tell us how everybody else met
[1:15:29] their demise. Amen. But John, he died of
[1:15:32] old age. And he says, "Nothing by any
[1:15:34] means shall ever harm thee." Amen. Oh, I
[1:15:37] think he's talking about that little bit
[1:15:38] of congealed atmosphere that's come down
[1:15:41] that nothing can harm that. Nothing can
[1:15:43] touch that. that life, that real you,
[1:15:46] that really turner, that that really
[1:15:48] eternal part of God that is meant to be
[1:15:50] you. Yeah. Because nothing shall harm
[1:15:54] thee. Listen, I want to say it like
[1:15:57] this. Nothing shall harm you.
[1:16:00] Praise God.
[1:16:02] But this happened to me and that
[1:16:04] happened to me and that. Listen, you're
[1:16:06] only in this flesh for a short period of
[1:16:08] time. and you're here to serve God's
[1:16:10] purpose and nothing's going to stop that
[1:16:12] purpose and nothing's going to harm you.
[1:16:14] If this flesh comes to a demise and
[1:16:16] someday and is burn at the stake and
[1:16:18] that didn't hurt you, right? Amen.
[1:16:22] Seconds later when you wind up in the
[1:16:23] sixth dimension, you're going to be
[1:16:24] like, "Jesus was absolutely right.
[1:16:27] There's nothing that can hurt me because
[1:16:30] I have eternal life." Amen. I have an
[1:16:32] attribute of God inside. Amen. And when
[1:16:35] we have this kind of revelation, then we
[1:16:37] don't need to get jolted about and
[1:16:39] tossed about by fears and rumors and all
[1:16:42] these things that trouble us so bad.
[1:16:45] We've got to go to a higher realm of
[1:16:47] living in order to live the right kind
[1:16:50] of life.
[1:16:51] It's not that we don't get shocked and
[1:16:53] our systems went. That's part of living
[1:16:55] a human life. It's not that we don't get
[1:16:57] discouraged or we don't get anxiety and
[1:16:59] we don't have things happening. It's not
[1:17:00] that our blood pressure never rises and
[1:17:02] our pulse never quickens. It's not any
[1:17:04] of those. But there's there's another
[1:17:06] truth that can subside all of that.
[1:17:08] Amen. What seems to be truth around me
[1:17:10] needs to be subdued by what's ultimately
[1:17:13] true. That's right. Amen. Amen. Is that
[1:17:15] God just wants to manifest himself in
[1:17:17] me.
[1:17:23] Amen.
[1:17:25] Amen. Let's while we're in First John,
[1:17:27] let's go to chapter 5, verse one.
[1:17:35] So John 5:1, "Whosoever believeth that
[1:17:38] Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and
[1:17:40] everyone that loveth him that begat
[1:17:43] loveth him also that is begotten of him.
[1:17:46] By this we know that we love the
[1:17:48] children of God when we love God and
[1:17:50] keep his commandments. For this is the
[1:17:52] love of God, that we keep his
[1:17:54] commandments, and his comm his
[1:17:55] commandments are not grievious. For
[1:17:57] whatsoever is born of God overcomemeth
[1:18:00] the world. Catch it. Verse four.
[1:18:03] Whatsoever is born of God overcomemeth
[1:18:06] the world. Amen. So will the world ever
[1:18:09] overcome you? No. Because you've been
[1:18:13] born of God. Whatsoever is born of God
[1:18:16] overcometh the world. And this is the
[1:18:18] victory that overcometh the world, even
[1:18:20] our faith. Amen. It's our faith that
[1:18:23] overcomes the world. But Galatians tell
[1:18:25] us that faith workketh by love. Amen. We
[1:18:29] believe because God first loved us. We
[1:18:31] love God because he first loved us. And
[1:18:33] that love of God expressed in our heart,
[1:18:35] shed abroad in our heart. Amen. Brings
[1:18:37] the reality of the truth to our hearts.
[1:18:40] And now we overcome by faith. This is
[1:18:42] the victory that overcome the world.
[1:18:44] Faith. What faith? I know where I came
[1:18:47] from. I know who I am. I know where I'm
[1:18:51] going. And that gives me the power to
[1:18:53] overcome the world. And I don't think
[1:18:55] it's the power to overcome the world
[1:18:57] like we become superheroes with S's on
[1:19:00] our chest and we go and we we speak
[1:19:02] things out of existence. No. The
[1:19:05] scripture says all that is in the world
[1:19:08] is the lust of the flesh, the lust of
[1:19:10] the eyes, the pride of life. That's all
[1:19:13] that's in the world. That's what James
[1:19:14] tells us is all that's in the world is
[1:19:17] these things. And what are where do
[1:19:19] those things lie? The lust of the flesh,
[1:19:21] the lust of the eyes, the pride of life.
[1:19:23] Where is that manifesting? So where is
[1:19:25] where is the
[1:19:27] world? Is it
[1:19:29] Walmart? Is the world the street? Is the
[1:19:32] world?
[1:19:34] No. The world is the elements that's
[1:19:36] working in the flesh.
[1:19:38] The lust of the eyes, the lust of the
[1:19:40] flesh, the pride of life. Amen. And so
[1:19:44] what overcomes that world? What
[1:19:47] overcomes the world? faith that workketh
[1:19:50] by love. I can overcome lust of the
[1:19:54] flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of life
[1:19:56] that's trying to move me in wrong
[1:19:59] directions from the word of God, trying
[1:20:01] by fear or anxiety or lust or desire or
[1:20:04] whatever to move me. I can overcome that
[1:20:07] by faith that workketh by love. But he's
[1:20:11] that born of God overcometh the world.
[1:20:14] We've not been left unequipped.
[1:20:18] Unequipped. We have what we need.
[1:20:23] Amen. Let's go to second Timothy
[1:20:32] 3. 2 Timothy
[1:20:35] 3 1.
[1:20:43] 2 Timothy 3:1 says, "This, know also
[1:20:46] that in the last days perilous times
[1:20:48] shall come." Are we in the last days?
[1:20:51] Amen. For men shall be lovers of their
[1:20:54] own
[1:20:56] selves. This is the opposite of God's
[1:20:59] love. Amen. Because God's love doesn't
[1:21:01] seek her own but others. So these are
[1:21:05] the attributes lovers of their own
[1:21:07] selves. Covetous, boasters, proud,
[1:21:11] blasphemers, disobedient appearance,
[1:21:14] unthankful, unholy, without natural
[1:21:16] affection, truce breakers, false
[1:21:19] accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers
[1:21:22] of those that are good, traitors, heady,
[1:21:26] high-minded, lovers of pleasure more
[1:21:28] than lovers of
[1:21:30] God. That sounds like a list of
[1:21:33] attributes opposite to the one in 1
[1:21:35] Corinthians 13.
[1:21:37] This is the
[1:21:39] world. This is the product of the world.
[1:21:42] And this is what's trying to work on you
[1:21:44] all the time to get these attributes to
[1:21:46] display. Lovers of their own selves. But
[1:21:49] the love of God doesn't seek her own,
[1:21:51] seeks the benefit of others. Amen. Is
[1:21:54] patient, long-suffering,
[1:21:57] kind. Amen. So this is the condition in
[1:22:01] the end time. Brother Benham said in the
[1:22:02] end time, the only place there'll be
[1:22:04] true love is in the bride.
[1:22:06] true love. The kind of love that he had,
[1:22:10] sacrificial
[1:22:14] love. Amen. Let's go to Mark
[1:22:29] 10. Mark 10.
[1:22:36] In verse
[1:22:41] 21 says this is when the rich young
[1:22:44] ruler comes to Jesus and asks him what
[1:22:46] must I do to inherit eternal life and
[1:22:48] Jesus tells him you know the
[1:22:50] commandments do this this and this and
[1:22:52] and he says I've done all of those from
[1:22:54] the youth yet what lackth I Jesus is
[1:22:58] going to tell him and verse 20 says then
[1:23:00] Jesus beholding him loved
[1:23:03] him. So Jesus is going to express love
[1:23:06] to this young man. Jesus beholding him
[1:23:09] loved him and said unto him, "One thing
[1:23:12] thou lackest. Go thy way, sell
[1:23:14] whatsoever thou hast and give to the
[1:23:16] poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
[1:23:18] heaven, and come take up the cross and
[1:23:21] follow me." And he was sad at that
[1:23:24] saying, and went away grieved, for he
[1:23:26] had great possessions.
[1:23:29] In the end time, people will be lovers
[1:23:30] of themselves more than lovers of
[1:23:32] God. This young man, he wanted eternal
[1:23:36] life and he wanted to have eternal life.
[1:23:38] He he is like so many people, they want
[1:23:40] the reward of Christianity, but they
[1:23:42] don't want any personal sacrifice. They
[1:23:45] don't want cal they want Jesus's
[1:23:47] Calvary. They don't want their own
[1:23:48] Calvary.
[1:23:50] And so now he he asks Jesus this
[1:23:52] question and and Jesus begins to uh
[1:23:55] answer the question and he thinks he's
[1:23:57] okay. what what lack I what what lack
[1:23:59] thou I Jesus beholding him loved him. So
[1:24:04] when Jesus told him where his lack was
[1:24:06] where his real problem lay and what did
[1:24:08] he need need to become free. Amen. This
[1:24:11] was an expression of love and we learned
[1:24:14] from brother Brandham that love is
[1:24:15] corrective. Amen. Why? Because love
[1:24:18] doesn't seek their own. Love is not
[1:24:20] corrective just to be corrective. Love
[1:24:22] is corrective for the benefit of the
[1:24:24] other person. That's true correction in
[1:24:27] love. Amen. Sometimes people like to be
[1:24:30] corrective and they're not loving. Yeah.
[1:24:32] Because they like to be the one who
[1:24:33] knows everything and be critical and
[1:24:35] correct. This wasn't a critical spirit.
[1:24:37] This was Jesus looking at him, loving
[1:24:39] him, saying, "Listen, friend, there's
[1:24:40] one thing thou lackest if you'll go and
[1:24:42] sell everything you own." Amen. So Jesus
[1:24:45] was loving him. But this man couldn't
[1:24:47] receive that kind of love. Amen.
[1:24:51] Because he was a lover of his own self.
[1:24:54] And this is the condition we find
[1:24:55] ourselves in in the end time. But Jesus
[1:24:58] demonstrated a different kind of
[1:25:00] love. Amen. So love is honest. So this
[1:25:06] kind of love that's in the bride to
[1:25:07] project this kind of love in the bride.
[1:25:10] Amen. Cannot be intimidated. Cannot be
[1:25:13] scared. Amen. Doesn't seek its own. Is
[1:25:16] not believing in evil. Restethth in
[1:25:18] truth. Amen. Can beareth all things.
[1:25:21] This kind of love that's in the bride is
[1:25:23] a superpower. Amen. And we're going to
[1:25:26] get some quotes, brother. It's a
[1:25:27] superpower. This kind of love because
[1:25:30] this kind of love, you're not seeking
[1:25:32] your own. You're seeking someone else.
[1:25:33] And when you're corrective and when
[1:25:34] you're honest, you're doing it for the
[1:25:36] benefit of somebody else, not for your
[1:25:38] own benefit. Amen. And that's the kind
[1:25:40] of love Jesus
[1:25:42] expressed. And the love of God, the
[1:25:45] Bible tells us the love of God, God
[1:25:48] commended his love towards us. and while
[1:25:50] we were sinners, yet he loved us. So
[1:25:52] God's love goes first and goes for the
[1:25:54] benefit of somebody else. That's the
[1:25:55] kind of love that we're supposed to
[1:25:57] express. Not the kind of love that is
[1:26:00] self-
[1:26:02] serving. Brother Bram said, "And show us
[1:26:04] the father." He said, "That's the reason
[1:26:07] Jesus said, and I believe if you get
[1:26:08] somebody, you can love anybody that
[1:26:11] loves you. But can you love those who do
[1:26:14] not love
[1:26:15] you?" That's the spirit of Christ. See,
[1:26:19] when those will
[1:26:21] those when those will mistreat you and
[1:26:24] say evil against you and from your heart
[1:26:26] you still love them, then you know
[1:26:28] you're getting close to the kingdom.
[1:26:30] Then yes, this is why I started off with
[1:26:33] crucifixion.
[1:26:35] Not just Jesus' crucifixion, but
[1:26:38] ours. Because he said th when those will
[1:26:42] mistreat you and say evil against
[1:26:46] you and from your heart you still love
[1:26:50] them. Listen there there's no way you
[1:26:52] can do that unless you've went to
[1:26:54] Calvary.
[1:26:56] Amen. In your flesh you can't do that.
[1:27:00] Your flesh isn't wired that way.
[1:27:02] Your flesh is a lover of its own self.
[1:27:06] Your old man, your old nature, your
[1:27:08] outer two realms, it's a lover of its
[1:27:10] own self. That has to be crucified for
[1:27:13] this kind of love to express.
[1:27:16] That's why for us, friends, Calvary is
[1:27:18] every day. And it's more personal than
[1:27:20] we think.
[1:27:22] It's not just I'm waiting for the great
[1:27:25] persecution to come.
[1:27:28] No, it's can I
[1:27:30] die to all the world that's around me?
[1:27:33] The lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh,
[1:27:34] pride of life, and can I manifest all
[1:27:36] the attributes of love? For God is love.
[1:27:39] This is the capping time.
[1:27:42] When those will mistreat you and say
[1:27:44] evil against you from your heart and
[1:27:46] from your heart you still love them,
[1:27:48] then you know that you're getting close
[1:27:50] to the kingdom. Then he didn't even say
[1:27:53] you arrived. He said you're just getting
[1:27:54] close.
[1:27:56] How many want to get closer? I want to
[1:27:58] get closer. It's going to take more
[1:28:00] Calvary for me.
[1:28:04] John 15. Let's turn to the Gospel of
[1:28:06] John.
[1:28:18] John
[1:28:21] 15
[1:28:24] 12 he said, "This is my commandment that
[1:28:27] you love one another as I have loved
[1:28:29] you. Greater love hath no man than this,
[1:28:32] that a man lay down his life for his
[1:28:35] friends." This is the greatest of all
[1:28:38] love.
[1:28:39] The greatest of all love is when you
[1:28:41] sacrifice yourself for somebody else.
[1:28:46] They spit on Jesus and he didn't spit
[1:28:48] back. They mocked and he didn't mock
[1:28:50] back. They accused but he didn't even
[1:28:52] defend himself. What was that? That was
[1:28:54] the love of God. And why was he enduring
[1:28:58] that? For them, not for
[1:29:02] him. And if he can do that, what am I
[1:29:05] supposed to do? his bride representing
[1:29:08] him on this earth. I'm gonna have to go
[1:29:10] back to Calvary once again. You know
[1:29:13] what's going to happen the next time you
[1:29:14] hear somebody said something evil about
[1:29:16] you? You're going to have to go to
[1:29:18] Calvary. And you're going to have to
[1:29:20] nail yourself back to the cross and say,
[1:29:22] "It doesn't matter. I'm nothing
[1:29:24] anyways."
[1:29:26] God forgive them. They don't know what
[1:29:29] they're doing. Amen.
[1:29:32] No greater love hath no man than this,
[1:29:34] that he laid down his life for his
[1:29:37] friends. This is the greatest expression
[1:29:39] of love that you can ever have is when
[1:29:41] you surrender your own self for somebody
[1:29:45] else for love's sake. Because love
[1:29:48] doesn't seek her
[1:29:51] own. I find so many times most of what
[1:29:54] we do has a selfish motive behind it.
[1:29:56] But I praise God that he's exposing
[1:29:58] those things so that we can get beyond
[1:30:00] them. Friends, we can go beyond
[1:30:03] those. In the message that day on
[1:30:05] Calvary, he said, somebody said, "How
[1:30:07] can you stand and let anybody call you
[1:30:09] such bad names?" I want to wrap it up
[1:30:11] with these few quotes from brother
[1:30:12] Brandham. He said, "How can you stand
[1:30:15] and let anybody call you such bad names?
[1:30:17] And you don't." He said, and this is his
[1:30:19] answer, "You don't live for yourself.
[1:30:22] You live for others that you might
[1:30:24] redeem that man. You become sons. And
[1:30:26] the trouble of it is the church has
[1:30:28] forgot they were sons. You are sons.
[1:30:30] You're taking Christ's place. You are
[1:30:32] sons. So don't live for yourself. Live
[1:30:35] for others. Well, brother Brandham, I
[1:30:37] can live for this brother because he
[1:30:39] sure is a nice man. That's not it. Live
[1:30:41] for that man who hates you. Amen. Live
[1:30:44] for that person who'd kill you if he
[1:30:45] could. That's what they done to him.
[1:30:47] They killed him and he died that he
[1:30:49] might save them. That's eternal life.
[1:30:51] When you get that, that's when that's in
[1:30:53] your bosom. You're facing heaven then,
[1:30:56] but you sacrifice your own things. Give
[1:30:58] them up like the sheep gives its wool.
[1:31:00] You look on towards Calvary.
[1:31:03] How can we do this? How can we live such
[1:31:06] a way to be tramped on and talked about
[1:31:08] and spit on and mocked and misused and
[1:31:10] and all of those things happen? Has that
[1:31:13] ever happened to you? Amen. They happen.
[1:31:16] This is part of an earthly existence.
[1:31:18] This is part of the devil trying to get
[1:31:19] at you. These things happen. But but in
[1:31:22] the reality when you've got that
[1:31:24] revelation of that dew
[1:31:26] drop now what they did may hurt what
[1:31:29] they did may sting. It was wrong. It
[1:31:31] wasn't right. It's wrong in every way.
[1:31:34] But for me it doesn't matter because I'm
[1:31:36] going home. That person may not be able
[1:31:39] to go where I'm going. They may not have
[1:31:41] what I have. So my love is a love of
[1:31:44] understanding and revelation. And I'm
[1:31:46] not going to condemn them. And I'm not
[1:31:48] going to ask God to condemn them. I'm
[1:31:49] gonna stand in the gap because I'm
[1:31:51] secure in who I am. I'm gonna stand in
[1:31:54] the gap for this one and say, "Father,
[1:31:55] forgive them. I don't think they know
[1:31:57] what they're doing." And don't hold them
[1:31:59] accountable for what they said to me. I
[1:32:01] want them to go free because I've got
[1:32:03] this revelation of where I came from and
[1:32:05] where I'm going. And I'm only here, Hey,
[1:32:07] listen friends. I'm probably only going
[1:32:08] to be here for a handful more decades at
[1:32:10] the most. Hey, but I don't know what's
[1:32:12] going to happen to the people who mock
[1:32:14] and scorge and say whatever. So, I want
[1:32:16] to stand in the gap because I know where
[1:32:18] I came from and I know where I'm going
[1:32:19] and I'm secure in the love of God. And
[1:32:21] what I want to do is project his love.
[1:32:24] Because when love projects, sovereign
[1:32:25] grace takes its place. But you know what
[1:32:28] the enemy wants to do? He wants to take
[1:32:30] the pure love of God and mix it with
[1:32:32] humanism. And he wants to taint the
[1:32:33] expression of Christ in this day.
[1:32:37] Doesn't mean we can't be honest. Jesus
[1:32:39] was honest. Was Jesus honest? Amen. But
[1:32:42] I don't think Jesus was ever honest to
[1:32:45] stick it to somebody. I don't think he
[1:32:47] was ever honest to prove he knew more
[1:32:49] than them because he could have done
[1:32:51] that easy. Jesus could have nailed
[1:32:53] somebody to the wall and he could have
[1:32:54] loaded them with so many scriptures they
[1:32:56] didn't know what to do. But when they
[1:32:57] come to when they come to trap him, he
[1:32:59] would say, "Well, you asked me a
[1:33:00] question, I'll ask you a question."
[1:33:03] It was never debate. It was always about
[1:33:06] amen spreading the truth. And if he
[1:33:08] corrected, he corrected for the right
[1:33:09] reasons. Amen. That's the kind of life
[1:33:11] that we're supposed to live on this
[1:33:13] earth, not seeking our own. But if
[1:33:15] there's correction, there's correction
[1:33:16] for the other person,
[1:33:19] not for me. Yeah. Because I'm secure. I
[1:33:23] don't need I want to live like Jesus. I
[1:33:25] don't need to defend myself. I don't
[1:33:26] need to prove anything. I don't need to
[1:33:28] get angry. I don't need to go upset
[1:33:30] because these people who are hissing at
[1:33:32] me through their teeth, they're going to
[1:33:34] suffer the consequences of not receiving
[1:33:36] love. Yeah. Amen. But I've already
[1:33:39] received his love and I don't need to
[1:33:44] respond to the devil's tempting
[1:33:48] to pull me out of this atmosphere of
[1:33:50] love. Amen.
[1:33:54] See, I don't think we realize what we
[1:33:57] really are in what God's trying to
[1:33:59] express through us every
[1:34:01] day. And we get in all kinds of bad
[1:34:04] situations.
[1:34:06] We get in all kinds of family
[1:34:08] situations, work situations, situations
[1:34:11] in the church. We get in all kinds of
[1:34:12] situations
[1:34:14] because God wants to express love. Jesus
[1:34:18] was in all kinds of situations.
[1:34:20] But if we don't pay attention, the devil
[1:34:23] is going to actually trip us up and
[1:34:26] we're not going to react in the right
[1:34:27] kind of love, but we're going to react
[1:34:28] in a human love and start defending
[1:34:31] ourselves and
[1:34:33] start proving
[1:34:36] correcting. I don't want to be like
[1:34:38] that. I don't want to I I found another
[1:34:42] power that's more powerful than being
[1:34:45] right.
[1:34:48] It's the love of God. Amen.
[1:34:50] I found a power and a life that's more
[1:34:54] important than protecting my
[1:34:57] reputation. That's the love of
[1:34:59] God. And that's what I want to
[1:35:03] express.
[1:35:05] Amen. Matthew 5. Let's go here. I just
[1:35:08] want to read a couple more
[1:35:10] scriptures and drive this home to our
[1:35:14] hearts.
[1:35:17] Matthew 5 verse
[1:35:24] 43. We have heard that it hath been
[1:35:26] said, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor and
[1:35:28] hate thine enemy." But I say unto you,
[1:35:30] "Love your enemies, bless them that
[1:35:33] curse you, do good to them that hate
[1:35:35] you, and pray for them which
[1:35:37] despitefully use you and persecute you,
[1:35:39] that you may be the children of your
[1:35:42] father which is in heaven. For he maketh
[1:35:45] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:35:47] good, and sendeth rain on the just and
[1:35:49] on the unjust. For if you love them
[1:35:52] which love you, what reward have you? Do
[1:35:54] not even the publicans the same? If you
[1:35:57] salute your brethren only, what what do
[1:35:59] you more than others? Do not even the
[1:36:01] publicans so but ye there be therefore
[1:36:04] perfect, even as your father which is in
[1:36:05] heaven is perfect.
[1:36:09] So, I'm supposed to bless them that
[1:36:12] curse me and do good to them that hate
[1:36:14] me and pray for them that despitefully
[1:36:16] use me and persecute me that I might be
[1:36:20] children, a child of my father, so that
[1:36:23] I can reflect his nature, not my
[1:36:27] own. Amen. Brother Brenham says in the
[1:36:30] message Blind
[1:36:32] Barnameus, he says, "Friend, I'm I'm not
[1:36:35] no little boy no more. I've seen many
[1:36:38] tests, but I've never seen nothing yet
[1:36:40] could override love. It just takes
[1:36:43] everything out of the way. Love conquers
[1:36:46] wild animals. Love conquers. It's just
[1:36:49] the most conquering force there is
[1:36:51] because it's
[1:36:53] God. What in humanity sometimes looks
[1:36:57] like the weakest force is actually the
[1:36:59] strongest
[1:37:01] force. Because with the love of God in
[1:37:04] my
[1:37:04] heart, you can do me all the wrong you
[1:37:07] want, but I won't do you wrong.
[1:37:10] Which means love is more powerful than
[1:37:12] the evil that's afflicted upon me.
[1:37:16] You realize this kind of love puts you
[1:37:18] in a greater power than any power that
[1:37:21] the devil has. Because every power that
[1:37:24] the devil has is related to humanity and
[1:37:27] to the world, to the lust of the flesh,
[1:37:29] the pride of life, and the lust of the
[1:37:31] eyes. But this kind of love can give you
[1:37:33] power over every power of the devil. He
[1:37:36] is powerless in the face of perfect love
[1:37:39] because you can persecute it, it will
[1:37:42] love you anyways. You can speak evil
[1:37:43] against it, it'll love you anyways.
[1:37:45] That's why they had to kill the
[1:37:47] disciples because they couldn't do
[1:37:49] anything to control the disciples
[1:37:50] because the disciples were controlled by
[1:37:52] love. And no matter how much you
[1:37:54] persecute them, threaten them, and mock
[1:37:55] them, they're just going to keep out
[1:37:56] giving out love and giving out the word.
[1:37:58] Amen. not being afraid because they were
[1:38:00] secure in the love of God.
[1:38:03] Amen. They couldn't threat them. They
[1:38:04] couldn't control them. They couldn't do
[1:38:05] anything with them. So eventually they
[1:38:07] had to eliminate them. Why? Because
[1:38:09] their power was greater than the power
[1:38:11] of threats. The power of mocking, the
[1:38:13] power of scorging, the power of all
[1:38:15] these powers. They had a power inside of
[1:38:17] them that was greater. And friends, if
[1:38:19] somebody comes and ridicules you and
[1:38:21] calls you names and you turn around and
[1:38:23] call them names back, you just submitted
[1:38:25] to that power. That power then dominated
[1:38:28] you and was more powerful than you.
[1:38:30] Amen. If somebody gossips about you and
[1:38:32] you gossip back, you come under that
[1:38:34] power. Somebody criticize you, you
[1:38:36] criticize back, they argue with you, you
[1:38:37] argue back, you've come under their
[1:38:39] power. But with this kind of power, you
[1:38:41] can subdue all of those powers. Amen.
[1:38:44] Because if somebody comes and they do
[1:38:46] you wrong and you do them good, they
[1:38:47] have no clue what to do next. Yeah.
[1:38:50] Because the power is only in the
[1:38:52] criticism and the power is only in the
[1:38:54] mocking and the power is only in the
[1:38:57] manipulation.
[1:38:59] But when you return evil, when you
[1:39:01] return good for evil, evil doesn't know
[1:39:04] what to do. Cuz evil only knows
[1:39:07] escalating evil. Yeah. Right. But I'm
[1:39:10] not playing the devil's game anymore
[1:39:12] because I'm going to Calvary and I want
[1:39:14] to receive the love of God. And when
[1:39:15] evil comes, I want the love of God to
[1:39:17] conquer that evil. It doesn't matter
[1:39:19] what it looks like for me anymore.
[1:39:21] Because inside of me, if I can die to
[1:39:24] Chad Lamb and I can pull this flesh down
[1:39:27] and I cannot give into the lust of the
[1:39:29] flesh, lust of the eyes and lust of the
[1:39:30] pride of life and somebody can say and I
[1:39:33] don't say back, I just won inside my
[1:39:36] heart and I say, "Thank you, Lord
[1:39:37] Jesus." If it doesn't matter what
[1:39:40] everybody else thinks, everybody else
[1:39:41] thinks, "Well, he didn't have anything
[1:39:43] good to say. There's no rebuttal. He
[1:39:45] lost the debate. I want to lose the
[1:39:47] debate.
[1:39:49] Because if I lost the debate, I
[1:39:51] conquered me.
[1:39:54] Amen. And the devil didn't win, right?
[1:39:58] Amen.
[1:40:02] Hey, this is more real than any real
[1:40:07] out
[1:40:08] there. This is the way that we will
[1:40:11] overcome by divine love. Amen. Amen.
[1:40:14] Brother Brandon was told when he chose
[1:40:17] the harder way and he did so of his
[1:40:18] choosing, this would bring a great
[1:40:20] victory and love divine.
[1:40:23] Well, listen, these are the attributes
[1:40:24] of divine love, friends. Where there's a
[1:40:27] people that going to be on the earth
[1:40:28] that will not be controlled by evil.
[1:40:33] Will not be tossed about. I mean, you
[1:40:35] can be in prison. That's fine. But that
[1:40:37] doesn't control me.
[1:40:40] Because the the the only way I lose
[1:40:43] control is if I respond to the evil with
[1:40:46] evil. And then I've lost the battle.
[1:40:50] All the things that the devil's trying
[1:40:52] to do is trying to pull us away from
[1:40:54] perfect love into humanism.
[1:40:59] But God is pouring his love into us. And
[1:41:01] he's giving us the power to operate in
[1:41:03] the simplicity of love because of a
[1:41:06] revelation. And I believe it's the
[1:41:08] revelation of this hour that is giving
[1:41:11] us the power just to
[1:41:13] die, just to surrender to when it gets
[1:41:17] to the place where it to me it doesn't
[1:41:21] matter
[1:41:22] anymore what you say or what you do to
[1:41:25] me. What matters to me more than
[1:41:27] anything else is what I say and do back
[1:41:29] to you.
[1:41:31] Amen. that I want this to be a
[1:41:33] tabernacle for the Holy Ghost, not a
[1:41:36] tool for the devil.
[1:41:40] And if I can act in
[1:41:43] love, then all of a sudden, I'm acting
[1:41:46] in the greatest power the world has ever
[1:41:48] known. And this is a power that can
[1:41:50] never be controlled by evil. There's no
[1:41:54] evil that can control God's love. Amen.
[1:42:00] Sometimes people want power, but that
[1:42:02] power sometimes is so evil because it's
[1:42:05] rooted in self.
[1:42:07] Amen. And power that's rooted in self is
[1:42:10] evil and becomes evil. Even if it's good
[1:42:14] things.
[1:42:15] But this kind of power is selfless and
[1:42:19] it denies self and becomes the greatest
[1:42:22] power the world has ever known. And this
[1:42:24] is the power that conquers all other
[1:42:27] powers.
[1:42:29] It it is the neutralizer to every weapon
[1:42:32] of the devil. Amen. Think of a weapon
[1:42:35] that he can throw at you that perfect
[1:42:38] love doesn't neutralize.
[1:42:40] You know, even when the devil brings
[1:42:42] sickness to your body, what he's really
[1:42:44] trying to do is get you to be afraid.
[1:42:48] More than anything, he wants you to be
[1:42:49] afraid. He wants you to be afraid of
[1:42:51] your life, of your health, of of death.
[1:42:54] He wants you to have fear. Amen. But
[1:42:56] when you perfectly see yourself in the
[1:42:58] hand of God and God orchestrating your
[1:42:59] life and everything that happens,
[1:43:01] crossing God's desk and him signing off
[1:43:02] on it and everything being for good and
[1:43:04] not evil, all of a sudden that sickness
[1:43:07] doesn't scare you anymore because I have
[1:43:09] more faith in the love of my father than
[1:43:11] in this attack of the enemy. But the
[1:43:14] attack was through fear. So when I jump
[1:43:17] to fear,
[1:43:19] I just begin to lose the battle.
[1:43:23] Doesn't mean you won't contest with
[1:43:24] fear.
[1:43:25] But you got to fight against it and
[1:43:27] realize that's evil. Amen. God has given
[1:43:30] me a revelation in this in this message
[1:43:32] in this hour so that I could rise above
[1:43:34] fear that I could rise above favor that
[1:43:38] I could rise above these things and love
[1:43:41] conquers. Brother man makes this
[1:43:43] statement and God's projecting his love
[1:43:46] from 57. He said God projects his love
[1:43:49] and his his love makes you what you are.
[1:43:51] Amen. And there's many things we could
[1:43:53] say about it. I'm just going to let my
[1:43:55] collar down as it was for a few minutes
[1:43:57] and tell you my Canadian friends some of
[1:44:00] the inside. If you if you'll excuse me
[1:44:03] uh as a personal testimony, I want to
[1:44:05] let you know something on the inside of
[1:44:07] my life that I found because it seems
[1:44:09] very fitting right at this time. Many
[1:44:12] people wonder what takes place, think
[1:44:15] it's some sort of mystic. It isn't. It's
[1:44:19] love. So, Brother Ram's letting them in
[1:44:21] on his secret. Yes. The secret of the
[1:44:24] operation of his gift. The secret of the
[1:44:25] healing. It looks like it's some mystic.
[1:44:28] It isn't. It's love. That's the main
[1:44:31] thing is loving Christ. Not just saying
[1:44:33] you do, but from your heart love him.
[1:44:35] I've seen the crulest of devils
[1:44:37] conquered. I've seen wild animals floor
[1:44:40] themselves in the presence of God's
[1:44:42] love. Love casteth the fear away.
[1:44:47] Brother man makes some tremendous
[1:44:49] statements about this
[1:44:53] love
[1:44:54] and he talks about the maniac in Oregon
[1:44:58] in this next quote where the man was
[1:44:59] going to knock him off the platform
[1:45:01] going to punch him. He hated
[1:45:03] preachers. He said while speaking on
[1:45:05] faith this big fellow come down through
[1:45:07] the building run up to the platform like
[1:45:09] that and all of the preachers just
[1:45:11] scattered. They knowed him. And he said
[1:45:13] you snake in the He said you snake in
[1:45:15] the grass. you hypocrite. And he said,
[1:45:17] "You are out here imposing yourself as a
[1:45:20] servant of God. I'll show you how much
[1:45:22] man of God you are. I'll break every
[1:45:24] bone in that little frail body." This is
[1:45:28] Brother Brandham. This man was over 6'
[1:45:30] tall, 200 some pounds. Brother Brandham
[1:45:31] was 5'6. He was when he was in the
[1:45:33] campaign. Sometimes he get down to 150
[1:45:35] pounds. Amen. And and and I don't know
[1:45:39] about you, but if this big man comes at
[1:45:40] me and he's going to knock me out, I
[1:45:42] mean, my first reaction is
[1:45:45] He's going to get it back.
[1:45:47] But that's the reaction the devil wants
[1:45:49] us to take.
[1:45:51] That's exactly the reason the devil came
[1:45:53] that way to get you to respond in like
[1:45:55] manner. But to have more power over the
[1:45:57] devil is to choose a different response,
[1:46:01] brother Bernie. And he now this is what
[1:46:03] he says now. He was well able to do it.
[1:46:07] And he walked up to me with his hands
[1:46:08] like this, his teeth set together. And
[1:46:10] when he got to me, Brother Vanom makes
[1:46:12] the sound of spitting. He says, "Right
[1:46:15] in my face." Brother man makes that
[1:46:16] noise and he spits right in his face.
[1:46:18] And if you remember the tape, the noise
[1:46:21] he made wasn't pleasant.
[1:46:24] Right in my face. I just stood looking
[1:46:26] at him. You know what? I wished I could
[1:46:30] always feel like I did
[1:46:32] then. And instead of despising that man,
[1:46:35] instead of hating that man, I felt sorry
[1:46:37] for
[1:46:38] him. I loved
[1:46:42] him. Why? I
[1:46:44] thought, listen to where brother Bam's
[1:46:46] thinking goes. That man don't want to be
[1:46:49] like that. No matter what he said, it's
[1:46:52] not him talking like that. He wants to
[1:46:55] be a normal man. He wants to love his
[1:46:57] babies. And his wife is a sweetheart. He
[1:46:59] wants to come in have a night and take
[1:47:01] up his little babies and play with them
[1:47:03] and go out and work and come in and put
[1:47:05] his arms around his wife and have a home
[1:47:07] like any other man. And that's not that
[1:47:10] man. He'd be my brother. That's the
[1:47:13] devil in that poor fella.
[1:47:17] How many of you believe Brother Ram
[1:47:18] passed the test?
[1:47:23] But in order to pass the test, he had to
[1:47:25] crucify his flesh because he had some
[1:47:28] training as a boxer and he had some
[1:47:30] abilities. Yeah. Right. Right.
[1:47:33] But none of those abilities would have
[1:47:35] been God. Yeah. Right. He may have been
[1:47:37] able to defend himself and hold him off
[1:47:39] till the police got there. But that
[1:47:41] wasn't God. God was projecting
[1:47:45] love. And brother said something came
[1:47:48] over him. This was more than just
[1:47:50] thoughts. This was the love of God had
[1:47:52] poured over him. And he said, "Oh, I
[1:47:55] wish I could always feel the way I felt
[1:47:57] then." Instead of despising that man or
[1:48:00] hating him, instead of being offended at
[1:48:03] what he was saying to him, Brother
[1:48:05] Brandham wasn't dealing with feelings of
[1:48:07] offense and he wasn't dealing with any
[1:48:09] fear and he wasn't dealing with with
[1:48:12] with any kind of
[1:48:14] retribution, those kind of thoughts in
[1:48:16] his mind. All of the sudden, Brother
[1:48:19] Brenham felt sorry for the man.
[1:48:21] Compassion came over him. He loved him
[1:48:23] and he began to see from the man's
[1:48:25] perspective. Remember love doesn't seek
[1:48:28] her own
[1:48:30] but seeks others and starts to say that
[1:48:33] man that poor man he don't want to be
[1:48:35] like that he don't want to say that he
[1:48:37] wants he wants a different kind of life
[1:48:39] that's not that man that's the devil
[1:48:42] that man if he was free from that devil
[1:48:43] would probably be my
[1:48:45] brother and when brother Brennham was
[1:48:48] able to project that kind of have that
[1:48:50] kind of love that love was more powerful
[1:48:52] than the hate in the man and the Love
[1:48:56] conquered the hate.
[1:49:00] Abraham said it'll conquer anything.
[1:49:04] Any situation that we face, I guarantee
[1:49:07] love will conquer it.
[1:49:10] And the way love will express is up to
[1:49:12] God. Amen. But it's not going to be my
[1:49:15] love and your love. This will be the
[1:49:16] love of God that flows right through us
[1:49:18] as we yield ourselves and crucify
[1:49:20] ourselves and let God have room to work.
[1:49:23] It's got to be his kind of
[1:49:25] love. Brother Brandham said it in this
[1:49:28] in the message. It wasn't so from the
[1:49:30] beginning. He said, "Did you ever meet
[1:49:32] people that you just love to be with?"
[1:49:34] You you've had that and why they create
[1:49:37] that atmosphere by their life and the
[1:49:39] way they live and the things they think
[1:49:41] about and they love uh and the love they
[1:49:44] have for you. You've heard my message on
[1:49:47] the possum, you know, and on the bees
[1:49:48] trying to sting me and the bull trying
[1:49:50] to kill me. animals. See, it'll do you.
[1:49:53] You create an atmosphere and that's the
[1:49:56] atmosphere you have to be in to pray for
[1:49:58] the sick. See, it's the same thing. It's
[1:50:02] love that casts out evil spirits.
[1:50:05] Brother, what's the secret? I'm going to
[1:50:07] let you in on the secret in my life. You
[1:50:08] think it's mystic. It's not. It's love.
[1:50:11] What is it that you cast out evil
[1:50:13] spirits for when you pray with the sick?
[1:50:14] It's love.
[1:50:16] And he said, then he goes to the story
[1:50:18] of the possum, the mother possum who
[1:50:20] brought her babies and was prayed for
[1:50:22] the bees. Remember the story of the the
[1:50:24] hornets? He he bumped the post with his
[1:50:26] mower and all of a sudden a swarm of of
[1:50:29] hornets came out and they were going to
[1:50:30] swarm all around him and sting him and
[1:50:32] and there was hundreds of them. Do you
[1:50:34] remember the story?
[1:50:36] And all of a sudden something came over
[1:50:38] Brother Benham instead of being angry at
[1:50:40] those bees for wanting to sting him.
[1:50:42] Listen, I won't fault you if you get
[1:50:44] angry, if you get stung. But something
[1:50:47] supernatural came over him. It was the
[1:50:48] love of God. And what did he start
[1:50:50] doing? He started apologizing to the
[1:50:53] bees.
[1:50:55] He said, "I'm sorry, little bees. I
[1:50:57] disturbed your
[1:50:59] home." He said, "I'm God's servant and I
[1:51:03] was in a hurry to get my yard mow
[1:51:04] because I have so many visitors. I was
[1:51:05] in a hurry and I bumped you and I'm
[1:51:07] sorry I disturbed you." Then he says,
[1:51:10] "Now you just go back into your hive and
[1:51:12] I won't bother you no more." And he
[1:51:14] said, "Like a line, they just lined up
[1:51:16] and went right back in."
[1:51:18] He said, "What did that?" That was love.
[1:51:22] Amen. Then you know the story of the
[1:51:25] bull when he was uh working uh the power
[1:51:29] line and he was also a game warden at
[1:51:30] the same time. He was going to cross
[1:51:32] over this field and see somebody and he
[1:51:34] forgot that there was a a angry bull in
[1:51:36] there that had killed somebody. And he
[1:51:38] gets halfway across the field and the
[1:51:40] bull stands up looking right at him and
[1:51:42] he reaches for his pistol and he had
[1:51:43] left his pistol in the car and he was in
[1:51:47] real trouble. He said all of a sudden
[1:51:49] something came over him. Instead of
[1:51:51] hating that bull, he loved the bull.
[1:51:56] And when he projected love, the bull
[1:51:58] stopped. Brother Benham said, "I've seen
[1:52:00] wild animals tamed because of love."
[1:52:02] Right.
[1:52:04] He said, he said, "I'm sorry I disturbed
[1:52:08] you,
[1:52:09] Brother Benham. Listen, he's apologizing
[1:52:12] to a bull."
[1:52:16] He's telling him, "I'm in your
[1:52:19] territory. You're just defending
[1:52:21] yourself. You're doing what nature
[1:52:22] called you to do. I'm sorry. You just go
[1:52:25] and lay down over there and I'll go on."
[1:52:28] And the bull turned around and went and
[1:52:29] laid down. He said he had the funniest
[1:52:31] look in his face
[1:52:33] because he had come in contact with God
[1:52:36] because God is love.
[1:52:42] Do you know if we can just become a
[1:52:44] conduit for love, people can come in
[1:52:46] contact with God
[1:52:49] because God is love. Amen. When we
[1:52:53] respond to situations different than
[1:52:55] anybody's ever responded to them, they
[1:52:58] can come in contact with a living God.
[1:53:05] Brother B makes this
[1:53:07] statement. He
[1:53:09] says, "All right, here was voices. Oh,
[1:53:14] how we need in Jeffersonville thousands
[1:53:16] of lived voices. The thunder of God
[1:53:19] thundering out in sweetness and
[1:53:21] holiness, purity, undefiled lives,
[1:53:24] walking around in the earth today
[1:53:25] without a blemish. Yes, sir. Real
[1:53:27] Christians, that's thunder against the
[1:53:29] enemy. The devil don't care how loud you
[1:53:32] can holler. The devil don't care how
[1:53:34] much you can jump or how much you can do
[1:53:36] this or shout. But what hurts the devil
[1:53:38] is to see that sanctified holy con holy
[1:53:42] life consecrated to God. Say anything to
[1:53:45] him, call him anything, just as sweet as
[1:53:48] it can be and move right on. Oh my, that
[1:53:51] throws him away. That's the thunder that
[1:53:54] shakes the
[1:53:56] devil. You know what? If it wasn't for
[1:53:58] this message, I would think it was a
[1:54:00] different kind of thunder that shook the
[1:54:01] devil. Me stomping my feet and getting
[1:54:04] mad at him and yelling at him and
[1:54:05] telling him he's this, that, or the
[1:54:06] other. But what destroys the devil, what
[1:54:08] shakes the devil is the love of God.
[1:54:11] Amen. He can't compete with it. He can't
[1:54:14] copy it. And all of his tactics are
[1:54:17] diffused in the face of God's love.
[1:54:20] Amen. Amen. And all I want to be is a
[1:54:23] conduit for his love.
[1:54:25] If I, Brother Brandham said, if I could
[1:54:28] have perfect love, he said, I'd rather
[1:54:31] have love than all the gifts there is in
[1:54:33] the Bible. And rather than in my church
[1:54:36] having every gift operating and if I if
[1:54:38] we would just operate by love, it would
[1:54:40] be better than all the gifts that we
[1:54:41] could have.
[1:54:43] Why? Because brother Bam told us the
[1:54:45] most powerful force on this in this
[1:54:47] world is love. The thing that conquers
[1:54:50] everything else is love. And God is
[1:54:54] love. You know, the most important thing
[1:54:56] in my life is just to get myself out of
[1:54:58] the way so that God can show his love
[1:55:00] through me.
[1:55:03] I spent too much time in my life
[1:55:05] defending myself, proving I'm something,
[1:55:07] trying to be somebody, getting mad when
[1:55:10] somebody calls me names or says
[1:55:12] something about me or tells a lie,
[1:55:14] getting
[1:55:15] offended. But oh God, help me.
[1:55:19] I want to overcome the world.
[1:55:22] And this is the victory that overcomes
[1:55:23] the world. Even our faith and our faith
[1:55:25] workketh by love.
[1:55:28] I want to get to the place where I can
[1:55:30] just be the dew drop shimmering on the
[1:55:32] little leaf battle saying I'm going
[1:55:35] home. It doesn't matter what the devil
[1:55:37] says or what he tries to do when it's
[1:55:40] all said and done. I know who I am and
[1:55:42] I'm going home and none of these things
[1:55:44] can hurt me. Nothing can hurt me. Amen.
[1:55:48] Because I came from God and I'm going to
[1:55:51] God. But what I can do is defeat the
[1:55:54] devil in every tactic. And if I can
[1:55:57] allow the love of God to flow through
[1:55:58] me, I will destroy everything the
[1:56:01] devil's trying to do around me. And he
[1:56:03] will not have room to work where there's
[1:56:06] divine love.
[1:56:07] Amen. Let's stand
[1:56:12] together.
[1:56:14] Amen. I don't know what you thought.
[1:56:17] musicians, if you come and Blake, if you
[1:56:19] come, I don't know what you thought what
[1:56:21] the capstone would be and the capstone
[1:56:24] ministry and the this massively
[1:56:28] wonderful expression of the power of God
[1:56:31] would look like.
[1:56:35] But to me, the greatest expression of
[1:56:39] God on the earth will be a humble people
[1:56:42] who love God and love one another and
[1:56:46] love humanity more than their own
[1:56:49] life. Because this mortal life is not my
[1:56:53] life. It's only my purpose for being
[1:56:57] here to express his life.
[1:57:01] I have been controlled by the devil too
[1:57:05] many times.
[1:57:07] He's gotten me to say something back.
[1:57:09] He's goting me to get mad. He's He's
[1:57:11] He's got me too many times and I don't
[1:57:15] want him to get me no more
[1:57:18] because I want God to have me and I want
[1:57:20] him to have all of me. And now as we
[1:57:24] thank God for the for the resurrected
[1:57:27] life. Amen. Remember, resurrection
[1:57:30] always comes after
[1:57:32] death. And if we want resurrection in
[1:57:35] us, we've got to be willing to die to
[1:57:37] everything that's not God so that
[1:57:39] everything that is God can live inside
[1:57:41] of us. And let's just sit let's just sit
[1:57:45] in the sun and shimmer a little longer,
[1:57:47] friends. Amen. Let the let the move of
[1:57:50] God shake in your heart. There's chaos
[1:57:52] all around. Absolutely. The world's
[1:57:54] falling apart and there's no love found
[1:57:56] anywhere and the love of man is waxed
[1:57:58] cold. But it doesn't matter for me
[1:58:00] because I love God and I love his word
[1:58:02] and he loves me and I'm going to perfect
[1:58:04] love. And in the meantime, I'm not going
[1:58:07] to let this coldness of this world and
[1:58:09] the coldness of the devil and Satan's
[1:58:11] Eden take my joy away. And I'm not going
[1:58:15] to let it bring me out of divine love
[1:58:18] into these realms because nothing can
[1:58:21] conquer love. But love conquers all.
[1:58:25] Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Dear
[1:58:28] Lord Jesus, we thank you for this word.
[1:58:31] And God, I pray that you would help us
[1:58:34] to be a people that surreners, Lord,
[1:58:37] greater than we've ever surrendered
[1:58:38] before,
[1:58:39] Lord. God, I pray that you'd help us to
[1:58:42] take our cross and follow after you.
[1:58:46] You've left us an example, Lord, and
[1:58:48] that example was a life surrendered to
[1:58:51] the word.
[1:58:52] A life surrendered to the will of the
[1:58:54] father. Giving up everything else but
[1:58:57] that. And you did it not for yourself.
[1:58:59] You did it for me. You did it for
[1:59:02] others. God. May we follow your example.
[1:59:06] May we yield ourselves to your word,
[1:59:08] Lord, and surrender everything, every
[1:59:11] thought and every ambition and every
[1:59:13] desire. May it be surrendered to your
[1:59:15] word. And God, would you please bring
[1:59:18] that divine love in our heart by your
[1:59:20] spirit? Would you help us be washed out
[1:59:23] of all kinds of strife and all kinds of
[1:59:27] self-preservation and
[1:59:29] self-loves? Would you just purge us once
[1:59:31] again, Lord, as we come back to Calvary
[1:59:34] again, to our own Calvary to take up our
[1:59:36] cross and follow you, Lord, as we
[1:59:39] repent, Lord, of these things, I pray
[1:59:42] you would take them from us. And Lord,
[1:59:44] if we can die, would you be the
[1:59:47] resurrection and life in our life? Would
[1:59:50] you bring forth your life, your love,
[1:59:53] your overcoming power inside of us? And
[1:59:56] may you have the victory in us. We love
[1:59:59] you, Lord. We thank you, God, for the
[2:00:02] truth of your word for bringing us to
[2:00:04] this pinnacle, Lord, to this capstone
[2:00:08] divine love. And God, may it express in
[2:00:11] each one of us in greater ways than it
[2:00:13] ever has before. And may it be a
[2:00:15] conquering force over every force of the
[2:00:17] enemy and humility and in simplicity and
[2:00:21] in surrender. May it take dominion that
[2:00:24] you may have your way in our lives. We
[2:00:26] love you. We ask for your blessing.
[2:00:29] Bless your people, Lord, as we go and
[2:00:30] enjoy our gatherings with our families
[2:00:32] and enjoy the celebration, Lord, of the
[2:00:35] resurrected life being in us. God, may
[2:00:38] we have that joy inside that like that
[2:00:40] little dew drop has that vibrating of
[2:00:43] the molecules preparing for a
[2:00:45] transition. And may that be the thing
[2:00:47] that brings us the greatest joy is this
[2:00:50] sunlight that's drawing us home. We love
[2:00:53] you. We ask that you would bless us in
[2:00:56] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:01:01] I want to
[2:01:03] live the
[2:01:06] way that he wants me to
[2:01:11] live. I want to
[2:01:15] give until there's just no
[2:01:21] more to give.
[2:01:24] I want to
[2:01:27] love love till there's just
[2:01:33] no
[2:01:35] love. Or I could
[2:01:38] never ever out
[2:01:42] love
[2:01:43] the
[2:01:46] mortals. I want to
[2:01:50] live the
[2:01:53] way he wants me to
[2:01:58] live. I want to
[2:02:02] give until there's just no
[2:02:08] more to give.
[2:02:11] I want to
[2:02:14] love love till there's just no more
[2:02:21] love. For I could
[2:02:25] never ever out
[2:02:28] love the
[2:02:33] Lord. Man, I remember reading a
[2:02:35] biography one
[2:02:36] time of uh Charles Spurgeon. He was the
[2:02:40] great minister in England in the 1800s.
[2:02:43] Brother Beam speaks well of him. And he
[2:02:46] was getting attacked in the newspapers
[2:02:47] because they were mocking him and his
[2:02:49] preaching and all these things. And it
[2:02:52] devastated him, wrecked his life. He
[2:02:54] went into depression and and it's it's
[2:02:57] an interesting part of his his life
[2:02:59] story. And they were making cartoon
[2:03:02] characters out of him, mocking him for
[2:03:03] being overweight, mocking him for being
[2:03:05] young and a child preacher and all these
[2:03:07] things and mocking for what he stood
[2:03:09] for. And he finally come to terms with
[2:03:12] it one day and he got down and he prayed
[2:03:13] and he said, "God, the only thing that I
[2:03:16] have in this world that's mine is my
[2:03:20] reputation." He said, "But I'm I gladly
[2:03:23] give it up for you."
[2:03:26] gave up the only thing that was truly
[2:03:28] his was his reputation and he gave it up
[2:03:31] for the Lord. And after he did, it
[2:03:33] didn't matter anymore what people said,
[2:03:35] the cartoon characters, the mocking, he
[2:03:37] turned a deaf ear to it because he
[2:03:39] already gave up his reputation. What did
[2:03:42] he do? He went to Calvary.
[2:03:44] Charles Spurgeon died right there so
[2:03:47] that Christ could live. Then he went on
[2:03:49] to become one of the greatest preachers,
[2:03:51] one of the greatest preachers that
[2:03:53] England has ever seen.
[2:03:57] Amen. When it comes to the doctrine of
[2:03:58] predestination, he had it
[2:04:01] down. Amen. I admire that. I want to
[2:04:05] follow those footsteps.
[2:04:08] Because who won? The cartoonist in the
[2:04:11] newspapers or Christ? I say Christ won.
[2:04:15] What was the devil trying to do to
[2:04:17] Charles Spurgeon? make him angry, get
[2:04:19] him upset, pull him off course, get him
[2:04:21] to respond in the pull pit to all these
[2:04:22] things and ruin the work that God was
[2:04:24] trying to do. So the only way to win was
[2:04:26] to die
[2:04:29] and to love God more than you love your
[2:04:31] own reputation. And God had a tremendous
[2:04:34] victory. Do you remember when brother
[2:04:36] Brandham was standing in the wings of a
[2:04:38] meeting? Amen. And they they they they
[2:04:40] had advertised he was coming and some
[2:04:42] there was some dispute
[2:04:44] and man got up and says brother brother
[2:04:47] Brandon won't be able to preach tonight
[2:04:49] because his brothers took sick and he's
[2:04:51] had to rush home and brother Brandon was
[2:04:52] standing in the side behind the curtain
[2:04:54] and he could have just walked out the
[2:04:55] door and walked out and exposed the man
[2:04:57] as a liar. You remember the testimony? I
[2:04:59] don't remember whose testimony it was
[2:05:01] but they shared. They said why don't you
[2:05:02] go out there and prove him wrong. He
[2:05:04] says I couldn't do that. That would hurt
[2:05:07] that man's testimony.
[2:05:10] Yeah. Guess what? The devil lost that
[2:05:13] day. Amen. He lost.
[2:05:16] Amen. It may have been a bit of bravado.
[2:05:19] It may have been flashy and it may have
[2:05:21] been standing for truth and standing for
[2:05:23] right to walk out there and expose this
[2:05:25] man as a liar. But if he would have done
[2:05:26] that, the devil would have got a victory
[2:05:28] that day. The devil would have won.
[2:05:30] Amen. But because he humbled himself and
[2:05:32] said, "I couldn't hurt that man's
[2:05:34] ministry and confused those people. I'm
[2:05:35] not going to do that." He slipped out
[2:05:37] the side and just went away and left the
[2:05:39] lie and left it the way it was. And
[2:05:42] guess what? Love won a victory that day.
[2:05:46] Satan lost the battle.
[2:05:49] Jesus, when he went to trial and
[2:05:51] mockings and scorging, they they mocked
[2:05:53] him. They had false accusers. They had
[2:05:56] paid people to make uh accusations
[2:05:58] against him. And their stories didn't
[2:05:59] even match. It didn't hold water. And
[2:06:01] they were accusing him of all kinds of
[2:06:03] things. And he sat there silent.
[2:06:06] He sat in what looked like
[2:06:09] weakness. He had the facts. He could
[2:06:12] have defended himself. He was smarter
[2:06:14] than they were.
[2:06:16] But he knew what the will of the father
[2:06:18] was and he surrendered to it. And in
[2:06:20] weakness, he defeated all of them.
[2:06:24] The devil lost because of love.
[2:06:29] In my life, I want the devil to lose.
[2:06:32] Amen. Because of love.
[2:06:35] I I want to lose if I've got to lose
[2:06:38] whatever I've got to lose. I want love
[2:06:40] to prevail so that God can win and
[2:06:43] defeat the devil through this flesh
[2:06:46] right here. So, it's going to take a
[2:06:48] greater surrender than what we
[2:06:50] surrendered before, but oh, I think it's
[2:06:54] worth it. God is good. God bless you
[2:06:57] all. Amen. Maybe victory is simpler than
[2:07:01] we thought, but much harder than we ever
[2:07:04] imagined.
[2:07:06] But if we could surrender ourselves to
[2:07:08] the place where that love, whatever came
[2:07:10] over brother Brennham when that madman
[2:07:12] came, that's what I want to live in my
[2:07:14] life. Amen. Whatever swept over him when
[2:07:16] the bees were buzzing around, that's
[2:07:18] what I want in my life. And whatever
[2:07:20] came to him the moment the bull was
[2:07:22] staring him down, that's the thing that
[2:07:24] I want to have in my life. because
[2:07:25] that's God
[2:07:27] and that's love. Amen. God bless you,
[2:07:30] friends. Amen. We'll dismiss you as we
[2:07:35] sing. There have been
[2:07:38] times when
[2:07:41] giving and
[2:07:43] loving brought pain.
[2:07:47] And I
[2:07:49] promise that I
[2:07:52] never let it
[2:07:55] happen
[2:07:58] again. But I found out that
[2:08:04] loving is well worth the risk.
[2:08:10] And that
[2:08:12] even in
[2:08:14] losing you
[2:08:20] win. I want to
[2:08:23] live the
[2:08:26] way he wants me to live.
[2:08:32] I want to
[2:08:35] give until there's just no
[2:08:41] more to
[2:08:43] give. I want to
[2:08:47] love love till there's just no more
[2:08:53] love.
[2:08:55] I could
[2:08:57] never ever out
[2:09:01] love the
[2:09:06] Lord. He showed us that
[2:09:12] only through dying.
[2:09:18] And he gave
[2:09:21] way it
[2:09:23] see there was
[2:09:26] nothing to
[2:09:29] give. He
[2:09:32] loved when
[2:09:35] love brought
[2:09:37] heartache and loss.
[2:09:41] He
[2:09:42] forgave from the old
[2:09:46] rugged
[2:09:51] cross. I want to
[2:09:55] live the
[2:09:58] way he wants
[2:10:00] me to live.
[2:10:03] I want to
[2:10:06] give until there's just no
[2:10:12] more to
[2:10:14] give. I want to
[2:10:19] love till there's just no more love.
[2:10:27] I could
[2:10:28] never ever out
[2:10:32] love the Lord. Verse
[2:10:37] one, there have been
[2:10:40] times when
[2:10:43] giving and
[2:10:45] loving brought pain.
[2:10:50] And I
[2:10:51] promise that I'd
[2:10:54] never let it
[2:10:58] happen
[2:11:00] again. But I found
[2:11:03] out that
[2:11:06] loving is well worth the risk.
[2:11:12] And that
[2:11:15] even in
[2:11:17] losing you
[2:11:22] win, I'm going to
[2:11:26] live the
[2:11:29] way he wants me to live.
[2:11:35] I'm going to
[2:11:37] give
[2:11:40] until there's just no
[2:11:43] more to
[2:11:45] give. I'm going to
[2:11:50] love till there's just
[2:11:55] no love.
[2:11:58] I could
[2:12:00] never ever out
[2:12:03] love the
[2:12:09] Lord. The love of
[2:12:12] God is
[2:12:16] greater than tongue or
[2:12:21] pain can ever
[2:12:26] tell. It goes
[2:12:30] beyond the highest
[2:12:34] star and reaches
[2:12:39] to the low
[2:12:44] is the guilty
[2:12:49] pair bow down with him.
[2:12:54] God gave his
[2:12:59] son to
[2:13:03] win his airing
[2:13:08] child. He
[2:13:13] reconciled and pardoned
[2:13:18] from his sin.
[2:13:23] Oh love of
[2:13:27] God, how
[2:13:32] rich, how
[2:13:37] measureless and
[2:13:41] strong it shall
[2:13:47] forever more
[2:13:51] into the
[2:14:01] Saint when no return
[2:14:05] time shall pass
[2:14:11] away and earthly
[2:14:15] thrones and kingoms fall.
[2:14:21] When men could
[2:14:25] we refuse to
[2:14:30] pray on rocks and
[2:14:35] hills and mountains
[2:14:39] called God's love so
[2:14:44] sure shall still endure
[2:14:50] All
[2:14:55] measureless and
[2:14:59] strong
[2:15:01] redeeming
[2:15:04] grace to Adam's
[2:15:08] race. The saints and angels.
[2:15:19] Oh lamb of
[2:15:23] God, how rich and
[2:15:28] pure, how
[2:15:33] measureless and
[2:15:38] strong it shall
[2:15:44] forever endure.
[2:15:49] Saints and
[2:15:52] angels
[2:15:57] angels could we with
[2:16:02] thee the ocean
[2:16:07] filled and were the
[2:16:12] sky of parchment made
[2:16:18] Every
[2:16:21] song on earth
[2:16:32] aqued by
[2:16:36] tree to write the
[2:16:41] love of God above
[2:16:47] could drain the
[2:16:52] ocean
[2:16:55] dry. Nor could the
[2:17:00] scroll contain the
[2:17:05] whole though stretched from
[2:17:10] sky to sun.
[2:17:15] Oh love of
[2:17:19] God, how rich and
[2:17:24] beautiful, how
[2:17:30] measureless and strong.
[2:17:35] It shall
[2:17:39] forever more
[2:17:44] endure the saints
[2:17:49] and your soul.
[2:17:55] Oh love of
[2:17:59] God, how rich and
[2:18:04] pure, how
[2:18:09] measureless and
[2:18:14] strong it shall
[2:18:20] forever endure.
[2:18:25] Blessing and me.
