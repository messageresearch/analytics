luke 13 10 and when he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself so she is crippled she has bowed over like like hunched back there curled over and bowed over and she could in no way straighten herself up she is she this is a crippled woman who's bowed over in the back and could not raise herself and could in no wise lift up herself and when jesus saw her he called to her he called her to him and said unto her woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity and he said and he laid his hand on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god what i like about this is in verse 11 there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity she did not have a crippled body that was a spirit of infirmity that was reflecting in a crippled body you understand you understand what i'm trying to say we would look at that and say that poor woman she was probably born a she's probably a hunchback she's bowed over her spine is probably deformed i mean she she may she may have been disfigured she may have been in that condition so long her muscles have have molded to that position and she could not even raise herself up and we look at that as a physical condition and that is not a physical condition that is a spiritual infirmity and i'll tell you why that is amazing the reason that's amazing is because he hath made us kings and priests and we're kings over a spiritual dominion over a spiritual kingdom we're spiritual kings and priests and if that's a spiritual affirmative infirmity we have the power and the spiritual realm to exercise our dominion as a king and a priest over the spiritual realm and cast that thing out and reject that and let it go and not worry about how the muscles will work and how the spine will come back and there's not hopeless it's not helpless it's not because there's kings and priests on this earth spiritual kings and priests over a spiritual kingdom now not will be but he hath already made us kings and priests
