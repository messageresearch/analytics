amen so what was brother brenham's Ministry the ministry of Eleazar to call out a bride the question is who's the bride that he called out prise God did you hear him did you hear him amen listen it's not playing tapes you can play tapes and you can hear Doctrine and you can get good teaching that's fine but if you've missed your call and if you missed your name you missed the whole point of Eleazar coming amen Eleazar came to get a bride in the coming to the bride he also had interaction with laben and laan's dad and mom and he gave them gifts and they got all kinds of rewards but only one was the bride and she was the one that followed eleazar's lead and let Eleazar lead her all the way to Isaac to where she was unified with Isaac that's the ministry of our prophet in the end time lord question did we hear what laben heard or did we hear what Rebecca heard God praise be to God listen these things are true and I can't change them I can't change them because they sound extreme I can't change them because they sound uh harsh some are some aren't I can't change that it's the truth it's the truth that she will hear his voice and she will believe him amen oh I'm glad it's true I could have never climbed a ladder I don't care how much assistance you would have given me I would have fallen off I I could have never made my way to bride of Jesus Christ by performing acts and and rituals and and good deeds and Good Conduct I don't care how how how much of a boost you would give me I would have fallen somewhere I would have failed but I had to be just as incapable that little washer woman amen and he would come along and says no Chad it's you I sent a prophet for you I have these tapes for you I came to call you amen and I hope it's for you too amen but what happens to you amen is not going to have be able to to change me it's what I hear about me that changes me and it's not what you hear about me that changes me it's what you hear about you that changes you you have to say you have to hear in the message him saying God himself saying you're my bride amen am so where did you hear that brother Chad what tape I don't know amen I hear it on all the tapes it's like brother benam talked about this word of God Amen and he types it with a mirror Amen in the mirror where the little boy was born in the country and he comes to the city to his aunt's great house never seen himself in the mirror and he walks up the steps and he sees a little boy and he waves and the boy waves he pulls his ear the boy pulls his ear and finally he realizes what I'm seeing is me that's a reflection of me and he said Mama that's me and that's what brother Ram types with this word of God Amen it's reflecting me when brother R talks about a bride he's talking about me I got to go beyond him talking about there's a global bride and these other people and they're probably in it but I'm probably not in it amen if that's the way you're thinking you're never going to make it amen never it's going to take a revelation that says I'm not worthy I'm not able I am just like that washer woman I can't do a thing to even help myself I don't know why he would want me cuz I have nothing to offer him but I can't help it I I heard my name I just can't help it something inside me goes ding ding ding I can't help it I I can't I can't make it logical I can't do any I just can't help it I believe I believe
