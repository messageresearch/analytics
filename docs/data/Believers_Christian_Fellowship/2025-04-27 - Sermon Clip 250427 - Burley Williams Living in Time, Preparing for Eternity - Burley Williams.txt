TRANSCRIPT
========================================
You know, I told my wife, I said, "Honey," I said, "I want you to repeat after me." She said, "Okay." I She looked right at me, said, "Honey." She said, "Honey, as of today, as of today, all of my arsenal, all of my arsenal, I'mma destroy it. I'mma destroy it. That's okay. Do y'all know what that mean? Some of you don't. In the military term, arsenal mean stored up weapons. Military term stored up weapons. So what that means, husband and wives got arsenal. Oh, you like Oh, you do. When she if she offend you or do something that wasn't right, said, "I ain't going to say nothing now. I'll wait for later." You just stored Arsenal. Oh, I didn't like what he did, but I ain't going to say nothing. I'll wait later. You put it in your arsenal. And it's wrong. Yeah. Amen. Some of you got bazookas, dynamite, grenades, and everything in your ar and you just waiting for the argument to come up. Which one going to be the right one to pick? What you think happening when you and your wife have a disagreement and you trying to explain something and the other one be going like, "Mhm." Yeah. Mhm. They're not listening to you. They're just while you're saying that, they're looking in their arsenal which one they going to use to come back at you. You know that's wrong. Yeah. You're laughing, but it's wrong. Got to lay it down. Amen. The best way to kill that arsenal is don't let stuff build up. Hello. Don't let it build it up. But there is a wisdom to that side. Sometimes you can discern that didn't really mean that. But that has to be addressed. I'll just wait for later to address it because right now ain't it ain't going to happen. That's not putting in the arsenal for an attack, but waiting for the right time to deal with the situation. But when you just storing them all up, oh, I'll wait. I know he going to come back. He going to say something or she That's wrong. Amen. Praise the Lord.
