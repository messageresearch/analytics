[16:06] again to be here
[16:08] Lord we count ourselves privileged Lord
[16:11] to be able to gather to Worship You Lord
[16:14] to hear your word preached Lord to have
[16:17] the Revelation you've given us in this
[16:19] hour Lord and we're asking that you
[16:21] would Lord that you would give us a
[16:23] greater Revelation that you would open
[16:24] yourself more to us that we might see
[16:26] more of you this morning
[16:29] and God we're asking that you would take
[16:30] preeminence among us and that you would
[16:32] have your way and that you would speak
[16:34] your words of life and may we all have
[16:37] ears to hear and receive all that you
[16:38] have for us father I yield myself to
[16:42] your hand and ask that you would take
[16:43] this vessel and use it for your purpose
[16:46] God may I get out of the way and allow
[16:48] you freedom to move as you wish God we
[16:51] want that Lord that's what we desire we
[16:53] want to be vessels that you can use and
[16:56] may you use us For Your Glory may you
[16:58] have your way and may you move freely

[17:05] It Grow to bear fruit for your kingdom
[17:08] may you be glorified in all we say and
[17:10] do we love you father and we just invite
[17:13] you to take your place at the head of
[17:15] the table that you might come and break
[17:17] the bread of life for us we ask these
[17:20] things in Jesus Christ's name
[17:23] amen and God bless you while you're
[17:25] standing let's take our Bibles and turn
[17:28] to the Book of Jeremiah
[17:30] and while you're turning as brother Ben
[17:33] said we want to remember brother Gabe
[17:35] and his family they're up in lurine
[17:37] ministering for brother Nathaniel And um
[17:40] they'll be traveling back this afternoon
[17:41] so we want to remember them also want to
[17:43] say how much I enjoyed the Wednesday
[17:45] evening service with brother Stan I'm so
[17:47] glad that we were able to get acquainted
[17:49] with him and I mean there was more
[17:51] things I wanted to hear I wish he would
[17:52] have stopped and went further in many
[17:53] things but I know he's got a daughter in
[17:57] Ohio and he may have to come back and
[17:59] visit her so I'm going to try to stay
[18:01] dialed in and catch amen The Vibes when
[18:03] he's coming back cuz I would certainly
[18:05] love to have him come back Minister
[18:07] again and have more opportunity for some
[18:08] of us to fellowship with him so we just
[18:11] want to say how much we enjoyed that and
[18:13] it was wonderful also want to welcome
[18:15] our visitors I see some of the Finley
[18:17] family God bless you it's good to have
[18:18] you here and also sister Emily Sanders
[18:20] parents are here so I know there's a
[18:23] drawing power here in those grandbabies
[18:25] but it's good to have you with us amen
[18:28] let's look Jeremiah chapter 1 together
[18:30] if we could turn
[18:32] there uh I'm going to do a part two from
[18:35] last uh Sunday on the genes of his word
[18:38] the genes of his word part two and there
[18:40] was uh some things that I didn't get to
[18:42] express last time there was not enough
[18:44] time and then brother Stan came and he
[18:46] said some things that were just so
[18:48] complimentary and things that were
[18:49] encouraging to me and opened my eyes
[18:51] even further and so I want to come back
[18:52] and express some of those things amen
[18:55] and and uh with the understanding that
[18:57] God's open so let's look at Jeremiah 1
[19:01] verse4 then the word of the Lord came
[19:03] unto me saying before I formed thee in
[19:05] the belly I knew thee and before thou
[19:08] camest forth out of the womb I
[19:09] Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a
[19:12] prophet unto the Nations amen God bless
[19:15] you as you take your seat keep your
[19:17] place here in Jeremiah chapter 1 but
[19:19] we're going to come back to this in just
[19:21] a minute
[19:23] but when we looked at the genes of his
[19:25] word if you'll remember from last Sunday
[19:27] we went to two places in the scripture
[19:29] where Jesus spoke of seed and in one
[19:31] place he talked about how the son of man
[19:34] sowed a seed into the field but the
[19:35] enemy came along and so to seal a seed
[19:38] into the field and when they came up
[19:40] they they found that there was tears
[19:42] there was mixed in with the wheat there
[19:44] was a mixed seed and and he explained
[19:46] The Parables the son of man sowed the
[19:49] seed which are the Saints but the enemy
[19:51] came and he SED tears um among the wheat
[19:54] and at the end time that they would be
[19:56] separated so he made the seed the
[19:58] children of the Kingdom but then in
[20:00] another Parable he he he talked about
[20:03] sewing the seed into the four types uh
[20:06] of soil into the the byway and in the
[20:08] sidewalk and in the and the thorny
[20:10] patches and in the Stony ground and then
[20:12] some into the good ground then he made
[20:14] the good ground the predestinated the
[20:16] elect and he made the seed his word amen
[20:20] and I venture to say that that both
[20:22] pares are different ways of explaining
[20:24] the same thing amen because what are the
[20:26] SE Children of the Kingdom what are the
[20:28] seed of God it's his word you're part of
[20:29] the word and the word is the seed and
[20:32] the seed is in you as part of God's word
[20:35] amen so in in one place the seed is you
[20:37] and another place is the word that falls
[20:40] into you amen but we know that the word
[20:42] comes to the word to Quicken the life
[20:43] the word to manifest the word in the end
[20:46] it's all the word
[20:47] amen and so I want to read the same
[20:49] quote that I read to you last Sunday
[20:51] when we got the title The the subject
[20:53] for our lesson it says he that uh this
[20:56] is out of God's only provided place of
[20:57] worship he had in his heart before the
[21:00] foundation of the world a son because he
[21:02] is a father but it was still in the
[21:04] genes of his
[21:06] word amen and he had created man and he
[21:08] had put him on free moral agency but
[21:10] that man fell but the great sculptor God
[21:12] who made man from the dust of the earth
[21:14] he didn't settle for that he started
[21:15] making man again and he starts talking
[21:17] about the process coming back to uh the
[21:19] Son of God coming back to Jesus Christ
[21:22] but he says it was still in the genes of
[21:24] his word he had a desire for that
[21:25] perfect son that would reflect him and
[21:28] was in the genes of his word amen and so
[21:30] we started talking about genes and
[21:32] genetics a little bit last time and I
[21:35] marveled with you I express my Marvel to
[21:37] you at how brother benam could pick up
[21:39] on things that were going on in the
[21:41] scientific world as they were just
[21:42] beginning to discover things and this
[21:44] whole area of genetics was opening up
[21:47] through the 40s into the 50s but really
[21:49] started making discoveries in the 50s
[21:51] and Beyond and brother B was able to tap
[21:53] that and bring that to a spiritual type
[21:55] that would explain us and it's marel at
[21:59] that amen and and so then from then on
[22:02] from that time on this field of genetics
[22:05] has exploded and it's wonderful that
[22:08] before the prophet left the scene
[22:09] because he started really dealing with
[22:11] the seed Gene of God the gene of God the
[22:14] seed of God in 1965 right before God
[22:17] took him away and left us with this
[22:19] concept so as science would explode this
[22:22] understanding our spiritual
[22:23] understanding would explode as well amen
[22:26] amen and so we're thankful for those
[22:29] things Amen in the message leadership
[22:33] Prophet says you are here because your
[22:34] name was placed on the Lamb's Book of
[22:36] Life before there was even a foundation
[22:37] of the world that's exactly right you're
[22:40] a gene a spiritual Gene out of your
[22:42] heavenly father a part of God's word
[22:45] amen so we know we are part of that word
[22:47] so in the beginning was the word we're
[22:49] part of that amen that's why when that
[22:51] logos came out of God Amen it contained
[22:53] all the attributes of God it was the
[22:55] thought of God expressed as a form of
[22:57] logos and you and I were in that yeah
[23:01] amen because that was the word and we're
[23:02] part of God's word amen and me we're
[23:05] going to look more into that and what
[23:06] part it was here in just a little bit
[23:08] but let's go back to Jeremiah now and
[23:11] look at Jeremiah again Jeremiah 1 verse
[23:14] 4 again then the word of the Lord came
[23:16] unto me saying before I formed thee in
[23:18] the belly I knew thee amen and before
[23:21] thou comest forth out of the womb I
[23:23] Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a
[23:26] prophet unto the nation amen
[23:29] do you think that scripture only applies
[23:30] to
[23:31] Jeremiah I mean the specifics of that I
[23:34] ordained you a prophet to the Nations
[23:35] that may not apply to you but the fact
[23:37] that I knew you before I formed you in
[23:39] the belly I knew you before I formed you
[23:42] in the belly amen a and before thou
[23:46] camest forth out of the womb I
[23:48] Sanctified thee and ordained thee a
[23:50] prophet unto the Nations so you mean God
[23:53] knew me before he formed me in the belly
[23:55] before amen my conception God knew me
[23:58] and ordain the work that I would do on
[24:00] this
[24:01] Earth absolutely amen amen because
[24:05] that's part of his Gene that's part of
[24:06] his genetics that's part of the the the
[24:09] thought of God that is going to unfold
[24:11] itself in due season but now I want to
[24:14] read the rest of it because the rest of
[24:15] it becomes to me such a lesson for us it
[24:19] says then said I a lord God behold I
[24:23] cannot speak for I am a
[24:25] child so don't read any further
[24:32] Jeremiah's response to the fact that God
[24:34] says I knew thee before I formed thee in
[24:36] the belly and before thou camest forth I
[24:40] I I ordained you I Sanctified you and
[24:42] ordained you to be a prophet to the
[24:45] Nations Jeremiah's response is Lord I
[24:48] can't do
[24:49] that that's his response oh that's such
[24:53] a healthy
[24:54] response but but God's going to bring a
[24:57] a little bit of a correction to him to
[24:59] correct his understanding and so what he
[25:01] says next is but the Lord said unto me
[25:03] say not I am a child for thou shal go to
[25:07] all that I shall send thee and who
[25:09] whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt
[25:11] speak be not afraid of their faes for I
[25:14] am with thee to deliver Thee sayith the
[25:16] Lord then the Lord put forth his hand
[25:18] and touched my mouth and the Lord said
[25:20] unto me behold I have put my words in
[25:23] thy mouth amen what a lesson amen first
[25:27] he tells Jeremiah hey Jeremiah don't
[25:29] worry about this I've got this I've
[25:31] already ordained you before you were
[25:32] formed in the belly before you came
[25:34] forth I already Sanctified you I already
[25:36] ordained you to be a prophet to the
[25:38] Nations and Jeremiah has a very logical
[25:41] human response Lord there's no way that
[25:43] I can do what you just said and God says
[25:45] don't worry about that don't be afraid
[25:47] and don't say that amen because it's not
[25:49] you it's what I ordained inside of you
[25:52] it's me in you doing the work I will do
[25:54] it I will touch your mouth and I will
[25:56] put my words in your mouth you you don't
[25:58] have to come up with
[26:01] anything amen and this is such a good
[26:03] lesson for us because we've come to the
[26:05] time at the end of time when the veil
[26:08] has been taken off of the book of God
[26:10] off the Bible amen that's been unveiled
[26:12] so that we can see who we are and we
[26:14] realize that God had ordained us in
[26:16] Christ predestinated us in Christ before
[26:18] the foundation of the world and
[26:20] predestinated US unto adoption amen and
[26:22] give us a spirit whereby a spirit of
[26:24] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father
[26:27] knowing who our father is and who we are
[26:29] that we're children and offspring of
[26:31] almighty God but when we look to the
[26:32] flesh we said God I can't live that kind
[26:34] of life I can't do that I'm but a child
[26:37] I'm not
[26:39] capable but God can bring that
[26:41] correction to our thinking and said
[26:42] listen no no no no you're looking at
[26:45] this
[26:45] wrong I'm not expecting you to do
[26:48] anything I'm just expecting you to be
[26:50] the vessel that I work
[26:52] through that what I've ordained will
[26:55] take place and when it comes time I'll
[26:57] equip you you I'll put words in your
[26:59] mouth I'll touch don't I I've already
[27:01] Sanctified I've already DED don't think
[27:03] up what you've got to do or how you're
[27:05] going to do it or conjure up an idea of
[27:07] how to do it that's not for you to do
[27:10] what is for you to do is just believe
[27:12] what I told you and move forward and I
[27:14] will be with you and I will work in
[27:17] you don't be afraid don't be afraid of
[27:20] anybody else don't be afraid to go do
[27:22] what I told you to do cuz I'm going to
[27:24] take care of
[27:26] it man what a good lesson for all of
[27:30] us brother ROM said in things that are
[27:32] to
[27:33] be I read this before but we're going to
[27:36] go through it again now the only way
[27:38] that you can be a son or daughter of God
[27:40] is because you have to have eternal life
[27:43] and there's only one form of eternal
[27:45] life and that's God's life only one form
[27:47] of eternal life that was God there to be
[27:49] a Son of God you had to be in him
[27:53] always the gene of your life spiritual
[27:55] life tonight was in God the Father
[27:57] before there was even a molecule and you
[27:59] are nothing but the manifestation of the
[28:01] gene of life that was in God as a Son of
[28:03] God
[28:05] Amen now you're expressed after his word
[28:09] has come in you to light up this age
[28:12] amen you are expressing God's life in
[28:15] you because you are son or daughter of
[28:17] God and when you can hear that and you
[28:18] can say the same thing that that
[28:20] Jeremiah said I'm but a child I can't
[28:23] express you to this
[28:25] nation well that's that's a normal
[28:27] response but that response actually
[28:29] needed a correction from the Lord it
[28:31] needs
[28:32] corrected there's nothing wrong with
[28:35] understanding how frail or humanity is
[28:36] that's not a problem that's actually a
[28:38] healthy thing it's good to understand
[28:40] that we can't do it and we're not
[28:41] capable and we'll never accomplish it
[28:43] and man's a failure to begin with those
[28:45] things are wonderful to understand amen
[28:47] but that can never be an excuse to stop
[28:50] us from expressing what God's on the
[28:52] inside amen that's no excuse because his
[28:55] power is sufficient his grace is
[28:57] sufficient for us
[28:59] it's not what he's asked us to do it's
[29:01] what he's ordained for us to
[29:04] do so I'm going to read that sentence
[29:06] again now you're expressed after his
[29:07] word has come into you to light up this
[29:10] age you're expressing God's life in you
[29:12] because you're a son or daughter of God
[29:13] therefore you get what I mean you are
[29:16] you are now made you're sitting in this
[29:17] church tonight because your duty is to
[29:19] express God to this nation and this
[29:21] people this neighborhood where you
[29:23] associate wherever you are God knew that
[29:25] you would be here because you have to be
[29:27] one of his genes there his attributes
[29:29] you had to be if you ever if you got
[29:31] eternal life then it always was eternal
[29:33] life and God before there was a
[29:35] foundation of the world knew that you
[29:36] would be here and when the word or the
[29:38] water the washing of the water of the
[29:40] word fell on you it was expressed in a
[29:43] being man let's turn to Acts chapter 9
[29:46] together
[30:02] Acts chapter
[30:05] n verse
[30:08] 15 Acts chapter 9 verse1
[30:13] 15 but the Lord said unto him go thy way
[30:16] for he is a chosen vessel unto me to
[30:18] Bear my name before the Gentiles and
[30:20] Kings and the children of Israel for I
[30:22] will show him how great things he must
[30:24] suffer for my name's sake so this is the
[30:27] uh God's speaking to ananas ananas was
[30:29] the prophet that God was going to send
[30:31] Amen to pray for uh Paul Saul who would
[30:35] become Paul the Apostle amen was going
[30:37] to pray for him that his eyes would be
[30:38] open and he had objections because of
[30:40] the life that Saul lived because of the
[30:42] persecution but God says no listen you
[30:45] you're misunderstanding the whole
[30:46] picture you're not seeing this right
[30:48] you're seeing a man who's persecuting
[30:50] the church and Hauling them to prison
[30:52] and has letters from the high priest
[30:54] you're seeing a persecutor of the church
[30:56] but I see
[30:58] amen something
[30:59] else I see beyond the flesh I see what's
[31:03] underneath the flesh you're seeing a
[31:05] persecutor of the church I'm seeing a
[31:07] chosen
[31:08] vessel he said go go thy way for he is a
[31:11] chosen vessel to me to Bear my name
[31:12] before Gentiles and kings and children
[31:15] of Israel amen God listen God never
[31:18] picked Saul because Saul was doing a
[31:20] good job so God said you're doing a good
[31:21] job I'll pick you he was doing a h a
[31:23] horrible job he was persecuting the very
[31:26] thing that he was ordained to uphold he
[31:29] was against the very thing he was going
[31:31] to travel the world
[31:33] proclaiming so you think Paul could have
[31:35] any confidence in his flesh his flesh
[31:37] had led him the wrong way in the and
[31:40] with the Gospel of Jesus Christ he was
[31:42] against it attacking it attacking the
[31:44] people who carried the carried the
[31:46] message of the hour amen but God knew
[31:48] that he ordained him for a different
[31:50] purpose and in due time when the time
[31:52] was right God would come down and call
[31:55] him out and express to him what his
[31:57] purpose really is amen and then Paul
[32:00] would have to die to everything he ever
[32:01] thought before and live to this what God
[32:05] had told
[32:06] him and I could I could I probably I I
[32:10] bet Paul could come up with a whole list
[32:12] of reasons why he couldn't do
[32:14] it God you you chose the wrong guy you
[32:16] shouldn't pick me I've been a persecutor
[32:18] of the church I've done this I've said
[32:20] that I've done this hey it doesn't
[32:23] change
[32:24] anything cuz God ordained it before the
[32:26] foundation of the world so let's go look
[32:28] at the uh Galatians chapter
[32:34] 1 Galatians chapter
[32:44] 1 Galatians chapter 1:1
[32:49] 15 Paul the Apostle again here speaking
[32:52] he says in Galatians 1:15 but when it
[32:54] pleased God who separated me from my
[32:56] mother's womb and called me by his
[32:58] Grace so who separated Paul from his
[33:01] mother's
[33:02] womb it was God and after God has
[33:06] separated from his mother womb brought
[33:07] him on Earth at the appointed time amen
[33:09] Paul had lived such a life that
[33:11] eventually led him to persecuting of the
[33:13] church but God it was God who separated
[33:15] from his mother's womb God ordained the
[33:17] time that he would come on the earth and
[33:18] begin to express but then God also knew
[33:21] the time he would call him yeah amen and
[33:24] so he he he list both here he said but
[33:26] when it pleased God who separated me
[33:28] from my mother's womb and called me by
[33:30] his grace to reveal his son in me that I
[33:34] might preach him among the Heathen
[33:36] immediately I confer not with flesh and
[33:37] blood and he talks about going to the
[33:38] Wilderness of Arabia but I love this
[33:41] statement I'm going to read it again I
[33:43] want to emphasize it but when it pleased
[33:45] God who separated me from my mother's
[33:46] womb and called me by his grace to
[33:48] reveal his son in
[33:51] me so what was God's purpose in Paul to
[33:55] reveal his son in him
[33:58] amen that's what God called him by his
[34:00] grace for that was God's purpose in Paul
[34:02] to reveal his son which is Christ in
[34:07] Paul that's what God wanted Paul to do
[34:11] amen let's go over to chapter 2
[34:13] now verse
[34:18] 20 Galatians 2 and 20 I'm crucified with
[34:22] Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but
[34:25] Christ liveth in me and and the life
[34:28] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[34:30] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[34:33] and gave himself for
[34:34] me so Paul is not even claiming to live
[34:39] by his own
[34:42] faith it's not his faith yeah because
[34:45] his faith had him persecuting the church
[34:48] right but now the life that he lives
[34:51] because he's died and been resurrected
[34:53] in Christ Jesus the life that he lives
[34:55] now he lives by the faith of the Son of
[34:59] God this is God's Own Faith this is the
[35:01] faith of Jesus Christ himself that's in
[35:04] Paul amen after Paul's conversion and
[35:07] his new birth he's now not living amen
[35:10] he's not living on the outside man he's
[35:12] living by the faith of the Son of God
[35:14] and the faith of the Son of God is
[35:17] expressing the Son of God because God
[35:19] wanted uh his son to be revealed in Paul
[35:22] amen so he put the faith of the Son of
[35:24] God in Paul to express the son of God
[35:27] amen so you see it wasn't Paul outer man
[35:30] Paul it was the gene of God that God had
[35:33] ordained for this expression and God
[35:35] supplied everything Paul would need to
[35:37] express what God ordained Paul to
[35:40] express man it's really
[35:42] important in the message communion
[35:44] brother Brenham makes this statement
[35:46] he's talking about as he lived life
[35:48] there was something in him that would
[35:49] stir at different times in life and he's
[35:51] talking about that seed that was there
[35:53] inside of him and he says what was it he
[35:57] said there was another William
[35:59] brandham see a little spot of eternal
[36:02] life down there from the genes of God
[36:05] the word of God that was placed in there
[36:07] each one of you can think of similar
[36:09] things it was working so it was
[36:12] something that he would have a pull to
[36:13] things or couldn't do things other kids
[36:15] would do and he says that was that Gene
[36:16] of God in him there it was always in him
[36:19] he
[36:20] said and so he says what was it he said
[36:23] there was another William
[36:25] brandham now listen I don't think it was
[36:28] a replica of the outer man on the inner
[36:32] man because the outer man was the one
[36:35] that came wrong it was born wrong it was
[36:37] born in sin it was shaped in iniquity
[36:39] come to the world speaking lies and it
[36:41] became uh The Vessel of the Tabernacle
[36:43] of William brandom but I think what he's
[36:45] telling us is there's not another one of
[36:47] these down in there but there's the
[36:50] original version of this down in
[36:53] there the original one the life that God
[36:56] wanted to express there's another
[36:58] William brandom down on the inside and
[37:00] oh I like to think that there's another
[37:02] Chad Lamb down on the inside but I don't
[37:04] want it to be a replica of the outside
[37:06] man I don't want that one I want the one
[37:09] that was in his mind originally that he
[37:11] intended to be expressed that's the one
[37:13] that I hopes down on the inside the
[37:16] original one the one that he wanted to
[37:18] express through from the very
[37:20] beginning that part of his word that he
[37:23] designated to be
[37:25] me that's the other one that's down on
[37:27] the
[37:29] inside in the message Shalom he says but
[37:32] really frankly we have never seen each
[37:35] other did you know that we have never
[37:37] seen one another you hear something
[37:39] speaking out of my body here that
[37:42] impersonates whatever is on the inside
[37:44] so then when we talk to each other we're
[37:47] really not talking to the body it's the
[37:49] spirit inside but the body is the thing
[37:52] that identifies the spirit that's on the
[37:54] inside and therefore when we speak to
[37:56] each other quick we can understand right
[37:58] away whether we are Christians or not
[38:00] because there's a fellowship in the
[38:01] spirit that we talk from you see that it
[38:04] vibrates to one another that whether we
[38:06] are Christians or not therefore we have
[38:08] never seen each
[38:10] other I love that you know why I love
[38:13] that amen because you have never really
[38:15] seen
[38:17] me you have never really seen what makes
[38:20] up me what is the the the genuine me
[38:23] that God intended to be me which was a
[38:25] portion of himself that he was his word
[38:27] that he wanted expressed in a certain
[38:29] time period amen that he wanted to be me
[38:32] that is me and you've never really seen
[38:35] me yeah that Thrills me because you may
[38:38] have seen me do all kinds of bad things
[38:40] in the past amen but now I can say you
[38:42] never saw me brother Chad I saw you
[38:45] steal and I saw you lie and I saw you do
[38:47] this and I saw you do that and I could
[38:49] say praise God you've never actually
[38:51] really seen
[38:53] me you've seen an expression amen that
[38:55] came through this body and that old
[38:57] expression was from an old life but that
[38:59] old life died and now it's resurrected
[39:01] in the newness of life that original
[39:03] life and now that is expressing through
[39:05] this
[39:07] shell but it's something else what is it
[39:10] another William brandham down on the
[39:13] inside an invisible union he says how
[39:17] did you come to do this you were
[39:19] deceived into it by your first marriage
[39:22] to your adulterous parent Eve it's not
[39:24] it's no fault of your own by your
[39:26] natural birth you come after Eve he
[39:28] committed adultery uh who committed
[39:30] adultery that's the reason you was born
[39:33] an adulterous you're a sinner to begin
[39:35] with that's right you was deceived into
[39:37] it you had it ain't your fault you never
[39:41] did it because the little germ that was
[39:44] in you was to be you before the
[39:47] foundation of the world when God put
[39:49] your name on the Lamb's Book of
[39:51] Life oh I'm so thankful for that
[39:55] friends we were born wrong we were born
[39:58] Amen in sin we come through
[40:00] hybridization in this outer man which is
[40:02] our our human Spirit which is the spirit
[40:04] of the world in this flesh body and it
[40:06] and we came wrong with the wrong
[40:08] expression but down inside was a little
[40:11] portion of God that in due time he would
[40:14] send the washing of the water the word
[40:15] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost would
[40:17] Quicken that thing to life and that he
[40:19] said he said that little germ that was
[40:22] in you was to be
[40:25] you originally in God's original plan
[40:28] that you would get a body that wasn't
[40:30] hybrid that you would be born amen and
[40:32] and and brother Stan was expressing this
[40:34] on Wednesday night if we would have come
[40:36] according to the perfect will of God
[40:39] Amen we wouldn't have come through
[40:40] hybridization we would have come what
[40:42] would he have done he would have
[40:43] gathered however he did it I'm not
[40:44] saying how he would have done it I don't
[40:46] know amen all I know is what he did I
[40:48] don't know how he would have but he
[40:50] would have gathered these elements of
[40:52] the earth together amen and placed that
[40:54] life inside and that life would have
[40:56] expressed through these elements but it
[40:58] wouldn't come it wouldn't come with a
[41:00] fallen nature with a fallen spirit with
[41:02] the spirit of the earth it would have
[41:04] the right Spirit and the right
[41:05] expression from the very beginning and
[41:07] there would have been no struggle inside
[41:09] of me to express God Amen it would have
[41:11] been natural it would have been the life
[41:13] that was meant to be me would have been
[41:15] put in the right vessel with the right
[41:17] spirit and would have expressed God
[41:19] yeah but now we came the wrong way and
[41:22] so we have this outer man to contend
[41:24] with and the problem is we start looking
[41:27] in the mirror and start thinking that
[41:29] you know this is who I am oh but I want
[41:31] to look in the mirror of the word and
[41:33] find out who I really
[41:34] am so that gives me courage to express
[41:37] what God wants me to express yes sir
[41:40] let's go to 1 John
[41:43] 4:4 1 John chapter
[41:51] 4 this is what we ended with last time
[41:56] this scripture we I don't know if it was
[41:58] the last one but it was towards the end
[42:00] 1 John
[42:02] 44 you are of God little children and
[42:05] have overcome them because greater is he
[42:07] that is in you than he that is in the
[42:10] world remember we started talking about
[42:12] brother talked about your flesh and how
[42:14] we're hybrid born and come the wrong way
[42:16] and that flesh with its senses is the
[42:17] evil one that's where the world is
[42:20] working in our flesh but greater is he
[42:22] that's in me than he that's in the
[42:24] world and that's what we're depending on
[42:27] that Gene of God that wants to
[42:30] express and so what did God place inside
[42:33] of us in our soul that he would Quicken
[42:36] to life one day it was a portion of
[42:39] himself it was a portion of
[42:41] himself and that portion of himself amen
[42:44] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[42:46] came alive or came into expression amen
[42:48] and began to grow and express what he
[42:50] wanted us to express and and brother
[42:53] Brenham makes this statement and show us
[42:55] the father
[42:58] said uh a woman said who did he pray to
[43:01] In The Garden of Gethsemane on the
[43:03] street meet on a street meeting one time
[43:05] I said I want to ask you something you
[43:07] testify you had the Holy Ghost where is
[43:10] it at what do you pray to it's on the
[43:12] inside of you of course well we have the
[43:15] spirit with measure he had it without
[43:17] measure we are Sons and Daughters of God
[43:19] by measure like take a spoonful of water
[43:21] out of the ocean and he's the whole
[43:24] ocean but the same chemicals that's in
[43:27] the spoon is in the whole ocean right
[43:30] it's quantity but the same
[43:34] quality therefore Jesus Christ the same
[43:36] yesterday today forever God in
[43:41] us
[43:42] amen and the message is is I be not
[43:45] afraid he says now if I went to the
[43:47] ocean and took like this little gift
[43:49] that he gives me if I went to the ocean
[43:50] and took a spoonful out of the ocean
[43:52] that's about in comparison this little
[43:54] gift here is just like a spoonful of
[43:56] water out of the oce
[43:57] and he's the whole ocean but did you
[43:59] know if you examine that little spot
[44:01] that you got in you and that little spot
[44:03] I got in me the same chemicals is in the
[44:06] Spoonful that's in the whole
[44:11] ocean that's
[44:14] wonderful that's why God is all in
[44:17] all but Jesus Christ was the fullness of
[44:20] the godhead bod he was that whole ocean
[44:22] of the word of the fullness of God
[44:25] expressed in one man right but where was
[44:29] I in that expression I was there brother
[44:31] B said because I'm part of that word so
[44:34] when all the ocean yeah when all the
[44:37] ocean amen that represents God Amen was
[44:40] bottled up and confined in Jesus Christ
[44:43] where was I I was there yeah and then
[44:47] when God wants to express me he'll take
[44:49] a little teaspoon out of that ocean amen
[44:52] that's why none of us can be the full
[44:54] expression of Jesus Christ we can't be
[44:56] Jesus Christ but we are part of that
[44:58] life and we're a portion of that and a
[45:01] small portion and however small the
[45:03] portion and however tiny you get the
[45:05] portion brother B said all the chemicals
[45:08] that's in the whole ocean is in you just
[45:10] a smaller quantity
[45:12] yeah oh praise God this is so so
[45:16] wonderful the reason it's so wonderful
[45:18] is because brother B starts talking
[45:19] about the SE Gene of God that's on the
[45:21] inside and when we look at this this
[45:23] whole concept of genes and the
[45:25] understanding of genes and genetics and
[45:27] DNA and all the things that were
[45:29] discovered Amen in the in this last
[45:32] century Amen in the last less than the
[45:34] last 100 years all that's been expressed
[45:36] and all that's been understood we begin
[45:38] to understand that what brother Brenham
[45:40] said is exactly the
[45:42] truth exactly the truth because uh well
[45:46] let's turn to First Corinthians and then
[45:47] I'll explain what's on my
[45:52] mind 1 Corinthians chapter 12
[46:06] 1 Corinthians 12:
[46:10] 18 but now hath God set in set the
[46:13] members every one of them in the body as
[46:16] it hath pleased him for if they were all
[46:18] one member where were the body but now
[46:21] are they many members but yet but one
[46:25] body let's go to verse 2 7 says now ye
[46:28] are the body of Christ and members in
[46:33] particular so brother B told us that
[46:35] that uh all that God was he poured into
[46:40] Christ Jesus Christ and he was bottled
[46:43] and confined in that vessel Jesus Christ
[46:45] but all that Christ was he poured where
[46:47] into the church so that full life that
[46:50] full ocean comes into his body that's on
[46:53] Earth yeah but that body that's on his
[46:56] Earth is broken to individual
[46:58] members so that we are members of that
[47:01] body but we can't claim to be the entire
[47:03] body we're just a member of that body
[47:06] amen amen and this is what becomes
[47:09] really interesting in the in the study
[47:11] of
[47:12] genetics is that every cell in your body
[47:17] I say most every cell so we're just
[47:19] speaking in general terms there are
[47:20] cells in your body that are a little
[47:21] different but in general terms most
[47:24] every cell in your body contains a full
[47:27] strand of DNA
[47:30] amen that means everything that makes
[47:33] you what you are is in every single cell
[47:37] of your body yeah your DNA is the
[47:41] complete blueprint and instructions in
[47:43] code of your entire life amen what your
[47:46] blood type is is in your DNA your hair
[47:47] color is in your DNA amen the color of
[47:50] eyes in your DNA amen your skin tone in
[47:53] your DNA everything about your life is
[47:57] in your
[47:58] DNA you you
[48:01] are an expression of your
[48:04] DNA everything we see is an expression
[48:07] of your Gene your genetics your
[48:11] DNA but every cell every for the most
[48:15] part every cell in your body has the
[48:18] same
[48:21] DNA that means the little cell that's in
[48:24] my eye has the same DNA as the little
[48:27] cell that's in my toenail yeah it's in
[48:30] the root of my toenail same cell our
[48:33] same DNA right so so no part can call
[48:37] Another Part greater or
[48:40] lesser because every part has everything
[48:43] that's in your body is in that part yeah
[48:46] all the same information is not lacking
[48:48] anything it has everything everything
[48:50] that's in a brain cell is everything
[48:52] that's in a liver cell yeah amen the
[48:56] difference is there's only a certain
[48:58] segment of that amen there's a certain
[49:00] segment of that that's activated amen
[49:03] for for gene replication to make
[49:05] proteins to make whatever it's supposed
[49:07] to be doing so a liver cell is not
[49:10] supposed to be making brain
[49:12] cells a liver cell is supposed to be
[49:15] making liver cells and then liver
[49:16] enzymes and things that help you break
[49:19] down toxins in your body amen and it's
[49:21] got that function to do and God placed
[49:23] that cell in the body to serve a certain
[49:26] portion and that cell has everything a
[49:29] brain cell
[49:30] has but because of its position God only
[49:34] unlocks a certain portion of that DNA
[49:37] and because of its position that DNA
[49:39] will only replicate what's open yeah or
[49:43] what it's designated for so that that
[49:45] that same cell I mean that DNA that's in
[49:48] a liver cell could make a brain cell
[49:50] could
[49:51] make part of your nervous system it
[49:53] could make whatever whatever is needing
[49:56] body it could make it but because of the
[49:58] position it's in and its location
[49:59] determines what part of that information
[50:02] will be
[50:04] expressed
[50:06] right so what's in
[50:09] you what's in you amen what's in you is
[50:14] the very Mind Of God what's in you is
[50:16] you say well just a portion just a
[50:17] teaspoon what's in the teaspoon
[50:19] everything that's in the ocean is in the
[50:21] teaspoon right but because of its
[50:24] position and there's also genes that are
[50:26] activated by certain other
[50:29] factors so there's there's outside
[50:31] factors that affect uh uh that affect uh
[50:35] genetics so your body is sitting here
[50:38] your body is reacting to the environment
[50:40] all the time it's reacting it's
[50:42] constantly moving it's constantly
[50:43] working amen if all of a sudden we crank
[50:45] up the temperature and we get the heat
[50:47] really soaring in here your body is
[50:49] going to begin to sweat what makes your
[50:51] body sweat amen it's genes and the DNA
[50:54] amen it's acting on a certain condition
[50:56] and the condition condition the
[50:58] condition requires a response of
[51:00] genetics that's in a certain portion of
[51:01] your body goes into action to what save
[51:03] your
[51:05] body amen so there's different ways in
[51:08] which amen the gene is expressed in your
[51:10] life it's expressed amen by the position
[51:13] that it's in and it's expressed by the
[51:16] conditions that are around
[51:18] it amen you know what that
[51:22] means everything that's in any other
[51:24] part of the body is in you yeah
[51:27] everything that's in any other part of
[51:29] the body is in
[51:30] you amen that means the full potential
[51:33] for everything is inside of you the full
[51:37] potential for the full life of God the
[51:38] full power everything that was expressed
[51:41] amen is in
[51:43] you and God can express it anytime he
[51:46] wants
[51:47] amen amen it's not that we have to get
[51:50] something else from God it's already in
[51:52] you if if just a small portion of God is
[51:55] in you then everything that's in God is
[51:58] in that small portion and God can
[52:00] express anything he wants through
[52:02] you but there's certain positions that
[52:05] he's placed each one of us in and he's
[52:06] placed Us in that position in the body
[52:08] and as he put that in that position it
[52:11] unlocks a certain portion of Christ to
[52:13] be expressed in you amen expressed as a
[52:16] man expressed as a woman expressed as a
[52:18] husband expressed as a father expressed
[52:20] as a Young Man expressed as an old man
[52:22] expressed in whatever whatever position
[52:24] you hold there's a certain part part of
[52:27] that DNA that's open for expression
[52:30] amen
[52:32] amen so that's why we don't need to
[52:34] worry about what somebody else is doing
[52:36] over in some other part of the body
[52:38] worry about what the hands are doing or
[52:39] what the foot is doing because there's
[52:41] no way that we can be in competition
[52:43] with one another nor is it necessary
[52:45] that we all do the same
[52:47] thing it's certainly not necessary that
[52:49] we have the same gift it's certainly not
[52:51] necessary that we have the same position
[52:53] because I don't want every member in my
[52:54] body doing the same thing
[52:57] right I want certain parts of my body
[53:00] working all the time constantly
[53:02] replicating making new blood cells amen
[53:05] making white blood cells amen making uh
[53:07] nerve uh uh more more nerves in my body
[53:10] for my neurological system constantly
[53:12] refreshing the cells in my lungs and in
[53:14] my liver I want that doing all the time
[53:16] amen but the portion of the gene that
[53:18] decided to make my
[53:20] ears I only want it to work for a
[53:22] certain period of time and I want it to
[53:25] stop cuz I don't want my de ears
[53:27] dragging the ground as I walk along yeah
[53:31] but the same the same DNA that triggered
[53:35] my body when I was in the womb of my
[53:36] mother to start forming ears and as I
[53:38] grow amen grew my ears amen but decided
[53:41] they're long enough stop amen what was
[53:43] it that was programmed into the DNA and
[53:45] it happened without me thinking about it
[53:47] amen it happened without me directing it
[53:50] it was already programmed on the inside
[53:52] of the DNA and where it fell in the
[53:54] season it fell and deter mined what
[53:56] would be expressed yeah amen amen you
[54:01] know the same the same uh Gene the same
[54:04] gene of God that you have in you now is
[54:06] the same quality of the gene of God that
[54:08] Luther had in
[54:10] him praise God Amen but the season
[54:12] Lutheran dictated how far Luther would
[54:15] grow amen and the whole Lutheran age
[54:18] they were growing in response to the
[54:19] conditions around them amen and they
[54:21] grew in response to the season that they
[54:24] were in amen you plant a wheat plant in
[54:26] in the ground that seed has the full
[54:28] life everything that will ever be in
[54:30] that wheat is in that seed amen and you
[54:33] put it in the ground amen and it takes a
[54:35] certain condition for it to germinate
[54:37] amen and to begin to rot and Decay and
[54:38] to bring forth life and until the
[54:40] condition's right it just lays there and
[54:42] lays there and lays there and lays there
[54:44] but when the signals are all right amen
[54:47] something inside of that seed starts to
[54:49] move yeah amen it starts to replicate
[54:53] and it starts to deteriorate it starts
[54:54] to change things and then it comes and
[54:56] pokes out of the ground with a little
[54:58] bit of life amen and there's a certain
[55:00] season amen that it that it does that in
[55:03] amen so that it can grow at the right
[55:05] pace for the right season yeah
[55:08] amen and that's what God has done with
[55:10] his church
[55:12] yeah that's why when when the
[55:14] Resurrection comes and we all amen we
[55:17] all find ourselves in the marriage
[55:18] supper of the Lamb amen we're not going
[55:20] to be better than
[55:22] lutherans right amen we're not going to
[55:25] be better than the Luther age or the
[55:27] Wesley age or any other age or the Dark
[55:29] Age Saints amen everybody expressed what
[55:32] they were supposed to express in the
[55:34] season they were supposed to express it
[55:35] and they could not express anything else
[55:38] because if you express the wrong thing
[55:39] in the wrong season you'll kill the
[55:41] whole plant yeah amen if it germinates
[55:45] it comes forth before the warmth is
[55:46] there amen and there's another Frost the
[55:48] whole thing dies again it's got to be
[55:50] the right season the right expression
[55:53] and the right season and it's all baked
[55:55] into the DNA
[55:57] and it's responding to the conditions
[55:59] that are around
[56:01] it amen what moved Luther was the
[56:06] conditions all around him the conditions
[56:09] that were around him began to to move on
[56:11] him and God ordained it all because
[56:13] there was something inside of Martin
[56:14] Luther to be expressed and so God was
[56:17] changing the conditions because it now
[56:19] time for that seed to pop back out of
[56:21] the ground and bring forth that little
[56:22] Sprout of life and it happened in the
[56:24] Lutheran age cuz that was the season for
[56:26] it but it couldn't happen in the Hot
[56:28] August Sun it would have burned up and
[56:29] it would have never finished growing it
[56:31] had to come forth in the
[56:33] springtime and then little by little it
[56:35] began to come up because it was the life
[56:38] of God being expressed that's why there
[56:41] are brothers and sisters and they're not
[56:42] diminished in any way from you and
[56:47] I they can't
[56:49] be because they could only express the
[56:52] part of God that was meet and due season
[56:56] yeah amen and God would change the light
[56:59] the level of word to bring forth more
[57:03] growth cuz God was in control of opening
[57:05] the word amen shining the light and God
[57:08] in each season amen he would bring more
[57:11] light to bring more growth because it
[57:12] was already in the
[57:14] seed he would bring revelation of the
[57:17] word and that revelation of the word
[57:18] would bring a response from the inside
[57:20] and the Believers would grow by that
[57:23] Revelation and they would grow through
[57:25] the Lutheran age through the Wesley to
[57:26] the Pentecostal age and now to this
[57:29] age and what are we doing we're only
[57:32] responding to the condition of the age
[57:37] but what life is responding listen it's
[57:39] not your natural
[57:41] life it's not your natural life that's
[57:43] responding it's his life on the
[57:48] inside that's
[57:50] why oh I just I want to change if I
[57:55] could if I could just I wish I could
[57:57] just change the way I think amen I wish
[57:59] I wish so bad I could reprogram myself
[58:02] because you realize we think wrong so
[58:05] wrong about circumstances and situations
[58:07] and our body and our mind give us wrong
[58:08] signals all the time but the revelation
[58:11] of this hour come to lift us out of this
[58:13] condition to begin to teach us and show
[58:15] us amen the way we should respond to
[58:17] things because when things begin to
[58:19] happen and conditions begin to change
[58:21] around us amen then there's something on
[58:24] the inside that can respond to those
[58:26] conditions there's something that's
[58:28] naturally there like I I I gave for
[58:30] instance the example if we turn up the
[58:32] heat your body will begin to sweat
[58:34] that's a mechanism of protection for the
[58:36] body you don't have to think about it it
[58:38] just does all of a sudden you realize
[58:39] I'm sweating and I never thought about
[58:41] sweating it just happens how did it
[58:44] happen it was a response to the
[58:45] condition amen what did go what God God
[58:48] allows certain conditions in our life
[58:49] and we get so worried sometimes about
[58:51] how we'll handle this and how we'll
[58:53] handle that but the reality is there's
[58:55] something on the inside already
[58:57] programmed to handle the condition and
[58:59] God wouldn't allow the condition unless
[59:01] he knew it was time for another
[59:04] expression and we get so frustrated with
[59:06] the condition and we don't know what to
[59:08] do about the condition and we don't know
[59:09] what to do about the trial and why is it
[59:11] so hard and you don't realize that God's
[59:13] orchestrating everything everything's
[59:15] ordained of God Amen we get into the Hot
[59:17] August son of the wheat plant and all of
[59:19] a sudden it's baking everything
[59:21] everything's dying everything's drying
[59:22] out and there's no more greenness and I
[59:24] say why is it so hot and why is there no
[59:26] rain and why don't we because the seed
[59:29] needs to express the life of again and
[59:31] the life is moving into the
[59:35] seed God is the conditions around us are
[59:40] here to do what bring out that
[59:43] life but it's not something that comes
[59:45] from our
[59:47] brains this is the problem and this is
[59:49] what I I I was so uh touched and
[59:54] encouraged and learned so much much with
[59:56] brother Stan and the way he was
[59:58] expressing that the enemy is here this
[1:00:00] is death the carnal mind is
[1:00:03] death but the spiritual mind is
[1:00:06] life and so God has placed in us what we
[1:00:12] need to overcome in this life it's
[1:00:16] already in us he's already quickened it
[1:00:18] to life it's already there amen and it's
[1:00:21] got the it's got all the information in
[1:00:25] it
[1:00:27] amen whatever we read about in the Bible
[1:00:30] whatever's been expressed in the Bible
[1:00:32] is in
[1:00:33] you every Miracle everything everything
[1:00:36] that created that Miracle everything
[1:00:37] that created the faith it's in
[1:00:40] you but it can only be expressed in a
[1:00:42] certain season certain time under God's
[1:00:44] expression when we talk about members of
[1:00:46] the body uh we go back to this idea that
[1:00:49] every cell in your body has the same DNA
[1:00:51] amen so the the DNA in in in uh uh I
[1:00:56] actually it was it was funny I was
[1:00:57] looking up trying to understand this and
[1:00:59] make sure I understood it right I was
[1:01:00] watching a little little kids video so
[1:01:03] anyways to understand science things I
[1:01:04] watch the kids
[1:01:05] videos I don't watch the lectures on
[1:01:08] University I go and find the one for
[1:01:10] like the fifth graders and if I don't
[1:01:12] understand I go to the third graders but
[1:01:14] anyways I was somewhere in elementary
[1:01:16] school DNA and I
[1:01:19] was and I was looking at this and they
[1:01:21] were saying it was just amazing how
[1:01:24] simple it is amen but
[1:01:26] you've got cells in your eye amen that
[1:01:28] will create the the the mucus that
[1:01:30] surrounds your eye or the pigment in
[1:01:32] your eye or the uh uh optic nerve in
[1:01:35] your eye and all these things are
[1:01:36] created by cells cells are producing
[1:01:38] this and producing the proteins that
[1:01:40] create all this and they're doing it all
[1:01:41] the time but then you got you got cells
[1:01:44] in your stomach that are producing
[1:01:46] hydrochloric acid to to break down your
[1:01:49] food all
[1:01:51] right but the cell in your stomach could
[1:01:55] make eye Pig
[1:01:57] cuz it has the information it's the same
[1:02:00] DNA but because it's in your stomach it
[1:02:03] only unlock that portion to make that if
[1:02:06] it's if it's in the certain portion of
[1:02:07] your stomach to make the acid that
[1:02:09] breaks down your
[1:02:10] food but what if the cell in your eye
[1:02:14] that makes the mucus that covers your
[1:02:15] eye decided to make hydrochloric
[1:02:21] acid that wouldn't be
[1:02:23] comfortable that's what they said on the
[1:02:25] fifth grade science thing in fact it was
[1:02:28] a cartoon character with flames in his
[1:02:30] eyes and I got it I understood
[1:02:38] that but that's
[1:02:41] why we shouldn't strive to be everything
[1:02:43] and replicate every gift and try I want
[1:02:46] to be like this brother I want to be
[1:02:47] like that brother we shouldn't want to
[1:02:49] do that amen we should just want to be
[1:02:51] what God made us to be and trust that
[1:02:53] God will bring out of us what he's
[1:02:54] ordained to bring out of us because what
[1:02:56] he had for Paul is not what he had for
[1:02:58] Peter and what he had for Peter was not
[1:03:00] what he had for John he had a different
[1:03:01] work for them all to do and they had to
[1:03:03] stay in their place and just do just
[1:03:05] live that portion of God that was in
[1:03:07] them although everything that was in
[1:03:09] Paul was in John and everything was in
[1:03:10] John was in Peter and everything that
[1:03:12] was in Peter was in Mary and everything
[1:03:14] that was in in Paul who was writing out
[1:03:16] the text amen that would become the
[1:03:18] Bible that all the Believers would read
[1:03:20] everything that was in Paul is in me
[1:03:23] amen I'm not deficient amen you're not
[1:03:26] deficient none of us are def deficient
[1:03:28] in God if you're a child of God a c
[1:03:31] genene of God you're not deficient in
[1:03:33] God and that means no matter what
[1:03:35] position you hold amen you're there to
[1:03:38] express wherever he placed you will
[1:03:40] bring an expression if God Amen if God
[1:03:42] gave you children then there's something
[1:03:44] inside of you that will Express father
[1:03:47] because he's a father and if he gave you
[1:03:49] the children then there's something
[1:03:51] locked inside of you that in that
[1:03:53] position amen if we'll just trust it
[1:03:55] amen and not go with all the psychology
[1:03:57] and all the mental things and all the
[1:03:59] ideas that been traditional if we'll
[1:04:01] just trust God there's a portion of God
[1:04:03] that wants to be expressed as father and
[1:04:05] if he puts you in that position there's
[1:04:06] something in you that'll make you a good
[1:04:12] father problem is we try to replicate
[1:04:14] somebody else and we try to replicate
[1:04:16] some idea or some amen but it's already
[1:04:19] in you God's given you a gift amen he's
[1:04:23] already placed in you amen that gift and
[1:04:25] how to operate operate that we shouldn't
[1:04:26] want somebody else's gift amen we should
[1:04:28] only want to be what God's called us to
[1:04:30] be because if I try if God made me to
[1:04:33] create hydrochloric acid but I want to
[1:04:35] jump in the eyeball
[1:04:36] and right you see it's so
[1:04:40] simple but there can be such a
[1:04:43] rest if we would just allow this to be
[1:04:45] true yeah amen and stop questioning
[1:04:48] everything and why am I not and why why
[1:04:50] is this one and why and just let God do
[1:04:54] what he wants with us amen and just
[1:04:56] relax and trust that there's something
[1:04:59] in Greater is he that's in me than he
[1:05:00] that's in the world and I was thinking
[1:05:03] you think about a a mother who's in her
[1:05:07] home raising her children brother
[1:05:09] Brenham said that Mom is the Fifth
[1:05:11] Gospel and she said mom is a pastor to
[1:05:14] her children is that
[1:05:17] right well you know what the gene for
[1:05:21] pastor is in her yeah right amen just as
[1:05:26] much as the gene is in me for pastor
[1:05:28] that gift is in me that portion of God
[1:05:30] calling me to this gift the same thing
[1:05:32] is in a
[1:05:33] mother now she may not be called to
[1:05:36] stand behind the pull pit but whatever
[1:05:38] that is that's in me amen that gives me
[1:05:40] the ability to understand what's needed
[1:05:42] or to shepher to flock that same thing's
[1:05:44] in mom if she's in her position that
[1:05:46] same information's there right it can
[1:05:48] give her the answers and give her the
[1:05:49] leadership and give her the direction
[1:05:51] for these little this little
[1:05:52] flock the same thing in a father cuz
[1:05:55] he's called to be high priest of his
[1:05:56] home amen so what's what's inside of him
[1:05:59] he's got the same potential as the one
[1:06:01] who stands and preaches behind the pull
[1:06:03] pit to lead his family he may not have
[1:06:05] the same gift it may not have the same
[1:06:06] expression but that portion of God is in
[1:06:09] him and if he's got to lead and answer
[1:06:11] questions it's in
[1:06:13] him so no matter where you are in the
[1:06:16] body you've got the full
[1:06:20] DNA you got the full DNA it's all there
[1:06:24] it's either
[1:06:26] going to express according to your
[1:06:29] position or it'll begin to express
[1:06:32] according to the condition amen and
[1:06:35] it'll be doing both your body's doing
[1:06:36] both yeah right now certain things in
[1:06:39] your body are expressing because of its
[1:06:41] position and certain things in your body
[1:06:43] are expressing because of the
[1:06:46] condition there are certain things that
[1:06:48] only go into action when things change
[1:06:50] when you get a virus or you get a
[1:06:52] bacterial infection then certain parts
[1:06:53] of your body go into action and they may
[1:06:56] lay there
[1:06:57] inactive in between
[1:06:59] sicknesses which is a good
[1:07:02] thing amen but it's there it's there
[1:07:07] it's waiting and you can say well you
[1:07:09] know immune system I haven't seen much
[1:07:11] out of you
[1:07:12] lately are you still part of the body or
[1:07:17] what what have you done for me
[1:07:21] lately I don't want that part to be
[1:07:24] overactive I only want it to move when
[1:07:25] it's called on to
[1:07:29] move amen amen you know every gift is in
[1:07:33] you every gift is in you there may be
[1:07:37] one that you're called to express or
[1:07:39] more than one the spirit divided severly
[1:07:41] as will but they're all in you as part
[1:07:43] of the gene of God and God can express
[1:07:44] it any time he want remember brother
[1:07:46] Benham said a gift of Prophecy can fall
[1:07:48] on somebody one time and God will never
[1:07:50] use them again that doesn't make them a
[1:07:52] prophet or hold the office of a prophet
[1:07:54] but God can use anybody it can fall once
[1:07:56] they can prophesy or have tongues and
[1:07:58] interpretation and never again their
[1:08:00] whole
[1:08:01] life who orchestrated that
[1:08:04] God
[1:08:06] Amen so the potential listen I I hope we
[1:08:09] can understand as we walk through this
[1:08:11] life the potential is already in me if I
[1:08:15] have the life of God in Me if I've been
[1:08:17] born again if I'm a ceg genene of God
[1:08:19] then the potential is in me in
[1:08:21] everything that I will face in this life
[1:08:24] the potential to overcome is already
[1:08:26] inside of
[1:08:30] me brother Brandon made this statement
[1:08:34] in 1961 he
[1:08:36] says he said if there wasn't a law to
[1:08:38] that Sons and Daughters of God would
[1:08:40] create them a world out there and go
[1:08:41] live a private life on it you have the
[1:08:43] power in you to do it if you've got a
[1:08:46] shadow of the power of God in you you
[1:08:48] got power to do it God is omnipotent see
[1:08:51] what I mean the power that's in you you
[1:08:53] could speak a world into existence and
[1:08:55] go live on it Hallelujah there you are
[1:08:58] that's what power is in the church now
[1:09:01] but it's controlled by a law and that
[1:09:04] law is not keeping a bunch of
[1:09:05] Commandments it's a law of Faith Jesus
[1:09:06] said all things are possible to them
[1:09:08] that believe and if you can believe
[1:09:10] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:09:12] believe that is
[1:09:14] yours so I want to ask you a question is
[1:09:17] there enough power in you to speak
[1:09:20] another world into existence and go live
[1:09:22] a private life on
[1:09:23] it there has to be our brother B was
[1:09:26] wrong so is there enough power in you to
[1:09:28] see a vision is there enough power in
[1:09:31] you to prophesy is there enough power in
[1:09:32] you to speak in Tong is there enough
[1:09:34] power in you to lay hands on the sick am
[1:09:37] yes it's there but it's controlled by a
[1:09:40] law there's an activator Gene that'll
[1:09:43] activate that part of the genetics and
[1:09:45] in your genetics there's things called
[1:09:46] activator genes amen there's something
[1:09:48] that triggers a certain part of your DNA
[1:09:50] to replicate to go into motion to do a
[1:09:52] certain job and there's certain
[1:09:54] conditions that that have to line up and
[1:09:56] when they line up it activates this part
[1:09:58] of this Gene and that Gene begins to
[1:09:59] replicate and whatever that function is
[1:10:01] in your body begins to function Hey
[1:10:03] listen what's the activator Gene for us
[1:10:05] it's Faith whatever God can give you to
[1:10:08] believe in your soul you can have yeah
[1:10:10] amen amen that's why sometimes you can
[1:10:13] be you can be witnessing to somebody or
[1:10:14] talking to a brother or sister amen and
[1:10:17] somebody asks a question and all of a
[1:10:18] sudden you give an answer right out of
[1:10:21] the word of God that absolutely blows
[1:10:23] you away and after you've done set it it
[1:10:25] amen it's almost like you want to clap
[1:10:27] your hands over your mouth and said
[1:10:28] where did that come from what was that
[1:10:31] that was the knowledge the word of
[1:10:33] knowledge that come from God Almighty
[1:10:35] amen that was the gift of wisdom Amen to
[1:10:37] take the word and apply to the situation
[1:10:39] and that may not be your gift but in
[1:10:41] that situation God had a vessel he can
[1:10:43] use and everything that's in every other
[1:10:45] vessel is in you right so why can't he
[1:10:48] do it in you he can do it when the need
[1:10:50] is there God Can Make It manifest in you
[1:10:53] amen or there's times that you'll talk
[1:10:55] to somebody and they'll be telling you a
[1:10:57] trial or a situation or something and
[1:11:00] you'll speak a word and you don't even
[1:11:01] have a clue what you said but you'll say
[1:11:03] something like it's finished brother
[1:11:05] it's going to be over
[1:11:06] now and you walk away and say why did I
[1:11:09] say it like that why did I say that and
[1:11:11] later you hear the testimony it was
[1:11:13] exactly the way you said
[1:11:15] it guess what you can't replicate that
[1:11:20] your brain can't replicate that you
[1:11:21] can't manufacture that you can't make
[1:11:23] that happen on your own that that's God
[1:11:25] inside of
[1:11:27] you and God there's enough there there's
[1:11:30] there's enough God in you to speak a
[1:11:33] world into
[1:11:35] existence even if it's a
[1:11:37] spoonful of God right CU all the
[1:11:41] chemicals that were in the ocean are in
[1:11:44] you every gift is available to you all
[1:11:47] the fruits of the spirit all the uh all
[1:11:50] the stature of a perfect man it's all in
[1:11:52] you Amen brother Ram starts talking
[1:11:55] statue of a perfect man add to your
[1:11:57] faith virtue and virtue patience and God
[1:11:59] is going all the way up and and and the
[1:12:01] way he's saying it it's like you need to
[1:12:03] add to and add to and and then you start
[1:12:05] thinking how am I going to add to and
[1:12:08] how am I going to conjure this up but he
[1:12:09] gets to one section and he says it's
[1:12:11] either statute of a perfect man or
[1:12:12] Blasphemous names he's talking of the
[1:12:14] same subject he says you don't add
[1:12:17] nothing it adds to you amen we read this
[1:12:20] last time where he says you don't have
[1:12:21] to worry if you're a dove you don't have
[1:12:23] to worry about about feathers the
[1:12:24] feathers will take care of itself cuz
[1:12:26] he's talking about a crow putting Dove
[1:12:27] feathers in or putting peacock feathers
[1:12:29] in trying to be something that's not you
[1:12:31] don't have to be anything that you're
[1:12:32] not you only need to be what God has
[1:12:35] ordained you to
[1:12:36] be and any time at any time under any
[1:12:40] circumstance God can activate another
[1:12:43] part of his
[1:12:44] DNA and you can speak a word of
[1:12:46] knowledge a Word of Wisdom a gift can
[1:12:49] manifest and it may only be one time in
[1:12:51] your whole life but it will manifest
[1:12:53] right
[1:12:55] sometimes we get confused and be like
[1:12:57] what was that and want to replicate that
[1:12:59] you can't replicate it friends you can't
[1:13:02] manufacture it it's
[1:13:05] gone so he says this law that
[1:13:10] controls this expression says you know
[1:13:13] you got enough power in you to create
[1:13:14] another world but that that power is
[1:13:17] controlled by a law and that law is
[1:13:19] Faith and he says so whatever God will
[1:13:22] lead your soul to believe that is yours
[1:13:27] and remember he's not saying whatever he
[1:13:30] leads your mind to believe whatever he
[1:13:32] can lead your soul to believe a genuine
[1:13:35] Revelation in the
[1:13:37] soul amen is is the
[1:13:40] faith and we know because Romans 10
[1:13:43] tells us that faith comes by hearing and
[1:13:47] by hearing the word of God
[1:13:50] amen
[1:13:51] amen question is so what can I do
[1:13:55] just sit around and do nothing and wait
[1:13:57] no I can't manufacture anything but what
[1:13:59] I can do is keep hearing the
[1:14:02] word keep feeding on the word you know
[1:14:05] every cell in my body is taking
[1:14:08] ingredients that I put in my body and
[1:14:09] doing work with it making it come to
[1:14:12] manifestation it's taking the food I eat
[1:14:14] and breaking it down into different
[1:14:15] substances and taking those substances
[1:14:17] and making my body and doing the
[1:14:18] functions and the work that I need to do
[1:14:20] amen may God be doing that in me as I
[1:14:22] feed on the word and give it good food
[1:14:24] good material to work
[1:14:26] with and that it begins to express
[1:14:29] because Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:14:30] hearing by the word of God I need to be
[1:14:33] hearing the word of God Amen so that
[1:14:35] faith can begin to
[1:14:37] operate how many times have you while
[1:14:40] you've been sitting in a sermon or
[1:14:41] listening to brother brandham or reading
[1:14:42] a book or reading your Bible and all of
[1:14:44] a sudden you're reading or you're
[1:14:46] listening and all of a sudden the answer
[1:14:47] comes bang like that amen just comes
[1:14:51] like that and you know that's the answer
[1:14:52] you know it's over with and you know the
[1:14:53] solution is there why because God faith
[1:14:56] cometh by hearing and faith is what
[1:14:58] apprehended that power that's in you is
[1:15:00] controlled by a law of Faith amen and
[1:15:04] Faith cometh by hearing the word of
[1:15:07] God
[1:15:10] Amen brother B
[1:15:13] says uh in Christ is the mystery God
[1:15:16] revealed now notice god making itself no
[1:15:19] not we're not supposed to make coners to
[1:15:21] Christianity by a government but by the
[1:15:24] revelation Christ in you as God was in
[1:15:26] Christ as God was in Christ Christ in
[1:15:30] you so what is it that's supposed to
[1:15:32] convert others Christ in
[1:15:35] you not a government not an order but
[1:15:38] Christ in you the life goes from one to
[1:15:40] the
[1:15:41] other when what God did in Christ Christ
[1:15:44] does in you what signs did God in Christ
[1:15:46] Christ does in you oh isn't that
[1:15:48] beautiful oh my I like that Jesus said
[1:15:50] at that day that's this day at that day
[1:15:53] when this Revelation is made known you
[1:15:55] will know that I am in the father and
[1:15:57] the father in me I in you and you in me
[1:16:01] when the Revelation is made manifest at
[1:16:03] that day you shall know that I and the
[1:16:05] father are one I am in the father and
[1:16:07] the father is in me then when the
[1:16:09] Revelation comes forth then it's I in
[1:16:11] you and you in me there you are let's go
[1:16:15] to John 14 pick up a scripture that's
[1:16:17] related to
[1:16:21] this John 14:9
[1:16:37] now
[1:16:40] Jesus in John 14:9 Jesus saith unto him
[1:16:44] have I been so long time with you and
[1:16:46] yet hast thou not known me Phillip he
[1:16:48] that has seen me ha seen the father and
[1:16:50] how sayest thou showest the father
[1:16:52] believest now that not believest not not
[1:16:55] thou that I am in the father and the
[1:16:57] father in me the words that I speak unto
[1:16:59] you I speak not of myself but the father
[1:17:01] that dwelleth in me he doeth The
[1:17:05] Works in all the works that Jesus did
[1:17:08] Jesus never took credit unto himself he
[1:17:10] said it was the father that dwell in
[1:17:13] him amen and the works that he did was
[1:17:16] an expression of the father in
[1:17:19] him remember when Stan uh brother Stan
[1:17:22] on Wednesday night was talking about
[1:17:24] Jesus Jesus at the pool of
[1:17:26] Bethesda who had healing power had a
[1:17:30] gift of healing had all the gifts in in
[1:17:32] in him and and could heal multitudes I
[1:17:34] mean there was times that that every
[1:17:35] sick person they brought to him he
[1:17:37] healed them all yeah and he walks into
[1:17:39] the pool of Bethesda where there's up to
[1:17:41] thousands there that all needed healing
[1:17:43] they were all seeking healing and here
[1:17:45] he was amen the Healer himself and and
[1:17:48] he has to walk through the crowds to get
[1:17:50] to one why because because because Jesus
[1:17:53] Christ the man it wasn't him it was God
[1:17:56] in him it was the father that did the
[1:17:59] works and the father wanted to heal that
[1:18:02] one yeah and not anybody
[1:18:05] else see it's not us it's not us we're
[1:18:08] not the ones doing the
[1:18:10] works if we're doing the works we're
[1:18:12] using a different set of genes yeah
[1:18:16] right and I don't want to use those set
[1:18:18] of
[1:18:19] jeans I want it to be the genes of God
[1:18:22] working through me so there not the work
[1:18:24] works that I do it's the works that he
[1:18:27] does in me and through me that it's not
[1:18:30] me but it's Christ because I didn't know
[1:18:32] what to do and I didn't know how to do
[1:18:34] and I didn't know the right way to do
[1:18:36] it listen I I I I tell you friends
[1:18:39] that's the way it comes down to is where
[1:18:41] we get to where we don't trust ourselves
[1:18:43] we don't trust the genetics in our own
[1:18:45] flesh the only thing we can trust is
[1:18:47] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:18:49] that's in the world and he knows how to
[1:18:51] do it and he knows what needs done and
[1:18:53] he's going to be the one that has to do
[1:18:55] it
[1:18:57] Amen brother M says in the invisible
[1:19:00] Union and so and so were you sons of God
[1:19:03] and Daughters of God before there even
[1:19:05] was a Moon Star molecule you were Sons
[1:19:07] and Daughters of God for you are only
[1:19:09] the physical manifestation of the
[1:19:11] attributes that was in God at the
[1:19:13] beginning for there's only one form of
[1:19:15] eternal life and that was you before you
[1:19:17] don't know nothing about it neither did
[1:19:19] you did you know when you was in your
[1:19:21] Earthly father but you are manifested
[1:19:23] too in His image and the image of God
[1:19:25] you are made and you are manifested for
[1:19:27] the glory and fellowship of God and
[1:19:30] therefore as sure as your Gene had to be
[1:19:33] in your father before your natural birth
[1:19:35] your spiritual Gene had to be in God
[1:19:38] because you're an expression of the
[1:19:39] attributes of his thoughts before the
[1:19:42] foundation of the world right no way
[1:19:44] around it that's right and now we notice
[1:19:46] that life being in you God's life being
[1:19:49] in you from the foundation of the world
[1:19:51] so that expression is not me it's him in
[1:19:56] me and go to Ephesians chapter 2 with
[1:20:06] me Ephesians chapter
[1:20:09] 2 verse
[1:20:17] 8 for by grace are you saved through
[1:20:19] faith and that not of yourselves is the
[1:20:22] gift of God not of works that any man
[1:20:25] should boast for we are his workmanship
[1:20:27] created in Christ Jesus un good works
[1:20:29] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:20:31] should walk in them so God has already
[1:20:34] ordained The Works that you and I will
[1:20:36] do and it's already in the spiritual
[1:20:38] genetics of our soul and God knows how
[1:20:40] to activate it at the right time and and
[1:20:44] we don't need to worry about it it's
[1:20:46] already
[1:20:48] there he says in the book of Hebrews The
[1:20:51] Works were finished from before the
[1:20:52] foundation of the world
[1:20:55] so at no time is God being surprised
[1:20:57] that we get into a situation and all of
[1:20:59] a sudden it seems like we get into a
[1:21:01] pickle and we don't know our way out and
[1:21:02] all of a sudden God's surprised what he
[1:21:04] was going to do to solve the problem was
[1:21:06] finished before the foundation of the
[1:21:08] world yeah God already knows what he's
[1:21:10] going to do through you he already knows
[1:21:11] how he's going to do it he already knows
[1:21:13] what's in you to accomplish the deed
[1:21:15] amen we just need to get out of the way
[1:21:16] and let him do it please God help
[1:21:20] me in in the message Abraham and his
[1:21:23] seat after him from 19 61 he says now if
[1:21:26] he's infinite by his for knowledge he
[1:21:28] knew who would come to him and who would
[1:21:30] not come to him he knew who would be
[1:21:32] saved and who would not be saved that
[1:21:34] would certainly clear up Romans 88:9 for
[1:21:36] you if there's any question about God
[1:21:37] whether he calls his children by
[1:21:39] election or not for there's Paul
[1:21:41] speaking of Esau and Jacob before either
[1:21:44] child was born not even knowing what was
[1:21:46] right or wrong God said I love I love
[1:21:49] Jacob and hate Esau before either child
[1:21:51] had a way to even make a choice but God
[1:21:54] knew from the beginning what Esau was he
[1:21:56] know what Jacob was and God know in the
[1:21:58] beginning what you were and what you are
[1:22:00] not so therefore we cannot be nothing
[1:22:04] but if we cannot be like somebody else
[1:22:07] let's just be what God made us that's
[1:22:09] all we can do anything other from that
[1:22:12] would be hypocrisy we'd be a hypocrite
[1:22:14] so we do not want to be that it'd be
[1:22:17] better to be an Infidel than be a
[1:22:20] hypocrite let's be just what we are and
[1:22:23] all these things has to operate together
[1:22:25] to make the great wheels of God go on
[1:22:27] and not one thing is going wrong I'll
[1:22:30] guarantee you
[1:22:32] that everything everything has to work
[1:22:35] together every role that you play and
[1:22:37] every role that I play and every work
[1:22:39] that he's ordained us to and every
[1:22:40] position that we fill in the body of
[1:22:42] Christ it all has to work together and
[1:22:44] there can't be one cell less than
[1:22:47] another
[1:22:49] cell because it all has a portion of God
[1:22:53] right how could you say how could we
[1:22:57] think the Spoonful of God in you is
[1:23:00] inferior to the Spoonful of God in
[1:23:04] Me How can you think that the Spoonful
[1:23:07] Of God that God put in you is inferior
[1:23:09] to the spoonful he put in somebody
[1:23:11] else when every Spoonful contains the
[1:23:14] same chemicals and the same life and the
[1:23:16] same
[1:23:18] attributes but I don't have the same
[1:23:20] gifts listen all the gifts are in you
[1:23:25] amen they're there because it's part of
[1:23:27] God he can express it anytime he wants
[1:23:31] and if he doesn't want to express it why
[1:23:33] would we want to express what he doesn't
[1:23:35] want to
[1:23:37] express why would we desire a certain
[1:23:39] gift or a certain expression when that's
[1:23:41] not what he wants to express in our
[1:23:43] lives that shows that we only want to do
[1:23:46] something for self yes we want a certain
[1:23:50] gift or a certain expression and we
[1:23:51] become dissatisfied with the expression
[1:23:53] he gives us and we want a different
[1:23:55] expression because something about this
[1:23:57] expression we deem more valuable or more
[1:24:00] in the public eye or would get us more y
[1:24:06] praise all a sudden it shows the fallacy
[1:24:09] of the human
[1:24:10] mind and say you know what all I want to
[1:24:13] be is what he's called me to be I don't
[1:24:15] want to be anything more I don't want to
[1:24:16] I want to want to come up my own ideas I
[1:24:18] just want to be comfortable being a son
[1:24:20] or daughter of God I've told you this
[1:24:22] before you cannot create a better title
[1:24:24] than son or daughter of God there's not
[1:24:26] one thing that can Trump that title the
[1:24:28] greatest thing that you will ever be
[1:24:30] called in your life is a son or daughter
[1:24:31] of God Amen you can say well the
[1:24:33] greatest thing is to be a preacher the
[1:24:34] greatest thing to be a missionary the
[1:24:36] greatest thing is to be a prophet no the
[1:24:37] greatest thing to be is a son or
[1:24:39] daughter of God yeah right oh praise God
[1:24:43] that's that's the thing that gives me
[1:24:45] the most Joy is that I'm a Son of God
[1:24:48] that's the thing that gives me the most
[1:24:49] security is I'm a Son of God if he can
[1:24:51] strip me of all gifts tomorrow and I
[1:24:53] never preach again still a Son of God
[1:24:56] that's the greatest title amen that God
[1:24:58] could ever give me that's the greatest
[1:25:00] Revelation that he could ever put in my
[1:25:01] heart whether I ever operate a gift or
[1:25:03] never operate a gift or I ever do what
[1:25:05] anybody else does it doesn't matter
[1:25:07] because I'm still a Son of God and
[1:25:09] everything is in me that's in anybody
[1:25:14] else praise
[1:25:17] God brother man said in the in the
[1:25:20] message things that are to be he said
[1:25:22] May that little germ of life that that
[1:25:24] Gene of God that we just talked of the
[1:25:26] attribute that came down from God and
[1:25:28] has been manifested here to honor and
[1:25:30] glorify God Amen move the world from
[1:25:34] that he saying move the world away from
[1:25:36] that
[1:25:37] attribute don't cover it up with your
[1:25:40] flesh or worldly things but let that
[1:25:45] Express he says in perfect strength by
[1:25:47] Perfect witness how many listened to
[1:25:49] that this week after brother Stan
[1:25:50] recommended it it was a good
[1:25:53] recommendation went and listen to it as
[1:25:55] well and I enjoyed it he said this is
[1:25:58] what brother B says in that message I've
[1:26:00] often said the greatest enemy I got is
[1:26:02] William
[1:26:04] brandham he's the one that gets in God's
[1:26:06] way he's the one that gets lazy he's the
[1:26:08] one that gets to a place sometimes where
[1:26:10] he thinks he can do something about it
[1:26:12] and when he does that shoves God right
[1:26:15] out of the
[1:26:16] picture but when I can get rid of that
[1:26:19] guy when I can get to a place that he's
[1:26:21] out of the way then God can come over
[1:26:23] and do things William brandom knows
[1:26:24] nothing about that's when God can use
[1:26:27] you that's when he can use any of you he
[1:26:30] can use anybody when we get out of the
[1:26:32] way but as long as we got ourselves in
[1:26:34] the way then we
[1:26:37] canot praise
[1:26:40] God man that's you know the greatest
[1:26:44] enemy I got is not William
[1:26:46] Brandon the greatest enemy I got is Chad
[1:26:49] Lam this carnal mind in this flesh
[1:26:52] trying to do things trying to figure
[1:26:54] things out trying to solve my own
[1:26:56] problems and every time I do that I make
[1:26:58] a
[1:27:00] mess I say but God's Place something in
[1:27:03] me that can overcome every challenge
[1:27:05] that I face for greater is he that is in
[1:27:09] you than he that's in the
[1:27:11] world I think what we need to do is
[1:27:13] trust that life and trust that it's
[1:27:18] there amen and if we trust it I think
[1:27:20] it'll bring us more peace and if we can
[1:27:22] just relax the key to operating any gift
[1:27:24] is relaxed the whole Christian Life is
[1:27:26] based on
[1:27:27] rest that we know who we are we know God
[1:27:30] has it under control and everything I
[1:27:32] have need of is already in me brother B
[1:27:34] said every if you received the baptism
[1:27:35] of the Holy Ghost everything you have
[1:27:36] need of for life's journey is in you
[1:27:39] then and can express any time any
[1:27:41] obstacle you come to the Overcomers
[1:27:44] inside you amen every obstacle you come
[1:27:48] against the Overcomer is already in you
[1:27:50] amen and and God is able to overcome
[1:27:52] everything as he works through you and
[1:27:56] then when he does it when we have no
[1:27:57] idea what to do and we are are are are
[1:27:59] on the outside worried and nervous and
[1:28:01] don't know how to fix the problem and
[1:28:02] have no solution and God comes along
[1:28:04] supernaturally and does something then
[1:28:06] who gets all the credit you say I was
[1:28:08] lost I had no idea I was just as uh
[1:28:11] befuddled as anybody else was but God
[1:28:13] came on the
[1:28:14] scene amen and and we can't be afraid to
[1:28:17] move forward in this life because God's
[1:28:18] ordained us to the walk that we have in
[1:28:20] look at look at Jeremiah Jeremiah he
[1:28:23] told Jeremiah I knew you before I formed
[1:28:25] you before you came forth I Sanctified
[1:28:27] you and ordained you a prophet to the
[1:28:29] Nations and Jeremiah said well that's
[1:28:31] just too
[1:28:32] much I can't do it but he says don't be
[1:28:35] afraid of their faces and no don't think
[1:28:37] like that you go on and I'll put words
[1:28:39] in your mouth
[1:28:40] yeah whatever God's called you to do
[1:28:43] friends you can do it amen not because
[1:28:47] you the outside man can do it but
[1:28:48] because he's ordained it and if he's
[1:28:50] ordained it he'll Supply every need amen
[1:28:53] when you need a word of give you a word
[1:28:54] when you need healing you'll get healing
[1:28:56] when you need an answer he'll give you
[1:28:57] an answer amen you may not have it ahead
[1:29:00] of time amen Jeremiah may be going in to
[1:29:02] say something he may he may have to go
[1:29:04] down Amen to the elders and not know
[1:29:06] what he's saying till he gets there amen
[1:29:08] but when he needs to say it it'll be in
[1:29:10] his mouth yeah amen there's many times
[1:29:13] amen as we operate in what God's called
[1:29:17] us to do even operating and preaching
[1:29:19] there's many times I have absolutely no
[1:29:21] clue how to express what's on the inside
[1:29:22] of me no idea what I'm going to say or
[1:29:25] how I'm going to say it amen and there's
[1:29:27] been times I've been in the back ringing
[1:29:28] my hand saying God I do not want to go
[1:29:30] out there because in my mind nothing
[1:29:32] correlates nothing adds up there's no
[1:29:34] way I can express what I'm feeling and I
[1:29:37] don't know how to put it together and
[1:29:38] there's so many times I'll walk out here
[1:29:41] and all of a sudden under the pool of
[1:29:42] the people God takes over and it just
[1:29:44] click click click click click moves down
[1:29:46] the line and the most amazed person in
[1:29:48] the church is
[1:29:51] me that's why sometimes you have no no
[1:29:54] idea I'm having an absolute Jubilee
[1:29:56] sometimes and you don't know why the
[1:29:58] reason is I didn't know these things
[1:30:00] till now and I didn't know how these two
[1:30:02] pieces fit together until just
[1:30:04] now amen because sometimes you got to
[1:30:07] have the courage to move forward in what
[1:30:09] he's called you to do trusting that if
[1:30:11] he's in it it'll work that I don't have
[1:30:14] a preconceived idea I don't know yeah I
[1:30:17] study I study all the time I study to
[1:30:19] show myself approved a Workman that
[1:30:21] needeth not be ashamed I do what my I'm
[1:30:24] supposed to do I do what I believe God
[1:30:25] wants me to do but it doesn't matter you
[1:30:27] can study your brains out and you still
[1:30:28] have no idea sometimes what to
[1:30:31] do how to answer it what it means there
[1:30:34] have been things that I've I've put down
[1:30:36] in my notse a scripture or a quote and
[1:30:38] and there there happened several times
[1:30:41] I'll be in the back preparing say I
[1:30:42] don't know how that that doesn't fit
[1:30:43] into anything I'm going to say it's
[1:30:45] completely contrary I'm just going to
[1:30:47] get rid of it and I said I better not
[1:30:49] I'm going to delete it Go Go twice to
[1:30:51] delete it I move it around on the page
[1:30:53] it doesn't fit here doesn't fit there
[1:30:55] amen and I'll come to the pulpit and
[1:30:57] when I read that scripture bang the
[1:30:59] Revelation comes and I know exactly how
[1:31:01] it
[1:31:02] fits why it's not me it's not my brain
[1:31:07] it's not my mind amen it's a position
[1:31:09] that I hold in God Amen there's God on
[1:31:12] the inside who can bring what he needs
[1:31:14] at the right time and if God doesn't for
[1:31:17] a gift to preaching he'll do it for
[1:31:19] every one of
[1:31:20] us answers to questions witnessing uh uh
[1:31:24] uh Family Matters anything that you have
[1:31:26] need of God
[1:31:28] knows we can't be afraid to move forward
[1:31:30] and trust
[1:31:32] God you ever tried to meet somebody to
[1:31:34] witness to them because somebody wants
[1:31:35] to know more about what you believe and
[1:31:36] you're going to meet for coffee have you
[1:31:38] ever done that and you prepared
[1:31:40] everything you were going to say in your
[1:31:41] mind but Hadad you had days you
[1:31:42] meditating you had scriptures and you
[1:31:43] had all this in your
[1:31:45] mind and then you go and nothing you
[1:31:48] prepared for is the question they ask
[1:31:49] and they ask something that you have no
[1:31:51] idea how to answer
[1:31:54] has that ever happened to you all your
[1:31:57] preparations are laid
[1:32:00] waste I think it'd be so much better for
[1:32:02] us to show up and say I have no idea
[1:32:04] what to say hey what's on your mind
[1:32:06] we'll see what God will
[1:32:08] do because I didn't come here to give
[1:32:11] you my mind or my understanding I came
[1:32:13] here as an attribute of God a vessel for
[1:32:16] God to speak through and if he wants to
[1:32:17] speak to you will if he doesn't I can't
[1:32:19] control it anyways I'm not here to
[1:32:21] convince I'm not here to persuade I'm
[1:32:24] not here to use intellect to make you a
[1:32:25] believer I'm only here as a vessel that
[1:32:27] God can use to speak the word to you and
[1:32:29] if he does great and if he doesn't great
[1:32:32] yeah it's not my
[1:32:34] job listen it's not for us to use our
[1:32:37] brains and use our willpower and use all
[1:32:39] these things to get so much done for the
[1:32:41] kingdom he just wants vessels if you
[1:32:43] listen to if you listen to the message
[1:32:45] this week uh uh perfect strength and
[1:32:47] perfect weakness or by Perfect weakness
[1:32:50] you realize brother B said what he wants
[1:32:52] is emptied out vessels yeah he went to
[1:32:55] the he went to the story that Jesus told
[1:32:57] of the of the of the woman uh who whose
[1:33:01] husband was dead and she was in debt and
[1:33:04] that that her sons were going to be sold
[1:33:06] and he says what do you have in your
[1:33:07] house just a little oil and he says go
[1:33:09] borrow vessels and get empty vessels
[1:33:11] don't get full vessels or parts get
[1:33:13] empty vessels and he'll pour out and
[1:33:15] fill up the vessel he said what God
[1:33:17] needs now is not full vessels or half
[1:33:20] full he doesn't need you with all your
[1:33:22] talents and abilities what he needs is
[1:33:23] an empty vessel that he can pour himself
[1:33:27] in God help me to be an empty
[1:33:31] vessel he says in Christ is identified
[1:33:35] the same in all generations says now
[1:33:36] what is this it's a gift a gift isn't
[1:33:40] something that like a stick or a sword
[1:33:42] you cut with it cut with and things a
[1:33:45] gift is a way to get yourself out of the
[1:33:48] way you just have to get I have to get
[1:33:51] myself out of the way then the Holy
[1:33:52] Spirit takes over
[1:33:54] it isn't what you take and do something
[1:33:56] with it's a gift to get yourself out of
[1:33:59] the way then God uses
[1:34:03] you God help me to learn how to get
[1:34:07] myself out of the
[1:34:10] way and the message it is the rising of
[1:34:13] the sun Prophet says no you don't say
[1:34:17] well I hope I make it you've already
[1:34:19] made it not I will make it I've already
[1:34:22] made it I never made it he made it it
[1:34:23] for me not me him well brother bam I
[1:34:27] don't care what they say there he made
[1:34:29] it for me that's all I want all I'm
[1:34:32] caring about I just I just want to see
[1:34:35] him
[1:34:36] manifested how can you do it call him
[1:34:39] down no he's in you he's in you well
[1:34:44] then Lord if I can get myself out of the
[1:34:46] way you can manifest how can you do it
[1:34:50] because you're ordained to do so
[1:34:54] do you remember uh this past Wednesday
[1:34:57] when Stan was preaching and he was
[1:34:58] talking about praying for sister so and
[1:35:00] so and calling to a God who far away to
[1:35:02] come and do something
[1:35:04] else that you know that imagery so
[1:35:07] resonates because so many times we call
[1:35:10] on God and it feels like God's so far
[1:35:12] away especially when we get into trouble
[1:35:14] we get into difficult circumstances and
[1:35:16] places that we don't know how to solve
[1:35:18] our problems or answer the questions or
[1:35:20] it looks like we're in some sort of
[1:35:22] peril and tragedy's going to strike if
[1:35:24] God doesn't do something and we begin to
[1:35:26] call out to a god that's a million miles
[1:35:28] away because in our human emotions
[1:35:31] that's where he feels to us to be he
[1:35:34] feels to be a million miles away it
[1:35:37] feels like we're going to have to yell
[1:35:38] louder to get his attention because
[1:35:40] obviously he's not in this scene because
[1:35:42] this scene is
[1:35:43] horrific but the truth is he's still in
[1:35:47] you he's still in you he's not a million
[1:35:50] miles away he's not absent he's not he's
[1:35:54] in
[1:35:55] you he's he's he's right there the
[1:35:58] solution to the problem is right there
[1:36:01] the answer to the need is right there
[1:36:03] the genes of God the power of God the
[1:36:05] solution is right there what does he
[1:36:07] need he needs us to get out of the way
[1:36:09] and say God I'm trusting completely in
[1:36:11] you come and do what only you can
[1:36:14] do what are we going to do we want to
[1:36:16] see God manifested what are we going to
[1:36:18] do Cal him down no he's in
[1:36:21] you I want to walk to life with
[1:36:24] confidence that greater is he that's in
[1:36:25] me than he that's in the
[1:36:27] world I I want to live the way he's
[1:36:31] called us to live and I believe that's
[1:36:32] what he's calling for a bride who's
[1:36:35] intimately aware of who's inside of
[1:36:38] her and who the real Overcomer is and
[1:36:42] who the real bride is it's not this
[1:36:45] outside Guy this is the one that gets me
[1:36:47] in
[1:36:48] trouble it's the attribute of God that's
[1:36:51] down on the inside that he designated to
[1:36:52] be expressed in this way and in this
[1:36:56] hour and how am I going what what
[1:36:59] portion do I want to express well I can
[1:37:00] come up with a whole list of things that
[1:37:02] I think I should be expressing but God's
[1:37:04] actually knows what I'm supposed to
[1:37:05] express
[1:37:08] Amen in the message it is the rising of
[1:37:10] the
[1:37:11] sun I want to end with this
[1:37:15] quote in him we become part of him the
[1:37:18] Easter the revealed Secret Of God like
[1:37:20] it was then of life after death we are
[1:37:23] are now alive who were once dead in sin
[1:37:26] and trespasses the true Easter seal has
[1:37:29] broke death from around me and I'm alive
[1:37:33] the Easter seal at the beginning broke
[1:37:35] the Seal of the Roman seal the Easter
[1:37:37] seal that he was sealed
[1:37:39] up when they when they crucified Jesus
[1:37:42] Christ they put him behind the stone
[1:37:45] they closed him in the Tomb and they put
[1:37:46] a seal on it brother R it was a Roman
[1:37:49] seal and he ends up calling it the
[1:37:50] Easter seal it broke Amen on Easter
[1:37:52] morning and Christ was was resurrected
[1:37:54] and he was he was found to be
[1:37:56] alive amen but he's showing us that we
[1:37:59] have an Easter
[1:38:00] seal that we died but Christ resurrected
[1:38:03] inside of us and he says the Easter seal
[1:38:07] that he was sealed up and man when they
[1:38:09] died was gone but he broke the seal and
[1:38:11] revealed the secret and now God by his
[1:38:15] holy spirit has broke the seal from
[1:38:17] around our lives
[1:38:21] amen many of you know the rest of theot
[1:38:23] but I'm pausing for a reason I want to
[1:38:25] read this beginning again and now God by
[1:38:28] his holy spirit has broke the seal from
[1:38:29] around our lives so when he breaks the
[1:38:32] seal from around us what is
[1:38:34] revealed when he breaks the seal around
[1:38:36] sealing up my life what's the seal the
[1:38:39] seal is the veil that keeps me from
[1:38:40] understanding the
[1:38:41] reality it's this thing that hides God
[1:38:44] from me and hides the true understanding
[1:38:46] and true Revelation that's the seal but
[1:38:48] now the seal is broke from around our
[1:38:50] lives and what do we see when the seal
[1:38:52] is broke from around our lives
[1:38:55] and Christ is revealed as he lives in
[1:38:59] us for now we are quickened with
[1:39:03] him what did this breaking of the seals
[1:39:06] do it revealed where Christ wanted to be
[1:39:09] revealed he wanted to be revealed in
[1:39:10] Bride form and now the life that we live
[1:39:14] I'm dead I want to be dead I want to be
[1:39:15] more dead than I am I want to get this
[1:39:18] guy this enemy out of the way and I want
[1:39:19] to die to this thinking I want to be
[1:39:21] more dead than I've ever done before
[1:39:23] amen because why because I realize amen
[1:39:26] the seal that was broke is to reveal
[1:39:28] Christ the resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:39:31] where is he in
[1:39:33] me inside of me not another place not
[1:39:36] far away he's right here to do what to
[1:39:41] express
[1:39:42] himself if I can just get out of the way
[1:39:45] and die to my thinking I can let him
[1:39:48] Express
[1:39:49] himself and then the question is what
[1:39:52] are the limitations then
[1:39:55] what are the
[1:39:56] limitations I can't do that I can't do
[1:39:59] this well the truth is you can't you
[1:40:00] can't do anything I can't overcome I
[1:40:03] can't you can't do anything but the life
[1:40:05] that I now live I live by the faith of
[1:40:08] the Son of God and if I have the Son of
[1:40:11] God the faith of the Son of God then
[1:40:13] I've got enough faith for any need not
[1:40:17] my faith his faith a gift of faith that
[1:40:19] he's given to me to operate any part of
[1:40:21] the word I can believe it and if he can
[1:40:24] move my soul to believe it then I can
[1:40:26] have it even as much as creating a whole
[1:40:28] another world Amen surely enough to
[1:40:31] overcome the obstacles that we face not
[1:40:34] by intellect but by genuine faith and
[1:40:37] now God by his grace has decided to
[1:40:40] reveal his
[1:40:42] son in US amen I'm so thankful to be
[1:40:46] part of
[1:40:47] that how can we replicate we can't what
[1:40:50] can we do
[1:40:52] nothing but just get out of the way and
[1:40:55] move the world away and let Christ
[1:40:58] Express amen
[1:41:00] amen in what form in your form yeah with
[1:41:05] what gift whatever he wants in what
[1:41:07] position wherever he's placed you right
[1:41:10] don't overthink it friends don't over
[1:41:12] complicate it just Express where you
[1:41:15] are every seed every seed every flower
[1:41:18] should bloom in the ground that's
[1:41:19] planted and wherever you are Express
[1:41:21] Christ he's going to express whereever
[1:41:23] don't wait well when I move or when I
[1:41:25] this or someday I'll be and then no no
[1:41:28] no that's not how it works he's in you
[1:41:30] now and he wants to express himself
[1:41:33] where you are and where you are and
[1:41:36] where he's placed you will cause a
[1:41:38] certain portion of his life to be
[1:41:40] manifest and then the conditions that
[1:41:42] come around you that change over time
[1:41:45] and in different pressures and different
[1:41:46] things it will unlock another portion of
[1:41:48] Christ to be
[1:41:50] expressed amen how many of you have
[1:41:52] testimonies of super Supernatural things
[1:41:53] that happen in your life am God's given
[1:41:56] you Supernatural dreams word of
[1:41:58] knowledge somebody will say something to
[1:42:00] you to answer something Supernatural
[1:42:02] happened and you know it was God come on
[1:42:03] the
[1:42:06] scene I'd like to just prope to you that
[1:42:09] most every time and I don't know each
[1:42:11] one of you and you may be able to
[1:42:12] correct me on this but most every time
[1:42:14] those most Supernatural happenings came
[1:42:16] at some of the most desperate times in
[1:42:17] your
[1:42:18] life when you needed God and nothing but
[1:42:21] God would work and when your own mind
[1:42:23] couldn't come up with a solution and you
[1:42:25] were Beyond yourself to solve any
[1:42:27] problems and what did you find when you
[1:42:28] come to the end of yourself he was more
[1:42:30] than enough and he has the
[1:42:33] answer oh let me come to the end of
[1:42:36] myself when I wake up in the morning
[1:42:38] before I get my feet on the floor let me
[1:42:40] come to the end of myself let me come to
[1:42:42] that same place where I don't have the
[1:42:43] answer I don't have the solution I don't
[1:42:45] know what to do and I have no
[1:42:47] power but then give me the courage to
[1:42:49] put my feet on the ground and move
[1:42:50] forward because he ordained me to live
[1:42:53] in this life and he ordained me to
[1:42:55] manifest him in this life and he is
[1:42:57] going to express himself in me and all I
[1:43:00] need to do is move forward with
[1:43:01] confidence that when it's time he'll
[1:43:03] touch my mouth and put words in my mouth
[1:43:06] that he'll activate something inside of
[1:43:08] me by faith and and whatever is needed
[1:43:11] amen will happen whether it's a spoken
[1:43:13] word whether it's a prayer whether it's
[1:43:16] a word of knowledge a Word of Wisdom
[1:43:17] laying hands on somebody whatever it is
[1:43:20] the potential is already in me amen I
[1:43:23] need to move forward confident that it's
[1:43:25] already in Me Not Afraid but I need to
[1:43:28] know that it's in me it's not this
[1:43:30] outside
[1:43:32] man man God bless you let's just stand
[1:43:34] I'm just going to stop there for
[1:43:39] now I want you to leave with this
[1:43:43] understanding from the the thing of
[1:43:46] genetics that we
[1:43:48] understand is every cell in your body
[1:43:52] contains everything that is you amen
[1:43:55] everything that is you is in every
[1:43:58] cell and everything that is in God is in
[1:44:01] every one of his children
[1:44:03] amen the potential where is the
[1:44:07] potential it's in my soul where is God
[1:44:11] dwelling in me where do I have to go in
[1:44:14] a time of trouble what place what
[1:44:17] location he's in me how loud do I have
[1:44:21] to scream to get his attention how how
[1:44:23] long do I have to pray before he finally
[1:44:25] shows up to
[1:44:26] answer see it's not like that
[1:44:29] friends there's got to be a confidence
[1:44:31] that says he called me he ordained me
[1:44:34] he's with me and everything I have need
[1:44:36] of is in me and all I got to do is trust
[1:44:39] in
[1:44:40] him
[1:44:41] and I just want to say all the
[1:44:44] potential is in every one of you the
[1:44:49] potential for every
[1:44:51] manifestation it's in you you you're not
[1:44:54] going to work it by your own will you're
[1:44:56] not going to say well if it's in me then
[1:44:58] I call for this and I call for that you
[1:45:01] can go ahead and try that but that's not
[1:45:02] going to
[1:45:03] work but just the confidence to know
[1:45:06] that he's never going to put me in a jam
[1:45:09] that there's not something in me that'll
[1:45:11] overcome he's never going to send me in
[1:45:13] a trial that there's not something in me
[1:45:15] that will overcome because he's ordained
[1:45:18] it before the foundation of the world
[1:45:21] it's him not me
[1:45:23] there's nothing that he's asked me to do
[1:45:26] that I have to do all I have to do is
[1:45:28] trust him and move forward he'll do it
[1:45:31] am I just got to have confidence in him
[1:45:34] and musicians if you'll come brother Ben

[1:45:43] you we thank you God for the
[1:45:46] understanding that you've unlock to us
[1:45:47] in this
[1:45:49] generation God we know Lord that this is
[1:45:52] the hour that you want to have a full
[1:45:56] expression of yourself in Bride
[1:45:58] form but God we know that we're not
[1:46:02] capable Lord we're not able we in our
[1:46:06] Humanity Lord we don't have within our
[1:46:08] flesh and our human Spirit what it takes
[1:46:10] but God we know that you have already
[1:46:14] supplied God you've placed a portion of
[1:46:17] yourself a seed Gene within our soul
[1:46:19] before the foundation of the world and
[1:46:21] in it Lord is the the expression that
[1:46:23] you
[1:46:24] desire God I pray that you'd help us
[1:46:27] Lord to get away from our own thinking
[1:46:30] to surrender our own ideas and our own
[1:46:32] Ambitions Lord and our own thoughts even
[1:46:34] about
[1:46:36] ourselves may we just rest in the fact
[1:46:38] that you know all
[1:46:41] things God I want to I want to move the
[1:46:44] world away from that life you placed
[1:46:47] inside of me I want to get my own
[1:46:49] thinking surrendered to
[1:46:51] you God as your Prophet called for empty
[1:46:55] vessels Lord I Want To Be An Empty
[1:46:58] vessel and I want to pour out Lord I
[1:47:01] want to pour out this
[1:47:02] morning and I realize that I'm too
[1:47:05] self-sufficient
[1:47:07] Lord Lord too often I'm trying to solve
[1:47:10] all my own
[1:47:12] problems God that's just part of the
[1:47:14] human Frailty I find myself
[1:47:17] in God I want to pour that out at your
[1:47:19] feet and I want to ask that you would
[1:47:21] take this vessel
[1:47:23] and do things with it that we've never
[1:47:25] even thought
[1:47:26] of that you would bring things out of us
[1:47:29] that we've never dreamed of that we've
[1:47:31] never imagined that we never knew were
[1:47:34] possible that we could lay down our life
[1:47:37] so that you could live your life through
[1:47:39] us I pray you would do Lord what your
[1:47:41] Prophet said you would do with a
[1:47:44] surrendered vessel and that your
[1:47:46] strength would may be made perfect in
[1:47:48] our
[1:47:49] weakness for God what you TR taught us
[1:47:51] in this generation
[1:47:54] is that you're here that you're present
[1:47:58] that you've poured out your fullness
[1:48:00] Lord into your body on this Earth and to
[1:48:02] your bride and that you have the power
[1:48:05] to express it through these vessels of
[1:48:07] clay and we're trusting in that Lord
[1:48:09] that no matter what we Face In the
[1:48:11] Future No Matter What comes down the Pik
[1:48:13] no matter what happens
[1:48:15] next that greater is you that is in us
[1:48:18] than anything that's in the
[1:48:20] world we have confidence in you may you
[1:48:22] train us and teach us how to live the
[1:48:25] life you've called us to live I pray
[1:48:27] that you bless your people that you
[1:48:29] would take us from here today and may we
[1:48:31] go Lord with confidence and with rest
[1:48:34] and with
[1:48:35] trust that you've already provided
[1:48:38] everything we have need of it's already
[1:48:41] a provision in your mind you already
[1:48:43] have finished the works from before the
[1:48:44] foundation of the world you're only
[1:48:47] asking us to trust you to take your hand
[1:48:49] to walk and to let you lead and to let
[1:48:51] you move and let you be all in all Lord
[1:48:56] I love you I ask that you take this
[1:48:57] vessel of mine take these vessels here
[1:49:01] may you accomplish your purpose in our
[1:49:02] life I pray in Jesus Christ's name
[1:49:07] amen God bless you brother
[1:49:10] Ben
[1:49:12] only to be
[1:49:15] what he wants me to
[1:49:20] be every morning
[1:49:23] moment of
[1:49:26] every
[1:49:28] [Music]
[1:49:30] day oh
[1:49:34] yielded
[1:49:36] completely to
[1:49:39] Jesus
[1:49:42] alone every step of this
[1:49:48] P way
[1:49:53] more and
[1:49:55] just to be
[1:49:58] claim in the
[1:50:02] part
[1:50:04] hand
[1:50:06] ready to do what his
[1:50:12] word
[1:50:15] come
[1:50:18] only to be
[1:50:21] one he want
[1:50:23] me to
[1:50:26] be every
[1:50:29] moment
[1:50:31] [Music]
[1:50:32] of
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:36] day
[1:50:37] amen you know we have no idea what the
[1:50:41] future holds but we know some things
[1:50:42] that the prophet
[1:50:44] said and the question is when we move
[1:50:47] into whatever a squeeze is and whatever
[1:50:49] it looks like and whatever a tightening
[1:50:51] up is and whatever ever uh a politically
[1:50:54] backed religious organized persecution I
[1:50:57] have no idea I can speculate well you
[1:50:59] can speculate but it'll probably happen
[1:51:01] in ways that we never
[1:51:03] dreamed but how are we going to get
[1:51:05] through that what should we be doing now
[1:51:07] what what does your mind conjure up you
[1:51:09] know dig bunkers and hide food
[1:51:13] and that's the human way of thinking
[1:51:16] guard my resources in case they lock my
[1:51:19] bank account and but listen that's not
[1:51:21] what God wants us to do
[1:51:23] God wants us to have confidence no
[1:51:25] matter what we face it's come because
[1:51:27] he's got an expression he wants to
[1:51:30] express there was a a message I didn't
[1:51:33] look up the quote I didn't think to till
[1:51:34] just now it come to my mind but a
[1:51:36] message brother Benjamin seol preached
[1:51:38] some time ago about uh Joseph when
[1:51:40] Joseph was going through his trials he
[1:51:42] had gotten a vision you know of he was
[1:51:45] going to be exalted to a position and
[1:51:46] his brothers going to Bow then he got
[1:51:48] sold into slavery and then he got sent
[1:51:50] down to prison and all that happened to
[1:51:52] him and I didn't find the quote but I'm
[1:51:55] just going by memory where brother
[1:51:57] Benjamin told us that when something
[1:51:59] happened that was bad or or
[1:52:02] challenging Joseph would say God what
[1:52:05] part of the vision are you wanting to
[1:52:07] express now you remember that I may have
[1:52:11] the words a little wrong but what part
[1:52:12] of the vision are you wanting to express
[1:52:15] now I said oh what a perspective amen
[1:52:19] what a perspective when we hit life's
[1:52:21] trials and difficulties if we could just
[1:52:24] say God what part of your nature are you
[1:52:26] trying to express now not what I think
[1:52:29] should be expressed I sometimes I think
[1:52:32] the lion should come on the scene when
[1:52:33] God wants the
[1:52:35] lamb I think the lion should be there
[1:52:37] when God wants a sacrificial Ox yeah
[1:52:40] amen I think it should be the eagle who
[1:52:41] screams out amen from from Revelation
[1:52:44] and calls but maybe God wants an ox
[1:52:47] expression maybe a lion maybe the man
[1:52:50] maybe instead of me determining what
[1:52:53] should be respons maybe we should just
[1:52:55] say God what part of your life do you
[1:52:58] want to express
[1:52:59] today why is all this happening he said
[1:53:01] say why is all this happening to me God
[1:53:04] don't you know what's happening to me
[1:53:06] well of course he knows what's happening
[1:53:07] to
[1:53:08] you of course he knows where you're at
[1:53:10] and of course he knows the circumstances
[1:53:12] and situations instead of looking at it
[1:53:14] why God why all of this what's going
[1:53:16] wrong why not just say God what is it
[1:53:18] you're trying to accomplish today here I
[1:53:20] am an empty vessel do through me what
[1:53:22] you want to do with this
[1:53:25] circumstance because God brought a
[1:53:27] condition so that the genes on the
[1:53:30] inside would have an
[1:53:31] expression part of his nature part of
[1:53:34] his life it may be absolutely amazing
[1:53:38] and Supernatural and blow you away it
[1:53:41] may be as simple as submitting yourself
[1:53:43] and allowing your flesh to be
[1:53:46] destroyed both of those are expressions
[1:53:48] of the Life of
[1:53:50] Christ to speak a word to speak to the
[1:53:53] storm or to surrender to the
[1:53:56] beating it's not us to decide which
[1:53:58] portion it's him if we could just say
[1:54:01] like Joseph said what part of the vision
[1:54:04] what part of the word are you trying to
[1:54:06] express to me now God help me to stay
[1:54:07] tuned in and not interject my own
[1:54:09] thinking but just let you express
[1:54:12] through me and Friends there's a reality
[1:54:15] to this that God will do in you what he
[1:54:17] wants to do if we'll just get our own
[1:54:19] thinking out of the
[1:54:20] way what gives us problems is our
[1:54:24] mind but there's already a solution on
[1:54:26] the inside the genes are already there
[1:54:28] to overcome oh let the circumstance
[1:54:31] bring expression because that's the
[1:54:33] purpose
[1:54:34] anyways say oh God let me have Joseph's
[1:54:38] attitude not I was wrong my vision was
[1:54:41] wrong I thought I was bride I thought I
[1:54:43] was a Son of God I must have been wrong
[1:54:44] no what God what is that you're trying
[1:54:46] to express now have your expression
[1:54:49] here amen let's sing this song again
[1:54:52] again God bless you
[1:54:55] only to be
[1:54:58] one he wants
[1:55:01] me to
