========================================

so when you're finding your way back to little word that God has spoken you can anchor your soul there because that's a hiding place I'm just thinking about a little Miriam here's Moses born in their family and his mom uh hit him for three months in the best place ever Dad Mom brother and sister but after three months they couldn't hide him any longer so what did they have to do put him on the basket there close to the body of water now just with thinking I'm just imagining the drama of uh Pharaoh's daughter coming there because she had no child coming there with all the pump with all the bodyguards and people around her they might have been hundreds don't know because she was the daughter of a pharaoh she had had she must have a lot of people following her but among all those people there here's a seven or eight years old that is taking up to speak and what she's speaking out is she didn't even ask the question she just speaking in Pharaoh's daughter right away takes that little word of that little girl there it becomes thus say the Lord for her said can I get to your mother a Hebrew mother who can come and nurse that baby there was no question who are you why are you telling me that no question he was just little word that God put into that little girl there she never hesitated she did exactly with those hundreds of bodyguards around her she obeyed the word of that little girl there and they went to get to fetch a mother's mom Moses's mother 's mother came home to the the house of pharaoh and now I can imagine Pharaoh himself maybe one morning he is putting a decree there because he already had his degree there to kill all the children of Israel and little Moses was growing up there and Grandpa was picking up Moses little baby how you doing Moses keep quiet and he would call those his people did you make sure that you killed all the Hebrew children because he must be among those children you need to eliminate him I don't want to did you do it oh Moses sorry sorry could you keep quiet the very one he's looking for head in the open hid in the word because when Mother's mother was hiding him there was no word he was she was hiding him they were hiding him with the love of a mother of a father of a siblings but there was no word so he was still in the open but when God put little words into that little girl she spoke that was the hiding place for Moses she was in the pharaoh Pharaoh's mentioned being protected by the word of his sister Moses keep quiet God's coming in how many did you kill today at Moses sorry what do you want a candy that's how God the great God works sometimes in a ridiculous way sorry to say those words but it seems like it and that's the way of Faith he's hiding place is not in the greatness of him one word you can be hid there
