[18:00] amen
[18:02] God bless you we're going to have you
[18:03] have your seats for just a moment thank
[18:06] you musicians I want to just share with
[18:09] you a quick testimony
[18:12] first I want to say brother Samuel if I
[18:15] walk left this Tuesday and he left with
[18:18] his back in his hand amen but his back
[18:21] didn't show up until two o'clock in the
[18:23] morning yesterday so it barely made it
[18:25] in time and it was quite an ordeal he
[18:27] had quite a time getting here but I
[18:29] thoroughly enjoyed the service on Sunday
[18:31] I was really blessed our brother really
[18:33] suffered Amen to bring that to us but
[18:36] the Lord was gracious and good and he
[18:38] fed us and so about two o'clock in the
[18:40] morning he got his luggage and he flew
[18:42] out in the middle of the day and he
[18:44] arrived safely in Phoenix he's going to
[18:46] be preaching tonight in Phoenix and then
[18:48] he's going up to flying into Seattle
[18:50] he's going to be preaching for brother
[18:53] um brother John there so for the Easter
[18:55] meetings so keep him in prayer until he
[18:58] gets back home I also want to share with
[19:00] you a testimony from yesterday I got a
[19:02] call
[19:03] Sunday evening from Levi Yoder and Levi
[19:07] told me that asked if we would if I'd be
[19:10] interested in going with him down to the
[19:13] group in Junction City we've mentioned
[19:15] this group before the the there are
[19:18] ex-amish group that have left the Amish
[19:21] Church they've been gathering together
[19:22] for a little while
[19:24] and I asked Levi more details on the
[19:27] group and he told me that the man who's
[19:30] leading the group right now he showed up
[19:33] in brother Levi's driveway one day
[19:35] and he would been up in the Holmes
[19:38] County area visiting family and they had
[19:40] told him about an ex-amished man who had
[19:42] this this doctrine of this teaching
[19:44] about William Branham and and that he's
[19:46] a spiritual brother and all of that so
[19:48] he wanted to come over and and talk to
[19:50] Levi so he showed up in Levi's driveway
[19:53] and Levi walked up to the man and gave
[19:55] him a hug and they started talking and
[19:57] from that point on leave I started
[19:58] visiting them started sharing the
[20:00] message with them and that's only been
[20:01] about six months ago amen and so they
[20:05] they've got quite a uh a story
[20:08] they got in contact
[20:11] well with Levi Levi's been sharing uh
[20:14] taking people to visit them for just a
[20:16] little bit and they got in contact with
[20:18] Jesse Smith from Akron the pastor in
[20:21] Akron uh just about four weeks ago and
[20:23] brother Jesse went and preached to them
[20:25] about water baptism in the name of the
[20:26] Lord Jesus Christ and they really
[20:28] enjoyed that and then the week after I
[20:31] believe it was brother Burley was in
[20:33] town if you remember that and he was
[20:34] preaching for a group of Believers down
[20:36] in Columbus and a group of them came
[20:38] over to the meeting and thoroughly
[20:39] enjoyed the service and brother Burley
[20:41] told me he said brother Chad that group
[20:43] is hungry for the word
[20:45] and so then uh brother Jesse Smith went
[20:48] back this past Sunday and he preached to
[20:50] them again and afterwards they opened
[20:52] the floor for questions and answers
[20:53] about baptism and at the end of that
[20:56] they decided they all wanted to be
[20:58] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[21:00] Christ and set it up for last night for
[21:02] Tuesday evening so they had no baptismal
[21:06] tank they had nothing so Levi has the
[21:09] horse trough that he was baptized in
[21:11] and that we baptized hardly in a little
[21:14] more than a week ago so he asked if we
[21:17] would come so I asked Brother Kyle to go
[21:18] with me so we went over to Levi's house
[21:21] two hours and 20 30 minutes
[21:24] picked up Levi and his family and the
[21:27] horse trough baptismal tank
[21:29] and drove two hours south to Junction
[21:31] City
[21:32] and then brother Jesse Smith came over
[21:34] and conducted the baptism and by the
[21:36] grace of God we witnessed the baptism of
[21:39] 17 Souls
[21:41] amen
[21:48] so it was it was amazing to see it was
[21:51] really quite a blessing we'd gotten
[21:53] there early and we were visiting with
[21:55] several of the folks there and Levi had
[21:57] got a call the day before I believe yeah
[22:01] on Monday he got a call Monday
[22:03] one of the sisters in this group she had
[22:05] a brother her flesh brother lived in
[22:09] Tennessee and she started testifying to
[22:10] him about water baptism he wanted to
[22:12] know more she gave him Levi's number
[22:15] Levi talked with him for quite a while
[22:17] on Monday and at the end of that
[22:19] conversation that man decided he was
[22:21] going to get baptized and on Tuesday he
[22:23] drove nine hours
[22:25] from Tennessee to come and be baptized
[22:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so
[22:30] we got to meet him his name is brother
[22:32] Samuel we got to meet him and talk with
[22:33] him for a while amen and and then
[22:36] afterwards we had quite a lengthy
[22:38] fellowship and it was amazing because me
[22:41] and Kyle were split up we were on
[22:42] opposite ends of the yard outside and
[22:44] Levi was somewhere else and they were so
[22:46] hungry everywhere you looked there was
[22:48] groups of these new Believers pulling
[22:50] all that they could out of us amen and I
[22:53] had the best time I enjoyed it so much
[22:55] and I just pray you keep praying for
[22:57] them amen they they they're just
[22:59] beginning but I was speaking to the man
[23:01] who's head of the group and we were
[23:03] sitting there fellowshipping and we were
[23:05] talking he asked me my testimony and I
[23:07] shared with him briefly the testimony
[23:08] and we were talking about the church
[23:10] ages book and and he testified that that
[23:13] was his favorite book amen and he's
[23:15] reading that book and and later he told
[23:18] me he goes I don't know how anybody can
[23:20] argue with anything in that book it's
[23:22] all the word and it's all true
[23:24] and after I heard that I thought he's
[23:26] fine I mean this brother's going to be
[23:28] fine there's no problem here so it was
[23:30] really really exciting and we were able
[23:33] to carry down some more books and and
[23:35] material for them and I just want to let
[23:38] you know that we've we've been able to
[23:40] put in the hands of brother Levi who's
[23:42] in turn put in the hands of many many
[23:43] different people Church age books seven
[23:46] sealed book The volume one of the
[23:49] Supernatural series the life story
[23:51] brother Branham resume of the Aegis
[23:54] track our books uh baptismal tracks and
[23:58] some tablets the tablets that have all
[24:00] the message on it and everything on it
[24:01] and all the material that brother Franco
[24:03] could find in German because many of
[24:05] them are German speaking also a German
[24:06] Bible and German messages and we've been
[24:09] able to hand out a lot of those tablets
[24:11] as well and all of that comes from the
[24:13] general fund from the contributions of
[24:15] the Saints here so I'm going to say God
[24:17] bless you and thank you it was exciting
[24:19] to see them taking Church age books and
[24:21] seal books and baptismal tracks and and
[24:24] that take home we met we met one man
[24:27] from
[24:29] Minnesota from northern Minnesota he was
[24:32] just there visiting some Believers some
[24:35] Believers in Indiana who had come over
[24:36] to witness the baptism and he took a
[24:39] tablet he took at least one Church ages
[24:42] book a seals book and something else and
[24:44] he was going to take it all back home
[24:45] and share it with his whole family he
[24:47] was so excited about what he heard
[24:49] I say praise God Amen God's doing
[24:52] something and I'm just excited to see
[24:54] what God is doing amen so keep them in
[24:56] prayer they've asked if both Kyle or I
[24:59] at different times would be willing to
[25:01] go down and Minister for them and we
[25:02] both agreed we would love to go help
[25:04] them in any way we could so just keep
[25:06] them in your prayers and just pray that
[25:09] God will continue to move them down the
[25:12] path amen they've got an excellent start
[25:14] amen and we thank God for that
[25:17] so amen let's just go ahead and stand
[25:18] and we're going to turn to the scripture
[25:20] and turn to the word we want to say God
[25:22] bless you brother Paul and sister Nora
[25:23] Jean it's good to have you here all the
[25:25] way from New Brunswick so I hear you're
[25:27] going to get to visit with us for
[25:28] several weeks so praise God that's good
[25:30] also brother Aaron Lau has his brother
[25:33] and sister-in-law here God bless you
[25:34] they're visiting from Arizona and so we
[25:37] look forward to shaking your hand and
[25:38] seeing you as well
[25:40] amen let's turn to the Book of Amos and
[25:42] we'll begin in Amos chapter 8.
[25:46] God bless you brother Emmanuel it's good
[25:48] to have you back I forgot to let the
[25:50] church know my brother Emmanuel was gone
[25:52] this past Sunday preaching for brother
[25:55] Nathaniel syoss up there and so God
[25:58] bless you it's good to have you back in
[25:59] the service brother
[26:01] amen Amos chapter 8 verse 11.
[26:09] Amos 8 11. behold the days come saith
[26:13] the Lord God that I will send a famine
[26:15] in the land not a famine of bread nor a
[26:18] thirst for water but of hearing the
[26:21] words of the Lord
[26:22] amen God bless us as we look into his
[26:24] word you can have your seeds
[26:28] amen I would like to take just for a
[26:30] subject tonight
[26:31] spiritual food during during the time of
[26:34] famine
[26:35] spiritual food during the time of famine
[26:38] in Amos here he's promised a famine but
[26:41] not a famine a food or drink
[26:43] but a famine of hearing the word of God
[26:46] and I would say the world is in this
[26:48] famine
[26:49] this is the condition that the world is
[26:51] in this is the condition laodicea is in
[26:54] it's in darkness amen it's in famine
[26:57] it's in a desert place
[26:59] but praise God there is spiritual food
[27:01] during the time of famine you just have
[27:04] to know where to find it amen
[27:06] let's turn to Mark chapter 6.
[27:10] we want to look at several scriptures
[27:12] here
[27:13] as we move into this subject
[27:18] Mark chapter 6.
[27:22] and we don't intend to preach anything
[27:24] new or anything we haven't heard before
[27:25] but to remind us of the things that are
[27:28] so dear to us amen because we need to be
[27:30] constantly reminded in the world that we
[27:33] live in because the world is trying to
[27:36] suck our time and attention
[27:38] and we have to remember we have to
[27:40] constantly be reminded of what the Wiles
[27:43] of the devil are and and what we've been
[27:45] given and what will help us to overcome
[27:47] this world Amen and so let's look at
[27:50] Mark chapter 6 verse 34.
[27:54] and Jesus when he came out saw much
[27:56] people and was moved with compassion
[27:58] toward them because they were a sheep
[28:00] not having a shepherd and he began to
[28:02] teach them many things
[28:04] and when the day was now far spent his
[28:06] disciples came unto him and said this is
[28:08] a desert place so they're now in a
[28:11] desert place this is a place of of no
[28:14] food no physical food this is a desert
[28:17] place and now the time has far past send
[28:21] them away that they may go into the
[28:22] country round about and into the
[28:24] villages and buy themselves bread for
[28:27] they have nothing to eat and he answered
[28:29] and said unto them give ye them to eat
[28:32] now now they're looking at the situation
[28:35] we're in a desert place there's no
[28:37] physical food here and and they say the
[28:40] time is far spent send them away let
[28:42] them go fend for themselves and go find
[28:44] whatever they can find to eat and Jesus
[28:47] says don't do that you feed them amen
[28:49] you give them to eat
[28:52] and let's pick this up read this again
[28:54] in verse 37 and the answer is said unto
[28:55] them give you them to eat and they said
[28:57] unto them shall we go and buy 200 penny
[29:00] worth of bread and give them to eat and
[29:03] he says unto them how many loaves have
[29:05] you go and see and when they knew they
[29:08] saved five and two fishes
[29:10] and he commanded them
[29:12] to sit he commanded them to make all sit
[29:16] down by companies upon the Green Grass
[29:18] and they sat down in ranks by hundreds
[29:20] and by 50s
[29:22] and when he had taken the Five Loaves
[29:24] and the two fishes he looked up to
[29:27] heaven and blessed and break the Loaves
[29:29] and gave them to his disciples to set
[29:31] before them and the two fishes divided
[29:33] he among them all and they did all eat
[29:36] and were filled and they took up 12
[29:38] baskets full of the fragments and of the
[29:41] fishes and they that did eat of the
[29:43] loaves were about five thousand men
[29:46] so here we see a situation where there's
[29:49] no there's no food Amen in the disciples
[29:52] solution is send them out to go find
[29:55] whatever they can but Jesus had
[29:57] compassion on them and he said no you
[29:59] feed them and how are we going to do
[30:01] this where will we buy shall we get a
[30:03] hundred penny worth which still would
[30:04] not have been sufficient and Jesus says
[30:07] what do you have amen quit looking all
[30:09] around quit scattering whatever you have
[30:12] is sufficient amen whatever you have
[30:15] amen Jesus knew that whatever they had
[30:18] he could multiply
[30:20] they found the the insufficiency of Five
[30:24] Loaves and two fishes
[30:26] brother remember says it was a lad was
[30:29] carrying it it was a little boy's lunch
[30:31] it was insufficient for 5 000 men
[30:34] besides women and children amen but
[30:36] Jesus wasn't looking at the
[30:38] insufficiency amen he was looking at the
[30:40] possibility
[30:43] so now they brought to him the Five
[30:45] Loaves and two fishes and he began to
[30:47] break amen and break and break and he
[30:49] took what little they had and in the
[30:52] hands of Jesus he multiplied it amen but
[30:55] what's amazing to me is when Jesus broke
[30:58] the bread and multiplied the bread amen
[31:00] he didn't give it to the people but he
[31:02] gave it to the disciples to give to the
[31:04] people
[31:05] and here he's setting his order amen
[31:08] Jesus is already setting his order that
[31:10] he's breaking the bread and the fishes
[31:12] and he's giving it to the disciples and
[31:13] the disciples are giving it out to the
[31:15] people amen and if when that when
[31:18] everybody came in order he said set them
[31:20] down by 50s and by hundreds and they sat
[31:22] down by 50s and by hundreds and he broke
[31:25] and gave to the disciples and disciples
[31:26] carried to the people and when everybody
[31:28] came into order they all ate till they
[31:31] were full and there was more than enough
[31:34] so we went from not enough to more than
[31:37] enough amen because Jesus orchestrated
[31:40] the order and all they had to do was do
[31:42] what he said amen and stay where he told
[31:45] them to stay and received the way he
[31:47] told him to receive and there was more
[31:49] than enough
[31:51] so the desert Place had plenty of food
[31:55] amen
[31:57] we're in a desert place
[32:00] when we talk about the condition of the
[32:02] world we talk about the laodicean
[32:03] condition and the condition of the
[32:05] religions of the world Amen it's a
[32:07] desert Place amen but when we come
[32:10] according to what God has taught us and
[32:12] we come in obedient to what God has
[32:14] taught us and we subject ourselves to
[32:16] God's order amen there's more than
[32:19] enough amen he can take what little bit
[32:21] we think we have and he can always
[32:22] multiply it to meet the need more
[32:25] abundantly not just enough but more than
[32:27] enough
[32:30] amen
[32:31] I mean if we want we can to believe in a
[32:34] god who's just enough amen but I believe
[32:36] in a god who's more than enough
[32:39] more than enough
[32:41] when we look at Matthew chapter 4 if we
[32:44] can turn over there to Matthew chapter
[32:46] 4.
[32:51] Matthew chapter 4 verse 4.
[32:56] Jesus says
[32:58] but he answered and said it is written
[33:00] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[33:03] every word that proceedeth out of the
[33:05] mouth of God so now we find in this time
[33:08] of spiritual famine it's not a piece of
[33:10] bread we're looking for but it's the
[33:11] word amen that's what we live by every
[33:14] word that proceedeth out on the mouth of
[33:15] God what is this Famine of it's a famine
[33:18] of hearing the word of God what do we
[33:20] live by amen every word that proceedeth
[33:24] out of the mouth of God what must we be
[33:25] feeding on the word of God
[33:29] amen let's turn with us turn with me to
[33:33] First Kings
[33:37] we're going to go to just a couple quick
[33:39] places in the life of Elijah
[33:44] First Kings 17. and 1.
[33:51] First Kings 17 and 1.
[33:58] and Elijah the tisspite who was of the
[34:00] inhabitants of Gilead sent unto Ahab as
[34:03] the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[34:05] whom I stand there shall not be do nor
[34:07] Reign these years but according to my
[34:09] word
[34:10] and the word of the Lord came unto him
[34:12] saying get thee hints and turn Eastward
[34:14] and hide thyself book by the Brook
[34:17] cherith that is before Jordan and it
[34:19] shall be that thou shalt drink of the
[34:21] Brook and I have commanded the Ravens to
[34:23] feed thee there so he went and did
[34:25] according
[34:27] according to the word of the Lord for he
[34:29] went and dwelt by the Brook cherith and
[34:31] that is before Jordan and the Ravens
[34:33] brought him bread and fish in the
[34:34] morning and bread and fish in the
[34:36] evening and he drank of the brook
[34:38] it man it's amazing that Elijah begins
[34:40] to speak a curse upon the Earth and when
[34:43] he speaks the curse the curse is going
[34:45] to be a drought that would bring famine
[34:47] but Elijah himself by the very word he
[34:50] gives is going to subject himself to the
[34:53] curse amen and he'll speak the word of
[34:55] God and take his stand and bring a
[34:57] judgment not yet knowing how he's going
[35:00] to save himself
[35:02] amen you've got such confidence in God
[35:04] he can come inspired and anointed by the
[35:07] spirit of God Amen and he can speak the
[35:09] word of God and bring the Judgment down
[35:11] and the Judgment was going to cut off
[35:13] the resources the natural resources no
[35:15] rain amen which will bring a famine but
[35:17] he himself now has no food amen but
[35:21] God's going to take care of his servants
[35:25] amen I think it's amazing that a lion
[35:27] didn't seek the provision before he
[35:30] spoke the word he spoke the word and
[35:32] trusted God for the provision
[35:34] he didn't know how he would eat for
[35:36] three and a half years he didn't have a
[35:37] stockpile of food somewhere we can tell
[35:39] by the scriptures he didn't make any
[35:41] preparation amen he just must speak the
[35:44] word and trust God that God has a plan
[35:46] amen and God hadn't yet revealed the
[35:49] plan to him he just went as far as he
[35:51] could and had to wait for God to reveal
[35:53] the rest
[35:56] praise God
[35:57] you know we try so hard to solve the
[36:01] equation before we enter in amen we try
[36:03] so hard to know the answer before we get
[36:06] started what will happen if I do this
[36:08] what will happen if I make this decision
[36:10] what will happen amen and all of a
[36:12] sudden we realize that we're being led
[36:14] intellectually and not spiritually into
[36:16] the things of God sometimes God will
[36:19] lead you to the first step and you have
[36:21] no idea where you're going to wind up
[36:22] but you know this is God leading me here
[36:25] and if God leads you here then he'll
[36:28] provide the provision that you need
[36:32] I mean think about Elijah calling for no
[36:36] rain for three and a half years and he
[36:39] didn't even have enough foresight to lay
[36:41] up three and a half years worth of food
[36:45] he just went by inspiration and God took
[36:48] care of the rest
[36:50] praise God
[36:52] I think sometimes we're
[36:55] we're too intellectual
[36:58] so God help me not to try to have
[37:02] everything spelled out when I know to do
[37:04] something God give me the faith just to
[37:06] move forward trusting you to work it all
[37:08] out
[37:09] so now he says in the in the scripture
[37:13] God comes to Elijah and says go hide
[37:17] thee
[37:18] Myself by the Brook cherith that is
[37:21] before Jordan
[37:22] and that shall be that thou shall drink
[37:23] of the Brook and I have commanded the
[37:26] Ravens to feed thee there
[37:29] there
[37:31] God didn't tell the Ravens to follow him
[37:33] all over wherever he felt like going
[37:36] he told him I have commanded the Ravens
[37:39] to feed you there the Ravens will find
[37:41] you there the Ravens will feed you there
[37:44] but you've got to be there I've made a
[37:46] provision for you but until you get
[37:48] there you don't get anything to eat
[37:51] I've got I've got I've got Birds amen
[37:54] that I have commissioned to feed you but
[37:56] I've commissioned them to feed you there
[37:58] not everywhere
[38:01] amen I tell you remember when brother
[38:04] Abraham Myra he preached the message on
[38:06] this and he talked to he typed the
[38:08] Ravens with the fightful ministry
[38:10] you remember that in the faithful
[38:12] Ministry amen we're our commissioned to
[38:14] bring the food just like the disciples
[38:16] amen were commissioned to take the
[38:18] broken bread and distribute it among
[38:20] those that were sitting there in groups
[38:22] of 50 and groups of a hundred amen if
[38:24] you wanted the food you had to get it
[38:26] from the disciples who got it from
[38:28] Christ
[38:29] and now if Elijah wanted the food he had
[38:32] to go to the appointed place that God
[38:34] told him and wait there for God's
[38:36] provided way and God's provided way was
[38:39] the Ravens amen
[38:41] amen wait what was I thought was so
[38:43] amusing is when brother Abraham preached
[38:45] as he typed him the faithful mystery of
[38:47] the Ravens and he talked about how God
[38:49] could use such a bird
[38:52] to do such a work
[38:55] because a raven amen a raven in the
[38:58] Bible is always a got a bad connotation
[39:00] with it amen it was the Raven who could
[39:03] feed on the dead of caring and the
[39:05] floods of Noah and not return but the
[39:07] dove couldn't do that amen amen but the
[39:09] Raven the raven could feed on the wheat
[39:11] and the raven could feed on the dead
[39:13] carcasses remember brother I'm talking
[39:15] about this why would God use such a bird
[39:18] it wasn't for Elijah to question God but
[39:21] to receive what God had provided
[39:24] and when you look at oh my goodness when
[39:28] you look at the foolishness of preaching
[39:31] that's what the scripture is called the
[39:32] foolishness of preaching that God would
[39:34] use somebody born sin born in flesh
[39:38] capable mistakes and making them all the
[39:40] time
[39:42] you know God doesn't use somebody who
[39:44] already came to Perfection to preach the
[39:46] gospel
[39:48] God uses a human being exactly like the
[39:51] human being sitting in the sea one
[39:53] identical to that is the one standing
[39:55] behind the pool but there's no
[39:56] difference whatsoever
[39:58] no difference in the mistakes no
[40:00] difference in the wrong thinking no
[40:02] difference and there's no there's no
[40:03] difference whatsoever amen between the
[40:06] one standing here and the one sitting
[40:08] there there's no difference the only
[40:09] difference is a calling of God and a
[40:11] positional placement by God himself
[40:14] so so you know so many people they just
[40:18] want everything pure and everything
[40:20] clean and no possibility to mistake I
[40:23] won't eat unless a dove brings it
[40:30] can you imagine Elijah when the Raven
[40:33] shows up and it's a it's a raven
[40:38] God couldn't you why not a dove
[40:42] even a turtle dove or a pigeon it
[40:45] doesn't even have to be a snow white
[40:46] though just
[40:48] why not a dove
[40:51] God says I commanded the Ravens to feed
[40:53] you there
[40:58] you know there's so so many things that
[41:01] sound good intellectually
[41:04] like I I don't want to listen to
[41:07] preachers because preachers get it wrong
[41:08] I want to go I want the Holy Ghost just
[41:11] to tell me I only want the dove I don't
[41:13] want any Raven to give me any food I
[41:15] only want the dove
[41:18] I only want the best I don't want
[41:20] anything
[41:22] listen what did God tell us in this day
[41:24] amen he told us he told us in his word
[41:27] and he told us and confirmed it through
[41:29] the prophet that God wants to feed his
[41:32] children amen he wants to feed you there
[41:36] where you're sitting now he wants to
[41:38] feed you there
[41:40] coming into the house of the God and the
[41:42] fellowship it's a place that God's
[41:43] called us to be
[41:45] and God may use an ugly bird and God may
[41:48] use something that's not perfect and
[41:49] something that maybe you know we're all
[41:52] sin born we're all in hybrid flesh we
[41:54] all have a sticky cockle burn nature
[41:56] that's going to trip us up we're all in
[41:58] the same boat amen you know none of us
[42:01] are perfect
[42:03] but I we can't help it this is what God
[42:07] Said too
[42:08] we can't change God's word this is what
[42:11] God Said I will commanded that that that
[42:15] ugly that that Fallen that that that
[42:17] that one with the ability to fall with
[42:19] just as much mistakes and complexes as
[42:21] you've had I'm calling him to give you
[42:24] that food
[42:27] you either take it or you don't and you
[42:30] can starve to death waiting on a dove
[42:35] or will come God's appointed way
[42:37] and the received from God
[42:40] remember brother Benham said he was
[42:42] taking Sam they were taking sandwiches
[42:43] off the king's table
[42:45] there was nothing wrong with the food
[42:48] it was the bird that wasn't so great
[42:50] but the food was good
[42:53] so you don't have to love the bird
[42:57] right you don't have to think the bird's
[42:59] perfect you don't have to think the bird
[43:01] is is excellent in every way the issue
[43:04] is where did they get the sandwich amen
[43:06] where did it come from if it came from
[43:07] the king's table I want to eat it amen I
[43:10] want to receive it
[43:12] means the quality of the food that he
[43:15] received not the quality of the carrier
[43:18] praise God so I will feed you there so
[43:22] in a time of famine God had an appointed
[43:25] place and an appointed way and in this
[43:28] time of Phantom and God has an appointed
[43:30] place and God has an appointed way
[43:33] and the message spiritual food and due
[43:35] season the prophet said Elijah had a
[43:37] secret place provided by God himself
[43:39] now the church never provided it for him
[43:41] the king never provided it for him he
[43:43] didn't provide himself
[43:45] but God provided a secret place for
[43:48] Elijah to be fed all the time during the
[43:50] drought where his food was provided day
[43:52] by day he didn't need to wonder what's
[43:55] going to happen tomorrow or wonder if
[43:57] the supply run out
[43:58] God said I have commanded the Ravens and
[44:01] they'll feed you what a wonderful thing
[44:03] a type of our secret place in Christ
[44:06] God's provided a secret place in this
[44:09] day in him amen and he's constantly
[44:11] feeding us but we don't have to worry
[44:13] about whether he'll feed us tomorrow or
[44:16] if the Ravens will show back up because
[44:18] God commanded the Ravens to feed you
[44:20] there as long as you're there God will
[44:22] feed you there
[44:24] as long as we come in obedience to what
[44:27] God Said the word says forsake not the
[44:29] sibling together of yourselves even the
[44:31] more so as you see the evil day
[44:32] approaching amen and God told us that
[44:34] the fivefold ministry are here to bring
[44:36] the body into Perfection amen
[44:40] amen they may not be the best looking
[44:43] birds amen they may not be the most
[44:45] desirable amen but they are God's
[44:47] provided way amen
[44:49] and so God if we'll stay in his position
[44:51] God will be faithful to feed us we don't
[44:54] have to worry about what will happen
[44:56] next and what will happen will they will
[44:59] the Raven show up amen today and you
[45:02] know I don't believe that Elijah amen
[45:04] was was saving half of his sandwich in a
[45:07] little crack in a rock somewhere in case
[45:09] the Raven didn't come back in the
[45:10] evening
[45:12] because God said I will send them in the
[45:14] morning and I will send them again in
[45:16] the evening time amen and and every day
[45:19] morning and evening they Faithfully came
[45:21] according to the word of God Amen he
[45:23] didn't have any other provision and no
[45:26] way to provide for himself
[45:29] he was trusting God to keep his word
[45:32] I believe we can trust God to keep his
[45:34] word
[45:41] Amen brother Benham said
[45:43] the hardest thing that God has ever got
[45:45] to do or had to do was to get one mortal
[45:47] to believe another
[45:49] you believe anything almost but one
[45:53] person believing another that's a hard
[45:55] thing
[45:56] we'll believe in all kinds of conspiracy
[45:58] theories and wild ideas but just to
[46:01] believe that God's using that man and
[46:03] that's God's provided away that's pretty
[46:05] tough sometimes
[46:07] amen
[46:09] so the prophet said that's the hardest
[46:11] thing God has ever got to do
[46:15] but God chose to use man
[46:18] so we have to come cause provided way
[46:21] brother man he tells us in taking sides
[46:24] with Jesus in 1962
[46:26] says now you remember what that dream
[46:28] that I got the interpretation was go
[46:31] back and store up the food mother
[46:33] Brenham had a dream and and in the dream
[46:35] he was going to go overseas he was going
[46:37] to take a boat and there was two boatmen
[46:39] in the boat and there was a little white
[46:41] canoe he could take and it was fast and
[46:43] he can but but he he in the dream he was
[46:46] realizing amen that he had meetings over
[46:48] across the ocean and that little boat
[46:51] wouldn't make it it's good for going up
[46:52] and down the coast if he does a local
[46:53] meeting that's good but not for going
[46:55] clear across the ocean and he says go
[46:57] like them to two boatmen they were just
[46:59] two friends and they were packed in
[47:00] camping gear like they were going on a
[47:02] trip and he was invited to go to
[47:04] Switzerland as a tourist and take one
[47:06] meeting that's what the little boat
[47:07] represented and God told him not to do
[47:09] it but stay and store up the food amen
[47:12] store up the food so brother Branham was
[47:15] not to go overseas at that time there in
[47:17] 1962 but he was going to stay amen and
[47:20] brother Brahm said we made a whole bunch
[47:21] of tapes Amen on all kinds of teaching
[47:23] so this is the dream that he's referring
[47:25] to go back and store with the food where
[47:28] was The Storehouse this Tabernacle where
[47:30] is there anything like it in the country
[47:31] around here anywhere that will compare
[47:33] with the message that we have
[47:35] where would you go to find it shows it's
[47:38] show its comparison anywhere you go
[47:41] right out in denominational Creeds
[47:42] you'll go right away from the name of
[47:43] the Lord Jesus you'll go right out away
[47:45] from these other things and here is
[47:47] where the food has been stored up
[47:50] well one message that I preached here to
[47:52] you all look I've preached from one to
[47:55] six hours to you on a message well if I
[47:57] had to use one of those messages it
[47:58] would take a week to take it just a
[48:00] little bit here and a little bit there
[48:02] see because it's been stored up here
[48:04] he's saying if he preached if he
[48:05] preached a six-hour message which was
[48:07] spoken word as the Original Seed out in
[48:09] the meetings at 45 minutes before he
[48:12] would have a prayer line he goes I'd
[48:14] preach a little bit here a little bit
[48:15] there but he came home and he preached
[48:16] in the full length
[48:20] it's on tapes it'll go worldwide on
[48:22] those tapes where the people in their
[48:24] houses them tapes will fall right into
[48:26] the hands of the predestinated of God
[48:29] he can direct the word he'll direct
[48:31] everything just exactly to its course
[48:33] that's the reason he sent me back to do
[48:35] this store up the food here he forbid me
[48:39] to go overseas so brother Venom was
[48:42] saying we've stored up the food amen and
[48:44] I want to pay attention to this because
[48:46] the food was stored up because it would
[48:50] be needed later
[48:52] this is really important to catch
[48:55] there's a reason it was stored up
[48:57] in John 6 35 Jesus says I am the bread
[49:01] of life
[49:03] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[49:05] and he that believeth on me shall never
[49:07] thirst so this bread that we have need
[49:09] of is Jesus Christ amen and man shall
[49:12] not live by bread alone but every word
[49:14] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[49:16] and Jesus Christ is the word amen
[49:19] so we know what this word what was
[49:21] brother Benham storing up he wasn't
[49:23] storing up tapes he was storing up the
[49:25] revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:27] the word for this hour
[49:29] he comes to the message Christ is the
[49:32] mystery of God revealed and this message
[49:34] he says and once just a while ago when
[49:37] you showed the vision the little
[49:38] Tabernacle here are about to store up
[49:39] the food that there would come a time
[49:42] when this would all be needed
[49:44] store up the food because there will
[49:45] come a time when all of this will be
[49:48] needed
[49:49] when we seen brother softman and brother
[49:51] Woods ready to cross over into the
[49:52] country but you said store up this food
[49:54] here for the time lord reverently I've
[49:57] tried to do that
[49:59] then that was paragraph five he drops
[50:01] down the paragraph 90 in the same
[50:02] message help this morning Lord as we
[50:04] read the word
[50:05] May the Holy Spirit reveal it to us that
[50:07] the church might be fully established in
[50:10] the faith that was once delivered to the
[50:12] Saints to hold them
[50:13] and may as you've gave the vision some
[50:15] two years ago to store up the food fine
[50:17] healthy looking vegetables that I saw in
[50:19] the vision being stored here in the
[50:21] Tabernacle may we today receive a whole
[50:24] barrel full of that
[50:27] amen Granite Lord or a tape load
[50:30] so A Bear full is a tape load
[50:33] a tape load is a barrel full
[50:37] may we may we today receive a whole
[50:40] barrel full what's he preaching Christ
[50:42] is the mystery of God revealed what's he
[50:43] doing he's still storing up food
[50:48] he said for the there would come a time
[50:51] when this would be needed
[50:54] I believe we're in the time
[50:57] so may we receive a whole Bear full of
[50:59] it Granite Lord or a tape load that it
[51:01] might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the
[51:03] hour that we live to give a sustaining
[51:06] strength the spiritual strength for the
[51:08] task that lays ahead granted father
[51:12] praise God
[51:14] so Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[51:16] it was a barrel full
[51:18] of stored up food
[51:20] let's look here again at First Kings 17.
[51:24] let's look at chapter 17 verse 8.
[51:28] I'm sorry I want to begin at verse 7.
[51:31] and it came to pass after a while that
[51:33] the brook dried up because there had
[51:35] been no rain in the land
[51:37] so God had told Elijah you go to this
[51:41] Brook and you stay there and I will feed
[51:44] you there and God was faithful but all
[51:46] of a sudden the brook dried up and you
[51:48] say is God unfaithful to his word no God
[51:51] is faithful as ever before but God has a
[51:54] widow woman who needs something amen so
[51:57] now he's going to bring Elijah in
[51:59] contact with this woman so that she can
[52:01] have her provision
[52:03] so God is just moving God is just moving
[52:07] Elijah amen and there's something else I
[52:09] want to see in this so many times we hit
[52:11] obstacles in our life and when we hit
[52:13] those obstacles we begin to doubt who we
[52:16] are and what God told us and God's
[52:19] provision and all of a sudden we may hit
[52:20] a financial obstacle or work-related
[52:23] obstacle a health obstacle a family or
[52:25] whatever we hit some obstacle in life
[52:27] and immediately we start to question
[52:29] everything
[52:31] am I a Son of God where have I failed
[52:33] what's wrong with my life did I miss the
[52:35] mark somewhere and we start this whole
[52:37] list of questions and the funny thing is
[52:39] we do it every single time
[52:41] all right and there's nothing wrong with
[52:43] reflecting on our lives we should do
[52:45] that
[52:46] but we begin to down and you know what
[52:49] when the provisions were all coming in
[52:51] we didn't doubt our sonship we didn't
[52:53] doubt God's provision we didn't doubt
[52:56] all of a sudden something changes
[52:58] nothing changed with God's attitude
[53:00] towards Elijah Elijah had done nothing
[53:02] wrong what it was was God was
[53:04] repositioning Elijah for another work
[53:07] amen and sometimes things happen in our
[53:09] lives all it is is God repositioning us
[53:13] let him reposition us amen let him prove
[53:16] himself Mighty on our behalf sometimes
[53:18] God wants us to make a change make a
[53:20] move make a decision you know allow
[53:22] things to happen so that we quit sitting
[53:24] I mean comfortably moving doing nothing
[53:27] he brings something in our lives to
[53:29] reposition us
[53:31] don't be afraid of the repositioning it
[53:33] doesn't mean God changed his mind about
[53:35] us
[53:37] praise God
[53:39] is good
[53:41] so now the brook dried up not because
[53:43] God was no longer faithful to his word
[53:45] but because God was very faithful
[53:48] to all of his people
[53:50] verse 8 and the word of the Lord came
[53:53] unto them saying arise get thee
[53:55] desireaphath which belong with design
[53:58] and dwell there behold I have commanded
[54:00] a widow woman there to sustain thee he's
[54:02] going into Gentile territory now
[54:06] so he arose and went to Zarephath and
[54:08] when he came to the gate of the city
[54:09] behold the widow woman was there
[54:11] Gathering of sticks and he called to her
[54:14] and said fetch me I pray thee a little
[54:15] water and a vessel that I may drink and
[54:18] as she was going to fetch it he called
[54:19] to her and said bring me I pray the
[54:21] immortal of bread in thy hand
[54:23] and she said as the Lord thy God liveth
[54:26] I have not a cake but a handful of meal
[54:28] in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise
[54:31] and behold I am Gathering two sticks
[54:33] that I may go in and dress it for me and
[54:35] my son that we may eat it and die
[54:40] look at that wording
[54:42] she didn't say that we'll eat it and
[54:43] live
[54:45] she had run out of Christ
[54:49] she had run out of the word
[54:52] the denominational system has run out of
[54:55] Christ
[54:57] they have run out of the word there is
[55:00] no more word to sustain amen them and
[55:03] and she's going to make a cake she has
[55:06] just a little bit left Amen to go and
[55:09] make a cake and die not to make a cake
[55:12] and live
[55:14] she has come in this time of famine she
[55:18] has come to the end of everything
[55:21] but that's when she's introduced to the
[55:22] Elijah Ministry
[55:26] praise God
[55:27] [Music]
[55:29] so she says now that we may eat it and
[55:32] die verse 13 and Elijah said unto her
[55:36] fear not go and do as thou has said but
[55:38] make me thereof a little cake first
[55:41] and bring it unto me and after make for
[55:43] thee and for thy son for thus saith the
[55:46] Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal
[55:48] shall not waste neither shall the crews
[55:50] of oil fail until the day that the Lord
[55:52] sendeth rain upon the Earth and she went
[55:54] and did according to the saying of
[55:56] Elijah and she and he in her house did
[55:59] eat many days and the barrel of meal
[56:02] wasted not neither did the crews of oil
[56:04] fail according to the word of the Lord
[56:06] which he spake by Elijah
[56:10] praise God
[56:12] brother bam says in the message be
[56:14] certain of God he says see he had to
[56:16] catch her attention he said would you
[56:18] fetch me a little water and she said I
[56:20] will and as she turned and started he
[56:21] said and just bring me a little morsel
[56:23] of bread in your hand Elijah's seeing
[56:25] that Vision already know what the
[56:27] condition was and she said as the Lord
[56:30] liveth Elijah knew she was a Christian
[56:31] then a Believer as the Lord liveth I've
[56:34] only got just a handful of me on a
[56:36] spoonful of oil that I've already
[56:38] prepared I've dressed it got it ready
[56:40] and I'm taking those two sticks to make
[56:42] a little cake for my son and I and we
[56:44] are going to eat it and die
[56:46] see now here comes a great lesson but
[56:48] Elijah said bake me one first
[56:50] oh what is that there what lesson do we
[56:53] learn seek ye first the kingdom of God
[56:55] and his righteousness
[56:58] bake me one first and she looked she
[57:00] said I wonder who that is there's
[57:02] something about the man that seems to be
[57:04] different and he said make me one first
[57:06] and bring it and she started in to do
[57:08] what he said then she heard that
[57:10] comforting word that always Comforts for
[57:13] thus saith the Lord the bearer will not
[57:16] be empty nor the crews run dry until the
[57:18] day that God sends rain on the Earth
[57:22] amen here she is she's got just enough
[57:25] meal Christ and just enough oil Spirit
[57:28] to bake a cake to die
[57:31] but when she comes in contact with the
[57:34] Elijah Ministry amen he says bake me one
[57:36] first and if you put the kingdom of God
[57:40] first amen sometimes so many people are
[57:42] afraid Amen to take God's provided way
[57:45] because they're afraid of what they'll
[57:46] lose this woman had nothing to lose and
[57:49] I'm telling you if you're in a
[57:50] denominational system you've got nothing
[57:52] to lose because you have nothing
[57:56] you're starving to death you have no you
[57:59] have no food for overcoming you have no
[58:01] power to resist the Wiles of the devil
[58:03] you have not enough Spirit to overcome
[58:05] the world and to live a holy Christian
[58:07] Life
[58:10] you've got nothing to lose in listening
[58:14] to the voice of Elijah but everything to
[58:17] gain amen instead of eating one more
[58:20] bite to die amen why not giving up the
[58:23] last little bit of what you think you
[58:25] have amen what you have spiritually what
[58:27] you have in faith amen and give it over
[58:30] to the Elijah Ministry so that in doing
[58:32] so amen that Ministry by a prophecy can
[58:35] provide unto you enough to sustain all
[58:39] the way through the rest of this drought
[58:41] and bring you all the way into the rain
[58:43] falls in the millennial reign of Christ
[58:45] and bring you into a Bountiful Harvest
[58:47] and until that time amen there's a
[58:50] promise if we will give what little bit
[58:53] we have amen what faith we have in
[58:55] Christ what little bit of the word we
[58:56] know and give it over to the Elijah
[58:59] Ministry amen we will have food that
[59:01] will sustain us all the way through to
[59:03] the catching away of the Bride
[59:08] amen what did she lose she was going to
[59:11] eat and die
[59:13] she was in the process of spiritual
[59:15] death
[59:17] and all she could do is eat what little
[59:19] bit she had to die not eat to live
[59:24] now she could exchange that little bit
[59:28] that'll sustain her for further death
[59:31] and now give that little bit over
[59:33] to the way of God and have enough to
[59:36] give her spiritual life all the way
[59:38] through the family
[59:40] what an exchange
[59:43] can you imagine she wretched down in
[59:45] that Barrel tilted it on the side
[59:47] smacked it on the side to get all the
[59:49] dust down to just enough to make a cake
[59:51] and she scooped that Barrel clean amen
[59:54] she had nothing left to give but
[59:57] everything she have she gave
[1:00:01] that's the way to serve God
[1:00:05] it may seem like she was losing a lot
[1:00:07] she was losing nothing
[1:00:10] when we came to Christ when we came to
[1:00:12] this living Jesus Christ manifest in the
[1:00:15] end time we thought we were giving him
[1:00:17] all but our all was really we didn't
[1:00:19] have anything friends
[1:00:21] we were in desert condition we were in
[1:00:23] famine condition we were emaciated amen
[1:00:26] and had nothing but crumbs but we felt
[1:00:28] like we were giving over everything we
[1:00:30] were giving the last bit of nothing
[1:00:33] in order to get everything
[1:00:38] so this woman now she gives and she has
[1:00:41] a promise and now now when she goes back
[1:00:44] the next meal and she dips in there's
[1:00:47] meal in the barrel
[1:00:49] there's meal in the barrel she had
[1:00:51] scraped it out but now there's meal in
[1:00:53] the barrel and and I don't know how much
[1:00:55] meal was in the barrel but I just
[1:00:58] knowing the way God works I don't think
[1:01:01] that now she walked in the house and had
[1:01:03] 15 barrels of meal and enough barrels
[1:01:06] that she can count them and say praise
[1:01:09] God this will last through the three and
[1:01:10] a half years of the prophecy
[1:01:13] no I think she just had some meal in the
[1:01:15] barrel
[1:01:17] it may have been half full three
[1:01:18] quarters full quarter full I don't know
[1:01:20] how full it was but but the promise that
[1:01:22] she had was the barrel won't go empty
[1:01:25] she didn't walk into a storehouse full
[1:01:27] of barrels that she couldn't weigh okay
[1:01:30] if we each have a cake in the morning we
[1:01:32] each have a cake in the evening and it's
[1:01:34] about this many ounces and this many
[1:01:35] barrels oh that should go three and a
[1:01:37] half that might go three years and seven
[1:01:39] months
[1:01:41] she she couldn't have that kind of rest
[1:01:44] God never gives us that kind of carnal
[1:01:47] rest intellectual arrest but he requires
[1:01:50] that we keep operating by faith every
[1:01:52] day so that when she would scoop out the
[1:01:54] meal to make for herself to make for
[1:01:56] Elijah to make for her boy she had to
[1:01:59] trust that God would replenish what she
[1:02:01] scooped out
[1:02:03] according to the word that she he
[1:02:06] promised her she had to stand upon the
[1:02:08] promise of God not upon what her eyes
[1:02:11] would tell her amen because she could
[1:02:13] look in that barrel and no maybe that's
[1:02:15] enough for a day maybe that's enough for
[1:02:17] two days I don't know how much was in
[1:02:19] there but it wasn't enough for three and
[1:02:20] a half years
[1:02:25] but she would scoop out and make the
[1:02:27] cakes
[1:02:29] the next meal she would scoop out and
[1:02:31] make the case she would pour the cruise
[1:02:32] and oil kept coming out
[1:02:36] she didn't walk in and have cruises of
[1:02:38] oil lining the walls
[1:02:41] he said the barrel whatever runs right
[1:02:43] and the cruiser born
[1:02:46] so she kept dipping the same cruise and
[1:02:48] then kept oil coming out
[1:02:51] that's why we don't need a new message
[1:02:53] we don't need another messenger we don't
[1:02:55] need somebody else all we need is to
[1:02:57] keep going back to the same Barrel amen
[1:02:59] because it was stored up long ago for a
[1:03:02] day in the future that we would need it
[1:03:04] and we're in that day and it's already
[1:03:07] there friends he's promised it to be
[1:03:09] there
[1:03:10] you say well brother Chad I've already
[1:03:12] read that book
[1:03:14] go and read it again you'll find more
[1:03:16] meal amen
[1:03:18] I've been through that 10 times go
[1:03:20] through it 10 more times because every
[1:03:22] time you'll find a little more meal to
[1:03:24] get you through to the next one
[1:03:27] there's always more of Christ in this
[1:03:29] message more of Christ being unfolded
[1:03:31] and listen can you imagine the the the
[1:03:34] this little woman who knows what kind of
[1:03:37] condition she was in as she was trying
[1:03:39] to ration what little bit she had coming
[1:03:41] down to the inevitable day of her death
[1:03:43] and her son's death
[1:03:45] she was probably weak amen like all the
[1:03:47] other people were weak maybe beginning
[1:03:49] to show signs of starvation maybe a
[1:03:51] hollow cheeks maybe her little arms were
[1:03:53] thin and maybe the little child was
[1:03:55] losing weight and who knows what kind of
[1:03:57] condition they were in but as the famine
[1:04:00] wore on everybody around them became
[1:04:03] more emaciated
[1:04:06] weaker
[1:04:08] showing more signs of starvation and
[1:04:11] maybe there was even Death Around
[1:04:14] but This Woman's cheeks were full amen
[1:04:17] her little boy was growing he was
[1:04:19] getting taller all the time she could
[1:04:21] put him his back against the door and
[1:04:23] Mark his growth why because she gave
[1:04:26] everything to Christ and Christ was
[1:04:28] giving her a portion in the time of
[1:04:30] famine that was causing health and
[1:04:32] vitality and growth and brother Branham
[1:04:34] said she became a witness
[1:04:38] a witness amen that in the time of
[1:04:40] famine you can grow in the time of
[1:04:43] famine you can be spiritually healthy in
[1:04:45] the time of famine you can have fat rosy
[1:04:48] cheeks
[1:04:49] your children can grow and prosper and
[1:04:52] come into the full statue of Christ
[1:04:55] because there's food
[1:04:58] I can also imagine her going back to the
[1:05:01] barrel
[1:05:03] scooping out and making the cakes and
[1:05:05] sitting down
[1:05:07] I can imagine that little boy going Mom
[1:05:09] this is so good
[1:05:12] you know how it is when you're sitting
[1:05:14] there feasting and saying oh it's so
[1:05:16] good
[1:05:17] this is so good this is better than
[1:05:20] yesterday
[1:05:21] what did you do different
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:26] just better than it used to be what did
[1:05:28] you change I didn't change anything it's
[1:05:30] the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:05:32] today and forever you're feeding on the
[1:05:35] same word amen but as you grow every
[1:05:38] time she dipped out of the bucket
[1:05:40] remember God was sustaining that barrel
[1:05:42] with a meal every time she dipped out of
[1:05:45] the barrel that was food for that day
[1:05:48] that was Christ for that day amen that
[1:05:51] wasn't yesterday's Christ that wasn't
[1:05:53] tomorrow's Christ that was today's
[1:05:55] Christ
[1:05:56] and today's Christ is always the
[1:05:58] tastiest you've ever had
[1:06:02] that's why I I don't know about you but
[1:06:04] this Christ is to me it seems like it's
[1:06:07] so much better than it was five years
[1:06:09] ago it's so much tastier so much more
[1:06:11] satisfying full of flavor you you come
[1:06:14] to the service and feed on the word and
[1:06:16] it's like this is amazing this is
[1:06:18] unbelievable amen but that's what you
[1:06:20] said four years ago that's why you said
[1:06:22] six years ago that this is the best how
[1:06:24] can it get any better it's the same
[1:06:26] Jesus Christ yesterday today and forever
[1:06:29] but the portion for your day is the
[1:06:31] tastiest you can ever eat today
[1:06:35] you can't stomach tomorrow's yet you got
[1:06:37] to grow up for that yesterday's you've
[1:06:39] already grown past but today's portion
[1:06:42] is the portion that tastes the best
[1:06:44] and I trust if time continues and we're
[1:06:47] here 10 years from now we'll be saying
[1:06:49] my goodness I can't believe this is the
[1:06:51] best message I've ever heard I can't
[1:06:53] believe where is that man getting this
[1:06:56] stuff
[1:06:58] amen where is he getting it out of the
[1:07:01] barrel that was stored up in the 1960s
[1:07:03] amen because it was put away for a
[1:07:06] future need
[1:07:08] and and I believe there was enough
[1:07:11] stored up to carry us all the way
[1:07:13] through
[1:07:17] and every time we go to the storehouse
[1:07:21] and crack open another mason jar
[1:07:25] somehow the longer it sits undiscovered
[1:07:29] the better it takes
[1:07:33] amen
[1:07:37] the wine gets better with age
[1:07:41] and this this little woman and a boy he
[1:07:44] was growing noticeably he was growing
[1:07:48] and the meal that she was eating listen
[1:07:51] she was going to the same barrel and
[1:07:54] pulling out the same scoop and using the
[1:07:56] same oil and it was the right food for
[1:07:59] the pastor
[1:08:01] for the woman
[1:08:03] and for the boy
[1:08:06] she didn't fix a separate meal for the
[1:08:09] leader of the church had to eat a
[1:08:10] special diet and the woman in the house
[1:08:12] the widow woman or the little boy they
[1:08:15] didn't need special food they all ate
[1:08:17] the same Christ for their day
[1:08:20] amen the teenagers don't need a
[1:08:22] different watered-down message they need
[1:08:24] the same message that feeds Mom and Dad
[1:08:27] the same one that feeds the pastor feeds
[1:08:29] the mother in The Home feeds the father
[1:08:31] in The Home feeds the teenage boy it's
[1:08:33] the same Christ for our day that every
[1:08:36] one of us need
[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:39] we don't need a program we don't need to
[1:08:41] water it down we don't need to change it
[1:08:43] we just need to preach it in the
[1:08:44] fullness of its power
[1:08:46] if you've got a child you may not fix
[1:08:47] them as big a cake
[1:08:49] but they're going to eat the same food
[1:08:51] amen
[1:08:54] praise be to God
[1:08:56] amen this is what God's been given us to
[1:08:59] overcome by this is what God's been
[1:09:00] given us Amen to rise above amen the
[1:09:03] false doctrines of this world Amen we
[1:09:06] don't need to change and we don't need
[1:09:07] to alter it we don't need to keep it
[1:09:08] from the kids we need to feed them the
[1:09:10] same thing we're eating
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:16] brother bam said in spiritual food in
[1:09:18] due season you say you say why is it
[1:09:20] that the message don't go out in these
[1:09:22] great big places these big Crusades like
[1:09:24] amongst the denominations
[1:09:26] it's not their food
[1:09:29] it's not the church so-called food it's
[1:09:32] bride food
[1:09:33] it's spiritual food in season it would
[1:09:37] make them sick at their stomach it's too
[1:09:40] rich for them
[1:09:45] you can't do it but for the children
[1:09:47] it's bread it's life it's Jesus Christ
[1:09:50] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:53] amen why no matter how much we want to
[1:09:56] distribute the food everywhere amen it's
[1:10:00] not everyone's food
[1:10:03] amen I was so amazed when uh brother
[1:10:06] Samuel was here on Sunday and he started
[1:10:09] talking about the restaurant the special
[1:10:10] food and the Seven Courts because God
[1:10:12] had already laid this message on my
[1:10:14] heart to preach I already knew I was
[1:10:15] going to preach this message and
[1:10:17] actually I was sitting in my seat going
[1:10:18] well I'm going to have to get a new
[1:10:19] message
[1:10:20] for Wednesday but then he stopped and
[1:10:22] turned and I said Thank You Lord
[1:10:25] because it's always food and due season
[1:10:29] amen and and now the food we would
[1:10:32] distribute it we wouldn't hold it from
[1:10:34] anybody we would give it to everybody
[1:10:37] we want everybody to eat it but
[1:10:39] realizing this isn't food for everybody
[1:10:41] it makes some sick
[1:10:44] have you ever given it to a message to
[1:10:46] somebody and saw it make them sick
[1:10:49] they get sick they get repulsed they get
[1:10:51] angry they get scared they get upset
[1:10:53] amen it's not their food that's okay
[1:10:55] amen it's not everybody's food
[1:10:58] that's why we don't force feed anybody
[1:11:01] because it'll make them sick they can't
[1:11:03] digest it it's not for them we're not
[1:11:05] here to cram this down anybody's throat
[1:11:06] we make it available for whosoever will
[1:11:09] come let him come and eat but there's
[1:11:11] only one kind of person on the earth
[1:11:13] that's predestinated to eat this food
[1:11:15] because it's fried food
[1:11:20] amen
[1:11:23] amen when we when we went over to uh
[1:11:26] Junction City yesterday I I pulled
[1:11:31] dropped my tailgate and I had two bags
[1:11:32] of dog food laying there that I forgot
[1:11:33] to unload
[1:11:34] I said oh dear we gotta load this so we
[1:11:36] moved it out of the way and then we had
[1:11:38] books I had boxes of books that we're
[1:11:40] going to give out Church age books and
[1:11:42] seals books so I put them back there I
[1:11:44] was driving down the road and I told
[1:11:45] Brother Kyle I said well we got dog food
[1:11:47] and Eagle food in the back
[1:11:52] we'll see what they want to eat
[1:11:56] foreign
[1:11:59] it's bride food
[1:12:02] Theory it gives us strength it gives us
[1:12:04] Health it helps us grow
[1:12:07] it's designed for us and it's designed
[1:12:10] for this day
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:13] I tell you there's so many times that
[1:12:15] I'll preach on Sunday and go home and
[1:12:17] lay down and wake up Monday morning and
[1:12:19] the first thought that I have in my mind
[1:12:21] is what in the world am I going to
[1:12:23] preach Wednesday
[1:12:25] I have no idea I poured my heart out I
[1:12:27] preached everything I was inspired to
[1:12:28] preach I've got not one thought left in
[1:12:31] my mind and not a single thing I can sit
[1:12:32] there and think to preach nothing but
[1:12:36] praise God by the time Wednesday I took
[1:12:38] another dip out of the barrel and
[1:12:39] there's some more meal
[1:12:41] amen it's not that we can look and say
[1:12:43] there's barrels and barrels and barrels
[1:12:46] and barrels we've got the message the
[1:12:47] message amen is full the message we can
[1:12:50] see will sustain us all the way through
[1:12:51] but I don't know where I'm going to get
[1:12:54] tomorrow's portion that comes by God's
[1:12:56] grace because he knows just which dip
[1:12:58] out of the barrel we need
[1:13:00] we are so dependent on his leadership
[1:13:03] amen we don't have Series in our minds
[1:13:05] we don't have five messages planned out
[1:13:07] we are going day by day and that's how
[1:13:10] Elijah was fed day by day amen that's
[1:13:13] how the woman went back to the barrel
[1:13:14] day by day and all of us are fed by the
[1:13:18] Holy Ghost day by day
[1:13:22] I I wish it was easier for me
[1:13:26] I'd love to know my next five sermons
[1:13:28] and then I could wake up Monday morning
[1:13:29] with no problem
[1:13:31] but that's not the way it works
[1:13:34] I've had agonizing days trying to find
[1:13:37] the inspiration of the Lord I've had
[1:13:39] Saturdays where I've cried throughout
[1:13:41] the day saying God you have to feed your
[1:13:43] sheep I got not one thing
[1:13:46] I have a little code word for my wife
[1:13:49] when she knows I'm struggling
[1:13:50] I say the sales up but there's no wind
[1:13:54] that means I've got the ship ready we've
[1:13:56] battened down the hatches I've raised
[1:13:57] the sail I'm standing at the helm but if
[1:14:00] there's no wind the ship ain't going
[1:14:01] anywhere
[1:14:03] we read we pray we read the message we
[1:14:06] we do everything we know how to do but
[1:14:08] if God doesn't send the wind of
[1:14:10] inspiration there's nothing this ship
[1:14:12] doesn't go anywhere
[1:14:14] so when she hears me say sails up no
[1:14:17] wind she knows I'm in trouble
[1:14:20] you can take the Helm of that ship and
[1:14:22] you can keep turning it back and forth
[1:14:26] you can tighten the sail a little tight
[1:14:28] there's no wind you're not going
[1:14:29] anywhere
[1:14:31] because God knows just which portion of
[1:14:34] the barrel he needs to feed for today
[1:14:37] I wish we could change that I don't wish
[1:14:39] but my Human Side would be much more
[1:14:41] comfortable if we could change that I
[1:14:43] mean I mean these some preachers have it
[1:14:45] so easy it shows up in the mail there's
[1:14:47] a date you preach this subject on that
[1:14:49] day I mean no wonder they they're part
[1:14:51] of golf leagues
[1:14:58] but when we want the food in due season
[1:15:01] we've got to be willing to take it God's
[1:15:04] provided way and God's provided way
[1:15:05] isn't always easy on the flesh
[1:15:10] that's why we all have to labor together
[1:15:12] we all have to pray we have to I have to
[1:15:15] stay consecrated you have to stay
[1:15:16] consecrated we have to pray for one
[1:15:18] another this is not coming and sitting
[1:15:20] comfortably in a comfortable seat to
[1:15:22] hear what God has put on this man's
[1:15:23] heart no it's I have to do my part and
[1:15:25] pull my part through that gift because
[1:15:27] we got to hear from God for today
[1:15:30] so we're all in this thing together amen
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:37] remember remember when Elijah was in the
[1:15:40] school of the prophets
[1:15:42] and there was a prophet that had
[1:15:44] gathered wild gourds
[1:15:46] he took the wild gourds and he threw it
[1:15:48] in a pot they were going to all have a
[1:15:49] meal together and they began to dip out
[1:15:52] of the pot and they say no there's death
[1:15:53] in the pot
[1:15:55] and Elijah said this is in Second Kings
[1:15:57] Four Elisha I mean second Kings 4 and
[1:15:59] this is verse 41 but he said then bring
[1:16:02] meal
[1:16:03] meal is always a type of Christ
[1:16:06] bring meal and he cast it into the pot
[1:16:09] and he said pour out for the people and
[1:16:11] they may eat and there was no harm in
[1:16:14] the pot
[1:16:15] what did he do he put Christ he injected
[1:16:18] Christ into the ponds
[1:16:22] so
[1:16:24] this is what brother Branham says in
[1:16:25] God's chosen place of worship from 1965
[1:16:28] he's referring to that same scripture
[1:16:29] said Elijah said bring me a handful of
[1:16:31] meal and he took the meal and threw it
[1:16:33] in the pot and said eat the pot is
[1:16:34] healed and the meal offering was Christ
[1:16:37] every Burr had to be set the same in
[1:16:40] every little piece of meal had to be
[1:16:41] ground the same for the meal offering
[1:16:43] showing that he is the Healer he
[1:16:45] substitutes and takes away death and
[1:16:46] puts Life by those two laws Hallelujah
[1:16:48] where death is one place when Christ
[1:16:51] comes in life comes in
[1:16:53] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:16:55] forever and where there was death there
[1:16:57] became life because that Christ was
[1:16:59] brought in the meal offering
[1:17:02] listen that that man the school of the
[1:17:04] prophets is the school of the preachers
[1:17:06] and that man was doing the best he could
[1:17:10] is that right he was out gathered he
[1:17:13] wasn't trying to poison the people
[1:17:16] but according to the best of his
[1:17:18] understanding he was gathering what he
[1:17:20] thought would be good for the people
[1:17:22] listen I feel sorry I I feel sorry for
[1:17:26] pastors who don't have the message
[1:17:29] we were on vacation one time and we
[1:17:31] started attending a Baptist Church and I
[1:17:33] went there every time the doors were
[1:17:35] open that week we were on vacation
[1:17:37] and the reason is I went to that first
[1:17:38] service just because I wanted our family
[1:17:40] to be in church and I thought it'd be a
[1:17:41] good experience for the family but I
[1:17:44] became so burdened for The Man Behind
[1:17:46] the pulpit because I could see he was
[1:17:48] sincere and he was honest hearted and he
[1:17:50] had nothing to feed his sheep
[1:17:53] and there was not a critical bone in my
[1:17:55] body but my heart was broke for him I
[1:17:57] grieved and I went there every service
[1:17:58] and later I wrote him a letter tell him
[1:18:00] I appreciated having a place to go on
[1:18:02] vacation and I appreciated all that he
[1:18:04] did and I sent him a seven Church ages
[1:18:06] book
[1:18:08] I never heard back I don't know what
[1:18:10] happened from that but but I realized he
[1:18:13] wanted he didn't want to poison his
[1:18:15] people he didn't want to feed boys and
[1:18:17] girls he he was gathering the best that
[1:18:20] he knew how intellectually he was using
[1:18:22] the best mind he had like this man from
[1:18:24] the school of prophets but behold when
[1:18:26] it was all cooked together there was
[1:18:27] death in the pod
[1:18:29] but oh in the Elijah ministry under
[1:18:32] Elisha now when he said bring me meal
[1:18:34] let's just put Christ into this and when
[1:18:37] you put Christ into this it'll heal the
[1:18:39] pots
[1:18:41] amen that's why we want the word the
[1:18:44] word the word we want the revelation of
[1:18:46] the word for this hour that is Christ
[1:18:51] amen that's what brother Brown says in
[1:18:53] three kinds of Believers says he that
[1:18:55] receiveth my words and believeth on him
[1:18:57] that sent me has already passed from
[1:18:59] Death To Life
[1:19:00] but can you receive the word first can
[1:19:02] you receive the word all of the word all
[1:19:04] of Christ Christ is the anointed word he
[1:19:07] is the word anointed
[1:19:09] Christ means the anointed one the
[1:19:12] anointed word for that day
[1:19:15] amen that's why it can't be left over
[1:19:18] Christ there has to be fresh Christ
[1:19:21] fresh word
[1:19:23] amen
[1:19:26] brother Ben he gets to questions and
[1:19:28] answers
[1:19:29] on the seals this is preaching Sunday
[1:19:31] morning now remember he was told to
[1:19:34] store up the food
[1:19:36] they told us a crisis the mystery of God
[1:19:37] revealed it's stored up for it will be
[1:19:39] needed later
[1:19:41] then he comes here to questions and
[1:19:43] answers on the seals and he says and
[1:19:44] then also know that right among you
[1:19:46] things are happening
[1:19:48] I know that you don't see it
[1:19:51] I'm just positive that you don't see it
[1:19:55] you say brother bear that's a hard thing
[1:19:56] for you to say I know it is but look let
[1:19:59] me just say this now I suppose this is
[1:20:01] just tapes for ourselves and so forth
[1:20:02] but let me say this that you don't you
[1:20:05] don't get it and you're not supposed to
[1:20:08] get it
[1:20:10] in other words I'm storing this on tape
[1:20:14] it'll be needed later
[1:20:18] so don't try to interpret anything see
[1:20:20] don't try to put your interpretation to
[1:20:22] it you only get further away now he
[1:20:24] gives them some instructions he's
[1:20:26] telling them don't try to figure it out
[1:20:28] it's not for you to figure out now amen
[1:20:30] but there's this Revelation is going to
[1:20:32] continually open amen the food's going
[1:20:34] to come out of the storehouse it's not
[1:20:36] for you now but I gotta put it on tape
[1:20:40] he said just take my advice if you
[1:20:43] believe me now if God has given me favor
[1:20:45] in your sight and you know that them
[1:20:47] Revelations and things I've been here
[1:20:49] with you a long time and it's always
[1:20:50] been right
[1:20:51] and now to double prove it it hooks
[1:20:53] right in with the word see so you know
[1:20:55] it's thus saith the Lord that's exactly
[1:20:58] it's proven to you now take my advice as
[1:21:01] your brother don't put your own
[1:21:02] interpretation to anything you just go
[1:21:04] and live a good Christian life because
[1:21:07] you'll only wind yourself away from the
[1:21:09] real thing when you do it you only wind
[1:21:11] your way away again away from that thing
[1:21:14] and all of you are conscious and know
[1:21:16] that there's something mysterious
[1:21:17] happening and it's happening and I know
[1:21:19] what it is
[1:21:21] brother Madam was looking at it he knew
[1:21:23] what was unfolding he knew what was
[1:21:25] transpiring in his day but then all
[1:21:27] through the seals brother but I'm saying
[1:21:28] I hope you're getting it
[1:21:31] I hope you're seeing what's happening
[1:21:33] it's all around you
[1:21:35] he's saying this to through the seals
[1:21:37] he's saying I hope I don't have to just
[1:21:39] take it out in my hand and show it to
[1:21:41] you
[1:21:42] then he comes to Sunday the last days
[1:21:45] preaching the seals and here he is
[1:21:46] Sunday morning with questions and
[1:21:47] answers and he says now I know you're
[1:21:49] not getting it you don't see it
[1:21:52] and even before when he was telling
[1:21:54] people to turn their questions in he
[1:21:55] goes I'm just waiting for a certain
[1:21:57] question I'm waiting to see if people
[1:21:58] are catching it or not
[1:22:00] but then when he comes to questions and
[1:22:02] answers he says I know you're not
[1:22:03] getting it you're not supposed to get it
[1:22:06] so you all here in this day you just
[1:22:09] live a simple Christian humble life
[1:22:11] don't add no interpretation you'll go
[1:22:13] further away there's no way for you to
[1:22:15] get it at all
[1:22:17] but that doesn't still apply today
[1:22:20] friends to you and I
[1:22:24] amen
[1:22:25] that food was stored up for a future day
[1:22:28] what future day
[1:22:30] one day I mean is there still coming
[1:22:32] today there's more in there to come out
[1:22:34] I'm sure of that amen there'll be more
[1:22:36] coming out all the way to the change of
[1:22:38] our bodies but I don't believe this is
[1:22:40] the day when we say I have no idea what
[1:22:42] the seals are about I have no idea what
[1:22:44] brother Ben was talking about all I want
[1:22:46] to do is live a simple Christian humble
[1:22:48] life no he's been pouring out meal for
[1:22:50] 60 years day by day amen he's been
[1:22:53] unfolding the mystery bit by bit and
[1:22:55] it's been delicious and tasty and giving
[1:22:57] us strength and we've been maturing now
[1:22:59] we're what would have made them sick 60
[1:23:01] years ago amen there's a maturity there
[1:23:04] should be a maturity coming to the bride
[1:23:06] that can stomach the things that he was
[1:23:08] looking at
[1:23:10] that can stomach what he stored up on
[1:23:12] tape amen because it was it was enough
[1:23:14] Revelation to choke even a Son of God in
[1:23:17] that day amen but there's been a
[1:23:19] maturing process those things shouldn't
[1:23:21] choke us anymore statements like it's
[1:23:24] Christ coming in flesh My Flesh your
[1:23:26] flesh
[1:23:29] praise be to God
[1:23:32] everybody stored it up for a future day
[1:23:34] amen I don't want I don't want to keep
[1:23:37] the cap on what he's opened amen I don't
[1:23:40] want to be afraid to eat the portion of
[1:23:42] Christ for my day
[1:23:45] that's the part that's here to give me
[1:23:46] strength
[1:23:48] let's go to Colossians chapter one
[1:23:59] Colossians chapter 1.
[1:24:04] verse 9.
[1:24:10] for this cause we also since the day
[1:24:12] that we heard it do not cease to pray
[1:24:14] for you and to desire that you might be
[1:24:16] filled with the knowledge of his will
[1:24:18] and all wisdom and spiritual
[1:24:19] understanding
[1:24:21] I think this is so important for us to
[1:24:23] realize
[1:24:24] that Paul never said it doesn't matter
[1:24:28] you don't need to understand
[1:24:34] Paul wanted them to grow
[1:24:39] first they had to believe then they had
[1:24:41] to grow
[1:24:44] he said with let me let me read this
[1:24:47] again and to desire that you might be
[1:24:48] filled with the knowledge of his will
[1:24:50] and all wisdom and spiritual
[1:24:51] understanding that you might walk worthy
[1:24:54] of the Lord unto all pleasing being
[1:24:56] fruitful in every good work and increase
[1:24:58] and increase in the knowledge of God
[1:25:01] he wanted them to grow in their
[1:25:05] understanding and he wanted to increase
[1:25:07] in their knowledge of God
[1:25:10] I think that still applies today that's
[1:25:12] why we keep reading the same Bible over
[1:25:14] and over and over and over again not so
[1:25:17] that I don't get anything out of it so
[1:25:18] that I increase in the knowledge of God
[1:25:20] so that as God unfolds bit by bit to me
[1:25:23] every new peace is bringing me into a
[1:25:26] clearer understanding of God
[1:25:28] this is what Paul wanted if we go to
[1:25:30] Peter let's go to First Peter chapter 3.
[1:25:34] First Peter chapter 3
[1:25:36] verse 18.
[1:25:55] I have the wrong scripture reference
[1:25:58] well I'll read what I have but I don't
[1:26:00] know where to find it in my Bible but he
[1:26:02] says but grow in Grace and in the
[1:26:05] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:26:07] Christ to him be glory both now and
[1:26:09] forever so Peter is telling them to grow
[1:26:12] in Grace and in the knowledge of our
[1:26:15] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:26:18] we're supposed to grow in these things
[1:26:20] how do you grow unless you feed amen how
[1:26:23] are you going to feed unless God is
[1:26:24] constantly opening in a more portion
[1:26:26] more portions of himself
[1:26:28] brother Branham says in questions and
[1:26:29] answers from 1964 he said First
[1:26:31] Corinthians 13 says this when that which
[1:26:34] is perfect has come then that which is
[1:26:35] in part shall be done away with so all
[1:26:37] these little things of jumping up and
[1:26:39] down like a kid and trying to talk in
[1:26:40] tongues and all these other things when
[1:26:42] that which is perfect and we do have
[1:26:44] today by God's help the perfect
[1:26:46] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:26:49] vindication
[1:26:51] then that which is in part is done away
[1:26:53] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[1:26:56] understood as a child but when I became
[1:26:57] a man I put away childish things brother
[1:27:00] Brandon was clear he says what we do
[1:27:01] have today by God's grace is the perfect
[1:27:04] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:27:05] Vindication but I'll tell you what we
[1:27:08] didn't have in that day was perfect
[1:27:10] understanding of the perfect word
[1:27:13] is that fair to say
[1:27:16] that's why we grow in Grace in the
[1:27:18] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:20] that's why we keep feeding on the
[1:27:22] message that's why we keep feeding in
[1:27:24] the Bible that's why we keep coming back
[1:27:26] and feeding amen and going over some of
[1:27:28] the same subjects some of the same
[1:27:29] teaching some of the same things because
[1:27:31] we have to grow because it's getting
[1:27:33] it's food for our day it gets stronger
[1:27:36] and stronger and stronger to bring us
[1:27:37] into greater maturity
[1:27:40] let's go to first Thessalonians chapter
[1:27:42] 3.
[1:27:44] and hopefully I wrote down the right
[1:27:45] reference
[1:27:47] we'll see
[1:27:49] first Thessalonians
[1:27:53] chapter 3.
[1:27:58] verse 9.
[1:28:00] for what things can we render to God
[1:28:02] again for you for all the joy we're with
[1:28:04] we joy for your sakes before our God
[1:28:06] night and day praying exceedingly that
[1:28:08] we might see your face and might perfect
[1:28:11] that which is lacking in your faith
[1:28:15] the Apostle Paul wanted to come and
[1:28:17] visit them
[1:28:19] so that he could perfect what was
[1:28:21] lacking in their faith
[1:28:24] is it when they saw Paul that they would
[1:28:27] have perfect faith what was Paul wanting
[1:28:29] to do when he saw their faith he was
[1:28:31] wanting to teach them more word
[1:28:34] and more word would bring more perfect
[1:28:36] faith
[1:28:38] because Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:28:40] hearing by the word
[1:28:42] so Paul is saying you're not fine where
[1:28:45] you are amen you're good but I want to
[1:28:47] come that I might perfect what's lacking
[1:28:49] in your faith
[1:28:52] praise God so what do we need friends we
[1:28:55] need more word amen we need more of the
[1:28:57] spiritual food that has been saved for
[1:28:59] this season
[1:29:00] where do I find it it's in the message
[1:29:02] how do I get it amen stay in the channel
[1:29:05] that God gave you feed on the message
[1:29:07] listen to the voice of the Prophet read
[1:29:09] the book stay in your Bible and come to
[1:29:12] church under the preaching of the
[1:29:14] fivefold ministry stay in your place
[1:29:16] because he said I will feed you there
[1:29:20] and receive God's way what's he doing
[1:29:22] he's he's opening up more of the stored
[1:29:25] food and more of the stored food and
[1:29:27] that's why it's so good
[1:29:30] because it's food and due season
[1:29:33] amen
[1:29:35] in the first seal brother Graham says
[1:29:38] but think now he wrote this but when he
[1:29:40] started to write these other seven
[1:29:42] Thunders he said don't write it
[1:29:44] he'd been commissioned he's talking
[1:29:46] about John to write everything he'd seen
[1:29:47] But when these seven Thunders over in
[1:29:49] Revelation 10 uttered he said don't
[1:29:50] write them at all they're mysterious we
[1:29:53] don't know what they are yet but in my
[1:29:55] opinion they'll be revealed right away
[1:29:57] and when it do it'll give faith for that
[1:30:00] Rapture and Grace for the church to move
[1:30:01] out
[1:30:02] what will the seven Thunders do it'll
[1:30:05] help perfect what's lacking in our faith
[1:30:08] that's what Paul wanted to give to the
[1:30:11] Thessalonians he wanted to come and
[1:30:12] teach them more to perfect what was
[1:30:14] lacking in their faith oh if I need more
[1:30:17] faith what do I need I need more word
[1:30:19] amen I need more of Christ
[1:30:22] where am I going to get it don't run all
[1:30:24] over the place stay in the message stay
[1:30:27] in the channel I will feed you there if
[1:30:29] you know your place you know the church
[1:30:31] you belong to you know the minister you
[1:30:33] said under you know the message of the
[1:30:35] hour you feed on the tapes you know your
[1:30:37] Bible I will feed you there you're not
[1:30:40] going to miss a thing if you stay in
[1:30:42] God's appointed place
[1:30:44] he'll keep feeding every day I'll bring
[1:30:47] more
[1:30:48] don't have to worry about it running out
[1:30:50] don't have to worry about starving to
[1:30:51] death in God's place
[1:30:55] what if God wants me to move he'll let
[1:30:57] the brook dry out
[1:30:59] something he'll do something to
[1:31:01] reposition you
[1:31:03] but until he does stay where he placed
[1:31:05] you
[1:31:06] have faith in God this message amen this
[1:31:11] message is Christ
[1:31:13] same yesterday today and forever it is
[1:31:16] the spiritual food in due season
[1:31:20] in the message the rising of the sun he
[1:31:22] says we shall rise in him we become part
[1:31:25] of him the Easter
[1:31:26] the revealed Secret Of God like it was
[1:31:28] then of life after death we are now
[1:31:30] alive we who are Once Dead in sins and
[1:31:33] trespasses he's talking about your
[1:31:35] Easter talk about your Resurrection
[1:31:37] coming out of dead denominationalism
[1:31:39] dead things of the world and coming into
[1:31:41] life in Christ Jesus
[1:31:43] you who were once dead in sin and
[1:31:45] trespasses the true Easter seal has
[1:31:47] broke death from around me and I'm alive
[1:31:52] the Easter seal at the beginning broke
[1:31:54] the Seal of the Roman seal the Easter
[1:31:56] seal that was see that he was sealed up
[1:31:58] and man when they died was gone but he
[1:32:00] broke the seal and revealed the secret
[1:32:03] and now God by his holy spirit has broke
[1:32:06] the seal from around our lives
[1:32:11] this is what he says next do you believe
[1:32:12] the seal has been broke from around your
[1:32:14] life
[1:32:15] by the word
[1:32:17] he has broke the seal from around our
[1:32:19] lives and Christ is revealed as he lives
[1:32:23] in US
[1:32:25] what happened when the seal was broke
[1:32:26] around your life Christ was revealed
[1:32:29] where was Christ revealed as he lives in
[1:32:31] US
[1:32:32] the revealing of you was the revealing
[1:32:34] of Christ working in you
[1:32:38] that was a mouthful a long time ago but
[1:32:40] that's food and due season today
[1:32:45] amen
[1:32:47] I want to read this last statement this
[1:32:49] last quote
[1:32:50] from the anointed ones at the end time
[1:32:52] he says the son of man is Christ he is
[1:32:54] the one that you're feeding on
[1:32:56] you're not feeding on a man a man his
[1:32:58] words will fail but you're feeding on
[1:33:00] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:33:03] man
[1:33:04] unfailing
[1:33:07] it's not going to run out
[1:33:09] before you're changing the body the
[1:33:12] unfailing body word of the son of man if
[1:33:15] you haven't fed fully on every word to
[1:33:17] give yourself strength to Fly Above All
[1:33:19] these denominations and things of the
[1:33:21] world will you at this time do it while
[1:33:24] we pray
[1:33:26] if you haven't taken your meal
[1:33:30] and turned it over to Elijah
[1:33:34] would you do so now yes
[1:33:36] we have it just forsaken all of our
[1:33:39] ideas and recognize our ideas is death
[1:33:41] in the pot
[1:33:43] our best effort is death in the pot but
[1:33:47] the only thing that will cure the death
[1:33:48] and the pot of our thinking is the mind
[1:33:50] of Christ coming in the meal has to come
[1:33:52] in and heal the pot
[1:33:56] where do I find it it's the message of
[1:33:58] the hour it's the word that has been
[1:34:00] given to us it's Christ in due season
[1:34:04] I say thank God
[1:34:06] for his word let's all stand musicians
[1:34:08] if you please come
[1:34:18] you know there's there's many things in
[1:34:22] this world
[1:34:23] that will feed our spirit
[1:34:25] but there's only one thing that will
[1:34:27] feed our soul
[1:34:28] and that's the bread of life that's
[1:34:30] Christ the bread of life that's every
[1:34:33] word that cometh out of the mouth of God
[1:34:35] is what we're feeding on
[1:34:36] and we need to be careful
[1:34:38] that we don't feed the spirit
[1:34:41] that's the carnal man
[1:34:42] there's every kind of entertainment
[1:34:44] distraction news feed there's there's
[1:34:47] everything around us wants to feed our
[1:34:50] spirit but remember you have a carnal
[1:34:52] Spirit of the world
[1:34:54] that's the black dog starve that thing
[1:34:58] starve that thing where's the white dog
[1:35:00] that's my soul
[1:35:01] what do I what do I feed it it will only
[1:35:04] feed on the word of God
[1:35:07] so if I want to overcome this day I have
[1:35:10] to stop spending so much time feeding
[1:35:12] the spirit and I need to feed my soul
[1:35:16] and praise God God has given us a
[1:35:18] storehouse full of food to feed the soul
[1:35:22] it's not like we have to look far amen
[1:35:24] we carry it around in our pockets it's
[1:35:26] it's everywhere we drive it's available
[1:35:28] all the time we can be feeding our soul
[1:35:31] all the time
[1:35:34] and if we want to have victory in this
[1:35:35] day when it's so easy to feed the spirit
[1:35:38] I say we need to be diligent to feed the
[1:35:41] soul
[1:35:41] so that we can overcome and Fly Above
[1:35:45] these denominations and all these things
[1:35:48] of the world
[1:35:49] how am I going to do it when I get
[1:35:51] strong by the word
[1:35:54] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[1:35:57] dear Lord Jesus we thank you
[1:35:59] we thank you Father that you've provided
[1:36:02] food in due season
[1:36:04] God in the time of famine you have not
[1:36:07] left your children without
[1:36:09] but oh God you're only asking us to obey
[1:36:12] your voice
[1:36:13] to show that we trust you to show that
[1:36:15] we believe you

[1:36:20] my little portion
[1:36:23] my little meal I want to give it away to
[1:36:25] you
[1:36:26] so that I can have your portion
[1:36:29] the sustaining unfailing body word of
[1:36:31] the son of man
[1:36:33] God I pray that you would taken
[1:36:36] throw your meal into our pots
[1:36:40] and heal it Lord
[1:36:42] we all have our own ideas we all have
[1:36:44] our own feeling about things
[1:36:47] but God that's just death in the pot

[1:36:52] ideas our own gatherings
