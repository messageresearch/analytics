you do take a five-year-old kid he looks at his father my father is invincible my father is Almighty my father has the brains of the world my dad can do anything because he's my father well my father As I Grew Older I found out actually my dad was limited a little bit here and there okay but my real father God he has no limitations saying bothering me hey Dad can you do something with this guy I'm getting tired of him bothering me all the time he just gave me a Thousand Angels to do just come on you know just give me those and we'll take care of this I'm making it funny but I'm using it to make a point we have access to everything God is we have brother Branham said that God will God will bankrupt Heaven before he'll let one of his promises fall so why don't we access him why don't we treat him like he is our father why don't we love him the way that he desires for us to love him when somebody ask Jesus Christ is what's the greatest of The Commandments is to love God with everything that's within you and then love your neighbor the same way you love yourself and these two Commandments the rest all of us all the laws and all the prophets and if we can begin to hon if we could begin to believe in that God you know God came down on Mount Sinai lightning thundering earthquakes Moses told the people God delivered you from Egypt because he loves you but they suck back in fear oh wow they look at this thing what are we going to do now if I walk in there God's going to smite me or I'll just be his greasy spot when really if they realize that God loved them enough to deliver them from Egypt that God is the one that's applied all their needs as they wander through their Wilderness that God promised to give you the promised land that God has promised to deliver you and take care of you and supply all of your needs that God has promised to heal you who can stand before that that's my God okay manifest yourself a little bit more let's take care of this mess out here because he's my father if all of a sudden somebody was beating if somebody was bothering me my dad would come to my rescue if somebody was messing with my wife I would die trying to take you know making sure that Sushi stayed safe well I'm his bride he loves me I don't know why but he does but here again what's he going to do he's going to protect me he's going to supply for me he's going to watch over me he's going to make sure that everything goes as good as it possibly can because he not only is my father he's also my the bridegroom
