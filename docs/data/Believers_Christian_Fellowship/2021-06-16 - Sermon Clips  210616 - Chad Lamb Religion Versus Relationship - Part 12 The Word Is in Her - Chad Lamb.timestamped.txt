[0:00] sarah was the one who talked to abraham
[0:03] the first time
[0:04] and told him this is how we're going to
[0:06] bring about the word
[0:07] god has he's shut me off from bearing
[0:10] children it's not possible for me
[0:12] and now we're going to take my handmaid
[0:14] and you go into my handmaid and she'll
[0:16] raise up seed for us
[0:17] it was sarah's idea it was sarah's
[0:19] thought
[0:20] it was sarah's way of intellectually
[0:23] bringing the word to pass
[0:26] and it brought corruption amen it
[0:28] brought a hybrid product
[0:30] it brought a corrupt product amen and so
[0:33] she
[0:33] spoke when she spoke according to her
[0:35] own wisdom according to her own
[0:37] understanding
[0:38] according to what her eyes could see and
[0:40] what she could understand
[0:41] it brought forth an ishmael but now
[0:43] something has changed and sarah
[0:46] sarah has now come in contact with god
[0:49] the lord has visited her amen the
[0:51] mystery has been revealed to her
[0:53] and now she has conceived the word
[0:58] and her whole understanding has changed
[1:00] amen everything that she thought was
[1:02] logical and reasonable and made sense
[1:04] before
[1:05] now she saw the failure of it all
[1:08] because she had come and the lord had
[1:11] visited her and she conceived on the
[1:12] word and now she's brought forth the
[1:14] word
[1:15] now her eyes are open her understanding
[1:17] has changed
[1:18] everything about her is different now
[1:21] and now she knows that these two
[1:23] can't dwell together anymore
[1:27] and that's where god is bringing his
[1:28] bride to you amen that she's got a
[1:30] visitation from the lord
[1:32] amen son the word has been quickened
[1:34] inside of this bride
[1:35] and now she knows that what we used to
[1:38] think was okay
[1:39] what we used to the way we used to try
[1:41] to serve god the way we used to try to
[1:43] fulfill his word the way we used to
[1:45] think was right
[1:46] amen it's not right and it won't work
[1:48] and now cast out this bondwoman
[1:52] and when you come in contact with the
[1:54] lord when you come in contact with the
[1:55] seventh seal
[1:56] and the seventh seal mystery is unlocked
[1:58] in your life and you conceive on the
[2:00] word and the word comes into you
[2:02] everything in your understanding changes
[2:05] amen now you realize
[2:06] why it was a failure why it wouldn't
[2:09] work why denominations will never
[2:11] fulfill the word of god
[2:12] why human reasoning and wisdom and
[2:14] intellect will never be god's way
[2:16] now all of a sudden you understand why
