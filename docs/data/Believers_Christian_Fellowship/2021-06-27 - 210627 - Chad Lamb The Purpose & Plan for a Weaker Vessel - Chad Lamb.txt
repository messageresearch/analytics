us today in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you friends while we're standing if you could turn to first peter chapter 3. amen it's good to be here i was talking to somebody and said i haven't preached two services in a row here and so now i'm nervous again i'm always a little nervous but it's amazing how you get out of just a little bit you just get out of it a little bit and then you get all nervous again you ask god please lord you're in the back saying what am i doing why am i here praise god you'd have to be a preacher to know what that's like but i just want to say it's a privilege i'm so glad to be back and when i think about being back here just the fellowship around the world it makes me excited amen and i just appreciate everybody being here i want to look at first peter chapter 3 verse 7 and we'll just read this one portion of scripture and we'll let you have your seats likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered you can have your seats we ask the lord to bless the reading of his word amen i i wanted to take for a subject today out of this scripture the purpose and plan for a weaker vessel the purpose and plan for a weaker vessel drawing that context out of this text and i have to do some explaining to you this is something that last sunday when uh i preached down in north carolina for brother steven shimba we went back to one of the brethren's house there and we were visiting there with some of the a minister and brother stephen and a couple of the deacons and another brother when we were sitting around the table we were just fellowshipping back and forth and we had a wonderful time i think we sat and visited for i think it was close to five hours and it was just word word word word and that's the fellowship we love but brother stephen shared something he had just preached with me and it was along these lines and boy when he shared that it just clicked in me and it something just began to open up many things that we've preached around before but it opened up so i i'm stealing a sermon that's my confession today and uh i tried hard not to preach this i thought i've got something else in my heart i want to preach this and i couldn't get away from this i just have to share it with you and so if you'll just forgive me for doing that but we all plagiarize every sermon we ever preach it comes from the bible comes from the message or from fellowship or something somebody else said and so he we had some tremendous fellowship and just to be fair i started sharing with him something i preached about two years ago and he said brother i've got notes on my desk i'm getting ready to preach that so it's all fair amen it's all fair but that's what it is nobody has a corner on this we need one another and we all are looking at this mountain and observing what god is doing and we're all catching things and we're feeding from one another so i fed i mean i drew deep from that well and this is this is something open to me and i hope it blesses you the way it did in me i'll never be able to preach it the way he did neither will he preach the notes that's in his death the way i did but god will still bring his word to his children the sheep will still get the sheep food so the purpose and plan for a weaker vessel we read this scripture and this scripture has caused a lot of tension in the past because of misuses and misunderstandings unfortunately but that's the way most of the scriptures went through that kind of trial been manhandled and misused and misunderstood and fought against from two polarizing positions but nonetheless it's the truth amen and the word of god is written the way it's written for a reason and so there's an admonition that peter is giving to husbands he said husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor to the wife is unto the weaker vessel so we understand that the wife or the woman is the weaker vessel and i hope you know we live in that laodicea and then this age is so corrupted what feminism really is the femininity of a woman and motherhood and and womanhood and masculinity and it's twisted it all up and i just want to throw all those ideas out the window and come back to the word and i hope by the end of this message that everybody will see the value in the weaker vessel and say praise god for a weaker vessel i just want to at the beginning of the onset i just want to make note that it says to the husbands when he's when he's giving them instructions he said dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor this word honor means value or price so what what peter is not saying as you know you're going to have to understand she's not very good and you're just going to have to deal with it that's not what this scripture is saying it's saying dwell with them according knowledge giving honor or placing value because she's the weaker vessel so there's a value in the weaker vessel and i think that's what we want to look at as we move on let's go to genesis chapter 2 and i probably was no surprise to you that we'd wind up in genesis at some point genesis chapter 2 verse 16. genesis 2 16 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that you eat us thereof thou shalt surely die and the lord god said it is not good that man shall be alone i will make him a help meet for him and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and and adam gave names to all cattle into the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found a help meet for him i want you to notice here right off the right from the beginning that every creature that god was bringing before adam was made the same way adam was made for god for god formed man out of the dust of the earth amen and he breathed into his nostril the breath of life and so we know now that every one of these animals now that god is he's he's saying it's not good that man shall dwell alone i shall find a help meat for him so god now is creating and is an original style of creation he's bringing out of the dust of the earth and he's giving the breath of life and he's presenting them to adam and there's not finding a suitable help me but they're all coming according to the original fashion of creation i want you to catch that in verse 21 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam so now god is going to do something different than what he's done before this is something new something different this is not according to the original fashion of creation and the glory god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto him unto his wife and they shall be one flesh so now we know this scripture so well but when god went to fashion the woman he does it not in his traditional style of creation he's doing it in a different fashion a different form of creating he's doing something different because every time he's been creating he's been bringing out of the dust of the of the ground forming giving the breath of life then they're moving on as creatures and that was god's original way that's the way that he made man that's the way he made adam amen but but now he's taking something from that original creation and making another creation off the original creation and this is the first time he does that and whenever we see things in the scripture like this you always have to put the question mark why did he do it that way we have so much understanding we know that adam's wife was within him amen that he was made male and female that the woman the counterpart that he was looking for was already in him had to be taken out of him couldn't be something different than him had to be the same thing as he is so it was taken out of him formed into another vessel and brought back and the two were won so we know that part of the story but yet god still he has made this woman this help me for adam and he fashioned her differently than he did the rest of his creation now brother branham has quite a bit to say about this and i want to pick up the quote in marriage and divorce he says remember adam was both masculine and feminist in the original creation one but then he was separated by a rib notice by a byproduct and notice the only one of all god's creation all of every animal and anything else she was the only she was only one designed this way every other female was in the original creation catch this brother branham's he he's drawing attention to this difference in the scripture he was not in the original creation she that had to be made that way will get to it after a while notice in this creation that she was in not in the original but a byproduct in this creation now i don't want to hurt your feelings but i want to tell you the truth and you just sit still you're doing nice you guys are doing nice there is nothing designed to be so deceitful as a woman that's deceitful there cannot be nothing else there's nothing made to be that way also there is nothing that can be so easily deceived as a woman now the fall proves this statement to be true the fall in the beginning she was not in the original beginning creation she was an adam but not in a female sex herself at the beginning she was the byproduct made death burial resurrection whoa no no no no hold on just a minute just sit real still you're doing real nice every once in a while this program splices two pages together and i'm not gonna have that happen all right now i'm gonna finish this quote and then i'm moving to the next chord it cut off the top of it she was not in the original beginning creation she was an adam but not in a female sex herself at the beginning she was the byproduct made now we want to go down further in marriage and divorce we're skipping several paragraphs and coming down so now watch his great program unfold as we go on through here now just as perfect as perfect can be i didn't know this till the other day so this is something brother branham's catching why didn't he make her like that in the beginning like the rest of his females because it would be unbecoming to him he is the fountain of all purity that's the reason he had to let satan get a hold of her what he'd done in the perversion such a creature would be would not be becoming to him originally designed for so brother branham is telling us he's going to go on to share this and make this clear he said the woman was created differently than the rest of creation and the reason she was created differently is so that she could be deceived and so that she could fall and it wasn't becoming to god to make the original creation that way because that stepped from his original method of creation so what he did is he made it differently and when he made it differently he took from the original creation and made a byproduct brother ben said or took a portion and made something else off the original and when god made something else off the original what he did is he he he created in such a way that there could be a door open to sin god didn't make her sinful god didn't make her wrong he made her perfect but there was laying a door that could be opened god didn't make the door open he just made her with a door that could be opened and she was put under free moral agency to make her choice whether she opened this door or not right because god had a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world and if there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world then god already in his mind understood that there would be a fall but it would be unbecoming to him to let his original creation be perverted amen so he made a way that his plan could come to fruition and still amen his creation could still be pure so what he did is he took off the original he pulled something out of the original and made another vessel with a door that could be opened this is why she's called the weaker vessel that's the reason he had to let satan get a hold of her what he'd done in the perversion such a creature would would not be becoming to him originally designed for all his works that he designed in the original is in continuity all of his original works was in continuity the female dog male dog female cow mount male cow everything in continuity all nature's in continuity seed die go in the ground just like death burial resurrection the the sap goes down out of the tree drops its leaf comes back the next year with the resurrection of a new leaf see what i mean everything even nature of god is all in continuity in one and here is one designed out of the continuity of god when he made a male dog he made a female dog he made the female dog the same way he made the male dog he made the male cow he made the female cow the same way he made the male cow but when he made man he made man in his own image male and female when he pulled out of the man the female he made the female differently than he made the male 1 the difference is what matters friends the difference is what there's there's something drawing our attention and brother branham when he gets to marriage and divorce he said i didn't see this till the other day he's recognizing why she was made thus now let's let's go on and keep reading he said now everything's in continuity the sap goes down out of the tree drops his leaf comes back the next year with resurrection of a new leaf see what i mean everything even nature of god is all in continuity in one and here is one designed out of the continuity of god nature is so designed so it can't sin think the original creation of god could not sin so you have to understand god if there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world there had to be a door somewhere that could be opened to let satan in to bring the deception adam was not deceived adam was the original creation he could not be deceived but the byproduct off of adam part of himself that was fashioned another way not in the original way but in the other way now that part of adam had an open door and the devil went to the weaker vessel the one with the open door the one that was not fashioned after the original creation and began to work on that because he could not deceive adam but he could deceive the woman and the woman under deception opened the door and when she opened the door now adam was fallen because part of adam was now in a fallen condition and adam not being deceived amen he was not deceived he was not an unbeliever amen but he chose to disobey the commandment of god to go with his wife because she was already fallen and she was him so god had to open the door had god didn't open the door god had to have a door you understand that god had to have a door that could be open god couldn't open that door and remain just god couldn't make her with an open door god couldn't make her sinful but god made her with a door that she could open or she could keep closed it was her choice amen let's keep reading here he said oh don't you see it now in this view here the perversion of the church the original is the word the original is god's word amen and god's word was made flesh and dwelt among us and it was made after a spoken word fashion fashioned and a in a virgin womb god had created amen his own blood cell god had created everything that was needed it wasn't part of mary mary was only the incubator he said so god fashioned amen his word made flesh in jesus christ he fashioned his body that way and he came out and that body couldn't sin by deception or unbelief he couldn't sin by deception or unbelief but out of him was taking a byproduct and out of him came the ingredients for the church amen and that church was not fashioned in the original creation she was fashioned off of the original and it left a door it left a door in the bride of jesus christ and that door could be opened by their own choice and in the first age they begin to open the door and by the time we come to nicely we find out she's a fallen woman so brother man says now don't you see it don't you see it now the original is god's word there is no sin in god see what i mean here is a creature that come into existence by a perversion god is going to have a church but look at this perverted thing we got out here god has male and female but this woman see the very symptoms if it shows back what is god's mind he could take we could take an hour or two and break that down she made this creature for for that way he made the creature and turned her so satan could get a hold of her and he did he was still got her she had better flee to the cross like a man too notice all nature runs in continuity if he'd have had the woman in the same original creation there'd have been no sin because she couldn't have done it she couldn't have done it she is a perversion of the original creation these things brother branham saying there are very strong statements but you'll find it's absolutely the truth in the invisible union of the bride of christ he says when you see the woman a byproduct not another female like her so he's going back to the recreation and say there was no other female creation made the way she was made that's the bible she was made different than all the others said not another female like her made in that order knowing that she could be deceived god knowed if he didn't know the end from the beginning then he wasn't god if he isn't infinite he can he can't be infinite without being omniscient omnipresent knowing all things eternal so he knowed all things and he had to make that woman the man didn't have a wife the wife and the man was the same thing he had the feminist masking spirit in himself he had to separate take a byproduct after the whole creation was made no female created by god and the original creation can do a thing like that she was made thus to do it he knowed she would do it if he didn't he wasn't god but we but see listen to this paragraph but see that the attributes that's in god had to be displayed he was to be a savior and to make everything perfect the way he did it then there could be nothing lost oh don't be children be men and women we're at the end of the road brother ben said listen if god had made her the original way made everything amen it couldn't come into a perversion now the attributes of god is savor and healer and deliver it could never be expressed but there was attributes of god that had to be expressed and they were expressed in the mind of god before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain and your name was put on the book of redemption so god in order to display all of his attributes he can't he looks at all of creation amen and it's all made in the same fashion where's the open door going to be amen in the open door was in adam in his sign he was going to pull off of the original and make another creation off of the original and he had never made anything in creation this way yet and so where does the serpent go amen he goes right to that that was fashioned differently why because god had a plan of redemption and now he created amen a weaker vessel and then that weaker vessel fashioned differently than adam was in a different way than all other women she was made in a way that there was a weakness implanted in her there was a weakness implanted in her that could be expressed if she chose to express it that could be open if she chose to open it and so then you realize this is the part that just thrills my heart if you can just catch this you'll never be sorry for a weaker vessel and after this there won't be a woman in this building that's not thankful that god's fashion into the way she's fashioned because the key the key to redemption the key to the expression of god laid in the woman the woman was the key that unlocked the mystery of redemption she was the key that unlocked the attributes of god being on display because without the fall you don't know a savior you don't know a healer you don't know a deliverer there's so much of god that cannot be expressed so the key to the full expression of god was the woman she was fashioned because of the because the the the the redemption the sealing and unsealing of the book the lamb slain before the foundation of the world god as a savior god is a healer god is a deliverer it was all locked up and bound up is that true it was all locked up and bound up in order for that to be expressed there had to be a fall but god cannot make anything fallen he can't make it corrupted he can't make it fallen he can only make it with the ability to be corrupted but he can't make it corrupted so he made a byproduct not because he hated woman but she was going to become the tool in his hand and that weaker vessel would become the tool in god's hand that would unlock the mystery of redemption that's why god is going to take the very same tool to finish the mystery of redemption amen he had to have the weaker vessel the weaker vessel is attached to redemption amen so the serpent came to her the devil through the serpent and and to deceive amen so that she could unlock amen all the attributes that were in god and now god could step on the scene he could be a heavenly father he could be a redeemer he could be a healer he could be a deliverer he could be a comforter he could be all that he ever intended to be because of the weaker vessel but because god fashioned her so and god foreordained for new and for knowledge knew it would be this way he also chose the very same vessel to continue the work of redemption all the way down to the finished mark it's the weaker vessel that he's going to use the weaker vessel is attached to redemption hallelujah now husbands dwell with wives according to knowledge giving honor unto the weaker vessel because this is the vessel god is using for redemption it's not a shame to be a weaker vessel it's only a shame if you keep letting satan open the door it can be a shame but it's not a shame it can be corrupted but it doesn't have to be see satan saw an opening something that god did differently and he goes down into the serpent through the serpent he begins to subtility to begin to speak to her because the devil is always looking for weakness what's he doing in you is he looking for your strength and looking for your weakness he's always looking for weakness he's always looking for the crack the way that he can get in the way that where he can find the the way to disrupt god's plan and he began to converse with the woman until he found out that the woman wasn't so sure about the word i mean she was messing up the the words a little bit adding to just a little bit not exactly what was said but and he begins to explore this avenue and he finds there's a door here that can be open and he works on that door until the woman of her own free choice opens the door brother said god knew it would happen he couldn't make it happen and remain just he couldn't force it to happen and remain just but he knew it would happen and so that's why she was made that way let's go to genesis 33. i'm sorry i didn't have my bifocals in the right spot genesis 3. getting old is embarrassing and i've just gotten started genesis chapter 3 verse 13. if you get your bifocal sideways it erases the one and you have three and three together genesis chapter 3 verse 13 and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now god comes right back and says this very woman that you used this very woman that you used is going to bring forth the seed that will be your destruction that will bruise your head that will crush and destroy you used her because i made her in a way that she could open the door you exploited that and you used it for your own gain now you're a curse now you're no longer going to be a mighty beast and more subtle than all the beats of the field amen you're going to be cast down to the ground amen and the very the very vessel that you use to bring this fall is the very vessel that's going to bring forth the promised seed of redemption that is going to bruise your head because god is going to use the weaker vessel for redemption there's a mystery laying in the weaker vessel in the weaker vessel the mystery of the weaker vessel is the mystery of redemption let's go to isaiah 7. isaiah 7 and 14 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel this is the coming forth of that seed of the woman amen that is going to bruise his head let's go to luke chapter 1. luke chapter 1 verse 26. and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that are highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at the saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee there therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her now the weaker vessel had had opened the door that brought a fall in an opening the door and brought a fall it would start a cycle of redemption that would that would display the attributes of god the plan of god from before the foundation of the world and the desire of god to reveal himself would now be set in motion by the woman amen but in order for god to have this plan of redemption before he had a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world and when god was going to bring that lamb forth on the earth amen because god's redemption is so complete the very tool that he uses for redemption he holds steady with that tool and it was the woman who caused the fall amen now he's going to come to a woman and that woman now will bring forth the seed the seed of the woman amen that will be the smiting stone that will be the the foot that bruises his head that will be the one that brings about the the redemption price being paid and so god now is coming to the weaker vessel and look at what a weak vessel he comes to when god chose to use the weaker vessel god was not going to all of a sudden change it and make it a strong vessel when he chose a weak vessel he choked a weast vessel and so when he comes to this woman he comes to a woman that has no ability to bring forth the promised word she's known no man she has no ability to do this in fact she's a young virgin girl amen tucked out of the way of the mainstream of the culture and society that way she's tucked back in nazareth which we know the bible says can any good thing come out of nazareth she was in a weak condition and not in jerusalem not in shiloh not and she wasn't in any place that you would expect to find her she wasn't able she didn't have capacity there was nothing that she could do because god is not looking for a strong vessel for redemption he's looking for a weak vessel and when god chose the weak vessel amen the devil thought because of weakness he can manipulate it but god chose a weak vessel that he can show the strength of his redemption through weakness so when he comes to the woman he doesn't come to a high priest daughter he doesn't come to somebody in jerusalem he doesn't go to the family of nobility he goes someplace where there's no ability whatsoever to have credibility to have support to have substance to have any way to even make this a logical story to make it so unbelievable amen to make it so impossible because when god chose a weaker vessel in the back part of his mind before the foundation of the world he said the weaker vessel is going to be linked to redemption all the way through he's going to use the woman the weaker vessel to bring redemption now it's no more ashamed to be a weaker vessel when mary was there she was weak she was incapable she had nothing on her side there was no way that she could fathom in her mind the fulfillment of isaiah 7 would be by her there was it was a ridiculous idea it was a foolish concept it was a notion she may have never entertained but yet she was the one because of her inability it made her perfect for a display of redemption so now he sends an angel to her and this angel messenger comes to her and begins to say you're highly favored of god my goodness she wasn't even highly favored of the people she lived with wasn't living in a favored place in a favored city in a favorite situation she wasn't highly favored in any other way but she was highly favored by god because he had a prophecy laying there then i'm going to take a weaker vessel with no ability in a condition that's impossible and i'm going to bring forth my promised seed brother branham says in the church age book out of the tyre and church age i think by the time we're done with this us men will be like man wish i was a woman because of what god has done with the woman we've seen what the devil has done with the woman we see the perversion we see the filth we see the fallen condition we saw when he began to manipulate the weakness in the woman what it has caused amen but god is also taking that same tool that the devil thinks he has all wrapped up and he's coming in the same way because the devil doesn't understand weakness he doesn't understand humility he doesn't understand weakness he only understands brightness wisdom perfection and strength he cannot fathom weakness he doesn't understand he is always tripped up by the weakness and humility of god so go out in the weaker vessel has you know it looked oh praise god it looked like when god fashioned her this way as a byproduct seemingly like an afterthought was she an afterthought she was the thought amen she was not an afterthought she was the finishing of the masterpiece she was the completion of the masterpiece she was not an afterthought she was the part of the main thought the main thought was not a frog or a horse the main thought was a man in his own image male and female the two becoming one that's the masterpiece he was working on from the beginning when volcanoes were erupting he was thinking of his masterpiece when grass started coming up amen and the sun and a cycle began to start to the earth amen and this and the sun began to traverse across the sky he was thinking of the finishing of his masterpiece the woman was in his mind amen when there was molten lava covering the earth when it was covered now in judgment and deep covered the earth and he's going to refashion it for his eden what's he thinking of he's thinking of that masterpiece image the seventh seal himself made flesh and manifest so it looks in the bible as if she's an afterthought but she's not an afterthought she's part of the mystery thought the hidden thought because because god he has thoughts and he has hidden thoughts he has seals and he has hidden seals he has written seals and unwritten seals god had a thought in that thought amen was the that manifest himself have something in his image upon the earth and that thought come into manifestation when adam was on the earth amen and it looked as if now god has an afterthought he looks down and he sees that adam is lonely and he needs a help meeting and okay i didn't think of this before so what can i do i'll start bringing up in my original form to try to find a help me this is no afterthought this is the expression of his main thought that's why he takes so much time on it that's why he's laying it down this is god expressing what his real desire what is real thought what his real purpose is so he makes what looks like an afterthought now remember the the satan is watching all of this male and female from the dust from the dust now adam and what is he doing it's different you think the devil didn't notice the difference seemingly an afterthought oh friends god has a way of pulling the devil right into his trap he's got a way through humility and simplicity he's got a way of going down low to pull the devil in because the devil can only think high thoughts he can't think low thoughts he can only think in intellectualism he can only think in reasoning and wisdoms and in beauty and intellect he cannot think through the humility of god and god reveals his humility amen by by revelation it's the only way to catch it not by intellectualism so it looks as if there's an afterthought here an afterthought then it looks as if though god as a father he's bringing a bunch of toys or presents to adam you know here's this and and here's this and adam's shaking his head no at each one of them oh praise god it's like what is he doing this is the next one and the next one and the next one adam's giving names but no suitable help meat is found and all of a sudden it's as if god was like that didn't work what do i do next what's he doing he's sucking lucifer right in because lucifer only understands perfect and brightness and wisdom and understanding and intellect and god is pulling him right into the trap and now he takes something out of adam he's not done this before this is different nothing else he tried worked he pulls it out and he fashions a separate vessel out of the piece that come off of adam and he made a woman and now he wakes up at and he brings the two together and he performs the first marriage that was ever produced ever performed in the garden of eden and made the 2-1 and adam began to rejoice and said this is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone and then so now they begin to live their happy life in the garden and the serpent you know the serpent is always trying to disrupt god's plan because the serpent's trying to usurp his authority over god to take god's kingdom and make it for his own that's his works that's what he's doing so he's trying to penetrate to the garden of eden and he's trying to take what god made for his own pleasure and he's trying to take it unto himself and so now who knows where he probed i don't know where he probed and where he poked and where he looked and what he did but he finally come to this byproduct and he found there a weaker vessel and the devil began to exploit that weaker vessel and brought a fall so what do you think the devil thinks now god messed up he should have stuck with his original he doesn't know this is in his original mind this is an original thought it wasn't part of the original creation but it was part of the original thought and so now he now he has attached himself to the woman the devil has attached himself to the weaker vessel as the mechanism that he will use to bring his eden he's done it all through the woman he he is moved and manipulated amen and he began to use this woman for deception amen and now when you get to genesis chapter six you see the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair they took them to his wives amen it was bringing a collapse to the system of god then god would bring a judgment to free his children from them and then afterwards the serpent goes right back to work and he begins working through the women and he comes down and and he begins to work on sarah and sarah there's a prophecy now that abraham's going to have a son so he begins to work on sarah and now sarah the weaker vessel gets a concept that now we can take hagar through intellectualism through reasoning and understanding she knows that it's legal amen she can now do this and her reasoning tells her god has left off me god is he's held withheld children from me so this is the only way so through reasoning and intellect and wisdom she begins she becomes deceived by the devil to thinking this is the only way for the promise to come to pass and she takes hagar and offers it to abraham abraham accepts they bring forth an ishmael amen what was that it was the devil exploiting the weakness of the woman the children of israel when they're coming in the exodus journey amen they now come to moab to the border of moab and what was it that he used to entice the the sons of god he used the daughters of moab the beautiful enticing daughters of moab to trap them at the feast of baal pior what's he doing this this woman this weaker vessel the devil has now taken for his own tool of destruction his own tool of breaking god's word his own tool of tearing down the things of god so that he can build his own civilization he can build his own empire his own eden and he doesn't know that it's the trap that god set before the foundation of the world it looks like he's having success it looks like it's working but all i want to say is it's working perfectly according to god's plan in the thytire and church age out of the church age book brother brahm said sid let us go back to the beginning in the original physical creation as we know it today god made everything in pairs male and female there were two chickens rooster and hen there were two cattle the cow and the bull and right down the line but when it come to a man there was only one they were not a pair adam had been made in the image of god he was a son of god as a son of god he could not be tempted and fall that would be impossible so god took a byproduct of a man to cause the fall woman never stepped fresh from the hand of god as a true product of god she was produced from man and when when god caused her to be brought forth from man she was vastly different from the other females he had created she was able to be seduced no other female creation can be immoral but the human female may be touched at almost any time and that weakness in her allowed satan to seduce her by way of the serpent and has brought the woman to a very peculiar position before god and his word catch this position of the weaker vessel she is the type of all things vulgar foul and loathsome on the one hand and on the other hand she is the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy as the receptacle of the spirit and the blessings of god on the one hand she is called the who is drunk with the wine of her fornication fornications on the other she is called the bride of christ on the one hand she is called mystery babylon the abomination before god and on the other hand she is called new jerusalem our mother on the one hand she is so foul and wicked and lewd that she is summarily cast into the lake of fire as the only place for her and on the other hand she is exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of god as the only place befitting such a queen what queen the weaker vessel god's design god's plan first corinthians let's turn to first corinthians chapter one see this weaker vessel satan came in and found that there was something exploitable here he began to exploit it for his own lusts his own desires and as he exploited he continued to exploit until we we find that that when christ was smitten out of him was taking the agreements for the bride and the bride was born at pentecost but then the devil goes right back to the same thing he always goes to he goes right back to the woman he goes right back to the church and then the church amen began to flirt around the church began to take in other seed the church began to produce a hybrid product and the church became the mechanism by which he deceived the sons of god for seven church ages the same pattern the same thing is what's upheld it says in first corinthians 1 25 because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men for you see your calling brother and how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and the bastings of the world and the things which are despised hath god chosen yea things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence god decided to choose weakness to show his glory and his strength he chose the he chose nothing to bring to nothing things that are things that are not to bring to not things that are god has chosen the foolishness things to confound the wisdom god has chosen the weak to show his strength god is coming through the weaker vessel second corinthians chapter 12. second corinthians chapter 12 and verse 8 for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in distress for christ's sake for when i am weak then am i strong my strength is made perfect in weakness so god fashioned the woman the weaker vessel so that he could show his perfect strength what's the purpose of the woman what's the purpose of the weaker vessel so that god can show his strength god chose weakness he didn't make her weak because he despised her he made her weak because he had a great plan and she was the mechanism he could use to fulfill his great plan and the message the anointed ones at the end time he said now i want you to know this is sure and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today that i was trying to say that about myself being that i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but it's the will of my father that i declared to do and determined to do i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it i wasn't it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god so brother is trying to show you it's not me i have nothing to do with this i am weak and when god chose his seventh angel amen so that he could declare his voice and reveal the mystery of god when god chose a vessel he chose the weakest thing that he could choose as far as christianity is concerned he took a man from the hills of kentucky with a seventh grade education and no christian teaching no fundamental sunday school teaching no understanding of the bible he had he had no support he had no fellowship he had no financial backing he had no seminary education he had nothing going for him but god wanted a weak vessel god didn't want a strong vessel god wanted a weak vessel so he bypassed the seminaries he bypassed the denominations he bypassed those with a high school diploma he bypassed the grammar he bypassed the finances he bypassed everything till he could get one of the weakest preachers that he could find as far as earthly things go the one who had poor grammar the one who had a sawdust florida's church the one who had no denominational tithes the one who was working full time just to support the church because the church couldn't support him and god chose that weakness to display his redemption plan god chose the weaker vessel god always chooses the weaker vessel when it was time to kill goliath who did he get saul who was head and shoulders above everybody else in israel who was the mighty warrior who who was able to take them to battle and fight amen he he was the strongest of israel and the strongest of israel was afraid and was rejected but he went to a boy a shepherd boy a a small brother said a runt a runt who is a shepherd boy making a delivery for his dad who is being chastised by his older brothers for being a naughty boy who is this little runt who his brothers are after him to show him all and he brought some cheese and some bread from his dad what is he he's the weak vessel that's god going to use to deliver you today see god is taking the nothings the those that are not to bring them not the things that are this is always god's plan he all the way back in the fall before the garden you know there was a fall before the garden there was a fall in heaven and in that heaven brother bam tells us that lucifer thought that he could build a greater kingdom than michael's humble kingdom you mean in heaven michael had a humble kingdom there was something in lucifer that he thought he could do better than what he saw there was a strength a wisdom a brightness and we know that he was deceived by his own brightness but he looked at the humility and he didn't understand that god's strength is buried under humility that there was the most powerful force that you have ever reckoned with is hidden in simplicity and in humility and in weakness god chose the base things brother branham preached he said when he said remember the sermon i preached when i left this church i preached on david going out to face goliath and i went as a david facing the great goliath of denominations because god chose the weak things all the way back in the garden of eden when the devil was going to bring a deception he chose the serpent what was the serpent he was the highest order of creation next to man he was handsome he was strong and he was intelligent he couldn't get to adam so he went to the next greatest thing that he could he went to the serpent because that's all he understands he only understands beauty strength and intelligence so when he was going to bring the deception against the weaker vessel he went and found the strongest tool that he could use and he brought that too when he came in that tool the serpent to try to exploit the weakness that was in the woman and through the serpent he was able to exploit the weakness and there was a fall and they were in a fallen condition and now god comes down and he judges this condition but god is going to restore fellowship so what kind of animal does god choose to restore fellowship he chooses the weakest of the beast he takes a lamb the serpent the the devil took the serpent but god took the lamb the one that couldn't defend itself the one that was weak the one that was incapable the one that had no strength the one that needed to be led he took the very weakest of the beast satan took the greatest of the beast god took the weakest of the beasts and god is always displaying his strength and his redemption and his reconciliation through weakness so he takes the weakest of the beasts of the field he takes a lamb and he takes that lamb and sheds his blood and all the lamb has to do to be part of god's great redemption plan is surrender his life into the hand of the master and when he surrenders his life into the hand of the master now that blood becomes the blood of an innocent one shed to atone for the lost children to bring back a fellowship and to provide a covering god didn't need any strength god needed weakness and he needed a surrender and today god doesn't need a strong church god needs a weak church i'll prove that to you by what the prophet said we're always going to be strong a strong church a strong ministry a strongness a strong net that listen that's the tool that the devil use we don't want strength we want weakness we want a bunch of people who have no idea what to do next we want a bunch of people that have no concept of what's going to happen next or to get how to get ourselves out of trouble or how to solve the next problem you just want a people that'll say whatever the word says amen when it comes time god will show it out of the word i'll take the word that's my head ship that's my husband that's the leader that i follow i can't use my mind i can't use my history i can't use my training all i can use is this word i have to follow the shepherd because i'm a sheep [Music] god doesn't want us to become strong and powerful and wise and beautiful he's looking for the beauty of character you know haman had a plan and the book of esther haymon had a plan to bring the demise of israel and god was going to bring a deliverance but he wasn't going to use a priest an educated man a soldier a warrior what was going to defeat haman he was going to be defeated by a woman and how is this woman going to defeat him not with her strength not with her intelligence how is she going to defeat haman how was haman defeated haman was defeated by her humility and her subjection and her reverence he was destroyed his plan was destroyed his children was destroyed and all of his health became a spoil for esther how what great strength did she use what great gifts did she use the only thing that she used was humility and reverence and submission and through humility and reverence and submission she defeated the entire plan of haman what was haman haman was the right-hand man of the king haman was the second in power haman was so powerful so tied in with the king that he could enter into the court of the king whenever he wanted esther didn't even think she could come you recognize esther didn't even know that she could come and then she says if the scepter's not extended unto me i'll be killed but there's no record of haman ever having a scepter extended to him there's no record haman just marches right in even when the king has been up in the night and they've been reading to him out of the book of of chronicles of the king and he remembers what mordecai had done for him amen haman just marches in and starts talking to him haman is in so good the king the king takes off his ring and he hands it to haman this is who the jews are dealing with takes us off his ring and he hands it to haman and says you seal it you write it and you seal it it'll be what you say with the king's seal and that become the death sentence for the jews but god had a little orphan girl she had no mommy no daddy she had a cousin who took her to raise her in mordecai she had no money she had no wealth she had no position yet nothing in fact her name was hadassah she's just a little myrtle plant nothing special just a common weed but god was going to take myrtle and turn her into a star because esther means star she could not put herself there she could not become that by effort there was nothing she could do to move from the myrtle from myrtle from hadassah from orphan girl amen orphan girl jew in a foreign land there's nothing she could do to become wife of the king queen queen of the there's nothing in her power she could do but god had her laying there he knew the heart of haman he knew what was going on there was a great warfare between the amalekites because haman was an amalekite in the jews and this was going to be the final blow to the amalekites and god knew it he'd do it from before the foundation of the world and so there's a vashti there and the vashti is strong and beautiful and powerful and wise so much so that she's lost humility and submission and she's rejected because of a lack of humility and submission she's cast out so now the king is looking for character so god is working out all the circumstances to get hadassah moved into the the king's chamber of the house of the women and there's a haggy eye there which is the prophet of the age which is going to begin to tell her the things that she needs to go and present herself to the king and what is going to bring her into the union with the king her submission her reverence for haggy eye and her humility because when it was her time to go she took nothing of her own thinking nothing of her own desire she only took what haggai required what he had appointed and when the king saw her fashioned after his desire he found the character he's looking for and he loved her above all the virgins and he took her to wife and now she becomes the wife but she has not lost her reverence her submission and her humility now a decree goes out from haman remember who haman is what are the jews going to do there's nothing they can do about it they can't amass an army they don't have a mighty warrior there's nothing that they can do but god has a weaker vessel that will stay weak and display his strength of redemption through her weakness so we know how the plan unfolds and we know but what she does she doesn't even know that she can go to the king she doesn't even know if she'll survive she tells mordech i pray we'll pray and fast if i die i die she's surrendering she's submitting and when she comes to the king she comes dressed in the royal peril he gave her she comes dressed the way he wants her dressed and she bows herself before the king and waits for the king to extend the scepter to receive her she doesn't march and she doesn't become bold amen when she comes in she comes reverently she comes reverently to the king and she doesn't just declare what her need is she says if it be pleasing to you and have i found favor in your sight come to a banquet of wine let me entertain you she doesn't just go in and say i want this and i want this and i want this and i want this she comes reverently in submission and with humility this is why brother branham said the way up is down not because he felt like saying it because the whole bible's written that way when brother brennan makes statements like this the way up is down if you want to see how big you can become see how little you can get amen all of these things the reason brother ben says that he doesn't have to quote you the scripture that says that the whole scripture says that from genesis to revelation that's what it's saying and when brother branham's preaching amen he doesn't have to give you bible references because the bible is his reference because he knows the author real well so now we know that haman is destroyed the jews are set free all because there was a weaker vessel who would allow god to use her in her weakness she didn't have to become strong she didn't have to become powerful she didn't have to become smart all she had to do is stay the way god made her in the position that god put her and being what she was with the character she had in the position god brought her in brought the victory haman was destroyed i'm telling you there's a haman that's laid a trap in this day and he's going to hang on his own gallows but he's not going to hang on his own galas because there's a proud arrogant self-sufficient bride on this earth who makes bold boasts and bold claims and claims that she's got this power she's got this story she's got that the only thing she has is a position in that position she didn't get herself that position was given to her by the grace of god she didn't attain it by her wisdom and her intellect and her much study and her wisdom and character to be able to understand the bible she was brought into this position because she could humble herself to the word she could reverence god's gift she could submit to the authority that's over her whenever you see that arrogant attitude slip into the bride you're looking at bashti i say god help us stay weak help us stay humble it's not wrong to have confidence in your position you can have confidence in your position and over time amen the king brought esther into a confidence and his love for her he brought into a confidence of her position but she never forsook her reverence and her submission in her humility when god was going to bring his lamb god chose redemption through a lamb when he's going to bring his lamb he was he was the seed of david he was the lion of the tribe of judah but in what form did he come he come in the form of a lamb he come in the form of a man and when jesus christ came he came in weakness brother branham said i saw him he said when i saw him in the sagebroom field he said he was a little man wasn't big and powerful amen let's let's turn and look at this in john 14. john 14 and 9 jesus saith unto him philip asked let's go to verse 8 philip sayeth unto him lord show us the father and it suffices us jesus said in them have i been so long time with you and yet has thou not known me philip he that hath seen me had seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father and me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake jesus did not even take credit for his own works when when god brought jesus christ on the scene he was humble submissive reverence to the father and that was his power when god was going to bring a son on earth and that son was going to become the lamb and he was going to take away the sins of the world he brought him in weakness and in humility he brought him through a virgin who nobody knew about he even would allow a nasty rumor to be told about him so that through his life he would have to contend with that rumor that he was illegitimately born he had him born to parents who were nobodies and and he didn't even grow up a stable childhood because he was born in bethlehem and when he was two or three years old he was taken down to egypt and then as he was a child he was brought back in uh to galilee and he he was moved about and tossed about him and what was he he was the lamb of god he was a manual god made flesh what kind of flesh not big not powerful not beautiful but submissive reverent humble weak let's turn to isaiah 53. see what the bible says about him isaiah 53 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not when god was going to come and flash he was going to come in a weak form does it mean he was weak nope he was fashioned in weakness but the power of god was going to be the strength matthew chapter 12. let's turn there next matthew 12 14. matthew 12 and 14 says then the pharisees went out and held a council against him how they might destroy him but when jesus knew it he would through himself from thence and great multitudes followed him and he healed them all and charged them that they should not make him known that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaias the prophet saying behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved and whom my soul was well pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall show judgment to the gentiles he shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets a bruised reed shall he not break in a smoking flack shall he not quench until he send forth judgment unto victory jesus wasn't boastful arrogant loud he didn't bulldoze his way through situations he didn't plow do you see his nature amen he wouldn't even break a bruised reed or quench a smoking flax he was tender humble submissive reverent to his father in second corinthians 13 turn their second corinthians chapter 13 and verse 4 for though he was crucified through weakness how was he crucified through weakness for though he was crucified through weakness yet he lived by the power of god for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you he was crucified through weakness remember weakness a weaker vessel is attached to god's plan of redemption and so christ compared to the pharisees and sadducees compared to the sanhedrin compared to the priest of the day he was in weakness he had no army he had no strength he had no education he had no backing he was just one man and and god is working his plan through the weaker vessel and now jesus comes in a fashion of weakness and through weakness on the cross amen you can see that that as he surrendered his life in in the garden of gethsemane he wrestled with his own flesh and he recently he rescinded his own ideas and he and he and he gave over to god all his own wants and all his own desires and he surrendered completely to god and god took that vessel and he had him arrested and everybody that claimed that they would defend him and fight for him were gone now he's an absolute weakness he has nobody to stand with it nobody to testify on his behalf he stands alone they take him and they scourge him and they beat him until his ribs show through his back where they've taken so much flesh away in the beating and they take him to to carry his own cross to calvary and he's in such weakness that he doesn't have the strength to carry his cross so they summon somebody else to carry it for him what's he doing he's coming in utter weakness surrender to the father humility in the flesh amen he's coming stripped naked and beaten humble submissive reverent to his father and what's he doing he is going to drive the death blow to the devil what is it god working in simplicity god working in humility god working in weakness and you can see he's nailed to a cross blood dripping all from all parts of his body stripped naked and shamed before everybody and he's nailed to the cross amen and he's there in weakness and he's just got his eye cracked open waiting to see if he can lure the devil all the way in he set a trap nailed to the cross naked bleeding spit on cursed everybody else and he's the one laying the trap shortly the bee of death began to buzz around and this is what he was waiting for the scripture says if the princes of this world knew that he was the lord of glory they would have never allowed him to be crucified because it would tear down every one of their kingdoms and everything that anointed them would fight against it they didn't know because he came in such a way that it could even deceive the devil and that be of death which if the princess had known that he was the lord of glory they would have never let that be of death touch him but he came in such humility he came in such weakness they didn't believe that this could be the prophecy this can't be it it can't have come that way not through that women and woman not in that life not in that vessel there's no way that this is the plan so they felt sure of himself just to get rid of him because he's causing problems and he's laying there and the trap is set amen the the tripwire is almost sprung and all of a sudden here comes the sting of death the bee buzz buzz buzz and all of a sudden it plunged his stinger into him and he said i got you now and he pulled that stinger out and freed us from the fear of death how through strength strength through weakness friends that's why he chose the weaker vessel brother branham says in the message identification 1964 remember that was the very thing that turned judas to the popular amongst the rest of the ministers he sold him for 30 pieces of silver now why did he sell him brother ben will tell you he what made him turn he actually doubted the claims of christ being the word he could see that man now listen what was his attention drawn to the physical form of the man he could see that man eat with him fish with him out there and everything else and him being the word he couldn't believe it why because of the weakness of the human form he eat with him he fished with him he slept with him he saw him out there and he just couldn't believe that he was the word i want to read that again he actually doubted the claims of christ being the word he could see that man eat with him fish with him out there everything else and him being the word he couldn't believe it he couldn't believe he was god because he saw the man he ate with him and he fished with him and it was so humble and it was so weak that he just couldn't believe that he was god he couldn't believe he was god and he was judas's character caused him to do this has your character done the same remember judas was very religious judas saw the miracles judas was the treasure of the church judas went along amen with with everything he sought he believed the miracles he believed the miracles he believed he was in the boat when peter walked on the water he was in the boat when he said peace be still he believed he was a mighty man he believed he was a prophet he believed amen all the supernatural but he just couldn't believe that he was the word he just couldn't believe that that vessel there was god don't make the same mistake today just because he comes in the weak form of the bride humble submissive reverent nothing special in this world no special appointments no special features no special powers or strength she's just as humble as humble can be one from here one from there one from a broken home one from a denominational system one from a bad marriage one from a sinful life one from a religious life one from education one from no education he pulls them all together and what are they they're a hodgepodge ragtag of weakness displays of weakness from this whole earth the weakness here and the weakness there and the weakness there and he's pulled it all together to make his bride and she doesn't look like much in the eyes of the world she's got no strength no financial backing no denominational system no nobody to stand up for her don't mistake what she is don't say she's pretty nice she's just that don't mistake this she's the word or you'll fall like judas fell in 1964 the masterpiece he says now in closing in a few minutes i want you to notice real close something that just happened malachi 4 is to bring back back to the original she is smitten from the church she is smitten from the church from the church body smitten with her master for the same purpose she is the word there'll be judases who believe the miracles believe the supernatural saw the calming of the sea saul over that but they just can't go that far to believe that this man is the word these people are the word this is the manifestation of the mystery of god in this day i can see it all but you really smen from the church from the church body smitten with her master for the same purpose she is the word just the same as joseph was smitten from his brethren because he was the word and jesus was smitten from his brethren because he was the word the church is smitten the bride is smitten from the church because she is the word there's your stages again one two three the word living in an action the bible bride not some man-made bride the bible bride smitten and afflicted of god no beauty we should desire her what's he doing he's taking the prophecy out of isaiah 53 and he's bringing it into bride form because the prophecy christ is now in bride form amen and you say that's not what the bible says it's what it said because it's referring to christ and christ is here no beauty we should desire her but yet we did esteem her smitten and afflicted of god that's right she stands alone she is smitten from all the denominations according to revelations 3 catch this friends brother brenham says she is smitten from all the denominations according to revelations 3. what did revelations 3 say behold i stand at the door and not because christ the word was put outside the church and where is the word now what is the manifestation of the word the word is in bright form now and now brother branham is taking he's taking revelations chapter 3 in the laodicean church age and he's pinning it right upon the bride and saying she's rejected she is smitten she is cast out of the churches according to revelations chapter 3. she is smitten out of the laodicean churches that she was raised up in behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and his voice is in his bride and she is the final voice to the final age amen and he says i'm knocking what's knocking the voice is knocking in this day and it's outside the church she has been put outside the church she has been smitten from the church because whatever he was she is there is no beauty we should desire him there's no beauty we should desire her he was smitten and cast out she is smitten and cast out he was meek and lowly she is meek and lowly praise god listen to what brother branham says in the message perfect strength by perfect weakness and i would encourage you to go listen to that from 1961 perfect strength by perfect weakness so then if i should call it a text i'd like to use this of strength perfect strength by perfect weakness if we have weakness we have strength it's an unusual test in a pentecostal assembly to make take a test of weakness because we're always testifying we're so strong listen to what brother branham says friends listen to what he's saying an unusual text to take in a pentecostal assembly a text of weakness because we're always testifying we're so strong sounds like vashti to me so beautiful all the women are gathering around having a banquet of the women being admired she had no more submission and humility she began to get lifted up in her own eyes i would say she became deceived by her own brightness by her own glory she forgot who gave her her appointment and adornment and clothing and everything she had came from that king and she forgot it and she began to think that she was worthy of all of this herself and she was cast out and little hadassah was brought up to be the star because she could reverence the king she could submit to authority she could humble herself we're always testifying we're so strong further in perfect weakness he says there's so many of us likes to testify of our likes to think that we're insufficient we testify or likes to think that we're insufficient and therefore we make that an excuse i have no education i have no ability i'm unable to do this if you keep that up and do that and that way keep going like that then you can't mount to anything but the very thing that we make excuses by our weaknesses god uses that very thing to tackle the job with he waits for us to get to that condition so that he can use us what does he want he wants a weaker vessel we take the excuses and say well i can't do this i'm insufficient i can't do that and god takes that very thing to do the job with that's true that's the reason why he chooses us because we're in that condition what condition we can't do nothing that's the very reason he chooses us because we're in that condition what condition we can't do nothing that's the very reason he chooses us in that condition what's the condition we can't do nothing how many of you can't do nothing how many says i can't get anything right and everything i try i get it wrong praise god that's what he's looking for he's looking for a weaker vessel that he can bring about his redemption promise that he can bring his plan of redemption through the weaker vessel i say let's not try to be strong let's not try to get better let's not try to educate ourselves and get smarter let's just stay humble reverent submissive and let god show his strength through our weakness what's happening next in the world brother chad i have no idea what will this group do well without your group i don't know what should we do about this situation i don't know what should we do about this situation i don't know what do you think will happen i don't know what do you think about the vaccines do you think they're this and one group says they're this and one group says they're this i have no idea what the vaccines are are they good maybe are they bad maybe will they kill us off possibly will they save the world i don't know why do you need to know why is it so important that you become wise figure out what's happening next and sort out what this group's going to do and what this group's going to do and i know who's going to be in the next election no you don't know who's going to be in the next election you understand what i'm saying we're always trying and god doesn't want that god wants somebody that says you know what i don't know and every time i've guessed in the past i've been wrong except that one time i got lucky in god and that makes me think maybe i can get it right again and we always talk about the one time we guessed it right and leave out the 10 times we got it wrong and your wife is sitting there thinking is that right because there's something in humanity always wants to be strong but humans are weak they're fallen they're broken they're incapable of saving themselves the one that always gets in the way is you the one that's always standing in god's way is you the one that's your enemy is you the one that's messing up the plan is you so it's time to realize i am absolutely nothing without god i can do nothing i will never get this right the only thing i can do is lay myself down at his feet and say here i am lord we have to move away from every notion of strength he goes on to say he waits for us to get in that condition so that he can use us we take the excuses and say i can't do this i'm insufficient can't do that and god takes the very thing to do the job with that's the reason why i choose us because we're in that condition that sounds strange but just a few minutes we'll get to the reason of it god willing we find out just that we've been reading the weakness and rejection and we find out that those people who are the weakest and the rejected by the outside world is god's heroes that conquer up in the front lines take those who are feel themselves unworthy let's go to hebrews chapter 11. hebrews chapter 11 verse 32 this is an example what brother branham's talking about and the message perfect strength by perfect weakness he says in hebrews 11 32 and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and of barack and of samson and the jephthah of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead race to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trials of cruel mockings and scourging yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wondered about sheepskins and goat skins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens of caves and of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect they through weakness were made strong they stopped the mouths of lions what the bible said how did daniel stop the mouths of lions he didn't he believed god and the faith that he had stopped the mouths of lions it was through his submission to god his surrender to god he would not surrender to the to the laws of the government he surrendered himself to god and through his humility and submission he never fought the order he never tried to come up with a a a pact or an alliance or an allegiance that would get him out of trouble if he should get caught praying he just honored god and prayed and he never disrespected or dis and honored the king through reverence and submission and humility amen god by his faith in god when he was cast into the lion lying in his face stopped the mouths of lions he had no physical ability to stop the mouths of those lions or quench the fire how did the three hebrew children they weren't children then but how did the three hebrew men how did they quench the fire they had no ability to quench the fire they just submitted to god and trusted in god every step of the way amen and their faith in god through submission humility and reverence amen when they were thrown into the fire the men that threw them in died amen but they didn't die how did they quench the fire they didn't quench the fire it was their submission to god it was their reverence and their humility before him they honored his word they stayed with his word and they were delivered through weakness were made strong their very weakness led them up there with no way to save themselves their very weakness and surrender to god gave them no hope of salvation amen but their faith was their hope their weakness was the path to victory when they were thrown in honoring god's word and submitting to god word and reverencing god and even the government you mean reverencing the government they said oh king lived forever they didn't disrespect him or spit at him or hiss or call him names o king live forever we cannot bow they were thrown in in submission and in reverence in humility and one of the greatest miracles that took place in the old testament took place through their weakness through their submission and reverence and humility they went in the fire and the king looked in and they weren't burnt they were up walking around all it did was burn their bonds all the bomb bombs that held them were burned off of them they were walking around and now there's a fourth man in the fire and the king says he looks like the son of god what did they do how did they get there what power that they have they had the power of faith not muscles not intellect not alliances not allegiances but just faith and that faith in the word of god would move them to humble themselves in the face of the word to reverence the word and the authority god put over him and subject himself to whatever they were subjected to to honor that word and in that they wrought a great victory and for thousands of years generations have take courage because of their actions but really what did they do what strength did they have what power did they it was the power of god when you get weak in yourself it brings the power of god on the scene when you can no more deliver yourself and god delivers you it brought the power of god on the scene when you honor his word when you reverence him and submit yourself under his hand it brings the mighty power of god and through weakness you're made strong brother goes on to say in perfect strength by perfect weakness notice that it takes the weakest and the rejected and practically every hero god ever had on the front line was that type of person a person that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient a person that had no ability at all then that person just in good shape so god can start using them that's right when they feel like they can't they haven't got nothing that's when god can take a hold of them and do something with them but when we are thinking that we're able to do it then god can't use us because we're wanting to do it ourselves a couple paragraphs further he says the the important thing one of the important things that we must master now don't get tired on me catch this one of the important things that we must master now remember this especially you young preachers and lay members alike there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill god's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of that thing and lay it aside so that god can use us that's right and make a complete surrender we cannot use any ability we've got to make a complete surrender and to come to god you've got to surrender to him both soul body and spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to god in order that he can work his will in you and in me now that's hard i know because we're always wanting to put our own part in it something that we know you know what we want to do it that we want to do it you say well i just show i just know it should be done this way but as long as you're doing it that way it's going to be wrong and god will never use that effort maybe with the help of the lord we're going to get into that in a few minutes and just show you how god cannot use your ability so don't use your inability as an excuse anymore i can't do it i can't do it i can't do it well praise god he never wanted you to do it anyways he wanted to do it through you even jesus says it's not me that does the works but the father that's in me he's doing them that's the same place we're supposed to get to further in perfect strength by perfect weakness he says there that's it we smother him out we drive him away from the poorest of us to the richest of us from the least to the greatest we keep god out of our lives because of our own selves i've often said the greatest enemy i got is william branham he's the one that gets in god's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves god right out of the picture watch those guys out of the picture when you say i'm the bride i can do this i'm the bride i'll do this i'm the bride i'll tackle that that's when you shove god right out of the picture what you should say is i'm the bride by god's grace and he'll protect me he'll deliver me he'll step on the scene how i don't know when i don't know i have no idea but if i honor him and submit myself to him and reverence him and and humble myself before his word he'll be mighty he'll be my defender he'll be my strong tower he will come on the scene and he will do the supernatural it's not me i don't have any ability brother said the only ability he had was to get himself out of the way to surrender himself and yield himself to god it's not what he did it's what god did through him if we want to emulate the prophet's ministry if you want to be like him that's how you can be like him just get out of the way because that was his secret his secret is his surrender his secret was his weakness his secret was the the weakness with which he was raised the weakness in which he was called the rejection from all the churches the the inability to do anything on his own amen the the casting out from the church and the the inability to write properly to grammarize properly to to put things together that was his strength if we want to copy anything copy his humility we want to stand and try to have a ministry like his and be bold and proclaim things and do mighty things amen if we're going to do what the prophet did then we're going to have to have the humility that he had and the surrender that he had and we're going to have to lay our lives down and give ourselves completely to him and get ourselves out of the way and then we will have the right kind of ministry in this life god help us he said he's going on talking about himself he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves god right out of the picture but when i can get rid of that guy when i can get to a place that he's out of the way then god can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about that's when god can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot all right see the feminist movement has ruined god's picture god created a woman a byproduct who did it was she made wrong no she was made right she wasn't made the same as all the other creations were made in the original creation form she wasn't made the same way they were but it was she made wrong no she was made right she was made with a weakness so that she could fall so that god could bring his plan was she made wrong no she was made right and she in her weakness and her submission in her weakness amen she was tempted by the devil and opened the door to god's redemption plan god was working through the weaker vessel and three come to another weaker vessel and he brought forth the seed that'll bruise the serpent's head he's working through the weaker vessel but the feminist movement will come in and say you're not weak you're strong that's why i hate church feminism you're a strong church you're powerful nothing's going to happen to you you got this and you got that you ain't got nothing in yourself all you've got is a promise from god and your ability to surrender yourself to that promise you keep pumping people and pumping people and pumping people until they take on the characteristics of vashti i say god forgive us we're not going to pump that we're just going to go back to the word the word the word the word the word that's my headship that's my leadership that's my god and he lives in me are you the word too yes i'm the word too but i'm the feminine part of the word that's subjecting myself and surrendering myself to the headship of the world not what i can do i can't do anything i'm about as capable as mary was when she was a virgin in nazareth to bring about isaiah 7. how capable was she she was the predestinated one she was chosen of god in the mind of god before the foundation of the world but what capability did she have to bring it to pass years later you can go up to mary and say thank you for bringing jesus on the earth and she would say i had nothing to do with it it wasn't me i was just the one standing near when he did it wasn't what i knew it's what he did it's not what my strength it was his strength it was not what i've done it's what i surrendered myself to god is looking for a bride in this day to bring forth the promised seed amen it's not going to be her ability how can you do it there's no only one thing you can do you can say be it unto me according to your word not by might not by strength but by my spirit sayeth the lord the feminism wants to take and lift the woman out of this poor position of being weaker you see how the devil is feminism wants to say no no no you're not weaker you want to be subject you're equal to you're better than men you can do anything he can do and you can do it better be strong girl power i mean have you seen the shirts girl power even i saw a shirt on a little girl one day said boys drool girls rule what mother would put that shirt on her daughter and set her up for the devil to use her for destruction why because god make her a weaker vessel because she's a key to redemption as a weaker vessel don't take away the weakness of the woman don't empower her don't leave her the way god made her because god made her for redemption purposes and he made her just right to bring about his plan of redemption don't change the woman she's made right she different yes is she weaker yes is there a door to be open yes but she's made right don't don't pump feminism into your daughters put the scripture into their minds let them know how wonderful it is to be made and fashioned that way to be to be made in weakness so that god can use a woman he's always used the woman who what's the devil after the woman what's god after the woman why is this battle over the woman because she's instrumental to redemption she's the key to redemption why is the feminist movement moving so fast why is it getting such dominance why because the woman is the key to redemption the weaker vessel is the key the devil wants to use the weakness for his purpose and god is intended to use the weakness for his glory i say glory in what you are and say thank you god for when i am weak then am i strong god bless you sisters you who will take what god has made you and say i want to be what god has made me and i want god to use my my my womanhood to display his attributes not to move out from where god has me and take on a role take feministic ideas and throw all of that in the trash because it's all antichrist come back to saying you know husbands dwell with your wives according to knowledge giving honor value something that's valuable and precious to her as the weaker vessel now she's the example of the church she's the type of redemption and then the bible comes in romans 16 and paul says thus be the god of all peace who will bruise the serpent under your feet what feet the church's feet the bride's feet the woman's feet shortly she's a key to redemption but that key that key to redemption has everything to do with the way she's made and she can take that weakness and yield it to the devil or she can take that weakness and yield it to god and now the bride in this day the church she can take that weakness that she has because she's in feminine form is that true so she's the weaker vessel she can take that weakness and she can yield it to the devil and he'll bring more deception more ruin or she can take that weakness and she can yield it to her husband the revealed word in this day and it can keep unlocking redemption i say let's take our weakness and yield it to him say god i know nothing in myself i am nothing my abilities will never accomplish anything but you chose me the weaker vessel and i'm giving all myself to you and when that woman the weaker vessel yielded herself to her husband she had the ability to bring forth the seed and in this day if we'll just yield ourselves to our husband it brings the ability through his strength that's sown into her to bring forth christ she'll never do it or on her own she'll only do it in submission and weakness do you want to go to a strong church no do you want to have the best of it no i want to look around and say there's a lot of weakness around here we we need him there's a lot there's a lot that we can do better praise god we need him be the weaker vessel and yield it to him let's all stand musicians if you could come i hope every woman can leave here today saying i'm glad i'm a woman i'm glad that god has put something in me that will display what he's doing in this world and what he's done and what's happened then i can be a type of the church and the key is submission humility reverence to our headship the king which is christ the revealed word let's give it all back to him and let him take the weaker vessel in this day and let him take our weakness and turn it to strength and let him the god of all peace bruise the serpent the devil under your feet shortly not by your power but by his let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word we thank you god that you've showed us in this word your redemption plan and what you've done in the role that you've taken in the weaker vessel and how you've always used a weaker vessel encourage us lord to just stay humble to just stay irreverent just to be whatever esther was may we be that lord whatever mary was may we be that may this end time bride lord be the bride that you've always wanted though she's in a weak form lord you're here you're present here with her to make sure that she doesn't fall again you've come down yourself lord and you're whispering the love secrets in her ear lord you're bringing strength by your word you're bringing lord the strength to overcome the enemy by the revelation of the hour whispering your love secrets of power and strength into this vessel help us to stay humble god submissive and reverent to you and may you get all the glory and have all the victory may we have a testimony like mary i didn't do it it's not what i've done it's what i surrendered myself to god take us and use us for your purpose use us for your glory let us make no excuses for weaknesses but let us give our weaknesses to you our insufficiencies may you take them lord and may you get glory in the mall bless each one of your children lord bless us as we go may we travel this world not trying to be strong not trying to be smart not trying to have it figured out but may we just walk in humility and saying god whatever you show me i'll receive whatever you reveal to me i'll enjoy and i'll walk one step at a time as you reveal the next step to me god i love you let your strength your might your power be displayed in your humble bride in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you brother his strength is perfect [Music] is [Music] raised [Music] is [Music] is [Applause] [Music] us when [Music] [Applause]
