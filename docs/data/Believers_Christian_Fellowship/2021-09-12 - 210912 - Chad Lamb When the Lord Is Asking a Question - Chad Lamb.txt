more to you we pray god as we move to the breaking of the bread we pray that you would come yourself by your own hands you would break the bread of life to us you would come lord and use a gift that

equipped lord strengthened with a greater resolve to serve you than ever before we ask your blessings over the service in jesus christ's name we pray amen may god bless you while we're standing let's take our bibles and go to genesis chapter 3. we'll read a verse of scripture and let you have your seats and then there's a testament a couple testimonies i'd like to share with you let's turn to genesis chapter 3 verse 7 genesis chapter 3 verse 7. and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called him to adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i have commanded thee that thou should not eat amen may the lord add his blessing to the word you can be seated i have a tremendous testimony i want to share of brother bernie sand martin some of you know i asked him to write it out so i wouldn't lose any of the details but many of you know maybe not all of you know that brother bernie got a terrible case of shingles five years ago just an extreme case of shingles where he couldn't even have clothing touch his skin he broke out in a rash like he did in shingles many times and it was around his torso around his waist and um and so that left permanent damage to his nerves so for five years he suffered with extreme pain and if you ever wondered why he hugged you kind of funny that was why brother bernie hugged you kind of funny if you put too much of a squeeze on him he would react but he's been nursing this side and here's what he wrote down for us he said i want to thank god and my brothers and sisters that have been praying for me for the last five years in which i had suffered with nerve neuropathy caused by a severe case of shingles around my waist due to this pain i wore a wrap about my my my midriff over my t-shirt if i didn't do this the rubbing on my shirt on the area would cause a lot of pain there were times i felt i wanted to go home to my father as the pain was unbearable trying to find anything that would would help the pain i went to a pain specialist who tried twice to kill the nerve that was causing the pain but was not successful he also gave me a special cream with meds that were supposed to help and it also was not successful because all of these treatments did not work i have been taking ibuprofen and a few other things that i can't pronounce sorry brother bernie to manage the pain even with taking these medicines i was still in quite a bit of pain around a year ago i started putting valtterin and biofreeze on the pain and it was helpful on august 25th ezra and teresa levy cheryl emily and i headed for davey florida around 7 p.m so they left 7 pm and they drove through the night our plans were to travel straight through ezra took the night drive and i stayed up through the night to help ezra stay alert after many hours on the road we decided to take a break in the in the hours early hours of the morning they decided to take a break at cracker barrel we pulled in and as i was getting ready to put the wrap around my waist i noticed that i didn't need it anymore what happened god knows it felt good not to have that belt around my waist anymore god bless you brother bernie thank god praise the lord healing is a promise and healing the promise of healing has no time constraints it doesn't wear out after a week of no results or a month or or a year or even five years but healing is the children's bread and healing is our promise and it was paid for at calvary and you know i would check on brother bernie from time to time how are you doing how you're doing and he would say oh it's still there but i'm fine it's still there but he said the lord has healed me and he kept confessing the lord has healed me i'm healed and he said i know that this will go away he never stopped with his positive confession ever let that be an example to all of us in a testimony if we stay with god's word god honors his word we just have to stick with it and believe i say god bless you brother bernie it's good to see you feeling good my brother he went on to say i praise god for his healing touch i no longer have to wear my belt or take meds i pray this testimony will encourage my other brothers and sisters with faith that are living with pain i look forward to their testimony of god's healing that's a positive confession and he is the high priest of our profession which is our confession and so we may may we take courage amen by brother bernie's testimony and may it be an example to us to never stop you know never stop believing that you're going to be totally well and brother bernie was looking for relief they couldn't offer him relief anything that would just give him a little bit of relief so he could function amen but the whole time he was trusting god to take it completely away i also want to say i appreciated the special this morning appreciate those brothers who sing it may god bless you and and don't stop amen i mean if god inspires you sing once i'm sure he'll do it again praise the lord amen let's look back at genesis chapter 3. in uh i like i have a strange title because i have a strange sermon that came in a strange way so praise the lord amen you know i've i've i've done this for for years and you know hundreds and hundreds of sermons i may have preached close to a thousand sermons in my lifetime already and you never get good at it that's all i can say you never get good at it you never get it figured out you never get to the point where you can just go whip out a sermon and you just go sit at your computer do a word search and i got a sermon it doesn't work that way you cannot make it come amen you cannot control it with no inspiration there's nothing happening and you can have all the tools you can have the message you have the bible you have search programs with no inspiration nothing happens and then when inspiration comes you think wow that's the inspiration but praise the lord that's what we wait for and so god in a very strange and unique way he gave me a thought and inspiration came in like a wisp and it just i began to meditate on that and i'd like to share that with you this morning and the title i'd like to title this is when the lord is asking a question when the lord is asking a question we look here at genesis chapter 3 and we'll go to verse 8 and it says and they heard the voice of the lord god waiting in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou now this is the first question that i want to look at god is calling out in the garden and he's asking a question he's asking adam where art thou and i don't believe that god didn't know where he was do you believe that god knew where adam was you know and god is in the garden and adam has himself hid and god knows what has happened amen god knows that the fall has taken place he knows where adam is hiding but he begins to walk in the garden and he and he calls out adam where art thou and i don't believe god was seeking information i don't think god was looking for information that he did not possess i don't think he was looking to learn anything to gain any new knowledge but i think god asked the question for adam's sake because god didn't need to know but adam needed to see understand and many times i believe this is why god asks a question god in the bible many times will ask a question and i don't believe god needs information he doesn't need our input so he understands something better or so he can finally understand what's going on in the situation but i believe when god asks a question god is wanting the person he's asking the question to realize something so he says uh where art thou where are you not i don't know where your physical location is and i need to know where your physical relationship but where are you right now adam spiritually where are you why are you hiding from me why do you have a fig leaf apron on why are you hiding amongst the trees why are you now afraid of my presence why are you moving away from me why is the fellowship growing weaker why are you a strain for me where are you adam and and as i as i was meditating as the lord was just leading me down this path and and i began to say how many times amen would god like to ask us that question we we begin to get distracted sometimes with life and we begin to move away from the fellowship and brothers and sisters and we spend time away and we're not in the fellowship we're we're not with our brothers and sisters we're not talking about the word amen we we're now uh we're now uh skipping a few services and there's always excuses you know there's always something important that come up and and no doubt there are really issues that come up and reasons legitimate reasons but but i just wonder how many times god would like to say where are you not we're not i'm sitting in my car right now or i'm kneeling by my bed praying that's not what he wants to know but where are you why are you pulling back from my fellowship why are you hiding why have you become fearful why are you not running to me in trouble but why are you pulling back where are you and and adam says verse 10 and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself verse 11 and he said who told thee that thou was naked nobody had told him he was naked he realized it because of his sin his sin had broke through the veil of innocency and now a lust veil had dropped over and he realized that he was naked and so now god was getting adam to recognize and to declare what his condition is he said who who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou should us not eat jesus is asking a question adam adam becomes fearful and in this fear he makes a covering for himself and and and and that covering for himself they find in the presence of lord is insufficient so when god's coming down they run and hide and and i i i know from experience that many times when you see somebody begin to pull back from fellowship from brothers and sisters listen brothers and sisters this is nothing about church attendance this is not about you know a perfect attendance score i'm talking about pulling back from the fellowship pulling back from god with skin on it pulling back and the question is why are you pulling back amen what is going on in your life amen why are you withdrawing yourself what what is going on where are you at where are you at what is you tell me where you're at oh my could you imagine standing in the very presence of god and god says where are you and you know he's not asking you where you are on the globe and where you are amen standing at the present tense but he's asking where you are i mean where what's your spiritual condition can you even discern where you are right now and can you imagine standing in the presence of god and he says where are you and all of a sudden all the excuses that come to mind well we've got this going on this going we've been really busy and i've got troubles and besides they hurt my feelings and but in that presence he wants to know where you are and he asks another question who told you you were naked now god knew nobody told him he was naked he's wanting him to realize this is your condition because of your sin who told you you're naked did you eat the tree did you disobey the word have you left my commandment this is why you're in this condition and he's trying to wake adam up to his condition i come across this quote and i'd like to read it to you from 1958 from hear his voice it says we've got too many things ahead of the lord you can't have the prayer meetings because mr godfrey's on tonight you can't have prayer meetings because we love susie is on tonight or some kind of foolish nonsense like that that takes up the time we don't have time to hear the voice of the lord and those who do claim to be christians just kneel down of a little prayer like this kind of homemade lord bless me and my family and take care of us good night and the next morning rise up say just guide us through my day good day we should wait on the lord you see we do all the talking we don't give him a chance to talk back to us that if we would pray and pray until our soul comes into the presence of god and then just relax and listen to his voice oh i believe this is a key friends we're learning a key this morning we're tapping into something that that is real and will bring reality amen not the not the quick prayer that every one of us are guilty of falling into these traps because of the pace of life where we just go to bed god bless us help us you know sleep good and tomorrow give us a good day god bless you it's not an insincere prayer it's a sincere prayer it's not an insincere devotion it's a sincere devotion but it's it's clipped because of time constraints and we wake up in the morning oh god help us today and help us through our day and and good day and we move on through the day and brother branham is giving us a key he's saying listen all you've done is made your request to god but you never heard back from god takes time sometimes to hear back sometimes it's not a quick just a 10 15 minute 20 minute deal not a routine kind of a thing but laying aside some time amen and and laying in the presence of lord and not hiding from the presence of the lord you can say a prayer and not enter into his presence you can say a prayer and say it quick enough and do all the talking where no conviction comes to your heart it's possible you can say a prayer and you can do you you can do your devotion do your prayer and you can go through it so quick god doesn't have time to start working on the heart and you just move on and you come back and we can get to feeling good because we've got the routine down but but we haven't got come into the presence of the lord and stayed there long enough where he can begin to ask us a question to begin to ask us something or say something to our heart or prick our heart in a certain way it may be enough time where we lay in the presence of the lord long enough where he says where are you where have you been praise god see more than anything we want the reality this is this is the end time this is the final stage of the journey this is the final part of redemption for the gentile bride this is the wrapping up of all things this is this is we've said this over and over and we will say it over and over again but this is not the repeat of a previous church age this is where god is dwelling in flesh on earth again in the flesh of his bride and there has to be a relationship a presence with god a walking with the lord in the cool of the evening you could say and where there's a relationship in time to speak to him but also time for him to speak to you times of meditation times where you think on these things and god can begin to open things to us i want to look at another one let's go to first kings chapter 19. first kings chapter 19. i'm gonna start at verse 11 i think no i'm sorry let's go to verse 9. first kings 19-9 this is elijah and he's running away after the mount carmel showdown jezebel's after him god puts him to rest and has an angel feed him then he runs to mount horeb it says and he came hither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou hear elijah boy here's another good question what are you doing here like why are you here and and watch watch elijah's answer and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and he'd be behold and the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the the mountains and break it in pieces and the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and brother brenham said what was that voice it was the word because he's known in the word that's how you hear his voice in the word and there was a still small voice verse 13 and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering into the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou hear elijah same question he asked him the question so elijah gave him the answer but god didn't need the information because he wouldn't have asked him the second time elijah already answered the question what doest out here i'm here because i've been jealous over you and i've done all this and then they seek my life and and he's he's he's giving an answer to the question amen but but the question hasn't yet had its effect on elijah yet because elijah's just answering the question what are you doing here and if elijah had sufficiently answered the question god would have never asked him the question a second time but god asked him a question the second time because he wanted elijah to learn something in the question god didn't want to learn something in the question what are you doing here why why are you here elijah has excuses and he's got you know when we look at elijah and what he bent through and what's happening to him you you none of us would blame him for being upset and running away and all the things that he was going through it's logical it makes sense i would say you know in his situation i'd probably do the same thing but god doesn't react to situations the way you and i react to situations god is not carnal like we are carnal and when elijah runs away amen and now he's in horeb and now he's in a cave and he says what are you doing here elijah well he goes to the carnal i was doing this and i was doing that and they sought my life and they chased me and i've run here to hide amen and god begins to speak to elijah and he comes in and a great uh a great uh wind that rips the rocks and god wasn't in the wind and god's showing it it's not any of these big things it's not any of these these giant things it's the still small voice we're looking for big flashes of things big giant movements of stuff i mean big things that are tangible you can see that really demonstrate the power of god but brother branham when he came to this he said it was the word that's what it was and that's what we that's what elijah began to respond to was the word and and when he heard the word the still small voice you see he may have trembled under the under the uh wind he may have trembled at the fire he may have shook at the earthquake amen but nothing moved him to humility into action until he heard the still small voice but when he heard the word he wrapped his face in a mantle in a show of humility and went to the entrance of the cave and stood there now he was ready to listen and god said to him a second time he said in verse 13 at the end of verse 13 what doest thou hear elijah elijah goes into the same answer and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of host because the children of israel forsaken thy covenant thrown down thy altars slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and the lord said unto him go return on thy way see god was not interested in the information that elijah was giving him god was not learning something changing his mind deciding what to do next but god asked a question to elijah so elijah would begin to answer the question what are you doing here and he asked him once and he gives an answer he asked him a second time he gives him virtually the exact same answer and elijah was missing something so god just said go back to where you came from you're not hiding out anymore you're not running away from the commission you you go back to where you came from and he sends him back with a furtherance of his commission and with more work to do and he sends him back to anoint jehu to anoint elisha to anoint a new king in syria and he sends him back with a commission because elijah was never supposed to get out of the commission and god was still tender and merciful to him god put him to sleep god baked cakes over coals for him god sent an angel to him amen god wasn't hating elijah he wasn't upset with elijah he wasn't angry with him but he had to get elijah awakened to where he was you're out of commission you've moved away from the calling you've run in fear you've moved outside of my plan for you and now just go back so god doesn't respond to his answer god sends him in a further commission so i wonder if god ever asked us what are you doing here and the question is what are you doing here i would ask the question what am i doing here what am i doing in the end time what am i doing here like in this location in this body in this time in this church in my what am i doing here am i here fulfilling the commission and the purpose god has for my life what am i or am i sidetracked by something am i am i distracted if i if i moved away have there been so many hurts so many misunderstandings and jezebel spirits that have lashed out against me have i run from my purpose and commission and decided to take a vacation from being a son or daughter of god that happens to people they get so hurt they get so misunderstood they get so questioned amen they they have so many hard things that take place and god never told us hard things wouldn't take place he never told us that we wouldn't have problems even amongst brethren because that's why you need brotherly love because if all the brethren are always perfect and always treats you perfect and you don't need brotherly love you need brotherly love to cover for your brethren when they need brotherly love so god never promised these things would be easy he never promised they'd be perfect but we're here for a purpose amen we've been given life in this age and a purpose the message has come to us for a purpose we're in the home the family the church the the job we're in the school we're in the place that we are for a purpose and it's not so that we can run away when things get tough and go hide out in a cave somewhere because if you do that god may be tender and merciful to you and may give you some special provision and special strength but eventually he's going to ask you the question what are you doing here why did you stop testifying why have you quit being bold with the word why have you stopped amen in the commission when i've commissioned you why why are you taking a time out timeout is too much god may god will be tender with his children like he was with elijah but eventually the question will come what are you doing here what are you doing here well brother so-and-so hurt my feelings and this one said this about me and i didn't get the the this or that and uh somebody else got it over me and whatever whatever you know all of it we've all lived the same kind of life god will ask you again what are you doing here you can go through the same thing it'll say go back go back to living a life vibrant and joyful go back to testifying go back for boldly proclaiming the truth go go back with joy that you've been called to bear the gospel in this end time go back go back into commission go back into work and here's some extra stuff i want you to do go back see when god asks a question there's a purpose behind the question let's go back to genesis chapter 4. genesis chapter 4 verse 5. but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very roth and his countenance fell and the lord said to cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen so i'm sure you're already ahead of me by now i don't think god didn't know i don't think god's going to cane and saying okay i noticed you look is something wrong is something eating at you did something go wrong in your day what's happened no god knew exactly why cain was wroth and he knew exactly why his countenance fell but the question wasn't for god to get information the question was meant to open cain's eyes why are you rough why is your countenance fallen why are you so upset verse 70 says if thou does well so god didn't wait for an answer so he didn't need an answer he wasn't looking for an answer the answer was in cain's heart if thou does well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well send life at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him god comes to cain and says why are you so angry if you just do amen like abel does if you just do right it'll be well with thee why are you so angry why is your countenance fall almost it's the question um if i could rephrase it i don't want to add to the scriptures or take away but i'd like to say it this way why are you angry like what right do you have to be angry that i would accept one sacrifice and not another and why would you let that make your countenance fall like why are you angry i'd like to ask the question to all of us hey listen we want god to speak amen but we believe that through the gifts through the fifo ministry god speaks and and just take it as god asking a question this morning why are you so mad why are you so frustrated i may not be speaking to everybody but i'm speaking to somebody this morning i know that for sure why are you so angry are you angry because life's not been fair are you angry because people didn't treat you right are you angry because things haven't worked out the way you want to work out are you angry because somebody cheated you're angry because somebody said something about you are you angry why are you angry and i want to follow up with this question what right have you to be angry why are you so upset why are you so frustrated why can't you get over what somebody did to you in the past why can't you get over an abuse and neglect why can't you move beyond why why can't you wake up and see that god is your father and he knows where you're at and he knows what you're suffering from he knows what's happened to you and he knows why it happened to you and he knows what purpose it will serve and he also knows that all things work together for the good he never said all things are good but all things work together for the good the question is why are you angry and why is your countenance falling why can't you have joy why can't you look in the face of the rest of the believers why why can't you be happy and joyful and vibrant why can't you be eager to look in the face of god why are you wrath and why is your countenance falling what is it that makes you think you've been cheated what makes you think you've been unfairly treated what makes you think that life is harder for you than it is for anybody else god asks a question because he doesn't want the answer god asks a question because he wants you to discern the answer he doesn't ask to get information he has to open our eyes amen and he's asking this morning why are you so angry and why is your countenance falling everybody gets stepped on neglected passed over everybody's been unconsidered a time or two some more than others some i agree some sufferings of others seem to be more than the sufferings of some i don't understand that but one thing i know is that we have a good father we have a heavenly father and he's a good father and he knows what he's doing with our lives he's not making mistakes he's not absent-minded he's not favoring one child over another child but our attitude amen begins to our attitude of anger and frustration and and our countenance falling what it begins to say is that this isn't fair so god is not just this it should have never happened to me this is not right this is not fair and all you're saying is god has not done a good job with my life what right did cain have to be angry because god determined which was the right way of worship god is god god was supposed to be the object of worship god was supposed to be the one they were seeking to please they were supposed to be coming to the altar and making their offerings to satisfy their father to satisfy god amen they were supposed to be worshipping him they were supposed to be pleasing him not themselves so when god says i'm pleased with this and not this why would that make you angry why would you get upset because if your objective is to please god and god says this is what pleases me why wouldn't you just repeat what pleases him what he accepted just do if your motive is pure if your love for god is genuine amen then you'll just throw away your own pride and your own thoughts and what you thought was right just throw it in the trash and say this is what god wants i'll do that because what i want is to worship him and what i want is to please him it's not about me it's about him but cain proved it was about him not about god and god of his mercy he comes along and he says why are you so roth and why is your countenance fallen he doesn't wait for an answer he knows what the problem is he says just just do if you do well want to be well with thee not send life at the door brother interprets this he says just do what abel did and it'll be well with thee but he was offended he was offended at god's choice he was offended he really was offended at god's desire and so this morning it would just allow me to ask the question and it may not affect it might only affect one tenth of one percent of everybody that's listening but if it affects you take it from the lord why are you so roth and why is your countenance falling why why why do you act like god is so unfair with you but so good to everyone else why why are you feeling so easily hurt brother bram said christians are rugged you don't have to pet them or baby them you don't soft-soak the gospel for them they're not some uh hot house plant they're rugged amen they can take it they can take the abuse look at the first century christians they can take it look at brother branham they can take it he was an example of toss of a mature believer not that it was easy he wept amen not that he always got it right he had to be corrected amen but when he when he when he comes to the poop and says i'm all cut up on the inside from a lot of hard battles listen friends he was cut up on the inside from a lot of hard battles amen but he wanted to do what elijah did he wanted to run to the cave up in alaska he wanted to go be a guide he wanted to get away from it all because of the rejection because of every reason elijah wanted to run brother branham wanted to run and god come to him and discern that and he and he did the same thing he did for elijah he comes along and he he has a conversation with his prophet as his prophets going along he said if you do what you've got planned to do amen you'll become a bum and your wife will leave you brother branham he's talking to god he doesn't want to be like that but he doesn't want to put himself back out there for more hurt amen and he wrestles it out until he surrenders to the lord and he recognizes that god is right and he begins to lay his life down all over again amen and he comes and preaches standing in the gap and then standing in the gap he begins to say listen he says he goes i i i still don't have the right attitude there's a man who can judge himself there's a man who god asked him a question and he didn't give him a trivial answer god asked him a question he began to say i'm wrong his eyes begin to open god asked him one time after he got his wife to kind of lie and it's kind of debatable whether it was a lie or not because the lawyer was calling and they recognized it was the lawyer calling and he didn't want to answer no more questions he was exhausted amen he told his wife he says i'll step outside and you tell him i stepped outside lie or not lied i mean we could all probably write an essay on it and all have our own opinions but none of us would answer the wrong way because we heard what the ancient lord said so it's not fair we've already got to the punchline but he does what he's finding some relief and he goes and he says tell him i stepped outside he steps outside and his wife says i'm sorry he stepped outside take a message and he comes in and his wife looks at him and says was that exactly right who was asking the question it may have come through a wife but it was more than just the wife was that exactly right sometimes god questions you through a brother or sister and you want to get mad at the brother or sister who asked you the question brother or sister will say hey i haven't seen you in church for a while is everything going on why is everybody so nosy why are they they're just waiting for me to mess up what attitude is that brother bam he goes down he said he brushes it oh yeah yeah i was i was technically i was outside it was technically true but reality it was false he goes to pray for a man's baby and as he's praying he goes to pray he goes to lay hands on this man's baby and the lord speaks in his heart and says how can you lay hands on that baby when you lied boy that's a good question how can you lay hands on that baby when you lie and brother branham had to tell them i'm sorry i've got to go make something right he runs through the woods he prays it through he calls the lawyers or he calls the law he then prays it through i don't remember the order and he makes it right with the lawyers he makes it right with his wife he makes it right with god he didn't get mad he didn't get angry he didn't throw up excuses he didn't go back to logic and reasoning why would you throw logic and reasoning in the face of god he just surrendered to the question that's right how can i like hansen's baby when i lied and he goes and makes it right he realizes that his wife had asked him the right question so many times we're getting asked the right question we're getting asked it by other believers we're getting asked it by our spouse maybe we're getting asked it by our children daddy why do we do this when brother benham said why is it okay for so-and-so and what not okay for this maybe the question is not because you need to give it an answer but maybe the question is coming so god can open our eyes not for god to learn but for us to see sometimes the question's coming across the pulpit it's coming over a tape or it's coming in meditation or through prayer it's coming from a brother or sister or a family member the question's coming and sometimes the question can come from an unbeliever have you ever had an unbeliever ask you a question that pricked your heart and smites you to the core and you realize you're wrong i say oh god it's not time to say a few unbelievable what do you know it's time to be real with god and let the question have its effect let the question open our eyes to our condition so that we can judge ourselves because if you judge yourselves you shall not be judged so he asked cain a question but cain couldn't respond to the question let's look at john chapter 8 and there's really no rhyme or reason to these these are just what came to me so i'm going through them as the lord leads john chapter 8. john chapter 8 verse 2 and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and the pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now moses and the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even to the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are thine accusers what a question what a question let the lord ask you that question where are your accusers god is through the blood of jesus christ unto the plan of redemption he's dealing with the accusers and he's getting the accusers dealt with and he's moving them off the scene and he's bringing us back into our original condition sinless virtuous spotless bride of jesus christ that never did in the first place washed by the water of the word and brought back but this woman was condemned and she was condemned amen by these religious leaders and they were corrupt to begin with because they caught her in the very act of adultery and they brought her alone with no man proving that the motive was completely wrong to begin with so now they come and they say you know what should we do and he writes something in the sand whatever he writes begins to convict their heart they begin to recognize they're wrong and they walk away and when when jesus deals with the accusers then he turns to the woman and he says where are thine accusers jesus knew where the accusers were he wants her to recognize she's now free from accusation he's waking her up to the fact she's got she's no doubt she's in shame she's got her own condemnation she was caught in the very act of adultery that would be a shameful experience she was drugged out in public by a mob a group of men at least and drug unto the feet of jesus in the temple it meant a public spectacle and now this has been going on she may not have even raised her head and because she was so shameful and so embarrassed about what happened but jesus was taking this poor woman who was a pawn in their game and a tool for the religious leaders and he was going to free her from that bondage but first he took the word or whatever word he wrote i don't know what it was but whatever he wrote whatever he put in the sand dealt with the religious leaders and they left and when god had dealt with them he turns to the woman and says where are thine accusers praise god where are thine accusers hath no man condemn thee she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more you know sometimes we carry guilt with us for past deeds we carry guilt and shame and regrets for years and years and years and those guilt that guilt that shame that regret what it does is the devil is constantly bringing condemnation and conviction and he's your accuser and what he's doing he's trying to limit your freedom he's trying to stop you from living an overcoming life he's trying to stop you from witnessing stop you from being joyful stop the word from taking effect in your life to where you become a bright and shining light that all can run to and so he's using all this condemnation and this guilt from this past and this woman had a whole heap of it amen but god the lord jesus begins to deal with the accusers and then he moves the accusers off the scene that's why brothers when we go in the resurrection amen that we stand before the lord the accuser of the brethren is not there when we go up he comes down and god makes sure when he draws his little bride to himself there's no other man there there's no other human being there it's just his bride and when his bride's standing there there's nobody there to accuse her of anything he has already dealt with all the accusers amen the accuser of the brethren been cast down when we get there all those that he worked through to throw accusations at you and point a finger and all that they won't be there and in this day god through a prophetic ministry has dealt with all the accusers he's dealt with all the accusers of accusing you of false doctrine and accusing you of this and this and that and and trying to bring false understanding and false teaching and bring you into adultery and he's dealt with all of that he's cast it all out and he looks at this little bride and he says where are thine accusers he wants you to realize that he has made you free he has been your advocate he's dealt with all those that bring condemnation and now the woman can raise her head and look around and he says is there no man to condemn thee and she says no man lord he says neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more this gospel came to set us free this word the washing of the water of the word came to wash all stint all all stain of sin off of us amen and it came to declare unto us brother branham's thanksgiving message he said i'm more thankful for this than anything i know of now you can be the sinless spotless bride of jesus christ taken back amen to your original condition what god intended for you to be before the fall amen as sons and daughters of god washed pearly white snow white and clean where are your accusers if you have any accuser tell them to go talk to the lord and he'll deal with them the same way he dealt with all the other accusers god wants us to go free where are thine accusers i have none that means if she had none she was going to have to stop accusing herself jesus dealt with all the physical accusers that brought accusation against her got them away then jesus declared i don't even accuse you now the only person left that can hold her back is herself this day through a prophet we've been declared to be the virtuous sinless spotless bride of jesus christ that there's been a pure word to wash us and bring us back to the original condition he's dealt with the accusers and he said to you neither do i accuse you now the only thing that can hold you back is if you accuse yourself say god help us to realize we have no accusers and neither do you accuse me and help me god to stop walking in condemnation if there's no more accusers and i've been freed from the accusations and you don't even accuse me anymore let me stop accusing myself and let me go free jesus said or the apostle paul said there is therefore now no condemnation to them that walk in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit when that woman answered that question who knows what was going on in her heart but she was destined to be stoned she was finished she was judged her life was over everything was finished and in a few moments time the whole situation changed and when she looked up and said were your accusers they were gone i said i have none they looked at the one man that was left standing there he said neither do i accuse you she ran from there free totally free what a question there's another question in matthew 16 that we're very familiar with let's turn there and look at this question matthew 16 and we'll begin at verse 13. matthew 16 and 13. when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah or one of the prophets and he sayeth unto them but whom say ye that i am jesus was asking them whom do men say that i the son of man he wants to know if they know who the son of man is the question is about the son of man because this question can be repeated in our day he said do you whom do men say that i the son of manham and we can answer that they'll say oh some believe it's a prophet william branham some believes it's a hoax and some believes it's this and some believes it's future tense some believes it's past tense those are the answers that we could give them if he come and ask you say whom do men say that i the son of man am in this end time and some will say well they some some men say you were william branham and and working in him and some men say you were past and some men say your future and some men say or this and some men say you're that but jesus now is going to go to the next level of questioning he says who do you say that i am the question is about the son of man who do you say that i that i am but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock will i build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it the prophet of god says it's the revelation of jesus christ amen that the church was built upon and at a present tense revelation of jesus christ of who he is now that the church is built upon brother branham says in the message the anointed ones at the end time says now i want you to know this is sure and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today that i was trying to say that about myself being that i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but it's the will of my father that i declared to do and determined to do i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that's happened as perfect they are i'm only one that's near when he does him i was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew is what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man who is who do men say that i the son of man am oh oh they said that you were the the seventh angel the seventh prophet you were there in brother branham that's true but what about today well they say that was a manifestation that took place but that's a manifestation that will take place but who do you say this is a question i'd like to ask today who do you say that he is today present tense who do you say the son of man is something that's happened something that will happen or something that's happening amen a manifestation of jesus christ present tense today because that's the rock that the church has built upon the revelation of jesus christ we can get all kinds of answers to this question but there's really only one answer that matters amen and if you're still depending on what everybody else is saying about the son of man jesus is going to take it a notch higher for you personally this morning you may say well my pastor says this and all the brothers here and our church believes but over there they believe it and back here they believe in i had a grandpa who believed that oh whatever it doesn't matter anymore when anybody else says because he asked that question first to bring you to the second question are you going to follow what everybody else says or are you going to have your own individual revelation of who i am the same question applied then applies today and let me amen stand in this office behind this pulpit and ask you the question who do you say this is i'm not talking future tense i'm not talking past tense i'm talking eternal present tense who do you say this is brother bam says in god's provided place of worship but he promised just before the coming of the end time the world would get like it was in sodom when a man come down and human form three of them two angels and god himself that was god the bible said it was now he come down and he manifested himself there by turning us back to the tent where sarah was and told abraham what sarah was thinking in the tent that right now jesus himself said at the day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of jesus christ himself so what is the son of man the ministry of jesus christ himself the church will come through justification through luther through sanctification through wesley through the baptism of the holy ghost or the pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the son of man that when the husband and wife will be the same persons who do you say this is when i want to read that to you again after you've gone through luther wesley the baptism of the holy ghost or the pentecostals and go right on in there's something beyond all of that all of that was building amen justification made a way for sanctification it's a building sanctification made a way for the baptist's holy ghost it's a building the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the person of the holy ghost himself which is the son of man he said now the pinnacles go right on into perfection of the son of man when that what is the perfection of the son of man when husband and wife will be the same self persons god will be so manifested into his bride his church that they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at my question is now do you see where we're at not what we're going to where are we at amen who do you say this is amen jesus is calling now who do you say i the son of man am amen what am i am i just a manifestation that took place in the 50s and 60s what am i amen it's it's it's husband the perfection of the son of man coming down when husband and wife become the same self persons but others don't teach it that way that's not the question but there's other reputable men who have a long time in the ministry and and we really have confidence in them they don't teach it that way that's not the question that was the first question not the second question but that's not how we understood it 10 years ago that's not the question let god ask you the question this morning who do men say that i am fair game say what all you've heard then he takes it up a notch but whom do ye say that i am now it doesn't matter anymore who says what it doesn't matter what your daddy or mommy says your husband your wife it doesn't matter what your pastor and none of that matters now in this question there's one question put to you today and if you've never saw yourself in the scriptures you're standing in the scriptures this morning you're in matthew 16. amen and there's a gift from god speaking to you saying who do you say this is you have to answer the question nobody is getting around this question in this day this is the question who do you say this is say if you can't answer the question be honest say god i need you to give me a revelation to answer that question i can only answer the first question i can't answer the second question be honest don't make it up don't pretend don't parrot somebody after the first question some say jeremiah some say a lie some say william branham some say a future manifest some say don't repeat that in the second question and the second question say if you cannot answer from your heart say god i can't answer that from my heart i need a revelation that comes from the father because when peter gave the answer amen jesus says flesh and blood never revealed that to you you didn't get it by what other people were saying or what history had told you or what you were brought up and or any of these other things you got that from god and that's the only way that we can answer the second question god see these things are real if i could express what's in my heart this isn't church this isn't church this is life you're sitting in a building you're gathered together with a group of believers but this is not about church it's not about answering a question to please somebody in these walls or satisfy your neighbor this is life friends this is the only life this is real life this is all that matters in life right now and we keep ignoring the question kicking the can down the road or whatever we're doing but it's time to say the question's been put to me and if you've never had it put to you i'm putting it to you this morning who do you say this is the son of man ministry who do you say it is and where is it did it end in 1965 does it continue if it continues where does it continue does it continue in a mystical myth form does it continue on books and tapes where did the prophet say it continued after the union that the manifestation of the son of man came to unite the head and the body together to do what to manifest the son to reveal the son of man again go to the message stop listening to what everybody else is saying this is time to shut off all the other voices of what everybody else is saying and it's time to get into the message and say god i need a revelation what did this prophet say somebody put together quotes here somebody's put together quotes over here this one's arguing with this one i i can't deal with it i gotta know for myself don't just be lazy if you're gonna take that stand then you get into the tapes go back and read your church age book go back to the seals again go listen to every message from the seals on and read the book until god reveals to you don't be lazy about it and say well you know if god wants me to know all know now he's putting the question to you if you can't answer it get the answer the answer is in the message god didn't give us the message they meant to be a cute sd card shoved into the back of our phone he gave us the message to reveal himself and reveal the hour we live in and what's going on right now so i'm asking the question who do you say this is all that we're talking about and all we're doing and gathering together sunday and wednesday listening to tapes and reading who do you say this is what is it all about is it a church that's a little bit better than the pentecostal church we've got everything finnick also had plus a little bit more now we're a correct order church it's more than that friends that's not the revelation that he brought this prophet to bring to us in this day the question's been put to you this morning don't ignore it the question has been put to you this morning don't act like you didn't hear it god knows you heard it who do you say this is answer the question if you can't answer the question that's a fair answer that's an honest answer said god right now i can't honestly answer that question god i'm going to dig into the message you gave me see sometimes friends we say well i'm just waiting for god to reveal it to me but you're waiting for god to reveal it to you but you're not getting into the word you're not reading your bible you're not listening to the message but you're saying i want god to reveal it to you and you're cutting off the very mechanism by which he brings the revelation he brought it through a prophet in this day if you want to answer the question and you need god to reveal it to you get in the tapes read the books stay in your bible stay in prayer and if you've got an honest heart god will reveal himself to you he's no respecter of persons he didn't do for peter anything different than he'll do for you i think that's much of our problem in this days we never ask to answer the question i think a lot of the problem that we have in our churches and what's called the message around the world is we have people who've been able to answer the first question but not the second question when they answer the first question they find the part of the first question that seems most plausible to them or the person who's most reputable to them and they go along with that person but they've never answered the second question who do you say this is and they're hoping because somebody else says it's this and somebody else says that that if they get in i'll get in too it doesn't work that way that may not have been what was on somebody's conscience but that's what's been laying in the subconscious somebody's been just hoping that because i find the most reputable minister in the message or i find the one with the with the seemingly the one that i agree with or suits me the best and he says it he's got the revelation and i'm going along with that and we take a lazy approach to this because we say there's so many voices it's so confusing that's what matthew 16 says he asked who do men say they are and it was confusing some say jeremiah's some say elias some say one of the other prophets it's confusing and they could say it's so confusing i can't sort it out i just throw in the towel but he asked the second question who do you say that i am and peter had caught a revelation from god almighty and that revelation told him exactly who this was if we could all get to that place so much of our problems would go away if we could all dig if we could all pray if we could all fast and be sincere with god until we get to where we can answer the second question then most of our problems would go away we need to answer both questions let's go to mark chapter 4. mark chapter 4 verse 37. and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat them to the ship so that it was now full i told you before there's no rhyme or reason this i'm just giving it free flow the way it's come to me and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awoke him and say unto him master cares thou not that we perish look at their question let's stop right here what kind of question is that to ask god in flesh the same kind of question you and i say every time a hard trial god don't you see what's happening god don't you understand i'm dying i don't think it's a good question i don't think it's the right way to phrase the question he says carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful and how is it that you have no faith he asked a question and none of them answered and it was pretty good that they didn't answer i say this is one of those questions you don't you just don't open your mouth lord he's in the ship and brother baby said that's the type of the church today he's in the ship he's with us he's here and storms come storms will come storms have come storms are coming brother brennan says he says the stabilizers have been put on the ship why do you put stabilizers on the ship because big storm waves are coming the stabilizers have been put on the ship but shall crest every wave so there's prophecy that storms are coming and and now the storm comes and when the storm comes they forget that they're with a man who can multiply bread and fish they forget that they're with a man who could open blinded eyes they forget they listen the next storm that comes they forget that there's a man in our midst a man who can turn on the light that can heal joe from a lesion on his roof they forget the next storm that comes they forget that there was somebody here that could heal bernie for five years of constant pain but the next trial that comes are saying lord don't you see don't you care and they say wake up how is it that you're afraid do you forget the loaves in the face did you forget the blind man did you forget have you forgotten amen what we talked about at the beginning of service when the testimonies have read of the multiple healings and deliverance and amen and all the provisions that god make for us how is it when we go from the from the prayer from the testimony to the prayer request from the time we read the end of the testimony till we start the prayer request we become fearful is he on the boat is he in our midst is the son of man here has he healed has he delivered has he healed supernaturally over and over and over again if that's the case the next time your boat's swamped and your sails are torn and the mast is broke you have no right to get scared brother i'm just saying what jesus said i'm not listen i'm with you i'm the same one who has to say it's okay i'm not scared it's okay i'm not scared the outer man amen has to be brought into subjection to the inner man the other man begins to get nervous and begins to ring their hands and because they know house is going to work out but the inner man the faith seat has to rise up and say he's done it before he'll do it again it's promised in his word he's here with me i'm not alone he's watching over me there's nothing for me to be afraid of so i think jesus question is a valid question and i want to ask it this morning for whatever situation you're in whether it's family situations health situation financial situation if you're nervous about the political situation or the country situation i want to ask you this question why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith it's a good question that's a question that hits me right between the eyes why are you so fearful why why immediately when your child's 10 minutes late getting home you immediately think of sirens and lights and hospital beds and why can't you see a picture of angels encompassing around their vehicle bringing them safely home who gives that thought of the ambulance in the hospital bed where does that come from that's the one that needs to be rejected you say but it's natural for a mother to do that jesus didn't think so jesus thought a believer it's natural of course it's natural but we're not natural beings we're supernatural beings we've been born again we've been awakened to the reality all around us we know we have a heavenly father who watches over us we know that he hears us when we pray we know that our footsteps are ordered we know that no trial comes unless it first crossed god's desk so why are we so fearful i say god help us forgive us for being so quick to forget what you've done forgive us to be so quick to forget how supernaturally you've delivered us guided us freed us healed us spoke to us you name it he's done it forgive us lord help us to have faith help us to believe when the world is falling apart help us to believe when everything is coming undone and the waves are crashing over help us to not take that spirit of fear because fear is a spirit help us not take that spirit of fear but help us to remember who's in the boat and the one that's laying in the boat is the one that supernaturally healed joe he's the one who delivered me the one who delivered brother bernie he's the one who delivered you and he's the one who saved you he's the one who brought you to the message he's the one who opened your eyes he's the one who saved your children he's the one he's the same one and he's still here this is a good question this morning i want to ask you the question this morning why are you so fearful i said before this might apply to one tenth of a percent of the congregation but why are you so fearful it applies to you ask yourself the question why am i so fearful why am i so fearful and why am i always so sure that everything's going to go wrong why shouldn't i have faith in god that everything's going to work out perfect the way he wants it to work out and all things are working together for good let's go to luke 24. luke 24 13. and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three score furlongs and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them and their eyes were holding that they should not know him and mark it says he appeared to them in another form here comes jesus in flesh in their day the resurrected ministry of jesus christ he draws along these two disciples amen but they don't know him they don't recognize him he's appearing in another form or 17. and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad okay i'll just repeat what i repeated before did he need the information he wanted them to declare out of their mouth where they were and the one of them whose name was cleopas answered and said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and has not known the thing which have come to pass there in these days he was speaking to the king of jerusalem and asking if he was a stranger in jerusalem and he said unto them what things [Laughter] you have to love the bible friends what things you know it would be amazing to have this dialogue with god and you're praying in your prayer everything that's going wrong in your life oh god you know that the the neighbor has done this and work's done this and the children done this and god it's so bad and everything's so terrible and i got so many problems and god says what problems well it's this one and this one and this one and what problems what things and as you begin to express them you realize who you're talking to he already knows he knows how to fix him he knows a solution he knows what you're going through and he knows how to deliver you he's just waiting for you to have enough faith to believe that'll take care of every one of those problems and he says and he said unto them what things and they said in them concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed in word before god and all the people and how the chief priest and our ruler delivered him to the to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted they used to believe they were trusting they're not trusting anymore we trust did here's the problem this is why he asked them the question he wanted them to expose where they were and in his explanation they begins to expose right where they're at but we had trusted now we're disappointed what we believe didn't come to pass amen when i were confused and we had trusted it had been him and he says but we trusted that it had been he which would have redeemed israel beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yea and certain women also of our company made us astonish which were early at the sepulcher and when they found nada's body they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not listen listen listen they have all the information they need to believe they're speaking the truth but not catching the reality and i say that's what we've been doing in the message for years we've been speaking all the facts and all that and not missing how they all go together amen they're saying we believed it was him that would redeem us he was redeeming them on calvary he said some of the women went to the sepulcher and saw vision of angels they didn't see a vision of angels they saw angels and the angels told him that he's not here he's risen and then some of our company went to the deceptor and they see it even as they had said then watch your problem that's the next question what's the problem i mean brother branham said that this mighty angel would descend and that with a clothe with a cloud with a rainbow over his head with an open book in his hand this angel will descend which is nothing more than christ amen and the seventh church age messenger will be here at the time of this coming [Music] we thought we thought the coming of the lord's going to happen when the prophet was here you've got all the facts you've got all the facts what's the problem there is no problem you're saying it but you're not realizing what you're saying they were saying it they had the truth and they were stumbling over the manifestation of the hour because it didn't fit what they had already computed amen they had already analyzed and computed and had an idea of how the prophecy would be fulfilled and when it took a turn and went differently than what they expected now all of a sudden they're confused and there's nothing to be confused about the women saw an angel the angel said he's not here he's risen brothers went and confirmed what they said was the truth what's the problem the mighty angel did descend christ his coming did take place at the time the seventh church age messenger was on earth there was a manifestation of the son of man and there is a son of man ministry currently going on there's no problem there's nothing to be disheartened about there's no reason to have trusted keep believing amen everything is ticking just right on time it's all perfect they they come and they they they they're they're testifying to him of the truth everything they're saying fits everything he said what they're what they're speaking as a problem is the confirmation of what he's already said it's the evidence that he told the truth and they're speaking the things that they think are problems not realizing it's no problem it's a confirmation of what he already said i hope you have your spiritual jackets on said certain of them verse 24 again which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them o fools and slow heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken you believed but you didn't believe all you caught a part of it and you ran off and painted your own picture but you didn't catch it all ought not christ to have suffered these things and to have entered into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded into them all the scriptures the things concerning himself what a question what are you talking about as you go along and are so sad why yeah i'll put it this way why are the message believers after the fulfillment of the promise so down-hearted why are you so sad don't you know we're in a holding period waiting waiting for what but we thought this and this and this needs to happen everything you're talking about fits the prophecy you're not waiting start walking get caught up get resurrected out of dead denominationalism and denominational thinking and get lifted up into the mind of christ to see all things are being fulfilled let's go to john chapter 20. we'll end with this one john chapter 20. verse 14. john 20 and 14. and when she had thus turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus this was mary and knew not that it was jesus jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seek us thou she's supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and i will take him away jesus said in her mary she turned herself and saith in him rabboni which is to say master jesus asked another good question he asked a question that at the grave there's an empty tomb now and mary is distraught because they've taken the she supposes taking the lord's body here comes a gardener a gardener's like a husbandman kind of like a preacher like a pastor and he shows up as the gardener and he says to her why are you weeping who are you looking for whom seek us thou and the one that she was looking for was standing there speaking to her but she didn't recognize him because he was in another form now he was resurrected in his resurrection he's always coming in another form now he's resurrected and coming to her in another form and she's supposing to him to be the gardener it's just it's not like he's not got a you know some disguise on she knew him intimately she saw him day by day he's appearing in another form and he says why are you crying this should be the hour of rejoicing why are you crying who are you looking for who are you looking for i'm looking for the lord i'm looking for where they laid him i'm looking for a past tense jesus i went to where he was last and i can't find him where is he where have you taken him where can i go and where can i find him and here he was in his resurrection ministry in another form speaking to her he didn't say here i am here i am he called her by name he called mary and when he called mary she recognized who it was she said rabboni which means master see in this hour we could be mourning over what had taken place mourning mourning the fact that you know all the the dynamic ministry of the prophet it's ended i mean that was jesus christ in that man oh i wish he was here i wish listen he's here nothing's changed he's in another form i just wish i could where's his body oh even i'll even stay with the dead body because i don't know where else to go i'll go back to the previous brother branham said that previous part of the stalk as it comes up to stalk the toss so everything after the seed has to die everything previous has to die be dead and she's she doesn't know where to go so she's willing to go back to the dead but jesus is always life not death he's always moving with the life and here he was alive resurrected standing talking to her but she didn't expect him in a different form in fact she didn't expect him alive at all she expected him in that ministry and that ministry is now over we saw him in that ministry now that ministry's over that ministry is dead and now we're going to take care of the body and and maybe whitewash the tomb and paint some things around it and wait for something else to happen we don't know what and mourn that that's over because she she didn't know what to look for she didn't know what she was supposed to see she had missed the things that he was saying and now he's standing there talking to her in another form jesus himself not another jesus jesus himself but in another form and she just wants to know where the body's at where can i go back and worship where can i go back and he does something special he calls her by name when he calls her name something in her wakes up and now she knows she knows who she's looking for the one that she desires is the one that's speaking to her and i say the one that you and i desire is the one that's speaking to us he's speaking out of his word amen he's opening his word and he's speaking love words to us the one we're looking for is the one who's speaking to us he's in another form but he's still here brother branham says in questions and answers on the seals he said all that's in the book holds that mystery the book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names you understand that now see the book doesn't say now leave fails to be saved in this church age ormond never or whoever know it don't say that it just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is now i'm saying it's revealing the mystery while it's calling the names so as it's revealing the mystery it's calling you and revealing the mystery is calling you it's calling your name not not chad and not larry not bob not susie not any of these names it's calling the real you down on the inside it's giving the revelation of the mystery peeling back the mystery of god peeling back the mystery of christ and something in you says i reckon that's it that's me he's calling me i'm coming to him and she said master it's you oh and this day i want to ask you a question who are you looking for who are you looking for who are you looking for and what do you expect to see i'll tell you be looking for the one that can break the mystery and call your name look for the one that can open something up that that draws you and says that's the truth that's me that's my identity that's who i am that's the lord amen it's the lord that's calling me somebody will come to church and hear a preacher somebody will come and hear the lord somebody will hear a man speak a couple thousand words amen and get a little bit hoarse amen and then they'll go home and say those were good words and that that was neat how that come together but somebody else will go beyond the horse voice somebody else will go beyond the vessel standing in the pulpit and they'll say god was talking to me god was asking me questions god was identifying where i was at and god was calling my name he's here the son of man the ministry of jesus christ himself is here it's in the bride amen there's a fightful ministry preaching out the word he's here he's calling is he calling you who are you looking for as we finish this morning i want to leave with that question and don't make it for anybody else who do you seek whom seekest thou are you looking for a church you're looking for a good minister are you looking for a better condition in life are you looking for some some easier path are you looking for something that satisfies and tantalizes the intellect or what whom are you seeking if you're seeking him and if you're truly seeking him he'll come to you but don't worry if it's in another form just listen for that identification the way he calls your name the familiar resonance in your heart that warmness that that something that tugs it says that's him that's him he's the one who's calling me tell you so many people are missing where he's at because they're they don't know what to look for they're looking for where he was they were all looking for where he was and that tomb was empty they're all trying to go back to where he was and they're missing where he is and he was speaking to her in the form of a gardener he was in another form and he appeared to the two in the road to emmaus and begin and every time amen we begin to speak to them he began to call their name and he began to break the word amen in the breaking of the word their eyes would become open they begin to recognize who this is and what this is and if you don't understand his resurrection ministry in his resurrection ministry he comes in another form and when he comes in another form he begins to break the word and as he breaks the word your eyes come open he calls your name you recognize who this is so as we leave i ask the question whom seeketh thou whom seek us thou and how will you know when you find him she was looking for the last vessel he was in but now he was in another form and she was missing it so in order for her not to miss it he called her by name intimately said mary so you and i wouldn't miss it he calls you he calls you so you won't miss it because it's easy to miss it's easy to miss the world's missing it friends it's they missed it and brother branham they were missing it when jesus was standing on the earth they missed it in the apostles when they come out of the upper room it's easy to miss but what are you seeking whom seeketh thou and how do you know when you found him who are you looking for what what will be the indication you found him oh i say listen for the one who's calling your name listen for the one who's saying i'm here it's me don't be afraid come to me don't look at the vessel look at the son of man look at the one who's asking the question whom seek us down he's here he's here he's here to call your name he's here to identify himself to his disciples he's here to break the word he's here amen to starting at moses and preaching the whole bible to explain himself he's still here and he's still doing that i said let's recognize who's in our midst then let's all stand that was all i had musicians if you come like if you'll come let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you god that you've called my name god when i was in denominationalism stuck in a system that i'd been raised in you sent a vessel to me lord and it wasn't what i expected to see i wanted you i was looking for you but i had no idea that this one that come to me was you in another form but god in your mercy you began to break open your word you begin to explain the scriptures and show all that must be done in the last days and all the prophecies that must be fulfilled god as you broke the bread you opened my eyes you called my name the one that i was seeking came to me i didn't know how to go to you i didn't know how to find you but you came to me in another form in the form of a brother and that brother began to share what was in his heart as he shared you begin to stir what was in my heart you begin to call me lord through this ministry through the bribe through the messages that your prophet preached you begin to call me well the question you asked me was who do you say this is oh god i thank you for the revelation that come now i pray for everyone that's hearing this lord somewhere along the line today you've asked them a question you've asked many questions some may have hit one certain ones and some others but lord you asked the question i know this was your leading lord i know this was the direction you gave for i had no other direction i know you're asking questions this morning lord because you're trying to open eyes lord you're trying to get us to answer the question not to give you information but for our eyes to come open and where we are god i pray that you give us revelation upon revelation upon revelation open the eyes call by name lord your children bring your seed to yourself lord by calling their names breaking the bread of life by asking the questions i pray that nothing would hinder lord should move away every obstacle that we would continue to grow more like you day by day we would surrender in a greater way lord that we would judge ourselves when we'd have time to pray and you ask us a question lord may we answer it may we be able to identify where we are draw us lord keep us coming closer we love you father we thank you for your word we ask all that you would just continue to woo your bride calling them identifying them bringing them out bringing them up to higher ground step by step revelation by revelation may we begin to fly in the heavenlies lord see things the way you see them we commit the service to your hands we commit your people to your hands and i ask god that this word that's went out today will accomplish exactly what you determined for it to accomplish that the devil will not snatch it away from your children but lord that it'll go and it will root around in the hearts and lives of your children your elect it'll bring to pass your intended purpose lord you didn't bring a message just for us to say it was a good message you brought your word lord to change our lives you brought your word to awaken us to give us eyes to see our condition to give us a call to say lord save me help me forgive me draw me god i pray that word would have its intended effect this morning we ask your blessings on it in jesus christ's name amen bless you blake he is [Music] i will bless his name again [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's here can touch him you will never [Music]
