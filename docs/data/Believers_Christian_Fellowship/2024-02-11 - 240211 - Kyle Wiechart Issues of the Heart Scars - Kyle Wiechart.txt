amazing Lord we've all been a benefactor and a recipient of that amazing Grace nothing we did nothing we've ever done right we're just good at failing just good at making mistakes but it was an amazing G Grace it was you who came to us we didn't come looking for you you came to us father I'm so thankful from the depths of my heart I know I'm with a people that are so thankful from the depths of their heart and so father God I just pray that You' take this little time as we turn our eyes towards you father help us to express our love that we we have to you because you've expressed it so often to us father I pray that you would bless us each and every one both young and old May father God we hear from you as we often do sometimes in just a still Small Voice God hiding himself in Simplicity father you you still reveal yourself that way and I'm so thankful that you do because I'm simple I needed something simple to get a hold of me so father God I pray that you would do that which only you can do take the word discern our hearts speak to our hearts and feed our souls father give strength to the weary give sight to the blind Lord you're still the same God yesterday today and forever so Lord we commit ourselves to you in this service and all the words that would be said may it be pleasing in thine ears in Jesus name amen amen God bless you all thank you musicians I sure appreciate that I didn't think I was going to hear Brother Emanuel and somehow it's a miracle I heard brother Emanuel so did you hear Brother Emanuel am I hearing things I heard him I my expectations were lowered and now they're higher all of a sudden so and God bless you all it's good to be here let you have your seats for just a moment get myself relaxed if that's okay uh I get nervous I just get nervous all the time and you would think I'd get over that I just can't seem to get over that and and um I'm not the same man that was here the last time you know I had a birthday I'm 40 I'm old thank you thank you it's like uh congratulations you made it to the pulpit good job out of you you know you didn't get lost along the way you got enough strength to stand um they used to say 50s over the hill but I don't know how that math Works he said 70 and 80 was strength so my math is right I'm going downhill now so so you pray for me I may get tired I may forget my words forget my thoughts but you just be praying for me uh just wanted to say how much I love you and I appreciate you um I was thinking about yesterday I was like you know I I get to thinking about the attributes of God you know as a kid I was like oh if I could just be with the people that you know I knew that they loved God and and I knew that they were God's chosen people how wonderful it would be to just be a part of them you know just to be with them not that I think I would add anything to you I know I'm a net negative I probably take away but it's always been um a a great desire of me to just be with a a people that love God and um I believe I am I believe I am I was getting to thinking about different faces you know in different names and I was thinking oh my that quality of Christ that I see in that person you know that that patience of of job sometimes or that Joy sister Joyce not saying any names but nonetheless the joy of the Lord or some of those different characters and those characteristics of Christ that's amongst the body and and you all are just making up that body of the body of Christ with all of those wonderful characteristics and and it's been a tremendous honor for me to be able to be a part of that body and um sometimes you can maybe uh get too focused on what we don't have and then you can get down and often times you got to stop thinking about what you don't have and start considering what you do have and then it gets real special to you you know and so we we need one another I know that now more than ever before that every one of us that's in the body is necessary we all are going to need each other even more as the evil day is approaching I believe that's why the Lord said draw yourselves together assemble yourselves together even more cuz we're going to find out we need all of us every one of us is necessary and needed and I know that I'm perfecting you and I know you're perfecting me and I think that's just all part of the plan the great mystery secret that God had in his mind he's still building up masterpieces and uh I'm just so thankful for that so I have a I have a lot of um not well organized thoughts woohoo nothing new there um but I so I just I just pray you'd help me to just deliver my heart my soul um lot of inspiration it's amazing to me amount of inspiration I went outside for a walk and then Carrie had to call me she's like where are you I'd been walking around in a circle for an hour and 45 minutes just lost in a thought and um it that was what um I made me go this direction I thought I would I brother Chad called me Thursday and I think brother Brian we were talking you I thought he asked me Wednesday night he says you know um you going to minister on that thought for the Youth I said yeah I think so but some reason I'm having this inspiration before service start writing down notes that's how it works for me and I said so I'm a little nervous now all of a sudden maybe I'm not supposed to Minister that to youth maybe I don't know I have to pray about it and then brother Chad calls the next day I says well maybe I couldn't say no cuz I was like uhoh I had inspiration scary it's scary and inspiration is such a weird thing ministers know it it's it's it's not something you produce it's not something it's like it comes out of you and you just got to write it down it's it's such like a I think like a person who writes a song it's it's not like you're trying to construct a song it's like it's you're just capturing the song you're just trying to write it down and and deliver it the way God gave it to you and that's kind of the same way with me I just get this inspiration and I get a feeling and I I write down some notes and it's like a generalized Direction with absolutely no detail which scares me to death um and and that's that's just how it works and I um I always believed that the sons of God are just led by the spirit of God they're not real well organized they're just spirit-led and I I I I believe that's part of a maturing son is just resting in the fact that God is leading and guiding his children you know we were predestinated unto adoption and I'm my my message is not adoption today well it probably is to a part but um but when I was thinking about that predestinated there's an end point I'm coming to a place that he predetermined that I was going to come to despite myself and he let you make so many mistakes along the way and it's all part of the plan he can't take away your free moral agency he lets you make decisions and sometimes those decisions are bad decisions just like Abraham he was supposed to stay in the land and then a famine came and he goes down to guer but it all fit the plan God was going to get his man right where he needed him to be at just the right time and what the devil intends for evil God works it all for good so then we can just rest say Thank you lord it's an amazing grace that started this work and it's an amazing grace it's going to bring me to the maturity of a son and so I feel a little bit more relaxed why don't you stand now amen hope that's okay if you only knew how nervous I get it's horrible it's a torture would you turn in your Bibles to proverbs 4 proverbs 4 and you you're going to love me if we go all over the place right you're still going okay I needed to hear it I need to hear these things um because we will be Proverbs 4: 20 going to read two portions of scripture it says my son attend to my words and incline thine ear unto my sayings let them not depart from thine eyes and keep them in the midst of thine heart for the for they are life unto those that find them and they are Health to all their flesh keep thy heart with all diligence for or out of it are the issues of life now please turn in your Bibles to Ecclesiastes chapters 3 verse 1 just say Amen when you're there am the word of God says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose Under the Sun a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones stones and a time to gather Stones together A Time To Remember of embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate and a time of war and a time of peace what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he labor Earth I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it he hath made everything beautiful in his time you may have your seats may God add His blessings to the word so the last time that I actually ministered from EES eclesiastes was middle of Co and I was thinking of that and uh this uh I just got drawn back to this again and you know that was a time where uh I think it was a good testing time for each and every one of us our American rights were being tested and we were uh struggling I was struggling with the fact that what do you mean I can't assemble with the Saints what do you mean I I got to put on a mask what do you mean this uh social distancing the very word of it puts Terror into our heart social distancing you know all of these things became a a prevalent test of my will and uh at the time I I was meditating on that I was like you don't have a right to tell me this stuff you going to tell I'm a Christian we we are the sons and daughter of God if we want to assemble if we want to hug if we want to not wear a mask who are you to tell us then I came across the quote and brother brandham says you know a lamb forfeits all its rights he said real Lambs forfeit their rights we have rights nobody can deny them but the lamb forfeits its rights as American you have rights but we're not Americans we're Christians our kingdom is from above and so we know the nature of the Lamb if it's present forfeits its rights and that's where I had come across this scripture and at that time it was a real check for me I thought oh my I've been wrong I was wrong I was exercising my American rights and denying my Christian rights because my rights get forfeited that's the plan and it's just you're you're just never going to separate a cross from Christianity it's a constant bearing the cross and I think as time goes on it becomes something that it comes from something that's like you don't want to Bear the cross to something you you embrace you you you hug it up a little closer to you uh and you begin to learn to love the very thing um that draws you to him and at this time I was considering this time to Rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak and that was a time where um I think I had I had thought taken a thought where um the bride's time to stand yeah that's what it was and uh boy I wanted to say something but sometimes when you want to say something you need to learn to be quiet and then there's times when uh you you want to be quiet and it's time to say something and I think that's just the part of learning to walk as a Son of God and just learning to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and um in considering all of these things I had a subject that I'd like to discuss and I titled it the issues of the heart issues of the heart and as a subtitle scars and um I'm not a rocket scientist by any means but I I kind of have a feeling I shared it with brother Ben I think God's doing heart surgery for each and every one of us I hope I'm not the only one that's going through this I've began to notice here in the last few months that um God's going deep he's going real deep and going into some doors that maybe we all shut and uh we didn't want to have exposed you know we want God to save us brother bam said we want him to save us but we don't want him to get in messing with our private life we got all these little doors in our heart that he we don't want God to get in there Pride selfishness you know all those things don't go in there Lord I want you to save me but I really don't want you to be Lord see Lord has rulership and dominion over every aspect of it and and it's been pretty safe to say um I think heart surgery's been happening here lately for each and every one of us and it certainly has for me and uh so I could identify with brother Ben I sent him a text I said hey if you're going to get a a cardboard cut out just get a two for one deal grab one for me that'll be fine I can sit there with you because I was indicted too and sometimes you just got to take the punches right brother Ben and I found it interesting cuz the last time I was talking here on that last step of adoption was I said it's painful it's just painful it's hard nobody wants to be hurt nobody wants to expose wounds nobody wants to go to some something that you may be trying to cover up it's just painful and uh we all have scars right I hope I'm not the only one I've got scars I got one I'm looking at right now my wonderful dog that I just had to put down sadly bit me he left me a gift a few years ago I think I even mentioned it here it's the one scar that I have and I can see it now I appreciate him he left me a gift to remind me of how Wonder wonderful of a dog he was I think I talked about it here we got him at the pound we thought he was three we found out he was like seven or eight we thought he could bark he couldn't bark found out his teeth are falling out his hips are caving in he can't walk I and then he bit me and I'm like you're not adding any value to my life you're a net negative you're taking away after you bit me I'm like do you not realize like I rescued you you would have been put to sleep by now if I wouldn't have come on the scene nobody wants a old worn out dog except us we got an old worn out dog but I you know I was considering this Scar and when I had spoke on it here that scar came as a result of me him biting me um when I was I was trying to help him out the poor fella bad hips old worn out trying to move him over closer to the furnace cuz he was by the door and he bit me and I got furious at that dog he latched down on my hand wouldn't let go I'm yelling at him I might have been tapping him on the head a little bit just please let go of me sorry for those who really love animals I it was I it wasn't conscious it was a reaction you know he finally let go and uh and I thought you dirty dog you I'm trying to help you I was sincere I was trying to drag him over to where it was warmer and he was laying on his bed and and I I really felt justified in what I was doing and then I got to thinking about him and I was like ah you know what that poor guy we know he was beaten we know he was mistreated as a dog cuz he never trusted me ever well yeah never trust barely trusted Carrie kind of like the girls but he was always nervous you move make a move he would cow maybe show his teeth a little bit he just something was wrong he had been wounded in earlier in life and he was cautious around any man he just you're going to hurt me too I know how this goes and uh so you know I got the feeling like he was feeling I was like you know what I invaded his space I tried to help him and he's like you know what this is the only place I feel safe in my little bed and here I am I'm trying to help him out but I didn't realize he just didn't trust me and he bit me so then I was like Wow poor guy I got to feeling the way he felt and uh it's just interesting we have scars in our lives I got scars but I there's lessons from scars every scar that you go through in life not just natural but spiritual scars then there's lessons to be learned in them and um you know when when the Bible says here there's a season there's a time in our life there's times where it's good and there's times when it's just not good there's sunny days and there's cloudy days don't be shocked that's part of a plan um I've I've had many times where God was close I've I've had many times where he seemed so far away I've had times where I felt I had great victory in my life and then there's other times I felt like I am just a miserable failure good for nothing I should just find a bridge I'm human if I I hope I hope that doesn't sound too crazy that's legitimate amen um I've often had that I I I don't add value I'm not creating help I if I'm not helping any what I'm wasting space you feel like that sometimes and um and then the question is it's like why do you feel like that what makes a person feel that way you know um Jeremiah says the hardest deceitfully Wicked Above All Things desperately wicked and who can know it who can know it do you know who knows it I don't know your heart nobody else in here knows your heart God knows your heart amen there's one that knows my heart yeah there's only one that's qualified to do heart surgery that's Jesus Christ that's the word of God because Hebrews says the word of God is quick and it's powerful sharper than a two-edged sword a piercing and a dividing aend of the soul and the spirit of the joints and the marrow and he's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart that's what cuts me that's what cuts me and so a few weeks ago when brother Chad was preaching the twin Within was I the only one that was cut oh my goodness I will be honest honest I was smoked so hard in my heart I was smoked I was cut wide open because my failure at times is I'm able and we all are good at this we're able to identify Esau's and others at the same time avoiding your own it's true it's easy to see the two natures many times you've seen it in me I mean I if Paul says oh Wretched Man that I am who are we to boast like we are nothing oh my goodness we think we're that great you are nothing if the grace I'll tell you what if the grace of God hadn't come my way I promise you promise you I promise you I wouldn't have a family and I would probably be on the brink of insanity I would be self-medicating myself to the point of maybe even gone and I'm not making that up that is 100% the direction I was going 100% And if it wasn't for the grace in your life you would too you would totally be out of your mind in this crazy age that we live in so I have so much compassion for those that are around like what do you expect the world to do in this insane age that we're living in don't get upset because they're self-medicating give them some medicine of the Gospel maybe that will help them I don't know but my goodness I certainly don't look down upon someone that drinks themselves to sleep every night just to cope through life amen cuz you shouldn't feel like you shouldn't feel any better than that but by the grace of God there go I and there go you right faster than a plane can cut through the sky that's just a reality and so I was so smoked in my heart CU I had failed I had failed and I want to say this cuz it's it's been on my mind for a long time Jesus said I shared it with brother Jeremy the Bible says if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me and I got to thinking about this a year or so ago I I I don't know a couple years ago I says you know what how was he lifted up before all men on a cross he was lifted up on a cross and nobody put it on nobody put him on that he chose it himself he said no one takes my life from me I Lay My Life down for others and when they lifted him up on the cross that so inspired a people what looked to be a great we'll say defeat was actually the greatest victory that had ever been seen a man had the capability to deliver himself didn't a man who could have defend himself chose not to a man who could have changed the scene with one little finger said no I'm not going to do it but he did it for you and for me he didn't do it without a reason he had a reason in doing it oh yeah he had somebody on his mind it was me and so I began to think of that lifting up on a cross and brother brandham says he'll lift her up to show she had the goods and I've often thought about that you know none of us we always want to think it's going to be a glorious thing it's going to be wonderful it's going to be fantastic I'm going to look great you're going to look great everybody's going to know we are the sons of God you know what's beautiful in the eyes of God is horrendous in the eyes of men it didn't look like a beautiful Victory there with a mangled up face and blood running all over him stripped naked and humiliated and it didn't look like a great Victory but brother B said it was the most Sublime thing in history when a bloody lamb came and took the book amen most Sublime thing in history and so I I think if we're going to rule and reign with him I think we're going to have to know as he knows as Paul said that I may know him and the fellowship of his sufferings and that I may be conformed into the image of his dear son and so as I've looked at this I realized oh oh my goodness I failed you as a people often times I find and I can see so clearly something that's wrong I can see it I'm like that's wrong and little did I know you can see me and say that's wrong but we have that ability and instead of doing what I'm supposed to do and the scripture says if you see a brother in awe or fault you who are spiritual right brother Gage you're spiritual go to such a one and talk to him sorry this is rubber meat's Road for a moment Lord and um you're not spiritual because you can identify a problem and tell everybody about it don't make you spiritual what makes you spiritual is you have the maturity and love of God in your heart for that man and for God to be able to go to him and just say can we talk that's spiritual that's a real spiritual brother not to be able to point fingers but to go help somebody and I began to point fingers and that's where I failed and I had to make some things right I had to call some brothers up and uh say I was wrong please forgive me listen to brother Chad's you know this twin within it's okay brother Chad I'm sorry I'm just being honest that twin within and and I'm like oh my goodness I couldn't see my own twin I couldn't see that Esau in me gee and for months I've been looking at the two Spirits so close it would deceive the elect of God if it was possible and you know who can deceive you greater than anybody else it's you you can deceive yourself like nobody ever could deceive yourself you begin to thinking you're pretty good I'm something like brother Ben I think Mary Magdalene she think she's pretty pretty yeah I am pretty pretty now I don't think I'm pretty pretty but you know that brother Brian we ain't pretty just being honest everybody knows that we ain't pretty but sometimes you get to thinking I'm doing pretty good I'm not too bad God let me see some things and he's if I see things and that brother doesn't see I must have favor with God you know I'm something and I ain't nothing amen it's just a trap just a trap make you think you're something and so confession was good for the soul you make things right when you do wrong and because I realized if I love someone right if I love them the right way I'll I'll go to them but if I love myself more than the brother I'll say nothing I'll sit back and say he's off right it's just not right amen I mean we're going to like brother Ben said if we're the Bride of Jesus Christ better act like it yeah don't sit back here and say look at me look at me I'm the bride I'm the bride just don't say nothing let's see it in action let's see it in action had John Wesley on my mind where he was saying you know he went to he was going to bring the gospel to the natives here in America and he left a failure tail between his legs he knew he hadn't he didn't have anything to offer him and he saw some Arabians there storm raging you know he's afraid for his life and I don't think he heard a sermon he looked over and he saw those Moravian children and mothers happy Not Afraid nothing he's like they got something real they don't got words they got a life they got something real that Expresses in the midst of Storms and I'm convinced God brings some storms sometimes real solid storms just just to shake you up see if you got what you think you got amen really you need that we don't need to be told how great we are I need to be told How Far We've fallen short and if it wasn't for his grace we got nothing to stand on so I uh I told you I'm all over here we go I'm on pivot I had a uh here's what's so odd to me um about five years ago I started having really bad back pain only some brothers know and I I shoot a pain when I'd go to stand up shoot pain when I'd sit down and I couldn't run no more if I go to run my back would hurt so bad I mean for two days I could barely move you know just bad couldn't lift real well couldn't you I go to turn and pick up my I could barely pick up Ellie I strained to pick her up during service that was about 5 years ago and I'd started wasting a bunch of money going to a a lot of different chiropractors and trying a lot of different things and nothing seemed to fix it and uh so odd about this was brother Elmer was tell me about a chiropractor a few weeks ago hope stay with me there's a meaning behind it amen I told you I'm weird and um I went over to that chiropractor and he spent an hour and a half with me which is a shocker you you don't usually see that someone that actually cares um but he wasn't there to do a quick fix and try to treat a symptom he really wanted to find why what's the problem here why is your lower back a problem why is your neck a problem why are you having knee pain started doing a bunch of checks like a good doctor does to diagnose the case and he got down he says had me take off my shirt he was going to look at everything he said what's wrong with your rib cage I said I have no idea and he says well you got a bulge like a muscle bulge and I said well that's where I have these spasms you know I was told I went to the hospital when I was a kid I was told those are muscle lung spasms he says there is no such thing as a muscle lung spasm he said you mean a diaphragm spasm I said I think I don't know that's what they told me he said that's a diaphragm P he said I've done this 20 years I ain't never seen this and he says huh he said well don't be upset he said we can fix this he said that's why your back and neck's messed up I go you serious like I have these spasms every year he said yeah he said I told him what happened I was a kid I was lifting a bunch of stuff heavy we bued up a bunch of concrete with Dad and I was loading it out and every day we did this we hauled it to a dump we didn't was before Bobcats we didn't have the money for that we just did it by hand and and I ripped that diaphragm muscle or partially tore the my diaphragm in my chest from lifting those heavy concrete and they took me to the hospital I couldn't breathe or nothing and um ever since then about once a year I get a spasm because it's a weak spot and I can't breathe because it's like a charlie horse in your chest a lot of fun and um he goes okay he says this makes sense now he goes all right he says see what happened was you were wounded as a kid down here real deep and your body to protect that weakness that sore spot it sent a bunch of nutrients there to rebuild it but it it kept doing it to cover up the space you build up too much scar tissue and you've got so much Scar Tissue built up here in your chest that it's literally pulling somehow it's pulling the muscles which is causing your vertebrae to be out of line constantly that's why he said they can go pop you in and you get pulled out immediately I was like well this is amazing I said what do we do he said we rip it apart he said it's painful I said do what you got to do so it made me lay on my belly and full grown heavy man makes me take in a deep breath expose those rib cage he starts jamming his hands down where that scar tissue is where that rib cage is and he's trying to rip it apart but it was the only way to solve the problem and you know what's weird it worked I literally have no back pain went skiing last week no back pain none zero zilch amazing so all this while I thought that this symptom in me this lower back pain and neck pain was uh that was the problem wasn't the problem right it was just a symptom of a deeper problem and the reality of it is in our life we have deep pains that cause us sometimes to act wrong do things wrong say things wrong treat people wrong and you want to somebody may say that's a simp no it it or that's the cause it's not the cause that's the symptom of something deeper than that and in this life we just there's there's lots of wounds we have lots of scars and we bear many pains sometimes things happen to you when you were a kid things people treated you certain way acted a certain way said something to you there's lots and lots of ways to get scarred up inside the heart deep wounds family problems anybody have family problem me and you brother Gabe family problems left little scars little wounded spots that I covered them up you just cover them up disappointments anybody in here been disappointed you thought your life was going to go this way and for some reason it went this way right big disappointments it's amazing criticism anybody love criticism ever been criticized said ah you'll never amount to anything ah good for nothing yeah nobody likes criticism rejected rejection complexes news flash I got one that's right yes ever been insulted ever been mocked ever been physically and verbally abused it's wounds deep Cuts they hurt you know where you get most of these wounds from the ones you love the most right where did Jesus get his wounds in the house of his friends that's where your deepest wounds come from right a close a mother a father a best friend situation at a church a fellowship with people you love that you would give your life for and something happens okay way too quiet any amens okay good I'm like I'm going to hide if nobody says amen but these wounds all serve a purpose I wonder how many times I have oh so many times so many times hundreds and hundreds of times I have sat alone and said why' that have to happen why' it have to go that way why did I do that why did I say that why didn't I do this why didn't I do that so many regrets so many situations that they kind of tilt you in a certain way and you wonder why you keep walking that way why you keep acting that way you don't even know sometimes right right like why did I why did my back hurt well something way down deep from years ago amen it just needed to be dealt with you know brother brandham said he said I have some scars from when I was a kid I know some things that had happened and it turned me and in a certain way but you see it was all God right making and molding me for this present hour we all sat and listened to the life story of brother brandom a couple weeks ago we saw the Deep scars and the effects it had on him yeah I mean if half of that would came your way we would have probably succeeded in blowing out our brains that's right and that's a reality of it so much pain so so much pain he said uh he said I've went through so much he said my heart has just got scars all over it Lord from so many hard battles I'm an old veteran Lord help me I need help that's right he said maybe all of this was for a purpose and I trust that it has been Lord but help me 1962 your prophet of God end of a sermon crying out for help no he had been really really cut up really hurt having a hard time staying on the battlefield saying Lord help me if you don't help me I can't do this welcome to being a Christian everybody this is just part of the Christian Life brother b or the Bible says oh I want to yeah David he says about David he says and when he had removed him he raised him up there a David to be king whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David a son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will and that's what I was doing on Wednesday I started writing down I was so drawn to David I just started writing down David's life and in looking at David's life a man who was called and anointed to be king went through so much pain I mean consider this he's a young man the prophet's coming he's going to choose a king of his own choosing and David's a part of the family and his own father doesn't even say have you considered David he forgets about David David oh yeah I have a son named David the prophet I'm going to pick one of your well surely it's this one surely it's that one surely his own father natural father didn't even think we good enough to be anything probably just stay out there and take care of the sheep boy good for nothing right literally that's probably what happened like you don't get that mindset of a father unless there's something going on like he didn't even consider David yeah and then as you know the prophet anoints him to be king he says you're going to you're going to be the next king of Israel and anoints him and his father his brothers thought so much of him that they made fun of him after he was anointed by the prophet oh you silly boy get out of here you and so his own brother's rejecting time goes on you know he God delivers Goliath into his hands and he loves The King The King loves him and then after a while the king hates him like jealousy hates him and tries to kill him and David did nothing wrong what did David do nothing he was constantly just trying could be a blessing but he hated him then he went for he had to run for his life just to stay alive he's on the Run Saul trying to kill him the whole time even delivers him into his hand one time God does and his soldiers say hey God delivered him into your hands take his life he said no I ain't going to touch the Lord's anointing he could have stopped it right there he said nope no it wouldn't be right I'm going to keep going then he becomes king and his own wife makes fun of him man ge now my wife you embarrass me praising God my own wife just keeps on going then his own people reject him but he loves the people so much he doesn't want to have the people killed so he leaves right just flees the city yeah his own family reject him his own son Rises up against him yeah David knew what pain was all about David knew it intimately and experienced it his whole life you know what I love about David David had a heart like God Amen he was always considering the other person right he never once said I don't deserve this they shouldn't treat me this way don't they know yeah no he always preferred the other person's needs above his own he said in Psalm 73 he says nevertheless I am continually with thee thou H has Holden me up by by thy right hand David never was getting this arrogant feeling of saying look at me I'm doing a great job he says Lord if you don't hold me up I'm done Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to Glory Whom Shall I have in heaven but thee and there is none upon the Earth that I desire but thee My Flesh and my heart faileth but God is the strength of mine heart and my portion forever he says in Psalms 1392 23 says search me oh God know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked in me lead me in that way that way Everlasting Psalms 147 he Health the broken heart and he bindeth up their wounds Psalms 51:10 create in me Lord a new a clean heart oh God renew the right Spirit Within Me amen that's four there's about 25 more God David wanted to he wanted his actions and his reactions to be pleasing to God and often times I don't believe my reactions to actions were pleasing to God and I'm convinced more than ever that God allows sometimes wrong actions for a purpose to check my reactions to the situations and some sometimes he does the right thing but I react incorrectly I I I believe I'm sorry but when he said I'm going to send you Elijah the prophet and he's going to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers I think that was more than an outwardly appearance and a correct understanding of Doctrine I believe that he was going to create in me the very heart of Christ that what Christ is I will be and he just knows how to do it I don't know how to do it you know what I believe I believe he's custom made a course for each one of us to run and he just knows just the right trial just the right Joy just the right rejection just the right criticism just the right pain at the right time to make you what he desired you to be so can really the clay say to the Potter why why are you doing this you know I've seen it happen me over and over again it's like uhoh cool maybe we're about done no more pain coming together pretty good he says Nope not now wrong attitude wrong attitude yeah amen I think God's checking attitudes amen sir yeah you know you could do all the right things for all the wrong reasons all the wrong reasons I don't want to be that I really to me this is not a game this isn't convenient this isn't great do you think I enjoy this I don't I I I didn't I didn't come here to play Church didn't come here to just have friends oh I love you all and I have that I I really came in search for God and I've always from a kid I've told you that I'd go out there on the roof at night look at the stars I'm all alone something come over me I said Lord I'm I'm going find you someday I'm going to find you it wasn't me looking for him that was a father looking for a son and I'd get up there and I would cry I'm a 13-year-old boy you I mean some of you I mean come on you know what you were thinking as a 13-year-old boy full of hormones you wanting to fight something punch something do something like that I'd go up in that roof and cry it's weird i' I've just wanted to have fellowship with him I really did amen I I don't I don't care to be thought of as a minister I don't I don't care I've said that before it doesn't bother me to minister if I never get asked it's fine Brother Chad but I want to be a proud son I just want to hear well done I may not have 10,000 trophies to lay his feet but I want to be able to lay there I want to say there's one trophy I want to give you Lord It's Me couldn't do much else so I lay myself down I gotta find where I'm at first Samuel says but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance nor on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as men see for man looks on the outward appearance but the Lord looks on the heart I'm so thankful for that cuz he does know my heart he knows my heart why little Bethlehem David oh when he was anointed king that little boy he's just a ruddy little fella but he must have been there must have been something in him that looked real to God a little bitty probably the smallest in the family all the rest of the boys were great big fine looking men would be good to look upon with robes the crown would sit good on their head but God showed what he was looking for not the outward appearance but the inside of a man he looked at his heart he knew what was in David's heart no matter what a crown looked like on him he knowed he was finding him a man that was a man after his heart which David would be a man after his own heart that's why he poured the anointing oil upon David didn't matter how well the crown set didn't matter how good the robes looked on him that didn't matter at all to God God just had a man that would do his will would always be considering the people over himself that's why he was a Shepherd King he cared for the Sheep went out I don't think he went out after the bear and the lion to say hey I'm going to show that thing how good I am I'm going to show him how good I can throw this Stone I don't think he was trusting in human ability I think brother bam said that's the thing you got we all got to conquer is the thought of human ability I believe he just was simply humbly trusting God and I think the scripture says except you become like a child simple innocent unable and dependent we're not going to be able to please him right brother bam said this is the only trip everyone we're going on that we have to unpack for this is not a trip to see how much we can load up this is a Tri to see how much we can get rid of and the biggest thing I'm trying to get rid of is me that's the one he can't make that trip he's too heavy [Music] so brother bam said in the human heart there's so many doors brother Ben went into the door of pride of life you know there was a lust of the Flesh and lust of the eyes he said there's another little door it's called that door of Pride oh it's a hard one to get open human beings are just prone to think that maybe they're just a little bit better than the Joneses just a little bit better we are predisposed to think that way everyone your human nature is predisposed to gravitate to the thought that you're just a little bit better than somebody else it's human nature and it's hellish amen it's not of God that's not God Revelation humbles you down brother bam talks about the wheat in the field right he said those little I forget how he described he the happy little Wheats they think they're really something their head just flying woooo look at me look at me he said cuz there's nothing in there he said when that wheat gets full of the the grain like right the head starts to mature what's it do its head begins to bow down there's actually something there there's a substance there's a reality and it's bringing a humility and a dropping of one's head in the presence of God that's the reality of a Christian that's the reality of a mature son and daughter of God Revelations dropping us really low and we're not thinking we're better than anybody cuz we are not Fellowship 1960 something happened to me a few weeks ago and I am determined by God's help that I will never be negative on anything anymore to blast my heart out there and remind me that no matter what it will cost me I'm going to be sincere and see that's the truth men begin to educate themselves they educate themselves away from one another then they get complexes you don't get a complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you get love that's where you see you get love not complexes that little bit I'm a little bit bigger than somebody else I'm a little bit better than somebody else and know a little bit more than the other guy you just got your arms around everybody because see it's on the basis of love which is brought through the blood oh my you ever notic that when you first came to Christ you love everybody that's right it don't matter who they are what they think you're just so happy to be recipient of the grace of God in your life you're just like I love you anyhow you know I don't care I love you you know what is it if we ever get away from that we got away from something we shouldn't have got away from we better go back to that we don't think we're better than anybody else we think we're little than everybody else I remember saying that to brother Jeremy that first Bible study I said my goodness God revealed his truth to me and I'm the worst one I know I said surely God's going to reveal this to everybody else at my church cuz I promise you I'm the worst one that was the attitude oh I wish I would have stayed with that attitude I'd be we'd all be a little bit farther up the road if we would have stuck with that kind of an attitude right man I'm the worst one but God saw fit to save me God saw fit to redeem me amen let's go back to that he said in the super sense he says now you see you're all in love with one another how I see that you're standing here in the aisles this morning and just weep with all your hands up to God see the lovely Spirit moving all around you now don't you listen to one foul thing the devil's got to say see if the devil shows you shows you some or tells you something evil about one of the members of the body of Christ don't believe it for as soon as you believe it you will Mar your experience and if you see a member of the body of Christ doing something evil don't tell nobody but you go to that member with love and see if you can bring them back to Christ and if you can't do it then tell one person or let let them go with you you do it the way the scripture said if somebody said sister so and so or brother so and so don't you believe one word of it you just let it go because remember it's just the devil trying to tear you to pieces now you just look for him to come in cuz he's going to do it now you let that good man of the house Faith stand right there and don't you receive one thing these people that have been set there in Heavenly places with you fellowshipping together around the blessings of God taking communion at the table and the Holy Spirit as a witness that they are the children of God so let's just be real sweet kindhearted and forgiving loving and if other person talks evil against you you just talk real sweet to them praise God Amen watch how sweeter it comes to you then see that's the right you always return good for evil and love for hate amen wow see Christianity is a reality Christianity is rugged and it expresses itself in loving one another the scripture says if you say that you love God whom you've not seen and you love not the brother who you can see right well see This is Love Yes real love if you see me an all you see a fault with me you owe it to me told that to brother Jeremy at The First beginning said hey if I get off you get a hold of me you tell me cuz I get off I can get off am I would want some I don't I don't consider you to really love me unless you do that for me right right we do that for one another we love one another and we all make we all make mistakes we all get off the path at times and don't act like you don't you do you do but real spiritual maturity is when I see my brother he's he's off a little bit I'm concerned for him I go talk to him a little bit I mean just talk to that brother I'm I'm I'm concerned don't go tell everybody certainly don't go tell everybody Mar is testimony and hurt is influence just go talk to him sit down we're brothers let's talk and you say well he won't change that don't matter you got to do what God Said do doesn't matter what he does what if what if he doesn't listen to me doesn't matter it's off of you then you done what God told you to do and let God do the rest and I think there's something oh wait yeah when Divine love projects Sovereign Grace steps in finishes the work I think we're going to know how Divine love works by the time we're out of here and I think we're going to be living by it Bible says it'd be so deceptive in that last day you know I was considering Lucifer Lucifer was beautiful and the very first sermon that I ever preached was over in Philippines when brother Chad abandoned me at the airport the first inspiration that I ever ministered on I titled it deception by beauty that was the first sermon I ever preached deception by Beauty and uh we know Lucifer was beautiful he was amazing he was created co-equal with God I mean that's quite a being yeah right I mean God can't show his great strength unless he has a worthy opponent amen so this is a worthy opponent everyone and he was so stunningly beautiful so stunningly smart and Brilliant and that he got deceived by himself nobody deceived him he deceived himself he got to thinking I am pretty amazing in fact I'm greater than God I can build a greater Kingdom than Michael can build yeah I can do this better than they can do it let me make the decisions right I'll figure it out I can do it they can't yeah amen that's right that's right it's still the spirit of the devil it is what it is I've been guilty I've been guilty it's still the devil he is slick he hides he's Shifty he moves from one spot he never fully exposes himself he's shifty is all get out changes his mask here here here here here that's right he wasn't content in the place he was in he wanted to be a little bit more brother Bram said you know that same attitude I'm a little bit better I could do a little bit more that's right I think we need to have the attitude I'm just happy to be a Christian I'm just oh my goodness I don't deserve it never I have failed every day of my life I don't deserve to be here with you guys but I really am honored to be here I'm happy to be a part of it and you're you're all Ed but you're just see you're perfecting me I'm the one that needs perfected and see Iron sharpening iron Amen brother B said an influence he said when a man or a woman no matter if he's a bishop a cardinal or whatever he will be when you begin to feel a little self-reliant then you better watch you better take heed because God is not going to let you get away with that because he is not going to share his glory with anyone God will get the glory in him alone sometimes God can bless a man and give him a little ministry that's just a little bit better than his Brethren or not better but see it's just a little different than his Brethren and then the first thing you know that that that man gets a little exalted his chest sticks out and oh he would or he would just brush you off the street and that that's the time that I believe that the man is starting his way out the door God ain't going to let that happen God ain't going to let you get a puffed up chest and think you're something special cuz we're not it's not a great people it's a great God in a people just a great God living and dwelling and having expression in us but we no we're Badger skins right we're we're we're just the Veil Just a veil brother BR brother Gabe shared this with me and it's something I've I've chewed on here and brother brandham refers to popular sins in the last day and I like to read this because it Frameworks something he says and how can I overcome 1963 he said and he caught them who looked for that so will he come in each New Testament the Saints that's overcome every denominational critic who has ever overcome all of the popular sins of that day of that age that we live in now like he did in all the other Church ages those who overcome in that church age those who overcome what okay what are we going to overcome I am rich I have need of nothing oh I'm all this I'm all that I am the bride I have need of nothing yeah right amen yes he follows up by saying and you don't know you are naked and blind amen direct quote look it up then he says you see that deceiving age that I said it's not like them that they were going to have their heads cut off to get that white stone those that were under martym and they were burn at Stakes he says no but it's so it's such a deceiving age now that think that they are everything right see I am a good church member I am a good man I'm a good woman I am this and I am that there's your deception that's the deception that we have to watch for everyone that's it right if the devil can't pull you into something what's he going to do he's going to push you up just push you up amen still okay okay okay okay sorry I'm going to read a couple things this one's a little lengthy but listen here he said in time tested memorials some time ago there was the great Caesar Augustus after this great famous battle he had won a great Victory and he was going down to have a celebration in Rome and he said to them I want someone to ride by my side who's worthy to ride by my side I want some man to share all of these blessings with me and it went down through the camps and all the off officers they trimmed their plumes and they polished up their swords and they made their armors real bright and everything and they practiced standing just the right way so they could salute the king and so forth and each one walked up with their great big armors on before him and he sat there on the throne watching and there came up an officer with his big fine plume with his feather edged sword uh feather edged stood and made his salute uh Caesar shook his head and he just walked away another one come up made his salute Caesar shook his head and just walked away time after After Time After Time Soldier after Soldier finally way down along the line there was a little footman he didn't have a Polish he didn't have a shield to polish neither did he have a plume to trim but he walked up in front of Caesar he didn't even know how to salute him right but he just bowed his head and he walked away Caesar said wait a minute you come back here he walked up there he looked at him and there were scars all over over his face he had been cut up disfigured and crippled where'd you get those scars he said I was out on the battle fighting for my Lord he said you climb up here and sit down by my side you're the one that's been tested and proved brother it's plume trimming time it's not an educational time it's time testing time it's a time that God is going to test his church to find those Battle Scars of real hard trials fights and in battles that's the one who's going to ride by his side you know I began to realize those scars sometimes that we look back in our life we get really ashamed of those aren't scars of defeat I'm are Victory scars those are scars we overcame you know when Jesus was all scarred up beat up bruised up they stood there at the foot of the cross those that were walking from the road to emus their heads down low they felt like it had all been defeated it was all over these are fatal wounds and what what could come good out of this but then Jesus came and started showing off these nail scarred hands these weren't scars of defeat these are scars of Victory to showing that one had overcome all the pains all the rejections all the despisement the spitting the mockings the humiliations and he kept on with the purpose of God in his heart amen he just kept going yeah and I think that's what it's going to be like there's not a one of us that isn't going to Bear a scar we're all going to be cut up by the time we get out of here we're going to be bruised cut up worn out humiliated it's all going to happen to all of us give it enough time and you're going to see that it happens but we're doing it for a purpose amen it's not in vain it's none of it's in vain it's all making me what he wanted me to be it's all making you what he had determined to make you every failure every disappointment every trial it's all for a great purpose they're going to be signs of Victory they're going to be Battle Scars of Victory not defeat he says we pray tonight Lord that you'll sanctify this church by thy great Holy Blood clean out all the blows all those weak spots all those foul threads run through here with the machine and ret tape them up again make them a new material oh blessed father and while we have our heads bowed if there would be such a person here tonight that would feel that God is test it that God in his testing time has never found you to be faithful at your post of Duty when arguments would come up you would jump right in and partake of them when corals would come in then indifference and differences in the church you took your side you you jumped with a click or a cult and you did it do you listen to gosp gossip if you're guilty of all that you've been blowed through by the devil's blows let's go right back to the furnace tonight and be remelted over again and come out uh come out without them in us let God thread us down and get us ready for that great bridge of the Rapture if such a person is here would you like to be remembered I want to be remembered everyone I need remelted down I need mended up I need old scars ripped apart I need those things exposed in me I need to be refined over just to show you that I believe these scars they all serve a purpose sometimes you know we try to protect things in our life you know someone hurts you really bad really bad and you're like you ever heard of the Chinese torture drills yeah ever heard of it okay I think I think this is how it works they take a drop of water and they drop it on your forehead and they just do it for days and days and days until finally the person is going insane in pain can't handle it no more just this little bit of pain at just the right spot long enough cause a man to go crazy and it's amazing we all have wounds we have soft spots we have little spaces little Parts in our heart my goodness don't touch me there it hurt right and amen it's true it does hurt but God can heal the wound am if God can heal the leg heal anything in the physical cannot God heal the heart did not David say that yeah do not we believe that anything that has caused damage in our hearts over the Liv or over our years God can heal it and actually use it as a victory rather than a time where we constantly seem to fall we fall here we fall here we fall here you have weak spots brother bam said you got them and you better get ready to get punched in them yeah but you got to have God covering that spot for you you can't cover it no more it's just that time he's ripping these things apart and he said you ain't covering this anymore I am going to be your covering and if I can't be your covering right you're done amen that's just a reality sorry I'm using such plain terms I hope it you makes sense to what I'm saying amen amen so brother brandham tells this story he said not long ago there was a young lady that came from college her mother uh had washed over a board to send her to college and when she drove down to the station she had uh she had brought a young girl with her and she had gotten away from God and she had gotten away from church and that young girl was with her and the young girl sitting there and the train was looking out in there stood her mother on the outside you see she was all scarred up and the young girl was looking at her from the train and finally said would you look at that old haggy looking woman that was the girl's mother said isn't she horrible my wouldn't you hate to have to sit across the table from her that was her girlfriend now instead of the girl speaking up she turned her head and when she got off the train this old wrinkled up woman run up to her and she threw her arms around her and kissed her and the girl was repulsed she'd gotten away from her got away from church she got away from God she was so cold she turned her back to the lady and she said my darling my darling what has happened and she was so embarrassed see because of her girlfriend just then one of the conductors who knowed the story walked up and grabbed that young girl by the shoulders and said you lookie here what do you mean said Are you ashamed of your mother since you've been away to college said remember let me remind you of the story one day the house was burning your mother was a beautiful woman far more beautiful than you will ever be and said you were the tiny little baby when she when she was hanging her clothes out on the backyard and all at once the house caught fire and here comes the fire anes to put it out and the the house was full of flames you were screaming from the upstairs no one would go in and Pierce those Flames but a little mother your little mother wrapped herself up and in there she ran through those flames and she grabbed you she took off she took the clothes from off of her face and wrapped you all up in it and put you in her arms and and and placed her face to the flames and Through the flames she came to rescue you that's why you're pretty today and that's why she so scarred you are ashamed of those scars that's the way Jesus has done for us when we were Sinners ugly before God cast down and turn away he came and that the lovely Son of God from his Ivory Place palaces he came down to earth and he took upon the shame and the humiliation upon himself and the sin upon himself and he died there on calary crying out should I be ashamed of a gospel Christians on the street are ashamed to to stand for the gospel but he was marred and he was made ugly so that I could be made free and so in considering that uh you know I'm so glad those those scars were a testament of a mother's love for a baby she was willing to endure the scars for somebody else's sake and when we consider Jesus Christ he was willing to endure the rejections rure the pain in endure the embarrassment the humiliation for somebody else's sake now I think the question is coming to all of us what are we willing to endure are you willing to endure the rejection you willing to endure the criticism are you willing to endure all of these pains that you're going to have to handle for somebody else's sake if we're living our life for ourselves we haven't arrived if we're living our life for somebody else we're looking Heaven heavenward we're pointed the the right direction and that's the reality of it in Hebrews 12 it says um looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross there's a time where you just have to endure the pain you just have to go through it it's painful when they ripped open that scar tissue it's painful but it had to be ripped open to set me right so I could walk right act right scripturally or spiritually speaking there's wounds in me had to be ripped apart I had to have some spots that I've been covering over ripped to shreds so that I could start walking right talking right acting right treating people right it's not fun it's painful amen maturing is painful he says uh father while we're here in this battle of life let us be strong and courageous knowing that just beyond the water out yonder is an eternity help us to come in that day as great warriors with Battle Scars all over us showing the results of the battle must I be carried home on flowery bed of ease While others have fought to win the prize and they sailed through bloody Seas said the poet let us come all that way we're not coming on a flowery bed of Beast I this ain't going to get easier I I don't believe it's getting easier I believe it's going to get much more difficult and uh I think we're going to have a lot of scars by the time we're out of here but I think he's going to see those scars I think he's going to say ah my son come stand with me I want you to sit on my throne with me I know why you bore those scars you did it for somebody else amen you did it for somebody else and it's all going to be worth it one of these days it says in John where I read it if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me brother Ben I appreciated the sermon last Wednesday and there's not a one person in here that didn't and it encouraged me to take this step it's hard it's not easy to be humiliated it's not easy to show your wounds it's not easy to have them exposed to show your failings your faults your mistakes that we all got them everyone does and so I think by the grace of God um if there's a cross for brother Ben and there's a cross for me there's probably a cross for you somewhere maybe it's sitting behind the door tried to cover it up with a sheet tried to hide it so you don't have to look at it humans avoid pain we do everything we can to to to resist it but Christ doesn't Christ doesn't he Embraces the cross he goes right for it right for it and you consider that always Moses brother B said stumbled me how could Moses say Lord block my name out but don't forsake your people right and he said Till I struck me it was Christ in Moses Christ in Moses was saying let me suffer but don't let your people suffer David said the same thing he said Lord stop it don't hurt your sheep bring it bring it to me David said the same thing those Christlike characters and if Christ is going to be in us we're going to say beat me bruise me wound me it's okay I know it's serving a purpose I'm going to have to be exposed I'm going to have to put myself in a position where I could be hurt right brother Ben but I think Christ will be lifted up and if Christ is lifted up then I know the people will be helped and that's the purpose of ministry Ministry is there to help and minister to you and ministers are sometimes the first partakers of these things and um Zechariah says oh that which the um the one shall say unto him what are these wounds in your hands and he shall say and answer those of which I I was wounded were in the house of my friends and so don't feel so bad and know we got some wounds that we have to just endure amen ah and they're going to come from the ones we love the most and it's all part of the plan amen you know um we're not getting out of here without coming into His Image and uh it's painful everyone it's just painful I don't know how El to say it I wish there was more words I could say to make it more palatable first John says if we love him because we love him because he first loved us if a man say that I love God and he hates his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen and this commandment we have from him that he who loveth God is love loveth God love his brother also I think the scripture says greater love hath no man than this he lays down his life for friends you know and so I think that's what's happening I think uh all of our lives are being exposed by the grace of God and um and we're not playing Church no more God musicians will you come um will you stand um I'm kind of like the bucket I carry it all out here and I dump it all at one time I don't know how to trickle it out I'm working on it brother Chad I'm sorry I I I I will you forgive me love you all times I'm ashamed of myself just ashamed but I'm still honored to go through the shame I'm honored to be to go through whatever humiliation he needs to bring me to so I can just have fellowship with him that's the desire I just want to have fellowship and uh I know that um I I don't know I I I'm just amazed at times how God works things out you know the timing of things is so unique it's he's making everything perfect in his time everything's being made beautiful yeah right on his time amen never on mine I would bypass some things along the way I would try to avoid some disfigurements and some bruises and some pains along the way but it's a time to Rend there's a Time time to sew back up and by the grace of God I think he's rented and now he's sewing back up am and for each of us that may be a different thing maybe something you got to go make right maybe a conversation you need to correct maybe uh humbling of oneself you're not as good as you think um but ultimately I think you'll be glorifying God I think you'll be lifting him up and I think honestly you'll have respect not only amongst God you'll have respect amongst men brother Ben I sent him a text I said brother Ben 10 foot taller than my eyes now and then he had to say uhoh now I got another trial you I oh boy oh boy here it going to get bad we're just brothers we're just learning together we're family and I'm glad to be a part of the family of God and I'm glad to be perfecting in your midst I still wouldn't trade it for the world I still wouldn't trade it for the world Isaiah says 53 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed everything Body Mind heart everything he paid the price to heal it all that's right amen but it takes the word sometimes to rip something apart so he can pour in that ointment that healing ointments got to go right to the right spot and so sometimes you just got to rip it apart would you bow your heads gracious heavenly father thank you Lord for your grace to each and every one of us thank you for your word thank you Lord you promised I'll never leave you never forsake you Lord we all stray we all like sheep have gone astray at times and Lord You're the great Shepherd that comes after each and every one of us Lord I'm just so thankful for that I think we as a people would all bow our heads in humility when we recognize just how great you are Lord you you inspire all of us to want to be like you Lord seeing the great price you paid and the life that you lived and how you end endured such such difficult things and Lord you did it all for me and Lord It's my great honor and my privilege if you could just keep your hand of Grace upon me to help me to come into that image someday may you help us all to come into that image that's our desire Lord I don't want to just be saved I want to be able to have fellowship with you and you're so great how would I know how to have fellowship with you but Lord you humbled yourself you became obedient unto death even death of the Cross and so Lord God I just pray that you'd help each and every one of us to follow in those same footsteps they're big footsteps Lord but I just pray that your anointing would be upon us to walk in them and I believe that it is I don't believe these things are for no reason I don't believe this is all a fable I don't believe this is all just something we've made made up no I believe this is God and man coming together again and so Lord search our hearts you've been searching mine and keep searching it over and over and over search each of us father both young and old Lord if there be anything Wicked in US father show it to us so we can make it right help us father we need help like your Prophet crying out 1962 God help me I need help he was being honest If we're honest we know we need help we can't do this without you we never could we never will we need your help we need your grace every day and I I I I believe we've received it and we'll continue to receive it Lord I sure love you I love these people I know I do and I just pray that you'd bless each and every one both young and old take the Bro broken up thoughts I'm sorry sorry Lord I know it wasn't put together right but Lord you know my heart and that was my desire and I just pray you use it to bring you glory and just I pray your sheep are fed in some way and Lord may you just help them all to Come a Little Closer to You Lord we love you so thankful for what you have done what you are doing and what you will do in each and of Our Lives we love you we commit ourselves to you in Jesus name amen brother Chad will you come so happy for the baptism man I heard about it I was so excited God bless you both I just got a chance to shake your hand and uh and it was about uh 15 years ago this August I was able to get baptized right here and and uh it was just the grace of God Shine the Light down my path and I hadn't seen it I had been baptized multiple times before but when you see the truth you just want to walk in it and that's just the desire of our hearts as whatever he shows us to do we just want to be faithful to do it and uh I'm sure today he shows us something and tomorrow sister Joyce is's going to show us something else ain't he and I think that was all because God is restoring Fellowship he wants to walk with you that was his promise and I believe we're going to be walking with him we're going to learn to walk at the pace that he walks we're going to learn to walk where he goes we'll follow we're not going to Veer off and go our own way by the time we're all said and done we're not going to take our eyes off of him we're going to hold on to him and say Lord I'm not letting you get one step ahead of me or one step far from me I want to walk with you Lord and so by his grace he's doing it I believe he's restoring the fellowship that I've longed for right brother Roger in your heart something crying out can't explain it don't know what happened we wander away we go our own way at times he lets us learn some hard lessons it lets us get all battled up and scarred up but it all served a purpose and one day there'll be Battle Scars of Victory brother Roger said you know what it didn't stop me I got right back up and I kept going amen we're going to get knocked down we're going to get punched really hard but it's not going to stop us cuz greater is he that's in me than he that was in this world and by his grace he's drawing us day by [Music] day got a song brother John will you got greater than all my sin amen greater than all the sins brother Chad I greater than all my sin is the blood that still cleanses me it's the grace that still sets me free to praise him I know that the blood of walking in newness of I cannot fall for he's greater than all blood of [Music] l oh it's greater than all my sin is the blood that still cleanses me it's the grace that still sets me free to praise him I know that the blood up walking in new of light I cannot fall for it's greater than all blood of the Lamb amen God bless you all brother Denny and sister Carrie if you'd like to make your way around back and there'll be a one of the brothers there to help you amen I'm so blessed by the word today amen amen not just blessed because I was told you're great you're wonderful I was blessed because God's trying to fix this vessel so that he can use it and I'm thankful he's still working on this vessel thought it was so interesting when Brother Kyle talked about the scar that he had and how had to be ripped back apart and so many things are causing us to walk in a deformed way amen it's causing us problems in our SP spiritual life and in our natural life and we don't even know what it was amen but the grace of God will come along and he'll find that spot and he'll tear it apart I thank God for that because he knows what we have need of sometimes we don't even really know what our problem is but God will come by by the word and he'll identify our problem and then he'll tear that apart and then it'll heal and there may always be a scar there but it won't be a scar it won't be from a wound that healed the wrong way but it'll be from a wound that was healed the right way amen I say God heal me the right way remember the scripture that says amen make straight paths for your feet lest the lame be turned out of the way but rather let it be healed amen and I say God whatever's got me walking crooked would you come and heal it Lord come and heal it thank God for that amen I was thinking of something brother bandom said when it comes to humility there was something that Brother Kyle was talking about about where when we get feeling lifted up and we feel like maybe we've got something and we've got it accomplished that's the moment we're ready for a really hard fall it's happened to me so many times and I don't want to go through it again but brother Brandon remember the time he was laying there and say well Bill brandom you're nearly 50 years old if you're ever going to do anything for the Lord you better get started now by the time he was 50 look at what he had done for the Lord if that was his attitude what should our attitude be I want to have I said God help me to have the same attitude not to pretend but in reality help me to realize I have not done anything but I want to do something I want to yield I want to surrender and may God keep us in the right attitude amen God's doing something for us friends he's doing something in us and maybe that's the most necess Neary work of all maybe that's where the real Miracles are taking place right now is what God's doing inside of us to break those broken places maybe something was broken inside of us and it healed but it didn't heal necessarily right and it's still causing us problems but the great Physician's here he may have to rebre it but he knows how to set it right so that we can serve his purpose on this Earth how many of you want to be set right how many feel like God is setting you right through the services through the word this message has come to make a bride in His image and I believe the word's doing it let's just bow our heads together and pray dear heavenly father I'm so thankful Lord that you're so mindful of our needs that you come along Lord and you begin to expose areas that we need you more God we may have been blind to it we may have known there's a problem there somewhere but what the problem is we don't necessarily know but but God you keep coming down and you keep exploring and probing and opening all the doors Lord to our heart and God help us not to resist it but help us to yield and let you open any door you want to explore all of our life Lord and all of the innermost parts of our being and God when you find something there that's unpleasant we don't like and we don't want expose would you help us Lord would you come and fix that place inside of us and make us whole so that we can serve you with our whole Hearts God we want to serve you we want to please you we want to serve your purpose in this life we want to be a vessel that you can use and that you can finish the work you left for this hour but God we're going to need your help every step of the way and God I believe you're speaking to us through the ministry Lord and you're showing through the brothers that you're here to help that it's the season it's the time that you're going to do a mighty work in our lives and Lord we just want to lay on your operating table not cover up and not hide but just stay exposed and let you come and do the work that only you can do Lord forgive us forgive us for hiding forgive us for Pride oh forgive us for all of those things Lord Purge that out of our lives and may we get to the point where we fulfill what your Prophet has said that she will stand than the Splendor of him your life flowing out through Tabernacles of clay your power on manifestation the power to change a life power to heal God we're asking for it do a work in US Lord change our hearts change our lives change everything about us and bring us into that image you had of us from before the foundation of the world God you're doing a work and we want to be yielded to it pray that you bless our brother Kyle Lord that you restore to him all that he poured out and pour your balm in his heart Lord after this message as he poured out his life and poured out his heart I pray that you would bless him for it and may the word that was preached Lord take effect in our lives we believe it we believe that's the purpose of it and I believe it's going to do the work we thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name amen for Theon concluded all his Vanity now my heart believes that it is true oh it took me all this time to find reality all I ever really want is you you all that really counts all that's really true all I never read Lord is you everything to gain nothing now to lose all I ever r wanted you so take the grandest thing you know that life can give and wait it with etern bright side one thing I

children to himself one thing we've learned in what we've seen God do in all of our Lives is he knows where to find his sheep he knows how to draw his sheep and he uses his word to do it every time so I'm thankful for brother Denny he'll be baptized first and then sister Carrie and I thank God that that he knew where they were and they could bring them and at this stage in life when they've served God and they've loved God and they've loved his word for so many years amen God saw that and he honored that and he said they love me but there's another step that they can take and when the season was right God came to them and brought them to the another level of his word and they had something in them to respond to the word of God when they saw it I say praise be to God I thank God for his work brother Denny because you love the Lord Jesus Christ and you want to be identified with him in death burial and resurrection and you want to take his name and baptism it's a great pleasure for me
