a deacon or a trustee you're an adult you know god can still have the permanence in your life that's why we sing work with our hands and our lips and our feet because how else is god going to work

you i've been looking forward to it as you can see it's a little different than usual so today we're going to stretch church order just a little bit there's no deacons in here are there you have to forgive me if we're going to stretch church order just a little bit because we're going to have a good time together how many wants to learn something about god and about his word today amen that's what i want to do to you amen let's uh i'm going to read a scripture and then we'll pray and then you can be seated but i'm going to read out of mark chapter 10 verse 13 to 16 it says and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for if such is the kingdom of god verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms and put his hands upon them and blessed them let's bow our heads and pray together lord jesus we thank you for the privilege of being together for this kid's service and lord we ask all that you would take the central place among us may i always say and do lord glorify your name and bring all your truths in a reality form to these kids may they be able to see you and know you better at the end of this service lord i pray that you would work in their hearts and in their lives from the time they're young so that they would always love you and always serve you and always know you and lord we just pray that you would take the preeminence among us in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated if brother franco if you can pull up the powerpoint for me amen we haven't had a kid service for a couple of years how many of you that are sitting in the front two rows remember the last kid service remember being here in the kids series before remember wonderful and a lot of them got old and got shoved to the back so i see a lot of them back there that used to be sitting down here and now they're part of the youth group how many how many of you are 12 that are sitting up front i mean you guys are 12 1 2 3. wow so we're gonna lose you next year well praise the lord we're glad you're here this time you'll get too old and you'll get shoved to the back again so there's some benefits in coming to the kids service and being 12 or under as you get the good seats and when it comes to snack time you get to go first you're first in line for ice cream so don't be too too big of a hurry to get older okay because you lose some of those privileges so it's good all right we're going to do things a little bit different this is not the traditional kind of service this is a kids service so we actually have fun because kids know how to fun adults they forgot how how many are sure your parents forgot how to have fun exactly but not me i remember so we're gonna we're gonna talk about a subject of who is your guide who is your leader in life who is your leader and for that i'm going to start off with an object lesson now if you see did you guys see all this tape on the floor somebody has messed up our church somebody's guilty and i'm not telling you who it was but if you see little lines painted on the floor and directional arrows you can get the idea there's a little obstacle course set up up here and in this obstacle course you begin here you have to travel this direction it's really complicated so pay close attention really really hard you have to walk all the way over here when you get over here you got to go back to the back side of this and we have two different color cups we have two green and two silver you have to stack the two green ones together and stack the two silver ones together and put them back on the table then you have to walk this way you can't cross that line you can't go out of the boundaries you can't hit the chairs you can't hit this you've got to walk right down the middle of this when you get here you've got to follow the arrows get up on this this is the most dangerous part of the whole thing are you paying close attention you got to walk across here when you get here you come off follow the arrows go back here then we have three cups here two red cups and a gold cub you gotta stack the red cups together take the gold cup bring it over here and you've got to set this gold cup right on the square right there and you can't take all day to do it like we've got to get this done we're going to see who can do it quickly so is there anybody thinks that they can manage my obstacle course who thinks they can do it raise your hand put it way up don't be shy do you think you can you think you can run my obstacle course okay raise your hand who wants to run the obstacle course all right we'll let the girls go first which one of you girls really really really really want to do oh okay natalie come on you can do it first all right stand right here all right so you know what to do it was pretty complicated but you think you got it right okay but there's one caveat you have to do it blindfolded so if you put on my blindfold okay can you see anything you can't see anything are you sure are you blind you can see can you see this okay all right i'm going to get you in position okay i want to get you all lined up to make sure that you're going the right direction because we don't want you to go the wrong way okay now i want you to see how quickly you can do the obstacle course okay yeah you're doing good wonderful yeah excellent beautiful we don't have all day the ice cream is going to melt good job all right excellent okay see if we can keep going oh oh oh careful that's out of bounds we'll let you keep going oh careful well yep we keep going out of bounds okay okay okay okay this isn't working all right take the blindfold off see where you're at you were doing good you did excellent let me have this go ahead and sit down now she did pretty good i mean for being blind she did very very well she got all the way over here without going out of bounds i was very impressed who was impressed i was very impressed but we got the cups stacked wrong so you did excellent but we're gonna have to try this again now we're gonna let several different people have a try all right we never made it over here but there's some things i want to talk about because there's a lesson in all this it's not just getting blindfolded and walking around the sanctuary but we know that that when it comes to our life and what god has for us the future and what we're supposed to be doing with our lives as you grow up you guys don't know none of you know yet what you're going to be when you get older nobody knows what job you're going to do you don't know if you'll get married or not married if you have a family or not where you'll live whether you be in a house or an apartment what kind of car you'll drive what kind of job you have how much school you'll do there's a lot of things we don't know in life so when it comes to the future we're blind does anybody have the future figured out already nope i don't either i have no idea when it comes to what is going to happen tomorrow i'm just as blind as you are none of us know but is there anybody that knows tomorrow does anybody know that somebody who knows everything that will happen tomorrow yes tell us god he knows everything can god see unto tomorrow absolutely he can see him to tomorrow and so because he can see unto tomorrow we can trust him to lead us the right way now god is good to us in that he gives us leaders in our life is the power point up yes he gives us leaders in our life and brother branham made this statement he said in the message leadership he said now the first step you probably ever take in your life speaking of leadership is probably the hands of some kind old mother but that was the hand that held you to make your first step so when you were all little bitty babies and you may not even remember when you were a little bitty baby but you might had a brother or sister or somebody when you went to take your first step somebody was there to help you because you weren't born knowing how to walk is anybody born knowing how to walk no i don't think so you had to learn how to walk and somebody would help you walk and help you and that was usually mother brother branham said usually it's mom because dad's usually at work when it happens and comes home and mom begins to tell him all the exciting news of the day that baby took their first step by themselves so his mom and god gives us a mom to help us and then we have a dad who begins to teach us things amen how many i'm not going to talk to you girls but how many of you guys had a dad who taught you how to tie a tie all right and teaches you how to do yard work and teaches you things we've got leaders in our life we have a mom and we have a dad and god has given them to us to lead us and god our brother made this statement he says we have to be led he said you know god likened us to sheep that means god called us in the bible he calls us his sheep and did you know a sheep can't lead itself he'll wander away and stray away and he just can't lead himself and he has to have somebody to lead him and sometimes the shepherd is is supposed to lead the sheep now that was back in the days of the lord jesus he was the good shepherd that led the sheep so the bible describes us as sheep and little sheep have a tendency to get lost and lose their way they need a shepherd because they can't find their own way they don't know how to get back to where they came from they don't know how to get to the good pasture they don't know how to get back to the barn they get lost so god provided them a shepherd somebody to lead them so i'm going to try this again we're going to look for a volunteer from the boys who thinks that they can do so carter you think you can do this all right come on up we may have to tighten this a bit i don't want any peaking all right now pop that on there good job you're like a champ can you see anything nothing all right you stand right here cause i don't want you to get lost you're like a little sheep that can't find its way stand right there no moving you're gonna get lost no don't move all right we saw natalie she tried she did a good job but she just couldn't see so it would have been helpful if somebody would have guided you wouldn't then so which one of you guys wants to be a guide you want to be a guy all right come on up you can be a guide now do you know the course you know which direction to go and you know what's supposed to do go over there and stack the cups come over here go up the step go around stack the red cups together and bring the gold cup put up here you know that you can do that so you can guide him all right now turn around and you go in front carl you put your hand on his shoulder and he's going to be your guide all right you can do this okay are you sure all right wait a second we're not done you have to be blindfolded too all right you go ahead and put your oh let's tighten this up let's put your blindfold on there you go all right carter i'm going to have you stand over here just just just a step over here we're just going to go not to confuse you or anything i'm just going to get you in a different spot okay i think that's about right all right hold still right there are you ready to be his guide can you do it all right you can do it don't worry you'll be fine oh i'm sorry he's not there he's over here he's back this way somewhere i think over here wait you're behind him wait a second you gotta get in front no just turn around all right you turn around okay you got it mapped out all right guide our little lamb to safety all right go ahead there you go good job we're never going to get to the ice cream it's going to take a while there you go all right good you got her lined out you're going the right way all right praise the lord good job okay excellent all right perfect yeah you can stick your hand out it's okay you make sure you don't run into anything there you go all right keep going keep going excellent beautiful now pretty soon you'll hit those cups and you know stack those here in just a second there you go oh good job oh wait a second yeah there you go okay much better carter what's happened to your guide do you feel like you're going the right way no all right okay all right you got it for sure this time excellent it's like perfect oh oh oh oh all right let's take our blindfolds off wow what happened to your guide i don't know all right you can go sit down there's a scripture that describes this jesus said can the blind lead the blind shall they not both fall into a ditch this isn't exactly a ditch but we almost had both of them in the ditch so carter was our little lost lamb and he needed a shepherd but you need a shepherd who can see don't you right and you can't be a shepherd if you can't see right it's impossible you don't know where to go the blind can't lead the blind in order to be led you need somebody who can see somebody who can see where they're going knows where they're supposed to be go going knows what's going to happen so we found out that we can't make it on our own because we're blind all of us are blind in some ways we don't know what we're supposed to do next we don't know what tomorrow will hold we don't know what the future in our life holds only god knows so when it comes to those things we need somebody to lead us we're like a little lamb we're like this little lamb stuck in the weeds and don't know which way to turn don't know how to find our way back home but god is here to lead us back home and so we found out that we can't make it on our own we need a guide but a guide who's in the same condition we're in is not going to help us a blind a a guide who is just as blind as we are just as confused as we are and just as lost as we are is not going to help us another little lost lamb is not going to lead a little lost lamb to safety so i need another volunteer from the girls side this time oh you're pointing at each other now now nobody's raising their hand they're volunteering one another does any girls over here want to volunteer is anybody brave you're all brave you just don't want to raise your hand because you're scared but you're all really brave no girls all right is any boys huh now the boys are brave they're all brave all right all right dawson come on all right we're gonna do something different we are not gonna give you a blind guide i promise okay it won't work can you put these on for me okay all right you know what to do right you know what needs to be done you know how to do it all right let's get you in a good position this isn't a good position but there'll be a better one over here oh no this no you're no you're right no no i didn't want to go that way i made up my mind to go this way and then we're going to do something different we don't want you to have a blind guide a bad guide we want to give you a good guide so what we'll do is we'll come up with a guide that knows what they're doing they can see they can see the whole course and they know exactly which way to take you and which way to go all right so let me get you back in position not this way there okay stay right there all right now here's what we're going to do everybody that's 12 and under raise your hand raise your hand big and high it's not scary this is are you 12 and under 12 are you under 12 younger than 12. raise your hand all right can you guys see the obstacle course all right you can see the obstacle course you know the direction all right how many of you know the direction that he's supposed to go in and you know what he's supposed to do all right then i want all of you to be his guide everybody just shout it out give him distractions all of you at the same time tell him which way to go parents can help everybody can help let's help dawson go all right dawson okay go go straight ahead help him guys help him help him come on tell him help him out he needs help he needs lots of help somebody else help him these are bad helpers [Applause] yeah yeah that's good [Music] [Applause] keep going [Music] turn to the [Music] you can't have donovan doing all the work good job [Applause] there you go all right excellent all right keep going beautiful all right [Applause] turn around who said turn around all right all right time out time out dawson take those poured glasses off were you confused was any of their instructions confusing yes exactly you can go back to your seat now you guys are miserable helpers except for donovan if i ever get blindfolded i'm going to ask him to lead me and guide me the next lesson we learn is if you're going to have somebody guide you you need somebody who can see but you can't have everybody guide you there's too many voices and too many voices dawson was too many voices confusing yeah some said left some said turn around sends them go ahead sends i'm back to the left like it was too much wasn't it everybody had an idea everybody could see could you all see yeah you can all see you all knew what he was supposed to do but there was too many voices and sometimes when we as sheep we need to be led now we found out when we're blind you can't do it by yourself how many agree you can't do it by yourself when you can't see you need a guide but then we learned that your guide can't be as blind as you are you need a guide who can see is that true all right you need a guide who can see but everybody thinks they can see and they think they know what you should be doing and there's too many voices in too many voices end up confusing and you go the wrong way dawson went the wrong way and then he went somewhere the right way then he went somewhere the wrong way and listening to too many voices he got some of it right and some of it wrong is that right he got the cup separated but he got him stacked wrong he got the silver and the green mixed up and so i'm sure after a lot of pain and suffering and lots of trials and redos and dues against and all those other things he might eventually got this course done but it would have been confusion it'd have been difficult and the poor guy would have been stressed out he wouldn't even be able to eat his ice cream so we need a guide we must have a guide but we need a guide who can see and we don't need to listen to every voice that's talking to us we need one voice jesus said in john 10 27 he says my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and the psalms 23rd in psalms 23 says the lord is my shepherd so who's your shepherd who's your leader it's the lord jesus christ he's your leader the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me amen so though the shepherd would lead to the valley of the shadow of death that's a tricky place going down into the valley with the shadow of death amen it says the sheep won't be afraid because they know that the shepherd's with them and wherever that shepherd would lead them they wouldn't be afraid they wouldn't be scared they would know they were safe because the shepherd would never lead him somewhere that was that was dangerous that they wouldn't get hurt he was trying to take them to a better pasture to some place better to eat some place that was more safe and and they could grow better in another pasture and so we need a shepherd we must have a shepherd we must be led we must be led by the lord john 16 which i think it's interesting that uh brother ben read this scripture or something very similar to it this morning said in john chapter 16 i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for you shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so who did jesus say would be our guide yes the lord and he's coming in the form of his holy spirit and the holy spirit is to be our guide and the holy spirit is the spirit of jesus christ it's jesus christ but not jesus christ standing here amen as the man who was nailed to the cross but jesus christ the spirit of god he comes and we hear him does anybody know how we hear jesus our guide yes doth through your heart that's a perfect answer we don't necessarily him with our ears although the the word of god comes to our ears but we hear this guide through our heart amen there's an internal voice where god leads us and he directs us amen what are some other ways we hear the voice of god how does it get to our heart does anybody have any idea of any other way we can hear the voice of god yes derek through prayer that's a good one anybody have any other ideas is there anything you can read that'll help you hear the voice of god yes your bible when you read your bible you can hear the voice of god is there anything you can listen to where you can hear the voice of god yes boaz the message you can listen to the message and you can hear the voice of god is there anything else you can listen to yep you can listen to audio bible yes yes see i love that that's what i was waiting for listen to the preacher good job boys but all of these are ways in which we can hear the voice of god because god he used the prophet to speak to us in the age he allowed men to write the word which is the word of god and god can speak to us through his word he can speak to us amen through the preaching through the ministry through the message when we read the message books and listen to the message he can speak to you through your parents as they do devotions and and they do bible lessons with you and read your bible stories through your sunday school teachers as they share with you the word of god anybody that's giving you the word of god is sharing with you the voice of god if it's the true word of god in any way that the true word of god comes it's one of the ways that god can speak to you and it's not just your ears your ears catch the words but it does something in the heart and then the lord begins to lead us and guide us by the heart something in the heart has to know what you heard is true something in your heart has to know that what that brother or sister just said to me is the truth what that minister just said is true what i heard on that tape is true and it's for me and that's how the lord begins to lead us that's how the lord begins to guide us amen like for instance has anybody heard the bible verse that says thou shalt not steal all right is that the word of god so that's the voice of the lord and how do we hear that voice of the lord i mean none of you guys have probably ever been tempted to take something that you shouldn't take but when i was little i was tempted to take something that i shouldn't take and there was i'm shameful to say it was more than one time and when i would reach out to take that thing and i knew it wasn't belonged to me it might have been something that was my brother's it might have been a toy he was playing with and i knew he wasn't done and i was going to take it and use it or it might have been a piece of candy that he had and i may have ate mine and i wanted his but if i would reach out to take that and something inside would remember thou shall not steal what was that that was speaking to me yes tell us it was the bible which is the voice of god which is the spirit of god speaking in your heart saying don't take it don't do wrong don't disobey the word and so it doesn't matter whether you're young or old you can have ears in your heart to hear what the lord is saying and what the lord is leading he's to be our guide okay i need one more volunteer all right boys you can come on up we're going to try this one more time and i hope that this time we finally get it right all right put them on this way there you go okay can you see you sure wonderful i believe you because you said you listen to preachers okay okay all right let's take you over here and let's go over here and i think you're just about right no no let's go like over here you're getting close you're just about right yeah you're close yeah we're almost there we're almost to the right spot okay yeah we're just about there yeah okay that's about it right okay now in order for us to do this right you and i have to work as a team okay i'm gonna be your guide and nobody else is allowed to talk all right i'm gonna be your guide and i'm gonna guide you two ways i'm gonna guide you with my voice and i'm also allowed to guide you with my hand i can stop you if i want to stop you and turn you if i want to turn you i'm going to be your guide okay all right so i want you to turn just a little bit to the left not very much yeah perfect now just a touch to the right okay i want you to follow my voice and walk towards me and keep walking and i'll tell you if you need to go right or left but just keep walking a little to the right there you go keep walking just a little bit to the right a little to the right okay keep following me now just a little bit to the left more to the left more to the left all right more to the left now go straight forward now you're coming right for the table you're almost there put your there you go now reach towards the middle of the table get the cups don't knock them off step up so you can feel the table with your legs it'll be a lot easier step closer no just step close there you go now take the top one off and put it on the in the underneath the bottom so lift the whole stack and put it on top now lift the top two off yep and set them to the right there you go there you're good okay now turn to your right all right now follow my voice a few steps turn to the left all right a little more to the left i don't want you to hit the post there you go keep going straight a little bit more to the left yeah you're not in danger of hitting anything you're fine you're safe all right keep coming towards me keep coming to me okay now stop now if you slide your foot to the right you'll feel the step see that now i want you to step up on that step but you can hold my hand for this part all right because this is a risky part so i'll help you in this part go all the way across it can get precarious all right now step down to your left there you go all right now come towards me all right keep coming all right turn to your left and turn to your left again you'll be facing the table now walk towards the table it's right in front of you there you go grab the cups now take the top oh you're almost there oh you almost knocked it off all right lift it up okay put that cup underneath that stack there you go now take the top cup now when you take the top one off you'll be holding the treasured golden cup nobody has got this far all right turn to your right take a few steps towards me and turn to the left all right keep coming keep keep walking a little bit to the left slow down a little bit we don't want to wreck the whole thing at the end keep walking keep walking keep walking all right stop turn to your left all right now take a just one step forward turn to your right a little bit and take another step forward now if you reach out you'll feel the podium and you feel the tape yeah right there that's where you want to set the cup set the cup right there all right now turn around face the crowd and take your goggles off you made it you want to give a round of applause for your hand all right i'll take the dog that was a that was a perfect run perfect 10 and i'm glad it worked but you see it's so much easier when you have one voice when you have the right voice somebody who knows what's supposed to happen knows the way and somebody who will go before you and lead you not drive you and tell you you go over there and you go over there you've got god give you parents and parents will go before you and lead you the right kind of ministry the right kind of pastor and ministers and sunday school teachers they'll go before you and lead you but you've got to be sure that the voice that they're giving you is the word of god is the right voice and you got to know which voice to listen to while you're young you listen to mom and dad mom and dad will lead you in the ways that are right as you get older you can you start to listen to the message you start to hear the prophet read the bible listen to the ministry and god begins to give you that personal leadership through these voices you can't lead yourself you don't know which way to go how many of you know exactly what you're going to be doing a year from now you know exactly where you live exactly nobody knows exactly what's going to happen you might move to a different house you might move into a different neighborhood you might be doing a different subject in school or going to a different school you don't know what you'll be doing and then 10 years from now you have no idea what you'll be doing there'll be a few of you that'll be in the youth group won't even be you won't even be welcome into the front two rows next year you have to go to the back and you'll be last to go for ice cream too so don't grow up but you know you got to have a guide somebody who knows the way knows what's supposed to happen somebody who can lead and guide you who can tell me the best guide in the whole universe yes god he's the best guide he's the only one who knows the future right i tell you if i was picking a guide to guide my life i would want the one who knows what the future looks like who knows what's supposed to happen tomorrow and supposed to happen the day after that that's the kind of leader that i want which kind of leader do you guys want do you want a blind guide who wants a blind guide you don't want a blind guy yeah see that was fun you run into stuff and fall down and who who was confused by all the voices anybody you'd be confused who wants to do that but if you had to pick the three different ways that we we we ran this course how many if you had to do it and everything in your life dependent on it how many would want to go the last way where you had a guide that would go before you and a guide that would lead you by their voice a guide who could reach out and touch you and stop you anytime that you needed to be stopped who could protect you in the dangerous places well that guide's name is jesus christ the guide that you want the guide that i have in my life the guide that you can have in your life is jesus christ and he guides you by his spirit brother branham tells us a story of the rich young ruler and i'm going to read just one more passage of scripture about the rich young ruler it says and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled down to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and sent to him master all these have i observed from my youth then jesus beholding him loved him jesus loved this man behold him and loved him and he said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way so whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me does anybody remember the story of the rich young ruler what did he do next can one of you tell me what he did next after jesus told him to sell everything and come follow yes to us he didn't do it did he he said he walked away sad because he had a lot of riches but he stood in front of jesus and jesus gave him an invitation jesus said sell everything you have and you'll have treasures in heaven i want to ask you ladies a question which do you think is better treasures on earth or treasures in heaven yes treasures in heaven who would want to keep treasures on earth when you can have treasures in heaven so here this rich young ruler he had a lot of treasures but god jesus christ said if you'll just sell those which you can't keep forever anyways if you sell those you can have the ones that you can keep forever treasures in heaven i would have done it in an instant i'd have sold everything to have the treasures in heaven and then he said give all your treasures to the poor and then he says take up your cross and follow me now if jesus looked at you and he says follow me how many of you would turn around and walk away no but this young man did jesus was standing there and said sell all that take up your cross and follow me and he walked away sad because he had riches and he had this was the chance of a lifetime to have jesus christ standing there saying you can have treasures in heaven which will you have forever you can have eternal life and all you have to do is follow me who doesn't want to follow him anyways and this young man chose to go his own way and we know that when he died he went to hell and he was lost and what a sad place to be when jesus was standing there in the flesh and he could have followed him but i want to tell you that today jesus is asking you the same thing he's asking you to give up everything in the world and if you give up everything in the world he'll give you everything in heaven and if you'll give up your own way and you'll you'll choose to to take up your cross that means to give up your life you can follow him and i say what a good opportunity that you have today that you don't have to go your own way you don't have to be led by other blind people you don't have to be led by all the voices in the world but there is a shepherd here today amen the spirit of god is available the holy spirit which is the spirit of jesus christ here to lead and guide each one of us who will allow him to do so and if you want a good shepherd and you want a good leader in your life you can have one all you have to do is forget your way and go his way brother branham said in the message leadership he said but now who leads you that's the question now now we're all led by something tonight we have to be we're led and what brother branham was telling us is we're all led by something we're led by our own ideas we're led by the ideas of friends we're led by their voice we're all led by something who's leading you now and i just say jesus is here he'll lead you if you'll follow his voice this is the rich young ruler jesus is telling him if you'll just sell and give to the poor i'll give you treasures in heaven and you can follow me and this young man walked away from the greatest opportunity anybody ever had but you know i don't want to be like this rich young ruler he was rich he had all kinds of big houses and a big farm and he got so rich one day he said soul take your rest live easy you've got more than enough and and the bible says thou fool your soul be required of you this day and he died and he had nothing in heaven he had no treasure in heaven and he had not followed jesus when it come time for him to die he had nothing he was empty i don't want to be like this man i want to be like one of these sheep i want to follow the good shepherd i want to follow the voice of the lord and i want to be led by him i don't want to have to find my own way because i'm blind to my own way i don't want another blind person to lead me because we'll both fall in the ditch i don't want all the voices in the world to lead me everybody's got an idea and they're going to confuse you you're going to get confused do i go right do i go left do i turn around do i stop do i go forward but there's one voice i want to hear and that's the voice of our shepherd the voice of the lord speaking through his word and i want that spirit to speak into my heart and lead me blake if you can come forward i'd like to sing a song blake and jack if you can come and i i want us to sing together let's all stand and we'll sing this song together we're going to sing this song lead me lord and i will follow let me start it whenever [Music] lead me lord and i will go you have called me i will answer lead me lord and i will [Music] and go will follow lead me lord and i will go you have called me i will answer lead me lord and i will go one more time and i will follow lead and i will go you have called me i will answer lead me lord and i will go i remember when i was eight years old when the lord started dealing with me i was an eight-year-old little boy is there anybody here that's eight years old anybody eight eight years old that's how old i was when god started to pull up my heart and men didn't know the truth i didn't know the message i didn't know god sent a prophet but i knew one thing i knew i loved god and i wanted to follow jesus and i want him to have my life i knew that and i didn't know anything else and god started dealing with me when i was eight years old and i remember kneeling down and praying i went to an altar in our church and i prayed and i cried and i just wanted to be saved and i just wanted to know that god knew i wanted god to know that i loved him and i and i prayed to god and god has always dealt with me and led me all my life i didn't always follow him i didn't always do the right things i didn't always follow his voice sometimes i followed blind guides and i got in trouble there were times that i followed all the voices and i got wayward but any time that i listened to that voice the voice of the spirit of god leading in my heart he always led me the right way and god oh i always loved god and god always loved me if you're one of god's children he has always loved you and inside you always love him i'd like for us to pray together let everyone bow our heads everybody bow your heads and close your eyes that i'd like for anybody that's in here to have the opportunity that i have all you young ones close your eyes if you want god to know if you want jesus to know that you want him to be your shepherd you can raise your hand right now nobody's watching but if you want god to know you love him and you want god to know that i want you to be my shepherd and i want to follow you i want to give my heart and my life to you lord jesus and i want to follow you all my life just raise your hand you know god can see god can look down and he can see he can see not just your hand you can see what's in your heart you can put your hands down and let's pray together and as i pray you pray to you pray and tell jesus that you love him and that you want to follow him and you always want to hear his voice and tell him you don't want the other voices and you don't want blind guys but you want his voice to lead you and he'll lead you all the days of your life and i'll pray with you but you pray from your heart lord jesus these children lord they love you god they've come to learn about you today they were excited to come and learn something from your word god i
