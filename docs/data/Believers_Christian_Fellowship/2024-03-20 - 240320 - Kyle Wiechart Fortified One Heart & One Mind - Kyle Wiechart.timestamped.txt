[11:12] we're so thankful that you've given us
[11:14] another day Lord Lord how your word is
[11:16] so precious to us and every day that we
[11:18] get to hear it it's so precious as I was
[11:21] thinking this morning Lord how Greatful
[11:23] I Am Lord that you came my way many
[11:26] years ago you didn't have to but you did
[11:29] and all of us in our hearts are so
[11:31] thankful that you came our way you
[11:33] didn't have to there was nothing in us
[11:35] that deserved your presence to draw n
[11:38] but you predestinated us to a certain
[11:40] time and a place Lord that we'd hear
[11:42] this most precious word and we would be
[11:44] transformed to the creatures that we
[11:46] were and to sons of God and I just pray
[11:49] Lord God that you would bless this time
[11:51] that you've given us to gather once more
[11:54] father Lord we've come to be made more
[11:57] into your image father we've come come
[11:59] to be cut we've come to be molded shaped
[12:02] Lord uh Lord expose anything in us
[12:05] that's not like you father it's our
[12:07] heart's desire Lord is just to have you
[12:10] reflected through our lives father
[12:12] father I pray that you'd anoint my mind
[12:15] and my lips Lord in a simple humble way
[12:17] Lord help me just say what you once said
[12:20] Lord may you anoint the ears that are
[12:22] before me Lord that they would hear just
[12:25] what you want them to hear father I pray
[12:27] that you would strengthen us and may we
[12:29] all be happy when we leave here tonight
[12:31] we praise you and we thank you in jesus'
[12:35] name amen amen you may be seated for
[12:38] just a
[12:39] moment I always need just a few moments
[12:42] to say something to relax myself you
[12:43] know how this
[12:45] goes uh want to say I appreciate the
[12:48] ones that texted me today I uh really
[12:50] appreciate it I woke up this morning at
[12:52] 3:30 with a migraine and hadn't had a
[12:54] migraine for years and got sick really
[12:57] sick this morning so those text really
[12:59] meant a lot to me it took me until about
[13:01] noon where I felt like I was in my right
[13:02] mind today and so I appreciated those
[13:05] texts brother gab brother Emanuel they
[13:07] really mean a lot just knowing someone's
[13:09] praying for you heard from Brother Chad
[13:11] he's doing well he appreciates all the
[13:13] prayers and everyone I know that's
[13:15] praying for him he was last I heard he
[13:17] was traveling to Melbourne and I really
[13:20] don't know any other places in Australia
[13:22] I should have played more attention in
[13:23] geography class but Down Yonder he's
[13:26] just traveling all over so keep him in
[13:29] in prayer but he said the meetings are
[13:30] going really well I really appreciated
[13:33] brother Simon I know um brother John
[13:35] said that they're at the airport or
[13:37] flying but I think we all appreciated
[13:38] their family being here and I really
[13:41] appreciated the service on Sunday and
[13:43] how often times have we said I go
[13:45] fishing life is frustrating I go fishing
[13:49] we've all been there we've all said that
[13:50] I know I have a few times and Lord will
[13:53] and I won't say that no more we'll walk
[13:55] into the calling that God's called us
[13:56] and the purpose by which he brought us
[13:58] onto this Earth but when we do get
[14:00] discouraged he knows how to encourage us
[14:02] to keep on going appreciated his sermon
[14:05] and I heard brother Gabe had a good
[14:07] service last Sunday that was wonderful I
[14:10] asked him about it and it was just what
[14:12] the the doctor ordered Dr Jesus ordered
[14:15] and I know the people were really
[14:16] blessed and we're praying for you this
[14:18] Sunday too so we'll all be praying for
[14:20] brother Gabe on Sunday and uh you know
[14:23] me I'm trying to go through
[14:24] announcements and make me nervous and
[14:26] then after that we got brother Emanuel I
[14:28] believe on the next Wednesday be praying
[14:30] for you brother and then after that
[14:31] brother Chad will be back and wanted to
[14:33] tell everybody we had a service there on
[14:35] Saturday some of you came I saw some of
[14:37] your faces there it was really nice over
[14:39] in Holmes County they had built a a
[14:41] church there and they wanted to have a
[14:43] dedication services and they invited me
[14:45] over there Saturday night and I was
[14:47] honored to go and say a few words and uh
[14:50] had no clue what I was going to say I
[14:53] really struggled for the service cuz I
[14:55] just didn't know what to expect uh I
[14:57] didn't know where I was going I didn't
[14:58] know what I mean I knew where I was
[14:59] going but I just I had knowwhere I
[15:01] nowhere where I I did not know where I
[15:03] was going in Ministry I didn't know what
[15:05] to preach I just didn't know what to
[15:07] preach and and uh 3 hours before service
[15:10] a little thought came to my mind and um
[15:13] I believe the Lord blessed it I heard
[15:15] that from the people that it was a real
[15:17] blessing to them and it was kind of a
[15:18] strange little title for me I took
[15:20] unlikely unlikely but true Witnesses and
[15:24] uh you know it's an unlikely situation
[15:26] that you see a church over there in
[15:27] Holmes County and God used unlikely
[15:30] individuals through unlikely situation
[15:32] for the glory of God to now make a
[15:34] little Beacon of light over there
[15:35] amongst the Amish that's shining and
[15:38] none of us would have expected it if you
[15:39] were going to coordinate that to be uh a
[15:42] place where the gospel would go forth
[15:43] none of us would have put together a
[15:44] plan like that one everyone um but God
[15:47] likes to do things in unusual ways and
[15:50] he uses us as unusual peop uh to be true
[15:54] Witnesses of his grace and of his mercy
[15:56] and um and I it it was a blessing just
[15:59] to be there I was really happy and and I
[16:03] uh so appreciated so many that did come
[16:05] out um and so tonight you know it fth my
[16:10] lot yes here I am again and uh I was so
[16:14] uh I knew brother Chad asked me to take
[16:15] a service going to Australia and a
[16:17] couple weeks ago and I was sitting there
[16:20] when brother John kadema was preaching
[16:22] and oh I was so excited I caught
[16:24] inspiration I wrote down a whole page of
[16:26] notes it was awesome brother gab I mean
[16:28] it was like you feel so good about it
[16:30] you know he's like oh man I really love
[16:32] this and and in my mind I was like yep
[16:33] yep I got service coming up two and a
[16:35] half weeks this is unusual for me
[16:37] everyone I'm preaching that I got two
[16:39] and a half weeks to prepare get
[16:41] everything lined up perfectly and then
[16:44] brother Chad preached my entire
[16:45] inspiration that Sunday in the matters
[16:47] of the heart matters of the heart and it
[16:50] was bittersweet like I was enjoying it
[16:52] and yet I was so upset you know it's a
[16:54] minister I'm like now I have to labor
[16:56] and strain and
[16:59] he just knows how to keep us tore up he
[17:02] just he don't let us get real
[17:04] comfortable but I think that's how he
[17:06] wanted it he never wanted us shifting
[17:08] for ourselves he wanted you and I to be
[17:10] dependent upon him for every day every
[17:13] hour every minute of every day and every
[17:15] hour and so it was bittersweet but it
[17:17] was um it yeah God knows what he's doing
[17:21] so I had to go back to prayer and seek
[17:23] God's face for inspiration and here we
[17:25] are tonight so if you will stand with
[17:30] me I uh I'm just going to follow a
[17:33] little leading a little thought I
[17:34] haven't been able to get away from for
[17:37] oh about a week now and I just kept
[17:39] pushing it aside and till finally I just
[17:41] kind of went with it this morning and
[17:44] we'll see all the twists and the turns
[17:46] that we take um but we just trust the
[17:48] leadership of the Lord I I think that's
[17:50] how we wanted it in the beginning and
[17:52] take no thought for what you'll say I'll
[17:54] tell you what to say in the hour in
[17:55] which you're going to say it and so I'm
[17:58] learning to trust him in that so if you
[18:00] will turn in your Bibles to Psalms
[18:18] 61:2 Psalm
[18:21] 61:2 just say Amen when you're
[18:25] there from the end of the Earth will I
[18:27] cry unto thee when my heart is
[18:30] overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is
[18:33] higher than I for thou Hast been a
[18:36] shelter for me and a strong tower from
[18:40] the enemy I will abide in thy Tabernacle
[18:43] forever I will trust in the covert of
[18:46] thy wings and if you will turn to
[18:49] Philippians chapters 2 verse
[18:57] 1
[19:03] I think almost every Minister has
[19:04] ministered from this portion of
[19:06] scripture here in the last few months
[19:08] and it just seems like I can never get
[19:10] away from it here
[19:12] lately the word of God reads if there be
[19:15] therefore any consolation in Christ if
[19:18] any comfort of love if any Fellowship of
[19:21] the spirit if any bowels of mercies
[19:24] fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded
[19:27] having the same love being of one Accord
[19:32] of one mind let nothing be done through
[19:36] Strife for vain Glory but in lonliness
[19:39] of Mind each
[19:41] esteem Let each esteem other better than
[19:45] themselves look not every man on his own
[19:48] things but every man also on the things
[19:51] of others let this mind be in you which
[19:55] was also in Christ Jesus who being in
[19:57] the form of God thought it not robbery
[19:59] to be equal with God but made himself of
[20:02] no reputation took upon him the form of
[20:05] a servant and was made in the likeness
[20:07] of men and being found in the fashion as
[20:10] a man he humbled himself and became
[20:12] obedient unto death even the death of
[20:15] the Cross May God add His blessings to
[20:18] the reading of the word you may be
[20:19] seated this
[20:20] [Music]
[20:21] evening and a portion of that word that
[20:24] I uh scriptures that I'd like to really
[20:26] hone in on is uh the second verse
[20:29] fulfill ye my joy that you be likeminded
[20:32] having the same love being of one Accord
[20:35] and of one mind as a title I'd like to
[20:38] title this fortified in one heart and in
[20:41] one mind um and when we think of the
[20:45] word fortified we realize it's a uh
[20:47] something that is a protection to us
[20:49] it's something we can stand behind and
[20:51] that may be real simple but we're simple
[20:53] folk tonight if that's all right I think
[20:55] the scripture said except you can become
[20:56] like a child you can't even enter into
[20:58] the the kingdom of God so I'm going to
[21:00] try to stay real simple and if you don't
[21:02] mind you just pull as best as you can
[21:04] but I want to just take this from almost
[21:06] like a kid-like view for me I get
[21:08] excited to know that I'm unable but my
[21:11] God is able to protect me I I get
[21:13] excited to know that he's the one that's
[21:15] foreseeing every aspect of my life he
[21:17] knew the things that I was going to
[21:19] encounter he knew the difficulties he
[21:21] knew the UPS he knew the Downs he knew
[21:23] the high points he knew the valleys and
[21:24] he ordained it all and he had a purpose
[21:26] in all of it and sometimes we only like
[21:28] to be on a Mountaintop but sometimes
[21:30] what's in the valley is more needful for
[21:32] you than what's on the mountain top and
[21:34] that's just human nature we don't like
[21:36] difficulty we don't like pain we don't
[21:38] like discomfort but sometimes the only
[21:40] things that you the things you need the
[21:42] most are only found down in the deep
[21:44] dark Valley that you don't want to go
[21:46] and that's sometimes the place that God
[21:48] must lead you if you're more desirous to
[21:50] be conformed Into His Image than you are
[21:52] in the comfortableness of this life
[21:54] God's got a predestinated path into the
[21:57] valley of darkness just for you
[21:59] but the beauty of the whole thing is
[22:01] he's there my shepherd and my guide he's
[22:04] my Fortress he's my rock so I'm
[22:07] fortified I'm sheltered wherever he is
[22:10] it doesn't matter the circumstances
[22:12] around me it doesn't matter how dark it
[22:14] gets if he's there my rock I'm sheltered
[22:18] and I'm fortified and I'm protected and
[22:20] nothing can harm me in the midst of it
[22:23] all you believe that see I believe that
[22:26] I believe when when they would go to
[22:27] build a city they first started off by
[22:29] building a wall and that wall was a
[22:32] fortress it was a protection it was a
[22:34] defense right and that defense was the
[22:37] first thing you put up before you put a
[22:39] lot of time and energy and and money
[22:41] into the things that's within the city
[22:43] the first thing you make sure you got is
[22:44] a fort a fortified wall of Defense
[22:47] around you right when you have a home
[22:49] you buy a new home what's the first
[22:50] thing you do you change the locks you
[22:53] want your possessions and the things
[22:54] that are most valuable to you protected
[22:57] so you make sure the lock are changed
[22:59] and when God was going to protect us he
[23:02] gave us the only thing we had need for
[23:04] protection he gave us his word himself
[23:08] he gave me him his word and it wasn't
[23:12] depending it only it didn't only work if
[23:14] I understood it all or I could mentally
[23:16] figure it all out he didn't say did you
[23:19] understand he said Do you believe it do
[23:21] you believe it has always been the
[23:22] question and I I came to this thought as
[23:25] a result of a conversation I had the
[23:27] other night at the Saturday night
[23:28] meeting there was a man for those of you
[23:30] got up and he testified he wanted to
[23:33] thank God for keeping him away from
[23:35] drugs for one year wow and the people
[23:38] were happy and he said I just want to
[23:40] thank God for keeping me and protecting
[23:42] me from these drugs I said well praise
[23:45] God and he came up to me after the
[23:47] service and what was funny about it was
[23:50] he came up to me he said I want to
[23:51] apologize I said what happened he said
[23:53] it was such a good service but I fell
[23:56] asleep and I saw him I did see him in
[23:59] the back I saw him sleeping you know the
[24:01] first thing you think brother G he's
[24:02] like how can you sleep I'm going to
[24:03] raise my
[24:05] voice I'm going to talk louder but he
[24:08] came up to he was real sincere real he
[24:10] said he said sir I really enjoyed that
[24:12] message he said I'm so sorry I fell
[24:15] asleep I said well that's okay he said
[24:17] I'm on a medicine he said I have some
[24:19] mental
[24:20] problems and he said I'm on a powerful
[24:23] medicine and he said in the evening time
[24:25] I can't stay awake he said I didn't mean
[24:27] to fall asleep I really really didn't an
[24:29] instant you know your heart's like oh I
[24:31] I understand you know I'm afraid I'm
[24:34] sorry I even thought about raising my
[24:35] voice when I saw you say he was so
[24:38] thankful and he wanted to apologize cuz
[24:40] it he he he he thought I might have he
[24:42] might have offended me sleeping on the
[24:44] back real and I said that's okay buddy I
[24:46] said that's quite all right I said I was
[24:48] so encouraged by your testimony the
[24:50] grace of God holding you keeping you
[24:52] from those things he said yes he said
[24:54] and I'm believing one day he'll deliver
[24:56] me from these medicines from my mind I
[24:58] said I do too I said hey do you know the
[25:01] scripture he was wounded for our
[25:03] transgressions he was bruised for our
[25:05] iniquities the chastisement our peace
[25:07] upon him and with his stripes you're
[25:08] healed he said yes sir I know that
[25:10] scripture I said okay you stand on that
[25:12] scripture and every time your mind
[25:13] starts giving you crazy thoughts and you
[25:16] start going a little bit nerve-racked I
[25:18] said you just keep standing on that word
[25:20] and I knew he needed more than a hope he
[25:22] was hoping for but he needed something a
[25:24] rock he needed something he could stand
[25:27] on when those storms get to come towards
[25:29] him you know it's not brother banam said
[25:31] that man's Faith must be grounded in the
[25:34] Bedrock of God's word not the shifting
[25:37] Sands of man's ideas we have a Bedrock
[25:40] we have a solid rock Foundation our
[25:42] faith must anchor in the Simplicity of
[25:45] his word that's where I'm fortified and
[25:48] that's where that young man was
[25:49] fortified and I began to think about it
[25:51] he said will you pray for me I said I
[25:53] absolutely will I said I'll be thinking
[25:55] about you and you be thinking about him
[25:57] and as I began to think I says I'll be
[25:58] praying for you constantly he said I
[26:00] believe that God will deliver me one of
[26:02] these days from this I said I do too and
[26:05] that's where I got to thinking about
[26:07] something cuz the Bible talks about
[26:09] wherever two or three Witnesses are
[26:11] gathered he's in the presence and if one
[26:14] or two can agree on touching anything
[26:16] I'll do it and I began to think it's so
[26:19] interesting God likes to see us come
[26:22] together and stand together believing
[26:23] the same thing there's some type of
[26:26] power there's some type of uh I um
[26:29] strength that comes in a unified
[26:32] agreement on God's word like when we
[26:35] stand together you you ever notice like
[26:36] a husband and wife when they stand
[26:38] together and there's a Harmony in the
[26:40] home everything settles the kids settle
[26:41] down but when there's a tension and
[26:43] there's something not quite right then
[26:45] the kids start to acen up and
[26:47] something's wrong because there's no
[26:48] Harmony it's like that in a workplace if
[26:51] two people are working together it needs
[26:53] a Harmony and it's like that in a church
[26:56] it takes a Harmony and a Unity
[26:58] you know and brother bham talked about
[27:00] the great composer the great composer
[27:02] like Beethoven he writes a beautiful
[27:04] piece he said but thou the conductor
[27:06] must get into the Same Spirit of the one
[27:08] who wrote the word you see and that's
[27:11] where I loved brother b or brother
[27:12] Chad's sermon the matters of the heart
[27:14] he was talking about being in the right
[27:16] Spirit of the letter and that was my
[27:18] inspiration it's one thing to have the
[27:20] letter but I must know the author and
[27:22] his nature in order to do or play it the
[27:25] way he wants it played and so all these
[27:28] I began to realize oh my goodness he's
[27:30] knit us together for a purpose so no
[27:33] wonder the devil likes to shoot us likes
[27:36] to cause disagreements likes to cause
[27:38] issues difficulties painful uh rubbings
[27:41] and stuff like that it's a good thing
[27:43] for us we need to go through it but oh
[27:45] my goodness it's also something that
[27:47] stops you in your
[27:49] tracks God wanted a a a Unity if there's
[27:52] something about it and I I want you to
[27:54] turn in your Bibles to Genesis
[27:57] 11:3 there's something about this I hope
[28:00] this is okay I told you I just go as I
[28:03] feel led I don't overthink things too
[28:06] much but I want to talk about this
[28:08] fortified in one heart and in one mind
[28:12] and there's this portion of scripture
[28:14] back in Genesis when they're building
[28:16] the Tower of Babel that I always been
[28:18] amazed with and I think almost anybody
[28:20] reads the Bible you're kind of like this
[28:21] is amazing this is an amazing scripture
[28:23] here he says and they said one to
[28:26] another to to to uh go to let us make
[28:30] brick and burn them thoroughly and they
[28:32] had brick for stone and slime that they
[28:36] had they for Mortar and they said go to
[28:38] let us build us a city and a tower whose
[28:41] top May reach unto heaven and let us
[28:44] make a name lest we be scattered abroad
[28:46] upon the face of the earth and the Lord
[28:49] came down to see the city and the tower
[28:52] which the children of men builded and
[28:55] the Lord said behold the people is one
[28:58] and they have all one language and this
[29:01] they begin to do and now nothing will be
[29:04] restrained from them which they have
[29:06] imagined to
[29:09] do these are carnal men these are
[29:13] worldly men these are not Christians
[29:16] these are not sons of God these are
[29:18] worldly carnal men that have got into
[29:20] one mind and in one Accord and now
[29:23] nothing would be refused to them now if
[29:26] God would say that about a carnal in
[29:28] doing what they wanted to do what about
[29:30] a people of God that have been called
[29:32] out and ordained to stand in this final
[29:34] hour with the promises of his word what
[29:37] can be withheld from them what can be
[29:40] withheld from them nothing they have one
[29:44] heart one mind and it's his mind it's
[29:47] his will and if there's that Harmony
[29:50] what can stand before you if God be
[29:52] before me who can be against me there's
[29:55] such a Harmony and a unity and there's
[29:57] something that God cannot refuse it's
[30:00] like he can't refuse this he's saying
[30:02] this about them I can't they will
[30:05] accomplish this I've got to confuse
[30:07] their language it's an amazing thing and
[30:11] Philippians you know likeminded having
[30:14] same love being of one Accord and of one
[30:17] mind am let nothing be done through
[30:19] Strife or vain Glory but in lowliness of
[30:22] Mind esteem each other better than
[30:24] themselves you see there's like brother
[30:26] Ben was saying there's no big ones
[30:28] amongst us they're not better than
[30:31] anybody else we're not brighter than
[30:33] anybody else we condescend like nobody
[30:36] else the Bride of Jesus Christ should be
[30:38] able to make herself lowly like nobody
[30:40] else that's ever walked the Earth not to
[30:42] say look at me and look at this and I
[30:44] know this and I know this and you don't
[30:45] know this and you should do this no they
[30:47] actually constantly lift you up
[30:49] constantly push you up make you feel
[30:52] like the bigger person wasn't that the
[30:54] testimony of brother banam he made you
[30:56] feel like the bigger person yes yes yeah
[30:59] he made you feel like you are something
[31:01] and he's
[31:02] nothing that's a real that's that's
[31:05] somebody that's got something doesn't
[31:08] look down upon you you should be able to
[31:10] be where I'm at no he pushes you up
[31:14] makes you realize that you're something
[31:16] special too in the eyes of God as little
[31:18] as you may be makes you feel good and I
[31:21] think that's the attitude we must have
[31:22] amongst each other I think that's a
[31:24] unity and a common love and a common
[31:26] mind that we are to have have one
[31:28] amongst the other don't you and i' just
[31:31] been looking at and I see that's exactly
[31:33] what the prophet of God said was going
[31:34] to happen there would be such a love a
[31:36] Unity a one mindness amongst the
[31:40] people he says it he says um he says so
[31:44] exactly the way it was in the beginning
[31:46] it is today he was the word to the human
[31:49] race in the beginning God never gave the
[31:51] human race a church to stand behind
[31:54] never gave them a Creed to stand behind
[31:56] but you see he for fortified a human
[31:59] behind his word to just believe his word
[32:02] and to live by it that's what we're
[32:05] fortified behind not my human intellects
[32:07] or my human reasoning or what I can
[32:09] figure out I'm just believing his word
[32:12] I'm just believing his word and I'm
[32:14] believing that the same Harmony that the
[32:16] son had with the father I'm going to
[32:18] have with
[32:19] him pergam and church age notice the
[32:21] harmony of the father and of the son
[32:23] Jesus never did anything until he first
[32:25] showed him was showed him by the the
[32:28] Father John 5:19 this harmony is now to
[32:31] exist between the groom and his bride he
[32:34] shows her his word of life and she
[32:36] receives it and she never doubts it
[32:38] therefore nothing can harm her what is
[32:42] she fortified behind his word nothing
[32:46] can harm
[32:47] her not even
[32:50] death for if a seed be planted the water
[32:53] will raise it up again here is the
[32:55] secret of this the word is in the bride
[32:58] as it was in Mary the bride has the mind
[33:01] of Christ for she knows what he wants
[33:03] done with the word she performs the
[33:06] command of the word in his name for she
[33:09] has thus sayith the Lord then the word
[33:11] is quickened by the spirit and it comes
[33:13] to pass like a seed that is planted and
[33:15] watered it comes to full Harvest serving
[33:19] its purpose those in the bride do only
[33:22] his will no one can make them do
[33:25] otherwise no one I love that as I've
[33:28] been looking back to Ecclesiastes
[33:30] there's a time to speak there's a time
[33:32] to be silent there's a time to build
[33:34] there's a time to plant there's a time
[33:35] to build up there's a time to tear down
[33:37] you know what I realize usually when you
[33:39] want to speak it's time to be
[33:42] quiet and when you want to be quiet it's
[33:44] time to speak and when you want to sew
[33:47] something up it's time to Rend it to
[33:49] part there's just a time he makes
[33:52] everything beautiful in his time his
[33:55] time not yours we're on his time
[33:57] schedule mine that's what I'm trying I'm
[33:59] trying to get in tune with the composer
[34:03] I want to walk in tune I said what okay
[34:05] he wants me to go this okay go now stop
[34:08] okay stop I won't go nowhere now I want
[34:11] you to go over here I want you to say
[34:12] this okay I'm going to say that and okay
[34:14] stop don't say no more oh okay I think
[34:17] he wants headship I think he wants
[34:20] leadership I think he wants you so
[34:22] yielded in your own natural life that
[34:24] the things you would do you can't do
[34:25] because he won't allow you to do them
[34:27] yes you remember how Paul Paul was
[34:29] restricted he was restrained by the Holy
[34:31] Ghost in preaching the gospel he said no
[34:34] you can't go over there I don't want you
[34:36] to go over there I want you to go over
[34:37] here okay I follow the leadership of the
[34:39] Lord that's what I love we're just
[34:40] sheep we're just sheep we get to stay
[34:44] simple we get to stay humble you know
[34:46] brother bandam said my Ministry types
[34:48] that at John the Baptist exactly where
[34:51] John the Baptist stood and he said
[34:52] behold the
[34:53] lamb brother bam said his ministry types
[34:56] is exactly I believe he'll be saying
[34:58] behold there she is amen the Lamb's
[35:03] wife she just follows his leading
[35:05] wherever he says go she goes whenever he
[35:08] says speak she speaks whenever he says
[35:11] sit down be quiet you sit down and be
[35:14] quiet just learning to follow his lead
[35:17] but you know how how much comfort I can
[35:19] have in that that I don't have to figure
[35:21] out my own life I don't have to figure
[35:23] out the difficulties I don't have to try
[35:25] to reason with my own human ability how
[35:28] to solve problems you know how much rest
[35:31] we can have as a believer in Christ it's
[35:34] so simple and so humle is this okay okay
[35:37] okay I I like a little bit talking back
[35:40] you know me I just like a little bit of
[35:42] something you know if I'm sitting at the
[35:43] table and you're just staring at me all
[35:44] long I just don't want to say nothing
[35:46] you got give me something but you know
[35:49] that's just the way it is God wants us
[35:51] this way he wants us to just be relying
[35:54] upon him not trying to shift for
[35:56] ourselves not trying to figure
[35:57] everything everything out what' my word
[35:58] say he says what' my word say he said uh
[36:00] I'll never leave you no forsake okay
[36:02] that's it just keep walking I said I'll
[36:04] never leave you forsake you just start
[36:05] walking and we can rest in those
[36:08] things and so in Matthew 18:18 I have a
[36:12] lot of scriptures so feel free to turn I
[36:16] wanted to just go through some of this
[36:17] I'll try to slow down a little bit I've
[36:20] been told sometimes to speak too fast
[36:23] it's because I'm a nervous
[36:25] individual I'm sorry I'll slow down for
[36:27] a moment praise God Matthew
[36:32] 1818 it says verily I say unto you
[36:35] whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be
[36:37] bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall
[36:39] loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven
[36:42] again I say unto you that if two of you
[36:45] shall agree on Earth as touching
[36:48] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[36:51] done for them of My Father which is in
[36:54] heaven for where two or three are
[36:57] gathered GED together in my name there I
[37:00] am in the midst of them we we recognize
[37:03] that and we believe that wherever two or
[37:05] three are gathered we've said it so many
[37:07] times there I am in the midst of them
[37:09] but then to say now if you two will
[37:10] agree as touching anything I'll do that
[37:13] too what kind of confidence does God
[37:15] have in two Believers if they unite
[37:18] according to the promise of his word ask
[37:20] whatever you want I'll do it it's an
[37:23] amazing thing the kind of uh what God is
[37:26] offering over to the true believer in
[37:28] Christ Jesus I believe he's going to
[37:29] have so much confidence in us he knows
[37:32] we won't ask for the wrong things I
[37:34] believe we're he's going to be able to
[37:36] say it's okay he won't say the wrong
[37:38] thing I'll give him the power to bind
[37:40] anything or loose anything he'll say the
[37:43] right thing like sister hadie right she
[37:46] said the right thing the right woman
[37:49] simple woman just said the right thing
[37:50] at the right time in the presence of the
[37:52] right one and the third pole was
[37:54] manifested but he knew she'd ask for the
[37:57] right thing so I believe there's a
[38:00] confidence and we got to learn obedience
[38:01] through much suffering but it's coming
[38:03] to a place that God will have enough
[38:05] confidence to say whatever you say I'll
[38:09] do it amen I love that about him Amen in
[38:12] a thinking man's filter he says as it
[38:15] was as the days grow closer and closer
[38:18] and there is a narrowing of the path we
[38:21] want to go we want we want to go closer
[38:25] together may we must
[38:28] may we must be just one one in body may
[38:33] we all move together forgetting one
[38:36] another's sins or our differences just
[38:39] sticking closer and closer and closer as
[38:44] we see the day approaching assembling
[38:47] ourselves together all in one Accord and
[38:50] in one heart and if a brother or sister
[38:53] gets out of the way in any way don't do
[38:56] nothing butay pray for that person and
[38:59] in love always considering one another
[39:02] don't never let one of you get away you
[39:06] stay together if you can and add more to
[39:11] it constantly all the time am just get
[39:14] closer closer closer don't let nothing
[39:17] get amongst us don't let nothing break
[39:19] our fellowship don't let nothing break
[39:21] the harmony a love that we have and and
[39:24] we're United by a common love a love
[39:27] that God has shed Upon Our Hearts and
[39:30] the love the mutual love that we have
[39:31] for him it's binds us together you know
[39:34] the little story you know the husband
[39:35] and a wife they were fussing they were
[39:37] fighting this one couldn't get along
[39:39] with this one and they're going to have
[39:40] to separate and they're separating all
[39:42] the goods brother brandham said until
[39:44] they were fighting through stuff in the
[39:45] in the a chest or a closet or something
[39:47] like that until they climb across a
[39:49] little shoe that little shoe now these
[39:52] two that were at Great differences then
[39:54] found something they had in common and
[39:56] it was a mutual love that they had for
[39:58] one little baby and then they both
[40:01] realize they both have a part in this
[40:03] this is for both of them they both had
[40:06] something in that little baby how could
[40:08] one say I have it and you don't have it
[40:10] and at times I think you have to realize
[40:12] there is a common thing that we have in
[40:14] common we may have a lot of differences
[40:16] at time you know I like chocolate cake
[40:19] and brother gab probably like Cherry
[40:24] huh we like a lot of different things we
[40:26] like dessert if anybody wants to make
[40:28] this dessert 2400 loots Road send it my
[40:31] way or brother gab's way he can give you
[40:33] his address anytime he'll be happy to
[40:35] offer it to you but the reality of is
[40:37] sometimes we have differences we see
[40:39] things differently uh we are different
[40:41] in our natures and at times we can rub
[40:44] each other a little bit wrong but we
[40:46] have something in common and that
[40:48] something in common should be way
[40:50] greater than the little differences we
[40:52] have there's nothing more difficult or
[40:54] nothing more straining when you see two
[40:56] people that have a little bit too much
[40:58] of a differences and they don't have
[40:59] enough of a common mutual love one for
[41:01] the other all they can see is their
[41:03] differences and then there's no Harmony
[41:06] have it in a home home's a
[41:07] wreck have it in a business business is
[41:10] a wreck have it in a church church is a
[41:14] wreck there's something about
[41:16] maintaining a Harmony because you're
[41:18] holding up a common thing that you have
[41:21] that's of such great importance to you
[41:23] and that's the love of Christ and that's
[41:25] a love that you should have one
[41:28] it means too much it means too
[41:31] much so we should just be drawing closer
[41:34] and closer together first Peter if you
[41:36] won't if you don't mind turn there a lot
[41:39] of scriptures
[41:40] so First Peter chapter
[41:48] 3:8 it says finally be all of One mind
[41:54] having compassion one of the other love
[41:58] as Brethren be pitiful and be
[42:02] courteous that's a tall standing for us
[42:05] Christians sometimes you know pitiful
[42:08] have pity amen have pity be full of pity
[42:14] for somebody else you don't know what
[42:16] they're going through you don't know why
[42:18] they're going through it you don't know
[42:20] what's going on in their mind or the
[42:22] situation that's all about them maybe
[42:24] they act a little cross at you you don't
[42:26] know what they're going be pitiful have
[42:29] much
[42:30] pity it says and be
[42:34] courteous you know that means be
[42:38] kind
[42:40] wow the or Peter is here commending the
[42:43] church he's saying hey guys be kind it's
[42:47] sad that he has to say that but it's
[42:49] true am sometimes we get just a little
[42:52] bit too
[42:54] religious yes oh I can't say hi to him
[42:58] brother just be kind be sweet be pitiful
[43:03] have much pity amen be sweet one of the
[43:06] worst things is see some of that can't
[43:08] even be
[43:09] kind just can't even say hello God bless
[43:12] you how you doing you doing good great
[43:17] show pity show kindness don't talk about
[43:21] it show it amen you know it comes a
[43:24] certain point in time we got to be a
[43:26] living epistle being read of all men not
[43:28] heard yeah I heard what you were saying
[43:30] can I see some of it for a little bit
[43:32] you know let me see it in Action a
[43:34] little bit let me see a pitiful person
[43:37] person that is full of kindness
[43:38] generosity love and concern one for the
[43:42] other person
[43:46] amen pretty deep huh be
[43:50] kind be kind it says not rendering evil
[43:54] for evil or railing for railing but
[43:57] counterwise blessing someone treats you
[44:00] wrong talks bad about you hits you in a
[44:03] weak spot there points out where you're
[44:05] just not lining
[44:06] up you be sweet you be kind you be
[44:13] gentle don't let nothing break that
[44:16] Harmony and that common love that we
[44:18] have for the same one don't do it prise
[44:22] God knowing that ye are there unto
[44:25] called that ye should inherit a blessing
[44:27] for he that will love and seek good days
[44:30] let him refrain his tongue from evil and
[44:33] his lips that he speak no Gile watch
[44:38] what you say be careful amen don't say
[44:42] anything wrong don't say anything evil
[44:45] or contrary to the will and purpose of
[44:47] God I was thinking about those unlikely
[44:49] individuals you know and I had when I
[44:51] preached that there Saturday night I
[44:53] took the woman at the well and I thought
[44:55] you know if any of us were we going to
[44:57] set this stage for the Messiah to be
[45:00] announced in the city of samarra we
[45:02] would have probably found the most the
[45:05] best Christian I mean the the best
[45:07] believer there the most virgin woman
[45:09] like she never said a cross word and she
[45:12] would lived a good holy life cuz she
[45:14] would be the right kind of person to
[45:16] declare to the city of samarra the
[45:19] Messiah is here but when God In His
[45:22] Infinite mind he says no I have a
[45:24] perfect witness someone that will
[45:27] receive my grace and my word it's this
[45:29] immoral woman who's lived a horrible
[45:31] life she's just the right one to be a
[45:35] true and living witness that I am here
[45:38] and what better individual than your
[45:40] life and my life that's marred and we
[45:42] are prostitutes in our in in one way and
[45:46] this exterior way we are filthy rotten
[45:48] human beings like why would God ever use
[45:51] us to declare to this world he is alive
[45:54] and we being a true witness of the
[45:56] Resurrection not that was but a
[45:58] resurrection that is like we preach a
[46:01] resurrection that's right now you were
[46:03] once dead in sin and trespassed but now
[46:05] resurrected to two new life in Christ
[46:08] Jesus like he chose unlikely people so
[46:11] God wasn't looking at the outside and
[46:13] the immorality and you know even his
[46:15] disciples like I can't believe he's even
[46:17] talking to her don't you know the kind
[46:20] of life she
[46:22] lives I just
[46:25] ignore no
[46:27] Jesus said no that's the right one I
[46:29] know what's going on in her heart am
[46:32] when he began to have a conversation
[46:33] with you heard what was in her heart
[46:35] well some say we worship here and one
[46:36] say say where shall we worship ah what's
[46:39] going on there's a seed Gene of God on
[46:42] the inside drops her water pot and says
[46:45] surely this is the
[46:47] Messiah and she ran back to the city and
[46:50] the whole city came out to hear an
[46:52] immoral woman's testimony praise God
[46:55] Amen man now if God has no problem using
[46:58] an immoral woman to go spread the gospel
[47:01] and to be a true witness of a living God
[47:03] what do we ought to do with each other
[47:05] everyone each and every one of us we
[47:08] should highly
[47:09] esteem and treat sweet and kind and
[47:14] gentle because you know where God is in
[47:17] that
[47:18] person I was thinking that greater than
[47:20] Solomon is here and the Queen of Sheba
[47:22] that came from afar to see the order and
[47:25] the harmony amongst the kingdom and the
[47:28] people she was in all of the mutual love
[47:31] and respect and this one stayed in his
[47:34] place and this one was in his place and
[47:36] the baker did this and the cup Bearer
[47:37] did this and the King was here and it
[47:39] was such a Harmony in the city because
[47:42] they all recognize the gift of God that
[47:44] was in their
[47:46] midst God was in Flesh on earth now
[47:50] where's God in Flesh on Earth do you
[47:54] realize the amount of honor and respect
[47:57] we must give to each other we
[48:00] must you say that you love God whom you
[48:03] cannot see and you cannot love your
[48:04] brother whom you can see you need a
[48:06] revelation of the unveiling of God and
[48:09] where he is
[48:10] today he's here yes amen but just like
[48:16] it was thousands of years ago there's no
[48:18] beauty that we should be
[48:19] holding stricken smitten of God and cast
[48:22] down no Beauty we see all the flaws yeah
[48:26] we see the flaws but sometimes fail to
[48:28] see the
[48:31] Masterpiece Romans
[48:44] 121 Romans
[48:51] 121 it says I beseech you therefore
[48:54] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[48:55] present your body is a Living Sacrifice
[48:58] holy and acceptable unto God which is
[49:00] your reasonable
[49:01] service and that you be not conformed to
[49:04] this world but that you be transformed
[49:06] by the renewing of your mind that you
[49:08] may prove what is good acceptable and
[49:11] the perfect will of God for I say
[49:14] through the grace given unto me to every
[49:16] man that is among you not to think of
[49:19] himself more highly than he ought to
[49:21] think but to think soberly according as
[49:25] God hath thought to every free man a
[49:27] Measure of
[49:30] Faith think of someone else better than
[49:33] you keep in mind the Masterpiece beside
[49:36] you amen keep in mind that that's the
[49:39] one that God's veiled
[49:41] in lots of scars lots of cuts lots of
[49:44] bruises but that makes it the
[49:47] Masterpiece you know it's one thing to
[49:49] hear a masterpiece of 2,000 years ago
[49:51] but sometimes we fail to recognize the
[49:53] Masterpiece today amen that you
[49:57] can't you got to recognize the Mighty
[50:00] God that's unveiled amongst us the
[50:02] mystery of his coming just changing his
[50:04] mask the great condescension of God came
[50:06] from a thought to a word to a life yes
[50:11] amen now those living Epistles are being
[50:15] made manifested all around us and oh how
[50:17] we ought to treat them how we ought to
[50:20] honor and respect each and every one of
[50:24] usen if God chose you to unveil himself
[50:28] and God put a little itty bit of himself
[50:31] there then what ought you to do with
[50:33] that person amen that's God Amen big
[50:38] statement big statement but true
[50:41] unlikely but
[50:43] true Oneness brother brandham says now
[50:46] then came Pentecost God made them one
[50:49] again oh my then they had Oneness with
[50:53] God God was with them now acts if you're
[50:56] putting it down acts 4:32 the Bible said
[50:59] they were of one heart see and one soul
[51:02] and one mind oh brother my they had been
[51:06] restored back to their origin again and
[51:08] the only thing that was left to be
[51:11] disposed of was was the old
[51:14] body uh called the city or the temple
[51:17] where they lived it had to rot because
[51:19] it has to rot and corrupt but in spirit
[51:22] and in life and in purpose and in vision
[51:25] and in everything they were one with God
[51:29] one purpose one heart one mission one
[51:33] objective one with God we are one with
[51:36] another see that only thing they had
[51:38] they didn't have right was this old
[51:40] flesh that body that had to rot away and
[51:42] die so they could get a new body one of
[51:44] these days but in all other aspects
[51:47] exactly the same amen one purpose one
[51:51] objective One Vision that's it amen but
[51:55] a body that's rotting
[51:57] away and I'm glad that it's rotting
[52:00] away Isaiah 26 3 and 4 thou wil keep him
[52:05] in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[52:08] thee because he trusted in thee trust
[52:12] thee in the Lord forever for in the Lord
[52:14] Jehovah is Everlasting strength
[52:18] sometimes it's just hard to keep your
[52:20] mind stayed on that right Revelation yes
[52:23] because we can see so much amongst us
[52:26] it's sometimes hard for you to even see
[52:28] that you could be the very Dwelling
[52:31] Place of God I hope I'm not the only one
[52:34] at times all I can see is where I fail
[52:37] and I myself struggle with it not that I
[52:39] struggle with the message not that I
[52:41] struggle with the revealed word but I
[52:43] struggle with this revealed word I have
[52:45] a hard time seeing that this is the
[52:47] place of his dwelling that this is his
[52:49] Masterpiece I have a hard time seeing it
[52:52] but it's still the truth regardless I I
[52:55] tell you he said you can't god with your
[52:57] five senses it doesn't matter what I see
[53:00] it doesn't matter what I hear myself say
[53:02] sometimes it doesn't matter how I
[53:05] feel what matters is there's something
[53:07] down on the inside that says I'm a part
[53:10] of this nobody can take it away from me
[53:13] I was there it's for me I was a part of
[53:16] him then I'm a part of him now I just
[53:18] come down through time I'm a manifested
[53:21] attribute of his grace and this hour
[53:23] displaying the true and living God with
[53:26] all of my faults and all of my failures
[53:30] and you you all your faults and failures
[53:33] still a Dwelling Place of the most high
[53:35] God hard for me to see it sometimes
[53:38] easier for me to see it in you than than
[53:41] for me to see it in me just being honest
[53:45] it's hard but I still believe it amen
[53:48] though I just have a hard time mentally
[53:51] grasping it sometimes I'm just so glad
[53:55] like I was thinking about the other day
[53:57] is like you know you think about it with
[53:59] with Noah there was Noah on that day and
[54:02] everyone around him was saying Noah you
[54:04] have lost your mind you are crazy like
[54:08] you keep saying that you heard from God
[54:11] and you're his voice piece for the day
[54:14] and you keep saying it's going to rain
[54:17] and we have all these scientific
[54:19] instruments around us proving that
[54:22] you're a
[54:22] liar like you realize the advancement of
[54:26] science s and Technology was there to
[54:28] prove that God's word could not be held
[54:31] or kept like everything Advanced to a
[54:34] place to disprove God what do you
[54:37] think's going on today where is science
[54:40] and technology and the devices of man's
[54:43] imaginations that we have strapped to
[54:45] our hips or trying to do it's trying to
[54:48] deny the revelation of Christ in you if
[54:51] you haven't realized it there's a lot of
[54:53] scientific instruments and advancements
[54:55] and Tech technology with one purpose one
[54:58] objective what's the devil's objective
[55:00] to disprove God's
[55:03] word that's his whole objective you
[55:06] think science and technology is
[55:08] advancing so you can have an easier life
[55:10] no one objective disprove God's word and
[55:13] try to convince you you are not who you
[55:15] think you
[55:18] are so you better be careful you better
[55:21] gird up the loins of your mind you know
[55:23] gird it up like uh you know um uh you
[55:26] tie it up tight right so like if you I
[55:29] think in the old Orient you know when
[55:30] they would say gir up your the loins of
[55:32] your mind like they like gird up their
[55:33] jacket they got to go for a run you know
[55:35] we can't let this trip us up so he's
[55:37] saying G up the loins your mind don't
[55:38] let anything loose hanging around be
[55:41] careful what you're listening to careful
[55:42] what you're you're you're consuming cuz
[55:44] it's all there with one objective to
[55:47] discredit God's word and get you to
[55:49] disbelieve it all of this science
[55:52] technology and
[55:54] advancements but no just believed it
[55:57] Noah just believed that word Noah just
[56:00] believed that this word was the truth
[56:04] and he put his life to it yes amen
[56:07] everything he had he gave to
[56:09] it he testified that he believed what he
[56:12] believed in the life that he lived every
[56:15] single day am not just what he
[56:19] preached but he went to work cutting
[56:21] down the trees putting it all together
[56:24] boiling the sap every day for 120 years
[56:28] he was testifying that he believed what
[56:30] he said and think about it it's not
[56:34] always that we have a quote it's not
[56:36] always that we can repeat a Bible verse
[56:39] what are you doing every day every
[56:42] moment of every day are you telling the
[56:44] world that you believe you're you're
[56:46] leaving soon do you believe you're going
[56:49] out of here
[56:50] sometime that this world is not your
[56:52] home you're just passing
[56:54] through are you giving giving your life
[56:57] to pursue all that it can offer you like
[57:00] Noah testified he believed the message
[57:03] by just getting up and cutting down
[57:06] trees I love that I love the Simplicity
[57:09] of that he just got up and did exactly
[57:12] what God called him to do build the ark
[57:14] amen and then I love it cuz God was in
[57:17] the ark amen he never said Noah go in
[57:20] the ark he said Noah come in the ark if
[57:24] I say come into this building where am I
[57:25] yeah I'm in the building because that
[57:28] was the word made manifested God had
[57:31] provided a way of escape and Noah
[57:33] testified of
[57:36] it
[57:38] and so I've got to Pivot here for a
[57:41] moment Jehovah
[57:44] 1959 Jehovah of Miracles if you want
[57:47] angels to appear to you keep your mind
[57:49] on God and all the things of this world
[57:52] go about your business go to church go
[57:55] do your washing and dishes wherever you
[57:57] are you keep him on your mind all day
[58:01] and all night then God will do something
[58:04] you see you're drawing close to him if
[58:07] you got the world shut out just you and
[58:10] he are together amen oh so simple so
[58:14] simple but do we do it we get distracted
[58:18] I get distracted but I've got a promise
[58:21] in his word that if I'll keep my mind
[58:23] stayed on thee he'll keep me in perfect
[58:25] peace peace and the prophet of God said
[58:28] you want him to draw close to you just
[58:29] keep thinking about him just keep
[58:31] talking about how wonderful he is how
[58:34] sweet he is you ever have that
[58:35] Fellowship we get together sometimes
[58:37] with Brothers you know and sometimes it
[58:39] can go into a conversation where we're
[58:41] maybe uh discussing a doctrinal thing
[58:43] you get argument well you don't feel
[58:44] real sweet when you get to talking about
[58:47] how good he is how good he's been to you
[58:50] you start testifying to another or a
[58:52] sister to a sister how wonderful how
[58:54] precious he is to you you ever noticed
[58:56] sweet atmosphere that begins to get
[58:57] created I've known it I've felt it
[59:01] something begins to happen all around
[59:03] you when you start to talk about how
[59:04] wonderful and how precious he really is
[59:07] he starts drawing close to you now
[59:11] that's simple but let's do it let's keep
[59:14] him on our minds let's not the let the
[59:17] devices and the imaginations of man and
[59:19] all that he can provide through
[59:21] technology take away your mind and
[59:23] grieve the holy spirit away from you
[59:25] let's keep it real simple just keep him
[59:27] on your mind singing praises to God live
[59:29] simple humble Christian lives with him
[59:32] on your mind watch what God will
[59:36] do in a curtain of time 1955 Christians
[59:39] will talk about everything but Christ in
[59:41] these days they go out and they're
[59:44] always in a bunch of nonsense and
[59:45] everything they want to talk about but
[59:48] never but never are they talking about
[59:51] Christ talk about him sing about him
[59:54] love him keep him on your mind
[59:56] and keep him on your heart and your mind
[59:59] all day and all night David said I bind
[1:00:02] thy laws upon the fingers on his fingers
[1:00:05] and upon his bed post and so he would
[1:00:07] before uh he kept him before him all the
[1:00:10] time that's the way keep him in your
[1:00:12] memory keep him in your thoughts and in
[1:00:14] your praises and in your speech all that
[1:00:17] you do is keep Christ before you and
[1:00:19] that's the way that he will draw near to
[1:00:21] you amen I love
[1:00:23] that and so
[1:00:27] I was looking at this Genesis and we'll
[1:00:29] look at it Genesis
[1:00:31] 6:5 I am only halfway through my notes
[1:00:34] so we have a problem
[1:00:37] um I have to find where to cut some of
[1:00:40] this um Genesis 6
[1:00:47] and5 it says God saw that the wickedness
[1:00:51] of man was great in the earth and that
[1:00:54] every imagination
[1:00:56] of the thoughts of his heart was only
[1:00:59] evil continually and it repented the
[1:01:02] Lord that he had made man on the earth
[1:01:05] and it grieved him at his heart I don't
[1:01:08] want to grieve the Lord in his heart I
[1:01:10] don't want my own imaginations in my
[1:01:13] thoughts uh you know when when you look
[1:01:15] at it it wasn't that they were thinking
[1:01:16] bad thoughts cuz I looked this up
[1:01:18] imaginations it's form framing or
[1:01:22] purpose their mind was on their purpose
[1:01:26] you know you can let your
[1:01:28] job become an evil
[1:01:30] thing you can you can let your family
[1:01:34] become an evil thing because your whole
[1:01:36] purpose is just I got to take care of
[1:01:39] the kids I got to do this and what about
[1:01:41] God like what about your serving him
[1:01:44] what you're giving your whole life to
[1:01:46] your purpose of work you're giving your
[1:01:48] whole life to pursuing some goal you're
[1:01:50] giving your whole life to pursue
[1:01:52] something that you want but is it what
[1:01:54] he wants you're imag ination is
[1:01:57] evil if it's not his will it's evil it
[1:02:02] doesn't have to be immoral or Cross or
[1:02:04] it just has to be contrary to his will
[1:02:07] for your life you are evil amen that's
[1:02:11] all it takes amen your purpose isn't to
[1:02:15] do his purpose if your purpose is to do
[1:02:18] your purpose it's evil yes and that's
[1:02:22] the kind of imaginations men had on
[1:02:24] their minds that grieve God to his own
[1:02:27] heart their purpose their imaginations
[1:02:30] their intellectual
[1:02:32] framework was about their own
[1:02:35] will their thoughts the imagination
[1:02:38] their thoughts I thought was interesting
[1:02:39] another word for thought is a device or
[1:02:41] an
[1:02:42] invention and we have many of
[1:02:45] them we have many devices and inventions
[1:02:48] that man has put together to help them
[1:02:51] through this Earthly Journey but I
[1:02:52] promise you it doesn't help you in your
[1:02:55] spiritual one
[1:02:57] anything a man tries to produce uh is
[1:03:00] some benefit and a lot of
[1:03:02] curse a lot of bad maybe a little good
[1:03:05] and mostly bad uh and it's but you see
[1:03:09] the people's minds were all about those
[1:03:11] things yeah right that's where their
[1:03:13] minds were focused on all these things
[1:03:16] what the world could offer Next the
[1:03:18] Great Inventions of technology and
[1:03:20] science and achievement and that's not
[1:03:22] how we are predisposed as Christians
[1:03:25] that's not what we're
[1:03:27] about in Satan's Eden 1965 he said now
[1:03:30] he said he would exalt himself above the
[1:03:32] most high he would Ascend Above the
[1:03:34] Clouds of the stars and he would sit
[1:03:36] there like God and be above the most
[1:03:38] high and he has suce he has succeeded in
[1:03:42] carrying out his threats he has
[1:03:45] certainly had a marvelous success in
[1:03:47] carrying out his threats by the people
[1:03:50] letting him explain away in every age
[1:03:53] the value of God's Pro promised word to
[1:03:56] that age that's exactly how he's done it
[1:04:00] in every age he explained it away he
[1:04:04] makes something else more
[1:04:06] attractive something else look like it's
[1:04:09] more important to you than the promise
[1:04:11] of God's revealed word to you there is
[1:04:14] nothing of more importance to us as
[1:04:16] Believers than this word amen there must
[1:04:19] be nothing in this life that we esteem
[1:04:21] of higher value in our lives than God's
[1:04:24] revealed word for this day you cannot
[1:04:27] take it lightly and we cannot let it
[1:04:29] become common to us if you do you will
[1:04:32] become evil in your own imaginations and
[1:04:35] soon drift away from your own purpose
[1:04:37] that God brought you to this earth amen
[1:04:40] it must stay of extreme high value to us
[1:04:44] I know we hear that all the time but
[1:04:46] it's
[1:04:47] true sometimes we get so used to it it
[1:04:50] becomes common to us and then we can't
[1:04:52] remember the last time we listened to a
[1:04:53] sermon of brother Brandon we can't
[1:04:55] remember the last time we picked up a
[1:04:57] message book prayerfully with a heart's
[1:05:00] desire to hear from God not to do your
[1:05:02] religious Duty for the day and check it
[1:05:04] off I did it God don't care about that
[1:05:07] I'm going to tell you something right
[1:05:08] now don't do that Bible says with man's
[1:05:11] lips they praise me but their hearts are
[1:05:12] far from me don't do it to check it off
[1:05:14] a list it would be better for you to not
[1:05:17] do it than to say I did my religious
[1:05:19] Duty for the day I got it out of the way
[1:05:21] so I can do my will instead of God's
[1:05:24] will you know we're getting down to the
[1:05:28] heart of the matter in many ways our
[1:05:30] hearts objectives attitudes why we do
[1:05:33] what we do is coming into view each and
[1:05:35] every
[1:05:36] day and God knows if this means
[1:05:39] everything to you or if it's just a
[1:05:41] style of your life a
[1:05:43] lifestyle he knows you're not fooling
[1:05:46] nobody it means either everything to you
[1:05:50] or nothing to
[1:05:52] you that's the kind of value God wants
[1:05:54] us to place upon on this revealed word
[1:05:57] it's everything to
[1:06:01] us in these in the days of Noah he
[1:06:04] explained that it was impossible for it
[1:06:06] to rain for rain to for it to rain from
[1:06:09] Heaven There is no rain up there you see
[1:06:12] his great scientific gospel that he had
[1:06:14] preached in the Garden of Eden you see
[1:06:16] he could shoot with instruments to the
[1:06:19] moon and prove that there was no
[1:06:20] moisture up there but God said there
[1:06:23] would come a rain but Satan succeeded
[1:06:27] and poisoned the mind of the People by
[1:06:30] his scientific research that it could
[1:06:33] not be but it was but it was done God
[1:06:37] said it would be done and he did it
[1:06:40] those through scientific uh Technologies
[1:06:42] and reasoning it's poisoning the minds
[1:06:45] of the people in disbelieving God's word
[1:06:49] why do you think you have to be careful
[1:06:50] about sending your boys and your kids
[1:06:52] off to a college what do you think is
[1:06:55] going on there there's higher education
[1:06:59] and a learning and a teaching from
[1:07:01] professors that's causing kids to
[1:07:03] disbelieve the word of God it's
[1:07:05] poisoning their minds to not believe the
[1:07:08] word and now look at the science and
[1:07:10] advancement of science like we can look
[1:07:12] at it and see where this is headed total
[1:07:14] Destruction is what it's headed for it's
[1:07:16] poisoning the minds of people to
[1:07:18] disbelieve God's word absolutely go to
[1:07:21] hear a professor in some colle you
[1:07:23] better prayerfully pray before you let
[1:07:24] your kids go to to a college or a
[1:07:26] university you better know it's the will
[1:07:28] of God cuz you're going to expose them
[1:07:30] to some poison and if they're not ready
[1:07:33] it's bad like you just can't willy-nilly
[1:07:36] run through this
[1:07:38] life amen recognize the devil and his
[1:07:43] tactics it's just an amazing
[1:07:49] thing I better slow down I'm catching my
[1:07:54] breath God but we're
[1:07:57] sheep never supposed to rely on our
[1:08:00] human intellects we're just sheep I was
[1:08:02] going to call this sheep and Shepherds
[1:08:05] we're just sheep I'm so thankful I'm
[1:08:07] just a sheep I'm just a I'm just one
[1:08:10] that needs lead I'm one that needs lead
[1:08:14] every day I can't lead
[1:08:18] myself I need land god hiding himself in
[1:08:22] simplicity so it pleased God to reveal
[1:08:24] himself and hiding himself then hide
[1:08:27] himself and reveal himself in simple
[1:08:29] little things it goes right over the
[1:08:31] head of a man because if you'd say why
[1:08:34] would God do that it's because man was
[1:08:37] made up in the beginning not to shift
[1:08:39] for himself a man was made to completely
[1:08:42] rely upon God that's the reason we're
[1:08:45] likened unto Lambs or sheep because a
[1:08:48] sheep cannot lead himself he has to have
[1:08:52] a leader and the Holy Spirit is supposed
[1:08:55] to lead lead us you believe that I'm not
[1:08:58] leading myself through human intellects
[1:09:01] in many cases there's been a problem I
[1:09:03] say this respect you have to okay when
[1:09:05] brother brandham said take me for what I
[1:09:07] mean not what I say often times you know
[1:09:10] what we do we don't pray about something
[1:09:13] we search it
[1:09:15] out sometimes sometimes we use the
[1:09:19] prophet sometimes we use Google but one
[1:09:22] thing you don't really do anymore is
[1:09:24] pray about it and find the will of God
[1:09:26] for your life sometimes you're
[1:09:28] handicapped by the technology devices
[1:09:31] that we've been given well I did a quick
[1:09:33] search and you know that's I that's what
[1:09:35] he said in 14 different places and it
[1:09:37] was three of those places were 1963
[1:09:39] that's closer in line with what I want
[1:09:41] to do anyhow and so that's what I'm
[1:09:42] going to do but God may tell you no
[1:09:44] you're not allowed to but you don't pray
[1:09:46] about it you don't seek God's face or
[1:09:48] the leadership of the Holy Ghost you're
[1:09:50] a sheep you better go back to
[1:09:52] oldfashioned gospel praying getting on
[1:09:54] your knees and wearing out a pair of
[1:09:56] pants
[1:09:57] sometimes like we didn't advance so much
[1:09:59] that now we have a message church that
[1:10:01] we don't have to
[1:10:02] pray you ain't so intellectually great
[1:10:05] that you can't you can't have to that
[1:10:07] God isn't going to put you on your knees
[1:10:09] in desperation crying out to God for his
[1:10:13] leadership sometimes he will not give
[1:10:15] you an answer you can't find the answer
[1:10:18] in the message you can't find it you
[1:10:20] don't know what to do amen what else you
[1:10:23] going to do amen you got to go pray
[1:10:25] right you got to get serious before God
[1:10:28] seek his face what do I do I don't know
[1:10:31] but that's his promise I'll never leave
[1:10:33] you I'll never forsake you you draw nigh
[1:10:35] to me I'll draw nigh to
[1:10:37] you he wanted
[1:10:40] Fellowship I think that's a great thing
[1:10:42] sometimes when you let you get to a
[1:10:43] Crossroads where you don't know where to
[1:10:45] go it forces you to find him forces you
[1:10:48] to seek his
[1:10:54] face Satan's Eden
[1:10:58] 1965 the spirit of God is not something
[1:11:01] that is schooled into you it is
[1:11:04] something that is predestinated unto you
[1:11:08] by the mighty hand of God your
[1:11:10] experiences cannot be schooled or taught
[1:11:13] it is predestinated by that by God's
[1:11:16] hand and God's forn knowledge into you
[1:11:20] that's right that's what I love there
[1:11:22] was something I was predestinated unto I
[1:11:25] was predestinated there's some you know
[1:11:27] they're guiding cars today by radar or
[1:11:29] whatever technology and stuff like that
[1:11:31] I I heard I was talking to a farmer
[1:11:32] friend of mine he just hops in a combine
[1:11:34] he don't even have to steer it he pushes
[1:11:36] a button and it's Guided by radar he'll
[1:11:39] he'll uh plow a whole field he don't do
[1:11:41] anything but sit there and drink a Coke
[1:11:43] I mean play on his phone that's what he
[1:11:45] does and it and it does the whole bit of
[1:11:47] work it's Guided by something like we're
[1:11:50] living in a day and age where there's a
[1:11:52] higher technology or a higher
[1:11:54] intelligence
[1:11:55] that's now guiding combines and guiding
[1:11:58] cars and all of these things but if
[1:12:00] that's where science has progressed
[1:12:01] there's something else here to guide a
[1:12:03] true Son of God and that's the
[1:12:05] leadership of his spirit to guide me and
[1:12:08] show me what to do each and every day
[1:12:10] okay go this far turn right okay turn
[1:12:11] right okay go that far turn left okay go
[1:12:13] that I believe in that I still believe
[1:12:16] that that's how God leads his people and
[1:12:18] has done it in the past and that's how
[1:12:19] God will always do it never did cause me
[1:12:22] or have to rely upon my own human
[1:12:24] ability to shift for myself and figure
[1:12:26] things
[1:12:27] out I can rely upon God to speak to me
[1:12:31] reveal his word take me to the right
[1:12:33] message at the right time speak through
[1:12:35] a minister speak through a brother or a
[1:12:37] sister in the church have just the right
[1:12:39] word that spark something inside me and
[1:12:41] said that's the
[1:12:42] Lord sometimes God won't speak through
[1:12:44] the ministry he'll speak through one of
[1:12:48] youly God
[1:12:51] failed God likes to do it that way make
[1:12:54] you recognize where he's at am cause you
[1:12:57] to start to respect it honor it love it
[1:12:59] treat it
[1:13:03] sweet when they lusted for knowledge and
[1:13:05] you wanted your PhD and lld it was sin
[1:13:08] to do so that's a strong statement but
[1:13:10] it's the truth no matter how strong it
[1:13:12] is it's the truth you see to lust for
[1:13:15] knowledge and understanding the thing of
[1:13:18] it is today we don't try to establish
[1:13:20] the word of God in the people's hearts
[1:13:22] we're trying to establish ourselves
[1:13:24] churches are are trying to establish a
[1:13:26] doctrine of a church in a person's
[1:13:28] Hearts but we are commanded to establish
[1:13:30] the word of God Paul said I don't come
[1:13:33] to you with enticing words of a man that
[1:13:35] your faith would rest in the knowledge
[1:13:37] of a man but I come to you in power and
[1:13:39] manifestation of the Holy Ghost that
[1:13:40] your faith will rest in God amen
[1:13:44] amen that's what we preach a true and
[1:13:47] living God living amongst his people
[1:13:49] same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:52] whatever he was back then he is today
[1:13:54] what whatever he is today he will
[1:13:56] forever be and my purpose on this Earth
[1:13:59] is to see that word of God not only
[1:14:01] established here but to see it
[1:14:02] established in another person that's my
[1:14:05] objective and that's our purpose in
[1:14:07] coming the Corinthians says knowledge
[1:14:10] puffs up but charity edifieth and if any
[1:14:13] man think that he knoweth
[1:14:15] anything he knoweth nothing yet as he
[1:14:18] ought to know I've always said ain't it
[1:14:21] good to be a bunch of miserable nobody
[1:14:22] nothings that know nothing other than
[1:14:24] God God keeps his promises God keeps his
[1:14:27] word yeah it's good to be that way keeps
[1:14:31] you simple keeps you humble keeps you
[1:14:33] trusting in Him turn your Bibles to
[1:14:35] Romans
[1:14:38] 12 we'll try to speed it up here to wrap
[1:14:41] it up here for a
[1:14:43] moment I just cut a few pages
[1:14:46] out Romans
[1:14:54] 12:14
[1:14:55] and remember we're considering the mind
[1:14:57] of Christ the mind that is to be in us
[1:15:00] the attitude the mental objective that
[1:15:02] we have it says bless them that per
[1:15:05] which persecute you bless and curse not
[1:15:08] rejoice with them that do rejoice and
[1:15:10] weep with them that weep be of the same
[1:15:14] mind one toward another if you see a
[1:15:17] brother or sister that's hurting you
[1:15:19] would be hurting if you love them
[1:15:22] rejoice when someone does really well
[1:15:24] you don't think why' that happen for
[1:15:26] them man I'm way better than that person
[1:15:29] you know I mean wow they got that job
[1:15:33] they don't deserve that job no when
[1:15:35] something good happens we Rejoice we're
[1:15:38] happy for them we want the best for our
[1:15:41] brothers and our sisters and when
[1:15:43] they're in pain we're in pain we don't
[1:15:45] want to see them hurting we don't think
[1:15:47] they deserve that pain they shouldn't
[1:15:49] have done such and such and so and so
[1:15:52] no you hurt we bear one another's
[1:15:56] burdens we're one heart one mind one
[1:16:00] body we're just beating along together
[1:16:02] getting closer I hope all the time
[1:16:08] amen Rejoice with them that do Rejoice
[1:16:11] weep with them that weep be of the same
[1:16:13] mind one toward the other mind not high
[1:16:16] things but condescend to Men of low
[1:16:19] estate be not wise in your own conceits
[1:16:23] conceits don't think too highly of
[1:16:26] yourself everyone put the other one up a
[1:16:28] little higher than yourself and then
[1:16:30] you'll be acting like God that's exactly
[1:16:33] what God done he condescended to the
[1:16:35] lowest lows and he lifted you
[1:16:38] up let's do that for one
[1:16:41] another Psalm
[1:16:43] 62:
[1:16:45] 6 he said he is my rock and my salvation
[1:16:49] he is my defense I shall not be moved in
[1:16:53] God is my salvation and my glory the
[1:16:56] rock of my strength and my refuge is in
[1:17:00] God trust in him at all times ye people
[1:17:04] pour out your hearts before him for God
[1:17:07] is a refuge for us I'm
[1:17:10] fortified behind
[1:17:12] him I'm not fortified in my abilities
[1:17:16] I'm not fortified in what I can figure
[1:17:19] out I'm fortified because I'm just
[1:17:22] simple enough to hide behind The Rock
[1:17:24] amen just get back behind the Rock God
[1:17:28] stay right there don't let anything
[1:17:32] entice you away from the Simplicity that
[1:17:34] is found in Christ Jesus and simple
[1:17:37] humble faith in his promises they will
[1:17:39] never
[1:17:41] fail and that's why it so struck me that
[1:17:44] young man that came to me he just needed
[1:17:46] a place to stand and he needed someone
[1:17:49] to know I was going to pray with him too
[1:17:52] I don't think he had enough confidence
[1:17:54] in his own prayer prayers but for some
[1:17:56] reason when I said I'll be praying for
[1:17:58] you too he lit up wonderful and he said
[1:18:01] I'm I believe that you know sometimes we
[1:18:04] just have to stand with somebody else
[1:18:07] and help them as they stand upon the
[1:18:09] promises of God remind them we have a
[1:18:12] rock we have a place to stand we have a
[1:18:15] a rock in a weary land amen we're
[1:18:18] sheltered by that rock and just remind
[1:18:20] them and stand with them in prayer one
[1:18:23] heart one Accord one objective God will
[1:18:26] see you through amen sometimes we just
[1:18:29] be real simple about it musicians will
[1:18:32] you come praise God Amen I want to close
[1:18:36] with a little bit of a lengthy thing but
[1:18:38] I just love this
[1:18:40] quote
[1:18:42] 1965 0911 God's power to
[1:18:48] transform he said I got out there
[1:18:50] brother brandom and there was no bark on
[1:18:52] the trees there wasn't a spring of grass
[1:18:56] it was on Easter morning he said there
[1:18:58] was some old wrecked tanks out there and
[1:19:01] the officer uh had to get a record of
[1:19:04] them and see if there was anything that
[1:19:06] could be done for them near the great uh
[1:19:09] argon Forest said then when I was
[1:19:12] standing there by myself said I looked
[1:19:14] up and said oh God this is the way it's
[1:19:17] all coming to that's right it's all
[1:19:20] coming it was all burnt up there was no
[1:19:23] life at all the grass was burned up the
[1:19:26] trees the grass the all the trees were
[1:19:28] killed everything was dead Twisted
[1:19:31] hanging down where bullets and things
[1:19:33] had riddled it all if that isn't a
[1:19:35] picture of the world today where Satan
[1:19:38] is spraying his unbelief his
[1:19:40] hybridization His science and his
[1:19:43] knowledge until that it is be until it
[1:19:46] was at the beginning when God put Adam
[1:19:48] and Eve in the garden what a beautiful
[1:19:51] paradise without death and without
[1:19:53] sickness and without without sorrow and
[1:19:56] everything was in order look what
[1:19:58] Satan's DDT has done now she is chaos
[1:20:02] and there's nothing left he said I
[1:20:04] started to cry as I walked back I was
[1:20:07] attracted to a rock said I went over
[1:20:10] there and I looked at that rock and I
[1:20:13] pushed it over down beneath the rock was
[1:20:16] a little white flower growing the only
[1:20:19] thing left because it was sheltered by a
[1:20:23] rock amen God my rock My Shelter to us
[1:20:28] today oh God when these poisons are
[1:20:31] flying everywhere in the s name of
[1:20:34] Science and in education shelter us keep
[1:20:37] me until that day oh God is my
[1:20:41] prayer amen amen how many want to be
[1:20:44] sheltered by The Rock in this dark and
[1:20:47] dreary age it's advancing and heading
[1:20:50] towards destruction faster than anything
[1:20:52] I know with poisonous gases of unbelief
[1:20:55] all around us Lord just shelter me
[1:20:57] behind that rock will you stand I pray
[1:21:00] that that was okay it was just as I felt
[1:21:03] led to say it I can only do what I feel
[1:21:06] inspired to say and do and I I just
[1:21:10] believe that it was his leading and I
[1:21:12] hope that it was an encouragement to you
[1:21:14] and I hope that God spoke to each he
[1:21:17] speaks to all of our hearts just the
[1:21:18] things that he has need of let's just
[1:21:21] bow our
[1:21:23] heads
[1:21:26] heavenly

[1:21:31] for your promises that you'd never leave
[1:21:33] us nor forsake us father thank you Lord

[1:21:39] revealing to us the high calling that is

[1:21:50] thou H has called us to rule and reign
[1:21:52] with thee and father what man are of men
[1:21:55] ought we to be father I just pray that
[1:21:58] you'd help each and every one of us Lord
[1:22:01] where we have turned sometimes to the
[1:22:03] right to the left we've leaned to our
[1:22:05] own understanding or we've looked
[1:22:07] outside of your word for a solution to
[1:22:10] problems I pray Lord God that you'd
[1:22:12] forgive us for that unbelief Lord may we
[1:22:15] always find our shelter our comfort our
[1:22:17] protection our strength in your word
[1:22:21] Lord let us not turn to the right or to
[1:22:23] the left may we always always just be
[1:22:25] simple humble believing that the one who
[1:22:28] makes the promise keeps the promises
[1:22:31] father I pray Lord that you would help
[1:22:33] us Lord to just be more like you in
[1:22:36] simple things help us to be more pitiful
[1:22:40] help us to be more kind help us to be
[1:22:42] more gentle one with the other when one
[1:22:45] is hurting let us hurt with one's
[1:22:47] rejoicing let us rejoice father may we
[1:22:50] realize just how important to be of one
[1:22:53] heart and one mind it really is Father
[1:22:56] Lord if there's issues amongst us father
[1:23:00] may we find something common like a
[1:23:02] little shoe something that we love like
[1:23:05] a mother and father that lost a little
