========================================

it's good to be together this evening good to see you all let's take our bibles and turn to the book of revelation chapter 19. we're going to continue on with where we were on sunday we didn't get a chance to finish and so we're back today and we're going to keep going down the same path we've been going lord's been really good to us so we thank him for that and let's read revelation 19 verse 11. and i saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he that judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name was called the word of god and the armies were trent which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god he had on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords let's turn over to chapter 17 and read verse 14 before we pray revelation 17 and 14 these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this wonderful wonderful time lord as we come together to worship your name to sing your praises lord we

bind it now and lord that your holy ghost would have free reign we give you ourselves in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated before we get into that i just wanted to say thank you for sunday there was a dinner afterwards and there was a pastor of appreciation and angie and i would just like to say thank you we appreciate you all so much and we were surprised and overwhelmed and a little uncomfortable and it's always a little challenging but one thing i appreciate is your respect for god's gifts and i pray that god will always honor you for that amen i think it's a good thing and i was a little uncomfortable and wishing that we hadn't done that and all of those things until i opened the gift and then when i saw that page out of the original edition of the 1611 king james bible i wasn't embarrassed anymore and i wasn't wishing we hadn't done it i was totally excited that was we really appreciate that everybody who contributed that means a lot that that one page out of that bible and it was joshua chapter one that is a dear treasure to me and i always treasure it as long as i'm on this earth so thank you so much we appreciate that i also want to remind you that brother craig is going down to preach for brother steve hamilton they're having their 14th anniversary meetings this coming saturday and sunday so i would encourage all of you who live down south and can get there easy for the saturday night service i know it'd be an encouragement to the assembly there they would appreciate that and i'm sure brother craig would appreciate that i think it'd be nice if we could show our support for that so if you're able to go down there he'll be there saturday and sunday if you need the address for the church you can call the office tomorrow friday we've got the address for the church there also remember the brothers leaving for haiti they're leaving this saturday brother elmer mother brian brother manuel and brother kyle we'll be leaving so we want to keep them in prayer there's a lot going on we're excited to hear the reports when they get back of what all god's doing and i'd like to have the brothers come up at the end of service so the ministry can lay hands on them and as a congregation we can send them off with prayer trusting that god will do supernatural things for them i also wanted to remind everybody at the youth meeting this friday night at paul and jenny priest there's going to be a bonfire and it's going to be a good time and brother jonathan martin will be preaching for the young people and it'll be a joint effort of the other assembly so hope that you all can make it there that'll be very very exciting can we bring up that powerpoint now i want to continue on and i want to look at two armies as we as we look at the book of revelation and we see that that in revelation 19 we see christ coming riding on a white horse and the armies of heaven are following after him riding on white horses so we just want to take a look at that that army that's following after him today briefly we know that we're looking from we're looking from perspective of an open book not a closed book but an open book and that changes everything i remember as being a little boy i was always attracted to the book of revelation and now i find it comical because i had no explanation for why a little boy 11 10 11 12 13 years old would read the book of revelation by the time i was 15 or 16 i think i had read the entire book of revelation through three or four times now why would a little boy do that you know but now i know why you know god always he if you just hang on god will show you many many times the mysteries of your life but to me it was always a closed book all i saw was dragons and multiple head beasts and horses of different colors and and all of these things and and i'm sure as a boy it was fascinating swords coming out of mouths and wings on creatures and it really didn't mean anything to me but but as gone you know brought a prophet on the scene to unveil these things and the seals became open now we're reading out of an open book and now it's not a fantasy it's not a fairy tale it's not a coloring page book this is reality to us and we're seeing it with open eyes looking at an open book and we thank god for them so much of the bible for so many people is a fairy tale amen it's just stories a collection of stories and they're cute and they're whimsical and and they just talk about a god who loves everybody and they don't even they don't even understand that there's more to the story but we thank god that he's been merciful to us amen you know i was witnessing to a man the other day last week and i had just a few minutes to talk to him and he made a joke and it wasn't at all an off-color joke but in the joke he he mentioned eating the apple and the we all have fallen in sin and come short of the glory of god and so that was my open door and so i went and for 15 minutes i just laid out serpent seed and i asked him i said man i've always wondered what kind of fruit could somebody eat and their eyes would be open and they would realize they're naked and then they'd make an apron and not put it over their mouth where they just sinned with but they would make aprons for their bodies and so i went through all of these questions why virgin birth and the man's like yeah why yeah why so i just went to the punch line i said you know adultery is the only thing that works that answers all these questions and the guy looked at me goes where do you go to church but i gave him a card and told him invited him to watch and i said really our joy is seeing the bible come alive and realizing that this isn't a picture book that we give to kids this isn't just little little stories about a noah and a boat and abraham and sarah but this is a reality to us and there's something god's trying to tell us and we desperately want to know it and so to me it was just exciting just to be able to have that interaction because god has opened our eyes so that's what we're reading from an open book went through this quote on sunday but i want to rehearse it again because it's a principle that we must understand or many of the things brother benham teaches are not going to make any sense to us if we don't see this principle in the scriptures in this message brother branham said during this time of joel's prophecy here the church was in a terrible condition so he's talking about something that's happening in the days that joel is alive and he said it's a terrible condition backslid just prior to the coming of the lord the first time see and how that the spirit come upon this prophet and he foresaw things and he saw the condition of the jews and he saw the condition of the church in this day so at the same time when joel is looking at these things he is seeing something that's happening in his day in a reality in his day he's also seeing the condition of the jews at the time jesus would come and he's seeing the condition of the church today and and joel doesn't tell you that when he writes out the bible amen because because god was laying it in there so that a prophet could come down and pull it out and show us and and we know that joel the prophecy that joel gave came to pass in the day that joel was alive and shortly after there was a the syrians came down and they ravished the land and they they ate it all down and then there was a restoration back but then we know that the same thing happened in the in the days of jesus the jewish church had gotten whittled down and destroyed and then it came back because peter said this is the prophecy this is what's happening what what the prophet joel has said but then brother branham could pick it up and say it's for our day so now we have to realize when we read prophecy we cannot pigeonhole it just here and say it will not fit anywhere else because if you do that you'll miss many things that the prophet is telling us this is why the message is broken into so many camps right this is why we're already in the wedding supper or the wedding supper's uh coming right or we've already married no we don't get married to the meeting in the air and the answer to the question is that they're both true brother venom said we don't we don't go to the wedding we're married here right and he said that in 1964 and proving his word but after that he says we go to the wedding the meeting in the air because there's a spiritual union an invisible union and there's a visible union right there's one that takes place now in your soul where you're united with christ so the baptism of the holy ghost but there's one that'll come when your physical body meets his physical body in the air and so we have to realize that these same prophecies and these statements that the prophet's making many times they're spiritual and natural if not we'll divide in two different camps and throw bombs at each other and hate one another when we're both got a portion of truth right so we've got to be very very careful how we handle the word and just listen to what the prophet said and just believe what he said it may twist you all up in knots for a while but eventually god will settle it all out and show you how it all fits just don't change what he said just take what he said and wait for god to make it fit into place don't take hammers and drive it drive those puzzle pieces down from the work don't take your scissors out and trim a little bit you just leave it alone until it fits because when it fits it's beautiful so now we see that there's been two vines and these two vines started in heaven when there was rebellion in heaven when lucifer rebelled and him and michael had a great war and we followed those vines all the way through and this quote we read before but i just want to rehearse a couple of these things said that great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles so now they're not angelic battles anymore so this battle that started in heaven we must understand this is not an angelic battle anymore it's a human battle and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself satan came to destroy this that's what this purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since so this battle that started in heaven where is that battle taking place right now it's taking place right here so the battle between lucifer and michael the battle for lucifer to overcome god's word by deception that battle is raging right here every day right here do you know where the battle is the battle's here when you look in the mirror now you're looking at the battlefield the battle place the place of battle and brother bam talked about this and greatest battle ever fought he said these two great armies had to find a place with a common ground where they would come and battle it out and they chose the mind of man it was the battlefield so we see that it's true the battle is going on in us see you see how if you don't realize this how we're going to be walking in the traps all the time and falling down and stumbling because we have no idea where the battle is the battle's over here it's over there it's in this group and it's just church or in that family and we don't realize the battle that took place in heaven now is taking place in me then i'm going to be totally deceived to what the devil's doing and i'm going to be just following the pied piper all the way into all kinds of trouble but we have to realize the problem the battle is right here that's why we have to feed on the word we have to stay in prayer there are no options we can't take days off from being a christian we can't go on vacation from feeding on the word and laying before the presence of the lord and asking for the spirit to direct our lives because the battle never stops so we can't say i'm tired i'm going to take a day off i'm not praying today i'm not reading my bible today i'm not listening to the word today just as soon as you do that the battle has never stopped you just stop gaining ground so there's no days off the devil doesn't take a day off we don't take a day off if you ever notice when you go on vacation you get out of your routine and you stop your prayer life and you stop your devotional time that by the time you get back you're starting to dry up and you've had a good time and you saw some beautiful sights and you had some time from family but spiritually you're drying up when you get back now i don't think vacation has to be that way i think you can go on vacation and see some beautiful sights spend some time from family and refresh your soul with the word of god daily man we've got to be careful there's no days off no vacation from being a son of god amen the seventh series says there's an old battle that started way back beyond time and satan and his angels was kicked out and when they come to earth and the battle set in again because eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of god and from that very hour satan won the battle over god's word because one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar it doesn't take ten it doesn't take fifty it doesn't take a hundred it takes one and if one subject lets down the bar on the word then satan has victory over the word that's why god has restored his word amen excuse me and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has become been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word now now if you notice in these quotes i'm going to be bouncing quite a bit today between the fourth seal and the feast of trumpets and they run very much parallel the fourth seal and the feast of trumpets and we'll have a few other quotes mingled in there but but it's very important that we realize that now look what this is all coming to we're in the fourth seal we've come all the way through the church ages we're to the fourth seal and brother bam saying what is all this coming to it's going right back the way it did it started in heaven it's coming to the end time battle the first thing in heaven was a battle lucifer was kicked out and come to earth and he polluted eden then he's been polluting ever since but now from the battle in heaven it's come to the battle on earth and it's to be finished on earth at the time in a battle called armageddon now anyone knows that the battle started in heaven and so they kicked them out michael and his angels overthrew them just run out and when they did dropped right down into eden and here started the battle down here so we've seen the battle plan we've seen what lucifer has done to deceive the church through the church ages and we've modeled that and what happens in our lives we can look and see what happened in the church ages and now we understand every one of our backslidings in every one of our falls because it always follows the same pattern but god has given a way of escape but now we're looking just at this last portion here the eagle battling out death the pale horse in the fourth seal he says here we see life and death coming to the final struggle the white horse of true life the pale horse of mixed creed you see the thing coming to a real showdown this battle is going to be finished up under the fourth seal amen and it's coming to a real showdown and the feast of trumpets says they wasn't natural horses now i want to back up i don't want to jump there yet let's let's take our bibles and i want to read in the book of revelation for just a little bit now uh let's go to uh 16 revelation chapter 16 and i want you to hang tight with me as we take a little look in our bibles at a few things now one thing i want to remind you of as we were talking on sunday that brother branham showed us a pattern in the seals when he said that every church age messenger came when they came a seal was broken they got a revelation from god and they sounded the trumpet and the trumpet declared spiritual war and a spiritual war broke out and after that the elect were sealed away in that age and then a plague fell out right so he's showing seals trumpets plagues and he shows it in every church age and it comes all the way down through and and there was a there was a seal a trumpet and a plague in every one of the church ages but when we get to the seventh church age now when there's a there's a seal broken at the end the seven seals are broken at the end of the laodicean church age and now all the gospel trumpet sounds in the full measure of the word the full opening of the seals the full revelation of jesus christ declaring not just to a little church age battle but now the full word brings back the full battle we got that so we're coming back to the end time battle but we can't because through the church age we're only battling out on a seal a revelation a portion of the word battling out on a portion of the word but now we're here we've come to face off with the full word with a full gospel trump at the full gospel of jesus christ bringing to the full full spiritual battle but we've been a quick equipped to overcome so i want to look i want i want to show a pattern and this pattern is really important we discussed it briefly sunday but if you look at chapter 16 chapter 16 is going to go through the vials and out of the vials the plagues are poured out and in chapter 16 you have the first vial of chapter verse two the first vial chapter three the second four through sevens the third all the way down till you get to verse 12 and chapter 16 and that's the sixth vial so we'll read that together and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared now there is a gap between the sixth vial and the seventh vial and what i'm going to show you is there's a gap between the sixth seal and the seventh seal there's a gap between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet and there's a gap between the sixth vial and the seventh vial and we're living in the gap now we can place ourselves right in the book of revelation because we're living in the gap now remember this is spiritual and natural it happens spiritually and there's it's going to happen naturally verse 13 and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for thee they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of the great day of god almighty behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and that keepeth his garment lest he walketh naked and they see his shame and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon verse 17 and the seventh angel poured out his violent into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done the seventh is always finishing up whether it's the seventh seal or the seventh trumpet or the seventh vial that's always the finishing that's why it says here it is done so we're going to see that but we see between the sixth vial and the seventh file we have injected here in this gap and in this gap is a revelation or or a declaration of the three unclean spirits coming out of the frogs and brother branham starts to reveal to us and exposes the trinity doctrine for what it is and he begins to show these three unclean spirits coming out of this and he begins to show us the trinity of the dragon and the beast and the false prophet so in this gap who is it that reveals what this means what this is it's the it's the seventh church age messenger it's the prophet to the gentiles so in the gap he reveals spiritually what this is all right so in the gap you have a seventh church age messenger the prophet of malachi 4 the prophet of revelations 10 7 and he's explaining to you what those three unclean spirits are and he's explaining to you the trinity of the of the dragon the beast and the false prophet so see how important the gap is let's go back to revelation uh 9. revelation chapter 9. so i'm doing this backwards for a reason revelation 8 starts the trumpets they go up to the fourth trumpet revelation chapter 9 starts the fifth trumpet so now we're in the trumpets and verse 13 and chapter 9 starts the sixth trumpet so we'll read that together and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden art altar which is before god saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates and the four angels were loose which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them and thus i saw the horses in the vision and then that sat on them had breastplates of fire and adjacent and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouth issued fire smoke and brimstone now you notice every time you're dealing with a demon spirit there's always three things coming out of his mouth and those three things are always destroying people because they're always promoting a trinity doctrine so there's always always three coming out of the mouth or there's three frogs with something coming out of their mouth it's always this trinity doctrine because he destroys the elect gentile with words deception he destroys the jews physically we got that but he can't destroy he can't he can't root out all the seed of god by removing one family like he can the jews he the way he gets to the gentiles is through spiritual deception he brings spiritual death because he cannot find the seed they're dispersed through the entire gentile all the nations when he wants to take out the the line in israel he can destroy just israel all right physically but spiritually he has to destroy the the gentiles spiritually so you always see this coming out of the mouth three things fire and smoke and brimstone verse 18 by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like in the serpents in the heads and with them they do hurt and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of their works in their hands that they should not worship the devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk neither repented they of their murders nor their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts so now we have an order we have one two three four five six trumpets but now we're coming to a gap you don't go to the seventh trumpet you come to revelations chapter 10 which is the mighty angel coming down and the seventh church age messenger then after that you go to revelation chapter 11 which are my two witnesses that are called the two witnesses come and preach so in the gap you have three prophets that show up you have a prophet to the gentiles and two prophets to the jews show up in the gap between the sixth and seventh then they preach then they call down plagues then they are killed and then after they're killed verse 15 of chapter 11 says in the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdom of this world are become the kingdom of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign forever and ever do you see the gap you go to chapter 6 chapter 6 or revelation chapter 9 the sixth trumpet then you come before you get to the seventh you come to the prophet to the gentiles you come to the two witnesses to the jews and then you come back to the seventh and what is the seventh seventh is the finishing again now all the kingdoms have become the kingdoms of our god and is christ so the seventh is always bringing out the finishing right but there's a gap let's go back a little further revelation chapter 6. revelation chapter 6 verse 1 starts with the first seal goes all the way down to the sixth seal and it starts at verse 12. and we'll read that and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black a sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell onto the earth even as fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free men hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand it so that finishes the sixth seal so you expect the next verse to go to the seventh but it doesn't there's a gap and in the gap is revelation chapter seven and in revelation chapter seven there's the calling out of the hundred and forty four thousand who calls out the hundred forty four thousand the two prophets is moses and elijah the two witnesses so here we have in the gap prophets show up again always in the gap prophets show up you have prophets in the gap prophet to the gentiles two prophets to the jews and they always come in the gap that's why the sixth seal had to crack open in world war ii and brother branham said the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal sound at the same time and the sixth trumpet is the second woe which is world war ii so at world war ii the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal sound at the same time because it had to or else our prophet was born out of season because he's got to come in the gap between the sixth and seventh seal praise god who makes this stuff up how can you make a life match the scriptures how can you make a man's life actually match the construction of the bible verse by verse chapter by chapter this isn't pretend made up god took his hand and he made everything work out just right so that would all come to pass the first world war one takes place when brother branham's a little boy then he moves and and he sees world war ii and now he says the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal sound at the same time world war ii but then something has to happen because we know much of what happens in the sixth trump and sixth seal is yet to come so now we look at seven chapter seven verse one and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor in any tree and i saw another angel ascend from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god and their foreheads so now these four angels which we saw in the six trumpets four angels bound in euphrates now these four angels now that now uh the sixth seal cracks open world war two starts tribulation persecution of the jews begins and now all of a sudden there's a a ceiling angel that comes and says don't hurt the earth stop hold it back until there's a period of time until the 144 000 are sealed so in the gap we have sealing who does the ceiling the prophets preach the word they receive the atonement the true atonement the word and they're sealed into the kingdom of god so now you see what has happened in our history how the the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal have sounded but they're held back until the hundred and forty four thousand are sealed after they're sealed that's why those two prophets can call for plagues anytime they want stop the rain call for fire to come down call for earthquakes everything that you find in the sixth seal they're able to do it why because the ceiling's done and now the the four angels are not holding the winds anymore now they're unleashed all this happened in the prophet's lifetime to me that is astounding and it's right there for anybody who wants to look at it praise god i showed you that because i wanted you to see the spiritual and the natural because brother branham says he tells us that the the sixth seal will open up and that those two prophets will open the sixth seal which is absolutely the truth but he told us the sixth seal sounds at the same time as the sixth trumpet and the sixth trumpet is the second world war ii how can both of these things be true unless it opened up and was told to hold back until they're sealed and then the two prophets call for and open up the sixth seal amen praise the lord it's so good it's exciting now let's keep going feast of trumpets he said they wasn't natural horses they breathed fire he's reading right out of the sixth trumpet they had breastplates of jasper and they had tails and the end of the tail looked like serpents and snakes had on the end of it stinging it was spiritual horses spiritual devils chargers that had been bound on euphrates all these years supernatural devils what was it the old roman empire being revived the persecution of the jews they had been bound for nearly two thousand years at the river euphrates can't cross to the promise a religious sect that was trying to get to the other side euphrates you know come through eden but they were bound there two hundred thousand devils of persecution and notice what happens under the sixth trumpet they were turned loose on the jews the persecution of the jews supernatural devils nearly 2 000 years then loosed by stalin and hitler upon the jews you see well that is you say well that isn't roman it's the same spirit they've done the same things that they did to christians in the old pagan roman days now watch the natural israel and the spiritual church now as we separate it here so brother rim's going to make a separation between the natural persecution of the jews and something that's happening to the church feast of trumpets he said there is a roman empire bound there by what the ecclesiastical powers amen he's speaking of euphrates the ecclesiastical powers now he's explaining something spiritual out of the sixth trumpet which roman pagan rome became papal roman was bound there in its traditions of christian because it took the christian traditions it couldn't act like the old pagan rome anymore now it's got to pretend it's christian and so it's bound by the ecclesiastical boundaries because it has to act like it's christian and so it's bound under its traditions of christians it can't just go do like it did as the roman empire what part of christian and superstition it had a room putting together all these worship of women these other kind of stuff and christmas days and holidays and holy days and things it's been bound with that tradition that it cannot let loose because it's against christian principles so there has to come a time when it can let loose but it can only let loose when the ecclesiastical boundary is removed and the ecclesiastical boundary is when because of their tradition of christianity they can't act the way they want they have to reserve themselves until they can remove the ecclesiastical boundary by so watering down christianity that they can now act in an unchristian way and be christian and that's the day we live in you can live any way you want and be a christian you say i love jesus and jesus loves me and you can you can do drugs and you can run around your wife you can be married and you're going to be divorced and you can still be a christian and now everything is changing the ecclesiastical boundaries are moving away hallelujah still the same ungodly pagan spirit and that spirit caught into the nations of the world according to the prophecies of ezekiel and the rest of them and they were loosed upon the jew who know nothing of the spirit so now brother bran is going to start talking about what happened to the persecution of the jews under the sixth trumpet and he's going to show now what happened in the ecclesiastical realms so brother vanessa starts talking about he says now now this is loosed in the ecclesiastical world and we know in vatican 2 brother brahm talks about it it's the catholics ecumenical move when they decided to drop the boundaries invite all their protestant brothers and sisters to come back and be unified with them in brotherly love they had excommunicated the patriarch of the the of the of the greek church which caused the split between eastern and western catholicism and so now they bring the orthodox patriarch back and and pope paul vi gives him papers exonerating him from excommunication never taking care of the reason why he was excommunicated never addressing that what are they doing the ecclesiastical boundaries are dropping now everything goes even to the catholics here's what the prophet says he says notice the loosing of this ecclesiastical spirit now 20 years later after that war we see the loosing of the ecclesiastical spirit what happened 20 years later the war ended in 1945 1945 there was between 1939 and 1949 or 1945 there was a persecution against a jews a holocaust in a world war and all kinds of atrocities and persecution six million jews were killed because they were jews it was a physical natural persecution amen but then after the war now the ecclesiastical spirit opens and brother branham said 20 years after the war the ecclesiastical realm opens and this and this uh vatican ii council ended december 1965. amen world war ii ended september 1945 two years later now we have vatican ii council and now the ecclesiastical spirit has opened up what's it doing bringing a persecution against the true church working out the ecclesiastical boundaries drying up euphrates so they can come across feast of trump as he said now notice we find now that the natural power under the natural to a natural nation israel was loosed there and what did it it went and made war and how it murdered and persecuted now in the ecclesiastical realm of it i hope that god opens your eyes to this now because i realize this is just not speaking to this church here this tape goes worldwide and i don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings but just tell the truth now the ecclesiastical realm has been opened from the natural revival the old pagan rome went forth on those jews which has always been their enemy the lion with the teeth and everything that stomped down and broke out people rome always had been god's enemy and it was turned loose in the same spirit by the dictators of the world because the religious system was still holding now it's been loosed so now when under the sixth trumpet these demons come out but because the ecclesiastical the religious system was still holding they went for a natural persecution of the jews but then that war stopped and 20 years later now the ecclesiastical realms has opened up see the natural and the spiritual those are two hundred thousand thousand demons to do what to stop you from manifesting the word amen but they're not going to stop you friends because they can't go beyond the boundary of the word we're safe in the stronghold of god's word amen praise god the first seal now on this mixed-colored worldly pale sick horse just think of it you know that's a bad thing now watch where he gathers them from the four corners of the earth they are gathering now for the showdown now i want you to catch this they're gathering now for the showdown the showdown will be at armageddon according to the word so the gathering is not a physical people moving to a physical location they're gathering in the ecumenical move spiritually coming together in mind and in heart and indeed and they're coming together for the showdown not coming together as an army to march up against jerusalem but coming together to march against spiritual jerusalem you got that there will be a gathering together to march against jerusalem absolutely but right now we're working in the ecclesiastical realms where these two hundred thousand thousand demons have gone to deceive in the churches and the protestant movements amen in the ecclesiastical realms and they're gathering now for the showdown they're gathering now for uh for armageddon and they're not gathering to a physical location to a physical jerusalem but it's a spiritual gathering to a spiritual jerusalem and who is the spiritual jerusalem the bride of jesus christ hallelujah they're gathering now for the showdown the showdown will be at armageddon according to the word on the pale horse riding it with a death tact with the name tact on him death listen antichrist's first denomination that can't be the spirit with his jezebel a prostitute to the word with her daughters with her protestants gathering themselves together now in eunuch amen so now what is this gathering for the showdown it's a gathering of the protestants and the catholics the jezebel and her daughters gathering together that's the gathering for the showdown that's the gathering for armageddon hallelujah but god's gathering the different kind of gathering now i want you to be patient with me i want to show a couple video clips in both of these clips we've shown before so be patient but i watched this one again and it just floored me all over again and this is when tony palmer goes and speaks to the evangelical charismatics at kenneth copeland's church and i want you to watch and i want you to listen carefully to the deception in the man's voice how he misquotes the scriptures how he misuses the word amen and how he is very charismatic and very likable and trying to do what intellectually seems like a good thing and brother branham said this this unification this ecumenical move he said it makes sense to the intellectual mind actually he said it's the right thing to do intellectually it's the right thing to do intellectually but he said it's wrong according to the word amen and so you can see how if you didn't know this word and you listened to this man you could get sucked right into this nonsense and think it's a good thing easily so we're going to go ahead and play that clip it's 11 minutes so brother franco if you go ahead and start that and i need you to at least understand a little bit of the the history behind this because we are living in an incredibly important generation i believe that god has brought me here to this year's ministers conference in the spirit of elijah let me explain if you look carefully the spirit of elijah was on john the baptist to turn the hearts of the sons to the fathers and to turn the hearts of the fathers to the sons to prepare the way for the lord and we know that prophecy always has a double fulfillment and we know that elijah will come before the second coming as well and i've understood that the spirit of elijah is the spirit of reconciliation to return heart to each other this is very important we know that the first thousand years there was one church it was called the catholic church and the word catholic means universal it doesn't mean roman catholic means if you're born again raise your hand if you're born again you're a catholic take back redeem what belongs to you we are catholics and then there was the split at the end of the first millennium we had the orthodox east and west two churches then 500 years later we have luther in his protest three churches in 1500 years three denominations not three churches and then from luther's protest onwards 33 000 new denominations i've come to understand that diversity is divine it's division that's diabolic it's true what you were saying about the glory i agree with you of course it's true the glory that the father had he gave to jesus the glory was the presence of god what is the charismatic renewal it's when we experience the presence of god and he said and i give them the glory pragmatic reason so that they may be one it's the glory that glues us together not the doctrines it's the glory if you accept that christ is living in me and the presence of god is in me and the presence of god is in you that's all we need because god will sort out all our doctrines when we get upstairs therefore christian unity is the basis of our credibility because jesus said until day one they will not believe the world will not believe as they should until we are one division destroys our credibility it is fear that keeps us separated because fear is false evidence appearing real it's an acronym f-e-a-r false evidence appearing real because most of your fear is based on propaganda now why is it historic because in 1999 the roman catholic church and the protestant lutheran church signed an agreement that brought an end to the protest luther believed that we were saved by grace through faith alone amen but that's not it the catholic church believed that we were saved by works and that was the protest in 1999 they wrote this together because in the protestant church we had a lot of cheap salvations people were getting born again but no fruit whatsoever and because we didn't even look for fruit it wasn't the issue because it wasn't necessary for salvation and no it's not but it's a good judge if you are saved so what these two churches did they put the two definitions together listen to it i'm reading verbatim from the catholic vatican website justification means that christ himself is our righteousness in which we share through the holy spirit in accord with the will of the father to together we catholics and protestants lutherans believe and confess that by grace alone in faith in christ's saving works and not because of any merit on our part we are accepted by god and receive the holy spirit who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works this brought an end to the protest of luther brothers and sisters luther's protest is over is yours in 1999 this was signed by the lutheran church the federation worldwide later about five years later the worldwide methodists signed the same agreement but as of today we still have had no protestant evangelical that will stand up and sign this agreement to agree with our brothers and sisters that we are saved by grace through faith to good works and i believe that's something that needs to be fixed there's a challenge for you so the protest has been over for 15 years and i get a bit cheeky here because i challenge my protestant pastor friends if there is no more protest how can there be a protestant church maybe now we're all catholics again but we are reformed we are catholic in the universal sense we are not protesting the doctrine of salvation by the catholic church anymore we now preach the same gospel we now preach you are saved by grace through faith alone the word alone was the argument for 500 years the word alone is there you can read it yourself the protest is over the protest is over so let me pray and then we'll start the video i believe we will begin to see more and more people called out to go into the world and work among the churches in the spirit of elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers to make ready a people prepared for the lord ministries of reconciliation we need to throw as much resources and energy into the ministry of reconciliation as we do to the ministry of evangelization or are we building walls without foundations i challenge you to find a bridge builder and back him or her and i'd like to pray this prayer and if you agree you can say amen this was a dying man's prayer and when you know you're about to die you certainly prayed the most important prayers he said i do not pray for these alone but also for those who will believe in me through their word that they all may be one as you father are in me and i in you that they may also be one in us so that the world may believe that you sent me and the glory which you have given me i have given them that they may be one as we are one glory to the father amen i want you to video a message back come up here and let's do it this way so he can see this this whole congregation so i've got to go to the vatican again [Laughter] my dear sir my dear sir thank you so from the bottom of our hearts all of these leaders represent literally tens of thousands of people that love you that believe god with you and in answer to your request we have just prayed for you and with you and we did so in the spirit and we believe we receive according to the words of jesus in mark 11 24. whatsoever thing you desire when you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them our desire sir along with you is in the fourth chapter of the book of ephesians till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a mature man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ thank you sir we do bless you we receive your blessing it's very very important to us and we bless you with all of our hearts we bless you with all of our souls we bless you with all of our might and we thank you sir we thank god for you and so all of us declare together be blessed once again all together be blessed amen amen a man a man a man a man hallelujah i'm available praise god god's will be done amen tony thank you sir my hair you bless this place tonight [Music] thank you amen i told you he'd never forget it [Applause] yeah whoa i tell you i'm telling you right now heaven is thrilled over this thank you lord hallelujah you know you know what you know what's so thrilling to me i mean when we went into the ministry 47 years ago this was impossible people people people would read that scripture and say yeah right until we all come together and unite our faith and we ain't no way that's ever going to happen that's hard to watch you see the deception so easily because we have an open book but if we didn't have an open book you see how nice and logical and intellectual that sounds it sounds like the right thing to do but they took the scripture and they twisted all of the scriptures to mean something different than what was wrote and i could go line by line we don't have time for that because the thing infuriates me when i watch that i yell back at the i yell back at the monitor the whole time and say that's a lie that's not true and that's not what the word says but it's because we have an open book friends and i showed that to show that the ecclesiastical boundaries are removed because now he comes to the evangelicals which are supposed to be bible-believing fundamental believing people and he comes to them and and now kenneth copeland says 47 years ago this wasn't possible absolutely because for 47 years they've been working down the ecclesiastical boundaries so that now there's no difference between the catholic faith and the evangelical faith that's basically what they said you don't have to worry about the doctrine as long as you believe jesus is in you and jesus and me god will sort out the doctrines when we get upstairs then what is the bible written for amen but you see how what brother benham told us at the vatican ii council he said 20 years after that war he said now it's loose in the ecclesiastical realm and here we're watching this 50 years after brother brenham said that 50 years later and you look at just how much it's loosed in the ecclesiastical realms it's stunning it's shocking but friends were here we're here what are they gathering for what is the 1999 uh uh uh accord agreement with the lutherans worldwide what is the 2004 agreement worldwide with the methodist what is this unification with the with the evangelicals through ken clopin back to the catholic church what is it gathering for the showdown because the showdown is always over the word of god hallelujah hallelujah don't tell me he'll sort out the doctrines when we get upstairs he already sent a prophet to sort out the doctrines down here hallelujah hallelujah because the doctrines are the teachings the teachings of what the teachings of jesus christ because he is the word of god thank god let's just go just a little bit further now the battle started in heaven it'll be finished on the earth in the form of armageddon now let's watch and see it unfold maybe we can unfold it if the lord help us right now to do this watch it unfold the mystery writer watch what he does now opposes refuse to repent and go back to the original blood word the word became blood and flesh so he refuses to go back to the original word he keeps polluting the word well we just watched he refused to go back to it the true word bride he opposed the true word bride now he takes his own bride that's what this gathering is he opposes this true bride and he takes his own bride and brings her to him in a form of religion called creeds and dogmas and now seeing the holy bride he is against her now think about this what brother branham's saying he said and now seeing the holy bride because he's got to be against the word become fl blood and flesh he's against the word become blood and flesh that's what he's against he's not against your book sitting on your shelf he's not against your mp3 player he's not against the sd card on your phone he's against the word made blood and flesh and now seeing the holy bride he's against her hallelujah i'm determined that he's going to see more of her fully determined that he's going to see her the manifestation of the word for this hour that's what the bride is and seeing her seeing the holy bride he is against her but he forms his own bride called antichrist by antichrist teaching which is contrary to christ see how shrewd he is feast of trump is now you see what the beast is is don't you it's a power a power an ecclesiastical power that's a church power friends and that church power is influencing politics and will be completely unified with politics one day but it's an ecclesiastical power jesus said it'd be so close like the real thing it'd deceive the very elect if it was possible but he promised to have something here for us in that day that we wouldn't be deceived and that's the word and christ to make it manifest to us they're supernaturals devils unseen to the eye but you can see what they're doing you can't see the devil when when tony palmer's sitting here you can't see the devil that is anointing him you can't see that demonic spirit that's on him but you can hear what he's saying and see what he's doing and know that the man is completely under the influence of devils and then the entire crowd and that would say we bless you with all of our heart with all of our soul with all of our might hey that's a scripture that's supposed to be referring to your devotion to god not to the pope that is an example of beast worship if i've ever seen it displayed in the flesh that was beast worship worshiping the false prophet then all the people moving their hands we bless you be blessed be blessed friends people absolutely deceived have no idea that they're worshiping the devil good people with families love their bibles love the churches serving and working in the churches but because a prophet's ministry was rejected now they've gone through the white horse and the red horse and the black horse into total deception and dark ages and spiritual famine until now they'll suck down anything we thank god we should thank god every day for a prophet so now you supernatural devils unseen to the eye but you can see what they're doing so we want to watch one more clip to see what they're doing let's play this brother franco [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] confidential you see how they love the number four four religions four hands with idols and signs of idolatry they love the name number four but you see he says in there i don't know if you can catch all the words but he says that there's so many people in the world all call themselves believers amen and says and there's one thing and this this crowd of religions one thing that is certain everyone says they're seeking god their own way in their own way one thing that we know for certain is that we are all children of god i watched this today and i told franco i said go tell noah they're all children of god go tell moses go tell them they're not all children of god friends but you can't see the supernatural devils that broke out in the ecclesiastical world but you can see what they're doing now it's not just tying together the protestants and the catholics now we're tying together the buddhists and the muslims and we're tying it all together to where they're going to be a king over all religions and it's going to be the pope you can't see the spirits but you can see what they're doing and it's utter complete deception it doesn't match the scriptures it's a complete lie an utter fabrication but people by the millions billions are believing this brother bram says notice while the group is riding making themselves ready to stomp out everything that won't agree with them there is another group being made ready after a while revelations 19. the next time the church is heard she comes also not upon exactly horses i want you to catch that i love when the prophet says stuff and just totally messes up everything you've ever understood because when you see in revelation 19 the return of christ and he who rides on the white horse is faithful and true and behind him the armies of heaven follow riding on horses white horses brother branham said not upon exactly horses what are they llamas or camels what's he talking about he said he's talking about a spiritual happening not exactly upon white horses they're riding upon something and then the scriptures a horse is always a power hallelujah brother branham says in the 70th week of daniel here he comes riding on a white horse those who follow him on white horses horse powers they're riding on powers not exactly horses in the fourth seal he says may the holy spirit come down now the white horse rider the white horse rider is the holy spirit the one in revelations 19 that's the holy spirit in conferences in 1963 he says i'm riding on it not upon my affiliation upon my denomination upon my self-righteousness but i'm riding upon the word of god hallelujah the white horse is a power and they're writing on powers writing upon the word of god and the fourth seal the prophet says those that mix turn pale and go to death it's a perverting perversion to mix colors with white you pervert the original color now we're talking about original word is white to pervert it is to mix the colors he said the original color only color is white and you mix something with it you pervert its real cause amen is that right and if he is the white horse and he is the word so the white horse is the word then to mix anything with that any kind of creed add one word to it take one a word away from it it's perverted the whole thing so now brother branham says not writing exactly on horses but she's riding upon the word and jesus is the white horse and he is the word and the white horse rider is the holy spirit and a horse is a power what power is these armies of heaven riding on that will give them victory the only power is the word she comes also not upon exactly horses but the bible said he was on a white horse and the host of heaven was following him upon white horses now remember i want you to hold this in your mind jesus is also riding a white horse well this group down here has got 2 000 bound at the river euphrates and has been bound for 2000 years also that church has bound the holy ghost for nearly two thousand years under martyrdom back there and under the church ages it's been bound not at the river euphrates but at the door of creeds and dogmas that the holy spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems but she is going to be liberated she is coming back that's what the bible said and those two meet one another on the battlegrounds lucifer and michael again like in the beginning what has that got to do with her coming back what has that got to do with the releasing of the holy ghost has been bound for 2000 years but brother branham takes those two things and puts them right together he's been bound by what by man-made systems but she is going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the bible said and those two will meet together again on the battlegrounds lucifer and michael again like in the beginning why because the gospel trumpet is blown the seventh church age messenger has blown the entire revelation of jesus christ calling to war spiritual war hallelujah in this spiritual war you won't need a white horse in your backyard to keep feeding it until the time you just keep feeding that word into your soul and that's the power you're writing in this battle friends and the fourth seal he says notice life followed the writer on white horse who was the word life vindicated by his resurrected saints that he had with him now how's the battle going to go oh this is the part i've wanted to get to all night now when brother branham says he comes with resurrected saints be very careful you don't put that way off in the future somewhere amen how's the battle going to go jesus said he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live what we're talking about armageddon and he says he coming with resurrected saints how's the battle going to go well first he'll split his armies and then they're going to all get a sword no he says how's the battle going to go jesus said he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live amen he said if you believe in me though you were dead yet shall you live and whosoever liveth and believeth me shall never die again he said he that believes in me he will give him eternal life raise him up with the last days that's his promised scripture that's how the battle is going here comes satan with all four corners of the earth with his protestants and with his catholics see friends you get this it's not it's not like all of a sudden we're going to come out of church one day and all the catholics and protestants are gathered down here and they're ready to march against us and we've got to get a sword a physical sword and get a physical horse he's gathering them spiritually to attack spiritual jerusalem amen but we are riding on the power of the word and we have a sword of the spirit which is the word of god and we're being called and gathered for this great final standoff spiritually he comes satan with the four corners of the earth with his protestants and with his catholics and all together marching right up to the battle of armageddon all right and here comes jesus coming down from heaven with resurrected saints vindicated word what a resurrected saints vindicated word oh praise god well let me read a quote to you out of the rising of the son because i live you live also speaking to his wife because i live ye live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is what a resurrection i'm not looking at a future resurrection there's a resurrection going on right now there are resurrected saints now not in the flesh but in my soul has been born again what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power if you've received god's quickening power you've been made alive by christ jesus and what a resurrection you are part of today you are a resurrected saint vindicated word jesus comes with the resurrected saints vindicated word brother branham said the the resurrected saints are his vindication let's listen to the scriptures ephesians 2 verse 4 it says but god who is rich in mercy for this great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ hath already quickened us this is the apostle paul not william branham apostle paul he hath quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved and hath past tense raised us up together you are resurrected saints and have raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that means you're not only resurrected but you're already raptured because you're sitting with him in heavenly places friends you're just waiting for your physical body to change and catch up to where your soul has already been liberated to hallelujah so he's come not coming come amen riding on a white horse and his name is true and faithful and behind him are the armies of heaven on white horses and they are called amen and chosen and faithful chosen before the foundation of the world and faithful by their own choosing hallelujah i like that let's keep going now listen just watch the way the prophet says this don't think like we've always thought before and pigeonhole this somewhere else he's coming i'm going to read the top paragraph again and all together marching right up to the battle of armageddon all right and here comes jesus coming down from heaven with resurrected saints vindicated word as i said if god speaks and sends you he backs up what you say see and notice if you're an ambassador from heaven all heaven's behind you in heaven is consistent of the word so here he's talking about he's coming with resurrected saints and then he says if you're an ambassador from heaven have we been called ambassadors from heaven in the scriptures brother branham is tying this to resurrected saints ambassadors from heaven he's not putting it off in the future he's bringing it right here friends hallelujah if you're an ambassador from heaven all heaven's behind you now notice he's come with resurrected saints vindicated that vindicating that his word is true why because you received the quickening power and the quickening power has changed your life and brought your life to match this word and your life matching this revealed word is vindicating that he is true because if there was nobody on earth that could live this revelation then it would not prove that he's alive that he's been resurrected from the dead that he has quickening power but if there's a people on this earth that can live the full measure of the word it vindicates that jesus christ is resurrected from the dead and he has quickening power to quicken you to life not in the future now today he has quickening power to quicken you to life where you don't have to live like you used to live you don't have to live contrary to the word but you can live exactly in line every jot and every tittle to the word so much so that if you get out of step that holy ghost will bring you right back into repentance and you can live according to this word not by your power but by the quickening power of the resurrected jesus christ the one on the white horse [Applause] hallelujah notice he comes with resurrected saints vindicating that his word is true so satan knows that when the bottom satan knows then that the bottomless pit is ready for him why do you think he's going to resist you so hard because your vindicated life amen proves that the bottomless pit is waiting for him well that's why he wants you to fail every day he wants to keep getting victory over the word because when you stop letting down the bar on the word and you've got quickening power that proves that jesus christ is resurrected and alive in your flesh when the word becomes blood and flesh then he realizes that the bottomless pit is waiting for him amen friends god calls for a perfect holy life not a compromising life a perfect holy life you cannot read this scripture and find anywhere else where compromise is tolerated it is not allowed it is not permitted and every time it's found there's a call to repentance every time because the quickening power must quicken you to this manifested word to vindicate that he's alive every time that we we let down the bar and we show that the quickening power won't hold us and the quickening power won't give us victory in our lives we are putting casting doubt on whether or not jesus christ is resurrected or not because the resurrected zanes are his vindication this is the battle friends so satan knows when the bottomless pit is ready for him oh while death rode the pale horse mixed creed and denominations followed him eternal separation from god that's where he rode them to eternal separation christ rode his white horse yes his white horse that's called church christ rode his church right into glory in the resurrection that means you are the vindication that jesus christ is resurrected from the dead and his quickening powers quickened you to the word to prove that he is alive and he is riding that church all the way to glory in the resurrection that's the power that jesus christ is riding on is a resurrection in mortal bodies resurrected back to the life of the word hallelujah i like that there's going to be a people on this earth that live every jotten title and every slight infraction will bring them to repentance staying right in line by what by quickening power quickening power of the resurrected life of jesus christ and that is the power that he he is riding into glory hallelujah i just want to read a couple things is it all right if i go 10 more minutes amen i love you guys you're my favorite people hallelujah when jesus come to the earth no doubt as a boy he had manifestations we don't see any recorded except when he's disputing with the with the teachers and theologians in the temple and they were astonished at his doctrine we know that we know there must have been something because mary knew that he could turn water to wine before he had done a public miracle that's recorded at the wedding in cana mary knew that he could do it so no doubt there was some manifestation in his life that that that mary would have seen his life and would have known that he's capable she didn't have any doubts she wasn't worried she was she was excited she said just just just go get water pots and do whatever he says and so now at the marriage at the wedding in cana his ministry is shifting from a private manifestation to a public manifestation now it's not going to be what happens at home and just the family knows about it but now he's going to move into a public demonstration that's going to vindicate that he is the vessel that god is indwelling but before between the private at home manifestations in the public manifestation jesus has to go to jordan get baptized and after he's baptized he has to go to the wilderness to be tested he has to come to a showdown with the devil and in this showdown he would use absolutely zero manifestation of his supernatural power but the only thing he would do when he was facing the devil face to face in between the private life and the public life he's got to pass through this trial in the wilderness and he's got to come face to face with the devil here you have lucifer and michael on the battleground again amen and they're facing one another again and the battle is over the word the battle is not over his power his manifestation healing works and the ability to speak in tongues or interpret tongues or to see visions that was never the battle that was never what the fight was over but it was always on whether or not he would keep the word so he come down and satan is tempting him with the word just like he did eve and just like he did the angels in heaven and just like he did every saint down through history he's tempting them with the word but jesus he is the word and you're not going to deceive the word by the word so satan comes and he brings word but he brings word tainted he's bringing a mixed creed he's bringing a mixed word he's not bringing pure word although he's quoting the bible he's not bringing it in purity and even though he can quote the bible verbatim he's not bringing in the purity of the spirit talk about deception when the word is exactly spot on word for word for what's written in the bible but it's not coming in the spirit of the word because it wants a man to exalt himself even though the word is true it's not true amen in the spirit of the word [Music] that can only be discerned by the holy ghost so now jesus comes and and now the the devil comes and they're facing off again and he tempts him with the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes of the pride of life the same thing that he fell by and jesus deflects it every time with it is written it is written it is written and he has victory over the devil hallelujah wow brother branham says in sirs we would see jesus at the end of 1963. he said now let's take and see what he was we find as soon as he was baptized god come upon him in the form of a dove and he went into the wilderness for 40 days of temptation and there he defeated satan on the word first he defeated satan on the word then his earthly ministry began you see the pattern friends amen the bride has had at-home manifestations we've had healings we've had god moving miraculous ways for us but the bride has to be on display she's got to have a public ministry but she's got to defeat the devil on the word only not with powers not with manifestations not with healings not with dynamic services but she's got to stand face to face michael and lucifer on the battleground again and face to face and the only way she'll overcome is not beating the air and running around and getting a bunch of friends but she will overcome with it is written there's going to come a bride brother branham said this evil age is to prove to satan that this woman is not like eve that's what god is trying to do with this evil age all the wickedness that's out there he's trying to put you to the test to vindicate himself that he is he is risen from the dead and has quickening power and is quick in the body to life that he can dwell in and it's being put to the test in this evil age because he wants to show satan amen just like god wanted to show satan that this man is not like noah this man is not like moses this man is not like any of the other prophets but this is a perfect vessel that will not be defeated on the word and will not let down the bars on the word and the pride the bride has to come to the same battlegrounds not a big bunch of hoopla not a big something you can see but standing there facing the devil and saying it is written the bible says the prophet taught us the word of god says we're not going to let down on the word and when jesus come to that test tested by the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and when he overcame by the word then his ministry started because now god had a trusted vessel that he knew he could give all power to and he would only do what the word says do brother brent said every christian in here can defeat satan any place anywhere anytime on the word of the living god i like them he said jesus said get thee behind me satan it is written the works that i do shall you do also that's what jesus defeats satan he never used his power he was god manifested in the flesh but he didn't use his power all the gifts that there was in heaven he had them in him but he didn't use that he just took the father's word he said it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god it is written it is written it is written it is written and he defeated satan and the word of god will defeat satan anywhere on any grounds under any condition god's holy word do you believe that brother branham said in the church age book in revelation of jesus christ we all know this this is so famous we could probably all quote it but listen he says satan hates that revelation satan hates that he fights it right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army remember we're talking about the battle spiritual war if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her satan will not be powerless before her when she gets mighty manifestations or when there's prophecy going over the pulpit or when we have tongues and interpretations in a back room that's not when she will have victory she will have victory amen he will be powerless when she discerns the two spirits at war in her and she withstands the antichrist spirit then he will be powerless over the church don't wait for something we've got it we have the word we don't have to wait for anything to come to full victory satan will be powerless before he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert so what's it going to take to have the same victory that jesus christ had in the desert you have to discern the two spirits within the framework of the church and resist the antichrist spirit and then he will be powerless before you just as much so as he was powerless before jesus christ hallelujah in the message the greatest battle ever fought brother branham said god is calling every seed of abraham this morning to that same kind of life great battle is on now worldwide how many believe that a great battle is on now worldwide god wants his children separating themselves from what oh you're gonna like this the great battle is on worldwide and god wants his children separating themselves from what what does god want you to separate yourself from well movies and entertainments and worldly influences and bad friends and that's not what he's going to say what does he want them to separate from see taste feel smell here imagination conscience memories reasoning affection everything so that you don't trust the way you feel about something so that you don't trust the memory of what happened last time i tried to do this so you don't trust what you see or you can touch but you trust the word of god above all senses above all memories above your earthly affections above your memories above all your intellect there's nothing that you stand on but the word of god god the great battle is on and god wants his children to separate from what see taste feel smell and hear amen amen imagination conscious memory reasonings affection everything to where nothing stands between you and that word open their mind and let the word come in and march with the word that's a real soldier second timothy 2 3 says thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that warth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier do you want to please him who's chosen you to be a soldier praise the lord let's stand musicians if you come brother jim if you can make your way up i got one more slide don't switch me out yet i got one more slide romans 16 20 and the god of peace shall bruce satan under your feet shortly who wins this battle who fights this battle the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen paul knew he knew that in the end time when everything got wrapped up that god was going to have victory in his people he knew that the promise in genesis 3 amen of the woman's seed bruising the head of the serpent he knows that that has to come now into the body of christ and to the church and he says he's going to bruise i want to look at this word bruise we've done it before but i want you to see it the word bruise suntribo bruise break broke into shivers breaking pieces means to break to break in pieces shiver to tread down to put satan under foot as conqueror trample on him to break down to crush to tear one's body and shatter one's strength god is going to do that under your feet shortly and all we have to do is stay with the word uncompromising with the word and receive the quickening power of the holy ghost that'll quicken us through this word and you'll be an invincible army and he will be powerless before you god bless you can switch it over let's just pray the heavenly father we thank you lord for this word you are amazing to us lord god that you would take broken vessels humble creatures lord born like other human beings are born but god you had predestinated a plan for this certain lump of clay and you knew that in that would be a portion of eternal life that you would quicken the life someday and that would stand as a soldier in your battle and god though we don't we don't understand completely lord why you would choose this lump of clay we know it was before the foundation of the world so we question it not lord lord but just make us faithful to your word to stay in our post of duty lord to have complete victory in this day that we live lord take our vessels take our bodies take our minds help us lord to separate from the senses lord help us to separate from everything we know and everything we see and help us to receive your word only god how we love you lord how we love you lord how we want to be

going to haiti if you could come forward now we want to pray over you as a church brother brian brother elmer brother manuel brother kyle just come down to the front where all the ministering brothers come down behind them we are going to believe that god is going to do supernatural things with our brothers that he's going to use them to hold up a light in a dark place and then we're going to send our full support with them remember apostles are sent ones they've got to be sent from somewhere there's got to be somebody who sends them and they've been called by the holy ghost and the holy ghost has sent them and we're going to recognize that as a body of believers that we're sending them off in the name of jesus christ let's gather them brothers come up here lay hands on them they're heavenly father lord i play hands on these vessels lord they've surrendered to you they've given up their time with their family they're giving up time from work lord to find your will and to go walk in your perfect plan i pray that you would anoint brother kyle and avoid another manual to preach the gospel lord that you would move their their own thinking out of the way lord in their own strength and you would come in with the power of the holy ghost and you would preach through their lips lord that you would speak directly to the hearts of your lost sheep and that you would bring back your bride lord we ask that you would touch them and anoint them and be with them protect them in their travels protect their families while they're gone lord god i lay hands on brother elmer lord brother brian just pray that you would touch them anoint them give them wisdom lord as they labor and they work for the bride of jesus christ in haiti anoint them bless them and protect them and keep them

there i pray god that your anointing would be upon them your hand would be upon them and that you would go with them and bring them back safely that you would accomplish all your purpose and will in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless your brothers amen amen hallelujah i can't wait for the report you know sometimes you just know something good is going to happen and you just can't wait what was that song you're playing let's sing that power that how many believes there's power in the name of jesus how many believes i'm gonna challenge you with this how many believes that by the quickening power there is power for a perfect life not your life a life that he comes in and lives through you how many believes there's power for that then quit trying with your own power receive the quickening power and let him do it through you believe it there's power to break every yoke of bondage to break all the powers of the enemy all habits and all family traits and all all spirits of compromise and all doubts and all fears and all anxieties amen in all complexes it can all be broken and there's going to be a bride who's free in the name of jesus christ she's going to be an invincible army in the name of jesus christ because what we've received is not a dip in the spirit in this age we've not received a portion of the spirit but we've received the full power of the full spirit of jesus christ that's what the word coming back has brought us friends and we should expect to have full power for a full overcoming life that every obstacle we face we will conquer in the name of jesus christ by the word of god we're not going to accept complexes that's carried over from family by generation we're not going to accept that family habits and traits we're not going to accept that anymore because we're coming to a perfect body of jesus christ upon this earth under the headship of christ it's not going to be like it was friends it's going to be different than it's ever been but you have to expect it and believe for it you can't say oh god help me and expect it to continue you can't expect it to stay the same anymore we've got to recognize that what came down what was symbolized and that cloud coming down was the headship coming to the body amen and the body is completely controlled by the head the body's not controlled by the body but the body is controlled by the head and the headship has come down when the word came to the body and now the body is in subjection to the head tell me the headship of jesus christ in your life can't bring you to a perfect perfect identification with this word you try to tell me that that's a lie but the headship in your life will bring you to match this word [Music] if you're struggling with that you can go free if the devil is limiting you in that you can go free friends but you've got to denounce that thing and you've got to rebuke it you've got to hate it amen if you can't get over yourself you call for the church to pray with you if you've got a if you've got to have hands later you have hands lately but don't live with it anymore because we're coming to the time of an invincible army amen it's not time to be limping and staggering and barely making it that's not the age we're called to friends we're called to the full power of jesus christ don't live with it a day longer you go to task with the devil and you kick him out and tomorrow you kick him out and the next day you kick him out and you stay there toe to toe until you are completely free in the name of jesus christ don't you give up after a month don't you give up after two months you fight until you are free from every complex and every habit and every fear and all anxiety until you're free that's what the full word came from that's what quickening power is for friends i think sometimes we've lived with with complexes and fears and anxiety so long we don't realize that we don't have to live with it [Music] but i don't see it in the word where i have to live with it [Music] i can go free when jesus christ was here in a body that body was free [Music] and as jesus christ here in a body [Music] then that body should be free and that body can be free and that body will be free hallelujah let's sing this song you can be dismissed as you need to be you can stay in worship as long as you like let's sing the spirit there is power in the name of jesus there is power in the name of jesus there is power in the name of jesus to break every chain break every chain drink every chain there's freedom there is freedom in the
