[0:00] that meisd that theophany of God was
[0:02] made into the Flesh of Jesus Christ he
[0:04] was Jesus Christ in a prefigure now he
[0:07] came down Amen to what to have the
[0:09] feeling of our infirmities to come flesh
[0:12] like we're flesh that that that now that
[0:14] malisic priesthood must come down and
[0:17] the mlisc priesthood isn't after carinal
[0:19] ordinances but it's the priesthood
[0:21] that's after an eternal life an
[0:23] everlasting life amen because he had no
[0:25] beginning of days no ending of life no
[0:27] father no mother it was eternal life was
[0:30] God's life amen that was moving down now
[0:32] it moved down into this priesthood it's
[0:34] a priesthood of life not Conor
[0:36] ordinances but eternal life the life of
[0:40] God Amen and that high priest had to
[0:42] have blood for sanctification so he
[0:44] offered his own
[0:47] blood and that blood amen representing
[0:50] the life what life the very life that
[0:53] God had put into flesh amen that life
[0:56] now amen was given as a ransom for you
[0:58] and I so that the life that was in the
[1:00] blood can come back upon you and I and
[1:02] that's what brings us into Sons and
[1:04] Daughters of God and Kings and
[1:07] Priests so now what order of mesed do we
[1:10] have what is that order what do we have
[1:13] we have
[1:15] life it was an order of Life what did
[1:18] the blood represent all the time when
[1:20] the when the a the ironic priesthood
[1:22] they were slaying lambs and slaying
[1:24] lambs and slaying lambs and they were
[1:25] carrying it behind amen the T into the
[1:28] Tabernacle and putting it on the altar
[1:29] alter and and now taking it once a year
[1:31] into the holy of holies what were they
[1:33] doing they were showing that there's
[1:35] life there has to be life as a
[1:37] substitute for our fallen failed life
[1:39] amen the the whole thing was about life
[1:42] perpetually about life they had to offer
[1:45] a life for a life and the blood
[1:48] represented there was an innocent victim
[1:50] that was my substitute it was all about
[1:52] life but now Jesus Christ comes and
[1:55] sheds his blood to do what to purchase
[1:58] for us life and now his life comes into
[2:01] us and now we're a priesthood that's
[2:03] carrying
[2:05] blood amen because without the shedding
[2:08] of blood is no remission of sins and the
[2:10] priests are constantly offering blood
[2:12] where is our blood if we're a priesthood
[2:14] who's interceding and petitioning we
[2:16] have to intercede and petition with
[2:18] blood where is the blood that we
[2:20] intercede and petition with it's the
[2:21] very life that was in the blood the Life
[2:24] of Christ the mlisc life is in us in a
[2:27] portion making us a priesthood after the
[2:29] order of mezc after the order of our
[2:31] high priest so that when we petition we
[2:34] petition with a
[2:36] token with the life not just saying God
[2:39] would you forgive but God Amen I'm
[2:41] bringing to you your life amen I'm
[2:43] presenting back to you the blood that
[2:45] was shed the life that's in me I'm
[2:47] standing in the gap for this individual
[2:50] and I'm presenting to you your own life
[2:53] your own
[2:54] blood yes sir why can we do that because
[2:57] we were born in affirmative we were born
[2:59] in flesh as we come after this order we
[3:02] understand or at least we should
[3:04] understand
