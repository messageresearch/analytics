presence lord you said that you you honor your bride by bringing your presence lord thank you for that lord thank you for the song service lord we bless your holy name lord without you lord we can do nothing lord and so we just glorify the name of jesus christ who is here in our midst to open the word to the people of god we just say thank you lord jesus praise your mighty name hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord amen and amen hallelujah good to be here tonight praise god and [Music] we want to turn in our bibles to psalm 107 19-21 psalm 107 19-21 we seems like the last few times we always have trouble getting here uh this time we made it by the grace of god and but our luggage came on monday and that's that's kind of fine for the guys because you know you wear your socks three or four days then then it's like a challenge how many days can i go but for the sisters that's a different different story so praise the lord jesus god's merciful amen psalm 107 19-21 then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from all their destructions oh that men would praise the lord for the for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing praise the lord let's read in another place 2 thessalonians 2 1-4 familiar verse chapter and verses 2 thessalonians 2 1-4 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day as that the day of the of christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a great falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he is god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god lord we know that you are a god who's full of grace and mercy and you're a god of the word lord and god you don't honor us you honor the word in our life lord and so i'm so thankful for that lord and so we ask you to have your own way open your word to us lord may the holy spirit escort the word into our heart and god if anyone is listening tonight who's a sinner god whether here or on the the internet may the holy spirit come down in conviction and may they repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and god they will receive the holy spirit we thank you so much lord in the name of jesus christ amen praise the lord you may be seated hallelujah so tonight this is my title is god is in his word and you're saying well of course of course he is all right let's see after i'm done if you can say that right hallelujah and i love that scripture in 107 psalms 107 they cried unto the lord and he saveth them out of their distresses he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions and what an appropriate uh scripture it is even today still also in um i just forgot what book it was in but you know there's several be still and know that i'm god and no weapon formed against us shall prosper and and see those those are for believers no matter where they're at and and because every weapon that is formed against you is formed against christ and and as we have christ on the inside then we can never be defeated even in death we can't be defeated praise the lord and so it becomes a life of just constant joy and victory and overcoming i i just see that more and more it's it's like this wave of overcoming a word coming daily it governs every little thing hallelujah and so it's a wonderful time to be alive and so it's up to us to encourage others our children those around us not to focus on all the things that go on but to focus on that it's a wonderful time to be alive because we get to see the culmination of all things we get to see our life be victorious over satan amen hallelujah and so i love that i love being a christian and i love being a part of god because he who began a good work in me he who began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it you can all you're only maturing hallelujah which means you'll be the best forgiver someone cuts you off or does something to you you you say poor little fellers amen uh you know someone else from another church might dig you a little bit you'll say poor little fellas amen lord god just do something amen hallelujah and so that's what i'm talking about that's the holy spirit uh because that's more than just a nice person see god's not coming back for nice people he's coming back for believers amen and he's coming back for those that love god with all their heart amen oh hallelujah and so in our scriptures it said that the falling away there'll be a great falling away and so what are they falling away from and so even around message ranks people are falling away from the word still good people wonderful people but people the devil is distracting those to fall away from the word you're saying but but they have the word yes but have they even received it at the soul amen and so it causes people to when things get a little tough they kind of back up away from it amen and so people today are falling away from the word and its inherent nature and its power and its abilities because all of those things must be placed inside of you and i and they just don't automatically get there amen we repent we're baptized and then god promises to give us the holy spirit you know what if you are desperate how many came out of the world desperate yeah and i tell you what you didn't have to wonder when god did something for you right amen because you repented and you were baptized and god gave you the holy spirit and from that day you just started growing and it wasn't you you weren't adding miracle grow to your bathtub amen but you were you were all of a sudden there was something different and he just he's growing and growing and moving and moving and moving amen hallelujah and that's the word the word does that praise the lord but see it's they're not falling away from their concept of jesus christ in the word they're falling away from the word amen see we're in the final age and because of that there's spiritual darkness if you haven't noticed but there's also great light and both of them show up at the same time like judas and jesus right and so that antichrist spirit is here with the bride of jesus christ and so that antichrist spirit brother brahms said is here to weaken the church not just out and out blatantly do stuff but just just a little here just a little here and all of a sudden you know you like eating twinkies you get a real rush of sugar but afterwards you're kind of tired amen see there's no nutrition in that amen and so that's what's happening today is that that that people are are not sure anymore and so they're feeding the the people what they think is right without knowing what is right and the word is always right i don't care who you are though i'm gonna stay with the word no matter what oh someone was trying to sell me on a ministry one time and i said i'm sorry this third this this one little scripture here i can't get past that oh it infuriated them but what about all these great things and great teachings they're like i'm sorry husband of one wife that's it amen praise the lord amen hallelujah but see so people they're falling away from strength see the word gives you strength it lights your path it shows you what to do amen that's why again that's why those worldly things don't don't don't keep us like they did before we're always tempted to do things we're always tempted to to speed or to to do this little that amen but see but now you're just you're like oh god i'm sorry you know you get to talking and worship and all of a sudden whoa back down see that's a sin of omission but but what i'm i just use that as a little example because there's many more things uh like paying your tithes and your offerings amen i hope everybody gives heavy on offerings it's something there tithe is your obligation where you're blessed is an offering that offering doesn't usually go it doesn't go to the minister so don't think that it goes to pay these bills this is electricity this is heat or air conditioning that's why when you go to service you come ready to give because that's where god promises to give you 30 60 or 100 fold amen amen yeah you didn't like that i'm sorry last time i was here there was some comments on youtube and it's like sorry i'm here again amen hallelujah that's the beauty of knowing who you are i just don't care amen hallelujah but see this is a time of the spirit of apostasy or it means defection from the word it just has to be and as we see that we know that we're in god's time amen yet it's also the time where the bride of christ is beginning to shine in her glory it's the time when when individual brides are being persecuted in message churches for what she believes and and she even has the manifestation of attitudes and healings and things in her life that god has completely taken yet they're looking at you like you're old-fashioned we don't want that in our church hallelujah amen but it's your time to shine amen and you just stay with that word and we're going to see what brother ram said in a while so it is the time of apostasy see that man of sin that that spirit of that man of sin is already here it has to be that way so that the man of sin can be manifested and so since it's already here then then then what happens the word not message theology the word gets watered down amen can't can we see that this gets watered down praise the lord jesus and so it's lord if it's watered down how can we be protected how can our families be protected how can the token be applied amen how can we keep our houses clean except the token is there and that token came because of revelation on the word for our day oh praise it works i promise you amen hallelujah but see that spirit of the church is to weaken the people yet prosper and grow in numbers yet have more people come into a message church right hallelujah like balaam i'm hard on myself just like balaam sold out for a few more people a little bit more money all right amen because we still live in laodicea we are in the bright age we're in the maturing age for the bride not the message people two different things and we're gonna see that tonight hey hey man completely different oh lady you say well you're not very uplifting tonight brother but i pray it'll do you good and so how does faith come oh you just go to church and if your pastor says you know this is what brother branham said and you know and and all this other stuff you see or that we do you know it doesn't matter see you should be going back into the word you should be going back into the messages and catching the spirit of the thing amen and then you should be saying hey deacons we need a meeting right hallelujah praise god and so faith comes by hearing the word of god nothing else i don't care how nice how beautiful how wonderful god doesn't come for that he comes forward people amen hallelujah amen and so faith comes by hearing the word and that's why god wants his holy ghost to dwell within you hey we need more than just enough to come to church we need to we need more enough to just to say amen to the word we need to have it in practice in our life hallelujah because all of us want to prosper and be in health right and i'm not talking so much about money prospering i'm talking about exceeding abundant above what we ask or think that is the difference between a church member and a holy ghost filled believer amen i live abundantly what about you how many lives abundantly well i'm not sure what you mean brother because i love the word and no one can talk me away from it no one can brainwash me that's why i mean i uh last year i preached in the denominational pentecostal church see some people would just kick you out just for that where else are they going to hear when i'm in the front row and the music is so loud that the one of the men that came with me went to the back oh man my head i haven't felt like that since my concert days in the world right amen but see when they begin to hear the word guess what happened they were like wow amen none of them may come fully into it but they heard the word amen hallelujah and so god wants us to prosper he wants us as we're going to see to be able to speak and go forward to know that our prayers are actually heard by god amen hallelujah and so a fully surrendered man or woman is omnipotent you are all powerful you are little messiahs i've said it plenty times before omnipotent means you hold sway or power over all things praise the lord you you young kids you adults you control your atmosphere you create the atmosphere you call things that are not as though they are amen it's you that that believes god so much that that you just you just say this is how it is because it's the word hallelujah that makes you want to run and jump doesn't it praise the lord see in mark 11 23 it says for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith brother branham put that scripture with that quote about being omnipotent when two omnipotents meet you and god that's what the word will do for you you will have command and victory over every attitude in spirit that tries to come upon you hallelujah amen you won't sit there at the light and lust after the woman or the man walking across the street right amen are you tempted sometimes yes but you will not give in to sin are we like christ or we're not now we're getting someplace amen the word it is all the word amen you are all the word amen amen praise god see if god says it in his word then it's there for use for you to use and to glorify him not yourself that's why any ministry that glorifies himself is not of god even though they raise the dead heal the sick cast out devils know every bit of quote nailed the messages it's not of god hallelujah and so if it see it how will anybody know see that's the thing if we don't tell them what the word is because a lot of people don't want to hear that god sent a prophet and that can come maybe after the initial but they need to see see when when when people see your life and they see how you how you handle yourself then brother branham said when somebody says to another unbeliever i really like him i really like her that's witnessing because they're looking at the virtue of jesus christ coming out of you hallelujah and so we we know that people need to hear the word i had someone call me up the other day or text me and said oh man i miss your smiling face at work let's get together for breakfast complete unregented man and another one says oh we miss you here at work why is that be i i'm nothing but they miss the virtue they miss me studying they miss me talking about the lord they miss jesus christ amen hallelujah are you jesus tonight amen praise god hallelujah so how will they know except you live it and so too many people good people but see it's a lot of it is the ministry fault that's an absolute it's we've lost a generation or two because ministry have compromised on the word and so if if you presume you're dead if i went into a fire on the nozzle under my own impression i'd be dead there's you don't get a halfway dead right if i go up a stairway where there's fire burning below the hallway and i step on it i'm dead it's just like oh i can do what i want no you can't do what you want i don't care if you go to a message church you can't do what you want and if you've got that spirit tonight that's the devil amen you are jesus christ you do what he wants amen hallelujah if you presume you are dead because to presume is to venture without a authority yeah see we're trying to stretch us into more of god amen see i grew up in a home it wasn't perfect but when mistakes were made forgiveness dad would gather us please forgive me he getting to the pulpit he says i can't preach today he because my wife and i had a fight i asked her forgiveness will you forgive me praise god amen that's that spoke and so if it wasn't for that and seeing jesus christ alive i never would have came back i mean we know predestination but but in our in that experience of coming out of the world into christ that the devil couldn't tell me there was no god the devil couldn't tell me he wasn't alive amen and i've i already experienced forgiveness and what that was about and so see because god sent his word into this day see now our children could know who god is in your home they should know who mr and mrs jesus christ is praise god they should know what god will do there's nothing wrong with going to the doctor but we should be praying because it seems like the last several times that i've had things happen i went to the doctor but god healed me there i don't know why right and so they can see who god is and they can see what god will do that's all i want i don't care if my kids are brain surgeons i just i have a promise it's called the token and they will all be filled with the holy spirit that's all that matters to me see romans says all things work together for good to them that love the lord to those that are called according to his purpose right see that's it's written about you praise the lord and so the atmosphere of a living god must be in our homes praise god you fill in all the blanks what shouldn't be there well i just do it to unwind a little bit okay tell god that right we just watch all these videos you know they're harmless right romans 10 14 15 it says how then shall they call on him and whom they have not believed and how should they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good of good tidings amen see the one who stands in this pulpit has to know not presume and you are obligated to make this person in this pulpit toe the line by the word amen gone are the days where you just blatantly to say oh whatever you say right that that went out with probably in the 60s or 70s or it should have right and so in john 10 4-5 it says and and when he put us forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers and you're probably sitting there go well how do i know who's right amen this is not about who you know is right this is about you knowing that you know it's right this is about individual experience this is about and you say well how will i know because i'll just say what he said because god will bring this to pass in your life you just have to ask amen praise god that's the only way i know that i'm i'm saved and full of the holy ghost is that i've been i've been growing my family my wife we've been growing hallelujah i don't want anybody else i i just want god i want his word amen and so for the person coming behind this desk each person has to meet god in a supernatural way that's that's just that's what brother graham said you cannot get up here if you haven't met god in some sort of supernatural way hallelujah because then you're presuming because when times get tough when they get hard amen then you can look back and say i know god called me i know what he did i know how he spoke to me and i'm not going anywhere i'm not going to run out i'm not going to desert these people who cares if they if the ties are 20 a month amen hallelujah if you start preaching the word then things are going to change amen praise god and so it is through god called ministers not all ministers are called it's through god called ministers that this word is taught and preached so that you and i can know what the truth is amen by this word oh hallelujah brother branham said in exposition of the seven church ages he has placed his church in the care of god ordained spirit-filled word living that's important to me who men who lead the people through feeding through feeding them with the word amen let's just try living what what he said besides going beyond what he said let's just try to it's like a balloon the message is like a balloon and we are like that second balloon in there that that god is pumping up well what is happening is it's expanding and spanning expanding to the full revelation of the first balloon we don't go beyond those things see this this word is so that it's for the bride this is the elisha ministry for the bride amen because we have to do the greater works amen overcoming evil that's a greater work talking about your brother or sister that's the greater work and so we have different message gods but there's only one right there's only one revelation i'm not responsible for all those other ones because they're not they are not producing anything eternal amen eternal is the young people changing the parents changing god having preeminence that's that's what should be happening in our churches hallelujah and so there's different message gods everywhere but see god ordained his his revelation of this word to free the people to take you out of this age amen i think it was sister norman or brother one of the they they had a dream about those people in that cave with nine inch bars and brother branham was in front of it and and and the voice says let my people go and he goes i don't know i don't know how they're too big and all of a sudden jesus the word appeared into the midst and he says you gates of hell and i can't remember the rest but they just exploded and the people are running out praise the lord i'm free amen the word has set me free amen oh glory to god amen the word amen amen this which is the message this is jesus christ hallelujah and so the gospel has to be preached in the demonstration and the power of god and it's not for the world to see you know who cares if they catch it on internet you know what happens i'm sure things happen all the time here that the rest of of the world never knows just like us world doesn't know that god's still alive amen in that body praise the lord but see the revelation of jesus christ for this day is so the bible will be a new book to those that love him this will be the new book amen see you still have to come through the cross you still have to be washed in the blood of the lamb you still have to feed on this word amen and so don't don't give me your associations because i'm going to vomit right i really don't care are you saved are you sanctified are you full of the holy ghost and are you growing through the stature of the perfect man into adoption that's what i want amen hallelujah and so my goal or chad's goal whoever's goal this is not about to minister to be invited back because i don't care right i love being in that position if no one pays tithes again praise the lord i don't care it's just that they are in you know they won't be blessed anymore but for me i don't care see it's our goal is for the congregation not to like us has anybody played organized sports his or her goal is for you not to like them it's to train you and drive you to a point and past that point that you never thought you could do amen and you don't like them sometimes praise the lord but our our purpose as a minister is to deliver the unadulterated word of god to the people and see you grow if if i lived in a shack just seeing people receive jesus christ in the word that's the greatest reward i could ever have amen and so we know that the main thing is demonstrating demonstrating to this is ministry demonstrating a true spiritual relationship between god and man the minister we have to demonstrate that we have to have our kids see that we must have the world see that even when we don't think they're watching but that has to be because we want the sheep to have the same thing praise the lord jesus and so what happens when you preach the word then the spirit of god transforms those that hear the word amen but see all of us we've been we've been in the place where the preacher says something is like oh but at the same time you're just going lord if if that's you then then then reveal it to me amen praise the lord and so because of this day of apostasy this great defection from the word it puts christ on the outside amen the spirit of the age is defection from the word that's what paves for the man of sin and we know that in jesus time he says i come in my father's name and he didn't receive me well he said but if another will come in his name you'll receive them that's exactly what has happened that that spirit of denomination is of the devil is the other name and people suck it up like it's cotton candy amen well brother we want to we want a church that has a little more programs for our kids okay have a nice life i pray for him but you're judging a church on that right you're judging a church on the number of people are there you're judging the church on the music you're judging the people on on on programs for old and young people come on we should be more mature than that amen we should be judging it by you actually prayed through and you know beyond shadow of doubt if i came and put a gun to your head right now and says is this your church you should be able to say you can shoot me i know this is my church but now when you get offended over here over here over here musical churches amen hallelujah i say that so we know this is not my usual message amen i'm sorry i still believe that he's a miracle worker because he is hallelujah but but you'll see where i'm going see another name people will receive jesus but when he comes as the plain non-beautiful jesus christ yeah it's just not exciting enough brother that time when they come in they looked in our church brother you only have a piano in oregon see my inside voice wanted to say yeah the dead are still raised the sick are still healed amen see but for the bride and we're getting we're over halfway for the bride in our day those who are led by the spirit and the love of the word you will have a spirit of sacrifice as a parent you will give up maybe what you like so your kids can have things that god wants in their home amen you will the the man is the head of the home but he's also the greatest person to sacrifice for his family because for the husband it goes god family and you and so it may be mean giving up things so that your wife can be at peace in the home amen so the kids can be at peace in the home and so those who are led by the spirit amen who love the word that is a great stabilizer brother brown said the word is the stabilizer it is the living word that is the stabilizer not well brother so and so oh he preached a wonderful message oh i just love the word that that's it's it's it's only the word if this is in it it's only the word if he's living it it's only the word if it's being manifested from him oh hallelujah and so the word is different from what your church believes sometimes or what they teach sometimes see your you might be insulated here the rest of the message world it's a mess but this is what's alive and it's personal to you that's what you need to find amen and so see god did not design us to contact him with our intellect but some of us we're all made different right we have different likes and dislikes god gives us a pastor who fills that void right but see god is not known by our intellect and god is not known by our emotions or our flesh because if you're desperate and you repent and are baptized he promises to give you the holy ghost so you come up out of that pool saying thank you lord jesus you saved me you cleansed me you i've been baptized in your name and i thank you for what you have already done and then you go thanking him and you will see the growth hallelujah praise the lord but see it is it god we're not made to contact god with our flesh or spirit though we're emotional people sometimes but it is faith which is the substance and that comes by the word only amen hallelujah and so i just want to tell you tonight no matter if i feel don't you love those mountaintop times where you're just praise god and you know everything is going and god's answering all these prayers see it doesn't matter if i'm in that state or i don't feel anything amen amen in my emotion or my flesh but see i get up and there's a song in my heart right there's joy and peace within there but this outside you try studying when you're tired see if you're not called it would it would demoralize you but see when you're called you'll study when you're tired because you don't feel him but you're trusting in the leadership of the lord to do it amen and so i don't i don't judge my walk with god by how i feel or what i see i judge it by the word coming to pass and that i want to follow every word so i'm led in the right direction amen see john 5 30 it says i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not my own will but the will of the father which has sent me i and my father are one amen john 10 30. that's me that's you i don't seek my own will my judgment is just oh brother you're pretty cocky no i'm just being her you're just being her do you realize that just because you go from this dimension to the next you don't change and you will be judging the the saints and so if you don't know you're that here then you won't be that there amen i'm here to help lift this up a little higher to accept brother chad is he's going in the right direction i believe amen amen he's not my idol i don't consult with brother chad website i don't need him to tell him that to tell me i'm going in the right direction but i appreciate him i love him and it's good to see people that just want the word amen but see you have to know that i my father are one and that i don't do anything until i hear from god that's why all of your decisions slow down because you're talking to your husband amen and so our experience will bring emotion when god got a hold of me i was bawling and snotting and oh it was i was a mess but my experience is not defined on that i know something happened but it wasn't because i was worked up or crying hallelujah it is because he did something and so it's not because you agree with some intellectual stimulating phrase that some teacher said that is not the evidence of the holy ghost the evidence of the holy ghost is that you believe every word of god believe every word of god not believe every word of god you believe every word of god that's why the word of god is so important to us tonight amen hallelujah amen and so we always have him i always have them in my heart when i make the biggest blunders or mistakes in the world i don't want to throw in the towel but i'm just crawling on my knees back to god for forgiveness that shows something is different hallelujah he's always he's always ruling you he's always reigning in you what are you sad about well they made us wear masks let me put you back in the time of jesus when the romans could do anything they wanted to you there's going to be greater trials i hope that is the least i have rights brother rich no you don't you have a right to serve god and to do what the word says praise the lord amen hallelujah see your home life in your church life exactly the same you driving down i-75 is the same as you are in church amen and so we do we have greater storms coming folks brother banham says stay with the word stay with the revelation of jesus christ stay with christ is the mystery of god revealed stay with his revelation amen hallelujah and so no matter how we feel during these storm times there are challenging times absolutely but just stay with the word that's all god wants brother brown said there's no special church i used to hear that back in the 80s and 90s all the time oh come to our church we have all the revelation where are they now i don't like it do you think we like to see people fail well they just weren't predestinated oh give me a break if you have that attitude i want you down here in the altar right now oh they're just see for us oh they're just pentecostal last time i checked we're sovereign last time i checked that brother bam says that after the seals we have a day of pentecost pentecostal experience which means we just believe everything he says don't try to box up jesus christ in your little mightier than thou attitude amen because you know what's going to happen god is going to cut your legs off and let you be on the ground to where that little unrevelated message person is going to be the one to help you and you know i don't care i i don't have hurt feelings at all i just want us to recognize christ amen and so see in our day we have a tendency to glorify everything else except the word and what god does we're glorifying men and we should not do that amen and so it's not about his word it's it's about everything else when it should be all about jesus christ the word oh hallelujah don't add anything to it don't take away anything from it well it doesn't mean that today oh shut up amen see we're way past the denominational pentecostals being the shock it's right here it's the message churches they are the shock now hallelujah it is here but the bride is growing within every church and she's being protected until the time that they say i can't take your your little butt on the back of your head anymore and you won't listen to our message music anymore and you won't watch our message movies anymore and you won't you won't run around with us kids and do things message kids do let's say we don't want you anymore you say i love you i pray for you blessed be the name of the lord anyway amen amen you'll be there until they disfellowship you hallelujah and so who would have ever thought our ministry would be explaining away the word you better be grateful for a ministry here that does not try to explain away the word of god hallelujah god is his own interpreter of this message amen hallelujah amen but see it's that spirit trying to render the people void of life and life is not and i'm not being blasphemous but it's not jumping around hopping and and until you're out of your head god can use that but it is about you coming to church prayed up ready to worship and then the song service just it just feels like whoa something is happening here amen and then the minister comes into the pulpit and it just goes on from there and you're just rejoicing amen hallelujah because life is here oh the life of christ is pleased amen amen don't worry there's one lord there's one baptism there's one faith there's only one message hallelujah amen hallelujah this message of life was to call out you and equip you to be an overcomer oh let's just drop our isms let's drop what we think amen let's just let's just do what he says amen i don't care i'll still like you amen all i wanted to do god equipped you for this day just take what he says then amen hallelujah amen see when the children of israel came out of egypt only two of the original minus the children went in because we know 20 years and older went in but but the others could not go in why was it they were in a message church they listened to a message pastor but they refused to follow the word of the lord they were too scared oh i don't i think we need to get our kids into another church that has more progress because they're just going into the world well let me tell you sister let me tell you brother why don't you get on your knees and pray throughs for those children why don't you take your experience pray through so that they can see that you actually love them hallelujah he gave us this word to equip you to be victorious amen see the rest of those 2 million they had all the signs and wonders and miracles they had a message pastor but they didn't have faith two of the original had faith hallelujah amen see satan exalts himself above all that is called god brother brown said and god is the word and any church that exalts their church over this word it's a lie it has to be this word it has to be jesus christ and then you want to see god move in your midst you want to see god heal the sick raise the dead cast out devils meet all your financial needs save your kids that's when you'll see that amen hallelujah see the devil wants you worshiping him and not not the word he wants to be exalted and too many good people think they are but they are they're they're not amen and and people always i always feel like they're saying well who do you think you are to tell us that i'm mrs jesus christ take it or leave it i know where i stand do you praise the lord amen that's the kind of confidence we need hallelujah you should be said there brother rich yes sir amen amen hallelujah but see satan exalts himself above what is called god the word of god amen and so the devil wants that and in the days of jesus the people in their message of the hour chose a murderer instead of the word amen and we've done the same thing i'm afraid not the bride but see i'm we are the bride if we're converted amen if we love god but but i want to see everybody i want to see all people come to christ i don't want to have see people with bad attitudes amen i want them to know that they know that they know and so the battle today is between man's idea and the vindicated word the vindicated word the word that comes to pass in your life when you have that need amen and so the devil has his children but i don't want to think that but just because you go to a message church you're not marrying my kids amen right just because you go to preaching a message doesn't mean you're preaching in our pulpit no nope but see the bride is rich with gold the gold of god she is tried in the fire and she manifests the victory of her husband amen and it manifests the character of jesus christ who would have ever thought that rich cobb would be that way how many was in the world you you look back and you say how am i here today how it's his sovereign grace and and he's it's his character that he's building us see it's god's revelation of his word that carries her above the world it carries her and keeps her from all that is called worldliness that's why somebody with the holy ghost can never absolutely not go back into the world amen god keeps you spotless you are perfect and entire wanting nothing you are you have spot and wrinkled there's no spot and wrinkle you are perfect you know why brother brown says he hears your voice but he sees you through the blood that's actually he doesn't even see you he said he just hears the voice oh glory to god amen praise god see in our day christ in the true church is the continuation of the starts of the b book x yes hallelujah what made them different just just take away all the signs and wonders of miracles they said yes to all the word amen that's what god wants that's why we are a continuation of the book of acts amen hallelujah praise the lord brother brown said this is the time when the devil is trying to destroy god's people and the word of god not in my life not in your life the devil's trying to discourage people from standing alone on the word you have to be prepared for that to stand totally alone hallelujah and so he says the devil wants to discredit the word of god to the people because he wants to say you know god's a healer but maybe not for you god saves and fills with the holy ghost but maybe not for you no he did it once it's all for you amen healing is el shaddai amen it's the double-breasted it's both spiritual and physical healing they are together amen hallelujah and if he saves somebody one time then he will save you the same amen hallelujah and so why are people going back to denominational pentecostal things i i'm old enough where i i was there and i and you can still watch all the videos from the 50s and 60s why well we've been held down too long people have forgotten what the holy ghost is like really you forgot that god saved you and cleaned you up you forgot that he supernaturally put you and your wife together and now your kids are serving god you forgot that you forgot that he's the the same yesterday today and forever you forgot that what in the world is being preached then not the word hallelujah or they want to go back to be a baptist intellectualism an intellectualist one of the missionaries that brother otto kony that we listen to is his testimonies and he had one of the overseers fly into his village and and they're having church and everything and he looked at otto he goes i thought you were making this a baptist church because they were loud it's like people say i thought you were making this a message church no i'm making this the church of god amen we're speaking of the living word tonight and so as she gets that true revelation he says of the true church of yourself what she is you are mrs jesus christ and what you stand for the word you will do the greater works you will overcome all these attitudes you will be able to pray for those who hate you and despitefully use you those are greater works amen and she will be an invincible army that's what the word will do for you hallelujah you will receive the revelation of the two spirits event that are in the church and you will be able to discern that and you will be able to withstand that not by no in the name of jesus christ the son of god satan i rebuked that attitude in the name of jesus because you already discerned it amen and so and satan will render will be rendered powerless remember remember does anybody remember where he is yes to the bride he is here to a church member see the church member oh i hope so i hope so the bride says lord god it is your word amen i know it is i have faith it is amen and satan will not have any dominion over me amen hallelujah you are mrs jesus christ and the gates of hell will not prevail against you tonight amen praise the lord jesus because you've been transformed amen so who whose are you anyway it says in john 3 29 he that half the bride is the bridegroom you are part of the bridegroom tonight you are part of that word tonight and so you have been put here tonight for the purpose to manifest your husband you have been put here with the purpose to let the light flash across the path of as many people as you can meet amen praise the lord that is your purpose see in john 9 4 5 jesus said i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world tonight as long as the bride of christ is still here the light is in the world this is the light we walk in the light as he is in the light and that's where we have fellowship tonight amen and this light then comes into you mrs jesus christ and you manifest your husband the word of god and as long as we are here then everyone can be saved in my mind hallelujah praise the lord amen you are here tonight reverent humble and in action because of the revelation of jesus christ your husband amen praise the lord that is the living word praise the lord jesus musician song leader amen i just want us to think on those things tonight amen i was not being negative i'm being truthful amen truth truth hurts i it makes you cry doesn't it because everybody can't have this amen i want everybody to have christ praise the lord so this is the word when the spirit gets into it this is the living word we worship him in spirit and in truth amen
