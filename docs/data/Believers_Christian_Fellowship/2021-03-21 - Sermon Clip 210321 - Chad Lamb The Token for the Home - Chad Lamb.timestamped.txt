[0:00] you understand what we have in this day
[0:04] the word interpreted we've got the
[0:05] perfect interpretation of the word with
[0:07] divine vindication
[0:08] we have the word interpreted the word
[0:11] interpret is the manifestation of the
[0:12] name
[0:13] amen and it didn't change the name the
[0:15] name is still jesus christ we still
[0:17] pronounce it the same
[0:18] amen but it doesn't have the same effect
[0:20] now it comes with the life with the full
[0:23] revelation
[0:24] because with the full word his name is
[0:26] in the word when we have the word for
[0:28] our season and for our day
[0:30] it brings the life with it and now when
[0:32] we say that name
[0:33] it has life behind it
[0:36] because the word interpreted is the
[0:39] manifestation of the name of god
[0:43] not that somehow we secretly get a new
[0:46] pronunciation
[0:48] and if you hold your mouth right and say
[0:50] it rest right and
[0:53] it's the same name that we've known all
[0:55] through the church ages amen
[0:56] but now he comes in the fuller it is the
[0:58] mighty god unveiled before us
[1:00] it is god who has taken the veil off the
[1:02] mystery of god is now revealed and the
[1:04] interpretation of the word
[1:06] is the manifestation of the name of god
[1:08] and now we've got something more than a
[1:09] pronunciation
[1:10] we've got an understanding we've got a
[1:12] knowing we have a personal knowledge of
[1:14] jesus christ he's been made personal to
[1:16] us
[1:18] he's revealed personally to us
[1:22] and the in the name is in the word
[1:25] see we're talking about the token is for
[1:26] the home amen when we go to our homes
[1:29] and establish our homes on the token
[1:31] it's not hocus pocus it's not
[1:33] incantation it's not enchantments amen
[1:36] it's not
[1:36] well i believe the message everything's
[1:37] fine no it's got you got to have
[1:40] this word you've got to have this life
[1:42] amen it's got to be on display
[1:44] there's got to be an application of this
[1:45] life and when it's on display
[1:47] then the death angel will pass it's got
[1:50] to be real it's got to be genuine
[1:52] it's got to be the reality of the
[1:54] message not a not
[1:56] an acknowledgement of the message and
[1:57] not not being friends with the message
[1:59] but
[2:00] it's got to actually the message has got
[2:02] to be alive inside of you
[2:05] because his name is in the word i mean
[2:08] there's all kinds of
[2:09] token words given and i believe brother
[2:11] there was a prophet i believe this and i
[2:13] believe that
[2:13] but there's absolutely no manifestation
[2:16] of the life and if there's no
[2:17] manifestation of the life
[2:18] there is no guard against the day of
[2:20] destruction friends but it's got to be
[2:23] an application of the life that is on
[2:26] display
