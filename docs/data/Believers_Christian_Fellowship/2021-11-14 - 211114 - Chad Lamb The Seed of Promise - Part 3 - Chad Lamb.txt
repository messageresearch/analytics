of gathering once again god as we've come lord to gather together and sing the songs of your praises god we pray that you would abide in the praises of your people lord god for we want to welcome you lord we want to give you first place and all we say and do that you might be glorified and honored in all we do god we come to your word now and we ask god that you would help us in the breaking of the bread that you would feed us lord and that we could take that portion that we have neither strengthen us lord by your word give us eyesight to see and give us strength for this journey for we love you lord may you always have preeminence among us may always find welcome in our midst for we welcome you now in jesus christ's name we pray amen and god bless you while we're standing let's turn to the book of galatians galatians chapter four we're going to continue on with the seed of promise this will be part three in that series and i just keep titling at that because i don't know what else to title it so that works for me the seed of promise part three and i just want to keep sharing with some of the things that we've been sharing they've been really really good i've been enjoying them very much i've been enjoying looking at these things again and so we want to spend some time there by the will of the lord galatians chapter 4 and verse 28. now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise praise be to god let's go back to galatians chapter 3. verse 16 now to abraham and his seed where the promise is made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ verse 28 there is there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus and if you be christ then you then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise amen god bless you you can have your seats so the thing that we don't ever want to forget is the first scripture we read that we brethren as isaac were are the children of promise because the the promise that was given to abraham was for abraham and his seed for his children and we are children of promise amen the children of promise so we don't ever want to forget that and i want to start by reading this quote we've been reading each time out of christ is the mystery of god revealed it says now you see the seals when he was in his mediator work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in that he came forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb so all that's in the book would be him amen and when we talk about the lamb's book of life and especially the section of the book of life which is the record of eternal life we're speaking of the very life of christ coming down through amen god's own life as it would be made manifest in each age the word of god the thought of god becoming the word of god the word of god becoming manifest in that day would be christ in each day so all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book so the book is his record that's why it's the lamb's book of life or the book of life of the lamb amen because it's his life coming down through amen so god had this in his thinking before the foundation of the world amen so god knew amen that he was going to display himself god had a plan and he had a desire and that desire was to be known and that desire was to be expressed and so for in order for god to be expressed he had a plan a way in which that he would express himself amen by bringing portions of himself down through time amen because the word is god so when god brings the word that's a portion of himself and when that word amen is made manifest amen in a day in a season that is christ are we seeing it amen this is what the prophet of god taught us amen we can't go back to old denominational thinking because that's where you get trinity uh doctrines and where you get all kinds of confusion amen because we go back to denominational thinking but when we come really what the prophet taught us he brought us back to the mind of god amen and in the mind of god was thoughts amen when thought and when those thoughts would come forth to expression it was word when that word would be made manifest in its season that's christ praise be to god you say well that's simple that is profound amen that's profoundly simple that explains the entire bible and explains the message to us amen so when we understand that we understand so many things that brother branham was trying to teach us and was trying to share with us amen i want to continue moving on in the message it is the rising of the sun says he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ oh brothers and sisters i absolutely love this message amen and without this without brother venom coming and correcting our understanding amen i don't even know how we can understand i mean the seals in the preaching past the seals how in the world can you understand 1965's ministry if you don't catch this concept amen that the word is god amen when when when the word come out from god god calls the word that come from his thought when it was birthed he calls that sun or offspring and that offspring as it comes into manifestation in each season is christ amen so what was the opening of the seals it wasn't ten sermons over eight days he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening the seals then revealing christ so what was the opening of the seals revealing christ that's why the the opening of the seals was such a monumental shift in the ministry of brother branham amen is when he actually came in to his revelations 10 ministry amen to reveal the mystery of god and the mystery of god is christ what was the revealing of the seals what was the opening of the seals it was revealing christ what christ was he revealing amen he was revealing christ of this entire bible that's why when he would come to the message christ is the mr god revealed he said i take from my context the entire bible because he's going to be preaching christ is the mystery of god revealed so there's been a mystery of god that he had in his thinking before the foundation of the world and that mystery of god was a plan in which he would display himself amen so that he could be expressed and be known and have fellowship with himself as a family and so there's a mystery that's been in this whole bible but christ is the mystery of god revealed so what is christ christ is the word amen that is manifest expressed may manifest in the day or season that is christ so christ the word made manifest in each season that is christ and christ the word made manifest or expressed or declared in each season is the mystery of god there's no brother man said there's nothing out of cater nothing's wrong amen everything from genesis to revelation is god becoming material so that he can be filled god coming into manifestation and as god was coming into manifestation that anointed word christ means the anointed that anointed word or attributes or expressions or thoughts however you want to put it that anointed word expressed in that day was christ that's why brother of him said it was christ in noah it was christ in moses it was christ in david the vessels were fallen vessels the vessels were clay i mean they were minerals that were gathered out of the earth formed into a vessel amen those vessels were fallen those vessels needed redemption those vessels were born in sin but there was a portion of life down inside of there in an expression that was coming through that vessel and the expression through moses was an expression of christ now when moses amen when moses was making mistakes he wasn't expressing christ he was expressing moses but when moses was expressing that portion of the word that had to be expressed in that day that was christ amen he was expressing christ so the confusing part down through the bible and down through time and the confusing part all around us and even of our own lives amen is this this part that was born in sin shaped in iniquity amen that expresses sometimes a fallen nature and fallen thoughts and all of these things and we looked at that and we say how can that be christ how could david be christ when david would murder a man commit adultery and murder a man to cover it up that part wasn't christ that part was fallen but when david amen would look over at jerusalem as a rejected king and then weep over jerusalem how oft i would have poverty he said that was that was not the man that was christ that was the word that was expressing when he was anointed to be king amen and then he was running amen as a fugitive from cave to cave rejected and that was christ being made manifest so we we have to understand there's been a mystery and christ is the mystery of god revealed what was the opening of the seals revealing christ revealing christ where revealing christ through the whole bible that's why brother branham would say when when the seals opened my bible became a new book to me because when we open the seals we reveal christ we reveal christ as the mystery of god christ is the mystery of god revealed which is the seventh seal which is revelation 10 7. so it's it's so profound yet so simple it's so complex as it weaves its way down through time but yet it's so simple it's it's unbelievable brother branham says in satan's eden from 1965 he's and so god knew that he would be here but then he put us in flesh so we would be contacted in order he could contact he became one of us when he became jesus christ the son of god himself the fullness of the manifestation of god therefore that was god's purpose to display his attributes in fellowship when i was in my father i knew nothing about it but when i became his son and was born of him i was an attribute a part of my father and you're a part of your father and as children of god we are part of god's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have fellowship one with the other as a family of god upon the earth and that was god's purpose at the beginning yes sir that's what god wanted at the beginning so what did god want god wanted he wanted i'll read it again as children of god we are part of god's attribute that was in him so you have something in you that was in him and that part in you that was in him is what makes you a son and a son is a part of god and a son a son is an offspring now you sisters don't get discouraged you're a son too we can call you daughter but really what sun means is offspring that's really when you get down to the core of the word a sun is offspring amen that which comes out amen and so the word of god came out from god that was sun that was offspring amen contained in that word and that logos was all the thought of god all the attributes of god so all the sons of god were in there and we'll say sons and daughters of god so that you know that those sons are male and female in their expression in this day but now that's the offspring of god and so that word as a whole amen is the son of god but as it comes down as individual thoughts i'll just say individual thoughts i don't know that god has individual thoughts i mean like we do god's thinking is whole he never lose any of his whole thinking when he thinks of the individual it's still in context of the whole god's thinking is not like our thinking amen so but we take one of those attributes let's say one of those thoughts one portion of that word amen and that portion of that word would come down amen it would rest in a soul amen that would be expressed in a body of flesh on the earth but because of the fall in the garden that flesh would come with corruption with the wrong nature with all of these things but there's still a thought of god an attribute of god a gene of god in that soul that's why in the old testament it could be god above us or god with us the holy ghost was there moving and the holy ghost was moving upon that seed that was in the soul but the holy ghost or the life of god could no longer dwell inside of that soul until the purging that took place at calvary but it could influence and move over and begin to move amen to the brood over and move all these positions into place and sort things out but after calvary now that life could come right in and quicken that seed to life and it could be the very life of christ the very life of god living in this tabernacle so as these expressions would be coming down through time amen there would be an expression of of the word amen a part of the word a piece off of god amen a portion of the attribute a portion of the thought if you just if we want to say it that way just for us to understand it amen and as that would come down and land in a vessel of clay when it would begin the holy ghost would begin to work the circumstances and brood over amen to get the action out of that individual that god wanted to express in that day when the action would come out when the words would be spoken and the deeds would be done that god had ordained for that portion of the word to express in that day that was christ amen so what god wanted in the beginning amen before the before the fallen his original thought what god wanted he wanted the uh i'll read it again and the children of god we are part of god's attribute that was in him that's how we're children because it's that part that came out of him that's offspring that's progeny that's son as children of god we are part of god's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have fellowship one with the other this is why fellowship is way more critical than you think because it's part of god's original purpose in the beginning that's why staying off to by ourselves and staying away and separating from fellowship and i've been hurt before and i'll just stay home and i'll just listen to tapes and i'll i'll do my own thing that was not god's original plan that's not god's thinking from the beginning amen no matter how many times you get your toes stepped on and you get hurt amen through fellowship you can't avoid fellowship because that was god's original plan he wants his sons expressions of himself to fellowship together as a family of god upon the earth that was his plan from the beginning so we better be expressing his thought amen why do we come together why do we meet in each other's homes why do we have fellowship around the word why do we care for one another because that's what god thought was in the beginning that's what he wanted that's the way he wanted to express himself as a family in flesh upon the earth expressing the attributes of god together in fellowship that's what we'll have in the new heavens and new earth in that city it'll be all those expressions collected together in that city and the shekinah glory of god the the intelligence the intellect the thought the illumination amen will be over that city and they'll be the whole it will be it'll be god made tangible flesh fellowshipping together as a family of god in that city that was god's original purpose and god's going to have that purpose and god already has a plan in his mind and we already know the end of the story and the end of the story is god will have his purpose on this earth he amen god is so good so every part of this we talk about new heavens and new earth and when we talk about the seed gene of god we talk about uh uh the the relationship between those outside of the city and in the city the book of life in the lamb's book it's all talking about the same thing there's a continuity in this word of god amen in the continuity of the word of god is to express god's desire god's thought which is to express himself or manifest himself in flesh on earth as a family having fellowship together that's what god's purpose was at the beginning yes sir that's what god wanted at the beginning i'm going to go to the smyrna church age out of the church age book and i want to read a portion of that it says now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos god was manifest in the sun and then jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many members spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth very important we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed as the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to quicken so that does not mean that those people are eternally lost and will be damned to hell it just means they do not have one of those attributes of god's thinking or gene of god in the soul but it doesn't mean there will not be mercy granted and salvation given at the white throne judgment to certain individuals but those individuals are not individuals who can be born again because only those with a sieging of god are individuals that can be born again and everybody with the seeding of god an individual that can be born again will go in the first resurrection in the rapture not in the second which comes up in the judgment it's clearly explained in the message he says hold this carefully in mind now take the next step redeemed means to buy back it restores to the original owner god by his death the shed blood bought back his own he bought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice word and they followed me you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there is no change in species as we were in the thoughts of god and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word i love that hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are the sons of god we heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodigal son save me o my father i'm returning to thee listen now brother branham expresses when when you come to the salvation when you hear the word and come to the new birth it's a restoring back your relationship to your father it says father i'm coming back amen say me my father i am returning to thee amen and so what so many times is labeled as getting saved under a denominational idea it means we're turning amen a chicken into an eagle we're turning a dog into our goat into a sheep but that is not what the prophet of god is teaching us and that is not what the scriptures say amen because jesus came to seek and to save that which was lost he came for the sheep that his father gave him amen those that he was coming for didn't know that they were sheep but he knew they were sheep and he wasn't coming for the whole world he was coming for his that were in the world all right now we're we're going to say some things it seems harsh but if you just would just be patient with me for a minute you'll realize amen that god the whole purpose of redemption was for god to redeem back himself his own his own what his own thoughts amen what are his thoughts it's not something secondary to him the word of god is not something secondary to god it is god it is the thought of god which would which god amen when he was all alone and there was nothing made that was made he was god alone with his thoughts amen and that thought as he would express it was the word amen and that word was god it was god expressed in another form all right and so that word now amen it it comes down into the purpose that he had for in each age and begins to manifest amen but but when that word comes down god knows before the foundation of the world that there will be a fall because jesus christ is the lamb slain from the before the foundation of the world so in god's mind he knew that there would be a plan of re he knew there would be a fall needing redemption needing a slain lamb that there would be redemption amen but god's plan of redemption oh i don't know how to say this god's plan of redemption was to redeem back himself that would come in this fallen condition so redemption is for the seed not for the non-seed but it doesn't mean that the non-seed don't benefit from redemption the non-seed can benefit from redemption but redemption is not necessarily for them amen redemption is for the seed because he's buying back himself he's buying back his own all right and so the non-seed can be a benefactor of that because when christ came and shed his blood amen he bought back all of creation he bought back the earth he bought back all he brought back every body that was made out of the earth everybody that had lived on the earth he purchased all of creation and as purchasing all of creation he now has the rights to all of the creation to do what he will with his own and so when he comes to the white throne judgment he is the one who paid the price his blood is the purchase price for all creation god sent that blood that created blood he sent it to shed for his seed that came in a fallen condition to buy back his own but he couldn't buy back his own the pearl of great price unless he bought the field he bought the field to get the treasure hidden in the field but he had to buy the field but he bought the field to get the treasure hid in the field if there was no treasure hid in the field why would he buy the field but he bought the field because he wanted the treasure hid in the field amen but now because he owns the field he can do whatever he wants with the field so when he comes to the white throne judgment he as the owner of it all can pass the judgment that he chooses he can have mercy on whom he would have mercy because his blood already paid for it amen his blood is already paid amen for this individual is this individual has also been redeemed back but he wasn't the focus of redemption redemption was for the elect so at the white throne judgment all of those that are paid for they don't all get to go into eternal life he owns it all but some because of the way they handled life when they come in contact with it will be refused entrant into eternal life they will go into the lake of fire there are those whose names were never on the book they were going to the lake of fire there's those whose names were on the book but they fought against the true word they will go into the lake of fire amen but they'll be those who were doing a work a support a help amen doing what they could with what they had and staying true to a portion that they had and being a help in the in the ministry and supporting or helping or doing good to the the word of god the elect of god jesus christ on that day will grant them entrance into eternal life why because he owns them and his blood already paid for them but that wasn't the purpose of the sheba the purpose of the shed blood was to bring the elect back to himself so to me this is amazing to me brother branham's teaching on the book of life and salvation is so much better than anything i've ever heard in christian teaching ever at anywhere at any time because in christian teaching all over everywhere at any time amen you have to have a certain confession and you have to have a certain lifestyle and you have to say certain words or attend a certain church or hold to a certain set of beliefs and if you do that then you can be saved and you can be in the new heavens and new earth but brother branham shows us the very nature of god that you see in the whole bible that there are those who are not a part of god amen are not sons of god but they will give an entrance into the kingdom of god amen because of what they did with the word as the word was moving down through and the word is life the word contains life the word is life so when you come in contact with the word you come in contact with life that's why at the white throne judgment i mean really at the white throne judgment is just a repeat of what happened on earth because at the white throne judgment you come and you stand before the word but while you were journeying on earth you had contact with the word at some point you stood before the word amen and when you when you stood before that word and you could serve it and you could love it and you could even if you didn't understand even if you only had a nugget but but you did what you could with that word amen you were that's how you were reacting to life that's how you were treating life or reacting to life or interacting with life amen but if you hated that manifestation of the word and you did evil and tried to shut it down or spoke evil against it or blasphemed it amen what you're doing is showing your attitude or conduct towards life so when you come at the white throne judgment and stand before the word which is christ and his bride and all the elect redeemed sitting on the throne you're once again standing before life and what you did with life is what will determine whether you go into life or not that's why i said the white throne judgment is just a repeat you're coming to face life again but you already faced it in your earthly journey so this message i just say is perfect it's perfect it's the bible it's the word it's christ it it contains i said this before but every doctrine that brother branham restored to us contained the very nature of god in the doctrine it wasn't an isolated teaching just a teaching on godhead or just a teaching on water baptism or the teaching on on the book of life amen you can't just take it as an isolated teaching and this is interesting and wow this is neat but it contained within it the very nature of god the nature of god of the bible amen that's why when we get into doctrinal debates and people want to start uh debating doctrine and debate doctrine with you know denominational individuals debate doctrine within the message however you want to debate doctrine the doctrine didn't come to give us something a tool for debate amen it didn't come to make us right it didn't come to make us theologians it came to restore back our understanding to align our thought with the thought of god so that we could express the very nature of god so when we get into doctrinal debates we instantly have got ourselves out of the nature of god because god doesn't debate about his word he doesn't argue he doesn't fuss he doesn't debate amen god doesn't use apologetics god just speaks his word and moves on it's four two it's four it's not four who is not four amen so the the doctrine that brother brennaman restored to teaching the correct teaching on the word amen when brother branham restores the word when god restores it through that vessel i should say it that way through the seventh angel amen it's going it's running that doctrine is running from genesis to revelation because it's a very it's the word and the word is running from genesis to revelation and the word contains the thought the thought contains the character so i want to finish this quote i'll go all the way back here you always were sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there is no change in species as we were in the thoughts of god and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we we are the sons of god i did read this but we'll read it again we heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodigal son say me o my father i'm returning to thee so the voice that we heard is the word the word that we heard in this day should give us an understanding of where we came from and where we're at and that we're returning back to the father amen the word that we're hearing for this day the correct teaching correct doctrine amen does not have us to be something else other than the father son who's hoping to come into somebody else's house to be adopted in a modern term of adoption but the right teaching the correct teaching amen from the bible teaches us that when we hear the word amen that is our father calling us and we as the prodigal son run back and say father i'm returning to thee i'm not just coming to thee that's a correct turn i'm coming to the lord that's correct but you have to remember i'm coming back to the lord where i came from i'm returning to thee praise be to god you understand how the correct teaching of the bible changes the entire concept and mindset and blows away denominational thinking already out of the shoe because denominational thinking will always have you wondering whether or not you are a son amen and if i could lose my sonship and hoping that i get accepted into this house because this is the right father i was born under the wrong father i'm hoping i can get him to promise to be my father and then then if i do something wrong maybe i'll have to go back to my original father or get cast out of the father's house but the correct biblical teaching has you so secure amen when you hear the word and the word is revealed to you and it's your father calling you and something inside of you response to that word amen it is an indication that you came from the same source that word came from and that's your father calling you why would your father call why would god play games with somebody who's not his child when he begins to reveal the word and you hear the word for your day amen and it triggers something inside of you and you see you find the matching piece amen and you run back and say father i'm returning unto you amen you realize that this call this eagle scream in this message amen was the thing that was to wake up the portion of me that came from god originally and when that portion quickens comes the life under the baptism of holy ghost i recognize who my father is i'm not a chicken i never was a chicken i wasn't a chicken hoping to become an eagle i've always from the very birth been an eagle i just was stuck in the wrong mindset i was earthbound and thought that i was a chicken but when i heard the eagle scream i realized that i've never been a goat i've always been a sheep and now i can cry my father i'm coming back to thee and when we catch the right concept of that friends it's not this i'm in one day out the next in one day out the next if i'm good enough i'll be accepted oh it blows all of that stuff out of the water and you recognize that the god came seeking me the father came calling me the egg eagle flew over the chicken yard where i was amen to call me back to where i belong and now if i misbehave as a sheep i'm a misbehaving sheep i can't go back to being a goat if i'm a sheep running with the goats i'm still a sheep if i'm an eagle who goes back in the chin yard and scratches it manure piled again i'm still an eagle i'm not going back to be a chicken no matter how many times i make mistakes or or the storms of life blow me back to the ground or or or whatever i'm never going to change species because i never changed in the first place what i was i always was if i'm a son of god i've always been a son of god i didn't become a son of god i was reborn because i was seed amen i did not become seed by rebirth i was reborn because i was seed so praise be to god let's go to romans chapter 8. the message did not come to bring insecurity the message did not come to make us wonder who we are and if we're really one of them if i could be bride that wasn't the purpose of the message if that's what the message is doing to us we need to go back and recheck what message we've heard and what our revelation is romans 8 verse 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us i hope i make it to my glorification i hope that i can just make it in the rapture i hope that i can hold on i hope that i don't fall away i hope i can make it listen that's the wrong revelation he has already glorified me he has already glorified me when in his thinking i know that's his thinking but i want to be really glorified his thoughts are eternal his thoughts are real that is the real reality this is the reflection the shadow that's the real and if i was glorified in the real and if i'm in the shadow and i don't look glorified it doesn't matter i've got to go back to the real and in the real i'm already glorified i'm just here dropped into this hickey of time so that i can act out what's already taken place in the mind of god so i'm moving in an act as if i'm not yet glorified so that we can play out the drama so that god can have expression so that he can complete all the things he wanted to do to express himself in time express himself in creation so we're acting it out as if we're not glorified yet but knowing i'm already glorified oh what we need is revelation friends more than anything we need revelation how are you going to miss it when it's already in the mind of god when he already saw it complete when it's a finished work when the period's at the end it's done it's unchangeable he finished it he sealed it amen when he unsealed it there was no there was no changes to the lamb's book of life to the elect seed the eternal life record amen he didn't change it it was already there if it was already there then it's finished for me amen we're in time manifesting what's already been finished amen in the sardisian church age from the church age book the prophet says now then the record of this wheat plant whose end is to reproduce the original seed in multiplied form is the book of life i repeat the history or the record of this wheat plant is the book of life which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life all right figure if you can pull up the white whiteboard i'm gonna i'm gonna draw this out like we've been drawing it out but he's saying this book of life is a record of the wheat plant but but in the wheat plant this was everything that it would take to bring the life to bring the original seed back to original form multiplied so in that process everything that was helping that and everything that it was moving through through each stage of the journey was recorded in the book of life but there's a record of eternal life the life of that seed as it's moving all the way through is the record of eternal life and brother bam calls it the record of eternal life a section of the book of life and many times he refers to it as the lamb's book of life now we know that the whole book is the lamb's book of life but for brother branham to explain this to us more often than not he calls the whole book the book of life and he calls the accession the section or the record of eternal life zoe life he calls that the lamb's book of life but here in the church age book he says a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life he goes on to say in the in the in the token message he says and any greek scholar knows that the word eternal life comes from the word zoe zoe which means god's own life that's right the only way that you ever can have life there is only one form of eternal life and that's god's own life in you then you have eternal life because he is the only eternal there is and we are the attributes of his thoughts before there was even a foundation of the world or anything all this is just his thinking and we're the display of his thoughts of what it was you get that i want to read that again and we and we are the attributes of his thoughts what are attributes of his thoughts word when that word is expressed in this day and season what is it it's christ amen that's why they could ask brother brandon brother branham could you be christ or could christ be you or something like that and question theirs he's uncomfortable reading the question but they think that he's jesus christ and he said to make me the person of jesus christ had to be antichrist but to say that christ is in me working through me now that's the truth so to make me the inhabitation of that full life and that full word that's wrong but to make me the habitation of a part of that life and a part of that word that's true and that is also christ so if that is christ to call that antichrist is wrong brother man said see how close it is it's just the difference of a razor's edge to say that that any individual is the full life of jesus christ that's antichrist but to say a portion of that life that was in jesus christ and a portion of that word that was in him when he went to calvary is in me that's truth and that's christ amen so you can't just reject one idea and go way over here when brother bam said when you reject this idea the truth is just over here it's not like this is wrong this is right this is wrong this is right so you have to be careful how you handle that amen that's why in the the message who is this melchizedek brother bam says god vindicates that's always been right god vindicates it to be true so plainly the predestinated is the only one that's considered in redemption did you get that let me say that again the predestination is the only one that's considered in redemption people might be making like think they are but the real redemption is those that are predestinated because their very word redeem means to bring back is that right the redeem is something to redeem anything is bring it back to its original place hallelujah so it's only the predestinated will be brought back because the others didn't come from there see bring back being eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thought of what you was only he wanted you he wanted me to stand in the pulpit say he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only came to the earth to serve his purpose is that right all right then after it's finished it's brought back in a glorified state it's matured and brought back again amen so the one that come from heaven i wonder who those are who are the ones that come in well jesus christ amen i'm part of that manifestation amen i'm part of that sun manifestation when god amen when god created his first son on earth he created adam and a flesh being adam was the son of god part of that son was the woman so when god when god portioned himself out into adam and then adam came a portion of the life of god and god brought it into flesh within that portion was the woman amen so when adam came and expressed on earth the woman was part of that right and she came into a further expression or adam i should say i say she did but adam came into a further expression of she it was adam forming into she a further expression of him so that's why when you when you look at jesus christ if you're the bride of jesus christ when christ came forth from the mind of god as the logos you have to be included in that when he come to earth in the form of flesh you have to be included in that when he was hanging at calvary to pay the price of the sins of the world you have to be included in that because that was the full measure of the word and if i'm a part of that measure if i'm a measure of that word then i had to be included wherever the fullness was so when the fullness was in the mind of god i had to be in the mind of god when the fullness moves into the logos the pillar of fire i have to be in the pillar of fire when that fullness moves in the flesh i have to be in that flesh amen so when when a clinker comes off of that logos and it comes down and it becomes the life of moses moses is expressing a part of that word a part of that thought an eternal attribute of god and as moses is expressing in his day it's christ and because because the portion of god that was in moses in the portion of god that is in me we're together in the thought of god and together in the logos then when any portion of that comes and expresses i'm there too now that portion that's to be me amen might not have been in that tabernacle of flesh but there listen there is a bond amen there is a i we should say it this way i don't know it's not the right term but i don't know any other term there is a spiritual genetic bond between all the attributes all the attributes carry the same dna of their father so within every one of your cells in your body is a full strand of dna that matches every other strand that's in every other cell in your body but when that cell is an action in your body and where it's placed in your body determines which part of that dna it expresses so if that cell happens to be in a hair follicle there's only a little portion of that full dna that's to be expressed and it's the portion of information that creates more hair at the base of your hair so all day long that little hair cell is reading the dna but it's only reading a small portion because that's the portion that that cell is supposed to uh to manifest in that day something happened to my hair follicle cells and they died just like when you're a baby amen you're growing there's something triggering the cells in your bones to grow grow grow grow grow grow grow but at some point it stops reading the growth portion of the dna and it quits reading that because now it's done it expressed what it was supposed to express but the the information the whole dna strand that's in the bone cell is the same dna that's in the hair follicle cell and they are in the same body and part of the same thing so they are genetically bound because they all have the same code the same dna in every cell in your body so also is the body of christ so when the when the hair follicle is making hair which is a really good thing for our barbers here in the church they pray for those hair follicle cells because it keeps growing you keep cutting they keep working they're working working all the time but they're to express a portion of this life of you but what is a hair follicle it's me what's it expressing it's expressing me what is uh uh i mean whatever you have cells all over your by skin cells you have skin cells just constantly making more skin as you have skin dye and flake off new skins coming up from underneath so you have cells in your skin that's making more skin they're not doing what the hair follicles doing they're doing what a cell does but it's got the same exact dna as a hair follicle because it's part of the same person part of the same thing but it's down here making skin so what is the hair follicle expressing me what is the skin uh what is the skin cell uh manifesting me it's all manifesting me it's my skin cell it's my skin it's me the cell and the hair follicle it's expressing me it's my cell it's me and they're all genetically bound by having the same exact information or word that links them all because there's only one word that makes me and that's a word that makes me different than you in the flesh amen and that is my dna that is the word that makes me and every part of me has the same word oh i hope this makes sense this is why brother branham could say amen it was christ and moses christ no but he said when when when they were crossing the red sea i was there amen i wasn't there in this physical being with these eyes and these hands and this earthly makeup amen but i am genetically bound to the dna as a seed gene of god i am i am fixed to them every gene of god comes from the same place is from the same material is part of the same thing so when they cross the red sea i crossed the red sea listen when my finger pushes the button on the elevator to go up then we all push the button my toes my legs my i didn't take my toes out of my shoes but when this part of my body pushed it we all pushed it and we all went up to the next floor this is the life of god coming down through manifesting in each age and it is christ boy i hope i can get to what i want to get to oh god is so good there's it's like there's never an end to this it just keeps going deeper in layers upon layers upon layers upon layers what god has done for us in the end time is he's peeled the layers off the confusion so that we can see the reality and so i want to just go back to this uh what brother branham was telling us about the wheat plant so the wheat grows up we've got leaves i can't remember what wheat looks like but at the end there's a torso and in here there's shuck all right all the seeds that are in that head they all come from the same seed they all carry the same seed dna in them they're all an expression of the one seed so brother branham tells us about he says the book of life the whole book of life when you look at it brother ben will say this is the book of life the whole plant but he points to this little seed in here and he says this is the record of eternal life he calls it lamb's book of life the record of the seed he calls it so many things and what he begins to tell us about the book of life now we're not going to talk about individual ages when he goes to this description we're not talking about luther's age specifically or wesley's age or all that we're just talking about a concept of an entire image one image in the image of a wheat plant now in this book of life let me go over here in this book of life all of this was necessary to get to this you had to have the stalk grow up you had to have the leaves come out because it requires photosynthesis to keep putting food in to keep growing and it requires all of this as it comes up but the goal was to get back to the seed amen and so all of this is working together in harmony to bring about the plan of the seed from the original to bring it up and to seed again right so when it gets up to harvest time amen these leaves here they begin to drop off and fade away drop off fight away the stock all turns brown the shock pulls away and as it pulls away some of it even falls off what's the shuck as it's pulling away from the seed begins to reject the seed it begins to separate itself from their seed and reject the seed and because it rejects the seed it is it is rejected from life it was part of the book of life because it was part of what was helping the seed come to maturity but because at some point it rejected the life of the seed it gets rejected from life and let's just say that these leaves you know they dry up they wither they fall off they fall away what are they doing when they fall away they're rejecting the life but this stalk right here all the way to harvest time it keeps holding the seed up it never moves away from the seed it never rejects the seed but it holds it there so that the seed can dry now it's not the seed now remember i'm not talking about each stage each stage had true life in each stage so as it was growing there was true life there but i'm talking about the whole picture now just look at the wheat plant as the whole picture now the the part that was used to help this seed grow when it comes to harvest time and it begins to dry up and fall away it is actually separating itself from the life it is rejecting the seed and as the shuck begins to open up and pull away it's rejecting the seed but the stalk is still holding the seed up so that the seed can stay in the presence of the sun so that the seed can get dry so that the seed can go to harvest so at harvest time amen the great combine will come along amen and it will take the seed into the garner and brother branham said there'll be a portion laid away for another purpose and the rest will be destroyed or burnt up all right and when we look at this another purpose when we come to the farmer this is the seed this is the reason he went through the whole process that's the reason he went through the entire process but god in his great thinking before the foundation of the world knew he put in place supports he put in place helps he put in place the three friends of lot that would come into confederation with him and help him go deliver or the three three friends of abraham i mean that would go with abraham to deliver law god put helps he put things in place amen that would help the seed come for his plan to come and and if that part that helps stays true to the life in the seed then it's laid aside for another purpose at the white throne judgment but if it ever pulls away or rejects the life that god was bringing back amen when it rejects that life it's rejected and it's burnt as the chaff so for us if you watch the combines go down the field and you have a wheat field the combine's going down the field and then all of a sudden you see at the top in the hopper all the wheat is piling up in the hopper amen but all the chaff and stuff is just getting shot out of the back of this combine amen and a lot of it's just blowing away a lot of the chaff and the dust and stuff is blowing away but that farmer will come back a few days later a few weeks later and he won't leave that straw laying there there's some value yet in that straw and that farmer will come back and bail that straw and use it for another purpose and because the straw was valuable to the life and never rejected the life it can have another purpose the other purpose is let's just put straw here so when we get to new heavens and new earth these are the ones who are outside the city and these are the ones i would say like this they are the city so that's why when god gives a judgment in the white throne judgment the judgment is matching what they did with life and the purpose that they served as the life was coming forth and if they serve that purpose without rejecting the life or turning away from it they're allowed to come in to a realm of eternal life not having eternal life because the only ones that have eternal life are the seed that's gathered to the garner the stalk doesn't already have eternal life amen it doesn't have what the seed has but it gets to go beyond time and have life beyond time and if you have life beyond time what kind of life is it because there's no more days there's no more months and there's no more time so they enter into eternal life they don't already have eternal life because if they had eternal life they would have the seed if they had the seed they'd have zoe life they had zoe life they'd be on the record of life or the lamb's book of life or the section in the book of life that's christ but they don't have that so they cannot be reborn so they don't have zoe life already so they must come up at the white throne judgment because they don't already have eternal life but at the white throne judgment based on how they did what they did with the life in their day determines if they get to go into eternal life or not so now the the stalk has a value has a purpose and so when when they were on earth it was a support to the life in some way it was a support to the life and because it supported the life in some way when you get the new heavens and new earth we talked about this several uh services ago when when you have the kings of the earth bring their honor and their glory into the city brother braham said they're bringing their tithes in their offering they're reaping the harvest from the land they're bringing tithe and offering into the city so what are they doing they are supporting the life of the city and because they support the life of the city they get to reach over and pluck off some leaves from the tree of life what is the tree of life the tree of life is bride and bridegroom restored back to one again the original tree of life from the garden of eden brought back in male and female through the process of time christ and his bride restored back in the city they are the tree of life brother branham said the believers are the leaves of the tree of life so because they bring their glory and honor into the city they get to pluck off a leaf and what is that it's life what is it it's an exchange what's being exchanged serving the life receiving life serving the life receiving life that's why the bible's written the way the bible's written that they bring their glory and honor into the city and they take the leaves for the healing of the nations why because they don't already have eternal life they receive perpetual life if i could just say it that way they receive perpetual life and in the new heavens and new earth is indicative of what they did to get that perpetual life and they keep doing it over and over and over again amen isn't god good this i'm telling you this these are not isolated doctrines these aren't neat cute doctrines they're not here to make us feel good this is the very nature of god the plan of god from before the foundation of the world and it is so perfectly expressed in the teaching that we have through this prophetic ministry that's why i said i said i don't know when i said i just said sometime that people start wanting to contradict the prophet of god and start to find faults with his birthday his birth record the way he told a story how many people fell off a bridge and all these other things once you catch the revelation of christ the mystery of god revealed and see the open book none of those things matter and i'm not saying it doesn't matter amen we believe everything the prophet said to be true but it doesn't matter to me if you can see a a conflict in an information if you can't get right date all of a sudden it's inconsequential to me because this is what i'm judging the message by not a record in a courthouse or an article in a newspaper or a a testimony or an eyewitness story none of that is basis for me to to receive this message this message is christ christ is the word so this and the message match perfectly they go like this so all of a sudden i'm no longer moved by a detail that doesn't match or some confusion in a record somewhere it doesn't matter to me because this record is perfect amen and when we saw the revelation of the unsealed book it was this book becoming unsealed and the message is christ the bible is christ the two come together and they paint a perfect picture of christ the doctrine is perfect here i'm just going to read a couple more quotes just to just to solidify what we're thinking about and then i want to get to the part that i've really been wanting to get to in the sardisian church age he said now let us go another step but before we do let us review our case thus far first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of god stands an election it was purposed in himself it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was foreknown and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her i'll take that i'll say amen i'll raise my hand and i'll stand in line for that that's who i identify with that's what i believe romans 4 8 blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of her members was written in a section of the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world secondly there is another class their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in this in the second resurrection such are the foolish virgins and the righteous as we're spoken of in matthew 25. in this case also are those who do not worship the beast or become involved in the antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the bride not having been born again they were in the bride they would have been born again because they're not in the bride they can't be born again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life so we see very clearly that in non-seed there's nothing to quicken to be born again means there had to be a seed gene of eternal life from before the foundation of the world i want to read this quote and kind of lock this into our minds all these believers is we could go on for hours all these were like a bunch of change out of your pocket in god's hands you pull out a bunch of change there's pennies nickels dimes quarters half dollars dollars all in coins now that's what the world is in god's hand you got that that's what the world is in god's hand there are some people that just can have a pennies worth of it and god can only use them in a penny way that's all they can buy don't reject them if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down he's not talking about bride now because bride can receive the real truth if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out and say they're not in it because god uses pennies sometimes lot was just a penny abraham was a silver dollar so it taken 100 lots to make an abraham and so will it take a hundred carnal believers will never stand in the presence of a genuine christian that's separated from the carnal things of the world living in christ jesus where the world where the word can flow through him he can only take a penny's worth that's all he's got so you see people that say i don't believe in healing i don't believe in those things just know it's a penny but just let him alone see just a penny's worth and so that's all he can buy don't stop him just let him alone remember that's just all the farther he can go joseph he was separated from his brethren he says yay i didn't mean that hardly in that way that i said it i mean it if we will all belong to this and that what what we believe it's just a penny go ahead see just a penny well the lord bless you my brother say well bless you my brother see he's a copper he can never be silver you see so just let it go ahead god can use him oh he is using it i'd rather see him down here in the church than to see him in a bar room standing there on the corner wouldn't you sure so just let it alone god can use it anyhow maybe not very much but he'll use what he can use as much as they'll let him use i like this quote brother branham said there's some they can't receive the real truth they're just a pennies worth he said but don't reject them because sometimes god uses a penny said lot was a penny abraham was a silver daughter but remember lot amen lot was saved because of his association with abraham because god remembered abraham and he delivered law out of sodom but remember too lot with only a penny's worth amen couldn't take the full revelation of abraham but with a penny's worth amen he ran out of sodomy he was saved out of sodom he got into a situation with his daughters and they both became pregnant amen and the oldest one had a son named moab moab amen was a nation that god used they meant to test the children of israel in the wilderness so was god using lot and there's also a very famous woman that came out of moab named ruth so was god using lot and god using moab yes just let it alone god will work it out just keep preaching the truth standing for the truth if somebody else only got a penny worth don't fight them the disciples came to jesus in luke chapter 9 and said and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbade him because he followeth not us and jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us oh my goodness amen god has such a broader understanding amen before the foundation of the world he had he knew amen that to move the seat along to move the program along he had other individuals in place that would move the program along there was a lot amen there was a lot that would move the program along never would he be the seed but he would move the program along and so brother ben's telling us leave it alone don't fight it i mean we don't have to be out there picketing every church in the world and stop preaching your fault they can only get a pennies worth let them have a pennies worth because god amen listen god uses uh uh let me just demonstrate it this way brother benham tells us about the souls under the altar and in the fifth seal souls under the altar are jews amen and they're jews from the time of christ on that never received christ but they held true to the portion of the word that they had and they were persecuted for it and gave their lives for it they will receive a white robe at the white throne judgment and entrance into eternal life at the white throne judgment here's what brother bim said about them he said these are not born again ones with eternal life as their possession they came up in the resurrection and received life because of their stand on the word and notice how these are crying out for vengeance they cannot be bride material the bride turns to cheek in christ forgive them father they know not what they do these are jews they have to be because they're in the seal and it's in the foreseal that the gentile bride is gone in the rapture so these jews aren't born of his spirit they don't even believe that jesus is the messiah but as they were blinded by god for the gentile sake god gave them eternal life on the grounds and and though they could not come to him yet they were truly faithful to all the word they knew and died for it as multitudes died under hitler stalin etc and yet will die so because they held true to the fortune because they could not come to god because god rejected them now brother branham told us in the church age book i won't be able to find it right now but very specifically he says it doesn't mean that not all israel wasn't on from the time of christ on wasn't on the record of eternal life or the lamb's book of life he said they were and came into the gentile church so those jews who were part of that eternal life they received christ and came into the gentile church some of those fought christ and fought the church and had their names removed from the book of life but there were those like gamaliel and nicodemus who supported and helped and their names remained on the book of life even though they weren't part of the record of eternal life because the park the part of the jews that were the record of eternal life would come into the gentile church according to the prophet so in god's mind remember the the book was sealed before the foundation of the world is that right so in god's mind he has always had 144 000 jews to redeem under the seventh trumpet at the end of time he's always had it in his mind these are part of the seed these are elect and predestinated all right from the time of christ on the true jews that that had their name in the eternal life record they would come into the gentile church up until the time 144 000. but you had to have jews that would stay true to the word they had because somebody had to keep believing keeping the word keep believing bring them back to israel because there has to be a nation of israel in the end time there has to be a jewish people there has to be the 144 thousand called out and when this group that would stay true and not reject not blasphemy not fight the bride they receive entrance into life they receive white robes why because god knew there was coming 144 thousand he blinded the nation of israel and turned to the gentiles those jews who were the remnant those jews who had their names in the lamb's book of life they would come into the gentile church but the jews who would stay true to the word and hold that word many jews didn't they became secular they became all kinds of stuff and they left the word but the ones who held true to the word god needed them to stay there as the stalk amen to hold the thing in place till he could come to time to reap the 144 thousand and because they stayed there like a stalk because they stayed there and stayed with what the portion they had they were blinded to the rest they could not see it god forbade that they would see it and would not open their eyes to see it and because he blinded them he's unjust and letting them stay with the portion they have if they'll stay as true as they can to the portion they had then god will give them life at the white throne judgment why it has to do with the seed because he's got to get the 144 thousand the same thing with the churches amen brother branham goes on the next paragraph he says it is the second resurrection where the five foolish virgins come up notice they were virgins they did not have the holy spirit so they missed being in the bride while the five wives who had oil became part of the bride but these people being a separate god-loving people and trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the lord will come up at the end of time and they will receive white robes at the white throne judgment what are they doing they're supporting they're holding true to the portion that the word they have as best they know and they're they're helping in the work of the lord how are they helping i don't know god will determine what kind of help they are but how many i mean how much how much freedom do we have now to spread the word because there's christian people in the land fighting for rights holding to what portion of truth that they have there's a group out there that is actually keeping keeping us preaching because there's not enough of us to keep the doors open there's such a minority if there was no christian nation if there was no christian people if there's no semblance of christian amen it would be very easy to come and shut the doors but god's had a voice going out for generations and generations and maybe some of those people are a help in the work of the lord by keeping the life moving forward by keeping a christian system in place that will allow the life to continue to move forward they never had it brother bam said they either never had a chance to hear the message or they sat in the meetings and it went over their heads or they were blinded by these false prophets they cannot fight the word they cannot come against the word that would make them antichrist but they either never heard it or went over their head or they were blinded by false prophets so when it comes to the white throne judgment brother man was always showing us the same thing he said then there's people amen who may never have even been christians going to a christian church but they've given life solely because they were good and kind and just to the brethren which are the elect of god that would support and help so anything that would support this life as it moved through and not fight against it can receive life at the white throne judgment everything that fights against this life to shut it down to blaspheme it to whatever it is stricken off the book of life and there's a great portion that never had their names on the book of life to begin with that's what brother branham says that's what the scripture says because all the world was deceived whose names were not found in them's book of so now we can see all of these categories we can see all of this coming up but when we realize i want to go back to a previous thought that that only the predestinated are considered in redemption so the whole plan the whole plan was for the seed of god to come forth and manifest in this day and season to express god that's the whole plan then anything else that god ordained to work with that plan and didn't fight against it it can receive life anything that was supposed to support it but rejected it will be rejected from life and now we understand the book of life it was all about the seed it was all about god's life coming forth that was the purpose of redemption that was the purpose of god's thought amen brother mum said in looking away looking unto jesus in 1964 that's the very reason that jesus was not understood when he came to earth if they would have only looked into the word of god instead of their tradition of that day they would have known that he was the son of god because the bible plainly declared his full coming and he come in full revelation of the word and each generation reveals him in the full revelation that's lotted for that time you get that wesley revealed him in the full revelation that was lauded for wesley's time not the full revelation the whole thing but the full revelation that was a lot of for luther's time for wesley's time for pentecostal time this and then it comes to this generation this generation must reveal jesus christ that's the revelation of him that's promised in the word must be revealed to this generation if the churches won't receive it somebody will rise up and do it because john said god is able to these stones to rise children unto abraham don't think to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for god is able to these stones to rise children to abraham for what god has said god is fully able to perform what he has promised to do our father abraham our father abraham realized that and against hope he believed in hope and staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god because god god made him the promise he has made us a promise for this day he has made us a promise and our promise today is just as sure to be revealed as it was to abraham for we are the children of abraham being dead in christ we are abraham's seed and heirs with him according to the promise so what is a manifestation in this day it's to manifest jesus christ in the full measure of jesus christ manifest in bride form now i want to come and look at something here as we wind down and finish i want to go back and draw this line that i've been working with okay so here we're just going to write the mind of god now you can never be all-inclusive in a picture of something you write but but we're just doing the best we can just to get a visual understanding this mind of god these are god's thoughts and in god's thoughts in god's thoughts he thought this whole plan and the whole plan that he was thinking was christ the mystery of god revealed that was the thought that was the original plan it was christ the mystery of god revealed and in that plan his thoughts what he thought of expressing and he thought of attributes made flesh upon the earth manifesting himself in fellowship as a family when he thought of that he was thinking of of each one that would come forth in their season and express a certain part of the manifestation and bring it all the way down to a full measure amen of jesus christ because he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world that would be the restoration of adam and then out of him would come the ingredients for his wife and then she would fall and then the restoration of the bride tree bringing it all the way back to a perfect union restoration back to the garden of eden god was thinking of all of this before the foundation of the world and he was thinking of this plan so that he could express himself express himself express himself so that when all these attributes come forth all these sons come forth they can have fellowship together as a family and they have fellowship because all the attributes understand god because god was expressed his nature who he was was expressed so in the mind of god when he had this thought this thought oh i'm just gonna do it like this i don't know any better way this thought became the book of life or it was it was the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world the lamb's book of life wasn't written after life come on the earth it was written before brother venom tells us this but we know uh i just quoted revelation 13 8 that all that dwell upon the earth shall worship and whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so this book of life is from before the foundation of the world brother bam tells us in the first seal it says you see the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world all right we're on the same page this book was planned and written before the foundation of the world this book the bible was really written before the foundational world this book the bible i thought it was the i i thought we were talking about the book of life the lamb's book of life we are brother brethren just interchanged it with the bible are they interchangeable yes so i i'm not even going to write anymore the lamb's book of life is the bible the bible is a revelation of the lamb's book of life that's why when the seals came off the book of life the seals came off the bible it's the record of christ the mystery of god revealed it's the record of the eternal life coming down through the ages it's the record of the uh the seed the seed coming back to seed it's the record of all of that and god had this in his thinking before the foundation of the world and and the reason i'm explaining this way is i really want to get away from the concept the idea of a piece of paper because realize if it's a piece of paper then then then the the mighty angel came down in revelations 10 with an open book in his hand and he gave that open book to john and john ate it john ate the book where's the book in john did john eat paper no john received the revelation from the back part of god's mind that's why he had to go forth and prophesy again what was he prophesying christ the mystery of god revealed because now he caught amen the revelation of this sealed book amen that's been manifesting the seal book's been manifesting itself all the way down through but there's always been a mystery associated with it it's been shrouded in understanding who's in and who's not who's included and who's not included and how are they saved and all these other things now at the end of time the seals are taken off the book the mighty angel comes down with an open book in his hand and john takes and eats it john wasn't eating pieces of paper he was eating a spiritual revelation of what was contained in that book because i've eaten the same book but i ate the book and there's no less book for you to eat so we understand that this revelation is a book of symbols amen and so we get caught up as and you know we get caught up in ideas but remember the symbols are just to help us understand something we don't want to get fixated on a symbol that where if i get to heaven and i don't see a giant scroll with a huge less than names and that scroll rolls down and down the floor and off the clouds of heaven and down across the earth with all these names that are written in it i'm going to be like this isn't right do you understand what i'm saying god wrote this book before the foundation of the world that means god wrote this book before he made paper before he had animal skins are we understanding now brother brenham said let's not be children let's be full-grown adults let's be the bride of jesus christ this lamb's book of life was the original thought god had of how he was going to express himself and become a family upon the earth which is christ and mystery that was the mystery of god islam's book of life he knew how he was going to do it he knew who would help he knew who would receive a reward for helping he knew who would fight against it he knew who he would raise up who didn't even have their name in the book of life who he would raise up like pharaoh to fight against it so he can get glory from him he had a plan and that plan was so he could express himself and when we come down that expression began to manifest and when it come down to adam the book came to adam because brother branham tells us adam lost the title deed of redemption so that means adam had the book so the prophet tells us how did adam have the book was he walking around in the garden this eve try one of these these are really good oh i'm sorry i'll put it over here no it's a little higher here hold my book brother bram told us adam had the title deed but he lost it in the fall when it went back to the hands of god and there we find it in revelation chapter 5. it wasn't this that he was carrying what he was carrying was the mystery of the plan of god which was in adam because if adam would have reproduced the correct way he would have brought forth another seed of god he would have brought forth christ what was it it was the lamb's book of life in adam the mystery it was still a sealed book remember the seals don't open till the end of time it was still a sealed book right and it was still sealed but adam had the sealed book he had the title deed of all redemption the lamb's book of life he adam had it amen but adam lost it when he fell because when adam fell he fell by hybridization and now not every product was going to be a child of god a sea gene of god so that book had to go bad because he lost the mystery because if he would have come forth if he would have produced a son the right way amen that son would have been christ and his name would have probably been seth or abel and then the next one probably would have been seth and one of them would have been chad understand it would have been the eternal life record coming forth coming forth coming forth but that book was sealed there was a mystery about that book adam had it but when adam when adam come into a hybrid condition and adam used sexual desire for reproduction amen all of a sudden that book goes back to god so it wasn't adam walking around with the book the mystery was in adam but we know adam had to fall he had to lose the title deed i mean he could no longer be a god over the earth it had to fall into ruin because it had to produce all of these things and there was other names to be expressed in the book of life and we understand all of that so now now the book goes back to god but guess what god doesn't want this book god gave the book to man because god wants this mystery he wants himself to be expressed in flesh upon the earth as a family in fellowship so god's desire is not to hold the book this book is this book is his attributes coming forth this book is himself becoming tangible this book is him moving through mankind moving into flesh so that he could be filled this book is the plan of god coming as a mini-member body and coming as his own son and coming as his son's wife uniting the two back together in fellowship so that god could commune with his family upon the earth that's the book friends that's the mystery of the book amen that's what the book was written for and god had it was a mystery and all down through it was it was mysterious and who's included and who's not and how are they saved and how are they not saved are they rejected are they accepted are they how how could how how could job be saved before the law amen because the law was to bring them into perfection how could job be saved before the law amen how could abraham receive the promise before circumcision but yet now without circumcision you're outside the promise because god is moving himself down in manifestation and unlocking and unfolding and revealing more and more of the mystery that's in the book when we come to calvary when jesus christ was here he was the book because he is the book all of the book was in him it was still a mystery he was the revelation of the mystery of the old testament so the mystery of this well the mystery of this was here and the book was in him is that right how do you know the book was in him because brother man said i was in him and i'm in that book the book was in him and he was dying amen and shedding his blood to redeem back the names that were in that book and now we come to the end of time and in the seventh age there comes a prophet on the scene and now christ is going to open this book and he is going to bring the book down christ because christ is the book and he's the seals that was revealed that's why when you have the open book you have christ that's why to say that the seals are to say that the seals are open and christ hasn't come is the misunderstanding what the seals were and what the book is the book is christ it's the record of christ christ is the book he is those seals and what are the believers the word in the book so when the revelation of the book come down that's why when the book come down the full life of christ come down because they're one and the same so now the the the book has come down in the hands of the angel in revelation chapter 10 and the book's been opened amen because now brother branham can come and he can preach the seals and preach christ as the mystery of god revealed christ is the mystery god revealed is the open book and so now he's talking about the great plan that god had one thing he wanted to achieve one goal that he had and everything in the bible has been pointing to this one achievement and so now the lamb's book of life is opened by the lamb he's the only one that's worthy to open it he's the only one that can open it and john when he sees the cry come at the end of time after the church ages he hears a cry says who will come and open the book and nobody's found worthy and john begins to weep because john realizes if nobody's worthy everything in that book is lost and john knew he was in that book and john realizes everything all of creation and everything in that book is lost if nobody can come and take four take take the book amen that's why you and i and we stand here at the end of time amen the seventh angel's already been here he's already come and gone and this book has to be open and the seals have to be revealed at the time of that seventh angel and if that book was not open and christ did not come down with the open book during the life of william branham amen then everything is lost it is our only hope amen but this is why we shouldn't be weeping like john amen because we saw him come forth and take the book and open the seals and we understood it one night after another after another after another when he would come and bring the revelation to those seals what was it the lamb opening the book what was opening the book revealing the seals what was revealing the seals revealing christ amen and because of that we should be like john amen all heaven and all on earth and all under there heard me rejoicing amen saying worthy and honor and praise be unto him that sitteth on the throne he come and he took the book amen so when he took the book brother bam uses all kinds of terminology tore off the seals he threw them down through the seven church mister he gave him to the to the to the bride to the church uh he come down with open book and there's all ways to describe this but it's all one in the self same thing amen if you get the open book you get christ if there's no more seals on the book then christ is here in full measure what was keeping christ from the people what was keeping christ from the people was the denominational change that had the holy ghost bound for nearly 2 000 years but in the evening time is loose by the evening time message the holy ghost back in the people again what's the holy ghost the life of that word the life that was in christ amen now coming back into the church when's it coming back into the church at the opening of the seals because at the opening of the seals is the fullness of christ unveiled here presence and then the voice from heaven tells john go and take that book out of the hand of the angel and eat it all john ate all the book but there's still all of the book left for you to eat i want to eat all the book but if i eat all the book there's still book left over for you what kind of book is this this book is christ what's eating the book amen eating the book is receiving the revelation of christ feeding on the body word of the son of man eating the manna that came down from heaven eating the book is receiving christ and that's why john would now go and prophesy again amen why what is the spirit of prophecy according to revelation the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of jesus christ and christ is the mystery of god revealed who has that testimony the bride because she's eaten the book and now the book that was in god's mind amen the book that adam was carrying that adam lost and went back to god that god's been holding when adam was carrying it it was sealed right is that right that book now came and became flesh in christ jesus and that book was sealed so the book has been on earth before the book was on earth in adam the book was on earth in christ but both times that book was sealed but the end time is the first time that that book's coming back to earth only this time that book's not sealed now who's redeemed who's included redemption who's in the wreck of eternal life who gets life at the white throne judgment what god has been doing all down through god's threefold purpose how he's been unfolding it through time it's all unsealed the book is now here and it's come back there was a restored adam who had the book but when adam was restored it was a sealed book hey but now when it's time for the manifestation of the bride to come forth now that last adam is going to open the seals and give him to his bride amen and now they're coming back together as one she's taking the book inside of her and now the book is in her because the word is in the bride you see for 50 years we're thinking about book where's the book the books we don't even understand what the book is the book is christ it's the very plan of god to manifest himself and become tangible in the earth and come into fellowship as a family that's the book it was in adam adam lost it because of the fall it was in christ christ redeemed it back but it was still a sealed book but he said the book was in the hand of god christ has been sitting in the hand of god christ is the book he is the word man manifest he is the unsealed word it's christ and that book has returned back to earth again and that book is to be eaten by a select group of people who can go to the angel and say give me the book how is it that you can go to the angel and say give me the book because under abraham's covenant i'm an heir of the world amen is that what paul tells us he tells us that under abraham's covenant i'm an heir of the world and i'm a joint heir with christ and that's the title deed of redemption that was redeemed back from me by my husband but i was also part of that redemption because i was there and now i'm a joint heir with christ and now in this manifestation i can go to the angels and say give me that book give me the revelation open my eyes let me see let me feed on you my husband let me take you in all of you into me and now the book that's been moving so much all the way through from the mind of god to adam from adam back to god manifesting christ christ going back to the right hand of the father coming all the way down through till it's time for the lamb to open the book and loose the seals and now a book that has been sealed in god's mind all the way down through is now an unsealed book to you and i and god is asking us to eat this and book prophesy again what is you oh what are we going to prophesy the spirit of prophecy the testimony of jesus christ amen let's all stand i've got so many quotes and so many scriptures that i just didn't read but i'm going to read this last one as the musicians come let's go to isaiah 55. i hope this revelation is setting your heart on fire i hope it's causing us to realize who we are and how secure we are what day that we actually live in will there be another age no there won't be another age there's nothing left we're here remember remember when when abraham was given the promise abraham was given the promise this is your land he said this is all your land i have given it to you that was now all abraham's land is that right so that belonged to abraham it was all his and he said walk in it walk in the land and see it he could see it he could walk in it he could live in it it was all his but when he needed a place to bury his wife he had to go and buy a cave because although god had given it to him in the dispensation time and manifestation he did not come fully into his possession that'll happen in the exodus journey when they return and drive out the inhabitants so it was his land god gave it to him and said i've given this to you and to your seed forever that was abraham's land abraham's property but in the dispensation of time abraham would have to pay money to buy a cave to bury his wives but when his seed would come in later amen it was theirs because god had given to them now because god told them to they can drive out the inhabitants and they don't have to pay anything for that cave that's why this land has been restored to us everything has been given back to us it's all ours i am already glorified i've been chosen i've been called i've been sanctified i am already glorified i am already raptured i have been resurrected from dead denomination i have been caught up to meet him i've been seated in heavenly places in christ jesus for over 2000 years or almost 2 000 years but in the dispensation of time god's allowing us to act out the final scenes of the drama we're not able just to go and take it yet amen materially it's coming it's coming it's coming but and spiritually it's all ours amen we're walking in the land we're seeing it amen can you see it and can you walk in it can you see the full redemption and the full blessing the restored back to eden can you see the full word coming back can you see it can you touch it can you camp by the river can you smell the fresh air and can you know that it's all yours abraham didn't doubt it was his even when he had to pay money he just knew he was waiting for the rest of the story to unfold on earth but it was already his and when we go through the things we go through it doesn't change anything about the promise it doesn't change anything about the reality we've become heirs of the whole world joint heirs with christ christ is here among us this bride is the manifestation of jesus christ on this earth in full measure she has eaten the book and she is called to prophesy again if you've got to pay for a cave or a broke down car it don't matter walk in the land and see it for it's all been given to us we should be happy people we're just waiting for god to finish the manifestation as he wants to finish the manifestation but it's already our possession we're already walking in it let's read isaiah 55 and verse 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it god sent out his word from his mind and that word's been coming down and that word come out of god his mind the logos and the logos come out and there's been a manifestation down through time and the book has been traveling down amen the revealing of that what the contents of that book has been traveling down amen but it won't be too much longer until all the word will return to him but it will not return void for all the word that came from him will accomplish the purpose that he sent it out for and that's why you and i are here to accomplish the purpose he sent us out for and we come from heaven to serve god's purpose and we will go back victorious because it was sealed in his mind before the foundation of the world nobody could change it you say it was a sealed book listen these are all terms and symbology for understanding what it means in a sealed book it was immutable unchangeable the mind of god that nobody could get into and tamper with it was sealed in the mind of god but it wasn't sealed away from the thinking of god it was sealing the mind of god and nobody could get this book because nobody could take the seals off only the lamb and he took the seals off and gave the book to john and now the book that was sealed in the mind of god that nobody could see nobody could touch nobody could understand that book is now in a people on this earth that should make us happy amen let's bow our heads lord jesus we thank you for your word god it means so much to us and i just pray lord that you would just make us correct in our understanding nor we use terms they're human terms we use analogies they're just human analogies none of them can properly fit but god i pray by revelation that you make everything properly fit lord that you would reveal it to us correctly then we'd understand and your people would understand exactly what you're trying to say in this hour and may we be a happy people rejoicing in what you've done lord and we recognize what that lamb's book of life is and what it contains and why what it is you're doing and how wonderful it is lord god we thank you so much we ask god that you would bless us as we walk in this life may we accomplish the purpose you sent us out for to accomplish for we will lord we will because you promised you will your word will not return void and i believe there's a portion of your word living in me and i know it will not return void help me god to surrender to that lord help me to give up all my life and all my thinking and make it help me make a full surrender lord a fresh consecration that i might give you a greater preeminence than ever so it's all about you and it's all about your plan and it's all about your purpose help me to stay focused on that lord i want to give you more i want less of me and more of you i pray you help me father help your people bless us as we walk in this world may the light of the gospel shine and may we recognize that you've got a plan and you've got a purpose and you know where everybody belongs and where they fit into the kingdom and help us to avoid lord the the urge to cut out and set aside and reject but help us just to walk the life you've given us to walk and trust that you know who's who and how you're going to sort it all out for god we thank you because your plan is perfect have your way with us as we go we pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless
