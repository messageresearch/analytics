TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hallelujah what a wonderful place to be brothers and sisters so happy to be here this morning and so blessed just to be part of the worship and come together and bring our licks of fire together and unite ourselves for one thing and that's to worship him and that's to hear his word man it matters more to us than anything we should be getting to the place moving as as we near the going away it should be that this earth has less and less and less a hold on us one day it's going to lose gravitational hold on us every atom in my body is going to change and i'm going to be a new creation and i'm going to fly away and as we near that time let every grip be loosened let everything lose its hold as we near and come closer and closer to that time brothers and sisters we're at the time we're at the moment amen this is the greatest time oh hallelujah how many attributes of god would have loved to have been born this day and live out this part of the word amen but it's fallen our lot and it's our privilege and it's our opportunity and i don't want to waste one moment i want to be here fully engaged in what my purpose is on this planet hallelujah it's not to serve some company not to serve some man not to build houses and buy cars those are all side things that we do but i've got one purpose and one purpose only and that's to be the reflection of jesus christ amen to be a living word amen a living oracle of god so that others can see that the word is alive today hallelujah if there's anything in our lives that hinder that it's evil let it fall away oh god cast it off of me my father because i want to serve your purpose and your purpose only hallelujah god is good amen hallelujah my heart is full to overflowing all we want is his word we want to live his life we want him to have his way let's just take our bibles and turn to saint luke chapter 24 and i can tell you i've been tore up for days and days coming to this god has really been stirring in my heart and and it's hard to grab grab a hold of this thing and bring it into a way that's concise and direct because i feel like that god is opening the whole bible on a whole other level you know and before i felt like you know i would read the bible and before i come to the message i would read and it would just be one-dimensional it would just be print ink on paper you know and i'd read it and i would love it because it's the bible but that's as deep as it went and then i got into the message and it went two-dimensional you know and i began to see it come alive and then it become three-dimensional now it's all around me but oh my goodness it feels like now i've entered into the bible and i'm standing in the pages and i'm walking back and forth and it's all a reality today it's all around us and it's all happening now oh hallelujah what a blessed time this is to be a believer if you're still back on ink on paper i say god i say repent and say god open my eyes come i come to you for i sav and wash the scales out of my eyes so there's more than ink on paper that this is a living word and i can see the revelation of jesus christ in the whole word hallelujah let's i think we should pray let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this day god i come with a full heart lord and a full surrender god i don't even know how to say what's on my heart i don't even know how to preach lord what what what is burning inside of me but god all i can do is lay myself down here lord and i pray that you would pick up your instrument lord and begin to use it for your glory speak through lips of clay lord move the man out of the way move the humanness and the human element to the side and i pray that you would come in the power of your holy spirit and you would minister your eternal word lord open this book to us all over again god and we might see it with greater depths with greater clarity that we might climb to higher heights than we've ever been to before lord because we know you have to bring a greater faith that comes with by a greater revelation to bring about a rapture lord and we are yielding ourselves to it we're looking for it with anticipation and we pray that you would have your way in this place lord god we give you glory we give you preeminence and we ask all that you and you alone would move on us this morning in jesus christ's name we pray amen look at luke chapter 24 verse 13. and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three score furlongs and they talked together all these things which had happened we know what had happened they had seen they had walked with the lord they had heard the ministry of jesus christ and they had seen him taken and arrested and beaten and crucified and laid in a tomb and and now that they're walking down the road and they're talking about the things that had happened amen and it came to pass that while they commune together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad and the one of them whose name was cleopas answered answered said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished when when we're early at the sepulcher and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken it wasn't that they didn't believe some of the prophets it wasn't that they weren't believing the word but he condemned them because their eyes were holding they could not see all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures the things concerning himself hallelujah and they drew nyan to the village whether they went and made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another didn't on our heart burn within us as he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures hallelujah you can have your seats so this is a an interesting story we all know it we've heard it many many times but i don't want to breeze over it i don't want to miss the lesson that's in this road to emmaus because here they had walked with the lord they had seen the miracles they had heard his ministry they had they had done all of these things and now they they see the fulfillment of everything that was promised in the bible he was taken he was rejected he was slain amen he he was he was uh uh he was uh um killed he was he was uh stoned in the into the prison house of a grave and he was resurrected again and here they had witnessed with their eyes the fulfillment of scriptures and didn't even know that these were scriptures being fulfilled because in their heart was clouded with doubt their heart had not come to this revelation to where that they could see all the scriptures correctly they were seeing scriptures they were believing scriptures they even believed unto jesus and they didn't believe scriptures about the son of god they were believing these things but when they come to the time to the hour when everything was going to be fulfilled when all that was spoken of him was going to be come to pass then they missed it they had walked with him they had talked with him they had slept with him they had heard him preaching they had done all these things but when they come to the moment when they come to the fulfillment of so many scriptures all at one time when it all got bundled into one package at the at his capture crucifixion and resurrection they missed it and then in his mercy he comes and begins to speak to them and they don't even know who it is and they're talking about him and they're saying you know don't you know what's happened we're concerning jesus of nazareth a mighty prophet and they said you know and he's standing there talking to him the resurrected lord and he's more than a mighty prophet he's more than what they can see him as more is happening than what they even realized and the whole time he was with him it was so much more than what they realized and now he's here and he's talking to them and they're starting to tell you know even these women they saw a vision of angels well i tell you they saw no vision of angels they saw angels but here they are caught in unbelief in a trap of unbelief and now they're using their minds they're using human reasoning and they're trying to make sense of the situation that they're in and this is the very problem that we find ourselves in over and over and over again because there's one solution and only one solution for the condition that they were in and jesus brought them the solution he said oh fools hallelujah i thought he was the one who told us to call no man a fool he comes down and he says oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the scriptures have said hallelujah there was a solution there was an answer everything was running right on course everything was according to the word of god but their eyes were holding that they could not see him and if they had believed the scriptures they would be rejoicing at this hour amen if they had seen the word they would not be mourning walking to the road to emmaus they would be skipping all the way there shouting and saying hallelujah the redeemer has come the price has been paid we're free from the bondage amen we're free from these bodies of sin we're free from the corruption that is set in but they missed it because they missed the scriptures hallelujah they had seen the ministry of the son of man but they had missed the scriptures hallelujah the same thing could be happening today we could see the ministry of the son of man and miss the scriptures because we have to believe all that the scriptures have said hallelujah brother branham didn't come to bring us anything outside of this word but the message of the hour came to illuminate the scriptures amen they come to point us back to the original faith of the pentecostal fathers amen not to original mind understanding not to original doctrines but to original faith because everything in this book is based off faith amen and so the prophet of god came on the scene and he begins pulling things out of the scriptures amen and we're seeing the miracles and we're seeing the discernment we're seeing all this stuff but how many times have we missed the scriptures we see the day we live in and how many times have we missed the scriptures and then we go to use our mind and come up with reasoning and this is this way because of this reason and i think i ought to do this and the best solution for my problem i believe would be to do this or do that and i say fools and slow of heart to believe because the answer is in the scriptures not human reasoning and so so they're here stuck in this trying to talk about they're talking about what's happened what are they doing talking about it they're trying to understand what's happened why is he now gone we thought surely he was the one that would deliver israel and he had just delivered israel hallelujah and then they're they're talking what is this with these sisters that have gone and seen a vision of angels what do you suppose they saw and and they're not even they're not even reciting what the angel said because they're not even convinced that it was angels it must have been a vision of angels and so now they're caught in this human reasoning trying to by their mind decipher what's been happening to them and and why we're in this situation and what should we do and it's not what i thought it's not happening the way i thought it would happen i don't understand the circumstances we're in i'm not clear what's happening and jesus shows up on the scene and he's standing there talking to them but because they don't see the scriptures they're not looking for him because they don't know the word they're not even looking for him because their mind is on portions of the word but they don't see the whole word and so now when he shows up to come and walk with them on their road to emmaus they don't even know this is the lord and what has blinded them their failure to know the scriptures hallelujah hallelujah his old fools and slow of heart to believe all the prophets have spoken not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets oh he didn't just take him to a few key verses he didn't just show them a couple of things he was showing them the entire bible at that time right what was the bible the law and the prophets the law and the prophets you heard them say all the time does not the law and the prophets say what is the law and the prophets it's the entire bible that they had at this time so jesus begins at moses what is moses the beginning and he goes to moses all the way through their bible from the beginning to the end and he just explains himself this is the revelation of jesus christ he's right here giving them the book of revelation amen hallelujah and he's explaining on the road to emmaus he's condemning them he's challenging them because they've missed the scriptures and beginning at moses amen and all the prophets you say really i mean did he really what about haggai i mean that's like that long you know i mean what did he find there all the prophets hallelujah he began to he began to show them the scriptures concerning himself now listen in the beginning he said verse 27 and and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures the things concerning himself i tell you all the prophets and all the scriptures concerned himself amen what is this book what is this that we read all the all the prophets all the psalms all the proverbs all the gospels all the epistles it is all concerning him hallelujah hallelujah brother branham said in the statue of a perfect man he said last night i preached on the key and the key is faith and faith holds the key and the key is the scripture and christ is the door so faith takes the little hinges of the scripture and unlocks the glories and the good of god out to his people so it's faith holds the key that unlocks christ to the people unlocks it and reveals it brother venom said we see him by faith we believe by faith but faith must be based on something he said faith is just not laying out there on nothing with no foundation but our faith is anchored and attached to something and it's attached to this word this is what our faith is attached to and when we can find it in the word and it's quickened by faith in our heart then we can have whatsoever we ask for hallelujah brother branham said in the message revelation chapter 5 he said now this book has was sealed with seven seals it was the bible and it was sealed with seven seals and brother brahm talks about this again in in the seven in the message the seven seals when he's preaching the seven seals he says uh he says now this book of redemption is the bible and we find it the whole revelation of it is wound up in these seven seals he said they sealed the mystery of the whole book so when brother branham comes along and now god calls him to come back after being caught up in a constellation of angels comes back to preach the seven seal mystery he's preaching to seven thunders which is the thing that was not even written out when when john heard it he began to write it out remember we preached this the sunday before i left john began to write it out when john saw the lamb take the book and open the seals john saw what it was and he wrote it out white horse and a bow in his hand crown was given to him he's writing it out and now he comes over for the time of the revelation in revelations 10 to reveal the mysteries or the mystery of the symbols he was going to get the the mystery of what those symbols meant what is a white horse what is the bow what is the crown and it's given in seven thunders and john hears it and john knows it and john's about to write it down and the angel says seal up those things that were written until the time of the end same thing daniel saw but daniel was told to seal it up to the time of the end then at the time of the end there come a prophet on the scene and he preached those seven thunders that john saw and didn't write what were those seven thunders he said this whole bible is sealed up with them seven seals so when brother branham comes and god through him is preaching the seven seals he is preaching the entire bible well you said well he didn't read every verse i mean he didn't read the whole thing that would have taken him three weeks four weeks five weeks not one week he preached the mystery of the whole bible it was locked in a mystery away from the understanding of man and that mystery was wound up in them seven seals and at the unveiling of them seven seals the mystery of god was finished what is the mystery of god this is the mystery of god not just this it's so much more but the mystery of god is written out here in 66 books in the bible amen but it was hidden from her eyes it was withholding our eyes were withholding to where we could not see the whole redemption plan we could not see all the things that we now see and understand amen but when the seals came off of that book he's revealing the whole bible that's why brother branham before he gets to the seals he's talking about when we get to the seals when we get to them seals when we get to the seals after he preaches the seals he's always pointing back them seals back in them seals what's he talking about the seals unlocked something there was something locked up there that was unlocked and now what is it it's the mystery of god it's the full revelation of the full word is known in the seven seals i think we need to pay a little more attention to the seals now i want to i want to take just one aspect of this and look at just one small part because this is something i want to labor on for a long time and i'm hoping the lord will just keep opening things up to me so that we can keep going down this path so please be praying be praying for us but i really want to take one one slice and one snapshot and i really want the ministering brothers very carefully to pay attention to what i'm saying because i i want you to help me break this down to the people and i want to take just one sliver and look at that and then we'll keep looking at other things but i want to look at the seventh seal revealed in the sixth because six reveals the seventh all through the bible and and i don't want to send you for a loop just hear what i'm saying we're going to look at this and we're going to find it in the scriptures but the sixth reveals the seventh every time amen brother branham in the fifth seal he's referring back to sir is this the time is what he calls it it's it's labeled is this the sign of the in sir and he's talking about this message and in this message he's he's had six people come to him and give him dreams right in a row he said with nothing in between and all these dreams are speaking the same thing they're all talking about the same thing and it all has to do with the opening of the seals and so he gets these six dreams and then he says then i'm in my room that day and there's a vision amen and then he's reminded of what he must do he must go back because there was a vision that laid before that told him when these things happen when they go to the tear out your stone fence when these things happen go west for the revealing of the seven seals so now he says in the fifth seal he's referring to that he said if you just know what happened what happened before we left here you understand why six straight dreams come exactly with the vision amen amen and then in the sir in the sign of is this the sign of the answer he said six straight dreams and then the vision capped it so he's always talking about this pyramid right because his brother branham's got this vision and he's never getting away from it he says six straight dreams and then the vision captain so we find out that the six were revealing the seventh because the six dreams were revealing the seventh they were telling him what's going to be the capstone it's the capstone of his ministry it's the seven thunders he's going out west to get the revelation of the seven thunders and the six dreams reveal the seventh now remember the seventh is always a mystery never spoken it's always a mystery in the scriptures you go through six seals when you get to the seventh it says there's silence in heaven for the space of half an hour nothing is told not even a symbol written there's never anything and at the revelation of the seventh seal brother branham said that's revelations 10 1-7 and when we come to the revelation of the seventh seal now there's seven thunders and john's told not to write it's a mystery again nothing's written so brother branham's coming to he has this mystery in his life and this mystery in his life he knows is attached to the seals he knows malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 are attached he knows this he knows they're linked together he knows it has something to do with his ministry he knows he's moving towards it he's looking at it and he knows this is coming but it's a mystery in his life a constant mystery in his life but the six dreams revealed the it's mystery it's time to go you know in and and i love junior jackson's dream in junior jackson's dream there's a pyramid and the pyramid has writing all over the outside of it right and and that's the seals and symbol form that's the seals that are being preached amen before the before the thunders but in the capstone there has to be something and brother branham grabs an instrument and he rips the cap off and inside there is white stone that's never been written on before and before this brother branham had been going around the pyramid interpreting all the writing on the outside of the pyramid because brother branham had already preached the church ages amen he preached revelations chapter 5. he's preached all of these things but he gets up to the seals in 1961 in 1960 he preaches the first first four chapters first three chapters goes into the fourth chapter and then in 1961 he goes into the fifth chapter revelations chapter five and he stops and he stands still and he does not move forward until now these six dreams capped by the vision move him forward because what is it he's been on the outside of the pyramid interpreting the writing on the outside of the pyramid he's been talking all about it but now it's time for the seven thunders and he rips the cap off and in the cap is is the is the unwritten stone he said light has never shined on this before hallelujah this was more i'm telling you this was so much more than somebody talking about the church ages again and souls under the altar and tribulation this was so much more than that we can catch the information of the sequence of events in the timeline and we can miss the whole thing in the sixth deal brother brennam says now remember these are hidden mysteries and the sixth seal altogether is one great big book just six scrolls rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of redemption now did you just catch that brother brandon didn't say seven seals unwinds the whole book of redemption he said six seals six scrolls rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of redemption where's the seventh where's the seventh he's in the sixth year he's talking about the sixtieth all together is one great big book just six scrolls rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole earth was redeemed so now we find out that this is exactly matching what he did when he preached the seven seals because brother branham came every day and got a revelation from the angel and he would show up and he would tell you this means this and this means that and you find it in the scripture here and he's revealing all the way down through the sixth day but when he gets to the seventh he doesn't tell you anything and he talks and hems all around and he tells some stories and he gives he's poking at it and he wants you to see some things and he's talking about the sword in the hand and sabino cannon and all of these things and then he says i have a no he says stop right here why because he's a word prophet and he has to exactly match the word amen because when jesus christ was on earth in matthew 24 they asked him when will these things be what will be the sign that are coming in the time of the end they ask these questions and brother branham tells us he points us back to jesus christ in matthew 24 he tells all six seals but he omits the seventh here he comes amen in 1963 and he gives all six seals and his note says stop right here say no more he omits the seventh why his life is exactly paralleling the scriptures this prophet is not doing anything outside the word he's walking right in step with the word so he says the six scrolls together it unwinds the whole book of revel whole book of redemption because it did unwind the whole book of redemption because the six revealed the seventh because the seventh was a mystery and brother banham said do you see have you noticed what's been happening the mysterious part of these meetings all this week and he says i know you don't see it you're not getting it you're not supposed to get it hallelujah why because it's matching it's paralleling the scriptures and what he's trying to show us is the sixth has revealed the seventh the sixth has revealed the seventh in future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride brother brandon said you think that little noise out here in tucson was something when he opened up the six seals that shook the country around about and caught and caused the talk i thought he opened the seven seals amen he says when he opened the six seals why because there's a mystery to the seventh and it comes by revelation in the seventh seal brother roman says now notice now the end of time message this seal after all he's revealed all the six seals but it don't say nothing about the seventh and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the bible before knowing that remember between revelation 10 1-7 at the end of the seven angels message all the mysteries of god will be known were at the end time the opening of the seventh seal now the eighth chapter only reveals the scene the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed nothing is not revealed in the seventh seal further down says the seventh seal is spoke of from the very beginning in genesis amen these seals move right up could you remember this morning bringing these things up and watch tonight bring them up and you find out when it gets to the seventh seal she cuts off jesus christ is speaking himself told of the end time and when he got he told all six seals when he got to the seventh he stopped there it is there's what you see he's matching the scriptures he's got to preach it the way the scriptures say amen and then brother brennan preached the seventh seal you you better believe he preached the seventh seal is the seventh seal open absolutely the seventh seal opened but he revealed it in the six he said look at the mysterious thing that's been going on all week those angels come to me one by one amen and he starts talking about seven thunders seven thunders thundering out all in a row like they're spelling out something because the six reveals the seventh hallelujah in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living then you will understand clearly then you see on i believe what is being done god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knowed anything about it even the angels didn't understand it what's he talking about the seventh seal the coming of the lord the revelation of jesus christ that's the reason under those seven mysteries when the seventh seal was opened there was silence jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven thunders uttered their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't know he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible because them seven seals are sealed up the mystery of the bible this bible this book of redemption is the mysteries of it is sealed up in seven seals and when the seven seals peeled off it showed us the whole bible and that's why brother branham comes to christ as the mystery of god revealed and he says now he showed it in every type that's in the bible give me eyesafe god oh don't let my eyes be holding that i cannot see that you're walking with us today we're on the road to emmaus amen things have happened and we're recognizing by the scriptures but i want to see you're right here you're right here in our midst and you're breaking down to us the scriptures you're breaking the bread of life and we're seeing who this is hallelujah he showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible he didn't say most types what's brother branham doing brother branham is repeating the road to emmaus he comes to christ as the mystery of god revealed and he's repeating the road to emmaus now watch what he says he showed or revealed in every type that's in the bible when jesus came after his death after his resurrection he's come back to them now after he's paid the price for redemption and he's come back to them and now amen their eyes are holding they don't even know what's happening and he begins to speak to them all the prophets starting at moses in all the prophets every type that was in the bible was speaking of him and here he comes at his resurrection and now brother branham comes and mis and after the seals and christ is the mystery of god revealed and he's repeating the road to emmaus because everything he does is in the scriptures that's why when jesus hallelujah when jesus in matthew and yeah in matthew 24 i believe it is he's going through and he and they're asking him the questions and he's giving them the six seals but when he gets to the seventh seal he doesn't tell him anything but after his resurrection when redemption is done amen when he's paid the price now he comes back and their eyes are holding and he begins to teach them all that the prophet said he starts at moses and he goes through all of the prophets amen what's he doing he's preaching christ as the mystery of god revealed hallelujah oh something thrills my soul when we see that this is firmly entrenched in the scriptures this isn't the ideas of a man brother branham is just walking and led by the holy spirit thinks i'll do this and i'll try to do this and it doesn't work out and i do this what's god doing he's making the pattern he's the pattern once god sets the pattern it always sticks with the same pattern and brother branham's walking in the pattern and he doesn't even know that i can't do this and i'm going to do this and it won't work out for that and i'm waiting on this what's he doing god is forcing him to walk in the pattern that he established when he was here the first time that's why he comes and he doesn't preach the seventh seal amen he doesn't preach the seventh seal when he preaches the seven seals he preaches the seventh seal on the road to emmaus and christ is the mystery of god revealed why does he come later to do it because jesus did it later it's got to follow the pattern it always has the scriptures has to stay true and you got to remember that this word that we're reading is jesus christ right that's john 1 1 amen it's telling us that this is jesus christ this is the son of god in print form i'm reading this amen this is not some people's ideas this is the word of god now if jesus christ we know hebrews 13 8 was a theme of brother branham through his whole ministry and the theme is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and that makes every single word in this bible the same yesterday today and forever and that's why brother branham coming being a word prophet he could not do one thing out of step with the pattern that's laid in the scriptures because this scripture was not written for jesus day when he's on the road to emmaus he didn't write that for his day he wrote that for our day if you put this bible anywhere else but today and i'm talking every scripture every line every verse if you put it off to the jews or you put it off in the psalms or you put it off to the corinthians you have missed the mystery of god then you do not even know what the seventh seal is don't tell me old testament new testament that was for the jews or that was for the babylonian that was for the exile to babylon that's about me if you don't see jesus christ in every line in the bible you go back and read it again for you missed something and this seventh seal has been shown in every type that's in the bible don't don't talk to me about that was for another day every word is eternal [Applause] don't put it somewhere else you bring it right today and this word is eternal and it's being fleshed out again and again and again and again he set the pattern in genesis chapter one and he's never deviated from the pattern in genesis chapter one genesis chapter one is still happening today he laid a pattern and the pattern is continuing to move on this is so much more than even human lips can say i could stand here from now till this time tomorrow and not even scratch the surface of what i'm talking about hallelujah and christ is the mystery of god revealed he is showed or revealed in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ do we believe that well you can't say well that was david amen you can't say well that was the kings you can't say that was the judges amen if so you've missed christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type in expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it let's go to revelations chapter 10. we want this to drive down into your souls and right now your mind might be spinning let it spin it has nothing to do with your brain this has nothing to do with your intellect or your reasoning or your ability to understand i am preaching to your soul and that is exactly the way jesus christ preached when he was here on earth because when jesus was here every time they asked him a question he never answered their question he gave him more truth he comes to the woman at the well and then the woman at the well he says get me a drink and she says well you know there's customs and you know we're not supposed to do these things and he says if you knew who i were you would ask me of a drink that you would never come here you never thirst again and immediately this this woman's story in john chapter 4 is my story it's your story this is exactly the same we came to the lord amen he come by our way and he says a little something and immediately she reasons it and we did the same thing how can this be i've never heard this before one man prophet for the whole world i where's that in the bible i mean what about all these other churches what about all these other people who confess jesus mental reasoning and she says how how are you going to get this water i mean the well's deep and you don't have anything to draw with she goes instantly to reasoning how are you going to do that and jesus never even flinches at the question never even acts like she said a word amen he said the water that i give because god doesn't answer reasoning it has nothing to do with reasoning god is not trying to get an intellectual understanding to this woman he's trying to bring a revelation that comes from the soul and he ignores her reasoning he ignores her question that's where the bride makes a mistake today trying to get on the grounds of reasoning and answering all the questions i say you you want me to answer that question answer me a question that's what jesus said who was john amen we don't have to answer the devil's questions we don't have to follow the path of the mind we can bypass the mind and go right to the soul and if there's a seed of god in there it's not about answering the questions it's about giving the truth giving the word because that's what awakens the soul and now she's there and said how the well is deep you have nothing to draw with he says the water that i give shall be a well of water springing up into eternal life now here's a woman who asked a very reasonable question and she got a very ridiculous answer and this just shows that it has nothing to do with your mind because this woman had a legitimate reasonable question that the lord completely ignored and then he says then this water that i give will be in them a well of and she says give me that water this is the most unreasonable conversation that i've ever read but this is coming right out of the bible this is my story this is your story before he answered the questions before reasoning was ever suffice he said something else came off the lips of a prophet we read something else out of our bible and all of a sudden we said i want this life i want this water we didn't even know what we were talking about we hardly knew what we were asking for but that was a response of the soul crying out for the living water not for reasoning and understanding and mental conceptions that will bring failure and death every time if jesus would have stood there and says well see you have to understand there's a natural spiritual type and i'm saying he never went through any of that stuff he just went right to the soul he did the same thing to the rich young rule and the rich young ruler turned around and walked away but this woman didn't walk away she said give me that water amen and then jesus does something else that's a little ridiculous he just said i've got water come to me and drink if you drink your eternal life and she now accepts the offer give me the water he says okay go get your husband this is the same way the prophet preaches amen he'll be saying something then he goes off and says something else then he comes back and it's all tying together hallelujah he's telling stories and these aren't stories these are parables he's talking about we were over hunting and this and that and he's telling you what he's preaching about it and we breathe right over it to get to something else because we want to get to the meat of the word and he's giving you the parable that is explaining the whole thing before he preaches the seals he preaches christ in simplicity god hiding himself in simplicity and he comes out he says i'm sorry i'm a teeny bit late i had to bury a marry a couple before i came in and then the next thing he does is dedicate a church he's showing you what he's going to be doing this week this is what this week is all about i'm marrying a couple i'm marrying christ to the bride and i'm dedicating a church for service amen but we got to drop the reasoning and we got to let the soul grab a hold of this word and the brother branham is teaching the same way jesus taught hallelujah his life is matching the scriptures we've got to drop all of this reasoning taken the word and said god give me isaf let me see you breaking bread and my eyes will be open and i can see it's been you all along talking with me as we walk along the way that's what brother branham was trying to show him and christ is the mystery of god revealed he's saying you know this isn't me i'm just a microphone i'm just a mute i'm like a trumpet laying there i mean in the seventh seal he's saying you could have a line of trumpets and nothing can happen unless a man's blowing into the trumpet he's trying to show you this isn't me this isn't a man he said william branham's got nothing more to do with this than anything he's trying to show you this has been the road to emmaus these last years of the ministry it's been the road to emmaus are you seeing it hallelujah brother madam says in christ's mystery god revealed further down he said god has one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he's revealed it and shows it and god's help well you'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed him therefore you can see the great meaning of what it has been to know this and then try to bring it to the people and then you don't i haven't went into details to try to explain it as god has revealed it to me he wants you to see something friends christ is the mystery of god revealed again now i want you to turn to the book of colossians first chapter of colossians and then while we read this beginning with i want you when you go home read the entire chapter colossians but i want you to read this morning with me from 15th to the 29th verse let's go there ourselves actually we were supposed to go to revelations weren't we let's go to revelation 7 first because i want to drill this in and then we'll move but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god now that word's not plural he's not talking about multiple mysteries even though under this lies multiple mysteries there are multiple mysteries but he's talking about when we get to this point in the plan of redemption and the redemption cycle when we get to this point in the days of the voices of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets so there's coming a time that the mystery will be finished god won't be finished the word won't be finished the redemption plan won't be finished the war the the mystery will be finished but the mystery's not going to be finished to the whole world the mystery is going to be finished to the elected ones now let's go to colossians i tell you i love this word i keep praying god i sav that's what i must have as i said you know that the apostle paul read this bible he studied under gamalio he knew this word oh my he knew it forward and backward under the greatest teacher of them all he was a student that was stellar and raising in the ranks to the position where they knew him at the high priest office because he could go to them and get letters to go persecute he was a known entity he wasn't a stranger he wasn't a student in his first year he was one who had come up under gamaliel and we know gamalio had influence in the sanhedrin because he began to speak and say hey let's wait on this thing so he comes up and now he knows this word but but he knows this word so well that he doesn't even see the word when it's fleshed out he studied the bible he can quote it verbatim he knows where to find every book every every book of the bible what it says where to find it what prophet prompted prophesied what order it came in he probably even knew the genealogies and the dates and the times of the events but here you have jesus christ and a mini-member bride after pentecost and jesus christ on earth fulfilling the word that he had written amen and and paul so versed in the word he can't even see it so god comes to him and blinds him by a light and and he comes to jesus and jesus comes to him and says why paul are you persecuting me paul loved the word and he was persecuting the word he couldn't recognize it in these forms but it was exactly according to the scriptures he had studied he was there to witness stephen stoning he was there for all of these things that these events had taken place he was in the know he was now there in one of the chief persecutors of the early church and he was blind to the fact that i'm persecuting the word i am persecuting god i'm going against this thing made flesh until god until god opened his eyes and he saw he saw the lord and he says why persecutest thou me and you know instantly he was blinded praise the lord because the lord jesus and the pillar of fire could not show paul the word all that he could do was blind paul he said go into the city and it will be told thee what thou must do now here is the lord himself in the form of the pillar of fire the one who the whole word is about who wrote the whole word who created all things all things were made by him and for him and nothing was made without him and here he is and he knows all things and he's got it all right here and he won't even tell paul what he must do he smites paul blind because if you want to go to the pillar of fire the pillar of fire will smite you blind because it's a different dispensation now it's a different time now the pillar of fire will smite you blind so many people trying to go back to the pillar of fire back to the pillar of fire if you go back to that pillar of fire it'll smite you blind because now we stand in the book of acts we are now in the book of acts that's what the prophet told us we we were in that we are the the book of acts is the example church and we're being returned back to the example church and we're standing here in the book of acts and now in the book of acts you cannot go to the lord and the pillar of fire you cannot say lord you show me i don't want to listen to any man that didn't work for paul amen now the pillar of fire smites him blind and the only way that he can see is if a prophet comes and lays hands on him and opens his eyes and tells him what he must do it's got to come through the body right even the ethiopian eunuch an angel comes and he tells he tells it philip you go there i want you to go to the wilderness he knows there's appointment that's got to be made why couldn't the angel go to the eunuch because we're in the book of acts hallelujah the life has to come through the body now the word has to come through the body and now the ethiopian eunuch is reading amen and philip is told to draw alongside the chariot and they get here together and and he's talking and he hears him reading and he says do you understand what you're reading he said how can i let some man guide me and beginning at that scripture he preached unto him christ hallelujah beginning at that scripture and brothers and sisters it's not for a pillar of fire to do it amen it's not even for the prophet of the age to do it he's coming he's gone but now there is a source of life on the earth there is a fountain of living water and we are that fountain of living water to give out the word we're in the book of acts we are the church of the book of acts there is only one place to come and get the water of life and you have to get one of those believers amen that's been filled with the holy ghost that's become a fountain of living water hallelujah so now he begins to explain to him christ now he didn't have to take him from that verse to another one and say no no no let's not start there let's start in malachi 4. starting at that verse why because every verse is talking about christ we don't have to go to some specific verse we can begin at any verse and preach christ because he's the entire bible every character was him and type every story was speaking of him and all of moses and all of the prophets and all the psalms and all the proverbs it's all about him pick a verse and let's start talking about him hallelujah brother madam said in the in christ's mystery god revealed he said let's read colossians let's turn there ourselves and read colossians chapter 15. colossians chapter 1 verse 15 who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he's before all things and by him all things consist what does that make christ everything everything and he is before all things and by them all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell hallelujah let's go down to verse 25. whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hid from the ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory book of acts where is he he's in his church so now now we have uh in colossians he says now there's this mystery that's been hid from generations and from ages what is this it's the same mystery that we're speaking out in revelations 10 7 the mystery of god and brother branham said he spoke of this all the way back in the beginning in genesis and the whole bible is telling the same thing what is this it's the mystery of christ he comes to christ is the mystery of god revealed and listen he tells the whole story in the title he reveals the whole bible in the title of this message he reveals the seventh seal and the title of this message he reveals your life in the title of this message christ is the mystery of god revealed in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god shall be revealed christ is the mystery of god revealed what's he telling you this is the seventh seal this is it what is it it's christ hallelujah and then he comes this opening scripture that brother branham brings his opening scripture and christ is the mystery of god revealed he goes to this passage that we just read this mystery that has been hid from ages and from generations but now is to be real christ in you the hope of glory what is this the seventh seal and you're part of it hallelujah brother brandon says read this 15th through the 29th verse it says and now just be as patient as you can for i feel that in this here if god will help me will reveal and bring into your mind all these other things that i have talked on through the days of the tabernacle why i have said what i have said why i have done what i have done this is why because because the prophet of god knows he's walking through the book of revelations amen 1959 he knows that there's a there's a change in his ministry coming he knows he's coming and and then he starts walking into this 1960 and he starts preaching the revelation of jesus christ he's walking through the first three chapters of the book of revelation but he's knowing he's going to get to the seventh seal hallelujah this he says he says that cloud that you saw up here that's the vindication of my ministry he gets to revelations 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound now he recognizes that's his ministry and he ties that to malachi 4 and he said this will bring the past the turning of the hearts of the children back to the fathers what is it the opening of the seals turns the hearts back to the faith of the fathers because the faith of the fathers was a quickening an awakening to the word and his whole bible was sealed up with seven seals but in christ is the mystery of god review he says now for a text now he just gave you the title christ is the mystery of god revealed he goes through colossians christ in you the hope of glory now he says for a text i want to take out of there this for a text basing it upon the entire bible amen well praise god you want to sit down with somebody who wants to debate the bible and they want to talk about what paul said and what john said and they want to do this and that i'm saying i want to talk to you about the entire bible not one verse two verses i want them all 66 books let's talk about it today because this is the day we live in this is where we're at the whole bible on display we've come to the capstone let's go to revelations chapter one brother says we could go all day all night praise the lord i'm trying to just point to one thing just i'm just pointing out one thing praise god revelations chapter 1 verse 1 the revelation of jesus christ stop what is this the seventh seal he tells you right revelations chapter one verse one this is the revelation of jesus christ this is the seventh seal what is the book of revelation the the revelation of jesus christ that whole last book in the bible that 66 book is the revelation of jesus christ every verse every period every every part of that is the revelation of jesus christ and it is the capstone to the whole bible that's why brother branham said it was all wrapped up in those seven seals the mystery of the whole bible and the mystery of the whole bible is right here in the capstone in the book of revelation it's a capstone book for a capstone ministry to a capstone people the book of revelation is the bride's book this is the book for the elect amen this is the revelation of jesus christ this is the seventh seal hallelujah oh my goodness i just want to sit down before i do anything else and read the whole bible again i wish that i had a year to go lock myself up somewhere and read the whole bible read the church ages read the seven seals read all of 1963 64 65 and read my entire bible that's what all that's all the desire i have in my heart right now because that's it that's the whole thing brothers and sisters hallelujah said i'm basing it upon the entire bible but i want to us to title this christ is the mystery of god revealed christ being the mystery of god revealed hallelujah and christ didn't use the hope of glory when he's preaching christ is the mystery of god revealed he's preaching about you he's preaching about me we're on the road to emmaus and he's saying i want to read preach the whole bible i take from my text basing it on the entire bible what's he saying we're on the road to emmaus you're my disciples you're not getting it oh you fools and slow of heart to learn i'm basing this on the whole bible revelation 10 7 revelations 1 1 genesis 1 1. john 1 1. what is that it's all the seventh seal it's all the mystery of christ hallelujah it's all the unveiling of god hallelujah oh i wish i could preach i wish i could say it brother ben said i wish i could show you the way it's been revealed to me just pray brothers and sisters just pray now god's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed that's the whole bible that is christ the mystery of god revealed letting himself what was in the back part of his mind the mystery that he held in his mind is he wanted to let himself be expressed and that is christ the mystery in the mind of god expressed hallelujah praise god now i want to i want to focus in on the sixth revealing the seventh now in souls that are in prison now the prophet says now remember in that sixth seal were all seven trumpet sounds under that sixth seal when we get to that you'll see that every trumpet took place in the sixth seal the seven is always the mystery remember that when you read the bible the seven is always the mystery watch that seven that's the finish that was the coming of the lord heaven was quiet silent nobody moved because jesus said himself not even an angel of heaven knows when i will return i don't even know it myself what time the father is putting that in his mind god alone knows it the spirit said i didn't know it when it was revealed when that seventh trumpets are that seventh angel a seal was opened then there was silence in heaven see it wasn't give away what would take place but under the sixth seal where those seven trumpets opened remember under there we find out that the lamb came forth appeared on the scene he had left the mercy seat his work of redemption was finished and he came forth and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and time was no more when did he do this under the sixth seal because the six reveals the seventh hallelujah and immediately an angel appeared in the seventh chapter the tenth chapter and the seventh verse and the angel came down and swore that time was no longer when in the sixth seal hallelujah why because the whole book of redemption is revealed in the six seals why because the seventh seal isn't anything first seal is this and second seal and third seal but what's the seventh seal seven seal isn't anything the seven seal is a person it's all revealed in six seals because six seals telling you this types this and this is happening in this world event in the future event all in six seals revealing the whole mystery of redemption but the seventh seal is not revealing anything in the mystery of redemption the seventh seal is the revelation of the person of redemption remember the seventh seal is not a thing it's not an event necessarily it's a person that's why the six reveals the seventh because you would have never got the six without the presence of the seventh hallelujah go back to the book of ruth you go to the book of ruth the book of ruth takes ruth through the church ages the seals are in the book of ruth because here we find out that ruth is already she is already in the church ages they've come down through spiritual famine they've been they've left their land they should have never left the word but naomi's husband left the word which is the land because there was a famine in the land now it's funny to note that boaz never left the land but naomi's husband left the land because he had to make a living for them why because they were under economic crisis right which is the third seal the black horse rider with the scale in his hands so under economic crisis they cannot they cannot hang anymore so they move out but boaz has a revelation of the word and boaz is not going to let the third seal move him anywhere he's not going to let spiritual famine he's not going to let you know economic pressure with the balances in the hand of the horse right move him off of his land and when they come back he's exceedingly wealthy don't ever move off of this word for anything it doesn't matter what's happening in your life everything could be going absolutely wrong in your life amen your everybody's turned on you your family doesn't want you anymore you've lost your job you're losing your home you stay right on this word because boaz stood right in his land and when they returned amen uh naomi's husband lost everything and boaz was there in position to redeem it all back if you want to have any redemption for any of your family you stay in the land if you want to have redemption for any of the seed of god that has gone out under economic pressure under a red horse rider and backslid and gone into the world and gone to moab if you want to hold the door of redemption open for any of them you stay in your land and you become exceedingly wealthy in the spirit life exceedingly wealthy in your spiritual walk amen so now they go down to the land and when they go down to the land now they come to the fourth horse rider death he dies his sons die now naomi is the old church right and she's she's there and she's in the fourth horse rider she's in death and death is bringing tribulation and in tribulation tribulation in the sixth seal is always putting the jews in position six seals always putting the left in the homeland taking them back to the land and so now death comes and after death comes tribulation and now now naomi's in the sixth seal because god's using everything the destruction and everything to push her back to the homeland hallelujah the seals are in ruth brother venom said this is in the entire bible and so now naomi naomi has two daughters a wise and a foolish all right and they're going to go with her but one turns back because she doesn't have oil in her lamp but the other one she continues to go on so ruth goes on and now ruth goes through four stages i will restore saith the lord all that the canker worm and the palmer worm and the caterpillar has eaten all of those things now i will restore and restoring through luther through wesley through pentecost back to the bride age she comes through ruth deciding amen ruth serving ruth resting ruth rewarded brother brennam talks about the four stages of her journey what's happening she's coming out of spiritual death she's coming out of tribulation she's coming out of the dark ages and she's coming back into the land amen and she's moving back into an inheritance amen but she must have a redeemer so she comes in deciding and she's moving in the first stage and she comes to serving she's moving in the second stage why because deciding they had to decide to leave the old form and take on the new and the reformation they had to accept justification but when it came to serving brother branham said that that age was the great missionary age they were working so now she's serving then it comes to ruth resting because she's entered into the pentecostal holy ghost age and now the rest has returned but she's got to go beyond that she's got to go back to marrying the redeemer she's got to go to the fourth stage of the journey because justification makes a way for sanctification sanctification makes a way for the baptist in the holy ghost the baptismal holy ghost makes a way for the person of the holy ghost himself the seventh seal has to come on the scene which is the person of the holy ghost himself this holy ghost has been bound and chained by these denominational waters for nearly two thousand years but now in the end time by the evening time message to be loosed back upon the people again what is it it's the fourth stage of the journey it's the restoration back and what is ruth rewarded ruth marries boaz the seals are in ruth brother branham said the whole bible was sealed up in these seven seals and when he took it off he revealed the whole bible hallelujah so now she comes to the point that she wants to marry boaz so she slips in and she lays under his skirt and he wakes up and sees a woman and he recognizes you're righteous she doesn't seem to be doing something that's righteous but she's righteous why she's just like the woman at the well i want that water i want redemption amen something's moving her to do something that would people would question they would scratch their heads and not understand but she's something within her is moving she's thirsting for the birthright she's thirsting for the birthright and she moves in and she slides in under his skirt he wakes up and he sends her away and what's he send her away with six measures of barley six reveals the seventh where's the seventh boaz is the seventh the seventh isn't a thing the seventh is a person here's the person revealing the six seals to ruth and he says where's the seventh measure where's the seventh person you get to the seventh seal and you're reading it and it's the most anticlimactic moment of the message am i the only one and it's it's ruth and no doubt ruth had learned from naomi everything runs in cycles of seven six is man's number sevens is god's number completion and here's one and two and three and four and five and six and she brings it back to naomi and says see what i've gotten and naomi says rest here till all is accomplished because he's the seventh he doesn't reveal the seventh when he gives the six he always does it later like he doesn't preach the seventh seal to seventh seal he preaches that a christ is the mystery of god revealed he gives he gives the measures and then later he reveals i'm your seventh portion i'm the one who gave the six i'm the redeemer i'm the one who's buying it all back hallelujah we want to go read this whole bible again don't we i want to read every verse every line and say god give me i sav oh wipe my eyes clean i mentioned the woman at the well of samaria brother brother branham starts to tell us about the story and he tells us over and over and over again and it happens in the fourth chapter of the book of john now ruth has four stages of deliverance ruth is in four chapters because deliverance always comes in 4. and here in the fourth chapter of the gospel of john which is the bride's gospel in the fourth chapter we have this story of the woman at the well why that's my story that's your story it says jesus was tired so he rested on the well at the sixth hour of the day because the seventh is always revealed in the six in the sixth hour of the day he's resting and he begins to have this conversation with her and he says go get your husband how many husbands did she have six husbands where's the seventh the seventh is always a mystery because she's going to be united with the seventh and the seventh isn't openly declared the seventh is always a mystery boaz was the seventh measure christ was the seventh husband he's always the seven even if you go to the old testament tabernacle in the old testament tabernacle in the wilderness moses was told to make it according to the same fashion of the one he seen in heaven and the one on earth is reflecting that and there's six pieces of furniture you have the brazen altar the brazen laver the table of show bread the lamp stand the altar of incense and the ark of the covenant six the seventh is a mystery what's the seventh the seventh is a person it's the shekinah glory of god that dwells on the throne that dwells between the wings of the cherubim the seventh is not a thing the seventh is not information the seventh is a person i love this bible i love this word let's go to genesis chapter 1. hallelujah it's too much brothers and sisters it's so much brother branham and christ is the mystery of god revealed he says he says now if you would want to mark this down i got so many places and he takes him to luke 24. he said two of the apostles in the road emmaus jesus stepped out after his resurrection and they were on the road to emmaus going along the road thinking and talking and weeping on account of his death and how they seen him suffer and what they had thought was of no value at all they took their lord and crucified him they were going along weeping and he stepped out from the roadside and began to talk to them about christ he said o fools and slow to understand don't you know that all the prophets and the psalms see what was he doing identifying himself to the apostles that all the prophets in all the psalms and everything was him expressed that's why brother bam said if you don't see jesus christ in every verse and every line go back and read it again you miss something because why the seals revealed the mystery of the bible what was the mystery of the bible the seventh seal is the mystery of the whole bible the seventh seal is not a thing the seventh seal is a person and that person is christ and that is the theme of the entire bible and that's why those seven seals revealed the whole bible because now we come to the end of it we recognize that the whole thing is him every story is a redemption story why is every story in the old testament a redemption story because it's the story of redemption genesis 1 1. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth you know what you just read the seventh seal you believe me because what was the first thing that come out from god it was the word the logos and everything that was made was made by the word all things were made by him and for him and without him was not anything made that was made so in the opening verse he shows you the seventh seal the seventh seal is not a thing the seventh seal is a person you've not been united to a thing you've not been married to an idea or a thing you've been married to a person the person of the word which is jesus christ hallelujah now we go through creation and we come to six days of creation right you have six days of creation and what's seventh nothing you come to six seals you get to the seventh nothing uh matthew 24 jesus tells him the sixth seals he gets to the seventh he says nothing we come to six days of creation this is made this is the order this is done this is in order you get to the seventh nothing right the lord rested the seventh is always the mystery and nothing the seventh is always nothing because the six reveal the seventh do you believe me let's look let's look at creation here god makes no mistakes brother branham said genesis is the seed and what he establishes in genesis runs all the way out to the book of revelation genesis is the foundation revelation is the capstone and that's the whole bible that's christ that's the whole thing so let's go to chapter one verse three and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day so we see he speaks and something happens there's a revelation of something in his mind right and then he says it's good we go down to verse 10 and god called the dry land earth and he gathered together of the earth called seas and god saw that it was good verse 12 god saw that it was good verse 18 god saw that it was good verse 21 god saw that it was good it meant verse 25 and god saw that it was good how many goods did you count one two three four five six six times he says it's good brings you to the sixth day and what does he do on the sixth day he's going to reveal the seventh seal in the sixth day verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over all the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them what did he do the seventh seal brother branham said there's a threefold purpose to the whole book of the bible christ is mystery god revealed that god would get pre-eminence in a man that god would get reiman's in the church the bride and he would restore them to an eaten condition amen the day six the six thousandth year of creation and the sixth day he creates man in his own image in the image of god creates a male and female he creates them right in the in chapter five he says and calls their name adam in the masterpiece brother branham says see this is his masterpiece family this is the masterpiece of god what is the masterpiece the two being one the masterpiece of god is the two being one and he said the whole old testament was speaking of him from the foundation of the patriarchs coming through the kings coming through the prophets and the psalms and the proverbs what is it until he comes to the capstone which is jesus christ standing on the earth and he's the fullness of the old testament but that wasn't the whole masterpiece in order to make the masterpiece there was part of the masterpiece inside the first image that's why and when we get to genesis chapter 2 let's go over there for just a second genesis chapter 2 verse 18 this genesis chapter 2 is describing the sixth day so you inject this into the sixth day and in the sixth day verse eighteen said and the lord said that it is not good that man shall be alone now here's a mystery it's good it's good it's good it's good it's good it's good six times and in the breach between the sixth and the seventh seal in the breach in genesis chapter one in the gap between the six goods and the sixth day and the seventh seal the sixth and the seventh seal on the sixth day there's a gap on the sixth day the breach is on the sixth day he says something he's never said before it is not good what's not good it's good that jesus christ it's not good that jesus christ will be alone and not have a bride it is it is not good that this man that i made in my image male and female stands alone it is not good that man is alone now he wasn't alone because all the attributes of the female were in him he was amen he was created in the image of god male and female and he's now put into a form and in that form he's now alone and he says it's not good why he wants you to see the mystery of the seventh it's good it's good it's good it's good it's good it's not good so then he strikes a little blow over on his side and he pulls out of him the bride and puts her in a separate form and she's formed up the bride and then he unites them together and brother branham said the crowning act of his creation the crowning act of his creation his masterpiece now completed the two being one let's go back to genesis chapter 1. in verse 31 chapter two is injected into chapter one it's the sixth day now we're coming back verse 31 in god so everything that he had made and behold it was very good do we see the mystery it's good it's good it's good it's good it's good it's good it's not good something has to change what is he bringing the revelation of the seventh seal he comes back to verse 31 and now he looked at all that he had made all of his creation and he says it's very good and then you come to chapter two and the seventh day the lord ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his works he had made the seventh seal doesn't do anything now you've entered into millennium he did it all on the sixth day so there was six thousand years of creation a day is unto the lord is a thousand years a thousand years into a day for six thousand years he gets to the sixth day he in the sixth day he makes the image of himself male and female his masterpiece he places it in the garden he moves into the seventh day and in the seventh day satan comes in and mars the image all right so what's he start doing he starts building back again how long does it take 6 000 years now we're in the second sabbath cycle because remember the lamb was kept up for 14 days for two sabbaths you have a you have a sabbath cycle that brings god's idea into eden god's idea of a man and woman united together in eden it gets destroyed then he starts the second sabbath cycle and the whole bible is the second sabbath cycle and the whole story was told in genesis chapter one that sets the pattern and everything's been living off of that pattern ever since so now we've come to the sixth thousandth day we're in the sixth thousands we're in the sixth day and in the sixth day he opens the sixth seal because the sixth seal begins at world war ii because the sixth seal begins with the sixth trumpet which is world war ii the second woe and under the sixth seal he has the ministry of william branham he has the the angel constellation he has the revelation of the seven seals he has that and this this sixth sixth day goes all the way to millennium this sixth seal goes all the way to the millennium so in the sixth what does he do he reveals the seventh because the seventh isn't anything nothing happens on the seventh the seventh is everything he did in the sixth now rest in the seventh in genesis one everything he did in six thousand years and all that he did everything come to the masterpiece everything come to the culmination on the sixth day and on the sixth day he reveals the seventh seal and then seventh day he doesn't do anything hallelujah we're in the sixth day and in the sixth day under the sixth seal at the time of the sixth trumpet he reveals the seventh seal he unites the bride and the bridegroom he does it all with all the work of redemption in the sixth and he comes to the seventh and they rest in the millennium the sixth reveals the seventh that's why when you get your seven seven seal book and you're reading through and you're like i get it i get it i get it i get it one thing i'm realizing i didn't even get half of it i was putting it back there and over there and brother branham said if you read the word amen the man's made the big mistake of always taking it and putting it back there or forward he said it's all going to come home today this whole bible has to come home today these whole seven seals have to come home today not over there and over there so when you read the you say oh yeah that happened oh that's going to happen you've missed the seals just like in revelations amen revelations uh chapter one two and three there's seven letters written to seven churches so if you start thinking oh yeah there were seven churches yeah this one was over there they're in turkey and yeah then you've missed the whole thing you've got to bring it today they've got to come today to catch the revelation and the seven seals have to come home today to catch the revelation that's why when you read when you read the new testament you said oh he wrote a letter to the corinthians oh they were having a problem yeah the women were getting up and shouting back and forth so he said let your women keep silencing church you've missed the bible you've missed the epistle and that's what the denominations have done they've totally missed the word because they've misplaced the word they've placed it all in a previous day or in a forward day and that's why they don't get the book of revelation it's all forward the rest of everything that's been written is passed and they don't miss the fact that it's an eternal word what he told the corinthians he's telling me what he told the romans he's telling me and paul testifies to this he says unto us unto whom the world the end of the world has come that was two thousand years ago he said that because he wasn't writing it to the crowd two thousand years ago he was writing it for us today that bible was pinned from the from the in the beginning to the amen was pinned for us today because the capstone of it is revelation amen the revelation of jesus christ is the whole mystery of the whole bible revealed in the book of revelation and this is the capstone time the capstone ministry and it's the whole bible wound up into a capstone ministry a bride on the earth at the end time who's fleshing out the entire word this is where we've made our mistakes this is where we've used reasoning should i get this job or that job should i go to school or not go to school and we're using our brains because we think this word was for that day this bible doesn't tell me whether i should go to college or not yes it does this bible doesn't tell me everything about a modern day life and in this millennial age yes it does why would god leave us anything but the very best to run our lives why would god leave us to human reasoning when he has never left it to human reasoning before i say god take the isaf off of my eyes i sat down and talked to some members of my family recently and i realized that i had made a mistake because i was reasoning with my children well don't you think you want to do this or wouldn't this be a better idea that's all human reasoning and it's all rubbish it's all garbage so i sat down with him i started doing things differently i said the bible says this and the bible says this and the bible says this and they got it they absolutely caught it it's not for over there and it's not for over there i can take this word here because it's an eternal word and i'm eternal being and this is christ and i'm part of christ so god has not left us to human reasoning to manage our lives he's not left us to flipping coins to see which side's heads and tails that is not how we're supposed to live our life we are supposed to live our life according to that word and we have to find our identification in this word what does this word say about me as a mother what does this word say about me as a father what does this word say about me as a single person what does the word say about me as a widow the widow is an office in the church the poor is an office in the church those that mourn and those that rejoice are parts of the body it's in the word everything's in the word we have to start finding our position in the word what does the word say and now i will line my life to these scriptures we have to absolutely get away from reasoning to figure our way through life we don't reason our way through life it's faith and the scripture and brother branham told us he said when a son or daughter of god takes the word of god from their hearts by faith places it on their lips it's the same as deity speaking our answer to everything to date has been reasoning jesus never walked by reasoning he never conversed with people by reasoning there came a time that jesus had to keep his own law and he had to give unto caesar what was caesar's and it came tax season and he didn't say oh you know we got this tax issue i'll pick up a second job or peter maybe you could go back and fish a little bit he needed to pay taxes so he said peter go cast thy line into and catch one fish not to sell to pull a coin out of its mouth to pay his taxes jesus never lived by reasoning he never reasoned anything he lived a life by faith and your faith has to be founded on something your faith cannot be founded on i think poor foundation faith cannot be founded on well i presume or i'm trying you can't base your faith on any of that the only thing you can do is base your faith on the word of god how do i conduct my home quit reading the books in the bible bookstore this book will tell you if you come to him with isaf and let him take the isab to your eyes and you read the book of proverbs the book of proverbs will tell you how to raise your children we've got to stop with all all the foolishness of the world the seventh seal has been revealed to us the seals have been lifted off of this bible we know that this is a living book living and breathing today this is an eternal word and every word in there will work for me today this is what the seals have opened up to us the mystery of the seventh seal the mystery of god is christ so now now we have to look things totally different than we've ever looked at them before because god is building upon the earth a faith civilization he's returning us under the ministry of malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 back to the original faith original faith of the fathers that original faith was based on the word not presuming not reasoning not thinking it was a life based on faith in the word jesus every step he made was based on the word here he comes in in every situation he finds he's quoting something out of the old testament only if you're a theologian and you're a student of the word you say he took that out of context go study the things that jesus says and go back and look at where he took that from the scripture and you would say how can he get this from that how many has done that and realizes jesus did not use reasoning jesus was taking the word and he recognized that's an eternal word and i'm an eternal being that word is christ and i'm christ that happened to david he didn't just write that for himself that's for me and jesus did it all the time all the time every time he spoke he's speaking the scriptures and most of the time you and your human reasoning and your human mind you would say that doesn't fit he took that out of context that doesn't even apply today i mean look at joel's prophecy that that peter picks up this prophecy on the day of pentecost and he says this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and and he only takes a little bit out of it and if you read the whole thing the whole thing doesn't apply to the day of pentecost it applies to the restoration of the children of israel back to the land it doesn't it's not even an exact application how dare peter how can peter just slice and dice the word like that how can he pull some from here and pull some from there how can he take a snippet out of joel that doesn't even apply because he's an eternal being and that's an eternal word and by revelation he knows what word will work today and he knows what this is that's speaking in tongues i know what this is and they say well what about all the prophecy that's for another time this is this part of the prophecy hallelujah if you want to be a bible student you cannot live like the apostles lived as a bible student you absolutely cannot be a bible student a modern day bible student that has to have everything in context and greek translations of every word and everything placed in its proper place according to the timelines and this happened here and this event happened there if you're that kind of bible student you cannot be a book of acts believer because that is not how they believe the bible that is not how they practice the scriptures and that is not how they quoted the scriptures amen brother bam told us he said he said listen i was with noah when he built the ark what's he talking about the seventh seal why because noah was an expression of christ i'm an expression of christ we're in the same family of christ i was with noah when he was he's expressing the seventh seal the whole bible every character every type what is it it's christ unveiled christ unveiled down through moses down through abraham down through moses out in the exodus coming in through joshua commission what is it it's a manifestation an unveiling of god revealing what was in the back part of god's mind it's the seventh seal being opened and then he comes and he calls you and you recognize it's him you hear the scream of the eagle and you recognize it's him unite to him and then he's coming some more he's coming in you and then another one's quick in the life he's coming some more and another one's quick in life he's coming some more that's why the seventh seal is the mystery of his coming and then brother branham changes that feast of trumpets he said now it's the mystery of the going and somebody else comes he's coming he's coming in you he's coming in you he's coming and you he's coming in you until he's done coming and when he's done coming now he's going what is it it's the seventh seal hallelujah he says i was there i was there when moses was talking to the burning bush hallelujah your brain won't remember that that's why we have to have the mind of christ because you've got human memory and human memory doesn't remember being at the burning bush but the mind of christ remembers being at the burning bush with the mind of christ i remember being there on the day of creation when he said let there be light brother bam said i was there why because i have the mind of christ and now i have my right mind i have the memory i was supposed to have from day one my human memory my human affections my human reasoning will not work but if i take the reasoning of christ which is faith and i take the memory of christ i take the affection of christ amen i take all these things of christ now i remember oh yes i was there i was there when he said let there be light why because i'm part of the logos i'm part of christ i was there i was there when he spoke to the squirrels [Music] i was there in colorado when he said why don't you walk with me and brother branham said if you don't remember that he said you've got spiritual amnesia and you don't know who you are you're not just a person who lives on this side street somewhere and works at this place and come out of this family that's not who you are you've got spiritual amnesia if all you see is your manual labor and your physical home and your physical family you have absolutely missed it all you need the mind of christ you need to get your memory back you've got spiritual amnesia and you've lost your memory you don't even know who you are you're a part of christ you're a part of the seventh seal you're the seventh seal on display today you're part of genesis 1 1. you're part of john 1 1. you're part of revelations 1 1. and if you're not there you've got spiritual amnesia and you don't know who you are so now let's pick up this bible if i was with moses and this word worked for moses when i was with moses why won't the eternal word work for me now if i was with david and was while i was with david [Laughter] this word worked then why can't i if i'm an eternal being in his eternal word why can't i take the word that worked once and use it again if i relied on it to get me out of trouble when we were in egypt why can't i rely on it now to get me out of trouble if it worked in the first exodus and it worked in the second exodus why won't it work in the third exodus hallelujah we've got to go beyond the human boundaries of our lives and step beyond into what we were created to be we were born to be supernatural beings amateur gods sons of god and the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god we weren't placed on this earth this is the book of acts amen where they tried to worship paul paul and barnabas they dropped down and said the gods have come down unto us why because they were messiest they had been cured from spiritual amnesia they knew the word would work they knew that they had the right to administer the word and they operated it by faith not by their reasoning see when i say we take this word to live by you can't just pull something out and say oh you that's reasoning it operates by faith you say god take the isab off my eyes show me in this word the solution to my problem because you would have never left a word that was a sealed book that can't be added to or taken away from if my solution today was not in that book we have lost faith in our bibles and that's why we've turned to bible bookstores full of garbage because we have lost faith in the sealed book that you cannot add to and you cannot take away from so my life is a sealed life under the power of the holy ghost and i can take the book that's been opened by the seven seals and i can say lord you have left me a solution you may find it in the old testament you may even find it in a minor prophet but once that revelation strikes you that won't be no minor revelation because it's our victory we overcome our faith is based on something and our faith is based on the word of god remember the sixth reveals the seventh let's turn to the gospels and we're just going to wrap up here because we could preach all day i just want to point a few things out i want you to study your scriptures and take what you've heard today and go back and relook at the word again but do you remember jesus's first miracle it was at a wedding [Laughter] what is he telling us jesus first recorded miracles at a wedding and what does he do he turns water into wine we got that but how much wine six water bots full why six six is the number of man i mean why six why the sixth day of creation why under the sixth seal why during the sixth trumpet why because the six reveals the seventh six water pots full of water turned to wine revealing what the seventh seal the seventh is always the person hallelujah oh i get so excited gabriel the angel comes to mary to announce to her that she's going to have the messiah it says in the scriptures he came to her in the sixth month what six months the sixth month after her her cousin elizabeth was pregnant but the scripture says that and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god in the sixth month what does he reveal he reveals the seventh seal where's the seventh seal the seventh seal is going to be in the virgin where's the there's been an angel in our day and after six what's in the sixth day what's he reveal he reveals the seventh seal where's the seventh seal the seven seals in the virgin hallelujah this is all over us this is all around us this is all through the scriptures oh praise the lord let's go to john 19. verse 13. now do you see why brother brenham after he preached to seals he said my bible has become a new book he was seeing things he hasn't even told us about but by revelation god is pointing us right back to these things the sixth reveals the seventh why in the sixth day what does he reveal in the forming of man man's the sixth day the number of man is six the bible has 66 books what do the 66 books reveal the seventh the 66 revealed the seven it's the same thing over and over and over again that's why brother branham could get to these opening seals he says my bible has been a new book he goes i'll never be the same i'll never think the same again and now when you pick this up and you realize everywhere i go is the seventh seal everything i read is the six seals and the seventh seal and now you realize my life is not mundane my life is not ordinary my life that i'm fleshing out today is all the way from genesis to revelation it's all a living word living today this is not boring this is not information this is where i'm at i'm standing here in the scriptures that's why i said for me it's no more reading the word it's not two-dimensional i have climbed down inside the bible and i'm walking around ruth and i'm looking i'm saying four stages of restoration i'm saying six measures of barley oh my goodness it's all here it's coming to a wedding and after she's married what happens is the seventh seal is inside of her now and what does she do with it after she gives birth to it she lays it on the lap of naomi and brother branham said the gentiles will carry this message back to the jews she'll bring forth christ and after she brings forth christ ruth turns around and she lays this baby on the lap of naomi and that's exactly what we're going to do lay this on the lap of naomi and then we're going home what am i doing i'm walking in ruth i'm in it i'm not looking at it i'm inside of it it's affecting my life it's the force that's moving me along just like brother branham's life was directed by the word that was already written his life was directed by matthew 24. his life is directed by the book of revelation and he doesn't know why he tries to do this and it doesn't work out tries to get a ten it doesn't work out what's happening he's preaching now he's preaching the revelation of jesus christ the church ages he goes into revelations five and for two years he cannot go any further why he's being held back by what the written word he gets to the seventh seal and he says i just feel checked not to go any further i feel to stop why what's he feeling what's moving on him what is holding him pushing him steering the ship what is it it's the word that has already been written and now he can't go beyond that he can't give the revelation the seventh seal he can't unfold it clearly he's got to give a few clues a few signs some events leading up to it and then he's got to stop and then we have silence on the seven seals until we get to christ as the mystery of god revealed what is he doing he is matching the word and if that word that was written 2 000 years before the prophet showed up can direct his life so accurately that beyond his will and beyond his thinking his every footstep is in line with this word what is it doing to you and i what is this bible when it talks about every joint supplies to the ed the edifying of the body what's he talking about he's talking about today but he talks about the fifo ministry amen will bring the church to maturity to perfection until we all grow up into the head what's he talking about the head was never here till today that verse in ephesians is speaking up today it's all talking of today it's talking about the body every joint supply and christ is the head of the body what's he talking about he's talking about our day and that scripture is directing your life that scripture is moving you into position because you're a knee you're an elbow you're a finger you're something in this body and this word is moving you from a place you used to go to a new place it's moving you amen and it's doing things to you that you can't imagine people think you're crazy things go wrong i've lost my job this church split things folded up what's happened he's got to get you in position because the word already says it'll be a mini-membered body and there won't be one piece missing your life is just as directed if you be a c gene of god your life is just as directed if that prophet's life was things don't work out for you why because he's got a plan sometimes doors just open wide open and you couldn't imagine how i got this blessed why he's got a plan he's walking you right in his word that's why we come to this word and say okay lord this word is directing every step this word is directing everything i do show me in your word don't use my brain not my reasoning i want the mind of christ which is the word of god and show me bring back my memory bring back my memory lord give me that holy ghost reasoning lord that i might understand what you would have me do in this day give me the eye salve and take the scales off my eyes because if i can find it in the word and my heart has faith to believe it i can have it it'll deliver me it's worked in every age it'll work today john 19. verse 13 when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat and the place which is called the pavement but in the hebrew gobatha and it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour when was it six hour what does he do in the sixth hour he saith unto jews behold your king he reveals the seventh seal in the sixth why why did pilate do it in the sixth hour why did boaz give six measures of barley why did this little harlot have six husbands you know it probably bothered her for the rest of her days as a believer that i had gotten that sinful condition how could i have done it lord how could i have come to the sixth husband and little did she know little did she know that there was a purpose for the eternal word of god for her to come to this condition abraham no doubt abraham would have mourned saying why did i go to gerar why why would i have been such a yellow yellow belly not to defend my wife why did i even do those things little does he know 4 000 years later there's going to be a prophet on the scene who's going to pick up that story he's going to say see sarah and abraham had a body change because now the king of gerard wants to marry grandma he could have any fair young virgin and now he wants grandma and you know if if abraham had not failed if abraham had not left the land if abraham had not made a mistake there would be nothing for the prophet to point to to prove a body change if that little harlot had not come into adultery amen to the sixth husband we wouldn't realize that there's the seventh seal and if she's supposed to get married why did pilate bring him out at the sixth hour the word of god is directing everything you see everything in politics everything in finances is being directed by the word of god and who can resist his will it's already in the word you want to know why we're in the economic condition we're in you just look at the at the third seal it tells you where we're at you look at the trumpets they tell you where we're at it's already written in the word why because when it was time why is economics going the way it is why are we moving into this to this position that we're moving in why because when it was time for jesus to be born there was a taxation on the whole world the pattern is already set who moved who moved mary and joseph to bethlehem that wasn't reasoning it was a decree from caesar it was a decree from caesar that moved them to bethlehem why because an economic pressure came on the whole world and now there's laws written that are moving them where oh i can imagine joseph going down saying this stupid caesar and these dumb laws and i hate these taxes and why do we have to go and every step he's taking is being ordained by prophecy the word of god is moving his every move is being moved by the word of god why are we coming into a one world order because it's time for him to be birthed again why is economic pressure coming it's time for him to be birthed again it's already been written in the word the pattern is set now it's coming it's all taking place in the sixth day because nothing's in the seventh the seventh is a person now get this verse 14. it was the preparation of the passover about the sixth hour and he sayeth unto the jews behold your king and they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate said to them shall i crucify your king the chief priest answered we have no king but the pope will take the system we don't want your revealed word we don't want your seventh seal we don't want your crisis the mystery of god revealed we have no king but the system the pattern's done been set brothers and sisters that's why brother branham could come under the sixth steel in the sixth day being a man number six and he could reveal this scripture right here behold your king away with him crucify him so brother could come back and preach i indict this generation for what the second crucifixion of jesus christ why the king had been presented and they wanted the system what was caesar the system caesar was the pope at the top of the world system and today you take somebody the word of god and you say this is the king this is christ this is how a woman ought to live this is how a man ought to live this is what's godly this is what's holy this is a prophet and they say i don't want your king away with your king away with the man and every day they're crucifying afresh the lord of glory and they've already been indicted for it and now what is happening is the scriptural pattern is repeating in your life you say what's happening to me i just told them about the word and now they're rejecting and they're angry and it almost would kill it they almost would kill me what's happening the word is directing your life the word is directing their life the hatred for the word is already in the word everything is laying in the scriptures and everything that's happening every moment of the day is the scriptures being fleshed out on the good and the evil the antichrist system and the crisis what is it it's all ordained it is all written and it is all moving in step with this word right here i think it's time to lay down all other books your financial planning book is not going to get you anywhere because there's going to be a worldwide taxation what are you saving up money for the beast for this is my financial plan i'll show you financial planning in the bible abraham did the most unreasonable thing you could do for your future financial welfare he left his father's home his father's business he left his home he left everything that he acquired him and his wife they went out to a strange land to be a stranger in a strange land what if i come to you and say leave your occupation leave your work leave your father leave everything you know and go be a stranger in a strange land he was destined for poverty but several years later you find him with enough wealth he has enough servants born in his house that he can amass an army that can go defeat the kings that just defeated sodom and gomorrah that's economic planning you want to plan for the future you give god your every single moment and you let the lord direct your every single step and your future will be secure hallelujah it's in the word live the word you want to see there's all kinds of financial planning in the bible isaac planted during a famine when everybody else lost faith didn't believe it would work there's no water how am i going to water this seed just stick it in the ground you know god will take care of it and in the famine he produced a harvest and when everybody else was hungry he had grain what am i saying it's all the word it's time for the word or nothing not men's books of wisdom not man's best ideas what the not what the news outlet is telling you not what the experts of the day say because the experts of today will be the fools of tomorrow because the experts of 1970 look ridiculous today experts predict and later good job you got it wrong 100 percent of the time with human reasoning the sixth day the seventh is revealed and the seventh seal is not a thing it's a person and this is the record of the seventh seal this is the story of my life i'm an eternal being this is the eternal word this is the same thing that i am man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god what's this every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god this all is recorded and has come out of the mouth of god and we're not to live by reasoning we're not to live by education we're to live by the word faith civilization lives by it is written jesus winds up in the desert all alone led there by the holy ghost and he comes under attack by satan himself he's defenseless he's weaponless he has no goods he has nothing just in the wilderness 40 days when his body's in a weakened condition after fasting 40 days being weak in body no doubt the human part of the mind is troubled things are not working out right now the devil comes to him to try him in a weakened condition and the devil tries his first attack and he says it is written he tries his second attack he says it is written now he comes for the third attack and on his third attack jesus surely he's going to pull out a secret weapon he's going to do a judo chop something he gets to the third test and he says it is written what has he done he's left the example for us what was he the seventh seal on display when was he christ what are we the seven sea on display what are we christ and we are supposed to live the same way he lived we're supposed to defeat the devil the same way he defeated the devil this is our life this is everything to us brother brenham didn't come to add to this or take away from it he came to point us back to it he said we have no book but the amen i say that's good advice let's all stand musicians if you'd like to come i just want to say we stand here in the sixth hour we're in the sixth day since the fall of man the six thousandth year we are the number six because man is six here we stand and i can say to you this revealed word this open book this is your king behold i have spoken about your king today now the choice is yours what will be your response will you bow down and worship the king or will you say away with him we have no king but the system you may not say those words but your actions will absolutely dictate what you do with this jesus called christ when you're presented so clearly with the word today when you see the scriptures are alive and the book is open and it's nothing more than christ the revelation of god the mystery of god revealed is christ now an open word an open book and it's presented before you behold your king now we get to decide not by the words that we speak but by the life that we live whether or not we're choosing to bow down to this king and take him as our king or whether we're going to take the system as our king and every day we get to make this choice in every choice we get to make are we going to have the king are we going to have the system and i say god forgive me forgive me i have relied on my own mind or my own reasoning i have relied on decision making god forgive me lord open my eyes to see your word like i've never seen it before let me see it as the solution to every need i have let me see it as meeting the day that i live and let it see as the directing beam that directs my life lord let me see your word for today take the scales off of my eyes god wash my eyes clean give me crystal clear vision so that i can see this word alive today everything we have need of god take it out of your word and give it to us how many agrees that's what you want and i say the first thing we have to do is say god forgive me god forgive me so many messes i've gotten is because i use my mind my memory my reasoning my affection but i don't want to use that i want to use christ's memory christ reasoning christ affection we have the mind of christ the scripture says let this mind be in you allow permit this mind to be in you that was in christ and i say lord let this mind be in me i surrender god let's just pray dear heavenly father you know our hearts lord you know we're standing here lord and just quivering lord because your revelation is so real in this hour lord this is not bible verses lord these are not slogans or cliches or sayings lord this is reality we have come to the time knowing that christ is being presented to the world lord we've come to the sixth hour we've come to the sixth day we've come under the sixth seal we're under the sixth trumpet we're standing at the moment lord when the world is choosing lord you said in your word choose you this day whom you will serve but as for me and my house we will serve the lord god i pray that you would help us to forsake everything else lord all other thinking lord all of their ideas of man man all mixed ideas of denominational systems lord let us purge that out of our minds now wash us lord wash us by the water of your word and help us lord to see the word for our condition help us to see the word for the day we live in for every obstacle give us your word lord when you were here you showed us how to defeat the devil and lord you didn't quote memorize bible verses you were the word and you just spoke the word lord you spoke what had already been written lord and that's how you defeated the devil showing us that we will defeat him today by speaking what has already been written in your word does not the word say god let that be our favorite line let that be the word is spoken most across our lips does not the word say give us a firm foundation to anchor our faith lord take us to higher heights lord draw us into your word in deeper realms we give ourselves completely to you almighty god forgive us for our failures in the past and lord open our eyes wash them with your eyes that we might see we give you our life we trust in you pray to take us lord move us lord by your word direct our every step and thought by your scriptures we ask it in jesus christ's name amen god bless you saints i just want to say i love you god is doing something god is washing away all of the old all of the ideas i tell you we have mixed denominational thinking with the message every one of us have done it who's born and raised in denomination the culture has denominational thinking and we have mixed the word we didn't do it on purpose we didn't do it because we were evil people but we did it because we used our reasoning and i say god does not want his word mixed he wants this word left pure not to try to figure it out to believe it and to watch it made manifest i'm far beyond mixing i'm so tired of a watered down gospel that's not working and it's not because the gospel doesn't work it's because we have mixed our own reasoning with the message and say well that i tried that it doesn't work there's nothing wrong with this word let me repeat that there's nothing wrong with this word everything you need of is in the word everything you can overcome with is in the word every weapon every tool every building stone is in this word don't even hint that it doesn't work the problem is here and we need to take this word from a heart of faith and speak in lips of faith and watch deity move the situation we've got to come back to the word and the word only not our interpretation what did the messenger tell us say what the tapes say but it doesn't seem to make sense if i would just turn his words from here to here it'd make more sense say what the tapes say if it doesn't seem to add up the problem is not with the prophet the problem is not with the message the problem is with this and we need to say god i want more of the mind of christ i want more of the proper understanding give me more of this book oh i'm telling you when we start preaching like this is saying why would i read anything but my bible why would i get caught up in all this stuff that's out there on these shelves i want to have a better marriage so i'll go to the marriage section in the bookstore i'm so glad they closed down our bookstore you know how many people in christian churches are reading all of them books on that bookstore and having horrible marriages it hasn't solved one of their problems and if it has solved the problem it's because they're using reasoning and they have a strong willpower and they've got a formula and it brings a measure of success i don't want that kind of success this we've already been given everything forget all of that stuff we don't need a book about raising children a book about parenting a book about all this stuff we just need the word every book should talk about the word everything should be pointing to the scriptures we've got everything we need quit looking for solutions to our problems outside of the revealed word why would god give us a bible that's perfect and eternal and say okay since you won't get it or understand it or make it work you've got to mix it with reasoning and spit out please this works if it's not working in your life get on your knees and repent say lord there's something wrong with me because your words not failed give me the mind of christ give me the proper understanding let me see your word and let me put it in application and watch demons run away from my life watch overcoming begin to take place why all i'm doing is what jesus did i'm just talking like him all i'm doing is what i saw the prophet do take the word and apply it take the word and apply it take the word and apply it and it will work hallelujah let's sing something brother randy you got a song ah sing that song i worship you when i look into your i holy upon
