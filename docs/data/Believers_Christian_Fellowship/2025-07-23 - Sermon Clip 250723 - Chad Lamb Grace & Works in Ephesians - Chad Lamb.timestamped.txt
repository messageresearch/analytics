[0:00] Hey, listen. This is why um so many
[0:03] modern modern this modern teaching in
[0:06] the modern age throughout Christianity
[0:08] is God looks at my heart. It doesn't
[0:10] matter what I do.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; Everybody heard the extreme grace
[0:15] preaching that has become very popular
[0:17] in Leodysia because it suits the
[0:18] Leodysian nature.
[0:20] &gt;&gt; My rights, people's rights, right? and
[0:23] and and uh so now this extreme grace
[0:28] says God looks at my heart doesn't
[0:30] matter what I do. Well, there's there's
[0:33] a a a a measure of truth to what they're
[0:35] saying that God saved me uh separate
[0:39] completely separate from my works
[0:42] &gt;&gt; because when he saved me, I wasn't even
[0:44] born yet. Amen. And then, Amen. He was
[0:47] watching over me and securing me while I
[0:50] was doing all the wrong works.
[0:53] And he didn't save me cuz I started
[0:54] doing right works. He came and found me.
[0:56] Amen. When I was still doing the wrong
[0:58] works.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; So, so God from Paul's perspective, from
[1:03] the heavenly perspective, God is looking
[1:06] at he's looking for somebody who believe
[1:08] his word. Amen. And he recognized his
[1:10] faith and then he sealed his faith with
[1:12] circumcision. God is looking for faith
[1:14] and he'll seal that faith with the
[1:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; And for God, that's enough. You're
[1:21] sealed to the day of redemption. Faith
[1:22] was what? Faith was what acquired it.
[1:25] Faith was what triggered it. Faith was
[1:26] what apprehended it. Amen. And God
[1:28] imputed unto us righteousness the same
[1:30] way. Amen. But yet God wants his word
[1:34] made manifest on this earth. God wants
[1:37] his word to live in every age. He wants
[1:39] his word to be demonstrated in every
[1:41] age. Amen. So there's got to be a
[1:43] testimony to every age that the word is
[1:46] true. And that testimony is our works.
[1:51] And that's what man sees.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; And that's why works perfects faith
[1:59] &gt;&gt; because it accomplishes exactly what God
[2:02] sent us on this earth to do
[2:04] &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world.
[2:07] Listen friends, God sent us here to do
[2:10] works.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; But he never intended works to be the
[2:16] basis of our salvation.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; But he's got something for us to do. And
[2:21] that something for us to do is to live
[2:23] his word.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; To display his nature to be a
[2:27] manifestation of Jesus Christ on the
[2:29] earth in a many membered body. That's
[2:31] what he wants us to do. That's why when
[2:35] we say we have faith and don't have
[2:38] works, it's dead because it's not
[2:40] accomplishing what God wanted it to
[2:42] accomplish.
[2:44] But when faith is wrought together with
[2:46] works, not just doing something because
[2:48] somebody said it, but the actual works
[2:50] of God that's anointed by faith, those
[2:53] works, amen, are perfecting faith and
[2:56] accomplishing God's purpose on the
[2:58] earth.
