[0:26] what a day
[0:27] of rejoicing and will
[0:41] when we
[0:55] jesus
[0:58] [Music]
[1:02] amen flow through
[1:06] me holy spirit
[1:15] is that your prayer this evening
[1:27] flows through me
[1:31] [Applause]
[1:33] and as i lift
[1:37] my hands to worship
[1:42] and to magnify
[1:46] thy name
[1:54] spirit flow
[1:57] through me one more time
[2:09] [Music]
[2:16] [Music]
[2:20] spirit
[2:23] [Music]
[2:27] me
[2:31] and as i lift
[2:35] my hands to worship
[2:40] and to magnify
[2:44] thy name
[2:53] [Music]
[2:59] praise god i don't know if there can be
[3:02] any more wonderful thing that we
[3:04] experience on this earth
[3:05] than allow his spirit to flow through us
[3:08] that he would take control and use us
[3:10] for his glory
[3:11] and while we're standing let's turn to
[3:13] ephesians chapter one
[3:15] and begin there we're going to continue
[3:17] on
[3:18] with the thought we were on sunday this
[3:20] is going to be place sons part two
[3:22] and i just like i said feel the
[3:25] inspiration to continue on with this
[3:27] thought
[3:28] with this line of teaching and preaching
[3:30] and just until i feel not to anymore
[3:32] amen
[3:33] and i just want to take my time and just
[3:35] talk about it because when you look at
[3:36] adoption it's a huge subject
[3:38] uh it's it's very big it's a it's hard
[3:41] to to wrap it all up tightly in one
[3:43] little package at least for me it is
[3:45] and so just as i'm going through and
[3:46] studying amen
[3:48] things i see i'm just going to bring and
[3:50] preach the way god gives it to me and
[3:51] you pull and we'll just trust god to
[3:53] give us what we need in this hour that
[3:55] we're in
[3:56] and it's like everything else that we
[3:58] understand in the scripture and through
[3:59] the message
[4:00] amen there's maybe things that aren't
[4:02] new not brand new concepts or brand new
[4:05] terms
[4:06] but as the eagle spreads her wings and
[4:08] catch the updraft
[4:09] she circles you know higher and higher
[4:11] and she may circle in the same diameter
[4:13] she circled before
[4:15] but now she's higher and brother branham
[4:16] says when you go every time an eagle
[4:18] goes higher it can see farther
[4:20] it said its vision becomes better is
[4:22] what brother venom said
[4:23] so we may we may circle some familiar
[4:26] territory some terms and maybe ideas or
[4:28] concepts that have been preached before
[4:30] or scriptures or quotes
[4:31] but just keep circling and let's see if
[4:33] we can't see more clearly than we saw
[4:35] last time amen
[4:37] ephesians chapter 1 and verse 3.
[4:43] blessed be the god and father of our
[4:45] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[4:47] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[4:49] places in christ
[4:51] according as he hath chosen us in him
[4:53] before the foundation of the world
[4:54] that we should be holy and without blame
[4:56] before him in love
[4:58] having predestinated us unto the
[5:00] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[5:02] himself
[5:03] according to the good pleasure of his
[5:05] will to the praise of the glory of his
[5:08] grace
[5:08] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[5:11] beloved
[5:12] let's bow our heads and ask the lord's
[5:14] blessing dear heavenly father we thank
[5:16] you lord
[5:18] lord you're so precious to us and god
[5:21] this word is more than print on paper
[5:24] we know that this is you in print form
[5:26] lord your word has a life to it lord
[5:28] that life is your life and
[5:30] that life is our life lord and as we
[5:33] read this word lord maybe more than
[5:35] reading but may there be a revelation
[5:37] that strikes her soul
[5:38] may there be an awakening lord to that
[5:40] portion that's within us to be lived out
[5:42] in this day
[5:44] what i pray that you would speak through
[5:45] these human lips that you would hear
[5:47] through our ears
[5:48] in order that you would give us the the
[5:50] things that we have need of for this
[5:52] hour that we're upon this earth may you
[5:54] be glorified in all that's said and all
[5:56] that's done
[5:56] may you find welcome in our hearts in
[5:58] this place lord and lord may we go out
[6:00] from here lord
[6:02] a little higher lord with a greater
[6:04] understanding and a clearer vision and
[6:05] purpose than when we came in
[6:07] we ask your blessings in all things in
[6:09] jesus christ's name we pray
[6:11] amen if you can all be seated thank you
[6:14] very much and
[6:15] i want to go back and read in verse 5
[6:18] again
[6:18] because it's the theme of what i want to
[6:20] talk about having predestinated us unto
[6:22] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[6:24] to himself according to the good
[6:27] pleasure
[6:28] of his will so we know in this scripture
[6:30] like we spoke on sunday that
[6:32] he's predestinated us unto adoption
[6:35] uh he's done that so we've been
[6:36] predestinated according to his good
[6:39] pleasure
[6:40] to the good pleasure of his will so it
[6:42] really wasn't based on anything that
[6:45] we've done or had done or will do
[6:47] because god predestinated us according
[6:49] to his good pleasure
[6:51] so it's what god wanted to do but what
[6:54] he's predestinated us unto
[6:56] in this scripture he's not just talking
[6:57] about his predestinated us unto
[6:59] salvation
[7:00] or he's predestinated us to hear the
[7:01] message or he's predestinated us
[7:03] to be a child of god that's not what
[7:05] he's speaking in this scripture it goes
[7:07] further than that
[7:08] i mean it encompasses that but it goes
[7:10] beyond that because
[7:12] he's predestinated us unto the adoption
[7:14] of children by jesus christ to himself
[7:16] and this adoption brother branham really
[7:19] explains it to us clearly
[7:20] but but there's a word here in the greek
[7:23] that i'm
[7:24] going to try to pronounce but but in the
[7:26] concordance when you look up this word
[7:28] next to it it says from a presumed
[7:30] compound
[7:31] of word number 5207 and a derivative of
[7:34] 5087
[7:36] well we don't have to presume that it's
[7:38] a compound because brother benham said
[7:39] these things go together and it's what
[7:40] it means
[7:41] so for them it's a presumed compound for
[7:43] us it's a fact
[7:45] this is the way the prophet taught it
[7:46] but we'll take these two words that
[7:48] they're
[7:48] talking about that go together and the
[7:51] first word in this compound
[7:53] just means a son not referring to an
[7:55] animal not referring to just offspring
[7:56] but a human son
[7:58] an offspring a descendant of an
[8:00] individual
[8:01] and then secondly the second part of
[8:03] this that's in this compound to make up
[8:05] this
[8:05] understanding or the proper
[8:07] understanding for this adoption
[8:09] of children is the word that means to
[8:12] lay to put
[8:13] to make to a point and it means to set
[8:17] to put or to place so when we talk about
[8:20] the adoption of children
[8:21] it's really like brother branham said
[8:23] the placing of sons
[8:25] he made it very simple but that's even
[8:27] what we understand
[8:28] out of the out of the word out of the
[8:29] concordance that it's the placing of
[8:31] sons
[8:32] that it's not just the fact that you're
[8:34] a son you're a son before the foundation
[8:36] of the world
[8:37] you're a son in the mind of god you've
[8:39] always been a son and daughter of god
[8:40] you always will be a son and daughter of
[8:42] god
[8:43] no matter what takes place you're a son
[8:45] and daughter of god
[8:46] that was predetermined you were in god
[8:48] you can never be
[8:49] anything else but that but he wants
[8:52] these sons of god amen to be
[8:54] positionally placed
[8:56] here upon this earth in a position in a
[8:58] place in the body of christ
[9:00] to do something a specific work a
[9:03] portion of the ministry of christ
[9:04] that's been given to each attribute the
[9:07] plan of god
[9:08] the plan of god that encompasses all of
[9:10] his attributes every single attribute is
[9:12] encompassed in the plan of god
[9:14] and you believe you're one of the
[9:15] attributes of god from before the
[9:17] foundation of the world
[9:18] then god expressed you in this
[9:20] generation in this time for a purpose
[9:22] and that expression
[9:24] wasn't just so that he could bring you
[9:25] forth and he could say you're saved and
[9:27] you say i'm saved and you're a child of
[9:28] god i'm a child of god
[9:30] that's wonderful that we come to that
[9:31] realization but that realization amen
[9:34] needs to go further beyond the
[9:36] realization that i come from god and i
[9:38] go to god
[9:39] but i come from god and i'm called for a
[9:41] purpose and there's a position for me
[9:43] today
[9:44] and there's a work for me to do as an
[9:46] attribute of god to be displayed through
[9:48] this body of flesh
[9:50] in this time that we're in now and if we
[9:52] miss
[9:53] that we've never actually come to the
[9:54] right kind of maturity yet
[9:56] because adoption one way to for me for
[9:59] me one way to understand adoption
[10:01] is just maturity when a son
[10:05] you know brother rem tells us the story
[10:06] and he takes the he takes the
[10:09] analogy he takes the scriptures out of
[10:11] galatians amen where a son
[10:13] is no more than a servant and he's given
[10:15] over to governors until the time
[10:16] appointed
[10:17] amen and brother of them starts to to
[10:19] tell us when he's preaching adoption and
[10:21] other messages
[10:22] he starts to explain this how a man will
[10:24] have a
[10:25] a a land maybe he's got a ranch maybe
[10:28] and he's got different people in charge
[10:29] of different things
[10:31] and they they're raising sheep and
[10:32] they're raising grain and they're
[10:33] raising cattle
[10:34] and he's got different ones officers
[10:36] said over all of this
[10:37] but he's got a son and that son is an
[10:39] heir to all that's his
[10:41] but that son cannot become an
[10:44] heir without the right kind of character
[10:46] because that son will destroy
[10:48] everything that the father has worked
[10:49] for so we understand
[10:52] adoption this is what this is what he's
[10:55] brother benham's explaining adoption
[10:57] this son is a son he's an heir
[11:00] he's the heir to the father but because
[11:02] the father
[11:04] amen has a vision has a purpose for this
[11:06] son
[11:07] he puts this son under a governor under
[11:10] a tutor and brother said that's the holy
[11:11] ghost and the holy ghost is leading this
[11:13] son
[11:14] teaching the son the word the laws of
[11:17] the father
[11:18] and when the holy ghost reports back
[11:20] brother branham dramatizes it amen he's
[11:22] reporting back
[11:23] he says father he's just like you you
[11:25] should have seen him the other day
[11:26] amen he handled those sheep just the way
[11:29] you want him to be handled
[11:30] amen and when i give him the word amen
[11:32] he just keeps the word just
[11:34] exactly the way that you wrote the word
[11:37] and and what he's showing is in this
[11:39] analogy and the story and this drama
[11:41] that brother branham's giving us
[11:43] he's showing that this sign amen is put
[11:45] under
[11:46] certain tests and certain instruction by
[11:48] the holy ghost by the word
[11:49] amen so that he can mature into a place
[11:52] that he can be
[11:53] entrusted in a position a meant to
[11:55] handle
[11:56] things the way god would handle them to
[11:59] conduct himself the way god would
[12:00] conduct himself
[12:01] to be in that that position as a mature
[12:04] amen believer as a mature
[12:06] christian amen it doesn't mean as a
[12:09] perfect believer
[12:10] as a perfect christian but but as a
[12:12] mature believer
[12:14] as a mature christian that will begin to
[12:16] handle things
[12:17] by the word amen that will begin to
[12:19] handle things the way the father would
[12:21] and the way the father would handle it
[12:22] is by the word
[12:24] and so and even in the in the in the
[12:27] analogy brother branham gives or the
[12:29] drama
[12:29] he says when the holy ghost is reporting
[12:31] back to the father
[12:32] he's saying and i've tested him i put
[12:35] him through everything i'd
[12:37] i stomped him down
[12:40] amen and he come right back
[12:44] and he says i put sickness on him
[12:47] and he come right back he wouldn't quit
[12:49] amen wherever i went he followed me and
[12:52] i said i'm going up here and he says
[12:53] and this and the son to the tutor would
[12:55] say well i'm going with you wherever you
[12:57] go i'm going
[12:58] he said but it's a high hill he said
[13:00] i'll go wait if you'll just hold my hand
[13:01] i'll go wherever you go but it's
[13:02] treacherous but i'll go where you go
[13:04] amen and that's the report that he's
[13:06] giving back to the father
[13:07] amen that this son would never leave
[13:10] holy ghost leadership
[13:11] and would do everything according to the
[13:13] father's will which his word
[13:15] is his will amen when the father heard
[13:18] amen that this
[13:18] son kept the word amen and always
[13:21] followed the leadership of the holy
[13:23] ghost
[13:23] now he said i'll bring him to a place
[13:26] now that set aside a place and bring him
[13:28] to a place
[13:28] and let's set him before the people and
[13:30] give him the garment give him the ring
[13:32] brother says give him the checkbook and
[13:35] his word is as good as my word
[13:37] and and all of these things coming into
[13:39] adoption coming into placing coming to a
[13:42] positioning
[13:43] where now the son is given authority and
[13:45] a position and a place
[13:46] and his word is as good as his father's
[13:48] word
[13:50] but so when we come to this uh
[13:53] adoption that we're talking about the
[13:55] way brother brahman says it's not
[13:57] also it's not the end of the journey
[13:59] because now the sun is going to start
[14:01] conducting business on behalf of the
[14:03] father
[14:03] amen but he's still going to do it
[14:05] according to the father's word
[14:07] according to the father's will by the
[14:08] leadership of the holy ghost
[14:10] none of that is changing it's not like
[14:13] he's arriving he got to this place and
[14:15] he's done the you know he's still
[14:17] he's on behalf of the father he's in
[14:20] place of the father
[14:21] the father's wanting him now you go take
[14:23] care of this thing you go take care of
[14:24] this part of the farm
[14:25] you go lead the servants and and and and
[14:28] the people i've put in charge now you
[14:30] take leadership
[14:32] but never outside of the father's
[14:34] leadership and never apart from the holy
[14:36] ghost leadership and never outside the
[14:38] word
[14:40] and you realize that even after adoption
[14:43] the father can change tasks for the sun
[14:47] i want you to go sure up this part of
[14:49] the farm or this part of this state
[14:51] and when that shirt up i want you to go
[14:52] over here see when we come to adoption
[14:55] sometimes
[14:55] all it is is not all of this because
[14:58] it's a lot
[14:59] so i got to be careful the way i say
[15:01] things i don't mean to trivialize are
[15:02] all of this
[15:03] but it's really coming to a maturity in
[15:06] christ
[15:07] where god can trust you to do a work for
[15:09] him
[15:10] he can trust you to do something on his
[15:12] behalf he can trust you to take
[15:14] leadership
[15:14] over something or or some responsibility
[15:17] amen it doesn't mean that's all you ever
[15:19] do
[15:20] it doesn't mean that's the only thing
[15:21] you've ever called to it doesn't mean he
[15:23] won't ever ask you to do anything else
[15:26] like we went through last time you know
[15:27] brother branham he was called to be a
[15:29] minister he was a preacher he went
[15:31] he was evangelizing then he became a
[15:32] pastor and he pastored for more than 10
[15:35] years and
[15:35] and after he was passing before 10 years
[15:37] he was called into worldwide evangelism
[15:39] with the healing ministry
[15:40] now after that amen god really brought
[15:43] him to the
[15:44] the real purpose see there i go again
[15:48] i don't mean the real purpose it was all
[15:49] god's purpose but god always had a
[15:51] target in mind
[15:52] amen this was the seventh church age
[15:54] messenger before the foundation of the
[15:56] world
[15:56] this was the vessel he was going to use
[15:58] to fulfill the words amen
[16:00] and and uh in malachi 4
[16:03] and and he's going to use him to fulfill
[16:05] amen luke 17 30 is going to use this
[16:08] vessel to fulfill
[16:09] in revelations chapter 10. so that was
[16:11] the thing he was always striving for
[16:13] amen but along the way he would give him
[16:15] responsibility here
[16:17] amen to call lost souls he gave him
[16:18] responsibility as a pastor
[16:20] responsibility in a worldwide healing
[16:22] ministry and then an ultimate
[16:24] responsibility to put the sword in his
[16:25] hand for the opening of the word
[16:28] so when you come to this place of
[16:30] maturity
[16:32] adoption is a maturity where god now can
[16:34] entrust you with a work
[16:37] amen praise god
[16:41] if i could say it
[16:44] you know brother brahm says so many
[16:47] things about adoption and so many things
[16:49] about placing
[16:50] i mean you can you can go one way with
[16:51] it another way with it but i'm just
[16:53] trying to go
[16:53] the way that god has led me with it
[16:56] to with with an understanding that when
[17:00] you when we come to this
[17:01] place of maturity because god never
[17:04] takes away free moral agency
[17:06] we always he will not violate
[17:10] a law of free moral agency so
[17:13] so god he already knows what will be
[17:16] he hasn't expected end when we were
[17:19] created he knew
[17:20] that he knew the thoughts he had towards
[17:22] us to bring us to an expected end
[17:24] amen he knew our members when they were
[17:26] not yet fashioned in the womb he already
[17:28] knew
[17:28] what you would look like amen according
[17:30] to the scriptures so god already knew he
[17:32] had a projection for you had a goal in
[17:34] mind
[17:35] amen but god has so said his law that he
[17:38] cannot
[17:39] he cannot have this projection or this
[17:42] goal
[17:42] robotically he must have it by
[17:46] free will he must have a son
[17:49] that will desire to be a son and a son
[17:53] that will desire to act like a son
[17:55] a son that desires to be led by the
[17:57] tudor a son that desires
[17:59] amen to be led by the word amen and we
[18:02] can under free moral agency
[18:04] we can become lazy sons we can become
[18:07] amen sons who reject the tutor to go our
[18:09] own way
[18:10] we can be sons or daughters amen who who
[18:13] slough
[18:13] off in our studies and and cast off our
[18:16] responsibilities
[18:18] and and as we do that i mean i've heard
[18:21] it i
[18:22] i've heard so many things just like so
[18:24] many of you have heard so many things
[18:26] that make me cringe and things that i
[18:27] don't understand but but as you go along
[18:29] you begin to understand things better
[18:32] and you begin to hear people say things
[18:33] like well you know
[18:35] if if i was given the opportunity to
[18:37] preach you know i
[18:38] i'd have something to say or they make
[18:40] little statements like that or
[18:42] or you know i don't have anything to do
[18:44] or nothing to say and nobody will listen
[18:46] to me or
[18:47] and i wonder have you been listening to
[18:49] the tutor
[18:50] have you been following the father's
[18:52] instructions i mean if god if you feel
[18:54] cheated like you've not been placed or
[18:56] not god's never given you a
[18:57] responsibility or anything to do
[18:59] for the kingdom of god my question is
[19:01] what are you doing
[19:02] amen as a student under the tutor
[19:06] because sometimes we want to we want to
[19:08] cut amen and just get to
[19:10] get to something that looks special or
[19:12] get to something that looks
[19:14] uh in the eyes of man something that
[19:16] looks important
[19:18] but what was important is when that son
[19:20] learned all those lessons along the way
[19:22] and matured amen through every trial
[19:24] through the sickness through the beating
[19:26] down
[19:26] amen through every obstacle that come
[19:28] learn to take the word
[19:30] take the word take the word what was
[19:31] that son learning he was learning to do
[19:34] it the way the father wants it done
[19:38] amen and when we haven't learned that
[19:40] yes in
[19:41] lesson yet and we still want to do it
[19:43] the way we want to do it
[19:44] we've not come to a place yet where god
[19:46] can entrust us to do something on his
[19:48] behalf
[19:51] it doesn't mean we're not a son we were
[19:52] a son before the foundation of the world
[19:54] it doesn't even mean you're not born
[19:55] again and baptized with the holy ghost
[19:57] but what it means
[19:58] is is we have not yet amen given over
[20:01] our total will and utter submission to
[20:04] the leadership of the holy ghost so that
[20:05] god can
[20:06] trust us with some responsibility
[20:09] because how could he entrust us with
[20:11] responsibility we're not responsible
[20:13] with simple basic commandments in the
[20:15] bible
[20:17] so how can he how can he entrust us amen
[20:20] with
[20:21] with with song ministry or music
[20:23] ministry or
[20:25] or or deacon on off as a deacon or
[20:27] trustee or even
[20:28] teach sunday school how can you teach
[20:30] little kids if you're not teachable
[20:34] if the holy ghost can't take the word
[20:35] and teach you to obey the word how are
[20:37] you going to teach four and
[20:38] five-year-olds
[20:42] you see so we we sometimes want to do
[20:45] something amen
[20:46] but we've been given something to do be
[20:48] a good son
[20:49] be a good daughter that's the first
[20:51] principle
[20:54] so we've been uh called
[20:58] predestinated unto the placing of sons
[21:01] so your your position in the body
[21:04] the work that you'll do known before
[21:06] known unto god were all his works before
[21:08] the beginning
[21:10] before the foundation of the world he
[21:11] knew what would happen you were you were
[21:13] you were his workmanship created in
[21:15] christ jesus unto good works that he
[21:17] hath ordained that you should walk in
[21:18] them
[21:19] so there's a portion for each one of the
[21:21] attributes of god
[21:22] there's a work for us to do amen but but
[21:25] god is going to make sure
[21:27] that our free moral agency is
[21:29] surrendered unto his will
[21:33] only he knows how to do that
[21:37] brother brahm says in perfect strength
[21:39] by perfect weakness
[21:40] we need a place of yielding to the
[21:42] spirit instead of so much depending upon
[21:45] schooling and upon our programs
[21:47] our campaigns and all that we have we
[21:49] rely upon a cooperation with so many
[21:51] different ministers to cooperate
[21:54] we always say if we can get so many why
[21:56] we won't do it if we can't get so many
[21:58] we won't do it we won't go to the cities
[22:01] without that and then
[22:02] when we do that we are making it in a
[22:04] great big machine that's got a carbon
[22:06] knock in it
[22:07] see so we've got to get away from that
[22:10] that human ability
[22:15] we the first the first the first lesson
[22:18] i'll just say the first lesson
[22:20] in maturing in christ is get away from
[22:22] human ability
[22:26] quit thinking you can do it if you
[22:29] think you can do it i could preach i
[22:32] could be a song lear i could be a d
[22:34] if you think you can do it you're not
[22:36] ready yet
[22:40] i could do a bible study i could teach
[22:43] that i could
[22:44] if you think you can do it you're not
[22:46] ready yet
[22:50] we got to get away from human ability
[22:53] there's nothing wrong with saying
[22:56] you know god's called me to that and
[22:58] when somebody says
[22:59] you know you know we recognize gifts in
[23:02] one another and you say
[23:03] you know you're so good at this or i
[23:04] really appreciate the way you do this
[23:06] and you i mean you don't have to be
[23:08] ashamed of that
[23:10] you don't have to be embarrassed of that
[23:12] you can say i thank god for it
[23:14] like if it blesses you and it helps you
[23:16] i thank god for it
[23:17] amen that's why i'm on this earth that's
[23:19] what i'm here for amen we don't have to
[23:21] hang our head in shame or say
[23:22] don't don't don't don't ever pay me no
[23:24] compliment
[23:26] brother brandon had a discussion with
[23:28] the minister one time the minister says
[23:29] i just hate it when somebody comes up
[23:30] and thanks me for the service and
[23:34] brother said i'm just more honest than
[23:35] you
[23:38] he goes i like it when they say that it
[23:40] means that that they heard what i said
[23:41] it means that it helped them it means it
[23:43] was a benefit
[23:44] brother branham wasn't egotistical about
[23:46] it he didn't do it for the thank yous
[23:48] but
[23:48] it was satisfying to him to know that
[23:50] god was able to use him to touch that
[23:52] person
[23:53] it should be satisfying to us to know
[23:55] that god was able to use us to do
[23:57] something for his kingdom
[23:58] not in a way of pride not in a way of
[24:00] arrogancy amen so we don't have to have
[24:02] a false humility and say no no don't
[24:04] thank me i didn't have anything to do
[24:05] with just say
[24:05] i'm glad it was a blessing to you
[24:08] because that's the reality
[24:09] well i'm thankful that you were blessed
[24:11] i'm thankful you were encouraged i'm
[24:13] thankful that was a help to you
[24:14] because that should be the real attitude
[24:16] if you were blessed by something god did
[24:18] through me
[24:18] i am so grateful amen that god could
[24:21] take a pile of dirt amen
[24:23] anoint it with his spirit and place an
[24:25] attribute on the inside and anoint it
[24:26] with his spirit and get something out of
[24:28] this pile of dirt and if he gets
[24:29] anything out of it it wasn't because of
[24:31] the pile of
[24:32] dirt it was because of his attribute
[24:33] anointed by his spirit
[24:35] and if he can do that through this
[24:37] vessel i
[24:39] am thankful for that and i'm happy about
[24:42] it
[24:44] but i know it wasn't me i mean that's
[24:47] the reality that's the balance to it
[24:49] i know it wasn't me sometimes there's a
[24:51] false humility
[24:52] when somebody says no don't thank me you
[24:54] know no it wasn't me
[24:56] we know it wasn't you i mean come on
[25:00] you know you know you may write a
[25:03] beautiful song and the words just
[25:04] absolutely hit the spot
[25:06] somebody comes up and say thank you for
[25:07] that song you don't have to say oh don't
[25:09] thank me don't say anything i didn't do
[25:10] anything i'm nobody
[25:12] well we know you're nobody that goes
[25:13] without saying
[25:15] we weren't saying you were anything
[25:16] special we were just saying we
[25:19] appreciated your yielding we appreciate
[25:20] your obedience we appreciate a vessel
[25:22] that god can work through
[25:24] i'm thankful for that and if you're that
[25:27] vessel that god used in whatever way
[25:29] to be a help to be an encouragement
[25:31] whatever way god uses it
[25:33] and somebody comes back and says that
[25:34] bless me you should be grateful in your
[25:36] heart
[25:37] you should have something well up on the
[25:38] inside says i'm so grateful god can use
[25:41] this vessel
[25:42] with all my mistakes with all my
[25:44] failures with all the questions that run
[25:46] through my mind with all my doubts about
[25:48] myself and everything else
[25:49] god still can permeate all of that and
[25:51] do something to bless a brother sister
[25:53] i'm thankful for that
[25:56] we just need to be real with where we're
[25:58] at and real with things and no false
[25:59] humility and no
[26:01] none of that just be real don't think
[26:04] you can do anything
[26:05] we know you can't we we've
[26:09] we've been in this journey together long
[26:10] enough we know they're
[26:12] none of us are superhuman superheroes
[26:16] thank god god puts us in close enough
[26:18] proximity to one another
[26:19] that we know that you're not a superhero
[26:22] i'm not a superhero you're not
[26:24] superhuman i'm not superhuman
[26:27] but god can take the ordinary and do the
[26:29] extraordinary
[26:30] and when we see god take the ordinary
[26:32] and do the extraordinary
[26:33] it blesses our hearts amen it encourages
[26:36] us if god can use my brother
[26:38] to do that and god can use my sister to
[26:39] do that then he can do something with me
[26:41] too
[26:43] so we've got to get away from that human
[26:45] ability and what brother ben was talking
[26:47] about is trying
[26:48] amen trying to make something happen get
[26:50] a school of thought or coordination of
[26:52] ministers or get a group together to
[26:54] pull something off amen we've got to
[26:56] stop all of that we've got to get to a
[26:58] place where we can surrender our souls
[27:00] and lives
[27:01] even to the housewife to the farmer to
[27:03] the mechanic or
[27:04] whoever we are we got to surrender
[27:07] completely to god and know that we are
[27:08] nothing
[27:09] then let god start from there so i say
[27:12] that's the beginning
[27:15] know that we're nothing and then let god
[27:16] start from there
[27:18] then he starts moving working and that
[27:20] includes all of us
[27:21] everyone the thing that we got to do
[27:23] history proves does now
[27:25] proves that god always chose the
[27:27] nobodies to become his somebodies
[27:29] god takes the person that's nothing so
[27:32] i'd like to say
[27:33] today if god is using you to do his work
[27:37] then you're nobody
[27:41] so don't tell me or nobody i believe it
[27:45] because god takes the nobodies to do
[27:47] something
[27:51] 1965 things that are to be says you know
[27:53] what you ought to do
[27:55] said people believe you to be a prophet
[27:56] you ought to be teaching those women how
[27:58] to get gifts of prophecy and things like
[28:00] that
[28:00] and great higher things instead of
[28:02] little things i said how am i going to
[28:04] teach them algebra when they won't even
[28:06] learn their abcs
[28:08] when they won't even do the common
[28:10] things see the natural thing how you
[28:12] going to tell them hi
[28:13] things when you won't even start you
[28:15] want to get on the top of the ladder
[28:16] before you hit the first
[28:18] that's the reason you fall
[28:21] you get at the bottom and climb right on
[28:23] up as god leads you see
[28:25] cope your life in every and ever follow
[28:27] every bit of the word
[28:29] that god has ordained for you to do so
[28:32] i want to do something for god i want to
[28:34] do something for god
[28:35] first recognize your nobody and reject
[28:37] all human ability
[28:39] first step realize you're nobody you're
[28:41] nothing if it's dependent upon you
[28:44] amen nothing you do will ever come to
[28:46] success everything you do will always be
[28:47] a failure
[28:49] and just come to terms with that right
[28:50] out of the shoot i'm nobody
[28:52] i have no ability i can't do anything on
[28:54] my own if anything's going to happen
[28:56] through this clump of dirt it's got to
[28:58] be god doing it
[29:00] step one now i say the next thing is
[29:03] start at the bottom of the ladder
[29:08] don't give your heart to the lord have
[29:10] an experience with god and said i'm
[29:11] ready to go preach and you're not ready
[29:12] to go preach
[29:15] you've got to learn how to be a good
[29:17] steward of your money you got to learn
[29:18] how to treat other people right you got
[29:20] to learn how to not to backbite you got
[29:22] to learn how not to be proud and
[29:23] arrogant
[29:23] you've got a lot of things to learn
[29:25] before you can ever go out and do a work
[29:26] for the lord
[29:27] amen we're gonna start on the bottom
[29:30] rung
[29:31] amen and as the lord leads us to that
[29:33] bottom rung we make sure we get our
[29:35] finances in order we learn how to put
[29:37] god first and pay our tithes
[29:39] amen then we learn how to come to church
[29:41] every time the doors are open to be part
[29:42] of a body
[29:43] we learn how to get along with other
[29:45] personalities and different opinions and
[29:47] different ideas within that body
[29:49] i mean if we can't get on that run
[29:50] there's nothing else for us to do
[29:54] and that's why some people say well i
[29:56] could if i would but nobody ever picks
[29:57] me and they never think of me for this
[29:59] or
[30:01] i wonder why you can't pay your tithes
[30:06] yet the basics of the basics of the
[30:09] basics
[30:10] we can't even do that we can't even be
[30:12] faithful to church we can't even get
[30:13] along with our brothers and sisters
[30:15] how in the world can god bring us into a
[30:17] place of adoption where he trusts us
[30:19] with the work to do
[30:20] to work on his behalf amen how can he do
[30:22] that when we're violating his word
[30:24] all the time
[30:27] so we start on the bottom of the ladder
[30:29] and say god teach me how to be like you
[30:32] lead me by the holy ghost the holy ghost
[30:34] lead you to the word amen you recognize
[30:36] that god said i'm supposed to pay tithes
[30:38] it shows my
[30:39] respect and love towards god and my
[30:41] understanding that all comes from god
[30:43] that's what tithe does
[30:46] he say it's not just about money amen
[30:48] it's not just about how
[30:50] much money it's not just about the
[30:51] church needing your money amen nobody
[30:53] needs your money god doesn't need your
[30:55] money
[30:56] the church doesn't need your money god
[30:57] provides everything that's needed it's
[30:59] not about
[31:00] it's not about helping the church it's
[31:02] about serving god and recognizing god is
[31:04] god
[31:05] and everything i got comes from god and
[31:07] the only way for me to secure the 90
[31:10] is to give the 10. the 10
[31:14] is the security for the 90 percent
[31:20] amen when you give a tithe to god you
[31:21] haven't given nothing
[31:25] it's all it is i mean there's no puffing
[31:27] up the chest there's no being i paid my
[31:29] tithe today
[31:30] you've done nothing you just come from
[31:31] zero from below zero
[31:33] up to zero now you're at the starting
[31:36] point
[31:37] there's nothing special amen
[31:40] we go from there and we we we learn how
[31:43] to be faithful to church
[31:46] why because his word says to
[31:50] we learn how to love the brethren why
[31:53] because his word says to
[31:57] we learn how to have a positive
[31:59] confession why because his word says to
[32:02] and from there we go to the next run to
[32:04] the next run
[32:05] to the next run but we got we got we
[32:08] we sometimes see individuals who they
[32:11] want to get
[32:11] higher up on the ladder amen and they
[32:14] haven't even begun to climb through the
[32:16] basics yet
[32:18] so brother jeff said that's why you fall
[32:21] you're trying to get on the top and skip
[32:23] all these other
[32:24] rungs and it's not going to work you
[32:27] know
[32:27] god is patient amen if you think about
[32:30] his creation and how long it took
[32:33] to unfold his great mystery plan and how
[32:35] many thousands of years and individuals
[32:37] and seemingly going forward and
[32:39] seemingly going backwards and allowing
[32:40] men to make mistakes and using those
[32:42] mistakes for good
[32:44] my god is patience if i had to deal with
[32:47] what he dealt with through the bible i
[32:49] would have just said scrap the whole
[32:50] thing and start over
[32:52] but god knows what he's doing he's
[32:53] working something he's trying to get a
[32:55] character he's painting a picture
[32:57] he's playing out a drama every part is
[32:59] going to be there
[33:00] and he's going to work his body up from
[33:02] from the legs to the thighs and then
[33:04] to the hands up to the head
[33:07] that's how god does his work and he's
[33:09] very patient and he'll be patient with
[33:11] us
[33:12] we have to be patient with him first
[33:15] corinthians chapter 7
[33:23] first corinthians chapter seven i'm
[33:26] going to start with verse 17.
[33:33] first corinthians 7 and 17 but as god
[33:36] hath distributed to every man as the
[33:38] lord hath called everyone so let him
[33:40] walk
[33:40] and so ordain i in all churches is any
[33:43] man called being circumcised let him not
[33:46] not not become uncircumcised is any
[33:49] called in uncircumcision let him not be
[33:51] circumcised
[33:52] circumcision is nothing and
[33:53] uncircumcision is nothing but the
[33:55] keeping of the commandments of god
[33:56] that every man abide in the same calling
[33:58] wherewith he was called
[34:00] art thou called being a servant care not
[34:02] for it but if thou mayest be free use it
[34:04] rather
[34:04] for he that is called in the lord being
[34:07] a servant is the lord's free man
[34:08] likewise also
[34:09] that is called being free is christ's
[34:11] servant you're bought with the price
[34:13] be not ye the servant of men brethren
[34:16] let every man wearing his he
[34:17] call where wherein he is called there
[34:20] and abide with god
[34:24] so the apostle paul is telling us
[34:27] the way god called you stay there
[34:31] until god called you to something else
[34:34] but stay there
[34:36] even tell the soldier remain a soldier
[34:38] if you're a soldier made a soldier just
[34:40] do no man harm and don't cheat anybody
[34:42] but remain a soldier do no violence but
[34:43] remain a soldier
[34:45] so if you're a servant remain a servant
[34:47] if you're free use it rather for the
[34:48] good
[34:49] use it but if you're if you're free
[34:51] you're christ's slave anyway so what
[34:53] does it matter
[34:56] if you if you're called the way god
[34:58] calls you the way
[35:00] the way god calls you to stay that way
[35:02] until he tells you to do something
[35:04] different
[35:05] don't don't you know
[35:09] come to the lord give your heart to the
[35:10] lord and all of a sudden start looking
[35:12] around for something to do
[35:14] i need a job a lot of that is not really
[35:17] a love for god
[35:19] there's a lot of that that's really a
[35:21] love for self
[35:23] and the desire to be somebody to
[35:26] that seeking for a position seeking for
[35:28] a title sitting for word it's masked in
[35:30] all kind of religious rhetoric but it's
[35:32] really self-centeredness
[35:34] i want to i want a position i want to be
[35:36] somebody i want to be respected i want
[35:39] nobody says that of course they say i
[35:42] just really want to do something for the
[35:43] lord
[35:46] if you want to do something for the lord
[35:47] pay your tithe come to church love the
[35:48] brother
[35:50] that'll be doing something for the lord
[35:52] keep the word keep every commandment
[35:54] from the tiniest to the greatest if you
[35:55] really love the lord
[35:56] love the lord amen surrender to him
[35:59] follow the tudor
[36:01] obey every commandment and then do as he
[36:03] leads and as he called if you really
[36:04] love the lord
[36:06] so so so much of that quick i can i do
[36:10] this can i do can i have that i want to
[36:11] do this
[36:12] you know just wait
[36:16] be patient if you really love the lord
[36:19] love him in every area of your life
[36:21] if you really love the lord and you want
[36:23] to do something for the lord
[36:24] amen then you surrender your private
[36:26] life to him
[36:28] you surrender your thought life to him
[36:31] before you ever want to do something
[36:32] publicly make sure that your private
[36:35] life is matching the word
[36:37] make sure that you got overcoming in the
[36:40] private thoughts of your life
[36:41] and the privacy of your own home or your
[36:43] own room make sure
[36:45] that that is surrendered to god amen
[36:47] don't even seek
[36:48] anything else to do for the kingdom of
[36:50] god until god has a vessel that he can
[36:52] work through
[36:56] so we got to start on the bottom of the
[36:58] ladder
[37:00] we're going to make sure we got to make
[37:03] sure
[37:04] that we stay there long enough to
[37:07] realize we're dirt
[37:10] i mean we've got to stay there long
[37:11] enough to realize that
[37:14] i'm struggling with my own self-will
[37:16] like
[37:17] i don't want to do this thing that the
[37:20] holy ghost is leading me through
[37:22] i don't want to do this thing that's
[37:23] written in the word amen and you've got
[37:25] to stay there to you start losing
[37:27] all confidence and self and all
[37:29] confidence and human ability
[37:31] and you got to stay down there on the
[37:32] lower parts of the rung of the ladder
[37:34] under the governor under the tudor to
[37:36] realize i
[37:37] am a selfish self-centered self-loving
[37:41] human being
[37:44] and until you realize that you're not
[37:46] really to come to utter complete death i
[37:48] mean there's got to be a loathing of the
[37:49] hybridization there's got to be loathing
[37:51] of the carnal nature
[37:52] there's got to be something that you
[37:54] you've been there long enough to realize
[37:56] that hey you know what i am messing
[37:58] everything up
[37:59] everything i try fails amen i'm trying
[38:01] to surrender to god
[38:03] and i keep getting in the way and until
[38:05] you lose all human ability you're not
[38:07] ready to do anything for the kingdom of
[38:08] god
[38:10] so we stay there and you have some ups
[38:13] and some downs and
[38:14] some successes and some failures and
[38:16] it's all important
[38:19] god's what's god doing he's bringing
[38:21] maturity
[38:22] to his children bring us to his place
[38:25] where he can
[38:25] he can trust you to do something on his
[38:29] behalf
[38:31] and and so we we
[38:34] when when we're called we receive the
[38:37] new birth
[38:38] just stay what you are then until he
[38:40] makes you do something different
[38:42] and when you really see somebody under
[38:45] adoption under that maturity
[38:47] being moved amen you really see them
[38:50] you really see uh god
[38:53] moving people into position that don't
[38:55] want it
[38:57] i mean you see it over and over again
[38:59] not that they don't want to serve god
[39:00] i mean not that they don't want to do
[39:02] something for the lord but really
[39:04] that you you see people get moved who
[39:05] says oh lord you know
[39:07] i couldn't do that praise god lord i
[39:10] couldn't do that
[39:12] and he says oh that's exactly what i'm
[39:14] looking for
[39:16] god i i mean surely not me there's got
[39:19] to be somebody else that you would
[39:20] rather have do that
[39:21] that's really when you're getting down
[39:23] to something that he can use
[39:25] because we've lost all human ability
[39:28] and all confidence in self and then you
[39:30] see somebody struggle with that and
[39:32] finally they move into what god's
[39:33] leading them into and what god's calling
[39:35] and when they move in there amen they do
[39:37] it with the realization that i'm here
[39:39] because god wants me here
[39:40] i'm here because i want to serve god and
[39:42] i love god more than i love myself
[39:47] and then that's somebody that god can
[39:48] have confidence in
[39:51] brother branham says in the message
[39:52] adoption part 2 from 1960
[39:55] it says then did you notice moses that
[39:57] great miracle performer that brought
[39:59] down
[39:59] brought israel down through the land and
[40:01] brought them up to the promised land
[40:03] but did not place their inheritance to
[40:05] them he did not give them their
[40:06] inheritance
[40:07] he led them up to the land but joshua
[40:09] divided the land to the people is that
[40:10] right
[40:11] and christ brought the church up to the
[40:13] place where their possession was made to
[40:15] them
[40:15] was given to them just to jordan the
[40:17] cross but the holy spirit is the one who
[40:19] sets the church in order
[40:20] the joshua of today puts the church in
[40:23] its order giving to each one
[40:25] gifts places position and he is the
[40:28] voice of god speaking to the inner man
[40:29] that christ has saved
[40:31] the holy spirit now do you get that much
[40:33] of it
[40:34] now we're getting over into the book of
[40:36] ephesians now the same
[40:38] way he positionally placing the church
[40:40] where they belong
[40:42] now joshua placed them in the natural
[40:44] land now the holy spirit is placing the
[40:46] church positionally in the land
[40:48] in the position they belong in their
[40:50] inheritance
[40:52] so now we're with the holy ghost is
[40:54] putting the body the many member body
[40:57] into position by holy ghost leadership
[41:00] not by our own ideas or our own
[41:02] understanding or even our own wishes
[41:05] but we're moved and put in position by
[41:07] holy ghost leadership
[41:09] he goes on in the same message to say
[41:11] but now to place
[41:13] how are you you're first born into the
[41:15] kingdom by the holy ghost
[41:17] how many knows that all right next
[41:20] you're predestinated into what adoption
[41:22] what is that
[41:22] you're predestinated unto the placing
[41:26] and then i'll read the next quote and
[41:27] i'll comment on this we are
[41:29] predestinated to the adoption of sons
[41:31] now how many understand what i mean
[41:33] raise up your hands adoption we're born
[41:35] in the spirit of god
[41:36] sure receive the holy ghost and cry have
[41:38] a father hallelujah glory to god
[41:39] that's right we're children but we can't
[41:42] get nowhere
[41:43] we can't whip the philistines so
[41:46] there's a reason we read this but these
[41:48] two quotes together brother ben tells us
[41:50] he says you're first born into the
[41:52] kingdom by the holy ghost
[41:54] and then in the next quote he says we're
[41:56] born in the spirit of god
[41:58] sure received the holy ghost crying abba
[42:01] father
[42:01] but we're children but we can't get
[42:03] nowhere amen and the reason i say this
[42:05] is because
[42:06] sometimes i've heard people teach in the
[42:08] past that that
[42:10] that you know you have salvation
[42:14] but adoption is the baptism in the holy
[42:16] ghost
[42:17] but brother branham tells us you're born
[42:18] again by the baptist holy ghost and when
[42:20] you go there he said the pentecostals
[42:21] think then i've arrived
[42:23] he said you haven't arrived you've just
[42:24] begun you're a newborn babe in jesus
[42:27] christ
[42:27] now you've got to grow up so that's the
[42:30] way i understand and not to contradict
[42:32] anybody else's understanding but just
[42:34] the way i understand what brother ben is
[42:35] saying
[42:35] if we take that that you become saved
[42:38] amen
[42:39] some you become saved down here at the
[42:42] beginning but at some point when you
[42:43] come to adoption you receive the baptism
[42:45] hold it goes
[42:46] and then it contradicts everything else
[42:47] he says everywhere else
[42:49] it makes it very very confusing and
[42:51] brother ben can make it sound that way
[42:52] when he's teaching adoption sometimes
[42:54] because you grow up amen you add to this
[42:56] and you grow up into the head
[42:58] but but he's clear in this one thing
[43:00] that the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:01] is the new birth the new birth is the
[43:03] baptism of the holy ghost
[43:05] it's the seed coming to life it's not
[43:07] the end of the journey
[43:09] it's a newborn babe in christ jesus
[43:12] and that newborn babe hasn't hit the end
[43:14] of its journey it just
[43:16] got to the ladder
[43:19] you just showed up by the baptist holy
[43:21] ghost you just showed up to the ladder
[43:22] now you got to climb the ladder now
[43:25] there's a
[43:26] there's a thing there's something god
[43:28] wants to accomplish in your life
[43:29] and it was not just to give you the new
[43:31] birth amen the new birth was to wake up
[43:34] or energize or activate that seed that
[43:36] life that attribute
[43:37] that now has to go on display
[43:41] so it wasn't just the activation of the
[43:43] seed that god wanted
[43:44] it was the display of the attribute that
[43:46] he's after
[43:48] but to display the attribute he's got to
[43:50] activate the seed then he's got to grow
[43:52] up and mature the believer amen to be
[43:54] able to handle the position that god has
[43:56] ordained for that believer to be in
[43:59] so that he can have the expression that
[44:00] he wants in this vessel
[44:02] in this day
[44:05] so we have to understand amen what god's
[44:09] trying to accomplish in our lives
[44:11] if we don't understand what he's trying
[44:12] to accomplish in our lives
[44:14] then then we'll go back to being a
[44:16] pentecostal
[44:17] amen that the experience at the altar or
[44:19] the experience in my room
[44:21] or that experience at any time that was
[44:22] the finish line that was the ultimate
[44:24] that was the end of it all that was the
[44:26] thing that i was seeking and once once i
[44:28] found that
[44:28] i've really arrived and that's it that
[44:30] brother man said you just began
[44:33] amen you just began that experience amen
[44:36] that was that was the highlight of your
[44:38] life it should be it's the new birth
[44:39] experience it should be a personal
[44:41] experience to you
[44:43] but that just gets you started
[44:46] working in the works of a son with the
[44:48] tutor of the holy ghost
[44:50] to bring you unto adoption the placing
[44:52] of the sun
[44:53] where god begin to begin to put you in a
[44:56] position of responsibility and authority
[45:01] brother ma'am says further in adoption
[45:03] same message adoption part two
[45:06] ephraim don't want to stay one of them
[45:08] go over here we find
[45:10] that manassas just over here say oh my
[45:12] the lord's given me a good cornfield
[45:14] then here comes over here
[45:15] gad said well now now wait a minute said
[45:18] i'm supposed to raise oats but i'm
[45:19] going to get corn too hallelujah you
[45:21] ain't got nothing to do with corn
[45:24] get oats oats is your part to raise but
[45:27] i'm starting to separate out these
[45:28] positions in the body
[45:30] amen and he's using the type and the old
[45:32] testament from the exodus moving into
[45:34] the promised land
[45:35] and the holy ghost began to positionally
[45:37] place them by tribes
[45:38] in the positional placing by tribes amen
[45:41] determined by a prophecy that was laid
[45:43] down years before
[45:44] when these boys received their when when
[45:46] they received their names
[45:48] and then when they received their
[45:49] blessing from their father on his
[45:50] deathbed
[45:51] it was placing them in the land with the
[45:53] work that they would do
[45:55] and so now joshua was there under
[45:56] inspiration only goes placing them in
[45:58] the land
[45:58] and where they're placed with their
[46:00] title and the blessing of jacob
[46:02] is determining what they're supposed to
[46:03] be doing in that land
[46:06] but he says now they say manassas got
[46:08] corn amen god's supposed to raise oats
[46:10] but god wants to forget raising oats and
[46:12] raise corn because the corn looks better
[46:13] than the oats
[46:16] see oats is your part to raise you ain't
[46:18] supposed to hurt sheep when you're
[46:19] supposed to hurt cattle
[46:20] god wants to place the church but every
[46:22] one of them wants to do the same thing
[46:24] however you can't tell them a thing
[46:26] about it no no they
[46:28] still got that goatee nature but but but
[46:30] but
[46:34] brother branham said butt oh is that a
[46:36] goat or a sheep
[46:40] you're supposed to do this you're
[46:40] supposed to be here but but
[46:44] see you can't tell them that's right now
[46:46] isn't that true
[46:47] and you can't place the church
[46:50] when you get to that brother said you
[46:51] can't place the church because everybody
[46:53] wants to do the same thing
[46:56] they think there's only a few things the
[46:58] church to do and all those two things
[47:00] are filled there's nothing else for me
[47:01] to do
[47:03] that's not why did god call you
[47:06] why did he choose you before the
[47:07] foundation of the world why did he place
[47:09] an attribute within you why did he send
[47:10] the holy ghost to you why did he wake up
[47:12] to say what's the whole purpose
[47:14] if all the positions are full and
[47:15] there's nothing else for me to do then
[47:16] what are you doing here
[47:19] but if you believe you came from god and
[47:21] go to god there's a purpose there's a
[47:22] purpose for you breathing air
[47:24] there's a purpose for your new birth
[47:25] there's a purpose for you hearing the
[47:26] word
[47:27] there's a place there's a position
[47:28] there's a purpose
[47:31] we just got to make sure that we don't
[47:33] put our own interpretation
[47:35] that our own desire and mix it in with
[47:37] that
[47:38] first you have to believe i'm a child of
[47:40] god
[47:41] settle that and i'm born again filled
[47:44] with the holy ghost
[47:45] child of god you've got to settle that
[47:47] issue and know who you are and where you
[47:49] are
[47:49] and then let the tutor take control and
[47:52] then let god
[47:53] do with you whatever he wants to do with
[47:54] you
[48:00] let's let's turn to romans chapter 12
[48:03] and read through this together
[48:14] romans chapter 12. i'm going to read
[48:17] verse 3.
[48:21] for i say through the grace given unto
[48:23] me to every man that is among you not to
[48:25] think of himself more highly than he
[48:27] ought to think
[48:28] man i like that scripture not to think
[48:32] more highly than the author thing
[48:33] but to think soberly according according
[48:36] as god had dealt to every man the
[48:38] measure of faith
[48:40] it wasn't you it was him
[48:43] we can't think more highly of ourselves
[48:45] we're not good believers and good
[48:47] christians and good sons of god because
[48:49] we decided to do anything
[48:50] amen we just surrendered to what he
[48:52] already decided
[48:54] we just yielded to what he already
[48:56] determined what was his good pleasure
[48:58] before the foundation of the world
[48:59] we have just surrendered to that we've
[49:01] just acknowledged that we've just given
[49:03] him first place and has surrendered in
[49:05] an obedience that's all we did we did
[49:07] not
[49:07] make anything happen we did not make
[49:09] ourselves anything
[49:10] and god did not choose us because of our
[49:12] good character
[49:14] he chose us because of his foreknowledge
[49:19] amen verse four
[49:22] for us as we have many members in one
[49:24] body and all members have not the same
[49:26] office
[49:27] so we being many are one body in christ
[49:29] and every one members one of another
[49:31] having them gifts differing according to
[49:33] the grace that is given to us
[49:35] whether prophecy let us prophesy
[49:37] according to the
[49:38] proportion of faith or ministry let us
[49:41] wait on our ministry or he that teacheth
[49:42] on teaching or he that exhorteth on
[49:45] exhortation
[49:46] he that giveth let him do it with
[49:48] simplicity he that ruleth with diligence
[49:50] he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness
[49:52] let love be without dissimilation this
[49:55] means without hypocrisy
[49:57] abort that which is evil cleave to that
[49:59] which is good
[50:00] be kindly affectionate one to another
[50:02] with brotherly love
[50:03] and honor preferring one another
[50:06] see he's teaching us here that we don't
[50:09] all have the same gift
[50:11] we're not supposed to have the same gift
[50:13] that's why it's so
[50:14] tempting sometimes when we hear
[50:16] testimonies
[50:18] testimonies are a wonderful thing if we
[50:20] have the maturity to handle a testimony
[50:22] but in immaturity sometimes testimonies
[50:25] can be a detrimental thing
[50:26] to somebody's spiritual walk because
[50:28] when we keep giving a testimony of a
[50:31] certain way
[50:33] a certain way god works a certain way
[50:35] god did something
[50:37] through a believer then all of a sudden
[50:38] the picture can get painted that that's
[50:40] the only way that god works in this
[50:43] circumstance
[50:44] or or you know when when somebody will
[50:47] give a testimony when i received the
[50:48] holy ghost it was like fire
[50:50] tingling up and down my spine somebody
[50:52] else said i i ran all over the floor and
[50:53] spoke with tongues somebody else said
[50:55] i've broken the vision somebody else
[50:56] says i wept and wept and wept and passed
[50:58] out weeping
[51:01] but you realize if you could get if you
[51:02] could get everybody going online and
[51:03] give their testimonies you'd be all
[51:05] right
[51:05] amen but if you just keep hearing one
[51:07] testimony one testimony one way to
[51:09] receive the holy was one way that it
[51:11] worked
[51:11] amen all of a sudden everybody's
[51:12] starting to question whether or not i've
[51:14] had that experience or not
[51:15] and the evidence of the experience is
[51:17] not the actions within the experience or
[51:20] the emotional response
[51:21] amen the evidence of being able to
[51:22] receive the word for your day
[51:24] saying amen to every word amen amen it
[51:27] can come in a multitude of
[51:29] of different manifestations in that
[51:30] experience and different emotional
[51:32] outbreaks after you have that experience
[51:34] amen but the experience is you met jesus
[51:37] christ
[51:37] personally something inside you woke up
[51:40] and changed you
[51:41] forever permanently changed you and you
[51:43] receive every word
[51:47] so that's why we kee if we hammer one
[51:50] thing too long
[51:51] amen everybody starts to question
[51:55] i mean some experiences can be so subtle
[51:58] they don't have uh this fire up and down
[52:01] the spine they don't have this
[52:04] this experiences other people talk about
[52:06] but they absolutely know
[52:07] something in them changed completely
[52:10] what i was i'm not anymore
[52:11] and i can't explain it but something is
[52:13] totally different i believe with all my
[52:15] heart god and this message is everything
[52:17] to me and i believe
[52:18] every word of it amen where did that
[52:19] come from
[52:22] but because it doesn't match a certain a
[52:25] certain criteria
[52:27] people begin to doubt their new birth
[52:30] but i'm telling you there's millions of
[52:32] people
[52:33] that are maybe even billions yet that
[52:35] have expanded experience that fit a
[52:37] certain criteria
[52:38] but they've had no seed to wake up under
[52:40] that experience it was an experience an
[52:42] emotional experience on the spirit realm
[52:43] but there was no seed to activate and
[52:46] because of the criteria
[52:47] they feel security and a new birth that
[52:50] they've never had
[52:54] there was no real deep change there was
[52:56] no total change in the life
[52:58] and now there's no complete separation
[53:00] complete separation from unbelief there
[53:02] was no complete surrender and believing
[53:04] of the message
[53:08] so that's why we we can't judge
[53:11] ourselves among ourselves we judge
[53:13] ourselves according to the scripture
[53:14] and what brother brahm taught us in the
[53:16] message
[53:18] we we don't want to i mean we want to
[53:21] share our experiences
[53:22] i want to hear testimonies we've got to
[53:25] make sure our experience doesn't become
[53:27] the experience
[53:31] and our testimony doesn't become the
[53:32] only way
[53:34] read through the bible read through the
[53:38] god does it one way here and somebody
[53:39] completely different the next time
[53:45] so we want to make sure that we all
[53:49] have the freedom to be what god has
[53:51] called us to be
[53:53] and we all come to that security in
[53:55] christ
[53:56] where i don't have to do what you do
[54:01] or i don't have to have the gift that
[54:02] you have to be a child of god
[54:07] there's been too much replication
[54:11] in the message i haven't seen the
[54:13] message in christianity
[54:14] for 2000 years there's been too
[54:18] much of deciding
[54:22] what is best or what we should do or
[54:24] what god wants instead of just
[54:26] yielding and surrendering and be
[54:27] whatever god made you to be
[54:30] whatever god wants us to be whichever
[54:32] position he wants me to put me in and
[54:33] however he wants
[54:34] me amen if god looked after my
[54:37] great-great-grandparents and my
[54:38] grandparents brother bam said bread this
[54:40] one to this one
[54:41] you realize brother branham acted like
[54:44] he was a horse breeder
[54:47] like god was following pedigrees and he
[54:49] goes this one's got long legs and this
[54:51] one's got endurance and this one's got
[54:52] good wind
[54:53] i'm going to put these together because
[54:54] what i'm looking for i need these
[54:56] attributes to come together in the
[54:57] natural
[54:59] that's how people breed horses and breed
[55:01] goats and breed cattle for milk
[55:03] production and things like that
[55:04] it's like oh man she's got good capacity
[55:07] i mean there's a mammary system on that
[55:09] cow
[55:12] but the thing is she's got weak bone
[55:13] structures she breaks down too early i
[55:14] can't get
[55:15] five ten years of production out of her
[55:17] i this one's really strong bone
[55:19] amen i'm gonna put this i'm gonna put
[55:21] the bull that produced this one with
[55:23] this cow
[55:24] because i gotta get these attributes
[55:26] together that's how brother brahms
[55:27] describing your natural burst
[55:33] he bred this one to that one to get so
[55:36] much
[55:36] tin and so much copper and so much lead
[55:38] to get the chime with just that certain
[55:40] ting
[55:40] because there's part amen there's a
[55:42] music sheet that's written now
[55:44] there's a part for everybody to play in
[55:46] this great orchestra
[55:47] and brother bam said your part you may
[55:48] wait and wait and wait and wait and wait
[55:50] you're on the symbol and you've got one
[55:51] little ting to make on that chime
[55:53] but the masterpiece is not complete
[55:56] without the ting
[55:59] and so god bred this one to this one
[56:03] i love that only a prophet can say and
[56:06] god bred this
[56:07] and your parents just thought they fell
[56:08] in love and they didn't realize they
[56:10] were part of god's breeding program
[56:16] they had a natural attraction yes
[56:18] ordained by god
[56:21] they get this one with this one and this
[56:23] one with that one
[56:24] to get you just a certain way
[56:29] and we know that we picked up a lot of
[56:31] bad things in that breeding to this one
[56:33] to this one because it wasn't god's
[56:34] perfect will
[56:36] so that's why the tutor of the holy
[56:38] ghost begins to take the word
[56:39] and shave off some of that extra genetic
[56:42] material that came
[56:44] some of that temper that came and that
[56:46] selfishness that came through there
[56:47] and start shaving some of that off amen
[56:50] because
[56:51] there's a part that we got to play amen
[56:53] and as he's shaving down
[56:54] getting us to obey the word and
[56:56] surrender the word bringing us with
[56:57] maturity
[56:58] he's bringing us to that place that he
[57:00] had before the foundation of the world
[57:02] a certain work for us to do a certain
[57:04] portion to play
[57:05] a certain note to play
[57:08] and we got to trust god to play that
[57:10] note through us and you know sometimes
[57:13] the the uniqueness that we find
[57:14] sometimes in ourselves causes us so much
[57:17] contradiction within ourselves
[57:19] because there's some of us we just don't
[57:21] we're just not like anybody else
[57:27] amen because we're not just an exact
[57:30] match to anybody else
[57:31] somehow we feel like there's something
[57:33] wrong or i don't fit
[57:35] amen you fit exactly right
[57:38] if you look at an orchestra you've got
[57:41] 15 violins and
[57:43] five cellos and all kinds of trumpets
[57:46] and trombones
[57:48] but a lot of times you've got one guy
[57:49] sitting back here
[57:51] with a couple drums a symbol in the
[57:53] little chimes
[57:55] he's different than everybody else
[57:58] they're all sitting down
[57:59] they all have partners amen they play
[58:01] things together or maybe a little solo
[58:03] apart and then all the violins play
[58:04] together
[58:05] and the cellos and they mix together but
[58:07] this guy sits back there
[58:08] he watches everything and every once in
[58:10] a while goes boom boom boom
[58:14] everyone goes ting
[58:18] he hits the symbol
[58:21] he's odd but he's perfect
[58:26] he's different but he's exactly where
[58:28] he's supposed to be
[58:30] we have to quit judging ourselves among
[58:32] ourselves and just be what god called us
[58:34] to be
[58:35] get comfortable in our calling amen come
[58:38] to terms with the fact of whether or not
[58:39] we're born again child of god or not and
[58:41] if you come to terms with that and just
[58:42] say god i just want to surrender more
[58:44] and surrender more and surrender more so
[58:46] that you can use me any way you want to
[58:47] use me
[58:49] if you wanted me to be weird and that's
[58:50] what you were looking for then i'm your
[58:52] weirdo
[58:55] you know we got to come to terms with
[58:57] that and say god if you this is what you
[58:58] want
[58:59] you can have it all i don't want any of
[59:01] my own mind mixed in any of my own will
[59:03] any of my desire
[59:04] i just want you to take what you've made
[59:06] and i want you to get your glory out of
[59:08] it
[59:10] brother man says
[59:14] where am i at oh in the message as i was
[59:18] with moses so
[59:19] i will be with thee and when this great
[59:22] thing taken place when each one of these
[59:24] hebrew mothers and their travail and
[59:26] childbirth
[59:26] called out like reuben that placed him
[59:29] positionally in palestine
[59:30] exactly the way that mother said called
[59:33] his name
[59:34] i don't have it all wrote down here but
[59:36] but reuben meant sheepherder
[59:38] gad means cattle raiser ephraim meant
[59:40] cornraiser
[59:41] now by spiritual discernment joshua
[59:45] the new leader by the spiritual
[59:46] discernment placed each one where he
[59:48] belonged divided the land just exactly
[59:50] a very beautiful type today of what we
[59:52] need a joshua for today
[59:54] the trouble today when we are coming to
[59:56] our promised land
[59:58] god wanted to raise sheep like ephraim
[1:00:00] one wants to raise something like the
[1:00:01] other
[1:00:01] every man wants to do the same let god
[1:00:04] give one man a gift of healing
[1:00:05] every man wants the gift of healing
[1:00:08] ibrahim
[1:00:09] and gad and all of them wants to mix all
[1:00:12] up and come as one
[1:00:13] but we are divided in our positions all
[1:00:15] don't have the gift of wisdom
[1:00:17] all don't all don't prophesy all don't
[1:00:20] speak with tongues
[1:00:21] all are not prophets but god has set in
[1:00:23] the church
[1:00:24] some that prophesy some that speak with
[1:00:26] tongues
[1:00:27] we want to make them all speaking in
[1:00:29] tongues see
[1:00:30] how the confusion is then you can't get
[1:00:33] nowhere
[1:00:34] why the philistines would take them over
[1:00:35] in a little bit sure
[1:00:37] but when each man by a leader separated
[1:00:39] them by spiritual discernment and placed
[1:00:41] them into the body
[1:00:42] there they remained and became the cream
[1:00:44] of the earth
[1:00:46] god give a joshua god give us a back of
[1:00:49] joshua that'll hold that commission with
[1:00:51] the word
[1:00:53] see the holy ghost placed them in the
[1:00:54] land and they begin to take the land and
[1:00:56] drive out the inhabitants
[1:00:58] and they begin to farm the land and
[1:00:59] prosper and then david comes and begins
[1:01:02] to further set it in order and solomon
[1:01:03] comes to bring him to the great adoption
[1:01:05] age
[1:01:06] they become the cream of the earth but
[1:01:09] they had to be placed
[1:01:10] and they were placed they were
[1:01:11] positioned from birth
[1:01:14] because you were positioned from birth
[1:01:17] you were positioned from before your
[1:01:18] birth you come into this earth with a
[1:01:20] position
[1:01:21] your new birth amen burst you into a
[1:01:24] position amen and god is growing you
[1:01:26] into that position
[1:01:29] the brother bantam takes this and he
[1:01:31] starts talking about everybody wants to
[1:01:32] copy one another
[1:01:33] and they all want to do you know the
[1:01:35] more exciting parts are the parts that
[1:01:36] get used more often
[1:01:37] or whatever the trivial ideas of
[1:01:39] humanity are
[1:01:41] amen but he says see they can never
[1:01:43] overcome the philistines they could
[1:01:44] never drive out the philistines that way
[1:01:46] and he makes this comment in a couple
[1:01:47] places and he's showing the secret to
[1:01:50] taking all the land us positional
[1:01:52] placing
[1:01:55] see they can never come to the golden
[1:01:57] age of solomon's reign
[1:01:58] without proper positional placing in
[1:02:00] every joint supply
[1:02:02] to the effectual working of the body to
[1:02:04] the building up of the body in itself in
[1:02:05] love
[1:02:07] until everybody had their land until
[1:02:10] everybody
[1:02:10] worked their land till every officer was
[1:02:13] was overseeing till
[1:02:14] every levite was in position to the
[1:02:17] temple was in place the temple worship
[1:02:19] was in place the daily oblation was in
[1:02:21] place
[1:02:21] the songs were in place amen the worship
[1:02:24] was in place amen the corn
[1:02:26] and the oats and the barley and the
[1:02:28] sheep and the ox
[1:02:29] they were all supplied but they were not
[1:02:32] all supplied by one tribe
[1:02:36] the whole nation became joints that
[1:02:39] supply us
[1:02:41] until they were positionally placed and
[1:02:44] matured they may come to a maturity and
[1:02:46] come to a place
[1:02:47] to where every joint could supply and
[1:02:49] they could each hold their portion of
[1:02:50] land
[1:02:51] they could each produce what that land
[1:02:52] was capable of producing
[1:02:55] the rocky hilltops wasn't producing corn
[1:02:58] they were producing goats minerals
[1:03:02] right gold and silver
[1:03:05] but neither was the valley producing
[1:03:07] minerals
[1:03:09] ores and the different the different
[1:03:11] minerals
[1:03:12] each one was in their land drawing out
[1:03:15] of their
[1:03:16] land amen what they were drawing out of
[1:03:18] the land would benefit the entire nation
[1:03:22] so each one of us with our own portion
[1:03:25] of the word to live
[1:03:26] out amen under the holy ghost anointing
[1:03:28] when we're drawing out of that word
[1:03:30] we're living a certain person in that
[1:03:32] word that's designed for us to live
[1:03:34] there's things that only we can do the
[1:03:36] way we do them
[1:03:37] gifts of healing gifts of tongues gives
[1:03:40] an intercessory prayer
[1:03:41] gives a giving of exhortation
[1:03:44] of wisdom amen when we
[1:03:47] draw now to that word that land that we
[1:03:50] have
[1:03:50] amen positionally placed by the holy
[1:03:52] ghost when we draw it out
[1:03:54] it's not just for us amen ephraim didn't
[1:03:56] just grow corn for
[1:03:58] ephraim ethereum grew corn for the whole
[1:04:00] nation
[1:04:01] amen and so we're not
[1:04:05] just trying to find a place where we can
[1:04:07] get everything we can get out of this
[1:04:10] positional placing is about the benefit
[1:04:13] of the whole body
[1:04:16] not my benefit the benefit of the whole
[1:04:19] body
[1:04:20] because there's things that that i can't
[1:04:22] do that i need that brother for
[1:04:25] there are things that i cannot
[1:04:27] accomplish there's things that i have
[1:04:29] needs i have need
[1:04:30] i need you know i need somebody who can
[1:04:33] come and lead in worship and i can
[1:04:35] follow along but i can't lead it myself
[1:04:38] somebody who can play the instruments to
[1:04:40] create an atmosphere i can't do it
[1:04:41] myself
[1:04:42] amen there's things that we need each
[1:04:44] other for there's there's different
[1:04:46] knowledge in the word that we need
[1:04:47] different people specialize in different
[1:04:49] understandings of things
[1:04:51] there's different people who are
[1:04:52] encouragers people who have a gift of
[1:04:54] hospitality
[1:04:55] we've got to have one another and your
[1:04:57] gift is my benefit
[1:04:58] and i want my gift to be your benefit
[1:05:02] so that the philistines can be drove out
[1:05:04] and kept at bay
[1:05:05] because the only way that they could
[1:05:07] conquer the land is when every joint
[1:05:09] supplied and everybody was in position
[1:05:12] and brother benham draws this analogy
[1:05:14] several times
[1:05:16] back in adoption part one he says now
[1:05:18] who would doubt that that's what paul
[1:05:20] said
[1:05:21] that's paul scripture that paul wrote
[1:05:23] that's what they taught this church to
[1:05:24] church positionally
[1:05:26] before the foundation of the world when
[1:05:29] god and his labor pain
[1:05:32] remember when those hebrew mothers and
[1:05:34] their labor praying and then they called
[1:05:36] out reuben they called out god they
[1:05:37] called it evil and they were
[1:05:38] positionally placing them in the land
[1:05:40] now he takes that same type and he says
[1:05:42] before the foundation world when god in
[1:05:44] his labor pain
[1:05:46] was bringing forth bringing forth you
[1:05:50] knowing what you would do he
[1:05:51] positionally placed you
[1:05:53] into his own body to be a housewife
[1:05:56] to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a
[1:05:59] prophet to be this or to be that
[1:06:01] he placed you positionally
[1:06:08] god before the foundation of the world
[1:06:10] when he was in his labor praise to bring
[1:06:12] you forth
[1:06:13] he was bringing you forth he said to be
[1:06:15] a housewife
[1:06:19] to be a farmer
[1:06:22] we really really when god was bringing
[1:06:25] forth the logos amen
[1:06:27] i was in that logos
[1:06:31] but there was an expression in that
[1:06:33] logos that was for
[1:06:34] the year 2020
[1:06:37] and that expression was ordained to be a
[1:06:40] housewife
[1:06:41] to be a mother to be a father a man to
[1:06:43] be a
[1:06:44] a a farmer a housewife a whatever
[1:06:47] whatever whatever whatever put your
[1:06:49] title in there
[1:06:52] whatever you are amen god when the logos
[1:06:55] came forth when he was laboring to bring
[1:06:56] you forth you were part of that logos
[1:06:58] and in there there was a portion that
[1:06:59] was portioned out for this day
[1:07:01] with certain characteristics and certain
[1:07:03] attributes that could only be expressed
[1:07:05] in
[1:07:05] wife and father and housewife and mother
[1:07:07] and daddy
[1:07:09] and farmer
[1:07:12] and so you never want to say i'm just a
[1:07:15] housewife
[1:07:17] i'm just a farmer god in his
[1:07:21] labor pains when he's bringing forth the
[1:07:22] logos amen determined that that's the
[1:07:24] portion you would hold
[1:07:25] and that would be an expression of his
[1:07:27] very own nature and character
[1:07:29] and housewives don't ever say i'm just
[1:07:31] this again
[1:07:33] you're not just this i'm a i'm a god
[1:07:37] farmer
[1:07:40] you're not just a farmer you're a god
[1:07:43] farmer
[1:07:44] you're a jehovah farmer
[1:07:48] i'm not just a housewife i'm a god
[1:07:50] housewife because god wanted to be seen
[1:07:52] as a housewife in 2020. i'm a father i'm
[1:07:56] a daddy over children because god wanted
[1:07:58] to be expressed as a daddy in 2020
[1:08:02] i'm not just a dad i'm not just a lay
[1:08:04] member i'm not just a
[1:08:05] sunday school teacher i'm not just a
[1:08:07] farmer i'm not just
[1:08:09] a general laborer no i'm a god laborer
[1:08:11] i'm a i'm a i'm a god this i'm a god
[1:08:14] teacher i'm a god
[1:08:15] whatever you are it's god wanting to
[1:08:18] express
[1:08:19] himself in you
[1:08:22] don't you dare belittle that
[1:08:29] but i'm a retiree you're a god retiree
[1:08:36] you realize it's god desiring to be
[1:08:38] expressed and wherever he places you god
[1:08:41] wants an expression there
[1:08:43] don't ever belittle it don't ever
[1:08:45] trivialize it god before the foundation
[1:08:47] of the world knew it he placed it he
[1:08:49] ordained it he called it he led your
[1:08:51] footsteps he got you to a certain place
[1:08:52] so that he can express through this
[1:08:54] place through this time
[1:08:55] through these attributes don't ever
[1:08:57] belittle that ever again
[1:09:00] and sometimes we belittle it because
[1:09:01] it's not important in our eyes but i'll
[1:09:02] tell you one thing when he's bringing
[1:09:03] forth the logos it was important to god
[1:09:06] and if it was important to my father
[1:09:08] it's important to me amen and if he
[1:09:10] decides to plug me up and move me over
[1:09:12] here
[1:09:12] and he moves me to obscurity into a
[1:09:14] place that's not seen recognized known
[1:09:16] or heard
[1:09:16] amen if that's what he wants that's what
[1:09:18] i want i want to be satisfied with my
[1:09:21] portion
[1:09:22] i would say god if that's what you want
[1:09:24] that's what i want
[1:09:36] brother bram says in the message
[1:09:38] influence
[1:09:40] he said you'll never take another man's
[1:09:42] place
[1:09:43] and another man can't take your place
[1:09:46] find where your place is and abide there
[1:09:50] he thought well bless god i'm a king
[1:09:52] he's talking about uzziah
[1:09:54] lord has been good to me i can do this i
[1:09:56] i've got this this is my ministry
[1:09:58] i come to find out that it is going on
[1:10:01] like that and tried to go over and step
[1:10:03] over what god was blessing him at
[1:10:05] if you're a good lay member be a good
[1:10:07] lay member
[1:10:08] if you're a good housewife if god has
[1:10:10] blessed you as a housewife and made you
[1:10:12] loyal and true sister
[1:10:13] you just continue to be that don't get
[1:10:16] thinking
[1:10:16] god called you to be a preacher or
[1:10:18] deacon or something else
[1:10:20] and you to you do the same man wherever
[1:10:22] god has blessed you
[1:10:23] there abide because that's where he has
[1:10:25] set you at
[1:10:26] you do just what he tells you to do and
[1:10:28] see where he blesses you
[1:10:33] do not ever ever ever
[1:10:36] think that i'm just doing this until the
[1:10:38] next thing comes
[1:10:40] because if you get that in your mind
[1:10:42] that next thing may never
[1:10:44] come because he wants to have an
[1:10:47] expression
[1:10:48] in every station in life when you're
[1:10:51] single
[1:10:53] when you're working when you're retired
[1:10:56] before you're married after you're
[1:10:57] married if you're married if you're not
[1:10:58] married he wants an expression in
[1:11:00] every attribute in every way he wants an
[1:11:02] expression
[1:11:04] that's what god is desiring if he's
[1:11:06] allowed it to happen
[1:11:07] the footsteps of the righteous are order
[1:11:08] of the lord brother brahma said nothing
[1:11:10] happens without a purpose everything's
[1:11:12] ticking right on time in the life of a
[1:11:13] believer
[1:11:15] so if god has positionally placed you
[1:11:17] where you're at if it's widow
[1:11:19] widower if it's single if it's mary if
[1:11:21] it's with children without children
[1:11:23] wherever god has placed you amen there
[1:11:25] shine the light as bright as you can
[1:11:27] shine it
[1:11:28] because that's what he wanted before the
[1:11:29] foundation of the world
[1:11:31] that doesn't mean it's the end of your
[1:11:32] journey that doesn't mean it's the only
[1:11:34] portion you'll ever express
[1:11:35] but that that's where you are now come
[1:11:37] to maturity where you are
[1:11:39] now amen and let god entrust you with
[1:11:41] that portion of an expression today
[1:11:45] praise god
[1:11:51] praise god the member said in adoption
[1:11:55] part one
[1:11:57] he said well now many of them little
[1:11:59] pretty face mothers sitting here
[1:12:01] some of them 60 or 70 years old would
[1:12:03] say well what have i done brother
[1:12:05] branham
[1:12:06] you've raised your children you've done
[1:12:08] what you were supposed to do
[1:12:11] maybe some old dads sitting here say
[1:12:13] well i've herod the fields
[1:12:15] i've done this i never preached but you
[1:12:17] did just what god sent for you to do
[1:12:20] there's a place for you
[1:12:24] what would you rather do have a list of
[1:12:27] accomplishments
[1:12:29] that were outside the will of god
[1:12:33] or have done something that was
[1:12:34] seemingly small insignificant without
[1:12:37] notice that didn't seem to impact a lot
[1:12:39] of life but was exactly what god wanted
[1:12:44] see most of our ideas are
[1:12:47] self-centered and come from satan
[1:12:50] most of our ideas about what's important
[1:12:52] what's not important what offices what
[1:12:54] jobs
[1:12:55] what works are important and not
[1:12:57] important works most of that comes from
[1:12:58] satan because that's satan's mind
[1:13:01] wisdom and beauty and grandeur and he
[1:13:03] thought he could have a greater kingdom
[1:13:04] than the kingdom of michael
[1:13:06] how can you have a greater kingdom than
[1:13:07] the kingdom of christ it was the
[1:13:09] greatest kingdom there could ever be
[1:13:10] that meant he thought it was
[1:13:12] insignificant it was small in some ways
[1:13:14] inferior he could have something
[1:13:15] superior and if we start thinking
[1:13:17] inferior and superior in the kingdom of
[1:13:18] god
[1:13:19] that comes from lucifer there is no big
[1:13:23] eye there's no little there's no big
[1:13:25] amen it's all
[1:13:27] attributes of god which one is more
[1:13:29] important than the other
[1:13:30] the housewife attribute the father
[1:13:32] attribute
[1:13:33] or the preacher attribute
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:37] you understand when we start thinking
[1:13:39] like that that's the devil thinking
[1:13:41] but when we recognize this is all god
[1:13:43] how many trees of life
[1:13:45] you see if there's a tree of life
[1:13:46] blooming in every heart and there's a
[1:13:48] tree of life in every yard
[1:13:49] the bible's specific there's one tree of
[1:13:51] life and that tree of life has a
[1:13:53] gigantic root ball
[1:13:54] and puts forth stems and leaves and
[1:13:57] trees and fruit
[1:13:58] it may look like one individual tree of
[1:14:00] life but if you follow that route all
[1:14:02] the way back it goes back to one
[1:14:03] original life
[1:14:04] one original it may look like many but
[1:14:07] it's one
[1:14:08] it may look like many members i mean
[1:14:10] people scattered all over the planet but
[1:14:12] when god looks down he sees one body of
[1:14:14] jesus christ
[1:14:15] not many it's a toe it's a finger it's a
[1:14:18] fingernail it's an eyelash he looks down
[1:14:20] says that's
[1:14:21] jesus christ that is the body of jesus
[1:14:24] christ
[1:14:25] that is the temple of god tell me which
[1:14:27] stone you want to cast away or which is
[1:14:29] not significant in the temple of god
[1:14:33] amen see we gotta quit using
[1:14:36] carnal thinking that come through
[1:14:38] hybridization that comes from the
[1:14:40] serpent but we've got to see
[1:14:42] things the way god sees them i mean
[1:14:44] every time like i said every time we
[1:14:46] circle we go a little bit higher
[1:14:47] to have a clearer vision to recognize
[1:14:49] amen it's not insignificant it's not
[1:14:51] unimportant
[1:14:52] it's not going unnoticed but amen it
[1:14:54] doesn't matter if you're
[1:14:55] a single mother it doesn't matter if
[1:14:57] your husband won't serve god if your
[1:14:58] wife won't serve god
[1:14:59] if god's got you in that position then
[1:15:01] that's the expression he wants out of
[1:15:03] your life
[1:15:04] it doesn't mean that god's not going to
[1:15:05] save your spouse it's not going to mean
[1:15:07] that your situation is not going to
[1:15:08] change
[1:15:08] but today that's what god wants and god
[1:15:11] wants to be seen as jehovah
[1:15:13] amen that can endure that trial that can
[1:15:16] overcome that situation
[1:15:20] don't belittle it
[1:15:24] brother told sister media we said this
[1:15:26] sunday brother ben told sister mita
[1:15:29] are we talking about her ironing his
[1:15:31] shirts and
[1:15:32] packing his clothes and not saying one
[1:15:34] word he says and she wonders how she can
[1:15:37] serve god
[1:15:39] says you sisters you serve god as you
[1:15:42] serve your husbands
[1:15:44] and that wasn't just a trivial little
[1:15:47] pass off to give a little token to the
[1:15:49] sisters
[1:15:50] to keep them quiet and keep them in
[1:15:51] their place
[1:15:53] the prophet have gotten minutes
[1:15:57] see sister meter wasn't just a housewife
[1:16:02] she was the housewife she was the wife
[1:16:04] of the prophet
[1:16:07] she said she wasn't just called to some
[1:16:09] generic term
[1:16:11] she was a wife of a specific man
[1:16:15] who had a specific work and she was part
[1:16:17] of that work you realize
[1:16:20] you can say just a housewife oh yeah
[1:16:23] just a housewife
[1:16:24] you think sister mita was just a
[1:16:26] housewife you think she wasn't
[1:16:28] ordained to carry that burden she didn't
[1:16:31] think she wasn't ordained before the
[1:16:32] foundation of the world to be married to
[1:16:34] brother branham
[1:16:35] because he needed her and he couldn't do
[1:16:37] what he was going to do for god without
[1:16:38] her
[1:16:40] don't kid yourself she wasn't just a
[1:16:42] housewife she was an ordained housewife
[1:16:44] to a certain person with a certain
[1:16:46] ministry to be a support so that he
[1:16:48] could go farther so that he could do
[1:16:49] more
[1:16:53] i mean if he had gotten married to a
[1:16:56] pretty princess
[1:16:57] who needed all kinds of attention and
[1:16:59] all kinds of showering and all kinds of
[1:17:02] could he have ever done what he's
[1:17:03] supposed to do
[1:17:05] but god ordained this woman for this man
[1:17:09] she was more than just a housewife her
[1:17:11] reward will be great in heaven for being
[1:17:13] just a housewife
[1:17:15] because that's what god wanted her to do
[1:17:17] she wasn't just a mother
[1:17:18] she was a mother to the prophet's
[1:17:20] children
[1:17:21] specific children see we're not just i'm
[1:17:24] not just a father
[1:17:26] i'm a father to specific attributes that
[1:17:29] god brought forward
[1:17:31] and you have no idea what those
[1:17:32] attributes will be you have no idea
[1:17:34] where there's deacons preachers
[1:17:36] preachers wives you have no idea what
[1:17:38] god wants to do
[1:17:39] you're not just a mother you're not just
[1:17:40] a father you've been ordained to be a
[1:17:43] mother for
[1:17:43] these children and we believe that these
[1:17:45] children come from god are attributes of
[1:17:47] god
[1:17:47] being shaped and molded by the holy
[1:17:49] ghost leadership through you to shape
[1:17:51] and mold them to a position and a
[1:17:52] purpose that they have
[1:17:54] this is an eternal work amen there's no
[1:17:57] just mothers or just
[1:17:58] fathers amen we are ordained mothers
[1:18:01] ordained fathers ordained brothers
[1:18:02] ordained and ordained uncles ordained
[1:18:05] friends
[1:18:07] you think brother branham's friends were
[1:18:08] just friends or were they do you think
[1:18:10] charlie cox was not ordained before the
[1:18:11] foundation of the world to encourage and
[1:18:13] restore
[1:18:14] that brother when he was tired
[1:18:18] do you see what i'm saying friend
[1:18:20] brother brenham had a little oasis and
[1:18:22] can take in kentucky that he could get
[1:18:23] away to and squirrel
[1:18:24] and and he went there for rest and peace
[1:18:26] amen and charlie cox and his wife they
[1:18:28] created an atmosphere
[1:18:30] where brother branham can totally unwind
[1:18:31] and rest because he had to have that to
[1:18:33] keep going
[1:18:35] do you think charlie cox is not going to
[1:18:37] have a place in heaven amen for
[1:18:39] having a squirrel woods
[1:18:43] and knowing good places to hunt taking
[1:18:44] care of brother branham
[1:18:46] you think his wife isn't going to have a
[1:18:47] place for feeding them and caring for
[1:18:49] them
[1:18:50] keeping a home a place for brother ben
[1:18:52] to stay
[1:18:57] see if we could just get away from this
[1:18:59] whole idea
[1:19:00] if this one's more important than that
[1:19:01] one and this you think brother branham
[1:19:03] did that all by himself
[1:19:05] what about brother neville who would
[1:19:07] keep the church together and keep the
[1:19:09] church going while brother brennan went
[1:19:10] everywhere
[1:19:12] he couldn't have done it without a
[1:19:13] brother neville
[1:19:17] it wasn't he wasn't a one-man ministry
[1:19:20] he wasn't out there
[1:19:21] there was all kinds of supports all
[1:19:22] kinds of helps
[1:19:24] he had managers and he had church
[1:19:26] members who loved him and cared for him
[1:19:28] bought him a new suit every year amen
[1:19:30] and give his family turkeys amen
[1:19:32] and give and give jelly can jelly to
[1:19:35] give to him
[1:19:37] do you think that goes unnoticed by god
[1:19:41] that brother bam said you know the
[1:19:43] little sister she
[1:19:44] canned us some blackberry jam or jelly
[1:19:46] or whatever and set it on the porch
[1:19:48] and he goes that means so much
[1:19:52] you realize that that might have been
[1:19:54] the encouragement that that brother
[1:19:56] needed just to get out and preach that
[1:19:57] day
[1:20:00] you think that little old lady she
[1:20:01] probably that sister probably never knew
[1:20:04] that there was any real significance she
[1:20:06] just did it out of a loving heart
[1:20:08] she did it because she loved the brother
[1:20:09] and appreciate what he did and can him
[1:20:11] some blackberry jelly and didn't know
[1:20:13] brother bram said that means so much
[1:20:16] all those little tokens all those little
[1:20:18] things
[1:20:20] just go as god leads friends just let
[1:20:23] god use you the way he's wired you
[1:20:26] if god's made you amen and he put it in
[1:20:28] your heart to cook a meal for somebody
[1:20:29] and you just want to do it then
[1:20:31] do it and don't say well all i ever did
[1:20:34] the thing you did was the thing he
[1:20:35] wanted you to do don't trivialize it
[1:20:40] we've got to get beyond this humanistic
[1:20:43] understanding
[1:20:44] we've got to get to a deeper a much
[1:20:46] deeper understanding
[1:20:48] of positional place
[1:20:53] little mamas when you're at home
[1:20:56] rocking that baby and caring for it you
[1:20:58] have no idea what god's purpose for this
[1:21:00] life is
[1:21:04] you think john wesley's mom knew that
[1:21:07] she was raising a john and charles
[1:21:09] wesley
[1:21:10] you think she knew she was raising the
[1:21:11] church age messenger
[1:21:13] she didn't even know there were
[1:21:14] church-age messengers
[1:21:18] but god called her to bring forth
[1:21:21] charles and john wesley
[1:21:25] you think she doesn't have a reward for
[1:21:26] being a faithful mom
[1:21:30] you don't have to have a ministry you
[1:21:32] don't have to be on the radio don't have
[1:21:33] to be on the internet
[1:21:35] nobody needs to know your name
[1:21:38] but in his labor pains before the
[1:21:41] foundation when he was bringing you
[1:21:42] forth he knew what you would do
[1:21:45] and he bred your this one to this one
[1:21:47] and this one to this one
[1:21:49] to get you with that certain thing so
[1:21:50] you could do what he had in his mind
[1:21:52] before the foundation
[1:21:54] don't trivialize it don't marginalize it
[1:21:57] don't sweep it under a rug don't act
[1:21:59] like it's nothing
[1:22:00] if god calls you to do it if that's your
[1:22:02] position you stay there and be as
[1:22:04] faithful as you can be to that position
[1:22:06] if it's one thing do that one thing if
[1:22:07] you can be faithful to church
[1:22:09] be faithful to the word be a faithful
[1:22:11] friend be a faithful brother or sister
[1:22:13] in christ
[1:22:13] if that's all that god's given you then
[1:22:15] do it with all your heart
[1:22:17] give your whole self to it because
[1:22:18] that's where he wants you and that's
[1:22:19] what he's called you to do
[1:22:22] man i look around and i see things all
[1:22:24] the time i see
[1:22:25] this one doing this one for that and an
[1:22:27] encouraging note an encouraging word an
[1:22:29] encouraging text
[1:22:30] somebody taking meals and we really
[1:22:33] don't even realize what's happening but
[1:22:34] god is being expressed in it all
[1:22:38] and we can't trivialize it and say it's
[1:22:40] nothing don't say what you did for god
[1:22:42] was nothing if you did it for god it was
[1:22:44] something
[1:22:46] remember when i think it was was martin
[1:22:49] when martin was a little soldier amen
[1:22:51] and he ripped his little coat in half on
[1:22:53] a cold night
[1:22:53] and gave he could say well that really
[1:22:55] was nothing but to god it was something
[1:22:57] so much so that god would appear to him
[1:22:59] amen wrapped in that garment
[1:23:01] and say what you did to the least of
[1:23:02] these you've done and unto me
[1:23:05] as we yield what gifts and talent and
[1:23:07] abilities that we have
[1:23:08] and we yield it to the body for the
[1:23:10] benefit of the whole nation
[1:23:11] and then when we do what ephraim did and
[1:23:14] what manasses did and what reuben did
[1:23:15] when we do
[1:23:16] our little portion dig it out of the
[1:23:18] land and produce amen enough to have an
[1:23:20] overflow to go to somebody else
[1:23:22] when we do that amen it's not just for
[1:23:24] us it's for somebody else
[1:23:26] and when we do it for somebody else
[1:23:27] we're doing it for god
[1:23:29] when you do something for the body you
[1:23:31] do it for god
[1:23:34] it's god serving god
[1:23:38] it's my hand serving my body by feeding
[1:23:42] my face
[1:23:44] it's me serving me my hand
[1:23:48] my mouth my stomach my blood
[1:23:52] myself and when the body
[1:23:56] amen operates in the gifts and calling
[1:23:58] it's god
[1:23:59] serving god when you receive something
[1:24:02] from a brother sister in a way of their
[1:24:04] gift or something they give
[1:24:05] i mean you're receiving it from god when
[1:24:08] that brother or sister they give you
[1:24:10] something out of the word they just saw
[1:24:11] they give you
[1:24:12] a revelation that sparked something that
[1:24:14] was god gave that to you
[1:24:16] and when you give something back you
[1:24:17] give it back to god
[1:24:20] and these things matter when it comes to
[1:24:23] adoption
[1:24:24] amen it's more it's more than just
[1:24:28] when i come to adoption i'm going to
[1:24:30] have a ministry you have a ministry
[1:24:32] it may not be what some people label as
[1:24:34] a ministry but there's a ministry there
[1:24:37] to minister to who to god where is god
[1:24:41] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:24:43] okay so where's christ
[1:24:45] all that christ was he poured into the
[1:24:47] church
[1:24:49] how am i going to serve him by serving
[1:24:51] one another
[1:24:53] where i want god to speak to me speak to
[1:24:57] me speak to
[1:24:58] me he might just use his mouth
[1:25:03] which is part of his body which is on
[1:25:06] earth and it might be a brother or
[1:25:07] sister not a preacher
[1:25:10] it might be the one who lays in bed with
[1:25:12] you at night
[1:25:14] that may not have been your life that
[1:25:15] might have been god
[1:25:20] that may not have been your husband that
[1:25:21] might have been god amen
[1:25:24] we've got to wake up to the reality of
[1:25:26] who we are
[1:25:27] where we are not have slumbering eyes
[1:25:30] not be asleep to the reality
[1:25:32] amen not big important not important
[1:25:34] more important less important
[1:25:35] amen just say the body of god is
[1:25:38] essential amen
[1:25:39] and every member is essential to the
[1:25:41] operation of the body of christ

[1:25:45] little tip of my finger i want it to
[1:25:46] stay right there
[1:25:48] i love it all i love the whole body
[1:25:51] not just ministering gifts or the gift
[1:25:53] of a pastor this is tea i love it all
[1:25:56] right i understand
[1:25:59] oh god bless you friends we're going to
[1:26:00] let you go
[1:26:03] let's all stand musicians need to come
[1:26:04] i'm going to read one more scripture
[1:26:06] when we stand out of the gospel of john
[1:26:08] 15.
[1:26:11] and i'll read it to you john 15
[1:26:17] 16.
[1:26:21] jesus says to disciples you have not
[1:26:23] chosen me but i have chosen you
[1:26:26] and ordained you that you should go and
[1:26:28] bring forth fruit
[1:26:29] and that your fruit should remain
[1:26:33] before they ever had a chance to go do
[1:26:35] something
[1:26:37] he's just setting the record straight
[1:26:40] he said you know you're not going to go
[1:26:43] out there and do some great thing
[1:26:44] because you're a great person and you're
[1:26:46] not going to go out and do a bunch of
[1:26:47] works
[1:26:47] that you think is right he's letting him
[1:26:49] know right up front you didn't choose me
[1:26:51] i chose you
[1:26:54] i don't care what you thought i don't
[1:26:56] care peter that you thought it was a
[1:26:57] great thing that day you laid down your
[1:26:59] net and you followed after me
[1:27:00] you would have never laid down that net
[1:27:02] and followed me if i hadn't chose you
[1:27:03] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:05] you didn't do anything great you just
[1:27:06] responded to what you were to who you
[1:27:08] are
[1:27:10] you didn't earn anything by dropping the
[1:27:12] net you had it before you dropped the
[1:27:14] net
[1:27:16] you've not chosen me but i've chosen you
[1:27:18] and ordained you that you should bring
[1:27:20] forth fruit
[1:27:21] brother branham is proud not brother
[1:27:23] jesus is promising them
[1:27:26] promising them that you're going to be
[1:27:28] fruitful
[1:27:31] and that that fruit shall remain
[1:27:35] do you know what he just did to those
[1:27:36] disciples if they caught the revelation
[1:27:39] he just took all the pressure away
[1:27:42] he stripped all the pressure away he
[1:27:45] said before you even start before you
[1:27:47] try before you fail before you get it
[1:27:49] right before you get it wrong
[1:27:50] i chose you in ordain that you should go
[1:27:52] forth and bring forth fruit and your
[1:27:54] fruit will remain
[1:27:57] and i want to say amen according to the
[1:27:59] scriptures and according to the message
[1:28:01] that you didn't choose god god chose you
[1:28:04] and he's ordained you to bring forth
[1:28:05] fruit and your fruit will remain
[1:28:08] not because you got it right or got it
[1:28:09] wrong or you're doing a good job you're
[1:28:10] doing a bad job but because he
[1:28:12] ordained it to be so he's not looking
[1:28:14] for us to put forth the great effort or
[1:28:16] get wise or
[1:28:17] figure something out all he's looking
[1:28:19] for us to do is yield surrender deny
[1:28:21] ourselves
[1:28:22] get to take the leadership of the tudor
[1:28:24] the holy ghost and obey the father's
[1:28:26] instructions on all things and he will
[1:28:28] do what he's ordained to do
[1:28:31] he's not looking for your work he's
[1:28:32] looking for your surrender
[1:28:34] he's already ordained the works he's
[1:28:36] already ordained the fruit he's not
[1:28:37] looking for your fruitfulness he's
[1:28:39] looking for your surrender so he can
[1:28:40] bring forth the fruitfulness that he's
[1:28:42] promised what did he just do for us
[1:28:46] he took all the pressure away don't feel
[1:28:49] any pressure friends
[1:28:51] the only pressure you got is to wrestle
[1:28:53] with this guy here and bring it subject
[1:28:56] to the leadership of the holy ghost
[1:28:57] that's all you got to worry about you're
[1:28:59] not going to worry about should i do
[1:29:00] this should i do you just take this guy
[1:29:01] and you crucify this flesh every day
[1:29:04] you just you just keep under your body
[1:29:06] beat it black and blue
[1:29:08] like paul said you just be diligent
[1:29:10] you'd be
[1:29:11] you'd be diligent to keep this guy
[1:29:13] surrendered to the holy ghost
[1:29:16] and god has already ordained what we're
[1:29:18] gonna do
[1:29:19] praise god let's sing got a song
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:36] brothers
[1:29:40] i will go
[1:29:45] you have called me
[1:29:50] and i will answer
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:29] i will answer
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:43] amen we're gonna bow our heads and pray
[1:30:48] i just want to say don't don't put off
[1:30:51] obedience
[1:30:52] don't put off surrender don't get in
[1:30:55] your mind
[1:30:56] if god would ever call me to preach i'd
[1:30:58] have to give this up
[1:31:01] if that thought ever crossed your mind
[1:31:03] then you're no position that means give
[1:31:04] it up now
[1:31:05] whether he calls you to preach or not if
[1:31:07] i was a deacon we couldn't do this as a
[1:31:09] family
[1:31:10] wrong thinking we're at the totally
[1:31:12] we're on the wrong end of the spectrum
[1:31:16] we like to live a surrendered life today
[1:31:19] not because of my title not because i'm
[1:31:22] a pastor or because i'm a preacher i'm a
[1:31:24] deacon i'm a trusted church i have to
[1:31:26] alter my lifestyle
[1:31:27] if that's the way they're thinking then
[1:31:29] you're not fit to be a deacon or a
[1:31:30] trustee or a preacher
[1:31:33] because we serve god first as children
[1:31:35] of god and then god has ordained a place
[1:31:37] for us to be
[1:31:38] but that place does not change our
[1:31:40] obedience as a child of god
[1:31:43] today is the day to fully surrender
[1:31:45] right now is the moment to lay it all
[1:31:47] down
[1:31:48] quit looking around if i'm this or if
[1:31:50] i'm that i'll change this or i'll be
[1:31:52] this or
[1:31:52] i'm preparing for that you just lay your
[1:31:54] life down and surrender it all
[1:31:56] and obey everything the holy ghost is
[1:31:59] leading
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:00] fully surrender and let god do whatever
[1:32:03] god wants to do
[1:32:05] let god let god unfold his eternal plan
[1:32:09] in our lives but let us surrender now
[1:32:13] let us commit ourselves to god afresh
[1:32:15] and say god i give you
[1:32:17] everything right now if if if there's
[1:32:19] nothing
[1:32:20] ever happens further than what's
[1:32:22] happened now i surrender absolutely
[1:32:24] everything to you
[1:32:25] if you want me to be no more than a good
[1:32:27] lay member amen i want to be the best
[1:32:29] lay member that's ever been on the face
[1:32:31] of the earth
[1:32:33] i want to surrender all let's bow our
[1:32:36] heads and pray lord jesus god i just

[1:33:21] foundation of the world
[1:33:23] you've called us to be the final voice
[1:33:25] in the final age
