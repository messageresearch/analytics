TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so abimelech is acting righteous that's why government and reformation is never going to produce a seed of god it is never going to produce a bride there's no reformation we're not reformers we're not trying to change people's lives by being kind and nice to them and encourage them and have a buddy system amen the only way to change their life is give them the word of god if they take the word of god the spirit of god will come and they will be changed [Music] man we're not here to counsel you along counsel your law counsel you alone that's human efforts and human efforts will fail we are here to take the word and put the word in the situation when you receive that word there's a life that comes at that word and it has the power of transformation and if there's a seed of god in there that can receive that word amen that's got a power of transformation already built into the seed i don't care how low down your flesh has been and i don't care how vile and what kind of vile acts that you have died i don't care how shameful and embarrassed amen your life has been the power of transformation is not in your mind the power of transformation is in that seed and all that seed needs is the light the spoken word of god to hit that seed and it'll come to life and the power to transform wrong thinking wrong actions wrong habits is already there it was put in you before the foundation of the world when your name was put in the lamb's book of life god was ensuring that his purpose would not be defeated when he put a portion of himself and attributed to you to come forth in this day he was guaranteeing that nothing would disrupt his plan why because before he allowed this earth to fall into chaos after genesis 1 i don't know what happened but something happened and he allowed it to happen because he was foreshadowing what was going to happen to you and before the chaos broke out that would have an earth and judgment and chaos he made sure there was some good seeds that got down in that ground so nothing would defeat his purpose [Music] hey amen amen it's not you it's him get the whole idea of you out of the picture all this idea of i can't do it and i can't live enough and i've tried and failed forget it just surrender to the word and say god give me all of that word every bit that i can get and stay with the word friends i've seen so many people jump in and jump out jump in and jump out and jump in and jump out and say i just can't have victory i just can't stop failing you stick with the word don't leave it no matter what happens how discouraged you get how bad how much sin and backsliding you stay with that word until it changes your life because the seed of god will stay with that word they won't leave it they'll stick with it and the power of transformation will change that life
