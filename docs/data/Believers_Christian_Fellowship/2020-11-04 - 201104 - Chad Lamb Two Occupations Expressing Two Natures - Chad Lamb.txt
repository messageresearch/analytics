just worship him amen and while you're standing let's take our bibles and turn to genesis chapter four i'd like to begin reading in genesis chapter four and then we'll let you be seated and say god bless you sister jackie mae i appreciated that special appreciate her driving all the way over from indiana just to sing it and share it with us and praise god and thank god for that may the lord give you a safe trip home tonight as well amen isn't it amazing the world's in chaos country's in chaos there's turmoil everywhere but there's peace in our hearts to worship the lord and know all is under control there's nothing the clock is ticking right on time there's nothing out of kilter all these things has to be this way god raises kings and he lowers kings he raises nations and he lowers nations god does whatsoever god wants to do and nothing's going to happen outside of his plan and so turmoil and stress and but praise god we're happy people we can smile and sing as praises because we're free we're free from the need for politic politics to fix anything for us brother rem said all politics are of the devil it's not going to fix anything for us but there's a promise that's given to us and that's what we set our heights above and more than anything the chaos all the chaos does is give me just a greater desire to look above to keep looking up because there's nothing here to hope for friends there's nothing to hope for there's no help on earth there's there's no fixing this it won't get fixed it'll get worse and worse and worse until it goes into absolute ruin and destruction but we're going higher and higher and higher in christ let's look at genesis chapter four verse one and adam knew eva's wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord and she again bears brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father for your goodness to us for your mercy and your grace lord for the peace that's in our heart and the joy that we have within us for we've heard the good report and we believe it lord and it means everything to us and lord as we look into your word tonight we just pray father that you would just open it to us that you give us understanding lord and read by revelation that we might know what it is you're trying to speak to us in this hour and lord may we gain strength from this for this life that you've called us to live may word by word you have greater preeminence in your bride and may we walk according to your will and your word in jesus name we pray amen you can all be seated keep your bibles open we're going to look at this scripture but i want to refer back to sunday just for a minute i'm not going to preach on that i've got another subject but but just the three things that i sealed the notes because i didn't wrap that up at the end just so you would have it three things that have sealed the notes ownership security and a finished work so the greatest thing ever was that there was a sealed book in heaven because that sealed book in heaven means that the contents of that book were declared that there was an owner of the content of the book because it's the lamb's book of life amen that the the contents are secure to the destination and that it's a finished work it was finished before the seals were put on and so we we we thank god for that and you know we talked quite a bit about seals and and the breaking of seals and opening of seals and you realize many many times things are sealed in the scriptures and open in the scriptures and sealed to one group and opened to another jesus spoke in parables amen so that seeing they wouldn't see because the the revelation of the parable was still sealed to them but to the disciples it was unsealed so the same thing it's when we talk about the ceiling and the seals it's not always the physical uh physical clay it's not always the physical impression that we're talking about amen god can hide and god can reveal god can seal and god can open god can have it open and sealed at the same time so we've got to move away from the physical understanding only amen and when i say that i don't in any way try to get away from the fact that there may be a physical representation there may be a physical because you know when the when the judgments are said and the books are open i'm not taking away from the fact that god may have in heaven a physical representation but if that's all we can see we limit ourselves in the revelation of the word for instance when when man fell and he was cast out of the garden and now there was cherubim with a flaming sword put to turn every which way that keep the way of the tree of life it was a sealing of the way of the tree of life it was now sealed amen there was going to come a time that that way would be unsealed and those cherubim were there to keep or guard or preserve the way to the tree of life so man was sealed out of the tree of life but the way to the tree of life was under the seal and so that seal it wasn't a physical a stamp or a piece of clay with an impression i mean it was a cherubim with a flaming sword amen to keep them to drive them back amen from the tree of life amen but once that that that blade had been covered in blood and then it was sheathed and now the seal was open to go back to the tree of life and now the cherubim job that was keeping the way of the tree of life was to ensure that the seed of god made it back to the tree of life so the very ones that were responsible for the seal with the flaming sword amen were the now the the requirement was satisfied with the blood of the lamb the sword was put away and now it was unsealed or opened and now through a process of the cherubim the four-faced cherubim amen that cherubim who was sealing the way keeping the way now the way is open and he's going to make sure that the children of god get back to the tree of life and they'll do it first by a lion anointing remember four faces to the cherubim four living creatures around the throne first he'll begin to usher them back to the tree of life through the lion anointing then through the ox anointing then through the man anointing and finally the fourth face of the cherubim where the fourth beast was the flying eagle and the eagle anointing will make sure the last stage of the journey is secure under the eagle anointing to get man back to the tree of life amen so when i preach on these things i don't ever want to take away from the fact or maybe literal representation we may see something over there i don't know but but we don't want to lock ourselves into physical furniture and physical placements and physical seals only because we're going to miss everything else he's been trying to tell us god works through symbology and and in symbols and he's trying to relay a revelation because the great mystery the great mystery of god had been sealed up in god for all this time and now he's letting it out i mean let's turn our attention now if we can to genesis chapter four and i want to move on with another thought i had while i was on vacation with the family i'd covered this topic in a in a uh devotion with the family and i just thought it was this cute little thought a little devotion and all of a sudden it just began to blossom you know it's one of those things that began to open up and i thought the kids would enjoy it and relate to it and all of a sudden i began to enjoy it and relate to it and so i want to i want to open this up if we could pull up the powerpoint and we want to look at this i want to discuss two occupations expressing two natures two occupations expressing two natures i think you'll see quite quickly what we're talking about nothing here is complicated but oh is it really wonderful brother benham told us he said if you don't see christ in every verse and every line of the bible go back and read it again for you missed something and once you've once we've been given the eagle vision of the word i mean we've been able under an eagle anointing to fly up high enough above creeds and denominations and doctrines and and time restrictions and time elements and get up high enough to where you can see genesis the revelation to see what the hearts cry hearts desire that god was all along and now begin to see the fulfillment of that when you see that you see that this is one story this is one purpose and one desire that god had in the back part of his mind and he's been slowly letting it out amen and and this is the one achievement that he wanted to achieve and when you see that now you can go see christ in every line without that revelation i don't know how you can see christ in every line but once you see i would say once you get the big picture now every picture has to match the big picture every story matches the main story every every happening every every character has to portray that character amen and so now we begin to look at the bible this way and it begins to open up to us a deeper understanding let's read again the the uh chapter four verse one and we'll read a little further and adam knew his wife he adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord and she again bears brother abel and abel was a keeper of the sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground there's your two occupations one was the keeper of sheep and one was a tiller of the ground and we want to show that there's two occupations that show two natures we want to get into this deeper amen and she again bear his brother uh abel and abel was a keeper of the sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and there's nothing in the bible by accident it wasn't that you know moses one day said there's two sons and oh god showed me that there's two twins and one's got to do one job one's got to do the other so we'll make one a shepherd and we'll make one a tiller of the ground no but these words are ordained by god and placed here to tell the great story so abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord in abel he also brought of the first things of the flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect and to able and his offering but unto cain and his offering he had not respect and cain was very roth and his countenance fell and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thou countenance fallen if thou does well shalt thou not be accepted and thou doest not well send life at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him what an amazing story that everything written has purpose and in such in so few lines in just a few lines amen the stage is set for the rest of the bible what happened here will continue to happen story after story generation after generation age after age and so what started in genesis goes all the way to revelation brother branham says in in the message i will restore unto you saith the lord now then in order to get the basis of this for a few minutes i believe that everything that is now began in genesis the word genesis is the beginning and every cult that we have on the face of the earth today begin in genesis everything that we have today started in genesis it's the beginning or otherwise known as the seed chapter of the bible where the beginning originated and we know that we know that the scripture says that he's declared the end from the beginning so in genesis he's already declared the end but he's declared it in mystery form but when you see the picture and you get to the end then you can go back and you can find the end in the beginning and so we we find it all the way back in the story of adam and eve you know wife separated out united back together the crowning act crowning achievement crowning act of all of creation he's declared the end from the beginning but you don't know that it's the end when you read the beginning until a prophet comes on the scene and tells you what the great mystery of god what's been hidden in god all along and is now being revealed and then you can go back and begin to see the end in the beginning it's there and it's there and it's there and it's there now there's several there's several scriptures we're going to go through i did a powerpoint today just so we could all stay on track i don't typically like hemming myself into a powerpoint but it's so you can jot things down a lot of definitions of words and scriptures i want to go through so bear with me brother venom also says the true vine and in the message the truth and the false vine now all things originated in genesis you'd like to study genesis brother and your ministers oh i think it's the greatest book of the bible one of them everything you find today originated in genesis genesis means the beginning every cult that you find on earth today started in genesis every real true church on the earth today started in genesis all right if there's a true church on earth today it started in genesis there's a cult on earth today it started in genesis everything that we see even all the science started in genesis and another message brother ben says then salvation begins in genesis salvation begins in genesis because the path to salvation is the word amen when they begin to accept the word they're on the path to salvation amen in righteousness is imputed unto them because of their faith because of receiving the word then salvation begins in genesis impersonation begins in genesis formality begins in genesis everything began at genesis like a vine so when brother of heaven is now showing everything began in genesis but it didn't stop in genesis everything began in genesis but nothing stopped in genesis and what began in genesis like a vine amen is creeping and growing its way through the whole bible and it's two vines so let's let's look at this a little more closely here we look at the name cain i want to just look at the name cain for a minute and we do this in the form of a bible study so don't wait for me to get real fired up to start saying amen because we're going to do a bible study and we love the bible so we say amen when we read the bible help me out amen so the name cain when we go to the concordance it means possession or a choir i put that in parentheses because it doesn't come out of strong's accordance it comes out of another concordance that i have a possession or a choir amen because the the eve says i have gotten or acquired a man from the lord but it means possession or a choir and it doesn't just refer to the fact that eve was given a man-child but it also starts to declare the nature of cain because cain has a desire to possess and acquire that's the desire the nature of cain amen we're going to find out that's the very reason he was a tiller of the soil because he had a nature to possess he had a nature to acquire because that's the nature his father had his father the devil amen wasn't satisfied with the portion he was given he wanted to possess another portion a greater portion he wanted he wanted to exalt himself above the stars of heaven the stars of god he wanted to sit on the sides of the north over the congregation exactly where god said he would put his throne on the sides of the north so he wouldn't to possess or acquire more than what god gave him and he was willing amen to manipulate truth to possess or acquire so you see in the name we're beginning to see the very nature of cain to possess or acquire if we look in the concordance after his name it says the same as 70 13. 70 13 if you look this in his name cain is 70 14 in the in the hebrew section of the concordance amen the the word above it is the same meaning in the same name one's used for cain's name one's another word that's used and that word means a spear so we're beginning to see the nature of cain amen he he he's a possessor i mean he wants to possess he wants to acquire but his name also means the same thing as a spear so how is he going to possess an acquire amen now when we go to the greek when we look into the new testament the new testament is the greek and in first john 3 12 it says not as cain who was of the wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous i want you to think about this word now we're going to look at this definition here in the greek because it's amazing how they define the word cain here because this is a translation of the hebrew into greek but the meaning is super interesting but he says he slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his works were his own works were evil and his brother's righteous and you have to think what were cain's works amen what were cain's works that was so evil and cables was righteous and if you go back to looking at the works amen they both brought an offering to god they both amen the the one built an altar cain spent some time the way brother brown describes it spill some time erecting and fabricating and fashioning an altar for god he spent time working and laboring and toiling so that he would have something that he produced that he acquired that he possessed that he grew amen that he made come to life and he was going to offer that back to god amen and abel also amen was waiting for something to give to god and he waited for a revelation from god and by revelation on the word because you can only have revelation on the word my revelation of the word he offered the correct sacrifice which god accepted and he rejected cain's amen and why slew he his brother because his works were evil amen when cain's was righteous and you have to think i mean what did he do that was so bad amen he offered an offering he worshipped god brother banham said both these boys loved god and had a desire to worship god amen cain was very religious and had a love for god and a desire to worship god amen but he worshipped god according to the lust of his own idea his own desire his own way and his works were evil and they were rejected cain never offered a worship that was of or abel abel didn't offer a worship that was of his own desire he offered a worship that was god's desire and when he offered according to god's way god's will god's desire amen it showed that he was righteous amen because he was able to receive the word and obey the word when he's able to receive the word amen like abraham was able to receive the word and believe the word and act on the word it was imputed unto him for righteousness and abel is declared righteous because he has the capacity to receive the word but not just to hear it but to receive it by revelation and then to go to acting on it to vindicate his faith and god will know he's righteous amen but cain is evil but when you just look amen with her humanistic ideas at the efforts these men put into their sacrifice their desire to worship god amen the conversations they may have had leading up to the day of sacrifice how pious and holy how reverent cain was how desiring he was to give god the best how much he wanted to do for the lord how much he wanted to show his love to god how much effort he wanted to put into it amen when you watch this how could you declare that evil but then god he respects abel's offering and and declares abel righteous cain now is rejected his offering is rejected amen and he's downcast and god comes to him and begins to speak to him why why are you so downcast just do as your brother abel has done and it'll be well with thee god comes and gives him the word i'll tell you this he gives him a chance in mercy i mean is god obligated to give him more information i mean cain wasn't seeking like abel was seeking amen cain amen didn't didn't pray the way obviously the way abel was praying and waiting for what abel was waiting for amen so so now amen god comes in mercy and he gives cain an opportunity amen and cain doesn't want that opportunity he doesn't take that opportunity he rejects the opportunity because to take that opportunity he would have to humble himself and it's not in the nature of his father to humble himself and he will not humble himself just to repeat what his brother did and if he would have just repeated what his brother did it would have been well with him but there's no humility in cain and then cain has a discussion with his brother abel now remember everything starts in genesis this isn't a story about genesis this is a story about today what started there is here the vines that started growing i've come to fruit here so don't don't make this a story about cain and abel make this a story that's all around us today this is what we're living in so now uh he goes to talk to abel and has a discussion with abel and the bible doesn't tell us what's said i don't believe brother branham anywhere then i know it tells us what's said but the result of the conversation ended in cain murdering abel why because the devil is always if he can't stop the word he tries to destroy the vessel that's bringing the word that's what the prophet of god told us and abel had the correct revelation he had the correct understanding he knew what was the correct sacrifice and why it was the correct sacrifice brother rem tells us so and during this conversation whatever transpired and whatever was said we know that abel had the word and the true revelation of the word cain did not have the true revelation of the word but he was granted mercy and opportunity just to repeat what abel did and he wouldn't take it because it would require humility so he goes to talk to his brother abel maybe to find out what this great mystery is what's so what's the big deal why did you do what you did amen somehow during the conversation something was said that infuriated cain to the point he had to kill his brother that's not the past that's the present they can't kill you they'll try to kill your influence brother mim says so the killing is still going on they did it to brother branham to do it to the bride it's not going to stop right so so let's just move on a little further now we're in to first john we're in the new testament and now the the greeks are going to translate this hebrew word cain into a greek word and then if you look at the translation it means maker fabricator literally a smith now now cain we're looking at two occupations and bringing forth declaring two natures now his occupation when we look at the tiller of the ground we need to move away from just the idea of all he's doing is turning over the earth and planting seeds there's more that's going in there because his name also means spear and his name also means a maker fabricator amen a smith literally a smith amen and i want to ask you a question where does a smith that works in metallurgy where does he get his material from amen tilling in the soil pulling out materials that he can fabricate in fashion and become a smith so when cain was digging around in the earth amen it wasn't a little it wasn't a little sweet farm setting where he had a few vegetables and all of that amen cain was trying to possess cain was trying to acquire amen cain was making for himself everything started in genesis he takes the nature of his father the devil amen and now what is he doing i'm going to get way ahead of myself but if we you just love me anyways amen if we jump around cain now amen he's working with the spoken word of god because the earth and all creation is a spoken word of god and now cain is willing to manipulate the spoken word of god for his own gain cain is willing amen digging in their seemingly righteous sin but what's he trying to do he's trying to acquire he's trying to possess he's trying to fashion he's trying to make for his own purposes his offering was for his own desire not for god because when god come and told him what to do he wouldn't even have respect enough for god showing that he never offered for god he offered for cain because there's billions of people on this earth that make offerings to god and prayers and sacrifices and religious services and they never do it for god once they only do it for themselves because of their of their father cain nothing's changed everything started in genesis so he's a maker a fabricator a smith a spear a possessor and she says i've gotten a man from the lord and she again bears brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep cain was the tiller of the ground abel means breath or life able means breath or life when god breathed in the nostrils of of adam he became a living soul and then the breath of god brings life so his name his name means breath and it says here abel was the keeper of the sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and this word tiller means to work or to serve to labor to work to do work to work for another serve another by labor to serve as subjects oh my goodness cain in trying to acquire cain and trying to have amen cain and trying to have a better offering to have a better church to have a better sacrifice and we'll find out as we follow cain's life down he was always trying to do better have more win more and so in in trying to do this he becomes a subject or a servant to the earth this is important he becomes a subject or a servant to the earth or i would say to worldliness to the earth and let's just keep going and let's look at this because he says in genesis 3 17 and unto adam he said because thou hast hearken unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shall not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat it all the days of thy life so what is cain attracted to cain is attracted to the very thing that was cursed and he's working and toiling and laboring and serving the curse [Music] just like all cain's children are serving the curse just like we came to this earth and we were no different we were serving the curse until we were liberated by grace we were toiling amen we were laboring we were serving the curse and now the ground is cursed amen in the very place that cain goes to make his occupation is right to the place that god has cursed nothing's changed friends everything's the same what's the attraction amen why is he there amen and he begins to work in that curse and in that cursive place and the ground that had been cursed for adam's sake and he begins to find in their materials that will advance his own desire he begins to find the materials the things that he needs amen to accomplish his own purpose but not so with abel genesis 3 21 unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them where did the coats of skins come from from a lamb prophet of god told us he slew a lamb he clothed them in a lamb why was abel attracted to the sheep why was abel a keeper of the flocks why cain was a tiller of the soil it had been cursed amen but but as the ground was cursed amen and men fall into ruin god was going to offer a substitute sacrifice to cover their sins to cover their neckiness and he would take a lamb and he would slay an innocent lamb and he would take the skin of the lamb and he would clothe his son and his son's wife in the lamb so that he could cover their sins so he wouldn't have to destroy them and he was taking a substitute sacrifice and he was sending them out now clothed with a bloody lamb and they were going out clothed with the blood of the lamb and when these boys decided to pick their occupations one went to the cursed ground to dig for possession and gain to fabricate in the way and one would not manipulate god's creation all he did was take care of it he took care of it he looked after it he fed it he wasn't manipulating it he wasn't changing it he wasn't changing the way it was fashioned he wasn't digging around in it and reconstructing it for his own good he wasn't pulling out elements that would satisfy his desire all he was doing was taking amen that manifestation of the word of a substitute lamb and he became a shepherd to look after that word to look after it to care for it amen to be a guide and a a worker for it to sustain it to feed it to nurture it and abel now is attracted to the sheep amen and you see that god had made garments for his children but you think about the boys as they come out amen they become infants and and now amen we know that clothing had originated and they start to wear clothes and and they start to grow up and now you wonder uh cane what what would adam and eve have made their garments out of they already tried the vegetation and that was cursed that didn't work so so this is just brother chad but i would think that they would repeat what god did [Applause] and adam knew what the covering was and he would cover his boys one was his one was just living in the house and so abel abel year after year he was experiencing this covering amen and mom and dad have to be covered and all of a sudden it's important that we're covered and it's necessary that a lamb is covering us and and all of a sudden abel i mean there's something attractive in this to able and abel's attracted to the sheep he's not attracted to the cursed ground he's not looking to build a bigger kingdom he's not looking to gain or possess he's not all he's doing is taking care of what god has provided for his covering he may not understand it all yet but he's experiencing it he's covered in it it's covering for him amen as his dad sees that it's important that you're covered in this lamb and now he's going to take care of the thing that's covering him the thing he's interested is the thing that's covering him because we're clothed in the word amen the spotless word and the righteous word of god and now the able nature amen is a shepherd nature who's caring for the very thing that's covering him the the the thing that covers him was the lamb so now he's going to take care of the lamb because the thing that covers us and washes us and purifies us and removes sin from us is the blood of the lamb it's the lamb it's the life of the lamb it's the word of the lamb the lamb is the word and now we become shepherds of the word we love the word amen not the cursed world not the curse of earth but we love this thing that's covering us we love this thing that is a substitute for me the thing that covered for me paid my price covered my sin is the thing that i'm going to give all my life to and i'm not going to change it manipulate it force it all i'm going to do is care for it [Music] [Applause] because the life of a shepherd amen is different amen than that of a cattle herder he's not driving he's leading he's caring for amen there's a relationship between the shepherd and the sheep where the sheep trust the shepherd and the shepherd cares for the sheep and he earns the trust by loving tender care so abel is not a manipulator he's not a rearranger he takes what god provided and he leaves it the way god provided it he doesn't try to cross-feed the sheep with the donkey you get what i'm saying no manipulation but cain is not satisfied with the way things are the spoken word spoke to earth into existence amen but he's not satisfied with it the way it is there's things that he wants out of it so he'll get his theological degree in metallurgy so that he can dig around in that spoken word of god he can move it around and turn it here and set it aside here so they can pull out what he wants to serve his own purpose for his own plans i just explained every denomination that's ever been formed everything started in genesis praise god now you know why my little bible study got really fun and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden he was cursed he said my curse is too great for me and the lord put a seal on mark the mark of the beast and he went out from the presence of the lord from the face of the lord he left the presence of the lord amen because i mean cain may have felt mistreated he may misjudged but he had an opportunity to stay and he did not want to take his opportunity god was not unjust god was not unrighteous god was not he lacked no mercy but cain didn't want the word cain did not want the word of god he could not line up with the word of god he did not want to obey the word of god he did not want to humble himself to the word of god so he was cast out and went out of the presence of god now listen listen close he went out from the presence of god he was no longer in the praise of presence of god no longer before the face of god but he never stopped his religious worship his religious worship didn't diminish one drop it continued on as before because he was satisfied with his way of worship even though it was rejected by god even though god brought a correction upon it now he's not even before the face of god not even in the presence of god he's gone out from the presence of god but he continues his religious worship proving that religion is not for god religion is for man i can say that across the board religion is to serve man's own desire because cain was ultra religious and his descendants were ultra-religious so he never stopped worship he never stopped religion he only left the presence of the lord because cain's form of religion doesn't require the word or the presence of god that's why when the presence of god left every revival they continued on with religion because their man's religion doesn't need the presence of god to continue on or to satisfy the cravings of man think think about it it won't satisfy the cravings of a seed no way but the cravings of a man can be satisfied by man's religion that's a mouthful friends there's a little bible study about cain and abel but this is deep this is deep because this is everything started in genesis the problem now started in genesis what started in genesis continues the day those two vines go out we're still dealing with the same spirits the same attitude the same natures so he went to the land of nod on the east of eden and nod means wondering he has no direction no foundation no word he's not placed he's not positioned he's not elected he's not called he's not chosen he's now wandering and in his wandering he's wandering to make his own way now he's wondering without the word of god without the word of god when you've left the presence of god and without the word of god you're wondering and now he begins to make his own way chapter 4 verse 16 and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch i'll ask you a question it may have come obvious by now where did he get the materials to build a city where did they come from the earth when he was digging around when he was fabricating and fashioning and making and serving the world amen when he's down there toiling for his own gain he come across materials amen and as he went on he went out of the presence of the lord to wander amen but he doesn't want to wander he wants to establish something you don't build a city to wander you build a city to establish yourself so he was sent out to the land of wandering but in the land of wandering he's digging around amen and that spoken word of god amen that now he's dealing now with the worldliness that's been cursed and now he's manipulating and changing and twisting and as he's digging around he's finding elements and pieces that he'll build his own city with because man in his religion will dig around in the word of god and he'll find something and twist it and refashion it so he can build his own denominational walls so he can build his own religion so he can build his own church so he can have his own city because he doesn't want to be a wanderer he wants to be established and in order to get established he's got to be digging down amen in the earth and finding what he wants to serve his own purpose because they don't take all the word they only take those portions that they want to serve their own purpose and then they'll smith it they'll fabricate it they'll smith it amen they'll heat it and they'll twist it and they'll beat it and they'll they'll hammer it and they'll stretch it and they'll carve bricks and they'll bake bricks and make all the things that they need to make to take out of the earth what was originally god's spoken word amen now fallen under a curse because man lost his right to the word now digging out of there to find elements to satisfy his own purpose and to establish his own city oh the bible's good amen deception is leaving the bride the bible's been opened up now we can see christ are you seeing christ in every line [Music] amen so it's not to be deceived again now abel he's been killed he's off the scene i'll say it this way he was the righteous seed he was the lineage of adam the son of god he could receive the revelation of the word and he could act upon it he could believe it he was righteous because of that but he was killed because cain and cain's descendants the serpent seed always destroys the righteous seed the tares always persecute the wheat they always try to stop the voice so that they can be the only voice the voice of the city the voice of the great walled city but abel is cut off i'll say it this way let me just say it this way who shall declare his generation for he was cut off from the land of the living does that sound familiar cain the serpent seed the hybrid the false he killed the shepherd of the flock before the shepherd of the flock could marry and bring forth seed it says who shall declare his generation for he was cut off from the land of the living now will god let it go this way will it stop the rights of the firstborn have stopped with abel abel's been cut off from the land of the living jesus christ came as the great shepherd of the flock amen and he was cut off from the land of the living before he could marry before he could bring forth seed keep reading let's keep going with with with kane's line and unto enoch was born arad and arad begat mahujao and mahuja begotten methuselah methuselah begot lamech and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was ada the name of the other zela so now through this false line comes comes a man who takes two wives does it come from it comes right here because once you start manipulating the word and going your own way there's no end to it so now in ada bear jabul he was the father of such as dwell in tents and such as have cattle and his brother's name was jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp in oregon and zela she also bear tubal kane an instructor of every artificer and brass and iron and the sister tubal cane was nehemiah so now we're following canes lying down and as cane lines go down they all keep digging in the dirt not to plant a cute little vegetable garden and a few little flowers they're digging around there to make their instruments for music to make their instruments for war [Music] and so now there's three brothers born there's two wives there's the the the two sons are jabal jubal jabel jubal and tubal cain does that sound familiar is there a ring to that jabel jubal the reason it has that ring is they all come from the same root word and that root word means like like jabel and jubal have the same meaning for the name it means a stream or a river and now jabel and jubal and tubal came they they all have the same root murder means to to usher forth or to move along and now the seed and nature of cain the civilization of cain the progress of cain the science of cain through these three boys you can see in their name is now ushering along or moving along and they they are the ones that raise cattle ones that handle the harp and the organ see scientific achievement they're beginning to grow and increase and they're beginning to farm amen not just substance living but they're beginning to farm they're beginning to have music play the harp and play the organ and tubal kane becomes an instructor or this means a hammer or or a smelter of every artificer metalwork and brass and iron and the sister tubal kane was nama so now you can see what cain started his lineage continues to do because you'll always be like your father spiritually speaking that's why your father better be god and if your father is god you'll be like god so there's two vines moving down now abel's is cut off nothing's happening there amen but now this there's a propagation of cain's line he's already built one city after his first son was born and he named the city after the first son but now under that city under that building of structures and walls and cities and religion and worship and all science and all the achievement now they're achieving where they can make instruments and they make organs and play music and listen friends this means that there's a society a culture that's already building amen because if you have to go hunt your rabbit eat your rabbit go the next day hunt your rabbit eat your rabbit you don't have time to learn how to build instruments and learn how to play instruments amen and learn how to work in brass and work work in metal this shows the fact that they had time amen to dedicate themselves to make musical instruments and learn to play the musical instruments amen and grow their herds and flocks and build and dig out the materials to make brass dig out iron to to melt it down to smelt it to fashion it to make the tools to work with hey listen this this somebody somebody was supporting this work so we come to a place there's already a civilization established there's already cities we know at least one city upon the earth there's already wisdom there's already knowledge there's there's a lot of digging there's a lot of tilling in the earth that's going on friends and they're all earthly minded the whole line is carnal earthly worldly minded i i wanna i wanna say something it's not bad to have a garden i don't want to be a tiller of the soil i'm going to stop gardening and buy a sheep this tilling in the soil is not like you planting your vegetable garden this is totally different i hope you can see there's one line that's willing to manipulate twist refashion separate remake for their own gain and abel's line abel he was just willing to take it the way god gave it and just care for it accept it the way it was and care for it do you see the two lines and lamech said unto his wives aydah and zila hear my voice you wives are lamech hearken into my speech for i have slain a man to my wounding a young man to my hurt if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech 70 and sevenfold who told him that was that the word of the lord did god tell him that or did he just take it upon himself to take amen a blessing or a protection and just put it upon himself didn't wait for the lord didn't hear from the lord just said well if he does it for cain surely if it's going to be that way then surely for me to be this way but if you look now cain was a murderer from the beginning and now in his lineage there's more killing and what do you think they're doing with all that iron and brass what do you think they're doing with all that iron breath you'll find out as you move down through that this lineage moves all the way to cush amen from ham to cush all the way to nimrod and nimrod becomes a mighty hunter before the lord and then he becomes great and strong on the earth and he begins to he begins to work all of these instruments amen into warfare and he begins to conquer and destroy and gather a one-world religion and a one-world government you think you think it's just a modern day idea to bring all the nations and all the religion together it was done in genesis if it wasn't done in genesis it couldn't be done today but it's being done today because it started in genesis under nimrod and he used tools of war and he uses scientific achievement and he uses music and religion and warfare and economics because that all comes with civilization amen and he's using economics he's using he's using his might and his power he's using warfare he's using science he's using music he's using religion and he's pulling all the world together this is the lineage that comes from cain when cain started digging around in the earth but what about abel abel was cut off from the land of the living who shall declare his generation he's the type of jesus christ the shepherd of the flock who died upon his own altar brother said died with his sacrifice genesis 4 25 and adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew so now now there's coming forth another one out of out of adam another son seth is coming forth and she appointed me she says he appointed me another seed instead of abel and the name seth from the concordance means compensation compensation but it's from the word if you look there in yellow from the word 78 78 96 so that's the root word it's coming out of that means to set to station to a point to fix to set mine to so god is going to place a seed a point position of seed it's not just a happen chance it's not just a hope so it's not going to be the efforts of adam and his wife but god is going to a point he's going to compensate amen he's going to compensate for the loss of abel because abel was cut off now he's going to bring seth and he's going to place and position and put seth in place because the seed is always placed we've been placed because we're the seed and then she says go to the point of me another seed it's important that she says that because brother branham picks up on these words another seed and the definition of compensation and appointment and and fixing and he begins to the talk about this now he says in the message mark of the beast and the seal of god but however we find that cain then went away from god and took himself a wife out of another group in the land of god and that exactly what the man does that will not come up and worship god in spirit and truth he goes off and gets him a church that will satisfy him you thought cain just found a wife he went and got a church that would satisfy him he wasn't satisfied with god's form of worship goes off but remember seth was a type abel being the one that was killed seth took his place was a sign of the death burial resurrection of the lord placed back again god was not going to let it fall and ruin he was typing out the very life of jesus christ in the story of redemption amen and cain slew abel but god was not going to let that lineage stay cut off amen but he was going to bring a type of resurrection amen he was going to appoint another seed amen a compensation a replacement to come back a resurrection brother brenham said a return to the righteous seed and if seth comes back amen and he's a resurrection if he's a restoration amen he's going to have to have the very same nature that abel had and if abel was a shepherd what do you think seth is going to be he's going to be a shepherd if abel was interested in keeping the sheep seth is going to be interested in keeping the sheep because now this is a resurrection of the seed this is going to mean a lot in a few minutes hopefully brother venom says and i got a quote here i'll read on my notes and questions and answers from 64. now we'll notice in the third chapter of luke we get the same thing which sons and so forth and noah noah which were laymaking which also sons of methuselah which also the son of enoch which was the son of jared which was the son of leo which was the son of canaan which was the son of enos which was the son of seth which was the son of adam which was the son of god where did cain come in where's cain at the firstborn the birth writes to him where'd he come from he was satan's seed and not gods wasn't adam's either because adam's son was was seth cain the serpent seed slew his first son which was a type and shadow of the serpent also slaying his other son jesus and seth took his place in the genealogies which meant the resurrection that the genealogies of god would completely be carried on amen the genealogies of god will completely be carried on now let's go back to that scripture in isaiah 53 he says he was cut off who shall declare his generation for he was cut off from the land of the living let's turn to matthew don't lose your place in genesis we'll come back let's go to matthew chapter one in matthew chapter 1 it begins going through the genealogies starting over with abraham and moving us down through but we go to verse 17 matthew 1 and 17 says so all the generations from abraham to david are 14 generations amen and from david until the carrying away into babylon are 14 generations from the caring way into babylon unto christ are 14 generations but you see friends when you sit down and count that last one is only 13 generations because he was cut off from the land of the living who shall declare his generation it's the key is in the resurrection because in the resurrection abel went down one form but in the resurrection abel came up another form same seed appointed seed brother graham calls it a type of the resurrection of jesus christ he comes back in another form amen and he comes back on the day of pentecost as the holy ghost to live inside a people amen and they're going to declare his generation but they never finished that purpose amen they went into ruin because there's going to be a seed at the last time there's going to be a resurrection of the word there's going to be a restoration of the bride and she's going to come back and she is going to unite with christ and bring forth the promised side and be a declaration of the missing generation of christ because christ is male and female when they come together they'll reproduce the son of man [Music] we saw in the prophet we saw that missing generation coming forth in that prophet praise be the god that's what abel being killed and seth coming back in the resurrection all notes and it all has something to do with you and i uniting with christ amen and bringing forth the the promised son which is the word in full measure in this day who will declare his generation for who's cut off from the land of the living i'll say by god's grace i'll declare his generation if he can unite with me and bring his word through me and the son can be on display through me amen the promised sign on display in my life with my actions and my conduct and my words i'll declare his generation i'll volunteer for the job let it be me and let me come back in the resurrection with the same nature safe seth picked up right where abel left off abel was a keeper of the sheep seth was a keeper of the sheep seth wasn't tilling around in the ground he wasn't manipulating the word he wasn't building cities amen he was just a humble simple farmer and herdsmen is what brother branham said he says it this way mark of the beast and the seal of god part two but however we find that cain then went away from god and took himself a wife oh i already read that sorry in the ephesian church age night from when he preached it not from the church age book when he preached in 1960 says she brought forth her first son which was cain is that right the son of satan son of satan if they didn't where'd that evil come from out of adam which was the son of god come from the devil his father and he murdered first murderer was the devil the devil's son watch what happened after that watch the lineage of cain on down through the generation that followed after cain was every one and great men read the bible they built houses they worked with metal they were scientists but every one that come from seth which abel died a type of jesus died and abel died and seth took his place death burial and resurrection from his come humble peasant sheep herders come down through that so what kind of nature should you have if you're declaring that generation amen what kind of you should have the same nature that the first shepherd had amen and what did he do he took care of the word he didn't manipulate it he didn't twist it he didn't change it he just took care of it and we're here to take care of the very thing that's covering us amen remember rebecca when eleazar come to rebecca amen he said he said the one that waters the camels amen the one that waters the camels that'll be the one who is that the one that takes care of the beast that will take her to isaac the one that cares for the word the anointing that's going to take us all the way to isaac that one that cares not just for me but also cares for the very mechanism that will take them back to the promised son that's the one that i'm looking for what was the big deal with camels amen amen it showed amen that she was going to water the very power amen that was going to get her back into her position and this bride today she's going to care for the word she's not going to manipulate the word twist the word fashion it to her own liking change it for her own purposes she's just going to take care of it watch after it nurture it love it care for it brother brahm said in the god of this evil age he said it's noteworthy watch seth's children never went the scientific route they were humble herdsmen farmers and so forth now listen brother brandon's not saying it's wrong to learn anything he has children in school they learn science that's not what he's saying he's he's actually typing this with intellectual religion so like if you do work with science that doesn't put you in the wrong seat some of you are engineers i mean we'd be in bad shape friends but brother venomous actually when he starts showing science he's what he's doing when brother was talking about sciences of the devil amen brother brahma says god's god of science but when he says sciences of the devil he's showing man's desire to manipulate what god made for his own purposes of the devil man's desire to understand knowledge outside of god's word is of the devil that's what brother branham is talking about so you can teach your kids science it's okay they were humble herdsmen farmers and so forth but cain's children did why inspired by their daddy the devil cain inspired by his daddy the devil he's inspired by the seed coming down watch the seed of god coming down through every age watch where it's heading up today christians genuine christians are not all about scientific research and stuff no just a minute we'll get into that but cain did after the nature of their father the devil full of worldly knowledge beauty science so forth cain's children was scientific they were educated they was the players of music instruments modern elvis presley some of the stuff that they the school board lets happen up there in the lane every saturday night builders of city beautifying of women for personal lusts as the devil giving women paint and bobbing their hair and putting them in shorts and things like that it's it's for his own dirty lusts that's pretty flat but i don't know any other way to say it that's coming from a simple herdsman the message time of decision the prophet of god says watch them house cain's people and them cess people death of abel and the coming of seth was the death and resurrection of christ watch how them two lineages run them two streams of blood the sight of cain became smart men scientists educated scholars the other side were humble peasants they tempered iron and made metal and great builders a great builder science very very religious still running the same way see how it how it is no wonder jesus said it would deceive the very elect if possible watch them true trees coming up through eden what's he saying watch them two trees coming up to eden so we find out that abel went down and seth came back and he came back with the very same nature he didn't come to build himself cities he didn't come to build instruments of warfare for scientific achievement he came back and he was a shepherd what abel was he was well christ is we are when christ came back in the resurrection he came back with the same nature he went down let's look at ii peter together i just want to read a couple scriptures we'll go through these quickly as we wind down ii peter 1. ii peter 1 1-4 second peter chapter one verse one simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied into you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue i want to reread that and i want you to think about it according to his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby we are given unto whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust where did the corruption that's in the world come from lust why was cain digging in the ground lust abel wasn't lusting over the sheep wasn't lusting for power wasn't lusting for prestige was it lusting for knowledge was it lusting for wealth was it lusting for control he's keeping the sheep but the corruption that came in the world came in through lust lust is just a desire a desire that word is not always evil right before we go any further i want to look at two scriptures together if you can turn to matthew matthew chapter 13. i want to lay this in and then back up matthew 13 and 16 jesus says but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired hold that word desired that word is translated lust almost everywhere else but is it negative here or is it positive they have desired you could say lusted all right when we say lost as such a negative connotation so many times in scripture it's associated with negative but it's the same word desire lust in the new testament have desired to see those things which you see and not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them let's go to luke 22 just quickly i want to understand this as we move forward luke 22 and verse 15. so when they had dined jesus saith unto simon simon son of jonas lowest no no no no no i'm in 21. oh i'm in john god help me 22 15. and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer same word that's lust that we just read in the other scripture is with with desire i have desired to eat this passover so it's not wrong to have this desire as long as this desire is for the word of god but when this desire is for anything of self it is the thing that corrupted the world any time this kind of desire this longing this coveting this desire and this wanting any time that that kind of longing and wanting and desire comes from a self-desire a selfish from within yourself for yourself it is the very thing that's corrupted this whole world amen but when that strong desire that desire that jesus desired to eat this passover the desire the prophets had to see one of your days that's not a wrong desire that desire comes from the very heart of god and is lined right up with the word amen and that is the desire amen that abel had when he kept sheep that's the desire that seth had when he was a herdsman he had a desire to the word he had a desire to the fulfillment of the word he had a desire to care for the thing that was covering him it wasn't a selfish lust it wasn't a desire for self it wasn't a desire for gain it was a desire for god and a desire for god is godly so we have been given exceeding precious promises that by these we might partake of the divine nature the divine nature doesn't manipulate the word for self-gain the divine nature doesn't manipulate and twist the word for self the divine nature doesn't try to become bigger and better have a better denomination a better church a better city a better is not proud it's not arrogant it's not self-serving it's not manipulating it's not into warfare but it's the divine nature having escaped the corruption is in the world through lust all the way back in genesis 3 and when the women saw that the tree was good for food and then it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired same meaning friends this word desired in the hebrew it means to desire covet take pleasure in or delight in when when she saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took her the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat the corruption that came into the world came in through lust because all of this appealed to her it appealed to her desire it appealed to her sight it appealed to her taste it appealed to her craving brother brandon said she wanted to know she was craving for knowledge she was lusting for knowledge she wanted to know and so it was the she was being seduced by the serpent amen to take the nature of the devil amen to have lust selfish desire over the word of god and that is the very thing that brought corruption and it is still the thing that brings corruption friends it's the thing that brings corruption to churches it's a thing that brings corruption to individuals to households to families to marriages to places of business this is still the very thing that brings corruption is a selfish desire to have what you want to have to do things the way you want to do it to exalt yourself over the word of god is the very thing that causes corruption and first john i want to go through just a series of scriptures real quick and then one we want to read together love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life same thing that eve was tried by and fell by for her own selfish lusts the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever james 1 13 let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own desire lust i mean when we use this word lust so many times you may go to like a sexual lust this is not just a sexual lust it's any desire that's your own desire not god's desire amen he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed amen see what what satan had to do when he began to eat he had to tap into her own lusts he tapped into her own lust and when he tapped into her own lust amen she was corrupted by her own lusts and whenever we are corrupted amen for failing on the word of god it's by our own lusts when he is drawn away of his own lust and entities then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death that's exactly what happened in the beginning in genesis this this what we're reading in the new testament started in genesis romans 13 14 but put you on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof let's read this one together galatians 5. and then we just got a couple more and we'll wrap it up for tonight galatians chapter 5. verse 16 galatians 5 and 16 this i say then walk in the spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh these are contrary to one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness adultery witchcraft hatred variants emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revelings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in the time past that they which do these things shall not inherit the kingdom of god but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts and if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit we are told to crucify our own desire amen crucify our own desire for anything that's not the word of god for anything that's contrary to word of god is there anything that's contrary to the divine nature we are to crucify the flesh with the affections and lust thereof and take the word ephesians 2 15. i'm going to finish with this musicians if you'd like to come blake if you'd like to come ephesians 2 1. and you hath the quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh this is the way we all walked you know you never have to teach a baby to steal to take what's not his every baby i've ever seen will take what's not theirs and then they will slap punch bite pull hair kick to keep it that's their own lusts we were all born that way we were all born in that amen but we've crucified the flesh we've been born again by the spirit and now we let the spirit work through us which brings the divine nature amen which will which will suck we will sacrifice ourselves for the word of god we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of the wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us that's grace friends even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved let's all stand the nature of cain was a manipulator a digger around in the word to manipulate it for his own purpose to build to fabricate the war have war to have science to have his own achievements but little label was just the keeper of the sheep two occupations two natures two vines what nature do you want tonight do you want the nature of the simple shepherd the humble farmer says lord all i want to do is take care of the very thing that's covering me the thing that my substitute that's pardoning me that's covering my nakedness that's clothing me in righteousness that's the thing that i just want to take care of i don't want personal gain amen i don't want accomplishment amen i don't want any of that i just want if you'll just allow me to take care of the sheep allow me to care for the lamb amen allow me amen allow me to give my life amen not to manipulate it not to twist it not to serve my own purposes with it but just to care for the lamb amen abel went down slain who will declare his generation there's a resurrection and saith and when seth comes up he's got the same nature abel had and there's got to be somebody on the earth that'll take the same nature in the resurrection that he had everything starts in genesis i hope you're seeing like i am that's christ every line every story we take a few sentences about cain and abel and all of a sudden it blows open the whole bible and everything we're experiencing now why because the big picture is the shining light that illuminates every other picture in the bible the revelation has been given through a prophet in this day and that revelation is the bright shining light that illuminates every corner of the bible every story every time every shadow amen every happening amen is illuminated by this one great revelation the mystery of god that's been revealed in our day and that mystery of god is christ and if you can't find him in every line and every and every jot and every tittle of the bible go back and read it again you've missed something and i'll say we've been missing something all along but by his grace he's continuing to brighten the light and brighten the light
