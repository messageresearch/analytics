you realize in the garden of eden this was the goal this is what the devil was after and i'll tell you at the end time this is what he's after he is after the sacred motherhood of a body of christ amen the bride of christ bringing forth christ again upon the earth he's after that motherhood he's after that conception he's after that pure undefiled coming forth of the seed of christ right now he'll play with the church's womanhood to get her to let down on her covering to get her to to use some reasoning and drop some things and add some things he'll get her to mess with her motherhood because he wants to take her virtue because he wants to corrupt motherhood because when he corrupt motherhood in the beginning he brought defilement and began to establish his eden upon the earth amen but if this motherhood ever goes back to what it's supposed to be he's going to lose his eden the goal is the motherhood the sacred motherhood is what he's after why do you keep your womanhood so you can keep your virtue why you keep your virtues so you can keep your motherhood because that's the goal because a woman now is entrusted with characteristics because god she was instrumental in the fall but now god is going to use her for redemption and he's going to bring life through this vessel and because he's going to bring life she's been given a sacred trust and that sacred trust shouldn't mean everything to a daughter of god because it types the church that sacred trust to a church what's the church supposed to do in this day she's supposed to manifest the life of jesus christ she's supposed to bring forth amen adam was given a wife to reproduce himself amen that's what christ was given a bride for to reproduce himself but she fell but in the end time he's going to be presented with a virgin bride virgin of the word and what she's supposed to do represent it represent him reproduce him upon the earth again what's he after the motherhood
