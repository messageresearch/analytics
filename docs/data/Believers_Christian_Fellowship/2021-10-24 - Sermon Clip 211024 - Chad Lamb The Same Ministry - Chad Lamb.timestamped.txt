[0:00] peter stands up to preach the gospel and
[0:02] begins quoting the scripture
[0:04] and peter never apologizes
[0:07] for who he is
[0:10] peter doesn't say now uh i know you
[0:12] probably expected somebody else to be
[0:14] the spokesman i i did too
[0:17] i'm nothing
[0:18] he was so excited about what he had he
[0:20] just gave it out amen he wasn't looking
[0:23] at himself he wasn't apologizing for
[0:25] being illiterate he wasn't apologizing
[0:27] even if he misquoted the scripture he
[0:28] wasn't apologizing for not being able to
[0:30] say it right he had the word he had the
[0:33] life and now he's giving out the word
[0:35] and the people are taking the word
[0:38] amen
[0:39] these these men who were
[0:41] nobodies in society they didn't have
[0:44] pool they didn't have rank they didn't
[0:45] have support amen they weren't anything
[0:48] but they when they came to life and they
[0:50] recognized who they were amen all of a
[0:52] sudden it didn't matter that i was a
[0:54] fisherman it didn't matter that i have
[0:55] no money it didn't matter what other
[0:57] people thought of me all that mattered
[0:59] is i've got the word of reconciliation
[1:02] and it's i have it
[1:04] i'm not questioning the word
[1:07] see so many times the devil gets us to
[1:10] look in the mirror and we look at
[1:12] inabilities and we look at shortcomings
[1:15] we look at all these things we look in
[1:17] the mirror and we have the word of
[1:18] reconciliation and then we just lay the
[1:20] word of reconciliation down because of
[1:22] what we see in the mirror
[1:26] don't let the devil pull that trick on
[1:28] you it doesn't matter if you're a child
[1:30] a man a woman it doesn't matter if
[1:32] you're literate or illiterate it has no
[1:34] there's that doesn't matter what matters
[1:36] is have you received the word of
[1:37] reconciliation and is that life in you
[1:40] if that life's in you then give it out
[1:43] we don't have to apologize for who we
[1:45] are
[1:47] peter
[1:49] we don't have any record that peter had
[1:51] an inferiority complex
[1:54] and wouldn't preach he just went
[1:55] preaching
[1:57] then they arrested him they hauled him
[1:59] into the to the council and they began
[2:01] to threaten him and questioning
[2:02] amen he didn't apologize they knew that
[2:05] they were ignorant unlearned men they
[2:06] brought him in to question him he didn't
[2:08] get mad at them he didn't cower to them
[2:10] he he wasn't looking at himself he was
[2:13] looking at what god had done for him he
[2:14] was looking at the word that he was
[2:16] holding
[2:16] [Music]
[2:18] the devil trips us up by getting us to
[2:20] look at ourselves forget about yourself
[2:22] it's not about you it's about him
[2:25] [Music]
[2:27] have confidence in what he's done and
[2:29] have confidence in who he is
[2:31] don't have confidence in your flesh
[2:33] and don't let lack of confidence in your
[2:35] flesh cause you not to give out the word
[2:36] of reconciliation
[2:39] just give it out
[2:41] well i can't i can't quote description i
[2:43] can't find it in my bible
[2:45] so what
[2:47] just give the word
[2:50] to share what's in your heart
