[0:00] there's over 40 000 denominations in the
[0:02] world
[0:05] are they all right are they all wrong is
[0:08] some right some wrong
[0:09] who decides who's right who's wrong
[0:14] who has the authority to pass the
[0:15] judgment on which one's right and which
[0:17] one's wrong
[0:19] it's all man-made god sent a prophet in
[0:23] this day
[0:24] to pull us out of that nonsense
[0:27] and bring us back to the word
[0:33] and the devil's so slick
[0:36] that he tries to get the very bride that
[0:38] he's pulled out and got her marching
[0:39] with the word
[0:41] trying to get her to interest in what
[0:43] the worldly church is doing
[0:47] what's that music they're listening to
[0:53] there's something about it i kind of
[0:56] like
[1:00] keep focusing and all sudden
[1:03] that i like that dress it's kind of cute
[1:08] they're christians i'm christians
[1:11] they're believers i'm a believer
[1:15] how did the israelites walk
[1:18] out of the camp of israel with a
[1:21] tabernacle and a pillar of fire how did
[1:24] they walk out of their tent that morning
[1:26] and gather up an overfull of manna and
[1:29] go inside and eat it
[1:31] and think you know what i think i'm
[1:32] going to go up to that feast of baal
[1:34] pure
[1:37] how how could they do such a thing
[1:41] they begin to watch the moabites and
[1:43] they begin to watch the millions
[1:45] until something inside of them a lust a
[1:48] craving for that kind of worship
[1:49] was awakened and they left what was pure
[1:52] and good and clean
[1:54] and under god and they began to go to
[1:56] worship in a way that was appealing to
[1:58] the flesh
[2:03] i say god scream out in this day get
[2:05] back in step
[2:06] get back and step to the word forget
[2:09] what the worldly church is doing
[2:10] forget what the denominations are doing
[2:13] there's a camp here there's a king in
[2:15] the camp
[2:15] a shout of the king is in the camp the
[2:17] atonement is here the pure food from
[2:19] heaven is here
[2:20] the pure water from the rock of christ
[2:22] is here everything that you need is here
[2:25] there's no reason to leave this camp of
[2:27] the message
[2:29] there's no reason to get wondering and
[2:31] curious about what they're doing and
[2:33] they're doing this and well they're
[2:34] cousins to us
[2:35] if they can do it i can do it it doesn't
[2:37] matter what anybody else is doing
[2:39] amen you keep your eye on the review
[2:41] stand where that a that pillar of fire
[2:43] was present with that prophet
