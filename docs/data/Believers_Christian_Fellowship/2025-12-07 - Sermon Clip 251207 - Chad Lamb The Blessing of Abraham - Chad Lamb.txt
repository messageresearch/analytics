========================================

There's there's a he right here and there's a he right here. &gt;&gt; Now he that leth or restrains or hold backs the antichrist spirit, he will restrain it until he be taken out of the way. So the antichrist spirit is held back from unleashing on the earth. Amen. That this will when when when this that power that lets when he that leth with restrains and holds back is taken away. Amen. Then then what we'll see is a tribulation period break forth on the earth when the antichrist spirit bust out and the full power. But what's holding it back? He that restrains. &gt;&gt; There's a restraining force on the earth that's holding back the full power of the antichrist spirit. Amen. And holding open a door of redemption and holding open a door of mercy. &gt;&gt; But let's see what brother Benham said about this same scripture because he said, "For the mystery of iniquity doth already work." deceivers, you see, deceiving the people off into something. That's a spirit of iniquity. Only he, which is God, shall let or restrain until the church, &gt;&gt; the bride, &gt;&gt; be taken out of the way. &gt;&gt; Who is the second? He early in his ministry, he says he, God. Amen. Shall restrain until he, the Holy Ghost, be taken out of the way. Absolutely. That's what it is. It's God. Amen. But where is the Holy Ghost? The Holy GHOST DWELLS IN GOD'S PEOPLE. It dwells in the bride of Christ. AMEN. AND WHEN THE BRIDE IS RAPTURED, AMEN. THE THE HOLY Ghost lifts. And the only place THAT THERE'S LIGHT ANYMORE, AMEN, is in Jerusalem, in Israel with the two witnesses that are bringing back the 144,000. Everywhere else goes INTO ABSOLUTE DARKNESS. WHY? BECAUSE YE ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. YOU ARE THE SALT. AND WHEN HE TAKES YOU AWAY, THERE'S NO MORE LIGHT FOR THE GENTILES. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO MORE SALT. THERE'S NO MORE CONTACT. THERE'S NOTHING. AMEN. SO, WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR? YOU'RE A BLESSING. AMEN. YOU'RE A LIGHT AND YOU'RE A SALT AND YOU YOUR PRESENCE, THE HOLY GHOST IN YOU IS HOLDING BACK THE FORCES OF DARKNESS AND KEEPING THE DOOR OPEN FOR MERCY JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER. &gt;&gt; DON'T BEGRUDGE BEING HERE. DON'T HATE YOUR LIFE. DON'T WISH YOU COULD GET OUT OF HERE. LET'S HOPE THE RAPTURE COULD HAPPEN TOMORROW. IF I COULD STAY ONE MORE DAY AND ONE MORE person can receive a blessing AT WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. LET MY LIFE BE A BLESSING ACCORDING TO THE PROMISE OF ABRAHAM. AS LONG AS THERE'S ABRAHAM'S SEED ON THIS EARTH, THERE'S A BLESSING ON THIS EARTH. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN ABRAHAM'S SPIRITUAL SEED, THE GENTILES, LIFT OFF, HE TURNS BACK TO THE NATURAL SEED TO THE 144,000. AND THAT will be the only place of light &gt;&gt; and the only place of blessing. &gt;&gt; And it won't be anywhere else. &gt;&gt; Amen. God told Abraham, "You'll be a blessing." If you're part of Abraham's seed, you're here to be a blessing. Be a blessing to your family. Be a blessing to your co-workers. Be a blessing to your to your neighbors. Be a blessing to everybody you can be a blessing to. Because if they bless me, they're blessed. So if I bless them, maybe they want to bless me. And if they bless me, they'll be blessed. &gt;&gt; Yes. If I can be a good neighbor and a good employee and a good family, if I can be whatever that I can be to them, I'm not here for darkness. I'm here for light. I'm here for preservation. I'm here for life. I'm here for contact with God.
