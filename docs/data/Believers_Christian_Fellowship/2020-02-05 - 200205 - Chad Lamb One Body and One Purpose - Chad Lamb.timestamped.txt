[4:47] other but
[4:48] to him amen let's take our bibles over
[4:52] standing and let's turn
[4:56] to the book of first corinthians
[4:59] chapter 14. i just want to thank brother
[5:02] ben coli for
[5:04] stepping out in faith you know it's not
[5:06] easy to do that but i appreciate him
[5:08] following the leading
[5:09] leadership of the lord and taking the
[5:11] risk to step into something god's
[5:13] calling him to
[5:14] and i really appreciate that for
[5:16] everybody who's willing to do that
[5:18] amen what we're standing let's take a
[5:21] look at
[5:22] first corinthians 14.
[5:25] and verse 12.
[5:29] even so ye for as much as you are
[5:31] zealous of spiritual gifts
[5:33] seek that you may excel to the edifying
[5:35] of the church
[5:37] so this he's speaking to the corinthian
[5:39] church and the corinthian church was
[5:41] they were zealous for gifts they liked
[5:42] gifts but he wanted them to excel
[5:45] to the edifying of the church because
[5:47] all those gifts were there
[5:48] to edify or build up the church and he
[5:51] wanted to be excellent
[5:52] not just for the gift but for the gift
[5:54] that will build up the church
[5:56] and i'd like to take for a subject this
[5:58] evening and talk about one body
[6:00] and one purpose one body and one purpose
[6:03] and let's just bow our heads and pray
[6:05] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[6:07] jesus for this day that we have to be
[6:09] together
[6:10] and all we know the weather outside is
[6:12] not good lord but
[6:14] you're good and god we know that your
[6:16] hand of protection is upon us lord
[6:18] because we're your children
[6:20] and we're here lord because you've
[6:21] called us together and while we pray you
[6:24] bless all those that have come lord that
[6:25] you would protect them that you would
[6:27] change whatever needs to be changed so
[6:29] that after this service we can go home
[6:31] safely lord that you would take care of
[6:33] us along the way
[6:34] for those who weren't able to make it
[6:36] lord because of the conditions we pray
[6:38] should bless them
[6:39] may they be able to stream or whatever
[6:40] they're doing lord that your blessings
[6:42] would be upon them
[6:44] but father we're looking to you now that
[6:46] that you would just speak to us this
[6:48] evening while we've gathered here we've
[6:49] not gathered in vain
[6:50] we've gathered with a purpose lord and
[6:52] we pray your purpose would be
[6:54] accomplished
[6:55] take your preeminence among us and speak
[6:56] through these lips of clay we pray
[6:58] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[7:02] you can have your seats amen
[7:07] praise god i appreciate you coming out
[7:10] amen the weather forecast is a little
[7:12] mixed
[7:13] but praise god the forecast from god's
[7:15] not mixed
[7:16] all is well amen he takes care of
[7:19] everything
[7:20] so we just appreciate that very much so
[7:23] tonight i have a unique subject i want
[7:25] to talk about not really the preaching
[7:26] subject i want to get into that
[7:28] but there's been something that's been
[7:30] happening and transpiring for a little
[7:31] while now that i just want
[7:33] to bring to everybody's attention and uh
[7:36] something that i've been watching and
[7:38] and and god god is raising up another
[7:40] gift amongst us
[7:42] and he's raising up the gift of a
[7:43] prophet right here amongst us
[7:45] here in the assembly and it's and it's
[7:48] unusual for us
[7:50] but it shouldn't be unusual for us
[7:52] because we believe we're going back to
[7:54] the book of acts church and
[7:55] in the book of acts they had all of the
[7:58] gifts operating
[7:59] and so i've been spending some time over
[8:02] the last few years with brother rich
[8:04] levy
[8:05] and god has been bringing brother rich
[8:07] through some very prophetic experiences
[8:10] and uh it's been happening for some time
[8:13] uh going back as much as four years but
[8:15] really in the last two to three years
[8:17] things have been growing in intensity
[8:19] frequency and clarity i would say it
[8:22] that way
[8:23] and brother rich has been very good
[8:24] about coming to me all the time and just
[8:25] sharing
[8:26] and not not knowing what direction
[8:28] things are going in not knowing what's
[8:30] happening just sharing
[8:31] the experiences that he's been having
[8:33] but these experiences i can tell you are
[8:35] very prophetic
[8:36] and and they keep they keep pointing us
[8:38] in a direction and
[8:40] and for the last couple of years it's
[8:41] not been clear which direction things
[8:43] are going in but
[8:44] i believe of late god is making it clear
[8:47] that he's raising up a gift amongst us
[8:50] and i want to do some teaching on that
[8:52] because
[8:53] you know i i was thinking myself i've
[8:55] never seen this happen
[8:58] i don't know how long you've been around
[9:00] or what you've seen but i've
[9:01] i've never seen this if i'd come to you
[9:03] and i say there's a brother in assembly
[9:04] and he feels a calling to preach well
[9:06] we've seen that happen before
[9:08] and we say yeah i can understand that
[9:10] but but when i tell you that god is
[9:12] raising up a gift of a prophet amongst
[9:14] us
[9:14] all the sudden it's like i don't know
[9:16] i've never seen that how does that work
[9:18] and there's a little bit of hesitation
[9:20] that we can have because of the
[9:22] unfamiliar
[9:23] but the words not unfamiliar on the
[9:26] subject and the message isn't either so
[9:27] i want to take a look at the word
[9:29] and at the message and see if we can
[9:31] find familiar ground
[9:32] and see if we can be properly taught and
[9:35] have the proper
[9:36] understanding amen because i think it's
[9:38] important
[9:40] to understand if god's doing something i
[9:42] want to understand what he's doing
[9:44] and i want to properly approach it with
[9:46] the proper attitude
[9:48] the way god the way god's bringing it
[9:50] and like i said before with anything
[9:52] that god does
[9:53] i don't want to be ahead of him and i
[9:54] don't want to be behind him i don't want
[9:56] to be to the left i don't want to i want
[9:57] to be right in the mark wherever god is
[9:59] i want to be there
[10:00] and when god raises up a gift it's easy
[10:02] to go ahead or stay
[10:04] behind out of fear or move ahead out of
[10:06] fanaticism
[10:07] but what we want to do is be where god
[10:09] is so we want to look at the scriptures
[10:11] and
[10:12] and and then talk about not just offices
[10:16] but gifts
[10:17] and offices and if you'll turn with me
[10:18] to first corinthians 12
[10:20] we'll go through a bit of a bible study
[10:22] and look at the message and then i'll
[10:23] explain some more of what's been going
[10:25] on
[10:29] first corinthians 12.
[10:36] and verse 1 first corinthians 12
[10:40] 1. now concerning spiritual gifts
[10:41] brethren i would not have you ignorant
[10:44] you know that you were gentiles carried
[10:45] away unto these dumb idols even as you
[10:47] were led
[10:48] therefore i give you to understand that
[10:50] no man speaking by the spirit of god
[10:52] calleth jesus accursed
[10:53] and that no man can say that jesus is
[10:55] the lord but by the holy ghost
[10:57] now there are diversities of gifts but
[10:59] the same spirit
[11:01] and there are differences of
[11:02] administration but the same lord
[11:04] and there are diversities of operations
[11:06] but is the same god which worketh all in
[11:08] all
[11:09] so there's a diversity of gifts we know
[11:11] that right but within the diversity of
[11:13] gifts
[11:14] there's a diversity also of
[11:16] administrations the way the gift is
[11:18] administered
[11:19] and beyond that there's a different
[11:21] manifold presentation of operations
[11:23] so there's so there's a there's a uh
[11:27] let me get the wording right here so
[11:28] there's a diversity of gifts there's
[11:30] also a diversity of the way it's
[11:32] administered and there's a diversity of
[11:33] the way it's operated
[11:35] sometimes when we use the word profit we
[11:37] instantly go to brother branham
[11:39] and now our ideas profit everything has
[11:42] to be exactly like brother branham
[11:43] but it doesn't have to be exactly like
[11:45] brother branham brother bannon was
[11:47] raised up to be a prophet of the age
[11:49] amen
[11:50] he's a prophet not in a five-fold
[11:52] prophet one of those prophets but he's a
[11:53] prophet over the five full ministry
[11:55] he's a prophet of the entire age so
[11:58] immediately when we hear that word
[11:59] all of a sudden we we go right there
[12:01] because that's the example we've seen so
[12:03] much
[12:04] but that's not necessarily there's a
[12:06] diversity of gifts
[12:08] there's a diversity of administrations
[12:10] and there's a diversity of operations
[12:12] so just because we've seen something one
[12:14] way one time doesn't mean it always has
[12:16] to operate that way
[12:18] all right we're clear we want to let god
[12:21] do what god's doing the way god does it
[12:23] because every gift can operate in a
[12:25] unique way
[12:26] for instance you know you can take two
[12:29] preachers and they can preach totally
[12:31] two totally different styles they can
[12:34] administer the gift and operate the gift
[12:36] in two totally different ways
[12:38] and and we're not uncomfortable with
[12:40] that right we get comfortable with that
[12:42] because we've seen it so much
[12:44] so when we use the term profit we and we
[12:46] we always get this
[12:48] enigma or this image but we need to
[12:50] relax for a minute and just look at the
[12:52] scriptures and understand
[12:54] amen that there's a there's a diversity
[12:56] of administrations and a diversity of
[12:58] operations
[12:59] verse six again but is the same god
[13:02] which worketh all in
[13:03] all but the manifestation of the spirit
[13:06] is given to every man
[13:07] to profit with all so the the spirit is
[13:10] given
[13:11] to each one for different things to
[13:14] profit
[13:15] everyone
[13:19] for to one is given by the spirit the
[13:20] word of wisdom to another the word of
[13:22] knowledge
[13:23] by the same spirit to another faith by
[13:25] the same spirit
[13:26] to another the gifts of healing by the
[13:28] same spirit to another the working of
[13:30] miracles to another prophecy
[13:32] to another discerning of spirits to
[13:34] another diverse kinds of tongues to
[13:36] another the interpretation of tongues
[13:38] but all these work at that one and self
[13:40] same spirit dividing to every man
[13:43] severally as he will so god's the one
[13:46] who divides it up
[13:47] separates it as he will for as the body
[13:51] is one and half many members
[13:52] and all the members of that one body
[13:54] being many are one body
[13:56] so also is christ for by one spirit are
[13:59] we all baptized into one body
[14:01] whether we be jews or gentiles whether
[14:03] we be bond or free
[14:05] and have been all made to drink into one
[14:07] spirit
[14:08] for the body is not one member but many
[14:11] if the foot shall say because i am not
[14:13] the hand i am not of the body
[14:15] is it therefore not of the body and if
[14:17] the ear shall say because i am not the i
[14:19] am i not of the body is it therefore not
[14:22] of the body
[14:23] if the whole body were an eye where were
[14:25] the hearing
[14:26] if the hole were hearing where were the
[14:27] smelling but now hath god set the
[14:30] members every one of them in the body
[14:32] as it hath pleased him and if they were
[14:34] all one member where were the body
[14:37] but now are they many members yet one
[14:40] body
[14:41] and the eye cannot say unto the hand i
[14:43] have no need of thee nor again the head
[14:45] to the feet
[14:45] i have no need of you name much more
[14:48] those members of the body which we seem
[14:50] to be more
[14:50] feeble are necessary and those members
[14:53] of the body which we think to be less
[14:55] honorable
[14:55] upon these we bestow more abundant honor
[14:58] and our uncommonly parts have more
[15:00] abundant comeliness
[15:01] for our comedy parts have no need but
[15:03] god has tempered the body together
[15:05] having given more abundant honor to that
[15:07] part which lacketh
[15:09] that there should be no schism in the
[15:10] body but that the members should have
[15:12] the same care one for another
[15:14] and whether one member suffer all the
[15:16] members suffer with it
[15:17] and where one member be honored all
[15:19] members rejoice with it
[15:21] now you are the body of christ and
[15:23] members in particular
[15:24] and god has said some in the church
[15:26] first apostles secondarily prophets
[15:28] thirdly teachers and after that miracles
[15:30] then gifts of healing
[15:32] helps governments diversities of tongues
[15:34] are all apostles
[15:36] are all prophets are all teachers are
[15:39] all workers of
[15:40] miracles have all the gift of healing do
[15:42] all speak with tongues do all interpret
[15:45] but covet earnestly the best gifts and
[15:47] yet shall i unto you
[15:48] a more excellent way so the apostle paul
[15:51] is very much taking the body of christ
[15:53] and typing it to our physical body
[15:55] and when our physical body we have
[15:57] members that are diverse from one
[15:59] another very different
[16:00] from one another you can't compare your
[16:02] liver to your finger
[16:05] but yet they're all important for the
[16:07] working of the body and
[16:08] everything in your body works together
[16:10] for the edifying of the body
[16:12] that's why i titled this one body and
[16:15] one purpose
[16:16] everything in my body is working for one
[16:18] purpose it's working to keep my body
[16:21] alive
[16:22] functioning moving doing what my what my
[16:25] purpose is
[16:26] and that's each one of us every one of
[16:28] us is an individual
[16:29] amen are placed in the body for one
[16:32] purpose
[16:33] and that's to keep the body going and so
[16:36] it doesn't matter
[16:37] what gift we have what position we're in
[16:39] and where we are
[16:40] in this body we know that we're talking
[16:42] about the entire body
[16:45] the universal body of jesus christ but
[16:47] what works in the universal works in the
[16:49] microcosm
[16:50] as well and it also works here as a
[16:51] local body and here in the local body
[16:54] amen we god is placed in the body
[16:58] everything that the body needs so that
[17:01] there's no
[17:01] lack but there's one body with one
[17:04] purpose
[17:05] and that purpose isn't for individual
[17:07] members to rise above others
[17:08] if god if god gives an ability to my
[17:11] finger if god gives an ability to my
[17:13] pancreas
[17:13] they won't be the same ability but they
[17:15] each have an ability
[17:17] to work together for the edifying of the
[17:19] body
[17:20] that makes sense so we have to
[17:21] understand what what paul's trying to
[17:24] teach us so that we can move forward
[17:26] now let's go to ephesians chapter 4.
[17:33] ephesians chapter 4
[17:37] and verse 10.
[17:44] he that descended is the same also that
[17:46] ascended up far above all heavens that
[17:48] he might fill all things
[17:50] and he gave some apostles and some
[17:52] prophets and some evangelists
[17:54] and some pastors and teachers for the
[17:56] perfecting of the saints for the working
[17:58] of the ministry
[17:59] for the edifying of the body of christ
[18:02] so why were the offices given
[18:04] for the edifying of the body of christ
[18:08] till we all come in the unity of the
[18:10] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[18:11] god and to a perfect man
[18:13] unto the measure of the stature of the
[18:15] fullness of christ for we henceforth be
[18:17] no more children tossed to and fro and
[18:19] carried about with every wind of
[18:20] doctrine
[18:21] by the slight of men in the cunning
[18:23] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[18:24] deceive
[18:26] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[18:28] up into him in all things
[18:29] which is the head even christ from whom
[18:32] the whole body
[18:33] fitly joined together and compacted by
[18:35] that which every joint supplies
[18:37] according to the effectual working and
[18:39] the measure of every part
[18:41] making increase of the body and to the
[18:43] edifying of itself
[18:44] in love you get the point
[18:48] every part has one purpose
[18:51] different office different
[18:52] administration amen
[18:54] amen sometimes a different operation but
[18:57] all for one purpose
[18:59] so if god's going to raise something up
[19:00] among us it's for the same purpose
[19:02] for the same purpose he'll raise up a
[19:04] minister an evangelist a pastor
[19:07] the same reason to raise up a song
[19:09] leader or a musician or somebody who can
[19:11] write songs
[19:11] is the same reason he'll raise up any
[19:14] gift in any position in the body
[19:16] now what we've read here in the
[19:17] five-fold what we've termed as the fifth
[19:20] ministry
[19:21] is these are offices so you have gifts
[19:23] and you have offices
[19:25] so the people who have an office in the
[19:27] church have
[19:28] gifts all right but not everybody have
[19:32] gifts has an office
[19:34] that makes sense they're two different
[19:35] things and god god
[19:38] ordains the offices not man it's what
[19:40] god places in the church the offices
[19:43] but the spirit also gives gifts amen and
[19:46] the gifts are given severally as he will
[19:48] so everybody gets a measure of the
[19:50] spirit and everybody gets some something
[19:53] for the body
[19:54] amen and those are gifts but not
[19:56] everybody with a gift holds an office
[19:58] but everybody with an office has a gift
[20:01] that makes sense okay
[20:04] let's look at a couple things the
[20:06] prophet of god says here
[20:08] in the submergent church age 1960 god
[20:11] never intended the church to be run by
[20:13] men
[20:13] god runs his church and he runs it
[20:15] through the gifts of the spirit
[20:17] the gifts of the spirit is in the church
[20:19] to correct the spirit he's got five
[20:21] ministerial officers in his church
[20:22] first of them as apostles or
[20:23] missionaries missionaries the highest
[20:26] calling there is apostle
[20:27] the word missionary means one sin
[20:29] apostle means one cent
[20:31] he says but they are apostles all right
[20:32] apostles prophets teachers evangelist
[20:34] pastors
[20:35] now that's the elected offices of god to
[20:38] his church
[20:40] then in each local church there is nine
[20:42] spiritual gifts that come among the
[20:43] people
[20:44] that is knowledge wisdom gift of healing
[20:46] working of a miracle speaking with
[20:47] tongues interpretation of tongues
[20:49] and all these things go in each local
[20:51] body and every person in the church has
[20:53] an individual ministry
[20:54] and that individual ministry goes
[20:56] together with the rest of the ministry
[20:58] to edify the body of christ so nobody
[21:02] can say they don't have a ministry
[21:04] because the prophet said you do we may
[21:06] not be clear what it is we may not know
[21:08] that we're operating it or not but it's
[21:10] been given to us and odds are we're
[21:12] already operating in it but don't know
[21:14] it
[21:16] but every individual ministry goes
[21:17] together with the rest of the ministry
[21:18] to the edifying of the body of christ
[21:21] but the man preaches in 1959 balm and
[21:23] gilead says now there's five offices
[21:26] that god puts in the church
[21:27] there's nine spiritual gifts that
[21:29] accompany that offices and all the
[21:30] members of the body
[21:32] the first is apostles which is
[21:33] missionaries the word apostle means
[21:36] one that sent a missionary
[21:39] apostles prophets teachers pastors
[21:41] evangelists these offices god sets in
[21:42] the church
[21:43] they're all in operation or should be
[21:48] you got that they're all in operation or
[21:51] should be
[21:55] we cannot bypass one and say there's
[21:58] teachers without saying evangelists we
[22:00] cannot say there's evangelisms without
[22:01] saying there's apostles
[22:02] we cannot say there's apostles without
[22:04] admitting there's prophets
[22:06] all of them are for the perfecting of
[22:08] the body of christ
[22:10] so brother branham clearly tells us that
[22:12] this is this and the scriptures clearly
[22:14] tell us
[22:15] that this is one of the offices in the
[22:16] church in the new testament church
[22:18] and it in it and it should brother said
[22:20] it should be there
[22:22] he said it should it said they're all in
[22:24] operation or should be and so
[22:26] we for us you know for me personally
[22:30] i've never seen this now i've seen
[22:31] brother abraham myra and brother abraham
[22:34] clearly is a gift of a prophet but he's
[22:36] also a pastor and he's also a preacher
[22:38] and i've witnessed this gift operate and
[22:40] it operates and i've seen it
[22:41] but i didn't see it come up you know i
[22:43] didn't see when it started as a boy how
[22:45] god dealt with him and how
[22:47] god got everything got placed i just see
[22:49] it now years and years later and i
[22:51] accept it for what it is
[22:52] because you see it right and it doesn't
[22:55] you know
[22:55] to me it's not scary because you see it
[22:57] operating amen but
[22:58] but but to see something come up for us
[23:01] and now is it's a new experience for us
[23:03] and that's shameful because it shouldn't
[23:04] be i don't believe it should be a new
[23:07] experience but for us it is but what do
[23:09] we expect if god keeps taking his word
[23:11] and lining us to his word
[23:13] and lifting us higher and higher
[23:14] bringing us back to what the book of
[23:16] acts church really was
[23:18] what should we expect to be happening we
[23:21] should expect it
[23:22] but when it comes although we expect it
[23:24] it comes he always does things in an
[23:26] unusual way
[23:27] that requires you to have faith in what
[23:29] he's doing
[23:31] that's just the plan of god that's just
[23:32] the way god does it he does things an
[23:34] unusual way in an
[23:36] unexpected way amen so that you're going
[23:38] to have to still
[23:39] operate by faith to accept what god's
[23:42] doing
[23:43] but we should have expected these things
[23:45] we should expect more
[23:47] we should expect we should expect this
[23:49] and more
[23:51] amen so so although it's unusual that's
[23:55] shameful to say it's unusual
[23:57] but hey god will forgive us for that
[23:59] because we're moving
[24:00] we're moving we're not staying
[24:01] stationary we're moving to where god
[24:03] wants us to be
[24:04] by his grace he's moving us as a body of
[24:07] believers
[24:07] to that full manifestation of what he
[24:09] has determined before the foundation of
[24:11] the world for us to be
[24:13] and i don't believe we're going to get
[24:14] out of here that we're till we're firing
[24:16] on all
[24:16] brother ben said all 16 cylinders so
[24:19] everything's in operation everything's
[24:21] working and the spirit of god has
[24:23] total preeminence over every gift
[24:26] and every office and everything's
[24:28] clicking just right on time
[24:29] i don't think we're going on a body
[24:31] change till that's happening
[24:33] so we should expect more and more and
[24:36] more
[24:37] to come along
[24:43] let's look at romans 12. before we
[24:47] get into a lot more
[24:50] keep wanting to lay down a scriptural
[24:52] foundation
[24:54] and look at the message romans 12
[25:00] and verse 1
[25:04] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[25:05] mercies of god that you present your
[25:07] bodies a living sacrifice
[25:09] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[25:11] reasonable service
[25:12] and be not conformed to this world but
[25:14] be transformed by the renewing of your
[25:16] mind
[25:17] that you may prove what is that good and
[25:19] acceptable and perfect will of god
[25:21] for i say through the grace given unto
[25:23] me to every man that is among you not to
[25:25] think of himself more highly than he
[25:26] ought to think
[25:28] but to think soberly according that god
[25:30] has dealt to every man the measure of
[25:32] faith
[25:33] for as we have many members in one body
[25:35] and all members have not the same office
[25:37] so we being many are one body in christ
[25:40] and everyone remembers one of another
[25:42] having then gifts differing according to
[25:44] the grace that is given to us
[25:46] whether prophecy let us prophesy
[25:48] according to the pro
[25:49] to the proportion of faith or ministry
[25:52] let us wait on our ministry
[25:54] or he that teaches on teaching or he
[25:56] that exhorteth on exhortation
[25:58] he that giveth let him do it with
[25:59] simplicity he that ruleth with diligence
[26:02] he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness
[26:04] let love be without dissimilation abort
[26:07] that which is evil
[26:08] and cleave to that which is good so
[26:11] god is keeps telling us the same thing
[26:13] in the scriptures there's one body
[26:15] many membered and every joint is
[26:18] differing but supplying
[26:20] everything is different but with one
[26:22] common purpose and one common
[26:24] goal so it's one body with one purpose
[26:28] amen brother bam says in the message
[26:31] blind bartimaeus from 1959
[26:36] i hope i didn't lose anything to another
[26:38] is good stewardship
[26:40] i've lost something i've lost part of my
[26:43] quote
[26:45] but we'll come back to it maybe i'll
[26:46] find it
[26:48] actually i know what i'll do
[26:56] sorry bear with me for a second i don't
[26:57] want to lose my quote
[27:00] all right yeah blind bartimaeus 1959
[27:06] now in the church he has sent gifts some
[27:08] are apostles
[27:10] apostle and a missionary is the same
[27:11] word meaning once sent
[27:13] he said uh he goes on down he says a
[27:16] missionary
[27:17] prophets apostles prophets teachers
[27:19] evangelists and pastors
[27:21] that's the office of the church and
[27:22] these offices should be alive with the
[27:24] holy spirit
[27:25] not set in by man but set in by the holy
[27:28] spirit in each church
[27:30] you got that not set in by man
[27:34] but set in by the holy spirit in each
[27:35] church apostles prophets teachers
[27:37] evangelists pastors
[27:38] these are offices that god set in the
[27:40] church man has nothing to do with it
[27:43] god puts them in the church that's the
[27:46] way we want it
[27:47] god has nothing to do with our man has
[27:49] nothing to do with it
[27:50] god puts it in the church
[27:53] and i'm going to try to go back and
[27:55] hopefully i haven't lost anything
[27:57] i know you don't know what that means
[27:58] but i know what that means
[28:00] to go back all right so we want to keep
[28:04] keep following this thought through now
[28:06] when brother branham
[28:08] when he's teaching on prophets many
[28:10] times when he begins to talk about a new
[28:11] testament prophet or prophets
[28:13] in modern day most of the time when he's
[28:16] talking he's trying to vindicate his
[28:17] ministry and show his ministry
[28:20] and brother branham you know he's like
[28:22] john the baptist he's a prophet yay and
[28:23] more than a prophet
[28:25] because he was prophesied to come and be
[28:27] a forerunner and brother brennan was the
[28:29] same thing he was a prophet yay and more
[28:31] than a prophet
[28:32] and then he was there to fulfill certain
[28:34] scriptures and he came as a forerunner
[28:36] for the second coming
[28:37] and so brother branham many times when
[28:39] he's talking about prophet and
[28:41] explaining it
[28:41] you can show he's trying to get the
[28:43] people to understand the concept of what
[28:45] his
[28:45] office is and so he explains it in that
[28:47] certain way but what brother branham
[28:49] doesn't always do he does in a few
[28:51] places and we'll look at that
[28:52] but he doesn't always break down what
[28:54] the other
[28:55] prophets would look like not the prophet
[28:57] of the age but the prophets that's in
[28:59] the church
[29:00] he doesn't always go into detail to
[29:02] explain that but he does in a few places
[29:04] so i'll i'll go to those in just a
[29:06] minute
[29:10] amen
[29:13] all right let's let's turn to first
[29:17] peter 4
[29:18] catch another scripture here
[29:23] first peter chapter four
[29:33] first peter chapter four and verse seven
[29:37] it's the same theme when we were picking
[29:39] it up by peter now
[29:42] it says but the end of all things is at
[29:44] hand
[29:46] hey where does that place us
[29:49] where does that place this scripture see
[29:52] these things matter
[29:55] the end of all things is at hand i like
[29:57] that so now we're right here
[29:59] we're right in this scripture but the
[30:00] end of all things is at hand
[30:02] be therefore sober and watch unto prayer
[30:04] and above all things have
[30:06] fervent charity or love among yourselves
[30:09] for charity shall cover the multitude of
[30:11] sins
[30:12] use hospitality one to another without
[30:14] grudging
[30:15] as every man hath received the gift even
[30:18] so minister the same one to another
[30:20] as good stewards of the manifold grace
[30:22] of god
[30:23] if any man speak let him speak as the
[30:26] oracles of god if any men minister let
[30:28] him do it as
[30:29] the ability which god giveth that god in
[30:31] all things may be glorified through
[30:33] jesus christ to whom he prays in
[30:35] dominion
[30:36] forever and ever amen
[30:39] if you prophesy do it according to the
[30:41] grace of god if you speak as the oracle
[30:42] of god
[30:43] amen whatever you do do according to the
[30:45] channel that god's working through you
[30:47] and we're not here to imitate one
[30:49] another and we're not here to put
[30:51] ourselves in positions or take positions
[30:53] upon ourselves
[30:54] this is clear we're not here to say
[30:56] you're this and you're that brother
[30:57] benham said
[30:58] that's where the latter reign made their
[30:59] mistake they tried to man to appoint
[31:01] gifts
[31:02] and men by laying on their hands to
[31:03] appoint certain positions and he said
[31:05] god does those things
[31:06] but you're here to minister according to
[31:08] the faith and according to the grace and
[31:10] faith that's been given to you
[31:12] and that goes for each of us not just
[31:14] certain gifts
[31:16] and differing from others but that's for
[31:18] each of us to operate according
[31:20] to the grace that's been given to us by
[31:22] the faith that's been given to us so
[31:23] that jesus christ gets the glory
[31:25] this isn't a man-made effort i should
[31:28] put it that way
[31:29] this is not a man-made effort and this
[31:31] is not anybody with the ability to press
[31:34] themselves into anything
[31:36] you're never going to press yourself
[31:38] into anything there's no
[31:39] seeing an office and wanting that office
[31:41] and working towards that office or
[31:43] towards that gift
[31:44] that'll never happen it's not going to
[31:46] happen the spirit gives those out
[31:47] severally as he will and god ordains
[31:49] those offices
[31:50] into the church you can't you can't
[31:53] strive for it you can't climb to it
[31:55] you can't work towards it it's something
[31:57] that if it's going to happen it's going
[31:59] to happen
[32:00] it's going to happen to you and it's
[32:02] going to happen through you
[32:04] so there's no pressing no striving
[32:06] there's actually
[32:07] a just getting sincere with god and
[32:10] dedicating your life to god and letting
[32:12] god do what god's going to do with you
[32:13] because he's already predetermined
[32:15] he's already appointed it we just have
[32:17] brother baby said the secret to
[32:19] operating any gift is to relax
[32:21] not to press not to strive not to make
[32:24] ourselves something or push
[32:25] ourselves in anything but just to relax
[32:27] and let god do what god's gonna do
[32:30] uh because because when we use the term
[32:34] profit we our minds always go
[32:36] to certain places amen i just wanted to
[32:39] talk about this for a minute
[32:40] because if you look in the old testament
[32:42] at all the prophets
[32:43] you see that those prophets didn't
[32:45] operate the same way
[32:47] is that true you have you have isaiah
[32:50] who was a prophet who was brought up
[32:51] under a king and he was with the king
[32:53] all the time
[32:53] but he was leaning on the the the arm of
[32:56] flesh and we know what happened to you
[32:58] to isaiah so isaiah was brought up he
[33:01] was a prophet brought up under the king
[33:03] and the palace
[33:04] with all those things but then you have
[33:06] amos who was a herdsmen who nobody ever
[33:08] heard before
[33:09] and he just tromped into town one day
[33:11] and dropped prophecy and nobody knew who
[33:13] he was
[33:13] where he come from he said i'm not a
[33:15] prophet or the son of a prophet
[33:17] but he said when the lion roars who can
[33:19] keep his peace you know
[33:21] so it wasn't always the same way we've
[33:23] had prophets from
[33:25] many different tribes right
[33:28] we've had prophets that would minister
[33:31] and they would give a prophecy one time
[33:34] in the bible and never again
[33:36] you say then you have prophets who are
[33:38] responsible for writing the bible
[33:40] so they operate differently you have
[33:42] prophets who use symbols
[33:45] you'd have prophets like jeremiah i
[33:47] think it was jeremiah
[33:48] who would make a wooden yoke and he said
[33:51] by this you'll be yoked amen and
[33:53] one took it and broke it over their knee
[33:55] so he's using a symbol
[33:56] but then you have another prophet like
[33:58] mikaya who stands before ahab and
[34:00] jehoshaphat he uses no symbols at all he
[34:02] just says what he saw in heaven
[34:04] he saw a scene play out he heard a
[34:06] conversation and he tells what he saw in
[34:08] heaven
[34:08] jeremiah doesn't tell what he saw in
[34:10] heaven jeremiah brings a yoke as a
[34:12] symbol and saying this is what's going
[34:13] to happen
[34:14] you see they're not copying each other
[34:17] and all the way down to the old
[34:18] testament these
[34:19] these prophets operated very differently
[34:22] in their operation
[34:25] you had a i believe it was ezekiel i may
[34:27] be wrong but ezekiel was a levite and a
[34:29] priest
[34:30] and so you have a levite and a priest
[34:32] who's also a prophet
[34:34] but you didn't have to be a levite and a
[34:36] priest to be a prophet
[34:39] so you have all these different things
[34:41] and you have even
[34:42] like like jeremiah jeremiah amen his
[34:46] life
[34:46] became a symbol of prophecy when he's
[34:48] told to strip his clothes off and lay on
[34:51] one side for so many days
[34:52] and then to flip to the other side and
[34:54] that was going to be a symbol of what
[34:56] was coming to the church
[34:57] but mackay didn't have to do that and
[34:59] isaiah didn't have to do that
[35:02] so when we want when we want a gift to
[35:05] always operate the same time every way
[35:07] we're going to miss what god's sending
[35:09] if they would have wanted jeremiah to
[35:11] act like isaiah
[35:12] when he stripped naked and laid on his
[35:13] side there would have been mass
[35:15] rejection
[35:16] that's not and he was rejected right
[35:20] because sometimes it comes differently
[35:22] than what you expected
[35:24] the prophet hosea was told to go and
[35:27] marry a harlot
[35:30] and to have children and then name them
[35:32] names that would prophesy a condition
[35:34] that was happening
[35:35] and and the names were horrible amen in
[35:38] the lives of the children were horrible
[35:39] but they were acting out amen in their
[35:42] life
[35:43] what was going to happen in prophecy to
[35:45] israel
[35:46] so you can see if if you were in israel
[35:49] that day and god was sending you a
[35:50] prophet and you had in your mind the way
[35:52] a prophet had to act
[35:53] every prophet has to be like moses
[35:56] you'd have missed jeremiah you'd have
[35:59] missed
[36:00] hosea you would have missed so many
[36:03] things if you had to make them all the
[36:05] same
[36:06] so not every prophet is going to have
[36:09] the same administration in the same
[36:11] operation
[36:13] does that make sense i want to explain
[36:16] to you some
[36:17] of of how god is dealing with our
[36:19] brother rich because it's unusual and
[36:21] it's unique to him
[36:22] but we want god to be god and god to
[36:25] decide
[36:26] what the gift is going to look like
[36:28] because
[36:29] because when when god's been dealing
[36:31] with brother rich over the last little
[36:32] bit
[36:33] he's dealt with him with dreams he's
[36:35] dealt with him with visions
[36:37] open vision and the word of the lord has
[36:40] come
[36:40] to a voice he sort of the lord the word
[36:43] of the lord speak to him
[36:44] an interpretation of a dream or a
[36:46] prophecy that will come to pass
[36:49] and so it's not just brother ben said
[36:51] there's a difference between somebody
[36:52] with a gift of prophecy and a prophet
[36:55] he said a gift of prophecy can move from
[36:57] one to the other to the other to the
[36:58] other it doesn't stay on the same person
[37:00] it can be in one person one time and
[37:01] never again
[37:02] and it can go from person to person in
[37:03] the church it can come through tongues
[37:05] and interpretation
[37:06] it can come through a word of knowledge
[37:08] it can come even even a few times in a
[37:10] person's life
[37:11] but a prophet is different than a gift
[37:13] of prophecy
[37:15] but a prophet will have the gift of
[37:16] prophecy
[37:18] but it's different that prophet is built
[37:20] to be a prophet
[37:21] and they operate differently it's not
[37:23] just a gift of prophecy
[37:25] and as uh as brother
[37:28] rich has been talking with me and
[37:30] sharing with me and we've been talking
[37:32] for him these are new things too and
[37:34] when brother rich first come
[37:36] to talk to me it's not like he had
[37:37] everything ironed out and knew where he
[37:38] was going and what was happening
[37:40] these things were happening to him
[37:42] uncontrollably
[37:43] involuntarily things were just happening
[37:45] he'd have a dream he'd have a vision the
[37:47] word of the lord would come to him
[37:48] and things would happen and it was
[37:50] involuntary
[37:51] but he he he wasn't able to say this is
[37:54] that i
[37:55] i know exactly what god's doing he's
[37:57] saying this is just happening
[37:59] just like it would be for any of us this
[38:01] is just happening
[38:03] but the beauty of it is we've known
[38:04] brother rich for how long how long have
[38:06] you been here brother rich
[38:07] 20 some years brother rich hasn't been
[38:11] chasing crazy stuff and in the
[38:12] fanaticism for 20 some years
[38:14] he's been a steady stable brother in the
[38:17] church
[38:19] so when these things begin to happen you
[38:21] have to take notice it's not
[38:23] it's not like somebody who's always on
[38:25] the fringes
[38:26] and somebody who's always dabbling in
[38:28] something way off here
[38:30] and but no this is a brother right among
[38:33] us
[38:34] who's having prophetic things happen to
[38:36] him that are unusual unusual to him
[38:39] unusual to us but you have to take note
[38:41] when you begin to see a pattern set in
[38:44] and you begin to see things happen
[38:46] another thing that
[38:47] that is unusual with what happens with
[38:49] brother rich is
[38:51] god will do something in his life and
[38:54] and something will happen to him in his
[38:57] physical life
[38:58] at work or with family or whatever
[39:00] something that's happening
[39:02] and and it will play out like everything
[39:04] in our lives play out
[39:06] circumstances will come to pass things
[39:08] will happen
[39:09] and then then all of a sudden god will
[39:12] come to him
[39:13] and he said many times god will come to
[39:15] him when he's going to bring an
[39:16] interpretation or give him a revelation
[39:18] of what's happening
[39:19] he said he'll wake him up in the morning
[39:22] and not when he's not quite awake and
[39:23] he's not yet asleep but somewhere in
[39:25] between
[39:25] the word of the lord will come he said
[39:27] he may speak a phrase
[39:29] may speak just a few words but when that
[39:31] happens the whole revelation of the
[39:33] event downloads
[39:34] and he's got the whole interpretation
[39:36] and then he'll look back and see
[39:38] what was taking place in his life was
[39:40] just a scenario
[39:42] that god was going to use to show him
[39:44] something that's coming
[39:46] or something that's happening you
[39:48] understand that
[39:50] just like the prophets of old and
[39:54] and there's been several things that's
[39:55] happened several things that the lord
[39:57] has showed him or dealt with him
[39:58] some things have to deal with in into
[40:01] the future somewhere in the future we
[40:02] don't know where
[40:04] some things are happening concurrently
[40:06] and some things have already happened
[40:08] i've watched them
[40:08] come to fruition i've watched them
[40:10] happen but
[40:12] unfortunately i'm not going to be able
[40:13] to share everything with you because
[40:15] some of these things are
[40:16] are very sensitive because they involve
[40:18] people's names
[40:19] and they evolve things that are
[40:21] difficult that are hard
[40:23] and and things that have happened and
[40:25] and i just don't feel like that can be
[40:26] exposed openly
[40:29] but what i did is i asked all the deacon
[40:31] brothers to come together
[40:33] and a couple other brothers in assembly
[40:34] that i know have spiritual gifts
[40:36] and we came together sunday after
[40:38] communion service over in my office
[40:41] and brother rich had the opportunity to
[40:43] share give some background and share
[40:45] what's been happening over the last
[40:47] several years
[40:48] and we met for four and a half hours
[40:52] and there's a lot of details i'm telling
[40:54] you there's a lot of things that go
[40:56] together
[40:57] for four and a half hours he explained
[40:59] to myself which i had already heard it
[41:01] all
[41:01] all the deacons and a couple of the
[41:03] other brothers that i had felt in my
[41:05] heart to have come
[41:06] and after you sit and you listen to
[41:08] everything unfold and everything
[41:10] transpire
[41:11] and you start to see click click click
[41:14] click click you realize
[41:18] this isn't a gift of prophecy this is
[41:21] god's
[41:22] god's raised up a gift of a prophet it's
[41:25] more than just a gift of a prophecy this
[41:27] is this is more than that this is after
[41:30] the
[41:30] new testament order of a prophet
[41:33] and and that doesn't scare me
[41:36] and i hope it doesn't scare you because
[41:39] these things should be here
[41:42] is it unusual yes is it new is anything
[41:44] new under some
[41:45] a suspect that's the way we've been
[41:49] but it shouldn't be because these are
[41:50] actually old things
[41:52] that are coming back to the church this
[41:54] is actually not new things
[41:56] these are things that should have been
[41:57] here all along but we're lost somewhere
[41:59] but it's it's it was established by the
[42:02] apostle paul
[42:03] it was in the book of acts it should
[42:05] have been here all along
[42:07] but great praise be to god is coming
[42:09] back
[42:11] now now me and the brothers when we sit
[42:14] and heard this we
[42:15] we realized god was doing something in
[42:18] our midst
[42:20] and and i'll i'll add this i'll inject
[42:23] inject this here
[42:24] there was another dream that brother
[42:26] rich had
[42:28] in in i'm not going to share with you
[42:30] the dream
[42:31] because he doesn't have the
[42:32] interpretation of it but in the dream
[42:34] when you begin to describe it
[42:36] it's obvious that there's something
[42:38] going to happen there's going to be
[42:40] something that god's going to do
[42:41] that he's going to make his bride aware
[42:43] of ahead of time and it's going to be
[42:45] i believe with all my heart on a big
[42:46] scale but
[42:49] but yet brother rich didn't get thus
[42:50] saith the lord on he doesn't have a word
[42:52] from the lord he doesn't have the
[42:53] interpretation
[42:54] you know so there's no presuming and we
[42:58] don't want to presume we don't want to
[42:59] say that we know it might be this
[43:00] but from everything that we i look at i
[43:02] can see i i sense in my spirit there's
[43:04] something that god wants to share with
[43:06] us
[43:06] to prepare us for the future but
[43:10] i i'm saying that for this reason
[43:13] when we heard everything that was
[43:15] happening we heard the testimony and we
[43:17] got to see for ourselves what god has
[43:19] been doing
[43:20] i realized that in
[43:24] this is just brother chad only brother
[43:26] chad i can't say
[43:27] that the lord told me this but inside in
[43:29] my spirit i sensed
[43:31] we better not miss our opportunity
[43:34] that i felt like we need to receive the
[43:37] gift god's given
[43:38] us and if we can receive by faith the
[43:41] gift god's given us
[43:42] and we can pray as a body i believe god
[43:45] will use that gift to bring the
[43:46] interpretation of the dream
[43:48] instead of waiting for the
[43:49] interpretation to dream and wait for
[43:51] everything to be in a nice package and
[43:53] come and tell you
[43:54] thus thus doesn't us i i don't want to
[43:57] wait for that
[43:58] i want to move when god moves and move
[44:00] by faith and if we can recognize that
[44:02] god's raised the gift of among us i want
[44:04] to accept it as from god
[44:06] and then pray and pull on the gift and
[44:08] believe that god will give the
[44:09] interpretation of the dream
[44:11] so that's not wishy-washy it's not
[44:12] presuming it's not any man's idea but
[44:15] it's
[44:15] of the lord and and so that's
[44:19] that's what we're what's what we're
[44:21] wanting to do today we're wanting
[44:23] to to receive what god's giving us we're
[44:26] wanting to accept what god's doing and
[44:27] we want to accept it by faith
[44:30] amen i want to take a look at a
[44:34] at a new testament prophet in the book
[44:36] of acts if we can turn to acts 11
[44:38] together
[44:40] and just lay this in here
[44:50] acts chapter 11
[44:55] and verse 27
[44:59] and in those days came prophets from
[45:01] jerusalem unto antioch
[45:03] and there stood up one one of them named
[45:06] agabus and signified by the spirit
[45:08] that there should be great dearth
[45:10] throughout all the world which came to
[45:12] pass in the days of claudius caesar
[45:14] then the disciples every man according
[45:16] to his ability determined to send relief
[45:18] unto the brethren
[45:19] which dwelt in judea which also they did
[45:22] and sent it to the elders by the hands
[45:23] of barnabas and saul
[45:26] so now from jerusalem comes prophets
[45:28] down into antioch
[45:30] and one of them named agabus stands up
[45:32] and he prophesies
[45:33] of a worldwide famine you get this
[45:37] a worldwide famine and why does he
[45:39] prophesy of a worldwide famine
[45:41] so that the church can be prepared so
[45:44] that they can start putting money aside
[45:46] so they could help out those that are in
[45:47] judea
[45:49] and guess who took the money
[45:52] paul and barnabas guess what
[45:57] paul didn't prophesy of the famine
[46:01] another prophet did you see what i'm
[46:05] saying
[46:06] it wasn't all in one source it wasn't
[46:08] all in one place
[46:09] that god had there was another prophet
[46:11] not on the same level of paul agabis
[46:14] we don't have anything agabus wrote we
[46:17] don't have anywhere where agabus
[46:18] set the word straight i mean we don't
[46:20] have anywhere where activists left the
[46:22] book behind
[46:22] we don't have anywhere where agabus took
[46:24] the law and placed it in grace
[46:26] that was paul's job paul was the one who
[46:28] laid the word down
[46:29] paul was the one who brought the old
[46:30] testament into the new testament
[46:32] amen but that was paul's job agabus
[46:34] wasn't going to do it
[46:35] but even though paul was there god still
[46:38] had a gift that could raise up and
[46:40] prophesy
[46:42] and call for a world and say there's
[46:44] going to be a worldwide famine
[46:46] and it happened that's the important
[46:49] part
[46:49] it happened let's go over to acts 21.
[46:59] and verse eight
[47:04] and the next day we that were of paul's
[47:06] company departed and came into caesarea
[47:09] and we entered into the house of philip
[47:11] the evangelist which was one of the
[47:12] seven and abode with him
[47:14] and the same man had four daughters
[47:16] virgins which did prophesy
[47:18] so this wasn't a weird thing in the new
[47:19] testament
[47:21] they come to his house and he's got
[47:22] daughters there that they prophesy
[47:25] amen praise be god and verse 10
[47:28] you know i want to get to where we can
[47:30] say that common
[47:32] where that doesn't become weird for us
[47:33] but we can say hey
[47:35] that man's got daughters who prophesy
[47:37] and that's not a weird statement
[47:39] and that doesn't give anybody a a a
[47:42] scare
[47:43] or a fear but it becomes a normal part
[47:45] of our lives
[47:48] verse 10 and as we tarried there many
[47:50] days there came down from judea a
[47:52] certain prophet named agabus
[47:54] and when he was come unto us he took
[47:56] paul's girdle and bound his own hands
[47:58] and feet
[47:59] and said and said thus saith the holy
[48:02] ghost
[48:03] so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the
[48:05] man that owneth this girdle
[48:07] and shall deliver him into the hands of
[48:08] the gentiles when we heard these things
[48:11] both we and they of that place besought
[48:13] him not to go up to jerusalem
[48:15] then paul answered what me need to weep
[48:17] and to break my heart
[48:19] for i'm ready not to be bound only but
[48:21] also to die at jerusalem for the name of
[48:23] the lord jesus
[48:24] so activist comes down and the apostle
[48:27] paul is there
[48:28] the prophet of the age but activist is a
[48:31] gift
[48:31] activist is the office of prophet in the
[48:33] church and he comes down and takes
[48:34] paul's girdle
[48:35] ties up his own hand and said this is
[48:37] what will happen to the man that owns
[48:38] the girdle
[48:39] and it happened so i mean
[48:43] it happened that's the important part it
[48:45] wasn't important that he said it what
[48:46] was important is that it happened
[48:49] because that's the office of a prophet
[48:53] now in the message demonology
[48:57] religious realm 1953
[49:00] prophet says now you said well the
[49:02] prophets are the old testament oh no the
[49:05] new testament had prophets
[49:07] you believe that are we a new testament
[49:10] church
[49:11] we're going back to the book of acts
[49:12] church said agabus was a new testament
[49:15] prophet look at the spirit of prophecy
[49:17] falling down there and telling paul
[49:19] then then here come against down from
[49:21] jerusalem and found paul and tied his
[49:22] girdle around him and
[49:23] turned over and said thus saith the lord
[49:25] the man that wore this will be bound and
[49:26] chains when he gets to jerusalem
[49:28] agabus who stood up and told foretold
[49:30] what would take place he was a prophet
[49:32] not a man with the gift of prophecy see
[49:35] there's a difference
[49:37] let's turn to acts chapter 9.
[49:45] that's chapter 9 and verse 10
[49:52] and there was a certain disciple at
[49:54] damascus named ananias
[49:56] and to him said the lord in a vision
[49:58] ananias and he said behold i am here
[50:00] lord
[50:01] and the lord said unto him arise and go
[50:03] into the street which is called straight
[50:04] and inquire in the house of judas for
[50:06] one called saul of tarsus
[50:08] for behold he prayeth and he has seen in
[50:10] a vision a man named
[50:12] ananias coming in and putting his hand
[50:13] on him that he might receive his sight
[50:16] and ananias answered lord
[50:19] i have heard by many of this man of how
[50:22] much evil he hath done to the saint of
[50:23] jerusalem
[50:24] and hear he hath authority from the
[50:26] chief priest to bind all that call on
[50:27] thy name
[50:29] but the lord said unto him go thy way
[50:31] for he is a chosen vessel unto me
[50:33] to bear my name before the gentiles and
[50:35] kings and the children of israel
[50:36] for i will show him how great things he
[50:38] must suffer for my name's sake
[50:40] and ananias went his way and entered
[50:42] into the house and putting his hands on
[50:44] him
[50:44] said brother saul the lord even jesus
[50:47] that appeared unto thee in the way
[50:49] as thou camest hath sent me that thou
[50:51] mightest receive thy sight and be filled
[50:53] with the holy
[50:54] ghost so god is speaking to ananias but
[50:57] but brother branham says here in
[50:59] questions and answers in 1964
[51:02] said i believe paul the reason that he
[51:03] had to be baptized again is he
[51:05] persecuted the christians that's right
[51:07] god knew
[51:08] because i have chosen him he said to
[51:10] ananias the prophet
[51:13] so what if brother branham called
[51:14] ananias here he called him a prophet
[51:17] so ananias the prophet new testament
[51:19] book of acts
[51:21] prophet not just a gift of prophecy but
[51:24] a prophet
[51:27] he said ananias the prophet now
[51:30] go down to 1951 here our hope is in god
[51:33] now the sixth chapter in the eighth
[51:35] verse listen closely god never promised
[51:37] to bless my word but he promised to
[51:39] bless his word
[51:40] and now listen closely now as we're
[51:42] duplicating the day
[51:44] when this great man elisha who had a
[51:45] double portion of the spirit of elijah
[51:48] there never was in the age any two major
[51:50] prophets on the earth at the same time
[51:52] there were many minor prophets but there
[51:54] were one major prophet
[51:56] you got that there's only one major
[51:58] prophet there's only one prophet of the
[51:59] age there's only one brother branham but
[52:00] brother braden said many minor prophets
[52:03] remember when elijah was on the earth
[52:05] and elijah and elisha was walking
[52:06] together
[52:07] and and the manna was going to move from
[52:10] elijah to elisha
[52:11] elijah was the major prophet but then
[52:13] elijah was going to be the major prophet
[52:15] but as they were moving down to jericho
[52:18] to cross jericho
[52:19] amen they came in contact with the
[52:21] school of the
[52:22] prophets there was a group of prophets
[52:25] together and they prophesied and they
[52:28] knew what was going to happen they were
[52:30] prophesying
[52:31] that your master will be taken up today
[52:33] and elisha knew it he was a prophet too
[52:35] he said i know keep your peace
[52:37] so there was the school of the prophets
[52:39] but there was the major prophet
[52:42] in the days of elijah and elisha amen
[52:45] before
[52:46] this transpired elijah had already
[52:48] cursed ahab
[52:50] right he had already cursed he had to be
[52:52] already pronounced judgment on ahab
[52:53] he was the prophet of the age he was the
[52:56] major prophet
[52:57] amen but at the same time that he was
[52:59] still around
[53:00] amen when jehoshaphat came up to speak
[53:03] to ahab and they were going to join
[53:04] forces together to take back
[53:06] part of their land amen they called for
[53:08] a prophet and they had 400 but that
[53:10] wasn't good enough for jehoshaphat he
[53:12] needed one more
[53:13] and they brought makaya what was bacaya
[53:16] mackay was a prophet
[53:17] and mekiah prophesied amen he saw
[53:21] amen a whole conversation and a scene
[53:23] play out in heaven
[53:25] and brother brennan said he checked his
[53:27] vision with the prophecy
[53:29] because there was a major prophet on
[53:31] earth that had already foretold what
[53:33] would happen
[53:34] so the minor prophet has to check his
[53:37] prophecy with the major prophet of the
[53:38] age
[53:39] amen that makes sense
[53:43] so mechaia amen he was operating the
[53:46] office of a prophet but brother branham
[53:48] said he saw it
[53:49] he saw what took place but he said he
[53:50] had to check it
[53:52] with what elijah said if god raises up a
[53:56] prophet among us it's going to operate
[53:57] the same way it's got to be checked with
[53:59] what elijah said
[54:00] because that's the word that was
[54:01] restored in this day
[54:04] but yet mikaya was there
[54:07] yet mackay had an office yet makai was
[54:10] operating in it
[54:11] as a minor prophet but yet he was still
[54:13] a prophet
[54:14] yet he still saw what took place in
[54:16] heaven he told it
[54:17] and it happened
[54:21] that's the key it happened
[54:32] brother branham said in jehovah jireh in
[54:34] 1955
[54:36] so now there's a difference between gift
[54:38] of prophecy and a prophet
[54:40] one is a gift of prophecy and the other
[54:42] one is a prophet
[54:43] a gift of prophecy must be judged by two
[54:45] or three spiritual men
[54:47] it can come upon one person tonight
[54:50] being another person tomorrow night and
[54:52] on another one the next night
[54:53] what it is is a gift in every local body
[54:55] a church
[54:56] but a prophet is different they are born
[54:59] a prophet and they come up prophets
[55:01] and all that they say must be true every
[55:03] time
[55:04] or it cannot be recognized as a prophet
[55:06] in the office
[55:08] you see that's a tight stipulation it's
[55:10] a difference between
[55:11] gift of prophecy and profit if it's a
[55:14] prophet
[55:16] all that they say must be true every
[55:18] time
[55:19] not hit or miss not once in a while
[55:22] every time
[55:23] or it cannot be recognized as a prophet
[55:26] in the office
[55:28] so you see it's different it's not a
[55:30] gift of prophecy
[55:32] it's the office of prophet and that's a
[55:34] person who's raised up with the gift of
[55:36] a prophet
[55:37] not many people who can catch something
[55:39] or catch something here
[55:40] catch them there have a spiritual dream
[55:42] and god give them an interpretation
[55:44] it's different they're constructed to be
[55:46] a prophet
[55:47] and like i said before with our brother
[55:50] rich it wasn't just a dream
[55:52] here or a dream there it wasn't a word
[55:54] of knowledge here or there
[55:55] but it was a dream with the word of the
[55:58] lord as an interpretation
[56:01] with an open vision with a life scenario
[56:04] that plays out
[56:05] then god wakes him up gives him the
[56:07] interpretation scenario
[56:08] and watches the same thing play out in
[56:11] the church exactly like it was foretold
[56:14] i've seen that happen so it's more than
[56:16] just a gift of prophecy friends
[56:19] god has raised up among us an office
[56:22] raised up among us a gift and
[56:25] and we have an opportunity to receive it
[56:29] or reject it and i for one want to
[56:32] receive what god sends when god sins
[56:36] god's responsible for watching over it
[56:39] god's not going to let it go awry
[56:41] god loves brother rich god loves you and
[56:43] i
[56:45] if we can stay together and stay in
[56:47] humility and
[56:48] have the proper understanding of what
[56:50] god's doing among us and can place it in
[56:52] the scriptures
[56:53] and place it in the message and stay
[56:55] together god will not let anything go
[56:57] awry
[56:58] god will keep it on track because he
[57:00] loves his bride and he doesn't want her
[57:02] to be deceived and god's given us enough
[57:04] word to know how to check it
[57:06] everything must happen every time
[57:10] so so god's not going to let his bride
[57:13] be taken this way or that way he's going
[57:14] to keep her on track
[57:16] we're in the final moments of this race
[57:20] and i've explained to you a little bit
[57:22] uh
[57:23] as best as i understand on second hand
[57:25] information
[57:26] how the gift has been operating but
[57:29] i said that so that you understand
[57:32] brother rich has no control over it
[57:34] he can't make a dream come he can't make
[57:37] an interpretation to a dream come
[57:39] he can't do anything he's just there and
[57:40] it happens sometimes things happen in
[57:42] clusters things
[57:43] events will happen close together and
[57:45] then there'll be nothing happen for
[57:47] months
[57:48] or nothing that he's aware of having
[57:49] from nuns and then maybe something
[57:50] happens he looks back and say
[57:51] something's been happening all along
[57:53] it's very
[57:54] unpredictable it's it's completely up to
[57:56] god it's god
[57:57] operating a gift it's not a man
[57:59] operating it
[58:01] and so i say that to say this it's not
[58:04] the kind of gift like brother branham
[58:06] had
[58:06] where you can go up to him and you can
[58:08] say you know where's my lost keys
[58:12] you know what i mean i don't want us to
[58:14] get the wrong understanding
[58:16] and i don't want to put the wrong kind
[58:17] of pressure on our brother we don't want
[58:19] to put any pressure
[58:20] brother bannon said brother brother
[58:22] neville had a gift of discernment and
[58:24] a gift of prophet to a gift of prophecy
[58:27] but he said the people were pushing
[58:29] pulling him in the air trying to get him
[58:31] to operate it
[58:33] you know and he had to correct brother
[58:35] neville and tell him not to do that
[58:37] amen so we've got to be careful this
[58:38] isn't it's not a mirror image of what
[58:40] brother branham was doing
[58:41] it's not even like brother abraham he's
[58:43] got a different gift it's not like you
[58:45] can go in
[58:45] and say you know has the lord showed you
[58:47] anything about me
[58:50] we don't want to be children we want to
[58:51] be mature we want to be
[58:53] solid we want to be stable we don't want
[58:55] to be childish we don't want to just
[58:57] take gifts and play with them
[58:58] we want to understand how god sends them
[59:01] they come in
[59:02] different diversity of gifts with
[59:04] different administrations and with
[59:05] different operations
[59:06] and we want to just watch and see how
[59:08] god uses our brother
[59:10] and how things come out amen and not
[59:12] push and not
[59:13] and not try to persuade and not be
[59:15] childish
[59:17] more than anything god has built us up
[59:19] to maturity and keeps growing us in
[59:20] maturity
[59:21] and he expects us if he's going to bring
[59:23] a gift he expects us to take it in
[59:24] maturity
[59:26] and be mature about it and so it's it's
[59:29] not
[59:30] it's not something that's frivolous and
[59:32] it's not it's not like
[59:34] it may not be like something you've ever
[59:35] seen operate before
[59:37] but it doesn't have to it can operate
[59:40] the way god wants it to operate
[59:42] but god has opened up another channel
[59:45] another office another way
[59:47] for him to speak to us and i for one am
[59:51] thankful
[59:53] god has is restoring even us
[59:56] as a local assembly he's bringing us
[59:58] back to the picture he had in the book
[1:00:00] of acts
[1:00:00] he's bringing us back to the fullness of
[1:00:02] the word amen and it was something he
[1:00:04] did in his time nobody pulled for it
[1:00:06] nobody pushed for it nobody tried to
[1:00:08] make it happen no man has anything to do
[1:00:10] with this
[1:00:12] and for that i'm especially thankful
[1:00:15] and so i want to have the right
[1:00:17] understanding that there's a gift among
[1:00:19] us if god wants to let us know something
[1:00:21] there's a gift among us we can be
[1:00:23] praying and i want to tell you now
[1:00:25] there there is a dream attached to a
[1:00:28] prophecy that has something to do that i
[1:00:30] know
[1:00:30] god wants to tell his bride before it
[1:00:32] happens
[1:00:33] i know that but i believe if we receive
[1:00:36] what god is giving us and we receive it
[1:00:38] by faith and we receive it in maturity
[1:00:40] and we say god would you give brother
[1:00:42] rich the interpretation of that dream
[1:00:44] i believe what we're doing here today
[1:00:46] amen is going to please the lord
[1:00:48] and i believe the lord is going to allow
[1:00:50] that to operate
[1:00:52] but we have to take it in maturity we
[1:00:53] all have to be responsible
[1:00:55] because it's one body with one purpose
[1:00:57] if god's raising up a gift it's not for
[1:00:59] that person to become a superman
[1:01:02] if god's raising up a gift it's for the
[1:01:04] edification of the body
[1:01:07] god doesn't raise up a ministry gift so
[1:01:08] that minister can be a superman
[1:01:10] that minister is the servant of all
[1:01:14] that's what minister means ministry
[1:01:16] means to serve
[1:01:18] and there's a fivefold ministry all of
[1:01:20] those offices are there to serve the
[1:01:21] body
[1:01:22] this is for the edification of the body
[1:01:24] this is for the building up and
[1:01:25] perfecting of the saints
[1:01:27] it's not for any man to get anything and
[1:01:30] i assure you
[1:01:31] i promise you out of all the men that i
[1:01:34] know that have stepped out in faith in
[1:01:35] an office god's got them
[1:01:36] i promise you it comes with a cost
[1:01:40] and our brother he'll he has to pay the
[1:01:43] price to bear that
[1:01:47] and i want you to pray for him i want
[1:01:49] you to pray for brother rich and for his
[1:01:51] family
[1:01:52] that god will keep him humble keep him
[1:01:55] tuned in
[1:01:56] keep him you know give him the right
[1:01:57] understanding helping to stay sensitive
[1:02:00] and
[1:02:00] and and help us to be sensitive and be
[1:02:03] mature
[1:02:04] and let us pray for one another and hold
[1:02:05] each other up and encourage one another
[1:02:07] and love one another god
[1:02:11] i believe this is there's just more to
[1:02:13] come
[1:02:14] i believe if we can approach this the
[1:02:16] right way there's more to come
[1:02:22] brother branham said in 1962 putting on
[1:02:24] the whole armor of god
[1:02:26] now golf forfeited his army
[1:02:29] i'm sorry god fortified that's a
[1:02:32] different meaning
[1:02:35] i need a drink i'm going to take a drink
[1:02:40] god fortified his army what with himself
[1:02:43] in the form of prophets
[1:02:45] apostles teachers pastors
[1:02:48] what did he do what was god doing listen
[1:02:51] did you ever
[1:02:51] think what the offices of the church is
[1:02:54] it's god's dress
[1:02:55] inside dress an apostle a prophet a seer
[1:02:58] foresee before satan ever gets to it
[1:03:00] dunn told it what is it god dressed up
[1:03:03] in his church
[1:03:04] these offices is god's dress wear
[1:03:08] when you see those offices pastor
[1:03:10] teachers avengers what is that
[1:03:11] that's god's dress where god's presence
[1:03:14] god's spirit
[1:03:15] working through man
[1:03:19] 1963 questions and answers on the seals
[1:03:22] there's a question would the bride of
[1:03:23] christ would the bride of christ have a
[1:03:25] ministry before the rapture
[1:03:28] brother bram says sure that's what's
[1:03:30] going on right now see
[1:03:31] the bride of christ certainly it is the
[1:03:34] message of the hour the bride of christ
[1:03:35] sure
[1:03:36] she's consists of apostle prophet
[1:03:38] teachers evangelists and pastors is that
[1:03:40] right
[1:03:41] that's the bride of christ sure she's
[1:03:43] got a ministry
[1:03:44] great ministry it's the ministry of the
[1:03:46] hour it's
[1:03:47] so humble it'll be so humble
[1:03:52] what's the ministry of the bride
[1:03:53] consists of apostle prophets teaches
[1:03:55] pastors evangelists
[1:03:57] it'll be so humble it'll be a
[1:04:00] regular brother
[1:04:03] just a regular brother that you didn't
[1:04:06] expect
[1:04:07] a regular brother that there's something
[1:04:09] laying there
[1:04:10] that in due time god's going to draw it
[1:04:12] out
[1:04:13] he does the same thing when he calls a
[1:04:15] preacher a pastor or an evangelist
[1:04:18] or an apostle it's the same thing amen
[1:04:20] there's something there that god
[1:04:21] ordained to be there and in due
[1:04:23] time he brings it to the surface just a
[1:04:26] common brother just a regular person
[1:04:28] just somebody
[1:04:29] that you may not have expected before
[1:04:30] but all of a sudden god does it
[1:04:32] and when god does it god vindicates it
[1:04:36] i'm going to say when we were we met
[1:04:38] this past sunday
[1:04:40] for four and a half hours we learned and
[1:04:42] we heard the vindication we heard
[1:04:44] and and i wish that i could share with
[1:04:46] each one of you everything i heard but
[1:04:47] it's just too sensitive
[1:04:49] it'll cause too many problems but but
[1:04:51] but the brothers were with me
[1:04:54] and we heard and we saw the vindication
[1:04:56] we saw what god was doing
[1:04:58] and and with anticipation looking to
[1:05:02] what god
[1:05:03] will do and
[1:05:08] in my heart it was just a surreal moment
[1:05:11] i said if we can trust god
[1:05:14] if we can just trust god and
[1:05:17] not be timid and not be fearful
[1:05:21] not be timid every time we come to a new
[1:05:23] junction
[1:05:25] not be fearful every time something
[1:05:27] different happens
[1:05:29] but check it with the word and if it's
[1:05:32] in the word
[1:05:34] then let us move forward with faith that
[1:05:36] god's doing something
[1:05:39] not everything that's different wrong
[1:05:42] not everything that's different wrong
[1:05:45] not every junction
[1:05:46] not every junction is a disaster
[1:05:51] god's bringing his church higher and
[1:05:53] higher
[1:05:54] and higher and i personally believe
[1:05:56] there's
[1:05:57] more gifts to be mined out of this
[1:05:59] assembly
[1:06:00] but it's not going to be done by the
[1:06:02] effort of a man it's not going to be
[1:06:04] done by an
[1:06:04] intellectual deal it's going to be done
[1:06:06] by if we accept what god gives us now
[1:06:09] he'll give more
[1:06:10] and if you receive what god gives you
[1:06:12] he'll give more and if you receive but
[1:06:13] if you don't receive and you're too
[1:06:15] afraid to take it
[1:06:16] and you're too timid in what god's doing
[1:06:18] then you'll just sit right there until
[1:06:20] you can receive what god's giving but
[1:06:21] then when you receive what god giving he
[1:06:23] can give
[1:06:23] more and i want to be
[1:06:26] right where god is on the mark amen
[1:06:30] not ahead not behind not to the right
[1:06:33] not to the left but right on the mark
[1:06:38] we met like i said for four and a half
[1:06:40] hours i got home at 11 30 at night and
[1:06:43] i was exhausted because it was just
[1:06:45] emotional it was just
[1:06:47] overwhelming and it was long
[1:06:51] and you know then
[1:06:55] my wife waited up for me and i talked to
[1:06:57] her and was sharing with her some things
[1:06:58] that were going on and
[1:07:00] got in bed maybe 12 30 or 1 finally
[1:07:02] drifted off to sleep
[1:07:05] and i i woke up in the morning and these
[1:07:07] things are heavy on me
[1:07:09] you know it's one of those things you
[1:07:10] recognize this is a moment god's asking
[1:07:13] us to step up
[1:07:14] this is real something's happening and
[1:07:16] god wants us to be tuned in and aware
[1:07:18] and he wants us to step up and he wants
[1:07:20] us to accept what he's doing
[1:07:22] and i i realize it's a heavy moment not
[1:07:24] a bad moment but a heavy moment
[1:07:27] and i feel as a pastor i feel the weight
[1:07:29] the full gravity of the moment
[1:07:32] and and so i wake up in the morning and
[1:07:35] i go to pray and
[1:07:36] my wife and i we do devotions together
[1:07:38] every morning and
[1:07:39] brother abraham myra he sends out a
[1:07:42] little daily devotion every day with a
[1:07:43] scripture
[1:07:44] and a quote and he just grabs it off
[1:07:46] voice of god website the daily bread and
[1:07:48] then he adds another quote behind it
[1:07:50] and so like i said we were in this
[1:07:52] meeting we heard all these things we
[1:07:53] discussed these things
[1:07:55] get to bed that night 12 31 wake up
[1:07:58] seven in the morning and wake up my wife
[1:08:01] and
[1:08:01] we we sit down and i open up that thing
[1:08:03] brother abraham sent
[1:08:05] and the first scripture my eyes laid on
[1:08:08] that he sent to me i didn't go look it
[1:08:09] up
[1:08:10] said he that will receive a prophet in
[1:08:12] the name of a prophet will receive a
[1:08:13] prophet's reward
[1:08:18] i said that's not coincidence
[1:08:23] that's just what me and the brothers
[1:08:24] talked about and that's just what we
[1:08:25] decided that we were going to receive
[1:08:26] what god was sending
[1:08:28] as god sent it receive it by faith and
[1:08:30] trust god
[1:08:34] he the receiver the prophet in the name
[1:08:35] of a prophet shall receive a prophet's
[1:08:37] reward
[1:08:38] brother branham said they asked him
[1:08:40] what's a prophet's reward he said it's
[1:08:41] to be the friend of a prophet
[1:08:44] well i was already brother rich's friend
[1:08:49] but i think it means more than that i
[1:08:52] think if you're the friend of the
[1:08:53] prophet what do you get
[1:08:55] prophecy
[1:08:59] to be the friend of the prophet is the
[1:09:01] one that gets to hear the prophecy
[1:09:06] and the question is do we want it
[1:09:09] do we want what god's giving us will we
[1:09:11] receive it by faith
[1:09:13] not fanaticism not immaturity not
[1:09:16] pushing or pulling not
[1:09:18] going too far this way but we'll receive
[1:09:20] what god's doing as god's doing and say
[1:09:22] god i see you're doing something
[1:09:24] i receive it by faith and when we pray
[1:09:27] for god to keep leading
[1:09:30] as a body can we pray and say god i see
[1:09:33] what you're doing i recognize it i
[1:09:35] receive it by faith
[1:09:36] and god i pray that you would you would
[1:09:38] watch over us that you would
[1:09:39] bless our brother rich that you would
[1:09:41] bless all the all the elders in the
[1:09:43] church you bless each one of us with the
[1:09:45] right approach and the right attitude
[1:09:46] and keep us marching forward right and
[1:09:48] step with your word
[1:09:50] will you pray that way we pray for
[1:09:52] brother rich and his family
[1:09:54] amen god is good friends
[1:09:59] it's amazing that we as a body of
[1:10:02] believers
[1:10:03] we've been through so much i mean so
[1:10:06] much
[1:10:08] and and for those of us have been around
[1:10:09] for any length of time we've been
[1:10:11] through so much
[1:10:12] and it's like god has never let us stay
[1:10:15] the same
[1:10:17] for the last five years he's never let
[1:10:19] us stay the same
[1:10:20] he's always brings a challenge and he
[1:10:23] asks us to rise up
[1:10:24] rise to the occasion he brings another
[1:10:27] challenge he brings a correction
[1:10:28] he brings an understanding he brings a
[1:10:31] teaching i mean it's it's non-stop
[1:10:34] constant
[1:10:35] it's a challenge it's a lifting up it's
[1:10:36] a challenge it's a lifting up
[1:10:38] it's a challenge to lifting up but i
[1:10:41] want to ask you how many of you are
[1:10:42] flying higher now than you've ever flown
[1:10:44] in your life
[1:10:46] why because god doesn't want us to stay
[1:10:48] the same
[1:10:50] we are not coasting like we are now all
[1:10:53] the way to the change in the body
[1:10:54] but we're going to be going higher and
[1:10:56] higher and higher
[1:10:58] and there's going to be more perfect
[1:11:00] manifestation
[1:11:02] of the entire body of christ this is not
[1:11:04] a one-man ministry anymore
[1:11:07] this is not just a few gifted people and
[1:11:09] everybody else watching it
[1:11:10] this is the whole body getting into
[1:11:12] position in every joint supplying
[1:11:14] and what we've seen temporarily we're
[1:11:16] going to see in the fullness
[1:11:18] fullness of its power
[1:11:19] [Applause]
[1:11:21] not by one man doing it not by a group
[1:11:23] of men doing it
[1:11:24] but the whole body is going to be every
[1:11:27] joint that supplies
[1:11:30] you could i can take my little finger
[1:11:32] like this
[1:11:33] and start bending it
[1:11:36] and you could say that fingers operating
[1:11:39] independent of the rest of the body
[1:11:40] and that's a lie because my heart has to
[1:11:44] beat
[1:11:44] my bone marrow has to make blood i every
[1:11:48] system in my body has to be working my
[1:11:50] nervous system my brain
[1:11:52] every function my lungs everything has
[1:11:54] to be working
[1:11:55] just to do that there's no
[1:11:58] independent action in the body every
[1:12:01] system is relying on every other system
[1:12:04] for every action
[1:12:06] and if we can operate it as a body then
[1:12:09] you'll see the finger move and the hand
[1:12:10] moving the leg
[1:12:11] everything will begin to function if we
[1:12:13] realize that i want to stay plugged in
[1:12:16] i want to i want to be a contributing
[1:12:18] part of the body
[1:12:19] amen and i want to be whatever system
[1:12:21] god has whatever place he has
[1:12:23] i want to be fully functioning so
[1:12:25] anything he wants to do he can do it
[1:12:28] there's no independent we're all
[1:12:30] individual members with an individual
[1:12:32] connection to god
[1:12:33] amen but that individual connection to
[1:12:35] god ties us and links us
[1:12:37] all together in an inseparable bond
[1:12:39] where we are mutually dependent on one
[1:12:42] another
[1:12:43] there is nobody that's not dependent on
[1:12:46] the rest of the body
[1:12:48] even though we're individuals with god
[1:12:51] with an individual relationship with god
[1:12:53] but that individual relationship is the
[1:12:55] glue that binds us together
[1:12:58] in one body in christ and that body
[1:13:01] has to function like a body
[1:13:05] and nobody's independent
[1:13:08] praise god i don't know about you but
[1:13:12] i'm excited
[1:13:16] i'm so glad god hasn't given us the
[1:13:18] privilege
[1:13:19] of just being a normal church
[1:13:24] we haven't been normal
[1:13:27] it seems like nothing's normal but i
[1:13:30] don't want to be normal
[1:13:32] i don't want to be what i've been i want
[1:13:34] to be what he wants me to be
[1:13:36] i still see more in the message i see
[1:13:39] more in the word of god more
[1:13:40] capabilities more
[1:13:42] untapped resources more potentials to be
[1:13:44] expressed i see more in the message do
[1:13:46] you see more in the message
[1:13:47] if i see more in the message then i'm
[1:13:49] not i'm not going to stay where i'm at
