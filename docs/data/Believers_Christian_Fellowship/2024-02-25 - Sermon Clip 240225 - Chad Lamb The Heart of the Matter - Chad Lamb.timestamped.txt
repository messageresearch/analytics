[0:00] but there has to be a bride at the end
[0:02] time that has the mind of the author
[0:06] there has to be a people that can
[0:09] navigate difficult situations there has
[0:11] to be a people that can land between two
[0:13] Commandments and navigate their way
[0:15] through without taking the easy Road
[0:18] without serving self without justifying
[0:21] wrong action there has to be a people
[0:23] who's honest there has to be a people
[0:25] who's real there has to be a genuine
[0:27] representation of Jesus Christ upon this
[0:29] Earth in the end time there has to be a
[0:31] people who can walk the razor's
[0:34] Edge and I'm not even claiming to be one
[0:36] of those people yet but I believe that
[0:38] he's going to put me in that position
[0:40] because that's what he's called for at
[0:41] this end
[0:42] time there's got to be a people that can
[0:45] look Beyond amen some of the knee-jerk
[0:47] reactions and and look to the motive of
[0:50] the heart and judge with righteous
[0:52] judgment and deal with the weightier
[0:54] matters of the
[0:58] law
[1:00] praise
[1:03] God oh
[1:05] friends I don't always
[1:08] know I don't always know how to proceed
[1:10] I just know how God leads I don't even
[1:12] know why like for me I would love to
[1:15] button this up so tight and give you the
[1:17] parameters on this truth I can't give
[1:18] you the parameters on this truth this
[1:20] walk of a Christian Life is the most
[1:22] dangerous you'll ever walk there's
[1:24] pitfalls everywhere there's landmines
[1:25] all around you there's millions of ways
[1:27] to be completely wrong and there's
[1:29] millions of ways to hurt yourself and
[1:30] hurt other people there's only one way
[1:32] to be right and you've got to be tuned
[1:34] in with Christ you have to be in him and
[1:36] him in you and you got to be surrendered
[1:38] and submitted to that Spirit that's the
[1:40] only way we're going to make it we
[1:43] listen in all the word that's been
[1:44] restored to us and the word has been
[1:46] marvelously restored to us we've got so
[1:49] much word we got the unveiling of the
[1:51] word we've been brought back to the
[1:52] original doctrine of the Apostles but we
[1:54] still find ourselves in situations we
[1:56] don't have a clear answer for and under
[2:00] the unveiling of the word under the
[2:02] restoration of the doctrine under
[2:04] everything that's been put in the right
[2:05] place we still sometimes find ourselves
[2:08] in situations that I don't know which
[2:10] word to
[2:12] apply cuz two or three may fit in this
[2:15] situation amen that's when you're going
[2:17] to have to be led by the
[2:19] spirit
