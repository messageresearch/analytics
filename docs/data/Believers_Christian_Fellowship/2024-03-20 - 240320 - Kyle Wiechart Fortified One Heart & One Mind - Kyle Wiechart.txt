gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful Lord that by your grace you've brought us here again Lord we're so thankful that you've given us another day Lord Lord how your word is so precious to us and every day that we get to hear it it's so precious as I was thinking this morning Lord how Greatful I Am Lord that you came my way many years ago you didn't have to but you did and all of us in our hearts are so thankful that you came our way you didn't have to there was nothing in us that deserved your presence to draw n but you predestinated us to a certain time and a place Lord that we'd hear this most precious word and we would be transformed to the creatures that we were and to sons of God and I just pray Lord God that you would bless this time that you've given us to gather once more father Lord we've come to be made more into your image father we've come come to be cut we've come to be molded shaped Lord uh Lord expose anything in us that's not like you father it's our heart's desire Lord is just to have you reflected through our lives father father I pray that you'd anoint my mind and my lips Lord in a simple humble way Lord help me just say what you once said Lord may you anoint the ears that are before me Lord that they would hear just what you want them to hear father I pray that you would strengthen us and may we all be happy when we leave here tonight we praise you and we thank you in jesus' name amen amen you may be seated for just a moment I always need just a few moments to say something to relax myself you know how this goes uh want to say I appreciate the ones that texted me today I uh really appreciate it I woke up this morning at 3:30 with a migraine and hadn't had a migraine for years and got sick really sick this morning so those text really meant a lot to me it took me until about noon where I felt like I was in my right mind today and so I appreciated those texts brother gab brother Emanuel they really mean a lot just knowing someone's praying for you heard from Brother Chad he's doing well he appreciates all the prayers and everyone I know that's praying for him he was last I heard he was traveling to Melbourne and I really don't know any other places in Australia I should have played more attention in geography class but Down Yonder he's just traveling all over so keep him in in prayer but he said the meetings are going really well I really appreciated brother Simon I know um brother John said that they're at the airport or flying but I think we all appreciated their family being here and I really appreciated the service on Sunday and how often times have we said I go fishing life is frustrating I go fishing we've all been there we've all said that I know I have a few times and Lord will and I won't say that no more we'll walk into the calling that God's called us and the purpose by which he brought us onto this Earth but when we do get discouraged he knows how to encourage us to keep on going appreciated his sermon and I heard brother Gabe had a good service last Sunday that was wonderful I asked him about it and it was just what the the doctor ordered Dr Jesus ordered and I know the people were really blessed and we're praying for you this Sunday too so we'll all be praying for brother Gabe on Sunday and uh you know me I'm trying to go through announcements and make me nervous and then after that we got brother Emanuel I believe on the next Wednesday be praying for you brother and then after that brother Chad will be back and wanted to tell everybody we had a service there on Saturday some of you came I saw some of your faces there it was really nice over in Holmes County they had built a a church there and they wanted to have a dedication services and they invited me over there Saturday night and I was honored to go and say a few words and uh had no clue what I was going to say I really struggled for the service cuz I just didn't know what to expect uh I didn't know where I was going I didn't know what I mean I knew where I was going but I just I had knowwhere I nowhere where I I did not know where I was going in Ministry I didn't know what to preach I just didn't know what to preach and and uh 3 hours before service a little thought came to my mind and um I believe the Lord blessed it I heard that from the people that it was a real blessing to them and it was kind of a strange little title for me I took unlikely unlikely but true Witnesses and uh you know it's an unlikely situation that you see a church over there in Holmes County and God used unlikely individuals through unlikely situation for the glory of God to now make a little Beacon of light over there amongst the Amish that's shining and none of us would have expected it if you were going to coordinate that to be uh a place where the gospel would go forth none of us would have put together a plan like that one everyone um but God likes to do things in unusual ways and he uses us as unusual peop uh to be true Witnesses of his grace and of his mercy and um and I it it was a blessing just to be there I was really happy and and I uh so appreciated so many that did come out um and so tonight you know it fth my lot yes here I am again and uh I was so uh I knew brother Chad asked me to take a service going to Australia and a couple weeks ago and I was sitting there when brother John kadema was preaching and oh I was so excited I caught inspiration I wrote down a whole page of notes it was awesome brother gab I mean it was like you feel so good about it you know he's like oh man I really love this and and in my mind I was like yep yep I got service coming up two and a half weeks this is unusual for me everyone I'm preaching that I got two and a half weeks to prepare get everything lined up perfectly and then brother Chad preached my entire inspiration that Sunday in the matters of the heart matters of the heart and it was bittersweet like I was enjoying it and yet I was so upset you know it's a minister I'm like now I have to labor and strain and he just knows how to keep us tore up he just he don't let us get real comfortable but I think that's how he wanted it he never wanted us shifting for ourselves he wanted you and I to be dependent upon him for every day every hour every minute of every day and every hour and so it was bittersweet but it was um it yeah God knows what he's doing so I had to go back to prayer and seek God's face for inspiration and here we are tonight so if you will stand with me I uh I'm just going to follow a little leading a little thought I haven't been able to get away from for oh about a week now and I just kept pushing it aside and till finally I just kind of went with it this morning and we'll see all the twists and the turns that we take um but we just trust the leadership of the Lord I I think that's how we wanted it in the beginning and take no thought for what you'll say I'll tell you what to say in the hour in which you're going to say it and so I'm learning to trust him in that so if you will turn in your Bibles to Psalms 61:2 Psalm 61:2 just say Amen when you're there from the end of the Earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I for thou Hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever I will trust in the covert of thy wings and if you will turn to Philippians chapters 2 verse 1 I think almost every Minister has ministered from this portion of scripture here in the last few months and it just seems like I can never get away from it here lately the word of God reads if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels of mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife for vain Glory but in lonliness of Mind each esteem Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross May God add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated this [Music] evening and a portion of that word that I uh scriptures that I'd like to really hone in on is uh the second verse fulfill ye my joy that you be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord and of one mind as a title I'd like to title this fortified in one heart and in one mind um and when we think of the word fortified we realize it's a uh something that is a protection to us it's something we can stand behind and that may be real simple but we're simple folk tonight if that's all right I think the scripture said except you can become like a child you can't even enter into the the kingdom of God so I'm going to try to stay real simple and if you don't mind you just pull as best as you can but I want to just take this from almost like a kid-like view for me I get excited to know that I'm unable but my God is able to protect me I I get excited to know that he's the one that's foreseeing every aspect of my life he knew the things that I was going to encounter he knew the difficulties he knew the UPS he knew the Downs he knew the high points he knew the valleys and he ordained it all and he had a purpose in all of it and sometimes we only like to be on a Mountaintop but sometimes what's in the valley is more needful for you than what's on the mountain top and that's just human nature we don't like difficulty we don't like pain we don't like discomfort but sometimes the only things that you the things you need the most are only found down in the deep dark Valley that you don't want to go and that's sometimes the place that God must lead you if you're more desirous to be conformed Into His Image than you are in the comfortableness of this life God's got a predestinated path into the valley of darkness just for you but the beauty of the whole thing is he's there my shepherd and my guide he's my Fortress he's my rock so I'm fortified I'm sheltered wherever he is it doesn't matter the circumstances around me it doesn't matter how dark it gets if he's there my rock I'm sheltered and I'm fortified and I'm protected and nothing can harm me in the midst of it all you believe that see I believe that I believe when when they would go to build a city they first started off by building a wall and that wall was a fortress it was a protection it was a defense right and that defense was the first thing you put up before you put a lot of time and energy and and money into the things that's within the city the first thing you make sure you got is a fort a fortified wall of Defense around you right when you have a home you buy a new home what's the first thing you do you change the locks you want your possessions and the things that are most valuable to you protected so you make sure the lock are changed and when God was going to protect us he gave us the only thing we had need for protection he gave us his word himself he gave me him his word and it wasn't depending it only it didn't only work if I understood it all or I could mentally figure it all out he didn't say did you understand he said Do you believe it do you believe it has always been the question and I I came to this thought as a result of a conversation I had the other night at the Saturday night meeting there was a man for those of you got up and he testified he wanted to thank God for keeping him away from drugs for one year wow and the people were happy and he said I just want to thank God for keeping me and protecting me from these drugs I said well praise God and he came up to me after the service and what was funny about it was he came up to me he said I want to apologize I said what happened he said it was such a good service but I fell asleep and I saw him I did see him in the back I saw him sleeping you know the first thing you think brother G he's like how can you sleep I'm going to raise my voice I'm going to talk louder but he came up to he was real sincere real he said he said sir I really enjoyed that message he said I'm so sorry I fell asleep I said well that's okay he said I'm on a medicine he said I have some mental problems and he said I'm on a powerful medicine and he said in the evening time I can't stay awake he said I didn't mean to fall asleep I really really didn't an instant you know your heart's like oh I I understand you know I'm afraid I'm sorry I even thought about raising my voice when I saw you say he was so thankful and he wanted to apologize cuz it he he he he thought I might have he might have offended me sleeping on the back real and I said that's okay buddy I said that's quite all right I said I was so encouraged by your testimony the grace of God holding you keeping you from those things he said yes he said and I'm believing one day he'll deliver me from these medicines from my mind I said I do too I said hey do you know the scripture he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement our peace upon him and with his stripes you're healed he said yes sir I know that scripture I said okay you stand on that scripture and every time your mind starts giving you crazy thoughts and you start going a little bit nerve-racked I said you just keep standing on that word and I knew he needed more than a hope he was hoping for but he needed something a rock he needed something he could stand on when those storms get to come towards him you know it's not brother banam said that man's Faith must be grounded in the Bedrock of God's word not the shifting Sands of man's ideas we have a Bedrock we have a solid rock Foundation our faith must anchor in the Simplicity of his word that's where I'm fortified and that's where that young man was fortified and I began to think about it he said will you pray for me I said I absolutely will I said I'll be thinking about you and you be thinking about him and as I began to think I says I'll be praying for you constantly he said I believe that God will deliver me one of these days from this I said I do too and that's where I got to thinking about something cuz the Bible talks about wherever two or three Witnesses are gathered he's in the presence and if one or two can agree on touching anything I'll do it and I began to think it's so interesting God likes to see us come together and stand together believing the same thing there's some type of power there's some type of uh I um strength that comes in a unified agreement on God's word like when we stand together you you ever notice like a husband and wife when they stand together and there's a Harmony in the home everything settles the kids settle down but when there's a tension and there's something not quite right then the kids start to acen up and something's wrong because there's no Harmony it's like that in a workplace if two people are working together it needs a Harmony and it's like that in a church it takes a Harmony and a Unity you know and brother bham talked about the great composer the great composer like Beethoven he writes a beautiful piece he said but thou the conductor must get into the Same Spirit of the one who wrote the word you see and that's where I loved brother b or brother Chad's sermon the matters of the heart he was talking about being in the right Spirit of the letter and that was my inspiration it's one thing to have the letter but I must know the author and his nature in order to do or play it the way he wants it played and so all these I began to realize oh my goodness he's knit us together for a purpose so no wonder the devil likes to shoot us likes to cause disagreements likes to cause issues difficulties painful uh rubbings and stuff like that it's a good thing for us we need to go through it but oh my goodness it's also something that stops you in your tracks God wanted a a a Unity if there's something about it and I I want you to turn in your Bibles to Genesis 11:3 there's something about this I hope this is okay I told you I just go as I feel led I don't overthink things too much but I want to talk about this fortified in one heart and in one mind and there's this portion of scripture back in Genesis when they're building the Tower of Babel that I always been amazed with and I think almost anybody reads the Bible you're kind of like this is amazing this is an amazing scripture here he says and they said one to another to to to uh go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime that they had they for Mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the earth and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do these are carnal men these are worldly men these are not Christians these are not sons of God these are worldly carnal men that have got into one mind and in one Accord and now nothing would be refused to them now if God would say that about a carnal in doing what they wanted to do what about a people of God that have been called out and ordained to stand in this final hour with the promises of his word what can be withheld from them what can be withheld from them nothing they have one heart one mind and it's his mind it's his will and if there's that Harmony what can stand before you if God be before me who can be against me there's such a Harmony and a unity and there's something that God cannot refuse it's like he can't refuse this he's saying this about them I can't they will accomplish this I've got to confuse their language it's an amazing thing and Philippians you know likeminded having same love being of one Accord and of one mind am let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lowliness of Mind esteem each other better than themselves you see there's like brother Ben was saying there's no big ones amongst us they're not better than anybody else we're not brighter than anybody else we condescend like nobody else the Bride of Jesus Christ should be able to make herself lowly like nobody else that's ever walked the Earth not to say look at me and look at this and I know this and I know this and you don't know this and you should do this no they actually constantly lift you up constantly push you up make you feel like the bigger person wasn't that the testimony of brother banam he made you feel like the bigger person yes yes yeah he made you feel like you are something and he's nothing that's a real that's that's somebody that's got something doesn't look down upon you you should be able to be where I'm at no he pushes you up makes you realize that you're something special too in the eyes of God as little as you may be makes you feel good and I think that's the attitude we must have amongst each other I think that's a unity and a common love and a common mind that we are to have have one amongst the other don't you and i' just been looking at and I see that's exactly what the prophet of God said was going to happen there would be such a love a Unity a one mindness amongst the people he says it he says um he says so exactly the way it was in the beginning it is today he was the word to the human race in the beginning God never gave the human race a church to stand behind never gave them a Creed to stand behind but you see he for fortified a human behind his word to just believe his word and to live by it that's what we're fortified behind not my human intellects or my human reasoning or what I can figure out I'm just believing his word I'm just believing his word and I'm believing that the same Harmony that the son had with the father I'm going to have with him pergam and church age notice the harmony of the father and of the son Jesus never did anything until he first showed him was showed him by the the Father John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life and she receives it and she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her what is she fortified behind his word nothing can harm her not even death for if a seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise no one I love that as I've been looking back to Ecclesiastes there's a time to speak there's a time to be silent there's a time to build there's a time to plant there's a time to build up there's a time to tear down you know what I realize usually when you want to speak it's time to be quiet and when you want to be quiet it's time to speak and when you want to sew something up it's time to Rend it to part there's just a time he makes everything beautiful in his time his time not yours we're on his time schedule mine that's what I'm trying I'm trying to get in tune with the composer I want to walk in tune I said what okay he wants me to go this okay go now stop okay stop I won't go nowhere now I want you to go over here I want you to say this okay I'm going to say that and okay stop don't say no more oh okay I think he wants headship I think he wants leadership I think he wants you so yielded in your own natural life that the things you would do you can't do because he won't allow you to do them yes you remember how Paul Paul was restricted he was restrained by the Holy Ghost in preaching the gospel he said no you can't go over there I don't want you to go over there I want you to go over here okay I follow the leadership of the Lord that's what I love we're just sheep we're just sheep we get to stay simple we get to stay humble you know brother bandam said my Ministry types that at John the Baptist exactly where John the Baptist stood and he said behold the lamb brother bam said his ministry types is exactly I believe he'll be saying behold there she is amen the Lamb's wife she just follows his leading wherever he says go she goes whenever he says speak she speaks whenever he says sit down be quiet you sit down and be quiet just learning to follow his lead but you know how how much comfort I can have in that that I don't have to figure out my own life I don't have to figure out the difficulties I don't have to try to reason with my own human ability how to solve problems you know how much rest we can have as a believer in Christ it's so simple and so humle is this okay okay okay I I like a little bit talking back you know me I just like a little bit of something you know if I'm sitting at the table and you're just staring at me all long I just don't want to say nothing you got give me something but you know that's just the way it is God wants us this way he wants us to just be relying upon him not trying to shift for ourselves not trying to figure everything everything out what' my word say he says what' my word say he said uh I'll never leave you no forsake okay that's it just keep walking I said I'll never leave you forsake you just start walking and we can rest in those things and so in Matthew 18:18 I have a lot of scriptures so feel free to turn I wanted to just go through some of this I'll try to slow down a little bit I've been told sometimes to speak too fast it's because I'm a nervous individual I'm sorry I'll slow down for a moment praise God Matthew 1818 it says verily I say unto you whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered GED together in my name there I am in the midst of them we we recognize that and we believe that wherever two or three are gathered we've said it so many times there I am in the midst of them but then to say now if you two will agree as touching anything I'll do that too what kind of confidence does God have in two Believers if they unite according to the promise of his word ask whatever you want I'll do it it's an amazing thing the kind of uh what God is offering over to the true believer in Christ Jesus I believe he's going to have so much confidence in us he knows we won't ask for the wrong things I believe we're he's going to be able to say it's okay he won't say the wrong thing I'll give him the power to bind anything or loose anything he'll say the right thing like sister hadie right she said the right thing the right woman simple woman just said the right thing at the right time in the presence of the right one and the third pole was manifested but he knew she'd ask for the right thing so I believe there's a confidence and we got to learn obedience through much suffering but it's coming to a place that God will have enough confidence to say whatever you say I'll do it amen I love that about him Amen in a thinking man's filter he says as it was as the days grow closer and closer and there is a narrowing of the path we want to go we want we want to go closer together may we must may we must be just one one in body may we all move together forgetting one another's sins or our differences just sticking closer and closer and closer as we see the day approaching assembling ourselves together all in one Accord and in one heart and if a brother or sister gets out of the way in any way don't do nothing butay pray for that person and in love always considering one another don't never let one of you get away you stay together if you can and add more to it constantly all the time am just get closer closer closer don't let nothing get amongst us don't let nothing break our fellowship don't let nothing break the harmony a love that we have and and we're United by a common love a love that God has shed Upon Our Hearts and the love the mutual love that we have for him it's binds us together you know the little story you know the husband and a wife they were fussing they were fighting this one couldn't get along with this one and they're going to have to separate and they're separating all the goods brother brandham said until they were fighting through stuff in the in the a chest or a closet or something like that until they climb across a little shoe that little shoe now these two that were at Great differences then found something they had in common and it was a mutual love that they had for one little baby and then they both realize they both have a part in this this is for both of them they both had something in that little baby how could one say I have it and you don't have it and at times I think you have to realize there is a common thing that we have in common we may have a lot of differences at time you know I like chocolate cake and brother gab probably like Cherry huh we like a lot of different things we like dessert if anybody wants to make this dessert 2400 loots Road send it my way or brother gab's way he can give you his address anytime he'll be happy to offer it to you but the reality of is sometimes we have differences we see things differently uh we are different in our natures and at times we can rub each other a little bit wrong but we have something in common and that something in common should be way greater than the little differences we have there's nothing more difficult or nothing more straining when you see two people that have a little bit too much of a differences and they don't have enough of a common mutual love one for the other all they can see is their differences and then there's no Harmony have it in a home home's a wreck have it in a business business is a wreck have it in a church church is a wreck there's something about maintaining a Harmony because you're holding up a common thing that you have that's of such great importance to you and that's the love of Christ and that's a love that you should have one it means too much it means too much so we should just be drawing closer and closer together first Peter if you won't if you don't mind turn there a lot of scriptures so First Peter chapter 3:8 it says finally be all of One mind having compassion one of the other love as Brethren be pitiful and be courteous that's a tall standing for us Christians sometimes you know pitiful have pity amen have pity be full of pity for somebody else you don't know what they're going through you don't know why they're going through it you don't know what's going on in their mind or the situation that's all about them maybe they act a little cross at you you don't know what they're going be pitiful have much pity it says and be courteous you know that means be kind wow the or Peter is here commending the church he's saying hey guys be kind it's sad that he has to say that but it's true am sometimes we get just a little bit too religious yes oh I can't say hi to him brother just be kind be sweet be pitiful have much pity amen be sweet one of the worst things is see some of that can't even be kind just can't even say hello God bless you how you doing you doing good great show pity show kindness don't talk about it show it amen you know it comes a certain point in time we got to be a living epistle being read of all men not heard yeah I heard what you were saying can I see some of it for a little bit you know let me see it in Action a little bit let me see a pitiful person person that is full of kindness generosity love and concern one for the other person amen pretty deep huh be kind be kind it says not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but counterwise blessing someone treats you wrong talks bad about you hits you in a weak spot there points out where you're just not lining up you be sweet you be kind you be gentle don't let nothing break that Harmony and that common love that we have for the same one don't do it prise God knowing that ye are there unto called that ye should inherit a blessing for he that will love and seek good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that he speak no Gile watch what you say be careful amen don't say anything wrong don't say anything evil or contrary to the will and purpose of God I was thinking about those unlikely individuals you know and I had when I preached that there Saturday night I took the woman at the well and I thought you know if any of us were we going to set this stage for the Messiah to be announced in the city of samarra we would have probably found the most the best Christian I mean the the best believer there the most virgin woman like she never said a cross word and she would lived a good holy life cuz she would be the right kind of person to declare to the city of samarra the Messiah is here but when God In His Infinite mind he says no I have a perfect witness someone that will receive my grace and my word it's this immoral woman who's lived a horrible life she's just the right one to be a true and living witness that I am here and what better individual than your life and my life that's marred and we are prostitutes in our in in one way and this exterior way we are filthy rotten human beings like why would God ever use us to declare to this world he is alive and we being a true witness of the Resurrection not that was but a resurrection that is like we preach a resurrection that's right now you were once dead in sin and trespassed but now resurrected to two new life in Christ Jesus like he chose unlikely people so God wasn't looking at the outside and the immorality and you know even his disciples like I can't believe he's even talking to her don't you know the kind of life she lives I just ignore no Jesus said no that's the right one I know what's going on in her heart am when he began to have a conversation with you heard what was in her heart well some say we worship here and one say say where shall we worship ah what's going on there's a seed Gene of God on the inside drops her water pot and says surely this is the Messiah and she ran back to the city and the whole city came out to hear an immoral woman's testimony praise God Amen man now if God has no problem using an immoral woman to go spread the gospel and to be a true witness of a living God what do we ought to do with each other everyone each and every one of us we should highly esteem and treat sweet and kind and gentle because you know where God is in that person I was thinking that greater than Solomon is here and the Queen of Sheba that came from afar to see the order and the harmony amongst the kingdom and the people she was in all of the mutual love and respect and this one stayed in his place and this one was in his place and the baker did this and the cup Bearer did this and the King was here and it was such a Harmony in the city because they all recognize the gift of God that was in their midst God was in Flesh on earth now where's God in Flesh on Earth do you realize the amount of honor and respect we must give to each other we must you say that you love God whom you cannot see and you cannot love your brother whom you can see you need a revelation of the unveiling of God and where he is today he's here yes amen but just like it was thousands of years ago there's no beauty that we should be holding stricken smitten of God and cast down no Beauty we see all the flaws yeah we see the flaws but sometimes fail to see the Masterpiece Romans 121 Romans 121 it says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your body is a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and that you be not conformed to this world but that you be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good acceptable and the perfect will of God for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath thought to every free man a Measure of Faith think of someone else better than you keep in mind the Masterpiece beside you amen keep in mind that that's the one that God's veiled in lots of scars lots of cuts lots of bruises but that makes it the Masterpiece you know it's one thing to hear a masterpiece of 2,000 years ago but sometimes we fail to recognize the Masterpiece today amen that you can't you got to recognize the Mighty God that's unveiled amongst us the mystery of his coming just changing his mask the great condescension of God came from a thought to a word to a life yes amen now those living Epistles are being made manifested all around us and oh how we ought to treat them how we ought to honor and respect each and every one of usen if God chose you to unveil himself and God put a little itty bit of himself there then what ought you to do with that person amen that's God Amen big statement big statement but true unlikely but true Oneness brother brandham says now then came Pentecost God made them one again oh my then they had Oneness with God God was with them now acts if you're putting it down acts 4:32 the Bible said they were of one heart see and one soul and one mind oh brother my they had been restored back to their origin again and the only thing that was left to be disposed of was was the old body uh called the city or the temple where they lived it had to rot because it has to rot and corrupt but in spirit and in life and in purpose and in vision and in everything they were one with God one purpose one heart one mission one objective one with God we are one with another see that only thing they had they didn't have right was this old flesh that body that had to rot away and die so they could get a new body one of these days but in all other aspects exactly the same amen one purpose one objective One Vision that's it amen but a body that's rotting away and I'm glad that it's rotting away Isaiah 26 3 and 4 thou wil keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee trust thee in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength sometimes it's just hard to keep your mind stayed on that right Revelation yes because we can see so much amongst us it's sometimes hard for you to even see that you could be the very Dwelling Place of God I hope I'm not the only one at times all I can see is where I fail and I myself struggle with it not that I struggle with the message not that I struggle with the revealed word but I struggle with this revealed word I have a hard time seeing that this is the place of his dwelling that this is his Masterpiece I have a hard time seeing it but it's still the truth regardless I I tell you he said you can't god with your five senses it doesn't matter what I see it doesn't matter what I hear myself say sometimes it doesn't matter how I feel what matters is there's something down on the inside that says I'm a part of this nobody can take it away from me I was there it's for me I was a part of him then I'm a part of him now I just come down through time I'm a manifested attribute of his grace and this hour displaying the true and living God with all of my faults and all of my failures and you you all your faults and failures still a Dwelling Place of the most high God hard for me to see it sometimes easier for me to see it in you than than for me to see it in me just being honest it's hard but I still believe it amen though I just have a hard time mentally grasping it sometimes I'm just so glad like I was thinking about the other day is like you know you think about it with with Noah there was Noah on that day and everyone around him was saying Noah you have lost your mind you are crazy like you keep saying that you heard from God and you're his voice piece for the day and you keep saying it's going to rain and we have all these scientific instruments around us proving that you're a liar like you realize the advancement of science s and Technology was there to prove that God's word could not be held or kept like everything Advanced to a place to disprove God what do you think's going on today where is science and technology and the devices of man's imaginations that we have strapped to our hips or trying to do it's trying to deny the revelation of Christ in you if you haven't realized it there's a lot of scientific instruments and advancements and Tech technology with one purpose one objective what's the devil's objective to disprove God's word that's his whole objective you think science and technology is advancing so you can have an easier life no one objective disprove God's word and try to convince you you are not who you think you are so you better be careful you better gird up the loins of your mind you know gird it up like uh you know um uh you tie it up tight right so like if you I think in the old Orient you know when they would say gir up your the loins of your mind like they like gird up their jacket they got to go for a run you know we can't let this trip us up so he's saying G up the loins your mind don't let anything loose hanging around be careful what you're listening to careful what you're you're you're consuming cuz it's all there with one objective to discredit God's word and get you to disbelieve it all of this science technology and advancements but no just believed it Noah just believed that word Noah just believed that this word was the truth and he put his life to it yes amen everything he had he gave to it he testified that he believed what he believed in the life that he lived every single day am not just what he preached but he went to work cutting down the trees putting it all together boiling the sap every day for 120 years he was testifying that he believed what he said and think about it it's not always that we have a quote it's not always that we can repeat a Bible verse what are you doing every day every moment of every day are you telling the world that you believe you're you're leaving soon do you believe you're going out of here sometime that this world is not your home you're just passing through are you giving giving your life to pursue all that it can offer you like Noah testified he believed the message by just getting up and cutting down trees I love that I love the Simplicity of that he just got up and did exactly what God called him to do build the ark amen and then I love it cuz God was in the ark amen he never said Noah go in the ark he said Noah come in the ark if I say come into this building where am I yeah I'm in the building because that was the word made manifested God had provided a way of escape and Noah testified of it and so I've got to Pivot here for a moment Jehovah 1959 Jehovah of Miracles if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on God and all the things of this world go about your business go to church go do your washing and dishes wherever you are you keep him on your mind all day and all night then God will do something you see you're drawing close to him if you got the world shut out just you and he are together amen oh so simple so simple but do we do it we get distracted I get distracted but I've got a promise in his word that if I'll keep my mind stayed on thee he'll keep me in perfect peace peace and the prophet of God said you want him to draw close to you just keep thinking about him just keep talking about how wonderful he is how sweet he is you ever have that Fellowship we get together sometimes with Brothers you know and sometimes it can go into a conversation where we're maybe uh discussing a doctrinal thing you get argument well you don't feel real sweet when you get to talking about how good he is how good he's been to you you start testifying to another or a sister to a sister how wonderful how precious he is to you you ever noticed sweet atmosphere that begins to get created I've known it I've felt it something begins to happen all around you when you start to talk about how wonderful and how precious he really is he starts drawing close to you now that's simple but let's do it let's keep him on our minds let's not the let the devices and the imaginations of man and all that he can provide through technology take away your mind and grieve the holy spirit away from you let's keep it real simple just keep him on your mind singing praises to God live simple humble Christian lives with him on your mind watch what God will do in a curtain of time 1955 Christians will talk about everything but Christ in these days they go out and they're always in a bunch of nonsense and everything they want to talk about but never but never are they talking about Christ talk about him sing about him love him keep him on your mind and keep him on your heart and your mind all day and all night David said I bind thy laws upon the fingers on his fingers and upon his bed post and so he would before uh he kept him before him all the time that's the way keep him in your memory keep him in your thoughts and in your praises and in your speech all that you do is keep Christ before you and that's the way that he will draw near to you amen I love that and so I was looking at this Genesis and we'll look at it Genesis 6:5 I am only halfway through my notes so we have a problem um I have to find where to cut some of this um Genesis 6 and5 it says God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart I don't want to grieve the Lord in his heart I don't want my own imaginations in my thoughts uh you know when when you look at it it wasn't that they were thinking bad thoughts cuz I looked this up imaginations it's form framing or purpose their mind was on their purpose you know you can let your job become an evil thing you can you can let your family become an evil thing because your whole purpose is just I got to take care of the kids I got to do this and what about God like what about your serving him what you're giving your whole life to your purpose of work you're giving your whole life to pursuing some goal you're giving your whole life to pursue something that you want but is it what he wants you're imag ination is evil if it's not his will it's evil it doesn't have to be immoral or Cross or it just has to be contrary to his will for your life you are evil amen that's all it takes amen your purpose isn't to do his purpose if your purpose is to do your purpose it's evil yes and that's the kind of imaginations men had on their minds that grieve God to his own heart their purpose their imaginations their intellectual framework was about their own will their thoughts the imagination their thoughts I thought was interesting another word for thought is a device or an invention and we have many of them we have many devices and inventions that man has put together to help them through this Earthly Journey but I promise you it doesn't help you in your spiritual one anything a man tries to produce uh is some benefit and a lot of curse a lot of bad maybe a little good and mostly bad uh and it's but you see the people's minds were all about those things yeah right that's where their minds were focused on all these things what the world could offer Next the Great Inventions of technology and science and achievement and that's not how we are predisposed as Christians that's not what we're about in Satan's Eden 1965 he said now he said he would exalt himself above the most high he would Ascend Above the Clouds of the stars and he would sit there like God and be above the most high and he has suce he has succeeded in carrying out his threats he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of God's Pro promised word to that age that's exactly how he's done it in every age he explained it away he makes something else more attractive something else look like it's more important to you than the promise of God's revealed word to you there is nothing of more importance to us as Believers than this word amen there must be nothing in this life that we esteem of higher value in our lives than God's revealed word for this day you cannot take it lightly and we cannot let it become common to us if you do you will become evil in your own imaginations and soon drift away from your own purpose that God brought you to this earth amen it must stay of extreme high value to us I know we hear that all the time but it's true sometimes we get so used to it it becomes common to us and then we can't remember the last time we listened to a sermon of brother Brandon we can't remember the last time we picked up a message book prayerfully with a heart's desire to hear from God not to do your religious Duty for the day and check it off I did it God don't care about that I'm going to tell you something right now don't do that Bible says with man's lips they praise me but their hearts are far from me don't do it to check it off a list it would be better for you to not do it than to say I did my religious Duty for the day I got it out of the way so I can do my will instead of God's will you know we're getting down to the heart of the matter in many ways our hearts objectives attitudes why we do what we do is coming into view each and every day and God knows if this means everything to you or if it's just a style of your life a lifestyle he knows you're not fooling nobody it means either everything to you or nothing to you that's the kind of value God wants us to place upon on this revealed word it's everything to us in these in the days of Noah he explained that it was impossible for it to rain for rain to for it to rain from Heaven There is no rain up there you see his great scientific gospel that he had preached in the Garden of Eden you see he could shoot with instruments to the moon and prove that there was no moisture up there but God said there would come a rain but Satan succeeded and poisoned the mind of the People by his scientific research that it could not be but it was but it was done God said it would be done and he did it those through scientific uh Technologies and reasoning it's poisoning the minds of the people in disbelieving God's word why do you think you have to be careful about sending your boys and your kids off to a college what do you think is going on there there's higher education and a learning and a teaching from professors that's causing kids to disbelieve the word of God it's poisoning their minds to not believe the word and now look at the science and advancement of science like we can look at it and see where this is headed total Destruction is what it's headed for it's poisoning the minds of people to disbelieve God's word absolutely go to hear a professor in some colle you better prayerfully pray before you let your kids go to to a college or a university you better know it's the will of God cuz you're going to expose them to some poison and if they're not ready it's bad like you just can't willy-nilly run through this life amen recognize the devil and his tactics it's just an amazing thing I better slow down I'm catching my breath God but we're sheep never supposed to rely on our human intellects we're just sheep I was going to call this sheep and Shepherds we're just sheep I'm so thankful I'm just a sheep I'm just a I'm just one that needs lead I'm one that needs lead every day I can't lead myself I need land god hiding himself in simplicity so it pleased God to reveal himself and hiding himself then hide himself and reveal himself in simple little things it goes right over the head of a man because if you'd say why would God do that it's because man was made up in the beginning not to shift for himself a man was made to completely rely upon God that's the reason we're likened unto Lambs or sheep because a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the Holy Spirit is supposed to lead lead us you believe that I'm not leading myself through human intellects in many cases there's been a problem I say this respect you have to okay when brother brandham said take me for what I mean not what I say often times you know what we do we don't pray about something we search it out sometimes sometimes we use the prophet sometimes we use Google but one thing you don't really do anymore is pray about it and find the will of God for your life sometimes you're handicapped by the technology devices that we've been given well I did a quick search and you know that's I that's what he said in 14 different places and it was three of those places were 1963 that's closer in line with what I want to do anyhow and so that's what I'm going to do but God may tell you no you're not allowed to but you don't pray about it you don't seek God's face or the leadership of the Holy Ghost you're a sheep you better go back to oldfashioned gospel praying getting on your knees and wearing out a pair of pants sometimes like we didn't advance so much that now we have a message church that we don't have to pray you ain't so intellectually great that you can't you can't have to that God isn't going to put you on your knees in desperation crying out to God for his leadership sometimes he will not give you an answer you can't find the answer in the message you can't find it you don't know what to do amen what else you going to do amen you got to go pray right you got to get serious before God seek his face what do I do I don't know but that's his promise I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you you draw nigh to me I'll draw nigh to you he wanted Fellowship I think that's a great thing sometimes when you let you get to a Crossroads where you don't know where to go it forces you to find him forces you to seek his face Satan's Eden 1965 the spirit of God is not something that is schooled into you it is something that is predestinated unto you by the mighty hand of God your experiences cannot be schooled or taught it is predestinated by that by God's hand and God's forn knowledge into you that's right that's what I love there was something I was predestinated unto I was predestinated there's some you know they're guiding cars today by radar or whatever technology and stuff like that I I heard I was talking to a farmer friend of mine he just hops in a combine he don't even have to steer it he pushes a button and it's Guided by radar he'll he'll uh plow a whole field he don't do anything but sit there and drink a Coke I mean play on his phone that's what he does and it and it does the whole bit of work it's Guided by something like we're living in a day and age where there's a higher technology or a higher intelligence that's now guiding combines and guiding cars and all of these things but if that's where science has progressed there's something else here to guide a true Son of God and that's the leadership of his spirit to guide me and show me what to do each and every day okay go this far turn right okay turn right okay go that far turn left okay go that I believe in that I still believe that that's how God leads his people and has done it in the past and that's how God will always do it never did cause me or have to rely upon my own human ability to shift for myself and figure things out I can rely upon God to speak to me reveal his word take me to the right message at the right time speak through a minister speak through a brother or a sister in the church have just the right word that spark something inside me and said that's the Lord sometimes God won't speak through the ministry he'll speak through one of youly God failed God likes to do it that way make you recognize where he's at am cause you to start to respect it honor it love it treat it sweet when they lusted for knowledge and you wanted your PhD and lld it was sin to do so that's a strong statement but it's the truth no matter how strong it is it's the truth you see to lust for knowledge and understanding the thing of it is today we don't try to establish the word of God in the people's hearts we're trying to establish ourselves churches are are trying to establish a doctrine of a church in a person's Hearts but we are commanded to establish the word of God Paul said I don't come to you with enticing words of a man that your faith would rest in the knowledge of a man but I come to you in power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost that your faith will rest in God amen amen that's what we preach a true and living God living amongst his people same yesterday today and forever whatever he was back then he is today what whatever he is today he will forever be and my purpose on this Earth is to see that word of God not only established here but to see it established in another person that's my objective and that's our purpose in coming the Corinthians says knowledge puffs up but charity edifieth and if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know I've always said ain't it good to be a bunch of miserable nobody nothings that know nothing other than God God keeps his promises God keeps his word yeah it's good to be that way keeps you simple keeps you humble keeps you trusting in Him turn your Bibles to Romans 12 we'll try to speed it up here to wrap it up here for a moment I just cut a few pages out Romans 12:14 and remember we're considering the mind of Christ the mind that is to be in us the attitude the mental objective that we have it says bless them that per which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind one toward another if you see a brother or sister that's hurting you would be hurting if you love them rejoice when someone does really well you don't think why' that happen for them man I'm way better than that person you know I mean wow they got that job they don't deserve that job no when something good happens we Rejoice we're happy for them we want the best for our brothers and our sisters and when they're in pain we're in pain we don't want to see them hurting we don't think they deserve that pain they shouldn't have done such and such and so and so no you hurt we bear one another's burdens we're one heart one mind one body we're just beating along together getting closer I hope all the time amen Rejoice with them that do Rejoice weep with them that weep be of the same mind one toward the other mind not high things but condescend to Men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits conceits don't think too highly of yourself everyone put the other one up a little higher than yourself and then you'll be acting like God that's exactly what God done he condescended to the lowest lows and he lifted you up let's do that for one another Psalm 62: 6 he said he is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved in God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all times ye people pour out your hearts before him for God is a refuge for us I'm fortified behind him I'm not fortified in my abilities I'm not fortified in what I can figure out I'm fortified because I'm just simple enough to hide behind The Rock amen just get back behind the Rock God stay right there don't let anything entice you away from the Simplicity that is found in Christ Jesus and simple humble faith in his promises they will never fail and that's why it so struck me that young man that came to me he just needed a place to stand and he needed someone to know I was going to pray with him too I don't think he had enough confidence in his own prayer prayers but for some reason when I said I'll be praying for you too he lit up wonderful and he said I'm I believe that you know sometimes we just have to stand with somebody else and help them as they stand upon the promises of God remind them we have a rock we have a place to stand we have a a rock in a weary land amen we're sheltered by that rock and just remind them and stand with them in prayer one heart one Accord one objective God will see you through amen sometimes we just be real simple about it musicians will you come praise God Amen I want to close with a little bit of a lengthy thing but I just love this quote 1965 0911 God's power to transform he said I got out there brother brandom and there was no bark on the trees there wasn't a spring of grass it was on Easter morning he said there was some old wrecked tanks out there and the officer uh had to get a record of them and see if there was anything that could be done for them near the great uh argon Forest said then when I was standing there by myself said I looked up and said oh God this is the way it's all coming to that's right it's all coming it was all burnt up there was no life at all the grass was burned up the trees the grass the all the trees were killed everything was dead Twisted hanging down where bullets and things had riddled it all if that isn't a picture of the world today where Satan is spraying his unbelief his hybridization His science and his knowledge until that it is be until it was at the beginning when God put Adam and Eve in the garden what a beautiful paradise without death and without sickness and without without sorrow and everything was in order look what Satan's DDT has done now she is chaos and there's nothing left he said I started to cry as I walked back I was attracted to a rock said I went over there and I looked at that rock and I pushed it over down beneath the rock was a little white flower growing the only thing left because it was sheltered by a rock amen God my rock My Shelter to us today oh God when these poisons are flying everywhere in the s name of Science and in education shelter us keep me until that day oh God is my prayer amen amen how many want to be sheltered by The Rock in this dark and dreary age it's advancing and heading towards destruction faster than anything I know with poisonous gases of unbelief all around us Lord just shelter me behind that rock will you stand I pray that that was okay it was just as I felt led to say it I can only do what I feel inspired to say and do and I I just believe that it was his leading and I hope that it was an encouragement to you and I hope that God spoke to each he speaks to all of our hearts just the things that he has need of let's just bow our heads heavenly father thank you for your word thank you for your promises that you'd never leave us nor forsake us father thank you Lord for coming our way thank you Lord for revealing to us the high calling that is Upon Our Lives May we not take it in for granted may we not take it lightly Lord thou H
