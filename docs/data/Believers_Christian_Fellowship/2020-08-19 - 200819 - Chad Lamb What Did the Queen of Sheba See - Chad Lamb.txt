you tonight so that that we don't lose track of those and also let you know that because they've got a lot of family coming in and they've got to maintain social distancing here and in the reception they weren't able to just do an open invitation they had to keep it by invitation only so i just pray you understand that and pray for them and the lord will bless them and their union together amen before we read too i'm going to i'm going to pray but i also have caught word over the last week or so of a couple different assemblies out there that have had covert 19 go through and some that were very very sick brother donny reagan's been sick for several days now with coven 19 and uh the last i heard is he's recovering at home uh brother david silas church i know got hit with a pretty bad case some people in icu uh so we just want to remember the bride around the world i also found out late last night that our brother jivaratnam marlapudi i hope you remember he was here last summer he's been here two years in a row he's a good friend of ours he stayed in our home for a little over a week and we really got to know him and enjoy the brother quite a bit and jiva ratnam is very very very sick right now as we speak the doctors actually told his family that only god can save him he's 100 dependent on oxygen his saturation saturation levels keep dropping but we've heard that story before and god is a healer and god can do it for one he can do it for another amen and since we've been through this before we want to exercise our faith because we've we've seen god bring from the lowest of the low all the way out amen if you did it for brother gene he can do it for brother marla putin you can do it for brother don he can do it for anybody so we just want to pray so let's pray together before we read dear lord jesus we thank you father for the goodness that you've extended to us for your mercy for your grace in our lives for your word lord that never fails god we just want to come to you and ask lord that you would bless our service this evening all that would be said let it be done for your glory and god for those that have needs lord throughout the world your bride lord is suffering like the rest of the world is suffering just like your children of israel suffered when the plagues broke out in goshen as well as in in egypt lord for the first few plagues my god your hand of mercy is extended your grace is sufficient your word has not failed you've healed so many and delivered us from such dire circumstances and we pray for our brothers and sisters we pray for our brother donny reagan lord that you'll heal him and bring him you know back to full strength lord and for those in his church and those in by the david silas church and many others that out there some we know about some we don't know about but we pray that you would show yourself mighty on behalf of your bride in order for our precious brother jivaratnam lord in india he's suffering so badly as wife sick and children sick i just pray you would raise them up for your glory lord that you would let this turn from a disaster to a tremendous testimony lord that you would get great glory and honor through that testimony bless us as we read your word tonight bless us lord as we feed on your word may you come yourself lord and break the bread of life to us that you might show us the way to walk in this day that we live in jesus christ's name we pray amen let's read from romans chapter 12 verse 1. romans chapter 12 and verse 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith so in this passage in verse 3 he's saying let's not be overly exalted let's not think ourselves special because if we believe we've been given a measure of faith by the lord that he's given to us so let's read that again for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith first we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another having them gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith or ministry let us wait on our ministry or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorted on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimulation abort that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another amen you can be seated turn from there to second chronicles with me we're going to keep on with the thought we've been on looking at solomon coming to his kingdom and the golden age sunday we talked about uh preparing for a golden age and what had to be done in preparation for a golden age and in in that i just want to do a just a quick review with you there was four individuals we talked about that came to judgment and we opened with the scripture that judgment must begin in the house of god and brother graham said that that that solomon brought israel into a golden age under solomon's rule amen and he was a foreshadow of jesus christ and that's why jesus would say you know there's a greater than solomon that's here and brother branham would pick up on that and he would bring it forward and say a greater than solomon is here and we know that a greater than solomon is still here and so when that great when that solomon came that was foreshadowing christ amen to bring them to a golden age first he has to deal with spirits that are embedded in the church amen spirits that are close to him spirits that are there that are working amen until these things are dealt with he can't move to the to the golden age first there has to be a purging and so that's a very important step in the process that we can miss so many times is this purging removing the spirits david did a fantastic job amen of purging israel of the outside enemies amen those that were not israelites those those false kingdoms that were all around that were being dispossessed of their land and david fought the philistines he liberated jerusalem amen from the jebusites and all of these wonderful victories that he had but but when he was dying because the father gives all judgment to the son when he was dying he told the son there are some things that are within i judge the things that are without but there are things that within that need to be dealt with and i'm calling on you to deal with that don't forget joab don't forget shimmy high don't forget these things and so we we we spoke about that but there were four judgments and four individuals that we spoke about the first was adonijah adonijah was an older brother to solomon he was next in line to absalom after absalom was killed and and his rebellion but adenija tried to get ahead of the program of god amen before he was told amen he tried to usurp himself he tried to put himself in position that god didn't put him in he tried because it logically it looked like it was his amen by reasoning it looked like it was his amen by all logic and reasoning it looked like he would be the successor so because of his reasoning because of his wisdom because of his intellect he decided to move ahead in god's program without god's commandment it's a dangerous position to be in that spirit has to be rooted out of the church because this church christ has to have preeminence in his church amen not the church deciding by our own reasoning and own wisdom it's time for this we'll just go ahead and do it it's time for this we'll just go ahead and do it like saying it's time for the manifestation of the third pull let's start speaking we're going to make a mockery of the things of god when we get ahead of god's program every time brother branham said that that he there was a manifestation of the third pool and speaking to squirrels speaking to a storm speaking to his wife's tumor speaking to had he writes boys all of these things that brother ben spoke about he says now see that was done by permission not by him deciding it was time and then moving ahead of god's program but waiting until the lord said speak and then he spoke so adonijah got ahead of god's program amen and he had to be judged and it would show that there was wickedness within him it wasn't that he made a simple mistake but he was actually wicked in his heart he wanted something that god hadn't given him because the king hadn't said this is your position so he went ahead and went through septility and tried to put himself in that position so adam nigel was self-appointing and it's amazing there's going to be four judgments adonijah abby athar the priest joab the the captain of the host and shemiyah of the house of saul all four of them are going to be judged but they're going to be four men that take their place four men or the family of the fourth man we'll talk about that in a minute this one i want to get to but adenija was self-appointed solomon was appointed by god see one thing i want to start moving into is i want to start getting into positional placing in the body of christ but in positional placing amen positional placing does not come by the will of the person being placed positional placing in the body comes solely by the will of god solomon didn't put himself anywhere solomon did nothing until the king told him that you're the successor amen and god put him in position because god had spoke it years before and even though it was prophesied and spoken years before solomon didn't move till david said it's you and it's time and so so that we see the difference between adonis and solomon amen all of this is moving is moving israel into the golden age these things have to be dealt with to move into the golden age not only do the spirits have to be judged amen all the right positions have to be filled by the god called men so to come to a golden age is not just purging it's purging and placing so to come to a golden age you have to have purging and placing abby athar the priest we find out went with adonijah and you wonder why did abathur the priest go with adrenaline abe ether was a priest he was a son of aaron but he was of the lineage of eli amen through the youngest son of aaron and the high priesthood was supposed to move through eleazar and so samuel had cursed eli and put a curse on his household and said that the priesthood will be removed from you and it continued on till we got to abathar but when christ comes to bring a golden age amen all prophecy will be fulfilled all wrongs will be righted and here a beathard proves what spirit is he's of because he goes with adonisia so he is cast out he the priesthood stripped from him zadok is put up in his place amen is the priest he's of the line of eliezer he's the appropriate priesthood of the appropriate line and he's put in the appropriate position zadok doesn't put himself anywhere solomon puts him there you see a theme god purges judges and places so much of this judging has to take place the judging that has to take place is on people who tried to take a position people who tried to make themselves something they want people who tried to grab something that wasn't given to them amen and they they brought damnation upon themselves so abr ather isaac is sent away sent to his own hometown he's stripped of the priesthood zadok is put in position joab who's the captain of the host who's a a relative a nephew of david uh he's fought many a battle with david and he's a religious man a.b author is a religious man adenizer is a religious man uh joab's a religious man we're not talking about heathen's friends we're talking about people who worship god people who are in the church i mean joab even protested when david wanted the number of the people because david numbering the people was contrary to the law of moses and he said don't do this don't do this to israel but but david pushed him anyways because god had ordained it so it wasn't ju that job didn't want to serve the lord didn't want to obey the lord didn't know the law and didn't keep the law but job had a problem joab took it upon himself to bring judgment upon abner and upon a mesa amen who david was not going to judge they were coming at a time of peace and reconciliation but that peace and reconciliation was a threat to joab's position as captain of the host and because it was a threat to his position amen he slew abner and he slew a mesa amen without the king's consent against the king's desire in a time of peace and reconciliation he destroyed and ruined destroyed their lives so that he could stay in a position of authority and he wasn't a heathen he wasn't a philistine he wasn't a gentile amen he was an israelite who worshipped god who loved the lord and loved the law but he loved himself more a b a thor loved the lord loved the law loved himself more adonijah no doubt was a worshiper of jehovah but he loved himself more then joab now is replaced by banaya banaya is actually a gentile warrior in in banaya he he's the one if you if you follow banaya through banaya does many acts of valor he's one of the mighty men of david but bania you never see banaya move outside the authority of david outside the command of david when david says go he goes if david doesn't say go he doesn't go he doesn't get caught up in the seduction in the subtility of adonijah when adam knight is going to usurp himself amen abe third gets caught up in it joab gets caught up in it amen many others get caught up amen but but banaya doesn't get caught up in it zadok doesn't get caught up in it nathan the prophet doesn't get caught up in it why because they're not going to fall by deception because the bride won't fall by deception amen praise be to god so joab is replaced with banaya a man who will only do what the king says do shimmy i is of the house of saul shimmy i lives peaceably with david he's a he is i guess he has undercover resentment now i'm talking in the church not outside the church in the church he has undercover resentment because the the kingdom was removed from saul's family and he's part of saul's family and was restricted from saul and it didn't matter how evil saul was or how righteous god was in stripping the kingdom away and giving it to david amen because it was taken from someone given to david amen that was god's righteous judgment that was god's uh god's duty god's obligation to the kingdom to set up the king but shemii resented david all along for it and david didn't do anything david just obeyed the command of god david didn't choose himself god chose him he didn't pour the oil on himself samuel under the direction of god poured the oil on david didn't do anything to put himself in this position god did it all amen but shimmy i was secretly resentful of his position why because his house lost out we're not talking outside the church we're talking in the church see a greater than solomon is here amen not to deal with the dominations he's already dealt with the nominations but now he's to bring us to a golden age friends and he's got to purge out all of self-love all of selfishness and all the self-will has got to be purged out of jerusalem amen praise be to god we we are you know we are not exempt because we say we're the bride we know the message we're in the message amen they were the bride they were in the message amen the solomon's reign under david was they were in the message of the hour they were message believers in the right dispensation amen but wrong spirits were trying to move in the church amen and when solomon come on the scene to bring him into a golden age he's got to deal with these wrong spirits and a greater than solomon is here to deal with the wrong spirits that try to work in our lives so shimmy i now curses david when when david is strong nothing said i mean he at least nothing said outwardly nothing said to david in his home he may be backbiting the king and but but out openly he's not saying anything until david is leaving jerusalem seemingly weak having lost his kingdom being defeated and cast out by a son and as he's moving along shimei is going on the ridge top cursing david with grievous curses and throwing stones and casting dust and dirt and david has so much of god he's a man after god's own heart amen that when when one of the mighty men that were with him said let me cut his head off and he says no the lord told him to do that the lord told him to curse david why because nothing happens outside of god allowing it to happen so when he curses david david goes out when he's going to mahanim when he's fleeing from absalom and when david comes back after the rebellion is cast down david is going to be reinstated as king shimaya falls at jordan falls at his feet and begs for mercy and apologizes and makes him swear that he won't kill him and david says i won't kill you and that's the promise but when solomon's coming on the scene see shimei didn't change shemii cursed david for love of himself and shemio repented to david for love of himself he was never humbled he was never changed amen he still loved himself more than he loved the plan of god because if the plan of god let's just say it this way if the plan of god takes you out of position and sits you down and puts another man in position amen you should say praise be to god that's the plan of god amen if that's what god wants that's what i want but if the plan of god amen moves one position to another position amen and that irritates you and makes you jealous and envious amen you need to get to the altar amen before god and say god i'm sorry i'm sorry that i can't humble myself i'm sorry that i can't amen rejoice in what you're doing praise be to god we're going to find out as we move along amen when we can get away from self we can start to see the golden age move in and so when when david tells solomon don't forget joab don't forget shimmy i he also mentions another name he says don't forget braziliani don't forget braziliani he did good to me and he said take his sons and let his sons eat at your table feed them and sustain them and say what did brazilia do let's turn to second samuel we'll come back the chronicles let's go to second samuel verse 9 or chapter 19. second samuel 19 31 in brazil ai the gileadite came down from regulum and went over jordan with the king to conduct him over jordan now brazilian was a very aged man even four score years old and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim for he was a very great man so now well shemii when the king was going to moanain shemyi was cursing him at the same time this man gilead and i he was coming and bringing substance to sustain the king he was bringing food and provisions to the king and monad in his exile in his weakness amen when he was down at his lowest there was somebody who would stand with him and support him shimmy i took advantage of the situation to finally express what was really in his heart resentment and self-love amen and he cursed him with a great curse he was cursing god's anointed but brazilian had enough god in him to say though he's cast down though he's run out of jerusalem though he's low he's still god's anointed and i'm going to support him i'm going to bring substance to him so he brought substance to him and he says verse 33 and the king said to brasilia i come now over with me and i will feed thee with me in jerusalem now he's been in monday he's been in exile now the rebellion's cast down now he's coming across jordan to be reinstated as king brazilian i had brought him substance he said now come with me amen and i'll feed you at my table amen to sit at the king table means you'll never work another day in your life means you'll never want for anything ever again means you're honored and respected and you're put in a position of care amen and support for the rest of your life and braziliani said unto the king how long have i to live that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem i am this day four score years old and can i discern between good and evil can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink can i hear any more the voice of singing men or singing women wherefore then then should the ser thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king thy servant will go a little way over jordan with the king and why should the king recompense me with such a reward let thy servant i pray they turn back again and i may die in my own city and be buried by the grave of my father and my mother but behold thy servant cheham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what shall seem good unto thee so now we find out braziliani he he comes at a time david's in weakness when shemia is taking advantage he's bringing substance to the king but his true motive is expressed when the king comes back in the power amen braziliani did not help the king so that when the king comes in the power he'll get benefit because when the benefit comes he turns it down proving his motive was pure all the way through he didn't want nothing back all he wanted to do was serve god's program all he wanted to do was support god's plan could support support god's man he wasn't looking for a kickback he wasn't looking for an attaboy he wasn't looking for anything because when the golden opportunity comes he said hey i can't even taste the food i can't even hear the singing and dancing i would just be a burden to the king don't do it for me but do it for this other man my goodness do you understand what character we're looking at in brasilia amen the character that god wants to have in his children today preferring one over thyself just take him do to him lord amen i i'm not worthy i don't waste all your effort on me do it for my brother over here so his his conduct and his response to the king proves what his motive was amen so when judgment comes judgment when judgment comes in preparation for the golden age judgment doesn't always come on the wicked judgment also comes on the righteous and now he tells uh uh and first kings chapter two when he gives instruction to solomon he says solomon judge joab judge shemii he says and take brazilia and bring his sons and feed them at your table all your days what happened because of the true motive of the father the children are put into a position that they could have never got to themselves [Music] because god keeps good records friends don't we don't do things to get something from god we our motive has to be pure our intention has to be pure amen when jesus was here he was telling you don't pray like the pharisees do stand on the corner and say loud prayers and blow a trumpet before they cast their arms in he said they've already got their reward they won't get anything else because what did they want they didn't want to serve god they wanted the people to see them serve god they didn't want god's respect they wanted the people's respect so they got the reward people respected them they thought they were amazing that's the only reward they would get but the little widow woman amen who had almost nothing to give didn't blow a trumpet didn't announce it she was probably ashamed at the amount that she was putting in so she was probably trying to slip in drop it and slip out but jesus noticed exactly what she did friends god keeps good records she didn't do it to get anything she did it because she had a pure heart that loved god i said god give me a pure heart that will serve you just because i love you not for benefits not for kickbacks amen not for blessings not for healings amen not for not for material gains amen just because i love you we don't have to try to get anything manipulate a situation do something to get something god keeps good records he knows whose are his amen the never seen the righteous forsaken or the god seed begging for bread we need to serve god out of a pure heart so braziliani his sons now by this time i'm sure he has passed away he was already 80 years old so his the this honor is bestowed upon his sons that now they're placed in a position because of the character of their father so adenisia self-appointed was replaced by a god called man solomon abi athar who tried to seize the high priesthood and hold on to it by aligning with adani he lost it all and zodak was put in his place zadok joab who tried to hold his position as captain of the host amen by destroying and we talked about sunday and brother man said there's more than one way to murder a man amen today what we have in the in the church today may not be physical murder amen but there's murder going on all the time because if you do something to destroy somebody's influence brother ben said it's the same as taking a knife and murdering him and so joab would murder the influence of abner and the influence of a mesa amen so that he could stay in position right and his position was gone and bania a man who would obey the king's order was put in place shimayi was destroyed because he loved himself more than he loved the word of god but the sons of brazilia were put into a place they could have never attained on their own see god keeps good records friends you don't have to try to get anything you don't have to try to do anything you don't try to put yourself in any position god does it just love the lord serve him with all of your hearts now let's go to second chronicles and i'll give you the title of tonight's sermon which i forget to do sometimes but there's a reason i didn't give it to you because some of you would already be where i'm trying to go right now so praise god that's the danger of ministering to people who know the message really really good and know their bibles as soon as you say something they're like tick tick tick i've already got to the punch line so i like to hold a few pieces back all right second chronicles chapter nine and what i want to discuss now after doing this review is what did the queen of sheba see the queen of she became there was something she saw and after she saw it she had no more heart in her what did the queen of sheba see all right somebody's already there see i told you let's read verse 1 and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she came to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem with a very great company and camels that bear spices and gold and abundance and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart and solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing hid from solomon which he told her not and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and the house that he had built and the meat of the table and the sitting of his servants and the attendants of his ministers and their apparel his cupbearers also in their apparel and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her and she said to the king it was a true report which i heard in my own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom how be how be it i believed not their words until i came in mine eyes had seen it and behold the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told in me for thou exceedeth the fame that i heard happy are thy men and happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom blessed be the lord thy god which delighteth in thee to set thee on his throne to be king for the lord thy god because thy god loved israel to establish them forever therefore made he the king over them to do judgment and justice and she gave she gave the king 120 talents of gold and precious and spices great in abundance and precious stones neither was there any such spices as the queen of sheba gave king solomon so now we see that she came and then she had heard of his fame from afar and she came but she believed it not till she come to see it and she said the half was not told to her until she came in person to see it and she marveled at the wisdom she she she she proved solomon with hard questions if we turn keep your place in chronicles here but let's turn to first kings first kings chapter four let's just look at this example of solomon first kings chapter 4 verse 29. first kings 4 and 29 and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much enlarges in the heart and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the seashore and solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country and all the wisdom of egypt for he was wiser than all men than ethan the azerite and heman the choco and chokhal and darda the sons of moho and his fame was in all nations round about and he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a thousand and five and he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also a beast and a thousand of creepy things and of fishes and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon from all the kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom let's go back to second chronicles now you see she came and tried him with hard questions and and it's amazing that uh nothing was hit of all of her questions but but we wonder what was she asking we talked about this on sunday and we bring it right up to today i mean everything that that happened then is happening now in a form and a greater than solomon is here that same spirit that was there giving solomon wisdom we saw in jesus christ we saw return in this day and a prophet and and like we talked about sunday amen who told us about the war in heaven who told us what's wrong with our flesh who told us why there has to be a blood sacrifice why a human had to shed blood amen to redeem us back who told us what happened in the garden of eden amen who told us how the earth got in this condition tilted off of its axes spinning out here in an elliptical orbit who told us that amen it wasn't just the prophet of god it was a greater than solomon that revealed it through the prophet of god the wisdom that talked of birds and beasts and trees and of nature and all this and brother banham will come and he'll talk of of trees and nature and he'll tell us that an atomic bomb burst and and threw the earth away from the sun and then in the the water the fountains of the deep broke open and there was condensation of the of the the atmosphere and it began to rain and where else can you find this i wonder if solomon was able to tell the queen of sheba some of these things i wonder if solomon could tell how hybridization came into the human race i wonder if he could tell her answer all her hard questions what about dinosaurs why what are their fossil records where that's from the prophet told us you see a greater than solomon is here oh what about what hybrid food does to us amen what about the fur the pyramid and what it was all about you see a greater than solomon is here and he proved it she came amen and she asked hard questions and she got answers to all that was in her heart amen and we didn't even know to ask these questions but god was still giving us answers that we didn't even know we had questions for yet we were so far away from god and so misunderstood the bible that we didn't even have the questions but he had already gave us the answers the nomination that had taken us so far away from the reality of the word and into a fairy tale to a watered-down gospel that we didn't even know to ask how do we get in this condition and why did it have to be a blood sacrifice why are humans sacrificed why virgin birth but praise god but the revelation of serpent seed it reveals why a virgin birth and why a blood sacrifice but we didn't even know to ask that question we were so far gone amen but greater than solomon was here working through a human vessel to give us answers that we would cut that we needed to have answers to even though we were so far gone we didn't yet have the questions i say the queen of sheba is probably further along than we were when we stuck in denominationalism amen and hebrews 4 12 says for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit of joints and morrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him in whom we have to do when they when they stood before solomon in judgment i'm sure they felt naked when he judged the two harlots he absolutely unveiled the whole the whole scene with just a little bit of wisdom i'm sure because the word is the discerner amen it's not the man it's the word that's the discernment i want to read that more carefully it says the word of god the word of god is who we're talking about the word of god is quick and powerful right further down it says neither is there neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight the word of god his sight see the word of god is not just a sterile thing that's printed on paper the word of god is a he and nothing is not hid before his sights well the realm says in the message shalom no wonder he said the queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with her generation and condemn this one because she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here how that little queen way down a heathen saw that light and come from miles through the desert three months on a camel's back to hear the wisdom of solomon and them standing right there with solomon being a type a figure of him they were standing right there with jesus they were missing he said it greater than solomon she's going to judge this generation amen because she came why she heard a rumor about what was happening and she would give every she would pack up so much goods and so much effort to travel three months on camelback just to find out if it was true or not amen and brother bennett said and we won't even cross the street but he says she saw that light and then she saw that light what light it was the light of the word friends it was the light of christ it was the same light that's on top of the new jerusalem she saw that light and she came to that light and now there's a prophecy that the gentiles will come to his life and here's a gentile queen coming to that light it wasn't a physical light it was the illumination of the understanding that god had given to mankind and that light is still shining at the top of new jerusalem and there's people that's going to find their way to this light and what is it it's understanding it's enlightenment amen it's it's saying i can see what made you see the light what light a greater than solomon is here where is he he's on the throne at the top of the of the pyramid of the church who else knows i mean let's look in this day friends who else on this planet knows why there was a virgin birth what happened in the garden what happened in war in heaven amen why the earth is tilted away from the sun who else knows those things who else knows where the dinosaur bones came from praise god because there's a light at the top of mount zion there's a light we've come through seven church ages capped off in this day in the bright age and there's a light at the top of the mountain amen and people see that light and they're coming to the light it's the illumination of a greater than solomon it's a wisdom of the word now i want to look i want to move from that and i want to look at something else here in chapter 8. we back up to chapter 8 second corinthians chapter 8. verse 12. i want to read a couple scriptures in succession from here and then over in first kings in the latest foundation and talk about it for a minute then solomon offered burnt offering unto the lord on the altar of the lord which he had built before the porch even after a certain rate every day off offering according to the commandment of moses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the sodom feast three times in the year even in the feast of unleavened bread in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles and he appointed according to the order of david's father the courses of the priests to their service and the levites to their charges to praise and minister before the priest is the duty of every day required the porters also by their courses at every gate for so had david the man of god commanded and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and levites concerning the matter of concerning the treasures so david had given instruction for the order of the levites for praise for worship reporters for sacrifices and solomon does exactly what his father says whatsoever my father showed me that's what i do and he set and ordered the worship in the temple he didn't just build a temple he said in order the worship the sacrifice he kept the law he kept the word and he kept the commandments of his father and he established an order to worship and there's a reason we're saying this and just hold that in your mind go over to first kings chapter four first kings chapter four and verse one i'm going to read two more pat passages and hopefully tie this together first kings chapter 4 verse 1. so king solomon was king over israel all israel and there were the princes which he had azariah the son of zadok the priest elohoraf and ahaya the sons of shisha the scribes jehoshaphat the son of ahilu the recorder banaya the son of jehoiada was over the host and zadok and ebe aether with a priest and azariah the sons the son of nathan was over the officers and zaboon the son of nathan was principal officer and the king's friend and ashar was over the household and adina ram the son of abdu was over the tribute and solomon had 12 office officers over all israel which provided vittles for the king and his household each man his month in a year and made provisions a scoot skip over to verse 21 and solomon reigned over all the kingdom from the river into the land of the philistines and unto the border of egypt they brought presents and served solomon all the days of his life and solomon's provision for one day now this is the food that was provided for one day solomon's provision for one day was 30 measures of fine flour three score 60 measures of meal the 10 fat oxen 20 oxen out of the pastures a hundred sheep besides hearts and robux and followed deer and fatted foul how many people was he feeding for he had dominion over all the region on this side of the river from tipsa even to aza over the kings on this side of the river and he had peace on all sides around about him and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his vine under his fig tree from dan even to beersheba all the days of solomon this this verse 25 smacks of the millennium same verbage same thing every man dwelled peaceably under his vine and under his fig tree from dan to be shiva all the days of solomon and solomon had 40 000 stalls of horses for his chariots and 12 000 horsemen and those officers provided vittles for king solomon and for all that came into the king solomon's table every man in his month they lacked nothing barley also in straw for the horse and dromedaries brought them to the place where the officers were every man according to his charge now let's get to the point back over to second chronicles or yes second chronicles where were we chapter nine now let's get to the point of all of that solomon ordered according to the word of david the worship in the temple he made sure it went right made sure it was done right he established the order of the every 12 month an officer over the charge bringing all this food feeding so many people officers of this and treasurers and and recorders and and uh captains of the host and soldiers he had all of these things going now let's read from verse three chapter nine second chronicles chapter nine verse three and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendants of his ministers and their apparel see it wasn't just solomon's wisdom in answering her questions that caught her eye it was the order of the kingdom it was the meat of the table it was the attendance of his ministers and their apparel his cup bearers also and their apparel his ascent by which he went up to the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her it took her breath away when she he answered all of her hard questions she there was nothing hid from her but it wasn't just the wisdom because the wisdom had to bring a life it was the wisdom and the life together when she heard the wisdom and saw the life there was no more spirit in her amen this is written this way for a reason friends amen because you can get the wisdom that comes from the message and not have the life and when you don't have the life i want to know where is the light that's attracting the gentile queen that's bringing her from afar out of her denomination out of her wrong standing and then causing her to travel on a camel for three months and bring all of her substance to lay at the feet of solomon what is it amen what took her breath away was not just the wisdom that the message contains but the life that it brings to the church because a greater than solomon is here and if a greater is solomon here there should be a greater witness than she saw in solomon's courts because if solomon's wisdom amen and is keeping the order of the word in the order of the worship amen could do that to that gentile queen why should a greater than solomon here today working in our lives through the wisdom of the word that's been given what should it do to us today friends amen when i when i came from afar amen from afar and i came to the church it wasn't just the tapes say man it wasn't just the preaching that was the initial attraction i saw the light on top of zion i came but when i saw the families in an order when i saw the women dressed like women the men act like men men taking responsibility for their families the church said in order the order of worship i had no more spirit in me it took my breath away i couldn't resist it any longer and after it took her breath away everything she had brought she piled at solomon's feet see the two have to go together he he had to purge he had to do a purging friends of all the false spirits because all those spirits that were purged were lovers of self we're selfish self-centered with self-desire self-motives if that would have stayed in the kingdom and not got purged there would have been nothing for the queen to see because it would have divided it would have caused strife there would have been no harmony amen but every when she what the queen saw when she saw everything sat in order amen the order of worship the order of families amen the order of the song service the dress of the people the order of the trustees the order of the sunday school teachers amen the order of the moms the order of the dads to order the teenagers to order the little kids do you get what i'm saying when she saw it all working together and working in harmony there was no more spirit in her she knew this was the real deal this was it friends and what i was told amen was only half amen of the wisdom because the word the word the word had put the kingdom in a golden age and the word can bring us ourselves our lives amen our own flesh into a golden age amen spiritually we can come to a golden age where the inside man can conquer the outside man and bring it subject to the word of god be to god this isn't the time to hear the wisdom and be like zeda or be like abby athar or shimmy i or joab and have self-interest and self-motives in order for them to pull off what was pulled off in the kingdom amen they all had to find their position and find their place under solomon's wisdom and every joint had to supply within 20 years they had built his palace and they built the house of the lord they needed craftsmen they needed mechanics they needed embroiders they need those that can do engraving those that could cast gold amen the priest had to be set in order they had to know how to bring the daily sacrifice how to do the special feast amen what portion went where it took it took years to get this kind of order amen it was at least 20 years because she shows up after the temple has been inaugurated and established and it took 20 years to complete that so under it wasn't like solomon shows up in day one everything's in order no solomon's got to judge this and judge that amen it was three years before shimmy i met his destruction he gave him space to repent he gave him time to try out the spirit amen and after three years he proved what he really was and that was purged out so it's not that everything happened overnight amen it took years it took years to purge this out and years to purge that out years to purge this out amen then years to establish this order in this order and this order he had 12 captains 12 princes that were over the king's provisions one over every month amen and he had to work i would imagine this is just for the chad but if you saw what the daily allowance was daily 10 oxen fatted 10 oxen from the patch a hundred sheep sixty measures of this and so you see that's every day and each one of these princes were in charge of 30 days i imagine they had to work all year with how many people to gather all the provisions just to meet their obligation for one month so one day i mean one day would take me a lifetime together for one day of the king's portion would take me a lifetime i mean these guys didn't do it by themselves there was hundreds and hundreds of people working together to provide meat for the king's table amen for one month times 12. each prince amen had his region amen and in his region he had those that that he was over and they had farmers of grain and farmers of cattle and farmers of sheep and all of these that were putting together and storing up and laying aside and putting away because their 30 days were coming and the prince may have been the one and a few others who delivered to the kingdom but the farmer on the backside of mount gilead over by mount hermon amen he's the one who's making it happen right when she saw the meat at the table she wasn't just seeing a a nice cut of meat amen but the whole kingdom was working to get that meat on the table the whole body of israel pulled together was working to support the ministry that god gave was supporting the word the wisdom the light that was in israel the whole body was laboring and they didn't all have the same job but they all had something to do from the tiniest to like the most profound amen the guy who made the menorah amen was no less than the guy who was raising the wheat for the king's table because when the queen saw it all she saw it all she saw the minister she saw the meat at the table she saw their clothing who made the clothing who raised the sheep that grew the wool and sheared the wool and you see what she saw was not just a cup bearer there's a pair on a minister there's a barrel and meet at his table and she saw the order by the way he went up to the lord's house amen she was saw the order of worship she saw the conduct of all those that were serving this gift serving the word and when she saw all of that she wasn't just seeing the handful of people she was seeing an entire group of people work together for this word for the message that they had for for the for the dispensation that they were in under solomon and i want to say there's a greater than solomon that's here if you could have a farmer in obscurity raising weed or raising an auction to send it to the king's table who would never get credit for that never know outside of his local region what he did amen if he would do that for solomon what are we to do for a greater than solomon if we never get noticed we never get in the limelight our name never gets mentioned we never eat at the king's table amen we never become a prince amen can we be happy on the backside of mount gilead under the shadow of hermann amen doing our part to support the ministry to support the word in this day what did what did the queen of sheba see the queen of sheba saw a people rally around the word she saw people support solomon's support all that he was doing and what was solomon doing solomon was bringing back correct worship they made correct placement purging out false spirits bringing a golden age amen and there's a greater than solomon here to bring a golden age in your life and in my life and to the bride of jesus christ and what are we going to do amen we're going to let that amen that ministry that wisdom put us in our place and we're going to give everything we got so so many people we talk about so many times and i've struggled with this in my past what's my position in my body what am i supposed to be doing does anybody ever ask that question don't worry about what you're supposed to do banaya didn't ask that question zadok didn't ask that question solomon didn't ask that question brazilian i didn't ask that question his sons didn't ask that question what did they do they did what was in their hand they did what they were told they did what they could they were faithful in every station of life and the king put them in position sometimes we drag our feet doing nothing waiting for god to tell us what our position in the body is and if it doesn't come with a title trustee deacon minister pastor evangelist then it doesn't feel like a position in the body see we're just going to route the devil out right now we're just going to root him out of every crack in every crevice you tell me a father and mother living this word in their home is not as important as a minister in the pulpit they're every bit as important as a minister in the pulpit a daddy who will give godly instruction to children and raise him in the fear and admonition of the lord amen it might be the farmer growing oxen under the mount herman but amen it matters at the king's table when the queen's looking and when she sees it she recognizes god is in this place and it takes her breath away see it's not it's not about if i only knew what my position was if i only knew what i'm supposed to do in the body amen wrong idea god has put you here god has brought you to the word god has given you something he's given you a husband a wife a child amen he may i ask you to teach sunday school he may give you something to do but whatever you find in your hand to do do it with all thy might amen do it with everything you've got and do it for the lord do it for the greater than solomon that's here raise your children for the king amen serve your husband for the king care for your wife for the king come to church in the order of worship for the king [Applause] don't worry about what i'm supposed to do god is giving you what you're supposed to do do it amen and whatever comes next he'll give it to you he'll put it in your hand he'll call you to a work many times you're established right in your position and don't even know it because we can't put a title on it the farmer who's under herman amen raising sheep and dividing a portion of that to go with everybody else in the region who cuts a portion who's gathered by the prince who brings 100 sheep per day for a month amen so so that the queen of sheba can see the meat on the table and recognize that god's in this place he may not have known the full extent of his impact he may not have realized it was his lamb chop on the table that day you see what i'm saying friends but he's raising for his family he's raising for himself and cutting out a portion this is what i can do for the kingdom he may have not thought it was much but the queen of sheba recognized it was god and it took her breath away your moms are at home with your babies raising them up teaching them bibles and teaching them manners teaching them basic respect teaching them how to sit through a service it may just seem like i'm just farming i'm just all it is is i just i cut a few barrels of wheat off to the side to go with the portion of everybody else in the area that goes with a bigger portion that gets swallowed up in a huge amount that nobody notices god keeps good records a greater than solomon is here we are in position god put you in this body for a reason god brought you to this message for a reason god called you to this word for a reason god put you in contact under the great king the greater than solomon and you're in the kingdom for a reason don't doubt it don't question it don't look for a work to do whatever's in your hand do it if it's a mother if it's a father if it's a single amen it doesn't matter what it is whatever god has put in your hand do it amen if it's for you to be faithful to come to the house of the lord just to encourage somebody else who sees you faithfully come do it with all your heart come to church for the king amen amen read your bible pray for the king come to prayer time for the king whatever it is that you can do do it for the king banaya didn't ask to be captain of the host banaya joined to david after he heard that david had been anointed by samuel uh yeah by samuel and he was fleeing from saul and running from cave to cave amen bania went not to get anything not to be anybody he went because this is the word and he served that word from this cave to that cave and amen amen when when he needed to break through a line of philistines he served there and when he had to go into a snowy pit and then go into a pit on a snowy day and kill a lion he did it not to be captain of the host to serve the word the lion was there he was there he killed the lion he didn't kill the lion to get promoted the captain of the host he did what was there do you understand what i'm saying he whatever was in his hand he did amen and god moved him amen from the captain over a small band going from cave to cave then he put him over the parasites and the cherozites i think that's what you call them the special guard for david his special army then he put him over that and then after the whole thing with job transpired then he put him over the captain of the whole host see he was never looking for a position he was never asking what my title is he was never saying what can i do amen what am i supposed to do he just did what was in his heart he served the word he served the word in printing he served the word and perforating he served the word and cleaning amen he served the word and serving a meal amen working at a funeral dinner helping at a wedding taking a meal to somebody who's sick writing out a card of encouragement see what i'm saying friends when the queen of sheba sees under the rule of a greater than solomon sees every joint supplying working together for love not for promotion for love not for gain for love amen recognizing the day we're in recognizing who is here recognizing whom we serve not to get noticed by the congregation not to get noticed by the pastor but if nobody ever notices i will raise the best sheep that i can raise because a little bit of this goes to the king's table and these five sheep i give won't even make a whole day's worth of food you realize how insignificant you can feel he eats a hundred sheep a day i can only give five i can't even give a whole day's worth but these five these five are good sheep they've been well cared for i've reared them by hand amen there's not a blemish on them the muscling is perfect they're the best of my flock i got the best genetics i breed the best to the best amen i take the best care i i feed him in the best pastures with the coolest running water amen whatever i give to the king is the best and when the king eats that lamb chop amen or that leg of lamb he might delight in that leg and have no idea who took such tender care of this lamb to provide his meat that day or the king's guest who comes from sheba and the farmer may never know that it was his portion that made it on her plate that caused her heart to fail within her see there's a greater than solomon here we should have among us greater than what the queen of sheba saw the word we have is a discerner of the thoughts and intents are we have discernment in our midst how many will raise your hand and say the word has discerned me we have discernment in our midst not a man amen the word that's been restored to us in this day we have the wisdom that solomon spoke of of trees and of birds and of nature and of all things that we ever wondered about right brother branham tells us hey you know they built the pyramids with some sort of atomic power or something like that they're still trying to figure out how they built the pyramids and we know why because of greater than solomon is here but it's not just the wisdom without the life it's the wisdom brings a golden age and a golden age brings a body of believers who will rally around this king and give everything they've got to the king to support just the daily provision of food is extraordinary the amount of management planning tracking overseers supervisors storage facilities transportation if i would pick one of you out and say now listen for a month i need this grocery list how many workers do you need how many store houses do you need how many wagons of transportation how many oxen and donkeys and camels is it going to take just to get it here where are we going to keep it how are we going to keep bandits from it how are we going to keep rodents away from how are we going to keep it and give it to the king every you realize it's a much more monumental task than just the two verses it takes to explain it anybody who's been in logistics or in business they're like there is no way i'm so glad i wasn't one of them 12 princes i mean what do you do if you have crop damage you gotta still get food to the king see it was huge it was a huge undertaking the order of the service the order of the temple was huge it took an army of priests the daily sacrifices were huge the the order of the service was huge the daily meet was huge the servants that would clean that would transport that would notify that would record that we're over the treasury that that would count the daily money coming in amen that that would would buy would sell i mean it was a huge undertaking what the queen of sheba saw was more than just the wisdom of a man she saw she saw what christ can do in a body of believers let's turn to ephesians chapter four let's bring it right to the new testament as we wind down ephesians chapter four brother branham says in questions and answers on the seals preaches it sunday morning before he preaches the seventh seal the question is would the bride of christ have would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture he said sure that's what's going on right now the bride of christ certainly it's the message of the hour the bride of christ sure she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble now we look at that brother branham makes a statement is the bride have a ministry before the rep sure it's what's going on right now it's the message of the hour it consists of apostle prophet and you can automatically say well i don't have one of those titles i'm out of the bride's ministry don't miss it let's go to ephesians 4. verse 11. and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers four now listen there was a reason he gave these ministry gifts let's find out what they're for and we'll find out what brother branham is referring to in the ministry of the bride for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ to build up the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god and to a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ now this points right back to adoption the fullness of the stature of christ points right back to adoption amen where where in adoption points to positional placing so that means the fivefold ministry is here for the perfecting of the the body of christ to build everyone up into the stature of a perfect man to bring them up to what amen to sow the word and to bring somebody as they grow under the leadership of the holy ghost and under the ministry of the word to grow them up into a place where they can be positioned in the body and be a contributor that's why the fivefold ministry is here for positional placing that's part of the that's part of the ministry is for positional placing of the body not to say yeah they've got a ministry it's these five offices if you're not that you're not in the ministry the ministry is the display of christ amen the display of christ is found when the whole camp is working together for one purpose when every joint supplies it everybody's found their place in the body of christ how do they do that through the five full ministry building them up on the word establishing in the word building them up in the stature of christ and so they can get placed amen and under adoption placed in a work that god can work through them now not just through five offices but through the whole body the five offices are here to help everybody get in position but the ministry of the bride is the ministry of christ it's christ working through his body let's keep reading that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men in the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up unto him and all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love that went far beyond five ministry offices that became the whole display of jesus christ in a whole body where every joint supplieth amen listen every joint now listen uh i want to read this again carefully verse 16 from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted amen the body is pressed together amen this love bond that we're coming to is pressing us together as one body compacted by which every joint supply us according to the effectual working and the measure of every part that means there's something given to every part to benefit other parts the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love what that means is everybody gives what they've got because they love god and they love the body it was what it was what the queen of sheba saw when she sat at at solomon's feet and sat in his core and sat at his table what she saw was this right here under the ministry of solomon under the ministry of christ and bringing them to a golden age what was the golden age the golden age was the display of christ what is our golden age christ in the body every joint supplyeth to the effectual working to the edifying of itself in love they had brought such peace solomon's wisdom the word the enlightenment the light that was at the top of that pyramid brought so much uh peace so much understanding that there was a bond of love and every joint was supplying throughout the whole kingdom just so the queen of sheba could see and however short her stay was what she saw was encompassing the entire kingdom and what she saw left no spirit in her at all i want to be a people that when people come in contact with us and they see how we love one another they see our families in order the order of our worship they see the children and the teenagers the moms the dads the widows the older couples the young couples the singles when they see they see they see the life i want them to come in hear the wisdom i want them to hear the wisdom but i want them to see the life and i want it to have the same effect it had on the queen of sheba that there's no more spirit or no more resistance i can't resist this anymore this is god i give over to it i empty my camels and i empty my purses and i give everything to it because this is god see it's got to be written epistles living word read by all men brother branham says in the message an adoption to did you notice moses the great miracle performer that brought down israel down through the land and brought them up to the promised land but did not place their inheritance to them he did not give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but joshua divided the land to the people is that right and christ brought the church up to the place where their possession was made to them was given to them just the jordan to cross but the holy spirit is the one who sets the church in order joshua today puts the church in its order giving to each one gifts places positions and he is the voice of god speaking to the inner man that christ has saved the holy spirit do you get that much of it now we're getting over in the book of ephesians now the same way he positionally places the church there where they belong now joshua placed him in the natural land the holy spirit is placing the church positionally in the land that they in the possession that they belong in their inheritance now the first thing he started off here he addresses the letter paul which we're going to find out after a while that all this mystery was revealed to him not in seminary not in theologian but was a divine revelation of the holy ghost that god gave paul knowing that the mystery of god he said that had been hid since the foundation of the world had been revealed to him by the holy spirit and the holy spirit amongst the people was setting each one in order setting the church in position is the holy ghost been released in this day unbound to do what to put the church in position do you think he forgot about you don't let the devil tell you that don't let lies hold us back from giving our all don't let the deception of the enemy say you know i can see this one i can see this one but what is there for me to do friends that's self-love that's a pity party you know really what that is is saying well well this little thing i got is not as important as his well well yeah i mean of course i've got this but i'm a witness at work but what's that you realize whatever i hand find it to do do it with thy might do it for the king be a witness at work for the king be a mother or father be a teenager for the king be a student for the king do it for the king let's go to first corinthians first corinthians 14. and 26 how is it brethren when you come together every one of you had a psalm had a doctrine had a tongue how the revelation had an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying he goes on i won't read it all but you can read on through the rest of the chapter he goes on to explain you know if if you don't have a pro if you have a tongue with no interpretation hold your peace and let the prophet speak by two or the most by three and let another judge do everything decently in order let everything be done to edification that means don't let anything be done for yourself glory don't get up and give a show don't don't sing so people think you're a good singer amen don't there's no performance here there's no there's no exalting self everything we do let it be done for edification let it be done to bless the bride bless the body bless somebody else whether it's seen or not seen don't just blurt out in tongues when there's no prophet there's no interpretation because what's the point of that only to prove that you can speak in tongues but let everything be done for the edification of others not the glorification of self brother brahma says the influence of another and the message the influence of another from 1963 says when you're playing a ball game as is the football season the thing we want to do is not everybody try to take the ball away from the man that's got it he is trying to guard that man protect him let him get through we are trying to make a goal see but could you imagine a team so untrained as to find one man their own man with that ball running to the field goal and then instead of trying to knock the enemy away from him the opposing team to let your own man that's got the ball take off with it and every man trying to take the ball out of his hand while you're bound to lose of course and today we have the same thing when we see god come on the scene and going to bless a certain thing let's keep all the enemies away from it let's use our influence as tackles not runners tackles that protects the runner let's impact the ball through because there's no opposition all he has to do is just keep running and we should be tackles amen those aren't the ones that get interviewed at the end of the game they're not the ones who get heisman trophies they're not the ones in the limelight they're not the ones wearing everybody's wearing their jersey and got their number and their name on their back what is that oh that's the right guard what do you do without him see brother branham's telling us amen support one another amen support their gift encourage it pray for them stand in the way of the enemy don't always try to one-up or out do or or pull somebody down or take the ball from them let's support one another amen let's block for one another let's take amen a position that nobody will know about and let's get on our knees and pray for the one running with the ball let's pray for those that are gifted among us who write songs who sing who preach who do the things amen just let's let's be a tackle let's be a guard amen nobody will wear my jersey nobody will give me a heisman trophy nobody will get my playing card but god knows what i did god knows and i did it because i loved god not to have my card and meant condition worth 47 in 50 years not to get in the hall of fame and not to get a heisman trophy but i did it because i love the lord and i see his anointed packing the ball and i'm willing to get on my knees and block every devil from that brother from that sister amen from that individual why because there's a greater than solomon here friends philippians chapter 2. i'm just going to read two more passages of scriptures you know on wednesday nights i keep coming with less and less notes because i'm trying not to hold everybody too long and i'm preaching longer with less notes i need to come with more notes i can't even find philippians all right ephesians philippians all right philippians chapter 2 verse 1. if there if there be therefore any consolation of christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill you my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one accord and of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own on things but every man also on the things of others this is what we need in the body of christ go back to first corinthians 3 and we'll just finish with this tonight first corinthians 3 and 1. and brethren i brethren could not speak unto you as in the spiritual but as in the carnal even as in the babes in christ i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are you able for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men let's stop right there clear indication of our spiritual condition if there are if there are endings strife and divisions you are carnal and walk as men those things should never be among us why are greater than solomon is here where am i at spiritually carnal as a man not as a son and daughter of god because if there's endings strife and divisions it's not right verse 4 for a while one saith i am of paul another i am of apollos are you not carnal who then is paul and who was apollos but ministers by whom you believed even as the lord gave to every man i think he's telling you don't align yourself with preachers that doesn't mean you're not supposed to love your pastor you're supposed to love your pastor but we don't divide ourselves by preachers i'm of paul i'm of apollos i believe this way i believe that way forget it verse six i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase so neither so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for we are laborers together with god ye are god's husbandry you're god's vineyard you're god's field you're god's farm you're god's garden ye are god's building what is paul what is apollos just somebody who's laboring in god's vineyard paul labored apollos labored john labored peter labored they all labored amen they'll all receive their reward but not for us to say well i'm with paul i'm with apollos you're carnal divisions envying strife you're carnal you're mesmen you're not acting right i say god spare us from that but let us have a higher vision let us all pull our resources together let's not divide by camps or by churches or by ministries or by certain preachers or certain ways of thinking but let us all pull together and say i'm here to give whatever i got whatever little bit i got is going to be the very best that i can contribute amen because there's a greater than solomon here do you believe there's a greater than solomon here then i believe that there should be a display greater than the display that the queen of sheba saw every home every life every individual young old amen is a contributor in the body of christ and everybody should be doing whatever god has given them to do if the only thing you can do is pray brother branham said that's the most powerful weapon ever given to man you say all i can do is pray are you diminishing prayer by that statement are you saying well all i can do is pray all you can do is pray there's not a better thing you can do than pray praise god only one carries the ball at a time but everybody else can block support encourage cheer alone there's a greater than solomon here and i believe there's still gentile queens out there that are willing to travel to this light now hear the fame of the wisdom of the message of the hour the answer to the questions denominations can't answer why are we here how did we get here why a virgin birth why a blood sacrifice why human sacrifice why why judgment what happened to noah's day why are they finding dinosaur fossils a greater than solomon is here i say god bring to us a greater manifestation of a unity of a body than what the queen of sheba saw bring to us a greater desire to do our little part if if i'm a prince if i'm an overseer if i'm a recorder if i'm a treasure if i'm an attendant if i'm a farmer whatever it is for me to do if i'm a cupbearer amen the queen saw the cupbearer and saw how the cupbearer was dressed if all i can do is dress right i'm going to do it for the king if i'm going to put on my apparel amen and my apparel is going to catch the attention of the queen of sheba i'm going to put on my apparel for the king to glorify his kingdom not myself when he looked at the the the ministers and their apparel and then they put on apparel for the king they didn't put apparel for the self because when she saw their apparel she honored the king everything we do matters let's all pull together and say i don't care if it's paul or apollos really i don't care what i want is that greater than solomon to be on it to be lifted up to be exalted for his light to shine when we attract people to his light when they come to his light may they look around and see the life that that light produces in our homes and our in our individuals in our youth and when they look around they said i was amazed at what i heard but i'm just as amazed at what i see you know how confusing it is to say we have the light of the hour and not the audacity to cover our flesh to dress decent to to talk the way the prophet told us to talk to dress the way he told us to dress to stay away from worldly entertainment the way he told us to stay away from early entertainment you know what conflict you bring in people's hearts and minds amen when you show such wonderful wisdom of a greater than solomon but the life around the kingdom doesn't line up i say god line me up line me up amen if i'm a farmer amen if i'm an attendant if i'm a seamstress and i'm from engraver i'm engraving for the king i'm sowing for the king i'm raising children for the king i'm working my little farm on the back side of the kingdom for the king i'm giving the best i got because the queen of sheba saw more than just the wisdom of solomon she saw the life of israel let's all stand musicians if you come praise be to god greater than solomon is here and there's a kingdom on earth a body of christ on earth it's a many-membered body and you and i are part of that body i've heard statements i've even thought these thoughts before myself well if i was in their position i would know what to do i could really do something for the lord that's a joab thought that's a shimmy-eyed thought but i want to have a banaya thought i want to have a brazilian thought i brought you substance because i love you i brought you goods not to sit at your table when you were at your lowest when you couldn't give me anything back when it looked like you probably could lose your kingdom i still knew you were anointed the king i served you because i love god's word and i love god's anointing not to get anything back mania joined when david was nothing and when david became something he didn't grab a position like job he didn't try to exalt himself he didn't push to get anything what he did was serve the king faithfully just like he did when he was in a cave and god told him you're now you're now captain of the host i want to serve whether it's in the backside of a cave whether it's in the backside of the desert i want to give him everything and whatever else he wants me to do he'll give me to do i don't want to sit around waiting well if i had a bigger farm i would give sheep to the king if i've got two he can have one give give where we're at give what we've got give with all of our hearts serve the king in our daily life don't look for something else to do daily life serve the king and our prayer time with our family devotions with our children encouragement to our wife love and support of a husband serve the king that way and if we're faithful in the least he can give us more let's all pray lord jesus we thank you god we thank you lord that you've made it so simple you made it so simple in showing us what the queen of sheba saw what she saw was the work of an entire nation come together to support a king god may your whole nation of your bride your people on the earth your body and flesh may they all work together to support your kingdom to have you high and lifted up may we represent the kingdom well nor may we be a representation of your wisdom and your light in our daily tasks at home in our workplaces in our schools in church and out of church with believers and not with believers may we always lord reflect this kingdom we're part of and may we always give every joint supply every joint every joint supplies with that portion that they have for every man has been given a portion of faith let us give back lord to the body what you've given to us whether it's small or great whether we think it's big or small it doesn't matter what's in our hand or we want to give to you we want to give you the best if you called us to pray we want to give you the best prayer time if you call us to give we want to give lord we want to give joyfully we've called us to encourage we encourage with a joyful heart if you called us to pray for the sick we do it with abundance of faith whatever it is you've called us to do let us do it with all of our heart lord to support your kingdom and if there's still a little gentile queen out there somewhere may she come to the light and see the life and may our heart be smitten may she lose her breath lord and give all to you god you did it for me when i saw the life in your children i heard the word i was amazed but when i saw the life there was no more spirit in me may that same thing happen for every predestinated seed that's still to be gathered in lord may we each one do our part so that the queen of sheba still has something to see oh we love you take us from here have preeminence among us use us for your glory lord we pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless your friends sing in my life be glorified be glorified [Music] [Music] today and in my life [Music]

you would heal this baby for your glory that you would intercede now lord that you would do something lord and manifest yourself that you would bless this brother and the sister lord and give them
