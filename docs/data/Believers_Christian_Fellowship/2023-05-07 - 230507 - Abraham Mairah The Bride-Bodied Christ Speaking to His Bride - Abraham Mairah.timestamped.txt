[18:42] sitting down with her this past week and
[18:44] hearing her testimony and how the Lord
[18:46] has drawn her amen and it's exciting
[18:48] it's exciting to see that God knows
[18:50] where to find his sheep and he knows how
[18:52] to draw them amen

[19:07] [Music]
[19:30] come on
[19:32] [Music]
[19:57] [Music]
[20:03] [Music]
[20:10] ah
[20:13] yeah
[20:20] [Music]
[20:59] yo once again I want to Salute Your
[21:02] Friends in the name of all Jesus Christ
[21:03] this morning
[21:04] and I'll request that your seat for a
[21:07] few seconds
[21:09] um I trust everybody's doing fine
[21:12] why not the house of the Lord amen
[21:17] the best place to be before we go there
[21:20] yes
[21:21] you know he promised us he gave us the
[21:23] privilege to be how for four houses
[21:27] you know
[21:28] your body is a house your home is the
[21:30] house the church is the house and there
[21:32] is another house
[21:33] that is going to prepare for you
[21:36] so we are thankful that at least all of
[21:40] us have got a house
[21:43] and all those four houses are available
[21:44] for you so you should thank the Lord
[21:47] amen of course
[21:49] he's not going to take you to his house
[21:52] the other one and until you take you
[21:54] take him to your house
[21:58] yeah suddenly it has been
[22:01] um a special time for me the other day I
[22:04] was the whole day with my
[22:06] grandkids playing with them you know
[22:08] there's only one thing that I couldn't
[22:09] do they wanted me to play football with
[22:11] them and I I think I'm getting a little
[22:16] bit older now so my legs may not be so
[22:20] good for football but I had a wonderful
[22:23] time and my grandkids have come very
[22:26] fast and they are all very health and
[22:29] strong so it was nice also and Young
[22:34] you see I really would say I prompt
[22:38] brother Moses my son-in-law to come here
[22:41] because I felt like when I come to Lima
[22:43] I should be hitting two birds with one
[22:46] stone
[22:48] I didn't want him to be away in Chicago
[22:50] and then it would compel me to go there
[22:52] you know so I'm very glad that whenever
[22:55] I passed by here I'm I'm having tooth
[22:58] you know two sources of inspiration and
[23:02] joy and gladness to families the
[23:05] spiritual family and also my my an
[23:09] extension of my family
[23:11] so I can see my friend brother Chester
[23:13] God bless you it's good to have you to
[23:16] see you here and many friends I was you
[23:20] know humble when I had people have
[23:22] traveled from Fairfield Alaska and
[23:25] Canada and may God bless you so much
[23:28] sometimes I get I get to wonder why
[23:31] maybe brother Chad was the one telling
[23:33] me that they are the ones to know the
[23:35] reason not to me so maybe they know that
[23:39] but
[23:42] um
[23:44] this one important thing for us
[23:48] is to become every day what God wants us
[23:53] to be
[23:54] because there is one signature statement
[23:57] time is no longer to be
[24:01] amen so the angel has already sworn
[24:05] and if that's what he said that's what
[24:08] it is
[24:09] so we really request for your prayers
[24:13] the challenge is everywhere
[24:16] you know
[24:18] like I said yesterday when you try to
[24:21] talk about the present tense God
[24:24] then the stone is always there
[24:27] you know the devil would want to Stone
[24:29] you because you are trying to connect
[24:31] yourself to the present tense of God
[24:33] you know you you would have no problem
[24:35] with the devil when you're queuing on
[24:37] the office that is already welcomed
[24:41] but when you are on the office that is
[24:43] working
[24:44] moving from the invisible God to the
[24:48] visible incarnate one then there is a
[24:51] problem you are always looked at as a
[24:54] danger to the devil yes but we are not
[24:56] going to retract we are not going to
[24:58] seed ground
[25:00] we are going to press on
[25:02] because the battle is the Lord is like
[25:04] our friend who was seeking singing Here
[25:07] stand still
[25:09] you know
[25:10] and um
[25:12] you are just like a body you know a
[25:15] shell but out of the shell will come
[25:17] forth a projectile
[25:22] the shell will fall down and sit still
[25:24] but a projectile from the shell
[25:28] is what will knock the devil down
[25:31] so we stand still because it's no longer
[25:33] our time it is him now and then a
[25:36] projectile will come from us
[25:38] so we thank God for the privilege so
[25:41] pray for us we shall always be praying
[25:43] for you remember you have a special
[25:45] place in our hearts and of course
[25:47] brother Chad will always say he benefits
[25:50] but I think I benefit more when I come
[25:52] and talk with him interact so many
[25:55] things that I I get to learn and yeah
[25:59] so maybe he learned something I think
[26:01] but I will always say I do that I always
[26:05] learn more
[26:06] I I really appreciate you friends so
[26:11] um it's just going time is running fast
[26:14] today is our last day again here and I'm
[26:18] happy it's my last day because I don't
[26:20] have much to say I'm finished I almost
[26:23] preached myself complete yesterday so
[26:26] I'm just now to Echo and say Amen thank
[26:29] you Lord and
[26:32] yeah so I really appreciate your friends
[26:35] so much so maybe we can just have a
[26:38] stand up and have a lot of prayer
[26:42] as we invite
[26:44] the Lord to come down
[26:47] loving Heavenly Father
[26:49] thank you Jesus for the privilege
[26:52] that we have been given
[26:55] by thy Divine Providence in a sovereign
[26:58] grace of God
[27:00] that in your great economy you saw us
[27:03] you knew us
[27:05] and you blessed us in your body
[27:08] we are now he is Lord a purchase of your
[27:11] blood
[27:12] as trophies in your hands and Lord I'm
[27:16] praying that you'll come down
[27:18] this day again
[27:21] Lord I know you have already come down
[27:23] but we pray the Lord even that anointing
[27:26] upon us
[27:27] will be realized
[27:30] and that God will have a way a special
[27:33] way you can deal with your children as I
[27:35] step out of the way thou knowest exactly
[27:39] what your children are needing
[27:42] what can be spoken for through the
[27:44] sleeps of clay that can edify exhort
[27:48] strengthen correct position you know it
[27:51] Lord
[27:53] with your own knowledge come and take
[27:56] over
[27:57] and bless the reading of your word and
[27:59] bless your servant anoint me strengthen
[28:01] me inspire me
[28:03] Lord Let It Be by your grace and For
[28:06] Your Glory in Jesus name we pray
[28:09] amen
[28:12] just thinking of some scripture I think
[28:14] something to do with the like a
[28:15] continuation of what we are preaching
[28:17] yesterday
[28:20] and I want us to go to the Book of
[28:22] Revelation
[28:28] chapter 1 and I'll pick from verse
[28:36] let me begin from verse 12.
[28:43] and I turned to see the voice that spoke
[28:46] with me and being turned I saw gold
[28:49] seven golden candlesticks
[28:52] and in the midst of the seven
[28:53] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[28:56] man
[28:57] closed with a garment downed the feet to
[29:00] the foot
[29:02] and got about the pups with the Golden
[29:05] Garden
[29:06] and his head and his hairs were white
[29:09] like wool as white as snow and his eyes
[29:12] were as a flame of fire
[29:17] the one also got the book of Ephesians
[29:23] chapter five
[29:26] verse 23
[29:33] for the husband is the head of the wife
[29:37] even as Christ is the head of the church
[29:39] and he is the savior
[29:42] of the body
[29:44] may God bless his word and bless you may
[29:47] be seated
[29:59] yesterday we ended on a position where
[30:02] the Prophet was saying
[30:04] it behooves us
[30:07] to create a vulcence and then invite him
[30:12] that he may dwell in US
[30:14] because that's the final standard
[30:19] no man has gone this way before
[30:22] but this one man was gone and that is
[30:25] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[30:27] he knows the way
[30:32] and he knows what he's going to do
[30:35] to make us
[30:37] you know to bring us to what he promised
[30:40] us
[30:42] and looking at the scripture here
[30:48] and it's interesting
[30:52] that um
[30:54] I know you've had many preachers preach
[30:57] this
[30:58] teach you this
[31:01] well I'm not a good teacher here
[31:04] but I just wanted to pick a thought just
[31:06] to add on what we're sharing yesterday
[31:10] and um you remember where we read
[31:16] John is hearing
[31:19] the voice speaking
[31:21] he was on this in the spirit on the
[31:23] Lord's day and he hide behind him
[31:27] a great voice as of a trumpet speaking
[31:30] and then in verse 12 he says he turned
[31:33] to see The Voice
[31:36] interesting
[31:39] because you don't turn to see The Voice
[31:41] you turn to see the person speaking
[31:46] but here he says he turned to see their
[31:48] voice
[31:51] just like in Eden the Bible says the
[31:54] voice of God was walking in a garden in
[31:57] the cool of the day
[31:59] The Voice walking
[32:03] so the voice was a person
[32:05] and here is also the voice is a person
[32:07] and John is standing to see The Voice
[32:16] and being turned I saw seven golden
[32:18] candlesticks
[32:24] and of course you know what is
[32:26] astounding for
[32:28] and in the midst of the seventh grade
[32:31] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[32:34] man
[32:38] is closed with the government down to
[32:40] the feet or to the foot and got about
[32:43] the pups with the Golden Garden
[32:50] and I wanted to pick something around
[32:52] there
[32:57] because when you come in I think in the
[32:58] look in the Book of Luke Chapter 11
[33:11] it is interesting that the Bible
[33:12] emphasizing
[33:15] that is Passion that was speaking to the
[33:18] seven Church ages giving the message to
[33:21] John to project it to the seven Church
[33:23] ages
[33:25] is emphasizing something about him
[33:31] and he's saying that he was gut about
[33:35] the pups with the golden guttle
[33:39] and here in Luke chapter 11 verse 27 he
[33:43] says and it came to pass as he spoke of
[33:46] these things a certain woman of the
[33:48] company lifted up her voice and said
[33:50] unto him blessed is the womb that bear
[33:53] thee and the pups which thou has sacked
[34:03] so the pups are the breasts
[34:10] blessed be the name of the Lord and in
[34:13] chapter 23 I think the same Book of Luke
[34:17] chapter 23 if we shall
[34:20] um
[34:21] look at somewhere here I think it's
[34:24] verse 29 chapter 23 verse 29 Jesus
[34:28] himself is speaking
[34:29] and he says for behold the days are
[34:32] coming in the which shall they say
[34:34] blessed are the barren and the wounds
[34:37] that never bear and the perps which
[34:40] never gave suck
[34:45] so we see when John turns to look at
[34:48] Jesus
[34:48] of course Jesus is standing in the midst
[34:51] of so many golden candlesticks and he
[34:54] sees Jesus there is one particular
[34:56] feature about him he has got breasts
[35:13] that would sound strange isn't it
[35:17] that we have
[35:19] a man here stunning but with breasts
[35:24] perhaps
[35:33] and that's why my title this morning is
[35:35] the bright body the Christ speaking to
[35:38] his bride
[35:42] is Christ in a bright body
[35:47] speaking the message to the seven child
[35:50] changes
[35:50] that is going to produce the bride
[35:56] he is here standing as a man but with
[35:59] breasts and he's covering himself like a
[36:02] woman the holy government going down to
[36:04] the feet
[36:10] but he's The Voice
[36:13] so like we said yesterday
[36:16] he is the head
[36:18] and this is the body the body is the
[36:20] church in other words it was already a
[36:22] complete body
[36:24] speaking forth what it's going to be but
[36:27] according to God as far as God is
[36:29] concerned before he even speaks the word
[36:31] it's already done
[36:33] [Music]
[36:35] because God is not surprised that
[36:37] whatever is going to achieve he has
[36:39] already achieved it before he begins as
[36:41] far as you are concerned you are already
[36:43] in heaven you are already in glory you
[36:45] are already a Victor before you even
[36:47] fight the battle
[36:51] as a Believer as a child of God
[36:54] glory be to God that's why you see here
[36:56] he is already in the full bright body
[37:03] and he's giving a message to the seven
[37:06] Church ages he
[37:08] and John is looking
[37:12] who is this one Speaking
[37:15] and a person is speaking
[37:17] yes he has the head of a man
[37:21] but he has a part of a woman
[37:28] now how are you going to ever deny the
[37:30] word
[37:31] when they spoke it when you are there
[37:33] you are the body that was holding the
[37:35] head that spoke of the world and it
[37:38] becomes impossible because we're part of
[37:40] the speaking machine
[37:42] you're a part of that that that
[37:44] instrumental it's not spocket
[37:50] and how are you going to fail to appear
[37:52] there
[37:53] when you were there
[37:55] when you were speaking the word that's
[37:57] why brother Brahman comes us that angel
[37:59] that that God has the loopholes and ties
[38:02] them up and brings the full complete
[38:04] word from the 70 Church ages and reprise
[38:07] it and gives it as a full package to us
[38:10] so we have the full seven course menu
[38:13] and that's why you sit there and say hey
[38:15] man you receive it and the devil cannot
[38:19] stop you I don't care what you go
[38:21] through because you were there you were
[38:23] part of the body that spoke of the world
[38:25] [Music]
[38:30] you were that female body
[38:33] praise God that's why I say I wish I was
[38:36] a preacher I could start preaching now
[38:39] brother
[38:47] and now brother comes here and he says
[38:49] that there is a where he says he has
[38:52] something
[38:54] um
[38:57] he says hearing a message
[39:00] um I think it should be
[39:02] the Civil Church ages where he says what
[39:05] we need today
[39:07] is another old-fashioned God sent God
[39:09] Holy Ghost Revival amen I don't mean I
[39:12] am trying to get you get excited
[39:15] together excited
[39:18] I know you are not excited
[39:21] but brother that's the truth
[39:25] he says just trying to get the point to
[39:28] you it is truth it is what we need all
[39:31] right now that's the Bible that's what
[39:34] the spirit says the candlesticks all
[39:36] right now the 13 is verse
[39:40] one like the son of man what one like
[39:44] him one like him
[39:52] who was this
[39:55] one like him
[39:59] to be like Jesus
[40:06] who is that one like him
[40:08] he says one like him who was this he's
[40:12] bright
[40:15] yes his bride
[40:18] one like him watch how it was close with
[40:22] the government down to the foot
[40:24] the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering
[40:27] her
[40:30] has washed us from our sins with his own
[40:32] blood all right got about the pups
[40:37] not a man
[40:39] a woman
[40:44] a woman
[40:46] now this brother but I'm saying this
[40:49] person here this body here that was
[40:51] standing there in the middle of the
[40:53] golden seven golden candlesticks he's
[40:55] not a man he's a woman but the voices of
[40:57] a man
[41:00] the voice is the voice of Jesus Christ
[41:03] he's the one giving the word to John to
[41:06] project the message for the church ages
[41:07] to produce the bride but now in the body
[41:10] here that John is looking at he's a
[41:12] woman
[41:20] he says not a man a woman with a golden
[41:23] Garden the gospel that held the power
[41:26] and the glory of God over the blood of
[41:28] Christ
[41:31] Oh what a beautiful picture we got here
[41:34] under consideration look here down to
[41:38] the foot God about it pops with the
[41:41] golden gato
[41:45] and he comes down and he says
[41:47] don't try to hide from him
[41:53] you will not hide from him
[41:57] you were in him
[42:00] you were the body
[42:02] just like I was preaching somewhere
[42:05] you are part of the mouth that speak the
[42:07] word
[42:08] you only you are only spewed out when
[42:11] you become lukewarm because you are
[42:14] welcome and neither cold nor hot I'm
[42:16] gonna spew you out of my mouth but if
[42:19] you are not lukewarm if you are already
[42:21] hot Christian you remain in the mouth of
[42:23] God you remain there so the very mouth
[42:25] that spoke of the word
[42:27] you were there
[42:28] you're a part of the friend
[42:31] oh how do I say it
[42:33] you are part of that to say mouse that's
[42:36] pocket yes so how are you gone to to
[42:39] doubt it how are you going to turn
[42:41] against it when when God spoke the word
[42:44] and you were part of the mouth that
[42:46] spoke the word
[42:48] and that's what the devil doesn't want
[42:50] you to realize and the Bible says God
[42:52] speaks with the mouth and confirms
[42:54] vindicates with the hand fulfills it
[42:56] with the hand and yet in the hand you
[42:58] are also written there your names are
[43:00] encrypted there and the Bible says no
[43:02] man can take you out of his hand
[43:07] not even you can take you out of his
[43:09] hands as long as you're predestinated
[43:12] you are there
[43:16] glory be to God so he says don't try to
[43:19] hide from him he knows who you are
[43:23] Where You Are and what you've done yes
[43:27] sir he sees everything
[43:30] and then he says there he stands in
[43:32] another message one like unto the son of
[43:35] man one like
[43:39] he's not the son of man like Percy fully
[43:43] he's like he's not he is he is not
[43:51] the goddess he's of a woman the head is
[43:54] of the man
[43:56] the voice is the man the looks the woman
[43:59] the working woman the head the man who
[44:03] is this one looks like the son of man
[44:06] but it's not who is this one looks like
[44:09] him
[44:11] final office
[44:13] where we were talking yesterday the
[44:15] final office Christ in the bright body
[44:22] so he had that
[44:24] before
[44:26] the message he was ever breached and
[44:28] that's why you cannot get lost
[44:31] you cannot fail
[44:33] because you were already there
[44:36] Glory oh God and and no devil is strong
[44:40] enough to take you away from the
[44:41] benefits
[44:43] from the full potentials from what God
[44:46] designated for you and gave you as a
[44:49] package that this is yours you are part
[44:52] of me I am part of you we together
[44:55] fulfilled with this we together you and
[44:59] I
[45:02] glory to go there he stands one like I'm
[45:05] the son of man in the midst of exposure
[45:07] exposition of the Civil judge ages that
[45:09] is Vision he says like one like under
[45:12] the son of man as the jewel is
[45:14] beautified by the mounting of the Ring
[45:18] so he is glorified in the midst of
[45:21] churches
[45:23] it is the Lord is day
[45:27] so if it is the Lord is there it's the
[45:29] Lord to appear but who is this Lord
[45:34] who is this Lord
[45:36] this Lord is not a selfish Lord he said
[45:39] Lord that is sharing his glory with his
[45:41] body
[45:42] and his appearing
[45:44] and he's not ashamed to be the head of a
[45:47] breasted body
[45:52] after all he's also a breasted goat
[45:56] he's the El shaddar
[45:59] glory to God
[46:02] so we see ourselves there
[46:06] before
[46:08] the 70 Church ages begin to roll before
[46:16] appear John all these all these people
[46:19] you have talked about
[46:20] talk about you know you know you know
[46:22] you know only seven judgments saying yes
[46:26] and seven Church eight years and all
[46:28] that they preached and all the years and
[46:31] before that
[46:34] the message to the church ages is being
[46:38] spoken by the head that's mounted on the
[46:42] body and that body is the church is the
[46:45] bright that's going to be gathered from
[46:47] the several Church ages and you were
[46:50] there in that body brother sister you
[46:53] were there
[46:55] and that's why you are here
[46:58] and that's why sometimes you wonder why
[47:00] it's like I'm fighting but you are not
[47:02] fighting it's like I'm giving up but
[47:03] you're not giving up and the devil is
[47:05] like yes come on you're about to make it
[47:07] according to what I want but then all of
[47:10] a sudden bang and you are a different
[47:11] person and it ever doesn't get to
[47:14] understand it
[47:16] because we're there in that body
[47:19] and when somebody begins to bring
[47:22] something that's contrary from the
[47:25] Revelation that was given to accompany
[47:28] what was the message to you it's
[47:31] something in you doesn't click
[47:33] something tells you that's wrong
[47:41] glory be to God
[47:43] so it's the Christ body the I mean the
[47:47] bride body the Christ
[47:49] speaking to the bride
[47:54] it's the bride
[47:56] part of Christ speaking a message to the
[48:00] bride
[48:02] it's the church headed by Christ
[48:05] speaking the message to the church
[48:09] so how are you going to deny it just
[48:11] like but in the beginning let us make
[48:13] man in our image who was the letters
[48:19] who are they us
[48:25] let us make man in our image
[48:28] let me go back here
[48:33] so I I'm looking at the Inseparable
[48:36] omnipotent and unfailing Union of Christ
[48:39] and the church that's my subject it is
[48:42] impossible
[48:44] brother you will not fit anywhere else
[48:48] you will never be comfortable leaving
[48:51] Jesus living the world turning against
[48:54] the word it is impossible for you you
[48:57] can't survive you are the you are made
[48:59] to be there in that body
[49:02] amen that's who you are comfortable
[49:04] wherever he takes you you go
[49:09] amen glory be to God so you you see when
[49:12] you go back to Genesis chapter one this
[49:14] is a common scripture but it we can read
[49:17] it over a million times no problem
[49:20] Genesis chapter 1 verse 26.
[49:24] and God said let us make man in our
[49:26] image
[49:29] after our likeness
[49:32] this is what blows up the minds of
[49:34] denominational people
[49:37] the theologians
[49:39] say who are this who are they us
[49:45] let's make mine in our image
[49:48] after our likeness and let them have
[49:51] dominion now he says let us make man
[49:54] singular
[49:56] and let them plural
[50:03] God is saying God not God's God said let
[50:08] us plural now God's singular
[50:12] speaks plural
[50:17] God said that is singular let us plural
[50:22] make man singular
[50:25] in our plural
[50:28] image after our likeness plural
[50:32] and let them plural
[50:36] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[50:39] and over the Falls of the air and over
[50:42] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[50:45] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[50:47] upon the Earth
[50:48] saw God not gods
[50:51] singular saw God created man singular
[50:57] in his own image singular
[51:02] in the image of God created he him
[51:05] singular male and female created he them
[51:09] plural
[51:17] so who has the letters
[51:21] you will only know the letters who are
[51:24] those when you look at the man he has
[51:26] created in His image
[51:29] hahaha
[51:32] he has created a man singular but this
[51:34] man is boss male and female
[51:37] so that means if man that is created in
[51:40] His image his boss male and female then
[51:43] he is also a male and female
[51:48] and that's why the name Elohim comes in
[51:50] a plural although it's referring to an
[51:52] individual
[51:58] so now
[52:00] who created a man
[52:03] hmm
[52:05] because these little people is referring
[52:08] to as letters
[52:15] they are different people he's going to
[52:17] create
[52:22] so who created you
[52:25] who created a man any God is image
[52:31] and whom did he tell whom did he inform
[52:33] before he created a man in his or amen
[52:36] he informed the very attributes of man
[52:38] in him he discussed with the man he told
[52:41] the man that I'm going to make man I'm
[52:43] going to make you
[52:45] I'm going to create you in my image
[52:54] Hallelujah
[52:56] I am limited friends
[52:59] finished kaput I don't have more
[53:05] let us make man you know I mean God
[53:07] speaking here to his female counterpart
[53:10] about creating man that will reflect
[53:12] their image
[53:15] so that's the reason Adam was both male
[53:17] and female in his original creation
[53:19] created in the image of God
[53:22] so
[53:25] now Jesus comes as the beginning of the
[53:28] creation the second the restoration
[53:32] of the creation that was meant to be the
[53:35] holy seed
[53:36] the seed of the woman
[53:44] and then this Jesus also
[53:49] he is bringing a message
[53:52] that is going to produce a bride but now
[53:56] before he produces this bride he is
[53:59] already with his bride and they are
[54:02] speaking the message to the bride about
[54:05] the bride by the bride together with him
[54:08] [Music]
[54:11] they are sharing the same body they are
[54:13] together
[54:14] the bride is already there complete with
[54:16] his head
[54:17] and the breasts are there
[54:19] yay
[54:27] blessed
[54:28] [Music]
[54:30] okay okay okay
[54:38] sorry minutes it wouldn't imply it would
[54:41] imply that you see in other words the
[54:44] portion of money in other words
[54:45] attributes forms in attribute form sons
[54:48] of God sons of God was over with God
[54:51] when his book of the creation of man
[54:53] this would imply that God and man spoke
[54:56] man and or created the man into
[54:58] existence so Gordon and man spoke and
[55:01] created a man into existence
[55:07] isn't it
[55:10] you just have to forget that's why the
[55:12] prophet was saying yesterday get away
[55:14] very far from yourself from your opinion
[55:16] from your thinking from just forget
[55:19] about your foolish ideas you will not
[55:21] get this just become a fool and say yes
[55:26] because it's written
[55:31] Glory oh God
[55:33] so if God said
[55:36] if God is saved
[55:38] I am the Lord that heals all thy
[55:41] diseases
[55:46] and you were with him when he said that
[55:52] in other words he told you you are going
[55:55] to be on the earth you are going to be
[55:56] in time this particular time
[55:59] and I want to assure you that you were
[56:01] there and you accepted it
[56:04] you we were in the discussion God is not
[56:06] a dictator
[56:07] even agreed with you when you are going
[56:09] to be here
[56:11] maybe where
[56:13] that's why I'm not ashamed of being in
[56:15] Africa
[56:17] being in a jungle in a village I'm
[56:19] comfortable because that's where I
[56:21] agreed I'll be there
[56:23] and I will deal with them demons I'll
[56:25] stand there and shine forth his glory
[56:28] I'm not ashamed of being what I am
[56:31] wherever I am I am supposed to be
[56:33] wherever he posted Me by his only
[56:35] spiritual I mean Supernatural
[56:38] intelligence he knew you are going to be
[56:40] here
[56:41] get it yes you are going to first ABCD
[56:44] get it yes you are going to pass through
[56:46] this trouble this temptation this
[56:48] Affliction this that you lose this you
[56:50] miss this you know you'll be fought by
[56:52] this get it yes okay now that is tough
[56:55] to swallow
[56:57] for us the word
[56:59] so you you are very wrong brother you
[57:02] are very wrong sister when you begin to
[57:04] complain about whatever you are going
[57:06] through
[57:11] in other words that's why he says
[57:15] some of them
[57:17] neither complain as we are not supposed
[57:20] to complain
[57:21] we are not supposed to Mama
[57:23] you are just going through what you went
[57:25] through
[57:27] what you agree that you'll manage and
[57:30] you promised him that you'll go through
[57:31] whatever you are going through the Bible
[57:33] says when it's beyond your capability he
[57:36] makes a way out
[57:38] [Music]
[57:40] hey
[57:42] that's a little bit tough
[57:46] but this is the word brother
[57:51] now look at what a prophet is saying
[57:53] here dear God
[57:55] the Great and Mighty God who formed all
[57:58] of things by the power of His spirit and
[58:00] has brought Jesus Christ his only
[58:02] begotten son
[58:04] who freely died for we Sinners they just
[58:07] for the the unjust reconcile us back
[58:10] into His Marvelous Fellowship that we
[58:13] have again with God
[58:17] we have again
[58:24] did you get it
[58:27] who freely died for we Sinners they just
[58:30] for the and just to reconcile us back to
[58:33] reconcile that means there was a divorce
[58:39] there was a separation
[58:43] to reconcile us back
[58:45] into this marvelous Fellowship that we
[58:49] have again
[58:51] with God as we are taught in the Blessed
[58:55] world that we had fellowship with him
[58:59] before the foundation of the world
[59:03] you see so we had the fellowship with
[59:06] him before the foundation of the world
[59:09] and then we lost it
[59:11] when the city came in and now we are
[59:14] being restored back so how did you have
[59:17] fellowship with him when where before
[59:20] the foundation of the world
[59:25] and what is going to stop you now
[59:28] when God reconciles you back how can you
[59:32] fail to have fellowship with him how can
[59:34] you fail to praise him how can you pray
[59:36] fail to thank him to worship Him how can
[59:38] you fight to serve him how can you
[59:40] freely give yourself over to him what is
[59:43] what does hinder you what can hinder you
[59:47] what devil What Spirit what impediment
[59:52] because you had it before
[59:54] the foundation of
[59:57] before there was internet
[1:00:02] before there was even an America
[1:00:04] before there was an Africa yes yes
[1:00:06] before there was a car there was an
[1:00:09] invention
[1:00:10] before you even knew there would be
[1:00:13] Clovis all these things that we are
[1:00:15] talking about employment job this a lot
[1:00:17] promotion
[1:00:21] oh
[1:00:23] man you were there before you had that
[1:00:25] fellowship before in other words it
[1:00:27] comes as a priority once it is it is
[1:00:30] restored to you you take it I said this
[1:00:33] I had before I had this before I talked
[1:00:36] with my God before I worshiped him
[1:00:38] before I lived with him before I praised
[1:00:41] him before I worshiped him before I
[1:00:43] enjoyed this presence before
[1:00:46] so I am restored back nothing can now
[1:00:48] cut me shot
[1:00:49] [Applause]
[1:00:52] okay
[1:00:53] the fellowship brother we had with him
[1:00:55] before the evolution of the world
[1:00:57] or Canal When The Morning Star Sun
[1:01:00] together
[1:01:01] for joy and the Silence of God shouted
[1:01:03] for Joy way back before the foundation
[1:01:05] of the world
[1:01:06] how do we know
[1:01:08] that that wasn't at the same time that
[1:01:11] the lamb was also slain
[1:01:14] yay belambo was also slain before the
[1:01:18] foundation of the world so Jesus didn't
[1:01:20] die 2 000 years ago
[1:01:25] I'm coming to something
[1:01:28] Jesus didn't die 2000 years ago
[1:01:31] the Lamb of God
[1:01:33] was slain
[1:01:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:01:37] that's what he Revelation 13 verse 8
[1:01:39] says
[1:01:41] and that's when your names were written
[1:01:43] in the language Book of Life
[1:01:46] because the lamp was slain before the
[1:01:48] foundation of the world and let's go
[1:01:50] here somewhere in the book of Hebrews
[1:01:52] just for a reference here when you come
[1:01:55] in the book of Hebrews
[1:01:56] chapter 4.
[1:01:58] talking about the works
[1:02:00] The Works that I do shall you do also
[1:02:03] because I got the father I'm leaving the
[1:02:05] office for you
[1:02:08] you are now the office bearers you are
[1:02:11] now the Christ you are the Messiah
[1:02:16] and in Hebrew chapter 4 verse 3
[1:02:20] he's talking about the Sabbath the rest
[1:02:22] he says for we which have believed
[1:02:26] do enter into rest as he said
[1:02:30] as
[1:02:32] I have sworn in my wrath if they shall
[1:02:36] enter into my rest
[1:02:38] now he comes down here he says although
[1:02:42] The Works were finished from the
[1:02:45] foundation of the Wild
[1:02:47] the wax were finished from the
[1:02:50] foundation of the world so don't tell me
[1:02:52] Pastor I have very bad record I have
[1:02:55] poor Works my life doesn't really you
[1:02:58] know I'm this I am that I am a failure a
[1:03:01] failure by default
[1:03:05] it's the devil that is a failure by
[1:03:07] default
[1:03:09] right
[1:03:11] The Works your works
[1:03:16] The Works that you were supposed to do
[1:03:18] yes
[1:03:18] you have already done them praise God
[1:03:21] Amen before the foundation over there
[1:03:24] wow
[1:03:25] in other words
[1:03:27] maybe I use the word rehearsal
[1:03:30] you're rehearsed in there
[1:03:37] like our friends were singing here very
[1:03:39] good song but I believe they must have
[1:03:41] had some practice
[1:03:44] they are doing like this
[1:03:51] okay
[1:03:52] they didn't just study here
[1:03:55] it was done somewhere before
[1:03:59] now this was the presentation
[1:04:03] but where was the training somewhere in
[1:04:06] the closet the presentation is the
[1:04:08] public but now the training very hassle
[1:04:11] their preparation is somewhere and then
[1:04:14] we come here we see something very nice
[1:04:20] The Works finished
[1:04:24] before the foundation of the world so
[1:04:26] now talk about your failures
[1:04:34] talk about your Temptations talk about
[1:04:37] the language of too much this is too
[1:04:39] much this is too much this is too much
[1:04:42] forget that language throw it out of
[1:04:44] your vocabulary there's nothing too much
[1:04:48] no
[1:04:49] not as fast goddess language is
[1:04:51] concerned in relationship with you no
[1:04:55] glory be to God so he says
[1:04:59] when a Morning Star sung together and
[1:05:02] the sons of God shouted for job now
[1:05:04] let's go back quickly to the Book of Job
[1:05:06] we pick this up
[1:05:13] you remember the trials the hardships
[1:05:16] the losses that a job went through
[1:05:19] and this in the permission of God
[1:05:22] is permitting job to go through that
[1:05:26] end there maybe let me use the word Baka
[1:05:29] biting they are back abiding job
[1:05:33] with the Devil and job is not informed
[1:05:41] job is not informed that you are going
[1:05:43] to be tried
[1:05:46] so try upon trial sickness loss of this
[1:05:49] loss of that children die animals die
[1:05:51] all the riches disappear and our
[1:05:53] sickness strikes the body and he's just
[1:05:56] left his wife even tells him it's more
[1:05:59] better for you to die you are worse of
[1:06:01] death they did not leave it
[1:06:08] oh
[1:06:10] the trial was exposed the weakness in
[1:06:12] the wife of the church yeah
[1:06:14] Costco
[1:06:16] but look
[1:06:21] very intellectual Brothers came
[1:06:26] with a nice quotes aligned with them
[1:06:29] against his job
[1:06:34] zofa
[1:06:39] intellectual Brothers
[1:06:42] they looked at the situation from the
[1:06:45] times point of view yes
[1:06:49] they misunderstood God and when you
[1:06:52] misunderstand God you misunderstand
[1:06:54] God's children
[1:06:58] so they begin to say you are essay a
[1:07:00] sacred sinner this cannot happen God
[1:07:02] cannot really that and just cannot be
[1:07:05] that and just to permit this to happen
[1:07:06] to you impossible brother you
[1:07:09] they speak
[1:07:11] they speak chapters
[1:07:13] chapter after chapter chapter
[1:07:16] but job lost all the strength
[1:07:20] could not maybe stunned could not maybe
[1:07:22] even walk but God anointed the mouth the
[1:07:25] man could speak
[1:07:27] they speak he speaks they speak he
[1:07:29] speaks they speak the answers to they
[1:07:33] speak one the answers too
[1:07:35] one man against three until time become
[1:07:38] they became quiet
[1:07:40] and then he comes
[1:07:43] the minister of William Branham
[1:07:46] okay that introduces God himself
[1:07:51] speaks and then God comes down himself
[1:07:54] and addresses begins to address job
[1:07:57] now let's see in the in Job chapter 38
[1:08:00] then the Lord verse 1. answer the job
[1:08:04] out of the Halloween and said who is
[1:08:07] this
[1:08:08] that Darkness cancel
[1:08:10] by words without knowledge
[1:08:14] now if you are careful he is not really
[1:08:17] the addressing job
[1:08:23] because he's reminding job that we had
[1:08:26] the council
[1:08:27] we had good counsel
[1:08:30] with you we talked about this we agreed
[1:08:33] about this but there is a spirit that
[1:08:36] they have come to darken
[1:08:38] the council
[1:08:43] and he says
[1:08:47] get up now
[1:08:50] loins like a man
[1:08:57] and I will demand of Thee
[1:08:59] and answer them
[1:09:01] where where was thou when I lay the
[1:09:04] foundation of the Earth
[1:09:06] declare if you have understanding
[1:09:08] who has laid officials thereof
[1:09:12] if thou knowest or who has stretched
[1:09:16] the line upon it whereupon whereupon are
[1:09:21] the foundations of the I mean
[1:09:23] foundations they are fasting
[1:09:26] oh who laid the Cornerstone thereof when
[1:09:29] this the morning Stars sung together
[1:09:35] and all
[1:09:37] the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:09:41] so you mean to tell me that the job was
[1:09:43] not in that number
[1:09:45] he was there
[1:09:49] amen but he had forgotten
[1:09:53] what he did
[1:09:56] and he had he permitted the devil to
[1:09:58] come and darken that Guru Council
[1:10:02] the council in heaven
[1:10:05] that he talked with God and agreed to
[1:10:08] pass through this
[1:10:13] the Devil comes and darkens you up
[1:10:16] and who tries to stain you
[1:10:18] to disorient you
[1:10:22] to take you from the right Focus
[1:10:24] from the right fixation
[1:10:27] and begins to make you act as if you are
[1:10:29] not a believer
[1:10:31] but as far as God is concerned you are
[1:10:34] not lost
[1:10:35] it doesn't matter how how many words you
[1:10:38] are going to speak
[1:10:40] God also in his foreign
[1:10:56] when you get into the fellowship brother
[1:10:58] that original Fellowship your complaints
[1:11:02] your arguments your reasonings when he
[1:11:06] comes when you are restored back
[1:11:09] to that body where you were when the
[1:11:13] world was spoken and you were part of
[1:11:15] the speaking body that spoke of the word
[1:11:17] and you come in Fellowship again all
[1:11:20] these complaints disappear now if you
[1:11:23] come God speaks and speaks and speaks
[1:11:25] and when you come here in chapter 47
[1:11:30] job is answering
[1:11:36] and how is he going to answer
[1:11:38] listen Mr God I'm going to present my
[1:11:40] needs to you and my complaint and you
[1:11:43] have to tell me why you permitted me to
[1:11:45] suffer
[1:11:47] as I have been crying you have answered
[1:11:50] my needs you have come now please sit
[1:11:52] down also and stand as God Mr God in
[1:11:56] your glory in your wisdom and answer me
[1:11:58] back no
[1:12:01] he says then job
[1:12:04] answer to the Lord
[1:12:07] and he said I know that thou comes to do
[1:12:10] everything
[1:12:13] and at no thought can be withheld hot
[1:12:17] withhold him from thee
[1:12:21] and now he comes and says who is he that
[1:12:25] hide this cancer without knowledge
[1:12:29] so he is asking who is this one that
[1:12:33] came and hid constant
[1:12:35] from me
[1:12:38] the counsel that I knew
[1:12:42] was hidden from me
[1:12:47] without knowledge what's the knowledge
[1:12:50] to know God
[1:12:53] he had the only God but now the devil
[1:12:56] has come and stolen it and hidden it
[1:13:01] and then he says
[1:13:03] therefore why why therefore because
[1:13:06] somebody came the devil came the devil
[1:13:09] came and stood and stolen Hadid my
[1:13:13] knowledge
[1:13:14] he did my in the council that I had
[1:13:17] known
[1:13:18] it was hidden from me and that's why he
[1:13:22] says therefore have I uttered that which
[1:13:26] I understood not things do wonderful for
[1:13:30] me which I knew not
[1:13:33] in other words the words of complaint
[1:13:36] murmuring saying this is too much I wish
[1:13:39] I admitted that God that was wonderful
[1:13:41] that was too strange language for job it
[1:13:46] was not supposed to be part of his
[1:13:47] vocabulary
[1:13:50] not questioning God why why God why why
[1:13:53] God why me why my family why me always
[1:14:02] who else
[1:14:04] why am I the one all the criticism all
[1:14:07] the abuses all the targets are if it's
[1:14:09] the sickness if it is this if it is this
[1:14:12] if it is hatred people everywhere ahead
[1:14:14] to me I have no favor so which flavor do
[1:14:17] you want which which is above the favor
[1:14:19] that God gave you
[1:14:24] his favor is more than any other flavor
[1:14:29] amen and the Bible says woe unto you you
[1:14:31] follow men speak well about you because
[1:14:33] they only spoke good about fellows
[1:14:35] prophets so if you want to be spoken
[1:14:37] well off then become a false prophet
[1:14:39] which you can't
[1:14:44] now it is impossible
[1:14:47] you will not
[1:14:49] and as long as you are preaching the
[1:14:51] truth they will hate you they will speak
[1:14:53] about you they remember all sorts of
[1:14:55] insults
[1:14:57] they'll look for something to criticize
[1:14:59] and there is a lot about us to criticize
[1:15:02] that's what the prophet said if you come
[1:15:04] even to church like this looking for
[1:15:05] something to criticize you'll find a lot
[1:15:07] of it
[1:15:08] Jesus
[1:15:17] so job is answering
[1:15:19] he says somebody the devil came and hid
[1:15:22] the council
[1:15:25] and I remained without knowledge
[1:15:27] therefore I have spoken of uttered the
[1:15:29] things that are too complicated things
[1:15:31] that I could not even understand
[1:15:33] things that are too wonderful for me I
[1:15:36] am even beginning to Marvel how I spoke
[1:15:38] on this world I'm wondering am I even
[1:15:41] the one who spoke of this
[1:15:43] how did it come that I spoke of this how
[1:15:46] did it come that I behaved like this how
[1:15:49] did it come that I even quarreled you
[1:15:50] with my life and I told her I think I
[1:15:52] made the wrong woman
[1:15:54] how did I say that
[1:16:01] she's your wife
[1:16:04] this business of casting around you
[1:16:07] reach entertainment you see the
[1:16:08] foolishness out of say what happened
[1:16:10] am I the one who spoke those words
[1:16:14] how did I speak
[1:16:17] am I the one who questioned the
[1:16:18] authority of my relationship with God
[1:16:21] whether I'm an elect or not whether God
[1:16:24] loves me or not whether I'm the foolish
[1:16:26] virgin or the truth the Wise One whether
[1:16:28] I'm going in Rapture or not how did
[1:16:30] those questions even come
[1:16:33] why did I step on the other negative
[1:16:35] side
[1:16:38] how did it happen I spoke of volumes and
[1:16:41] job must have gone back
[1:16:43] somebody must have been available you
[1:16:46] know writing and he must have looked at
[1:16:48] what he spoke how he challenged how he
[1:16:50] defended his Integrity defended his
[1:16:53] Holiness I am a good man I am like this
[1:16:57] I was telling some brothers it is very
[1:17:00] common these days when you say God bless
[1:17:02] God bless you how are you I'm good I
[1:17:04] said that's a lie
[1:17:06] we love that but he said lie of the end
[1:17:09] of time
[1:17:10] who told you that you are good
[1:17:15] Jesus said no man is good
[1:17:18] he even denied it himself why do you
[1:17:20] call me good
[1:17:22] but he said it's a very good thing I am
[1:17:24] good
[1:17:25] very very common how are you brother I'm
[1:17:27] good
[1:17:32] like like like I was talking with some
[1:17:34] friends somewhere and you know these
[1:17:36] days even to say I'm sorry people don't
[1:17:38] want to say I'm sorry they say my bad
[1:17:45] hey
[1:17:47] to look modern to sound like I'm not a
[1:17:50] project I'm
[1:17:52] it is military to to tell a phenomena
[1:17:55] I'm sorry
[1:17:57] so I'm glad my bad
[1:17:59] whatever if it is
[1:18:02] b-i-r-d-o-b-a-i b a b i don't mean I
[1:18:05] don't understand what you're meaning by
[1:18:07] my bird
[1:18:13] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:18:16] you even forget your language
[1:18:19] repentance is a language of a believer
[1:18:22] it's very easy to come out of the
[1:18:24] problem by saying Dear Honey forgive me
[1:18:29] I'm sorry
[1:18:31] instead of a dream and it's chewing and
[1:18:33] throwning and closing your eyes and
[1:18:36] banging the plates down and checking
[1:18:39] around and you become do you know when
[1:18:40] you are annoyed you become more heavy
[1:18:43] you boom boom boom boom you move around
[1:18:46] because demons are full of you and you
[1:18:48] are full of demons and then you are you
[1:18:50] are banging the ground like like is
[1:18:52] there an elephant passing around
[1:18:59] that's not your language your language
[1:19:02] is not right you it's not even to defend
[1:19:04] yourself
[1:19:06] the Bible says why would you not rather
[1:19:08] I accept
[1:19:10] to be to to be to be defrosted why don't
[1:19:15] even accept they're wrong
[1:19:18] it's either a bonus if you repent for
[1:19:21] something that you know you have not
[1:19:22] even done
[1:19:25] that's Christian
[1:19:27] that's the language of Heaven
[1:19:30] I'm sorry forgive me
[1:19:33] instead of valuing hey he's the one who
[1:19:36] say this no I speak as a Christian
[1:19:38] Pastor he's the one who said it is she I
[1:19:41] would have said this if she didn't say
[1:19:43] this she said this that's why I also
[1:19:45] said it is
[1:19:48] that's an Christian that was not there
[1:19:55] the attributes there when you were in
[1:19:57] God
[1:20:00] where did you get this
[1:20:03] it is a must
[1:20:05] because this Stone which was cut out
[1:20:08] from the original Rock was thrown here
[1:20:11] and now it's been dormant there and the
[1:20:13] Moss has gathered on it and it thinks
[1:20:16] I'm a Mr Green when he's such a white
[1:20:18] one
[1:20:22] oh
[1:20:25] let me hold everything and rush to
[1:20:27] Isaiah chapter 51.
[1:20:29] so that you get a picture of what I'm
[1:20:30] talking about
[1:20:32] Isaiah chapter 51 verse 1 he says second
[1:20:34] to me ye that follow righteousness
[1:20:38] ye that seek the Lord look at the Rock
[1:20:43] once you were healed
[1:20:46] and to the whole of the pit once you are
[1:20:50] digged
[1:20:54] so they you are here as a rock a small
[1:20:58] Stone a small rock cast from the major
[1:21:01] Rock and that rock is Christ
[1:21:05] that is God himself the word
[1:21:08] and anyone here but because you are
[1:21:10] thrown in time a lot of noise gathered
[1:21:13] around you
[1:21:15] and now when you look back the hall
[1:21:17] where they cut you you didn't even you
[1:21:19] don't even freak
[1:21:20] because you have a lot of additions on
[1:21:23] you graph
[1:21:27] things that were not there when they
[1:21:29] were cutting you but because you have
[1:21:30] stayed here
[1:21:32] climate and moisture and so forth has
[1:21:34] taken his toll on you there's some
[1:21:37] additions on you that were not there
[1:21:41] so compare yourself with that whole can
[1:21:43] you fit no then that means it's time to
[1:21:45] scrape you now
[1:21:47] time to be scrapped
[1:21:51] and to be washed and then they will fit
[1:21:53] you back
[1:21:57] because you're forgotten you think this
[1:21:59] is where you belong you think the most
[1:22:01] is your god your government
[1:22:07] your government is not Moss
[1:22:10] you are not an American to speak like an
[1:22:12] American American language American
[1:22:14] attitude and blah blah blah
[1:22:17] you're a Christian you are you're an
[1:22:20] attribute of God and we are
[1:22:21] fellowshipping here because we are the
[1:22:23] fellowship it's the fellowship of
[1:22:24] attribute
[1:22:26] it's not the Fellowship of the right
[1:22:28] hand The Fellowship of the right hand is
[1:22:30] hypocritical God bless you brother God
[1:22:32] bless you but it down in his heart he
[1:22:33] doesn't even love you God bless you God
[1:22:35] bless you God bless you
[1:22:38] That's The Fellowship of the right hand
[1:22:41] Paul says they gave him the right hand
[1:22:43] of Fellowship because they were not
[1:22:45] believing his Gospel of circumcision and
[1:22:47] his circumcision they were holding on
[1:22:49] circumcision so they just gave him the
[1:22:50] right hand of Fellowship
[1:22:53] brother
[1:22:54] when we meet each other's Brothers but I
[1:22:57] don't agree with you but they were
[1:22:59] refusing to agree with the Revelation
[1:23:00] that was God they had given them
[1:23:02] Messenger to the egg
[1:23:04] they were sticking to all the Orthodox
[1:23:07] rules of circumcision and trying to look
[1:23:09] good among the Jews
[1:23:13] so they preach a produ produced gospel
[1:23:18] and that's why Paul rebuked the Peter
[1:23:21] Peter was trying to still hold on until
[1:23:23] those all the traditions and garages of
[1:23:25] the Israelites to appease and Paula
[1:23:29] first to him he said well anyway private
[1:23:30] you ate with the Gentiles now when we
[1:23:32] are in public we are hiding
[1:23:34] ah
[1:23:37] Paulo became a problem
[1:23:40] but it became a problem because Paul was
[1:23:42] saying all that was gained to me all
[1:23:44] that the reputation I had all the good
[1:23:46] words they were speaking about me
[1:23:48] everything about the game I I just
[1:23:50] counted it as done
[1:23:51] the most I cut it off
[1:23:55] I told Jesus to scrape it off
[1:23:58] that I mean we remove him
[1:24:02] so where were you and the job is saying
[1:24:05] how is he concluding now he says
[1:24:14] in verse 5 of chapter 42. he says I have
[1:24:19] heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear
[1:24:24] but now my eye sees you
[1:24:30] that's the Christ we're talking about
[1:24:32] yesterday Christ that can be felt
[1:24:35] embraced
[1:24:39] and sin
[1:24:42] and he says wherefore
[1:24:46] I abide myself and repent in the dust
[1:24:49] and his ashes so job repents
[1:24:54] no more reason
[1:24:57] he's connected back to the original
[1:25:02] praise God
[1:25:04] now the prophet continues here he says
[1:25:07] tonight we have only got a fortress of
[1:25:09] that Glory that great Glory Divine which
[1:25:12] shall be revealed at his coming second
[1:25:13] coming all sickness and sorrow shall be
[1:25:15] done away with then we will have a body
[1:25:18] like his own glorious body we shall see
[1:25:20] him as he is now come here he says
[1:25:31] and then Christ died to save those
[1:25:34] who by God
[1:25:36] by far knowledge elected to meet
[1:25:40] before the foundation of the world he's
[1:25:43] seen you in glory
[1:25:45] before the foundation of the world you
[1:25:48] were with him in the glory and he saw
[1:25:50] you in glory again
[1:25:57] now if God did that predestinated us
[1:26:00] before the fullness of the world he knew
[1:26:02] every one of us by name before the
[1:26:04] foundation of the world and elected us
[1:26:05] to eternal life and send Jesus Christ to
[1:26:07] redeem us that 6 000 years ago he saw us
[1:26:11] that he might appear to his prayer that
[1:26:13] he might have that we might appear to
[1:26:15] his Praises in glory how can you ever be
[1:26:18] lost
[1:26:21] now if you are saved you are saved if
[1:26:25] God Saves you tonight knowing he's going
[1:26:27] to lose you 10 years from today he's
[1:26:29] defeating his only purpose the infinite
[1:26:32] Almighty internal Everlasting wisdom God
[1:26:36] doesn't know that that
[1:26:40] I mean he doesn't know enough then to
[1:26:42] know whether you hold out hold out or
[1:26:45] whatever you want that means if God was
[1:26:48] to save you anointing it's like a try
[1:26:50] and error kind of business
[1:26:52] then that means that he didn't know
[1:26:54] enough
[1:26:59] glory to God and when you also begin to
[1:27:02] doubt your salvation that means you are
[1:27:04] trying to think to insinuate that God
[1:27:07] doesn't know enough he didn't know you
[1:27:09] enough he didn't know enough about the
[1:27:12] trials that you are going to face about
[1:27:14] the sicknesses that are going to come
[1:27:15] your way about the Temptations He didn't
[1:27:18] I I if he knew me wouldn't have called
[1:27:20] me I think he didn't look at what is
[1:27:23] coming that's what we are trying to
[1:27:24] listen
[1:27:26] but that's not a reality you're just
[1:27:28] using your mind
[1:27:30] that's spiritual amnesia
[1:27:33] but God will Overlook all that and still
[1:27:36] get you
[1:27:37] he knows how to do it
[1:27:39] Glory Be oh God
[1:27:41] now
[1:27:43] let me come to something here I want to
[1:27:45] you know to finish here when you come
[1:27:48] here in this court
[1:28:03] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:28:09] he's talking about let us go back to the
[1:28:12] ministry of brother Branham
[1:28:15] and see what's back to him
[1:28:20] from denominational you see
[1:28:23] to the experiencing of God
[1:28:27] let around the station let alone the
[1:28:29] visitation of the angel
[1:28:32] many times you remember he said I call
[1:28:34] you but you do not I call you but you
[1:28:36] would not he kept resisting the call of
[1:28:38] God but now listen he had that Baptist
[1:28:41] culture around him the most
[1:28:50] and here he comes and speaks about it in
[1:28:53] a message here we have no continuing
[1:28:55] system
[1:28:56] he says and the only fellows standing
[1:28:59] there you know and all the ministers
[1:29:01] that they had been preaching on what
[1:29:03] Jesus done and so forth
[1:29:06] but he never taken he took his text from
[1:29:09] over in a job somewhere there where he
[1:29:12] said where were you when I lay the
[1:29:15] foundations of the world
[1:29:16] When The Morning Star sung together
[1:29:19] and and sons of God shouted for joy
[1:29:24] well
[1:29:25] we are the ministers
[1:29:28] was bringing the activities of the
[1:29:30] church on the Earth
[1:29:35] walks on Earth
[1:29:38] what you do on Earth
[1:29:40] brings it
[1:29:42] whereas the other ministers were
[1:29:44] preaching about the works the activities
[1:29:47] of the church on Earth
[1:29:50] he went up into the heavens
[1:29:58] about 10 million years before the world
[1:30:01] was ever formed
[1:30:04] and he came down the horizontal rainbow
[1:30:07] with him
[1:30:09] and about that time listen
[1:30:12] he got down he there he let out a great
[1:30:17] big hoop
[1:30:19] and he jumped up and he clicked his
[1:30:22] heels together and remember this was a
[1:30:25] very old man with stupid shoulders and
[1:30:28] the prophet pitted him he said why these
[1:30:31] people could not even sympathize with
[1:30:33] this old man sending him to the palpit
[1:30:36] to preach with a bent back
[1:30:38] and moving around and and then he
[1:30:41] started but now when he went to connect
[1:30:45] back
[1:30:48] I wanted you to look at that when this
[1:30:51] old man connected to where he was
[1:30:54] not where we are
[1:30:56] they asked what I have done I am a
[1:30:59] dotted man I am a sinner I've made a lot
[1:31:01] of mistakes I'm a failure I am this I am
[1:31:04] that people don't like me I think I'm I
[1:31:07] have a problem I I don't succeed I am
[1:31:10] go back
[1:31:12] so when this man went to connect back he
[1:31:16] came back and he came he let out a very
[1:31:18] big whoop he said whoopee
[1:31:21] you got no room for me here to preach
[1:31:24] [Applause]
[1:31:26] ah
[1:31:29] he
[1:31:30] he jumped up and clipped his heels
[1:31:33] together and said glory to God you ain't
[1:31:36] got no room enough here up here for me
[1:31:39] to preach
[1:31:42] what clicked in that holy man
[1:31:46] he connected to that life he connected
[1:31:49] to that reality he connected what we
[1:31:52] were before time
[1:31:56] and what is going to make us strong
[1:32:00] resilient Victorious
[1:32:03] faithful
[1:32:05] Victorious moving forward not looking at
[1:32:09] this
[1:32:10] not looking at your history not looking
[1:32:13] at what people what surrounds you not
[1:32:15] looking at your weaknesses but going way
[1:32:18] back connecting to internity
[1:32:24] and listen what a problem the prophet
[1:32:25] says
[1:32:26] he says Glory oh God you ain't got
[1:32:29] enough room up here for me to preach and
[1:32:31] then the prophet says I looked at that
[1:32:33] and I said well if that will make an old
[1:32:36] man like that act like that
[1:32:38] [Applause]
[1:32:41] what would it do to me if I got some of
[1:32:45] it
[1:32:45] what do you want to do if I got some of
[1:32:48] it
[1:32:49] I said I want some of that
[1:32:52] that's what I want if it can make an old
[1:32:55] man like that act like that what would
[1:32:57] it do for me
[1:33:02] listen he brings it from another angle
[1:33:05] this holy preacher come out to preach he
[1:33:08] said
[1:33:09] was going to preach the message that
[1:33:10] night and they all the fellow came out
[1:33:12] and I thought poor old brother he was
[1:33:15] all just crippled up like this
[1:33:18] he come out and he took his text from
[1:33:21] over I believe in Job chapter seven or
[1:33:23] something somewhere there and when where
[1:33:25] where where were you when I lay the
[1:33:27] foundations of the world said he when
[1:33:30] this morning star sang together and sons
[1:33:32] of God shouted for Joy now listen and
[1:33:36] instead of preaching what he would have
[1:33:38] been done what would what he would have
[1:33:41] done here on Earth
[1:33:44] yeah
[1:33:45] he took him up back ayonda about 10 000
[1:33:49] years before the world was ever formed
[1:33:51] and brought him down across through the
[1:33:54] skies and come down the horizontal
[1:33:56] rainbow back Yonder into internet and
[1:33:59] when that old fellow get got anointed
[1:34:02] where did he get the anointing
[1:34:08] not from here not from the preachers
[1:34:11] here not from what others comparing
[1:34:14] notes with what others are preaching
[1:34:17] am I right am I wrong I actually compare
[1:34:20] with brother so and so preacher so and
[1:34:22] so no but going back to connect
[1:34:26] connect to what you will what you did

[1:34:32] foundation of the world the summons that

[1:35:41] a church today there is a people today
[1:35:43] that will live such a life that will
[1:35:45] make the devil find what to do with them

[1:35:51] what to do with you because he doesn't
[1:35:53] know where you're drawing your
[1:35:54] inspiration from
[1:35:56] you are not drawing it from the
[1:35:58] surrounding it's not because you have a
[1:35:59] comfortable back account not because you

[1:36:03] good house and because you are
[1:36:05] surrounded with friends not because

[1:41:11] when I pray for the sick by for the
[1:41:13] Demonic possessed and those people who
[1:41:15] are cruel and terrible I don't even ask
[1:41:17] someone's company
[1:41:19] because I don't even need a person
[1:41:21] I don't know whether he was there or not
[1:41:24] and I don't know whether he has plugged
[1:41:26] him there or not
[1:41:29] I know when I plug her there
[1:41:32] I can deal with anything
[1:41:35] it's not me
[1:41:37] it's not me
[1:41:39] It's the final blood of Christ here like
[1:41:42] we were saying yesterday
[1:41:44] I just created a vacancy
[1:41:47] and he invited him come well here
[1:41:51] continue with your plans
[1:41:53] continue with your works The Works that
[1:41:56] were finished
[1:41:57] before the foundation of the world I am
[1:42:01] you see when you go on the stage when
[1:42:03] you have practiced enough
[1:42:06] you have rehearsed
[1:42:08] you are not scared
[1:42:11] with my little experience with the
[1:42:13] guitar if I mean to pick it now and sit
[1:42:16] somewhere I can close my eyes and sing a
[1:42:19] song
[1:42:20] I don't have to keep looking at my
[1:42:22] fingers
[1:42:24] I have that experience
[1:42:32] so if you are experiencing him
[1:42:37] all that even what Jesus did you were in
[1:42:40] Jesus
[1:42:44] you already have enough experience
[1:42:48] and enough power
[1:42:51] and then have authority
[1:42:55] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:42:59] glory to God
[1:43:01] this is what the prophet is saying
[1:43:04] so God
[1:43:07] also orders all of us look back
[1:43:11] why do should we look back
[1:43:14] you know what did Jesus said
[1:43:16] Jesus also reminded the disciples
[1:43:19] so have you even forgotten you're
[1:43:22] complaining about great
[1:43:24] the five pieces of bread
[1:43:26] how many people afraid by it five
[1:43:28] thousand
[1:43:29] how many basketballs do you pick
[1:43:33] so much what about this one are you so
[1:43:36] forgetful
[1:43:42] um
[1:43:43] blessed be the name of the Lord we are
[1:43:46] not supposed to be forgetful
[1:43:48] look at somewhere first Samuel chapter 7
[1:43:51] 17.
[1:43:54] David
[1:43:57] goes back
[1:44:00] to The Testament
[1:44:02] when he's first with Goliath and he's
[1:44:05] challenged let's read it
[1:44:08] let's see as I finish here
[1:44:13] first Samuel chapter 17.
[1:44:17] they see from us that verse 33.
[1:44:21] and Saul said to David
[1:44:23] thou are not able to go against this
[1:44:25] Philistine to fight with him
[1:44:28] for thou art that I use and he a man of
[1:44:33] war from his youth that is contradictory
[1:44:37] he is what he is because he was a
[1:44:39] Warrior from the youth and for me you
[1:44:40] don't want me to fight from my youth
[1:44:46] you are discouraging me because I'm a
[1:44:48] youth and for him is what he is because
[1:44:51] he started fighting from his youth
[1:44:53] so I should also start my career when
[1:44:55] I'm here
[1:45:00] ever started for he says and everything
[1:45:02] say that so thy servant kept his
[1:45:05] father's ship testimony now
[1:45:12] and took a lamb out of the floor and I
[1:45:15] went out after him and smore him and
[1:45:17] delivered it out of his mouth and when
[1:45:20] he arose against me I call him by his
[1:45:23] beard smart him and flew him
[1:45:27] you think it was that younger David
[1:45:33] he's using the word I
[1:45:35] but it was the anointing in the David
[1:45:40] he was already anointed king
[1:45:44] he has made us Kings and Priests
[1:45:47] so you have the confidence that if I'm
[1:45:49] already sanctioned kept preserved
[1:45:52] protected
[1:45:55] what will the devil do to me
[1:45:59] so he says I killed it
[1:46:03] then verse 35. thy servant I mean it's
[1:46:06] other six
[1:46:07] the seven salute boss The Lion and the
[1:46:10] Bear
[1:46:11] and this uncircumcised the Philistine
[1:46:13] shall be as one of them
[1:46:16] seeing he has defied the armies of the
[1:46:19] Living God
[1:46:21] why is David going back
[1:46:26] you know when the ship have you ever
[1:46:28] seen a ram
[1:46:29] when it's going to fight
[1:46:32] it goes back
[1:46:41] say come on let me know
[1:46:44] let me come from somewhere
[1:46:50] and let me gain momentum
[1:46:55] and he comes with a lot of force
[1:47:00] it doesn't hit you from there
[1:47:04] when you provoke it let me go back to
[1:47:07] the holy testimonial archives
[1:47:10] [Applause]
[1:47:12] the god that did this for me the god
[1:47:15] that delivered me from this
[1:47:18] is here
[1:47:22] that is the nature of sheep
[1:47:24] but the stubborn gods are the ones that
[1:47:26] begin from the very place
[1:47:35] those are good
[1:47:37] you are playing with me you don't know
[1:47:39] me I can hit you hey
[1:47:46] the gods always look at where they are
[1:47:49] standing and they just lift up their
[1:47:51] health is in Prestige and pride so you
[1:47:54] are joking you don't know me
[1:47:59] but if God ever made a mistake to fight
[1:48:02] with the ram he's going to die
[1:48:06] because he will be there in a safe place
[1:48:08] like this
[1:48:09] and then the realm will go back
[1:48:12] let me connect back to the power plug
[1:48:15] [Applause]
[1:48:19] and then it comes
[1:48:22] and hits it
[1:48:24] that'll be the end
[1:48:29] so that's our nature
[1:48:31] as the Sheep of God Amen amen we go
[1:48:34] backwards
[1:48:39] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:48:42] today and forever
[1:48:45] we're only beginning with tomorrow
[1:48:49] we begin with what he was yesterday
[1:48:52] what he was he is and what he is he will
[1:48:55] be
[1:49:00] blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:49:01] that's why today
[1:49:03] there must be a Christ here
[1:49:10] after the message has been completed to
[1:49:12] the seven Church ages now that full
[1:49:15] bride again appears
[1:49:19] the same bright body
[1:49:22] that spoke with the head of Christ or oh
[1:49:27] it's the same one that's why you see the
[1:49:30] head of Christ appearing in the cloud
[1:49:32] the reason the devil doesn't he wants
[1:49:35] that one
[1:49:35] hey
[1:49:38] doesn't want that club
[1:49:43] because he was coming to unite
[1:49:47] and to seven angels the world receives a
[1:49:50] cloud and the bride sees the head
[1:49:54] seven angels forming the head
[1:49:58] what is the head the intelligence here
[1:50:02] the mouth
[1:50:04] uniting with the body
[1:50:06] and brother was caught up
[1:50:09] in a blast and he was lifted up to meet
[1:50:12] those angels then otherwise he was
[1:50:14] caught up to put on the headship
[1:50:16] that head in order to speak the
[1:50:18] Mysteries speak to who
[1:50:21] why was he caught up
[1:50:25] because he was just introducing that
[1:50:27] head to the real owner the full one
[1:50:30] the bride Jesus the bride of Christ is
[1:50:33] here
[1:50:34] that's why he says behold the bridegroom
[1:50:36] I no longer caller you Church you are
[1:50:39] now bride
[1:50:41] Mrs Jesus because the head plus the body
[1:50:45] will identified
[1:50:48] same Authority that spoke on the message
[1:50:52] is the same Authority that is receiving
[1:50:54] the message
[1:50:56] and on behalf of the body so who eats
[1:50:59] who eats says go and take the book
[1:51:03] you go and take the book you are the
[1:51:05] body you are the hand take the book but
[1:51:07] who is eating the book
[1:51:10] amen the head is eating the book and who
[1:51:13] is the head
[1:51:15] the head is Christ
[1:51:17] the body is picking the food the book
[1:51:19] and the head is eating the book on
[1:51:22] behalf of the body
[1:51:26] so it's Christ himself receiving his own
[1:51:29] word
[1:51:30] in his bride is Christ himself believing
[1:51:33] his word
[1:51:37] and that's why it's impossible for this
[1:51:40] bride to fail
[1:51:44] just go back
[1:51:46] to what you weigh
[1:51:48] and connect back you are going to look
[1:51:50] for more room
[1:51:52] say give me room now I want to give me
[1:51:55] some devils to tackle give me some
[1:51:57] problems here now where are they where
[1:52:00] are they
[1:52:01] that's where we are coming that's where
[1:52:03] I am I don't want to die I want to say
[1:52:06] like David I shall not die but I shall
[1:52:09] live and declare the works of the Lord I
[1:52:12] shall not die but declare the works of
[1:52:15] Messiah The Works of Jesus Christ
[1:52:17] in the body in the bright body is here
[1:52:23] advice
[1:52:25] I don't want to run away from this wall
[1:52:27] as a coward
[1:52:28] has a failure
[1:52:32] and I don't know how to take contentment
[1:52:34] from others that what I've what I've
[1:52:37] seen done
[1:52:39] I want to serve him until he when he
[1:52:43] pleases to take me home or if it is the
[1:52:46] rapture wonderful
[1:52:49] so I will just hear briefly to encourage
[1:52:51] you friends
[1:52:53] that don't you ever let the devil
[1:52:56] deceive you that you are a failure
[1:52:59] don't you ever believe the devil's lie
[1:53:02] that this message is too hard
[1:53:05] you are the one who spoke it together
[1:53:07] with him
[1:53:11] so how can you doubt what you spoke
[1:53:15] you are that pretty steady person there
[1:53:19] you are not blessed anybody
[1:53:21] [Laughter]
[1:53:24] Christ
[1:53:25] in the bright body
[1:53:28] speaking to his bride
[1:53:31] and the remaining in his bride and
[1:53:35] performing it in his bride and
[1:53:38] manifesting it and leaving it showing
[1:53:41] his glory in his bride so how can Christ
[1:53:44] fail
[1:53:46] he may be sure this time there is no
[1:53:48] failure room there's no room for failure
[1:53:52] he made Yeshua
[1:53:53] I'm sure for that there's not going to
[1:53:56] be a failure unless you were not there
[1:54:00] but if you were there you are going to
[1:54:02] make it may God bless you
[1:54:06] let's stand up
[1:54:07] [Applause]
[1:54:16] let's pray
[1:54:18] maybe you want to be remembered in a
[1:54:20] prayer for whatever reason
[1:54:22] you know the reason
[1:54:25] but there's a lot that you can ask him
[1:54:27] for
[1:54:29] as we go to pray
[1:54:32] just humble yourself believe in your
[1:54:34] heart and lift up your hand let's pray
[1:54:37] Heavenly Father
[1:54:40] what a Time
[1:54:42] what a glorious message
[1:54:44] what are special people a specified
[1:54:48] message
[1:54:50] classified
[1:54:53] for classified people
[1:54:56] and we are here Lord
[1:54:59] what shall we say
[1:55:01] how can we even mama how can we even
[1:55:04] complain how can we even say I can't
[1:55:07] manage
[1:55:09] when we were with you
[1:55:12] speaking forth this message
[1:55:15] we were that breasted body
[1:55:18] that held your head that carried your
[1:55:21] head
[1:55:23] and you said in your word and if I'll be
[1:55:26] lifted up
[1:55:27] I'll draw all men unto me
[1:55:30] we just want to lift you up we want to
[1:55:32] be the body
[1:55:34] so that you're the head
[1:55:36] and let God
[1:55:38] whatever you spoke you've come and eaten
[1:55:42] it yourself the book
[1:55:44] that you commanded John to go and take
[1:55:47] and eat
[1:55:49] who is eating it yourself
[1:55:52] that's why there is sweetness in the
[1:55:54] mouth
[1:55:55] because the mouth cannot experience
[1:55:58] bitterness since it's the one that's
[1:56:00] pocket
[1:56:02] it's only the digestion in the body in
[1:56:05] the church
[1:56:06] that appears bitter
[1:56:08] but Lord once it has entered the
[1:56:11] digestive system
[1:56:13] how we will it ever come out you the
[1:56:16] mouth will never allow us to vomit it
[1:56:21] the tables are full of vomit for those
[1:56:25] who are not part of the body
[1:56:28] but this table here yes cannot be having
[1:56:31] any vomit
[1:56:33] because everything that is eaten is
[1:56:35] eaten by you
[1:56:37] and it's kept by you is guaranteed that
[1:56:39] it cannot come out
[1:56:41] help us Lord
[1:56:44] that we come to this hour boldly to
[1:56:48] prophesy again
[1:56:52] full of that anointing
[1:56:55] connected back to what we were in
[1:56:58] eternity
[1:56:59] and knowing that the devil doesn't want
[1:57:01] us to recognize that bad
[1:57:03] you don't even seek the devil's
[1:57:05] permission when you want to reveal
[1:57:06] yourself to us
[1:57:08] you didn't even seek the devil's
[1:57:09] permission when you saved us when you
[1:57:11] called us and you are not going to seek
[1:57:13] the devil's permission to manifest
[1:57:15] yourself in US
[1:57:16] to prove your word
[1:57:18] to redo the works that were finished
[1:57:21] before the foundation of the world and
[1:57:23] you are doing them using the hands of
[1:57:25] the body and the body is your bride
[1:57:28] Lord I'm praying that you'll help us
[1:57:30] and the Lord
[1:57:33] you are anointed to come
[1:57:35] and then girlfriend swallow and stop you
[1:57:37] everybody here
[1:57:39] Lord at every disease every every pain
[1:57:42] every ailment every negative spirit will
[1:57:45] be defeated in the name of Jesus and the
[1:57:47] Lord called your power will come you are
[1:57:51] Glory you will be shared you said it
[1:57:55] because Jesus Jesus yourself you said
[1:57:57] one time
[1:57:58] glorify me with the glory that I had
[1:58:01] with you
[1:58:02] before the world began
[1:58:04] and it is thundered and our Lord God the
[1:58:08] father was saying have both glorified it
[1:58:11] and I'll glorify again
[1:58:15] this is the time for the second
[1:58:16] glorification may you glorify
[1:58:20] yourself
[1:58:22] because you are Christ
[1:58:24] in the bright body glorify yourself in
[1:58:28] this body with the same Glory that she
[1:58:31] had with you before the world was met
[1:58:34] that's why her names were written there
[1:58:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:58:38] that's why you died for her before the
[1:58:41] foundation of the world that's why her
[1:58:43] Works were finished before the
[1:58:46] foundation of the world and the devil
[1:58:47] can never stand and I choose her
[1:58:50] successfully over any works because her
[1:58:53] works are finished and sealed away
[1:58:56] help us Lord
[1:58:58] We Just Surrender that we are perfect
[1:58:59] will and I pray that God will follow
[1:59:02] this word in the hearts of your children
[1:59:04] Quicken us to what you want us to be
[1:59:07] and bring us back to manifest
[1:59:11] Lord what we where commissioned and what
[1:59:15] we accepted to do before the foundation
[1:59:17] of the world granted the father
[1:59:20] in Jesus name we pray amen

[2:01:13] Lord prep my feet on higher
[2:01:19] oh praise God
[2:01:21] how how good does it do to us to realize
[2:01:24] amen that it was finished before the
[2:01:27] foundation of the world that is not
[2:01:29] based on my effort it's based on his
[2:01:31] will and his plan and he's providing the
[2:01:33] power to overcome because he willed it
[2:01:35] before
[2:01:37] oh my goodness
[2:01:39] no matter what we find ourselves in it
[2:01:41] was finished before the foundation of
[2:01:43] the world no matter what trial what
[2:01:45] Temptation what difficult circumstance
[2:01:47] The Works were finished before the
[2:01:49] foundation of the world
[2:01:51] oh God help us to get to the place where
[2:01:54] we stop going into panic
[2:01:56] I've wanted this for years I want to
[2:01:58] stop going into panic when trouble comes
[2:02:00] but I want to start moving into
[2:02:01] anticipation saying oh God I can't wait
[2:02:04] to see what you've already ordained for
[2:02:06] this overcoming
[2:02:08] amen because I know that you've already
[2:02:10] ordained an overcoming amen because it
[2:02:12] was before
[2:02:14] praise God
[2:02:16] amen it's amazing that we believe
[2:02:20] not because we've been intellectually
[2:02:22] taught
[2:02:23] we believe because we heard it before
[2:02:30] we come from the mind of God we were
[2:02:32] there when he made the decree when he
[2:02:34] showed the Plan of Salvation we rejoiced
[2:02:36] with joy and shouted with joy and
[2:02:38] gladness amen I'm so glad that the amen
[2:02:42] doesn't come from the brain the amen
[2:02:43] comes from the soul
[2:02:45] amen we have natural ears and maybe for
[2:02:48] the first time our natural ears we hear
[2:02:50] something amen but there's something
[2:02:52] inside that says I've heard that before
[2:02:53] amen amen means so be it that's the
[2:02:56] truth that's right
[2:02:58] how do you know it's right it's the
[2:03:00] first time you heard it it's the first
[2:03:01] time I've heard it here but it's not the
[2:03:03] first time I've heard it here
[2:03:05] so down here is an amen so be it that's
[2:03:08] right
[2:03:09] praise God Amen I'm so thankful that
[2:03:12] we've got a message that will connect us
[2:03:14] back to where we came from
[2:03:16] to give us the power to overcome by his
[2:03:19] grace amen are you thankful
[2:03:23] I am so thankful
[2:03:25] may God
[2:03:27] amen may God find in me a willing vessel
[2:03:30] that will surrender all thinking all
[2:03:32] will all desire and empty out and invite
[2:03:37] him to come and fill up to do what he's
[2:03:40] always intended to do through this
[2:03:41] vessel may he find that in me may find
[2:03:44] it in you may we surrender fresh to him

[2:04:31] so that I won't speak in error again
[2:04:34] God may we find now this morning may
[2:04:37] there be a repentance in US Lord for
[2:04:39] speaking foolishly for speaking Earthly
[2:04:42] for speaking carnally
[2:04:44] but God may we lend our mouth to the
[2:04:47] speech Lord which we had with you before
[2:04:49] the foundation of the world
[2:04:51] may we refuse Lord if if the negative is
[2:04:54] coming may we be like job and put our
[2:04:56] hand over our mouth
[2:04:58] and God may we open our mouth to allow
[2:05:00] you to speak eternal life eternal words
[2:05:03] from your Eternal plan

[2:05:08] us in a greater way
