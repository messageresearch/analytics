scripture in a moment thank you all and just want to say how much I enjoyed the weekend meetings and so thankful brother Alistair was able to come along and sent me a text this afternoon he finally got home at 10: this morning our time so he had quite a journey he left uh Detroit um uh Monday evening so Monday evening to 10:00 this morning our time he was been traveling so I'm sure he's tired but he wanted me to greet you all say he had a good time and he was happy to be here and I'm sure he's very happy to be home and so I thank you all for that and also I wanted to thank you for that uh surprise on Sunday I was very surprised very shocked I had no idea and and so whoever decided to pull that off and whatever you did to pull it off you did a good job amen so thank you very much and I just want to say thank you to everybody to the whole church we love you all so very much and uh we're so thankful for your love for us I've been reading cards for three days and uh I didn't want to read them fast I just took a stack and I would sit in my seat with a couple of coffee and read them slow and it took me 3 days to get through the mall and I just want to say I love you all so much you guys are so kind to us and so encouraging and we just really want to say thank you appreciate the deacons who helped organize that also who all those who helped with the food brought food in and organized that thank you so much and thank sister Donna Howard for the cake it was wonderful amen uh and also for the Youth who were singing that was very very special my heart was in a puddle in my shoes I was I was a mess I was glad I didn't have to say anything that day because I was overwhelmed actually quite overwhelmed appreciate Brother Kyle for organizing that part of it and brother Jeremy for the things he said I I felt sorry for him for having to stay there stand there and say those things and somebody sent me a recording of it and I still haven't been able to go back and listen to it it just breaks me up too much but maybe I'll grow up and get tough and be able to listen to it here soon but uh we appreciated the cards were beautiful the things you wrote we're undeserving of but we're thankful for the love that you Express and also the gifts and tokens of affection I just want to say thank you all so very much you never know what you all mean to us and and I I I thank God that he's put us together amen amen in reality we really didn't choose each other God chose but I'm happy with his choice and I thank God for it I was actually um here on a Saturday at the prayer time praying um a couple months ago maybe I don't remember exactly and I was really burdened with some things that I was burdened about some issues and some decisions and and I was actually a little bit complaining that I have to carry these burdens and make these decisions and I was asking God for help and and just kind of expressing that it's too much and and then oh man I got rebuked so bad I know right where I was I was right about where Donovan is crossing this way and I got rebuked so hard and I thought my goodness God's called me to preach the gospel I have that calling and I can't change that but of all the places to preach and of all the people to fellowship with I feel like the luckiest preacher of all and I was just looking at the picture the wrong way I was looking at burdens I was looking at stress I was looking at tough circumstances but when God shifted my thinking all of a sudden I said thank you God there's people who love to work for your gospel there's people who love to come and hear the word there's people who pull service after service after service they sing they work they labor and I'm the luckiest Pastor on the planet of the earth and that God's let me preach here so I going to say I love you all very much thank you for being so steadfast and constant and always making life easy it's easy to preach here because the hunger for the word amen and I feel blessed I feel privileged I came across this quote I'd like to read to you in the token he said look you know what it's your tithe and offerings that I live by it's your support here at the church that I have somebody to preach to It's Your Love and your amens and your fellowship and your kind words amongst out in the in the world there where you go to to different states across a nation it's your words that helps take the message it's you we are Partners in this with Christ we are brothers and sisters and he is our King amen so I just want to say God bless you for the last 10 years it's been wonderful and I pray that God will help us to be faithful for however anym he he wants he desires and he permits and I'm I'm looking forward to see what he'll do next amen let's all stand together let's if we can turn to Second Timothy Chapter 2 and look into the word and we just want to we just want to thank God for his faithfulness there's no man that's been faithful none God's been faithful there's no there's no Pastor that's been faithful and there's no congregation member that's been faithful there's been no faithful Deacon and no faithful trustee it's God who's been faithful but we thank God for The Men Who yield themselves who sacrifice who surrender we appreciate that we want to always be thankful for that but we always want to recognize it's God it's God who both Wills causes us to will and do of his good pleasure and it's him in us and so we're thankful for that and we just trust him he who's been faithful in the past who he began a good work in us we'll finish it amen and we believe that amen let's as as we look at second Timothy let's go to chapter 2 and uh read verse 19 to 21 2 Timothy 2:1 19- 21 nevertheless the foundation of God stand ass sure having this seal that the Lord knoweth them that are his and that every one of you that named the name of Christ depart from iniquity but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meet for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work amen God bless you as you have your seats we ask God to open our eyes to see his word amen as we look into his word I'd like to preach on a subject this uh evening of a vessel unto honor a vessel unto honor and I I've been trying my best to turn over a new leaf and on Wednesday nights just to preach around an hour and I've not been super successful the last Wednesday I was I don't know if anybody took note but I was so proud of myself amen so because I was proud of myself I'll probably fail tonight but I'm trying so I I am mindful of work schedules and school schedules and I I understand that and I I want you to know I'm aware of that and so that is my intention you know and and U I thank God that brother brandham all the time says I'm just going to preach for 20 or 30 minutes then he goes an hour and a half hour and 45 minutes so I'm thankful that that at least we have that example amen but also we want God to have his way amen we're Mindful and we want to be realistic about where we are in life and the the people's work schedules and school schedules but we also want God to take his Liberty and when the atmosphere is right and the word is coming forth we're not going to shut him down amen but Our intention and I've been trying to come to the pull pit with narrowing my thought down and not trying to bring so much in so that we can be mindful of that so I say that to say this pull fast pull fast and hard and we'll we'll work together amen we'll labor together amen when we when we look here at second Timothy in this scripture uh in verse 21 it says if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meat for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work uh let's turn now to Romans chapter 9 Romans chapter n Romans chapter 9 and and verse 20 nay but oh man who art thou that repliest against God shall the thing form say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus ha not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel into honor and another into dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had a four prepared unto Glory even us so what are the vessels of mercy and the vessels of Honor us even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles so here in verse or chapter n we we see this description of a Potter and making vessels out of clay and one vessel into honor and another vessel into dishonor dishonor and how can we how can we complain against God why has me why hast Thou made me thus does he not have P power over the play to make one this way and one that way and so we know that God is the great Potter and he has made us the way he wants us to be amen and some vessels under honor and some under dishonor but if we look at this analogy we're looking at here in the scriptures this example he's taking clay because the Potter is molding clay so both vessels are made out of clay and so that you will understand we are all made out of clay so we're all vessels amen we're all vessels that The Potter's made some are to honor and someone to dishonor but they're all made out of the same substance they're all made out of Earth they're all made out of clay so just to uh uh just to set the foundation here I I would like to make this statement it's not what the vessel is made of that makes it a vessel under honor it's what's in the vessel that makes it a vessel under honor and a vessel under dishonor because I can take two vessels of clay and I can fashion one with the intent that I'll make get a garbage can yeah right and the other one I can set to be a place to catch all my loose chain and coins or I can put gold gold coins or gold nuggets in it amen and one would be a vessel into honor one would be a vessel into dishonor because of the purpose I purposed it for and I need the trash can it serves a purpose in my home it has a there's a point to making it that way God does everything for a purpose and with a point and nothing's wasted but it's not and listen it's not the material that makes it honorable or dishonorable it's what it's made for and what's inside of it so it's not our clay that is Honorable it's not our vessel it's not us amen God said brother benam even said amen it's not the person that comes predestinated but it's the seed amen so it's that part of God that he or he purposed to be in your clay vessel that makes it a vessel and honor because he appointed it to be so he desired it he fashioned it for that purpose that that makes it a vessel unto honor and when Paul and Timothy was saying that there's so many different kinds of vessels in any house gold and silver and and clay and Earth and there there's so many vessels with so many purposes but if we will be a separated purged a vessel amen Sanctified will be fit for the Master's use which means everything that would be dishonorable has to be cast out of it so that which is Honorable can be inside amen right amen so we we we need to be purged from the things of the world separated from the things that are dishonorable and fit for the Master's use that we could be a vessel unto honor to serve his purpose to be filled with his Spirit to be a vessel unto honor now in the message why Christ speak brother benam says Moses being born with this great gift of faith then he was anointed and commissioned at the burning bush to deliver God's people now see what great qualities this man had he he was born for a certain thing God had a purpose in it God's got a purpose of you being here if you can only get to that place how much trouble you'll save God and yourself too I like that quote I've heard it I've heard it quoted many times I I've I've quoted it myself I've thought of it if we can only be get to that place how much trouble you'll save God in yourselves so to get to what place God has got a purpose of you being here so that's to get to your place of purpose amen so I've I've looked at that many times and I've talked about that many times but I realize also the quote if there's no understanding that comes with the quote it can also be something that causes anxiety and causes stress because if I don't get to my position of purpose I'm causing myself and God a lot of trouble right has anybody ever heard that and said I just wish I knew what my purpose was so I don't cause God any trouble amen so I want to I want to look at that because I would like to dispel that kind of thinking amen hopefully we can so he's talking about Moses was born with a gift of faith and Moses was born for a purpose and you're born for a purpose you've got a purpose of being here and if you can only get to that place how much trouble you'll save God and yourself too then he goes on says Moses born and then he was afterwards he was brought to the place where he was anointed and notice the seed laying there with an intellect ual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver this people and yet it never came to life until that light from the burning bush flashed across it until he seen not something he read about but something he seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it oh how that did bring things to life I think any man or woman boy or girl and I think in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so we're never can have a full Foundation stand until they have met that light that brings that word to reality so if we can talk about coming to our purpose that place to save God and ourselves a lot of trouble maybe let's just for the for the sake of this service and just for me let's not think about it as as finding your your position your place as far as a job to do but your position in Christ that comes through the new birth because there was a lot of trouble amen with Moses he created a lot of trouble for himself and a lot of trouble for God until he met the burning bush and when he met the burning bush that meeting with the Burning Bush brother benam said Quicken that seed that was within him before it was an intellectual Faith he knew by what his mother taught him that he was born to be a deliverer he knew what the promise was he knew the season was but when he went to try to do it on his own accord with his own ability he failed miserably caused a bunch of problems ran off for 40 years into the the Wilderness and wandered around following his father-in-law's uh uh goats sheep until he met a pillar of fire until he be come under that brother B said until he was anointed amen until he met the pillar of fire something that was real something that spoke back to him something that gave him his position and his commission it wasn't different than what he understood it was different because now it came to life amen right right amen amen that would save us a lot of trouble if we came to that position to the New Birth amen by meeting a living God face to face and recognizing who we are amen so let's turn to Acts chapter n Acts chapter 9: 3 in Acts 9:3 this is the story of Paul he Saul at this time says as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecuted it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks Here Comes PA Paul previously known as Saul coming down the road and we know why he's traveling we know what condition he's in he's in he's in good standing in the church he's a religious zealot he is trying to fight this new sect of of of of the Christians he's he's fighting for the word he's fighting for the law of Moses he's in good standing with the chief elders and the chief priest and he's got letters to go to Damascus now to to re them in and to stop this new Revival that's going forth but as he goes down the road he's going to meet a pillar of fire he's going to meet that same one that Moses met in the burning bush and that one's going to bring to life what is really inside the Apostle Paul amen Saul amen it's not that he doesn't love the word it's not that he doesn't want to stand for the word it's not that he doesn't want to serve God's purpose it's not that he doesn't want to serve God's people but he's doing it intellectually but he's got to meet the living word amen to Quicken that thing to life the change him for his real purpose and his real purpose wasn't much different than the purpose he was serving but he was going the wrong direction Moses was going the wrong direction but God brought him back in lineen so let's go down to verse 10 now uh the Lord speaks to ananas and he says verse 10 and there was a certain disciple of Damascus named ananas and to him said the Lord in a vision ananas and he said behold I am here Lord and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for behold he prayeth and he seeth in a vision a man named ananas coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight then ananas answered Lord I have heard but many I have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to the Saints at Jerusalem and here he ha Authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me this is a vessel unto honor he's been acting dishonorably and that's what ananas was seeing that's what he's relating back to the Lord he looked like a vessel of Dishonor but God knew he's a chosen vessel he's a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake amen let's go now to Philippians quickly there's a couple scriptures I want to hit quickly while we're talking about Paul if we could hit Philippians chapter 3 now for just a second Philippians 3 oh 3 verse 4 four though I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I more circumcised The Eighth Day of the stalk of Israel The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law a Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gained to me those I count loss for Christ yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ here comes the Apostle Paul and and when you look at the way Paul is approaching uh Ministry or Paul's approaching maybe his calling amen he's doing so intellectually he's doing so with church backing he's doing so with intellectual understanding of of the the Bible he's doing so with Bible School teaching he's doing so amen with letters of authority he's given permission he's got backing he's got education he's got everything going for him he's going this is the way the denominations like to do it this is the way mankind likes to do it this is with all strength and with all power amen but this is not how God wants to do it amen God is going to do something but it's it's still in Paul to do it he's still a chosen vessel he just is going about it the wrong way he's using intellect and power and support and all of these things Amen to go about doing amen doing what he believes is the work of the Lord but when he meets the pillar of fire amen there's going to be a change inside of him and that in that change he's going to Cast Away everything that was a strength before and he's going to become unsupported he's going to I mean he can't give up his education but he cast it away as dung because he realizes all I ever learn led me the wrong way I had the wrong interpretation the wrong understanding I missed the Manifest station I persecuted the very godm made flesh amen the very word for my day amen that I wanted I was fighting so now he has to cast it all away and now he moves out and when he moves out he moves out with no support no special education there is no new University of the new Nazarene church right he's just moving out by the power of God he's moving out amen with the Simplicity of that calling that's awakened in him and realize he's a chosen vessel he's a vessel of Honor but not honor the way the world sees honor he looked like a vessel of Honor before but to the world he looked like a vessel of Dishonor now yeah yeah Amen in in the book of Acts we don't have to turn there but I'll just you know it well when Paul and Barnabas go out preaching and they go preaching and the the Jews reject them he said it was needful that the gospel should come to you first but seeing how you put it from you Lo we turn to the Gentiles and then he recites the scripture he says for for Lo the Lord has said unto us that I will send you as a light to the Gentiles for the Salvation to the ends of the world and all of a sudden you realize he's quoting Isaiah he's quoting the book of Isaiah and when you go back and look Isaiah those scriptures are scriptures speaking of Jesus Christ am yes so now Paul when he leaves honor when he leaves education when he leaves power and he goes God's provided way and humility and simplicity now it proves he's a vessel of Honor because what's in him amen he is now the vessel that God is going to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah now it's Christ working through him Amen to bring the light to the Gentiles and he says I've set thee to be a light to the Gentiles what is he who is Paul he's a clay vessel like every other clay vessel that's on the face of the Earth what's different is who's inside of Paul and the prophecy the word that Paul's living out is a light to the Gentiles for salvation to the end of the world Paul's demotion was a promotion his downgrade was an upgrade that's right Amen to so we find that that God has no problem God has no problem taking scriptures that he gave to Isaiah hundreds of years before and now telling Paul you're the Fulfillment of that when the scripture is clearly speaking of Christ that's a vessel un honor amen you couldn't tell by looking on the outside it was a clay pot yeah in so much that one of the greatest works of the Apostle Paul one of the greatest that things that was achieved through that man through that Ministry was really this is just my opinion so I might be wrong but it really wasn't the Miracles that were wrought by his hand really wasn't the Miracles that's in my in my mind in my opinion the way I view things it really wasn't even just his missionary Journeys although they were tremendous but I think the greatest achievement that was brought through that vessel was the letters that he wrote which is the New Testament that we read now as effective as the Miracles were they only affected so many people that saw them that right as effective as the missionary journey was the missionary journey could only impact several thousand people amen but how much impact has those letters that he wrote the Epistles of Paul the new Testament the main bulk and body of the New Testament how much impact does that have so much impact that at the end time a a prophet in our day would have to come back and say I preached what Paul preached how did he know what Paul preached because of the letters that Paul wrote yeah now I want to ask you where did he write the letters he wrote a whole pile of them in prison amen a vessel of Honor in a dishonorable Place yeah in a dishonorable condition Dishonored by the world but he was never Dishonored by God Amen it doesn't matter what we see amen what God sees is the only thing that matters and it doesn't matter the outside condition amen that's not what makes it honorable or a vessel unto honor what makes it a vessel unto honor is what's on the inside and that God can use it it's for the Master's use let's go to Acts chapter 7 Acts chapter 7 uh verse 34 this is uh Saul pre or um not Saul this is uh who is this step stepen before he stoned preaching after he's on trial and he's referring to Moses here and he says I have seen I have seen the Affliction of my people which is in Egypt and I've have heard their groaning and have come down to deliver them and now come I will send thee into Egypt God was coming down but how was God coming down he was coming down in that Prophet with that Prophet amen that's what made him a vessel unto honor amen amen I'm going to read a couple uh I'm going to spend a little bit of time in God hiding himself in Simplicity this is the message brother brenon preaches at the very beginning of the seal Series so he comes back in the spring of 1963 to preach the seals and he starts off with God hiding himself in Simplicity than revealing himself in the same amen and it and it's an amazing it's an amazing service and the more I read it the more I'm Amazed by it but I want to look at it in uh as it as it has to do with Moses right now says just think they could break Adams and do everything else but when it come to touching life they can't even tell where it comes from a simple blade of grass and God's hid in it amen they can split an Adam but they can't explain what makes a blade of grass live reproduce and Thrive they can't explain but God's hid in it they stand on it they walk over it but God's hid in it remember he's preaching God hiding himself in Simplicity than revealing himself in the same so they can fire a rocket to the moon and shoot a radar over there or whatever more and yet can't explain the life in a blade of grass that's right it's because it can't be explained it's so simple they Overlook that now notice Moses now here this is this is what started to stand out to me right before he says that he's referring to Moses in Egypt now he says this then he comes right back to Moses so he wants us to understand something about uh hidden and revealed in Simplicity now notice Moses in the day that God was going to deliver the children of Israel according to his word what did he do he chose a simple family we have no record of them amram and jocked he's just a son of Levi is all we know and his wife just an ordinary probably a mud Dober as the world would think out there making brick for the enemy he was just an ordinary slave in Israel but God chose that family to bring forth the deliverer just an ordinary Jewish Family he never went and got royalty in Celebrity or something or even got some priest he took a common ordinary family see Simplicity notice what he done then he brought forth a child a simple human being he never he could have ordained the son if he wanted to deliver them he could have ordained the wind to deliver them he could have ordained an angel to deliver them so he starts to he's he's going into God hiding himself in Simplicity and he starts talking about Moses then he rocks over to man's Wisdom can shoot shoot a rocket I Me To the Moon and and shoot a radar but can't explain the life in a blade of grass they walk right over the Simplicity of God can never explain it CU it's so simple they can't explain it and then he goes right down to Moses moses' birth amen come through an ordinary family enslaved like everybody else was slaved Amen to a ordinary man and an ordinary woman who had an ordinary labor had an ordinary birth and brought forth an ordinary child but this child was a chosen vessel ordained before the foundation of the world Amen to be a deliverer so we know all the things that happened to him but from the outside you couldn't tell any difference yeah you couldn't tell he was a vessel of clay but he was a vessel of clay made for a purpose then he goes down a little bit further and God hiding himself in Simplicity and I'm going to read this this is a little bit lengthy so just stay with me and pay attention so now notice and he had him trained in worldly wisdom so God allowed that this simple human being would be taken to the house of pharaoh and be made the son of the daughter of pharaoh and he said and God and he had him trained in worldly wisdom so that he could fail and show that it isn't wisdom that will ever be delivered by God allowed him to be trained just so he could fail yes hey I just want to say some things has your education ever failed you has your religious training ever failed you did God let you get trained why so it could fail that's right praise God amen amen he said now he said it isn't wisdom that will ever be delivered by it's by faith that we are deler he let him go in and get such an education until he could teach the Egyptians wisdom he was so smart God was with that simple family who could perhaps maybe not write their name and Moses was tooken the highest of schooling and with such a great education till he could teach the wisdom to teachers he could teach the genius yes and God let him get that way so he could display himself in humility to show that wisdom has nothing to do with it amen and Moses miserably failed in his genius hey guess who else miserably failed in their genius Paul hey Saul he miserably failed in his genius he was persecuting the very thing he was trying to defend he was fighting the wrong thing in his genius he perfectly failed in Moses's genius he perfectly failed and my genius I have perfectly failed amen praise God yes and God let him get that way God let him get that way so he could display himself in humility to show that wisdom has has nothing to do with him and Moses miserably failed in his genius he let him get that way for his purpose so he'd fail and he did fail and he fell so to show not by power not by might but not by the wisdom of Egypt not by the wisdom of our schools not by the power of our seminaries not by the amounts of our organization not by the power of our scholarly teaching but by my spirit saith God yes wisdom has vanished and and at its end when he met God in the burning bush here he took off his shoes and humbled himself to humility and forgot all about his wisdom God bringing Deliverance had to train him in wisdom to let him fall to show that you cannot lean upon the arm of your understanding or anybody else's understanding amen let him fall to show his hand can you see it God's purpose in doing so was to display himself in humility and he let Moses become the highest until he was he'd be the next Pharaoh he was a General according to history he conquered Moses himself the countries around and when he turned to the work of the Lord with all of his talent God let him take a headlong topple so that he could put him out there on the desert and beat all that out of him and then appear to him in humility and send him down with a stick in his hand to deliver the people when he couldn't do it by military training by an education by a scientific education and by a military force he could not do it and he gave him an old Crooked Stick off the desert and he did it with it God in humility Simplicity God was in the stick and in Moses and as long as Moses had the stick then God had it because God was in Moses what a statement yeah as long as amen as long as Moses had the stick then God had it CU God was in Moses notice what was he he was a vessel un honor notice not by power nor by I might but by my spirit but by the simple Faith Moses had an understanding that he was to be the deliverer from the teaching of his mother and he trained himself in military might to do so but it failed he had the understanding he had the education but that didn't work so he had to forget it all and to come to the simple thing of taking God at his word and then he delivered the people yes sir amen this is a man who was taught by his mother you're the deliverer you were born a proper child there was a sign at your birth we know that you come at the right season we know you're special we saved you for that amen now uh uh look God has preserved your life and now you're you're you're in Pharaoh's house and his mother amen told him all of these things and and and Moses went about brother B tells us he learned all the military good he could all the wisdom why no doubt in his mind was this teaching from his mother that you're the special child you're born under a sign you're the deliverer and God let him get so full of that stuff amen so God could prove that none of that will work it'll absolutely fail and it did fail he went and killed one Egyptian was rejected by his Brethren went running into the Wilderness and and it failed so miserably until Moses walks around in the wilderness for 40 years and forgets about education and Science and Military until he becomes weak until he becomes nothing until his beard grows down till his age comes on till he's married with a couple children forgot about it all until God comes back to him now in the burning bush to send him right back because he's still a chosen vessel he's still a chosen vessel unto honor for the glory of God nothing's changed God's right on time God has Moses just where he wants him he let him spend the first 40 years gaining everything he can gain to prove that nothing man can do is going to accomplish God's purpose in your life it's going to take a washing out of that and coming to a weakness and a humility and an inability to an utter Simplicity and in the utter Simplicity Moses goes down there without military without might without money without politics without anything he goes down there with nothing but faith in the Commandment of God and he conquers Egypt and delivers Israel with nothing but simplicity humility weakness praise be to God brother brenaman preaching uh God hiding himself in Simplicity he's now coming to the preaching of the seals but he says I've got to preach this first then when he gets to the seventh seal he refers back to the the first service he preached God hiding he says remember remember God hiding himself in Simplicity why because now brother brandham is coming amen he's coming to the most Sublime scripture in all the Bible Revelation CH 5 when the lamb takes the book and then breaks the seals and he's coming to the breaking of the seals he's coming to the sounding of the seven Thunders that have been sealed up until the time of the end and it's going to take place right there where is it going to take place on the corner of two ordinary streets in an ordinary town in a small City and mid in the midwest USA in nowhere with nobody in a no no name Place amen it's called brandom Tabernacle if you've ever been by it it's a simple box of a square building no cathedral ceilings no high arching spikes no decorative ornamentation just a brick Square on the corner of two side streets and a little city amen a little no-name place in Midwest USA God hiding himself in Simplicity what was taking place there the greatest thing that had happened one of the greatest things that ever happened was taking place in that brick building on the corner of Athan pin God hiding himself in Simplicity chosen a chosen Tabernacle but it didn't look like it and who was the vessel he was going to use Amen to preach the seals the sound of Thunders it was going to be a man with a seventh grade education with no no educ no theological education a man who couldn't pronounce all those words a man who started in the ministry would ask his girlfriend friend to read the scriptures how would you like it if your pastor had to have his girlfriend read the scriptures before he started the service cuz he couldn't pronounce those big words some of you wouldn't go to church there amen was rejected by had no class had no form had no order had no elegant speech had no backing of denomination had no formal education he was simple humble amen a vessel of clay but to me he was a vessel unto honor amen not because of his stature not because of his eloquence not because of his education not because of his power because of who was in him amen and what he was doing he was a vessel under honor and he didn't do it by education he didn't didn't do it by politics he didn't do it by his great ability to put scripture with scripture he didn't have that ability it was the Holy Ghost who put scripture with scripture and all he did was come out and say what was told him the Simplicity of just taking God at his word amen believing what he said and coming forth the same as Moses Moses didn't come with anything other than his faith in the word of God that's what Paul eventually moved out with Paul had no support he had no backing he would have one Church give him an offering to help him go to another church at the end of his ministry he didn't have anybody hardly backing him at all they had all forsaken him and he's asking for somebody to bring his coat Deus has left me all has forsaken me only only Luke remains amen he's in this position why amen because God's not going to do it with might and power and strength and Glory he's going to do it through humility and simplicity because this was a chosen vessel unto honor but it didn't look like it God hiding himself in Simplicity amen until brother Venom preaches those consecutive days eight days takes 10 sermons comes to the last day in the seventh opening of the seventh seal he says oh friends if you only knew he says remember back God hiding himself in Simplicity remember what I said at the beginning about Simplicity you would think something like that would happen in the Vatican not in this little building not in this little place in Jeffersonville Indiana you think you think this great momentous this great huge thing that God was going to do and I ask you was it huge it was huge was it momentous absolutely was it powerful it was the thing that was waking up the bride it was the thing that was bringing her rapturing grace amen for Faith to change her body amen it was momentous it was powerful it was power packed and it was so humble there wasn't a prayer line amen there wasn't there wasn't anything that people would know how momentous this was taking place it was a man coming to the pull pit every day saying the an angel came to me and gave me this and I search it through the scriptures and this is the interpretation this lines with this lines with this lines with this amen and he was so busy with this he wasn't visiting people he wasn't he wasn't dedicating babies he wasn't praying for the sick what he was doing is he was going into a little room he was meeting an angel angel was giving him an interpretation amen he would go search of the scriptures he'd come out and tell him everything he said and everything he found and he'd go back into the room amen there was nothing of the person that was attracting the people it was the revelation of the word amen it was powerful yes yes but you couldn't tell God just by your senses you couldn't tell just by your eyes you couldn't tell how momentous it was we look back and we can tell no doubt there was an anticipation no doubt there was an energy no doubt there was an enthusiasm you can hear the people shouting and rejoicing at the breaking of the word but how many there that day knew how powerful it was knew how momentous it was knew how revolutionary lifechanging this was amen God hiding himself in Simplicity using a chosen vessel into honor but nobody nobody with natural eyes and natural ability can tell what God's doing let's go to John chapter 15 John chapter 15 in verse 16 he says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you amen what are they chosen vessels amen unto honor you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you the disciples didn't choose themselves right God chose them I think it's worth note what God chose amen when God was going to chose the men that were going to represent him after his death burial and resurrection and they were going to be the ones amen who would be his Apostles that would spread amen the message of this new message this message of Salvation and life around the world who did he choose fishermen Tax Collectors he didn't choose what we would have chose intellectually brother Brenham said Peter Couldn't Write his name they were ignorant and unlearned that's the what the Pharisees said of them of John and uh uh Peter they're ignorant and they're unlearned but that's a chosen vessel unto honor not because of what it looked like but because of what was inside what God had purposed its used to be for that's what made it a vessel into honor you know and as God chose these disciples they were I I think we could safely say they were nobodies they weren't the the elites they weren't the educated they weren't the wealthy they weren't any of that but God handpicked these men these were the men that he wanted to represent him to be the light of the world to to to to carry forth the gospel of Salvation and he chose them and they become part of the ministry and as they become part of the ministry now they begin to uh uh be in the midst of what was going on and there was crowds and there was healings and they even had healings themselves they would pray for the sick they were healed they saw mirac Ires amen they performed Miracles they were there in the preaching they were sent out two by two to go around the Villages and the cities amen preparing the way for the Lord and it was amazing it was so amazing till it got to the point where they begin to argue with themselves who was the greatest amen who is the greatest among them and then it got so bad that their mama got involved and wanted to know if she could secure a place for her boys in the Kingdom listen sometimes mamas need to just quit we love you Mom but we don't need your help so much so that that they went from nothing to when God started using them in the ministry and things started happening they got so elevated that they started getting political and they started vying for position and they want to know who was the greatest among them and who would be greatest in the kingdom and they begin to miss everything here here they are next to God in flesh God had come in such a humble way born amen through a nobody amen born through Mary who was who is nobody special no nobody of Elegance nobody of stature nobody of great wealth no royalty he just came humbly and a humble way and a humble Place lived in obscurity he comes forth and he has nothing he doesn't have houses he doesn't have armies he doesn't have politics he has nothing and they miss the humility they saw the power they missed this chosen vessel unto honor they missed what God was doing and they they got all wrapped up in the power and the might and the glory and the Grandeur until they wanted to secure their position in it and Peter was one of the worst until God let Peter fail let him utterly fail so Peter would realize what he is without God one all his arguments and his efforts and his strength and his his bold determination to serve God and His willingness to fight for what he believed in and even fighting to try to kill a man to save Jesus that was all carnal carnal carnal it wasn't a bit spiritual yeah all their fussing was carnal amen it wasn't a bit spiritual they were in the midst of a spiritual move and they were acting carnal yeah right Peter was pet Jesus was speaking spiritually amen prophecy saying the son of man must go into Jerusalem be evily treated amen be slain and lay in three days and resurrect and and and Peter amen heard spiritual words amen but because he was Cardinal he says far be it from you for the thing like this to happen to you and Jesus says get thee behind me Satan he was stuck in carnality he was stuck in the ways of the world he missed what true honor and true true honor really is amen till he fell flat on his face amen that was the grace of God Amen yeah now when he comes up now after after the resurrection and after Pentecost you don't see the disciples anymore jocking for position you don't see them anymore fighting for who's the greatest and who has the greatest Revelation who's going to be on the right hand and who's going to be on the left hand amen then they're willing to be crucified upside down they're willing to be rejected they're willing to be imprison they're willing everything they weren't willing before they're willing to have now why because they met the pillar of fire they met the thing that was already in them came to life and they were vessels chosen unto this to honor they were acting dishonorably but they were still CH vessels chosen unto honor but they had to come in contact with the Living God would Quicken that seed inside of them and then their carnality began to fade away and they still struggle with it we find Peter struggling with it in Antioch but he's able to get over that thing to the point that that Peter was rebuked by Paul y remember who came first Peter or Paul Peter was there from the beginning he was one of the first disciples chosen he was there in all the ministry he was he was even there during the trial there was only two of them that we know of that was there John and Peter amen he was one of the first to see the tomb he was one of the first he got a special meeting amen where God came Christ came to him in a special meeting yeah amen he had all of these things and Paul is Johnny come lately but Paul withstands him to his face and rebukes him because he was wrong based on the word you know what Peter does Peter subjects himself to the word and how do we know because later in his ministry when he's writing in the book of Peter it's either first or second Peter he starts to talk about the things that Paul says he said some of which are hard to be understood amen which men rest with wrestle with as they do the other scriptures so now Peter says Paul is speaking scriptures amen amen he gives honor unto that vessel that's God's using in the position he's in he's not trying to put Paul underneath of him and dominate and I was here first and you know you got to be careful about what Paul says if you really want it you got to come to the original right amen they met a pillar of fire something changed inside of them they were vessels un unto honor and some of that carnality began to fade away said oh God let carnality fade out of our minds this whole idea of who's better and who's best and who knows more and who know let's get rid of it friends and come back to humility and say all I know is what he said amen all I know is to move forward in the word amen I don't know anything else right let the carnality disappear brother B says well no I want to turn to Deuteronomy first and then we'll go to this next quote Deuteronomy I I'm hustling I just looked at the clock I shouldn't have done that bad news all right Deuteronomy 7 Deuteronomy 7 verse 6 de Deuteronomy 7 ver six for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God ha chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all the people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers ha the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of of bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt anden Moses is reminding them what he's reminding them of is you're nothing special what a good reminder you're nothing special God didn't choose you because you were special right he chose you to be a special people he chose you to be his people a holy nation a separated unto himself he did choose you for that but he didn't choose you based off your Merit he chose you based off his love his election his choice and his promise in his word right that's why he chose them because of the promise he gave to Abraham but it wasn't based on their Merit and it would do us a world of good to be reminding that God has chosen us amen he's called us to be a special people A peculiar people a chosen Nation amen a nation of Kings and Priests but he didn't do it because of us he did it because of him not this flesh amen we got to get that notion completely out of my mind this thing is just clay what makes it a vessel unto honor is not anything that has to do with this clay it's what's on the inside and the purpose the Potter fashioned it for he says in three kinds of Believers is and nobody can take your place no matter how little you say I'm just just a housewife nobody can take your place God in his great economy has so has so set so the body of Christ in order till there is no one can take your place how I would like to take Billy Graham's place any of us ministers but we can't do it but just remember Billy can't take your place see we all have a place some of us are evangelists some prophets some teachers some pastors whatever we are some Housewives some mechanics some Farmers Whatever It Is God has set you you in your place am I want to go back to the quote that I began with that when you would when you would recognize your position or place you'll save yourself and God a lot of trouble right somebody's place is a mechanic yeah praise God that's right a housewife a farmer an evangelist when we hear things we start to think wrong thoughts when we start thinking about your position in Christ we start thinking you're the bride of Christ we we immediately when you when you when you get into position it's hard for us not to think when we when we think about getting in position let me just say if I could say it this way when we say about when you get in your position in the body somehow we only think about what takes place in the church service what's on the platform Are the officers of the church are what we do collectively as a body but that is not what he's talking about am it can include that but that's not it God has placed you in your position right if not there's only about 10% of us that's in position and the rest of us are still waiting to get in position that's not true in any way shape or form that's a wrong conception that's the way the disciples were thinking before the resurrection before Pentecost they were thinking that way of positions yeah that's right but that's carnal that's not spiritual that's natural thinking that's not spiritual thinking amen amen amen let's go to 1 Corinthians 7 we're flipping back and forth a lot but it's good amen 1 Corinthians 7 1 Corinthians 7: vers 20 First Corinthians 7:20 let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called Art Thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be free use it rather for he that is called in the Lord being a servant is the Lord's free man likewise also he that is called being free as Christ's servant ye are bought with a price uh be not ye the Servants of men brethren let every man wherein as he is called therein abide with God are you called being a servant be a servant are you called being a master being a master are you called being a police officer be a police officer amen right are you called remember when they come to Jesus the tax collector the publicans come to Jesus say what must we do and Jesus didn't say stop being a tax collector what he said is he says don't extract more than what is fair and be honest amen right soldiers said to Jesus what must we do and he didn't say stop being a soldier what he said is do no violence to no man and be content with your wages yeah amen what if the farmer saying God what must I do just be faithful and true in what I called you to do don't leave the calling wherewith I called you it's not we have a funny idea of what's spiritual and not spiritual amen what's the work of God and not the work of God yeah yeah writing a song is the work of God is going to work the work of God that's right it depends on what he's called you for it depends on what your vessel is fashioned for and what God had his mind of you before the foundation of the world right if if we all have to wait until either I write a song sing a song sing in the choir uh I'm called to an office in the church preach the gospel do something if we're all waiting for that amen and when that's when I get in my position or when I see my gift operating that now I have tongues and prophecy and and that's my position no God's called you in a certain vein he's allowed your life to work out a certain way remain in the calling where they called you and be a Christian where you're at be Christ at work be Christ at school be Christ at home amen be the manifestation of Jesus Christ in your flesh for you're a vessel chosen unto honor and it doesn't matter what the rest of the world looks at what's inside of you is God God wants to shine a light in a dark place what dark place the one you work at amen God wants to be God working through a mother's office to bring up children in the nurture and ammunition of the Lord that's what God called some people to God called some people to be fathers some people for all kinds of occupations to do all kinds of things remember you're God's representation and wherever it is that you go every day you're taking God to that place You're A Link Between Heaven and Earth you are amen and don't don't go to that place you've met the pillar of fire you've come in contact your vess vessels holding the Living God the word made manifest for your day don't you dare get up in the morning put your boots on go to work thinking I wish I knew what my purpose was I wish I knew I wish God would give me a work to do in his kingdom you're called to go there there and be Christ and if we don't catch it we miss all the things that God's wanting to do every day in every place he puts us we start thinking carnal thoughts yeah this gift is better than that gift that position can really do something for God but this position is less if we think that way carnal amen that's carnal thinking amen that's right because what's spiritual is to be what God called you to be that's spiritual the highest thing you can achieve in the kingdom of God is to do exactly what he called you to do I want to ask you what's what's the greater position than being bride of Jesus Christ bride of Jesus Christ plus a title in the church no friends it doesn't work that way there's nothing better than being a son or daughter of God nothing nothing nothing you can't get any higher than bride of Jesus Christ praise be to God Amen we need to stop thinking carnal because when we think carnal we don't live spiritually we start living carnal going to work coming home wishing we had something to do for the kingdom of God going to work coming home wishing we had something making food for the kiddies taking care of husband been taking care of wife taking care of Home wishing we had something to do for the kingdom of God oh friends we got to wake up we got to wake up Christ in flesh a many membered body brother B said in voice of the sign he says Moses no one else could take his place no one else could do the job he was ordained to it and brother sister if you got eternal life you were dained to do a certain thing maybe a good housewife is that what the prophet said if you got eternal life you ordained to do a certain thing maybe a good housewife no it's got to be I I want to write a song that moves people to te and when they cry and they give their heart to the Lord that's the work of the Lord that is the work of the Lord but that's the work of the Lord for somebody else to do right and that work is not better than a good housewife am that's carnal thinking right we got got to break away from carnal thinking and be what God's called us to be and start having faith in who we are and the position he's put us in if you got eternal life you were ordained to do a certain thing maybe a good housewife maybe something else but nobody can take your place God has made you a place don't try to take somebody else's place that's carnal impersonations shows there is something wrong with you but what you are just exactly don't be nothing else house I love that you want to talk about Freedom this message gives us freedom remain in the calling wherewith you're called Don't Do Anything evil give your life to Christ live uh live the light of the Gospel wherever God has placed you and don't be anything different than what you are if you try any if you try to be spiritual and it's not natural for you to do what you're trying to do you are a crow putting peacock feathers in yourself that's right sometimes we think this is spiritual so I'm going to be this and that's not who you are that's not your calling that's not your position I'm going to try to do this I'm going to try to do that amen amen you're going to be a funny looking bird that's what brother B said but God made it simple be what you are don't be nothing but an original you be genuine you don't have to shout the loudest you don't have to cry the hardest you don't you don't have to I mean if you cry you don't have to dry it up if you're dry you don't have to cry if you're loud amen you don't have to suddenly become quiet if you're quiet you don't have suddenly become loud you don't have to change anything to be spiritual you have to be given over to the spirit of God to use you for what he made you for this message is freedom friends freedom from religion freedom from man's ideas freedom from carnality Amen brother brandham wasn't looking to be anything when God called him to be the prophet for the age he didn't apply for the job he wasn't working up the chain he wasn't taking this job and then I'll come from past I mean I'll be an evangelist and then maybe I'll be a pastor and I'll work my way up to Pro God made him what he was he could have never missed it brother Ram didn't come to God God came to him Moses didn't come to God God came to him the disciples didn't come to God God came to the disciples you're not going to go find yourself a position God is going to put where he ordained you to be from before the foundation of the world you don't have to use politics and maneuvering and talk to people and sew a seed in people's minds don't you think I would be good at this position and don't just leave it alone and keep doing what God's called you to do and when God wants you to do something he'll drop it in your heart God will put God will drop it in somebody else's heart right if somebody else has got supposed to ask they'll ask if you're supposed to do it he'll give it to you to do you just keep going being what you are an original you amen we've lived too long as immature Christians yes but real maturity is being comfortable in where God's placed you being content with what he's given you putting your you know putting your whole heart to the thing you have yeah your whole heart to your family your whole heart to your children your whole heart to your wife your whole heart to the to the work that he's called you to do yeah instead of doing everything half-hearted looking for something spiritual to do God help us and the invisible Union brother B said why it was put in there by predestination you were for ordained to a Son of God you were in God before the foundation of the world you're only manifest in this day for his honor and Glory how can you do it without honoring his word and stand with every word of God yes sir which you are a part of that word by predestination because look God is the word you believe it well then he always was the word in the beginning was the word and if the Word was God then you were in God Amen the word the part that you're to play was in God before the foundation of the world he seen you he knew you he predestinated you to it God you don't have to apply for it you don't have to make a resume you don't have to go stand in the job line all you have to do is live your whole heart for Christ God's gifts find their place amen I'm overtime but I got two more things I want to read I'm just going to quote to you the scripture in 2 Corinthians 4:5 he says for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we have this treasure what treasure the knowledge of God in the face of Jesus Christ brother B said in things that are to be said now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of God because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God am he said you're nothing but I I like being nothing but I don't want to be nothing but this now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son or daughter of God therefore you get what I mean see you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate that's our duty what's our duty to express God every Wednesday and Sunday when you come to church that's partially true you should Express God here too in this nation to this people this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are God knew that you would be there because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you got eternal life then always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here and he's not making one single mistake with where you are now amen back in the message of God hiding himself in Simplicity he said remember friends don't look for great big you say God he speaks of great big things there'll come a time there'll be this or that or the other great big things I hope you're catching what I'm talking about great big things and oh when this comes to pass it'll be great big like this it it'll be so humble you'll miss the whole thing and just go right on see you'll look back and say well that never did come to see passed right over the top and you never seen it it's so simple God lives in Simplicity to manifest himself in greatness amen one of these days God's going to move us to do something it's happening now he's living in a many membered bride now he's on the earth manifesting himself now anything else he can do he wants to do he can do when he gets preeminence in this body and control he can do whatever he wants remember when brother brandham spoke to squirrels that wasn't his idea he didn't go to God God came to him when it's time to speak to a storm he didn't ask God God come and told him what to say when it was time for his wife's healing he was asking God to heal but he never asked to speak the word god came to him

the Simplicity of going squirrel hunting right where's this big powerful thing going to take place it's going to take place when you're in the woods amen when you're at work when you're praying for your wife at the ottoman in the living room amen when you're out on the hunting trip with buddies when you're fishing don't look for great big things live for Christ every moment of the day I love this quote this quote is from 1957 we'll quit with this if The Magicians want to come on it's from a message called belief from the heart said it was a few days ago just to see how God does things simple and we're so flustrated till we look for great big things be satisfied with little things watch him when he does his glorious Works how he protects you don't be looking way over the top of something look down here notice I have begin to think this that it is possible that when a man like the apostles when you can live close to God and God through his grace operates through you that the more God you get the more Godly you become the more eternal life comes in the more the intellectual is pushed out now I don't mean to be a f I mean to be a real sane sound believer not a bunch of isms but a real solid true sensible intelligent believer what's going to do that when you don't look for big things but you notice all the little things he does all day long is it not Supernatural is it not powerful is it not him protecting him healing him delivering is it not him opening doors to conversation is it not him changing our PL is it not everything in our life working out all the time what are we looking for we're looking for the supernatural it's happening every day amen amen we look for big things we're going to walk right over the top of the blade of grass yeah and we're going to miss the life that's in your brother and your sister in yourself and your husband and your wife we want some big thing you're missing it you know there was going to be some great big thing happened at the opening of the seals it happened and they didn't notice it when no seven thunder sound it will brother benam said it's going on all around you and you're not noticing it right what was it a big thing in Simplicity man we got to become mature Believers quit looking for great big giant this and that God will do he will do whatever he wants to do amen but what he needs is a vessel un honor amen one that's ordained for a purpose one that's serving their purpose one that's giving him preeminence and purged from everything else that's met the Living God for this day that has Christ on the inside and is serving their purpose as Mom Dad coworker brother sister singer songwriter musician don't look for something the plan of God will find you friends it has found everybody in the Bible who went and found God and explained to God what their purpose was when Mary was to be the Virgin from Isaiah 7 God found her amen when when when Zachariah and Elizabeth was going to bring forth the Forerunner God found them amen what was Zachariah doing he was doing what God called him to do he was a priest working in the temple and all of a sudden there they came there came the angel what was Mary doing Mary was doing what she was called to do as a maid in her household and as a maid in her household she was supposed to fetch the water as simple as doing what God called her to do in her position right the angel found her Hey listen if she had been down at the temple trying to find some super spiritual work to do she would have missed her appointment right but she was fetching water Gideon was threshing wheat yeah you go on and on and on and on yeah where are the big things going to happen in your life when you're driving the work and he saves you from an accident when you weren't looking for anything spiritual when you were just doing what he called you to do when your child falls on the playground and they quit breathing and you in faith pick them up in your arms and say God you gave this child to me give them back their breath and their breath comes back in their body not when you're looking for it but when you're in your post of Duty when you're serving God when

Pin Street drove by saw a brick building and had no idea the big thing that was happening inside am great big things happen in silence amen so brother Bram said yeah right let the great big thing be
