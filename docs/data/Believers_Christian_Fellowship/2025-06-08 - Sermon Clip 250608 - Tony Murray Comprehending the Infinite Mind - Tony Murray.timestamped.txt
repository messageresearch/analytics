[0:00] In Philippians 2:5, this is the
[0:01] scripture I want to get to. He said,
[0:02] "Let this mind be in you, which was also
[0:05] in Christ
[0:06] Jesus, who being in the form of God,
[0:09] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[0:12] God." He didn't think it was robbery to
[0:14] be equal with God because he was God.
[0:16] But now he says, you need to think like
[0:18] this.
[0:20] The mind that was in Christ be in you.
[0:22] Think like this. It's not robbery to say
[0:24] that you're equal with God if you're
[0:27] actually part of God. The the bride is
[0:31] uh is not a creation of God. She's an
[0:34] expression of God. Amen. She she he was
[0:38] the only begotten son, but the bride was
[0:41] in him when he was begotten. So, she was
[0:45] also begotten of God because she was in
[0:47] him. And it's just an expression of God
[0:50] that is being made manifest. Amen.
[0:53] That's why we're joint ears with Christ.
[0:56] Joint just the same. He she can write
[0:58] the check. He can write the check. It's
[1:00] the same joint ears with Christ sitting
[1:02] with him in the throne. And that's why
[1:04] the prophet said, "Oh, if the church
[1:06] only knew its position." But I'm glad he
[1:09] said the next line. He says, "And it
[1:11] will one day."
[1:13] We're we're stepping right into the
[1:15] vision. Amen. Then the rapture will go
[1:17] when it knows what it is. And he says
[1:20] another the unconditional covenant that
[1:22] God made with his people. He says, "Oh,
[1:24] that makes the devil so mad." Sure does
[1:26] when you realize who you are. Amen.
[1:29] That's the revelation. That's the whole
[1:31] point. He's wanting to make himself
[1:32] known to us that we would come to find
[1:34] out that we are kind of his kind. Amen.
[1:37] We're becoming all that he is. Amen. God
[1:41] could not marry a different species.
[1:43] That's right. It's got to be kind of his
[1:44] kind. Mrs. Jesus Christ is like him. And
[1:48] just as brother Raman preached, Christ
[1:50] is the mystery of God revealed. So the
[1:52] bride is part of the mystery of Christ
[1:55] revealed. It's we start to see if when
[1:58] we first read the Bible, I was talking
[2:00] to brother Chad about this the other
[2:01] night. If you when we first read the
[2:02] Bible, it's like two books. The old the
[2:05] Old Testament that's about Jehovah God
[2:08] and it's about uh the law and it's about
[2:10] Israel. And then the ne the New
[2:12] Testament, oh that's about Jesus and
[2:14] that's about grace and that's about the
[2:16] Gentiles. But then when you read the
[2:18] Bible again in the light of the message,
[2:20] when you first come to the message,
[2:21] Brother Ram says it's the revelation of
[2:23] Jesus Christ from cover to cover. But
[2:25] then when you further read the Bible,
[2:27] when the seals come off the book, it's a
[2:30] love story.
[2:32] Oh, all the way through it's him and
[2:35] her. Him and her, we start to see our
[2:39] part. And as brother says, mama, it's
[2:41] me. We see the reflection. This what
[2:44] he's talking about. It's not just
[2:45] talking about a God of history. It's
[2:47] talking about Christ in you, the hope of
[2:50] glory. Amen. The prophet says of the
[2:52] bride, it says the members of this
[2:55] virgin bride will love him. They will
[2:57] have his
[2:59] potentials. Wow. What are the
[3:02] potentials of almighty God of the
[3:05] infinite mind? Well, we can see quite a
[3:08] few quite a lot of evidence of the
[3:10] potentials being expressed. He says,
[3:13] "But she will have his potentials.
