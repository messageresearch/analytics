[0:00] you remember when the Rich Young Ruler
[0:02] come to Jesus Christ and he says what
[0:04] must I do to gain
[0:06] eternal life to inherit eternal life and
[0:08] he says you know the Commandments you
[0:09] know don't steal on her father and
[0:11] mother and he starts to go through some
[0:12] of the Commandments that Moses gave and
[0:14] he says I've done all of these from my
[0:17] youth
[0:20] this is a picture of a Pharisee he he
[0:23] had lived clean he had lived pure he had
[0:25] done him from his youth amen and so he
[0:28] he felt pretty good about his condition
[0:30] and he was able to answer in the
[0:32] affirmative to Jesus when he gave him
[0:34] some requirements to meet he said I've
[0:36] met all of these requirements from my
[0:38] youth so he did not have a defiled body
[0:41] amen
[0:43] and he was obedient to the law of Moses
[0:46] and and he was walking in the statutes
[0:48] and the judgments of the Lord amen and
[0:50] right there in the midst of the the
[0:51] religion of the day amen but Jesus said
[0:54] to him if thou will be perfect
[0:58] if that will be perfect sell all thou
[1:00] has and given to the poor and come
[1:02] follow me and and the man went away
[1:04] sorrowfully for he hadn't much goods and
[1:07] Jesus wept after him because Jesus loved
[1:10] him amen Jesus statement was not a
[1:12] statement of condemnation because he
[1:13] didn't love him it was an opportunity
[1:15] for this man to go past the religion and
[1:18] come to the reality
[1:20] past the form past the ritual pass the
[1:23] respect of people amen what would have
[1:25] happened to this man if he sold all of
[1:27] his guns
[1:28] where would he have been in society what
[1:30] would the religious leaders of the day
[1:32] thought of him well he would have been a
[1:34] fool he would have been mocked he would
[1:35] have been an outcast then he would have
[1:37] been nobody all the friends that he had
[1:39] with him no longer been friends if he
[1:40] had sold all of his wealth given to the
[1:42] poor and come follow Jesus he would be
[1:44] just as much Outcast as everybody else
[1:46] that followed Jesus was
[1:49] and this man wasn't willing he he wanted
[1:52] eternal life but he did not want to have
[1:54] a perfect heart
[1:58] Jesus wasn't looking for those who just
[2:02] wanted a reward
[2:04] he was looking for those who wanted him
