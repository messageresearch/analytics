[11:24] way for a long time I

[12:27] Grace I'm so glad that I found out he

[12:37] way like a bird out of

[13:39] Grace I'm so glad that I found out he
[13:43] could bring me out show me the way he
[13:47] showed me the
[13:49] way praise the Lord you happy to be free
[13:53] this morning there's a lot of people
[13:56] that are
[13:57] bound but we can stand here by his grace
[14:00] free brother Randon would term this age
[14:03] as many things he would call it a bright
[14:05] age he would call it an astronaut age he
[14:08] would call it different things but my
[14:11] one of my favorite terms that he used to
[14:13] describe this age he says this is a free
[14:16] age this is a free
[14:19] age and just because there's bondage all
[14:22] across the face of the Earth there's
[14:25] darkness and gross Darkness over the
[14:27] face of the Earth
[14:29] you that doesn't mean that you have to
[14:30] be in
[14:32] bondage so just because there's darkness
[14:35] and gross Darkness doesn't mean that
[14:36] there's not the option of light just
[14:39] because there's bondage doesn't mean
[14:41] there's not the option of being free
[14:43] we've been given a word to free
[14:45] ourselves not just from denominations
[14:49] and vices but we think about this we've
[14:52] been given a word that is so
[14:55] powerful in this last closing moments of
[14:58] time we've been given a word that is so
[15:01] powerful it can literally free you from
[15:04] your own self it can literally free you
[15:07] from your own thoughts from your own
[15:09] genetic makeup from your own complexes
[15:13] it's one thing to be set free from
[15:14] another man's idea from a vice or from
[15:17] something like that but a word that can
[15:19] actually come in and free you from
[15:24] yourself there is none more
[15:26] powerful praise the lord it's good to be
[15:29] with you this morning let's just bow our
[15:30] heads for a word of prayer before we'd
[15:32] approach the word precious Lord Jesus
[15:35] we're so thankful to be here Lord and in
[15:39] this season of Thanksgiving we just want
[15:41] to come and bow ourselves before you
[15:44] thanking you father that you have poured
[15:46] out your grace and your mercy upon us
[15:49] and Lord not only have you sent us a
[15:52] profit father to expound upon your ways
[15:56] and upon your words but you have
[15:57] actually came came in the form of a
[15:59] prophet Lord the the revealed word you
[16:02] yourself to pass by our way Lord and to
[16:06] lead us and to guide us and to draw us
[16:08] into all truth Lord that we would not
[16:11] have to be bound by any man's idea even
[16:15] our own idea or even our past Traditions
[16:18] father but Lord you have seen fit to
[16:21] come by our way and free us from all
[16:24] things except for yourself so Lord as we
[16:28] would come to this portion of the
[16:29] service we would just ask that you would
[16:31] come now Lord that you would come and
[16:34] that you would be the speaker here this
[16:36] morning Lord for you know I have nothing
[16:38] to offer this people Lord we would ask
[16:41] that you would come and that you would
[16:42] be the hearer father and that you would
[16:45] just take your word and do that which
[16:47] you have divinely orchestrated this
[16:48] service for we commit ourselves to you
[16:51] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[16:54] amen let's turn in our Bibles to John 13
[17:00] please and this is where we will begin
[17:04] John Chapter 13 thank you
[17:08] musicians and I would just like
[17:11] to take a subject this morning brother
[17:15] Brandon preached a message uh things
[17:18] that are to be and we're all familiar
[17:20] with that we've actually preached on
[17:22] that quite extensively the last several
[17:24] Services um but I would like to change
[17:27] that a little bit in the morning I would
[17:28] like to take a topic of things that were
[17:32] so we'll obviously see that those are
[17:34] directly linked together but for the
[17:37] sake of a title and a subject that's
[17:39] what I would like to look at things that
[17:43] were and let's begin here in John 13
[17:48] beginning in verse
[17:51] 1 it says now before the Feast of the
[17:54] Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
[17:56] was come that he should depart out of
[17:59] this world unto the father having loved
[18:01] his own which were in the world he loved
[18:03] them until the end and supper being
[18:06] ended the devil having put into the
[18:08] heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to
[18:11] betray him Jesus knowing that the father
[18:14] had given all things into his hands and
[18:17] that he was come from God and went to
[18:20] God he riseth from supper and laid aside
[18:23] his garments and took a towel and garded
[18:26] himself and let's turn over to Matthew
[18:29] 17
[18:31] now read a portion of scripture there
[18:33] Matthew
[18:35] [Music]
[18:44] 17 verse 10 and it
[18:47] says and his disciples asked him saying
[18:51] why then say the scribes that Elias must
[18:55] first come and Jesus answered and said
[18:58] unto the them Elias truly shall first
[19:00] come and restore all things but I say
[19:04] unto you that Elias is already come and
[19:06] they knew him not but have done unto him
[19:08] whatsoever they listed likewise shall
[19:12] also the son of man suffer of them and
[19:15] then if we can turn to Revelation chap
[19:17] 10 very familiar portion of
[19:20] scripture for our last reading here
[19:23] Revelation chapter
[19:27] 10
[19:33] in verse
[19:38] 7 but in the days of the voice of the
[19:41] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[19:44] sound the mystery of God should be
[19:47] finished as he hath declared to his
[19:49] servants the prophets God bless you as
[19:52] you would have your
[19:54] seats so looking here in John 13
[19:59] says before the Feast of the Passover
[20:01] and there's a couple uh descriptions
[20:05] that are given in this portion of of
[20:07] scripture before the pie before the
[20:10] Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew
[20:14] his hour was come that he should depart
[20:17] out of the world unto the father so this
[20:20] is the time frame or this is the
[20:22] position that Jesus is now operating in
[20:25] he has come to a proper understanding
[20:28] that now is the time this juncture and
[20:32] time this is the time predetermined that
[20:36] I am to leave this world and I am to go
[20:38] unto my
[20:40] father having loved his own which were
[20:43] in the world he loved them unto the end
[20:44] and supper being ended the devil having
[20:46] put now Into the Heart of judas's
[20:49] scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus
[20:53] knowing that the father had given all
[20:55] things into his hands and that he was
[20:58] come from God and went to God so if
[21:02] you're following this pattern through
[21:03] the scriptures there is a junction there
[21:06] is a portion of time that Jesus comes to
[21:09] an understanding that now is the time
[21:12] that I am to depart from this world and
[21:15] go unto the father and there is a
[21:18] revelation that is directly linked to
[21:21] this juncture in time and this
[21:23] Revelation is contained in ch in verse
[21:25] three Jesus knowing the father had given
[21:29] all things unto his hands and that he
[21:32] was come from God and that he went to
[21:34] God so if we ever see this time period
[21:38] come again that there is a people on the
[21:40] face of the Earth who are coming to a
[21:42] recognition that now is the time that I
[21:45] am to depart out of this world and I am
[21:47] to go unto my father I would venture to
[21:51] say that this Revelation contained in
[21:53] chap in verse three is going to be very
[21:56] Paramount on their M on their mind
[21:58] mind because you're not going to depart
[22:01] out of this world and go unto the father
[22:04] if you do not have a proper
[22:05] understanding that the father has given
[22:08] all things into his hands and that I am
[22:10] come from God and that I'm going to God
[22:13] you're not going to go back to the
[22:15] father if you don't have a recognition
[22:17] that you came from the
[22:19] father so this Revelation I I find it
[22:24] astounding that this Revelation is
[22:27] mentioned here in this chapter because
[22:29] we know that Jesus uh brother brandom
[22:31] said he was 100% God and he was 100% man
[22:34] and he went to the Garden of the CMI and
[22:37] he sweated it out
[22:39] there and he made his decision
[22:43] there and he came to the
[22:45] conclusion brother Brandon says he went
[22:47] to Calvary with one scripture that he
[22:49] would not allow his holy one to see
[22:53] corruption but we know that through the
[22:57] the time line of events that immediately
[23:00] after this is stated in chapter 3 or I'm
[23:03] sorry in verse three immediately after
[23:06] that Jesus turns to
[23:08] Judas and he says what thou doest do
[23:15] quickly Jesus turning to Judas and
[23:17] saying what thou doest do
[23:20] quickly hinged solely on the Revelation
[23:24] contained in verse three he could not
[23:28] not have the courage and the ability to
[23:31] turn to Judas and say what thou doest do
[23:33] quick he knew what that was nobody else
[23:36] knew the disciples didn't even know but
[23:38] he knew when he turned and he loosed
[23:41] that demon to do what it was going to
[23:46] do he knew what the result of that was
[23:48] going to be he knew the suffering and
[23:50] the death that was going to come with
[23:52] that but this Revelation that was in him
[23:55] was so powerful and it was so
[23:58] overcoming that he could turn to the
[24:01] very one that was going to cost him his
[24:04] life knowing that he was operating in
[24:06] the plan of God and tell him what thou
[24:08] doest go do it quickly because I know
[24:11] where I come from and I know where I'm
[24:14] going and I recognize the hour that I'm
[24:17] in and it is now my time to depart from
[24:20] this world and go back to my father you
[24:22] are simply going to be the tool that is
[24:25] used to fulfill that plan this was not
[24:28] something that that Judas or Satan was
[24:31] overpowering Christ he had to have
[24:34] permission to do this this was a tool
[24:37] that he was going to use to further the
[24:39] plan of God but this was not an easy
[24:42] task this was not him telling him you
[24:46] know what thou doest do quickly and I'm
[24:48] going to have a bed of roses and Float
[24:50] off to the father there was great
[24:52] torture there was great suffering there
[24:54] was great sacrifice and pain that was
[24:56] going to come from this but there was an
[24:58] overcoming Revelation that Jesus had in
[25:02] the face of all of that to look that
[25:04] directly in the face and say I know
[25:07] where I come from and I know where I'm
[25:08] going and what thou doest do
[25:10] quickly and there's a people here on the
[25:12] face of this Earth in the in the closing
[25:14] moments of
[25:16] time that are going to face intense
[25:18] pressure on every hand and we Face
[25:21] intense pressure just in our daily lives
[25:23] but even we know there's a politically
[25:25] backed persecution and a religious
[25:27] persecution coming against the true
[25:28] bride but we can stand in the face of
[25:31] all of
[25:32] that just like Jesus
[25:35] stood and declare I know where I come
[25:38] from and I know where I'm going and
[25:39] furthermore I recognize that if you all
[25:42] are gathering yourselves together it's
[25:45] simply a fulfillment of scripture and
[25:46] it's an indication that the time is at
[25:48] hand that I must depart this world and
[25:50] go to my father I know where I come from
[25:54] and I know where I'm going and what you
[25:55] all are going to do do it do it
[25:58] quickly do it
[26:01] quickly looking here in
[26:03] Matthew it says in his disciples asked
[26:06] him saying why then say the scribes that
[26:08] Elias must first come and Jesus answered
[26:11] and said unto them Elias truly shall
[26:13] first come and this is very key here
[26:17] what is Elias to do when he comes Elias
[26:21] truly shall first come and restore all
[26:25] things this is a very broad term
[26:28] but let's compare this to John 13 what
[26:31] all things
[26:34] were Jesus knowing that the father had
[26:36] given all things into his
[26:39] hands and that he was come from God and
[26:41] that he went to God so the disciples are
[26:44] approaching Jesus and saying this is
[26:46] happening this is happening and this is
[26:48] happening but what about why are the
[26:49] scribes saying that Elias must first
[26:50] come he responds that's true Elias shall
[26:53] Truly Come and restore all things
[26:58] what is what what is this all things
[27:01] that Elias is to restore it is the
[27:04] proper understanding of our relationship
[27:07] to the
[27:08] father there were a lot of doctrines
[27:11] that brother brandom would come and that
[27:13] he would St restore there were a lot of
[27:15] lucans that he would come and that he
[27:17] would restore but and this is just my
[27:19] opinion you don't have to take it um but
[27:22] but to me that wasn't the
[27:25] purpose that wasn't the only purpose
[27:28] purpose there was a reason behind
[27:30] restoring the doctrines and the
[27:32] teachings and that was so that we could
[27:33] know where we stand and that we can have
[27:36] an understanding that this this man is
[27:39] not just pulling these things out of
[27:41] thin air he's not just making these
[27:43] things up this matches the scripture
[27:45] this matches the scripture this teaching
[27:47] that he has this is matching the
[27:48] scripture this is loose end that he's
[27:50] tying up this this matches in the Bible
[27:52] this matches the scripture and now we
[27:54] can start having faith in this ministry
[27:56] that is being presented to us but the
[27:59] point of that Ministry in my opinion was
[28:01] not to restore just the doctrines but it
[28:04] was to restore an understanding that I
[28:06] came from the father and that I'm going
[28:08] to the father and that I know who I am
[28:11] that I can now have the ability as Jesus
[28:13] did to know all things and knowing all
[28:16] things is not an ex an exhaustive list
[28:20] of all the topics in the Bible but I
[28:22] would term it as in what's most
[28:26] important what's most important what are
[28:28] these all things because you can have a
[28:32] proper understanding of a lot of the
[28:34] doctrines and still not have confidence
[28:36] in who you are and what good will it do
[28:40] you even Jesus would come and say I do
[28:43] nothing except for the father shows me
[28:46] so does he know all
[28:49] things that's another topic within
[28:51] itself we won't get into that but I just
[28:52] say that to make a point this is not an
[28:54] exhaustive list of having all the answ
[28:57] aners to all the questions this is
[28:59] knowing the main question this is having
[29:03] the answer to the main thing and brother
[29:05] Brandon would even go so far when he
[29:06] would conclude uh the church age book he
[29:08] would write this down and he says if I
[29:10] have one goal for my entire
[29:13] Ministry I have one goal for my entire
[29:16] Ministry and that is to put back a
[29:18] spiritual relationship between God and
[29:20] man he didn't say my goal was so that
[29:23] you would have all the answers to all
[29:25] the questions to all the doctrines to
[29:26] all the teaching
[29:28] he didn't even have that he would say
[29:30] that there was things that he didn't
[29:31] know there was things about the
[29:32] Millennium he didn't understand and the
[29:34] new heavens and new earth that he didn't
[29:35] understand there were things that he
[29:37] readily amended I don't understand this
[29:39] I don't have a proper understanding of
[29:40] this but the one thing that he knew for
[29:43] sure and that he could declare is that
[29:45] he wasn't the son of Charles anell
[29:46] Brenham
[29:48] anymore he says I thank God for that day
[29:51] for that Revelation that I recognized
[29:54] that knowing all things
[29:57] because I would just say this if we
[30:00] truly truly understand I'm not talking
[30:04] intellectually but I'm talking if we
[30:06] truly
[30:07] understand that I came from
[30:12] God and I am going back to
[30:16] God you tell me what else
[30:19] matters it's not that nothing else
[30:22] matters I'll say it this way what else
[30:24] matters as much as that
[30:26] right what's going to Trump that what's
[30:29] going to be more important than that
[30:31] what is going to be so powerful that it
[30:33] can overcome that
[30:35] nothing now that doesn't mean we're not
[30:37] going to have good days and we're going
[30:39] to have bad days because we we
[30:41] understand we live in a fallen condition
[30:43] but I'm talking at the end of the day
[30:44] when the rubber meets the
[30:47] road sir or when you're on your
[30:50] deathbed when things are getting
[30:54] real what's going to overcome that
[31:00] it's so powerful that
[31:02] Jesus could turn and loose all the
[31:05] devils in hell that were wanting to kill
[31:08] him for years he could turn and speak to
[31:12] them and say what thou doest do quickly
[31:15] even all the devils in Hell could not
[31:18] overcome that Revelation or could not
[31:19] Shake
[31:20] him he knew where he come from and he
[31:23] knew where he was
[31:24] going and brother uh and Jesus refer ing
[31:27] brother brandham the Elijah for our day
[31:29] he would make that comment of him that
[31:31] when he comes on the scene this this
[31:34] Revelation is going to be lost this
[31:37] knowledge of all things it's going to be
[31:39] lost but when he comes back on the scene
[31:42] his empasis is going to be restoring
[31:45] that Revelation to you so I to me like I
[31:48] said that's the important part of it is
[31:51] we can get so tangled up in the
[31:53] doctrines and the teachings and maybe
[31:56] miss the point of the the
[31:57] message uh the point of the message is
[32:00] to identify you the reason that he
[32:03] brought the teachings of the doctrines
[32:04] is you could be drawn to that so you
[32:07] could have faith in
[32:13] that Revelation 10:7 it says but in the
[32:17] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[32:19] when he shall begin to
[32:20] sound we know this is the same Ministry
[32:23] that Jesus referred to of Elijah the
[32:26] mystery of God should be finished not
[32:29] Mysteries the mystery of God should be
[32:35] finished well if you're a part of God
[32:38] and he's bringing a proper understanding
[32:40] to to you of where you came from and
[32:43] where you're going that finishes the
[32:45] mystery you remember brother Brandon
[32:47] would come and he would say the thing
[32:49] that I wondered about all my
[32:53] life not the things that I wondered
[32:56] about all my my life the thing that I
[32:59] wondered about all my life says I don't
[33:01] wonder about that
[33:02] anymore the mystery should be finished
[33:06] why is that so important because there's
[33:08] nothing else going to Trump that mystery
[33:11] when you have that
[33:13] Revelation so with that in mind I would
[33:15] like to just look at a few scriptures
[33:17] here and I just pray that you would
[33:19] relax this morning I don't have an
[33:21] agenda I don't have a doctrine that I'm
[33:23] trying to force on anybody to be quite
[33:25] Frank with you it's just the
[33:26] Thanksgiving season and I've got a bunch
[33:28] of quotes here that I'm thankful for and
[33:29] half of them I don't even really
[33:31] understand but it I know it's true and
[33:35] I'm thankful for them so maybe I should
[33:37] have just titled this can I share some
[33:39] quotes with you um and you make out of
[33:42] them whatever you want to make out of
[33:43] them but I uh we was talking about this
[33:46] with brother Chad several weeks ago and
[33:48] I asked him the question I said how is
[33:50] it that something that I really have no
[33:52] clue about Thrills my heart so much
[33:55] because I can't take this this and tie
[33:57] it all together and present it in a
[33:58] PowerPoint of this this this and you you
[34:00] get it there's things that brother
[34:02] brandom says here that I I don't even
[34:04] understand but I know it's true and it
[34:05] rings true in my soul and it Thrills me
[34:08] to no end so I want to approach this not
[34:11] as you know this is the way it is and
[34:13] this is the way it's got to be um but I
[34:15] just want to approach this by you know
[34:17] what do you what do you think about this
[34:19] um how does this make you feel uh
[34:21] because there's comments that he makes
[34:23] here that are so astounding and
[34:25] overwhelming and even intellectually you
[34:27] can't wrap your mind around it but it
[34:30] does my soul good because I know it's
[34:32] true but I want to read this scripture
[34:34] before we would jump into these quotes I
[34:35] want to read this scripture in
[34:37] Ecclesiastes uh chapter 1 and verse 5
[34:41] Ecclesiastes 1 and
[34:44] 5 it says The Sun Also ariseth and the
[34:49] sun goeth down and hasteth to his place
[34:55] where he arose
[34:57] the wind goeth towards the South and
[35:00] turneth about unto the north it whth
[35:02] about continually and the wind returneth
[35:05] again according to its circuits all the
[35:09] rivers run into the sea yet the sea is
[35:11] not full unto the place from which the
[35:12] rivers come tither they return
[35:17] again all things are full of Labor man
[35:21] cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied
[35:24] with seeing nor the ear filled with
[35:26] hearing
[35:28] the thing that hath
[35:30] been it is that which shall
[35:34] be and that which is done is that which
[35:37] shall be
[35:39] done and there is no new thing under the
[35:43] sun is there anything whereof it may be
[35:46] said see this is new it hath been
[35:51] already of old time which was before us
[35:56] so the the context of that is the sun
[35:58] comes up and the Sun goes back to where
[35:59] it came from the wind bloweth and it
[36:02] goes back to where it come from the
[36:04] waters move about and it goes back to
[36:06] where it come from and then he brings it
[36:08] into the person and he says the things
[36:11] the thing that hath been that which
[36:14] shall be it is that which shall be and
[36:17] that which is done is that which shall
[36:19] be done and there is no new thing under
[36:22] the sun there is no new thing Under the
[36:28] Sun so let me ask you this is your
[36:31] positional placing in Christ Under the
[36:34] Sun now you you're living on this Earth
[36:37] You are literally Under the Sun and the
[36:40] scripture says there is no new thing
[36:42] under the
[36:43] Sun so if your position in Christ is now
[36:47] being manifested underneath of the
[36:49] literal sun and the scripture is saying
[36:51] that that position is not new it was
[36:54] before just like the sun it's got to go
[36:57] back to where it came from it's the wind
[36:58] it's got to go back to where it came
[37:00] from the waters return from where they
[37:02] come from your placing is not new to
[37:06] Christ it may be new to you but it's not
[37:09] new to
[37:11] Christ is there anything whereever it
[37:14] may be said see this is new it hath been
[37:17] already of old
[37:20] time which was before
[37:23] us I say praise the Lord for that amen
[37:27] John
[37:30] 6:60 many therefore of his disciples
[37:34] when they had heard it heard this said
[37:37] this is a hard saying who can hear it
[37:39] this was when Jesus was going through
[37:40] the list and telling them I'm the bread
[37:42] that came down from heaven um and so
[37:45] forth when Jesus knew in himself that
[37:48] his disciples murmured at it he said
[37:50] unto them doth this offend you what and
[37:54] if ye shall see the son of man Ascend up
[37:57] where he was
[38:00] before it is the spirit that quickeneth
[38:03] the flesh profiteth nothing the words
[38:06] that I speak unto you they are spirit
[38:07] and they are life but there are some of
[38:10] you that believe
[38:12] not for Jesus knew from the beginning
[38:15] who they were that believed not and who
[38:18] should betray him and he said therefore
[38:22] said I unto you that no man can come
[38:24] unto me except it were given unto him of
[38:27] my father so Jesus is here declaring
[38:30] himself plainly before them and he's
[38:33] asking you know does this offend you
[38:35] what I've said about my position and he
[38:37] says well if that offends you what will
[38:38] you do and what will you say when I
[38:40] Ascend back up from where I come
[38:45] from and he says there are some of you
[38:48] that believe not for Jesus knew from the
[38:51] beginning who they were that believed
[38:53] not and who should betray him Jesus knew
[38:57] from the beginning I'm venturing to say
[38:59] that this wasn't from the beginning when
[39:01] he met them on the earth Jesus knew from
[39:05] the
[39:07] beginning Jesus knew from the beginning
[39:10] who would not believe and who would
[39:12] betray him well if that's true in the
[39:14] negative it's got to be true in the
[39:15] positive if he knew in the beginning who
[39:18] was not going to believe him surely he
[39:20] knew who would believe
[39:25] him
[39:27] and Jesus references this he says
[39:29] therefore said unto you that no man can
[39:31] come unto me except it were given unto
[39:33] him of my
[39:36] father in John 1 verse1 it says in the
[39:39] beginning was the word and the Word was
[39:40] with God and the Word was God the same
[39:42] was in the beginning with
[39:44] God all
[39:47] things listen to the terminology all
[39:51] things were made by him and without him
[39:54] was not anything made that was made
[39:57] in him was life and the life was the
[40:00] light of men all things were made by him
[40:04] when Elijah is to come he's to restore
[40:06] all things Jesus when he was here
[40:08] knowing all
[40:10] things this things is an interesting
[40:13] term because even when the Holy when the
[40:16] scriptures would speak of Jesus coming
[40:18] to this earth the angel would speak to
[40:21] Mary and it told her that that Holy
[40:25] thing
[40:27] that Holy thing that you shall give
[40:30] birth to it'll be called
[40:33] Emanuel that Holy thing a that thing was
[40:36] a person that thing was the Lord Jesus
[40:39] Christ but even in the scriptures it's
[40:41] recorded as a
[40:44] thing so in verse three here it says all
[40:47] things were made by him I'm just going
[40:49] to put myself in there because if it if
[40:53] if Jesus could be called a thing I can
[40:55] be called a thing
[40:57] all things were made by him I was made
[41:00] by
[41:01] him and without him was not anything
[41:04] made that was
[41:06] made I want to read this quote out of
[41:11] the uncertain sound
[41:14] 1960 brother brandom said and they just
[41:17] found out recently that your body is
[41:18] full of light ex-ray proves that the
[41:22] X-ray does not have any light of its own
[41:24] it's the light it's your light that it
[41:27] uses you're born with four Rays after a
[41:32] while say 2025 one ray goes out and 35
[41:35] another or 40 another one goes out and
[41:38] finally when you get past 65 you're
[41:39] living on your last Ray and every time
[41:42] you take an x-ray picture you're tearing
[41:44] them Rays down that's the reason you
[41:47] don't have no more you stick these kids
[41:49] feet in these machines because it's just
[41:51] tearing the Rays right out of their
[41:52] little bodies and that's Cosmic light
[41:55] that's in you
[41:57] that you're made up of full of light
[42:00] cells now that's Cosmic light he's
[42:02] talking about the natural body and an
[42:05] x-ray not producing the light that your
[42:07] body actually contains light within
[42:09] itself to form that x-ray he says that
[42:13] is Cosmic light but God is a different
[42:17] light but yet he's light now I think
[42:21] that that picture there is great proof
[42:23] of what I'm fixing to say I wasn't there
[42:25] when he was preaching this but I'm
[42:27] guessing to say he's talking about the
[42:28] picture of the pillar of fire above his
[42:30] head he says now I think that that
[42:33] picture there is great proof of what I'm
[42:35] fixing to say that God is light and when
[42:40] we were walking in light of God as sons
[42:44] of God God is Not Cosmic light but God's
[42:50] light operated through the cosmic light
[42:53] of our bodies our cells we were
[42:57] absolutely at one time real genuine sons
[43:01] of God but then when the fall
[43:05] came like seaweed you get in the bottom
[43:08] of a sea a lot of time divers and
[43:10] they'll get under this seaweed and
[43:12] before they know it they're wrapped up
[43:14] in such a way that they can't get out
[43:16] that's what the sin has done to the
[43:18] human being that's the way coldness has
[43:21] done to the church that's the way
[43:22] communist has done to the nation it's so
[43:25] treacherous and in the human body it's
[43:27] wrapped us up it's pushing out this
[43:29] light of God by denominations and
[43:32] denying the faith and so forth It's
[43:33] pushed out all the Rays of God's great
[43:36] power the power of Faith see that's in
[43:38] us that should be they've pushed all
[43:41] those Rays out in such a place till we
[43:43] just got to a lodge and then now below
[43:46] the lodge the church is cuz it's just
[43:48] pushed all the darkness out and even
[43:50] just saying it doesn't happen denying
[43:52] that it could happen see the miracles of
[43:55] god so brother Branda makes the comment
[43:57] that's just astounding to me that before
[44:01] we were here he says God we were
[44:04] absolutely at one time real genuine sons
[44:09] of
[44:10] God in so much that
[44:14] we that God's light the light of God not
[44:19] Cosmic light but the Holy Light Of God
[44:22] could
[44:23] operate through he says our body
[44:26] and ourselves now like I said before I
[44:29] do not understand this but I believe
[44:33] it I do not understand this but I
[44:36] believe this and we know that brother
[44:38] brandham taught us that in before the
[44:41] beginning all the way back if we would
[44:43] just uh put it in our own human Minds as
[44:46] far back as we could go that we were
[44:50] thoughts in the mind of God and he would
[44:53] express that to us that those thoughts
[44:55] are not like like man's thoughts but
[44:57] God's thoughts are
[44:59] real not like man's thoughts God's
[45:03] thoughts were
[45:06] real so we know that he taught us that
[45:09] but then he would come and and make this
[45:11] comment that not not only were we
[45:15] thoughts but were we thoughts but we
[45:18] were so
[45:20] real to the point that we had bodies we
[45:23] had cells and that God light could work
[45:27] through
[45:28] that now I can't say that that's still
[45:31] in thought form because I don't know my
[45:34] thoughts are not like God's thoughts
[45:36] this could still be in thought form but
[45:38] because God's thoughts are real this
[45:40] could still transpire humanly thinking
[45:43] when I when I see the terminology bodies
[45:46] and cells I say that's not a thought
[45:50] that's something that's
[45:51] manifested but remember our thoughts are
[45:53] not like God's thoughts you know we have
[45:56] the little cartoon drawing of the man
[45:58] sitting here and he's got a little
[45:59] bubble coming up out of his head and
[46:01] he's got his thought there like he's
[46:02] thinking
[46:03] something well that's not God's thoughts
[46:07] when God has a thought it's
[46:09] real it's it's brother Brandon says it's
[46:13] not like a contractor who would think of
[46:15] a project and start laying out pieces of
[46:17] that project when God has a thought of
[46:20] the project the project is there the
[46:21] project is real the project is complete
[46:24] in so much that the scriptures to could
[46:26] declare that the lamb was slain in the
[46:28] mind of God before the foundation of the
[46:30] world that was not frivolous that was
[46:34] real and again I say this without a real
[46:37] clear understanding of what I'm even
[46:39] talking about but a prophet knows what
[46:41] he's talking about and a prophet would
[46:43] declare to
[46:46] us that even I would say it this way
[46:50] even if he's still
[46:52] referencing that this is in thought form
[46:55] these thought forms were not flippant
[46:58] thoughts and I just want to emphasize
[47:00] that that God's thoughts are not like
[47:03] our thoughts so we don't want when when
[47:06] brother Brandon would would say that
[47:08] that in in the mind of God uh that we
[47:11] were thoughts in the mind of God I don't
[47:14] know that we fully give that the weight
[47:16] that we
[47:18] should because that's the answer to the
[47:20] devil's
[47:23] question knowing that we were in the
[47:26] mind of
[47:28] God knowing that we were real brother BR
[47:31] says real genuine sons of
[47:35] God
[47:37] now again as humans when we see this
[47:40] terminology sons of God we automatically
[47:42] think a person a human being a son or a
[47:46] daughter but remember brother brandham
[47:48] taught us that a son the the word son
[47:51] simply means something that came out of
[47:53] the
[47:54] father so the word son does not
[47:57] necessarily have to mean here in the
[48:00] form that I am in now I'm a son of
[48:01] Michael seabolt a son is simply
[48:04] something that came out of the father
[48:07] whatever form that may be in whether
[48:10] that's in a theophany form whether
[48:12] that's in a thought form whether that's
[48:15] in brother Brandon would say one of
[48:16] these little clinkers that spun off of
[48:18] God that spun off the logos whatever
[48:21] form that is it's still a Son of God and
[48:24] again I stand here not an expert or
[48:26] author Authority on this subject but I
[48:29] know enough and brother brandham has
[48:30] said enough that this is real you call
[48:33] it a clinker if you want to you call it
[48:35] a thought if you want to you call it uh
[48:38] a
[48:56] that you could put on the condescension
[48:58] of God and of the sons of
[49:02] God but at the end of the day when we
[49:05] track all of that
[49:09] back brother brandom says that God had
[49:13] you in his thoughts and his thoughts
[49:16] were
[49:17] real they were
[49:22] real not flippant thoughts not something
[49:25] that may be or may not be but thoughts
[49:28] that were
[49:30] real and I believe through the preaching
[49:33] and the teaching of the message that it
[49:36] has brought us back to that
[49:38] understanding to give us that
[49:42] confidence the ability to believe the
[49:46] word that has come through this
[49:50] ministry that is that is a rare
[49:54] occurrence that is not something that we
[49:57] should be take that we should take
[49:59] lightly the ability to hear from the
[50:03] father through the message of this hour
[50:06] and the capability to believe
[50:09] it means one
[50:11] thing that you had to have been there
[50:14] and you had to have been real
[50:19] before continuing in this same quote he
[50:21] says well that's the way I'm sorry let
[50:24] me skip down he says and yet yet the man
[50:26] somewhere down in him he's he's talking
[50:28] after the fall came and we get all
[50:31] tangled up in seawe like a diver does he
[50:33] says and yet the man somewhere down in
[50:36] him somewhere in him as I Illustrated it
[50:39] like a
[50:41] button when a man is saved that much of
[50:45] him is
[50:46] God that's the little light that comes
[50:49] in so he's saying at your new birth when
[50:53] you're saved he says there is a light
[50:56] that comes in like a
[50:59] button that light comes in to make him
[51:02] quit doing what's wrong he says now if
[51:05] you can take all of the malice and envy
[51:07] and strife and unbelief out if you can
[51:10] take all of that out that little button
[51:13] like of the light and power of
[51:16] God will keep
[51:20] growing so again we know that our new
[51:23] birth is not the end go our new birth is
[51:26] just the starting point and brother
[51:28] brandom says that when you are born
[51:30] again you have the light of God come
[51:32] into you and it's about like a button
[51:34] but if you will continue to die out to
[51:36] yourself and that you will clear this
[51:38] out of your life the envy and the strife
[51:40] and the unbelief that light will
[51:43] continue to grow in your
[51:46] being it'll be it will keep growing
[51:49] growing growing growing crowding out
[51:51] unbelief and you don't do it by
[51:54] exhortations of bodily exercise you do
[51:57] it by a Sanctified consecrated life that
[52:00] the holy spirit moves through
[52:03] you he says I caught some of it in a
[52:06] place not long
[52:08] ago how many ever remembers Elijah Perry
[52:12] was raised from the dead that morning
[52:13] some of you over here he says I caught
[52:16] some of that not too long ago in a place
[52:18] and he starts referencing this
[52:21] testimony he had been dead several hours
[52:23] he died with hemorrhages of the lungs
[52:25] and he was so bloody all over and I
[52:27] started to walk away from the bed and I
[52:29] felt somebody lay their hand on me I
[52:32] thought it was sister schaer and when I
[52:35] turned there was nobody around me and I
[52:37] started to move away this way then I
[52:40] felt that hand again and I turned back
[52:42] it wouldn't get off of me and before I
[52:44] know what I was doing I was laying on
[52:46] top of that man with my lips against his
[52:48] lips and I was as bloody as he was
[52:51] laying there on that man crying out to
[52:53] God and I felt something come up up
[52:55] around the side of my ear it was his
[52:57] hand you've heard him stand right here
[53:00] and testify of it so brother Brandon is
[53:03] making this comment of the light of God
[53:05] working through our being and that when
[53:07] we're born again this light of God will
[53:09] come into this manifestation of our
[53:11] being and he says I ran into some of it
[53:13] a little while ago and then he gives a
[53:15] testimony of the result of that we have
[53:17] a dead man coming back to life the light
[53:20] of God working through the being and he
[53:23] says Readers Digest picked it up and in
[53:26] America here we got it wrote out here in
[53:29] the reader digest where they had
[53:30] examined for Divine Healing and they
[53:33] took a brother that prayed for the sick
[53:35] and had a sick man and had him praying
[53:37] for the sick and then they put a piece
[53:39] of lead foil anyone knows lead foil
[53:42] reflects that Ray upon between the man
[53:46] and that man that was praying the
[53:47] brother it laid it down like this and
[53:50] shot the picture of the X-ray and from
[53:52] the man's hand showed a visible
[53:55] reflection of a ray coming out of his
[53:57] hand going to the other
[54:00] man so this is this is not just a good
[54:05] thought even though it is a good thought
[54:07] now brother brandom is saying that
[54:09] science has even picked this up science
[54:11] is even testifying to the fact that when
[54:14] somebody is interceding for a brother
[54:16] for another person and they are praying
[54:19] the prayer of faith there is literally a
[54:22] measurable amount of life going from
[54:26] that individual into that other
[54:33] individual God know God knew what he
[54:36] meant when he said they shall lay hands
[54:37] on the sick and they shall recover
[54:40] laying on of hands of this man upon a
[54:42] sick man and the mechanical x-ray
[54:44] showing the light coming from the man's
[54:46] hand he says someday this is just
[54:50] Thrills my soul he says someday you're
[54:54] going to find out that God is in you
[54:57] prise
[55:01] God I say let it be today Let It Be This
[55:06] Day science has progressed so far to the
[55:10] so far that they're picking up on these
[55:13] Supernatural uh Transmissions of light
[55:16] and brother Brandon would compile all of
[55:18] that and come and make the point to us
[55:20] that all of this is happening that so
[55:22] that someday me and you can come to the
[55:25] recognition that God is in you that's
[55:29] the point let's not get confused by the
[55:32] terminology or the manifestations the
[55:35] thought the theophany the clinker let's
[55:37] come back to the point of the matter and
[55:39] the point of the matter is that somehow
[55:42] some way God is dwelling in mortal
[55:45] [Applause]
[55:46] flesh and it can not only have an effect
[55:49] on my mortal flesh but once I come to a
[55:53] recognition of all things
[55:55] things and that I come from God and that
[55:58] I'm going to God now I can start having
[56:01] a positive effect and a positive outflow
[56:04] on my brothers and
[56:08] sisters 1957 questions and answers
[56:11] brother brandham
[56:12] says now when he the logos went out of
[56:15] God which was God coming from this one
[56:18] big Fountain into a body in the form of
[56:21] a man and it made the logos which we
[56:23] call theophany now if you take the
[56:26] theophany when you're looking at that
[56:28] that's a man now that's where we were in
[56:30] the beginning now you do not understand
[56:33] it now but you were back there in the
[56:36] beginning that way when God made Man In
[56:40] His Image he made him a theophany and he
[56:43] only placed him in flesh so that he
[56:46] could till the soil could touch that
[56:48] theophany doesn't touch it doesn't see
[56:50] taste smell hear these senses that we
[56:53] have so God put me stand down here in
[56:56] order to touch and to feel and as he
[57:00] walked through the garden first as a
[57:01] theophany like the holy spirit is in
[57:04] here now walking in here he led the
[57:07] animal life it controlled everything but
[57:10] it couldn't till the soil so God put him
[57:13] in flesh so that he could till the soil
[57:16] he gave him five senses to till the soil
[57:18] and fix up The Vineyards and so forth
[57:21] then the man still looked Lonesome
[57:23] skipping down several paragraphs he says
[57:26] what do we do well my dear sainted
[57:29] brother my dear sainted sister before
[57:31] the foundation of the world when God
[57:33] created You In His Image he made you a
[57:37] theophany just like himself when he said
[57:41] let us to the creatures that he had made
[57:43] let us make man in our own image in our
[57:45] likeness a
[57:53] theophonic cried Lord let me see you he
[57:56] said go Yonder and hide in the Rock in
[57:57] the cliff and Moses got back in that
[58:00] cliff and when God passed by the
[58:02] lightning and thundering and as God
[58:04] passed by he had his back turned like
[58:06] this and Moses said it was the back of a
[58:10] man now there you are that's the way we
[58:14] are here we came from a higher being in
[58:18] the beginning we were in the image of
[58:23] God the V hell and the Darkness keeps us
[58:27] from knowing it
[58:29] now so I feel very confident when I come
[58:32] and tell you that I don't understand
[58:34] these things the way that I should
[58:35] understand them brother brandham says
[58:36] the veil and the Darkness keeps us from
[58:38] knowing these things
[58:42] now and I don't know that we will ever
[58:44] come to a perfect understanding of this
[58:48] we may we may not I don't
[58:50] know but brother brandom is clearly
[58:53] saying that there is a a veil there is a
[58:55] Darkness that's keeping us from knowing
[58:58] this the way that we used to know
[59:01] it but it doesn't change the fact that
[59:05] we were there in the
[59:08] capacity that he said we were
[59:11] there so even if the veil in the
[59:13] darkness would keep me from having a
[59:16] complete perfect understanding of that
[59:18] what understanding that has been brought
[59:20] to me I want to hold on to with my
[59:23] life because it is that Revelation that
[59:27] has the overcoming power it is that
[59:29] Revelation that is going to Trump all
[59:31] things it is that Revelation when I come
[59:34] to the day and the hour that I know that
[59:36] it is my time to depart from this world
[59:38] and go to the father it is that
[59:40] Revelation that's going to literally
[59:42] change this
[59:45] body if we need a perfect understanding
[59:49] of what he's talking about here that
[59:50] darkness and that Veil will be removed
[59:52] for us I don't think it's something that
[59:54] we have have to force into I don't think
[59:56] it's something that we have to make up
[59:57] or act like that we understand I think
[1:00:00] we can be comfortable saying I don't
[1:00:01] completely understand this but it
[1:00:02] doesn't change the fact that I was a
[1:00:04] real genuine Son of God before and I
[1:00:08] came from the father and I'm going to
[1:00:10] the
[1:00:11] father he says you can't know it now but
[1:00:14] you was in the beginning and if that he
[1:00:17] starts quoting scripture and if this
[1:00:19] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[1:00:22] one already waiting Hallelujah and then
[1:00:24] we move into this theophany what we once
[1:00:28] lived so we can eat and Shake
[1:00:33] Hands questions and answers on Genesis
[1:00:38] 1953 brother randam says now the first
[1:00:40] man now he made the first man in His
[1:00:42] image and we are returning back to that
[1:00:45] image that's right to our first created
[1:00:49] image when God created me William
[1:00:51] brandham I was before the foundation of
[1:00:54] the world
[1:00:55] he made my being he made my spirit I
[1:00:58] wasn't conscious of anything as far as I
[1:01:00] know of but I was there and that's all
[1:01:04] that I'm saying this
[1:01:06] morning I may not be conscious of
[1:01:08] anything but I was there oh I don't
[1:01:13] believe you're getting it but Jesus told
[1:01:16] the disciples that he knew them before
[1:01:18] the foundation of the
[1:01:21] world and Paul said here that he chose
[1:01:23] us in him before the world began now
[1:01:27] there was some part of me and Orman
[1:01:30] Neville and the rest of you all here
[1:01:32] that's in Christ Jesus before the world
[1:01:35] begin and here's to my analysis of that
[1:01:39] I think that the people today that are
[1:01:41] possessed with this Spirit a part of
[1:01:44] these Angelic beings Spirits which
[1:01:47] rotated off of God that never fell in
[1:01:50] the beginning and resisted the devil's
[1:01:53] lie in heaven
[1:01:56] he calls it a
[1:01:59] theophonic being but my favorite thing
[1:02:02] is he says some part of
[1:02:05] me some part of me call it what you want
[1:02:08] but some part of me was so real that
[1:02:11] God's light could work through my being
[1:02:14] in so much that I could resist the
[1:02:16] devil's lie in
[1:02:23] heaven
[1:02:25] we
[1:02:27] wonder how that
[1:02:29] we have overcome the things in our life
[1:02:32] the trials the tribulation the hardships
[1:02:35] the broken hearts the false teachings
[1:02:37] the false doctrines the false Ministries
[1:02:41] the the horrendous things the abuse
[1:02:44] that's happened to each and every one of
[1:02:49] us why didn't those snuff out our light
[1:02:54] why why didn't those put an end to us
[1:02:56] that's
[1:02:58] right because it
[1:03:00] can't it didn't in the beginning and it
[1:03:04] can't
[1:03:07] now we wonder
[1:03:09] how did I overcome the darkness that I
[1:03:12] was stuck
[1:03:13] in and we each individual has different
[1:03:18] circumstances that we were stuck
[1:03:20] in some false churches some false
[1:03:23] teachings some vices whatever the case
[1:03:26] may be some just in our own self our own
[1:03:29] genetic makeup our own complexes how did
[1:03:32] we overcome all of
[1:03:34] this we couldn't be stuck in that
[1:03:37] condition Saints because we were not
[1:03:38] Darkness to begin with we were light to
[1:03:42] begin
[1:03:43] with we cannot be stuck in darkness
[1:03:47] that's how we've overcome it wasn't
[1:03:49] because that we tried harder that we did
[1:03:51] better that we made a decision here or
[1:03:52] we made a decision there no God made a
[1:03:56] decision and even if we make a decision
[1:03:59] now it's because we've made a decision
[1:04:01] then before
[1:04:03] now to resist the devil's lie while we
[1:04:05] were in
[1:04:07] heaven as the scripture says there's
[1:04:09] nothing new Under the Sun there's
[1:04:12] nothing new going on here what has been
[1:04:15] is what
[1:04:19] is you can't keep light in darkness you
[1:04:22] can't snuff out light by Darkness
[1:04:25] even if it's just a little sliver of
[1:04:27] light it's always more powerful than
[1:04:29] Darkness even a little sliver of Truth
[1:04:32] is always always going to Trump false it
[1:04:37] may take years it may take decades but
[1:04:38] that doesn't matter at the end of the
[1:04:41] day what has been will be and we thank
[1:04:45] God for that
[1:04:47] Revelation Christ is the mystery Christ
[1:04:49] is the mystery of God revealed brother
[1:04:51] Brandon speaking he says so you can see
[1:04:53] here basically in the beginning the very
[1:04:55] thought that God had in his mind he hid
[1:04:58] it from all of these Scholars and just a
[1:05:01] selected predestinated number was the
[1:05:04] only ones that heard
[1:05:07] it past tense heard
[1:05:11] it let me back up he says so you can see
[1:05:14] here basically in the
[1:05:17] beginning the very thought that God had
[1:05:19] in his mind he hid it from all of those
[1:05:23] Scholars
[1:05:25] and just a selected predestinated number
[1:05:28] was the only ones that heard it again
[1:05:32] past
[1:05:33] tense and now search back through the
[1:05:36] scriptures down through the age of the
[1:05:37] prophets and see if it wasn't the same
[1:05:39] thing and Jesus here referring to them
[1:05:43] to the prophets and to the Psalms he
[1:05:45] says they all spoke of him and here
[1:05:48] these Jewish Jewish teachers rabbis
[1:05:52] doctors of the law Prof
[1:05:54] professors listen to this had did
[1:05:58] exactly like they had done
[1:06:06] before the people that were manifested
[1:06:10] in human flesh in the days that Jesus
[1:06:13] was physically walking the Earth brother
[1:06:15] random says the Jewish teachers rabbis
[1:06:19] doctors of the law professors had did
[1:06:22] exactly like they had done
[1:06:27] before their decision did not change
[1:06:31] simply because they became manifested on
[1:06:34] the earth their decision had already
[1:06:37] been made they had already made a
[1:06:39] decision
[1:06:40] before if that is true in the negative
[1:06:43] how can it not be true in the positive
[1:06:45] for
[1:06:48] us the indictment this is not just one
[1:06:51] time that brother Brandon mentions this
[1:06:53] he mentions it multi multiple times he
[1:06:55] says in the indictment guilty of
[1:06:57] crucifying him sure I indict this
[1:07:01] generation finding them Guilty by the
[1:07:04] same word that found them guilty at the
[1:07:09] beginning when did he say that they
[1:07:11] crucified him at the beginning what did
[1:07:13] he say that they did exactly like they
[1:07:15] had done before they crucified
[1:07:17] him by the same word that found them
[1:07:20] guilty at the beginning that's right
[1:07:23] Jesus said who can condemn me he was the
[1:07:26] word made flesh and today the same word
[1:07:29] is made flesh what same word the same
[1:07:32] word that was in the beginning that they
[1:07:33] crucified then how did they crucify it
[1:07:36] how did they crucify it then they belied
[1:07:38] the devil's lie but there was a group of
[1:07:41] people that didn't believe the devil's
[1:07:42] lie who heard the thoughts of God and
[1:07:45] who resisted
[1:07:47] that and they'll make the same decision
[1:07:50] now that they're manifested even in
[1:07:52] hybrid flesh they will make the the same
[1:07:54] decision now that we made back then the
[1:07:57] same as the scribes and Pharisees did
[1:07:59] the children of God will make the same
[1:08:01] decision that they made
[1:08:02] them if it's true for them it's true for
[1:08:07] us back in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:08:09] revealed brother brandom says and
[1:08:11] they're going to bring a persecution on
[1:08:13] pretty soon and shut up all the churches
[1:08:15] you see that and churches like this who
[1:08:17] is not denomination they'll use them for
[1:08:19] a storehouse anything and if any man
[1:08:21] goes and offer a prayer for anybody else
[1:08:23] that don't belong to the ecumenical
[1:08:25] movement will be shot on the spot it's
[1:08:27] already ready
[1:08:29] that that Lutheran Minister the head of
[1:08:31] it said so and it's right here you can
[1:08:34] read it right here in your magazine
[1:08:36] don't make any difference what they say
[1:08:38] that church will stand true in the fight
[1:08:41] he's saying it doesn't matter what the
[1:08:43] ecumenical movement will do the church
[1:08:45] is going to stand true in the fight he
[1:08:47] says she's already proved it back
[1:08:52] Yonder sh and she'll do it
[1:08:59] again again I I don't have a clear
[1:09:02] understanding of that I don't remember
[1:09:04] making that decision I don't remember
[1:09:06] resisting the devil's lie in heaven but
[1:09:08] brother brandom says that I've already
[1:09:10] proved it the reason that I will stand
[1:09:12] today is I've already proved it back
[1:09:14] Yonder and that I will do it
[1:09:19] again I'm not even here to say that
[1:09:21] we've only made this decision twice and
[1:09:24] that we've only resisted the devil twice
[1:09:26] in the thoughts of God and here now I
[1:09:29] don't know what transpires in between
[1:09:31] that time frame we may have already
[1:09:33] fought this battle a hundred times but I
[1:09:36] know we've at least fought it twice then
[1:09:39] and now and the outcome whether it's
[1:09:42] twice or whether it's 200 million
[1:09:44] million times the outcome is not going
[1:09:47] to
[1:09:48] change what we did then is what we are
[1:09:51] going to do now the same as the scribes
[1:09:54] and Pharisees had made their decision
[1:09:56] then for the negative we have made our
[1:09:59] decision for the
[1:10:01] positive he says she'll do it again in
[1:10:04] the face of everything it's the word of
[1:10:07] God 1960 the unfailing realities of the
[1:10:10] Living God brother brandom says let me
[1:10:12] say one more thing Creeds does not
[1:10:14] satisfy a Hungry Heart if a man is
[1:10:17] hungering for him you hungering for God
[1:10:20] you tell him say the Apostles Creed join
[1:10:22] the church put your name on here be
[1:10:24] sprinkled or immersed or whatever you
[1:10:25] want that will never satisfy a hungry
[1:10:28] Soul cuz they were predestinated of God
[1:10:31] to search for life they were once the
[1:10:35] Angels who did not fall 2third of the
[1:10:38] angels of heaven fell that's these evil
[1:10:41] spirits working amongst people very
[1:10:44] religious you know the Bible says that
[1:10:47] you was not just all always right here
[1:10:51] you were once somewhere El
[1:10:56] else I say praise the Lord I'm thankful
[1:10:58] for
[1:10:59] that I was not always just right here I
[1:11:04] was once somewhere
[1:11:08] else John
[1:11:11] 643 Jesus therefore therefore answered
[1:11:14] see this is not just brother Brandon
[1:11:16] making up a good thought or making up a
[1:11:18] good comment this is scriptural right
[1:11:21] John 6:43 Jesus therefore answered and
[1:11:23] said unto him murmur not among
[1:11:25] yourselves no man can come to me except
[1:11:28] the Father which hath sent me draw him
[1:11:30] and I will raise him up at the last day
[1:11:34] it is written in the prophets and they
[1:11:36] shall be all taught of God every man
[1:11:40] therefore that hath
[1:11:42] heard that hath heard and hath learned
[1:11:46] of the father cometh unto me we've spoke
[1:11:50] on this before so I don't I'm not going
[1:11:51] to spend a lot of time on it but as I
[1:11:53] said this is not just some thought that
[1:11:56] brother brandom is throwing out there to
[1:11:58] excite the people or to get a response
[1:11:59] this is scriptural hath heard hath
[1:12:03] learned past
[1:12:05] tense he says not that any man hath seen
[1:12:10] the father save he which is of god
[1:12:12] meaning except he which is of god he
[1:12:16] hath seen the
[1:12:19] father you hath been taught you hath
[1:12:22] learned and you hath seen the father how
[1:12:26] I don't know but it doesn't change the
[1:12:30] truth in the future home brother brandom
[1:12:33] says you become a new person not just an
[1:12:36] old one patched up by joining the church
[1:12:38] or trying to turn a new page but you are
[1:12:41] a complete brand new unit God takes the
[1:12:44] old man and burns him completely out
[1:12:47] with a holy ghost in Fire and comes down
[1:12:50] himself sends down your represent
[1:12:55] resentation sends down your
[1:13:01] representation no then he starts quoting
[1:13:04] scripture no man can come to me except
[1:13:07] my father hath drawn him and all the
[1:13:09] father hath given me will come to me
[1:13:15] amen speaking of the new birth brother
[1:13:18] brandom says when that transpires God
[1:13:20] sends down your representation my
[1:13:23] question question to you is my was my
[1:13:25] representation already there or did it
[1:13:27] magically appear when I was born
[1:13:30] again the ability to be born again means
[1:13:34] you already had
[1:13:36] representation brother brandom says only
[1:13:38] the elect are considered in
[1:13:42] Redemption he sends down your
[1:13:47] representation what form that is in I
[1:13:50] don't know but I know brother brandom
[1:13:52] says that when you heard heard the
[1:13:53] message and you left the other thing you
[1:13:55] heard from your theophany that's right
[1:13:57] so if we have to put terminology to it I
[1:14:00] would say
[1:14:23] sprang there even of one and him as good
[1:14:26] as dead so many as the stars of the
[1:14:29] skies in multitude and as the sand which
[1:14:32] is by the seashore
[1:14:34] innumerable these all died in faith not
[1:14:37] having received the promises but having
[1:14:39] seen them AAR off and were persuaded of
[1:14:42] them and embraced them and confessed
[1:14:44] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[1:14:46] the earth for they say such things
[1:14:51] declare plainly that they seek a country
[1:14:54] and this is the verse I want to key
[1:14:57] on and truly if they had been mindful of
[1:15:01] the country from whence they came out
[1:15:04] they might have had opportunity to have
[1:15:09] returned this is speaking of the natural
[1:15:11] seat of Abraham but if it's true in the
[1:15:14] natural it's true in the spiritual and
[1:15:17] the principle is if they would have
[1:15:18] known from what country they came out of
[1:15:21] they would have had an opportunity to
[1:15:22] return
[1:15:26] I would say that we have been given
[1:15:28] Insight onto what country we have came
[1:15:30] out
[1:15:31] of and by default that gives us an
[1:15:33] opportunity to return to that
[1:15:36] country in the church age brother in the
[1:15:39] church ages brother Brandon says and the
[1:15:40] Stars which he's holding each star now
[1:15:43] look could we just stop a minute I want
[1:15:45] you to get this a star was the minister
[1:15:48] and a minister Anointed with the spirit
[1:15:50] from above do you realize that you
[1:15:52] repres represent a star in heaven and
[1:15:55] every Star in heaven represents
[1:15:59] you remember brother brandom taught us
[1:16:02] that God had three Bibles he wrote it
[1:16:05] first in the stars and the heavens he
[1:16:07] wrote it in the pyramids and he wrote it
[1:16:09] in his written
[1:16:10] word so if my position is represented in
[1:16:13] the
[1:16:17] Stars what possibility and chance is
[1:16:21] there for me to come to this day in this
[1:16:24] manifestation of this word for this hour
[1:16:27] and it be something different that's
[1:16:28] what's represented in the
[1:16:30] stars that was written
[1:16:33] first and that was even after the
[1:16:40] beginning remember brother Brandon said
[1:16:42] and the scripture says that there were
[1:16:44] 2third of those stars that fell their
[1:16:47] position was written in the heavens they
[1:16:49] fell from that position it's written
[1:16:51] it's documented in the heavens but there
[1:16:53] was a third of those stars that didn't
[1:16:55] fall and he says do you realize that one
[1:16:59] of those Stars represents
[1:17:01] you well if I was one of those thirds
[1:17:04] that did not fall and I still have that
[1:17:06] representation there what is the chances
[1:17:08] that Lo DEA is going to overcome
[1:17:11] me going to venture to say
[1:17:14] none we should take comfort in these
[1:17:17] things we should take comfort in these
[1:17:19] things in The Daily Grind when we're
[1:17:21] resisting and when we're fighting and
[1:17:23] when we're striving to do what is right
[1:17:24] to do what is
[1:17:26] true and when we fall flat on our face
[1:17:30] we need to come back to this
[1:17:33] Revelation that I was a star that did
[1:17:35] not fall and I am going back to that
[1:17:39] position that is overcoming power that
[1:17:41] is an overcoming
[1:17:45] Revelation as we would start to wind
[1:17:48] down here let's go to Luke
[1:17:52] 15
[1:17:57] Luke
[1:18:03] 15:1 this say story of The Prodigal
[1:18:06] Son extremely
[1:18:09] familiar passage of
[1:18:12] scripture but there are a couple things
[1:18:14] in here that are very
[1:18:20] interesting Jesus speaking he
[1:18:23] said and he said a certain man had two
[1:18:27] sons and the younger of them said to his
[1:18:30] father father give me the portion of
[1:18:31] goods that fth to me and he divided unto
[1:18:34] him his living and not many days after
[1:18:37] the younger son gathered all together
[1:18:38] and took his journey into a far country
[1:18:41] and there wasted his substance with
[1:18:42] righteous
[1:18:44] living and when he had spent all there
[1:18:46] arose a mighty famine in that land and
[1:18:48] he began to be in want and he went and
[1:18:51] joined himself to a citizen of that
[1:18:52] country and he sent him unto his fields
[1:18:54] to feed swine and he would Fain to have
[1:18:57] filled his belly with the husk that the
[1:18:59] swine did eat and no man gave unto
[1:19:02] him and when he came to
[1:19:05] himself this is
[1:19:08] key when he came to
[1:19:12] himself he said how many hired Servants
[1:19:15] of my fathers have breed enough to spare
[1:19:17] and I perish with Hunger I will arise
[1:19:20] and go to my father
[1:19:23] and will say unto him father I have
[1:19:25] sinned against heaven and before thee
[1:19:28] this is the story of The prodal Prodigal
[1:19:30] Son falling into the deep Miry clay of
[1:19:33] Le oia falling into the deep Mary clay
[1:19:36] of his own desires and his own wants he
[1:19:39] took a journey he went into a far
[1:19:41] country I would venture to say he was a
[1:19:43] he was a
[1:19:44] star he was he was a star that that was
[1:19:48] not in its correct position
[1:19:50] anymore and he's been placed in a far
[1:19:53] country not where he began at not where
[1:19:56] he started off at he started off in his
[1:19:58] father's
[1:20:00] house but he found himself somewhere
[1:20:04] else but there was a point in time right
[1:20:07] before the total darkness swallowed him
[1:20:09] up there was a point in time that he
[1:20:11] came to
[1:20:15] himself and him coming to
[1:20:18] himself
[1:20:20] directly was related to the fact that he
[1:20:24] realized I have a
[1:20:28] father who has plenty of
[1:20:31] food that he will give me even though
[1:20:34] I'm not worthy he came to himself and
[1:20:38] recognized I am not in the position that
[1:20:41] I used to be
[1:20:44] in but I used to be in a position that's
[1:20:47] not like this that I find myself in now
[1:20:51] and in that position there was plenty of
[1:20:53] food and things were a lot
[1:20:58] better the scripture just simply records
[1:21:00] that as he came to
[1:21:02] himself he came to
[1:21:05] himself he remembered that he had a
[1:21:08] father he says I will arise and go to my
[1:21:12] father my question is is this the first
[1:21:14] time that he's been to the father no it
[1:21:17] is not this is at least the second time
[1:21:20] because he was once there before so he's
[1:21:23] going back to his father and I will say
[1:21:26] unto him father I have sinned against
[1:21:27] heaven and before thee and I am no more
[1:21:30] worthy to be called thy son make me as
[1:21:33] one of thy hired servants I hope I'm not
[1:21:35] the only one that can relate to this
[1:21:36] story have we not all found ourselves in
[1:21:39] that position father I have been
[1:21:41] somewhere that I should not have been I
[1:21:44] am not worthy for you to accept me but
[1:21:47] all that I can do is
[1:21:51] ask amen
[1:21:55] I am no more worthy to be called thy son
[1:21:57] make me as one of thy hired
[1:21:59] servants so he determined this is what
[1:22:02] I'm going to say to my father when I get
[1:22:04] there and he rose and came to his father
[1:22:09] but when he was yet a great way
[1:22:11] off his father saw him and had
[1:22:14] compassion and ran and fell on his neck
[1:22:17] and kissed him how many has started
[1:22:18] returning to the father and you can
[1:22:20] recognize where you're at today when I
[1:22:22] first started I was a great way off from
[1:22:24] the
[1:22:25] father when I first made the decision
[1:22:28] when I first came to myself I was still
[1:22:30] a great way off from the father but
[1:22:33] where I'm at today I may still be a
[1:22:35] great way off from getting back
[1:22:36] completely to my father's house but
[1:22:38] thank be to God the father's not
[1:22:40] standing there waiting he's not just
[1:22:42] sitting there in a chair saying well
[1:22:43] he'll eventually get here the scripture
[1:22:45] says that when he was a still a great
[1:22:48] way off his father saw him and had
[1:22:50] compassion and ran how many's thankful
[1:22:53] that God has ran to you he has ran and
[1:22:57] fell on his neck and kissed him and the
[1:22:59] son you know he had this speech ready he
[1:23:01] says he says father I have sinned
[1:23:03] against heaven and in thy sight and am
[1:23:05] no more worthy to be called thy son but
[1:23:07] the
[1:23:09] Father the father didn't even have
[1:23:11] anything to say to him the father turns
[1:23:15] to the
[1:23:17] servant bring forth the best robe and
[1:23:20] put it on him and put a ring on his hand
[1:23:22] and shoes on his feet and bring hither
[1:23:24] the fatted calf and kill it and let us
[1:23:26] eat and be merry for this my son was
[1:23:28] dead and is alive again and he was lost
[1:23:30] and is found and they begin to be marry
[1:23:34] that's how quick forgiveness won the son
[1:23:36] had a prepared speech I'm going to come
[1:23:38] to the father and I'm going to plead my
[1:23:39] case and I'm going to tell him this and
[1:23:41] I'm going to tell him that and the
[1:23:42] father when he came with a true
[1:23:44] repentance the father didn't even
[1:23:46] address it he said go kill the fatted
[1:23:49] calf go get the best robe go put the
[1:23:51] ring on his finger
[1:23:55] he didn't say well go do penants for a
[1:23:57] week go do this go do that he has
[1:24:00] already provided he doesn't even address
[1:24:04] it he's repented he's seen a repentant
[1:24:08] heart go kill the fatted calf let's be
[1:24:12] merry amen for this my son was dead and
[1:24:15] is alive again he was lost and is found
[1:24:18] and they began to be married now his
[1:24:21] Elder son was in the the field and as he
[1:24:23] came and Drew n to the house he heard
[1:24:24] music and dancing and he called one of
[1:24:27] the servants and asked what these things
[1:24:28] meant and he said unto him thy brother
[1:24:30] is come and thy father hath killed the
[1:24:32] fatted calf because he hath received him
[1:24:34] safe and sound and he was angry and
[1:24:36] would not go in therefore came his
[1:24:39] father out and entreated
[1:24:41] him and he answering said to his father
[1:24:43] Lo these many years do I serve thee
[1:24:45] neither transgress I had any time thy
[1:24:48] commandment and yet thou never gavest me
[1:24:50] a kid that I might make marry with my
[1:24:52] friends but as soon as this son was Come
[1:24:55] Thou hath dived thy live who hath which
[1:24:58] hath dived thy living with
[1:25:00] harlots thou Hast killed for him the
[1:25:02] fatted calf and he said unto
[1:25:06] him and he said unto
[1:25:10] him son thou art ever with me and all I
[1:25:15] have is
[1:25:19] done what Revelation did he give him to
[1:25:22] overcome this
[1:25:24] complex all that I have is
[1:25:28] thine
[1:25:30] son
[1:25:32] son son all that I have is thine Jesus
[1:25:39] knowing all things had been given into
[1:25:42] his hands and that he was a Son of God
[1:25:45] that he came from God and went to God
[1:25:48] had overcoming power for all things amen
[1:25:51] this parable that Jesus is teaching has
[1:25:54] the same same language entwined into it
[1:25:58] the
[1:25:59] father simply reminds him of his
[1:26:04] position and reminds him
[1:26:09] son you're my
[1:26:11] son and all that I have is thine what
[1:26:16] are you upset
[1:26:20] about why are are you so
[1:26:24] frustrated you are my son is that not
[1:26:29] enough can anybody relate to
[1:26:32] this amen we get so tangled up in the
[1:26:36] Affairs of the world we get so tangled
[1:26:38] up about this situation and that
[1:26:40] situation and this church and that
[1:26:42] church and this Doctrine and this
[1:26:43] teaching and this past abuse and this
[1:26:46] thing in our life and this complex and
[1:26:48] this genetic
[1:26:51] makeup but the father is just standing
[1:26:54] there looking at
[1:26:56] us
[1:26:59] son come back to a proper understanding
[1:27:03] come back to your your spiritual placing
[1:27:07] come back to the knowledge of all things
[1:27:10] come back to the revelation of what is
[1:27:13] important you have got your eyes
[1:27:15] directed on everything else and you've
[1:27:18] got yourself all worked up about
[1:27:20] something because you have left the most
[1:27:23] important thing
[1:27:25] son son you are mine you are my son and
[1:27:30] all that I have is
[1:27:31] thine what more do we need what more
[1:27:34] could we ask for what does it matter how
[1:27:37] he treats or doesn't treat anybody else
[1:27:40] or how he does or doesn't deal with any
[1:27:42] other
[1:27:43] situation and I'm not saying that we
[1:27:45] live with our head in the clouds and we
[1:27:47] don't deal with situations that we have
[1:27:48] to deal with but I would say let us
[1:27:51] bring every situation under the the
[1:27:56] under the power of this
[1:27:58] Revelation and let's let's have this
[1:28:01] Revelation on the foremost of our minds
[1:28:04] when things are going sideways directly
[1:28:07] or
[1:28:09] indirectly I am a son and he has given
[1:28:12] me all
[1:28:14] things he has been kind enough to send
[1:28:18] me a prophet to come in the form of a
[1:28:21] prophet and reveal himself to me as his
[1:28:23] son what he hath taught me before he is
[1:28:27] teaching me
[1:28:28] now what more could I ask for amen I
[1:28:32] find it
[1:28:35] astounding that this is a son that could
[1:28:38] stand there and look his father in the
[1:28:40] eye and say I have done all of your
[1:28:42] Commandments and I have not aired one
[1:28:45] time and his father didn't correct him
[1:28:47] he didn't say well there was this time
[1:28:48] you did he stands there and he says I
[1:28:51] have done everything everything and I've
[1:28:52] kept all your
[1:28:56] Commandments but he still had jealousy
[1:28:58] laying in his
[1:29:00] heart he was still more concerned about
[1:29:03] his brother's position and his brother's
[1:29:05] reception than he was about his own
[1:29:09] position that's why I say getting all
[1:29:11] the teachings and all the doctrines to
[1:29:13] me that's not it that comes with it and
[1:29:16] I will never say that that's not
[1:29:17] important because it's extremely
[1:29:19] important but I believe that you can
[1:29:21] have such intellectual power and an
[1:29:24] intellectual understanding and a
[1:29:26] legalistic ability to do what is right
[1:29:29] and what is what is uh true and I like I
[1:29:32] said I don't belittle any of that I
[1:29:34] should I say we should be more like
[1:29:36] that but at the end of the day the
[1:29:40] problem here with this son even though
[1:29:42] he can say I've done everything you've
[1:29:44] asked me to do the problem was he still
[1:29:46] had something laying in his
[1:29:48] heart he still had jealousy laying in
[1:29:51] his heart
[1:29:52] and the father had to come and deal with
[1:29:55] that he had to come and remind him it
[1:29:57] doesn't matter about anybody else what
[1:30:00] matters is you're my son and all that I
[1:30:03] have is thine quit worrying about your
[1:30:05] brother and I would just say me
[1:30:08] personally that I don't ever want to
[1:30:09] find myself in that position I don't
[1:30:11] want to ever find myself in the seat of
[1:30:13] the scornful of somebody who's went
[1:30:15] Wayward and somebody who's lost track
[1:30:18] but they would come with a repentant
[1:30:19] heart I I pray to God that I would never
[1:30:22] have that in my life that I would come
[1:30:24] and say well Lord I've served you for x
[1:30:26] amount of years and I've done this and
[1:30:27] I've sacrificed this and you're blessing
[1:30:29] that person and you know they just they
[1:30:31] just came back two weeks ago and look at
[1:30:33] all that they've
[1:30:36] done I want to be there putting the robe
[1:30:40] on him putting the ring on his finger
[1:30:43] helping Phil dress that
[1:30:45] cow I want to be cooking the meat for
[1:30:47] him I want to be rejoicing and I want to
[1:30:50] be merry regardless of how Wayward and
[1:30:53] how long that it's been I want to
[1:30:56] respond with the power of the
[1:31:00] Revelation that I am a son of this
[1:31:03] father and a wayward son has
[1:31:07] returned what can I do to help him what
[1:31:09] can I do to assist him how can I
[1:31:11] encourage him or
[1:31:13] her I want to respond
[1:31:18] correctly there's a couple more
[1:31:20] scriptures as we would close here
[1:31:21] Ephesians
[1:31:22] 1:3 our pastor read this Wednesday night
[1:31:25] very familiar but I just want to repeat
[1:31:27] it says blessed be the God and father of
[1:31:30] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[1:31:31] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:31:34] Heavenly places in Christ according as
[1:31:37] he hath chosen Us in him before the
[1:31:41] foundation of the
[1:31:43] world and again I want to emphasize I'm
[1:31:46] I'm not an authority on this topic I've
[1:31:49] probably done a very poor job of Pres
[1:31:51] presenting this but this is all that I
[1:31:53] want to say this is all that I want to
[1:31:55] hold before you this is all that I want
[1:31:57] to remind you of I want this to be on
[1:31:59] the foremost of your mind every day day
[1:32:02] in and day out he hath chosen Us in some
[1:32:07] way in some shape or in some form before
[1:32:10] the foundation of the world and what
[1:32:13] happens now and what happened yesterday
[1:32:15] and what happened what will happen
[1:32:17] tomorrow is not going to Trump
[1:32:20] that he hath chosen us that we should be
[1:32:24] holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:32:28] love skipping down to verse 9 having
[1:32:31] made known unto us the mystery of his
[1:32:34] will I believe this mystery is the same
[1:32:37] mystery that's in re Revelation
[1:32:39] 10:7 having made known to us the mystery
[1:32:43] what
[1:32:45] mystery as brother brand says one day
[1:32:47] you're going to find out that God is in
[1:32:51] you
[1:32:53] amen having made known to us the mystery
[1:32:55] of his will according to his good
[1:32:57] pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:33:00] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:33:02] fullness of time he might gather
[1:33:04] together in
[1:33:06] one all
[1:33:08] things what did Jesus know had been
[1:33:10] given unto him all
[1:33:13] things and he will gather those
[1:33:17] together to
[1:33:20] him
[1:33:22] verse 11 in whom also we have obtained
[1:33:24] an inheritance being predestinated
[1:33:26] according to the purpose of him who
[1:33:28] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:33:32] his own will that we should be to the
[1:33:34] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[1:33:43] Christ Israel and the
[1:33:48] church brother Brenham says now it's
[1:33:50] election I want to get on that election
[1:33:52] strong cuz it's the truth now you didn't
[1:33:55] become a Christian just coincidence
[1:33:57] because you became a Christian before
[1:33:59] you was in this
[1:34:01] world before you were born God ordained
[1:34:05] you to be a Christian from the Garden of
[1:34:06] Eden from before the foundation of the
[1:34:08] world all you say is that right brother
[1:34:11] that's the truth before there was ever
[1:34:14] you know
[1:34:16] anything I'm comfortable resting in
[1:34:20] that I I didn't know anything but he's
[1:34:24] telling me and a prophet has the
[1:34:25] authority to do this he's telling me
[1:34:28] before I even knowed anything I was a
[1:34:32] Christian God had chosen me and ordained
[1:34:34] me to be a Christian there was a time
[1:34:37] that you
[1:34:38] knew praise the
[1:34:41] Lord there was a time that you
[1:34:45] knew your mind is darkened to that now I
[1:34:50] don't understand that
[1:34:52] this is just my thought I could be a
[1:34:53] million miles from right but to me there
[1:34:56] is some type of
[1:34:58] rules and
[1:35:01] contingency that God has agreed to in
[1:35:03] this battle that has Spilled Out of
[1:35:05] Heaven onto
[1:35:06] Earth and to me part of this contingency
[1:35:10] in this rules of
[1:35:13] warfare is that he
[1:35:16] knew that if we would have a proper
[1:35:18] understanding of what we knew before
[1:35:22] that Satan wouldn't even have a
[1:35:24] chance if that makes sense we understand
[1:35:26] he don't have a
[1:35:28] chance um and here I am trying to use
[1:35:31] language to explain these things and
[1:35:33] it's just not going to work but we
[1:35:35] understand that there were Rules of
[1:35:37] Engagement and there were things that
[1:35:38] had to be agreed on there was a
[1:35:40] Battleground
[1:35:42] set and
[1:35:44] Satan would know that if they come
[1:35:47] remember remember
[1:35:50] uh we'll get to that in a second I don't
[1:35:52] want to go there yet but there was a
[1:35:55] reason that we could not come with this
[1:35:57] proper understanding and that reason
[1:36:00] brother Brandon says is so that we could
[1:36:01] be tempted and tried by sin if we would
[1:36:05] have come just directly the way that we
[1:36:07] should have come there would not have
[1:36:08] been a test or a temptation but he says
[1:36:11] there was a time that you knew this but
[1:36:13] you can't know it
[1:36:15] now to me again that's just my opinion
[1:36:18] you don't have to agree with that but to
[1:36:20] me that is that is part of that
[1:36:24] spiritual warfare that was agreed upon
[1:36:26] he says your mind is darkened to that
[1:36:28] now there's only been one man this is
[1:36:30] what I was going to refer to there's
[1:36:32] only been one man on Earth that knew
[1:36:35] that he was
[1:36:37] before and that was
[1:36:42] Jesus Jesus had this proper clear
[1:36:45] perfect
[1:36:47] understanding our minds are darken to it
[1:36:50] but Jesus is what
[1:36:52] wasn't he said glorify me father with
[1:36:54] the glory that I had with you before the
[1:36:56] foundation of the world he was the
[1:36:59] Incarnate God he could move back there
[1:37:01] and know what it was but our minds are
[1:37:05] blackened
[1:37:07] there but we were ordained predestinated
[1:37:11] see he says he says that and I believe
[1:37:14] that and I rest in that I'm comfortable
[1:37:15] with that but he doesn't just leave it
[1:37:18] there he says our minds are black
[1:37:21] there but we are were ordained
[1:37:26] predestinated so he immediately starts
[1:37:28] going into trying to expound upon that
[1:37:31] to give us what light that we can
[1:37:33] have you know what predestinate means
[1:37:36] predestination of anything was pre-a by
[1:37:39] God Amen that's not skim milk now notice
[1:37:42] I believe that stumped you we better go
[1:37:44] over there just a minute turn over with
[1:37:45] me to Ephesians the 1 chapter this is
[1:37:47] what we just read and let's read just a
[1:37:49] little cuz I'm afraid your missing that
[1:37:52] and you just think that I'm saying that
[1:37:54] I am not now Paul is speaking addressing
[1:37:57] Ephesians Ephesians 1 directly to the
[1:38:01] shoulder to the church that's what we're
[1:38:03] doing tonight this is not for babies
[1:38:07] this is for grown-ups not babies little
[1:38:10] babies I got a little one back there
[1:38:12] just now learning to walk he'd Boop and
[1:38:14] fall down get back up and he thought he
[1:38:16] was doing something great I was that way
[1:38:18] one day but now I'm a man I put away
[1:38:21] child childish things so brother random
[1:38:23] is expressing this is not skin milk this
[1:38:26] is not for babies this is not a light
[1:38:28] teaching this is strong this is this is
[1:38:31] uh real and this this is uh true I'm not
[1:38:35] just making this up he says now we got
[1:38:38] to come to full
[1:38:41] Doctrine full Doctrine all
[1:38:45] things I like good old shouting meetings
[1:38:49] where we just clap our hands or shout
[1:38:50] and have a good time have great powerful
[1:38:52] services and things dance on the bubble
[1:38:54] as it were but then when The Showdown
[1:38:57] time come you don't know where you're
[1:39:02] standing let's get back and find out
[1:39:06] let's find out what's making us do that
[1:39:10] let's get back to the foundation see
[1:39:13] where we're at what Foundation is he
[1:39:16] talking about Ephesians 1 that's the
[1:39:19] scripture that he's referencing your
[1:39:21] mind is darkened to that now but let me
[1:39:23] expound upon that because you can have
[1:39:25] great services and dance and shout and
[1:39:28] these things that he lists he says but
[1:39:30] when The Showdown
[1:39:32] comes it's not going to hold you there's
[1:39:35] one thing that's going to hold you and
[1:39:36] I'm going to expound that to you
[1:39:38] Ephesians
[1:39:40] 1 predestinated in him before the
[1:39:43] foundation of the world the knowledge of
[1:39:46] where you come from and where you're
[1:39:48] going he declares when The Showdown
[1:39:51] Comes This is what will hold
[1:39:54] you let's go back to the foundation to
[1:39:58] see where we're at as the musicians
[1:40:01] would
[1:40:01] come I'll finish with this scripture
[1:40:05] in uh
[1:40:08] Philippians Philippians
[1:40:13] 2 brother brandom says we've got to come
[1:40:16] to full Doctrine and we've got to get
[1:40:19] back to the foundation to see where
[1:40:22] we're
[1:40:25] at how many wants to come to full
[1:40:28] Doctrine how many wants to have a proper
[1:40:31] understanding of where we're
[1:40:32] at where we were and where we're going
[1:40:36] to as I said before things that
[1:40:40] were are directly related to things that
[1:40:43] will
[1:40:45] be things that are to be but things that
[1:40:49] were and things that are to be
[1:40:52] are both directly related to things that
[1:40:56] are does that make sense so we can
[1:41:01] come and rest in things that
[1:41:04] were and we can rest in things that are
[1:41:06] to be but that's not the battle that's
[1:41:09] going on now the battle that's going on
[1:41:12] now is things that
[1:41:16] is and you will never have a victory
[1:41:19] with the battle that
[1:41:22] is if you don't have an understanding of
[1:41:24] things that were and things that are to
[1:41:26] be does that make sense that's what it
[1:41:29] was given to us for was for overcoming
[1:41:31] power for
[1:41:33] now when we get to things that are to
[1:41:37] be brother brand says when you enter
[1:41:39] into that being into that body you know
[1:41:41] all
[1:41:42] things we're not going to need the
[1:41:45] overcoming power then now is when we
[1:41:48] need the overcoming power that that
[1:41:51] Revelation is going to put us into
[1:41:53] things that are to be and we know that
[1:41:55] things that are to be are simply a body
[1:41:56] a body that we are going
[1:42:01] to Philippians 2:5 let this mind be in
[1:42:06] you which was also in Christ
[1:42:10] Jesus what mind was in Christ Jesus John
[1:42:14] Chapter
[1:42:15] 13 all things have been given under my
[1:42:17] hands I have come from the father and
[1:42:20] I'm going to the father and this is what
[1:42:23] it continues to say in verse 6 who being
[1:42:26] in the form of God thought it not
[1:42:28] robbery to be equal with
[1:42:31] God but made himself of no reputation
[1:42:34] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:42:37] and was made in the likeness of man and
[1:42:40] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:42:42] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:42:45] death even the death of the
[1:42:49] cross I will would venture to say
[1:42:52] that let this mind be in you that was in
[1:42:55] Christ Jesus that he thought it not
[1:42:58] robbery to consider himself equal with
[1:43:01] God that would be a revelation that
[1:43:03] could very easily get you puffed up and
[1:43:06] in a mindset that you should not be in
[1:43:09] but remember we have to say stay in
[1:43:11] accordance with all of the scriptures
[1:43:13] and immediately after that Revelation
[1:43:15] comes look at the results of that
[1:43:19] Revelation who Jesus having this
[1:43:22] Revelation took up a towel and GED
[1:43:25] himself and became a servant to his
[1:43:27] brother Jesus thinking it not robbery to
[1:43:31] be equal with God being found in fashion
[1:43:34] as a man humbled
[1:43:36] himself that's the result of a proper
[1:43:39] understanding of this Revelation humbled
[1:43:42] himself and became obedient to death
[1:43:45] even the death of the
[1:43:48] Cross this is not
[1:43:51] a revelation that is profound and as
[1:43:54] rich and as powerful is it as it is this
[1:43:57] is not a revelation that's going to put
[1:43:59] us out of a proper manifestation of a
[1:44:02] Son of God with a a proudful and a
[1:44:05] boastful and an arrogant attitude this
[1:44:07] proper revelation will bring
[1:44:10] humility it did with Jesus it did with
[1:44:13] every believer through the Scriptures it
[1:44:14] did with the prophet of our age why
[1:44:16] would it go sideways
[1:44:18] now and result in an arrogance
[1:44:22] spirit this this Revelation is a
[1:44:25] revelation that I feel we have to have
[1:44:28] though because it's directly related to
[1:44:30] the scriptures if we if we truly believe
[1:44:34] if we would all stand if we truly
[1:44:37] believe that we are in the closing
[1:44:41] moments of Time how many believe that
[1:44:44] that we are in the closing moments of
[1:44:45] time and that it is the time is at hand
[1:44:50] that we we are to depart out of this
[1:44:52] world and go to the
[1:44:54] father how are we going to do
[1:44:57] that if our
[1:45:01] revelation of our spiritual placing and
[1:45:04] position is up one day and down the next
[1:45:08] up one day down the next today I'm a Son
[1:45:11] of God tomorrow I'm not today that I am
[1:45:13] but two hours from now I made a mistake
[1:45:15] and now I'm
[1:45:17] not that may have worked for the church
[1:45:19] ages
[1:45:21] but remember we're not in the church
[1:45:23] ages we have been called out of the
[1:45:24] church ages we are standing like no
[1:45:28] other people have stood on the face of
[1:45:30] this Earth we are standing not just in a
[1:45:33] position not just to be saved and make
[1:45:38] it we're not called just to be saved and
[1:45:42] make it we are called to literally put
[1:45:48] death under our feet
[1:45:51] and have our atoms changed and these
[1:45:54] bodies go to a different dimension we're
[1:45:57] not called just to be saved and make it
[1:46:00] we're called to be raptured and brother
[1:46:03] random says how can we have rapturing
[1:46:05] faith if we don't even have faith for
[1:46:07] Divine Healing so how can we have
[1:46:10] rapturing faith if we don't even have
[1:46:14] faith that I have come from the father
[1:46:17] and that I'm going back to the father
[1:46:20] and doesn't mean that our emotions are
[1:46:21] not going to play with us and that we're
[1:46:23] not going to have to come overcome those
[1:46:24] on a on a daily basis but I venture to
[1:46:28] say that there is no other Revelation
[1:46:30] that is going to overcome that for you
[1:46:32] but this
[1:46:33] Revelation this Revelation that has been
[1:46:36] brought to us through the message of the
[1:46:38] hour was brought to us so that we could
[1:46:42] have perfect faith in where we came from
[1:46:46] and where we're going and by default who
[1:46:49] we are now
[1:46:51] let's pray
[1:46:53] together precious Lord Jesus we just
[1:46:56] want to thank you for this time that
[1:46:59] you've given us
[1:47:01] Lord father and as we said before we
[1:47:04] stand here totally inadequate to even
[1:47:09] Broach this subject Lord we don't stand
[1:47:11] here as a man with prophetic Insight who
[1:47:15] could make statements like this Lord we
[1:47:18] we can't even make these statements only
[1:47:20] only your Vindicated Prophet could make
[1:47:22] these statements
[1:47:23] Lord father and even if we come before
[1:47:27] them without a perfect revelation of
[1:47:31] such and not being able to see the
[1:47:33] things that he was seeing as he would
[1:47:35] make these statements Lord we still want
[1:47:37] to declare them and we want to declare
[1:47:39] them as true and we want to declare that
[1:47:40] we believe them Lord and we want to
[1:47:43] thank you that you have not left our
[1:47:47] minds completely veiled and in complete
[1:47:50] darkness but you have come and you have
[1:47:53] started to strip away spiritual Amnesia
[1:47:56] Lord and to bring back to our
[1:47:59] remembrance what your Prophet said that
[1:48:00] we once knew before and that W that we
[1:48:03] were real genuine sons of gods sons of
[1:48:08] God before Lord we thank you for that
[1:48:10] Revelation I pray that you would
[1:48:12] continue to reveal it to us Lord I pray
[1:48:16] that you would continue to expound it to
[1:48:18] us and I pray that you would allow us to
[1:48:21] continue to yield to that as things
[1:48:24] would get Topsy Turvy Lord and as
[1:48:26] hardships would come and as a press
[1:48:30] would come or a squeeze would come or
[1:48:32] persecution would come I pray that we
[1:48:34] would be able to rest and Hold Steady
[1:48:39] and be full grown adul uh Christians and
[1:48:43] overcome by the same power and
[1:48:45] Revelation that you overcome by Lord may
[1:48:48] you continue to make it real to us Lord
[1:48:52] Make It Real to us in our hearts Lord
[1:48:54] and make our lives manifest it may we
[1:48:58] demonstrate it and manifest it as we
[1:49:00] would walk on this Earth we love you and
[1:49:03] we appreciate you we just commit
[1:49:05] ourselves in this day into your hands
[1:49:07] Lord we pray that you would just take
[1:49:09] the words that have been spoken of
[1:49:11] anything has been said that would cause
[1:49:14] confusion or misunderstanding I pray
[1:49:16] that you would just go and that you
[1:49:18] would fix it Lord and that you would
[1:49:19] make it right Lord that you would just
[1:49:22] accomplish the point and the purpose
[1:49:25] that you've had for the preaching here
[1:49:27] this morning we ask this and commit it
[1:49:29] to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:49:30] Christ

[1:51:18] thought
[1:51:20] he
[1:51:21] sees each tear that falls and he hears
[1:51:28] me when I go and he hears
[1:51:32] me and he hears me
[1:51:36] when I
[1:51:41] go
[1:51:43] amen oh I pray that God will give me a
[1:51:46] better
[1:51:46] revelation of the fact I came from God
[1:51:50] and I go to God Amen we we've heard it
[1:51:54] preached we've been we've seen it uh in
[1:51:57] the message we see it in the scriptures
[1:52:00] we know it's true but oh I need it to
[1:52:02] become more true in my heart to settle
[1:52:06] out all uncertainty to put to to bed all
[1:52:10] fear all mistrust and uncertainty and
[1:52:14] and Troublesome Waters may it all just
[1:52:16] be put to rest with the fact that he
[1:52:18] knows the way that I take he
[1:52:20] predetermined he saw before he knows me
[1:52:23] he's known me from before the foundation
[1:52:25] of the world not not necessarily me in
[1:52:27] the way I think of me but me in the way
[1:52:29] he thought of me he's known me I say you
[1:52:34] know I still remember I remember what it
[1:52:36] was like coming to the message and
[1:52:38] growing up in church and growing up as a
[1:52:42] Pentecostal boy and I remember what it
[1:52:43] was like coming to the message and
[1:52:45] hearing things that I had never heard
[1:52:47] before strange things that seemed
[1:52:49] strange and so different than what I
[1:52:51] taught I remembered what it was like
[1:52:53] amen but I also remember what it was
[1:52:54] like amen knowing that when I come to
[1:52:58] this revelation of the word it was like
[1:53:00] coming
[1:53:01] home and how could it be like coming
[1:53:03] home when I've never heard these things
[1:53:05] before I mean there was times there
[1:53:07] would come out of my heart an amen Amen
[1:53:10] brother that's the truth and it's as if
[1:53:12] I already knew it but i' never heard it
[1:53:14] before intellectually I could know I
[1:53:16] never heard it before but something
[1:53:17] about it seems so familiar where did
[1:53:20] that come from Friends amen because we
[1:53:22] were part of God from the very found
[1:53:24] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:53:26] whatever transpired between then and now
[1:53:28] we could sit and debate about it for
[1:53:30] hours and hours and hours amen and may
[1:53:33] God let us see it but the consequential
[1:53:35] part to that is that I know that I was
[1:53:38] there and when he knew me from before
[1:53:40] the foundation of the world and he knew
[1:53:41] the way that I would take and nothing is
[1:53:43] out of kill her from with God
[1:53:45] everything's just ticking right on
[1:53:47] time and like our brother Ben was saying
[1:53:50] that revelation will hold us in this day
[1:53:54] a lot of teaching amen there's a lot of
[1:53:57] teaching but the teaching should help us
[1:53:59] translate it into a
[1:54:01] life there's so many things that when
[1:54:04] your loved one sick and
[1:54:07] dying understanding the sequence of end
[1:54:09] time events may not be the thing that's
[1:54:12] on your mind right then when you hit
[1:54:14] tragedy in your life and you're crying
[1:54:16] through the night because you have no
[1:54:18] idea how this is going to work out out
[1:54:20] understanding what happens first the
[1:54:22] Millennium and and Gog and Magog or that
[1:54:25] may not be the thing that's on your mind
[1:54:28] but when you hit tragedy in your life
[1:54:30] the one thing that may come to your mind
[1:54:31] is God I know that you know and I know
[1:54:34] that you've called me and I know that
[1:54:35] you predestinate me and I know that
[1:54:37] you've already seen the solution to this
[1:54:39] problem and I'm putting all my trust in
[1:54:41] you because I believe you've called me a
[1:54:43] son and in my heart there was a witness
[1:54:45] that said I am a
[1:54:47] son I'm your son and all when all of
[1:54:51] this was determined before the
[1:54:52] foundation of there I was there and
[1:54:55] somehow I was real and somehow I knew it
[1:54:59] and somehow it didn't scare me
[1:55:01] then don't know how all that works but
[1:55:04] God help it not to scare me
[1:55:08] now amen I believe it's important for us
[1:55:13] to
[1:55:14] realize that God already has seen it God
[1:55:18] already knows when it was all determined
[1:55:20] and all set out in the mind of God we
[1:55:23] were there not like
[1:55:25] this however we were there we were there
[1:55:29] and now that we come into the dark cloud
[1:55:31] of this Veil and so many things about
[1:55:33] that transition we don't understand but
[1:55:35] when we're walking around in darkness if
[1:55:37] one light can keep shining in in us in
[1:55:40] our heart to know I was there I was
[1:55:42] there when he decided I was there when
[1:55:44] he laid out the victory I was there when
[1:55:46] he showed how this flesh would manifest
[1:55:49] his glory in this end time I was there
[1:55:51] everything is
[1:55:54] okay amen remember God is not coming
[1:55:58] looking for
[1:56:00] sheep he's a Shepherd looking for lost
[1:56:03] sheep he's not just walking around
[1:56:05] picking up sheep he's po he's picking up
[1:56:08] his lost sheep if they're lost sheep
[1:56:10] they were his sheep to begin
[1:56:12] with I'm so glad the shepherd came and
[1:56:15] found me and when he came and found me
[1:56:18] he was proving to me that I was his
[1:56:21] sheep from before the foundation of the
[1:56:23] world I've always been his sheep not a
[1:56:26] new sheep I'm his restored
[1:56:29] sheep oh let that Revelation carry us
[1:56:33] friends amen I'm thankful for it I want
[1:56:36] it to grow in my heart amen let's just
[1:56:39] bow our heads and thank the Lord for his
[1:56:43] word dear Lord Jesus I'm so thankful
[1:56:47] Lord that in this Dark Age
[1:56:50] of Satan's even it's the darkest time
[1:56:53] upon the Earth there is mass
