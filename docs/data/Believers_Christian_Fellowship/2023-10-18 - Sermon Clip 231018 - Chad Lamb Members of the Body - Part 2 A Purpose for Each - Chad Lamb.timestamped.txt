[0:16] real healing
[0:18] service that we could keep this part

[0:23] the roof this morning in such a Harmony
[0:26] that the Holy Spirit would place every
[0:28] member of the body that here this

[0:33] be such a spontaneous healing of the
[0:36] soul and body it'll if we'll just hold
[0:39] our

[0:45] it just stunned me said oh I'd like to
[0:47] bring that into a healing service what's
[0:49] he talking about the Heavenly Host all
[0:50] fitting their place and nothing gets out
[0:52] of order If It Moves it has an effect on
[0:54] the earth if if the moon would move the
[0:56] Earth would be covered with water it's
[0:58] got to stay in God's position and move
[1:00] according to God's decree and now he
[1:02] said what about the Earthly host what if
[1:04] it gets out of order and I want to bring
[1:06] that into a healing service now till
[1:08] each one of us here that's under this
[1:09] roof would get in Harmony and get into
[1:12] our position and read and let me read it
[1:14] again and every member of the body
[1:16] that's here this morning in such Harmony
[1:18] till there would be such a spontaneous
[1:20] healing of soul and body if we'll just
[1:23] hold our
[1:28] position there's there's power in being
[1:31] what he called us to be there's power in
[1:33] staying where he called us to stay
[1:35] there's power in yielding to his spirit
[1:37] and surrendering and washing all of
[1:39] ourselves out of the way and let the
[1:40] Spirit come and do whatever he wants in
[1:42] our lives whatever he's fashioned me for
[1:44] whatever he's placed me here for
[1:46] whatever position he wants I just want
[1:47] to surrender to him because I want to
[1:49] bring such a Unity such a Harmony in
[1:51] this place I don't want to be a part
[1:53] that's out of order I don't want to be
[1:55] trying to take somebody else's place I
[1:57] don't want to have the wrong idea about
[1:58] why he made me this I just want to get
[2:00] into the Harmony and the unity amen till
[2:03] there can be such a spontaneous healing
[2:06] of soul and body if we'll just hold our
[2:12] position so
[2:14] simple but so
[2:16] profound and you know when it comes to
[2:18] human beings so incredibly
[2:21] hard because we have so many self-doubts
[2:23] and we set so much Pride and Prejudice
[2:26] and jocking for position and pooling
[2:28] it's going to take a real to self we've
[2:30] got to get rid of that nasty Pride that
[2:32] causes us want to rate things and move
[2:34] in positions and I need this spot and
[2:36] they shouldn't be in that spot and I
[2:37] should be this and they should do that
[2:39] and they could do that better we got to
[2:41] stop all of that nonsense and come into
[2:42] a Harmony and say God positionally Place
[2:45] each one of us Place us God and work
[2:47] through US Lord and help me to support
[2:49] the one that's running with the ball
[2:51] help me to love the one that you're
[2:52] using amen and me to stay in my place
[2:54] and want him to stay in his place and I
[2:56] want it to move in harmony so that there
[2:58] can be such a spontan is healing of the
[3:00] soul and body it will just hold our
[3:04] position
