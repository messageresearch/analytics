because he bled and died so that me and you could know the truth and that we didn't have to stumble in darkness that's the blood that I claim I claim the blood the physical literal blood 2000 years ago I claimed that that paid the penalty for my sin but I claimed the blood of what he bought to deliver to me let's just pray this evening precious Lord Jesus we're so grateful that we can come once again and gather ourselves together according to your word Lord that we can assemble ourselves as your word is instructed but Lord as we so often say we've come now to a great juncture of Time Lord that we've done all that a mortal being can do and Lord it's time now that the lamb must come and take the book and loose the seals for a man cannot do that Lord and these people certainly did not come here this evening to hear me or a man Lord and quite frankly I can find no fault in that because I didn't come to hear myself Lord but we're asking that you would come on the scene that you would come and that you would take this precious word that you bled and that you died for and that you would pick it up and that you would break it to us and feed us and reveal yourself to us Lord we're ever so grateful of what you've done for us Lord and we're ever so grateful of the truth that you have given us Lord that the billions of people that's walking around on the face of this Earth in darkness and gross Darkness we select small group of people have truth to walking may we never take that for granted Lord may we cherish it and may we give it the proper place that it deserves we ask now that you would just come and have your way we pray that you would just move me aside Lord Jesus father we just ask that you would come and be the speaker here this evening Lord and that you would come and be the hearer and that you would accomplish what you've set this service to accomplish we commit ourselves to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you if you'll take your Bibles we'll go to Hebrews chapter 12. I would like to just maybe put a little finishing touches on where I'd left off last time of being called to Mount Zion not a physical Mountain as Israel was called but a spiritual mountain and a spiritual habitation being that we are a gentile people so brother Frank if you wouldn't care just to do the lights like you did that time the last time that would be great you'll forgive me I've got sensitive eyes so these spotlights really do a number on me the uh I've always said that's why the Lord had to give me a beautiful wife is because I've got sensitive eyes I couldn't look at somebody that was hard on the ass so I should get some kind of points for that I think Hebrews chapter 12 before I get myself in trouble beginning at verse 1 wherefore seen we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the Sin with thus so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame in a set down at the right hand of the Throne of God skipping down to 18 now for ye are not common to the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkest and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but ye are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven unto God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel God bless you as you would have your seats this evening so the scripture here Paul speaking is very clearly saying that we are a different type of people we are a gentile people Paul was sent as a light to the Gentiles and we are not a natural people called to Natural things as a natural mountain and uh things of that nature as the Jews were they were very much natural called to a natural Mountain they were numbered people of you know 12 tribes and so forth everything to the Jews was natural but Paul is obviously drawing a clear distinction here that we are not such a people that we are a spiritual people being Gentiles and the triggering point if you want to say the inspiration for this thought that I was putting together was when I was studying the message things that are to be I get a portion of that message read and It just strikes me that brother Branham is preaching a message things that are to be um but yet he's not speaking of anything natural or anything carnal that is to be everything in that message is spiritual everything and you know I guess maybe like I said sometimes I'm slow but it just really had impact on me and I went back to the beginning and started again to you know really grasp what he was pointing to and drawing to because here's a major prophet standing on the scene declaring a message things that are to be and he's not trying to tell us how to avoid a financial collapse he's not trying to tell us how to make sure we have perfect health or you know how to have the best car the best house or how to avoid pitfalls in the natural life but he is only and exclusively speaking of spiritual Heavenly things and directing our attention there so I think that's extremely important if and remember this was at the very tail end of his ministry and I was talking with a brother yesterday whether brother Branham knew it was at the telling of his ministry or not to me is not relevant I'm prone to believe that he did but God knew he was at the tail end of his ministry and God is the one orchestrating what he's going to be speaking and this is now at the tail end if you're standing in the position of God this is him looking to say I'm now at the tail end of my Ministry before I remove my voice and this is what I must say so to me it just carries a lot of weight and it's not that there's one portion more important than the other portion I would just say that it's a significant portion here it draws special attention to these closing moments of time and pick up your pen and write brother Branham speaks this in the church age book he says the second Forerunner of Christ will sow for the latter reign Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and Creeds for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the rapture the first Showdown was Mount Carmel the second was Mount Transfiguration but the third will be Mount Zion Mount Carmel was physical Mount Transfiguration was physical Mount Zion is spiritual and he says that Jesus Will Be The Showdown Jesus will be the one to come on the scene at that point in time and show who is who he says there's coming in Exodus this is in the Third Exodus he says there's coming in Exodus where God will show who is who so if God's going to show who is who why should we spend our time trying to figure out who is who why don't we just let God show who is who we want to make sure that we stay in our position if you want to figure out who is who at least start with yourself make sure that you are who you are supposed to be before we start figuring out who else somebody else is he says God will show who is who where the church itself the Bride of Jesus Christ will be Exodus out into the land that's promised in my father's house are many mansions in this place you don't have to go there and fight like they did speaking of Israel it's already prepared if this Earthly Tabernacle dwelling be dissolved we have one already waiting that where I am there ye may be also the great Exodus at hand so now the Mount Zion Showdown is also the final Exodus and God is going to determine who is who and he's going to show who and who is who but I want to emphasize this is a spiritual manifestation this is a spiritual battle does it have physical effects absolutely it will physically change your atoms but if you do not come to a spiritual Showdown first a spiritual Mount Zion it is not going to evolve into a physical manifestation so this scripture in my father's house are many mansions obviously is the one brother Branham is using as his keynote scripture for things that are to be and this is the scripture that he commonly references and what we're going to be referencing multiple times tonight and things that are to be brother random says and last night speaking over in Yuma for the Christian businessman I spoke on the subject of the rapture now that might be a strange subject to speak among at a banquet but most everyone there was Christians and so if we're Christians I think we ought to be kindly notified ahead we don't have to just guess at it we're notified what our destination will be how many are thankful that God kindly notified you ahead if you remember brother Branham um well I'm gonna get ahead of myself I'm not going to go there and I want to speak on that tonight and the subject is going to be things that are to be and now speaking last night on The Rapture so tonight I want to speak on this subject that I might tie it together with last night's message so he just preached on the Rapture he's coming to preach on things that are to be in the first right out of the gate he says I want to tie these two things together now there's going to be a rapture we know that that's in the future to be Revelation 4 verse 1 you don't have to turn there you know this by heart after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which much which must be Hereafter so brother Branham is doing exactly what the scripture did the scripture says come up higher and I'll show you things thereafter brother Branham comes and preaches the Rapture and then he goes immediately to things that are to be verse two and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one set on the throne John 16 verse 13 says how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come John 14 verse 1. this is the primary scripture that he was using let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way look at what he's talking about here how you get there and the way you get there Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me back to things that are to be brother random says now notice in my father's house there's many mansions we read this last time but I just want to refresh your memory and in case somebody wasn't here they'll have a clue what what direction we're going he says I don't mean to add to the word or take from it because we're not to do that but let me just make this as not an additive but just to bring out a point in my father's house is many kinds of mansions I don't believe that when we get to heaven that we will be just like just everybody look alike I don't believe that we will be blondes or brunettes or little or all big or all Giants I believe that God is a god of variety the world proves that he made you in a variety some men are real blusterous and some are real dogmatic and others are fine and others are kind and you just find all different kinds of people in his kingdom now notice many many mansions many kinds of mansions so brother Branham comes out with this opening scripture and he immediately brings clarification to it that we're not talking about sticks and stones and drywall he says that these houses these Mansions some of them have blonde hair some brunettes some are little some are big so I thank God for this Revelation I thank God that he would bring what does he say here not as an additive but just to bring out a point to bring Clarity to this he says when you see a man here struggling to live somebody in a hospital or a sick bed or in an accident struggling and the death rattle is in their throat and pulling and crying and screaming for Life what does that mean there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that now they are temporal gifts to us these things only expressing that there is one where it's the Eternal one that's what Jesus has gone away to prepare the Eternal one but remember when Thomas was talking to him he says I don't know where you're going I don't know the way and Jesus says I am the way I am the truth I am the life so we know these aren't houses that he has to go over there and put some two befores together and some drywall up these are bodies that we are going to move into and he says that I am I am going away to prepare those for you and oh by the way I am that way I am the way that you get to that body I am the truth I am the life so he doesn't need to go and build anything but he does need to provide a way for us because there's somebody that has to breach that Chasm there's somebody that has to remove my spiritual Amnesia in order for me to get to where we're going because remember we're not on a physical Journey although we are on a let me say it this way we're not on just a physical Journey we are on a physical Journey but we're not just on a physical Journey we're on a spiritual journey so if we're on a spiritual journey we need somebody to make a spiritual way and I'll remind you in the Book of Revelation when John was looking to see if he was qualified he was sorely disappointed and he also said that you were sorely disappointed and I was sorely disappointed because nobody nobody was worthy in heaven on Earth or under the Earth to cross this chasm to open this book to bring us back to where we needed to be Fellowship by Redemption 1955 brother Branham says this is astounding to me this is all the way back in 1955. I've never believed that heaven was a place where there was a bunch of buildings where there's a bunch of houses up there made with mortar dobbed up with paper and pain on the wall I've never believed that a supernatural being would have to live in a literal house I believe when Jesus spoke in John 14 said in my father's house as many mansions he meant a body a Dwelling Place I can't tell you how desperately I would have loved to have found this quote years ago because I'm reading things that are to be and I'm wanting to put the pieces together and declare yes he's clearly talking about a body but I've just you know going back and forth until things click but here in 1955 he's openly declaring this mystery Jesus spoken John 14 in my father's house as many mansions he meant a body a dwelling place for the scriptures verify the same thing and say if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting you see it more this is key listen to this Mortal beings is the only one who lives in mortal habitations Immortal beings live in immortal habitations you decide what you are you decide what you're living in if the Sticks and Stones house that you're living is is your only habitation there's not going to be much left of that pretty shortly I think I mean they're wanting to send nukes every day so we better be in we better be certain that we have an immortal habitation to move into he says then the place that we go into until we return back is not a place of brick and mortar and clay or precious stones or Jewels it's a place of condition it's a place of condition that we move out of this Dimension that we live into into another dimension and it's a house a tabernacle a Dwelling Place I'm just going to go ahead and let the cat out of the bag this is not something you have to wait on if you want to move move if you want to transcend Dimensions you as the Bride of Jesus Christ have the ability to transcend dimensions you might have to wait for your 16 elements to catch up to you but if you want to move move if you want to come to Revelation chapter 4 and come up higher come up higher you have a house waiting for you to come into Jesus said destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up in three days and they thought he was speaking of of the Solomon's Temple but he was speaking of his own body and he has gone to prepare a place for every believer that the very moment we step out of these mortal regions don't Define that by death Saints it can be death but don't just limit it to that he says the very moment that we step out of these mortal Dimensions mortal regions how many want to step out of their mortal regions this evening I don't know about you but I do I desperately want to step out of this Mortal region that I am stuck in and get in into immortality to get into a different dimension an immortal dimension we don't go into a myth or some Supernatural Spirit but we go into a tabernacle a dwelling place oh praise the Lord I got ahead of myself and that might be right here in this building this morning well I don't think that was just back in 1955 that it was stuck in the Branham Tabernacle if you want to transcend regions Dimensions from mortality into immortality he says and that might be right here in this building this morning in a place that no other radio activity or nothing can touch it's there solely fixed by God Alone listen Moses had been dead for 800 years Elijah had been translated for around six or seven hundred years and there they stood on Mount Transfiguration both of them in their mortal looks talking to Jesus just before he went to Calvary see what I mean then what am I trying to say that we are looking at some mythical something a way off out yonder a hundred million years I got a revelation the other day standing up there on Mount polymor Palomar I'm probably saying that wrong at the observatory and seeing the time the space over to Mars and to the last continents and so forth and like traveling at so many thousands miles per second if an angel started from the farthest star and coming here it would take it billions times billion times billions of years to get here I cannot believe that there is a house way out yonder but I believe that that house that God was speaking of is Right present here now that's the place where they're mortal beings when we cease to be mortal here we step into Immortal immortality Yonder into a place and I believe that's where Jesus is today the resurrected Lord Jesus not out yonder somewhere a million miles away but right here present with us now the question is do we want to be stuck in this dimension that we're here as stuck in a mortal condition in a low to see and condition or do we want to transcend Dimensions to step in immortality because remember what Jesus's prayer was that where he is they may be also I don't think that he put a time limit on that to where where I am they may be also when they die I believe that's an open door as it says in Revelation chapter four that if we want to be where he's at we have that capability in that invitation brother random continuing says in the fourth dimension people can prove that right through this room now as coming radioactivity radio messages coming right through this building now is coming television pictures but it's too fast for our eyes now you go millions of miles beyond that Dimension and you'll get into a place that's just as real as television pictures is in this room this morning there is the Lord Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God standing here and the reason I love how he says that if you go millions of miles beyond that you'll find him and then he says there he is the resurrected Son of God standing here and the reason that you can't see him is because our hearts hasn't become tuned down to it I say God tune my heart I say God get me out of the mortal laodicey and hybrid condition that I am stuck in in my mind and in my spirit realm and tune my heart into the frequency and the dimension that you're in I believe that we have had a message come to do that for us I believe that we have the capabilities in our grasp to do that if we will allow it to do that he says in the reason that we can't see the television pictures is because our bodies are not set as instruments to pick up mechanically sent things but when our body becomes in tune with God becoming a part of him then our soul can pick up the power of the Holy Spirit to vindicate the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ and all of his power and omnipotence he is risen from the dead he lives among us today he says I know that's a long ways around but I wanted to get this picture to you so that you'll never forget it I'm glad he took the long way around to make sure I understand the picture that he's seen and that I never forget it back to things that are to be brother Branham says that's where we are we have become from Mortal beings I'll remind you I'm not an English teacher but I'm pretty sure that's past tense we have become from Mortal beings from time beings to Eternal beings when the word of God lit in our souls and we became Sons and Daughters of God with the attributes the gene of God in us to be Sons and Daughters of the father God in heaven crying Abba Father my God my God In My Father's House so this house is a very special house because when you get into this house you no longer are limited by time you're no longer limited by Dimensions you're no longer limited to your mortal resources I would almost say it's a magic house it's a very special house and one that I long to be in and stay in and get tuned into so that it can have an effect on my mortal body 1964 the unveiling of God brother Branham says it was so great until even Moses feared the Quake then if that time he shook just the mountains this time he'll Shake heavens and earth what about this Glory if that was veiled by the natural Veil then this is veiled by a spiritual Veil he says so don't try to look at the natural break into the spirit and see where you're at see what hour we're living in so the prophet standing on the scene he's preaching the unveiling of God and the first thing he wants us to know is get out of the natural if you want to see God get out of the natural break into the spirit to see where you're at he comes in things that are to be and speaks of nothing natural nothing carnal nothing Earthly all spiritual I think I'll speak for myself but I think my Dao still needs tuned a little bit because I find myself caught up in too many natural things not sinful necessarily but Natural Things cares of the world I say Lord adjust my dial tune me in John 16 verse 7 nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you down to verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you unto all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear of that shall he speak and he will show you things to come First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 12 now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is is of God that we may know the things that are freely giving to us of God remember what brother Branham was exhorting us to do get out of the natural get out of the get into the spiritual and that's exactly what Paul is doing here we're not we're not receiving the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual so Paul the first church age messenger was already exhorting the gentile people to do this get out of the natural get into the spiritual get out of the natural get into the spiritual obviously our messenger came on the scene and preached what Paul preached so it's no surprise that he would exhort us to do the same thing first Peter 2 1 wherefore laying aside all malice and all GAO and hypocrises and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby remember these Mansions are not houses made of sticks and stones these Mansions are bodies they are people and in order to build these people as newborn babes desire the the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be if so big ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scriptures behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded so remember our topic is to be called to Mount Zion wherefore to be called to Mount Zion we're obviously going to be built upon the Chief Cornerstone that lays in Zion and that Chief Cornerstone is built up of a living Stone and other living stones and Paul and Peter says that they are a spiritual house these are not the Natural Stone altars that Israel assembled that Joshua when he built after he crossed the Jordan this is not what we were called to but we are called to build up living stones and to be living spiritual habitations Jude 1 verse 20. but ye be loved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life so herein lies the scripture Jesus said that I'm going to go prepare a place but Paul says you're living stones and you need build up into a spiritual habitation or Peter says that Jude comes along and says build up yourself on your Most Holy Faith Brethren Branham would come and preach stature of a perfect man of adding virtues on top of Virtues on top of Virtues so if Jesus went and prepared all of this why do I have to build anything why do I have to do anything why does the scripture say in Revelation that the bride has made herself ready if Jesus went to prepare a place I'm not trying to confuse you I'm just trying to make you think for a second there might be more to this than what we realize there may be two forces at work in two different dimensions and he has prepared a way and made a way for those Dimensions to blend together for you to do what you need to do remember you are elected you are chosen and you are faithful by your own choosing the bride has prepared herself into a living habitation we'll get into that here in just a little bit but I want you to start thinking about it in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 19 says now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone remember that Cornerstone was the stone that was land in Zion the spiritual habitation in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into a holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are building together for a habitation of God through the spirit spiritual habitation spiritual Dwelling Places called to Mount Zion not as Israel called to a spiritual place and that spiritual place has been prepared by our Lord Jesus Christ faith is the substance 1947. I want to start maybe tying these two things together that you can understand what I was referring to Jesus did a work when he was here on Earth he paid the penalty and he went and he presented that sacrifice on the throne to make a way for us if it was not for that we would not stand a chance every one of us would we be rejected when we got there there was none of us capable to pay that penalty none of us to even attempt it but he says I will do that I will go and I will prepare a place for you I will go and I will prepare a way for you but there's multiple scriptures some of them that we just read some that we haven't read to where it clearly states that we have a part in this that the bride is to make herself ready that we are to take the sincere milk of the word and build ourselves up that we are to be written Epistles red of all men that we have something to do this that we are elected that we are called but we have to be faithful to that calling so it's not just him uh well it is him knowing everything but there is an effect that it has on us to make us then do something if you follow me and that's the portion that lays in our hands because remember brother Branham taught that God would never do away with free moral agency [Music] free moral agency is different than election you can be elected and make bad decisions by your free moral agency and hinder I'll say it as brother Raymond says paralyze the plan of God it will never change your election your election is your election it is what it is and you can't change it and you know what I'm happy about that I take great comfort in that I am not looking to argue about that I'm perfectly fine with the system he has in place but we can't disregard that he has obviously laid out portions of scripture that dictate to us I need a response from you remember brother Branham taught us that he created the angels to worship him they didn't have a choice but that's not what he was looking for he was looking for love he was looking to be worshiped out of love out of choice and that's why he had to give us a choice he had to make man different put them on free moral agency so that he's not a dictator to them but they can worship Him in love so there is a part that we play in that 1947 faith is the substance brother Branham says and I would love to be there tonight he's speaking of being back home with his wife and kids many of you know what it is to be away from home don't you say it's just a little old shack but it doesn't take a big whole a big house to make a home it's the character on the inside that makes a home it's the character on the inside that makes a home I can tell many of you have already got ahead of me what good does it do for Jesus to go and prepare you a place if you have no character to put into it because it's the character that's the beauty of the home it's the character that makes the home he can do everything that he has done and that home will set empty that home will set unoccupied because he can't force you to have the appropriate character to make that home that's your choice kind of because you will come to that point but it's your choice of how hard you want that to be and how many scars you want to carry from coming to that position so you will be tuned into that Dimension eventually it's just a matter of how hard you want to make that on yourself 1963 God hiding himself in Simplicity brother Branham says now I think that's our duty to make the inside right speaking of the Tabernacle by the grace of God to be so grateful to God that this will not only be a beautiful building that will come to but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristics of Jesus Christ in every person that comes in may it be a consecrated place to our Lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people so it works on the individual level or I'm sorry it works on the natural level of our natural houses brother Brown says whether it's just a shack it's the character of those people that's in there that make it a home it works in the religious Realms in a church it can be a beautiful Church or it can be a little mission on the corner Church it doesn't matter it can still be ugly or beautiful depending upon the character of the people within so if it works in the natural and it works then the religious World realm in the church what do you think about the individual pretty sure it will hold true Church age brother random says you had better come before it's too late saith the Lord and byeth me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly Rich are we getting it listen to me naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it oh no we are going to take something with us what that something is is all that we can take with us this is super important this is all so it's only the only thing you're going to take and it's all that you're going to take this is exclusively the only thing that you will take with us nothing less and nothing more so we had better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before God so then what will we take with us we will take our character I thought that this quote was all through the message like he said it dozens and dozens of times dozens of times I was shocked that this is the only place that I can find this quote we we all know this quote we all have said this before this is nothing new but I was shocked this is the only place that he Nails this down and says this in the church age book The only thing that we will take is our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of Affliction or will it be with the softness of this characteristic laodicean people character character less laodicean people it is up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden remember we are called to Mount Zion a spiritual habitation but Mount Zion only consists of one thing and that is the character the character of Christ dwelling in each individual Stone you may be little in stature you may be big in stature you may have hundreds of gifts you may have no gifts you may be anything on either end of the spectrum natural and physically naturally but when it comes to spiritual qualifications for Mount Zion the Mount Zion Showdown there is only one thing that's going to make the cut and that is christ-like character 1965 choosing of a bride brother Brandon says that's exactly where the church stands today she sold her word given character so now he's just given us the answer of how we get that character she sold her word given character he's speaking of the worldly church that's what she's done to Satan for a scientific man-made religion when she had the right as a Church of God to stay with the word of God and have the Holy Spirit working among welding the body together with the word and love of God he says we choose by sight God chooses by character character there never was a character like Jesus Christ it lives in you and manifests him I say tune my dial to that that's an adjustment that I'm looking to make living in me manifesting him what station is that on that's what I'm looking for we'll see it's true it's not worldly beauty of him that attracts his bride it's not any worldly beauty of him that attracts his bride it is his character the character of the church that Jesus looks for perfect strength by Perfect weakness and that's the way God wants it realize that we are totally insufficient then God takes that person and begins to mold himself into that person are you adjusting your dial make his hands do what God would have his hands do I like the sound of that turn the volume up make his lips speak what God's lips would speak I like that say it louder because they're not his they're Gods he begins to build a character begins to take this weakness to make his own self so if God's going to build this character and make your hands be his hands and hit your lips be his lips and your weakness to make his own self remember where he started out at in his statement realize that we are totally insufficient then God takes that person so there is what's this big word I'm going to use there is a prerequisite for his lips to be our lip or our lips to be his lips for his hand for our hands to be his hands we first have to realize our insufficientness in identification brother Branham says we've got to take the entire Full Gospel we must and now being that we have identified ourselves as Full Gospel people let's mold our character so this is not a magic wand character this is a character that comes and it has to be built it has to be molded mode or character we're invited to be molded into his image that we might reflect his presence and the works that I do shall ye do also the life that I live so shall you we're invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his what a thing my then when we let his character be in us then we have become Sons by having the mind of Christ mind which is his character your mind makes your character this is another key you'll only get this character by the word and your mind molds your character this is why Satan is the is so polluting the entertainment dimension and he is so taken over and afflicting the people with screens everywhere I can't even pump gas without there being a screen there everywhere you go there is a screen why because Satan knows what God's tactics are he knows how God he knows the plan of God brother random said this he openly declares this not all of it he said there was one portion he didn't know and it's a good thing he didn't know that but he knows how God works and he knows that God is going to use the Mind remember the Battleground was the mind he knows God is going to come through the mind to mold the portion with his word to mold the character of the people so how is he going to mold the character of his people and how is he going to uh delay the people of God coming to their appropriate position he has got to get into a spiritual position an infiltrate and afflict them in their mind to bother their character coming to full fruition so how does he do that he enters that dimension whatever the dimension that is I don't know I always get them wrong so I'm not even going to say anything whatever Dimension that is to where there's screens everywhere and he has to constantly constantly have an image before the people to make them be thinking about something to be seeing something to be entertained by something and again I'm not even saying it's all bad or all what we would say sinful or dirty or smutty it's just I've got to tie up the cogs of their mind because what if by perchance they would start wondering about their Eternal destination and wondering where they come from and wondering about where they stand before their creator don't let them think those kind of thoughts let them think anything else don't let them think those kind of thoughts praise the Lord your mind makes your character this is why young people you have to guard against these things and we can sit here and I can go down the list if you want me to of what what they all are but it doesn't matter I'm not here to preach against social media and name them all if I don't even know half of them but it's out there it's there and if one's not going to catch your attention he'll get another one I mean I don't even know how many social media platforms there are right now why is it one good enough I mean how many social media lives do you have to have it's not about how many you have to have it's about keeping your mind tied up and it doesn't have to be just social media it can be anything it can be a nice hobby not a sinful hobby a nice hobby it can be anything to tie up your mind that is the Battleground that always has been it always will be I want to get off of that because I get carried away but we have to guard against that it is super important and we have to guard against it not in a legalistic way because a legalistic way will never work if I'm not saying don't be militant about it I would encourage you to be militant about it I'm just saying me standing here as a minister trying to be legalistic about it or militant about it it's not going to work it's got to be your decision it's got to be your guardian it's got to be you making the decision to guard your mind and it's not going to be easy because again you if you live in this world the screens are everywhere I mean you almost would have to put on blinders to to avoid it all so it's there we're not going to stick our head in the sand and it all go away and everything's hunky-dory it's there it's something we have to deal with but we have a word to overcome that we have a word to stay on the Forefront of our minds we have a word to guard our eyes your mind makes your character let the Mind Paul said of Christ this mind that was in Christ be in you let that mind of Christ be in you it molds the character of a son of God oh mercy things that are to be brother Brandon says now remember the Bible says if this Earthly Tabernacle of our dwelling if it perish if it be dissolved we have one already waiting just as the little baby it's little muscles in the mother are twisting internal he's talking about a natural birth now natural childbirth and you notice you can take a woman if she is ever so foul but when she's to become a mother a little before that baby is born there's a kindness about the woman get around her there's always something she's more tender why there's a little angel Spirit waiting to receive that natural body just as soon as it's born the Breath of Life comes into it and God breathes it in there and it becomes a living Soul now just as this baby is being born speaking of the natural one then the spiritual body is here to receive it and now when this body is dropped here speaking of the natural body when this natural body is dropped in this earth like the baby is dropped also there is an immortal body waiting to receive the spirit back into itself I want to lay emphasis on back into itself because if you go back into something that means you were already there at some point I better keep going because I'm fixing to get really excited it will go receive it don't ask me to to answer how that works Saints I don't have a clue I just know it will work and I know it's true but it will re it will receive its back into itself oh what a great thing I agree what a great thing we are now in Christ Jesus babies babes in Christ children of God waiting for the full Deliverance at the coming of our Lord Jesus to receive us up into himself when their body this Mortal will take on immortality notice how the expecting mother craves for certain things the mother in the birth of the baby if there's something lacking in her body she begins to Crave certain things look how dad would just pinch Corners everything to get it for her remember we're talking about character see it's her the body her body the calcium and so forth of her body and the vitamins that she needs Juni is being made up and he craves for things foods for the coming child when there's something needed the mother gives witness of it see her system is made up that's how that when there's something needed here to the oncoming child the mother begins to Crave for that speaking naturally changes a gear now stop a minute why do we have revivals why do we assemble ourselves together why am I always rebuking the people why does the Holy Spirit keep crying out I it knows that there's something lacking there we must be in the full stature of Jesus Christ we must be Sons and Daughters of God we must act like God's children he's saying saying why do we do all of this religious stuff that we do why does the Holy Spirit keep coming on the scene why do we have meetings why do we assemble ourselves because that body knows there's something lacking well remember there's only one thing you can take to that body character so your character my my character your character there is something lacking and the Holy Spirit will come on the scene for that lack he says now think if God in his Mercy has the mother before the little baby is born it's craving for some vitamin and the mother's word speak forth dad I want cantaloupe or watermelon I want something another why he'll do everything he can to get that because he knows that he wants his child to be born as perfect as it can be see how much more abler is he to get it he's a Creator now think how able he is to prepare us a body to live like his own glorious body he is so able to prepare us a body that he bled and died for this message that's how he prepared you a body because your body is a word body your body is a christ-like character body and there's only one way that you can get that and that's through the message of this album the words that I speak to you they are spirit and they are life there is no other word out there there is no other man's idea out there that can give you the christ-like character that you need to go to the house he's prepared for you why did he have to send Malachi for because my body was crying for it why did he have to loose the seals himself because my body was crying for it I needed spiritual vitamins to go to my spiritual habitation and there was only one channel for it to get there spiritual food in due season to build up a body there is something in us to call that calls to live and there is something in us that calls to do right then God will call somebody on the platformer to the pulpit that will preach the absolute truth why it shows you then if you're a real child of God you begin to cry out God take it away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me why it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to where he's going to prepare it goes to show you that he has gone to prepare it but there is something else needed what is needed a christ-like character I've got to skip some of this but I believe you've got the point There Are Spiritual vitamins needed for that body that body is made up of christ-like character and the only way to get that christ-like character is through the message of this album as delivered by Malachi 4 as delivered by Revelation 10 7. I believe you've got that I can skip a lot of this he says we live in the day the spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening it's happening day by day remember what we said earlier don't put this somewhere far off Yonder a billion light years away he says it could be right here in this building right now and it's happening day by day why it's it's accumulating so fast out there in those deserts and things taking place that I couldn't even keep up with it we're near the coming of Jesus to be United with his church where the word becomes the word you wrap your mind around that praise the Lord we're closing Satan takes the poison darts of hell and tries to bruise the church that's in travail with the baby and before it's ever born they kill it why do you think abortion is on a rampage because it's Satan tactics remember brother Brandon says whatever happens natural is happening spiritual Satan is that cruel Satan is not a courageous Warrior Saints he will kill you at your weakest point he is not going to wait for a fair battle you think that little baby in the womb has a chance from the doctor going in there with his scalpel and satanic Inspire inspired instruments and sucking it out of the womb of a of a mother I mean the I don't even want to go into it's because it's so hideous that's Satan for you kill it before it even has a chance brother Branham says that's what he does to us spiritually kill it before it even has a chance that's why you take the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in baptism you better watch out because he's coming for you you're a newborn babe and he's going to kill you in the womb before it tries to give birth before you get to the Holy Ghost he's going to try to kill you he is going I don't know why I'm going down this route but praise the Lord he is not going to wait until you come to the stature of a perfect man before he says okay there's a worthy adversary let's go no Saints he's going to get you as soon as he thinks that you are a threat to him or maybe even possibly a threat to him I encourage you let yourself be born let yourself be a babe and feed on the sincere milk of the word don't let him kill you as a baby make him kill you as a man if he's going to kill you as a full adult make him earn it he's not a fair fighter he says You must take spiritual vitamins learning and that brings forth the baby to a birth so if you're wanting to be born again take the word eat the word be born here in a couple weeks little for sale is not going to have an option of whether she's been born she's going to be born I challenge you to eat the word of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 7 and not be born I challenge you to do that it's impossible his word will not fail you will be born again with the character of Christ he says 1963 accepting God's provided way at the end time but all when you're in Flight amen when you're in Flight you pick up more than your denominational Creed you pick up the vitamins the spiritual vitamins that builds a body that's solid full of muscles with wing feathers that can lift you up off your feet and show you things that is to come or may I say things that are to be the Holy Spirit when he the Holy Spirit has come he will show you these things to you he will reveal these things to you that I've told you and he will show you things that is to come brother Branham in 1958 he says and we've been taught not only through Pentecostal Realms but through the Holiness group and the Baptist and what more that when you're born again were sons of God that's true but that's just the beginning it's your character from then on is what makes the difference you got it I don't need to say it again in the thought iron Church age brother Branham says scripture speaking I know your faith now he does not stay stay here as he did to the church in pergamus you hold my faith he is not talking about his faith now but he is commending them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentions their patience and this is what I want to end on tonight and as he does he also mentions their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in James 1 3 The Train of your faith workers worketh patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience how highly God regards this outworking of our patients is seen in James 4 but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect an entire lacking nothing God's will for us is perfection do we all agree with that do we all want perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development how many wants a christ-like character this is the process of character development waiting on God and waiting for God in the church age book on is italicized 4 is italicized so he's drawing specific attention to waiting on God and waiting for God I don't know that I have a complete understanding of why yet this is the way that I take it though is we can wait on God for an answer let's just take something simple healing we need healing in our body we can wait on God with patience on how he wants to heal us because we know God has many manifestations of healing so we can seek God for healing and we can seek God for how he wants to heal us and we can wait on him for that answer but he may give you the answer of how he's going to heal you and you still have to wait for him to manifest it does that make sense so it's not just enough in my opinion this is a scriptural teaching because I believe this is what Abel did Abel in my opinion did not just have a revelation on what the sacrifice was to be but he had a revelation on when to give the sacrifice the same as we can have a revelation of how God wants to heal us but we have to wait on God to do it that's why brother Brandon says when you come through the prayer line and I pray for you you're healed but it may be three months before it manifests this is a simple principle but brother Branham says this is the process of character development patience waiting on God and waiting for God now you can take it as simple as you want or as deep as you want but patience waiting on God for the answer and waiting for God to manifest that is the only way you will ever demonstrate christ-like character because that is exactly what Jesus did he says I do nothing but first the father show me I'm going to give you a little secret here you are not going to have to fight this battle over something you don't care about how long it takes or something you're not interested in let me make it really simple or really silly I'm not going to fight the Battle of when God is going to give me a Lamborghini I am not going to have to endure with patience and develop a christ-like character and suffer the fiery Trials of affliction over a Lamborghini because I don't need a Lamborghini and I don't care about a Lamborghini you understand the principle there's too many people in here and I don't have the gift of discernment to go through them and give you the list but the trial that you're facing and the battle that you're fighting that you're waiting on God for and waiting for God for is the very situation that God himself has laid before you to give you an opportunity to show christ-like character without the thing that you are suffering with right now you cannot prove to Satan that you're not like the first Thief this is your and mine only opportunity to prove to the devil that we're not like her [Music] and I don't say that to belittle what you're going through right now because I guarantee you it's real and I guarantee you you're really suffering I'm not belittle that I'm not telling you to get over it I'm not telling you that you know uh to man up and you know move on with life I know it's real and I know it's a fiery trial of Affliction because I've been there and I've done that and I would say that I'm currently there and doing that but why don't we be called to Mount Zion for a second as the musicians would come why don't we stop being a carnal natural people for just a second and allow the spirit of Christ to move into our mind and to change our mind for a second to where we don't have an Earthly view of this situation that we're in right now and again I want to stress I'm not saying it's not real saints because if it wasn't real it wouldn't affect you and if it wouldn't affect you there would be no Victory and there would be no character because character is we know this character is not a gift it's not given it has to be earned you CA you can't develop character by something that's not real and that you don't care about that don't have an effect on you it's not possible if you don't care about something you don't care about something if you don't overcome something there's no there's no victory and you're not going to fight a battle that you don't care about and you're not going to overcome something you don't care about I trust that makes sense to you but why don't we allow ourselves to be called as Paul said as a spiritual people and be called to Mount Zion and to look at things from Mount Zion for a second and look into the back part of God's mind that we have so graciously been given the opportunity to do through a prophet that God sent to us and to realize the thing that I'm going through right now it is real and I am suffering and it is a fiery furnace of affliction but this is my one and only opportunity as a mortal to make my stand and to prove to Satan that I'm not like the first Thief remember we're only fighting the battle that was fought in the garden and the battle that was fought in the garden was patience that's what brother Branham said he says Eve couldn't wait I'll refresh your memory Eve wasn't waiting on a Lamborghini Eve didn't care about a Lamborghini Eve cared about reproducing because that was the promise of God but she didn't know how and she couldn't wait brother Brandon says and she messed everything up Eve wanted to be a mother not sinful and completely in the word of God Saints I believe there is a people in the face of the Earth that have come back to that position as Eve did we are not here designing sinful worldly things we are here exclusively Desiring the perfect will of God in our life but let me tell you it's not going to be easy it's going to come through a fiery trial of Affliction because in order to truly prove that we're not like that first Eve Satan has got to lay before the people of God every opportunity every opportunity and every situation to take your own idea and until we as a body overcome each one of those situations and rely on God and for God we're not going anywhere but thanks be to God he has sent us spiritual food and due season and he has placed something within to cry for that food and that is an invincible Army that is not something that Satan can overcome the only thing he can do is afflict our spirit realm and our mind to try to get us unfocused and to think that we can do something about it ourselves and not rely on God and for God and defy the principle of patience and take our own way and when he does that he's paralyzed the program of God he's not beaten it because that'll Circle right back around and you'll get another chance at it or maybe it'll go to the next member of the bride and they'll get a chance at it I don't know how all that works I don't know who keeps track of all of that but one way or the other brother brainer says this bride of Jesus Christ will be tested in every facet mentally emotionally physically I would say financially I would say psychologically I would say whatever a situation you can put in there she will be tested in every aspect I thank God I don't think one individual has to Bear all of that because I don't think we could but collectively we will and praise be to God he has given us the message of the hour to form the character that we need to fit in to that place that has been prepared Christ as we would stand Christ has went and prepared that place for us but remember Christ does not come all the way to the Earth when he gets his bride we meet him in the air which means we take something there I may be wrong but I don't think I am I believe what we take with us into the air is our character and I believe that we have been graciously given us the word given a word that we don't have to wonder if it's going to work we don't have to be despondent and in despair but we can have the mind of Christ to have a proper understanding this will work if I wait on him and I wait for him in every situation of my life and that's not going to be easy I cannot stress that enough here this evening since it is not going to be easy it is not going to be easy if it was easy it wouldn't be a battle if it was easy it wouldn't be written in the scriptures of fiery Trials of affliction it's not going to be easy it's going to be real and it's going to be something you care about and it's going to be something that you're wanting an answer to pretty quickly those are the situations that I pray God will give me and you the grace somehow as the prophet said something come tumbling down through a mystical Channel and strike me in the heart and make me change my dimensions for a second and recognize I am not just a mortal being limited to a mortal habitation but I have access to a different dimension and I'm going to tap into that is this that I'm dealing with real does it look like I need to hurry up and make a decision yes does this hurt yes is this uncomfortable yes but I know one thing for certain I don't have the answer to this problem but I know one thing for certain I can't take my own reasoning in my own way if it means just standing here and standing here and not doing anything I think I've got a scripture for that when you've done all that you can do just stand and stand and do what nothing wait for it wait on him and wait for him as our pastor would come let's pray together precious Lord Jesus we thank you for this time that you've given us this evening Lord father there are not words to express our gratitude to you that is Darkness and gross Darkness has overtaken this entire Earth you in your grace in your mercy sent us the gift of a prophet that you could come and step into that gift yourself and reveal your character and live your character before us so that we would not stumble around in our own ideas in our own decisions and our own reasonings but if we would yield ourselves and be faithful to the word that you have given us and be patient and wait on you and for you you will provide us the answer for every situation Lord it may not come when we want it to and it may not come how we want it to but one thing is for certain you are a not like a man and you will not lie and you have promised us that if we would wait we would raise rise up like eagle with wings like an eagle God please come and help us Lord the world is spinning so fast and we are such a busy people and multiple situations will come at us on a daily basis Lord and if you don't come and if you don't extend your grace into our life we are going to take our own ways and we are going to fall into our human mind and make decisions that are not going to have the right outcome Lord Lord we are going to find ourselves under pressure and make a decision that we should not make we are going to find ourselves not waiting on you for the answer and waiting for you to manifest it Lord I pray tonight that you would extend your grace upon us prick our hearts Lord when we're about to do something like that father rearrange our thinking Lord call us up to Mount Zion father and give us a different perspective and Lord as your Prophet said may we go through these trials doing the only thing that we can do to prove our love back to you and that is to conduct ourselves with joy amongst them for Lord may we not be a despondent people for we have the answer to the devil's question may we conduct ourselves appropriately Lord Lord we love you and we appreciate you we worship you for what you have done to us done for us Lord and we pray that we would just fulfill our portion of the scripture now father Lord you have called us you have chosen us Lord I pray you would extend your mercy to us and let us be faithful to you Lord we love you we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you brother Lord I know the times [Music] all my works and all my Deeds every prayer set on my knees lay before the holy consuming fire all I want to see is all I want to see is him in me all I want to see [Music] [Applause] words of knowledge in his name and Healing Hands that touch the lane before the woman Jesus [Music] all I want to see is him [Music] all I want to see is up and hear him hear him say [Applause] well done before [Music] oh I see [Music] one to see is hear me all I want to see Jesus amen oh I want that character amen I have no power in myself to produce it but I believe his brother Ben said we've been given a word we've been given a word amen instruct us to teach us to show us the way and that word wasn't just preached it was demonstrated before us the life of a prophet amen whatever dial has to be turned in me that click me into that channel I want it clicked in me too I don't want to think carnal I want to think spiritual in any and he quoted the prophet when he said all that we can take with us this character and then the prophet asked what kind of character will we take with us I can tell you what kind of character I want to take I know what my heart is and where my desire is but it's going to be by his grace and it's going to be by his word and I learned tonight that it's going to take a whole lot of patience a whole lot of waiting on the Lord a whole lot of being still and doing nothing with everything around me screaming for action have you ever been there where everything around you screaming for action but you have no idea what to do that's the time just to wait a little longer until we know what to do amen I'm sure job wanted his trial to end I'm sure job wanted the pain to go away I mean look at the pain that man was in physical pain emotional pain he was being now not only losing all of his natural resources all of his assets he now is being challenged by his wife she's turned against him become like an enemy to him amen then this physical pain that he has in his body and then the pain of rejection where his friends are now accusing him of not even being the right kind of believer amen it didn't get better for him every stage it kept getting worse and kept getting worse and kept getting worse and God ordained this trial because there was something there was a character leaving in Job that God knew and God knew that job could meet the challenge but he also knew Job needed to gain something foreign [Music] there's so many challenges that come our way and maybe God knows what's in us maybe he knows better what's in us than we know what's in us and we think there's no way I can endure this trial but he's already known that you can but there's also something you and I need to gain in the trial say God help us to be patient and then one thing that's beautiful about patience when we wait [Music] you know when we know exactly what to do we do it and all of a sudden we start sharing in the glory of the Lord this happened and I knew this and this word came to mind I took this action and look it all worked out but when you have to wait because you don't know what to do and you don't have the answer and it doesn't come easy and you have to wait on God you have to wait for God by the time you get to the end of that trial you say I had no idea what to do I could not solve my problem I had to wait and supernaturally God provided an answer then all of a sudden who gets all the glory you're not sharing in anything because you had no clue what to do you had to wait because you didn't have the answer amen that's why it's good to wait and let God be the mighty one Among Us let's just humble ourselves before him and keep him in position amen and keep trusting and keep waiting for God to come and see God is good man this was a good good instruction tonight good instruction I want to take it home and make it part of my life amen God bless you all I'm going to give a very special welcome to Sister Hannah Levy it's good to have you she's been away for a while with Bethany but it's good to have you back for a visit God bless you it's good to see you here man it's good to see you all may God bless you amen as we go may this be more than a sermon may become a life lesson and I'm I'm sure that we're going to get an opportunity probably tomorrow some of us will get to apply this amen and I pray that God will bring this back to my memory quickly so that I can apply when I meet the next challenge amen let's just bow our heads and thank God lord Jesus we thank you for your word I don't want to leave this building without saying thank you Lord thank you for giving me an opportunity thank you for opening my eyes thank you for giving me the instruction from your word to go out and live this life you've called me to and I pray God that you'd be gracious to us so that you would bring this back to our remembrance Lord and the time when the pressure comes on maybe as early as tonight or tomorrow it'll come but God you've given us good instruction may we take it to heart and may become a practice in our lives and may Lord through the practice of patience may we gain all the things that we need to gain so that we can take this perfect character with us Lord you told us that the sleeping Saints are waiting for this church to come to perfection well they're not they're waiting they're they're in support they're crying out for us to keep pressing on because they without us are not yet made perfect for there must be a display of your life and flesh once again and it must be in your bride form oh God help us to be patient as you display yourself help us to wait as you manifest yourself once again upon this Earth in human flesh In the Flesh of your bride God is going to take a whole lot of trust a whole lot of patience as we trust you to do what only you can do we love you Lord and we want to just say we're thankful for the food that you've given us today God may it become Lord more than a tickling sermon in our ears or something more than we can just say I agree with that or I agree with this or don't agree with that maybe go beyond all of that may become a real manifestation within us and a way of life all around us we love you God I pray to go with your people Lord as we go from here bless us keep us safe use us and magnify yourself through us and declare yourself to the world through us we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you all but like all I want to see is Jesus [Music] [Music] all I want to see is Jesus [Music] and hear him say and hear him say well done I gracious one well done well done my feet [Music] to Caesars all I want to he is [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh hardly the legally we didn't take something special to reveal his and Majesty so I know if I give him [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but if I just speak and let him have his way in the glory unto Glory they'll change me day by day [Music] my heart foreign [Music] [Music] if I just need to just leave my vessel and let him have his way Glory to change me day by day before in the manger of my heart [Music] of play and you move me day by day let your words [Music] let your words before in the manger of my heart [Music] living science and only day my day let your word be born in the manger [Music]
