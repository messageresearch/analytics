[0:06] i
[0:08] belong to jesus
[0:13] he
[0:14] purchased me
[0:20] and i'm all kids
[0:25] [Music]
[0:31] the blood of jesus
[0:43] [Music]
[0:46] is
[1:01] he
[1:02] purchased me
[1:06] and i'm all his
[1:29] [Music]
[1:35] praise the lord
[1:37] god bless you all this evening it's so
[1:39] good to see you
[1:40] amen it's good to be together
[1:43] it's good to worship the lord i
[1:44] appreciate the atmosphere and the songs
[1:46] that were sung
[1:47] and the sweet presence of the lord
[1:49] while we're standing let's go ahead and
[1:51] take our bibles and to turn to the book
[1:53] of revelation
[1:54] i'm going to continue on
[1:57] with the same thought that we started on
[1:59] sunday and we're just going to ask the
[2:01] lord to give us an extra major measure
[2:04] of grace as we move forward
[2:06] but i'd like to begin with revelation
[2:09] chapter 1 verse 1. i don't think i
[2:11] properly gave the title last time but i
[2:14] i wrote on the top of my paper here the
[2:16] mystery revealed
[2:17] in the revelation gaps
[2:20] the mystery revealed in the revelation
[2:23] gaps
[2:24] so we'll see if any of that makes any
[2:26] sense as we move forward
[2:28] let's read revelations one and one
[2:30] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[2:32] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[2:35] things which must shortly come to pass
[2:38] and he sent and signified it by his
[2:40] angel unto his servant john
[2:43] so these things that he's going to
[2:45] reveal are things that must shortly come
[2:48] to pass
[2:50] two thousand years ago
[2:51] or shortly come to pass when he sent and
[2:54] signified it by an angel to his servant
[2:56] john
[2:57] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[3:00] dear lord jesus we thank you father for
[3:02] your word
[3:03] god as it continues to unfold itself
[3:05] before us lord we see you more clearly
[3:07] than we ever have before and lord that's
[3:10] our desire to see you unveiled and while
[3:12] we pray that you just continue lord to
[3:15] unlock this word to your bride that you
[3:17] would whisper the secrets in our ears
[3:19] the love secrets of the mysteries that
[3:21] you've been revealing to us all along
[3:23] the way
[3:24] and god i pray that you give us eyes to
[3:26] see and ears to hear in our heart to
[3:28] perceive all that you have for us lord i
[3:30] pray that you'd anoint these lips of
[3:32] clay lord this vessel inadequate as it
[3:34] may be lord it's the method you chose
[3:37] and we're trusting in you to come and do
[3:38] the supernatural that you would speak
[3:41] eternal words through lips of clay that
[3:43] you would speak lord truth lord through
[3:45] lips that are failed my god we're
[3:47] trusting in you not in the lips lord not
[3:49] in the man but we're trusting in you
[3:51] that your holy spirit would come and
[3:53] pick up the gift that's laying here and
[3:55] use it for your glory and for the
[3:56] edification of your people
[3:59] bless us lord have the preeminence among
[4:01] us we pray in jesus christ's name amen
[4:05] you can all be seated if we can bring up
[4:06] the power point please brother franco
[4:10] we'll go to uh the first slide
[4:14] i'm gonna
[4:15] read a quote
[4:17] from brother branham out of the seventh
[4:18] seal and i come across this some time
[4:21] ago but i've always really enjoyed this
[4:23] quote brother bram says now
[4:25] where where are we at friends the seals
[4:27] and everything opening now we're getting
[4:29] in this between here there it is see
[4:32] where we're sitting i hope you get it i
[4:35] haven't got no education and i know what
[4:37] i'm talking about but maybe i can't
[4:39] explain it explain it
[4:41] explain it to make sense to you
[4:44] but i hope that god takes the words it's
[4:46] mixed up and divides them out right you
[4:48] see and lets you know what it is because
[4:50] we're at the door we're here at the time
[4:52] the brother says i've got no education
[4:55] but i know what i'm talking about
[4:58] brother venom knew he saw it he saw the
[5:00] revelation he knew but with limited
[5:02] vocabulary limited uh what he said
[5:05] limited education he knew what he was
[5:07] talking about but he couldn't explain it
[5:09] maybe in a way that it made sense to you
[5:11] amen but he saw it and it made sense to
[5:14] him but he was having trouble explaining
[5:16] it amen and so i i say god bless us
[5:20] today because i feel the same way amen
[5:22] there's some things that god are just
[5:24] dropping in my heart some things that
[5:25] are opening for me
[5:27] some of the things the prophet has said
[5:29] and i see it more clearly than ever
[5:31] before but how to say it i don't know
[5:33] and i may not be able to explain it
[5:36] in a way that makes sense to you but
[5:38] we're just going to pray that the holy
[5:39] ghost will connect the pieces
[5:41] i thought how amazing it is that the
[5:44] holy ghost gives revelation
[5:47] right he gives revelation but yet he
[5:49] still requires the preaching of the word
[5:51] that's what he wants
[5:53] so he takes a beautiful revelation
[5:56] and he passes it through a corrupted
[5:59] vessel that's been purged by the blood
[6:00] of jesus christ but yet still an
[6:02] imperfect vessel
[6:03] with inabilities and and and wrong forms
[6:06] of speech and all kinds of things and he
[6:09] brings it out in that halted fashion and
[6:11] and broke up and whatever
[6:14] and then we've got to depend on the holy
[6:16] ghost on the other side to take that
[6:17] that's broken up and messed up and put
[6:19] it back together in a perfect revelation
[6:21] again
[6:23] only god would set something up to work
[6:25] this way
[6:27] because god wants to make sure that it's
[6:28] by revelation not intellectual
[6:30] understanding but by revelation amen so
[6:33] he'll use a man who will get things
[6:35] wrong get details wrong say things wrong
[6:38] but the revelation will be true and
[6:40] it'll connect the revelation on the
[6:42] other end and it'll be true in the start
[6:44] and true and the finish and it can and
[6:46] and the man can mess it all up in
[6:48] between
[6:49] right
[6:51] like brother branham you know he'll
[6:53] he'll say things wrong and he'll catch
[6:54] himself and correct himself but it
[6:57] didn't change the revelation
[6:59] it was right amen so we just trust the
[7:01] lord to help us
[7:03] and when we look here at the beginning
[7:05] of the church age book we read this
[7:07] introduction out of the revelation of
[7:09] jesus christ last time but i'd like to
[7:11] read it again
[7:13] said through this volume will concern
[7:15] itself with the various major doctrines
[7:17] such as godhead water baptism etc found
[7:19] in revelation chapters 1-3 its main
[7:22] theme is the setting forth of a detailed
[7:24] study of the seven church ages
[7:26] this is necessary in order to study and
[7:29] understand the rest of revelation for
[7:31] out of the ages come the seals out of
[7:33] the seals come the trumpets out of the
[7:35] trumpets come the viles like the first
[7:38] burst of a roman candle the church ages
[7:40] come forth with a mighty initial
[7:42] illumination without which there could
[7:44] be no further light but once the
[7:46] brilliance of the seven church ages is
[7:48] given by divine revelation light upon
[7:51] light follows until the whole of
[7:53] revelation opens wide before our
[7:55] wondering eyes and we edified and
[7:58] purified by its spirit are made ready
[8:00] for his glorious appearing even our lord
[8:02] and savior the one true god jesus christ
[8:07] praise be to god
[8:10] so
[8:11] brother remember says
[8:12] we'll walk in the light the beautiful
[8:14] light one step at a time lord coming
[8:16] closer to him yeah children of the light
[8:18] accept his word keep walking and watch
[8:21] more unfold don't leave it no matter
[8:23] what somebody else says stay right in
[8:25] that and just keep walking with it watch
[8:28] it unfold and reveal itself
[8:31] and so brother remember said out of the
[8:33] church ages will come the seals out of
[8:35] the seals comes the trumpets out of the
[8:36] trumpets comes the vials amen and
[8:39] brother branham is not talking about one
[8:41] will start and stop and then the other
[8:43] will start and stop because we know that
[8:44] the seals are overlaid with the church
[8:46] ages
[8:48] and the trumpets also are overlaid and
[8:50] the vials have an overlay there's an
[8:52] overlap all the way through it's not
[8:53] like well out of out of the church ages
[8:56] come the seals know the seals and the
[8:57] church ages overlap
[9:00] have a big overlap but he's saying out
[9:02] of the revelation of one amen comes
[9:04] another and the revelation becomes
[9:06] another and comes another like a burst
[9:08] of a roman candle comes out and
[9:09] illuminates then there's more
[9:11] illumination then off of that more
[9:13] illumination amen until the whole of
[9:15] revelation is open before our wondering
[9:18] eyes
[9:19] amen so we should never stop this
[9:22] pursuit amen of the whole of revelation
[9:24] open before our wondering eyes
[9:26] we can't open it it takes the lamb to
[9:28] open it amen but we should never stop
[9:31] wanting to walk in the light as he is in
[9:33] the light
[9:33] [Music]
[9:35] and and if we just stay there if we walk
[9:37] with it
[9:38] stay with it walk with it watch it
[9:41] unfold and reveal itself
[9:45] amen we don't have to do anything just
[9:46] rest just keep walking with him and
[9:48] watch him do it we we're looking at the
[9:51] book of revelation and i put this here
[9:53] because we're actually looking
[9:55] in some ways at the construction of the
[9:57] book of revelation actually how it's
[10:00] written the order that it's written and
[10:02] you come to the introduction in chapter
[10:04] one you go to chapter two in chapter
[10:06] three and you have the seven church ages
[10:09] amen you end chapter three with christ
[10:12] on the outside
[10:13] he's been rejected and put outside the
[10:15] church ages outside of the laodicean
[10:17] church age and that's where we find him
[10:19] amen and then the very next thing that
[10:21] happens you come to chapter four amen
[10:23] chapter four is going to bring us into
[10:25] setting the scene setting the stage for
[10:27] the breach amen and in that
[10:30] you're going gonna find an open door in
[10:32] heaven and a voice from heaven saying
[10:33] come up higher
[10:35] so there's a rapture there's a catching
[10:37] up there's another revelation coming
[10:39] amen after jesus christ is put on the
[10:42] outside and the laodicean church age now
[10:44] there's another step to take
[10:47] and that's through the open door into
[10:49] heaven and to see what he saw
[10:51] and then we know we go to the breach
[10:53] let me move move through here
[11:00] and we find that between the seven
[11:02] church ages and between the seven seals
[11:05] there's what brother branham calls the
[11:06] breach
[11:08] and and in the breach
[11:09] there's this is a gap this is one of the
[11:11] mysteries in the gap we don't go
[11:13] straight from seven church ages right to
[11:15] seven seals because you've got to pass
[11:17] through the breach first because you've
[11:18] got to understand to go from the church
[11:21] ages to the seals there has to be an
[11:23] event that takes place
[11:26] so you've got to have a gap here because
[11:28] without a gap if the bible was written
[11:30] just from the seven church ages said to
[11:32] the revelation of the seven seals we
[11:34] wouldn't realize what has to happen for
[11:37] the revelation of the seven seals to
[11:38] come forth in order for the revelation
[11:40] of the seals come forth there's got to
[11:42] be something that takes place in the
[11:44] heavenly realm and there's got to be a
[11:46] call for one who's worthy to come and
[11:48] take the book of redemption and loose
[11:50] the seven seals and without somebody
[11:52] being able to come forth and fill
[11:54] fulfill the legal obligation in the
[11:56] courts of heaven a kinsmen redeemer a
[11:58] bowass type then we can't move into the
[12:01] revelation of the seventh seal seven
[12:03] seals so when brother branham is moving
[12:05] into the book of revelation he's
[12:07] actually moving if you watch his
[12:09] ministry he's moving according to the
[12:11] way the book is constructed
[12:15] so so brother branham we talked about
[12:17] the days of the ten toes and the two big
[12:20] uh toes in the eisenhower and khrushchev
[12:22] we went through all of that and in that
[12:24] day there will be a stone cut out of the
[12:26] mountain without hands to smite the
[12:28] image and the feet and brother benham
[12:30] recognizes that's it friends we're at
[12:32] the end brother adam when he saw that he
[12:34] knew you couldn't go past toes and so he
[12:37] knew we were at the end and he knew that
[12:39] those seals were sealed up until the
[12:41] time of the end and he knew now it's
[12:43] time for this mysterious book this book
[12:46] of revelation to unfold itself
[12:49] and he starts at that that that incident
[12:52] of slamming the shoe on the table in the
[12:54] u.n comes in the 12th of october 1960
[12:57] and then brother branham comes right at
[12:59] the beginning of december and starts
[13:01] preaching the revelation of jesus christ
[13:02] series which is the church ages
[13:05] and then he goes into 1961 and he
[13:08] preaches revelation chapter four and he
[13:10] preaches revelation chapter five a
[13:12] couple parts on that and he stops and he
[13:14] doesn't do anything else he doesn't move
[13:17] into the seals he doesn't preach the
[13:19] seals he doesn't do anything because he
[13:21] can't do anything till somebody comes in
[13:24] the breach amen and can take the book
[13:26] and loose the seals because brother
[13:28] branham can't lose the seals
[13:31] so he can't just keep preaching he's got
[13:34] to stop and there's a gap right in our
[13:36] bible so we know that there's a gap
[13:39] there's a breach somebody's got to come
[13:41] and fill the breach so that we can move
[13:43] to the revelation of the seven seals
[13:47] the bible's actually written so that we
[13:49] can catch the mystery in the way it's
[13:51] written brother branham said even in the
[13:53] paragraphs even in the numbers of the
[13:55] verses
[13:57] the mysteries are laying there it's
[13:59] constructed in a way to draw us in and
[14:01] so now brother ben can talk about
[14:03] chapter four he can talk about chapter
[14:05] five but he can't take that book and
[14:07] loose the zeal so he can't go into
[14:08] chapter six
[14:10] so he waits a year and a half until he
[14:13] gets to search as this the time and it
[14:15] serves as this the time now he starts to
[14:18] to catch that it's going to be the third
[14:19] pool amen it could be could it be those
[14:22] seven mysterious thunders that's laying
[14:24] back there amen that holds the secret of
[14:26] the whole thing and he goes out west and
[14:28] he gets the the sword in the hand in
[14:30] january of 1963 amen and that sword is
[14:34] is the word in the hand amen it's the
[14:36] third pool it's the opening of the word
[14:37] that's coming into his hand
[14:40] and then in in in
[14:43] in
[14:44] january 28th we see the picture amen the
[14:47] cloud in the sky amen marking he says
[14:50] who is that he said that's our lord up
[14:51] there
[14:53] that's a major marker friends
[14:56] now brother branham now is watching the
[14:58] events unfold amen that now he's caught
[15:01] up into the constellation of the seven
[15:03] angels amen and he's told to go back
[15:06] east amen to preach the seven seals and
[15:09] he goes back and starches in march
[15:11] purchase the seven seals he doesn't know
[15:13] what they are he can't preach the seven
[15:15] seals by his own authority he can only
[15:18] preach because there was a there was a
[15:19] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[15:21] word that was worthy to take the book
[15:23] and loose the seals thereof amen and so
[15:26] he waits every day for an angel to come
[15:28] and bring him the fresh manna from
[15:30] heaven and he'll come out and preach it
[15:33] why because he can't he can't just go
[15:36] into revelation chapter 6 until somebody
[15:40] fulfills the requirements in the breach
[15:44] so when we read the message i mean when
[15:46] you start reading the message and you
[15:48] read the message it's like when you
[15:49] first start reading the bible it's it's
[15:52] old king james english you don't
[15:53] understand it i don't get all the words
[15:56] but you keep reading and keep reading
[15:57] and the pictures keep unveiling and
[15:59] unveiling and the same thing with the
[16:00] message you keep reading and you keep
[16:02] reading and you keep reading and all of
[16:04] a sudden you see something more than
[16:06] just the ink vlots on paper you see the
[16:08] story unfolding you see the timeline
[16:10] unfold you see the story of redemption
[16:13] it's unfolding right in the life of a
[16:15] prophet
[16:16] but the man says a word become a prophet
[16:19] becomes the word for his age
[16:21] his very life indicates what's happening
[16:24] amen and we begin to watch that
[16:27] so in the breach the breach is important
[16:30] and it holds a vital mystery and the
[16:32] vital mystery contained in the breach is
[16:34] the event that everybody's been waiting
[16:37] for for somebody to take the book and
[16:39] loose the seals thereof and then once
[16:41] that's happened now brother branham can
[16:43] come and preach the revelation of the
[16:44] seven seals
[16:46] so there's a great mystery here
[16:49] but the mystery is more than white horse
[16:52] red horse there's more there's a mystery
[16:54] in the gap between and the mystery in
[16:56] the gap is the one who's worthy to take
[16:58] the book
[17:00] has to come and reveal the book
[17:02] so who came
[17:06] see the mystery in the gap
[17:09] amen praise be to god
[17:12] brother ma'am says
[17:14] well hold on i want to
[17:16] i want to read this in the feast of
[17:18] trumpets so go into the prophet's
[17:20] chamber and watch them seven steps where
[17:22] where did the guard meet the challenge
[17:24] to bring the comer into the presence of
[17:25] the king at the top of the steps was in
[17:28] the seventh step
[17:29] there shows that we've got to come again
[17:31] with the same spirit that was on john he
[17:34] introduced the messiah he was greater
[17:36] than all the prophets he introduced it
[17:38] and we've got to come to a place again
[17:40] to something that's going to introduce
[17:42] the messiah
[17:44] so brother is telling you we've got to
[17:46] have a repeat of what happened in john's
[17:48] day he was elijah the same thing has to
[17:50] happen he he introduced the messiah
[17:53] after he introduced the messiah he said
[17:55] he must increase i must decrease
[17:58] then we've got to have another
[17:59] introduction of the messiah amen and
[18:01] then the prophet says i must decrease he
[18:04] must increase do we recognize what's
[18:06] happened the messiah has come to the
[18:07] gentiles
[18:10] brother man's not just playing with
[18:12] language
[18:13] he knows what he's talking about
[18:16] something's going to introduce the
[18:18] messiah
[18:19] and how will the people that's believing
[18:21] him know it unless they're constantly in
[18:24] the word to know what he is
[18:26] daniel said the wise shall know but the
[18:28] foolish the unwise wouldn't know they
[18:31] shall know their god
[18:32] now how he shall appear in the last days
[18:35] is to bring the people back to the word
[18:37] so that the bride will know her husband
[18:39] know her mate the revealed word so my
[18:42] brother said we don't look for nail
[18:43] scars we look for the word made manifest
[18:46] the revealed word her mate her husband
[18:49] that's why this has to happen
[18:52] it wasn't in the reformers it wasn't in
[18:54] luther wesley and the pentecostals and
[18:56] them scripture says it wasn't
[18:58] but it will come
[18:59] that is his promise for this age we're
[19:01] living in the age that is coming will be
[19:03] in
[19:04] she must be identified in him any woman
[19:07] must be identified with her husband for
[19:08] the two are one and christ's bride has
[19:11] to be identified with him for the two
[19:12] are one and he is the word not the
[19:15] denomination the word
[19:17] we are to be children of the light and
[19:19] the light
[19:20] is the word which has made light for
[19:22] this age
[19:24] you know there's a lot of people who
[19:25] says we're children of the light but the
[19:27] only way to be a child of the light is
[19:30] to walk in the light he says what is the
[19:32] light to be a child of the light
[19:34] or an offspring of the light
[19:38] the light is the word which has made
[19:40] light for this age
[19:41] so you can't be the offspring of a light
[19:43] from a previous age no that's not
[19:46] walking in the light that's not a child
[19:48] of the light a child of the light amen
[19:50] the light is the light the word that's
[19:52] made light for this age amen and then
[19:54] when we receive that we're a child of
[19:56] the light
[19:58] children of the light
[19:59] how do we know light except it comes
[20:01] from the word all right the word made
[20:03] flesh is the light of the age when you
[20:05] see it and the bible said so
[20:08] praise be to god
[20:11] brother says here in the breach
[20:14] this is kind of laying a foundation for
[20:15] where we want to go tonight lord willing
[20:18] so starting on the subject of the breach
[20:19] between the seven church ages and the
[20:21] seven seals and i was just speaking this
[20:23] afternoon to a friend and maybe the lord
[20:25] willing sometime this summer if he
[20:27] doesn't take me home or i get to come
[20:29] back don't go overseas or something i'd
[20:31] like to strike again at the seven last
[20:32] trumpets and it all bridges together and
[20:36] then there's the seven last plagues and
[20:37] it all blends right together as we'll
[20:39] see as we go along
[20:42] then he comes along and says in the
[20:43] seals in the second seal
[20:45] all right notice the 17th chapter of
[20:47] revelation now everything is try to open
[20:49] your heart and let the holy spirit teach
[20:51] you now there came unto me one of the
[20:53] seven angels which had the seven vials
[20:55] now you see there are seven vials you
[20:58] know these sevens as we are going
[20:59] through they are
[21:01] they happen right at the same time
[21:03] following the plagues following the
[21:05] church age just the same because it is
[21:07] all sealed up in that one book
[21:09] everything and everything happens just
[21:11] in rotation one goes right into the
[21:13] other and the other into the other
[21:15] there's two spirits working god and the
[21:17] devil
[21:20] and he says in thinking man's filter is
[21:22] in 1965
[21:24] and i'm anxiously waiting for the hour
[21:26] to where i can
[21:27] uh to we can all
[21:29] congregate in one place and preach on
[21:31] those seven plagues seven vials seven
[21:34] trumps and so forth they all happen
[21:36] right in a cluster
[21:38] and so forth they all happen right in a
[21:40] cluster that's the reason it'll take us
[21:42] about a week ten days or more to get
[21:44] through it in one single meeting if we
[21:46] can
[21:47] so brother branham still at the end of
[21:49] his ministry he's wanting to preach on
[21:51] the vials and the trumpets and all of
[21:53] that and tie them together because he
[21:54] says they all happen in a cluster
[21:57] and so
[21:58] so we've got to be careful that we
[22:02] we take what he says
[22:04] as what he says
[22:05] they all happen in a cluster and just
[22:07] see what the lord will show us
[22:10] all right where am i at
[22:14] okay
[22:18] now we go from the breach
[22:21] to the seven seals we're just walking
[22:23] through the bible
[22:24] you have one two three four five seals
[22:27] then in this bible you have seal number
[22:29] six here then in the beginning of
[22:31] chapter eight you have seal number seven
[22:33] and then you have a gap you have a gap
[22:35] between the sixth and seventh seal in
[22:37] your bible like a gap between the church
[22:39] ages and the seals there's a gap between
[22:41] the the six and seven seal
[22:45] then we move forward
[22:48] and the trumpets and then next you have
[22:50] the the trumpets they finish up over
[22:52] here with trump trumpet number six
[22:53] trumpet number seven and there's a gap
[22:56] in between the trumpets uh a gap between
[22:58] the sixth and seventh trumpet
[23:01] so
[23:03] brother banham says
[23:06] he says the gathering of israel is the
[23:08] trumpets the trumpets is to gather
[23:10] israel notice the very first trumpet
[23:12] sound blood fire hail and everything
[23:14] scattered the ground what was he doing
[23:17] bringing israel out of spiritual egypt
[23:19] see back into the homeland
[23:21] so so he's telling us that the trumpets
[23:24] are for israel they're a gathering in of
[23:27] israel bringing israel back to the
[23:29] homeland so the 144 thousand can be
[23:31] called out
[23:33] he says in recognizing your day and its
[23:34] message now the end of these seventh
[23:36] sabbaths which has been there was not
[23:38] there was to be the day of atonement
[23:40] which was the seven trumpets and the
[23:41] seventh trump which was to call a day of
[23:43] mourning back for the sacrifice or the
[23:45] atonement and we find out then that
[23:47] israel the seven trumpets was pertained
[23:49] only to israel
[23:52] let's get down he says and then and when
[23:54] i went in to pray i told the wife i'm
[23:56] going in sincerely i knelt down before
[23:58] god to pray and he revealed to me that
[24:00] them seven trump had sounded under the
[24:03] sixth seal and i've done preached it
[24:05] supernatural see it's the hand of god
[24:07] the whole thing it pertains to israel
[24:10] and we picked it up under the sixth seal
[24:12] you you you all who have that how the
[24:15] persecution of the jews the time of the
[24:18] gentiles has been in this pentecostal
[24:19] feast the trumpets all of them was
[24:21] sounded under the sixth seal and we
[24:24] picked it up last sunday under the feast
[24:25] of trumpets if you all want to get it
[24:28] what was it to do to rush the jews from
[24:30] all parts of the world back into their
[24:32] homeland it must be there in the opening
[24:35] of the seals under the sixth seal the
[24:38] seventh trumpet sounded in the sixth
[24:40] seal
[24:41] so brother graham's tying a couple
[24:43] things together there of the feast and
[24:45] of the seals but he's saying these
[24:46] trumpets sound under the sixth seal
[24:50] and and so we have that's important for
[24:52] us to know that the trumpet sound under
[24:53] the sixth seal
[24:55] and he says
[24:57] here in
[24:58] in the feast of trumpets in revelations
[25:00] 11 these are the two prophets
[25:03] called their ministry will be the
[25:04] ministry of moses and elias calling to
[25:06] israel out of the jewish traditions
[25:08] just as the seventh angel's message
[25:10] called the bride out of the pentecostal
[25:12] tradition remember moses and elijah call
[25:15] israel out of the old atonement of the
[25:17] lamb and sheep and blood and goats and
[25:19] sacrifice to the real living sacrifice
[25:22] to the word
[25:23] so the two witnesses are going to try to
[25:25] pull them out of judaism of the old
[25:28] order of sacrifices and old orders and
[25:31] tried to bring them in to the real
[25:34] living sacrifice the word
[25:37] the bloody lamb
[25:38] the bleeding word who bled for us and
[25:40] died for us so he's trying to trying to
[25:42] bring him out of the old order into the
[25:45] living word
[25:46] and the seventh angel's message now he's
[25:48] talking about himself now the seventh
[25:50] angel's message under the same trumpet
[25:52] same everything exactly the same seal is
[25:54] to walk call the people the bride out of
[25:57] the pentecostal world tradition to the
[26:00] genuine atonement
[26:02] the genuine atonement what's the
[26:04] atonement do the atonement atones for
[26:06] your sins
[26:08] to the genuine atonement the word christ
[26:11] impersonated in his word here made flesh
[26:14] among us
[26:16] we need that atonement
[26:18] which is the revealed word
[26:20] he says made flesh among us science has
[26:22] proved it by pictures the church knows
[26:24] what the world around we firmly know it
[26:26] for he's never told us one thing and
[26:28] thus saith the lord but what's been the
[26:30] truth did he not say down there on the
[26:32] river as john the baptist was sent with
[26:34] his message
[26:35] i looked up and she's 12 o'clock he
[26:37] looks up at the clock i looked up she's
[26:38] 12 o'clock the midnight hour is here
[26:40] friends upon us
[26:43] to show how perfect the scripture is
[26:45] what's he mean when he says the midnight
[26:47] hour is upon us
[26:48] isn't there a cry that went out in the
[26:50] midnight hour what was the cry that went
[26:53] out in the midnight hour behold the
[26:55] bridegroom cometh come out and meet him
[26:58] join up with him
[27:00] so the midnight out when he says when
[27:02] he's trying to explain now that those
[27:04] two prophets they're going to bring them
[27:06] to the the real living sacrifice the
[27:08] word he's going to show them where the
[27:10] real living sacrifice is
[27:12] the word
[27:14] so the the the seventh church age
[27:15] messenger has to bring him out of the
[27:17] old pentecostal world tradition amen
[27:20] into the true atonement which is the
[27:22] word
[27:23] because the word bled for you and the
[27:25] word died for you and when you received
[27:27] the word made flesh you received the
[27:29] benefit of that word when it was made
[27:31] flesh two thousand years ago and was
[27:32] crucified because the word bled for you
[27:34] the word died for you and now you can
[27:37] get a hold of the bleeding bloody word
[27:39] which is what the word made light in
[27:41] your day
[27:42] [Applause]
[27:44] and he's bringing us into that amen into
[27:47] that
[27:48] atonement so what's he bringing the
[27:50] church into into the feast of atonement
[27:54] the true atonement amen recognizing it's
[27:57] the word it's always been the word the
[27:59] word was god the word was with god the
[28:01] word was made flesh and dwell among us
[28:03] it's always been the word friends
[28:05] christ is the anointed word
[28:07] brother franco can you turn this on for
[28:09] me
[28:10] i'm going to try to use some something
[28:12] new
[28:13] this is a whiteboard app and i'm going
[28:15] to try to use this and just draw what we
[28:17] did with the feast of the lord now
[28:19] remember when you go all the way back to
[28:20] leviticus 23 you can read these feasts
[28:22] of the lord and we preached a a preached
[28:25] a series on that years ago but in the
[28:27] feast of the lord is the story of
[28:29] redemption
[28:30] the story of redemption is laid in the
[28:32] seven feast of the lord
[28:34] and if you understand that you
[28:36] understand the whole gospel story
[28:38] it's written right in the feast and so
[28:40] in the feast of the lord you have
[28:42] one two
[28:44] three
[28:45] four
[28:46] five six seven feast
[28:50] the first one is passover
[28:54] passover was jesus christ was slain on
[28:57] passover on the feast of passover he's
[28:58] physically slain he becomes our passover
[29:01] lamb
[29:04] and then you go to unleavened bread
[29:08] which is no leaven no sin mixed in with
[29:11] it and showing there's going to be a
[29:12] word and that's a seven day feast and
[29:14] for seven days i mean there's going to
[29:16] be some true word passing through each
[29:18] of the seven church ages amen and
[29:20] there's going to be real elect seed who
[29:23] get a hold of that unleavened bread
[29:25] in each of those days
[29:28] three is first fruits
[29:34] and first fruits is the resurrection
[29:36] jesus christ is the first fruits of the
[29:38] resurrection amen and he rose on the
[29:40] first day when jesus christ was here
[29:43] amen he was slain on passover
[29:46] he laid in the grave at the beginning of
[29:49] the feast of unleavened bread
[29:51] and he resurrected at the at the day of
[29:54] the feast of first fruits his life was
[29:56] matching the feast of jehovah so nobody
[29:59] would miss what was happening
[30:01] and they still missed what was happening
[30:04] then he was rejected
[30:06] amen
[30:08] whoops whoops bad news
[30:14] but then comes the feast of pentecost
[30:16] [Music]
[30:18] which is jubilee because pentecost means
[30:20] 50 50 days and in the feast of pentecost
[30:26] comes
[30:28] the seven church ages
[30:33] [Music]
[30:34] right so in the feast of pentecost comes
[30:37] the seven church ages
[30:40] and the jews are laying quiet they're
[30:42] rejected they've rejected the word
[30:44] through all of this time but god has
[30:46] promised that he's going to gather them
[30:48] back when he's done dealing with the
[30:49] gentiles he's going to turn back so then
[30:52] he's going to come to the feast of
[30:53] trumpets
[30:57] and this is what brother branham tells
[30:59] us this feast of trumpets is what these
[31:01] two witnesses are going to do amen
[31:03] trumpets trumpets is the sound of a
[31:05] trumpet is an inn gathering amen it's
[31:07] the inn gathering at the end of the
[31:08] harvest to gather all of israel back
[31:10] together so the feast of trumpets is the
[31:13] gathering together of israel amen and
[31:15] these prophets are going to come and
[31:17] they're going to explain what the end
[31:18] gathering has been all about and that
[31:20] end gathering started amen in world war
[31:22] ii
[31:24] that's what brother bam shows
[31:26] number six is atonement
[31:30] where they recognize jesus christ the
[31:32] slain slain lamb
[31:33] and they recognize the true and living
[31:35] sacrifice
[31:37] and seven
[31:40] is tabernacles
[31:43] booths dwelling places
[31:47] this shows the whole plan of redemption
[31:51] he came to redeem his people
[31:54] passover lamb
[31:56] he is the feast of unleavened bread
[31:57] through seven church ages he is the
[32:00] first fruits of the resurrection he is
[32:02] the jubilee the the pentecostal feast he
[32:05] that became the church the gentile
[32:06] church he comes back in the trumpets and
[32:09] starts gathering everybody back to
[32:10] israel back to the homeland so that
[32:12] those two prophets can show up and they
[32:14] can they can testify to them that what's
[32:17] that what they've missed what they
[32:18] missed back there and what's been
[32:20] happening in the inn gathering to bring
[32:22] them to the feast of atonement where
[32:23] they recognize christ the slain lamb and
[32:25] they mourn for missing it amen and then
[32:29] you have tabernacles because now you
[32:30] find the lamb with the 144 thousand amen
[32:34] on mount of olives dwelling together and
[32:36] he's tabernacled with them
[32:38] you see the whole feast
[32:40] but you realize within the feast of
[32:43] pentecost the gentile church goes
[32:45] through all of these feasts too because
[32:47] we receive a passover lamb he's our
[32:49] feast of unleavened bread we're feasting
[32:51] on through seven church ages amen he
[32:53] he's resurrected us into newness of life
[32:56] we've been caught up with him amen he is
[32:59] our jubilee amen and then he and the
[33:01] trumpets brother branham comes amen
[33:03] we've had a trumpet in all seven church
[33:05] ages
[33:06] brother branham said amen a messenger
[33:09] would come a seal would break a trumpet
[33:11] with sound declaring spiritual war amen
[33:13] and then a plague would fall a vile
[33:15] would pour out a plague would fall
[33:16] through seven church ages so there's
[33:18] been seven trumpets sounding in seven
[33:20] church ages amen and brother madam shows
[33:22] us that every time one came forth
[33:24] trumpet trumpet trumpet amen but in the
[33:26] last one he said there was one blast and
[33:29] seven thunders uttered their voice and
[33:31] there's one last trumpet amen that
[33:33] explains all the trumpets
[33:37] brother branham in the preaching of the
[33:39] seals preaches the thunders and brings
[33:41] us to the feast of trumpets
[33:44] to recognize the true atonement the word
[33:49] to bring us to the feast of atonement
[33:51] because he unveils the whole word now he
[33:54] takes away all the catholic dogma amen
[33:56] all the misunderstanding of the
[33:58] scripture and the seals unveil christ
[34:01] the word through the whole bible he said
[34:03] when the seals open it opened my bible
[34:08] which is the atonement the word bled for
[34:10] you the word died for you and he opened
[34:11] up the word and revealed the word bring
[34:13] us to the feast of atonement amen and
[34:16] what happened under the under the under
[34:18] the messenger the last messenger amen
[34:20] the holy ghost had been bound
[34:24] and denominational rivers for nearly
[34:26] 2000 years but to be loosed in the
[34:28] evening time by the evening time message
[34:30] the holy ghost full holy ghost not
[34:33] partial not dips not not bound by false
[34:36] understanding but when the word came
[34:38] back the life came back and now we've
[34:41] come to feast the tabernacles because
[34:43] he's dwelling in his bride
[34:46] so the gentiles have come through our
[34:48] feasts and brother branham said we're
[34:49] now we are now feasting under the
[34:52] seventh feast of feast of tabernacles
[34:55] the seventh church age
[34:58] so
[34:59] we are over here in the feast of
[35:01] tabernacles
[35:03] i want to go through this again because
[35:04] it's so important
[35:06] because this helps us understand all the
[35:07] things brother branham says that looks
[35:09] contradictory he says we're feasting
[35:11] under the seventh feast in the seventh
[35:12] century the feast of tabernacles
[35:16] but the feast of tabernacles he says is
[35:18] the seventh feast or the seven thousand
[35:20] year period since the fall of man which
[35:22] will be the millennium
[35:25] so then people heard brother bam said
[35:27] that so they said well we're in the
[35:28] millennium
[35:29] christ has come breach we've gone
[35:31] through the breach christ has come we're
[35:33] in the millennium that's not what he
[35:35] said because brother branham said that
[35:36] will be the millennium there'll be a
[35:38] thousand years on this earth under the
[35:40] feast of tabernacles when we all come
[35:42] back in glorified bodies tabernacles
[35:45] living on the earth
[35:47] for a thousand years so we've got the
[35:49] gentile bride is in the feast of
[35:51] tabernacles amen the jews are in the
[35:54] feast of trumpets
[35:57] they're still in gathering
[36:00] but the earth is under the feast of
[36:01] atonement under the sixth seal being
[36:04] purged by judgments until it's finally
[36:06] completely cleaned amen so that the
[36:09] feast of the feast of tabernacles can
[36:11] set in upon the earth
[36:13] so we can be in one place in redemption
[36:17] the jews can be another place in
[36:19] redemption and the earth can be yet in a
[36:20] different place in redemption
[36:23] oh i can't express you how important it
[36:25] says to understand that if we can catch
[36:28] that that we don't have to make them all
[36:30] line up perfect
[36:32] then all of a sudden brother branham
[36:34] just became
[36:36] a prophet who knows what he's talking
[36:38] about
[36:40] amen right
[36:42] we don't have to say well he said this
[36:43] said this but i am i think he misspoke
[36:45] there
[36:47] i don't think he meant i mean how could
[36:48] he be in the feast of tabernacles and
[36:50] feast the trumpets all at the same time
[36:53] hey feast the trumpets feast of
[36:55] atonement and feast of tabernacles are
[36:56] all going on at the same time
[36:59] depending on who you are and where you
[37:01] are in the redemption cycle
[37:03] [Music]
[37:05] and now the prophet knows what he's
[37:07] talking about and he says i have no
[37:08] education he says but i know what i'm
[37:11] talking about
[37:13] he says in the 70s he goes i looked
[37:15] right at it and i know what it is
[37:17] [Music]
[37:19] he didn't say he didn't know it he knew
[37:20] it amen but he couldn't explain it there
[37:22] was still some mystery part to it that
[37:25] couldn't be explained
[37:27] praise be to god
[37:30] this is important
[37:33] if you learn that
[37:35] then i i'll sleep good tonight
[37:39] i'm trying my best i get so worked up
[37:42] and i feel so pressed because i know how
[37:44] much is laying here i feel so pressed to
[37:47] keep rolling and rolling and rolling but
[37:48] i'm trying so hard to be still
[37:51] and go slow
[37:53] because these things are important
[37:56] brother branham thought it was worth
[37:58] talking about the feast of trump is to
[37:59] explain to us our redemption
[38:02] it's important we understand the feast
[38:04] of trump is to understand our redemption
[38:06] if the prophet needed to teach it
[38:09] then we need to pay attention to it
[38:13] we can't just say the trumpets feast
[38:16] no the prophet brought it to the bride
[38:19] it's bride's food
[38:21] we need to say lord let me eat that and
[38:23] digest it and become one with it and
[38:25] give me a revelation on that
[38:28] it's important
[38:29] so i want to go slow today if i can and
[38:31] just teach if i can just teach
[38:36] all right
[38:38] let's go through a little series of
[38:39] quotes here brother bam says now let me
[38:41] say this right here that every trumpet
[38:43] that blowed blowed under the sixth seal
[38:46] we'll get to it in a few minutes
[38:48] where we caught the seal all the
[38:50] trumpets sounded under the sixth seal
[38:53] but every trumpet sounded under the
[38:55] sixth seal under the persecution of the
[38:56] jews notice revelation now eight and
[38:59] beginning with the seventh verse all was
[39:01] calling out of israel natural in egypt
[39:03] now it's the calling out of israel in
[39:05] the spiritual sense he was making them
[39:06] ready to the feast of atonement
[39:09] every trumpet sounded the sixth seal
[39:11] under the persecution of the jews
[39:14] now he's starting to give you an
[39:16] indication of the sixth seal
[39:19] it comes with the persecution of the
[39:20] jews
[39:22] now feast of trump is again remember
[39:24] every trumpet sounded under the sixth
[39:26] seal only then when it sounded
[39:31] remember all trumpets sound on the sixth
[39:33] seal the sixth seal finishes the mystery
[39:35] under the sixth seal just before the
[39:37] seventh is open
[39:39] so the sixth seal finishes the mystery
[39:42] because the seventh seal doesn't say
[39:43] anything
[39:44] the seventh seal is the one breaking the
[39:46] mystery
[39:49] the feast of trumpets now
[39:51] again
[39:52] luke 17 30. what's that the revealing of
[39:54] the son of man and also malachi 4
[39:56] turning the heart to the children back
[39:57] to the fathers
[39:58] in hebrews 4 12
[40:00] a sword sharper
[40:02] the word is sharper than a sword this
[40:04] dividing of the soul and spirit and the
[40:06] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[40:07] the heart
[40:08] what's brother brahm showing you his
[40:09] ministry
[40:12] 17 30 malachi 4 hebrews 4 4 12 all these
[40:15] scriptures that's promised this is to be
[40:18] between the sixth and seventh seal
[40:20] and the sixth and seventh trumpet
[40:24] so the question is
[40:27] did brother branham come between the
[40:29] sixth and seventh trumpet
[40:31] answer is yes
[40:33] so we're not looking to trumpets in the
[40:35] future trumpets are in the past when the
[40:38] two witnesses show up amen they're there
[40:41] to reveal to them what the trumpets have
[40:43] been just like when brother branham
[40:45] comes and reveals to us the seals he's
[40:47] showing us what has been
[40:50] it's going to be a repeat of the same
[40:52] cycle
[40:55] praise god
[40:57] i don't know what else to say
[41:00] the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal
[41:02] sounds at the same time
[41:04] and between the sixth trumpet and the
[41:05] seventh trumpet there is a prophet to
[41:07] appear before the gentiles to call the
[41:09] people back to the original pentecostal
[41:11] doctrine and the two witnesses of
[41:12] revelation 11 appear to the jews to send
[41:15] them to jesus while the church is being
[41:17] taken up
[41:19] let's go over to revelation chapter 8
[41:23] in our bibles
[41:27] if we go to revelation chapter 8 and
[41:29] just look at how our bible is
[41:30] constructed
[41:32] in chapter eight verse one we have the
[41:34] seventh seal and when he opened the
[41:36] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[41:37] about the space of half an hour
[41:40] so nothing was said then we go down to
[41:43] verse seven and it starts the trumpets
[41:46] and the first angel sounded and there
[41:48] followed hail fire mingled with blood
[41:50] and this is the trumpets and the
[41:51] trumpets come from seven through nine
[41:53] nine is the fifth trumpet uh six
[41:56] verse 13 to 21 is the sixth trumpet but
[42:00] then there's no seventh trumpet we have
[42:02] a gap and in the gap we have revelation
[42:06] 10.
[42:07] what happens in revelation 10. we have
[42:10] the mighty angel coming down with an
[42:12] open book not a closed book an open book
[42:15] in his hand seven thunders utter their
[42:17] voices john heard it he was gonna write
[42:20] it so it's time for john to hear the
[42:23] thunders
[42:24] but he was told to seal it up amen and
[42:27] like daniel was told to seal it up till
[42:29] the time of the end he was told to seal
[42:30] it up amen so he sealed it up and it
[42:32] says in the days of the voice of the
[42:34] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[42:36] sound the mystery of god shall be
[42:38] finished
[42:40] right so what happens we have the mighty
[42:42] angel come down with an open book in his
[42:44] hand and and the mystery is finished
[42:46] under the voice of the seventh angel so
[42:48] where does brother branham come between
[42:50] the sixth and seventh trumpet
[42:54] we see it right there in the bible
[42:55] between the sixth and seventh trumpet he
[42:57] comes
[42:59] and then we have verse eight which
[43:01] another voice tells john to go and take
[43:03] the little book and eat it up and
[43:04] prophesy again so we have the ministry
[43:06] of the bride from 8 to 11.
[43:10] and then we start chapter 11.
[43:13] we go down to verse three it says i will
[43:15] give power unto my two witnesses and
[43:17] they shall prophesy two thousand two
[43:18] hundred three score days that's three
[43:20] and a half years
[43:21] so now we we come
[43:24] we come to the the the
[43:28] we come to the ministry of the two
[43:30] prophets
[43:31] where
[43:32] in between the sixth and seventh
[43:34] trumpets
[43:36] do you see it
[43:37] is it there in the bible
[43:40] between the sixth and seventh trumpet we
[43:41] get to verse 15 and the seventh angel
[43:44] sounded there's your seventh trumpet so
[43:46] between the sixth and seventh trumpet we
[43:48] have the ministry of brother branham and
[43:49] we have the ministry of the of moses and
[43:51] elijah
[43:53] but he says it's between the 6th and 7th
[43:56] trumpet and the 6th and 7th seal so
[43:59] let's go back to revelation chapter 6.
[44:06] in revelation chapter 6 starts the seals
[44:09] and verse 1 and i saw when the lamb
[44:11] opened one of the seals and i heard as
[44:13] it were the noise of thunder and one of
[44:14] the four beasts saying come and see that
[44:16] goes all the way to the sixth seal in
[44:18] verse 12 down to 17 the sixth seal but
[44:20] then no seventh seal because we don't
[44:22] get the seventh seal until chapter eight
[44:24] and then it's injected chapter seven and
[44:26] in chapter seven it starts after these
[44:28] things i saw four angels standing in the
[44:30] four corners of earth holding the four
[44:32] winds of the earth that the wind should
[44:33] not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor
[44:36] in any tree and i saw another angel
[44:38] ascend from the east having the seal of
[44:40] the living god and he cried with a loud
[44:42] voice to the four angels to whom it was
[44:44] given to hurt
[44:45] to to hurt the earth and the sea saying
[44:48] hurt not the earth neither the sea nor
[44:50] the trees do we have sealed the servants
[44:52] of our god and their foreheads and i
[44:54] heard the number of them which were
[44:56] sealed and there were sealed 144 000 of
[44:59] all the tribes of the children of israel
[45:02] then it goes down 12 thousand three try
[45:04] brother branham comes to this and he
[45:06] says see it's the hundred and forty four
[45:08] thousand under the two to two prophets
[45:10] ministry in chapter 11 and he says
[45:13] that's where the trumpets come in right
[45:15] there
[45:17] where's the trumpets under the sixth
[45:19] seal because under the sixth seal is
[45:21] revelation chapter seven so after the
[45:24] sixth seal you have revelation chapter
[45:26] seven which is the calling out of the
[45:28] hundred forty four thousand and that's
[45:29] where the trumpets come in right there
[45:33] the bible's even written so we don't
[45:35] miss it
[45:37] it's written so we don't miss it
[45:40] i want to
[45:41] uh
[45:43] i want to do something i want to draw
[45:44] something
[45:46] let's go back to drawing
[45:48] i'm sorry franco
[45:50] i'm sure you're working overtime
[45:52] brother franco's so patient
[45:54] so kind
[45:55] to my face
[45:59] and i trust he's that way all the time
[46:02] but i i can be a challenge
[46:05] he's already done a slide for me but i
[46:07] just have to inject this right now
[46:09] if we go through the seals
[46:11] one two three four
[46:14] five
[46:15] six
[46:16] seven seals
[46:19] we just explained how through the seven
[46:21] trumpets
[46:23] that you can have different groups of
[46:25] people in different categories being
[46:26] redeemed on different timelines through
[46:29] the feast that we all agree
[46:31] we see that we all agree if you don't
[46:33] agree
[46:34] just
[46:35] come see me later
[46:38] but
[46:39] but so we broke we want to break the
[46:42] notion that everything happens at the
[46:44] same time
[46:46] like the feast of trumpets for the jews
[46:49] is not the same time we have the feast
[46:50] of trumpet for the gentiles
[46:52] or
[46:53] tabernacles is not the same time for
[46:55] every group
[46:57] so i want to break another notion in the
[46:59] seals
[47:01] so we have
[47:02] we have
[47:03] these seals
[47:04] let's just write
[47:09] oh man
[47:11] white horse
[47:14] red horse
[47:16] black horse
[47:18] pale horse
[47:19] right
[47:20] souls under the altar
[47:23] um
[47:25] judgment
[47:29] and then the mystery seal
[47:31] the coming of the lord
[47:34] so
[47:36] our old intellectual
[47:40] hybridized brain
[47:42] taking the word of god always messes it
[47:44] up do we agree with that
[47:46] and the old denominational way of
[47:48] thinking is whenever you number
[47:50] something
[47:51] those things have to come in sequence
[47:54] but just because you number something
[47:56] they do not have to come in sequence
[48:00] right
[48:02] let me let me prove that
[48:05] we've got the first four seals
[48:07] which overlay the church ages
[48:09] right
[48:10] and they happen in sequence one two
[48:12] three four right but when we get to the
[48:15] fifth seal the fifth hill souls under
[48:17] the altar and brother branham says those
[48:19] are the souls under the altar
[48:21] he said they're under a measure of grace
[48:23] they're in the lamb's book of life
[48:25] they're jews and he blinded them so that
[48:28] they wouldn't receive the word so that
[48:30] he could turn to the gentiles and get a
[48:31] gentile bride
[48:33] right and because of that they're under
[48:36] the sacrifice altar amen waiting for the
[48:38] time that they can receive white robes
[48:40] waiting for the 144 000 to be called out
[48:43] and to be killed as they were
[48:46] all right
[48:47] and so
[48:48] brother branham said they're jews
[48:51] the true jews who stayed true to the
[48:53] word that they could see he didn't hold
[48:55] them accountable for the part that he
[48:57] blinded them to
[48:59] and they're they're jews from the time
[49:01] of christ on
[49:04] so the fifth seal
[49:05] starts before the first seal
[49:09] is that right
[49:12] and the fifth seal
[49:14] goes all the way down in here to the end
[49:16] of the tribulation period and into the
[49:18] millennium
[49:19] is that true
[49:20] [Music]
[49:21] so it's not in chronological order
[49:25] always so when the bible says one two
[49:27] three four it doesn't mean you have to
[49:29] take it in chronological order one seal
[49:32] out of that can span all the seals
[49:36] the sixth field is judgment right
[49:41] brother branham says the sixth seal
[49:44] opened at the time
[49:46] that the sixth trumpet sounded
[49:49] right is that right
[49:50] which is the same time as the second woe
[49:54] which is world war ii because it's the
[49:56] time and the sixth trumpet that those
[49:58] demons came out of the river euphrates
[50:00] and went into the armies of hitler
[50:02] mussolini and stalin is that what he
[50:04] said
[50:06] that's part of the sixth seal so that
[50:08] means the sixth seal actually starts
[50:11] between the third and fourth seal
[50:14] is that true
[50:17] so
[50:18] it doesn't mean
[50:20] one
[50:20] one's done and then another then another
[50:22] then and then after four comes five
[50:25] after five comes six after six comes
[50:27] seven that's not the way it works in the
[50:29] seals
[50:32] is that true
[50:34] so if that's true for the seals
[50:37] let's let it be true for the trumpets
[50:40] and let it be true for the viles
[50:44] okay
[50:45] we unders do you understand what i'm
[50:46] saying
[50:47] so there's a couple things that we're
[50:49] learning by the grace of god that's
[50:51] going to break denominational
[50:53] understanding
[50:54] one is not everybody's in the same spot
[50:57] through the seven feast of redemption
[51:00] right
[51:02] and the seals don't have to happen in
[51:04] chronological
[51:06] order they can happen
[51:09] it's not they're ordered they're
[51:10] numbered but they're not numbered for
[51:12] chronological order necessarily
[51:15] and if we let that get broken in our
[51:18] mind a whole flood of things are going
[51:19] to open up
[51:22] let me do this
[51:25] let's go to the seals one two three four
[51:29] five
[51:30] six
[51:31] seven
[51:32] i'm just going to take my time i'm not
[51:34] going to get anywhere that i expected to
[51:35] get today but this is so critical that
[51:38] we understand that
[51:41] let's look at the numbers
[51:46] and let's try to understand the seals by
[51:50] something other than chronological order
[51:54] now just bear with me
[51:57] four
[51:59] is the number of deliverance
[52:03] is that right
[52:04] three went into the fiery furnace the
[52:06] fourth man was the one who delivered
[52:09] right
[52:09] it's the number of deliverance
[52:12] there's four stages to get to the wheat
[52:14] plant
[52:16] right i
[52:18] i am messing everything up
[52:21] stalk
[52:24] tassel
[52:27] shuck
[52:32] and
[52:34] wheat
[52:35] look i even got a racer
[52:38] look at that
[52:44] so now i'm going to say like brother
[52:46] brenham said he goes i've mapped this
[52:48] out on a piece of paper i may not have
[52:50] it all right
[52:52] right so don't i mean i'm just
[52:55] explaining something that i see
[52:58] so through the four church ages
[53:01] brother branham is
[53:03] it we see a destruction of the bride
[53:05] tree through four stages of an insect
[53:07] right
[53:08] and through four stages we see the bride
[53:10] tree come back
[53:12] right and the fourth stage brings it
[53:14] back to fruit which has the seed on the
[53:15] inside
[53:17] and the wheat plant goes down and the
[53:19] seed must fall into a ground and die
[53:20] lest it bite a bite alone so we see the
[53:23] wheat go into the ground and then come
[53:25] out through four stages three stages of
[53:27] growth but the four stages back to seed
[53:29] again and that's exactly what we see in
[53:32] the church ages when we get to the
[53:33] fourth church age we've come back to
[53:35] seed again
[53:37] and so we've got one two three four
[53:39] church ages
[53:41] now let's look at number five
[53:43] what's number five mean in the bible
[53:46] the number five represents
[53:48] grace
[53:51] who's under the altar
[53:55] jews
[53:57] who rejected jesus christ and for 2 000
[54:01] years has rejected their messiah there
[54:04] is no way for them to have eternal life
[54:06] there is no way for them to get the
[54:08] white robe outside of grace
[54:13] it is the only way they have rejected
[54:15] their messiah they have crucified their
[54:17] messiah and they have continued for 2000
[54:19] years to reject their messiah
[54:22] but yet they're under the sacrifice
[54:25] altar because god blinded them because
[54:27] he blinded them he won't hold them
[54:28] accountable and they're held in grace
[54:31] because they're part of the lamb's book
[54:32] of life and they're coming the fifth
[54:35] seal because the number five represents
[54:39] grace
[54:43] number six
[54:45] is the number of
[54:47] man
[54:51] and man in a fallen condition
[54:54] must be judged
[54:57] is that right
[54:59] and judgment does two things
[55:02] depending on whether you're seed or not
[55:05] judgment
[55:07] either purges
[55:10] or destroys
[55:14] that right
[55:17] so the sixth seal is the judgment seal
[55:22] because man in this fallen condition
[55:24] must be judged
[55:26] so under the sixth seal
[55:29] the earth is destroyed
[55:31] everything that's not of god is
[55:32] destroyed but there are three things
[55:35] that are purged
[55:36] under the judgment seal
[55:38] the 144 000 are purged the foolish
[55:41] virgins are purged and the earth is
[55:44] purged
[55:46] when under the sixth seal because the
[55:49] earth fell because man fell because man
[55:51] was given to me so under the man
[55:52] everything has to be judged under the
[55:54] number of man so it becomes the number
[55:56] of judgment that's why when jesus was on
[55:58] the cross it turned black about the
[56:00] sixth hour of the day because on the
[56:02] cross jesus was under the sixth seal
[56:06] he was under judgment
[56:09] so
[56:11] oh my mind is just exploding just bear
[56:13] with me
[56:17] 144 000 must be purged through the sixth
[56:20] seal the foolish virgin must be purged
[56:22] to the sixth seal and the earth must be
[56:24] purged to the sixth seal
[56:26] right
[56:27] but what about you and i
[56:31] because we're fallen too
[56:33] we come in a fallen condition amen we're
[56:35] just much part of the book of life as
[56:37] the 144 000 are we're just as much an
[56:40] attribute of god as the earth is
[56:42] is that true
[56:43] but all that must be persian the sixth
[56:44] seal and the truth of the matter is the
[56:46] bride must be persian the sixth seal
[56:48] also so when were you purged under the
[56:51] sixth seal you were purged under the
[56:53] sixth seal when you were in him nailed
[56:55] to the cross you were under your sixth
[56:57] seal and now there's no double jeopardy
[57:00] with god you don't have to pay twice for
[57:02] the same crime
[57:04] because you were with him on calvary
[57:07] under the sixth seal paying the price
[57:09] for all of your sins
[57:14] everything is judged under the sixth
[57:16] steel and purged under the sixth seal
[57:19] that's why when brother branham was
[57:21] looking at the seals he keeps making
[57:22] these statements he says he says there's
[57:24] just so much he says i think he's in the
[57:27] seventh seal or the sixth seal he says
[57:29] if i just told you everything that
[57:30] happened and make your head spin
[57:33] everything that i saw in that room would
[57:34] make your head spin make your head whirl
[57:36] maybe i don't remember how he said it
[57:40] and so brother bram says i can't hit at
[57:42] all
[57:43] and we just go around and around the
[57:44] clock he says but i'm just hitting the
[57:46] high places
[57:48] why is he saying all this because he
[57:49] says when when i saw the seals he said
[57:52] my bible became a new book to me
[57:54] because he's seeing the whole plan of
[57:56] redemption he's seeing everything open
[57:58] up
[57:59] so we've already been through the this
[58:02] is why the bride does not have to go to
[58:05] the tribulation period for purging she's
[58:08] been purged by the blood of jesus christ
[58:10] because that was the fullness of the
[58:11] word i'm part of the word i was there if
[58:14] i'm part of the word the fullness of the
[58:16] word bled and died it bled and died for
[58:18] me because i was part of that bleeding
[58:20] and dying
[58:24] there's no
[58:25] there's no jeopardy to the bride there's
[58:27] no danger for the bride there's no
[58:29] chance of being lost amen because god
[58:32] has already required the sacrifice and
[58:34] you've already been part of the
[58:36] sacrifice there's no way you can be lost
[58:39] amen god would be unjust he would defy
[58:42] all of his laws he would cease to be god
[58:44] if you were lost if he had that seed
[58:47] inside of you inside of jesus christ
[58:49] that day and now in you and you're lost
[58:51] then he ceases to be god
[58:53] because god has laws and god fulfilled
[58:56] his laws and you were part of the
[58:57] fulfillment of the law and now there's
[58:59] no jeopardy to you
[59:02] whatsoever praise god
[59:07] everything goes through the sixth seal
[59:10] everything
[59:14] it may not all go to the same time table
[59:15] but everything goes to the sixth seal
[59:19] in the seven what's the seven number
[59:21] seven represent
[59:24] completion
[59:26] and jesus christ is the complete
[59:28] revelation of the whole bible
[59:30] jesus christ is the complete revelation
[59:33] of god
[59:34] and jesus christ is all in all
[59:37] amen
[59:39] bringing us to the seventh seal
[59:41] which is him
[59:44] that's why brother branham says this is
[59:45] the end time seal everything finishes up
[59:48] on this seal why because it's the
[59:50] completion seal
[59:52] it ends the vials it ends the trumpets
[59:54] it ends the church ages it ends it ends
[59:57] destruction of the earth it even ends
[1:00:00] the ushering into the millennium
[1:00:01] everything ends time even ends on this
[1:00:04] seal because the seventh seal is
[1:00:07] completion
[1:00:10] praise be to god
[1:00:12] this is why i'm having such a hard time
[1:00:16] explaining myself
[1:00:18] because you see that just run through
[1:00:19] the whole bible
[1:00:21] i mean it just runs through the whole
[1:00:22] bible
[1:00:24] even
[1:00:25] i don't even know how to express it
[1:00:27] right but you even look in the old
[1:00:29] testament
[1:00:32] even in the old testament
[1:00:34] there was a gathering of trumpets
[1:00:37] to gather israel together and there was
[1:00:40] a tribulation that broke out and a
[1:00:42] famine in their land to bring
[1:00:45] jacob and his sons down into egypt
[1:00:49] right the circumstances that's what the
[1:00:51] trumpets were their circumstances in the
[1:00:53] earth the first world war the second
[1:00:54] world war fifth and sixth trumpet they
[1:00:56] were circumstances amen to drive israel
[1:00:59] back to her homeland to open up the way
[1:01:01] and drive her to her homeland so that
[1:01:02] she would be ungathered amen and now
[1:01:05] joseph is a perfect type of jesus christ
[1:01:07] joseph has been rejected by his brothers
[1:01:09] amen he's been thrown into the dungeon
[1:01:11] exalted on the right hand of pharaoh
[1:01:13] it's the story of jesus christ he's been
[1:01:15] given a gentile bride amen but now it is
[1:01:18] time to reveal himself to his brothers
[1:01:21] so he so now there are plagues that
[1:01:23] begin to fall there are judgments that
[1:01:25] begin the fall and there's a great
[1:01:27] famine in the land
[1:01:30] right there's a huge famine but joseph
[1:01:32] has been down here with the gentiles
[1:01:34] preparing for seven church ages
[1:01:36] preparing the gentiles for the famine
[1:01:39] and all the word is with josephs
[1:01:42] and he's the lord of all the grain all
[1:01:44] the wheat he's got the seed
[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:48] because he's been gathering through
[1:01:49] seven church ages amen now he's got the
[1:01:51] garner full at the end of the church
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:01:55] and now he could let circumstances
[1:01:57] trumpets break out amen to drive them
[1:02:00] down to him amen but he cannot reveal
[1:02:03] himself and he puts him through
[1:02:04] tribulation now you're you've stolen
[1:02:07] from me now you're going to jail now i'm
[1:02:09] i'm grabbing this one and throwing him
[1:02:10] in prison you go back and tell your
[1:02:12] father come back a second time and
[1:02:16] what's he doing he's gathering little
[1:02:18] benjamin the 144 thousand he can't
[1:02:21] reveal himself to benjamin's presence
[1:02:25] and when benjamin comes present now he
[1:02:28] reveals himself to his brethren and his
[1:02:31] brethren say now will die because we're
[1:02:34] guilty
[1:02:35] we're guilty so now he's going to break
[1:02:38] to them the fifth seal and say no you
[1:02:41] meant it for evil but god meant it for
[1:02:43] good
[1:02:44] god god
[1:02:46] made you
[1:02:48] [Music]
[1:02:50] god allowed you i should say that god
[1:02:52] allowed you to reject me god allowed you
[1:02:55] to sell me out god worked this all out
[1:02:58] for your salvation to save much life to
[1:03:00] much people
[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:03] what is that it's the seals
[1:03:06] that's why when they open the seals my
[1:03:09] bible became a new book he opened up he
[1:03:11] took the seals off the whole bible
[1:03:13] that's what was happening
[1:03:17] now years later
[1:03:20] another christ comes
[1:03:22] moses the redeemer
[1:03:23] and they reject him too
[1:03:27] and when you reject the redeemer where
[1:03:29] do you go
[1:03:30] into the sixth seal
[1:03:33] and now in their bondage why are they in
[1:03:35] bondage anyways
[1:03:37] because they sold their brother joseph
[1:03:39] into slavery so now they have to go into
[1:03:41] slavery
[1:03:42] god's a just god
[1:03:44] all these things happened by his order
[1:03:47] they sold him to slavery now they become
[1:03:49] slaves
[1:03:52] now
[1:03:54] now
[1:03:55] moses
[1:03:56] has to go
[1:03:59] away from this people
[1:04:02] and he gets a gentile bride
[1:04:05] does the story look familiar at all at
[1:04:07] this point is it from rejected he goes
[1:04:10] into the wilderness he gets a gentile
[1:04:11] bride amen when the time is right amen
[1:04:14] the time of judgment 40 years he comes
[1:04:16] back and when he comes back
[1:04:19] moses breaks open the sixth seal because
[1:04:22] he starts to call for the same plagues
[1:04:24] that'll be in the tribulation period
[1:04:26] falling by the pro the two prophets
[1:04:27] ministry
[1:04:29] so what's he doing he's bringing them to
[1:04:31] the sixth seal and he's breaking open
[1:04:34] the sixth seal upon egypt
[1:04:37] and what happens after that
[1:04:40] he leads them back
[1:04:43] to the promised land they leads them out
[1:04:45] of egypt he leads them out
[1:04:48] and he brings them to mount sinai
[1:04:50] so that they can be married to god
[1:04:54] then they reject it then the cycle
[1:04:56] repeats then he comes in contact with
[1:04:58] him and then they reject it then he
[1:04:59] sends a prophet to him a prophet is
[1:05:01] always a type of christ brings a prophet
[1:05:03] to him restores the word to him they
[1:05:05] line up to it then through several
[1:05:06] generations of falling away amen they go
[1:05:09] back to rejecting him then a plague
[1:05:10] breaks out the sixth seal breaks open
[1:05:12] again and then chaos breaks out and then
[1:05:14] christ comes again in the form of
[1:05:15] another prophet the same story again and
[1:05:18] again and again and again
[1:05:22] the seals are so much more than white
[1:05:25] horse red horse black horse pants
[1:05:28] it's the story of redemption
[1:05:32] okay
[1:05:33] what do we say next
[1:05:36] i love the word of god
[1:05:38] it's all i can say this stuff means more
[1:05:40] to me than life
[1:05:42] this is the most thrilling thing to me
[1:05:44] and i say i may get the details wrong
[1:05:46] but the story is true
[1:05:48] the revelation is true
[1:05:50] [Music]
[1:05:52] let's go a little further into chapter
[1:05:55] 16 in our bibles
[1:05:57] and in chapter 16 we have the vials
[1:06:01] one two three four five six seven vials
[1:06:03] but there's a gap between the six and
[1:06:05] seven file my we shouldn't have we
[1:06:08] shouldn't have been surprised by now
[1:06:09] that there's a gap between the six and
[1:06:10] seven and here's the gap between the
[1:06:12] sixth and seventh file
[1:06:15] now this is where i want to wrap up for
[1:06:17] tonight if i can just on this point if i
[1:06:19] can
[1:06:20] if i can if i can if i can
[1:06:28] okay
[1:06:30] i don't know how to do this
[1:06:32] all right
[1:06:33] let's just read a couple things and see
[1:06:34] what happens
[1:06:36] i was coming back rather to hear to try
[1:06:38] to have about a 10-day meeting to speak
[1:06:40] on the subject of the seven last vials
[1:06:43] for in between those vials is the
[1:06:45] trumpets and i was telling you when i
[1:06:47] was going to preach on the seven
[1:06:48] trumpets that i would bring them in with
[1:06:50] the vials and the plagues and i thought
[1:06:52] it'd be a good time
[1:06:55] it goes on to say
[1:06:59] no i don't want to go there yet
[1:07:00] i don't want to go there yet i want to
[1:07:02] go over here
[1:07:06] brother bram says
[1:07:11] he's going to say
[1:07:12] something astounding here
[1:07:16] let's look at chapter 16
[1:07:18] revelation chapter 16
[1:07:24] and verse 12.
[1:07:26] we're going to look at the sixth vial
[1:07:30] and the sixth
[1:07:31] angel poured out its vial upon the great
[1:07:33] river euphrates
[1:07:35] and the water of thereof was dried up
[1:07:37] that the way of the kings of the east
[1:07:39] might be prepared
[1:07:41] now we're going to get into the gap
[1:07:42] and i saw three unclean spirits like
[1:07:44] frogs come out of the mouth of the
[1:07:46] dragon and out of the mouth of the beast
[1:07:48] and out of the mouth of the false
[1:07:49] prophet
[1:07:50] for they are the spirits of devils
[1:07:51] working miracles which go forth unto the
[1:07:54] kings of the earth and of the whole
[1:07:55] world to gather them to the battle of
[1:07:57] the great day of god almighty
[1:07:59] behold i come as a thief blessed is he
[1:08:01] that watcheth and keepeth his garment
[1:08:03] lest he walketh naked and they see a
[1:08:05] shame
[1:08:06] and he gathered them together into a
[1:08:08] place called on the hebrew tongue
[1:08:10] armageddon
[1:08:12] that's the gap
[1:08:13] verse 17 and the seventh angel poured
[1:08:16] out his violent to the air and there
[1:08:18] came a great voice through the temple of
[1:08:19] heaven of the heaven from the throne
[1:08:21] saying it is done and there were voices
[1:08:23] and thunders and lightnings and there
[1:08:25] was a great earthquake such as was not
[1:08:27] since men were upon the earth so mighty
[1:08:29] and earthquake and so great
[1:08:32] so
[1:08:34] brother brahms says in the message
[1:08:35] anointed ones at the end time
[1:08:41] well first i want to read this for out
[1:08:43] of trying to do god of service without
[1:08:44] it being his will from july of 1965.
[1:08:48] he says i was coming back rather here to
[1:08:50] try to about a 10-day meeting to speak
[1:08:52] on the subject of the seven last vials
[1:08:55] for in between those vials is the
[1:08:57] trumpets
[1:08:59] so the trumpets are in the gap in the
[1:09:01] vials
[1:09:03] so in the gap is everything
[1:09:06] in the gap of the seals is the trumpets
[1:09:09] in the gap of the vials is the trumpets
[1:09:11] in
[1:09:14] brother van say they all go together in
[1:09:16] one cluster
[1:09:18] he says in anointed ones at the end time
[1:09:21] so notice here something real quick
[1:09:23] while we're ending our talk notice
[1:09:26] revelation 16 13 to 14 if you want to
[1:09:28] put that down i won't have time maybe to
[1:09:31] go to it i want you to be sure and see
[1:09:33] it now notice this is the sounding
[1:09:36] between the sixth and seventh vial so
[1:09:38] brother graham's going to show you the
[1:09:39] sounding we just read it between the
[1:09:41] sixth and seventh bio he said well close
[1:09:43] we'll close out just in a minute if you
[1:09:45] can just bare mint few minutes longer
[1:09:46] closing out now notice revelation 16 13
[1:09:49] to 14 between the sixth and seventh vial
[1:09:52] three unclean spirits like frogs did you
[1:09:54] notice that went out of the mouth of
[1:09:55] someone now notice quickly are you
[1:09:57] reading a trinity of spirits now
[1:10:00] denominational brother sit still just a
[1:10:02] minute don't get up and walk out of the
[1:10:03] room back there on the radio telephone
[1:10:05] hook up don't turn off your tape
[1:10:06] recorder off set still just a minute
[1:10:08] listen if you're born of god you will
[1:10:11] a trinity of frogs a frog is an animal
[1:10:13] that always looks backward he never
[1:10:15] looks where he's going
[1:10:16] he looks where he's coming from see
[1:10:17] don't you see there was trinitarianism
[1:10:20] born at remember three unclean spirits
[1:10:22] individual spirits are you getting it
[1:10:25] notice they look back to the nicey
[1:10:26] council where the trinity doctrine was
[1:10:28] born at not in the bible there's no such
[1:10:31] a thing they look back to the 19 council
[1:10:33] through the 19th council at nicea rome
[1:10:35] where the trinity was born to him notice
[1:10:38] where they come from notice and the
[1:10:39] trinity of frogs came out of an old
[1:10:41] trinity give birth to a new trinity
[1:10:43] their mother what it come out of a
[1:10:46] trinity the dragon the beast and the
[1:10:48] false prophet a trinity knew
[1:10:50] for when were these frogs come out this
[1:10:53] is the question
[1:10:54] listen
[1:10:56] when what's the timing when did the
[1:10:58] frogs come out when did it notice they
[1:11:00] was there all the time
[1:11:03] but it wasn't manifested until between
[1:11:05] the sixth and seventh vial just before
[1:11:08] the seals opened to reveal it
[1:11:13] so where are we in the gap between the
[1:11:15] sixth seventh vial amen in the gap
[1:11:17] between the sixth and seventh vial we
[1:11:19] see three unclean spirits like frogs
[1:11:21] come out of the mouth of three
[1:11:23] individuals three individual spirits he
[1:11:25] said they were there all along
[1:11:27] they go all the way back in the
[1:11:30] babylonian religion all the way back to
[1:11:32] the tower of babel they've been there
[1:11:33] all along but when were they revealed
[1:11:36] when did they come out they were
[1:11:37] revealed between the sixth and seventh
[1:11:40] vial
[1:11:41] just before the seals opened to reveal
[1:11:44] it
[1:11:45] so that means brother branham's ministry
[1:11:48] is in the gap between the sixth and
[1:11:50] seventh vial
[1:11:54] between the sixth and seventh trumpet
[1:11:56] between the sixth and seventh seal
[1:12:00] so many things we're looking for a way
[1:12:02] off in the future and there may be other
[1:12:04] manifestations but we've already been
[1:12:06] through this gap friends
[1:12:09] if you look at the gap at the spirits
[1:12:11] now look at verse 13 behold i come as a
[1:12:14] thief
[1:12:15] it's the coming of the lord in the gap
[1:12:17] between the sixth and seventh vial i
[1:12:19] come as a thief amen come like a thief
[1:12:22] amen he's like a thief he's not a thief
[1:12:24] because he come to get what was his
[1:12:27] and when you're taking what's yours
[1:12:28] you're not a thief but he snuck in amen
[1:12:31] he come in unawares
[1:12:34] [Applause]
[1:12:36] and then he says make sure you keep your
[1:12:38] garment so you won't be found naked that
[1:12:40] goes right back to revelation chapter 3
[1:12:42] to the seventh church age
[1:12:44] right
[1:12:48] and then he says and he gathered them
[1:12:50] together into a place called hebrew
[1:12:52] tongue armageddon so the gap between the
[1:12:54] sixth and seventh seal includes brother
[1:12:56] branham's ministry all the way to the
[1:12:58] gathering to the battle of armageddon is
[1:13:00] in the gap
[1:13:02] so brother branham's ministry is there
[1:13:04] in the gap
[1:13:06] let's keep reading here and anointing
[1:13:07] ones at the end time for in the message
[1:13:09] of the seventh angel the mysteries of
[1:13:11] god would be known all these trinitarian
[1:13:13] things and false baptisms and everything
[1:13:16] was to be made manifest god help us to
[1:13:18] see that's truth and not think it's
[1:13:19] somebody trying to say something
[1:13:21] i feel that spirit resenting that i'm
[1:13:23] not speaking of myself brother i'm
[1:13:25] speaking of the angel of the lord that's
[1:13:26] in the camp that's exactly right notice
[1:13:29] trinity the dragon how many knows what
[1:13:31] the dragon was it was rome and the
[1:13:32] dragon stood before the woman to devour
[1:13:34] her child as soon as it was born that
[1:13:37] right what does beast mean in the bible
[1:13:39] power all right false prophet a false
[1:13:42] prophet a false anointed one see
[1:13:44] started where this is a false prophet
[1:13:46] singular false prophet the first pope
[1:13:48] and from there come out the and
[1:13:50] the mother of harlots and the whole
[1:13:51] thing
[1:13:52] a false trinity was rising not in the
[1:13:54] early days wouldn't be made manifest in
[1:13:56] the early days and went right on through
[1:13:58] with it but when the seven seals become
[1:14:02] when the seven seals become and opened
[1:14:05] those mysteries and revealed them that's
[1:14:08] when the three frogs three unclean
[1:14:09] spirits like frogs come out to manifest
[1:14:12] themselves a trinity doctrine against
[1:14:14] the truth
[1:14:17] praise the lord brother branham brought
[1:14:19] us right through the book of revelation
[1:14:24] oh friends there's something i want to
[1:14:26] get to
[1:14:27] i'm just trying with all my heart
[1:14:30] brother bam said
[1:14:33] he said when the sixth seal when it
[1:14:35] opened the persecution struck the jews
[1:14:37] in the literal standpoint
[1:14:39] he says when the six he'll come open it
[1:14:41] struck the jews in the literal
[1:14:43] standpoint and he says the sixth seal
[1:14:45] and the sixth trumpet sound at the same
[1:14:48] time so let's go back to revelation
[1:14:52] chapter
[1:14:53] nine
[1:14:58] now if we look
[1:15:00] at chapter 8
[1:15:01] verse 13
[1:15:03] we find an angel flying through the
[1:15:04] midst of heaven saying with a loud voice
[1:15:06] woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the
[1:15:08] earth by reason of the other voices of
[1:15:10] the trumpet of the three angels which
[1:15:11] are yet to sound and brother branham
[1:15:13] says that's three world wars world war
[1:15:14] one world war two world war three then
[1:15:16] you go to the fifth seal verse 12 is the
[1:15:19] end of the fifth seal it says the one
[1:15:21] woe is passed one ward war is past and
[1:15:24] behold there come two woes more
[1:15:25] hereafter
[1:15:27] and then we go into the sixth trumpet
[1:15:29] which is going to happen at the time of
[1:15:31] world war ii
[1:15:32] so now we know where we're at in the
[1:15:35] sixth trumpet
[1:15:36] and the sixth seal opens with the
[1:15:38] persecution to the jews in the literal
[1:15:41] standpoint and the sixth trumpet and the
[1:15:43] sixth seal happen at the same time open
[1:15:46] at the same time do we believe that
[1:15:50] this is good
[1:15:52] verse 13 and the sixth angel sounded and
[1:15:54] i heard a voice from the four
[1:15:56] horns of the golden altar which is
[1:15:57] before god saying to the sixth angel
[1:16:00] which had the trumpet loose the four
[1:16:02] angels which are bound in the great
[1:16:03] river euphrates and the four angels were
[1:16:05] loosed which were prepared for an hour
[1:16:08] and a day and a month and a year for to
[1:16:10] slay the third part of men
[1:16:12] and the number of the army of the
[1:16:14] horsemen were two hundred thousand
[1:16:15] thousand and i heard the number of them
[1:16:18] and thus i saw the horses in the vision
[1:16:20] and them that sat on them having
[1:16:22] breastplates of fire and adjacent and of
[1:16:24] brimstone and the heads of the horses
[1:16:26] were as the heads of lions and out of
[1:16:28] their mouth issued fire smoke and
[1:16:30] brimstone
[1:16:32] by these three was the third part of men
[1:16:35] killed by the fire
[1:16:38] now
[1:16:39] brother branham says
[1:16:40] those were not natural chargers or
[1:16:43] horses he goes those were supernatural
[1:16:45] demons
[1:16:47] and they were released out of euphrates
[1:16:49] and went into the armies of hitler
[1:16:50] stalin mussolini to bring a bitter
[1:16:52] persecution against to the jews so the
[1:16:55] sixth seal opens with the persecution of
[1:16:57] the jews the sixth seal and the sixth
[1:16:59] trumpet open at the same time
[1:17:03] and world war ii
[1:17:06] and then we go to revelations 10 because
[1:17:08] brother branham's called into his
[1:17:10] ministry to go out and take a gift of
[1:17:12] healing to the peoples of the world
[1:17:14] right at the closing of world war ii
[1:17:17] his life is matching the scriptures
[1:17:21] and then he finishes his ministry then
[1:17:24] the bride takes an easter little book
[1:17:25] and prophesies again
[1:17:27] then it goes to the two witnesses which
[1:17:29] will prophesy in the three and a half
[1:17:30] year tribulation period then they'll be
[1:17:33] killed then they'll raise again and then
[1:17:36] you'll come to verse 14.
[1:17:39] the second woe is past and behold the
[1:17:42] third world cometh quickly
[1:17:44] and then the seventh angel sounded
[1:17:46] so all of this happens between the
[1:17:48] second and third world wars
[1:17:52] where are we at
[1:17:53] we're long past the second world war
[1:17:56] the horrors is shaking and trembling
[1:17:58] they know war could break out anymore
[1:17:59] where are we friends all of this has to
[1:18:02] happen between the second and third
[1:18:04] world war
[1:18:07] brother breton's life matches the bible
[1:18:09] and now our lives in time and the news
[1:18:12] and everything that's going on is
[1:18:14] matching the bible for us too
[1:18:17] it's all happening the same way
[1:18:19] so those those demons were released out
[1:18:22] of the river euphrates they went into
[1:18:24] the armies they brought a bitter
[1:18:25] persecution he said they shot them that
[1:18:27] they had no more bullets they gassed
[1:18:28] them till they ran out of gas he said
[1:18:30] they put bubbles in their veins they did
[1:18:31] every horrible thing to them and he says
[1:18:33] what was it the spirit of rome he said
[1:18:35] no it was germany and it was no he says
[1:18:37] they did the same thing to the jews that
[1:18:39] they did to the early christians showing
[1:18:41] it was the same roman spirit amen
[1:18:44] come back and brought a persecution
[1:18:47] and that was to drive them back to the
[1:18:49] promised land
[1:18:52] let's go to the gap between the 6th and
[1:18:54] 7th seal in revelation chapter 7.
[1:18:57] we saw the four angels released that
[1:19:00] were bound in the euphrates right they
[1:19:02] were released
[1:19:04] they released the army the army went in
[1:19:06] and persecuted the jews driving them
[1:19:09] back to their homeland but then in
[1:19:11] chapter seven verse one it says and
[1:19:13] after these things i saw four angels
[1:19:14] standing on the four corners of the
[1:19:16] earth holding the four winds of the
[1:19:17] earth that the wind should not blow on
[1:19:19] the earth nor the sea nor any tree and i
[1:19:21] saw another angel ascend from the east
[1:19:23] having the seal of the living god and he
[1:19:26] cried with a loud voice to the four
[1:19:27] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[1:19:29] earth and the sea
[1:19:30] saying hurt not the earth neither the
[1:19:32] sea nor the trees till we have sealed
[1:19:34] the servants of our god in their
[1:19:36] foreheads
[1:19:38] and then you go to the ceiling of 144
[1:19:40] thousand what was it
[1:19:42] those four angels were holding the winds
[1:19:45] and brother branham says winds are wars
[1:19:47] and strife these are four angels holding
[1:19:49] the winds and and they the world war ii
[1:19:52] took place the armies went out but after
[1:19:54] it accomplished their purpose amen to
[1:19:56] get the jews to go back to their
[1:19:58] homeland he says now you stop don't hurt
[1:20:00] it no more until we finish sealing the
[1:20:03] hundred and forty four thousand
[1:20:06] so that's why war two stopped and that's
[1:20:08] why it was on hold
[1:20:10] but guess what those demons didn't go
[1:20:12] back into euphrates when they were
[1:20:14] released they were released
[1:20:18] and they're still waging war just
[1:20:20] somewhere different
[1:20:22] so
[1:20:23] the sixth seal
[1:20:25] the sixth trumpet
[1:20:28] sounds at the same time
[1:20:30] and let's go to the sixth vial let's go
[1:20:32] back to chapter 16.
[1:20:41] and the sixth angel poured out his vial
[1:20:43] upon the great river euphrates
[1:20:46] it's euphrates again
[1:20:48] isn't that amazing
[1:20:50] the sixth trumpet was euphrates the
[1:20:51] demons came out the four angels were
[1:20:53] released the demons came now now the now
[1:20:56] the sixth angel pours out
[1:20:58] on euphrates and the waters thereof was
[1:21:00] dried up that the way of the kings of
[1:21:02] the east might be prepared
[1:21:04] and brother branham has something to say
[1:21:06] about this
[1:21:09] he says in the feast of trumpets
[1:21:12] he said now revelation the ninth chapter
[1:21:14] the 13th verse notice real close under
[1:21:16] the sixth trumpet
[1:21:17] under the sixth trumpet note there was
[1:21:19] two hundred thousand horsemen that had
[1:21:22] been bound in the river euphrates was
[1:21:24] turned loose under the sixth trumpet
[1:21:26] now there's not two hundred thousand
[1:21:27] horsemen in the world but there was two
[1:21:29] hundred thousand horsemen noticed i want
[1:21:31] you to jot it down so you can read it
[1:21:33] they wasn't natural horses they breathed
[1:21:35] fire they had breastplates of jasper
[1:21:37] they had tails and the end of the tail
[1:21:39] looked like a serpent a snake said on
[1:21:40] the end of it stinging it was spiritual
[1:21:43] horses spiritual devils chargers that
[1:21:46] had been bound in euphrates all these
[1:21:47] years supernatural devils what was it
[1:21:50] the old roman empire being revived the
[1:21:53] persecution of the jews they had been
[1:21:55] bound for nearly two thousand years at
[1:21:57] the river euphrates can't cross to the
[1:22:00] promise
[1:22:03] can't cross
[1:22:05] can't cross euphrates
[1:22:07] what has to happen to your phrase to
[1:22:09] cross it
[1:22:10] dried up
[1:22:12] dried up
[1:22:13] can't cross to the promise a religious
[1:22:16] sect that was trying to get to the other
[1:22:19] side
[1:22:21] euphrates you know come through eden but
[1:22:24] they were bound there two hundred
[1:22:25] thousand devils of persecution and
[1:22:27] notice what happens under the sixth
[1:22:29] trumpet they were turned loose on the
[1:22:30] jews the persecution of the new
[1:22:32] supernatural devils nearly two thousand
[1:22:34] years then loosed by stalin hitler upon
[1:22:37] the jews
[1:22:39] further and he says there is that roman
[1:22:42] empire bound there by what the
[1:22:44] ecclesiastical powers
[1:22:46] which rome pagan rome became papal rome
[1:22:49] and was bound there in its traditions of
[1:22:52] christian
[1:22:54] what was binding it what was keeping it
[1:22:57] from crossing over one sect wanted to
[1:22:59] cross over to the other one when the
[1:23:01] demons were released out of euphrates
[1:23:03] they went and brought a physical
[1:23:04] persecution against the physical people
[1:23:07] but they also want to cross over to the
[1:23:09] other side and now euphrates has to dry
[1:23:12] up so that they can cross over to the
[1:23:13] other side but they're bound by
[1:23:15] religious tradition trying to make
[1:23:18] believe they're christian when it's
[1:23:20] nothing but pagan rome
[1:23:22] trinity doctrine worship of devils
[1:23:25] worship of dead saints it's nothing but
[1:23:27] devil worship and trying to pretend it's
[1:23:30] christian
[1:23:32] but it can't cross until euphrates dries
[1:23:35] up and euphrates doesn't dry up until
[1:23:37] the sixth vial and brother branham tells
[1:23:40] us when those demons were released out
[1:23:42] of the river euphrates they went into
[1:23:45] stalin hitler the armies of staller
[1:23:46] hitler mussolini brought a bitter
[1:23:48] persecution against the jews but then
[1:23:51] when that war stopped and he said to
[1:23:53] hold the winds stop the wars we're going
[1:23:55] to seal them now those demons crossed
[1:23:59] over euphrates and went into the
[1:24:01] ecumenical movement that started in 1962
[1:24:05] with the vatican ii council and the
[1:24:07] vatican ii council was the vatican's
[1:24:09] ecumenical move from 62 to december 8th
[1:24:12] of 1965
[1:24:14] and what was it it was the catholic
[1:24:16] church it was the demon powers the old
[1:24:18] roman empire crossing over and mixing
[1:24:21] with the protestants
[1:24:24] so brother brown tells us
[1:24:27] he says
[1:24:28] what was holding he said the
[1:24:29] ecclesiastical realm was still holding
[1:24:32] why because the protestants wouldn't mix
[1:24:34] with the catholics
[1:24:36] as long as there was still some word in
[1:24:39] that river
[1:24:41] as long as the protestants still had a
[1:24:44] word barrier trusting in the word
[1:24:46] believing the word separating them from
[1:24:48] the old pagan traditions amen but when
[1:24:50] they when they didn't care about the
[1:24:52] word anymore and all they cared about
[1:24:54] was their church anymore and the waters
[1:24:56] began to dry up and when they no longer
[1:24:59] cared about the word nobody cared if
[1:25:01] they mixed with the catholic church in
[1:25:03] an ecumenical move anymore
[1:25:13] after that
[1:25:15] comes the seals
[1:25:16] because brother ben says
[1:25:18] seals come
[1:25:19] at the revelation of the three unclean
[1:25:21] spirits in the gap between the sixth and
[1:25:23] seventh trumpet
[1:25:24] showing you brother branham had to be
[1:25:26] here at this time
[1:25:28] when this happened
[1:25:29] and he pointed to the ecumenical mood in
[1:25:31] the world council churches and said
[1:25:32] there it is
[1:25:34] where did those demons go they went into
[1:25:37] the world council of churches to bring a
[1:25:38] persecution against the denomination no
[1:25:41] against the bride
[1:25:43] but they'll never be successful because
[1:25:45] before they do it he'll whisk her away
[1:25:49] what's fighting you two hundred thousand
[1:25:52] two hundred million demons
[1:25:55] the same ones that shot bubbles in the
[1:25:57] veins of the jews and burnt them and
[1:25:59] gave them cyanide and all these other
[1:26:00] stuff what is that that's what's trying
[1:26:02] to fight you to get you to disbelieve
[1:26:04] the word and back down and compromise on
[1:26:06] it
[1:26:06] and not move forward in the light and
[1:26:08] settle down and have a denomination out
[1:26:10] of the message that's those demons are
[1:26:11] trying to do
[1:26:13] but they've been exposed by the prophet
[1:26:15] amen by his ministry that came in the
[1:26:17] gap between the sixth and seventh vial
[1:26:19] friends
[1:26:21] amen
[1:26:25] there i've got tons of quotes on this go
[1:26:27] read go read the notes we post them on
[1:26:29] the line and i might get back into some
[1:26:30] more of this but we're running out of
[1:26:32] time
[1:26:32] but let's go to the seventh vial
[1:26:35] 17
[1:26:37] and the seventh angel poured out his
[1:26:39] violin to the air and there came a great
[1:26:41] voice out of the temple of heaven from
[1:26:43] from the throne saying it is done
[1:26:46] and there were voices and thunders and
[1:26:47] lightnings there was a great earthquake
[1:26:49] such as was not since men were upon the
[1:26:51] earth so mighty an earthquake and so
[1:26:54] great
[1:27:00] brother banham comes
[1:27:03] to the end of his ministry
[1:27:07] and in april of 1965
[1:27:11] he's in los angeles california
[1:27:15] now this will be the last time he's ever
[1:27:18] in los angeles california
[1:27:22] and he's going to preach a message
[1:27:23] called choosing of the bride
[1:27:26] the last time he's in los angeles los
[1:27:29] angeles brother branham calls it uh he
[1:27:31] calls it like a mystery babylon it's the
[1:27:33] millstone that'll be cast into the sea
[1:27:37] he's all the way out the last part of
[1:27:39] the ministry the last time he'll be in
[1:27:41] los angeles
[1:27:43] and he's standing in los angeles
[1:27:44] preaching choosing of the bride and for
[1:27:46] his opening scripture reading he chooses
[1:27:48] two scriptures
[1:27:50] two scriptures
[1:27:53] the first one is eliezer
[1:27:56] praying that god will help him find a
[1:28:00] wife for isaac
[1:28:02] brother branham is preaching choosing of
[1:28:04] a bride
[1:28:05] brother branham's the eleazar for the
[1:28:06] day
[1:28:08] in his opening scripture and choosing la
[1:28:11] he said civilization has traveled from
[1:28:12] the east to the west now it's on the
[1:28:14] west coast and it can't go any farther
[1:28:16] it's bumping against the barrier and
[1:28:17] splashing back
[1:28:18] now civil and he said the gospel has
[1:28:20] traveled with civilization so now he's
[1:28:22] in los angeles california and he's at
[1:28:24] the end of at the end of the church ages
[1:28:26] the end of the gospel the end of
[1:28:27] civilization
[1:28:31] you see what i'm saying
[1:28:33] and he chooses two scripture readings
[1:28:35] the first one is eliezer praying
[1:28:37] to help him find a bride for isaac
[1:28:42] and the second scripture reading
[1:28:49] is revelation 21
[1:28:53] and the ninth verse
[1:28:56] and there came unto me one of the seven
[1:28:58] angels
[1:28:59] which had the seven vials
[1:29:02] full of the seven last plagues and
[1:29:03] talked with me saying
[1:29:05] come hither
[1:29:06] and i will show thee the bride
[1:29:09] the lamb's wife
[1:29:12] does the first scripture reading pertain
[1:29:14] to brother bannon's ministry
[1:29:18] does the second scripture reading
[1:29:19] pertain to brother banham's ministry
[1:29:23] who showed us the bride
[1:29:25] the lamb's wife who did it it was one of
[1:29:28] the seven angels having one of the seven
[1:29:30] last plagues and we know that seven
[1:29:32] names that that angel to be the seventh
[1:29:34] angel
[1:29:36] so he's the seventh angel here is he
[1:29:38] probably the fifth angel over here and
[1:29:39] the third angel over here or is he the
[1:29:42] seventh angel
[1:29:46] see we have no problem saying brother
[1:29:48] branham fulfilled eleazar he fulfilled
[1:29:50] that was eliezer when he says when he's
[1:29:51] there at the beginning of choosing of a
[1:29:53] bride he's saying oh uh are you praying
[1:29:55] the prayer eliezer would you would you
[1:29:58] would you send a bride for isaac and
[1:29:59] everybody says that's brother brandon's
[1:30:00] ministry then he says then came to me
[1:30:02] one of the seven uh some the vile angels
[1:30:05] having one of the seven last plagues and
[1:30:07] and said to me i'll show you the bride
[1:30:09] the lamb's wife
[1:30:11] who was that i don't know
[1:30:15] can you say that was brother branham too
[1:30:17] can you say he's one of those vile
[1:30:19] angels can you say he's the one who came
[1:30:21] between the sixth and seventh vial and
[1:30:23] opened up the seals between the sixth
[1:30:24] and seventh vial can you say he's the
[1:30:27] vile angel that showed you the the
[1:30:29] lamb's wife the bride
[1:30:34] nobody in the message will fault you for
[1:30:36] saying he's eliezer but they'll sure
[1:30:37] look at you crooked for saying he's the
[1:30:39] seventh vial angel
[1:30:41] but he's the one who chose the scripture
[1:30:43] reading not me he's the one who read it
[1:30:45] at the beginning of choosing of the
[1:30:47] bride
[1:30:50] and when you read the seventh vial it
[1:30:51] says the seventh angel poured out his
[1:30:52] violent to the air and there was great
[1:30:54] voices out of the temple of heaven from
[1:30:56] the throne saying it is done and there
[1:30:58] were voices and thunders and lightnings
[1:31:00] and there was a great earthquake such as
[1:31:02] was not since men were upon the earth so
[1:31:04] mighty and earth awakened so great and
[1:31:06] brother branham at the beginning of
[1:31:08] choosing of a bride brings two
[1:31:10] scriptures eleazar and the vile angel
[1:31:12] pouring out the seventh vial amen and
[1:31:14] then at the end of choosing of a bride
[1:31:17] brother branham says oh capernaum
[1:31:19] capernaum that was exalted thyself above
[1:31:21] the angels
[1:31:23] if the mighty works have been done in
[1:31:24] you they've been done there
[1:31:26] you know whatever whatever he said he
[1:31:28] says but you'll be in the bottom of the
[1:31:31] sea the millstone cast into the sea
[1:31:34] what's brother branham doing he's
[1:31:36] predicting a giant earthquake that'll
[1:31:38] sink los angeles who is he what's he
[1:31:41] doing he's pouring out a vial friends
[1:31:44] he's a vile angel his ministry came
[1:31:46] between the sixth and seventh vial and
[1:31:48] here he comes at the end of his ministry
[1:31:50] all the way on the west coast saying it
[1:31:53] is done you are finished civilization is
[1:31:56] over the churches is over and there's
[1:31:58] nothing left but destruction
[1:32:02] praise be to god how much more do we
[1:32:04] have to go how much more do we have to
[1:32:07] wait on friends he's fulfilled the book
[1:32:09] of revelation there's more to happen but
[1:32:11] not for you and i
[1:32:13] he's brought us all the way through till
[1:32:15] we get to revelation 22 17 and the
[1:32:18] spirit and the bride say come which is
[1:32:21] exactly what is taking place in
[1:32:23] revelation 10 8-11 eating the little
[1:32:26] book and prophesying again saying come
[1:32:29] on
[1:32:30] come out from among her my people and
[1:32:33] come
[1:32:35] now have you seen the road map
[1:32:37] where are we
[1:32:39] well we got away from them vials i'm not
[1:32:40] waiting for no vials i saw it poured out
[1:32:44] we got to wait for them trumpets and the
[1:32:46] trumpets have sounded
[1:32:48] right what's the revelation i don't know
[1:32:51] i won't be here for that the two
[1:32:53] witnesses will be the ones who give that
[1:32:56] but when they start preaching they're
[1:32:57] going to be preaching history like the
[1:32:59] seals were preaching history
[1:33:02] what are all the plagues that i don't
[1:33:04] know what all the plagues were but i
[1:33:05] know what the six was the sixth was the
[1:33:07] drawing up of the separation between
[1:33:09] paganism and christianity where they're
[1:33:11] now comfortable joining themselves
[1:33:13] together to bring a persecution against
[1:33:15] the bride
[1:33:16] i know what the sixth vial was and i
[1:33:18] know what the seventh was it's a
[1:33:20] judgment that's gonna bring a great
[1:33:21] earthquake
[1:33:24] what's the rest of them i don't know
[1:33:26] they don't even have to happen in
[1:33:27] sequence
[1:33:29] remember our lesson from the seals they
[1:33:31] don't even have to happen in sequence
[1:33:36] this book of revelation is the bride's
[1:33:39] book
[1:33:40] and this book of revelation has been
[1:33:42] opened up friends
[1:33:44] it's been opened up but i for one i
[1:33:47] don't want to speak for anybody else but
[1:33:48] i for one have been afraid to move into
[1:33:51] it
[1:33:52] because it's risky
[1:33:55] to say those things
[1:33:58] it sounds
[1:34:00] to denominational understanding like it
[1:34:02] could be wrong
[1:34:04] but it's what the prophet told us it's
[1:34:07] what he taught and it's what he showed
[1:34:09] us amen and he told the bride she's got
[1:34:11] to read between the lines what lines
[1:34:14] eleazar my first scripture vile angel my
[1:34:17] second scripture and i come and brother
[1:34:19] branham wasn't planning on prophesying
[1:34:22] the sinking of los angeles when he
[1:34:23] started that
[1:34:25] do you understand that he said he didn't
[1:34:27] even know he prophesied he had to go
[1:34:28] back and listen to the tape again in the
[1:34:30] beginning he says somebody asked me amen
[1:34:32] there was another earthquake this
[1:34:33] morning or yesterday or whatever it was
[1:34:35] the one in seattle and he says they're
[1:34:36] asking me could that happen here he says
[1:34:38] i don't know maybe maybe not and he's
[1:34:40] pondering the issue but he doesn't know
[1:34:43] and he's not planning on saying that he
[1:34:45] picks his opening scriptures by
[1:34:46] inspiration and god the holy ghost falls
[1:34:49] upon him till he doesn't know what he's
[1:34:51] saying and at the end of that message
[1:34:53] he's pouring the file out in los angeles
[1:34:58] praise be to god amen it's all finished
[1:35:01] it's all done what's he doing now he's
[1:35:03] not in the churches he's done with the
[1:35:05] churches he's finished with the churches
[1:35:07] now he's bringing the last bride in amen
[1:35:10] so that he can get her out of the way so
[1:35:12] that he can turn to the two witnesses in
[1:35:14] revelations 11 to call the 144 000.
[1:35:18] two things have to happen now he's got
[1:35:20] to get the last bride to the revelation
[1:35:22] and he's got to get the last of the 144
[1:35:24] 000 into the promised land
[1:35:26] are they there i don't know is they here
[1:35:28] i don't know i don't know who's where
[1:35:29] and who's what
[1:35:31] but when he gets both of those things in
[1:35:33] place
[1:35:34] we take our flight
[1:35:37] we're not waiting for new information
[1:35:39] we're not waiting for a new message
[1:35:40] we're not waiting for another happening
[1:35:42] we're waiting for that last member to
[1:35:43] come in and 144 000 to be in position
[1:35:46] and our time is done and we're gone
[1:35:49] until then we're in revelations 10 11.
[1:35:53] prophesy again to kings and nations
[1:35:57] and we're in revelation 22 17 the bride
[1:35:59] and the spirit say come
[1:36:01] that's our commission
[1:36:03] saying what he said prophesy again not a
[1:36:07] new prophecy a repeat of the prophecy
[1:36:09] that's already come
[1:36:14] oh i just wish i understood revelations
[1:36:17] if we would just believe what the
[1:36:19] prophet said we would understand the
[1:36:21] book of revelations if we would just let
[1:36:23] him use the scriptures he wants to use
[1:36:25] to describe what's happening and trust
[1:36:27] him to pick the right scriptures then we
[1:36:30] understand the book of revelations
[1:36:33] but too many times old carnal
[1:36:36] understanding and old denominational
[1:36:38] teaching is tagged along
[1:36:41] and we say well that's for the future
[1:36:44] and that's not for us
[1:36:45] and so we're just going to stay here in
[1:36:47] the first few chapters of the book of
[1:36:49] revelation
[1:36:51] because the trumpets aren't for us and
[1:36:52] the vials aren't for us and
[1:36:56] it's all for us
[1:36:59] the whole book is for us
[1:37:01] it's all been open for us so that we can
[1:37:04] understand what day we live in what has
[1:37:06] happened what's transpired who we are
[1:37:09] and what our responsibilities are
[1:37:11] what a day to be alive
[1:37:14] what a day to be alive let's all stand
[1:37:18] oh i'm sorry that was a lot of
[1:37:19] information
[1:37:20] that's a lot of overload but
[1:37:23] i didn't even get to a fraction of it
[1:37:25] friends
[1:37:26] my my heart is so full
[1:37:29] it's almost like when god when god lifts
[1:37:32] your eyes to another layer then all of a
[1:37:34] sudden it all fills in
[1:37:36] we talk about the lantern you hold that
[1:37:38] lantern up and right at the edge of the
[1:37:40] lantern you can see the next step in the
[1:37:42] road
[1:37:44] but when you get up there to the next
[1:37:46] step everything around that on the else
[1:37:49] courts and all around now is illuminated
[1:37:51] and when you get up here all of a sudden
[1:37:54] everything opens up and i can see what's
[1:37:55] to the right i can see what's to the
[1:37:56] left i can see all this other stuff it's
[1:37:58] the same thing in the word of god every
[1:38:00] revelation opens up from genesis to
[1:38:02] revelation
[1:38:04] you move forward in the word again and
[1:38:05] it opens up from genesis to revelation
[1:38:07] you move forward in the word again
[1:38:09] that's that's why it's such an exciting
[1:38:11] thing the stimulation of revelation
[1:38:14] and from the initial illumination of the
[1:38:16] church ages come the seals and out of
[1:38:18] the seals come the trumpets out of the
[1:38:19] trumpets come the vile until the whole
[1:38:22] of revelation is open before our
[1:38:24] wondering eyes and we edified
[1:38:28] and purified
[1:38:30] by it
[1:38:34] i don't know about you but i'm edified
[1:38:37] let it purify us oh god let's just bow
[1:38:40] our heads and pray
[1:38:42] lord jesus we thank you father
[1:38:45] we thank you god for your word
[1:38:48] we thank you for the revelation of this
[1:38:50] hour
[1:38:52] lord forgive me if i've got details
[1:38:54] wrong or if i said things in a wrong way
[1:38:56] you know my heart lord
[1:38:58] god i just see what you're showing me i
[1:39:00] see what your prophet is saying
[1:39:02] i pray god that you would just
[1:39:04] give us the wisdom lord to start to
[1:39:06] express lord what you're showing to us
[1:39:08] as your bride in this day
[1:39:11] god take the words jumbled up and broken
[1:39:13] and crisscrossed and
[1:39:15] drawn out and sketched and read too
[1:39:17] quickly take it all lord and put it
[1:39:19] together in the hearts of your waiting
[1:39:21] children lord
[1:39:22] bring revelation by your spirit lord
[1:39:24] that they might catch the heart and meat
[1:39:27] of what's being said and the purpose
[1:39:28] behind it
[1:39:30] lord we love you and we just want to
[1:39:32] give ourselves to you afresh
[1:39:34] purge us and clean us by your word lord
[1:39:37] guide us by your holy spirit
[1:39:39] use us for your glory i pray o god
[1:39:43] in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:39:45] amen
[1:39:47] god bless you i
[1:39:49] i had quotes for everything i said
[1:39:51] i think
[1:39:52] but i had lots of quotes and they're
[1:39:54] going to be posted on the archives
[1:39:56] there's a little section that says notes
[1:39:57] you can download and read them i might
[1:39:59] get to them later this is something i
[1:40:01] want to go through again and again
[1:40:03] because sometimes something doesn't
[1:40:04] click the first time sometimes it's the
[1:40:05] second or third time through but i tell
[1:40:08] you what go listen to it again go
[1:40:10] through the notes
[1:40:12] because the book of revelation is opened
[1:40:14] up
[1:40:16] and the book of revelation is the
[1:40:17] revelation of jesus christ
[1:40:19] and jesus christ is my husband our mate
[1:40:22] our bridegroom
[1:40:24] and the book of revelation isn't scary
[1:40:26] is it something to be avoided it's the
[1:40:28] revelation of jesus christ our
[1:40:30] bridegroom
[1:40:32] and the prophet opened the book of
[1:40:34] revelation friends he opened it we just
[1:40:36] have to trust him
[1:40:39] and quit hanging back fearful because
[1:40:41] the baptist ideas all this happens in
[1:40:43] the tribulation period
[1:40:46] but if the prophet said it
[1:40:48] i say it's good stuff
[1:40:51] and i can believe it and i can believe
[1:40:53] the way he believed
[1:40:55] and if we get anything wrong god will
[1:40:57] show us friends because our motive isn't
[1:40:59] wrong our heart isn't wrong our desire
[1:41:02] isn't wrong we just got to be brave
[1:41:03] enough to move forward and say that's
[1:41:05] nothing but the truth that's exactly
[1:41:07] what he said praise be to god
[1:41:10] i understand what that's about amen
[1:41:14] praise god
[1:41:16] pray for me pray for me
[1:41:19] there's there's you don't understand
[1:41:22] how inadequate
[1:41:24] and un incapable i am of sharing what's
[1:41:27] in my heart you have no idea and you'll
[1:41:29] say many of you will say that was good
[1:41:31] brother chad i got it it was wonderful i
[1:41:32] understood what you were saying but i
[1:41:34] know the mess
[1:41:37] i know what he's showing and i know the
[1:41:39] the the revelation that's sparking off
[1:41:41] in my heart that i can't even see him
[1:41:43] put in the words i know how much better
[1:41:45] it actually is and i'm trusting for him
[1:41:47] to take all the pieces and bring it down
[1:41:50] to a reality in you and you say it's
[1:41:52] wonderful well explain it to me i can't
[1:41:54] but it's wonderful
[1:41:56] amen
[1:41:58] i'm hoping what takes place on this and
[1:41:59] takes place on that end
[1:42:02] because it's wonderful
[1:42:04] our husband is wonderful our bridegroom
[1:42:06] is wonderful his word is beautiful to me
[1:42:10] i love it all
[1:42:12] and everything we talked about today was
[1:42:14] history
[1:42:18] history
[1:42:21] all these things that we thought were
[1:42:23] future
[1:42:25] we're now looking at them from what the
[1:42:26] prophet said and we find out they're in
[1:42:27] the past
[1:42:29] that's why brother branham said over and
[1:42:31] over it may be later than you think
[1:42:34] [Music]
[1:42:36] over and over it may be later than you
[1:42:39] think i got a good i have a good
[1:42:41] impression it was later than what they
[1:42:43] were thinking
[1:42:45] it's been later than what i was thinking
[1:42:49] i said god open our eyes
[1:42:52] open our eyes to see all of the word
[1:42:54] lord i want to see all of my husband
[1:42:58] oh
[1:43:00] i want him fully revealed
[1:43:02] amen let's sing brother
[1:43:06] well i'm resting on the finished work
[1:43:11] of jesus christ today
[1:43:15] all
[1:43:16] circumstances will be gone

[1:45:49] he is the same today
[1:45:52] [Applause]
[1:45:54] the prophet came to show the life the
[1:45:58] pride must have it on display
[1:46:02] the hour has come
[1:46:04] for christ in us to be completely
[1:46:08] glorified

[1:47:48] you know
[1:47:49] revelation is everything
[1:47:51] revelation on the word it's our
[1:47:53] inoculation
[1:47:55] to reasoning it's our inoculation the
[1:47:57] false doctrine revelation on the word of
[1:48:00] god that came through a prophet amen is
[1:48:02] our inoculation against denominational
[1:48:04] thinking against our own thinking
[1:48:07] once you see the structure of the bible
[1:48:10] matching
[1:48:11] time history world war one world war ii
[1:48:14] between world war ii and world war three
[1:48:16] everything happens in the gap between
[1:48:18] the sixth and seventh seals six and
[1:48:20] seven trump at six and seven five and we
[1:48:22] can look and see it all happen
[1:48:25] and somebody comes and says you know
[1:48:27] there's no record that 16 men fell off a
[1:48:29] bridge at jeffersonville
[1:48:34] what
[1:48:35] have you read the bible
[1:48:37] have you looked at the book of
[1:48:38] revelations you think this man made this
[1:48:41] up you think he was born just before
[1:48:43] world war one broke out you think he was
[1:48:45] here when world war ii come do you think
[1:48:47] he was there and made khrushchev found a
[1:48:49] shoe on the desk when the five kings
[1:48:51] come together from west north west and
[1:48:53] east
[1:48:54] do you think he made that cloud appear
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:48:58] i mean what are you talking about 16
[1:49:00] people that fall off a bridge who cares
[1:49:02] i mean have you not read the bible have
[1:49:05] you not looked at what happened amen
[1:49:08] the revelation of what's happened in our
[1:49:10] day finding it in the scriptures seeing
[1:49:12] it in history seeing it in our lives is
[1:49:15] the inoculation against all false
[1:49:18] lies and all kinds of nonsense what is
[1:49:21] it it's the revelation of the word as
[1:49:23] the keeping power for the bride why
[1:49:26] because she sees that ministry in the
[1:49:28] bible friends all the way books through
[1:49:30] the revelation and furthermore she sees
[1:49:33] herself in there along with the seventh
[1:49:35] angel there's the spirit and the bride
[1:49:37] say come
[1:49:40] you can't move the bride off of this
[1:49:43] word she's right she's rooted and
[1:49:45] grounded in the word of god that's
[1:49:48] become a living reality in the day that
[1:49:50] we're alive
[1:49:53] whole world's talking about tension with
[1:49:55] iran tension with china tension with
[1:49:57] russia new nuclear bombs from russia
[1:50:00] all kinds of trade wars and problems in
[1:50:03] the south china sea and there's always
[1:50:05] these little rumors world war three
[1:50:07] world war three oh when you hear that
[1:50:09] you should get so excited inside because
[1:50:12] hey you know what the two prophets
[1:50:14] ministry has to take place before the
[1:50:16] third woe under the second woe praise be
[1:50:19] to god i'll be gone before they start
[1:50:22] ministering
[1:50:23] if they start shooting ships in the
[1:50:25] south china sea i'm getting excited if
[1:50:28] north korea gets more nukes i'm getting
[1:50:30] excited if russia diplomacy falls apart
[1:50:32] with u.s diplomacy praise be to god i'm
[1:50:36] out of here before revelations 11.
[1:50:40] why because i see the scriptures i know
[1:50:42] where i'm at and i know what the news
[1:50:44] means
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:48] she's inoculated
[1:50:50] against all the lies and all the
[1:50:52] ridicule and all the scorn she's been
[1:50:55] inoculated by what by revelation of the
[1:50:58] word
[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:03] don't let it trouble you that i said
[1:51:04] brother branham poured out
[1:51:06] the seventh vial
[1:51:08] in los angeles
[1:51:10] and there was no great earthquake in los
[1:51:11] angeles hasn't sunk
[1:51:13] because when a prophet does something
[1:51:15] and says something it doesn't have to
[1:51:16] happen for years and years and years and
[1:51:19] years
[1:51:22] somebody's got to do something to put it
[1:51:24] in action brother branham had to throw a
[1:51:26] stone in the air to start a whirlwind
[1:51:28] that would create he said see you've got
[1:51:30] to do something to make something else
[1:51:31] happen while that prophet was here he
[1:51:34] had to pour that vial out even if it
[1:51:36] would be decades before that los angeles
[1:51:38] would sing he had to pour it out while
[1:51:40] he was here
[1:51:43] remember jacob was a prophet
[1:51:49] and when laban come looking for his
[1:51:50] idols
[1:51:51] [Music]
[1:51:54] jacob said nobody here has him search
[1:51:55] the tents whoever took your idols will
[1:51:58] die
[1:51:59] is that what he said
[1:52:01] then find the idols rebecca had stolen
[1:52:04] she put him in her in in her in her
[1:52:06] goods and she was sitting on it when her
[1:52:07] father comes in
[1:52:09] lied hid it but jacob already said
[1:52:12] whoever took him will die
[1:52:14] years and years and years later
[1:52:18] rachel's alive she's alive she's alive
[1:52:20] she bears joseph after joseph comes
[1:52:22] benjamin she dies in childbirth with
[1:52:24] benjamin
[1:52:26] why because jacob said whoever stole
[1:52:28] those items would die it doesn't matter
[1:52:30] if it comes years later he had to pour
[1:52:33] out the prophecy right then and that
[1:52:35] prophecy would take effect when she was
[1:52:37] done fulfilling her purpose rachel had
[1:52:39] to bring forth benjamin when benjamin's
[1:52:41] born she's gone
[1:52:44] brother branham had to pour that vial
[1:52:46] out while he's here because he was one
[1:52:47] of the seven vile angels having one of
[1:52:49] the seven last spies
