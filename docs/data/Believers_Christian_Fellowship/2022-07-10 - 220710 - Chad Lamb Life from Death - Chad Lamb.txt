lord i pray that you would take absolute control lord in this service and speak your words of eternal life through these lips of clay god may we see you in the breaking of bread lord and may you feed each of us what we have need of today we give you preeminence and glory and honor and we ask that you would take your place in jesus christ's name amen may god bless you while we're standing let's take our bibles if you will and turn with me to genesis chapter one i want to know we have a visitor here my sister karen kiffer's cousin mary dillard's here god bless you it's good to have you here visiting from oklahoma so you're very welcome any other visitors have we want to make you feel welcome say god bless you also wanted to let you know that it looks like i have to make a final confirmation but it looks like brother burly williams is going to be able to come and preach for us this wednesday so we'll look forward to that so just be praying for that um it should work out he had one other thing to check and so i'll check in with him tomorrow but uh just be praying for that we're looking forward to seeing brother burley again amen genesis chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light amen god bless you as you're seated i mean if you'll keep your bibles handy this morning we've got quite a few scriptures we'd like to look at together i'd like to take the subject this morning life from death and um there's a quote here i'd like to begin reading and then i'll explain the title it says in the message countdown if everything serves god's purpose it's got a resurrection but it can only rise if it serves god's purpose if a flower lives and it's not germatized it will not rise again if you plant corn and is not germatized it will not rise again anything that doesn't serve god's purpose has no resurrection but you can't keep anything in the ground that serves god's purpose it comes forth again to testify of a resurrection we know that all these things are right they are testimonies to us to encourage us so anything that serves god's purpose has got a resurrection coming when we speak of resurrection so many times we we're talking about you know the end time and the resurrection of the sleeping saints but anything that dies and comes back as a resurrection and we find through the bible there's been many many resurrections all the way down through and we'll begin to talk about that a little bit here but nothing's going to ever come back to life unless it serves god's purpose and so many things die and they don't serve god's purpose and they vanish away but there's so many things that seemingly die and like they're finished and if we look here in genesis chapter 1 verse 1 it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and we know by the message that there was something took place on earth before we get to genesis 1 2 we find the earth in a form of judgment it's been judged and something went wrong in order for it to be a judgment something that was going contrary to god's purpose something going contrary to god's will or else there would be no judgment god doesn't just judge that makes sense god judges because something was going contrary to his will to his purpose and now when whatever the original creation or even if it was the original we don't know how many times amen the earth may have been destroyed before i have no idea but we know here that we find the earth in a state of judgment because there was some previous civilization or something like that brother branham says in in the fourth seal so whatever it was it ceased to serve god's purpose and now we find the earth void and and darkness over the face of the deep and it's in a form of judgment but god is not done with the earth the earth will still serve god's purpose amen so there must be a resurrection of god's creation he's not going to leave it in this form but it came into this form because he was no longer serving his purpose but because the earth was there to serve god's purpose he's bringing it back again amen and that's what we see in genesis chapter one is him bringing it back again what do we see we see a resurrection of the creation of god is that right and so nothing will have a resurrection unless it serves god's purpose brother benham says when he begins to speak and he said let there be light and then he separated the water and brought out the dry land and he says let the tree bring forth he said those seeds were already in the earth right they were already there and they were there to serve god's purpose and so they resurrected from their dead grave because he has another purpose he's building an eden he's bringing something else out of his mind and so those seeds laying there still had a purpose to serve so they cannot be utterly destroyed praise be to god let's turn to romans chapter 6 together like i said there's quite a few scriptures i'd like to read so just be ready to flip romans chapter 6 and i'd like to read verse 4. romans 6 and verse 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin he that is dead is free from sin now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord the bible describes us in our state without knowing christ with no knowledge of christ the bible describes us as dead in trespasses and sin we were dead amen we we were like the earth we were shrouded in darkness we our minds were darkened and alienated from god darkened to the things of god we were in a form of judgment and hybridization we were dead in trespasses and sin we were dead to the things of god amen it's like the story of the prodigal son when the prodigal son he leaves the father's house and and he goes off into a strange country and and and he he seemingly forgets who he is or where he came from and he squanders all of his living on riotous living and with harlots and he finds himself in the pig pen amen uh serving now a farmer and serving the pigs until he would have gladly eaten the husks he would have gladly eaten pig food and what a state he had fallen from but it says there that he came to himself he came to himself that wasn't himself that life in the foreign country wasn't himself that wasn't the real hymn that wasn't the reality that's not who he was on the inside that's not who he was uh let's say genetically he's in a foreign land where he doesn't belong amen he's working as a servant which wasn't his job amen he's he's feeding the pigs which wasn't his lot in life amen and now he would so hungry he would eat pigs food which wasn't for him amen it wasn't who he was but at some point he came to himself to come back to what he is amen and when he returns back amen the father receives him gladly amen and and the the older son his older brother amen is angry because the father's showing so much favor and the father says my son who was dead rejoice with me my son who was dead hey listen this is a resurrection from the dead this is a restoration back amen we know the man wasn't dead he was living but to the father he was dead the relationship was broken amen they were dead to one another but when he come to himself there was a resurrection of who he was a resurrection of his purpose a resurrection of his position and he comes back to his position in humility in honor and respect and the father receives him back from the dead amen amen this is our life we come to this earth shrouded in darkness in a state of judgment because of hybridization because of the garden our minds alienated darkened to the things of god shrouded in darkness but god amen is going to bring a word that's going to cause us to come to ourselves and there's going to be a resurrection from the dead amen and and that is uh this is so much has to do with our lives and the cycle of our lives let's turn together to john chapter 11. in john chapter 11 i'm going to begin at verse 1. now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha it was that mary which anointed the lord with an ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick therefore his sister sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick then jesus heard that he said heard when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death before the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby i want to look at this for a minute jesus surely knew that he was going to die he knew the plan because he delayed him going until after lazarus had died but he makes the statement this sickness is not unto death because he has a different idea of death than his disciples do we're going to find that out as we read he's saying this is the purpose of this is not for death it's not it's not as if jesus jesus words could be confused here he says this sickness is not unto death it could almost look like he's making a false prophecy or prosperity prediction because we know that lazarus in the flesh will eventually die in this story amen but jesus is saying it's not for death the purpose of this is not for death there's another purpose in what's happening here this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god amen do you think lazarus knew why he was so sick his sisters knew why he died and all the trouble that they were facing and the tears that they were shedding and the turmoil that the family in the community was in they had no idea that this sickness was not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby how is it that the son of god is going to be glorified in this story because he's coming to bring a resurrection because resurrection brings glory to the son of god verse five now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus when he had heard therefore i love i love verse five god is so good to get our minds in the right frame of mind so that we understand what's happening he says this sickness not to death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby and so that you would know his thoughts towards lazarus and mary and martha he tells you jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus because he's going to do something that seems unloving so right up front he says he loves them so when he delays the delay in coming is no lack of love so the bible sets it in the right order he already declares this sickness is not unto death but there's a purpose in this and that he loves martha and her sister and lazarus so that you'll never misunderstand the purpose of his delay listen this is us friends the things that you're going through is not for death but for life the things we're going through are not for destruction but for the glory of god the things that are happening and the delay sometimes the lord delays to answer our prayer sometimes the lord delays to bring deliverance but the delay is never a lack of love because he's already stated that he loves us amen that we're accepted in the beloved we're part of the beloved it's not a question of love it's a question of purpose amen it's not a question of love but an issue of purpose this sickness had a purpose from the very beginning the first symptoms that lazarus felt there was already a purpose working in his life amen all the prayers that were seemingly unanswered was because of the purpose of god to display his resurrection power so that the son would be glorified amen so when god seemingly doesn't answer don't lose hope he loves you this is for a purpose this problem is for a purpose this issue is for a purpose amen it's not now listen we've got to grow into a place where we're secure enough in christ till we understand that yes i am accepted in the beloved i have gone into a union with my lord amen now the issue is not love the issue is not favor the issue is not his will whether he loves us or not now the issue completely becomes his purpose in everything that happens in our life so that we stop asking the wrong questions and start asking the right questions the wrong question is why is this happening to me what does not god love me and what have i done wrong and all of these other things those are the wrong questions but the right question is lord let me see your purpose and let me act according to your purpose maturity brings us listen maturity in the bride is is is not the childish notion that when the bride matures nothing else will ever bother her again she'll just speak the word and say this and have this kind of power and manifestation no maturity in the bride might look like maturity and the prophet of god who had all kinds of troubles and tribulations and issues in his life but began to see that god was working a purpose in all of it and begin to trust god in his purpose now verse 5 again now jesus loved martha and her sister in lazarus when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he was the reason verse 5 is where it's at is because of what he does in verse 6. he heard that he was sick and did nothing heard that he was sick and didn't go immediately delayed two days verse seven then after the then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judea again his disciples said unto him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and ghost thou thither again jesus answered are there not 12 hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of the this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him and these things saith he and after that he said unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of his sleep then said his disciples lord if he sleepeth he shall do well howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest and sleep then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead brother branham said he had to come down to their language so they would understand they were not understanding heavenly things they were not understanding spiritual things amen they were stuck in the carnal world with only the dimensions they could see they could not lift high enough to see oh what jesus christ could see and so now he had to speak plainly to them lazarus is dead even though he said he's asleep even though he said the sickness is not unto death because what what jesus means with what he says is not always what they thought he meant with what he said amen he knows what he means and he means what he says and he says it right but sometimes our carnal mind cannot comprehend what he means by what he says but he always says what he means and what he means is always right and he always does it according to the way he said but maybe not according to the way we understood what he said so he sleepeth what do you mean sleepeth if he's sleeping he's doing fine they thought he meant taking rest and they said it's like they have no idea what is happening here and they have no idea what realm that christ is operating at and how far away they are from the realm he's operating at and so he tells him plainly that he's dead verse 15 and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent you may believe nevertheless let us go unto him i'm glad i wasn't there to deliver him from his sickness because he needs to fall asleep so that you can see a resurrection amen because the resurrection will glorify the son of god it will fulfill the purpose of god and it will give you faith to believe you need to see a resurrection not a healing praise god said there there to the intent that you might believe never to let us let us go unto him then sent thomas which is called didymus unto his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him i love this statement the bible is so multifaceted and multi-layered no doubt thomas is looking at the situation because they said lord the jews of late have sought to kill you why are you going back into judea he said let us arise go to judea they said the jews of later sought to kill you amen and thomas may have been referring to that and saying you know let us go with him and die with him but there's a spiritual meaning behind it too because thomas has it exactly right amen if you ever want to serve god's purpose you better go with him and die with him amen you better be crucified with christ and die to yourself amen and have a a death experience so that you can have a resurrection experience thomas had it right let us go with him and die with him and i say tonight let us go with him and die with him amen let us die so there can be a resurrection because we need a resurrection experience to prove to manifest the glory of the son of god amen the lord god is glorified in resurrection he has proven in resurrection he's vindicated in resurrection he is all about resurrection let's go to mark chapter 12 and look at something jesus says here and in mark chapter 12 jesus is going to set the record straight in in mark chapter 12 around about verse 18 we're not going to read from there but the sadducees begin to ask him a question about the resurrection and because they don't understand it they don't believe in it and they start to talk about the woman who was given to a man and they didn't raise up seed but according to the law of moses she should be given to the next younger brother to raise up seed into the dead and so there were seven brothers so they went all the way down the line and and she had them all they all had her and brought no seed and finally the woman died and they said in the resurrection whose wife will she be and jesus begins to say you have no idea what you're talking about you're like you're like an ant trying to explain a human you have no clue what you're even saying but he comes here in verse 26 in order to set the record straight he says verse 26 and as touching the dead that they rise have you not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake on him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living ye therefore do greatly err listen he is not the god of the dead he's the god of the living when he come to moses in the burning bush abraham in the flesh was dead isaac in the flesh was dead jacob in the flesh was dead they were all known by moses to be dead yes but he says i am currently present tense the god of abraham that means abraham had to be living somewhere he did not say i was the god that abraham served i was the god of isaac i was he said i am right now today the god of abraham who is in existence somewhere because the seed of god does not die that's why you could say lazarus although lazarus was dead he admitted he was dead and in the carnal understanding he's dead and the heavenly understanding he sleepeth because lazarus can't die amen so he says you don't understand amen he's he's not the god of the dead but he's god of the living you therefore do greatly air it only looked like he was dead it only seemed like he was dead but to god he was alive that's why when we experience death with loved ones and death with family members it's so different for a believer than it is for the rest of the world it's not even the same experience there's grief sure and tears and a feeling of loss and all of that but there's such a revelation in this hour and such an understanding amen that if that was a part of god and come from god it's went back to god it can no more die amen it cannot be dead it has to be alive that that brother that sister has to remain alive somewhere because he's not the god of the dead he's the god of the living amen let's turn to mark chapter 5. mark chapter 5 and we'll read verse 35. and why yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the master any further and as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid only believe and he suffered no man to follow him save peter and james and john the brother of james and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly and when he was come in he saith unto them why make you this ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn but when he had put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the dams on them that were with them and entereth in where the damsel was lying and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha kumi which is being interpreted damso i say unto thee arise and straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was of the age of 12 years and they were astonished with great astonishment and he charged them straightly with that no man should know it and commanded them something should be given her to eat here comes jesus and they they they have a sick girl jairus has a sick girl and begs him to come and pray for her lay hands on her but along the way they found out she's dead but jesus is not one drop troubled at this statement because when he gets there he says what is what is all this fussing what is all this to do the dams will sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn amen but he he had already tried to teach him the principle amen that children of god don't die they don't die it looked like she was dead but she wasn't dead amen she was alive somewhere and when she when he reached and called her name and reached her hand and lifted her up and called her name he told her to arise and at the voice of the lord she arose and began moving began walking again it only looked like she was dead but she wasn't dead amen in the terms of medical science she was dead maybe the doctor already checked the pulse maybe they already determined that she was dead amen but but god is not looking at what medical science is looking at he knows the reality of the reality of the reality that that girl was not dead she was just sleeping and that christ could call her back anytime listen if brother baby said if you ever have you ever have eternal life you always had eternal life he said that seed gene of god that was within you is a part of god amen and it was there from your birth it was in you when you were born amen and it was it was there laying dormant it was as if it was dead you were dead in sins and trespasses just as dead as the prodigal son was dead not dead but seemingly dead separated from god living the wrong kind of life amen in that sea gene in you if it's got etern if you have eternal life you always had eternal life amen so so it looked like that it was dead but god knew that it was only sleeping it looked like the real you the the seed that was meant to be you it looked like it was dead but it was only sleeping amen it looked like the earth was completely dead but god knew the seeds were laying down there ready to come forth all he had to do was order the condition and the condition would bring the the regeneration and the birth amen and they would come to life they were laying their dormant those seeds under the earth in genesis 1 2 were sleeping amen and there's so many people that are still sleeping and they look like they're dead so many loved ones that have strayed away family members amen not believing children that we're holding out for it looks like they're dead they're not dead amen if they're children of god they're only sleeping that seed's laying dormant amen waiting for the voice of the lord to come to them to call them to rise up and as soon as the lord comes to them personally and bids them to rise they will rise amen they will awaken because his power is manifest in resurrection his power is manifest in resurrection amen let's go to colossians chapter 2. colossians chapter 2. and verse 9 colossians 2 9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principalities and power in him in whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins in the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses you were dead in sins it was as you were as if you were dead but he has quickened you with him you you were buried with him in baptism so that you could raise resurrect again with him in newness of life you have died so that you could be resurrected because this oh my goodness this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god this condition you're born into is not for death but it's for the glory of god amen the seemingly death that the bad things that happen in life even the wanderings away and straying away and living in the world that sickness is not unto death but it's for the glory of god so that the son of god can be manifest can be glorified in your life in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed he says oh if i could get the world to see that why there you are there is the body of christ living standing redeemed redeemed oh my justified in his sight why are we justified we are his victory the church is his victory we came forth in the last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory amen when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us that's right and we're already potentially arise because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational creeds to an eternal word of the eternal god which is him his self working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever what is the what is his victory and the reason of his death resurrection amen what resurrection the restoration of the bride tree is a resurrection amen it looked like in the dark ages it was dead it looked like it was completely dead it had fallen the the those insects had eaten it down to where it was just a stump it looked on the surface dead it looked like the church had died it looked like what started at pentecost was completely dead amen but brother bannon said there was still life down in the roots amen there was still something there amen and god was going to bring a resurrection and so he started in the reformation to resurrect to res restore the bride tree and we're living here in the final stage of the resurrection when the resurrection power will be made manifest in the bride what are we here for resurrection even in even under the the the catholic church the death that had set in amen to the to the church through the first four church ages coming all the way to the dark ages amen it looked like it was dead on the surface it was dead there was no sign of life amen but that sickness was not unto death but for the glory of god because he said i will restore saith the lord amen there was a prophecy already laying down that i will restore so death is not the finish line amen death amen is just a purpose that god has to bring his glory into full view amen further down in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says notice the vindicated word in his body is his very victory in the reason of his death see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell and preached to the souls in prison that right his flesh only died when he raised it up again and quickened it quicken means made alive his flesh which was his body and that's the word it's been laying dead for years but gradually begin to come in the reformation and now she is standing upon her feet brother branham begins to show that the the word the word was was as if it was dead amen it was as if there was no life it was as if it was dead and he says this is what he said and that's the word it's been laying dead for years but gradually coming back in the reformation and now she's standing on her feet and then the next thing he says is oh i wish i had time to go into ezekiel and hit those dry bones because when you get to ezekiel and the dry bones amen there's a restoration of the army of god it's laying out there dead dead bones it's just dry bone it's a valley of dust and a valley of bones amen but under the prophecy amen the word goes forth and when the word goes forth it starts to move bone to bone amen and then it covers in sin you then it covers it in skin and then it's standing there after three stages it comes back bone to bone sinew and flesh and now it's standing there an army ready for full life amen but there's got to be a call for the wind to come there's got to be the latter rain there's got to be a sweeping of the holy ghost at the opening of the word to come in to give life into this army it looked like it was dead but god knew it wasn't dead all it needed was the word to be spoken over it and that army started coming back together under what the power of the word put it back to life amen but there had to be a final stage a fourth stage amen there had to be a latter reign there had to be an open book amen there had to be a sounding of the seven thunders to do what sweep the life the breath amen the wind to come back into that church and now she's resurrected she's alive she's standing on her feet and she's marching to zion amen even that was not unto death but for the glory of god it served a purpose praise god i'm laying this down because we want to bring this home to our lives death is never what it seems and i'm gonna i'm not even talking about natural death and this body of flesh breathing oxygen in and out i'm talking about there's all kinds of death there's death to dreams there's death to ideas there's death to doctrines there's death to churches death to movements death but death is never what it seems because if it serves god's purpose it'll resurrect again let's look at galatians chapter 2. galatians chapter 2 and verse 20 galatians 2 and 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me i'm crucified with christ but i live but now it's not me it's christ that liveth in me now i i've gone through death to a resurrection i've been crucified to be brought up in his life amen not amen for the glory of god so that his purpose could be made manifest in me that's why we've gone through this cycle let's go back a page to galatians chapter 1 verse 11. galatians chapter 1 verse 11 but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached to me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ for you have heard of my conversion in time past in the jewish religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted him and profited in the jews religion above many mine equals in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased god who separated from me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son and me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them which are apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus we know that the apostle paul was zealous he was zealous for he thought he was zealous for the lord but he realized later he said he was zealous for the tradition of the fathers and he he was confused between the traditions of the fathers and the will of god and he was zealous for the traditions of the fathers amen but didn't realize he thought he was zealous for the lord but really he was just zealous for the traditions of the fathers but god stopped him on his way to damascus to persecute the christians and and there he got a revelation of who christ was and where he was abiding because he found out that christ was in the people that paul was persecuting and and all of a sudden paul he doesn't go confer with man and realize this is a major statement for paul he never conferred with flesh and blood because all that paul had before he got from gamaliel he had went to the best school and conferred with man to get the best teaching so now when paul makes this statement it's a huge statement for the apostle paul it's not like paul was just an ignorant fisherman and all of a sudden the lord came to me said i didn't confer with man well we didn't expect you to i mean but paul had been conferring with man all along he got his doctrine right he had been taught in the best school by the best doctor of divinity amen but now in this encounter he's got to die to that he's got the apostle paul has to go through a death he's got to die to everything he was and everything he thought and everything he wanted and all ambitions that he had he's got to let it die he's got to let it rot and now he can't confer with any man because he made that mistake before now he's got to get it straight from the lord let's look at this over in philippians philippians chapter 3 philippians chapter 3 verse 4. he says though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any of me if any other man thinketh that he have aware of he might trust in the flesh i'm more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law of pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteous righteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gained to me those i counted lost for christ yea doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that i may win christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded he's saying if you're already perfect if you're already mature have this same mind that don't believe i've already arrived but i'm striving for i'm pressing towards to great a hold of what's already got a hold of me thus minded if any if anything you be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you nevertheless where to we have already attained where do we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mine the same thing the apostle paul was saying i i had all the credentials i was circumcised on the eighth day of the stock of benjamin a pharisee of the pharisees i i i was zealous unto good works i had it all but i had to die to all of that to grab ahold of christ and i had to reckon he says reckon yourselves now for dead to sin wrecking yourselves down dead to all of those things to the world to unbelief to man's ideas wrecking yourself dead to all of that that i might attain to christ that i might attain to the resurrection that i might amen be a partaker of his resurrection that i might know him and the power of his resurrection paul had to have a resurrection his idea had to die amen and paul was was zealous because there was a certain nature inside paul there was a certain attribute of god inside paul there was a certain nature laying there amen but but the carnal part of paul would take that and run to the school and run to the traditions of the fathers amen but when it came time for god to awaken him he had to die to all of that and he had to let it all go away and let it all die amen because god was going to take and revive resurrect bring back paul amen and the apostle he was saul but now he's going to come back as paul amen and paul is going to be zealous and to good works paul is going to be circumcised not on the eighth day but circumcised without hands by the circumcision of christ paul is going to find out it's not so much i'm a benjamin but i'm of god i'm a child of god i'm a stock of god amen i'm circumcised by the holy ghost he's going to have to drop all of that to get the real amen he's going to have to die to everything that was carnal to get a hold of the spiritual and so he begins the the lay it all down and say i count it as dung that i may win christ and then i might know him in the power of his resurrection i say death is a good thing because it's not the end of the story for the believer it's the beginning because this death this that paul was going through was not for his extermination but for his perfection this dying out to his thinking dying out to his education dying out to the traditions of the fathers dying out to his birth heritage dying out to all that he had been working for all of his life amen it wasn't for death but it was for the glory of god he had to die out to it all so that he could be resurrected amen so instead of serving his own purpose he could serve god's purpose the apostle paul amen he thought that he was zealous for the word but he was zealous for the traditions of the fathers so paul was saul was operating in his own purpose he had his own desire his own purpose something he wanted to accomplish he was in with the high priest and the elders and and and he was climbing the ladder if you could say it that way he had been to the best school he was recognized by the chief priests the elders and the high priests they knew him even when he come to his trial and he begins to speak amen there at the temple he says your your elders and the priest they know me i was in i was in good company with them i was climbing as it were the the ladder i was i was becoming something amen and he had to lose every bit of it to become something because the path he was on was the path to nowhere amen it was death but in order to have life he had to die so there could be a resurrection of the purpose of god that was in paul's life not paul's purpose amen in the message the world is falling apart it says we are dead our lives are hidden in god through christ and not only that but we are raised with him raised up what in a system a denomination organization we are resurrected in the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is within you why all these man-made systems must fall not once more i'll shake the world but i'll shake heavens and those things that cannot be shook is what will remain and we receive a kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot be shook or moved that's the kingdom of god not a system not a political wheel not a denomination but a kingdom amen and its subjects is dead to the systems of the world its subjects are dead to these organizations it's dead to these political systems and it's alive and resurrected by the power of the king let's look at galatians chapter 6. just jump back real quick to galatians chapter 6 verse 14. galatians 6 14 but god forbid that i should glory saving the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified to me and i unto the world there was a separation amen he's recognized himself in calvary as dead to the world and the world dead to him he died to his old life to have his new life and brother bam says the subjects are dead to organizations dead to political systems dead to the systems of the world and you know we have to make sure that we remain dead dead to organizational systems but we've got to make sure that no organizational thinking comes into this new life that it's got to die it's got to die it's got a rod amen nothing from the from the previous organizations can be carried in to this new life it's got to die paul was so thoroughly dead and and so thoroughly resurrected that the apostle paul amen he would stand and contest with the judaizers the jews who were trying to mingle the law and grace together amen and before he was all law all circumcision all feast days all i mean everything la la la la la but he had so died to that amen and been born again that now he was serving god's purpose and he was preaching the message of grace and now when the jews come along who hadn't died to the system the apostle paul was standing there saying not the circumcision made with hands that's not the one that counts it's not mount sinai that can be touched with with hands it's not this it's not that but he's brought him into a spiritual reality a spiritual kingdom a position in christ paul didn't bring anything over paul didn't adapt any of that old into the new he let it all die and he took it all for what it was now he found it all in christ and christ was the fulfillment of it all praise be to god and neither can we bring any other baptist thinking or our wesleyan thinking or pentecostal thinking it's all gonna die amen because the prophet of god come along and he illuminated this word and brought the word back to life it was laying as if it was dead but it was brought back to life it was resurrected what paul had taught had died through the church ages but it was resurrected in our day and now we can see it for the intent that he had when he spoke it amen not what man has done with it but the intent that it was spoken with the intent that the word was laid down with the intention that the gospel was written out and now we have that and in order to fully grasp amen what the message is teaching us we have to absolutely die and separate from any previous thinking at all amen the apostle paul was able to encountered all this dumb amen i i've said before i'm thankful that i was raised in church i'm thankful that i i learned where the bible was where the books of the bible were i'm thankful i learned how to read it i'm thankful that i learned all the bible stories because when i come to the message i knew the story of moses i i already knew the story of noah i could already see what the prophet of god was teaching so there's a portion of that i'm thankful for but there's a portion of that that's been a handicap to me there's a portion of that upbringing as a child and and the memorizing bible verses with the wrong understanding of the bible verse with the with the teaching of the of the what was supposed to be types and shadows and being taught in a certain way that it begins to diminish the true type and shadow that the prophet would bring with understanding what paul wrote and the commandments that he gave to the church to be a certain way but the prophet comes in and teaches it some way completely different as some of that has been detrimental to me and we've had to die out to those things over time and say it's not the way i thought it was when i was a kid i don't read the bible the same way i did when i was a child growing up in the pentecostal church i don't read the bible the same way i did five years ago because the message amen is brought resurrected the life of the word brought back the true meaning the revelation of the word and everything that i thought before and i had been taught before in my school of gamaliel in the pentecostal church it's all got to go it's all got to be considered dung amen it doesn't mean anything now the only thing that's reality is this revelation through this messenger in the end time it is the correct understanding of the word it is the correct interpretation of the word amen in the in message be not afraid is his eye the prophet says look what he chose fisherman illiterate ignorant that he might manifest himself you might say to me about paul paul said he had to forget everything he ever know to know christ died daily that he might know christ i said before i would love i would love to have a button in my brain that would be complete delete and i wish that i had a usb drive or an sd card that i could slip in somewhere and it would be 1200 sermons in the full bible text and maybe a bible dictionary and maybe i don't even need the bible dictionary because you realize so often that you look at the message and you're reading your bible and all of a sudden the revelation's hit and it strikes and something opens up and you say i never saw it that way before and the reason you didn't see it that way before is because of previous understanding and god had to break that away so you could see the word as it actually is and so i would love i would love to have the delete button i hope that's what we get when we leave this body and go into the next that there is a a partial delete like everything that was not god's original intent in the word goes away and everything i picked up that was true stays and then gets magnified amen i want so bad to forget the things that i learned wrong and count them as done not discounting the fact that i thank god that he held me in morality because of my upbringing i thank god that that that i knew the bible said i thank god for all of that i'm not discounting any of that but oh i picked up so many things that were wrong i picked up so many wrong ideas and you could be in the same spot having grown up in the message it doesn't mean you're free from that because we we had all kinds of ideas that mingled in and brought in and just because you're raising the message didn't mean you got the correct understanding first time around there's still a lot of dying to do even being raised in the message and sometimes the dying is harder because you thought it was right the first time around like for those of us who've come from outside the end it's like yeah that was nothing this is it lord let me die to it all but if you have to transition from the wrong understanding of the message to the right understanding the message having grown up in the message you really got some dying to do and you really need the lord to come with the sword that can divide amen to down to the bone and the moral of the bones so that you can really get down to what is truth and cut away everything that was man's idea and say god help us with that help keep cutting us and shaving us and cutting off everything that's not right and keep us in the true in the right amen let's let's turn to exodus chapter 2 together and i want to look a little bit at the life of moses i'm not just wanting to look at one aspect of death and resurrection of life from death but i want to look at a couple different aspects or applications exodus chapter 2 and verse 11. exodus 2 and 11. and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an egyptian smiting in hebrew one of his brethren and he looked this way in that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand and when he went out the second day behold two of the men of the hebrews strove together and he said to him that that did the wrong wherefores minus thou thy fellow and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us and tendest thou to kill me as thou kill us the egyptian and moses feared and said surely this thing is known now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses but moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian and he sat down by a well brother branham says in the message proving his word also he proved it by moses and when moses when the difficulty was so against him moses had it in his mind that perhaps to be a deliverer that his mother had probably told him he was born a proper child she was his tutor that raised him up in pharaoh's palace no doubt had told him son we we have prayed that we'd be delivered and we believe that you are that child that god would use to deliver and and see he come up and was to be the son of pharaoh's daughter and we find out that he was to be heir to the throne why no doubt it was in her in their mind then that he would become the next pharaoh and that's how he would deliver the people by being the next pharaoh but if that would have been so then he would have done it through a material through an act of politics but god doesn't always work like that moses brother brown teaches us moses had an understanding that he was born a proper child and born to be a deliverer and he got that from his mother who was his nurse when when he was put as a baby into the little ark and floated down the nile his sister miriam followed along to see where the ark would go and the ark floated down and it went past pharaoh's daughter and and she sent a maiden into uh to pick it up and she said this is one of the hebrews children and miriam popped out right then and said would you like me to fetch a nurse for to nurse the baby and and she said yes and so he brought moses mother into the palace and paid her wages to to nurse little moses and so brother man picks up the rest of the story and tells us moses mother amen began to teach moses that he was born a proper child that there had been prayer for deliverance probably even that there was the prophecy to abraham i don't know exactly what he heard but what the prophet tells us she she began to tell him and and he began to believe that he was the deliverer he began to believe that he was the one the proper child and his and his faith wasn't wrong was he wrong no he was right he was wrong but then the idea began to circulate that you know when he becomes the next pharaoh and he could deliver he'll be in power he'll have armies and and he's learning military uh uh strategy and and he's and he's being trained brother bam teaches us all this he's being trained in the in the wisdom of egypt and he knows the language he knows the customs he knows that he knows uh uh all these things he's he's uh versed in science he's versed in politics he's versed in military uh conquest so he's the perfect man he's got everything he needs you know just like it looked like paul was the perfect man it looked like paul had everything he needed but everything paul had he had to lose to get what he really needed he had to die to it to gain what he really needed and now moses it looks like moses he's got all the tools and all the equipment necessary to be the deliverer that he's prophesied to be that he had a sign over him showing he would be amen and his family believed he would be but god doesn't work it that way it's not going to happen by material it's not going to happen by the mind of man moses is going to have to die to those things to be used by god the message a prisoner brother ben says god is looking for prisoners he's always done it you might search it through the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but christ even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody you're only connected with christ and him only then god can use you until then you can't going out sometimes speaks rough speaks rough to people i'm trying to get you to cut loose you've got to have a starting place like someone sometime like sometimes calls out the woman bobbing her hair and wearing these clothes and hold and maintain their christian profession say that's a little thing well you've got to start somewhere so begin right there in your abcs and cut loose the worldly looks anyway and become a prisoner of christ and you just keep on cut loose everything until finally the last line is cut loose then you're you're a prisoner then you become in his grip and he's got you in his grip now moses know that he was born the deliverer he knew that and did you notice with the ambition that moses had knowing his mother had told him over there that as she was his nurse made no doubt when moses the little baby was born that his mother said you know moses your dad amram and i prayed constantly we knowed and seen in the word it was time for the coming of a deliverer and we prayed lord god we want to see that deliverer one night the lord told us in a vision that you would be born and you would be the deliverer we wasn't afraid of the king's commandment we didn't care what the king said then we know that you were born a deliverer now moses we know that we we couldn't bring you up right now remember they had been down there 400 years in egypt said when we wanted to get you the right thing the right education the right training so i took you and put you in a little ark and set you out in the nile and how strange that the currents taken that little ark down through the through the reeds and rushes and brought it right down miles away and turned it right into pharaoh's palace where pharaoh's daughter was where her bathing pool was and now that i know that she'd need a woman to raise you and in them days of course they didn't have those bottles to raise the babies on so she'd have to have a wet nurse and miriam i sent her down and she stood there and she said i know where i can find a wet nurse and come and got me and moses the doors all shut honey you're 16 years old now and you're going to be pharaoh's son and someday you're going to be the deliverer that's going to take the people out of here moses ambition begin to grow i'll study mother i'll study everything i can you know what i'll do i'll study how to be a military man i'll know how this those people out there i'll take care of those people out there i'll be a great general bishop so i'll know how it's done and i'll take it out i'll get me a phd or ll i'll do it we know what happened to moses he got some level of confidence and understanding believed himself to be a deliverer and and when he began to see an egyptian smiting a a hebrew slave he went he killed that egyptian and he hit him in the sand and all of his intellect and all of his wisdom had brought him to this point but then he begins to get scared and he and he runs away and he runs dominion because pharaoh now wants to take his life his whole plan came crumbling down in one instant when pharaoh was angry with him and wanted to destroy him now all of his politics all of his uh education all of his connections in egypt were not going to do any good anymore god had stripped away in one instance everything that he was depending on everything that he was looking to everything that was going to make him able to do what he believed he was going to do was stripping away and he goes down in the midian and and it's as if the prophecy dies it's as if moses now to the egyptians is dead it's as if egypt is dead to him he's living a whole different kind of life he's living a whole different kind of lifestyle he's in a different land with different people married now raising a child tending his father's sheep i mean there's no more ambition to deliver the people there's no more hope it's dead because there's going to be a resurrection and the resurrection will glorify god not moses the resurrection there's only one person in the resurrection going to get the glory and it's not going to be moses it's not going to be the children of israel but it's going to be almighty god who's the only one who can bring this deliverance let's look at exodus chapter 3. in texas chapter 3 god comes and visits moses said i've heard the cry of my people i've come down to deliver him now i go i send you and we pick this up in verse 10 he says now come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt look at this statement we know he believed he was the deliverer he believed he was the one now he that whole dream has died that whole thing in moses is dead and moses is out here and god finally comes down now it's time for moses to move into that ministry moses is going to go into his purpose that god has for him and when god comes to him and says i'm sending you he says moses said god who am i that i should go into pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt i think it's safe to say that moses's ambition was dead moses's dreams were dead moses thoughts were dead moses plans were dead any hope that moses had of being the deliverer was dead until when god finally says all right boy now it's time he says who am i that i can go to fair i can't do this and we know because we talked last week about the dialogue that he sets up arguing with god and god has to deal with moses to get him to go because there is no plan b moses is the only one but god needed moses to die to himself to his ideas to him ambitions so that god could resurrect the purpose in his life because the only way that moses is going to come back into egypt is through a resurrection power resurrecting the purpose that god has in him why did it die because moses was going to do it according to his own purpose it died why do we find genesis 1 2 in destruction because somehow whatever happened was no longer serving the purpose of god so it died so that it could be resurrected to serve the purpose of god moses now is dead to the the hebrews dead to the children of israel dead to egypt and egypt is dead to him he's dead as a deliverer he's dead with his idea of a deliverer it's dead because god is going to come with resurrection power and bring him right back to the purpose he had from him when he was born he couldn't do it on his own god didn't want him to do it on his own you know i don't know about you but when i came to the message i was going to save the world when i got the truth everyone was going to hear the truth and i understood it and i knew what the prophet was saying and i saw water baptism in jesus name and i saw serpent seed and i saw amen how a woman should dress and how a man should dress and conduct himself and i saw what was wrong with the denominational church and i i was going to take this to the world and i was going to save my whole family and i was going to save everybody and and i tell you those efforts amounted to nothing amen until i realized i can't save anybody i don't even completely understand the message right i i don't have it all figured out i'm no good at this and i failed every attempt that i had and then i would go to witness to somebody and end up getting so angry with them i would be in an argument with them and not displaying the life of christ until i slew an egyptian and hit him in the sand then you realized i'm nothing i have no power i have no strength i have no ability you know you start off i'm the bride of jesus christ amen you are the bride of jesus christ but if you're acting as the bride serving your own purpose in this life he'll let that vision die in you until you wonder whether you're bright or not he'll let you get sidelined he'll let you get weighed late he'll let you fall on your face god will let you die to your dream of being bride until you realize that you're nothing without him you're not bribed by your merit you're not bribed by your good looks you're not bribed by your wisdom or intellect you're not bright because of your good understanding your bride by his election and his election only and it was a purpose he purposed in you before the foundation of the world and the minute you stop serving his purpose and start serving your own purpose he'll let your dream of bride die until you find yourself in sin you find yourself in compromise you find yourself in confusion and you wonder who am i am i even until god will come to you and say you're my bride and you say who am i that i should be your bride who am i and this this this death is for a purpose amen we've got to die sometimes to our wrong thinking to our wrong ideas sometimes our children are raised down and we tell them you're a bride and you're this and you're that amen don't be too scared when god lets them fall flat amen don't be too nervous because god needs to break some of that wrong understanding till they can die to their concept of what it means to be bride die sometimes to their own ideas being raised in perfection being raised in the word amen some of them may have the wrong idea not all of them some of them have the right idea but if some of them have the wrong idea god is going to get his resurrection power on display and he'll let our vision sometimes of who we are die he'll let our understanding sometimes of who we are die just like he let paul die to his old life just like he let moses die so that he can bring a resurrection then all of a sudden in the resurrection when god begins to say you're my bride i want you to be a witness in the world you say who am i to be a witness you know i can't do anything right you know i'm a failure to start with you know i can't speak right you know i can't keep the doctrine dry you know i still don't feel like i completely understand everything praise be to god when you get to that place you're just about right that's why sometimes i i this is just a personal note just me personally i don't like the term my ministry i know brother branham used it and it's fine if somebody says it and the way brother baby i don't have a problem with that somebody say my ministry is this my ministry that in my ministry as long as the right attitude is behind it but i can't bring myself to say it because i don't want my ministry i don't want my own ministry i have no ministry i have nothing i i you know i i'm so far gone from believing that i'm a good pastor made so many mistakes and still confused on how to do things and don't understand how to do things right because there's no training there's no book i don't know amen there's i have no ministry i don't want a ministry if there's any ministry that comes through this flesh it's got to be the ministry of christ amen and sometimes god will let us even die to our idea of our ministry i've seen it so many times somebody'll get called into the ministry and it's like a flash goes off and also they minister several places it goes really well the people are super blessed then all of a sudden you don't hear anything from them for a while it's as if they go on a shelf and it's as if whatever happened and god will let that just simmer until you begin to doubt well maybe i said something wrong maybe god's not really going to use me maybe i'm not going to have the ministry i thought i thought i was going to be a traveling minister i thought i was going to be a pastor i thought i was in a venus now i have no idea what i am if you've ever ministered you know what i'm talking about i don't you know early on somebody would say are you an evangelist or you i have no idea what i am i don't know somebody said i even had somebody tell me well if god's called you he's got to tell you where you fit where your position is and i had to honestly goodness i have no idea i don't know if i'm an evangelist i don't know if i'm a missionary i don't know if i'm pastor i don't know what i am all i know is i can't do anything without him [Music] do you have a ministry no i don't have a ministry because if i had a ministry i couldn't do you any good but he's got a ministry to work through the fivefold ministers it's his ministry we used to look to big ministers their ministry that ministry his ministry that man's ministry helped me that man's ministry taught me that man's ministry and it's not always wrong to use that terminology that's not wrong brother ben views the terminology but if you use it with the right attitude but with the wrong understanding that man's ministry happened me this ministry helped me that man the only one that will ever help you is the ministry of jesus christ through the five full ministry but if it's not the ministry of jesus christ you're going to fall flat somewhere somewhere along the line there's going to be a train wreck and everything's going to come to a halt and you're going to be what happened it's going to be like what happened to that person what happened to me what happened to my family what happened to our church because god will let it die so that he can resurrect it to his purpose he'll let us as individuals die so that he can resurrect us to his purpose he'll let churches die so he can resurrect that church to his purpose anybody who's been here for any length of time you know what it's like to see a church die die by falling off the word die by losing the spirit die amen die to pride die you know we had brother lonnie we had we had we had this we we've got this and we've got that and we've been around long enough to watch god let it die to where you were ashamed of where you went to church instead of being proud of the church you did you were ashamed to say i go to so that all that nonsense can die out of us and when all that nonsense gets washed up that i'm under this ministry and i'm attached to this and this great man and this great church until god can let all of that die in us until we can finally say who am i who are we we're absolutely nothing if god doesn't come work his purpose in us all we're going to do is ruin his purpose and he's going to let us go to another cycle of death and i don't want another cycle of death i want to stay in life amen i want to stay in life and the only way to stay in life is to reckon yourself dead but alive in christ dead to the world dead to the systems dead to carnal thinking and alive in christ so moses could come and say i'm no deliverer what did you do moses one egyptian and then i ran away scared but but what about the plagues what about the rod what about the sign of leprosy in your hand what about the mighty works that god did to you what about the parting of the red sea what about and he says i didn't do any of that that wasn't me my ministry produced one dead egyptian and i ran away scared and delayed the exodus but his ministry brought the plagues redeemed his children out of egypt parted the red sea turned a bitter water sweet his ministry did that so i love so much and brother brandon brother branham said i wasn't the one who did those things i was just standing near when he did them and so so many times that term my ministry or your ministry or his ministry let's just lose all of that thinking right now and let it all die and say if anything good comes it's the ministry of christ that word depending he's the deliverer he's the minister he's the divider of the word it's all him there's nothing we can do and then we get to a place as a church through humility which says we're not a great church we're nothing look at where we came from look at what we participated in look at how we died we're not a great church we're not a great people we're not wonderful all i am is a vessel he wants to use for his purpose and when there was humility god brought a resurrection with humility and brokenness with the right understanding of who we really are amen with failure in ourselves and trust in god and a reliance on his word he brings a resurrection and now the resurrection of even this local assembly is to serve his purpose but i'll guarantee you this if we ever stop serving his purpose and start serving our own he'll let it die again because it must serve his purpose and if in our families we start serving our own purpose he'll let the family crumble if our marriages are only serving our purpose he'll let marital trouble come amen if there's if our family is our purpose then god will let trouble in our family come our families are put together to serve his purposes our marriages are put together to shine his life our churches are put together to serve his purpose amen certain brothers are given to certain places in the faithful ministry to serve his purpose amen but it's all his purpose and it let everything else die so that he can resurrect his people to his purpose [Applause] so he can resurrect your family to his purpose he can resurrect your marriage to his purpose he can resurrect your church to his purpose he can resurrect your amen your gift in your life to his purpose i mean god will there'll be there'll be gifts even a gift of writing songs a gift of singing amen it'll sometimes take off like a rocket there'll be a song that blesses everybody amen you'll find it sung in churches all over and then if somebody begins to think well my gift my gift then all of a sudden bang it may not even believe you lost a gift it may be somewhere else in your life until you can get to moses and say who am i lord to write a song who am i lord to stand in front of the people and sing who am i lord to play an instrument on the platform who am i who am i lord to stand in the point who am i to travel to the floor who am i who am i lord i they won't receive me i'm a failure well throw the rod down look at your hand but i can't talk right and i can't get it right and i i'll make another mistake praise god let him just die just go ahead and die and let him bring a resurrection because everything that serves his purpose has a resurrection if you find yourself used of god at one time and now sitting on the shelf just be humble just be broken just recognize that you're nothing and let him resurrect you let him resurrect his purpose in you praise be to god the apostle paul says for i am the least of the apostles praise god that was a man god could use the least of the apostles wrote almost the entire new testament the least of the apostles was the first church age messenger the least of the apostles was the only one that understood grace correctly the least of the apostles but his attitude towards himself is what made him usable by god for i am the least of the apostles that i am not meat to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly than they all yet not i oh it sounded like he was going to go the wrong direction let's read this again i'm lisa the apostles not even worthy to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church what was it his failure kept him in humility his death amen after the resurrection he still remembered what he but by the grace of god i am what i am so how is any of us what we are how is it your bride how is it you have a gift in your life how is it you have a position in the church by the grace of god i am what i am and this grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly than they all so he used the word i i labored more abundantly in the all and then he says yet not i but the grace of god which was with me it wasn't i it was the grace of god that was with me i'm not the one that opens the blinded eyes i'm not the one amen that was that came down at the river i'm not the one that does all those all these miracles i was only standing by when he did it wasn't i it was the grace of god that was with me it was it's not i it's the spirit of god working through this this vessel of clay the vessel of clay without the spirit of god is nothing in the message it is the rising of the sun as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept and the bride coming of christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheaf what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat it proved it was a sheaf hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism what is this that we're in the resurrection resurrected out of dark denominationalism it died it went into the dark ages and died the seed went into the ground and rotted the tree was cut down to the stump with no life amen it was as if it was dead but it can't die because there's a purpose laying there no more than you can die because there's a purpose laying in you it couldn't die because there's a purpose laying in there so out of death he brings life out of the cycle of death because there's a purpose laying in that church he begins to restore i will restore saith the lord because i have a purpose amen in all of this and my purpose i will be glorified in the resurrection of the church amen now we can say i'm bride we've been restored to what the church was supposed to be at pentecost when it came forth it was supposed to move on in the word but they left we've been brought back to that so that we can move on to where they were supposed to go amen praise god i love that truth but that truth has nothing to do with me it's his purpose in my life this resurrection that's taking place in me and you is not for me and you this resurrection is to glorify god and it's to bring glory to the son of god the church amen restored back to power the church restored back to truth the church restored back to a life the church restored back to bearing fruit it has nothing to do with you being glorified it has nothing to do with proving you lazarus life had nothing to do with proving lazarus lazarus didn't raise himself from the dead jairus daughter it wasn't about jairus's daughter there was one central theme in every resurrection and every resurrection pointed to one person it pointed to the person of jesus christ and this resurrection in this day has to point to one person and one person only it has to point to the living breathing jesus christ that's among us today it's him it's not us it's him it's not church buildings it's not assemblies it's not ministers it's him that's why there's a resurrection in this day that's why it died so that he could resurrect it so that it could glorify god and manifest the son of god the reason you have power to believe in healing the reason you have power to overcome the reason your family lines up the reason your life comes in order the reason you can live morality the reason you can turn your head the reason you can hear the word the reason you're not deceived by false doctrine is for his glory and his manifestation not for yours because without him and without his purpose in your life you would be just as lost as every other human being is lost stuck in some system or worse but this resurrection in me is him and for him lazarus was a testimony of the power of god in christ every day that lazarus lived upon the earth could you imagine coming somebody coming and asking lazarus dumb questions lazarus when you were laying there dead were you praying was he responding to your prayer did you pull him toward lazarus was dead in the flesh there was nothing more he could do to save himself there was nothing he could do to help himself there was nothing he could do to change his situation can you imagine if they built a shrine to lazarus and started the church of lazarus and lazarus became the pastor because he was resurrected we all have in faith we all have got faith we go to the right church because we go to the church where lazarus was right it had nothing to do with lazarus but you see we get the same kind of thinking we see somebody very much gifted by god we see somebody with a powerful ministry or a powerful gift in their life and everybody wants to go to that church because that's where the resurrection proved christ not that vessel lazarus had nothing to do with it it wasn't lazarus you attached yourself to it was christ who rose lazarus that you attached yourself to it's not i mean i'm sure everybody appreciated lazarus i mean i would have appreciated lazarus but lazarus he had nothing to do with it his resurrected life was not by his own power his resurrected life was by the power of jesus christ amen in our resurrected life if there's anything good anywhere around any of us if there's a gift if there's an ability if there's an understanding if there's a life lived it's not us it's proof of a resurrection amen it's proof of one who has the power of resurrection in our lives we have to keep the right attitude in the right approach without the right attitude in the right approach god will let something die when it stops serving his purpose but if it has his purpose it'll live again if it's his seed his child it will live again but in order to magnify him it's got to die so that he can bring the resurrection so that this resurrection will glorify him if we get a little too big for our britches god has thousands of ways to let us die if we get a little too puffed up and a little too proud about where we are who we are associating with or what we know or the life that we live we get a little bit too proud about that god has ways to let us die he has many ways to let us come to a place where we realize who am i who am i to call myself bride who am i to be proud who am i to speak to somebody who am i to deliver who am i you know god never says moses you're a great one i'm i'm sending you he says i've come down to deliver them i'm not asking you to do anything i'm asking you to surrender to my purpose in your life and i'll do it god's not asking us friends to use our power and use our abilities he's asking us to completely surrender to his purpose that's locked in our lives and then he'll come and do the work there's anything good that's ever going to happen in this end time there's only going to be a tremendous manifestation it's going to be him proving his resurrection for his glory and the message the way back he says it takes death to produce life you've got to die to your own thinking you've got to die to your own theology you've got to die to your own self to your own human ways you've got to be regenerated a new creature a new creation before you can be them you can't be two at the same time you got to die to one in order to be born in the other saul had to die to his idea of what was right and wrong and his idea of how he could serve god and then he could be converted to paul and then he can be used for god's purpose moses had to die to his idea of a deliverer and what a deliverer was and how you deliver until he got to where he could do nothing say nothing be nothing and then god could take him and be the deliverer through him you got to die to yourself if if i'm ever going to manifest the bride of jesus christ if i'm ever going to be the bride it's going to be his bride life in me living out not my own idea of what a bride is not my own idea but it's going to be his life living through me let's look at one more scripture together before we close let's turn to luke 24. luke 24 17. this is after the resurrection in the road to emmaus the two are walking along sad and grieved verse 17 he says and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad and one of them whose name was cleopas answered and said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed in word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulcher and when they found nada's body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the women had said but they saw him not then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets had spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory you can see they're walking along distraught all and they said verse 21 but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel but we trusted it had been he that should redeem israel and they had the right idea but they had it in the wrong application and they thought they understood the word they thought they understood the prophecies they thought they could see what was coming to pass they thought they were in the right thing at the right time believing the right way but when something happened unexpected when things turned in a way that they didn't predict and all of a sudden jesus christ was crucified they saw him suffer they knew he was arrested tried beaten suffered laid in a tomb as dead amen all the sudden all their ideas they begin to have questions and now instead of saying he redeemed israel they said we trusted it had been him that redeemed israel but now we're not trusting that anymore and jesus says all fools and slow of heart to believe all you thought you knew something but you didn't know it all you thought you had it figured out but when god does something unexpected amen all of a sudden what you thought you had figured out now creates a new a doubt now you don't know we had trusted and now we don't know and they went to the sepulchre they couldn't find the body and right before them was the resurrection and they couldn't even see it because of what they thought and now jesus begins to humble them and says fools and slow of heart they're dying listen the disciples went through a death experience at calvary they died to every notion they had of what the coming kingdom was they were asking silly questions like who will sit on your eye and who will sit on your left who will be greatest among us amen they they they they you know peter declaring lord though offers say you i'll never forsake you i'm willing to die for you all of these crazy notions amen they had their own ideas and their own purposes the fact that they would ask if they could sit on the throne on his right or left hand proved that they were in this with their own purpose peter getting caught up in the argument of who's the greatest among them proves that the disciples were looking at their own purpose and as long as you have your own purpose god will let that die and friends i tell you we never had to go anything through anything like they went through i mean they were standing there watching the bread multiplied they watched the man receive his eyesight they watched the lame walk they they were with him they heard his parables they heard the stories they heard the explanation behind closed doors of the parables they knew that this was the son of god peter received a revelation from god they they were in the right thing at the right time they were chosen he said i've chosen you you haven't chosen me they were chosen in the right thing at the right time but they had their own purpose mixed in and because they had their own purpose mixed in it didn't happen according to their thinking god let all their ideas die until they scattered and ran away and hid and these two on the road to mass didn't even know what they believed anymore they got to the place where they weren't even sure about what had happened and weren't even sure they said we had trusted we trusted that it had been him but we don't even really know what we believe anymore praise be to god they were still chosen they were still the right ones in the right season but he had to resurrect his purpose in his life for his glory not for theirs let's look at john 21 john 21 verse 1 after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise showed he himself says after these things what things if you look just above in the previous chapter jesus comes and steps into the room and reveals himself as resurrected tells thomas to take his finger and touch it in his hand and thrust his hand into his side and then it says just before this verse 30 and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book but these are written that you might believe so after these things after jesus declares himself resurrected after jesus amen proves that he was the one after these things it says verse 2 they were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana and galilean the son of zebedee and two others of his disciples simon peter said unto them i go fishing after these things after they saw jesus christ resurrected after thomas had the opportunity to touch him after he threw many signs and infallible proofs declared himself to them peter has so lost his vision of being the greatest disciple peter has so lost his vision of being the warrior for the kingdom he says i go fishing what else can i do and he goes back to his humble lifestyle that he had before a fisherman when god called him from fishing to be a fisher of men and he had lived a glorious three to three and a half years of ministry with jesus christ when he saw the miraculously he practice he participated in the miraculous he declared he had declarations of revelations from the father he had all these things and after it all comes crumbling down and he dies to his own dream of being a great man in the kingdom of god to being a great person he says i go fishing he didn't know what else to do but go back in humility go back to fishing and it says peter sayeth unto them i go fishing they say unto him we go we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus then jesus saith unto them children have you any meat they answered him no and he said in them cast a net on the right side of the ship and you shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw for the multitude of fishes therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith to peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he gird his fisher coat unto him for he was naked and then cast himself into the sea he went swimming to jesus because he wanted to be where jesus was but but think about this friends peter had gone through the cycle of life and death he had gone through the transition of a dream a hope a position with christ power and manifestation and glory he shared when and he shared in jesus ministry and then at the crucifixion it all come tumbling down and in his failure and in the denying of christ he had doubts about himself he doubted his position now he's not striving for anything even though he's seen the resurrected jesus christ he goes back to fishing because god's going to take him right back to where he started so that he can start again christ came to him as a fisherman in the sea and now christ comes back to him as a fisherman in the sea because christ is going to resurrect him amen this and this resurrection is not going to be about peter in this resurrection it's going to be about christ amen he let him go through the whole cycle so that peter will wash out his own purpose until at the end of peter's life amen peter in the book of second peter he said the lord's revealed to me that my departure is at hand he's not fighting it he's not running away afraid he's not he's not scared anymore because now it's not about what peter wants it's not about his position it's not about his power now it's about god's purpose in peter i tell you sometimes god lets us run through a cycle of life and death so that he can come in resurrection power and bring us back to life peter came back to being what he was always meant to be but this time around peter's attitude was completely different peter's demeanor his approach his attitude towards other believers peter wanted to be the greatest among them peter was willing to cut off anybody's head that was against christ then when you find peter later peter now is humble and he's submissive and he's good to the brethren something changed through death and resurrection and now peter's life is not glorifying peter but peter's life is glorifying the purpose that god had in him from before the foundation of the world i say now's a good time to die surrender give up forget about ourselves get as low as we can possibly get get rid of odd notions about power and glory and position throw them all away give up any idea about being a a good believer with a great understanding in a good church and attached to a good ministry throw all that away and come and say lord who am i i'm least of the disciples like paul i'm least of the i am least of the apostles and not even worthy to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church listen let's get real we're at least of the bride and not even worthy to be called bride because of the doubts that have been expressed in our life because of the failures that we've had because the times we've gone against the word willingly after our new birth i'm bright i'm least to the bride can we get to the place where we can say i'm least of the bride and not worthy to be called his bride but by the grace of god i am what i am and now god help me not to live to my purpose in this life but help me god to die to any ambition any selfishness any of my own purpose and let me live your purpose in this life let me die to all my old ideas about what i was and my old ideas about how great i was let me die to all of that and will you resurrect your purpose in me so that you can get resurrection glory in my life amen if you serve god's purpose you will have a resurrection if you serve your own purpose god will crumple it like he did the earth in genesis 1 but he won't leave it that way because there's a purpose laying there you'll bring it back in a resurrection if god's purpose lays in your life and you serve your own purpose there's a judgment coming there's a crumpling coming there's a collapse heading your way but don't lose heart his purpose hasn't went anywhere the resurrection will come and bring you back to his purpose and then we'll go back like moses went back to egypt we'll go into we're going to the churches of asia minor like paul went to the churches of asia minor we'll live a life like brother branham lived knowing that it wasn't him that it was the one who was standing near him when these things happened and if any good thing happens it'll happen because he did it himself and let's all stand musicians if you'll come please well the member says in the identified christ of all ages he said just like it takes death to yourself to develop the picture of the image of christ the life of christ in you you have to dump your own out so that christ can come in you have to die to yourself amen if you find yourself here having the wrong idea about things and that was exposed to you now is a good time to repent and say lord i'm nothing forgive me lord for pride forgive me lord for all these foolish notions forgive me if you're here and your life has been crushed and you've been flattened and you've fallen in sin you've failed somehow and you're where you're where moses was who am i who am i to be the bride who am i to share these glory's truth who am i if you're sitting here in that position praise god realize that the resurrection is coming to you this morning to bring you back into his purpose for your life because anything that serves his purpose has a resurrection and let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you god for your power for your resurrection power lord i thank you for your love and for the work that you do in our lives lord and we just want to yield and surrender to you i pray god that you would forgive us lord for childish ideas forgive us lord for letting our own purpose dictate and guide things lord i'm sorry for that i'm sorry lord for selfishness and self-centeredness lord wash it all out of every one of us lord help us to come in humility surrendered like paul was surrendered like moses was surrendered like brother branham was till we can come to the place we can say it's not me but it's you it's christ living in me father i pray that you would wash self out of us may we surrender in a greater way and god if there's any of your children here that have been crushed lord that have had wrong notions and wrong desires going in the wrong way and you've allowed them to slip and to fall in the fall flat but lord if there's a purpose still laying in their lives i pray you'd go to them right now and that you would resurrect that purpose i pray that your spirit would begin to brood over that seed that's laying in and that you would bring them right back to that purpose like you did for peter you'd call them to be feeders of sheep to be fishers of men to be light in the darkness god we love you we know lord that it's your purpose in us that gives us a reason to be here in this end time it's your purpose in us that keeps your hand upon us it's your purpose in us that gives us revelation on the word it's your purpose in us that gives us ears to hear faith to believe god let that purpose be manifest in this day help us not to hold it back put it under a bushel hide it behind our purpose but help us lord to allow your purpose to dictate our lives we love you lord i commit these people into your hands commit myself in this congregation let us live for your purpose alone let us live a resurrected life by your power for your glory for your manifestation and may you get glory in it all we pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless your friends and sing how could he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more to them that only i pray dear lord please take my life i give it all to [Music] me [Music] could he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more within that only can see i pray dear lord please take my life i give it [Music] and granted every day [Music] if we look and watch through the bible god's run this cycle so many times he called israel out of egypt to bring him to the promised land and they were supposed to establish his worship and they were supposed to be a light and to all nations they were supposed to follow his will and follow his word and by their obedience they were supposed to be the illumination of the world but they began to serve their own purposes they began to chase after their own desires their own homes their own vineyards their own kingdoms and when they failed to keep god's word and started following after their own desire he turned them over to babylon they were dead it was a dead nation it was finished there was nothing left but his purpose wasn't done there was a prophecy that i'll bring you back into this land i'll bring you back into this land because there was still a purpose for the nation of israel and though they were dead and they had no hope and no way of rescuing themselves no hope of coming out of babylon the hope was not in their power to bring him out of babylon the hope lay in his purpose for them to bring them back to establish his kingdom again so in due time without their effort without their wisdom without their skill brought them out to build again his temple so that they could be the light to all nations that were around and when they failed again he scattered them scattered them to the four winds and that's where they are now they're gathering back now but the gathering back now is for a purpose it's for the gathering of the 144 thousand he did this in the church i mean when the first church age came out they were his they were there to illuminate the world they were to be lights in a dark world to be the light of god shining in this earth amen but they begin to follow their own purposes and set up denominations and build own church kingdoms and church systems so he let them get scattered through denominations and destroyed through the dark ages but he still had a purpose in that little church and he started bringing it back and that's why we're here today not because what did you do in the dark ages to start the reformation nothing what did you do to start the revival on azusa street in 1906 nothing what did you do to bring the message through the through the 60s nothing because he's brought it back to serve his purpose and we are here to be the illumination of the world to be the temple to be the dwelling place of god that from this nation his nation his kingdom his people the light would shine to all nations and if we ever miss that purpose in our individual lives in our lives as a church or in a ministry god will allow that to go back through the cycle of death so he can bring it back to his purpose again i'm tired of the cycle of death i'm tired of taking my own purpose and getting it crushed i just want to take his purpose lord let me shine that light let me live that word let me forsake all my own thoughts and wishes and dreams and plans and my thoughts of what's right what's wrong let me give it all up and just take this word and let it shine through this stone that's all he's ever wanted that's all he's ever wanted a people to obey him to be his light to be his dwelling place a place where he can dwell with his people to shine the light to the world and that's what he's called you and i to be in this day that's why there's a resurrection of the bride tree and that's why you're here in the final stage of the resurrection for his purpose and i say god i'm determined i'm determined with all that's in me to surrender to that purpose but all that's in me and my flesh and in my mind is not enough i need you god to come and work your purpose in my life i'll surrender everything i can surrender but i can't do it all i've got to have that life of jesus christ come into this temple to take over to shine the light so i'm surrendering myself afresh this morning saying god it's got to be your power it's got to be your spirit i can't do it if it's left to me we're going to fall in the same cycle i'm going to do what peter did i'm going to do what moses did god i can't be left up to me i surrender will you come and live your life through this tabernacle amen god bless you think on those things as you're dismissed may god just put it in our hearts so deep that this resurrection is for his glory and for his purpose and we could sing that chorus one more time brother [Music] could he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more within that only he can see i pray dear lord please take my life i give it all [Music] one [Music] there must be something more within that only i pray dear lord please take my life i give it all to you [Music] and granted every day [Music] o g the sun [Music] jesus [Music] jesus
