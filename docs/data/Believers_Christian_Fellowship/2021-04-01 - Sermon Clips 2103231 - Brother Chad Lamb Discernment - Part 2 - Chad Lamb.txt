TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what's his goal first was preeminence under man he got that in christ jesus second was preeminence in a body of believers a bride he's doing that now how he wants prisoners he wants people totally surrendered to him no will of their own no thought of their own no selfishness no other desire only desiring him he wants what he wants is he wants the right kind of bride he's never had the right kind of bride god wanted the right kind of son and he never had the right kind of son until jesus christ came along and now that son has to have the right kind of bride and that's what he's looking for in this day and that's going to be his achievement because he has already purposed that he will have upon the earth the right kind of bride and that right kind of bride will be a reflection of the character of christ because christ was in total surrender to the will of the father now the bride will be total surrender to her headship christ what are you supposed to be doing on this earth that period that is we judge everything on god's great goal and god's purpose in our life we bring everything back amen when we lose focus of what god's purpose is in our life and what god's trying to achieve in this hour we can get caught up in all kinds of nonsense and confusion but we need to step back for a minute and say what is the whole plan of god what is god trying to do in this hour what is the seventh seal what does it have to do with me and what am i supposed to do when i wake up tomorrow morning and i say for god in order to god to fulfill his purpose that he had in the back part of his mind before the foundation of the world what he wrote the whole bible for and what he typed every character in the bible did for him to have that in your life tomorrow morning will be for you to wake up in the morning and say god this is your day not mine this is your life not mine i die fresh again i lay myself on the altar i don't want my way i don't want my desire i want only yours let your word and your word only rule in my life and then we will be starting the day in the seventh seal we will be starting our day in the bible we'll be starting our day amen correctly amen
