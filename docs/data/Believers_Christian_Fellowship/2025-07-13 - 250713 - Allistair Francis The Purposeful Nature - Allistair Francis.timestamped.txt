[0:00] The original eye,
[0:02] the original seed,
[0:05] the original word
[0:08] is what I believe.
[0:10] The son of man is revealed. The seven
[0:14] seal is unveiled.
[0:17] Oh,
[0:18] the original seed.
[0:22] Well, I'm one of the few.
[0:25] One of the few. And by faith in God's
[0:29] word, I can claim it. And though the way
[0:34] may seem long and the opposition strong,
[0:38] for the bride, there's a way provided.
[0:43] If I plan to go through just to hope
[0:47] when I do, I must be firmly decided
[0:54] to follow the Lord by obeying his word
[0:59] and believe that I'm one of the few.
[1:04] Well, I'm one of the few.
[1:08] One of the few. And my faith in God's
[1:12] word I can claim it. And though the way
[1:16] may seem long and the opposition strong
[1:20] for the ride there's a way provided.
[1:25] And if I plan to go just to hope will
[1:30] not do, I must be firmly decided
[1:36] to follow the Lord. I obey his word.
[1:42] believe that I'm one of the few.
[1:47] And God has got a bride that's marching
[1:50] through this land with praises in her
[1:54] mouth,
[1:55] healing in her hand,
[1:58] everlasting joy and gladness in her
[2:01] heart. And in this bride, I've got a
[2:05] heart.
[2:07] Well, God has got a rock that's marching
[2:11] through this land with praises in her
[2:14] mouth and healing in her hand.
[2:19] Everlasting joy and gladness in her
[2:22] heart. And in this bride, I've got a
[2:26] part one more time. Well, God has got a
[2:30] brown that's marching through this land
[2:34] with praises in her mouth and healing in
[2:37] her hand.

[9:05] The sun is up
[9:09] now. I can go free.

[9:21] sound
[9:23] declaring
[9:25] my journey.
[9:27] All that I once had
[9:31] is restored to me. The price has been

[13:40] Amen. Let us bow our heads as we pray.
[13:44] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[13:47] [Music]
[13:48] Heavenly Father, how wonderful it is to
[13:51] be in your presence
[13:54] with saints of light, precious faith.
[13:57] Lord, worshiping before your holy name.
[14:01] Your name is our identification.
[14:05] Your name is our strength in this time.
[14:08] Your bride is the group of people that
[14:11] know the true name of the Lord in this
[14:14] day. And we have the authority
[14:18] by that name to speak the word in this
[14:21] time. Lord, we receive your word. We
[14:25] worship you through it. Lord, you have
[14:27] revealed the secrets of the universe to
[14:29] us. You have revealed your purpose and
[14:32] your plan for the ages for of time. You
[14:36] have revealed all things to us, Lord,
[14:38] through the name of God revealed in
[14:40] these last days. How thankful we are,
[14:43] Lord, that we are your people. How
[14:45] grateful we are, Lord, for your
[14:48] revelation that you have sent in this
[14:50] day.
[14:52] We can never thank you enough, Father
[14:54] God, for the blood of Calvary, for
[14:57] washing our sin away, for bringing us
[15:00] true repentance by your word,
[15:03] and so much more, Lord, for the word
[15:06] that you sent by a humble prophet in
[15:08] this last day, Lord.
[15:11] He spoke amidst great persecution
[15:15] and turmoil and trouble. And even to
[15:18] this day, they are blackening his
[15:21] reputation
[15:23] and speaking against the word that was
[15:25] spoken. Yet he spoke with zeal and
[15:29] fervor and great inspiration,
[15:32] not even knowing those who had come and
[15:36] received that word.
[15:38] He didn't even know us.
[15:41] He didn't even know who we would be and
[15:43] what our lives would be,
[15:45] Lord. But you put your spirit within him
[15:48] to speak the message, Lord, that has
[15:51] drawn us from all corners of the earth
[15:54] and brought us together and made us a
[15:56] family and made us friends, made us
[16:01] benefit from one another and given us
[16:04] joy and peace in our lives and
[16:06] transformed our families and took us out
[16:09] of the mess of this world.
[16:13] What a privilege it is, Lord. We are so
[16:16] thankful for the blood of Calvary and
[16:18] the message of the hour. Our lives are
[16:21] meaningless and empty without it, oh
[16:23] God. And we give you all the praise and
[16:25] the glory and the honor for it. Lord, we
[16:28] welcome you among us
[16:31] this morning.
[16:32] Lord, may you bless us today with your
[16:35] word. I'm just mortal man full of faults
[16:39] and failures and full of my own
[16:42] thoughts. Lord, I I ask you that you
[16:45] would purge my mind of all my own
[16:48] thoughts that your thoughts may be
[16:50] expressed to your people today.
[16:53] Bless the pastor and the people of this
[16:56] congregation.
[16:59] May this time that we spend together,
[17:01] Lord, be one step closer to that
[17:05] glorious translation,
[17:07] that glorious body change which this
[17:10] creature is groaning for. Father God,
[17:13] may you undertake for every need.
[17:16] Lord, we have a great task today. We
[17:20] have a a world that is teetering on the
[17:24] edge of
[17:26] destruction.
[17:28] People are succumbing to madness and
[17:32] strife and it looks like everything
[17:35] around us is they're losing their minds.
[17:38] They don't know what is reality anymore.
[17:41] It is becoming more and more difficult
[17:44] to
[17:46] get through to the spirit of man to
[17:48] change his mind about something to to
[17:51] let them see what reality and truth is.
[17:55] And yet in this time you have placed us
[18:00] Lord with your word. What can we do?
[18:04] What can we say? What can we teach that
[18:07] is so convincing that can permeate the
[18:10] hardened spirit of man? How can we
[18:13] change
[18:15] liberal and legal people,
[18:18] Lord, who have made up their minds about
[18:20] life and about marriage and about family
[18:23] and about politics and about God, about
[18:28] whether you exist or not? How can we
[18:30] change them? How can we affect them?
[18:33] Is our purpose, Lord, just to be a
[18:35] church that just keeps going on and on
[18:38] having services and song specials and
[18:41] song services and prayer meetings or is
[18:46] there something more that you want us to
[18:48] do? Is there something more that you
[18:50] have called us for? Is there something
[18:52] more that our lives are meant to
[18:55] achieve?
[18:56] Lord, we bring ourselves to you today
[18:58] willing to be instructed,
[19:02] willing to be taught, willing to be
[19:03] corrected, willing to be anointed of
[19:07] you. Lord God, we pray that you may
[19:11] bless all
[19:14] your children gathering in the different
[19:16] churches today in this country. All
[19:20] waiting to hear from you. all
[19:24] wanting to hear one word of life from
[19:26] you. We pray that you may anoint your
[19:28] bride this morning. Bless all the
[19:31] saints. Bless the saints back home
[19:34] in Durban, South Africa. Lord Jesus, may
[19:37] you be with our people as well. Father,
[19:39] we are truly thankful for you this this
[19:43] day and we ask you to be with us. Open
[19:45] up the scriptures to us. Open up your
[19:47] word. Lord, without your spirit we
[19:50] cannot understand anything and we depend
[19:52] upon you in all things. As we worship
[19:56] you now and submit and our souls bowing
[19:59] down before you, we welcome you among
[20:02] us. Speak, Lord, for we are willing to
[20:05] listen. We ask it in your precious name
[20:08] with thanksgiving and praise. Amen and
[20:11] amen.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:14] Amen. We like to greet you in the
[20:15] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[20:17] Jesus Christ.
[20:18] It's certainly good to be with you. I
[20:21] think that's what I was looking for.
[20:24] And um
[20:26] you may take your seats for a few
[20:28] minutes
[20:30] before we read the word of God. I just
[20:33] want to make sure I say all the relevant
[20:35] things.
[20:37] So, I just uh am so grateful to God to
[20:42] have this uh opportunity to be here with
[20:45] you once again and to uh share the word
[20:48] of God with you as he has um uh inspired
[20:52] us. You know, we we don't have anything
[20:54] new to say. Uh but we have something
[20:58] that God places on our heart that we can
[21:00] share with every one of you. And I know
[21:02] that each one of us has something to
[21:05] share. And that's why we're here today
[21:07] uh in this world in 2025. And God has
[21:11] anointed us. God has given us uh uh his
[21:15] word. He has anointed us with his
[21:17] spirit. He has given us revelation and
[21:19] understanding and uh we have a
[21:21] responsibility to it.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I just once again just happy to
[21:26] be here with you and good to see all of
[21:29] you again. I'm I'm thankful. Brother
[21:31] Chad told me, "You know what? You're
[21:33] part of the furniture now, so there's no
[21:36] need for me to come before you." And I
[21:39] appreciate that. Makes me feel so much
[21:41] better. Amen. So, I see a few years ago,
[21:44] it was 2022, I looked at the audience
[21:47] and I could just see faces I I didn't
[21:49] know. Now, it's all just friends. Amen.
[21:52] And I really certainly appreciate you.
[21:55] You know, it's uh it's always easier to
[21:59] preach to people who um know the word of
[22:03] God, who are well taught, people who are
[22:05] hungry for the word and um and I
[22:08] certainly appreciate your spirit and the
[22:11] worship uh always. It's really a
[22:14] blessing to me and I appreciate your
[22:16] pastor. He is a he's an inspiration
[22:20] uh not just to me but many people around
[22:22] the world and it's a it's a difficult
[22:24] time as I was praying there are many
[22:27] people in need people in the message um
[22:31] people u facing different trials you you
[22:34] you may not realize it um I must say
[22:39] Lima is a little bit of a utopia
[22:43] um I I mean if you come and live in our
[22:46] city. It's uh it's completely different.
[22:50] It's it's a rat race. It's uh so busy.
[22:54] The houses are all squashed nearby and
[22:57] uh you know it's there's crime. Uh here
[23:00] it looks like heaven.
[23:03] You're just driving through things are
[23:04] so peaceful.
[23:06] You know it's like I struggle to to find
[23:09] out how you people have desperation for
[23:11] the rapture.
[23:14] So,
[23:15] it's so calm. It's so peaceful. Time
[23:18] just goes by slowly. Uh, and the sun
[23:21] sets so late. You don't even know it's
[23:23] 9:00, it's 10:00, what's happening? And,
[23:26] uh, but with us, uh, even the birds
[23:29] remind us, go to sleep now. You know,
[23:31] it's, um, it's a different terrain and,
[23:34] uh, different, uh, places have different
[23:36] struggles and trials. I understand. And
[23:39] so, um, when I when I come here, it's
[23:42] it's always so relaxing and I certainly
[23:45] appreciate everything that you do. Um,
[23:48] so yeah, we appreciate the ministry here
[23:50] and all our friends and uh, and I
[23:53] consider you the family of God. So, the
[23:56] Lord bless you.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I want to um, let you stand
[24:02] again as we just read the word of God.
[24:06] Just want to make sure I
[24:08] I'm getting it right. Yeah.
[24:11] We're going to read from Hebrews chapter
[24:13] 9 and verse 8.
[24:17] Says, "The Holy Ghost, this signifying
[24:20] that the way into the holiest of all was
[24:24] not yet made manifest,
[24:27] while the first tabernacle was yet
[24:31] standing." I'll read it again. the Holy
[24:34] Ghost. This signifying that the way into
[24:37] the holiest of all was not yet made
[24:40] manifest. While as the first tabernacle
[24:43] was yet standing, did you ever think
[24:46] that that's what the Holy Ghost was
[24:48] signifying?
[24:51] &gt;&gt; That the way into the holiest, Did the
[24:53] Holy Ghost make it known to us that the
[24:56] way into the holiest of all was not yet
[24:58] made manifest?
[25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. while as the first tabernacle was
[25:04] yet standing. In other words, it's
[25:05] telling us
[25:07] and it's pointing to that that the Holy
[25:09] Ghost that came in our day, it was
[25:11] actual proof to us that before the Holy
[25:14] Ghost came, there was no way into the
[25:16] holiest of holies.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; That tells us what the Holy Ghost
[25:20] truthfully is.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. You may be seated.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So,
[25:30] uh, this is might terrify some of you
[25:32] for a little bit.
[25:34] I am going to take a subject called the
[25:37] Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost.
[25:40] Hold that thought. Let it digest and
[25:44] we're going to get through it. And for a
[25:46] title, the purposeful nature. Amen. So
[25:52] when we read this scripture,
[25:55] uh Paul tells us that the Holy Ghost
[25:58] coming after Christ proved to us that
[26:01] while the tabernacle of Moses was still
[26:03] in operation, the way into the holiest
[26:06] of holies was not yet revealed.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; It was not made known. There was no
[26:12] access.
[26:14] So the reason for me preaching um this
[26:17] subject this morning, you know, coming
[26:19] here, I tussled with it. I struggled
[26:23] with it right up to last night. I was
[26:26] should I shouldn't I, you know, and and
[26:29] struggling through it and putting things
[26:30] in the right places, but I just couldn't
[26:33] get it out of me because I I've I've
[26:36] preached certain things uh in the recent
[26:39] years and I spoke about in different
[26:42] places. I spoke about the Holy Ghost,
[26:44] the types of the Holy Ghost when they
[26:46] came out of Egypt and the type of the
[26:47] Holy Ghost when they went into the
[26:49] promised land and how there was a an
[26:52] infancy baptism and then a mature
[26:54] baptism and the rolling away the
[26:57] reproach of of Egypt at Gilgal and
[27:00] showing the difference between the
[27:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost in Pentecost
[27:04] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost under
[27:05] the seventh seal. And uh it you know I
[27:09] just expected people to say amen. We get
[27:13] that. And it seems like when you touch
[27:17] the Holy Ghost, it's a very sensitive
[27:19] spot for people. And um my main uh
[27:24] concern,
[27:25] well, you know, I say that it's my main
[27:27] concern. I mean, but who am I? I just
[27:30] feel like the Lord is feeling what is in
[27:34] the hearts of the people. And that's
[27:35] probably why it feels like it's my
[27:37] concern, you know. So I I keep hearing
[27:42] questions from the young people and as
[27:44] of lately from older people who I would
[27:48] have considered to have known where they
[27:50] stand uh saying, "Brother Alistister,
[27:53] how do I know I have the Holy Ghost? um
[27:57] how do I know whether
[27:59] you know whether I have the Holy Ghost
[28:02] from Pentecost or whe I had the Holy
[28:03] Ghost under the seventh seal? What am I
[28:05] supposed to be doing? Is there a
[28:07] difference? Am I supposed to be acting
[28:09] different? And so to me that is what I
[28:12] feel is something that should be um made
[28:16] clear and I I really care about the
[28:20] young people and I believe they are the
[28:21] church of tomorrow, the next generation.
[28:24] I also believe that when the word says
[28:27] we must keep his commandments, the word
[28:30] keep means to preserve, which means to
[28:34] pass it on.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how you preserve it. You
[28:37] make sure it goes to the next generation
[28:40] that it continues. Keep it for a
[28:42] perpetual covenant from for your
[28:44] children and your children's children
[28:45] and so on. So it really fails us if we
[28:50] become people who take an idea of the
[28:53] Holy Ghost given to us by Pentecost and
[28:56] then pass that down to our children and
[28:58] then we see it's ineffective.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; And then what happens is our children
[29:02] meet people, they go to youth camps,
[29:04] they go to youth meetings and we find
[29:06] there's this tradition of trying to
[29:10] force young people to get something
[29:14] &gt;&gt; and they leave more confused. or they
[29:16] keep coming back and they are forced to
[29:18] be doing the same thing again and again.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; And uh I feel like being the bride of
[29:24] the Lord Jesus Christ there needs we
[29:27] need to be the people with direction
[29:30] &gt;&gt; with understanding. We need to be the
[29:32] people who can have a solid foundation
[29:34] to say this is what it is.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; And I'm not afraid to say what it is.
[29:39] And I'm I'm not hindered by somebody
[29:41] trying to make me feel inferior or
[29:44] somebody trying to make me feel like I
[29:46] don't know what I have. And so that is
[29:49] the reason why it's so impressing on me
[29:52] to make this clear to the bride of
[29:55] Christ and to let us know because this
[29:57] is something so personal to us. The Holy
[29:59] Spirit is something so personal to us.
[30:03] When you understand who he is, what it
[30:06] is, you wouldn't you wouldn't want to
[30:08] live a second without him.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; So, knowing this that the Holy Ghost
[30:15] signified
[30:16] that before
[30:19] Christ, the way to God was not made
[30:23] manifest. Well, that's simply telling us
[30:26] something important. The Holy Ghost has
[30:28] made the way possible.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Right? That's the first thing we need to
[30:32] know.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; To do what?
[30:35] Right? So, knowing this and that it made
[30:38] the way possible, it sparks so many
[30:40] questions. Questions that stem from the
[30:43] things we were previously taught of the
[30:45] Holy Ghost and things we have been uh we
[30:48] have heard since we came into the
[30:49] message.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I believe that uh the trouble
[30:54] in this subject can can come simply from
[30:56] trying to make sense of the scriptures
[30:59] and the message and it's like if you've
[31:02] got these scriptures and the statements
[31:04] brother Baron makes in the message like
[31:06] you got these uh uh the one quote way it
[31:08] says the dynamics is the Holy Spirit and
[31:12] look where that went to
[31:14] &gt;&gt; right the mechanics is this and the
[31:15] dynamics is the Holy Spirit and people
[31:18] took that and started teaching things
[31:20] and it expanded handed into people
[31:22] trying to express what they thought the
[31:25] dynamics is.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; So I believe that the trouble comes from
[31:31] trying to make sense of the scriptures
[31:33] and the message and the statements.
[31:36] Well, that's the trouble with almost any
[31:37] subject.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Right? So we know that the prophet says
[31:42] that God interprets his own word. Now
[31:44] listen to the story. You know that,
[31:46] right? God is an interpreter of his own
[31:48] word. And there's an understanding to be
[31:50] had with this,
[31:52] &gt;&gt; right? Does this mean that we have
[31:54] nothing to say?
[31:56] That I'm just somebody who stands here
[31:58] and and like some supernatural being
[32:01] takes over me and God interprets his
[32:03] word like I'm not even conscious of what
[32:06] I'm saying or that these hand gestures
[32:09] that I keep doing are him controlling me
[32:13] that he interprets his own word. No, he
[32:16] interprets his word within us. And
[32:18] here's the amazing thing that the
[32:20] scripture says that in the mouth of two
[32:23] or three,
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; let it be established.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Why would he even do that? And it always
[32:29] worked that way. You you know the
[32:31] scripture that says where two or three
[32:33] are gathered in my name, there am I in
[32:35] their midst.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; You know what that means, right? That
[32:38] doesn't mean just because more than
[32:39] three are here that God is here. There
[32:42] are many people who are gathering in the
[32:44] name of Jesus Christ and God is not
[32:46] there.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not what it means. That
[32:48] scripture specifically means that
[32:50] anything is established as long as two
[32:53] or three in with the spirit of God agree
[32:56] on it
[32:58] &gt;&gt; right from the law right through. That's
[33:00] what it means. Let u by by the witness
[33:04] of two or three, let it be established.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Now, why would he do that?
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Why would there have to be two or three?
[33:11] What's wrong with just having one person
[33:13] who has the Holy Ghost say something and
[33:15] because the Holy Ghost said it, let it
[33:17] be established.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; Because to people there needs to be a
[33:21] witness of two or three to see that they
[33:23] are seeing the same thing. Therefore,
[33:25] they can believe it.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; And that in itself is showing us that it
[33:29] is not a foolproof way. Foolproof,
[33:32] terrible word,
[33:34] right?
[33:35] man can men can so easily get people to
[33:39] follow their own interpretation.
[33:42] So if let's look at this way. If two or
[33:44] three people agree on the wrong thing
[33:48] &gt;&gt; and say they have the Holy Ghost,
[33:50] &gt;&gt; then because the church has manipulated
[33:53] that law,
[33:54] &gt;&gt; it's established.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[33:57] &gt;&gt; This is why I say it isn't foolproof.
[33:59] And yet God instituted it that way.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Right? So the way it works is if a man
[34:06] has the Holy Ghost, then he has the
[34:08] witness in himself.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. that the word spoken by the
[34:13] preacher was interpreted by God or not.
[34:17] Which then happens to you when you hear
[34:18] the preacher speaking, you have a
[34:21] witness in yourself and you hear that
[34:23] word and you decide based on what he's
[34:26] telling you to say amen or not.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Right? So the Holy Ghost then settles
[34:33] the word in that man and makes him say
[34:36] amen to the to the confirming of the
[34:39] interpretation of the word.
[34:41] That is God being his own interpreter.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; True.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Right. Not
[34:47] &gt;&gt; and this is why we get so uh criticized
[34:51] when we say something because some
[34:54] people are going to doubt now. Is he
[34:55] saying that with the Holy Spirit? Is he
[34:58] interpreting that by himself? Is it his
[35:00] own thoughts, own interpretation? The
[35:03] only way it can be established is if you
[35:05] have the Holy Spirit and you can say
[35:08] amen to that. And then when there's more
[35:12] than one that have the Holy Spirit that
[35:14] say amen to it, then what was said is
[35:16] established.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; If a man does not have the Holy Ghost,
[35:21] it will be the opposite. Or he may
[35:23] choose to believe it and say amen based
[35:26] on his understanding because he's saying
[35:29] amen because it's a church tradition and
[35:31] he says amen because it makes sense to
[35:34] him, not necessarily that the Holy
[35:37] Spirit confirmed that. Yeah.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Do you see how precarious this is?
[35:41] &gt;&gt; How dangerous it is and how this has
[35:44] been passed down for generations? People
[35:46] saying amen because it makes sense.
[35:48] People saying amen because they like it.
[35:50] People say amen because it's convenient.
[35:53] But there needs to be this is the
[35:54] purpose or the reason why it's crucial
[35:57] that we all have the Holy Spirit
[36:00] &gt;&gt; because then things can actually be
[36:02] established
[36:04] &gt;&gt; properly established.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So true believers
[36:09] have to stay as true to the word as they
[36:12] can. And that's what we're coming to in
[36:14] this little subject. And we've got to
[36:17] believe that God will interpret his word
[36:19] within them. We literally walk around by
[36:22] faith. I greet you. I shake your hand.
[36:24] You shake my hand. You say, "God bless
[36:26] you, brother." We fellowship together.
[36:28] Sometimes we fellowship together to test
[36:30] each other, right? You know, are we on
[36:32] the same page? Do we have the same
[36:34] spirit? We're testing each other all the
[36:37] time. But it it makes fellowship so
[36:39] sweet, so beautiful when our spirits
[36:41] connect.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Do you know that um you are first a
[36:47] spiritual being before you are a
[36:48] natural? So like when you're walking
[36:51] towards somebody and uh before they even
[36:54] speak a word, before you shake hands,
[36:55] you already your spirits have already
[36:57] connected.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; As he's coming towards say, "Oh, he's
[37:01] having a bad day."
[37:03] You already know you he's not happy to
[37:06] see me right now. He'd rather not be
[37:07] here. And then you shake hands and you
[37:09] both say, "God bless you, brother,
[37:12] but your spirits are already connected
[37:15] &gt;&gt; and already communicated and your body's
[37:17] just acting out something for the sake
[37:19] of peace or something." But this is this
[37:22] is exactly what happened. So without the
[37:25] Holy Spirit between two people, there
[37:27] can never really be peace.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the other thing. It is
[37:32] the peace of God.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; All right. So, let's move on. So, when
[37:36] we look at the scriptures on the Holy
[37:38] Ghost, as we approach the subject, we
[37:40] must realize that we are stepping into
[37:42] dangerous territory. I like dangerous
[37:45] territory because I like that God can
[37:48] lead us through it.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm not afraid of it,
[37:51] especially in a day like this. But the
[37:54] carefulness that is needed is where we
[37:56] need the guide,
[37:58] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit. We also have to bear in
[37:59] mind that you know when we are speaking
[38:03] of this you know peoples of the world
[38:05] have been delving into this mystery long
[38:07] before any of us were born
[38:10] right we literally are Johnny come
[38:12] lately no offense to any Johnny's around
[38:15] &gt;&gt; right but we are literally I I didn't
[38:17] make up these phrases brother Johnny
[38:21] that's what they call did Johnny come
[38:23] lately we have just arrived yet there
[38:26] are people who have lived through the
[38:28] the the seven church ages, the time when
[38:31] the Holy Ghost poured out. Before that,
[38:33] there were the the great prophets and
[38:36] sages and they lived through this time.
[38:38] They studied it. They asked the
[38:39] questions. They wrote things. We've we
[38:42] are we are arriving here and
[38:44] piggybacking of what those people have
[38:46] been through. Yeah.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; And and sometimes it's so, you know,
[38:51] amazing for me when I when I listen to
[38:53] ministers who who stand there so
[38:55] aggressively saying this is what it is
[38:57] and there's no other way but the way I
[38:59] have said it and yet there are thousands
[39:01] of generations of people who brought it
[39:04] up for you to receive it today.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Let's be cognizant of that. Amen.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; So most ancient religions have believed
[39:13] in the spirit of God.
[39:16] Do you know that?
[39:18] &gt;&gt; And they believe the spirit of God is
[39:21] invisible like the wind.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Right? Some people believe the wind when
[39:27] it blows is the breath of God.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the beliefs come from watching
[39:34] babies being born. Why? Because a baby's
[39:37] born and he's struggling. And as soon as
[39:38] the breath comes in, they believe
[39:41] &gt;&gt; the breath of God has given him life.
[39:44] And so they literally believe it's
[39:46] breath, right? And people dying breathe
[39:50] their last breath and the and and the
[39:53] life is gone. And how babies suck in
[39:56] their first breath and how a dying
[39:58] person exhales the last one. Most
[40:01] religious people believe that it is the
[40:04] Holy Ghost in the person's spirit given
[40:07] by God entering or exiting the body. I
[40:10] think I might have told you before it
[40:12] leads to all kinds of things like when
[40:14] people sneeze and the old English
[40:17] traditions where the you know the spirit
[40:19] comes out and that's why you say bless
[40:21] you because the enemy can catch and then
[40:24] comes back in
[40:25] &gt;&gt; right you know that
[40:27] &gt;&gt; gaze
[40:29] &gt;&gt; bless you good health gaze in the German
[40:34] uh so now by uh us understanding what
[40:38] the holy spirit is we can put aside all
[40:40] the confusion about this, right? Because
[40:43] it's it's more than that.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; It signifies the entering into the
[40:47] holiest of holies.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; So all scriptures like and think of it,
[40:53] you say, "Okay, brother, th those are
[40:55] you know those are the religions of of
[40:57] other or beliefs of other religions. But
[41:00] what about us? What about Christianity?
[41:02] What about the Jews?" Yes, the Jews as
[41:03] well, right? You know from the
[41:05] scriptures, God blew into Adam's
[41:08] nostrils,
[41:09] the breath of life and man became a
[41:11] living soul or the Lord Jesus blowing on
[41:14] them and they receiving the Holy Ghost,
[41:17] right? And so I don't know if you've
[41:21] ever seen I had a cousin in South
[41:23] Africa. Uh I probably have a cousin. I
[41:26] haven't heard of her in a while.
[41:29] But they uh um they were in the they
[41:32] were denominational and in the Benihinn
[41:34] meetings that came into South Africa.
[41:36] And so Beni Hinn had this thing, you
[41:38] know, he would he the choir would be
[41:40] there and people would be there and he
[41:42] would go and they'd all fall down
[41:44] &gt;&gt; or wave his coat and they all fall down
[41:47] and would tell me he's so anointed, you
[41:49] know. But of course we know what it is.
[41:51] the first person falls down and pushes
[41:53] all the others, but they feel it's
[41:55] powerful
[41:56] &gt;&gt; and he's he his breath he's blowing. And
[41:58] then you'd have these fellows like
[42:01] Kenneth Hagen and these men would would
[42:04] uh walk through the crowds and blow on
[42:06] people and they just fall down or they
[42:08] start laughing hysterically,
[42:10] right? You probably seen more of that
[42:12] than I have. Um but this is where all
[42:15] these things come from because Christ
[42:18] blew on them and they received the Holy
[42:19] Ghost. Well, then we can blow on people
[42:21] and they receive the Holy Ghost. But
[42:24] we've never seen the prophet of the hour
[42:25] do that.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; You can see how then these scriptures
[42:30] are so misinterpreted.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; And be careful people when you start
[42:35] seeing people in the message start
[42:37] taking on these dangerous things that
[42:39] have got zero to do with what the Holy
[42:41] Ghost really is.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So by that statement you can
[42:47] gather that it is important to
[42:49] understand that the understand the
[42:51] godhead to fully understand the Holy
[42:54] Ghost. We will incorporate this into
[42:55] what we're going to be touching on
[42:57] today. Blowing upon people no that's not
[43:01] it. That's not what brings the Holy
[43:03] Ghost. So probably the most important
[43:06] answer on the Holy Ghost that people are
[43:09] looking for today is
[43:12] brother how are we supposed to receive
[43:14] it?
[43:16] Right? And the other question um that
[43:19] people are asking and looking for an
[43:22] answer is how do I know that I have it?
[43:26] Right? So many people don't want to
[43:29] spend the time knowing what it is. They
[43:32] just want to get it and be done with it
[43:34] and receive all the benefits and proceed
[43:36] further. Right? And it doesn't work like
[43:39] that. Then many people have convinced
[43:42] themselves that they have it based that
[43:45] I have the Holy Ghost, brother. I know I
[43:47] have the Holy Ghost. And how do you
[43:48] know? Because I had an experience.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; You've heard that too.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; And uh then later things happen and then
[43:56] they doubt whether they had the
[43:57] experience.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Or what experience it was. So let's
[44:02] consider what the prophet says and to me
[44:04] this is my favorite quote on the Holy
[44:07] Ghost on receiving the Holy Ghost. Uh I
[44:10] remember as a young minister this I I
[44:12] don't know how many colors I I uh uh
[44:16] mocked this with and memorized it and
[44:19] every time I spoke about it this is the
[44:22] most important one. It's on I think it's
[44:24] page six paragraph 22. Are you with us?
[44:27] Amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Upon this place we wish to approach the
[44:30] subject which I think is the outstanding
[44:33] subject of today of the what is the Holy
[44:37] Spirit? What is it? And now the reason
[44:40] I've taken the subject in line like this
[44:42] you cannot come are you listening? You
[44:45] cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit
[44:47] unless you know what it is.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; First requirement.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; And you cannot receive it if you know
[44:55] what it is.
[44:57] unless you believe it's given to you and
[45:00] it's for you.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; And then number three, you cannot know
[45:06] whether you've got it or not unless you
[45:09] know what results it brings.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; And this is my favorite statement. So if
[45:15] you know what it is and who it's to and
[45:18] what action it brings when it comes,
[45:20] then you know what you've got when you
[45:22] get it.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. There it is. That's just would
[45:27] settle it. And it's like, it's like the
[45:29] prophet says, it's like, "Yeah, now we
[45:31] can close up and go home."
[45:34] Right? If you know what it is, you
[45:37] believe it's given to you and it's for
[45:39] you, and you know what results it
[45:41] brings, then you know what you've got
[45:43] when you get it.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we need to break that downise.
[45:47] And of course, the problem is when
[45:50] people believe uh and today when it's
[45:52] taught to people that this is what the
[45:54] Holy Ghost is, they teach what it was.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; And then the results they want is what
[46:02] it used to bring.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; So, we are going to base this entire
[46:10] study on this little bit of advice from
[46:12] the prophet. What is the Holy Ghost?
[46:14] Believe that it's given for me. believe
[46:16] that it's for me. This is a very
[46:19] important state that it's for me. I am
[46:22] not Peter
[46:24] from 2,000 years ago.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; I'm not a fisherman.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not someone who doesn't have the
[46:31] message of the hour.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; So, what is it for me?
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you want to really get a
[46:42] full understanding, you have to explore
[46:43] the scriptures and the message to
[46:45] fulfill these four things. I just want
[46:47] to highlight some important things. Do
[46:49] you love the scripture?
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Do you love Bible study?
[46:51] &gt;&gt; I love it. It's like, you know, I rub my
[46:54] hands together, settle myself in my
[46:55] seat, and start enjoying it and gets the
[46:59] gastric juices flowing and
[47:01] &gt;&gt; digestion and everything happening.
[47:02] Amen. Spiritually, of course.
[47:05] So I want to highlight some important
[47:06] things that may add more light to the
[47:09] question. What is the Holy Ghost? And
[47:11] brother Baron preached a message on it
[47:12] which I believe many of you have read
[47:14] and if you haven't you must read it.
[47:16] What is the Holy Ghost? And in there he
[47:19] covers things that a well-traought
[47:20] Christian or a Pentecostal would
[47:23] understand.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Someone from the Pentecostal age and and
[47:26] a Pentecostal would read that message.
[47:27] What is the Holy Ghost to say? Yeah, I
[47:30] agree with everything. It's it sounds
[47:32] right round about what we believe. But
[47:35] we are not a part of the Pentecostal age
[47:38] &gt;&gt; and you shouldn't take it for granted
[47:40] that everyone is well and sufficiently
[47:42] taught on it. Right? You owe it to
[47:45] yourself to take it slow and search
[47:47] through the word. You love him saints.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. So coming back to religions of the
[47:53] earth, we must admit then when we think
[47:56] of the Holy Spirit now I'm going to
[47:57] start talking about it and and then uh I
[48:01] don't want you to get confused. I want
[48:02] you to stay with me. the Holy Spirit and
[48:05] the Holy Ghost, right? I'm speaking of
[48:07] it as if they are two different things
[48:10] &gt;&gt; for a reason. And so, we have a
[48:13] preconceived idea of it and yet we don't
[48:15] know where it came from. We just read in
[48:18] the Bible, Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost, and
[48:20] we got so used to it because we're
[48:22] Christians and because we're message
[48:23] believers, we don't take long enough to
[48:25] consider they were written that way for
[48:29] a specific reason by people over a
[48:32] thousand years ago who thought it's
[48:34] significant to write it differently.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Right? So there are basically a few
[48:42] Abrahamic religions as the world calls
[48:44] it. The big three are Judaism,
[48:47] Christianity and Islam. Then there's
[48:49] also bahayism and to a certain extent
[48:53] babism that are offshoots of Islam and
[48:56] that are sort of draw also from Judaism.
[48:59] Right? Have you heard of those? Mostly
[49:01] uh they are mixed with pagan beliefs of
[49:04] Persia and Africa. The basis of these
[49:07] religions is this that there is one God
[49:11] who revealed his name Yahweh to Abraham.
[49:16] Amen. And uh or Abraham's people and
[49:19] they all believe in prophets and the
[49:22] constant belief is that the Holy Spirit
[49:26] is what God put on the prophets.
[49:30] They believe this long before the Holy
[49:32] Ghost came to us, right? long before
[49:35] they believed that when a prophet came,
[49:38] it was the spirit of God upon the
[49:41] prophet.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. What What am I saying to you? This
[49:44] is a belief that the Jews had. This is a
[49:47] belief that Christians had. This is a
[49:49] belief that Islam has.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Right? This is a belief that uh these
[49:54] bahayas people, Bahayism and Babism also
[49:58] have. Now looking at that alone, is it
[50:01] not similar to what we believe and why
[50:03] we can so easily accept that God spoke
[50:06] through brother Brandham? Because God's
[50:09] spirit was in him.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; You're basically believing the same
[50:13] thing as other people, other religions.
[50:15] He's got this. I know if you if you um
[50:18] ever meet Hindu people and if you've
[50:20] ever seen what they call the trance and
[50:22] where they stick hooks in them and pull
[50:25] carriages and when that person gets the
[50:27] trance and and they believe they will
[50:30] tell you he's got the god on him. He's
[50:33] got the spirit of the god on him. To be
[50:35] able to do that, it has to take the
[50:38] spirit of the god to be on him. All
[50:40] right. So I want to show you this
[50:41] scripture from Numbers 11 29. And Moses
[50:46] said unto him, "Envest thou for my sake?
[50:50] Would God that all the Lord's people
[50:52] were prophets and that the Lord would
[50:55] put his spirit upon them?"
[50:58] You know, it's not in my notes, but it's
[51:00] it's quite significant. He didn't say
[51:04] the Lord will put his spirit upon the
[51:06] people and make them prophets.
[51:09] He said
[51:11] would to God that all the Lord's people
[51:14] were prophets and that the Lord would
[51:16] put his spirit upon them.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; You can be a prophet without the spirit
[51:19] of the Lord because a prophet is a gift,
[51:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:23] &gt;&gt; But it's he's pointing out for some
[51:25] reason is is an accepted thing of uh to
[51:28] earth's people from the old days that
[51:31] the spirit of God could come upon man.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:36] from that. I just want to take that
[51:37] point that the Lord would put his spirit
[51:41] upon them. Can you see how far back the
[51:43] book of numbers
[51:45] &gt;&gt; we have a scripture that that confirms
[51:47] to us that God can put his spirit upon
[51:50] man,
[51:52] &gt;&gt; right? That's our foundation. And
[51:55] brother Maram is absolutely correct in
[51:57] that it is so easy to confuse the
[52:00] actions of the Holy Spirit
[52:02] &gt;&gt; because how do you know whether it is
[52:04] the spirit of God upon them? They're
[52:06] prophets. There are prophets. There is a
[52:08] prophet like Balum who brother Bam said
[52:11] was a true prophet
[52:13] &gt;&gt; because when he prophesied what he
[52:15] prophesied came true
[52:17] &gt;&gt; was a true prophet.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; But it was also a false prophet.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is why with the with the
[52:26] gift of prophecy, you can have someone
[52:28] with the gift of prophecy and they may
[52:29] not have the spirit of God on them.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; So the only sort of proof we have of
[52:36] this is where the Bible speaks
[52:37] specifically of the Holy Spirit and the
[52:40] Holy Ghost. The the four the scriptures
[52:42] we are going to go through um for now we
[52:44] we we want to glance at them. We want to
[52:46] draw a few conclusions and we want to
[52:48] discuss this. So where this uh came from
[52:52] for me was um many years ago, I would
[52:55] say over 10 years ago, I had a young
[52:57] person who who asked me the question,
[53:00] brother Al, is the is the Holy Spirit
[53:02] and the Holy Ghost the same? And I
[53:03] thought, wow, I never thought about
[53:06] that. Uh because just like any normal
[53:09] message believer, I brother Brandham
[53:11] uses it interchangeably,
[53:14] you know, and uh I just assume they
[53:16] yeah, they are the same. But obviously
[53:18] the reason there's something in this
[53:20] person's heart that that they were
[53:21] looking for and I take questions very
[53:23] seriously. So I said you know let me go
[53:26] and studied and of course I came back
[53:27] with an answer that nobody really likes.
[53:31] The you know I said the truth is they
[53:33] are the same and yet not the same. And
[53:37] you know message believers be like dear
[53:39] Lord can't anything in the word just be
[53:41] straightforward just for once you know.
[53:44] So let's just get this straight from the
[53:47] outset.
[53:48] Things are only that complicated because
[53:51] of what man does,
[53:53] &gt;&gt; right? It's complicated because the
[53:56] scriptures were written in Hebrew and
[53:57] Chaldian and Aramaic or coin Greek and
[54:01] and then it was translated into English
[54:03] and here we are and you don't even speak
[54:05] English, you speak American, you know,
[54:08] and then you're you're trying to uh
[54:11] translate it from the English, you're
[54:13] trying to translate it from you're
[54:14] trying to understand different
[54:15] interpretations, you know, and and so it
[54:19] how do we know we are speaking exactly
[54:22] what was written without the Holy Holy
[54:23] Spirit, how are we ever going to get the
[54:26] correct interpretation?
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So things are only complicated
[54:31] because of what man has done. God did
[54:34] not complicate anything.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; So what we are doing is undoing what has
[54:39] been misinterpreted.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to do. What has been
[54:44] misplaced and dislocated for many, many
[54:46] years. So how is the Holy Spirit and the
[54:49] Holy Ghost the same and yet not the
[54:52] same? Some of you will be saying,
[54:53] "Brother Alistister, you're just making
[54:55] things up. You're not saying what
[54:56] Brother Baron says. Stop it." Okay, let
[55:00] me give you an idea. You all ready for
[55:02] this?
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. Is the father and the son the
[55:06] same?
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Now, if you There's a scripture that
[55:13] says, "He that hath the father hath the
[55:15] son also."
[55:17] &gt;&gt; He that loveth the father loveth the son
[55:19] also.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Is the father and the son the same?
[55:21] There's my answer. Yes and no.
[55:25] Right? Like a good extrinitarian, you
[55:28] will say, "But hold on, brother Al.
[55:30] Those are two different attributes." You
[55:32] know, one is an attribute of father,
[55:34] attribute of son. I can see you being
[55:36] through message university
[55:38] with the Holy Ghost. Brother Al, you're
[55:40] talking about the same thing. The Holy
[55:41] Ghost and the Holy Spirit. It's not a
[55:43] different person in the Godhead. It's
[55:44] the same thing, just different words.
[55:47] Okay. Uh same person. Okay. Uh, is the
[55:51] word and Jesus the same?
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Yes and no.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Because before he was Jesus, he was the
[55:59] word. And when he was the word, he was
[56:01] not known as Jesus. He became the word
[56:04] made flesh. And that's when the word was
[56:06] known as Jesus.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Right? And right now, we have Jesus as
[56:11] the word living within us.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; But it's not Jesus in the flesh from
[56:15] 2,000 years ago literally inhabiting my
[56:18] being.
[56:20] And then I am becoming him.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; And yet my name is Alistister.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; So am I Jesus made flesh? Yes. Am I
[56:29] Jesus? Yes and no.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; See uh you can glorify God in me but you
[56:38] can't glorify me.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; You can worship God in me but you can't
[56:42] worship me.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Right? And Jesus himself says I I come
[56:46] to do the works of my father. Do not
[56:49] judge me for anything else but for those
[56:50] works sake. If you seen me, you seen the
[56:53] father. And then he says, glorify God.
[56:56] That's right.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; So how how about that? Jesus came and he
[57:05] was the word. But before Jesus came, the
[57:07] word was not known as Jesus. In the same
[57:10] way, before it was called the Holy
[57:13] Ghost, it was called the Holy Spirit.
[57:17] That's right.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; All we need to do is understand what the
[57:20] difference is.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; It is the same and it is not the same.
[57:24] Why did the writers write it
[57:26] differently? So what makes it the same
[57:28] and not the same?
[57:29] &gt;&gt; The manifestation.
[57:32] That's all the manifestation of the word
[57:35] in Abraham's day. The manifestation of
[57:37] the word in Jesus Christ. Different
[57:40] manifestation.
[57:41] Amen. That's all that happened. So let's
[57:44] let's understand let's look at the
[57:45] manifestations. If you really want to
[57:47] know what it is, you have to study the
[57:49] manifestations from the beginning all
[57:51] the way through to the end to understand
[57:54] what this really is. So, let's make a
[57:56] few important observations. Are you
[57:57] still with me?
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; The phrase Holy Spirit only occurs in
[58:03] the Bible seven times. Three times in
[58:06] the Old Testament, four times in the New
[58:08] Testament. The the phrase Holy Ghost
[58:11] appears 89 times in the Bible and never
[58:15] in the Old Testament.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Spirit of God appears 26 times in the
[58:22] Bible, 14 times in the Old Testament,
[58:25] and 12 times in the New Testament. So
[58:28] these men who were inspired by the same
[58:32] Holy Ghost
[58:34] wrote it differently. If it was all the
[58:37] same, why not just use Holy Ghost from
[58:39] the beginning? Why not just use Holy
[58:42] Spirit throughout? Why make a
[58:44] differentiation?
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Right? What is the point of these
[58:49] observations? Maybe it's just the way
[58:50] the interpreters of the original script
[58:53] chose to print it. That would be true,
[58:55] but for a few exceptions. So, I want to
[58:57] show you this. John 7 and verse 39 says,
[59:00] "But this spake he of the spirit which
[59:03] they believe on him should receive. They
[59:05] that believe in him should receive for
[59:07] the Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[59:10] that Jesus was not yet glorified.
[59:13] Right? Now you know the religious
[59:15] message people would say just say what
[59:17] it says. But what does it mean right?
[59:21] Anyone with a brain will tell you it's
[59:23] basically saying the Holy Ghost was not
[59:25] yet given until Jesus was glorified.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; So it's telling you the Holy Ghost came
[59:30] after Jesus.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:35] At first, this lets us know the Holy
[59:37] Ghost only came after Jesus.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And the the people who are interpreting
[59:43] it into English, this the reason they
[59:45] chose to write Holy Ghost after Jesus.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; There's a scripture telling us that
[59:51] because that Jesus was not yet
[59:52] glorified. The Holy Ghost was not yet
[59:54] given. So what did David have?
[59:59] &gt;&gt; What did Moses have? What did Jonah
[1:00:02] have? What did all those men of the Old
[1:00:04] Testament? Did they not have the Holy
[1:00:06] Ghost?
[1:00:09] Right? Let's go to Psalm 51:1.
[1:00:13] This is David, the one we were just
[1:00:14] talking about. He says, "Cast me not
[1:00:15] away from thy presence and take not thy
[1:00:18] Holy Spirit from me." So for those
[1:00:21] people who said, "Well, the Holy Ghost
[1:00:22] was not yet given." So that's why David
[1:00:25] and all of them did not have the Holy
[1:00:26] Ghost, right? So what did they have? And
[1:00:30] here we have a scripture telling us that
[1:00:31] David had something
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; because he's saying don't take it from
[1:00:36] me.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Meaning he had it
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; and listen this is happening after he
[1:00:41] committed adultery.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; The reason I'm saying this is because we
[1:00:47] have other interpretations of the Holy
[1:00:50] Spirit like saying if you have mistakes
[1:00:52] you don't have the Holy Spirit.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; The man had he committed adultery and
[1:00:57] he's saying don't take the Holy Spirit
[1:00:58] from me. Yeah,
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; he committed adultery. He was made he
[1:01:03] the the prophet made him know he was a
[1:01:06] sinner. He was a murderer and he was an
[1:01:07] adulterer. And he's not saying, "I've
[1:01:10] lost the Holy Ghost. I've lost the Holy
[1:01:11] Spirit." He said, "Don't take it from
[1:01:13] me."
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; So, we judge one another by the mistakes
[1:01:19] we make. And we say, "Well, if you had
[1:01:21] the Holy Spirit, you won't do that. If
[1:01:23] you have the Holy Ghost, you wouldn't
[1:01:25] have done that. You The Holy Spirit has
[1:01:27] got nothing to do with that. All right.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; That's what we need to understand.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, here David speaks as if the
[1:01:37] Holy Spirit was with him. If you're
[1:01:39] confused a little bit or you pushing
[1:01:41] back a little bit, just wait on. We're
[1:01:43] going to enjoy this journey together.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Believe me.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; So, what did David have if the Holy
[1:01:49] Ghost was not yet given? Right. Mark 12.
[1:01:53] For David himself, now we've got in
[1:01:55] Mark, it's translated into English and
[1:01:58] it's speaking about David. For for David
[1:02:00] himself said by the Holy Ghost,
[1:02:05] the Lord said to my Lord, "Sit thou at
[1:02:06] my right hand till I make thine enemies
[1:02:08] thy foottool."
[1:02:10] Oh,
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; right. First, the Holy Ghost was not yet
[1:02:15] given until Jesus was glorified. Now,
[1:02:17] we're saying David was speaking by the
[1:02:20] Holy Ghost.
[1:02:23] Amen. I love it when it gets more
[1:02:25] confusing
[1:02:27] because then we know it's a real
[1:02:28] revelation to us. Amen.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; So, David says this by the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:33] How could how could it not have been
[1:02:35] given them? Isaiah 63:10
[1:02:38] um and 11, but they rebelled and vexed
[1:02:41] his holy spirit. Therefore, he was
[1:02:43] turned to be their enemy. He fought
[1:02:46] against them. This is speaking of the
[1:02:47] Holy Spirit with the nation of Israel.
[1:02:50] And verse 11 says, "Then he remembered
[1:02:52] the days of Moses of old Moses and his
[1:02:55] people, saying, "Where is he that bought
[1:02:58] uh brought them out of the sea uh with
[1:03:02] the shepherd of his flock? Where is he
[1:03:04] that put his holy spirit within him?"
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; So what we have is it looks like the
[1:03:10] Holy Spirit was within Moses
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; as the Holy Spirit was within David,
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; right? So did the Old Testament saints
[1:03:19] have the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost?
[1:03:22] Because we see that we see the words
[1:03:24] Holy Spirit in the Old Testament, but we
[1:03:26] see the Holy Ghost only in the New
[1:03:28] Testament. Right? If it was the same,
[1:03:31] you say, "No, brother, it's the same."
[1:03:33] And you have all the, you know, the
[1:03:35] people uh who are who get zealous about
[1:03:37] it and who believe that if they shout
[1:03:39] louder and scream louder and faint
[1:03:41] harder, then they have it, you know. No,
[1:03:44] it's the same. It's the same. Okay. So
[1:03:47] why did the Old Testament saints not
[1:03:49] speak with tongues
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; and get slain in the spirit
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; or have healing campaigns and jump
[1:03:56] around and scream and shout and have
[1:03:57] church?
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Why do they act so different? Why were
[1:04:02] there no altar calls in Moses day? Why
[1:04:05] do they not go out and same Holy Spirit
[1:04:08] you say? Why do they not act the same?
[1:04:11] Why do we want to make or define the
[1:04:13] Holy Ghost of this day only as this?
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Right? Why do they have to be the same
[1:04:20] Holy Spirit inspire them to be deathly
[1:04:23] silent in the tabernacle? Speak one word
[1:04:25] and you die.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Now you can shout, scream, and hip hip
[1:04:30] hooray and run around screaming and act
[1:04:32] all disorderly and claim to have the
[1:04:34] Holy Spirit. But in the Old Testament,
[1:04:37] you try that. You wouldn't even make it
[1:04:40] one foot forward. You'd be dead.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Same Holy Spirit.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; So, was it the Holy Spirit in the
[1:04:48] saints, on the saints, or not? What is
[1:04:51] the difference? Amen. You see, when you
[1:04:54] look at it and you ask questions, you
[1:04:56] start to see it. Why? Because the
[1:04:58] answers are in your heart. Amen. So even
[1:05:01] in the New Testament, it speaks as if
[1:05:03] God was still going to give the Holy
[1:05:06] Spirit to the New Testament people,
[1:05:08] right? Let's go to Luke 11:13.
[1:05:12] If you then being evil know how to give
[1:05:16] good gifts unto your children, how much
[1:05:19] more shall your heavenly father give the
[1:05:21] Holy Spirit to them that ask him? So it
[1:05:25] looks like God is willing to give the
[1:05:27] Holy Spirit to the New Testament saints.
[1:05:30] Right? Ephesians 1:13 says, "In whom you
[1:05:33] also trusted, after that you heard the
[1:05:35] word of truth, the gospel of your
[1:05:36] salvation, in whom also after that you
[1:05:39] believed, you were sealed with that Holy
[1:05:41] Spirit of promise."
[1:05:44] Now, we're seeing it in the New
[1:05:46] Testament. It's not just um we see this
[1:05:48] in Luke 11 and also in Ephesians which
[1:05:52] is after Christ is glorified. We see the
[1:05:55] promise that he wants to give his holy
[1:05:58] spirit to the Gentiles.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Clearly the Gentiles did not have the
[1:06:04] Holy Spirit. Now we thought that a lot
[1:06:08] of people say the Holy Ghost sealed us,
[1:06:11] right? And here the scriptures say you
[1:06:13] are sealed by the Holy Spirit of God
[1:06:15] till the day of your redemption. There's
[1:06:17] a significant difference there and we're
[1:06:18] going to talk about that too, right? 1
[1:06:21] Thessalonians 4:8, he therefore that
[1:06:24] despiseth despiseth not man, but God who
[1:06:28] hath also given unto us his holy spirit.
[1:06:32] Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Do you have the Holy Spirit or not? How
[1:06:37] do you know?
[1:06:38] So yet again, it seems like the two are
[1:06:41] the same. Yet there are scriptures that
[1:06:43] said the Holy Ghost is not given before
[1:06:45] Christ. How can that be if some whole
[1:06:48] Old Testament saints also had the Holy
[1:06:50] Ghost? Right? Look at this one. Also
[1:06:54] another scripture that speaks about uh
[1:06:56] something that happened before Christ
[1:06:59] was glorified. Are you still with me?
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Matthew 1:18. Now the birth of Jesus
[1:07:04] Christ was on this wise when as his
[1:07:06] mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[1:07:08] before they came together she was found
[1:07:10] with child of the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; This is before Acts chapter 2. You can
[1:07:18] so easily say well look Mary had the
[1:07:20] Holy Ghost. It doesn't say that. It says
[1:07:22] she was found with child of the Holy
[1:07:24] Ghost.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Right? So you agree there's a lot we
[1:07:28] need to understand. Let's not take it
[1:07:30] for granted. If you know what it is, if
[1:07:32] you believe what it or that it's given
[1:07:34] for you and it is for you and you know
[1:07:36] what results it brings, then you know
[1:07:38] what you got when you get it.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; So Mary was obviously before Christ came
[1:07:45] uh and she received the Holy Ghost to
[1:07:47] conceive Christ.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, she could not
[1:07:53] conceive Christ.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was necessary for her to
[1:07:56] conceive.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; These are all these little beautiful
[1:07:59] clues. So we could debate many uh about
[1:08:02] many things uh but the simplicity of it
[1:08:05] is the father is a spirit.
[1:08:09] What does it even mean? The father is
[1:08:11] not a separate person. The father is a
[1:08:13] word that describes a relationship of
[1:08:15] God to man before Christ came.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Right? So is the father not a holy
[1:08:22] spirit?
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Look at our understanding. We're saying
[1:08:25] what is a holy spirit to you and I? Holy
[1:08:28] means he's got no sin. There's no dirt.
[1:08:32] There's no filth. There's no uh shame.
[1:08:35] There's no guilt. He's holy. He's pious.
[1:08:38] He's uh No, that's not what it is,
[1:08:42] right? Holy Spirit. So, the Holy Spirit
[1:08:46] or Holy Ghost is always about God's
[1:08:50] spirit upon or in man.
[1:08:56] The Holy Spirit has got to do with man.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; The father is spirit. Yes. What's the
[1:09:03] difference between father and holy
[1:09:04] spirit? The holy spirit has got to do
[1:09:07] with man.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; The Jewish Bible uses the word spirit.
[1:09:12] And you you may have heard this. The
[1:09:14] word ru. Have you heard that? Which
[1:09:17] means breath or wind. Do you know the
[1:09:20] word ghost is in the old testament?
[1:09:24] And Abraham gave up the ghost
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; and that's in the in the Hebrew. It's a
[1:09:29] completely different to which is spirit.
[1:09:32] Two separate words. One is ghost, one is
[1:09:35] spirit. Starts giving us more clues,
[1:09:37] right? So in the Greek, which is now the
[1:09:40] New Testament, they didn't have this
[1:09:43] word ghost, which is English. It comes
[1:09:45] from the German word ghast g a s t which
[1:09:50] eventually came to be ghost. But then
[1:09:53] what is a ghost,
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; right? Why would they use the word
[1:10:00] ghost?
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Apparently ghost is the spirit of
[1:10:04] someone who has died.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Which is made visible.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; I saw the spirit. It was a ghost.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; So the spirit is invisible. But when
[1:10:19] it's visible, it's ghost. That's right.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; They had some reasoning behind what they
[1:10:26] were writing.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; They were not silly men. I tell you
[1:10:29] that.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Right. So, it's the same thing, but not
[1:10:33] the same. There it is. We just have to
[1:10:36] understand what the meaning was. Right?
[1:10:38] So, uh ghast in the old English means a
[1:10:41] spirit that can physically be seen.
[1:10:44] Like, well, you know, people will say,
[1:10:45] "What's the matter with you? You look
[1:10:47] like you saw a ghost."
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; You've heard that. You look like you've
[1:10:50] seen a ghost. Uh, and in the old English
[1:10:53] there would be the word apparition.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; You saw something. Something that should
[1:10:57] have been invisible became visible to
[1:10:59] you.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; So basically, it's so simple. It has
[1:11:05] much more to do with the change in
[1:11:06] dispensation because what it was showing
[1:11:09] was that the spirit of God, the spirit
[1:11:12] of Christ was becoming visible upon the
[1:11:15] people
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; and they called that the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Because they began to see his spirit
[1:11:20] becoming visible. How? Because they know
[1:11:23] what these men were doing was not their
[1:11:26] own spirit.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of Christ coming upon
[1:11:30] them and they called it the ghost.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the change in dispensation
[1:11:36] brought forth change in manifestations
[1:11:39] of the same spirit.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So under the ages of the
[1:11:44] father from Adam right up to the
[1:11:47] conception of Christ for 4,000 years
[1:11:50] God's spirit upon men upon men anointing
[1:11:54] them being in them were only for
[1:11:58] prophets priests kings and judges
[1:12:02] not for all the public
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; like you could see when Hannah was
[1:12:05] standing in the temple and she was she
[1:12:07] was whispering and and praying and Eli
[1:12:09] comes up to her and says what are you
[1:12:10] mad What are you doing? You know this is
[1:12:13] not allowed. Only we are supposed to
[1:12:16] speak to God, not you. You have no
[1:12:18] authority. And then she had to explain
[1:12:20] herself and he understood and and you
[1:12:23] can't be here in the temple doing this.
[1:12:24] You literally asked her, "Are you
[1:12:26] drunk?"
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Because only a drunk person would have
[1:12:29] the guts to do something like what
[1:12:31] you're doing right now. You must be out
[1:12:33] of your mind. Can you imagine that? You
[1:12:35] and I stand here and whisper and pray
[1:12:37] and there's no problem with that. At
[1:12:39] that time, the Holy Spirit was seen as
[1:12:42] something specifically for prophets,
[1:12:44] priests, judges, and kings, men chosen
[1:12:47] by God.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Not for the public.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And what happened with the Holy Spirit?
[1:12:53] Now, think of the same Holy Spirit
[1:12:55] that's on you on the Holy Spirit on
[1:12:59] those Old Testament saints. You know
[1:13:01] what they did with that spirit?
[1:13:03] It anointed them to do miraculous work.
[1:13:06] and they identified a fearsome God,
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; right? If for example, Moses brings 10
[1:13:15] plagues that decimates an entire nation
[1:13:17] of of Egypt,
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; kills the firstborn by the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Pillars of fire, Jericho's walls
[1:13:25] falling, son standing still, Mary's body
[1:13:29] receiving the blood cell. All those
[1:13:31] things leading up to that time, they
[1:13:33] were given abilities to kill their
[1:13:35] enemies and even their brothers who went
[1:13:39] into error. Same Holy Spirit.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Remember Finance when one of the his
[1:13:46] brothers took uh a Medidionite woman, he
[1:13:48] took a javelin and ran him through.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; How many of you feel like running a
[1:13:52] javelin through your brother who makes a
[1:13:54] mistake?
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; You have the same Holy Spirit. Not
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; what what is the difference?
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Something has changed in the
[1:14:03] dispensation. In the Old Testament, the
[1:14:06] greatness of the manifestations was seen
[1:14:08] in ways that is unmistakably not man's
[1:14:12] works. It was the Holy Spirit because we
[1:14:15] can identify that it was God's works.
[1:14:18] Only God could have done that.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Inspire them to do that. Right. Great
[1:14:23] manifestations. They knew that man was
[1:14:25] not bringing the plagues. Yeah,
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; God was the one speaking through Moses.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; It was God's spirit in Moses. They knew
[1:14:33] that. And and so um they had abilities
[1:14:36] that today we just don't do. I mean, my
[1:14:40] my little boy asked me a month ago or
[1:14:43] something. He says, "So why don't
[1:14:47] why don't you do things why don't those
[1:14:49] great things happen today like opening
[1:14:51] the Red Sea and you know, why don't you
[1:14:54] have all these great things? you I mean
[1:14:56] it's like you could open the sea and
[1:14:57] walk all the way to brother Chad's
[1:14:59] church you know why don't you do that
[1:15:02] why do you have to uh fly why why why do
[1:15:06] you not do things like they did in those
[1:15:08] days
[1:15:10] can make a father feel really
[1:15:11] insignificant
[1:15:13] and be a preacher of God right in the
[1:15:17] New Testament then Jesus comes and says
[1:15:20] I forgive you they're beating him
[1:15:23] they're cursing at him they're spitting
[1:15:24] on him and it says Father, forgive them.
[1:15:26] They know not what they do. Same Holy
[1:15:28] Spirit sir
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; that would drive a javelin through a
[1:15:31] man, kill, decimate a nation, uh bring
[1:15:36] plagues upon people, bring suffering,
[1:15:38] suddenly it flips. Same Holy Spirit and
[1:15:41] it's just forgiveness and grace.
[1:15:47] What changed? Okay, this showing that it
[1:15:50] was not just an invisible spirit.
[1:15:53] Peter's shadow healed people.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Laying on hands uh laying on of hands
[1:16:00] healed people. Men's voices seemed to
[1:16:03] raise the dead.
[1:16:06] To the people, this was a ghost. An
[1:16:09] invisible spirit made visible in normal
[1:16:12] men of even low degree or even
[1:16:16] insignificant status of life. Because
[1:16:18] after Jesus, the Holy Ghost fell upon
[1:16:21] all
[1:16:22] Amen.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Not just prophets, priests, judges, and
[1:16:25] kings.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Now it fell upon all flesh. Significant
[1:16:29] difference.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; The writers were saying this is the Holy
[1:16:32] Ghost.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between this one
[1:16:35] and the manifestation of the Old
[1:16:37] Testament.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Old Testament writers
[1:16:41] believe this anointing on men uh to be
[1:16:44] the actual breath of God or an invisible
[1:16:48] moving force. They call it the ru
[1:16:50] hakodesh in the Hebrew. And this is why
[1:16:53] the English translators chose to
[1:16:55] identify it as the holy spirit because
[1:16:58] the English translators interpreted
[1:17:00] spirit as breath. Right? For example, a
[1:17:04] dying person's breath leaving him was
[1:17:06] his spirit leaving him. And the other
[1:17:08] word used in the Hebrew uh in the same
[1:17:11] context is shakina.
[1:17:14] But in some places, the translators
[1:17:16] still use Holy Spirit.
[1:17:21] I don't know about you, but I love to
[1:17:24] know everything about it.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave a little piece
[1:17:27] out. I want to know everything about it
[1:17:29] so that I know what I've got when I get
[1:17:31] it.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it was the same Holy Spirit of
[1:17:36] God anointing man differently for
[1:17:39] different dispensations. Do we all get
[1:17:41] that? The writers of this New Testament
[1:17:44] wrote in Aramaic. They wrote in Greek
[1:17:46] and they use words described as air or
[1:17:49] breath. In the in the Greek it's numa if
[1:17:52] those of you searching it up. So again
[1:17:54] this is where the translators use the
[1:17:56] word holy spirit. But when they use the
[1:17:58] words anointing power etc they were
[1:18:02] referring to the holy ghost. Amen. So
[1:18:06] spirit
[1:18:08] power and anointing ghost spirit holy
[1:18:12] spirit that which is within you doing
[1:18:14] something but holy ghost power and
[1:18:17] anointing are we together right so the
[1:18:20] writers and translators knew the
[1:18:21] difference and they tried to express it
[1:18:23] differently giving it a name that would
[1:18:26] show the difference and the definition
[1:18:28] then the holy ghost or the holy spirit
[1:18:30] basically saints is the anointing of god
[1:18:33] for mankind now we got understand why
[1:18:36] it's necessary.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; So, you still with me?
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; In every dispensation, it changes.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Every dispensation.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; We got to understand why it changes
[1:18:51] because the Holy Spirit is obedient to
[1:18:54] something.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason it changes.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Okay? Same Holy Spirit, but it's
[1:19:01] changing because it's obedient to
[1:19:03] something. What is it? obedient to the
[1:19:06] revelation of the word for that day.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; It's going to anoint you. You know, like
[1:19:13] how the prophet says Moses couldn't take
[1:19:15] Noah's revelation and build an ark and
[1:19:18] sail out of Egypt.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Because that wasn't the word for that
[1:19:23] day.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Moses would not have received the Holy
[1:19:26] Spirit ability to build an ark.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. And even though it would
[1:19:31] have been the word for a previous day
[1:19:34] and a great anointing and great ability
[1:19:36] would have been fantastic to see Moses
[1:19:39] and the people in Goan building an ark,
[1:19:41] it wasn't going to work.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; It was going to be an interpretation
[1:19:45] that was not going to work for their day
[1:19:47] because the Holy Spirit was not going to
[1:19:49] anoint them on the word of Noah's day.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:54] influence or rather follows the word for
[1:19:58] the day. That's why the manifestation is
[1:20:01] different.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; So when the full revelation of the word
[1:20:06] is come, the manifestations of the
[1:20:08] spirit need no longer be seen because
[1:20:12] the people would manifest the works by
[1:20:14] faith, not needing gifts or sensations
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Spirit is bringing you
[1:20:21] up to receive the full word. And when
[1:20:25] you have the full word, you are going to
[1:20:27] have the full manifestation of Christ
[1:20:29] made flesh. And you don't need help.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Which is what that Holy Spirit is. It's
[1:20:38] help. It's a guide. Amen. Now everything
[1:20:42] becomes one. It's the fullness of the
[1:20:44] Godhead bodily when it brings you up to
[1:20:46] that time when you become the word made
[1:20:48] flesh. Listen, I'm not saying you don't
[1:20:51] need the Holy Ghost anymore. Don't make
[1:20:53] that mistake.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Let's understand. So therefore, today
[1:20:57] people are expecting. This is the reason
[1:21:00] it's confusing because people are
[1:21:02] expecting to have the Holy Ghost like
[1:21:05] Acts chapter 2.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; And listen people, you know what a
[1:21:09] mockery it's been, right? From Pentecost
[1:21:12] all the way up to now. And it's what
[1:21:16] they call speaking in tongues was just
[1:21:19] glosselia.
[1:21:20] That's not what happened in Acts chapter
[1:21:22] 2. You know that they spoke different
[1:21:25] languages of other men
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; and and I don't know how the churches
[1:21:29] just let it slip and all you get is
[1:21:32] glosselia which is just like gibberish
[1:21:35] being spoken
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; and they just claim by by the Holy Ghost
[1:21:39] you know this is another language where
[1:21:42] there's actually supposed to be a person
[1:21:44] who speaks that language that interprets
[1:21:46] that. And then what we had is churches
[1:21:49] having someone speaking in in a tongue
[1:21:52] and then interpreting that
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; themselves and then it's not even
[1:21:57] interpreted by two or three witnesses to
[1:21:59] establish it. It's just accepted as a
[1:22:01] gift. And why? Because people are
[1:22:03] afraid.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; I was just telling brother Chad this and
[1:22:08] just just
[1:22:10] um a little bit off topic. When you take
[1:22:12] a gift of the Holy Ghost and and this is
[1:22:15] something serious that we did with
[1:22:17] people is um the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:21] have to be under subjection of humility
[1:22:24] because it's so easy to go to pride
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; right now. And I asked my church this
[1:22:31] just last week. I said to them, uh how
[1:22:35] many of you here been in the message for
[1:22:37] like 30, 40 years? Let's see your hands.
[1:22:39] How many of you been here? 30 40 years
[1:22:41] in the message. Yes.
[1:22:43] So, how many of you you remember the uh
[1:22:46] people who spoke with tongues and
[1:22:48] prophesied? How many of you can remember
[1:22:50] yourself being comfortable with them?
[1:22:56] You were more terrified that they were
[1:22:58] going to expose you.
[1:23:02] That that's what I hope he doesn't
[1:23:03] prophesy about me. I hope he doesn't say
[1:23:05] something bad about me. Not that you
[1:23:07] have something bad, but you just w with
[1:23:09] these gifts somehow these gifts always
[1:23:12] speak bad things.
[1:23:14] There's just never any good things that
[1:23:16] they prophesy about. Just always
[1:23:18] something bad, you know. And so what
[1:23:20] happens is this fear sort of builds up
[1:23:23] in the people about this person with the
[1:23:25] gift. Now what happens when you do that?
[1:23:28] When you make yourself fearful of
[1:23:30] someone, you are giving that person
[1:23:32] power.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Power that corrupts him. Yes.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; See, and it shouldn't be that way
[1:23:39] because this man should be under
[1:23:42] humility.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; He should know, he should he should know
[1:23:45] that this people should not fear him.
[1:23:48] And when you fear a man, you start to
[1:23:51] give him power that corrupts him. We
[1:23:53] corrupt them. That's
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; And that's what's happened in the
[1:23:58] churches. Right. So saints, when the
[1:24:01] full revelation of the word has come and
[1:24:04] we have the manifestation of the spirit,
[1:24:05] we need to see the proper manifestation
[1:24:08] of the spirit. That's for this day. Do
[1:24:10] you believe that?
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; All right. So let's get to it.
[1:24:14] Today people are expecting to have the
[1:24:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost like Acts
[1:24:18] chapter 2, but it's a different
[1:24:20] dispensation. How do we know? Because
[1:24:22] the word is different. Amen.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost must
[1:24:27] anoint people according to the word
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; for the day.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Agreed. All right. So, this is where we
[1:24:36] must find the middle of the road. Let's
[1:24:37] go to a quote here. I promise you, we're
[1:24:41] halfway.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Now, here the life that was in the husk,
[1:24:46] this is the message masterpiece. in the
[1:24:48] stalk and the tassel and the husk all
[1:24:50] gathers in the seed. And the life that
[1:24:51] was in the stalk went uh one went to
[1:24:55] make the other. Justification made a way
[1:24:56] for sanctification. Sanctification made
[1:24:59] a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:00] And here it is. The baptism of the Holy
[1:25:03] Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost
[1:25:06] itself
[1:25:08] to come right down in perfection back to
[1:25:11] the word again to manifest itself. So
[1:25:15] see, I wasn't saying that when you have
[1:25:17] the fullness of the word, there's no
[1:25:19] need for the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; What what we are saying is there's no
[1:25:24] need for manifestations that were
[1:25:26] necessary when you didn't have the
[1:25:27] fullness of the word.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Let me give you the
[1:25:34] picture, right? So when they came out of
[1:25:36] the upper room and they've got no tapes,
[1:25:40] no CDs, no message, no Bibles,
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; they've got no written word to back up
[1:25:46] what they're saying.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; They're coming out to say Jesus Christ
[1:25:50] is God made flesh. He was crucified. He
[1:25:54] died and rose again. And we are
[1:25:55] witnesses of that. And what are the
[1:25:57] people going to say? Oh yeah.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Prove it.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Prove it. Yes.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; So with what little word they had, they
[1:26:06] required gifts of the Holy Ghost to
[1:26:09] vindicate what they were saying,
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; to vindicate their message. So the gifts
[1:26:15] of the Holy Ghost at that time and the
[1:26:17] the less word you have, the greater the
[1:26:19] manifestations need to be.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? And this is why as it
[1:26:25] progressed and the more the word came
[1:26:27] in, the less they needed help from the
[1:26:30] Holy Ghost to vindicate their word.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; And then we reached the end of the ages
[1:26:34] where you got this prophet
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; who's coming with the message to saying
[1:26:39] to say I am the forerunner of the second
[1:26:41] coming of the Lord.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; And what are the people going to say? Oh
[1:26:44] yeah,
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; prove it.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? So there needs to be
[1:26:50] a manifestation to vindicate the word
[1:26:52] that he's bringing.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; And that's why in the last day there
[1:26:55] needed to be an outpouring of the Holy
[1:26:57] Ghost again to vindicate something that
[1:27:00] was coming in.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; That's how it works.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when people are saying we need
[1:27:07] to see this, I know there's some some
[1:27:09] places in Africa where they're insisting
[1:27:11] like today uh when I mean now in 2025,
[1:27:15] you'll have ministers saying every
[1:27:18] single pastor must have the supernatural
[1:27:20] following him. He must have some kind of
[1:27:23] uh supernatural manifestation or else
[1:27:25] he's not a true minister.
[1:27:28] like he he must either prophesy or speak
[1:27:31] with tongues and then it puts pressure
[1:27:32] on the men and then the men start faking
[1:27:34] things
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; and and to what to what end
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; you have the fullness of the word the
[1:27:41] fullness of the word is come. So so then
[1:27:43] if you are still depending on the
[1:27:45] ability to vindicate you why do we need
[1:27:47] to vindicate a word that has already
[1:27:49] been vindicated.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; It has been fully vindicated.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; We are preaching word that has already
[1:27:56] been fully vindicated.
[1:28:00] So then what do I need to vindicate
[1:28:02] myself? If I want to vindicate myself,
[1:28:04] then I have serious inferiority complex.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Then I need to prove myself to the
[1:28:10] people to elevate myself.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; That's not what the holy the Holy Ghost
[1:28:14] is not going to clown for anyone.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that?
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Back to the word again to manifest
[1:28:21] itself. But when denominated well what
[1:28:24] denominated dies like life in Lutheran
[1:28:28] we're reading again went to make Wesley
[1:28:29] and from Wesley went to Pentecost and
[1:28:31] from Pentecost to make the original seed
[1:28:33] onto Pentecost comes out of the Wesley
[1:28:35] until that time. The reason that
[1:28:37] Pentecost come out of Wesley because it
[1:28:40] was no denomination. Uh Pentecost was
[1:28:43] the this is what I want to get to. Then
[1:28:45] Pentecost went to denominate and what
[1:28:49] did it do? It turned to the husk. It
[1:28:52] looked like the real thing.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Pentecost looked like the real thing.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; You know I I keep telling um message
[1:29:03] people
[1:29:04] please when you are reading things like
[1:29:07] this understand that the prophet is
[1:29:10] talking about himself.
[1:29:16] What's he telling you? He's the real
[1:29:18] thing.
[1:29:21] That's right.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Go read the message. He'll tell you.
[1:29:24] We've had all the Elijah's mantels and
[1:29:27] the rushing winds and we've had the
[1:29:28] blood in the hands and we've had all of
[1:29:30] this. We've had impersonations.
[1:29:32] Impersonations of what?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; He's being humble.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; He's telling you they are impersonations
[1:29:38] of his gift,
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; of his ministry. The more he came out
[1:29:42] and he came out with the first pool,
[1:29:44] everybody wanted the same or even
[1:29:46] better. And then they all had to come
[1:29:47] out with something extra special to to
[1:29:50] overdo what or rather to to to um uh
[1:29:54] have preeminence over what he had. And
[1:29:56] then when he when he was in his second
[1:29:58] pool, then they all wanted to have
[1:30:00] something else.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; And then he would start concocting
[1:30:03] things and having interviews with people
[1:30:06] and getting to know the secret lives.
[1:30:07] And be careful of today. There are
[1:30:09] people doing that.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Do you know how easy it is in
[1:30:13] Pentecostal churches? It's so sorrowful,
[1:30:17] pitiful that these people are so duped
[1:30:19] by all these men with gifts.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to have your secret fell
[1:30:24] there in the back going on Facebook and
[1:30:26] looking at somebody's profile and he's
[1:30:28] got a mic in he's got a thing in here
[1:30:30] saying this person was uh you know uh in
[1:30:34] Africa last week and they were wearing
[1:30:35] this color clothes. The man stands, I
[1:30:38] see you in Africa
[1:30:40] and you were wearing these clothes and
[1:30:43] you had a pearl necklace on.
[1:30:46] But his inspiration is coming from
[1:30:47] Facebook and the guy in his ear.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; I'm from Africa. I've seen these people
[1:30:53] do this,
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; do tricks with the iPads and whatever.
[1:30:58] And and they're claiming this to be
[1:31:00] gifts of the Holy Ghost. It's so easy to
[1:31:02] act like you have discernment to try and
[1:31:04] be like the prophet. In the meantime,
[1:31:06] you're using social media
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; and the people just don't even know
[1:31:10] that. I I don't understand.
[1:31:14] Then he shows how that Pentecost or
[1:31:16] brother Brandham's day, his day, had the
[1:31:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost, but yet there
[1:31:21] was still the Holy Ghost person
[1:31:25] still to come, which is our day.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Did you see that in the quote?
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Right. Justification made way for
[1:31:32] sanctification. sanctification made way
[1:31:34] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:31:36] here it is, the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:38] Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost
[1:31:41] itself to come right down in perfection.
[1:31:44] He's literally giving us the process.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And now in a day where you and I are to
[1:31:50] be receiving the person,
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; the the people, the ministers want you
[1:31:55] to go back and get the baptism
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; of the previous day.
[1:32:02] That's right.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with the baptism.
[1:32:05] You and I individually still have to go.
[1:32:07] We have to go through our own process of
[1:32:09] justification, sanctification. He was
[1:32:11] talking about similar to the seed,
[1:32:13] right? What was the seed goes from the
[1:32:15] seed goes to the stalk, the leaves, the
[1:32:17] tassel, the husk. He said the husk looks
[1:32:20] like the real thing.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; People will take the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:24] Ghost, excuse me, and it looks like the
[1:32:27] real thing,
[1:32:29] but the real thing is something else.
[1:32:31] Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; All right. So, let's go through a
[1:32:34] summary. Let's go to E is um Ezekiel.
[1:32:37] Oh, I didn't read that second half for
[1:32:39] you.
[1:32:41] I'll put on the screen. Ezekiel 36:26
[1:32:43] 27. You love him, saints.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; You know this very very well. A new
[1:32:47] heart also will I give you. A new spirit
[1:32:50] will I put within you. And I will take
[1:32:52] away the stony heart out of your flesh.
[1:32:54] And I will give you an heart of flesh.
[1:32:56] And I will put my spirit within you.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So up to that point, I mean, you
[1:33:02] have a new heart, you get a new spirit,
[1:33:05] you get a new nature. Basically, I will
[1:33:07] take away your stony heart and all of
[1:33:08] that. But we know the final desire of
[1:33:12] God is that his spirit
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; dwells in you.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Not gifts, not anointings.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; I will put my spirit within you. Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Now people look at that today and say
[1:33:27] his spirit within me must produce all
[1:33:30] the the the signs and wonders and
[1:33:33] miracles and so on. His spirit is not
[1:33:36] going to do what you wanted to do.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; It's going to follow the word for the
[1:33:42] day.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; That's what's important,
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; right? Look at Joel chapter 2.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. And it shall come to pass after
[1:33:50] with that I will pour out my spirit upon
[1:33:52] all flesh and your sons and daughters.
[1:33:54] Now this is listen what he wanted to do
[1:33:57] was put his spirit within you. But Joel
[1:33:59] prophesied of the spirit upon you
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; upon all flesh and your sons and
[1:34:04] daughters. And he's identifying you're
[1:34:05] going to prophesy. You're going to dream
[1:34:07] dreams. Your young men shall see visions
[1:34:09] and also upon the servants and upon the
[1:34:11] handmmaids. So when it came in Acts
[1:34:12] chapter 2, Peter says this is that which
[1:34:15] was spoken by the prophet Joel. So he is
[1:34:18] identifying that what came in Acts
[1:34:20] chapter 2 was what Joel prophesied of
[1:34:22] the spirit upon all flesh. The anointing
[1:34:26] on the flesh, not the spirit of God
[1:34:28] within you.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Hold that thought. Notice the
[1:34:35] difference.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Acts 2 was the fulfillment of Joel, not
[1:34:39] Ezekiel.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with us?
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Ezekiel is not pouring out
[1:34:45] my spirit upon all flesh.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel is putting my spirit within the
[1:34:49] elect.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Not the rain falling on the just and the
[1:34:54] unjust.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; God does not put his spirit in people
[1:34:58] who will then lose it.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Do you see why the same and not the
[1:35:04] same?
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Right? Let's move on.
[1:35:07] So his spirit upon everyone is all right
[1:35:10] because it helps push an agenda. It
[1:35:13] helps push God's agenda for that age and
[1:35:16] gets the church moving forward. But when
[1:35:18] it comes to the capstone time, it has to
[1:35:21] do with the spirit of God in his people.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; That's what we should be desiring. Amen.
[1:35:28] So uh father, word, son, holy spirit,
[1:35:33] holy ghost and then it must lead to the
[1:35:36] fullness of everything in the bride.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Right? And if we can define the
[1:35:41] differences between father and son, word
[1:35:43] and son, why are we afraid or too
[1:35:46] religious to differentiate between holy
[1:35:48] spirit and holy ghost?
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Let's have a look. What is the holy
[1:35:52] spirit? Right? It is the anointing of
[1:35:55] god given for man. You can start there.
[1:35:58] The Holy Spirit originally worked with
[1:36:01] the spirit of man only originally from
[1:36:04] the Old Testament. After Christ came,
[1:36:06] the Holy Spirit changed to a new
[1:36:08] dispensation. It became the Holy Ghost
[1:36:11] dispensation
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; over church ages. Is that right? And the
[1:36:16] Holy Spirit which once anointed entire
[1:36:19] beings of prophets, high priest, listen.
[1:36:23] Elijah ran before the chariot of Ahab.
[1:36:28] That's right.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has no desire to make you
[1:36:31] do that today.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; There's no reason for that.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Not even to prove something to you,
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; right? Uh so the Holy Spirit anointed
[1:36:41] their entire being. I mean it gave if
[1:36:44] you try to run faster than a horse, your
[1:36:46] heart will pack up in 10 minutes. Not
[1:36:48] even 10 minutes.
[1:36:50] In fact, in 2025, we wouldn't make it
[1:36:52] 100 meters.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; That's how
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; unhealthy we are.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; So, I'm just saying that that's not even
[1:37:01] a normal thing that the human body can
[1:37:03] do. That would have to take the Holy
[1:37:05] Spirit to anoint to give ability to the
[1:37:08] body to do that.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Right? It's a it's an an abnormal
[1:37:15] ability
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; that we know can only come from God. So
[1:37:19] the Holy Ghost is the same Holy Spirit
[1:37:23] anointing the flesh of all men and women
[1:37:26] who believe. Agreed? So the Holy Ghost
[1:37:30] was differentiated by the scribes of uh
[1:37:33] the Bible as the Holy Spirit, the same
[1:37:36] Holy Spirit that was in David, the same
[1:37:38] Holy Spirit that anointed Moses. The
[1:37:40] Holy Ghost is the same Holy Spirit
[1:37:43] except now it's following the word of
[1:37:46] Christ.
[1:37:48] go into the world, baptize them in the
[1:37:51] name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost,
[1:37:53] cast out devils, heal the sick. That's
[1:37:56] the word of Christ. Now, that same Holy
[1:37:58] Spirit that was anointing men to kill
[1:38:00] the enemies, now it's anointing men to
[1:38:03] follow the word of Christ,
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; right? It's not going to go back. Even
[1:38:08] if those people, Peter and Paul and all
[1:38:11] these men being put into prison and uh
[1:38:13] the the the saints being eaten by lions
[1:38:16] and bears in the circus, you know, they
[1:38:18] could have been praying, Lord, give me
[1:38:20] the power to stand up and destroy all
[1:38:22] these gladiators. Go and w you know,
[1:38:25] whack off the head of the emperor of
[1:38:27] Rome and give us the victory. The Holy
[1:38:29] Spirit was not going to do that.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; It's following the word for the day.
[1:38:33] Amen.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Barham uses, here's an uh more
[1:38:38] to it. Brother Barham uses both phrases,
[1:38:41] Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit,
[1:38:42] interchangeably as if they are the same.
[1:38:45] That's why I want to tell you young
[1:38:47] people, all we're doing today is just
[1:38:50] simplifying it for you so that you don't
[1:38:53] doubt what you have
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; and you don't judge yourself by other
[1:38:57] people or by some revelation or
[1:38:59] something of some other man. You need to
[1:39:02] know and and so when they say the Holy
[1:39:05] Spirit here when brother says the Holy
[1:39:07] Spirit here know that he's talking about
[1:39:08] the Holy Ghost
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; the gifts when he's talking about the
[1:39:12] Holy Ghost here know that he's talking
[1:39:13] about the baptism but know other places
[1:39:16] when he's talking about here is talking
[1:39:18] about the person
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; know the difference
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; right amen
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; are you with me
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; all right so brother taught the
[1:39:26] difference between having the baptism of
[1:39:29] the Holy Ghost and having the person of
[1:39:31] the Holy Ghost,
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; right? Brother Bham also taught that the
[1:39:35] Holy Spirit was once given with measure,
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; but the hol the baptism of the Holy
[1:39:40] Ghost is the fullness of the Holy Spirit
[1:39:43] spread over the church. How fullness?
[1:39:46] Some would have a gift of this, others
[1:39:48] would have a gift of that. Not every
[1:39:49] person has the fullness of the gift in
[1:39:52] one person, right?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; But the fullness is spread out over the
[1:39:55] entire body of the bride.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The baptism of the Holy Ghost upon
[1:40:00] a single person is the anointing of the
[1:40:04] Holy Spirit to give a particular ability
[1:40:07] to that believer that is necessary not
[1:40:11] even for you.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; It's for God's purpose for the church
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; for other people. The baptism of the
[1:40:20] Holy Ghost given for Peter was so that
[1:40:22] the word could be believed by others.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:30] So there's a purpose behind it. Amen.
[1:40:32] The purpose for vindicating the word to
[1:40:34] others. The Holy Spirit was described as
[1:40:37] that which followed the leading of the
[1:40:40] father ministry. In other words, the Old
[1:40:42] Testament, the Holy Ghost was described
[1:40:45] as that which is following the son's
[1:40:47] ministry.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Got it?
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not going too fast. So this
[1:40:53] is how it all happened. The Holy Spirit
[1:40:56] is an attribute of God. It's just
[1:40:59] English words, right? It's an attribute
[1:41:01] of God which came into manifestation
[1:41:04] when the first man was created to give
[1:41:07] that man power on earth to be God on
[1:41:12] earth. Why? Because he was flesh. If
[1:41:16] he's given the spirit of God, now he
[1:41:19] becomes the vessel of God to fulfill the
[1:41:22] purpose of God.
[1:41:25] Right? So that's why I said the Holy
[1:41:26] Spirit has got to do with man.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; You know when you got that then you
[1:41:32] understand the true mystery of the
[1:41:34] godhead is it becomes in the end time it
[1:41:38] the trinity to the the Catholic is
[1:41:40] father son holy spirit. But when you
[1:41:42] understand what holy spirit is, then you
[1:41:44] find yourself in the
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; godhead.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Then you know it's father, son, and
[1:41:47] bride
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; complete because the holy spirit was
[1:41:51] given to bring anointing to mankind.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; And you and I must find ourselves in the
[1:41:57] godhead.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; That is the mystery of it.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Tell that to a Catholic, they'll kill
[1:42:02] you.
[1:42:05] When man sinned, he lost constant
[1:42:08] contact with the Holy Spirit along with
[1:42:10] his theophony. Right? As time passed,
[1:42:13] God anointed certain prophets, kings,
[1:42:15] and priests with measure by inspiring
[1:42:18] them by the Holy Spirit to fulfill a
[1:42:21] purpose.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; So, what I'm saying is Gideon received
[1:42:27] the Holy Spirit to go and do what he had
[1:42:29] to do. And then Gideon went home and
[1:42:33] that which he was inspired with was
[1:42:34] over. Now he was Gideon again.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; And Gideon was making mistakes that he
[1:42:39] should not have.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Which means the Holy Ghost came for a
[1:42:45] purpose regarding the word and that's
[1:42:47] it.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; At that time.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then he went back to being
[1:42:52] Gideon again and you know got old and uh
[1:42:56] made mistakes with him and his family
[1:42:58] and took the ephford and people started
[1:43:00] making an idol of it. Is that right?
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Same man who had this great
[1:43:06] manifestation. One of the greatest
[1:43:07] battles we read of in the Bible. He had
[1:43:10] the Holy Spirit. How could a man we
[1:43:12] would say how could a man with the Holy
[1:43:14] Spirit go and take the eph and make an
[1:43:16] idol out of it?
[1:43:20] How could Samson having the Holy Spirit
[1:43:22] go and commit adultery knowing that he's
[1:43:25] a Nazerite?
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; And then God still use him, give him the
[1:43:30] Holy Spirit at the right time to bring
[1:43:31] down a temple and then he dies.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; As time passed, God, in other words,
[1:43:38] they received the Holy Spirit for a
[1:43:40] season. They fulfilled their purpose and
[1:43:42] then it passed.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Christ came, he changed the
[1:43:49] revelation of God to man. A new
[1:43:53] revelation of God was coming forth. The
[1:43:55] Holy Spirit now could anoint the flesh
[1:43:57] of them that believed on Christ because
[1:44:00] Christ was the the re the mystery of God
[1:44:03] revealed to them.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Right now, the outpouring of the Holy
[1:44:06] Spirit on a group of people in Acts
[1:44:08] chapter 2 was called for the first time
[1:44:11] the baptism
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. We're going to
[1:44:15] understand what that means in a little
[1:44:17] while. See, I didn't say just now,
[1:44:19] brother.
[1:44:21] The outpouring of the baptism of the
[1:44:23] Holy Ghost upon a group of people was
[1:44:25] given in the Pentecostal age. Right
[1:44:27] there in the beginning, right? And now
[1:44:30] we receive again a baptism of the Holy
[1:44:32] Ghost former and latter reign in the end
[1:44:34] time. That's right.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Right. So the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:38] then has to make way for the person of
[1:44:40] the Holy Ghost to come into the
[1:44:43] believer. Not just an anointing to push
[1:44:46] an agenda, but now to come into the
[1:44:48] believer by the believer accepting and
[1:44:51] believing completely the full revealed
[1:44:54] word for the day.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; They could not do that in all the other
[1:44:58] ages. So the Holy Spirit, the Holy
[1:45:01] Ghost, whatever you want to call him,
[1:45:03] anointing and so on was leading so that
[1:45:06] the eventual person could come into us.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. The believer is sealed
[1:45:13] by that Holy Spirit, not the baptism.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; We're going to find that out, too.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; So, this would follow the father to take
[1:45:23] his place and start living and dwelling
[1:45:25] in the soul of man. This is my beloved
[1:45:28] son in whom I am well pleased to dwell
[1:45:30] in. God comes and says in Revelations
[1:45:33] 21, these are my people. I shall be
[1:45:35] their God. I am dwelling with them. I am
[1:45:38] in them. I am dwelling uh in them. I am
[1:45:40] with them. They are my tabernacle.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost can be
[1:45:46] received by those who believe with their
[1:45:49] mind with their minds and not with their
[1:45:52] heart. The baptism
[1:45:56] because it falls in the just and the
[1:45:58] unjust.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; These make believers can receive the
[1:46:02] Holy Ghost, the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:03] Ghost, and still go to hell.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; But you cannot receive the person
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; and go to hell.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Let's look at what and you can go
[1:46:16] through the message. We're drawing it to
[1:46:19] close. You can go through the entire
[1:46:21] message and you can see how the prophet
[1:46:23] targets sensations, right? And speaks
[1:46:25] about sensations. And I love that he's
[1:46:28] done this, right? I'm just showing you
[1:46:30] some statements. I'm not going to put up
[1:46:32] the whole quote, just statements. Look
[1:46:34] at this one. Don't try to have any
[1:46:36] sensation or anything take the place of
[1:46:39] the Holy Spirit.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; When the new birth is come, you are
[1:46:43] changed.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Don't let sensations take the place of
[1:46:47] the Holy Spirit.
[1:46:49] That's right.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Look at the next one. Every person
[1:46:51] that's been born again of the Holy
[1:46:53] Spirit
[1:46:55] uh truly born, not just thought they
[1:46:57] were born,
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; not went through some emotion, not went
[1:47:00] through some sensation, but was truly
[1:47:02] born. They could have all the emotion
[1:47:05] sensation with it, but you have you
[1:47:08] could have the sensation and emotion and
[1:47:10] not be born.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; How about this one? God don't want you
[1:47:15] to run after gifts. He wants you to
[1:47:17] thirst after him.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; I I would rather see young people. I
[1:47:24] would rather see that
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; because I know there there's a promise
[1:47:28] that comes with thirsting after him.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Him that thirsts after righteousness,
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; hungers and thirsts after righteous, you
[1:47:36] shall be filled.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Go looking for that. Don't run after
[1:47:40] gifts. Don't run after signs. Amen.
[1:47:43] Thirst for him. That's what he wants.
[1:47:46] How about this? We cannot base our
[1:47:49] salvation upon sensations or experiences
[1:47:52] of others or on our own experiences
[1:47:57] experience. It's you cannot even base
[1:47:59] your salvation on your own experience.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; It's got to be the word of God because
[1:48:05] that's the true mark.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; That's the true mark. You know what he
[1:48:11] speaks about in the in what is the Holy
[1:48:13] Ghost? The Holy Ghost is a mark. It's a
[1:48:16] seal.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; It's an identification of something.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the the word of God is the
[1:48:23] true mark.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Okay, so I want to get
[1:48:27] to this thought. Lost and not lost.
[1:48:31] Okay,
[1:48:33] let's start with having the Holy Ghost
[1:48:35] and going to hell. In leadership, he
[1:48:38] says the choice of your conduct. You
[1:48:41] could you can mix it now. Now you're
[1:48:42] either of God or against God. And the
[1:48:44] outward expression shows exactly what's
[1:48:46] on the inside. The cocka many of you
[1:48:48] think I got the baptism of the Holy
[1:48:50] Ghost. I'm going to heaven. That don't
[1:48:53] mean one thing that you're going to
[1:48:55] heaven. No sir. You can have the baptism
[1:48:58] of the Holy Ghost every hour in your
[1:49:00] life and still be lost and go to hell.
[1:49:03] The Bible says so. Uh-huh. That's
[1:49:06] exactly right.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; I know you've heard this before.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Yeah.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; But this is why it's important to
[1:49:12] separate what it is.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; You can have the anointing
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; every hour in your life and go to hell,
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; not the person.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; And God does not give the person
[1:49:26] willy-nilly to people.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; So why was the anointing given? The
[1:49:32] anointing of the same spirit. What is
[1:49:34] anointing? Ability. Yes.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Why is ability given to vindicate the
[1:49:40] word
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; to push a purpose or an agenda? Right.
[1:49:46] How about this one? There's a question
[1:49:48] someone asked, "Brother Bam, if possible
[1:49:51] for a person to be lost and end up in
[1:49:52] hell if he rejects the light of the word
[1:49:54] even though he has a genuine experience
[1:49:56] of justification and sanctification."
[1:49:59] There's two things in that question.
[1:50:01] Brother Ram said, "Yes, sir. That's
[1:50:02] exactly right.
[1:50:04] You can have a genuine experience of
[1:50:07] justification and sanctification and
[1:50:09] reject the word.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Why was that possible? Because there was
[1:50:15] a time,
[1:50:16] you know, justification is a is a is an
[1:50:20] experience. Sanctification is an
[1:50:22] experience. And this is what people
[1:50:24] struggle with understanding how you can
[1:50:27] have all these experiences and we go
[1:50:29] back in our past and say, well, I know
[1:50:31] for sure who I am because this on this
[1:50:33] date and so on. We're so good at that.
[1:50:35] On that date and this time, this brother
[1:50:37] did this and whatever. I remember that
[1:50:39] was the day of my salvation. I'm
[1:50:41] homeward bound. Glory to God.
[1:50:45] How many people have we heard saying
[1:50:46] that and then they come and deny the
[1:50:49] open book
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; and deny the seven seal is open
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; and deny the thunders and place it in
[1:50:55] the future.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; How is how is the Holy Spirit? You can
[1:51:02] have the Holy Ghost and do that.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; But having the Holy Spirit, you will not
[1:51:09] do that.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Do you understand young people? Big
[1:51:13] difference.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Then look at this one. And I know we
[1:51:17] read the scripture earlier, but let's
[1:51:18] look at what the prophet says. Are you
[1:51:20] still with me?
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Young people, I hope you're catching.
[1:51:24] Ephesians 4:30, which says, "You are
[1:51:27] sealed by the Holy Spirit till the day
[1:51:28] of your redemption." I want you to
[1:51:30] notice what the prophet says. The Holy
[1:51:33] Ghost is God's Easter seal that seals us
[1:51:36] for eternity. Amen. Seals us for
[1:51:40] eternity. Now, this is what I'm pointing
[1:51:41] you to. He's not saying the baptism of
[1:51:44] the Holy Ghost is the Easter Seal.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; This is why I say he uses it
[1:51:48] interchangeably.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; And I love it because that's why it is
[1:51:52] in mystery form.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; How can you in in one place he says you
[1:51:56] can have the Holy Ghost every hour of
[1:51:59] your life and go to hell.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; But there he says the Holy Ghost is
[1:52:02] God's Easter Seal and seals us for
[1:52:04] eternity.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; And moving on, it says God's Holy
[1:52:09] Spirit.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:12] Oh, are you glad? Are you glad for
[1:52:14] Easter? Are you glad for this
[1:52:15] experience? Sealed. Shut in with God in
[1:52:18] a secret place. Shut in with God by his
[1:52:20] divine grace. Sealed till the day of our
[1:52:23] redemption. That's the true that's a
[1:52:25] real true Easter seal. So which is true?
[1:52:29] One is the anointing and one is the
[1:52:31] divine nature of the person.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. However you want to
[1:52:37] say it, they are just words. words that
[1:52:40] people use, words that the prophet used
[1:52:42] interchangeably, but you need to know
[1:52:45] young people clearly what it is
[1:52:48] referring to. And old people are
[1:52:50] starting to doubt your experience.
[1:52:53] You need to know what it means when you
[1:52:55] are reading all those quotes and
[1:52:57] statements because there's going to be
[1:52:58] ministries and people who are going to
[1:53:00] come up and use the same thing and tell
[1:53:02] you that you're supposed to be doing
[1:53:04] this, you're supposed to be having this,
[1:53:05] you're supposed to be feeling this. And
[1:53:07] the worst thing is they're going to
[1:53:08] judge your life and say to you, if you
[1:53:10] have the Holy Spirit, you won't do this.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; If you have the Holy Ghost, you won't do
[1:53:15] this. If you have this, you won't. This
[1:53:17] won't happen. And we start judging one
[1:53:19] another and judging ourselves by that.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; God is not interested in your feelings
[1:53:26] or your emotions. God is concerned with
[1:53:28] only one thing, his purpose.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to uh finding the middle
[1:53:37] of the road with this. This is the
[1:53:39] message. Hebrews chapter 1.
[1:53:42] You still with me?
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Now on this side, when people get
[1:53:45] converted, their minds is set on Christ
[1:53:49] and they're just a little scholarly.
[1:53:52] Amen. And don't keep under prayer, they
[1:53:55] get real cold and stiff and starchy and
[1:53:57] indifferent. And then if they're just a
[1:53:59] little bit nervous, if you I like how he
[1:54:02] says that a little bit nervous. He's
[1:54:04] being so nice. I'm not as nice. If you
[1:54:08] don't watch, they just get radical and
[1:54:10] wild on this side. See? And they go into
[1:54:12] sensations and everything.
[1:54:15] Paragraph 71. But the real church is a
[1:54:19] real sane gospel
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; right in the middle of the road. It's
[1:54:26] not cold and starchy. Neither is it
[1:54:28] fanaticism. It's a real good old warm
[1:54:32] gospel heartfelt love of God going right
[1:54:36] down the middle of the road calling from
[1:54:38] both sides. That's right. That's what
[1:54:41] how you going to get that church right
[1:54:43] out of the word the urum and thumb.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; What are we saying? All right. So, this
[1:54:49] is where we bring it together. How does
[1:54:51] one stay in the middle of the road with
[1:54:54] sensations? I know how complex we are
[1:54:56] saints. I know what I've been in the
[1:54:59] message since I'm 5 years old, right? Or
[1:55:02] the message was on upon me until I got
[1:55:05] into it, however you want to say it,
[1:55:07] right? But I've seen it. I I've I've
[1:55:10] watched it develop. I've watched the
[1:55:12] people around. I've I've been criticized
[1:55:14] by people from the time I'm a I'm a
[1:55:16] teenager and telling me about this or
[1:55:19] about my dressing or my hairstyle or
[1:55:22] whatever. You know, if you if you had a
[1:55:26] sneaker with white laces, it was
[1:55:27] worldly. If you put colored laces, it
[1:55:29] was worldly. If it was a certain type of
[1:55:32] brand, it was worldly. I mean, you could
[1:55:34] you might as well go barefoot.
[1:55:37] If you used cream in your hair, it's
[1:55:39] worldly. If you left it dry and floppy,
[1:55:42] it's worldly. Everything is just
[1:55:44] worldly. There's like nowhere to walk
[1:55:46] because every single person has a
[1:55:47] different idea about something.
[1:55:50] You know, I told our our church last
[1:55:52] week, some of you have gotten so holy in
[1:55:55] your dressing, you wouldn't have Sister
[1:55:57] Ma in your church.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; You'll kick her out because you gotten
[1:56:03] so holy. Some of you gotten so holy,
[1:56:05] you'll kick Brother out.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; I mean, you should see what's going on
[1:56:10] in Africa.
[1:56:13] We become this people that's like we've
[1:56:15] got these standards that's that's way
[1:56:18] out there that nobody can attain. It's
[1:56:20] like what Christ was telling the
[1:56:21] Pharisees. You put a burden upon the
[1:56:24] people that you yourself won't even uh
[1:56:26] uh push or even lift.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; And we're judging people based on those
[1:56:34] things on the on what? On what our idea
[1:56:37] of the Holy Spirit is. Right?
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; How do we find the middle of the road?
[1:56:42] So, here's what happens. Like I'm
[1:56:44] telling you, I've been through this.
[1:56:45] You've got some people who who uh will
[1:56:48] say, "Well, we've got the word, you
[1:56:51] know, and our our song service is
[1:56:54] perfect." And another church comes and
[1:56:55] tells us, "You guys are dead. There's no
[1:56:59] spirit in you." Well, that's based on
[1:57:01] what their interpretation of spirit is.
[1:57:03] And then we will go to their church and
[1:57:05] we say, "Man, these guys don't have the
[1:57:07] spirit. They're so rowdy. There's just
[1:57:09] no order. They have this and that. You
[1:57:12] know, I see because even my little
[1:57:13] fellow, my my son is so judgmental
[1:57:18] about us and about other people and
[1:57:19] everything because he's used to
[1:57:21] something his way. I can see it actually
[1:57:22] in the children.
[1:57:25] So, you get under this pressure and I
[1:57:28] like what brother Mhamm says. It's not
[1:57:31] cold and starchy. Neither is it
[1:57:33] fanaticism.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; We've got to pull it together
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; and get the middle of the road.
[1:57:39] There needs to be expression.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; You cannot be an old dead stick
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; in the presence of God. If God has done
[1:57:47] something in your heart, there has to be
[1:57:48] an expression.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; There has to be an uh even something
[1:57:53] individual.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; It's quite simple. Be honest with
[1:57:59] yourself first.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Are you feeling what you claim to be
[1:58:03] feeling? If you are having a genuine
[1:58:06] sensation as God's word is proceeding,
[1:58:10] it will manifest itself as the spirit
[1:58:12] within you and will lead you.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; The most important thing, it will be in
[1:58:18] line with the word.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; That's what we got to watch for saints.
[1:58:24] If what you're doing is causing a
[1:58:26] stumbling block or confusion,
[1:58:29] then you have to adjust yourself.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word will adjust you with
[1:58:33] grace.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is crucial. It should not
[1:58:38] make the church uncomfortable or
[1:58:40] nervous. Your gift should not do that to
[1:58:43] someone.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Your expression should not do that to
[1:58:46] someone. It and and you don't stand
[1:58:48] there and you're losing your mind in the
[1:58:51] spirit and then you're nudging someone.
[1:58:52] Come on, be one of us.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; If he just wants to stand there and be
[1:58:57] quiet and just tear come down his eye,
[1:58:59] that's his expression. That's right.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; That the beautiful part of the Holy
[1:59:03] Spirit in each person is it's unique.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; And and God knows our lives. God knows
[1:59:09] our heart. He knows exactly how the word
[1:59:11] in us. He knows what word actually is
[1:59:14] residing in our soul. And our expression
[1:59:17] is going to be based upon that. And
[1:59:19] there's going to be a purpose that God
[1:59:21] has to fulfill through us.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Based on what word you have inside. So
[1:59:25] this is crucial. It should not make the
[1:59:28] church uncomfortable or nervous. Listen,
[1:59:30] the same Holy Ghost that made David
[1:59:34] strip off his clothes and dance before
[1:59:36] the ark is the same Holy Ghost that's
[1:59:39] anointing you to make sure you keep your
[1:59:40] clothes on
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; in the presence of the Lord.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; But it was necessary that day and the
[1:59:46] person his own wife criticizing him for
[1:59:49] doing that. God judged her for it
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; because it was the anointing of God in
[1:59:54] his life doing that.
[1:59:57] But it won't do that with us today
[1:59:59] because there is a word today
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; that is carrying a different agenda,
[2:00:04] different purpose.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; All right. So, as we close this down,
[2:00:09] there's something we need to look at.
[2:00:12] Baptism and holy. Okay. So, baptism of
[2:00:17] the Holy Ghost. What is baptism? What is
[2:00:19] the meaning of baptism? Okay. It's a
[2:00:22] Jewish concept. It's a Jewish tradition.
[2:00:25] And they used baptism like pouring water
[2:00:28] over Aaron the high priest. It was an
[2:00:31] outward expression of something that was
[2:00:34] being done, inducting him into a body.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; That's what it was for. But what was it
[2:00:41] signifying? Washing.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Washing away. Washing away what?
[2:00:49] Purging. Purging what? So we know what
[2:00:53] baptism now is. And now what is holy,
[2:00:56] right? Holy means set apart for purpose.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Holy has got nothing to do with cood.
[2:01:08] Because if you say be holy as your
[2:01:10] father in heaven is holy.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; What's that about?
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; The father in heaven doesn't wear
[2:01:18] shorts. He doesn't have to worry about
[2:01:20] TV or music or
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; so what what is the holiness of the
[2:01:25] father?
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; How are you to be holy as your father in
[2:01:29] heaven is holy? He is holy because he's
[2:01:32] committed to his purpose.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; He is set apart for his purpose.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; So if you are holy, it's calling you to
[2:01:40] be set apart for a purpose.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen people, living right,
[2:01:46] dressing right is reasonable service.
[2:01:49] It's actually common sense.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; You know, um um if you see me standing
[2:01:56] here in a pair of shorts and a torn
[2:01:58] t-shirt and and tattoos all over me and
[2:02:02] an earring and and here am I preaching
[2:02:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. What is
[2:02:06] the efficacy of my message?
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Where is the the efficiency? Where is
[2:02:12] the the power of my message? My
[2:02:15] presentation of myself is diminishing my
[2:02:18] message.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; So I'm saying that those things are just
[2:02:22] reasonable service. You you can't be um
[2:02:26] uh dressed like a hobo and then go ask
[2:02:29] to be a pilot
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; to fly that plane. The people are going
[2:02:34] to jump off at the moment they see you.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Because you're you're d and he could
[2:02:39] actually be a pilot dressed as a hobo.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to trust him.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; You understand? All that has to do with
[2:02:48] making your message more efficient, more
[2:02:51] direct, more powerful.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; But that's got nothing to do with your
[2:02:55] holiness.
[2:02:56] as in are you in your heart dedicated
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; to the purpose of God.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; That is holiness.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[2:03:09] being washed from a previous purpose
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; to induct you into a new purpose.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Washing all previous ambitions and
[2:03:19] purposes away and bringing that's why
[2:03:22] young people that's what it means by be
[2:03:24] baptized with the Holy Ghost means put
[2:03:26] aside your other ambitions.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; It means putting away all other whatever
[2:03:31] your career is. And if you're going to
[2:03:32] have a career, your purpose of God is
[2:03:35] going to be included in your career.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; See, for example, you can't say I'm the
[2:03:41] bride of Christ and I want to be a
[2:03:43] fashion designer.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Right? in Milan.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; How is that possible?
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; How is the purpose of God included in
[2:03:53] that?
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Right? Or I want to be a pastor and a
[2:03:58] full-time fisherman.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; It's it doesn't it doesn't work. It's it
[2:04:04] it doesn't make sense. It it it doesn't
[2:04:07] it doesn't have a a purpose that
[2:04:08] combines,
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; right? So, Holy Spirit and this is where
[2:04:14] I want to close with. What is then Holy
[2:04:18] Spirit? When we break it down, what does
[2:04:21] Holy Spirit actually mean? If holy has
[2:04:24] got to do with purpose and the purpose
[2:04:28] of God and spirit means divine nature or
[2:04:31] nature, then what we have is the
[2:04:34] purposeful nature.
[2:04:37] How do I know I have the Holy Spirit? I
[2:04:40] have the purposeful nature.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; That's what I want.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; I want my life driven by his purpose.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; I want to know what the purpose of God
[2:04:53] is for this day.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Now, if I know what the purpose of God
[2:04:57] is for this day, how am I going to be
[2:04:59] blackmailed by somebody who's telling me
[2:05:01] I need to get the Holy Ghost of another
[2:05:02] day?
[2:05:04] How am I going to be pressurized to act
[2:05:06] like something of another day that has
[2:05:08] got nothing to do with the purpose of
[2:05:10] this day?
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; So, as we close, what is the purpose of
[2:05:16] your day?
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; And I went unto the angel and said unto
[2:05:22] him, give me the little book. And he
[2:05:24] said unto me, take it.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; And eat it up.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; And it shall make thy belly bitter. So
[2:05:31] you have, if you didn't know about
[2:05:33] something you have to do, here it is.
[2:05:35] Take it and eat it up.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose for you.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; And it shall make thy belly bitter, but
[2:05:41] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[2:05:43] And I took the little book out of the
[2:05:44] angel's hand and ate it up. And it was
[2:05:46] in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon
[2:05:48] as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
[2:05:50] We all know that. And verse 11 says,
[2:05:52] "And he said unto me, thou must prophesy
[2:05:55] again before many peoples and nations
[2:05:57] and tongues and kings." And this is
[2:06:00] where you got people saying, you see, we
[2:06:02] must prophesy. You must speak with
[2:06:05] tongues. No, you must prophesy to many
[2:06:07] tongues.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; That means many languages of the earth.
[2:06:10] You must you must prophesy. You must
[2:06:13] speak
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; to the world.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; There's your purpose for today. So
[2:06:20] what's the purpose? Take the book,
[2:06:24] speak the word. This has never been
[2:06:28] given to any other age before.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; This is the purpose of the bride today.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Take the book. Speak the word. There it
[2:06:38] is. So, what is your purpose, young
[2:06:40] people? Speaking the word.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Taking the word. Now, this is what I
[2:06:48] find frustrating today
[2:06:50] is that people who are taking the word
[2:06:54] don't seem to be speaking.
[2:06:58] Either you feel pressurized that you're
[2:07:00] not allowed to speak. And I'm not just I
[2:07:02] don't just mean speaking as in with your
[2:07:05] mouth. Of course, you need to. It's
[2:07:07] telling you that the word that you took
[2:07:10] needs to be manifested
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; to all kingdoms and nations and tribes
[2:07:15] and people,
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; to your neighbor in the street,
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; to the people you come in contact with,
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; I feel like
[2:07:26] it needs to change. That's why we're
[2:07:28] feeling like something is missing.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; There needs to be a shift.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; It needs to change. You've got
[2:07:35] Pentecostal people, uh, denominational
[2:07:38] people, they they'll meet you somewhere
[2:07:40] and they'll they'll come up to you and
[2:07:42] say, "Have you been saved? Have you been
[2:07:45] born again?" And and you're thinking
[2:07:47] like, "If only you know." And then you
[2:07:49] walk away.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; What happened to your voice?
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; What happened to your testimony?
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; What happened to the witnesses?
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; How are we going to fill Revelations
[2:08:00] 10:8-11? Number one, you can't do it
[2:08:04] unless you take the book.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; And you need the Holy Spirit to be able
[2:08:09] to take the book. The Holy Spirit is the
[2:08:10] one saying, "Take the book, eat it up.
[2:08:13] This is what's going to happen." You
[2:08:15] take that word in, and then you have to
[2:08:16] speak it.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; You know, when I was uh a young man and
[2:08:22] running away from the ministry, a very
[2:08:25] humble minister who brought correction
[2:08:27] to me told me something. He said, "If
[2:08:29] you take the book and eat the book and
[2:08:32] you have this word inside you and you
[2:08:33] are not
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; speaking it, it's going to corrupt you.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; You're going to be like a well that's
[2:08:40] and it's got no
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; expression. It's got it's not it's not
[2:08:44] releasing itself." And you and I
[2:08:46] understood what was happening because
[2:08:48] there I was sitting in the in the church
[2:08:50] listening to ministry and I'm and I'm
[2:08:52] sitting there and I can feel the
[2:08:54] thoughts of God coming in and I want to
[2:08:55] express it and I'm sitting there
[2:08:57] thinking but this preacher can go this
[2:08:58] way and he can go that way and he could
[2:09:00] say this and and then it's eating me up
[2:09:03] and then it's the why don't you say it
[2:09:06] and no I'm I'm not I'm too good for that
[2:09:09] pulpit.
[2:09:12] That's eventually what comes to you.
[2:09:14] It's your pride standing in the way.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Humble yourself and speak the word.
[2:09:19] Amen. So you got what they're pushing,
[2:09:23] the agenda they're pushing today outside
[2:09:25] of in in the message is go to these
[2:09:27] camps. Go get slain in the spirit. Go
[2:09:31] speak with tongues. Go jump up and down
[2:09:33] and scream. But are you speaking the
[2:09:35] word? Because the purpose of the day is
[2:09:38] take the book, speak the word.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; We've got to find that we've I believe
[2:09:44] the church needs to lead us into that. I
[2:09:47] believe the the ministry needs to lead
[2:09:49] us into that. Each one of us needs to
[2:09:51] become speakers. And yes, I know you
[2:09:53] say, you know, brother Al, I'm just a
[2:09:55] housewife. What what do I need to speak?
[2:09:58] Well, you are speaking to your children.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; You're speaking with your husband.
[2:10:03] You're speaking in your life. You're
[2:10:05] speaking with your friends, with your
[2:10:06] families. It's it's got to come to it
[2:10:09] now where your life is speaking, not
[2:10:10] just your words.
[2:10:12] What do I mean by life? And I'm not even
[2:10:14] talking about the codes and standards of
[2:10:16] the message. I'm talking about your joy
[2:10:19] of the word must be expressed.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Tell it to your face, saints.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. See, it's got to be that.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; I I love his word. I love his word so
[2:10:32] much. I just want to share it. I want to
[2:10:34] fellowship with it. I want unending
[2:10:36] fellowship.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; We've got to be able to see that. not
[2:10:39] forms of religion but actual loving the
[2:10:42] word. I can't wait to wake up in the
[2:10:44] morning after my sleep. My sleep is
[2:10:45] wasting my time. You know, I want to
[2:10:47] wake up in the morning, open my coffee
[2:10:48] and read the word and and and speak to
[2:10:51] someone and express it today. You know,
[2:10:53] I that's what we want to see in the in
[2:10:55] the bride of Christ. That's what we want
[2:10:56] to see among the people.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; As we close this down, testimony of a
[2:11:01] true witness, paragraph 186. What
[2:11:04] church? What's the That's the reason I
[2:11:06] can't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:11:09] of crying, shaking, or speaking in
[2:11:11] tongues or any sensation.
[2:11:14] You hear it straight from the prophet.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; They're all right now. Them things are
[2:11:18] right. But the devil can impersonate
[2:11:20] that so real.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost is deity.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; God tabernacled in men. It's more than a
[2:11:30] sensation. It's more than speaking in
[2:11:32] tongues. is more than shouting in the
[2:11:34] spirit. It's more than weeping. It's
[2:11:36] more than joining church. It's God
[2:11:38] living in man deity. God himself
[2:11:41] tabernacled into that person. When he
[2:11:43] can speak, it's just the same as God
[2:11:46] speaking.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; There's the call. He wants you to speak.
[2:11:51] That's the church of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:53] That's the way the first apostolic
[2:11:54] church went forth. Amen. That this is
[2:11:56] what it is. The prophet is saying, "I
[2:11:59] can't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:12:01] of crying, shaking, speaking tongue,
[2:12:02] sensations.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; What I really want to see is God
[2:12:05] tabernacle deity in men speaking the
[2:12:09] word."
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Uh Corinthians book of correction. We
[2:12:15] notice Paul could teach the Ephesians
[2:12:16] there how that before the foundation of
[2:12:19] the world, they were predestinated unto
[2:12:21] the adoption of sons of God. The
[2:12:23] Corinthians didn't know anything about
[2:12:24] that. They had have a little feeling of
[2:12:27] something, a little sensation, one this
[2:12:29] and that and the other and they depended
[2:12:31] on that. He couldn't teach them the deep
[2:12:34] things.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Here it is. So I think it's great that
[2:12:38] you got people that you can teach deep
[2:12:40] things. Watch this. Taking the word. The
[2:12:44] Holy Spirit can wind these great truths
[2:12:47] and anchor into the people's heart so
[2:12:49] they know where they're standing.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Sensation and no sensation. prophecy or
[2:12:54] no prophecy, whatever it might be, take
[2:12:57] the word, speak the word. The prophet is
[2:13:00] telling us, what I really want to see is
[2:13:02] people you can teach the deep things to.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; They're not shunning it. They're willing
[2:13:08] to take it. They're not fighting against
[2:13:10] it. Seventh seal is not open. How can
[2:13:12] this be? How can this must happen in the
[2:13:15] future? Uh the church goes up in
[2:13:17] Revelations 3 and comes back in 19 and
[2:13:19] nothing in between is to the bride.
[2:13:22] They haven't received the Holy Spirit.
[2:13:24] They haven't received the Holy Ghost for
[2:13:26] this day.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; They have not responded to it because
[2:13:29] there's no word inside. Nothing's giving
[2:13:32] ability to even push the agenda.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Right,
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; saints?
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Why do people feel they need sensations?
[2:13:42] Because they feel they need proof.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; Others around them also feel they need
[2:13:49] proof. Like I'm the minister. I need to
[2:13:50] see proof that you have the Holy Ghost.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; It's a private affair.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; It's between me and God.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. But even myself now, why do I need
[2:14:01] proof?
[2:14:03] Faith doesn't need proof.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; I believe first and evidence follows
[2:14:08] whenever it can.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; But I must believe.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So people feel insecure,
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; They don't they don't understand what's
[2:14:19] going on. They feel they need proof.
[2:14:21] Their feelings are more satisfied when
[2:14:23] they see evidence, visible evidence.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Why can I not be like brother so and so?
[2:14:29] You know, he's so lucky. He's got a
[2:14:31] gift. He's got this or speaking with
[2:14:33] tongues or prophesying or he dreams
[2:14:35] dreams. She sees dreams or he's he has
[2:14:37] visions. What about me? I got nothing.
[2:14:41] Right? So I I feel insecure. I feel
[2:14:44] inferior. I need something. The truth is
[2:14:47] saints, emotions and sensations could
[2:14:50] occur in in a way that reflects a true
[2:14:53] experience. It can the the reason should
[2:14:56] be that the body
[2:14:58] cannot contain the revelation that the
[2:15:00] Holy Spirit brings in you. What I'm
[2:15:02] saying to you is
[2:15:04] there should be some expression.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; When you get the word, when God convicts
[2:15:09] your heart, there should be an
[2:15:10] expression.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; There should be an amen in your soul.
[2:15:14] And and maybe you're struggling with
[2:15:16] complex or something and you you really
[2:15:17] want to scream out, but you just maybe
[2:15:20] feel like raising your hand for now. And
[2:15:23] maybe you feel like you're a little shy
[2:15:25] that somebody is seeing you or that
[2:15:28] you're afraid that somebody is going to
[2:15:30] say something, but there's something
[2:15:32] happening inside. And then there's other
[2:15:34] people who are just boisterous,
[2:15:36] flamboyant, sanguin people who it's
[2:15:39] their character that when anything
[2:15:41] touches them, they're just jumping
[2:15:42] screaming and shouting. It's just
[2:15:44] emotions. It's it's the way they're
[2:15:46] made. They're different. It's emotions.
[2:15:49] It doesn't mean anything
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; to what is going on inside. It's just an
[2:15:55] expression
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; of something.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; But they should be an expression.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That expression indicates the
[2:16:03] worship.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; So the reason it is so dangerous, it is
[2:16:07] because people can have reactions for
[2:16:10] the silliest of things and it's not even
[2:16:12] relevant,
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; right? Anyone can cry because they're
[2:16:16] sorry for what they've done.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; That's good because if you cry and
[2:16:21] you're sorry and you apologize for what
[2:16:23] you've done and you come into church and
[2:16:25] the word convicts you and you cry,
[2:16:27] that's good. It's good that you cry.
[2:16:29] It's good that you come and say, "I'm
[2:16:30] sorry, Lord. I repent. You know, I I
[2:16:33] want to put this right. You come and
[2:16:34] tell the pastor or something. You come
[2:16:35] to the altar and and you raise your
[2:16:37] hands. It's good that you do that. It
[2:16:40] still doesn't mean anything
[2:16:43] unless you have the Holy Spirit in you
[2:16:46] directing you to the word
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; because even a person who does not have
[2:16:50] the Holy Spirit can feel sorry for what
[2:16:52] they did. That's right.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is and always has been
[2:16:59] about the purpose of God.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's the purposeful
[2:17:04] nature.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you've had a reaction of
[2:17:09] sensations, then there must be a life of
[2:17:12] purpose that follows.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; I I don't know if I said this here
[2:17:18] before. Most of the people who hit the
[2:17:22] ground in the Bible were demonpossessed.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Those who willingly went down to the
[2:17:29] ground in the presence of the Lord rose
[2:17:31] up and their lives were never the same
[2:17:33] again.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; They woke up with a purpose.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; They didn't go back to an old lifestyle.
[2:17:39] When Moses bowed his head down because
[2:17:42] the ground he was standing on was holy
[2:17:43] and took off his shoe. When he rose up
[2:17:46] from there, he became a deliverer of a
[2:17:47] nation. He didn't go back to sheep
[2:17:49] farming on the mountain.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the prophet says God
[2:17:54] found him walking around living a life
[2:17:56] of ease.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; This prophet
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; and then he meets the presence of God
[2:18:02] hits the ground in the presence of God
[2:18:04] wakes up with a purpose.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; So if there is an experience or there is
[2:18:08] an expression or there is some kind of
[2:18:11] experience of the Holy Ghost your life
[2:18:13] must have purpose
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; from there on. Amen.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; That's what we need to see. It is a
[2:18:18] purposeful nature.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that saints?
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; If you had a reaction of sensations,
[2:18:27] there must be purpose. That must be
[2:18:29] evident.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Everyone can be anointed with the
[2:18:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the
[2:18:33] earnest. But the Holy Spirit of promise
[2:18:38] does not come upon a person willy-nilly.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; It comes to the elect.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is it has a purpose. It has a
[2:18:46] directive. It leads to something in
[2:18:48] particular. It is the beginning of the
[2:18:51] process of adoption of a son.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're under tutors and
[2:18:58] governors. Go read Galatians chapter 4.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; A son, as long as he's not come to
[2:19:04] maturity, he's just a servant
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; and he's under tutors and governors. But
[2:19:08] then when it comes to the end, he
[2:19:10] receives the spirit
[2:19:12] of the son,
[2:19:15] not gifts. He was under gifts all the
[2:19:18] time, tutors and governors. But now when
[2:19:21] it comes to the process of adoption to
[2:19:23] take purpose
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the will of the father to
[2:19:30] come into that state of adoption you
[2:19:32] have to have the holy spirit within you
[2:19:35] not an anointing the divine nature the
[2:19:38] purpose of god to fulfill the work of
[2:19:41] the father to be an heir of all things.
[2:19:44] It signifies a closing of being under
[2:19:47] tutors and governors and becoming an
[2:19:49] heir of the promise. Saints,
[2:19:52] if we have the full fullness of the
[2:19:55] word, why do we need the baptism of the
[2:19:58] Holy Ghost in operation? I'm not saying
[2:20:01] you mustn't. I'm asking you a question.
[2:20:03] You say, brother Alistister, okay, look,
[2:20:04] we got the fullness of the word now. We
[2:20:06] got the open book. Doesn't that mean we
[2:20:08] don't need the baptism of the Holy
[2:20:09] Ghost? No. You still need ability. The
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Ghost gives ability
[2:20:15] for the present day.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; So that's what anointing is. It is
[2:20:19] ability. Otherwise, we're just sitting
[2:20:21] around doing nothing,
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; right? With all this word feeding us and
[2:20:26] then sitting around doing nothing. You
[2:20:28] need anointing to incentivize you to
[2:20:30] give you direction what you what you
[2:20:32] need to do. It's like at a certain time
[2:20:34] you meet somebody, I don't know whether
[2:20:37] you use a bus stop here in Lima or
[2:20:39] wherever at the grocery store or
[2:20:40] something and somebody comes up to you
[2:20:42] and they notice something about you,
[2:20:44] something unique and they they seem to
[2:20:46] sense there's something different about
[2:20:47] you and they speak to you right there.
[2:20:49] The baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[2:20:50] important
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; because it needs to give you ability
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; to speak to this person, to see their
[2:20:56] soul, to sense what's going on, to speak
[2:20:58] the right word. Because you in your
[2:21:00] right mind, you're still worrying about
[2:21:01] what's happening, about the bills, about
[2:21:03] something that crashed into your car.
[2:21:05] And and right there, you're all
[2:21:07] flustered, you're confused, you're
[2:21:09] looking at a pawpaw and wondering
[2:21:10] whether you should buy it. And someone
[2:21:12] comes up and says, "Hi, I need some
[2:21:16] help.
[2:21:17] You need a baption of the Holy Ghost to
[2:21:19] put all those worries away and focus
[2:21:21] your attention because there's something
[2:21:24] calling and there must be a deep to
[2:21:26] respond.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. There always is a need for
[2:21:31] ability.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; But we don't take the ability and make
[2:21:35] it our God.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is his holy spirit in us which
[2:21:41] is the divine nature that leads us to
[2:21:44] it. So the word is what your soul, if
[2:21:46] you understand who you are, the word in
[2:21:49] your soul is what you are married to.
[2:21:51] This flesh and your mind is not married
[2:21:54] to that word.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; This flesh and this mind needs the
[2:21:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Young people
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; because this flesh and this body and
[2:22:04] mind has different abilities. In my
[2:22:06] life, I had abilities of playing
[2:22:07] cricket, being a sportsman, doing art,
[2:22:11] playing music. You know, playing music
[2:22:14] is a very dangerous thing. If you if you
[2:22:16] have gift or play by ear, you can pick
[2:22:18] up all sorts of tunes and play it. But
[2:22:20] when you get the Holy Ghost, you're
[2:22:21] going to dedicate that gift to only his
[2:22:23] purpose.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; See, but without the Holy Ghost, you're
[2:22:27] just going to drift anywhere with it.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; Right? Those abilities need to be
[2:22:31] reigned in to be used for the purpose of
[2:22:34] the word. Amen.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the word is what your soul is
[2:22:39] married to. But this animal needs the
[2:22:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; This animal needs the anointing. And the
[2:22:47] anointing is what gives it abilities it
[2:22:50] could not ordinarily have. That's why
[2:22:53] it's important. Anyone can be anointed
[2:22:55] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[2:22:57] which is the earnest. But the Holy
[2:22:59] Spirit of promise comes to the elect.
[2:23:01] You believe him, saints? That's why the
[2:23:04] Holy Spirit is necessary. What is the
[2:23:06] Holy Spirit then? It is the influence of
[2:23:10] the word for your day.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; The purposeful nature.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Spirit is nature. The Holy Spirit is the
[2:23:20] influence of the word for your day. And
[2:23:24] that influence is going to cause your
[2:23:26] body and your spirit to fall in line
[2:23:29] with the word that you are married to.
[2:23:31] Yes.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's understand that we came into
[2:23:34] this flesh. Uh born in sin, shapen in
[2:23:38] iniquity, come into this world speaking
[2:23:40] lies as the prophet said. We we uh come
[2:23:44] with our own desires. We have our own
[2:23:46] ideas of things. We have our own way of
[2:23:48] doing things. We sometimes think, well,
[2:23:50] I'm just going to preach this this way
[2:23:52] and you know, people just have to accept
[2:23:54] it and uh this is how I do things. But
[2:23:57] it becomes ineffective unless the Holy
[2:23:59] Spirit is the one guiding us.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand
[2:24:05] why they wrote it differently in the
[2:24:07] Bible?
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference? Do you
[2:24:11] understand the difference between the
[2:24:13] anointing and the person?
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference between
[2:24:17] the ability and the purposeful nature?
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Now, you need to know when you read the
[2:24:24] word, what it is that you have, what it
[2:24:27] is that you seek,
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; what it is that God must give to you,
[2:24:31] what it is that you are lacking. Maybe
[2:24:33] if you have a desire in your heart to do
[2:24:35] something for the gospel, you need
[2:24:37] ability for that. And you need and God's
[2:24:40] ability is not going to be one that must
[2:24:42] bring failure. It must be a success for
[2:24:45] the kingdom.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you're you other a lot of
[2:24:49] people also feel like I want to I want
[2:24:52] to be a preacher but there's just no
[2:24:53] gift there. I want to be a pastor but
[2:24:55] there's just no wisdom in you. I want to
[2:24:58] be a deacon but you're just a big old
[2:25:00] softy who's never going to be able to
[2:25:01] correct anybody.
[2:25:03] And yet in a time of need God can give
[2:25:06] you the Holy Ghost to fulfill that need
[2:25:10] because the word has inspired you beyond
[2:25:12] what you what abilities you have. Yes.
[2:25:16] Sometimes a big old softy can be someone
[2:25:18] who can bring good correction.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; God can do that. Only God can change you
[2:25:23] and people the people will recognize the
[2:25:25] spirit of God has worked in his life.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; You love him saints.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; This is the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[2:25:33] Spirit. The purposeful nature of God.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:41] Glory to God. Let us pray. The musicians
[2:25:45] can come up.
[2:25:48] Dear heavenly father,
[2:25:50] we love you, Lord, with all that is
[2:25:52] within us.
[2:25:54] We give you praise,
[2:25:56] Lord, because you are more than more
[2:25:59] than worthy of all the praise and the
[2:26:01] glory.
[2:26:03] We love you, Lord.
[2:26:05] And yet in our our minds and our heart,
[2:26:10] Lord, we we may not be able to describe
[2:26:13] it or even to know
[2:26:15] or even define so many things about our
[2:26:18] lives.
[2:26:20] But we know one thing. You sent us a
[2:26:23] perfect word. When we look at where
[2:26:26] we've come from, we are reminded that
[2:26:28] you took us from the sheep coat.
[2:26:32] We were people that nobody knew, nobody
[2:26:35] cared for, nobody
[2:26:38] ever thought that we would amount to
[2:26:41] anything. We're still our people in this
[2:26:44] world. People pass us by. We come to
[2:26:47] this place. We are reminded we are the
[2:26:49] bride of Christ. We are the super race.
[2:26:52] We are the the elect.
[2:26:56] And then we drive around in our vehicles
[2:26:58] and go to the shopping markets and malls
[2:27:02] and nobody knows we even exist. Nobody
[2:27:07] cares.
[2:27:08] There's nothing special about us. And we
[2:27:12] look at this and we think, but Peter and
[2:27:16] Paul and those men walked around and
[2:27:18] there was such a great significance.
[2:27:20] Shouldn't there be something that we
[2:27:22] must do? Shouldn't there be something,
[2:27:23] some effect we must make on the world?
[2:27:27] Lord, we we understand.
[2:27:30] We know the time we are living in. Your
[2:27:33] word has been revealed to us.
[2:27:36] Yet, we know there are the
[2:27:39] denominations, the people on the
[2:27:40] outside. Many others would say, well, if
[2:27:44] you are the the chosen people of God,
[2:27:48] why does nobody listen to you? What are
[2:27:50] you doing for the world? How are you
[2:27:52] changing the world? And it gets to us.
[2:27:56] It convicts us. It makes us feel like we
[2:27:59] have to do something.
[2:28:03] But you know why you chose barren woman
[2:28:07] to be the woman of promise to bring
[2:28:10] forth the seed.
[2:28:13] Lord, we were barren for such a long
[2:28:16] time.
[2:28:18] We were people who could not bring
[2:28:20] forth. We were people who thought it was
[2:28:24] nothing to us and others told us that we
[2:28:28] were condemned. We came from families
[2:28:30] who cast us out and persecuted us for
[2:28:34] what we believed.
[2:28:36] But you built us up by your word. You
[2:28:39] brought us the truth. You gave us your
[2:28:41] spirit. You gave us this anointing.
[2:28:45] You gave us your word. You revealed the
[2:28:47] word to us, oh Lord.
[2:28:50] Now we stand before a world and your
[2:28:54] your spirit has shouted out to us. Go
[2:28:57] take the book, eat the book, speak the
[2:29:01] word.
[2:29:04] We know what the purpose is in this last
[2:29:06] days. Lord, I pray I pray for this
[2:29:10] church. I pray for our church. I pray
[2:29:12] for our families. my wife, my children,
[2:29:16] myself,
[2:29:18] my families, my siblings, my friends,
[2:29:22] those of us in in the message.
[2:29:25] Lord, it it looks like we're waiting for
[2:29:28] something to happen.
[2:29:31] We're preaching that something has, but
[2:29:34] it looks like we're waiting on
[2:29:35] something.
[2:29:37] It feels like we're waiting on
[2:29:39] something. And yet, Lord, you have
[2:29:41] commissioned us to do something.
[2:29:45] I pray for the young people. I pray for
[2:29:48] those who have been discouraged. I
[2:29:50] commit us all to you. Lord,
[2:29:53] I am in desperation.
[2:29:57] I am a minister. I'm a pastor of a
[2:29:59] church. But Lord, I need your guidance.
[2:30:03] I need your wisdom. I need your
[2:30:04] strength. I need to know what to do
[2:30:07] tomorrow. I need to do know what to do
[2:30:09] with my life. I need to know what to do
[2:30:10] for the next 10 years of my life. should
[2:30:13] you tarry? What must I do with your
[2:30:15] word? How can I bring this word to your
[2:30:18] people? How can I incentivize your
[2:30:20] children? How can I help to build your
[2:30:24] children up to to bring them to a place
[2:30:26] where they can speak the word fearlessly
[2:30:29] and share this wonderful truth with
[2:30:32] those around them?
[2:30:34] Lord God, I pray that you would anoint
[2:30:38] your children once again.
[2:30:41] Bring that purposeful spirit within us,
[2:30:44] Lord, that we might have direction. We
[2:30:47] might have purpose. That we might be
[2:30:49] holy even as you are holy. I want to be
[2:30:53] committed to your purpose, oh God. Not
[2:30:55] my own agenda, not my own ambitions, not
[2:30:58] my own career. I want my will to be
[2:31:01] aligned with your will.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; I want to have the ability to choose
[2:31:06] your will for my life's path.
[2:31:10] Lord, I don't want to walk my own way. I
[2:31:13] want to be anointed by your Holy Spirit.
[2:31:16] I want to have your Holy Spirit dwelling
[2:31:18] within me and giving me the direction I
[2:31:20] need. Lord God, I pray for all these
[2:31:24] your children bowed in your presence
[2:31:25] today. Anoint us, oh Lord. Bring us to
[2:31:28] that place where we are no longer
[2:31:30] confused, where we are not trapped by
[2:31:33] the enemy to trying to make us think
[2:31:35] that we should have some anointing for a
[2:31:37] different day.
[2:31:39] Lord, make us realize what it is that
[2:31:41] you have for us today.
[2:31:44] Bless us today, Father God, as we leave
[2:31:45] this place. Let these few simple things
[2:31:49] make things clearer for us. That we
[2:31:51] might understand, that we might follow
[2:31:53] behind the word for this day. That we
[2:31:55] might see what the anointing should be
[2:31:58] around the word that you have revealed
[2:32:00] for us. Bless the pastor of this church.
[2:32:03] Bless the people.
[2:32:05] Lord, we all need help. We all need
[2:32:07] strength to continue and we believe that
[2:32:11] you will lead us through to the very
[2:32:13] end. Bless us now, Father. We ask it in
[2:32:16] your precious name with much praise and
[2:32:18] thanksgiving. Amen. And amen.
[2:32:23] Praise be to God.
[2:32:25] Let's sing that song. Holy Spirit, thou
[2:32:27] would welcome in this place as brother
[2:32:29] Chad would come.
[2:32:33] Holy
[2:32:37] Spirit, Holy Spirit,
[2:32:40] thou art well.
[2:32:43] Come in
[2:32:45] this place.
[2:32:48] Holy Spirit,
[2:32:51] thou art well.
[2:32:54] Amen.
[2:32:57] This we stand and raise our hands.
[2:33:01] Amate
[2:33:04] Father
[2:33:07] of mercy
[2:33:09] and grace.
[2:33:12] Thou art welcome
[2:33:16] in
[2:33:18] this place.
[2:33:22] One more time.
[2:33:24] Holy Spirit
[2:33:27] now and well
[2:33:30] in
[2:33:32] this place.
[2:33:35] Holy Spirit,
[2:33:38] thou art welcome
[2:33:42] in
[2:33:44] his place.
[2:33:47] Omnipotent
[2:33:51] Father
[2:33:53] of mercy
[2:33:56] and grace.
[2:33:58] Thou art welcome
[2:34:01] [Music]
[2:34:02] in
[2:34:04] this place.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:11] Man, we're going to sing that song
[2:34:12] again. But as we do, I think you're all
[2:34:15] thinking the same thought as me. We
[2:34:17] don't want him to be welcome in this
[2:34:18] building.
[2:34:20] We want him to be welcome in this place.
[2:34:23] When we sing it, we want to sing it. You
[2:34:25] know, the Bible says that you shall
[2:34:27] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And
[2:34:30] remember, I remember uh uh I think it
[2:34:33] was brother Charlie Cox in his
[2:34:34] testimony. Brother Brenham had preached
[2:34:37] a series that uh brother Alistister
[2:34:39] quoted from. What is the Holy Ghost and
[2:34:42] what is the Holy Ghost given for? And
[2:34:44] during that series, Charlie Cox, he
[2:34:46] wanted to receive the baptism of the
[2:34:47] Holy Ghost so bad. He just couldn't
[2:34:50] break through. He would go out and walk
[2:34:51] in the woods and and and he just
[2:34:54] couldn't seem to get it. And he went to
[2:34:56] brother Brandham and he asked Brother
[2:34:57] Brandham about it. And this is in
[2:34:59] Charlie Cox's testimony. And brother, he
[2:35:01] asked him, "Why can't I seem to get it?"
[2:35:03] And brother Bham just stopped for a
[2:35:05] minute.
[2:35:06] And then he then he answered Charlie. He
[2:35:08] said, "Charlie, you know when you're out
[2:35:09] walking in the woods and praying and you
[2:35:11] know you feel that sweet presence around
[2:35:13] you." He said, "That's him. Just open
[2:35:16] your heart and let him in. That's it."
[2:35:19] Charlie said he went back the next time
[2:35:21] he went to pray and as he went on the
[2:35:23] woods and prayed, he felt that sweet
[2:35:24] presence and he says then he just opened
[2:35:26] it. He said, "I got it." Brother Ben
[2:35:28] made it so easy because it's a gift.
[2:35:32] you're repentant or baptized in the name
[2:35:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ, you shall
[2:35:35] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And
[2:35:37] a gift is something given, but a gift is
[2:35:39] something that has to be received.
[2:35:42] How many want to be baptized, washed
[2:35:45] from all your own thinking and all your
[2:35:47] own ideas and separated, washed away
[2:35:49] from everything else that's carnal and
[2:35:51] everything else that I ever had and
[2:35:53] wants to receive another nature that
[2:35:55] lines up with God's nature and give our
[2:35:58] tabernacle for him to live his life
[2:36:01] inside of us. Amen. If we have that
[2:36:04] desire with all of our hearts, just open
[2:36:06] up and let that desire be known to God
[2:36:08] and let him come in and take possession
[2:36:10] of us and let him anoint us for that
[2:36:12] purpose and let him drive our lives and
[2:36:15] the purpose of his word. Amen. Let's
[2:36:18] just sing that song again. But don't
[2:36:19] make it this place.
[2:36:22] Make it this place. Amen. Let's sing
[2:36:24] that once again. be like, "Holy Spirit,
[2:36:29] thou art welcome
[2:36:33] in
[2:36:35] this place.
[2:36:38] Holy Spirit,
[2:36:41] thou art welcome
[2:36:45] in
[2:36:47] this place."
[2:36:50] A pivot
[2:36:53] father
[2:36:56] of mercy
[2:36:58] and grace.
[2:37:01] Thou are welcome
[2:37:05] in
[2:37:07] this place.
[2:37:09] [Music]
[2:37:12] Holy Spirit,
[2:37:15] thou art welcome
[2:37:19] in
[2:37:21] this place.
[2:37:24] Holy Spirit,
[2:37:26] thou art welcome
[2:37:30] in
[2:37:32] this place.
[2:37:36] A libert
[2:37:38] [Music]
[2:37:41] of mercy
[2:37:44] and grace.
[2:37:46] Thou art welcome
[2:37:50] in
[2:37:52] this place.
[2:37:56] Let's just bow our heads together as we
[2:37:58] close. Dear heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[2:38:01] we thank you for speaking to us of your
[2:38:04] word again, Lord.
[2:38:06] And God, I pray that you would help us,
[2:38:09] Lord, to just open our hearts to you, to
[2:38:11] surrender more than we've ever
[2:38:12] surrendered before.
[2:38:15] God, that you would give us a true
[2:38:16] revelation of your word and what you're
[2:38:18] trying to do in each one of us. And may
[2:38:21] we surrender to that purpose, Lord.
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, may we catch the revelation of
[2:38:26] what you want, Lord. We want your
[2:38:28] anointing upon our lives absolutely
[2:38:30] every day. But God, we know we need more
[2:38:32] than just an anointing. We need your
[2:38:34] very person inside of us. Lord, we need
[2:38:37] you to quicken the life that you placed
[2:38:39] in us before the foundation of the
[2:38:40] world. We need you to marry to us, Lord,
[2:38:42] to be married, to be joined as one with
[2:38:45] our souls, Lord. God, we need the
[2:38:48] anointing every day of our lives, but we
[2:38:50] need the anointing to bring life, Lord.
[2:38:52] Life within us, your life inside of us,
[2:38:55] Lord. And God, I pray that you would,
[2:38:58] Lord, fill us with your spirit, that you
[2:39:00] would quicken us to life, that you would
[2:39:02] unify yourself with your attribute
[2:39:04] that's in us, and that you would abide
[2:39:08] in us, Lord. That you would take up
[2:39:10] residence in us, that we would be
[2:39:12] tabernacling deity, Lord. That the
[2:39:15] reality of the message would be alive in
[2:39:17] us. That it wouldn't be something that
[2:39:19] we just believe, but it would be
[2:39:20] something that we are, Lord. that we
[2:39:22] become one with the word. And we become
[2:39:24] the word by allowing you access to us.
[2:39:28] And God, with that, we need your
[2:39:30] anointing every day of our lives so that
[2:39:32] we can manifest your life and your
[2:39:34] purpose.
[2:39:36] God, let your spirit abide in us and on
[2:39:39] us and all around us. Inspire us, anoint
[2:39:42] us, quicken us, use us, and live your
[2:39:45] life inside of us, Lord. God, we want to
[2:39:49] surrender. We want to die out. We want
[2:39:51] to give up everything that's not holy,
[2:39:54] that's not sanctified and set aside and
[2:39:56] dedicated for your purpose. We want to
[2:39:58] die to all of that. Wash it away from
[2:40:01] us, Lord, with the baptism of the Holy
[2:40:03] Ghost, with the Holy Ghost and fire.
[2:40:05] Burn out of us every wrong desire and
[2:40:07] every wrong vision of our lives and
[2:40:09] every wrong purpose that we've gained
[2:40:11] through this world. And may you burn
[2:40:12] into us that one vision, that one
[2:40:15] purpose, that desire you had of us
[2:40:17] before the foundation of the world. May
[2:40:20] we receive it now, Lord. May you fill
[2:40:22] all your children. May you anoint anoint
[2:40:25] us for that purpose you've called us to.
[2:40:27] May we walk in that anointing and in
[2:40:29] that purpose. God, I pray that you would
[2:40:32] bless, Lord, your children. Bless our
[2:40:34] brother Alistister and his wife. God, as
[2:40:37] they continue their journey with more
[2:40:39] ministry before they go home, I pray you
[2:40:41] watch over them and use them. And may
[2:40:43] you bless them and inspire him again.
[2:40:46] And for each one of us, Lord, as we walk
[2:40:48] out of here, may we walk out, Lord, with
[2:40:50] a clear vision and understanding of what
[2:40:52] you're trying to do in this hour, what
[2:40:55] your desire is, what your heart is, and
[2:40:56] what your your heart for us is.
[2:40:59] And may it be manifest and fulfilled in
[2:41:02] each one of us. Lord, we surrender to
[2:41:04] you. We give ourselves to you. We ask
[2:41:07] for everything that was preached to be a
[2:41:09] living reality inside of us, Lord. For
[2:41:12] we surrender to that purpose. I love
[2:41:15] you, Lord. I thank you God for this
[2:41:17] message of this hour for the awakening
[2:41:20] Lord for you sharing your heart the the
[2:41:23] mystery you had of yourself in the back
[2:41:25] part of your mind and how you shared it
[2:41:27] with us because we are part of that
[2:41:29] mystery. May it become more of a reality
[2:41:32] to us every hour of the day. We love you
[2:41:36] Lord. We thank you for your love. We
[2:41:39] thank you for living in this hour when
[2:41:41] these things are possible. Lord, we
[2:41:44] thank you for a word that has washed us,
[2:41:46] for your spirit that has cleansed us,
[2:41:49] Lord, for for your presence that will
[2:41:51] fill us and live in us. God, we
[2:41:54] appreciate so much the things you've
[2:41:56] allowed us to hear. And may they become
[2:41:59] our experience, Lord. Pray your pleasant
[2:42:02] presence would be with your people as we
[2:42:04] go from here. And may this living
[2:42:06] reality grow in us day by day. Oh, we
[2:42:10] love you. We thank you. We ask your
[2:42:12] blessings over it all. In Jesus Christ's
[2:42:15] name we pray. Amen.
[2:42:18] Amen. God bless you all. Been such a
[2:42:21] privilege to worship God with you. Amen.
[2:42:24] It's been such a privilege to hear the
[2:42:26] word of God. Amen. But I don't want to
[2:42:29] be a hearer only. I want to be a doer. I
[2:42:33] want it to live inside of me. Amen. God
[2:42:36] bless you for the bless.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; Just sing that one more time. Holy
[2:42:40] Spirit,
[2:42:43] thou art welcome
[2:42:47] in
[2:42:49] this place.
[2:42:52] Holy Spirit,
[2:42:55] thou art welcome
[2:42:59] in
[2:43:01] this place.
[2:43:04] All inent
[2:43:08] father
[2:43:10] of mercy
[2:43:13] and grace.
[2:43:15] Thou are welcome
[2:43:19] in
[2:43:21] this place. Lord in thy presence
[2:43:27] and the Lord in thy presence
[2:43:32] is healing.
[2:43:36] [Applause]
[2:43:39] No other
[2:43:42] power
[2:43:44] can save Lord my life.
[2:43:52] Holy Spirit,
[2:43:55] thou are welcome
[2:43:59] in
[2:44:01] this place.
[2:44:03] You are welcome
[2:44:06] [Music]
[2:44:07] in
[2:44:09] this place
[2:44:14] and fill up the hungry
[2:44:21] and empty
[2:44:23] within.
[2:44:26] Restore
[2:44:27] us, oh father,
[2:44:32] revive us
[2:44:35] again.
[2:44:40] Holy Spirit,
[2:44:42] thou art welcome
[2:44:46] in
[2:44:48] this place.
[2:44:51] Now our world
[2:44:55] in
[2:44:57] this place.
