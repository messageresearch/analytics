[6:50] service this evening we pray in jesus
[6:52] christ's name
[6:54] amen
[6:55] and god bless you while we're standing
[6:57] let's take our bibles and turn to the
[6:59] book of revelation revelation chapter 21
[7:05] at the end of service we're going to
[7:06] have a baptism this evening so praise
[7:08] god
[7:09] uh peter brooks desires to be baptized
[7:11] in the name of the lord jesus christ so
[7:14] we're excited for him and for his family
[7:16] and for brother bob because brother bob
[7:18] is grandpa has the honors of doing the
[7:19] baptism so it's a special privilege for
[7:22] him and so we're excited for the whole
[7:24] family so it'll be right after the
[7:26] service
[7:27] also want to let you know that the
[7:29] fellowship hall is now open so this
[7:31] sunday for the communion service if
[7:34] you'd like to do like we've done in the
[7:35] past if you want to go out and get a
[7:37] lunch and bring it back or you want to
[7:38] pack a lunch for your family and bring
[7:40] it the fellowship hall will be open and
[7:42] the tables will be open in there and
[7:44] feel free to use that kitchen's not
[7:46] completely done yet but the fellowship
[7:47] hall is open and we can use that for
[7:50] communion
[7:51] so may the lord
[7:53] bless us next week or sunday in that
[7:56] let's look at revelation 21
[7:59] verse 6 as we begin
[8:03] 21-6 i'm going to read verse 6-7
[8:07] and he said unto me it is done
[8:09] i am alpha and omega the beginning in
[8:11] the end i will give unto him that is a
[8:13] thirst of the fountain of the water of
[8:16] life freely
[8:17] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[8:19] things and i will be his god
[8:22] and he shall be my son
[8:24] remember the lord adds blessing to the
[8:25] reading of the word as you take your
[8:27] seats
[8:28] we read this
[8:29] verse from sunday and i want to continue
[8:31] just a little bit with that thought and
[8:33] move on from there but we know that he
[8:36] that overcometh
[8:37] shall inherit all things and the prophet
[8:40] of god told us overcoming is not when
[8:42] when everything is done for us and when
[8:45] god pushes us into a tube and pulls us
[8:47] out the other side and he did it all we
[8:49] say we overcome you didn't overcome
[8:50] there was nothing to overcome but yet
[8:53] there's things in life obstacles and
[8:55] life and situations and we have free
[8:57] choice and god wants us to choose his
[8:59] word and in choosing the word we're
[9:01] overcoming amen
[9:03] and if we're overcoming in the age that
[9:05] we live in by the word then we get the
[9:07] reward of the overcomers amen and so we
[9:10] talked about that through the church
[9:11] ages in revelation uh chapters two and
[9:14] three all the reward to the overcomer
[9:17] and each age are available to us if
[9:19] we'll overcome in our age
[9:22] so let's look at the revelation chapter
[9:24] 12.
[9:26] we're going to read another portion of
[9:27] scripture in revelation 12
[9:29] and verse 7.
[9:38] and there was war in heaven
[9:41] michael and his angels fought against
[9:43] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[9:45] angels
[9:46] and prevailed not neither was their
[9:47] place found anymore in heaven
[9:50] and the great dragon was cast out that
[9:52] old serpent called the devil and satan
[9:55] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[9:56] cast out into the earth and his angels
[9:58] were cast out with him and we know that
[10:01] the the scene takes place at the rapture
[10:03] of the bride when the bride goes up
[10:05] satan comes down and he incarnates as
[10:07] superman and then becomes the beast so
[10:10] we know the transition that's taking
[10:12] place here and it's important to know as
[10:13] we move on in the scriptures and in
[10:16] verse 10 it says i heard a loud voice
[10:17] saying in heaven now has come salvation
[10:20] and strength
[10:21] and the kingdom of our god and the power
[10:23] of his christ for the accuser of our
[10:25] brethren is cast down which accused him
[10:27] before our god day and night
[10:29] and they overcame him who is they
[10:33] the brethren amen the ones that he was
[10:35] accusing they overcame him by the blood
[10:39] of the lamb and by the word of their
[10:42] testimony
[10:43] amen if you're going to be an overcomer
[10:46] there's something that you get to do as
[10:48] part of the overcoming amen the blood of
[10:50] the lamb was shed for you you had
[10:52] nothing to do with that amen that was
[10:54] done in god's mind before the foundation
[10:56] of the world it was manifest 2 000 years
[10:58] ago on calvary and the blood of the lamb
[11:00] was shed for you on your behalf for your
[11:03] redemption amen but they overcame him by
[11:05] the blood of the lamb and
[11:08] amen
[11:09] and the word of their testimony amen and
[11:12] if we want the promise that comes to the
[11:14] overcomer amen then we must recognize
[11:17] the blood that was shed for us god did
[11:19] that for us amen that was the lamb of
[11:21] god the son of god that shed his own
[11:23] blood for us for our redemption that was
[11:25] done for us now what do i do amen we
[11:28] must overcome by the blood of lamb and
[11:30] the word of my testimony
[11:36] and
[11:37] the word
[11:38] of their testimony
[11:42] and they loved not their lives
[11:44] unto death
[11:46] they were willing to surrender all
[11:49] death to self a complete surrender no
[11:52] more me but all of
[11:54] him verse 12 therefore rejoice ye
[11:58] heavens and ye that dwell in them woe
[12:00] unto the inhabiters of the earth and the
[12:02] sea for the devil has come down unto you
[12:04] having great wrath because he knoweth
[12:06] that he hath but a short time
[12:09] i'd like to take out of this portion of
[12:11] scripture for a title for a text
[12:14] our testimony
[12:16] and then also the father's business
[12:19] we're going to get to that later
[12:20] our testimony
[12:22] and then the father's business
[12:25] this word testimony that we read here in
[12:28] verse 11 they overcame him by the blood
[12:30] of the lamb and by the word of their
[12:32] testimony this word testimony it comes
[12:35] from a root word that we'll get to in a
[12:37] few minutes
[12:38] but it means
[12:40] a testifying
[12:43] the office committed to the prophets of
[12:45] testifying concerning future events and
[12:47] also one who testifies testimony before
[12:51] a judge
[12:52] so this testimony is not just saying
[12:56] you know god is good and and and you
[12:58] know he created all things and
[12:59] everything's wonderful but it's actually
[13:01] a witness amen giving a witness as
[13:04] before a judge or testify that your
[13:07] testimony now is standing in judgment
[13:10] amen so they overcame him not just by
[13:13] whimsical uh uh uh um uh saying good
[13:17] positive things but they actually were
[13:18] giving a testimony before a judgment
[13:20] seat and they were testifying of the
[13:23] word and they were overcoming by the
[13:25] blood of the lamb and by their testimony
[13:30] so you know i think the the devil was
[13:32] being judged
[13:34] by the testimony of these witnesses
[13:39] let's go to the book of acts i want to
[13:41] pick up this root word here in acts
[13:44] chapter 1.
[13:46] this word testimony in chapter 11 comes
[13:49] from a root word which we're going to
[13:51] read here in acts chapter 1
[13:53] and it'll help us
[13:54] get the meaning of this
[13:58] acts chapter 1
[14:00] and verse 6.
[14:09] acts chapter 1 and verse 6.
[14:13] when they therefore were come together
[14:14] they asked of him saying lord will thou
[14:16] at this time restore again the kingdom
[14:18] to israel
[14:19] and he said unto them it is not for you
[14:21] to know the times or the seasons which
[14:23] the father hath put in his power
[14:26] but you shall receive power after that
[14:28] the holy ghost has come upon you and you
[14:30] shall be witnesses there it is this is
[14:33] the root word that testimony their
[14:35] testimony is taken from you shall be
[14:38] witnesses unto me both in jerusalem in
[14:40] all judea and in samaria and in the
[14:43] uttermost parts of the earth so christ
[14:46] is telling them you're going to receive
[14:48] power when the holy ghost has come upon
[14:50] you and what was the ending of power
[14:52] supposed to do the undoing of power was
[14:54] to turn them into witnesses for him
[14:57] that's what the power of the indwelling
[14:59] of the holy ghost does amen it makes you
[15:01] a witness of the life of jesus christ it
[15:03] makes you a witness of the revelation of
[15:06] the word for your day and now you can
[15:08] overcome by your testimony amen because
[15:11] now you're witnessing of his life
[15:14] because his life now is in you
[15:16] so he said you shall be witnesses this
[15:18] word witnesses in the greek
[15:20] it means a witness simply a witness and
[15:23] a legal sense or historical sense
[15:26] somebody that is a witness to something
[15:28] and so the christ was going to give the
[15:31] power shall come upon you amen when when
[15:34] the holy ghost has come upon you you
[15:36] shall receive power that you can be
[15:39] these witnesses
[15:40] so how do they overcame by the blood of
[15:43] the lamb
[15:44] and by the word of their testimony
[15:48] let's go to hebrews chapter 3
[15:51] there's a principle that the prophet of
[15:53] god lays down that i just want to
[15:55] touch on as we move
[15:58] through these scriptures
[16:00] hebrews chapter 3
[16:03] verse 1.
[16:08] hebrews chapter 3 verse 1 wherefore holy
[16:11] brother and partakers of the heavenly
[16:12] calling consider the apostle and high
[16:15] priest of our profession christ jesus
[16:18] that word profession means confession
[16:21] and he's the high priest of our
[16:23] confession or our profession let's look
[16:26] over at chapter 4 verse 14. in hebrews
[16:28] chapter 4 verse 14
[16:31] seeing then that we have a great high
[16:33] priest that has passed into the heavens
[16:34] jesus the son of god let us hold fast
[16:37] our profession
[16:39] here's what the prophet says about these
[16:41] scriptures he says now remember
[16:43] every redemptive blessing has already
[16:45] been purchased
[16:47] the price is paid there there's only one
[16:49] way that you'll ever be able to receive
[16:51] it is to believe it and accept it he's
[16:53] the high priest of our confession the
[16:55] hebrew says here the hebrew letter says
[16:56] he's the high priest of our profession
[16:58] to profess and confess is the same thing
[17:00] of course he's the high priest of our
[17:02] confession therefore we cannot do
[17:04] anything for us until first we confess
[17:07] that he has done it
[17:09] and then when we confess it then he is
[17:11] the high priest and mediator to go to
[17:13] work on that and make it right so we
[17:15] pray trusting in god tonight in his
[17:18] kindness and mercy that he will give to
[17:20] us his abundance of grace tonight and
[17:22] now remember you must accept it
[17:26] the book of proverbs verse 18 i'm going
[17:28] to quote the scripture to proverbs 18 21
[17:31] says death and life are in the power of
[17:33] the tongue and they that love it and
[17:36] they that love it shall eat the fruit
[17:38] thereof so there's there's something
[17:41] that god is asking us to do to be a
[17:43] witness and witness in word and witness
[17:45] in life to give a true witness and a
[17:47] true testimony in the day and age in
[17:49] which we live and it's part of our
[17:52] overcoming amen and part of this
[17:55] overcoming of the brethren is the very
[17:57] thing that caused the casting down of
[18:00] satan out of heaven into the earth it is
[18:03] because there's a people amen who will
[18:05] overcome by the blood of the lamb and
[18:07] the word of their testimony
[18:09] but we have a high priest amen he's a
[18:12] high priest uh uh they'll be faithful to
[18:14] our profession and that means brother
[18:16] branham says it this way let's let me
[18:19] pick it up here in this other quote he
[18:21] says and then they go testifying making
[18:23] their testimony ring out and you can be
[18:26] the high priest and you can be the high
[18:28] priest brother is praying and you are
[18:30] the high priest of their profession now
[18:32] when they can truly from their heart
[18:33] believe that you have did the work we
[18:35] know as far as the work itself is
[18:37] already finished but to appropriate
[18:39] faith to believe all things are possible
[18:42] to them believe he also says in the
[18:44] message perseverance notice now when
[18:46] jesus was here on earth he made the
[18:48] sacrifice for healing and for salvation
[18:51] do you believe that
[18:52] jesus could not come tonight and save
[18:54] you he has already done it
[18:57] the sin question was settled he is the
[18:59] lamb of god that took away the sins of
[19:01] the world he was wounded for our
[19:03] transgression with his stripes we were
[19:05] healed it is past tense no matter how
[19:08] much you would scream out and how much
[19:10] you would could scream out that wouldn't
[19:12] do a bit of good until you accept him
[19:14] and he is the high priest sitting at the
[19:16] right hand of majesty on high to make
[19:18] intercession in our profession you've
[19:20] got to accept it and profess it that's
[19:23] correct same way by healing
[19:26] so he's the high priest of our
[19:27] profession but if we have no testimony
[19:29] no profession there's nothing for him to
[19:32] go to work on and bring to pass in our
[19:33] lives so if they overcome him by by by
[19:36] the blood of the lamb in the word of
[19:38] their testimony there has to be a
[19:40] testimony coming forth amen that is
[19:42] bringing christ on the scene to empower
[19:44] that testimony to bring it past
[19:47] and if there's a testimony that'll be
[19:50] you know the final voice in the final
[19:52] age and the final part of the gentile
[19:54] bride she has to have a word of
[19:56] testimony that'll bring him down amen
[19:59] there has to be a power amen given to
[20:01] her to be a witness of the word that's
[20:03] given to us in this day not repeating
[20:06] from previous ages the previous ages had
[20:09] the word for their day amen that would
[20:11] give them the power to overcome in that
[20:13] day amen but the the word has been
[20:15] growing and been growing and growing and
[20:18] it's growing until there'll be a people
[20:20] on the earth that have a testimony
[20:23] that'll be the final overcoming of that
[20:25] devil amen
[20:28] but it's not going to be secret
[20:29] believers
[20:31] who hide out secretly and say i believe
[20:34] in all that and it's not going to be
[20:36] repeating what worked in previous
[20:38] dispensations in previous church ages
[20:40] amen because that had victory in that
[20:42] day but yet he's still there as the
[20:44] accuser of the brethren so there has to
[20:45] be a climbing of this testimony a
[20:48] climbing of this witnessing of the word
[20:50] until it climbs and it climbs and it
[20:52] climbs and christ is there constantly as
[20:55] the high priest of the profession of the
[20:57] believers bringing it to pass bringing
[20:59] it to pass bringing it to pass amen and
[21:02] now we know why in this end time he sent
[21:04] a prophet of god to restore the word to
[21:06] us because it's going to take a full
[21:08] measure of the revelation of the word to
[21:10] bring a full victory in this day
[21:14] it's not the day of partial partial word
[21:17] didn't bring the full victory but the
[21:19] day of the full word amen there's be a
[21:21] people on the earth that will believe
[21:23] that word and the fullness of its power
[21:25] and they will express it in life they
[21:27] will express it in word they will
[21:29] express it in action they will be a
[21:31] there'll be a true testimony of the word
[21:33] in this day and he'll be the high priest
[21:37] of their profession
[21:40] and it will have the attendant effect
[21:42] for they will overcome him by the blood
[21:44] of the lamb
[21:45] and the word of their testimony
[21:48] let's go to romans chapter 10.
[22:06] romans chapter 10
[22:10] verse 8.
[22:13] but what saith that the word is nigh
[22:15] thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart
[22:17] that is the word of faith which we
[22:19] preach
[22:20] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[22:22] mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe
[22:23] in thine heart that god hath raised him
[22:25] from the dead thou shalt be saved
[22:28] for with the heart man believeth in the
[22:30] righteousness
[22:31] and with the mouth confession is made
[22:33] unto salvation
[22:35] if you look at this scripture the
[22:37] apostle paul was actually speaking of
[22:39] two sides of salvation
[22:42] first a man must believe in his heart
[22:46] but he must confess with his mouth
[22:49] the believing in your heart that is a
[22:52] gift from god
[22:54] by grace are we saved through faith and
[22:56] that is a gift of god not of ourselves
[22:58] it is a gift of god so the ability to
[23:00] believe the word is a gift of god amen
[23:02] so the fact that we can believe the word
[23:05] is a gift of god but paul doesn't leave
[23:08] it there amen there was two parts to
[23:10] what paul was saying that man shall
[23:12] believeth amen but he shall speaketh
[23:15] let's read it again
[23:17] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[23:19] mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe
[23:20] in thine heart that god hath raised him
[23:22] from the dead thou shalt be saved so
[23:24] it's not just speaking without actual
[23:27] faith in the heart that won't get
[23:28] anywhere but saying i believe in my
[23:30] heart with no positive confession that
[23:32] doesn't get anywhere either but when the
[23:34] heart and the confession match amen paul
[23:37] is saying that's salvation amen
[23:42] verse 10 for with the heart man
[23:44] believeth unto righteousness and with
[23:46] the mouth confession is made into
[23:48] salvation
[23:49] this goes right to revelation that we
[23:52] read they overcame by the blood of the
[23:53] lamb and the word of their testimony
[23:58] there has to be a witness that's been
[24:00] empowered by the holy ghost
[24:03] not empowered by the holy ghost just for
[24:05] selfish reasons and and for whatever
[24:08] purposes we want and but for to be a
[24:10] witness that's why this power has come
[24:14] because it's in this testimony
[24:16] that lucifer is going to lose his
[24:17] position
[24:19] the devil's going to be cast down
[24:22] let's go to revelation chapter 10 now
[24:29] because the question is what are we
[24:30] going to witness
[24:33] you're going to witness what
[24:34] everything's been witnessed before
[24:37] what helped lucifer or what helped
[24:40] luther overcome and what helped wesley
[24:42] overcome and well the pentecost was
[24:43] overcome yeah that's part of that but
[24:45] there's more there's building up into
[24:47] the full measure of christ and to the
[24:49] headship of christ amen and victory
[24:52] keeps growing and growing and growing as
[24:55] the word grows until we come to complete
[24:57] victory
[25:00] revelations 10 7
[25:02] but in the days of the voice of the
[25:04] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[25:06] sound the mystery of god should be
[25:08] finished that he hath declared to his
[25:10] servants the prophets this scripture
[25:12] scripture's so important to us because
[25:14] it's the day and age we live in
[25:16] the seventh angel has come amen the
[25:18] prophet of god has come and the mystery
[25:21] of god has been finished amen and
[25:23] there's been the opening of the of the
[25:24] seven seals the seven thunders have
[25:26] sounded and the mystery that is laying
[25:28] in the whole book has has been revealed
[25:32] but god doesn't leave it there that
[25:34] wasn't the ending amen of
[25:37] of of of god's work here in revelation
[25:40] chapter 10 because we go to revelation
[25:42] chapter 8. it says in the voice which i
[25:44] heard from heaven spake unto me again
[25:46] and said go and take the little book
[25:48] which is open in the hand of the angel
[25:50] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[25:53] earth and i went to the angel and said
[25:55] unto him give me the little book and he
[25:57] said unto me take it and eat it up and
[25:59] it shall make thy belly bitter but it
[26:02] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[26:06] so we we all know that john is the type
[26:08] of the bride and now this mighty angel
[26:11] is christ and he's come down with an
[26:13] open book and he's thundered out seven
[26:15] thunders he roars as a lion roars and
[26:18] seven thunder sounded their voices and
[26:20] john was told to write it not don't
[26:22] write that but seal it up to the time of
[26:24] the end so at the end time whatever
[26:26] those sons the seven thunders uttered
[26:28] has to be revealed at the end time
[26:31] and as it's revealed amen it's unlocking
[26:35] the mystery of the bible and as it
[26:37] unlocks the mystery of the bible it is
[26:39] unlocking the revelation that was laying
[26:42] under the seals the revelation that that
[26:45] contained the entire bible which is the
[26:47] mystery of god
[26:49] and the mystery of god was laying under
[26:51] those seals amen and christ comes with
[26:53] an open book in his hand and he roars
[26:56] and seven thunder's utter but there's
[26:58] going to come a time when there's a
[26:59] seventh angel on the earth and in the
[27:01] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[27:03] the mystery of god shall be finished
[27:05] amen there'll be the revelation of the
[27:08] seven thunders amen and after the
[27:10] revelation of the seven thunders go in
[27:12] the seventh angels ministry amen then
[27:14] there's going to be an opportunity for
[27:17] john the bride to go to that angel
[27:20] christ and say give me that book amen
[27:22] the open book not the closed book not
[27:25] the not not the one that's been sealed
[27:27] away amen for seven church ages not the
[27:29] one that's been lost under creeds and
[27:31] dogmas of man but the one that's been
[27:33] restored back and opened up and the
[27:35] seals peeled off give me that book amen
[27:38] now that it's open it's open to do what
[27:40] it's open to reveal the mystery of god
[27:44] not just a bunch of details not a bunch
[27:46] of facts and figures but that book
[27:48] opened to reveal the mystery of god what
[27:51] was this mystery through the whole bible
[27:53] what was it all about what was god's
[27:55] plan why did god do everything he did in
[27:57] creation why did he make things the way
[27:59] he did why the fall why the trees why
[28:02] why everything that's the mystery laying
[28:05] underneath the seals
[28:07] the open book contains the mystery of
[28:09] god
[28:12] and now
[28:13] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[28:15] angel when he sounds the mystery of
[28:16] god's complete now there's instructions
[28:19] that are given to the bride
[28:22] now you go to that christ
[28:25] the angel of the covenant christ
[28:30] and john goes to him says give me the
[28:32] book
[28:33] he says take it
[28:35] and eat it up
[28:37] take it and devour it take it and become
[28:40] one with it
[28:42] take it into your person
[28:45] feed on it become one with it take it
[28:47] inside of you amen don't hold it don't
[28:50] show it to others don't use it as
[28:51] something to brag about amen don't say i
[28:53] got the book i got the book amen take it
[28:56] inside of you amen
[28:58] feed on it and become one with the book
[29:01] amen and as you feed on it it'll be
[29:03] sweet as the revelations are coming it
[29:06] is sweet amen but when you go to testify
[29:09] when you go to live amen what this book
[29:11] is revealed then you're going to find
[29:13] rejection and you're going to find
[29:14] difficulty and you're going to find all
[29:17] kinds of horrible things it's going to
[29:19] be bitter in your belly as you digest
[29:22] this revelation and as this revelation
[29:24] becomes your life
[29:32] verse 10
[29:34] and i took the little book out of the
[29:36] angel's hand and ate it up
[29:38] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[29:41] as soon as i had eaten it my belly was
[29:43] bitter
[29:44] and he said unto me
[29:46] thou
[29:46] must prophesy again
[29:50] before many peoples and nations
[29:53] and tongues
[29:55] and kings
[29:58] and if this people will faithfully take
[30:00] the open book
[30:02] and feed on the open book and become one
[30:04] with the open book and then go to
[30:06] prophesy again before many nations and
[30:09] kings and tongues and peoples amen they
[30:13] are going to overcome by the blood of
[30:15] the lamb and the word of their testimony
[30:17] amen
[30:18] this this very act amen revelations 10
[30:22] amen has produced amen has brought to us
[30:26] the open book and given us access to the
[30:29] title deed of all redemption and he's
[30:31] brought it back to us through a
[30:33] prophetic ministry and he's brought the
[30:35] truth of the whole bible back to a
[30:37] people so that the people can take that
[30:39] into themselves and become one with this
[30:41] revelation one with god
[30:46] to do what
[30:48] to testify again
[30:52] to declare the truth
[30:56] to speak it out
[30:58] to speak it in every nation in every
[31:00] tongue to every candidate to speak it
[31:02] before kings to speak it before all why
[31:05] because they will overcome by the blood
[31:07] of the lamb and the word of their
[31:08] testimony
[31:10] you realize we're not we're not feeding
[31:13] on reheated doctrine from previous
[31:15] church ages
[31:18] that doctrine gave victory in that day
[31:21] but that day is not this day
[31:24] and as everything grows amen christ is
[31:27] is growing and the body is growing into
[31:30] the head which is christ but as as
[31:33] christ is growing the kingdom of satan
[31:35] is growing and deception is growing amen
[31:38] and so there's got to be a word to
[31:40] overcome amen and as everything's
[31:42] growing you can't rely on the word that
[31:44] worked before because the kingdom of
[31:46] satan is growing you need a word here
[31:50] so god through a prophet in this day has
[31:52] brought us a capstone word and made sure
[31:54] that there can be a final victory man so
[31:57] that she can be the final voice in the
[31:58] final age so there can be a final
[32:00] testimony which will bring a final
[32:02] victory and the satan will be cast down
[32:07] but the only way satan's going to be
[32:09] cast down is if they overcome him
[32:14] that what the scripture says
[32:17] they overcome him
[32:18] that means if the bride is not faithful
[32:21] to revelation chapter 10 verse 8 to 11
[32:24] then his position stays secure amen but
[32:27] this word came amen to
[32:30] to disrupt amen to remove amen to to
[32:33] cast down the accuser of the brethren
[32:37] because he's accusing the brethren
[32:39] because because the word was obscured
[32:41] and
[32:42] and and churches and creeds and
[32:44] denominations have taken the word of god
[32:46] and diced it into a thousand pieces and
[32:48] made parts of it obscure and
[32:50] reinterpreted and retranslated and
[32:53] changed the word until the people don't
[32:55] even know what the truth is anymore
[32:58] and he's sitting there as accuser of the
[33:00] brethren saying they're off the word
[33:02] there and they're off the word there and
[33:04] they're off to word there and you must
[33:05] judge it here you must judge it there
[33:07] and you must judge it here so god in his
[33:09] day he said i'm going to take the seals
[33:11] off and i'm going to show the whole
[33:13] thing what's been going on through these
[33:15] church ages what happened amen through
[33:17] the dark ages what the reformation's
[33:19] been all about because i want my people
[33:21] to know the truth because the truth
[33:23] shall make you free
[33:26] so god has brought a truth and that
[33:28] truth will make us free amen that that
[33:31] true testimony will cast down the
[33:34] accuser of the brethren that's why we
[33:36] have to keep moving into this revelation
[33:38] feeding on this book speaking this word
[33:41] keeping it pure bringing it giving it
[33:43] the way it was brought to us and because
[33:45] this is our victory amen our victory is
[33:48] not having a bigger church or a nice
[33:50] meeting or are more dynamic this or more
[33:53] powerful this or are great big programs
[33:56] that's what the denominations did and
[33:58] it's failed
[33:59] we're not here to have a better sunday
[34:01] school we're not here to have a better
[34:03] church we're not here to have a better
[34:05] program we're here to keep this
[34:06] testimony pure because it's the
[34:08] testimony in conjunction with the blood
[34:10] of the lamb that gives us victory
[34:13] [Music]
[34:15] and the devil's always trying to
[34:17] distract us with something else but it's
[34:19] the word that's been restored it's the
[34:21] revelation of the word in this hour that
[34:23] is giving us the victory that's what we
[34:25] should be testifying that's what we
[34:27] should be feeding on that's what we
[34:28] should be thinking about talking about
[34:30] amen
[34:31] driving into praying for more revelation
[34:38] praise god
[34:41] we get so lazy
[34:44] the laodicean spirit is so lazy
[34:48] so self-serving
[34:51] so interested in pleasures and easy
[34:53] living
[34:55] and under that laodicean spirit we
[34:58] forget the tremendous commission that we
[35:00] have as the bride of jesus christ
[35:03] and we get content with good jobs and
[35:06] good homes and comfortable seats at
[35:08] church
[35:10] gifts in the body and good song leaders
[35:12] and nice musicians and and we get
[35:15] content in those things and we forget
[35:18] that those things are on the peripheral
[35:20] those are side effects of the word but
[35:22] it's the word that gives us victory amen
[35:24] it's the testimony of this word it's the
[35:26] revelation of this hour it's what's been
[35:28] unlocked at the opening of the seals
[35:30] that is going to give us victory amen
[35:33] god did not send a prophet in this day
[35:36] so that we could have a better church
[35:37] than they had before
[35:40] or that we could finally get all the
[35:43] doctrines corrected that's part of it
[35:46] but that's it's not just for a
[35:47] correcting of doctrine a man is to bring
[35:49] the revelation that was under those
[35:51] seals the the mystery that's being
[35:53] revealed to the bride so that she can
[35:55] testify and be a true witness and her
[35:58] witness will bring down the enemy
[36:04] we want to use all kinds of things to
[36:05] defeat the devil
[36:09] try to use our willpower
[36:12] try to use all kinds of mechanisms we
[36:15] get loud and we do this and we we say
[36:17] things and so brash and and
[36:20] make threats to the devil
[36:22] he doesn't move at your threat
[36:25] he doesn't move at your noise
[36:28] that's what the prophet of god told us
[36:31] he doesn't move because you say
[36:34] i'm making you
[36:38] move what defeats him is the word
[36:43] what came in this hour was the
[36:45] revelation of the word the revelation of
[36:48] the mystery that's been in the entire
[36:49] bible from genesis of revelation the
[36:52] thought that was in god's mind the one
[36:54] thing he wanted to achieve all through
[36:56] the bible that is what's been given to
[36:58] the bride in this day for victory
[37:01] we're not to get distracted by anything
[37:02] else but stay focused on that amen dive
[37:06] into it
[37:07] ingest it love it pray for more
[37:09] revelation on it because that's the
[37:11] victory
[37:17] prophet of god singing a song
[37:19] in 1965 at the end of the message god's
[37:22] only provided place of worship
[37:25] he's singing a song and while he's
[37:26] singing singing some bright day i'll go
[37:29] and see him
[37:31] some bright day i'll go and see him
[37:34] on the other shore
[37:36] oh what
[37:37] oh won't that be a happy meeting
[37:41] word goes to word he's injecting a
[37:43] thought now into the song
[37:45] won't that word goes to word
[37:48] he's talking about this happy meeting on
[37:50] the other side and he's starting to say
[37:52] the word is going to the word
[37:54] the word in you and the revealed word of
[37:56] the day is coming together
[37:59] god the word and the portion of the word
[38:00] that's alive in you has been quickened
[38:02] by the baptism holy ghost word is coming
[38:04] to word
[38:06] he's singing in time won't that word
[38:08] goes to word meeting he's he's keeping
[38:11] up he says when the bride goes up word
[38:14] by word
[38:15] amen
[38:17] what's causing her to rise revelation
[38:20] upon revelation word by word she's
[38:23] rising up above the carnal things
[38:26] he goes on singing happy meaning on the
[38:29] other shore oh that bright day may be
[38:31] tomorrow
[38:32] and when he gets done he says you say
[38:35] you mean that brother branham what's he
[38:37] referring to the words he injected there
[38:40] you mean that brother branham yes sir
[38:43] when the lutheran of that age the
[38:45] wesleyans of their age the pentecostals
[38:47] of their age the true ones not the
[38:49] denominationals the pentecostals the one
[38:51] that added leaven their denomination
[38:52] they died but this true word moving on
[38:55] see just like jesus said at that day you
[38:58] you will you'll know that i am in the
[39:00] father the father in me i and you and
[39:02] you and me it's all the word
[39:08] they start saying oh won't that be a
[39:09] happy meeting
[39:11] when his sons are gathered to his gate
[39:15] the word going to the word the bride
[39:17] going up word by word she's been going
[39:20] up amen through the through the feet and
[39:22] legs through luther amen through the
[39:24] reformation up through the hand what
[39:25] she's been doing she's been coming up
[39:27] word by word amen do you think that'll
[39:29] stop now no she's still going up word by
[39:32] word
[39:33] the revelation of this mystery as it
[39:35] unfolds and gets deeper and richer and
[39:38] more clear amen what's it doing it's
[39:40] taking leo to see us hold and moving it
[39:42] away amen it's taking carnality and it's
[39:45] laying it down and bringing us into a
[39:47] spiritual reality that's all around us
[39:50] it's moving us from dimensions we're in
[39:53] a time of dimensional overlap
[39:57] while most of the world is waiting for
[39:59] the rapture we're in the rapture because
[40:01] the rapture started with a shout amen
[40:03] the lord himself shall descend with a
[40:05] shout what's that a message to gather
[40:07] the people have you been gathered under
[40:09] a message amen then you're part of the
[40:11] shout you've been gathered in the shout
[40:13] you're part of the voice testifying this
[40:16] word
[40:17] the world's waiting for a rapture you're
[40:19] in one
[40:20] you're walking at it they're waiting for
[40:22] a resurrection you've been resurrected
[40:24] out of dead denominationalism you've
[40:26] been caught up on high to meet your lord
[40:28] in the air when you heard this word you
[40:30] rose up to meet it
[40:35] but my body's still here i don't care
[40:37] where my body is
[40:40] if i can keep going there my body's
[40:42] going to eventually have to catch up
[40:45] we're in a dimensional overlap
[40:48] you can look at time as a meat cleaver
[40:51] then i'm going to stay on this side
[40:53] until i know that this junctions came
[40:56] and then i'll move to this side of
[40:57] rapture and resurrection and translation
[40:59] i tell you you'll never make it amen
[41:01] because one age blends into another age
[41:04] and there's a dimensional overlap taking
[41:06] place and you should be moving word by
[41:08] word out of this dimension into the next
[41:10] dimension your walk should be changing
[41:12] your prayer life should be changing your
[41:14] mind should be changing word by word
[41:17] revelation by revelation as we eat the
[41:19] book and testify the accuser of the
[41:21] brethren should be losing ground amen
[41:23] and you should be gaining ground
[41:28] we're not here to wait for god to pull
[41:29] the lever
[41:33] he said they overcame him by the blood
[41:35] of the lamb and the word of their
[41:36] testimony
[41:38] so what am i sitting around waiting for
[41:40] he's waiting on you is what the prophet
[41:42] of god said
[41:44] to take what he's given us
[41:47] it's here
[41:49] it's available
[41:51] to take it
[41:53] and eat it up amen
[41:56] and testify prophesy again
[42:01] he says and god's only provided place of
[42:03] worship now think
[42:05] these men
[42:06] why was they called and was put in this
[42:08] condition these pharisees by jesus said
[42:10] in vain you worship me worship him
[42:13] genuine worship true worship from their
[42:14] hearts in vain you worship me why
[42:17] teaching for doctrine the tradition of
[42:19] man
[42:20] therefore you make the commandments of
[42:21] god of no effect to the people if i
[42:23] taught you a methodist message it would
[42:25] take no effect on you
[42:27] this is bride
[42:28] time if moses taught the message of noah
[42:31] it would have taken no effect if jesus
[42:33] taught moses message it would take no
[42:36] effect because the predestination
[42:38] predestinated seed are laying there that
[42:41] will only be watered by that type of
[42:43] water that's give for that seed
[42:47] it won't grow any other condition it
[42:50] must be the condition that grows it
[42:54] we can't grow
[42:55] under methodist doctrine
[42:58] pentecostal doctrine
[43:00] lutheran doctrine you name it doctrine
[43:02] any man-made doctrine amen this seed was
[43:05] not meant to grow under man-made
[43:07] doctrine amen
[43:10] amen
[43:11] this seed wasn't made to grow under
[43:14] anything that's been manhandled but the
[43:16] seed of god that's in you was made to
[43:18] spring to life and grow under the
[43:20] unadulterated pure virgin word of god
[43:22] that's been restored back to the church
[43:24] in this day
[43:25] it is the only thing that that's the
[43:27] only condition that it'll grow in amen
[43:30] so why don't we stay in the word so we
[43:32] can grow
[43:34] why don't we keep preaching the word so
[43:36] others can grow
[43:40] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[43:42] he said hebrews 11 said they could not
[43:44] be perfect without us
[43:46] hands and feet cannot be perfect without
[43:48] the brains
[43:49] the knowledge the head
[43:52] and so forth
[43:54] so you realize that god has been
[43:56] building his body
[43:58] the body of his
[44:00] of his bride the bride of jesus christ
[44:02] he's been growing her up for the last
[44:05] 2000 years and he's growing her into the
[44:07] head
[44:09] let's look at this in ephesians
[44:13] ephesians chapter 4
[44:18] verse 11.
[44:28] and he gave some apostles
[44:31] and some prophets and some evangelists
[44:33] and some pastors and teachers
[44:35] for the perfecting of the saints
[44:37] for the work of the ministry for the
[44:39] edifying
[44:40] of the body of christ
[44:42] till we all come into the unity of faith
[44:44] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[44:46] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[44:48] the stature of the fullness of christ
[44:50] what he's doing he's using the gifts
[44:52] that he sent down and he's ministering
[44:54] through those gifts to build his body
[44:56] and bring it into the full stature of
[44:58] the measure of christ
[45:03] that we henceforth be no more children
[45:05] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[45:06] every wind of doctrine by the slight of
[45:08] men and the cunning craftiness whereby
[45:10] they lie in wait to deceive
[45:12] but speaking the truth and love may grow
[45:14] up into him in all things which is the
[45:16] head
[45:17] even christ
[45:19] so god when he ascended on high he sent
[45:21] gifts unto men and he's been ministering
[45:23] through those gifts through seven church
[45:25] ages and what has he been doing through
[45:26] seven church ages he's been building a
[45:28] body into the perfect image of christ
[45:31] he's been bringing a body to the head
[45:35] to grow into the head
[45:39] and in birth pains he says the word must
[45:41] deliver the word bride
[45:44] church the word
[45:46] must deliver the word bride church
[45:50] how will a word bright church be
[45:52] delivered by the word
[45:54] if i want to bring birth amen if i want
[45:57] to birth a word bride it depends on what
[45:59] you want to birth and how you'll birth
[46:01] it amen but if you want to birth a word
[46:03] bride you can only birth the word bride
[46:05] by the word
[46:10] so
[46:11] so the word must deliver the word bride
[46:13] church the church has got to be
[46:15] delivered out of her a bride for christ
[46:17] them that fell asleep in all ages will
[46:19] make up that bride that come out on the
[46:21] word that they come out on like your
[46:23] feet come to your head
[46:25] she gets greater and more you have to
[46:27] have
[46:28] and so forth
[46:30] so he's saying as this bride's been
[46:32] formed and this bride's been birthed
[46:34] she's been coming out of the church amen
[46:36] and growing in the reformation and as
[46:38] she comes out she's got to grow more
[46:40] from the feet to the arms to the head
[46:43] and he says she's got to get greater and
[46:46] more you have to have and so forth as
[46:48] the body grows up so does the body of
[46:50] christ grow up and then finally the head
[46:52] will come to it the head of it now if we
[46:55] notice because it's all linked to the
[46:56] head the head does the turning the
[46:58] pulling so he has he says as this body
[47:01] grows the head will come to it
[47:05] he says in feast of the trumpets he says
[47:07] there was three stages of it as i said
[47:09] the martyr's age age of the martyr for
[47:11] it then the stage of the ref reformers
[47:14] and the reformers age went all the way
[47:15] through the pentecostal age
[47:20] and now
[47:21] the calling out
[47:23] this isn't the reformer's age now is the
[47:25] calling out time come out of all of it
[47:28] my people
[47:31] now is the calling out time when
[47:33] finished at laodicean age according to
[47:35] revelation 10 the mystery of all the
[47:37] bible would be known to the bride
[47:39] is that right revelation 10
[47:42] bride called out by the word christ
[47:45] himself
[47:46] calling out the bride
[47:49] brother branham wasn't calling out the
[47:50] bride christ himself was calling out the
[47:54] bride
[47:55] the headship was coming to the body and
[47:57] the headship was the word and that word
[47:59] was calling out his bride it was christ
[48:02] calling out the bride
[48:07] he says
[48:09] let me read that again he says now
[48:11] revelation 10 listen close now
[48:14] bride called out by the word christ
[48:16] himself calling out the bride making
[48:18] plain hebrews 13 8 that he's the same
[48:20] yesterday today and forever does the
[48:22] same is the same
[48:24] and christ is the mystery of god
[48:26] revealed says now we see the promise
[48:28] being fulfilled christ the true headship
[48:31] going in he stops says coming in his
[48:34] bride
[48:35] where is that where's the true headship
[48:37] at christ the true hedgehog he's coming
[48:39] in his bride amen it's the bride coming
[48:41] of christ christ the true headship
[48:44] coming in his bride doing the same works
[48:46] that he did at the beginning and making
[48:48] ready and fulfilling his word as he did
[48:50] at first in john 14 12 he that believeth
[48:53] on me the works that i do shall he do
[48:55] also then the head and the body are
[48:58] becoming one in works and in sign and in
[49:01] life
[49:03] vindicated by god himself through his
[49:05] promised word for the last day he
[49:07] promised this in the last days now if
[49:09] you're spiritual you'll catch it
[49:13] let's go to galatians chapter 4.
[49:20] verse 19.
[49:31] my little children of whom i travail in
[49:33] birth again until christ be formed in
[49:36] you
[49:38] here's the apostle paul and he's in
[49:40] labor he's in labor pains and what's he
[49:42] trying to do he's trying to bring forth
[49:45] the church and that will he says i'm
[49:47] laboring
[49:49] and travailing birth again until christ
[49:51] be formed in you what was the goal of
[49:53] paul's ministry to christ be formed in
[49:56] you
[49:57] paul as he laid the foundation amen he
[50:00] was the wise master builder he laid a
[50:02] foundation and he says take heed how you
[50:04] build thereon
[50:06] and the chief cornerstone is jesus
[50:08] christ and paul as the master builder he
[50:11] laid the foundation and what foundation
[50:13] did he lay he laid the foundation as
[50:15] he's laboring to lay the foundation
[50:17] what's the purpose that christ be formed
[50:19] in you amen whatever this building of
[50:21] the church he's building is to be a
[50:22] habitation of christ christ formed in it
[50:26] that was the goal from the very
[50:28] beginning
[50:30] in the invisible union
[50:32] the prophet says you remember
[50:34] when it went down and the grain began to
[50:36] ripen that you find before the grain can
[50:38] ripen everything in that stalk has to be
[50:40] dead
[50:48] the grain is going to be the original
[50:50] word come back to manifestation
[50:53] but it's been carried through the church
[50:54] ages through the stalk and the torso and
[50:56] the shock
[50:57] but when it comes time for manifestation
[50:59] everything else has to be dead
[51:03] nothing else will bring the victory
[51:06] nothing else will bring the right
[51:08] testimony that has satan cast down
[51:12] when we come to the end time nothing
[51:15] else will work
[51:17] what worked previously the life has left
[51:19] it now and is in the grain
[51:21] if it worked there it's still here
[51:25] this is no rejection of previous truths
[51:28] all the previous truths in that life
[51:29] moved forward and is now in the seed
[51:36] everything in the stalk has to be dead
[51:38] hallelujah can't you see where we're
[51:40] standing life is in the grain again what
[51:42] is it just exactly the same grain that
[51:44] went in the ground the same jesus and
[51:46] the bride form same power same church
[51:50] same thing same word the same word
[51:52] sucked up through these and come out
[51:54] here and come to the head here and all
[51:57] that life that come through here picked
[51:59] up its people now it's forming up into a
[52:01] head for the
[52:02] rapture it's got to come to the head for
[52:05] the rapture amen
[52:07] it's got to come to the full measure of
[52:08] the word and this is what he says here
[52:10] in the first seal it says now there's
[52:12] coming forth seven mysterious thunders
[52:15] that's not even written at all that's
[52:16] right and i believe that through these
[52:19] seven thunders will be revealed in the
[52:20] last days in order to get the bride
[52:23] together for rapturing faith
[52:26] what's going to do it the revelation of
[52:28] those seven thunders amen is going to
[52:30] get the bride together for rapturing
[52:32] faith because we got right now we
[52:34] wouldn't be able to do it so what he's
[52:36] saying what we've collected everything
[52:39] that we build up through as the body's
[52:40] building up through the reformers age
[52:42] through everything else if there's
[52:44] something else that's got to take place
[52:46] to bring this rapturing faith amen and
[52:48] brother branham's coming to the first
[52:49] seal he's coming to the to the opening
[52:52] now the revealing of the thunders and
[52:54] he's saying what we got now won't work
[52:59] so you take what you had before the
[53:01] seals
[53:04] just hang with me
[53:06] the ministry
[53:09] the tying together of loose ends
[53:13] brother branham says what we got now
[53:15] won't work
[53:20] that's why brother brennan's ministry
[53:22] even his ministry all the way up it was
[53:23] building it was building a plan where
[53:25] he's laying down truth tying together
[53:26] loose ends restoring truth restoring
[53:28] doctrine bringing us all the way up to
[53:30] this point but he says what we have now
[53:33] is not enough
[53:36] so that's why as the bride of jesus
[53:37] christ we have got to make the
[53:39] transition in 1963 if we're going to go
[53:42] to rapturing faith if we're going to
[53:44] have the testimony the word the
[53:46] prophesying again that's going to bring
[53:47] down satan's stronghold in heaven that's
[53:49] going to cast him down his accuser of
[53:51] the brethren we got to make the
[53:52] transition from 62 to 63.
[54:00] is that what he said
[54:05] because what we've got right now we
[54:07] wouldn't be able to do it there's
[54:09] something we've got to step farther
[54:13] we can't have enough faith for divine
[54:14] healing hardly we've got to have enough
[54:16] faith to be changed in a moment and be
[54:18] swept out of this earth we find that
[54:20] after a while the lord willing find
[54:22] where it's written
[54:25] and questions and answers on the seals
[54:26] between the sixth and seventh seal he
[54:28] gets a question he says have the seven
[54:30] thunders which equal the seven mysteries
[54:32] all already been revealed
[54:35] were they revealed in the seven seals
[54:36] but yet but are yet not known to us as
[54:39] the thunders yet but the man says no
[54:41] they were revealed in the seven seals
[54:45] that's what the thunders was about
[54:48] what was the thunder's about the thunder
[54:50] was the thunder of god the voice of god
[54:52] amen threw a prophet to reveal what
[54:54] those seals were what the mysteries
[54:56] behind the symbols were
[54:58] and now he's coming and he's telling us
[55:00] no they were revealed in the seven seals
[55:02] that's what the thunders was about
[55:04] it was revealed the seven thunders that
[55:06] had uttered their voices and no one
[55:08] could make out what it was john knew
[55:09] what it was but he was forbidden to ride
[55:11] in but the seventh angel in the days of
[55:13] his sounding the seven mysteries of the
[55:15] seven thunders would be revealed and the
[55:18] seventh angel is the messenger of the
[55:20] seventh church age
[55:22] and brother branham says we've got to go
[55:25] farther amen where we're at when he
[55:27] comes to the seals we've got to go
[55:29] farther what we've got now wouldn't do
[55:30] it if we're going to go to a rapture
[55:32] we've got to go all the way to the head
[55:34] amen we've got the head to have to come
[55:36] into the bride the bride has to unite
[55:38] with the head what is the head it is the
[55:40] word amen the understanding the
[55:42] revelation of the mystery of god that
[55:45] lays under those seals
[55:48] he's got to preach the thunder and when
[55:50] he preaches the thunder he unlocks the
[55:53] mystery of the church
[55:55] and when he unlocks the mystery of the
[55:57] church he can now unlock the mystery of
[55:59] god
[56:01] because until you unlock the mystery of
[56:03] the bride form of christ you cannot
[56:05] unlock the full revelation of god
[56:08] because god is known in male and female
[56:10] god is known in husband and wife amen
[56:12] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[56:14] but christ is revealed as mister and
[56:16] misses
[56:18] so the revelation of the seven thunders
[56:20] have to unlock the mystery of the church
[56:22] through seven church ages amen through
[56:24] two thousand years of mystery of
[56:25] redemption of the gentile woman and when
[56:27] he unlocks that mystery laying under
[56:29] that is the mystery of the whole book
[56:33] and that's what we need for rapturing
[56:35] faith that's what we need to be
[56:37] testifying of that's what we need to be
[56:39] prophesying again
[56:41] [Music]
[56:43] if we've missed that we've missed the
[56:45] very thing that's giving us the victory
[56:46] in the end time
[56:54] he says in the first seal
[56:56] again he's but think
[56:59] now he wrote this but when he started to
[57:01] write those other seven thunders he said
[57:03] don't write it
[57:04] he'd been commissioned to write
[57:06] everything he'd seen but when these
[57:07] seven thunders over in revelation 10
[57:09] under he said don't write them at all
[57:11] they're mysteries we don't know what
[57:13] they are yet but my opinion they'll be
[57:16] revealed right away
[57:18] i say his opinion was right
[57:21] he was in the first seal he was in the
[57:22] midst of doing it
[57:25] and when it do
[57:26] it'll give faith for the rapturing grace
[57:28] for the church to move out
[57:31] it means my move out listen when brother
[57:33] branham is talking about this he's
[57:34] talking about move out move out of the
[57:36] shock move out of the denominations move
[57:38] out of the man-made this will give them
[57:40] faith to move out which what is the
[57:42] moving out the moving out is the first
[57:44] part of the rapture coming out of dead
[57:46] denominationalism and gathering together
[57:48] through the headship of christ
[57:50] that is the first part of the rapture
[57:52] that's why under the seals the thunders
[57:54] had to go to give rapturing faith and
[57:56] rapturing faith would give them the
[57:58] faith to move out of the shock to move
[58:00] away from the man-made systems and move
[58:02] away from denominations and traditions
[58:04] of the fathers and what are they doing
[58:06] they're moving into the shout amen to
[58:08] moving to become the voice it's the
[58:10] first part of the rapture
[58:12] it's giving rapturing faith now they
[58:15] mean if you've had faith to move by the
[58:17] shout out of denominations and away from
[58:20] the shock and being gathered to the
[58:21] headship and become one with jesus
[58:23] christ and become the voice amen of
[58:25] christ in you you're already moving in
[58:28] the rapture you've received rapturing
[58:30] faith to begin a rapturing cycle
[58:35] we say we want to wait for something
[58:36] else to wait for something else brother
[58:37] graham said this is it
[58:39] this is the something else the
[58:40] revelation that's in those seven
[58:41] thunders is there something else in the
[58:43] revelation of the entire bible laying
[58:45] under those seven thunders is the rest
[58:47] of it
[58:49] it is the mechanism it is what gives you
[58:51] faith to move out
[58:55] what else are we waiting for
[58:57] another prophet another great man with
[58:59] another great revelation somebody else
[59:01] to he's already given it to his friends
[59:03] we have to take what the prophet said
[59:05] and believe it and let the revelation of
[59:07] those seven thunders which pealed open
[59:09] the seven seals which revealed the
[59:10] mystery of god let it give you rapturing
[59:13] faith to move with a shout and be
[59:14] gathered together to the message of the
[59:16] hour become one with christ get caught
[59:20] up to meet him outside of laodicea get
[59:22] caught up to meet him in the air
[59:25] and be seated with him in heavenly
[59:27] places
[59:35] he says in the message the rising of the
[59:37] sun
[59:39] so there he spoke to me said the seven
[59:41] seals will be open
[59:42] the seven mysteries sevenfold mysteries
[59:44] of the bible that's been closed up since
[59:47] the foundation of the world will be
[59:48] revealed
[59:49] and we yet a humble little group
[59:51] compared with all the world we've
[59:52] enjoyed these blessings
[59:54] hearing these mysteries marriage divorce
[59:56] serpency all those different questions
[59:58] has been completely revealed to us
[1:00:01] not by man but by god himself that's
[1:00:04] opened these seven mysteries of what the
[1:00:06] church was
[1:00:08] how it was in christ at the beginning
[1:00:10] and how it would be revealed in the last
[1:00:11] day
[1:00:14] did you get what he said the opening of
[1:00:15] the seven mysteries revealed
[1:00:17] the opening of the seven mysteries
[1:00:19] revealed
[1:00:20] that he said open those seven mysteries
[1:00:22] of what the church was
[1:00:25] how it was in christ at the beginning
[1:00:26] and how it will be revealed in the last
[1:00:28] day that's what was that was what was
[1:00:30] laying in those seven thunders the
[1:00:31] mystery of redemption
[1:00:35] and when he when he gave the mystery of
[1:00:37] redemption to the gentile church he also
[1:00:40] showed the mystery redemption for the
[1:00:41] jews and the fifth seal
[1:00:45] he showed the redemption of the earth in
[1:00:47] the sixth seal
[1:00:49] it was the mystery of redemption
[1:00:51] showing what would happen to the gentile
[1:00:53] bride and showing what would happen at
[1:00:54] the end time
[1:00:55] and he had to do that and peel the
[1:00:58] mystery off of that because underneath
[1:01:00] those seals was the mystery of the
[1:01:02] entire bible
[1:01:04] and that mystery was god
[1:01:06] becoming tangible
[1:01:09] the mystery was the becoming god
[1:01:14] mystery
[1:01:15] of the whole bible
[1:01:18] that's what gives us rapturing faith
[1:01:22] to move out to raise up out of dead
[1:01:25] denomination be resurrected out of the
[1:01:27] deadness of laodicea
[1:01:30] to hear the eagle scream and be caught
[1:01:32] up quickly to meet it in the air
[1:01:34] these are all things brother bam told us
[1:01:36] happens
[1:01:37] at the hearing of the revelation of the
[1:01:38] word
[1:01:40] that's for us
[1:01:45] colossians chapter 1
[1:01:47] turn there together please
[1:02:02] colossians chapter 1
[1:02:04] verse 26
[1:02:07] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:02:09] ages and from generations but now is
[1:02:11] made manifest to his saints
[1:02:13] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:02:14] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:02:16] among the gentiles which is christ in
[1:02:19] you the hope of glory
[1:02:22] whom we preach warning every man and
[1:02:24] teaching every man in all wisdom that we
[1:02:26] may present every man perfect in christ
[1:02:27] jesus where unto i also labor striving
[1:02:30] according to his working which worketh
[1:02:32] in me mightily
[1:02:39] brother bam says and things that are to
[1:02:41] be
[1:02:42] said if we are those attributes of god
[1:02:44] we cannot live by creeds
[1:02:46] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[1:02:48] must live by the word because the bride
[1:02:50] is part of the bridegroom like any wife
[1:02:52] is part of her husband therefore we must
[1:02:54] be the word bride and what is the word
[1:02:56] bride the manifestation of this hour
[1:02:59] the bride not a creed creator a
[1:03:01] denomination but a living oracle of god
[1:03:06] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:03:09] a living oracle of god
[1:03:12] what is the manifestation of this hour
[1:03:15] the bride what is the bride a living
[1:03:18] oracle of god
[1:03:21] a living attribute of god
[1:03:24] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:03:26] of god and the formation of the bride
[1:03:28] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:03:31] we're now
[1:03:32] living
[1:03:34] he says in modern events made clear by
[1:03:36] prophecy
[1:03:38] so now he said i'll meet them in one
[1:03:40] place the place i put my name that's in
[1:03:42] christ in jesus christ that's where god
[1:03:44] put his name that's the only place he'll
[1:03:46] meet you in his christ is the word the
[1:03:48] same yesterday it's grown from the feet
[1:03:50] the thighs and now it's in the head
[1:03:52] fixing to go
[1:03:56] manifesting in full measure the bride
[1:03:59] the same
[1:04:00] as the groom
[1:04:02] as it's fixing to go what's the
[1:04:04] manifestation as it's fixing to go it's
[1:04:07] manifesting the manifestation of the
[1:04:09] bride
[1:04:11] and we have
[1:04:13] an accuser of the brethren
[1:04:16] that has a place in the heavenly realm
[1:04:18] accusing the brethren but his his place
[1:04:21] will not remain forever
[1:04:24] prophet said when she goes up he comes
[1:04:27] down
[1:04:28] and the bible says that they overcame
[1:04:30] him who the brethren that he had been
[1:04:32] accusing they overcame him by the blood
[1:04:34] of the lamb and the word of their
[1:04:35] testimony
[1:04:38] so now when we look at the revelation of
[1:04:41] the seven thunders revealing the seals
[1:04:43] what the church is and what she was and
[1:04:46] how god redeemed her and and the mystery
[1:04:48] of of who she was in christ from the
[1:04:50] very beginning and christ is the mystery
[1:04:52] of god revealed revealing the whole
[1:04:53] mystery now when that mystery amen comes
[1:04:56] to a revelation in your heart and you
[1:04:58] don't see it as a mystery you see it as
[1:05:00] your story
[1:05:02] it's not a mystery anymore it's you amen
[1:05:05] it's your life it's your story it's your
[1:05:07] testimony
[1:05:08] it's who you are it's your
[1:05:09] identification amen that headship amen
[1:05:12] that cloud that appeared is no longer a
[1:05:14] cloud that appeared that was my headship
[1:05:16] where was he coming he was coming to
[1:05:18] unite with me
[1:05:19] [Applause]
[1:05:21] it's not a story amen it's not a picture
[1:05:23] on a wall it is me it's my life it
[1:05:26] christ in me the hope of glory
[1:05:29] paul was laboring till christ be formed
[1:05:31] in me
[1:05:35] and now the accuser of the brethren
[1:05:36] accuses you and now what do you say you
[1:05:39] say now we have the devil's answer
[1:05:43] amen
[1:05:45] we have the devil's answer it's not me
[1:05:47] it's him it's the resurrected christ
[1:05:49] he's coming back with the word it's the
[1:05:50] word it's not me it's the mystery that's
[1:05:53] laying under the seals it's the mystery
[1:05:54] of the entire bible amen he just
[1:05:56] revealed to me i'm part of it it's not
[1:05:58] me it's him with me
[1:06:02] but you're this and you're that that's
[1:06:04] not what's laying under the seals for me
[1:06:05] mr devil
[1:06:09] but you're this and you were born of
[1:06:10] that and you've always done that but
[1:06:12] that's not what was revealed under the
[1:06:15] mystery to me amen when the seals opened
[1:06:18] to me i saw my name in the book i heard
[1:06:21] my name called i recognized i was part
[1:06:23] of this mystery from before the
[1:06:24] foundation of the world and you say i'm
[1:06:27] a washout you say i'm a hypocrite you
[1:06:30] say i'm no good you say i'm defeated but
[1:06:32] i say i'm part of this mystery
[1:06:35] my revelation i can no more be lost and
[1:06:38] god can be lost because i was with him
[1:06:40] before the foundation of the world i've
[1:06:42] come from god i'm going to god by a
[1:06:44] revelation that was laying under the
[1:06:46] seals for me
[1:06:48] [Applause]
[1:06:49] i tell you that's the testimony that
[1:06:51] will bring him down friends that and
[1:06:53] that alone is the revelation in the
[1:06:55] testimony of the bride that will cast
[1:06:57] him down not saying i was sick and now
[1:06:59] i'm healed the pentecostals can do that
[1:07:02] there's got to be something more amen
[1:07:04] something when brother branham came to
[1:07:05] the seals in 1963 he says what we got
[1:07:08] now he had a restoration of the gifts
[1:07:10] had a tie-in together of loose sins had
[1:07:12] an explanation of the church ages but
[1:07:14] there's got to be a deeper mystery
[1:07:17] to bring you rapturing faith so that you
[1:07:19] can fly above all these denominations
[1:07:21] and fly above all of this to where you
[1:07:23] can get into the real revelation above
[1:07:26] amnesia above all of this stuff so you
[1:07:28] can fly so high you can say i remember
[1:07:31] where i came from
[1:07:32] [Music]
[1:07:36] but you're that no no no no no that was
[1:07:38] on my birth certificate that's just
[1:07:39] flesh that's not who i am
[1:07:43] do you remember when you did this and
[1:07:45] you remember when you did that remember
[1:07:47] when you said that oh you say but that's
[1:07:49] now i've been washed by the water of the
[1:07:51] word all the filth and everything's been
[1:07:53] washed away from me i've been redeemed
[1:07:55] amen the redeemer has come he's not
[1:07:58] still back there redeeming now he's here
[1:08:00] claiming and i'm part of what he claimed
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:04] he was there redeeming redeeming through
[1:08:07] seven churches redeeming but when he's
[1:08:09] done redeeming in the last church ages
[1:08:11] now he steps forth to take the book and
[1:08:13] claim what he's redeemed now it's the
[1:08:15] claiming ministry
[1:08:19] and guess who he claimed mr devil
[1:08:22] he claimed me
[1:08:24] not by what i've done
[1:08:26] or not done
[1:08:28] but by a revelation
[1:08:30] that came at the opening of those seals
[1:08:33] by the revealing of the mystery that
[1:08:35] laid in that book that was bound up by
[1:08:37] those seven seals when the seven seals
[1:08:39] come off it opened up the entire bible
[1:08:44] now i know who i really am
[1:08:47] i'm not the son of charles and elibrano
[1:08:51] but i'm a son of god
[1:08:53] i'm not the daughter of this name in
[1:08:54] that name but i'm a daughter of god i'm
[1:08:57] a son of god i'm not the person who lied
[1:09:00] and stole and cheated amen that was the
[1:09:02] body i was trapped into of no fault of
[1:09:05] my own the prophet says
[1:09:09] but god's got a plan for that body too
[1:09:12] and an absolute reformation amen when
[1:09:14] he's going to make it over in a
[1:09:15] glorified form i'm not going to be
[1:09:17] attached to this it's going to be
[1:09:19] changed
[1:09:21] that spirit that natural carnal spirit
[1:09:23] that i got that always is lying to me
[1:09:25] and causing me to doubt troubling my
[1:09:27] mind making me nervous and forgetful and
[1:09:30] all of these things that's going to go
[1:09:32] and be no more
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:35] but the reality of what laid under the
[1:09:37] seals of me is still there and it's been
[1:09:39] awakened by the revelation in this hour
[1:09:43] i tell you friends that's the testimony
[1:09:47] will bring him down
[1:09:51] he says you're a liar
[1:09:53] and you says the word says
[1:09:57] you're no good the word says
[1:10:01] you haven't got it the word says
[1:10:05] and the accuser of the brethren is
[1:10:07] losing all his ammunition
[1:10:11] he can't use your hybridization anymore
[1:10:14] he can't use deception of church ages
[1:10:16] anymore
[1:10:17] he can't use confusion on doctrine
[1:10:19] anymore
[1:10:23] he's losing all his ammunition as these
[1:10:25] seals become more relevant and more real
[1:10:28] and more visible to us he's losing more
[1:10:30] of his ammunition if we will just lay
[1:10:32] claim to what's been given to us if we
[1:10:34] will just speak what's on those tapes if
[1:10:36] we'll just say what the prophet said and
[1:10:38] we'll say it with faith we'll believe it
[1:10:40] amen by a revelation of god personally
[1:10:42] to us it will say he's losing ground
[1:10:44] friends trust me he's losing ground
[1:10:48] and that's why this word came in this
[1:10:50] hour not to be books on your shelf not a
[1:10:52] picture on a wall not a tape in your
[1:10:54] tape player or an sd card on your phone
[1:10:56] that's not why it came it came to unlock
[1:10:59] the mystery of who the church was where
[1:11:02] she was in christ all along and what the
[1:11:04] mystery of god really is so you could
[1:11:06] rise to your position so that you can
[1:11:08] move out in the resurrection
[1:11:16] now
[1:11:17] if you give me five more minutes
[1:11:20] i want to get into the second part of my
[1:11:22] title
[1:11:23] the father's business
[1:11:25] let's go to luke chapter 2.
[1:11:30] i tell you friends i'm so excited to be
[1:11:31] alive
[1:11:34] the devil's losing all his footing
[1:11:38] every lie is slipping
[1:11:41] everything he's told me through my life
[1:11:43] is now so apparently wrong to me
[1:11:46] what i thought was true i now recognize
[1:11:48] is his lie
[1:11:50] what had me bound in my mind i now see
[1:11:52] his deception
[1:11:54] why because the light of the gospel is
[1:11:56] shining that light down unto the truth
[1:11:58] into the word and it's pushing all the
[1:12:00] darkness away and where he was working
[1:12:02] in obscurity god is bringing revelation
[1:12:04] and now clarity has no room for him to
[1:12:06] hide
[1:12:07] he was hiding in the uncertainty of the
[1:12:09] rapture
[1:12:10] he was hiding in the uncertainty of the
[1:12:12] bride he was hiding in the uncertainty
[1:12:14] of the church ages
[1:12:16] but that bright light has come to reveal
[1:12:18] all his hiding places and now he can't
[1:12:20] hide there anymore by what by the
[1:12:23] revelation of this end time message has
[1:12:25] taken away his hiding places there with
[1:12:27] no hiding he can't launch out and
[1:12:29] deceive you anymore because he has
[1:12:30] nothing to hide behind
[1:12:34] keep walking in the light friends keep
[1:12:36] pressing into the word this is not time
[1:12:38] to be a lazy laodicean this is time to
[1:12:40] be the bride of jesus christ for the
[1:12:42] bride has made herself ready she has
[1:12:44] taken this revelation and she's put it
[1:12:46] on she has taken this book she's ate it
[1:12:49] up
[1:12:50] you know when john came to the mighty
[1:12:52] angel he said give me the book the
[1:12:54] mighty angel didn't pull his jaw down
[1:12:55] and throw it down into his throat
[1:12:58] but
[1:12:59] he had to go to the angel
[1:13:02] because the voice said go into the angel
[1:13:05] and take the book
[1:13:07] so he walked to the angel listen god
[1:13:09] doesn't do everything he leaves
[1:13:11] something for you to do so you can prove
[1:13:13] that you're the predestinated of god
[1:13:18] we want to believe we're predestined
[1:13:19] when god pulls our jaw down and throws
[1:13:20] it down on our throat chomps it shut and
[1:13:22] says now you're it that's not how it
[1:13:24] works friends he does it by saying this
[1:13:26] is it do you want it this is it do you
[1:13:28] want it amen because if you're part of
[1:13:30] him you want it you want it you want it
[1:13:32] so bad you want more of it when you
[1:13:33] taste it you got to taste it again
[1:13:37] it's a revelation of who we really are
[1:13:41] he comes to the mighty angel and says
[1:13:43] give me the little book
[1:13:46] and the angel doesn't say well let me
[1:13:47] package it for me hold out your hand
[1:13:49] the angel says take it
[1:13:53] can you get it
[1:13:58] how long have you pursued that little
[1:14:00] book
[1:14:01] and reached for and reached for it again
[1:14:06] why because you wanted it
[1:14:10] because you wanted it
[1:14:12] when you got a hold of that little book
[1:14:16] he says now
[1:14:17] eat it up
[1:14:18] the term eat it up doesn't just mean
[1:14:20] take a bite eat it up means to eat it
[1:14:23] all
[1:14:25] right
[1:14:26] this revelation that's come
[1:14:28] eat it up
[1:14:30] eat it all
[1:14:32] and if you eat it all
[1:14:34] it'll be in your mouth sweet as honey
[1:14:36] but in your
[1:14:37] belly it'll be bitter
[1:14:40] listen
[1:14:41] when john takes the book before he eats
[1:14:44] it he knows what it's going to do to his
[1:14:46] belly
[1:14:49] and the apostle paul before he enters
[1:14:51] the ministry is told what great things
[1:14:53] he must suffer
[1:14:55] peter before he answered his ministry is
[1:14:57] told that at the end he will not be able
[1:14:59] to lead himself but his hands will be
[1:15:00] outstretched
[1:15:01] showing what manner of death he'll die
[1:15:05] but there's something about a
[1:15:06] predestinated seed of god amen there's
[1:15:09] something about the prize that makes the
[1:15:11] obstacles worth it
[1:15:13] there's something about him that makes
[1:15:16] the hazards worth it amen there's
[1:15:18] something about our god amen having him
[1:15:21] knowing him tasting him that makes the
[1:15:23] hazards that makes the difficulties that
[1:15:25] makes the bitterness worth it
[1:15:28] and he can tell you beforehand you're
[1:15:30] going to suffer and you'll say i'll
[1:15:32] suffer anyways if that's you
[1:15:34] because all my life i've wanted you
[1:15:41] now luke chapter 2
[1:15:45] verse 46.
[1:15:55] luke 2 and 46
[1:15:57] and it came to pass that after three
[1:15:59] days they found him in the temple
[1:16:00] sitting in the midst of the doctors
[1:16:03] both hearing them and asking them
[1:16:04] questions and all that heard him were
[1:16:07] astonished at his understanding and
[1:16:09] answers
[1:16:10] when they saw him they were amazed
[1:16:12] this is jesus at 12 years old when he's
[1:16:14] left in jerusalem
[1:16:16] they travel three days they can't find
[1:16:18] him they come back to find him and here
[1:16:20] he is disputing and talking with the
[1:16:22] scholars
[1:16:24] verse 48 when they saw him they were
[1:16:25] amazed and his mother said unto him son
[1:16:27] why hast thou thus dealt with us behold
[1:16:30] thy father and i have sought thee with
[1:16:32] sorrowing.
[1:16:34] and he sayeth unto them
[1:16:35] how is it that you sought me
[1:16:37] i wish you not that i must be about my
[1:16:39] father's business
[1:16:43] jesus says a young manifested word
[1:16:48] say it that way so you can identify
[1:16:51] jesus is a young manifested word
[1:16:55] he's a manifested word you're a
[1:16:57] manifested word
[1:17:00] his mother the old church comes to him
[1:17:02] and gives him the wrong identification
[1:17:09] and he corrects her
[1:17:12] and says
[1:17:13] she denied the virgin birth she denied
[1:17:16] who he was that he was christ that he
[1:17:17] was the word made manifest in his day
[1:17:20] the church was giving a wrong
[1:17:21] identification but he corrected her
[1:17:24] i said no you're not that i must be
[1:17:25] about my father's
[1:17:28] business
[1:17:30] what was jesus doing
[1:17:32] that was his father's business
[1:17:36] he was breaking the word
[1:17:41] so what is the father's business to
[1:17:44] break the word
[1:17:47] you see jesus wasn't he wasn't doing
[1:17:49] dynamic things he wasn't doing miracles
[1:17:52] all of those were to attract the
[1:17:54] attention of the people so that he could
[1:17:55] break the word so that they could come
[1:17:56] to the breaking of the word
[1:17:59] and brother branham's day all the
[1:18:01] dynamic things that he was doing amen
[1:18:03] was to attract the attention of the
[1:18:04] people amen in the first and second pool
[1:18:06] so they get hooked in the third pool and
[1:18:08] the third pool was the revealing of the
[1:18:10] word
[1:18:13] so now he says nearly not i must be in
[1:18:15] my father's business and brother brennan
[1:18:18] says in 1965 the seat does not air with
[1:18:20] the shock it says notice there will be
[1:18:22] no more carrier mother churches
[1:18:24] denominations after this carrier shuck
[1:18:28] because after the shuck there is no more
[1:18:29] nothing left by then but just the grain
[1:18:32] is that right
[1:18:34] it's got to be the grain it's got to be
[1:18:36] the same kind that went into the ground
[1:18:38] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:18:40] and forever
[1:18:41] a spirit come upon the bride to do the
[1:18:43] same thing that he did
[1:18:45] it's the reproducing again of the grain
[1:18:49] all right
[1:18:50] the word yet young
[1:18:53] spake for itself
[1:18:54] and know not that i must be about my
[1:18:56] father's business
[1:18:58] there is the secret of the message now
[1:19:04] what's the secret of the message
[1:19:08] there is the secret of the message now
[1:19:09] just exactly the father's business
[1:19:14] what's the secret of the message
[1:19:16] that i must be about my father's
[1:19:18] business
[1:19:19] not my idea not my business what i think
[1:19:22] ought to be done what looks good what
[1:19:24] makes me look good what makes me popular
[1:19:26] but what i must be about now the secret
[1:19:28] of the message is the father's business
[1:19:32] then he says what is the father's
[1:19:33] business
[1:19:35] could you think of what the father's
[1:19:36] business was in him to fulfill what
[1:19:38] isaiah said a virgin shall conceive
[1:19:40] fulfill was isaiah said again the lame
[1:19:42] shall leap like a heart and all these
[1:19:44] things would take place like moses said

[1:23:08] mysteries of god even to serpent seed
[1:23:10] and all would be manifest in marriage
[1:23:12] and divorce and all these other
[1:23:14] mysteries that's been hid under the
[1:23:15] pillars for all these years from the
[1:23:17] theologians and so forth but is now the
[1:23:19] hour
[1:23:20] that's the father's business
[1:23:25] no matter what you thought it was before
[1:23:27] throw it out the window this is what a
[1:23:29] prophet told us this is the secret of
[1:23:31] the message today
[1:23:33] to be about the father's business
[1:23:38] and i want to be
[1:23:40] i want a testimony
[1:23:43] that will defeat the enemy
[1:23:46] what is your testimony your witness
[1:23:48] before a judge
[1:23:50] i witness that this word is true
[1:23:54] i stand as a witness that there's a
[1:23:56] power to change a life that there's a
[1:23:58] power to quicken a seed i stand as a
[1:24:01] witness that this word will change a
[1:24:02] life
[1:24:04] i stand as a witness that this word will
[1:24:06] raise you out of laodicea and bring you
[1:24:08] into the presence of jesus christ i
[1:24:10] stand as a witness let my voice go on
[1:24:12] record as a witness against the accuser
[1:24:14] of the brethren that i've been washed
[1:24:15] under the water of the word i've been
[1:24:17] anointed by the anointing of the word in
[1:24:19] this day and i believe this word to be
[1:24:21] every bit the truth
[1:24:22] [Applause]
[1:24:24] let me testify
[1:24:29] the devil says but i say
[1:24:32] by a witness by a revelation of jesus
[1:24:35] christ that this is the truth
[1:24:39] i'm here to vindicate
[1:24:41] hebrews 13
[1:24:43] amen
[1:24:44] show me your signs chad
[1:24:46] if you can't see the bride coming it's
[1:24:48] not my fault
[1:24:54] if you can't see a life surrendered in
[1:24:56] humility
[1:24:58] if you can't see your brothers and
[1:25:00] sisters walking in the father's business
[1:25:03] if you can't see your brothers and
[1:25:04] sisters yielding daily to the word
[1:25:07] submitting and surrendering to the
[1:25:09] leadership of the word giving up old
[1:25:11] things casting away or wrong decisions
[1:25:14] and choosing the right way continually
[1:25:17] growing in the revelation and growing in
[1:25:19] the character of christ if you can't see
[1:25:20] the bride coming of christ it's not my
[1:25:22] fault but it's hebrews 13 8 just the
[1:25:24] same
[1:25:27] if you can't see luke 17 30 and this day
[1:25:30] it's not my fault but i want to be a
[1:25:31] witness say i see it amen i see it and
[1:25:34] my brothers and sisters i see it in a
[1:25:36] surrender to the word i see it in my
[1:25:38] life that being their lives that are
[1:25:40] being changed
[1:25:42] i see it in young people amen not
[1:25:44] running to the world and not toying with
[1:25:46] the things of the world but committing
[1:25:47] themselves to god into the word of god
[1:25:51] i can see it do you see the vindication
[1:25:53] of malachi 4 i am vindicating malachi 4.
[1:25:57] because i believe what paul believed and
[1:25:59] i believe what peter believed i've been
[1:26:01] returned to the faith of the pentecostal
[1:26:06] they defeated him
[1:26:09] by the blood of the lamb
[1:26:11] and the word of their testimony
[1:26:13] i want my testimony to match this
[1:26:16] revelation that was under the thunders
[1:26:19] because what we had before that wasn't
[1:26:21] enough
[1:26:23] but since that time it's been enough to
[1:26:26] move us out into the rapture
[1:26:28] to catch us up out of laodicea to move
[1:26:30] us out of dead denominations and
[1:26:32] resurrect us into newness of life
[1:26:34] since that time it's been enough
[1:26:38] if it's been enough to do that it's
[1:26:39] enough to finish the job until the very
[1:26:41] atoms in this body of mind change
[1:26:44] what he's done he's doing what he's
[1:26:46] doing he'll do amen and there's a
[1:26:48] vindication going on in this day
[1:26:51] that's the father's business
[1:26:54] not to use our own mind and our own will
[1:26:56] and our own desires but to yield to that
[1:26:58] word
[1:26:59] and surrender to the revealed word and
[1:27:01] let the word bring its own life
[1:27:05] and let that life have preeminence in us
[1:27:07] and let that life live its own life
[1:27:11] out from us
[1:27:13] let's go to galatians chapter one
[1:27:16] i'll read this last scripture musicians
[1:27:18] you can come
[1:27:20] brother blake you can come as well
[1:27:23] galatians 1 and 10.
[1:27:28] for do i now persuade men or
[1:27:30] god or do i seek to please men
[1:27:34] for if i yet pleased men i should not be
[1:27:36] the servant of christ
[1:27:39] but i certify you brethren that the
[1:27:40] gospel which was preached of me
[1:27:43] is not after man
[1:27:45] if i neither received it of man
[1:27:47] neither was i taught it
[1:27:49] but by the revelation
[1:27:51] of jesus christ
[1:27:54] what is the new birth
[1:27:56] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:27:58] personally
[1:27:59] to you
[1:28:01] this is not a repeat message
[1:28:03] i heard the preacher say i repeat it
[1:28:05] that doesn't work it has no life
[1:28:09] i i heard i heard a good preacher and he
[1:28:12] tied together the doctrine i think i
[1:28:13] understand what the mystery under the
[1:28:15] seals were that's a repeat ministry
[1:28:17] that's not the true ministry
[1:28:20] but the true ministry is when god comes
[1:28:22] down and makes it real to you
[1:28:25] when you see the mystery underneath the
[1:28:27] mysteries when you see the mystery of
[1:28:29] god laying under those seals when you
[1:28:31] can identify and say i'm part of it amen
[1:28:34] there's something that changes amen now
[1:28:36] it's not a repeat ministry it's an
[1:28:38] original ministry
[1:28:40] and it's not here to please man
[1:28:44] it's not here to satisfy men
[1:28:47] but if you've ever come to that real
[1:28:48] revelation like the apostle paul did
[1:28:50] you're not here to please men your
[1:28:52] gospel is not here to please men because
[1:28:53] if you're here to please man you cannot
[1:28:54] please christ
[1:28:56] if you come under this revelation
[1:28:58] there's only one thing that matters and
[1:29:00] that's this word and that's this truth
[1:29:02] that's been given to us today it is
[1:29:04] quickening us it is changing us it is
[1:29:06] rapturing us it is resurrecting us and
[1:29:08] it is bringing us into the position he's
[1:29:10] always wanted us to be in
[1:29:12] it's the under the revelation the true
[1:29:15] revelation that's the only thing that
[1:29:17] matters
[1:29:20] i didn't receive this of man
[1:29:24] but didn't you listen to the tapes i
[1:29:25] listened tapes i read the quotes but i
[1:29:26] did not receive this of man
[1:29:29] i received it by the revelation of jesus
[1:29:31] christ
[1:29:32] it was christ speaking through that man
[1:29:34] it was christ speaking through the
[1:29:36] ministry it was christ laying on those
[1:29:37] tapes but it wasn't the hearing of this
[1:29:39] ear that brought the revelation it was a
[1:29:41] hearing of a different set of ears down
[1:29:43] here that quickened the seed the life
[1:29:45] and i said that's nothing but the truth
[1:29:47] not intellectually but in reality
[1:29:52] takes place in your mind will fade away
[1:29:54] but what takes place in your soul will
[1:29:55] be eternal
[1:29:58] never receive this by man
[1:30:00] was not taught this by man
[1:30:02] that's why we preach
[1:30:05] because it's the foolishness of
[1:30:06] preaching to save souls
[1:30:09] i'm not here to teach you the revelation
[1:30:11] of jesus christ i'm here to preach the
[1:30:12] revelation of jesus
[1:30:15] and if i'm faithful to preach the
[1:30:16] revelation of jesus christ christ is
[1:30:18] faithful to quicken the revelation in
[1:30:20] your hearts
[1:30:23] and then the mystery
[1:30:26] the secret of the message
[1:30:28] is to do the father's business
[1:30:31] to manifest the promised word for this
[1:30:34] day
[1:30:35] and the manifestation of the promised
[1:30:37] word in this day
[1:30:38] is jesus christ returning
[1:30:41] the headship
[1:30:43] coming in the bride
[1:30:45] the bride moving into the expression of
[1:30:47] the head the fullness of the word on
[1:30:49] display in a mini-membered body
[1:30:52] the very character nature life of jesus
[1:30:56] christ
[1:30:57] expressed
[1:30:59] in his bride
[1:31:01] that's the day you and i were chosen to
[1:31:03] live in
[1:31:04] what's it going to require
[1:31:06] a surrender
[1:31:09] a revelation
[1:31:11] and a surrender
[1:31:13] i say if god's given you the revelation
[1:31:15] what's your part the surrender
[1:31:18] he can supply the revelation but only
[1:31:20] you can supply the surrender
[1:31:23] is that true
[1:31:25] he's given the blood of the lamb
[1:31:28] but you must provide the testimony
[1:31:32] amen
[1:31:34] he can give the power of the holy ghost
[1:31:36] to be a witness
[1:31:38] but those who disciples are the ones
[1:31:39] that had to go and open their mouth in
[1:31:41] obedience
[1:31:42] god can give the holy ghost but you have
[1:31:44] to give
[1:31:46] the yielding to the spirit to open your
[1:31:48] mouth and you have to be the witness
[1:31:50] he can give the blood you have to give
[1:31:52] the testimony
[1:31:54] he can give the revelation but you have
[1:31:56] to speak
[1:31:58] but it's salvation when you believe in
[1:32:00] your heart and a revelation
[1:32:01] believe in your heart under
[1:32:02] righteousness but with the mouth
[1:32:04] confession is made into salvation
[1:32:07] god has faithfully done his part
[1:32:10] and i say god help me to faithfully do
[1:32:12] my part
[1:32:13] because i want to see the accuser of the
[1:32:15] brethren
[1:32:16] cast down
[1:32:20] can i read one more scripture
[1:32:23] revelation chapter 12.
[1:32:33] revelation chapter 12.
[1:32:38] verse 11 and they overcame him
[1:32:40] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[1:32:42] of their testimony and they love not
[1:32:44] their lives unto death
[1:32:46] therefore rejoice
[1:32:48] ye heavens
[1:32:50] what's going to cause the heavens to
[1:32:52] rejoice
[1:32:53] because there was a people on the earth
[1:32:55] who did not love their lives to death
[1:32:58] and that would give a true testimony
[1:33:02] do you realize that the action of the
[1:33:04] bride at the end time
[1:33:06] will cause a rejoicing in heaven
[1:33:09] because the accuser of the brother has
[1:33:10] been cast down and he's not there
[1:33:12] anymore
[1:33:13] and why is he not there because the end
[1:33:15] time bride will say the word
[1:33:18] and stand by the word and the word only
[1:33:22] shall give a true witness and a true
[1:33:24] testimony and he'll be cast down and the
[1:33:27] admonishment in the scripture was
[1:33:28] rejoice
[1:33:30] ye heavens
[1:33:32] and ye that dwell in them the cherubim
[1:33:35] the seraphim the heavenly host
[1:33:38] woe to the inhabitants of the earth and
[1:33:40] the sea for the devil has come down unto
[1:33:42] you having great wrath because he
[1:33:44] knoweth
[1:33:45] he hath but a short time
[1:33:48] when the bride goes up he comes down
[1:33:51] so what does what that makes you is an
[1:33:53] inhabiter of the heavenlies not an
[1:33:55] inhabiter of the earth
[1:33:57] sony says rejoice the heavenlies and all
[1:34:00] those that i have at them that's you
[1:34:03] when you get there in the full measure
[1:34:05] and the full revelation after the full
[1:34:07] catching away
[1:34:08] he won't be there
[1:34:11] and you won't be the only one rejoicing
[1:34:13] every other part of the heavenly host
[1:34:15] that god created to worship him in the
[1:34:16] heavenlies will be rejoicing as well
[1:34:19] because he's not there
[1:34:21] and he's not there
[1:34:22] because there was brethren
[1:34:25] who although they were accused
[1:34:27] they would testify
[1:34:29] they would testify of the true word
[1:34:31] revealed in their day
[1:34:33] and finally that testimony would bring
[1:34:35] an ultimate victory
[1:34:37] and all of heaven will rejoice
[1:34:40] that's the moment i'm living in
[1:34:43] that's the time i'm living for let's all
[1:34:46] stand
[1:34:52] oh this word is good friends
[1:34:57] and you never know what god's going to
[1:34:59] say on a wednesday night
[1:35:03] don't skip church
[1:35:08] god is so good to us
[1:35:11] this is the greatest day to be alive
[1:35:15] no time like this time this is the time
[1:35:18] this is the last moment these are the
[1:35:20] last strokes the last blows the last
[1:35:22] testimonies the last confessions
[1:35:25] this is it this is the time to be alive
[1:35:27] i don't want to miss it being lazy
[1:35:29] i don't want to miss it chasing rabbits
[1:35:31] and getting distracted i want to be
[1:35:33] tuned in because this is the time
[1:35:36] it's going to cause a rejoicing in
[1:35:38] heaven
[1:35:39] oh god is good peter if you'd like to
[1:35:43] make it around back and whoever wants to
[1:35:44] go around back with you can go
[1:35:46] brother bob if you want to get around
[1:35:48] there and get ready we'll have a
[1:35:49] baptismal service
[1:35:52] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:35:55] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[1:35:58] oh god thank you this doesn't even seem
[1:36:00] like enough lord to say thank you it's
[1:36:02] just words lord coming off of frail
[1:36:04] human lips
[1:36:06] but god you know it's coming out of the
[1:36:07] depths of our heart
[1:36:09] how can we ever thank you enough
[1:36:12] for revealing this word to us
[1:36:14] for peeling back the seals for
[1:36:17] thundering out the thunders lord for
[1:36:19] showing us the mystery your mystery
[1:36:23] on top of all of that lord
[1:36:26] you showed us our part in the mystery
[1:36:30] we weren't just looking as spectators
[1:36:32] at the unfolding of the word but as the
[1:36:34] mystery unfolded
[1:36:36] we saw a threefold revelation
[1:36:40] when we saw a threefold revelation we
[1:36:41] were directed to the second fold
[1:36:44] of that threefold revelation
[1:36:46] and we were told that the second fold is
[1:36:49] your preeminence in us
[1:36:51] and as we saw the unveiling of you god
[1:36:55] as you were unveiling yourself and
[1:36:57] unveiling your plan
[1:36:59] unveiling your revelation
[1:37:01] you were showing us that we've always
[1:37:03] been part of that mystery
[1:37:06] oh god what a privilege
[1:37:08] what a privileged people we are of all
[1:37:10] human beings that have ever walked the
[1:37:12] earth i feel the luckiest lord the most
[1:37:14] blessed the most lord i just cherish
[1:37:17] this
[1:37:18] revelation help us god not to be lazy
[1:37:21] and let not let us not lose it let it
[1:37:23] not fade away
[1:37:25] but lord let it always be precious to us
[1:37:29] may we always dig and strive and reach
[1:37:32] out
