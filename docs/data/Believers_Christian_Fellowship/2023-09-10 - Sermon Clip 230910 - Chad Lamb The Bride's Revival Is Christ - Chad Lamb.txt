you know there was prophecies laying in the Bible amen Prophecies of Joel Prophecies of David types and shadows All Through the Bible when we come to the day of Pentecost amen and Jesus had died he had resurrected amen he had shown himself to disciples he had raised again they knew that Jesus was the Messiah they knew that he had died they knew he raised again they they knew he was on the right hand of power they knew all of these things but yet they were waiting for something amen they were waiting for a designation for a marker for a happening for an event to launch them into their Ministry and so they were waiting for 10 days in the upper room amen but then all of a sudden the promise of the fathers came the Fulfillment of the scripture amen the prophecy now come into manifestation and when that happened amen The Men Who were frightened before the men who who were discouraged and unsure and uncertain and all of these things that were going on now all of a sudden they were filled with the spirit of God they changed with a boldness they ran out into the street and with a boldness they proclaimed this is nothing but the word of God this is that and this is this and this is that and now they were taking the word and they were placing it what happened to their faith when they realized this is the scripture fulfilled this is the prophecy come this is the marker of time now it's not a prophecy now it's a happening it's no longer a prophecy it's a reality it's a manifestation the prophecy is now real what did it do to them it increased their faith it gave them lying like boldness it gave him the ability to go out on the face of everything and now declare the truth who were hiding before now the Spirit came according to the word and they were men that were bold they knew who they were they knew their position they knew what they were supposed to do and now there's something that's going to come under the revelation of the Seven Seals under the sounding of the seven Thunders under the third pool under the revealing of the Mysteries under the seventh Angels Ministry that will bring us back to that same faith what is it it's the revealing of the Mysteries what do you mean brother Chad it's the time date stamp marker you are here you are here and if you can receive it you are it and it brings us right back to the faith of the fathers now I know this is the day for prophecy to be filled modern events May clear by prophecy that is this what you see now is that prophecy being fulfilled amen when he promised that he would have a bride he's having a bride right now when he promised he would wash her with the water of the word the washing is taking place right now this is that we know who we are when the spirit was held back because the word was held back through the nominational rivers but in the evening time it's to be loosed by the evening time message the Holy Ghost back in the people again why there's no more false teaching barrier there's no more misunderstanding barrier but now when the word the revelation of the word comes back it it unlocks and unbinds the moving of the spirit to come back and make us what it intended to make us in the beginning he said You shall be endued with power from on high and ye shall be my Witnesses
