========================================

the children of god are born amen when the light of the age strikes that seed it comes to life when the pure unadulterated raw amen pure virgin word strikes a virgin seed it brings forth a virgin daughter but we don't manipulate it amen we don't change it we don't uh we don't make it uh more palatable or we don't add sugar to it to get the kids to take it those things are all dangerous that's reasoning and ideas of man trying to bring forth children amen we don't want to bring forth children we want to bring forth his seed amen and i only want to bring forth his seed if that's one more for the duration of our existence on this earth that's the only one we want that sounds horrible but that's the truth jesus came to seek and to save what was lost he came to save his own he said i didn't come i don't pray for the whole world amen i didn't come for the whole world but i come to say mine that we're in the world the ministry of jesus christ was the second to save that which was lost his own sheep that were lost and the ministry of christ is now in the bride paul and barnabas amen they're going in their journey and they're preaching amen and as they're preaching the jews begin to resist them and he said it was needful that the gospel be first preached to you but by seeing that you count yourself unworthy of eternal life lo we turn to the gentiles then the gentiles began to rejoice and be glad and as many as were ordained unto life believed they didn't all believe but those that were ordained to life believe amen and paul didn't have to change his gospel to get the jews to keep him in the synagogue a little bit longer so that he could win the gentiles [Music] what did he do he preached the gospel that got him rejected he preached the gospel that got him kicked out he preached the gospel that got him stoned he preached the gospel that had him hated but he preached the gospel that those who were ordained to life would believe because we're not bringing forth our own children amen the bride doesn't have her own seed she's not out there trying to find a seed so she can replicate replicate replicate he said many more are the children of the desert the the desolate than of the righteous it's not about winning numbers it's not a soul-winning program that's denominationalism amen it's about finding the lost seed and you can only find it with the true word for your day
