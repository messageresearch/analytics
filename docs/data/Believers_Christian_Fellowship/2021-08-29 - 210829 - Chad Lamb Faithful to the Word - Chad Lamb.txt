========================================

so here in the in the mount carmel showdown where elijah is restoring the the proper form of worship he's rebuilding the altar that was tore down he's bringing them to a showdown and he's asking them how long will you haul between two opinions he's saying now you're it's time to make a choice you can't just have everything right amen and brother ben said frankly i think it's going on worldwide he said it might be happening for you today but i frankly i think it's going worldwide but there's also coming a time where you're going to have to make a choice and i say don't wait for that day make the choice now will we have the world amen mixed with the message will we have old doctrines carried over from previous age mixed with the message or are we going to take the word and the word only the way a prophet gave it to us amen are we going to make a choice for the word and stay with the word regardless of whatever happens to us or what people think of us amen of separations and rejections and hardships let's take the word and the word only and take it the way a prophet delivered it to us amen and so elijah is saying it wasn't that they rejected altogether jehovah it wasn't that they accepted altogether baal they were mixing the two together and elijah was standing against hybrid religion because the elijah in our day was standing against hybrid religion he built back the altar of sacrifice he built back the proper form of worship and in the time of the evening sacrifice he called on god and god supernaturally vindicated his ministry we've had a replica in our day and the replica in our day is calling us to make a choice it's not just god sent a prophet god god sent a prophet to call us to an attention that would this is not pleasing to jehovah this mixing of these ideas he doesn't want any more mixing this isn't the day of mixing this isn't the day of partial understanding this is the day of the restoration of the headship of christ the word has come back to the church and god wants a people that will be faithful by their own choosing
