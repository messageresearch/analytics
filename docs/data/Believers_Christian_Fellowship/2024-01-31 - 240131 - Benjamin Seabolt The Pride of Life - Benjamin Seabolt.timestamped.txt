[11:20] come f
[11:24] it and made
[11:27] me
[11:31] let's pray this
[11:33] evening precious Lord Jesus
[11:37] we truly do want you to come and fill
[11:40] our cups
[11:43] Lord father but we know your Prophet
[11:46] said that you wanted to fill us more
[11:49] than we even wanted to be filled
[11:52] Lord so we have to come to a recognition
[11:55] father that in order for you to fill our
[11:58] cups we need to First empty ourselves
[12:01] out Lord and that's our purpose for
[12:03] being here tonight father is to lay
[12:07] ourself here on your altar and just
[12:09] empty ourselves out Lord of anything
[12:13] that would not be like you father that
[12:16] you would
[12:18] come Lord and
[12:21] just scour us out Lord with your
[12:24] word father that you can come and pour
[12:28] in the balm of Gad Father Like Only You
[12:31] Can Do Lord father we stand here a needy
[12:36] people Lord and that's bad enough within
[12:40] itself but we've come to the closing
[12:43] moments of time and we've come as a
[12:47] people that are called to Perfection
[12:49] Lord and we've come to a point Lord that
[12:53] as needy as we are we don't even know
[12:54] what we have need
[12:56] of so we would just ask Lord that that
[12:58] you would come and that you would empty
[13:00] us out completely father and that you
[13:03] would fill us with that which is needful
[13:06] that we can walk and do and be what you
[13:09] would have us be we just want to commit
[13:13] this service to you father Bo both
[13:17] hearer and
[13:19] speaker Lord we've done all that we can
[13:22] morly do at this point and we would just
[13:24] ask now that you would come and do the
[13:27] supernatural that you would accomplish
[13:30] your purpose for this service in the
[13:32] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[13:36] amen God bless you this evening it's
[13:40] certainly a pleasure and a honor to be
[13:42] with you we just invite you into the
[13:44] scriptures this evening to Philippians
[13:47] chapter
[13:52] 2 I just want to say I have
[13:56] certainly appreciated
[13:59] the messages that have went forth the
[14:01] last couple
[14:03] Services I started to say that I enjoyed
[14:05] them
[14:08] but it was maybe a little too close to
[14:11] home for
[14:13] enjoyment but I appreciated them amen
[14:17] and I will enjoy them I will make this
[14:21] flesh enjoy them it does not have a
[14:24] choice but I told him several years ago
[14:27] when he preached on Jacob and Esau for
[14:29] the first time that I was here that I
[14:31] was pretty well convinced it was the
[14:33] will of the Lord for him to preach on
[14:35] Jacob and Esau every service from
[14:37] thereafter so I think he's finally
[14:39] starting to yield himself to that Vision
[14:42] that I
[14:43] had I like preaching that's real saints
[14:46] and I like preaching that changes
[14:49] lives not just my life but my family's
[14:51] life my brothers and sisters
[14:54] lives and it's certainly being doing
[14:57] that whether it's pleasurable or not
[14:59] that doesn't make any difference but we
[15:01] want a real gospel we want to we want to
[15:04] serve a real and true God that can
[15:06] change our lives and can reveal to us
[15:09] where we're really
[15:10] at here in Philippians chapter
[15:16] 2 verse one it says if there therefore
[15:19] if there be therefore any consolation in
[15:23] Christ if any comfort of love if any
[15:27] Fellowship of the spirit if any bows and
[15:31] mercies fulfill fulfill ye my joy that
[15:35] ye be likeminded having the same love
[15:38] being of one
[15:40] Accord of one
[15:42] mind let nothing be done through Strife
[15:46] or vain
[15:47] Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each
[15:52] esteem other better than
[15:55] themselves and we just want to lay
[15:57] emphasis on that verse tonight let
[16:01] nothing be done through Strife or vain
[16:03] Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each
[16:08] esteem other better than themselves look
[16:12] not every man on his own things but
[16:14] every man also on the things of
[16:17] others let this mind be in you which was
[16:20] also in Christ Jesus who being in the
[16:23] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[16:26] equal with God but may himself of no
[16:31] reputation and took upon him the form of
[16:33] a servant and was made in the likeness
[16:37] of men God bless you as you would have
[16:40] your seats this evening you all don't
[16:42] pay any attention to my emotions I've
[16:44] been that way for a couple weeks now
[16:46] after I read a quote that I'll get to
[16:48] here in a little bit
[16:51] but we're not here to play on your
[16:53] emotions we're we're we don't believe in
[16:56] doing that um but if if I'm an emotional
[16:59] wreck you just ignore that but I want to
[17:02] look here at verse three it says let
[17:06] nothing nothing is a big word covers a
[17:10] lot of things but the scripture says let
[17:18] nothing not even one
[17:24] thing be done through Strife or vain
[17:27] Glory
[17:30] that means by default that everything
[17:34] that we
[17:35] do should not involve Strife or any form
[17:39] of vain
[17:43] Glory but let each
[17:45] esteem other better than
[17:48] thems now skipping
[17:51] over to verse five it says let this mind
[17:54] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[17:56] so now the scripture is going to put us
[18:00] and reveal to us what was in the mind of
[18:03] Jesus
[18:05] Christ who being in the form of God
[18:08] remember we preached on that last couple
[18:10] times knew he knew where he came from
[18:13] and he knew where he was going he knew
[18:16] and had a proper understanding who he
[18:18] was so when this says who being in the
[18:21] form of God we know that this was not a
[18:23] flippant thought this was very firm he
[18:26] knew who he was yes am who being in the
[18:30] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[18:33] equal with god well why would it be
[18:36] robbery to be equal with God if you're
[18:38] God and this was not a confusing thought
[18:41] to him he knew who he was
[18:44] amen but with that
[18:48] Revelation but made himself of no
[18:53] reputation and took upon him the form of
[18:56] a servant
[18:59] but made himself of no
[19:04] reputation
[19:06] none this would be equivalent to what we
[19:09] just read in verse three let nothing be
[19:12] done he made himself of no
[19:17] reputation we need to grasp this as we
[19:21] would start this thought here this
[19:24] evening he made himself of no reputation
[19:29] we have to understand that this was a
[19:31] man the only man that walked the face of
[19:34] the Earth who had a right to have any
[19:37] type of
[19:38] reputation in fact it was the only man
[19:40] that did
[19:41] have any form of what we would say good
[19:44] reputation we certainly came with a
[19:46] reputation and we probably don't want to
[19:48] discuss that this evening but here was
[19:51] the one and only man to set foot on this
[19:56] planet who would right Yul even have a
[19:59] possibility to have any
[20:05] reputation let alone the reputation that
[20:08] he did have as literally God himself on
[20:11] Earth the Son of God
[20:14] so he came as not only the only one
[20:18] having the right to have any type of
[20:22] reputation but he came as one with the
[20:26] greatest reputation right
[20:30] amen so we we have to grasp this we have
[20:33] to understand this it would be something
[20:37] if there was you know maybe a scale that
[20:40] we had to work with to balance this out
[20:43] but we
[20:44] don't because we don't have another
[20:46] example of this we don't have example a
[20:49] oh that man he had a right to be you
[20:52] know a one on a scale of 1 to 10 when it
[20:55] comes to
[20:56] reputation we don't have that the
[20:59] scripture says that we have all sinned
[21:01] and fell short of the glory of
[21:04] God so here's a man finally arrives on
[21:09] the
[21:11] scene and I think we would be kidding
[21:15] ourselves if we didn't think that up to
[21:17] this point that there were men already
[21:19] on the scene who tried to make
[21:21] themselves a
[21:23] reputation who tried to present them as
[21:27] being a good good man or better man or
[21:31] the best man I'm sure there was the
[21:35] whole gamut that was on display when it
[21:37] came to reputations prior to Jesus
[21:39] Christ showing
[21:41] up but now one finely does arrive who
[21:46] has a right to declare himself if he so
[21:50] chooses that I have a good
[21:54] reputation not only do I have a good
[21:56] reputation I have the best
[22:01] reputation and not only do I have the
[22:03] best reputation but you don't even have
[22:05] a good
[22:06] reputation in fact you don't even have a
[22:09] good reputation because all you have is
[22:12] a bad reputation yeah that's right you
[22:15] see the scale that we have to work with
[22:17] here it's unprecedented
[22:20] yeah but there here is a man standing
[22:24] where no man has
[22:26] stood
[22:28] and he would not even allow himself to
[22:31] have a one on a scale of 1 to
[22:38] 10 the scripture says
[22:41] he made
[22:45] himself nobody else you say well the
[22:48] Romans did that they trashed his
[22:50] reputation they told no no no no no
[22:54] Saints the Roman government had no
[22:56] control over this man 's reputation
[23:00] amen he voiced this when he came before
[23:02] Pilate you have no power over me unless
[23:05] it was given to you by God unless it
[23:07] unless I gave it to you you have no
[23:13] power you say the culture did it the
[23:17] murmuring the
[23:19] rumors no the scripture says he made
[23:25] himself of no reputation
[23:35] the only
[23:36] man who could have
[23:39] had a little bit of a
[23:41] reputation made himself of no
[23:46] reputation none nothing we have to grasp
[23:50] that not even he's a pretty good
[23:54] Carpenter right he's pretty well behaved
[23:57] as a child he made himself of no
[24:03] reputation everything that was said
[24:05] about this man was
[24:06] bad
[24:08] illegitimate mom had an affair with a
[24:11] soldier you name it everything that was
[24:14] said even before he showed
[24:17] up even before he showed up his
[24:21] reputation was already
[24:26] gone and I don't find one
[24:29] place in this book where he tried to
[24:32] change
[24:35] it the only man who had an argument
[24:39] contrary came that way even before he
[24:42] got here allowed it to be
[24:44] trashed a while he was here allowed it
[24:47] to be trashed and after he left allowed
[24:50] it to still be trashed and he's never
[24:52] tried to change it
[24:56] since amen
[25:00] and if
[25:01] that wasn't humble
[25:05] enough the scripture says that he took
[25:09] upon him the form of a
[25:13] servant so now not only has he allowed
[25:15] his reputation to be
[25:19] trashed but he would go and he would
[25:21] pick up the lowest reputation that he
[25:23] could
[25:24] find of those that were out there
[25:28] not his reputation but he would go and
[25:30] pick up that of a
[25:32] servant took the form of a servant and
[25:36] was
[25:36] made in the likeness of
[25:39] men and being
[25:42] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[25:46] himself and became obedient unto death
[25:50] even the death of the
[25:54] Cross so once again the man the only man
[25:57] to come to this planet that had a chance
[26:01] to make himself of a little bit of
[26:03] something said I will not do that and
[26:08] he humbled himself not only to have no
[26:13] reputation but to have the to become in
[26:17] the form of a servant and then to allow
[26:21] himself to Die the crest death on a
[26:25] cross for
[26:28] for
[26:33] what what did he do that for Saints who
[26:36] did he do that
[26:44] for for a 5'
[26:47] 10 150 lb Benjamin seab
[26:51] ball who would show up one
[26:54] day and he would think that he was a
[26:57] little bit of something
[27:02] something that he would think that he
[27:04] was a pretty good
[27:06] Christian that he would think he's got
[27:10] his act pretty well
[27:13] together that's what this man did that
[27:17] for he did all of that for somebody that
[27:20] would show up and be on the exact
[27:22] opposite end of the scale yeah who had
[27:26] no rights to declare himself as any type
[27:29] of reputation other than a bad one born
[27:32] in sin shaped in iniquity come to the
[27:35] world speaking life hybrid in a hybrid
[27:38] form violating the very essence of God
[27:41] in his first commandment let every seed
[27:43] bring forth of his kind we would show up
[27:46] in that condition in that situation with
[27:49] this as an example but yet we would
[27:51] somehow manage to by his grace get
[27:54] ourselves out of bed and take the Breath
[27:56] of Life in that he would would give us
[27:58] and somehow proceed throughout the
[28:01] day thinking that we're
[28:04] something I don't want to say we I'll
[28:06] say I I'm not preaching at you I'm
[28:08] preaching I'm preaching
[28:11] here how does that happen Saints how do
[28:14] we go from this level of humility God
[28:17] himself in flesh to crawling out of bed
[28:21] by the strength that he gave us by the
[28:22] life that he put in us how do we go from
[28:26] this example to all of a sudden
[28:29] thinking we're a pretty good message
[28:36] believer I'm a pretty good
[28:40] Deacon I'm a pretty good
[28:46] preacher how do we get
[28:48] there how does that happen when this
[28:52] example is there again I'm not preaching
[28:54] to you maybe I need to turn around and
[28:56] preach this way
[28:59] where's my cardboard cutout that I
[29:00] always say that I'm going to bring of my
[29:03] picture but how do we get there yeah how
[29:07] does how do we allow that to
[29:15] happen it's kind of
[29:18] mindboggling how we go from one end of
[29:21] the spectrum of right to totally off the
[29:25] end of the spectrum this way man who had
[29:28] the right to make himself something to a
[29:31] person who has no rights to
[29:36] nothing no thoughts of
[29:40] anything wouldn't even be able to get
[29:42] out of bed if it wasn't for his grace
[29:44] wouldn't be able to breathe if it wasn't
[29:45] for his grace wouldn't be able to even
[29:49] know there was a God if it wasn't for
[29:51] his grace let alone know that this God
[29:55] cared so much for me that he sent a
[29:56] voice in my age and this is that
[29:59] voice if that doesn't humble us Saints
[30:04] when there's billions of people on the
[30:05] face of the Earth and now there's this
[30:08] tiny minor percentage who knows there is
[30:11] a true God yeah who isn't out of their
[30:17] out of their mind so to speak
[30:19] naturally thinking that there's Little
[30:22] Green Men chasing them all over the
[30:23] place every
[30:26] day
[30:28] but we're in our in our natural sound
[30:32] mind but yet we
[30:36] would we would have him revealed to us
[30:40] not only that he is God and that he has
[30:43] sent a voice and he would by his grace
[30:46] let us know where that voice can be
[30:49] found but then to continue our
[30:52] Revelation in that to let us know that's
[30:55] not only just a voice that I sent to you
[30:56] but that's actually me showing up in
[30:58] your age and by the way this is my
[31:01] second coming this is how I chose to
[31:03] come the second time and and I've come
[31:06] to call you to come to come home with
[31:10] me and now I'm going to give you a
[31:12] message to to give you the
[31:16] power to overcome this Lan CH this a lan
[31:20] age and to to come up higher out of that
[31:23] and to be with me in a spiritual
[31:25] condition and going to culminate that by
[31:28] actually removing you from this
[31:30] Dimension and changing the atoms in your
[31:32] flesh yes because in case you forgot
[31:36] which I know that you have by this
[31:38] point your flesh is no
[31:42] good see the reason that I had to do all
[31:45] of that to reveal you to you that I was
[31:47] God and that I sent you a voice and that
[31:49] I came in that voice and through that
[31:51] voice I'm drawing you back to myself the
[31:54] the reason that I have to do all that is
[31:56] I have to come to remind
[31:59] you that you're
[32:03] nothing but somehow through this process
[32:06] of him coming and pouring all the grace
[32:09] that he can muster upon me somehow
[32:11] during that
[32:14] process in the greatness of the
[32:16] Revelation in the greatness of the
[32:18] understanding of where we're at and
[32:20] what's going on and what's happening and
[32:22] the changing that it's doing in my life
[32:24] and the changing that it's doing in my
[32:25] mind somehow in in all of that we lose
[32:29] the whole principle of the fact that he
[32:31] had to do all of
[32:33] this because I'm
[32:36] nothing and I don't have my act together
[32:39] and I was born in sin and shaped in
[32:40] iniquity and I have no reputation other
[32:43] than a bad reputation which is deserved
[32:45] me
[32:53] am the reason we find ourselves in this
[32:56] position
[32:59] is because this was injected into the
[33:01] human race at the
[33:03] fall it's called the pride of
[33:06] life and that's my topic for this
[33:09] evening the pride of
[33:15] life I have come to a revelation the
[33:18] last couple
[33:19] months that the pride of life is
[33:21] probably the most
[33:23] evilest
[33:25] wickedest abomination
[33:27] that has ever touched the human
[33:30] race you say well what about adultery
[33:33] and Heathen worshiping
[33:35] and that stuff
[33:38] PS in comparison to the pride that I
[33:42] find Within
[33:44] Myself even after
[33:48] conversion the pride of
[33:52] life goes so much deeper and so much
[33:55] higher and so much wider than I ever
[33:58] ever contemplated
[34:02] before and it is absolutely
[34:06] repulsive the effects that it has on our
[34:10] everyday living it is
[34:13] repulsive the effects that it has on our
[34:16] thought
[34:18] processen Ezekiel 2 verse two says son
[34:23] of man say unto the prince of Tyrus thus
[34:25] saith the Lord God but because thine
[34:28] heart is lifted up and thou Hast said I
[34:31] am God I sit in the seat of God in the
[34:34] midst of the
[34:36] Seas yet thou art a man and not God
[34:40] though thou set thine heart as the heart
[34:42] of
[34:43] God here's a scripture addressing an
[34:48] individual and we know this individual
[34:51] represented
[34:52] Lucifer and this scripture is addressing
[34:56] Lucifer
[34:57] ER saying because thine heart is lifted
[35:01] up so it it Reveals His
[35:04] condition because thine heart is lifted
[35:07] up because thy heart is prideful because
[35:10] of the pride of life in
[35:12] you you
[35:15] say I am God I sit in the seat of God in
[35:19] the midst of the Seas yet thou art a man
[35:22] and not God so because of the pride of
[35:26] life
[35:27] this
[35:30] man expresses
[35:33] himself I am
[35:36] God you say well I would never go that
[35:39] far
[35:41] brother have you ever taken your way
[35:44] over the word of
[35:55] God
[35:57] you may have never verbalized
[36:01] it but the minute that we get up
[36:07] here this is what the word of God says
[36:12] but you might as well just put your name
[36:14] right there in Ezekiel 2 I might as well
[36:17] put my name right there in Ezekiel
[36:20] 2 it's off of the same tree Saints the
[36:23] tree of the knowledge of Good and
[36:25] Evil that's where this man came from
[36:29] this where this is where this condition
[36:31] came from and the
[36:33] minute that we exalt ourself and our
[36:37] thinking over the word of God we've put
[36:39] oursel right there where that man
[36:42] was but remember that's what that man
[36:45] said that's not what God said that's
[36:48] what that man was
[36:50] saying God's response
[36:53] was thou art a
[36:55] man
[36:58] and not
[37:01] God so he brings a proper identification
[37:05] back to the
[37:07] situation you're a man you are not god
[37:12] let's establish that first and foremost
[37:14] so that we have something to work with
[37:17] remember I'm the one with the reputation
[37:20] you're the one without the reputation
[37:23] although he would never say that because
[37:24] he would never make himself of any
[37:27] reputation but he's sure going to bring
[37:30] a proper
[37:31] identification you are a man and not
[37:35] God though thou set thine heart as the
[37:38] heart of
[37:40] God skipping all the way down to verse
[37:43] 17 still speaking of Lucifer here thine
[37:47] heart was lifted
[37:50] up thine heart was lifted
[37:55] up where's 's the problem at it's in the
[37:58] heart your heart was lifted
[38:01] up I would be very confident in saying
[38:05] there's nobody that even before you walk
[38:08] out of here tonight as you walked in
[38:10] here this evening I would venture to say
[38:12] that none of you was out and about today
[38:15] telling vocalizing verbalizing to people
[38:19] of how great you
[38:21] were I'm confident that I associate with
[38:25] that kind of people
[38:27] people although your laughter is making
[38:29] me very nervous about that
[38:35] Revelation it's not what we
[38:39] verbalize it's what's in the
[38:42] heart thine heart was lifted up because
[38:45] of thy
[38:46] Beauty what beauty do we have we have
[38:49] the beauty of this
[38:50] message but will we allow our heart to
[38:53] be lifted up because of the beauty that
[38:55] this message is revealed build us
[38:58] in do we allow that to happen do we
[39:02] allow the beauty that he has closed
[39:04] clothed us with the beauty of the Bride
[39:06] do we allow the beauty of being his
[39:10] bride to lift up our
[39:15] heart I'm a pretty good
[39:18] Christian I'm a pretty good message
[39:20] believer I certainly don't believe like
[39:23] that guy
[39:25] does
[39:26] I mean you all heard what that church
[39:28] over there was doing didn't
[39:34] you thine heart was lifted
[39:37] up because of thy Beauty thou Hast
[39:40] corrupted thy wisdom there wasn't
[39:43] anything wrong with the wisdom there
[39:44] wasn't anything wrong with the
[39:45] Revelation there wasn't anything wrong
[39:47] with the message there wasn't anything
[39:49] wrong with us being his bride but we in
[39:51] our heart somehow corrupted that amen
[39:55] and now
[39:57] allow it to have an effect that it
[39:59] shouldn't have even if we would never
[40:02] verbalize it or vocalize it within our
[40:04] heart we would be lifted up to where we
[40:07] would think somehow some way we have
[40:10] some type of
[40:11] reputation you say well I don't think
[40:13] that why do we spend so much time
[40:16] defending our reputation if we don't
[40:18] think we have a
[40:21] reputation one person say one thing
[40:24] that's not even half bad about and we
[40:26] lose our minds and we will spend three
[40:29] days sorting it out to make that right
[40:31] and make that brother correct
[40:33] himself true
[40:36] why the pride of
[40:38] life the evil dark dirty sinful
[40:46] yeah devil yeah of the pride of life
[40:50] amen we will spend three
[40:54] days because our feelings got to a
[40:56] little bit hurt and because if that
[40:59] brother tells this brother over here and
[41:00] it gets back to that sister they may
[41:04] think of my
[41:08] reputation somehow we've allowed the
[41:11] wisdom and the
[41:13] beauty to not have its full effect on
[41:16] our life and remove that aspect out of
[41:19] our
[41:20] life because our heart gets lifted
[41:25] up
[41:32] you see we can get our feelings hurt in
[41:34] that
[41:35] area because we have pride associated
[41:38] with how good of a Christian we
[41:44] are if you come to me and you tell me
[41:47] Benjamin seol you are the absolute worst
[41:50] mechanic I have ever met in my entire
[41:53] life you are awful you could not put a
[41:56] nut on a bolt if you had
[41:59] to you can't even rotate the tires on my
[42:03] car correctly you can't change the oil
[42:05] you are hands down the worst mechanic
[42:09] ever on the face of the Earth I'm here
[42:12] to tell you it is not going to bother me
[42:15] one
[42:20] bit if I
[42:23] hear that my brother
[42:26] second cousin by marriage to the third
[42:29] degree divided by the square OT of
[42:32] 64 was a little confused about something
[42:35] I said when I preached the other day I
[42:38] lose my
[42:43] mind
[42:48] why
[42:50] why the pride of
[42:52] life the
[42:54] devil of the pride of of
[42:57] life I'm not a good mechanic I'm not
[43:00] even a mechanic I'm not even able to
[43:03] stand by a
[43:04] mechanic it's not going to bother me a
[43:07] bit right I don't care it's true I'm the
[43:12] worst mechanic ever that's walked the
[43:13] face of the Earth if you don't believe
[43:15] me lean me your car for a week just an
[43:19] hour you got a Ratt on your dash I
[43:22] assure you when you get your car back
[43:24] the last thing on your mind will be a
[43:26] rattle in your
[43:29] dash I don't
[43:32] care but I am a
[43:36] minister am and that not of myself
[43:40] that's just the grace of God but somehow
[43:43] the beauty of the wisdom and the beauty
[43:47] of the
[43:48] message somehow in all of that I would
[43:52] have pride in my heart that you are a
[43:55] minister of the message message and this
[43:57] person over here I won't go through the
[43:59] whole equation again but you all got the
[44:01] point that you'll never even meet in
[44:03] your entire life was a little bit
[44:05] confused about something you said and
[44:07] might they might think that you were
[44:09] slightly
[44:12] off and I'll lose sleep over that why
[44:16] the pride of
[44:19] life the pride of
[44:23] life because it's something I care about
[44:26] and look I'm not trying to be fanatical
[44:28] about that you can't be a minister and
[44:30] not care about anything that you say or
[44:34] that people think like there has to be
[44:37] some concern there you have to have a
[44:38] heart for the people we're not here to
[44:41] you know say whatever we want to say and
[44:42] I don't care how you feel about it don't
[44:44] like that's you understand that's not
[44:45] the
[44:47] point it's not that we want to be
[44:50] Reckless with that
[44:52] Revelation the point is the pride that's
[44:54] attached to that to the IND indidual
[44:57] that's the evil
[44:58] part we have to submit ourselves one to
[45:03] another and that goes for ministers as
[45:05] well as the Le so it's not that we can
[45:08] ever take an attitude well nothing
[45:09] bothers me I heard this I don't care you
[45:11] know I'll preach what everyone preach
[45:12] and I don't care what it's not that at
[45:15] all it's just why does that bother your
[45:18] pride if somebody would think that
[45:20] you're wrong on something
[45:23] yeah now you can put that in whatever
[45:26] position you need to put it in if you're
[45:27] not a minister and you're a deacon make
[45:29] your put it in that
[45:31] position you're not a deacon you're you
[45:33] sing a special and you heard that
[45:36] somebody from another church listened to
[45:38] it and thought you were slightly off key
[45:41] why are you losing sleep over
[45:42] that the only reason that bothers you is
[45:45] if you think you're a pretty good singer
[45:47] yeah right I picked on myself for there
[45:50] a little while I get a pick on somebody
[45:51] else now because Lord knows I'm not a
[45:53] singer you can't put me in that group
[45:57] why would that bother
[45:59] you unless you had a
[46:03] thought amen that they shouldn't say
[46:06] that about me because because why yeah
[46:11] why shouldn't they say that about you
[46:14] amen yes because maybe it's not fair oh
[46:18] let's talk about
[46:24] fair fair born let me remind you of fair
[46:28] born in sin shaped in iniquity come to
[46:30] the world speaking
[46:33] lies cost the only innocent man that
[46:36] ever walked the face of his this Earth
[46:39] his
[46:40] life because of your fairness
[46:44] yeah let's not talk about Fair we don't
[46:47] want Fair
[46:49] Saints we don't want
[46:53] fair fair puts us in the deepest darkest
[46:57] hottest hell that there
[46:59] is
[47:01] period am that's fair
[47:09] yeah I don't want fair I want
[47:15] Mercy but we
[47:21] see how that we can so easily be
[47:24] offended
[47:28] and be be
[47:31] prideful about
[47:33] things that we would not consider
[47:36] evil look it's not like we have
[47:39] somebody attacking a reputation well I
[47:43] drank five beers and you only drank
[47:45] four and now you're offended because
[47:47] you're not the best Drinker I I think
[47:50] we're a little ways beyond that Saints
[47:52] but I'm here to tell you it's still the
[47:55] pride of life and it's off the exact
[47:57] same tree amen true the demon that'll
[48:02] cause that man to drink himself into a
[48:04] stuper just to prove he's more of a man
[48:07] than the hill belly sitting next to him
[48:08] on the bar who dranks six and I can
[48:10] drink Seven well I drink Seven now I'll
[48:12] drink eight it's the same thing that
[48:15] will cause you to lose sleep because
[48:17] somebody said something that offended
[48:19] you or might even possibly offend you or
[48:22] might possibly offend one of your
[48:23] neighbor kids about how of a Believer
[48:26] you
[48:29] are that fell off of the same tree and
[48:33] it's the same
[48:36] spirit it's the exact same
[48:41] Spirit and the spirit's name is the
[48:44] pride of
[48:45] life and it's the ugliest one that fell
[48:48] off of the
[48:53] tree Proverbs 6
[48:56] 16 these six things doth the Lord doeth
[49:00] the Lord
[49:01] hate yay seven are an Abomination unto
[49:05] him guess what number one
[49:08] is a proud
[49:12] look I want to remind you this is the
[49:14] list of things that not God don't really
[49:17] like or kind of annoys him am finds it
[49:22] frustrating wish it would go away no
[49:25] this is the
[49:27] list of the things God
[49:32] hates and seven are an Abomination unto
[49:35] him number one being a proud
[49:40] look you say well I don't get up in the
[49:42] morning and look at myself in the mirror
[49:44] and be like well kind of no no no that's
[49:47] not it you may never look in a
[49:52] mirror but you may carry your reputation
[49:56] around in this shiny little crystal
[49:59] glass
[50:02] jar
[50:05] oh that was a bad situation did you see
[50:08] how well I handled
[50:14] that oh look how I tied those two
[50:16] scriptures together right
[50:24] there it's closer than we think
[50:27] Saints it's closer than we think a proud
[50:30] look God hates
[50:38] it a proud
[50:44] look let me say it this way looking
[50:52] proud trying to look proud
[50:55] being proud of how you
[50:59] look your look is not natural it can be
[51:05] naturally vision of course but we're a
[51:09] spiritual people remember and I think
[51:12] this is applying not to one but
[51:19] both there's maybe sometimes we should
[51:22] be more proudful of how we look
[51:29] naturally brother R says the holy spirit
[51:32] will clean you
[51:36] up he typed that to Natural
[51:40] hygiene he says the holy spirit will
[51:43] clean you up talking about dirty
[51:45] fingernails and stuff everybody put
[51:48] their hands in their pockets for a
[51:52] minute he said the Holy Spirit would
[51:55] naturally clean you up that you wouldn't
[51:58] go around with just being
[52:04] dirty
[52:07] but we'll spend so much time on
[52:12] that and we
[52:14] won't go around talking about how good
[52:17] we
[52:18] look I mean at least I hope we
[52:23] don't you understand
[52:25] we will spend so much time on our
[52:28] outward appearance and we don't try to
[52:32] make it of any
[52:34] reputation but we will spend such little
[52:37] time on our spiritual
[52:40] reputation but we'll spend so much time
[52:43] defending
[52:46] it this is a
[52:51] paradox why because of the pride of life
[53:00] a proud look a lying tongue and hands
[53:02] that shed innocent blood I want you to
[53:06] notice the group of
[53:10] other characters that this is
[53:14] with I mean we so easily blow right over
[53:18] oh a proud look well I'm not that a ly
[53:20] tongue I tell the truth sh I wouldn't
[53:22] shed innocent
[53:24] blood look at the group that
[53:27] Pride keeps the company that Pride
[53:34] keeps a
[53:38] liar I mean if we CAU somebody lying in
[53:42] the church we're going to deal with that
[53:44] it's going to go under church discipline
[53:46] would it
[53:49] not somebody that murdered somebody
[53:53] innocent blood like we're going to deal
[53:55] with
[53:59] that a man that's sitting around
[54:02] devising Wicked
[54:04] imaginations that's not going to go very
[54:10] far feet that's always running to get
[54:13] into trouble the deacons are going to
[54:16] handle
[54:18] that a false witness somebody constantly
[54:22] lying about their neighbor their
[54:24] brother's or sister that's not going to
[54:27] be
[54:29] acceptable and he that's constantly
[54:32] trying to break up Brotherhood sewing
[54:34] Discord among brother why is it that we
[54:37] will deal with six of those seven and
[54:39] not touch the seventh
[54:44] one
[54:47] why why will I not deal with the first
[54:51] one I will give my life fighting against
[54:56] those other
[54:57] six but I won't even address the first
[55:02] one and it is probably the ring leader
[55:06] of the whole
[55:07] group right you take pride out of that
[55:10] out of that group not going to be any
[55:13] honor among Thieves it they're just
[55:15] going to
[55:16] fall why would a man lie if it doesn't
[55:20] have to do with
[55:24] pride
[55:25] why y right did you steal the cookie no
[55:28] I didn't steal the cookie why are you
[55:30] lying about stealing the cookie because
[55:31] you're afraid you might get in trouble
[55:32] you'll be labeled as a thief Pride I
[55:36] mean it's I know that's a ridiculous
[55:37] example but I'm
[55:39] serious pride is associated with all of
[55:42] these it's because of Pride you tell a
[55:45] lie it's because of Pride that you would
[55:48] kill an innocent
[55:52] man pride is associated with all all of
[55:55] those false
[55:57] witness why would you want to break up
[56:00] Brotherhood if it wasn't for
[56:04] Pride well I'm a little better preacher
[56:06] than he is I got a little bit better
[56:09] light on the
[56:11] subject
[56:14] I'm he's not quite as spir you know I
[56:19] won't say it because I don't want to
[56:21] talk bad about my brother but you
[56:23] understand
[56:25] let's bring it home Hey listen my feet
[56:28] are on fire too it's not just yours
[56:30] don't worry like I'm looking for a trash
[56:33] can I'm looking for a fire extinguisher
[56:35] it's not just
[56:36] you when it comes home it comes home and
[56:40] I haven't even got to the good stuff yet
[56:42] and we're already on
[56:46] fire why would you want to break up
[56:49] Brotherhood find me one reason that you
[56:52] would want to break up Brotherhood I'm
[56:55] not saying that every time something is
[56:56] broken up that it's evil I mean God
[56:58] himself came down separated Abraham and
[57:00] lot um there there's there's times that
[57:03] God does that but that's not what this
[57:06] is referring to it says it says it's
[57:08] referring to and he that Seth Discord
[57:11] among Brethren to break up the
[57:13] Brotherhood Abraham didn't have to seow
[57:15] Discord to break up the Brotherhood
[57:17] Abraham says you know what you take
[57:19] First Choice whatever you want I'll go
[57:22] the other way that's not so IND Discord
[57:25] among
[57:31] Brethren so in Discord is I heard that
[57:34] he said
[57:35] that
[57:37] right and he preached that the other day
[57:39] and
[57:42] that did you hear how he handled that
[57:45] situation the other
[57:46] day oh yeah yeah I heard I wouldn't have
[57:51] done that I wouldn't have done
[57:53] that
[57:57] did you hear what the deacons did the
[57:59] other
[58:01] day
[58:04] why why so Discord among
[58:08] Brethren the only reason that you're
[58:10] sewing Discord and that you have to
[58:12] point out what this guy did right is so
[58:14] that you can now tell that person how
[58:16] you would have handled it right right
[58:19] because of course you handle everything
[58:23] right right
[58:29] we laugh at this but it's astonishing
[58:33] whenever this is truly revealed to us
[58:36] and I'm not saying that I have a perfect
[58:38] perfect proper revelation of it but I'm
[58:40] just here to tell you when when the lid
[58:41] came off of this to me a couple months
[58:44] ago I have been repenting ever since for
[58:47] two solid months I've had to
[58:49] repent and just when I think I get done
[58:51] I remembered something that happened in
[58:52] the third grade and I'm like what was I
[58:58] thinking and Junior High what was I
[59:01] thinking when I was homeschooled what
[59:02] was I
[59:03] thinking at this day at work what was I
[59:07] thinking the pride of life is what I was
[59:10] thinking the pride of
[59:14] life and I'm not talking sinful things
[59:18] Saints by his grace I was born and
[59:20] raised in the message and by his grace
[59:22] i' I'm I'm not you know seen if you want
[59:25] to say most of the world and I'm
[59:27] thankful for that i' I've got no
[59:29] complaints I'm just saying that don't
[59:32] put it out there in the
[59:37] world here's a real Zinger as brother
[59:40] Brandon would say have you ever sat in a
[59:43] church service and God will
[59:45] supernaturally anoint The Man Behind the
[59:47] pull pit to come and preach something
[59:49] that you and a brother were just talking
[59:51] about and you you know it's super
[59:55] natural but yet somehow in the beauty of
[59:59] the Revelation that's going on
[1:00:01] somehow I will sit in my seat and I will
[1:00:08] think Peter just listen to
[1:00:13] me tried to tell
[1:00:19] him boy I sure hope he's hearing
[1:00:23] that you say that does doesn't happen oh
[1:00:26] let's not kid ourselves
[1:00:27] Saints let's not kid ourselves let's be
[1:00:31] real let's be genuine remember if we
[1:00:34] want him to fill our cup up we better
[1:00:36] empty it out
[1:00:38] first there is a genuiness to this
[1:00:42] gospel there is a reality to this gospel
[1:00:46] and we're not going to get it by faking
[1:00:48] it and not dealing with the things that
[1:00:51] are needing dealt with we're not not
[1:00:54] going to to get it just by blowing these
[1:00:57] things away and acting like they don't
[1:00:59] happen and acting like that we're okay
[1:01:01] and acting like we're good Christians
[1:01:03] and acting like we've got our act
[1:01:05] together and that we don't have these
[1:01:06] things to deal with that's right we
[1:01:10] better deal with them now of our own
[1:01:13] free
[1:01:14] choosing because there's scriptures here
[1:01:17] that promises us that if we don't he
[1:01:23] will
[1:01:26] and I believe with all of my
[1:01:30] heart the things that God is going to do
[1:01:34] with this bride before we leave this
[1:01:37] earth and the power that he is going to
[1:01:40] entrust into our hands and even onto the
[1:01:44] foolishness of our tongue and our
[1:01:48] lips it is not going to come into a
[1:01:52] vessel that hasn't dealt with these
[1:01:55] issues who has not dealt with the
[1:02:00] problem and the demon and the devil that
[1:02:04] will somehow still come into my brain
[1:02:07] when I'm sitting under supernaturally
[1:02:09] anointed preaching and a situation will
[1:02:12] be exposed and I somehow still allow
[1:02:16] myself to let the pride of life raise up
[1:02:20] and think something contrary against my
[1:02:23] brother
[1:02:25] you think for a second that God is going
[1:02:28] to put the power of the spoken word onto
[1:02:31] that tongue that still has those
[1:02:33] thoughts and who still will not deal
[1:02:36] with those thoughts and say that is a
[1:02:39] devil and I do not accept that and I
[1:02:42] will not think those thoughts right he
[1:02:46] is not going to do it
[1:02:52] Saints we've got to be be real with
[1:02:55] ourselves and we have got to come to an
[1:02:58] understanding of where we're at and What
[1:03:00] needs dealt
[1:03:05] with and I've got good news for you and
[1:03:08] I've got bad news for
[1:03:10] you the good news is I cannot preach
[1:03:14] this to you in a legalistic way for you
[1:03:16] to get
[1:03:18] it that's the good
[1:03:20] news the bad news is I cannot preach
[1:03:24] this to you in a legalistic way for you
[1:03:26] to get
[1:03:29] it this is so far past legalism amen
[1:03:34] from the pull
[1:03:35] pit that it's not even funny right true
[1:03:40] but it's not past legalism from your
[1:03:43] seat prise
[1:03:47] God I cannot preach you to this
[1:03:52] level nobody else can preach you to this
[1:03:55] level you have got to make a conscience
[1:03:58] decision in your own seat that there is
[1:04:01] a possibility that I'm not where I need
[1:04:04] to be and this man's inviting me to come
[1:04:06] up
[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:10] higher and as he stands there and makes
[1:04:13] a fool out of himself and exposes
[1:04:16] himself for the ridiculous thoughts that
[1:04:18] he would have in a church service where
[1:04:20] the Supernatural is going on I don't
[1:04:23] want to just judge that man but I want
[1:04:25] to take advantage of the fact that he's
[1:04:27] revealing that there are spirits still
[1:04:29] working within me that are not
[1:04:31] acceptable from the message of the hour
[1:04:33] and the word of God and I want to
[1:04:35] identify these Realms in my
[1:04:38] life and I want to deal with
[1:04:43] them and I do not want to walk out of
[1:04:46] these
[1:04:47] doors thinking that I'm
[1:04:50] okay when I still have the pride of life
[1:04:53] rise in up in my thought
[1:05:02] process brother Brandon says it's come
[1:05:05] to the point to where if I could just
[1:05:06] get the people and I could just not this
[1:05:08] is not verbatim but just jam it into
[1:05:11] them if I could take it and I could just
[1:05:13] put it into them to where I know that
[1:05:15] they got it I would do
[1:05:17] it but he couldn't he says I
[1:05:21] can't but that invitation is there
[1:05:27] that invitation is there and by God's
[1:05:30] grace and by Revelation when he exposes
[1:05:33] these things to us and through the
[1:05:35] foolishness of preaching and a man to
[1:05:37] come here and to say thing I'm not proud
[1:05:39] to stand and say that I've had these
[1:05:41] things we chuckle about it and we you
[1:05:43] know kind of laugh about it you know to
[1:05:45] keep the nervous tension away but it's
[1:05:47] repulsive
[1:05:49] Saints what part of me thinks that it's
[1:05:52] acceptable to have that thought process
[1:05:55] right to think as God is supernaturally
[1:05:58] speaking a word across the body of
[1:06:00] people that I can boy I hope they're
[1:06:03] getting
[1:06:04] that maybe I should get it
[1:06:08] amen maybe I should get the beam out of
[1:06:10] my eye yeah amen but we so easily do
[1:06:15] that and we so easily accept that right
[1:06:19] and if somebody would tell a lie we
[1:06:21] would be calling Church order and we
[1:06:22] would be dealing with it
[1:06:25] and if somebody would shed innocent
[1:06:27] blood we would be dealing with it
[1:06:29] immediately if somebody would be
[1:06:30] spreading rumors trying to break up
[1:06:32] Brotherhood we would deal with it that
[1:06:34] day we wouldn't let it go till the next
[1:06:35] day we would deal with it then but we
[1:06:38] won't deal with that Pride that's rising
[1:06:40] up during the service in our own mind we
[1:06:42] don't have to get a counsil together to
[1:06:44] deal with it we don't have to go to the
[1:06:46] pastor we don't have to get approval
[1:06:48] from the deacons we have the a the
[1:06:50] possibility and the permission to deal
[1:06:52] with it right then
[1:06:55] amen but we
[1:07:00] won't we'll just let it
[1:07:02] go let it sit there let it
[1:07:06] fester and think somehow that we're
[1:07:08] right in doing
[1:07:13] that we'll deal with all the other
[1:07:15] things but we won't deal with the main
[1:07:18] thing the ring leader of it the pride
[1:07:20] that's in
[1:07:22] ourselves amen I say God have mercy on
[1:07:26] us I say God have mercy on
[1:07:29] me Proverbs 8 the fear of the Lord is to
[1:07:32] hate evil pride and arrogancy and the
[1:07:36] evil way and the froward mouth do I
[1:07:40] hate the fear of the Lord is to hate
[1:07:44] let's call it for what it is the fear of
[1:07:46] the Lord is to hate evil amen now it
[1:07:50] gives us what evil is pride and
[1:07:53] arrogance
[1:07:55] Y and the evil way and the froward mouth
[1:07:58] do I
[1:08:00] hate Proverbs 13 only by Pride cometh
[1:08:05] contention but with the well advised is
[1:08:07] wisdom it is only with pride that you
[1:08:10] can have an argument with your brother
[1:08:13] why can you have an argument with your
[1:08:14] brother Pride because if you don't think
[1:08:18] you're right there is no argument if you
[1:08:21] approach it with I might be wrong
[1:08:23] because let's remember flashback born in
[1:08:26] sin shaped in iniquity come to the word
[1:08:28] speaking
[1:08:29] lies let's approach this conversation
[1:08:32] that way but we
[1:08:34] don't we approach it with I've been in
[1:08:37] the message for 40 years I've read the
[1:08:39] Seal's book three times Church age book
[1:08:45] six at the top of page 328 paragraph two
[1:08:48] I can tell you what the two purposes of
[1:08:50] the second forerunners to
[1:08:52] do
[1:08:54] oh what' you say brother I might be
[1:08:59] wrong let's make it real saints let's
[1:09:02] not act like it don't happen right why
[1:09:04] don't we approach the conversation so
[1:09:07] that there's not the possibility of
[1:09:10] contention and approach it with
[1:09:13] humility as in this drug head that was
[1:09:16] just saved 30 seconds ago might be able
[1:09:19] to tell me something I've never
[1:09:20] experienced
[1:09:22] before not with
[1:09:24] how in the world would he ever tell me
[1:09:25] nothing I don't
[1:09:31] know I'll give you a little clue for
[1:09:33] those of you whove by his grace been
[1:09:35] born and raised in the message those
[1:09:37] kind of people are going to open your
[1:09:39] eyes more than the people that's sitting
[1:09:40] in the church beside of you it's cuz
[1:09:43] they don't have the message
[1:09:45] filter they just speak what they know's
[1:09:47] truth that's they just call the
[1:09:49] principal for the principle and it's
[1:09:51] shocking and it will open your eyes and
[1:09:53] you could have sat in the message for 30
[1:09:55] years rubbing shoulders with everybody
[1:09:56] in the ranks of the message the problem
[1:09:58] with everybody in the ranks and in the
[1:09:59] circles they've all got the same
[1:10:02] Viewpoint I'm not saying on everything
[1:10:04] understand what I'm saying it's just I
[1:10:06] mean let's face it if you've been in
[1:10:08] this message for more than 10 years you
[1:10:12] you've probably heard just about
[1:10:13] everything around it
[1:10:15] right I mean I'm not trying to be funny
[1:10:18] that's just natural like if you go to
[1:10:19] the same place of work every day for 10
[1:10:22] years the water cooler rumors or
[1:10:25] whatever like you've probably heard all
[1:10:27] of them by this
[1:10:28] point it'll be somebody that comes in
[1:10:31] that's new that will be like hey did you
[1:10:33] hear you like what I never heard
[1:10:36] that it's the same thing spiritually
[1:10:39] speaking when you have the same
[1:10:41] viewpoints constantly around you and
[1:10:43] around the same people it's going to
[1:10:45] take somebody new also known as the drug
[1:10:48] head that was just saved 30 seconds ago
[1:10:50] to rock your world and to show you that
[1:10:54] maybe you haven't heard everything right
[1:10:56] I remember the first time this ever
[1:10:58] happened to me I was sitting in Beckley
[1:10:59] West Virginia and Perry green was given
[1:11:01] his testimony I was probably I don't
[1:11:03] know maybe 18 years old born and raised
[1:11:06] in the message Dad's a pastor I mean
[1:11:09] I've been there done that I've heard it
[1:11:10] all Perry green comes and he puts on his
[1:11:14] slideshow the picture of the prophet's
[1:11:17] profile in the
[1:11:18] cliff and I had never seen that picture
[1:11:22] before you you know what I'm talking
[1:11:24] about out in
[1:11:25] Arizona I had never seen that picture
[1:11:27] before
[1:11:29] since it blew my
[1:11:31] mind the profile of the prophet's face I
[1:11:34] mean
[1:11:35] it's I mean you can't miss it and I
[1:11:38] never seen that picture before and I'm
[1:11:41] sitting there in my
[1:11:42] seat and I see this picture for the
[1:11:44] first time and as an 18-year-old I had a
[1:11:47] great
[1:11:50] Revelation there's this small chance
[1:11:53] small I mean it's pretty much remember
[1:11:55] I'm 18 I'm an 18-year-old male it's
[1:11:58] pretty small but there is a chance I
[1:12:02] don't know
[1:12:03] everything and I haven't seen
[1:12:07] everything one picture was lifechanging
[1:12:09] for me God because it totally wrecked my
[1:12:13] world of thinking I'd seen everything
[1:12:14] and I'd read everything and I I don't
[1:12:16] say that lightly by his grace I was I
[1:12:20] was raised right and I had the proper
[1:12:22] things put before me as a child and I
[1:12:23] love the message I read the message I
[1:12:25] read the church I looked at the photos I
[1:12:28] listened to the testimonies I loved
[1:12:30] it but
[1:12:32] somehow somehow in the beauty of all of
[1:12:35] that
[1:12:38] wisdom I came to the conclusion that
[1:12:40] I've seen it all and then I know it
[1:12:44] all and
[1:12:46] now I'm 39 and it's happening all over
[1:12:50] again read one quote totally wrecks my
[1:12:53] my world am and I come back to the
[1:12:56] conclusion that maybe I got something to
[1:12:59] deal with
[1:13:00] yet maybe there's part of me that's not
[1:13:03] okay quite yet maybe I still got some
[1:13:12] problems I know you all are dying to
[1:13:14] hear that quote but I'm going to just
[1:13:16] keep on going
[1:13:19] here only by Pride cometh contention
[1:13:22] amen
[1:13:30] have you ever heard of discernment by
[1:13:32] the
[1:13:33] word we've heard that that saying
[1:13:35] discernment by the
[1:13:38] word when you
[1:13:40] see two
[1:13:42] brothers arguing about a spiritual
[1:13:46] principle and they're upset with each
[1:13:49] other here's the discernment by the word
[1:13:54] one of them most likely both of them are
[1:13:57] dealing with
[1:14:00] pride yes
[1:14:02] sir that's easy to say Amen to
[1:14:05] right let's go a little step
[1:14:08] further next time because there will be
[1:14:11] a next time that you find yourself
[1:14:14] getting a little hot under the
[1:14:17] collar right with your brother about a
[1:14:20] topic that he for whatever reason just
[1:14:22] somehow cannot
[1:14:26] grasp maybe we should use discernment by
[1:14:29] the word and realize there maybe might
[1:14:33] be some pride involved that's amen maybe
[1:14:38] not on his part
[1:14:40] only this would be proper discernment by
[1:14:43] the
[1:14:44] word sir you say well that's real simple
[1:14:47] that's real easy you know can you move
[1:14:49] on to the seventh seals and the coming
[1:14:52] of the Lord
[1:14:56] this is the coming of the Lord
[1:15:00] Saints brother Brandon would preach the
[1:15:02] seals you go back and read the seals
[1:15:04] almost every time that he would break a
[1:15:06] seal in his prayer he would said Lord
[1:15:08] please come and break this seal so that
[1:15:10] we know how to
[1:15:14] live well I want to know who the first
[1:15:16] horse rider is no you need to know how
[1:15:17] to live that's
[1:15:20] right who are them Souls under the
[1:15:22] prison you need to deal with your pride
[1:15:24] you need to know how to
[1:15:25] live you need to learn how to treat your
[1:15:28] brother you need to have you need to
[1:15:30] learn that you're probably not right all
[1:15:31] the
[1:15:33] time brother brandom says I thank God
[1:15:36] for the day that the seals broke
[1:15:38] in my
[1:15:41] life it was a wonderful thing Saints to
[1:15:43] have the seals come off of this
[1:15:45] book you would be ignorant to say
[1:15:50] otherwise I hope that's not a prideful
[1:15:52] statement
[1:15:56] I didn't have anything to do with it so
[1:15:57] I don't think it is you would be
[1:15:59] ignorant to think that the seals the
[1:16:02] interpretation of those symbols coming
[1:16:03] off of that book was not a marvelous
[1:16:06] event but how much more so when it has
[1:16:09] the effect of loosing the seals of our
[1:16:12] own
[1:16:15] life how much more so what good is it if
[1:16:19] he breaks the seals off of the written
[1:16:21] word but yet I'm still all closed up and
[1:16:24] can't see myself for who I
[1:16:26] am good and bad right so much more
[1:16:33] marvelous only by Pride cometh
[1:16:35] contention but with the well advised is
[1:16:39] wisdom Proverbs 16 Pride goeth Before
[1:16:43] Destruction the these are verses we
[1:16:45] learned in Sunday School saints why
[1:16:48] didn't we get it
[1:16:49] then Pride goeth Before Destruction
[1:16:54] you want to have a Sure Fire way to have
[1:16:59] your Meer reputation
[1:17:04] destroyed start thinking you have a
[1:17:06] reputation yeah it's scriptural you'll
[1:17:10] never beat it the moment that you think
[1:17:16] that the scripture kicks in oh Pride
[1:17:19] goeth Before Destruction there is
[1:17:21] probably hundreds of angels lined up on
[1:17:23] this Duty it's probably a task
[1:17:26] force like okay I am God I have to keep
[1:17:29] my word pride cometh Before Destruction
[1:17:31] oh there's one there's one there's one
[1:17:35] like they have to have a ladder going up
[1:17:37] and down
[1:17:42] constantly Pride goeth Before
[1:17:44] Destruction it's in the word of God it
[1:17:46] will never
[1:17:48] fail if you don't want destruction in
[1:17:50] your life we spend every minute of every
[1:17:54] day trying to prevent destruction in our
[1:17:56] life but we'll never deal with the one
[1:17:58] Surefire way that it's
[1:18:01] coming if you you want to know the
[1:18:03] safest thing you can do for yourself to
[1:18:06] avoid heartaches bad times trials
[1:18:09] tribulation destruction the first and
[1:18:12] most simplest thing you can do for
[1:18:15] yourself is kill your own
[1:18:18] Pride I don't know what percentage it
[1:18:20] takes off but I guarant you at least has
[1:18:24] to be double digits has to
[1:18:27] be because now this scripture is set to
[1:18:29] the side there's no Pride there's no
[1:18:31] need for
[1:18:36] Destruction if there's Pride there's a
[1:18:38] need for Destruction amen you say that
[1:18:42] is so simple I know I know I say God
[1:18:46] help me why can't I get it why can't I
[1:18:49] get that like every time I turn around
[1:18:51] and run into a wall God what's happening
[1:18:54] what's going oh yeah I did think that I
[1:18:59] did I had it coming I thought it and I
[1:19:01] didn't rebuke it and I let it sit there
[1:19:03] amen let alone the things we flesh
[1:19:06] out let alone the things we actually
[1:19:09] manifest that's right and then we're
[1:19:12] dealing with years of reaping the the
[1:19:14] destruction from that Pride that's right
[1:19:17] amen every minute that you continue that
[1:19:21] argument yeah
[1:19:23] oh
[1:19:24] yeah you're going to reap
[1:19:26] it because you know better I know
[1:19:30] better why not five minutes into the
[1:19:32] argument be like this ain't going so
[1:19:34] good you know what why don't I just try
[1:19:36] to be humble and see where they're
[1:19:39] coming
[1:19:41] from you just saved yourself like 13
[1:19:44] months of trials and tribulation and you
[1:19:46] don't even know
[1:19:47] it I don't know the equations how they
[1:19:50] work out Saints but it's true
[1:19:53] that's how it works
[1:19:55] it and you know what's the Paradox about
[1:19:58] all this is once we finally get to that
[1:20:02] point and we start bypassing all of that
[1:20:05] destruction that we Heap upon oursel now
[1:20:10] I don't know why but God comes along and
[1:20:13] he says Satan have you considered them
[1:20:17] people and now we got destruction coming
[1:20:21] and we never even ask for it
[1:20:24] but God wants to show us off amen and
[1:20:27] prove to Satan that we're not like the
[1:20:29] first Eve and that the caliber of the
[1:20:32] man of job is still here on Earth right
[1:20:35] amen
[1:20:38] amen I think that it's a very valuable
[1:20:42] and honest way and prudent way when we
[1:20:47] find
[1:20:49] ourself upside
[1:20:51] down
[1:20:54] and just ran into a wall and destruction
[1:20:57] all
[1:20:58] around I find it very prudent to First
[1:21:02] approach
[1:21:04] God and say Lord is there anything that
[1:21:06] I have
[1:21:09] done I go so far to say Lord is there
[1:21:13] anything that I have done said or
[1:21:21] thought
[1:21:23] I would love to stand here and tell you
[1:21:25] that I do all of that before I ask him
[1:21:28] why I'm working on
[1:21:30] that I'm not there yet but I'm working
[1:21:33] on it and by his grace I'll get there
[1:21:35] before I even come and ask him why why
[1:21:38] me woe is me what I want to first come
[1:21:40] say Lord is there anything that I have
[1:21:42] done said or thought that has caused
[1:21:45] this around me see a lot of times we're
[1:21:47] wanting God to come and Deliver Us from
[1:21:48] something and we're the ones that put
[1:21:50] the destruction around us and we're the
[1:21:51] ones that can take the destru ruction
[1:21:53] away you say well how do you do that
[1:21:55] well you know how you do that hey ding D
[1:21:58] dinging
[1:21:59] ding hey you know what I said the other
[1:22:01] day I was wrong I'm sorry please forgive
[1:22:07] me Walls Start crumbling down years of
[1:22:11] bad seed that you just
[1:22:13] sewed gets washed away amen but why is
[1:22:17] it so hard to say Hey brother can I see
[1:22:20] you after church I I got to make
[1:22:21] something right with you
[1:22:26] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you've you have
[1:22:30] been in the message for 12 years two
[1:22:37] days he should be coming to you and
[1:22:39] being like hey I was kind of out of line
[1:22:41] the other day why why are we still
[1:22:44] dealing with such Elementary things when
[1:22:48] we have been given the most powerful
[1:22:50] word on the planet am and we still have
[1:22:54] a problem saying Hey brother I was wrong
[1:22:56] the other day I have no clue what I was
[1:22:59] thinking you know why we can't do that
[1:23:01] is because we have to make this brother
[1:23:04] feel that we were thinking something
[1:23:05] right the other day like that we've got
[1:23:07] our act together that we're at least
[1:23:09] right 75% of the time what if he thinks
[1:23:11] I'm only right 60% of the time what if
[1:23:14] he thinks I'm only squared away 50% of
[1:23:16] the time right who cares what they think
[1:23:19] amen how about we start caring what the
[1:23:22] master
[1:23:25] thinks how about we start caring about
[1:23:29] what the one who's in control of the
[1:23:30] destruction
[1:23:32] thinks and that's just
[1:23:34] naturally like we know we don't serve
[1:23:36] God out of a out of fear you know of
[1:23:38] what may come upon us we serve him out
[1:23:40] of love am but there are natural things
[1:23:43] that we can address here and there are
[1:23:45] natural things that there are many
[1:23:46] things we can avoid just by applying
[1:23:49] this simple spiritual principle
[1:23:51] amen
[1:23:54] Pride goeth Before Destruction and a
[1:23:56] hotty spirit before a fall you want to
[1:23:59] guarantee yourself to fall get a hotty
[1:24:02] spirit it's scriptural it'll never fail
[1:24:06] that's right guarantee you guarantee you
[1:24:09] if you're a child of God and you take a
[1:24:11] hotti spirit you will
[1:24:14] fall amen it's a
[1:24:21] guarantee better is it to be of a humble
[1:24:24] spirit with the
[1:24:27] lowly than to divide the spoil with the
[1:24:29] proud
[1:24:36] amen I think this applies
[1:24:40] more to things than
[1:24:43] just proud men sitting around together
[1:24:48] counting their
[1:24:49] money
[1:24:51] right
[1:24:53] better is it to be of a to be humble and
[1:24:56] of a l and with the lowly better is it
[1:24:58] to be humble and with the lowly than to
[1:25:01] sit
[1:25:02] around and divide the spoils with the
[1:25:06] proud I don't think that we're dealing
[1:25:10] with staying up and losing sleep at
[1:25:12] night because we have all of our friends
[1:25:13] over and we're you know checking
[1:25:15] everybody's bank account look here woo
[1:25:17] this is good look this is good do you
[1:25:19] see this investment I made no Saints
[1:25:23] we wouldn't do that at least I would
[1:25:24] hope
[1:25:29] not
[1:25:32] but we'll have a ministers
[1:25:35] meeting sorry I'm preaching about
[1:25:37] preachers because I'm a preacher it's
[1:25:38] the way it works just hope I don't get
[1:25:40] on whatever occupation that you
[1:25:42] are we'll set at a ministers meeting and
[1:25:45] there'll be two groups in the room this
[1:25:48] group over here nailing it down answer
[1:25:51] after answer question I got it boom
[1:25:53] answer answer
[1:25:55] answer this group over here has been
[1:25:57] like I don't know I think this but I'm
[1:25:59] not sure I've seen it both ways I'm not
[1:26:01] real sure I'm
[1:26:04] undecided which group do you want to be
[1:26:06] a part of like do you want to be the one
[1:26:08] who don't have a clue about anything and
[1:26:09] hasn't decided about anything or do you
[1:26:11] want to be the one with the
[1:26:13] answers you say well that's easy oh no
[1:26:16] Saints it's not because pride pride gets
[1:26:20] involved by the way after I preach I'm
[1:26:22] never com back to
[1:26:26] church this is humiliating it's horrible
[1:26:30] but it's the truth I'm telling you right
[1:26:32] now if I never preach again it's the
[1:26:34] truth who wants to be seen as the guy
[1:26:36] that don't have a clue when you've got
[1:26:38] the search table I mean you can set in
[1:26:40] the ministers meeting search the
[1:26:42] question and have three responses before
[1:26:43] it even gets your
[1:26:47] turn or you can be real with yourself
[1:26:51] and when it comes your turn you can be
[1:26:53] like well I've seen this I've seen this
[1:26:54] and I've seen this to be honest with you
[1:26:55] I still got to pray about it I don't
[1:26:57] know amen I don't
[1:27:00] know well that's the 14th time you've
[1:27:02] said I don't know do you know anything
[1:27:03] no I don't know
[1:27:05] anything I shouldn't even be here why
[1:27:08] did you all even let me
[1:27:16] in but why instead of that we walk into
[1:27:20] the ministers meeting like can't wait
[1:27:22] till I get asked a
[1:27:24] question I am going to blow their
[1:27:27] minds you say that doesn't happen in the
[1:27:34] message oh my my my
[1:27:38] my love not the world neither the things
[1:27:41] that are in the world if any man love
[1:27:42] the world the love of the father is not
[1:27:44] in him for th all that is in the
[1:27:46] world the lust of the flesh oh you
[1:27:50] carnal person you carnal person fleshly
[1:27:55] lust lust of the
[1:27:58] eye PR my my my always wanting something
[1:28:02] they can't
[1:28:05] have why don't we have the same
[1:28:07] repulsion to the pride of life am lust
[1:28:10] of the flesh we'll crucify that brother
[1:28:12] lust of the eye we'll chop his hand off
[1:28:14] pride of life hey you you behave
[1:28:15] yourself get on out of
[1:28:18] here if it wasn't for the third one the
[1:28:21] first two wouldn't even be problem
[1:28:23] amen why do we always want to deal with
[1:28:25] the first two but we won't deal with the
[1:28:27] third one
[1:28:32] yeah
[1:28:34] all that is in the world all is a big
[1:28:38] word but he puts it in three categories
[1:28:41] all that is in the world the lust of the
[1:28:44] flesh we got to deal with
[1:28:46] that the lust of the eyes we certainly
[1:28:49] have to deal with that the pride of Life
[1:28:53] we'll get to it whenever we have
[1:28:57] time can't be that way anymore
[1:29:00] Saints it's got to start
[1:29:03] inside
[1:29:05] quit trying to control your eyes and
[1:29:08] control the lust of your flesh when you
[1:29:11] cannot control your own Pride it'll
[1:29:14] never work you better first die to
[1:29:17] yourself you better first be real with
[1:29:20] yourself and say Lord I've got a
[1:29:23] problem and I think that I'm
[1:29:26] something and I've got to deal with that
[1:29:29] first because if you never deal with
[1:29:31] that first you are constantly going to
[1:29:33] be going the way of the eyes and the
[1:29:35] ways of the flesh because you don't
[1:29:37] realize that you are the
[1:29:39] problem you're going to be constantly
[1:29:41] blaming it on well I walked and I solved
[1:29:43] this and I walked and I got put in this
[1:29:45] situation and i' succumb to the weakness
[1:29:46] and the
[1:29:48] temp deal with the pride first
[1:29:52] deal with the fact that you are born in
[1:29:54] sin shaped in iniquity don't have your
[1:29:56] act together don't stand a chance
[1:29:58] without his anointing amen that's
[1:30:01] right don't know
[1:30:05] anything and then let that work outward
[1:30:08] and manifest itself in your flesh and in
[1:30:10] the in your
[1:30:12] eyes deal with the most repulsive first
[1:30:16] deal with the most powerful
[1:30:20] first
[1:30:23] look at the categories I'm sorry look at
[1:30:26] the company that the pride of life keeps
[1:30:29] we went through that in Proverbs there a
[1:30:31] minute ago I believe it was but look at
[1:30:35] the company that this guy
[1:30:37] keeps we already went through all the
[1:30:39] other ones but now he he keeps company
[1:30:41] with the lust of the Flesh and the lust
[1:30:43] of the
[1:30:44] eyes he does not keep good
[1:30:47] company and it is of the world and the
[1:30:50] world passeth away way and the lust
[1:30:52] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[1:30:55] God abideth
[1:31:00] forever I'm getting shorter on time so
[1:31:02] I'm going to go a little bit faster here
[1:31:04] Mark 7 and when he had called the people
[1:31:06] unto him he said unto him unto them
[1:31:08] hearken unto me every one of you and
[1:31:10] understand there is nothing from without
[1:31:12] a man that entereth into him that can
[1:31:14] defile him but the things which come out
[1:31:17] of him those are they that defile a man
[1:31:20] verse 21 for from within out of the
[1:31:24] heart of the
[1:31:26] man proceede evil thoughts
[1:31:30] adulteries
[1:31:32] fornications
[1:31:33] murders
[1:31:35] thefts
[1:31:36] covetousness wickedness deceit
[1:31:41] lasciviousness an evil eye
[1:31:45] blasphemy I mean these are not good
[1:31:47] things Saints like this is the top the
[1:31:50] top 10 most wanted
[1:31:54] yeah guess who's next on the
[1:31:57] list pride and
[1:32:01] foolishness it's not what goes into a
[1:32:05] man that defiles him Jesus said it's
[1:32:07] what comes out of him and what comes out
[1:32:10] of him are evil thoughts adulteries
[1:32:13] fornication murders theft Covetous
[1:32:16] wickedness deceit lasv an evil eye
[1:32:18] blasphemy pride comes out of him
[1:32:24] foolishness that is that which destroys
[1:32:26] a
[1:32:33] man we'll spend every waking moment of
[1:32:36] every waking day dealing with all those
[1:32:38] other things and trying to re them in
[1:32:40] and keep them under control and we won't
[1:32:42] deal with
[1:32:43] pride but yet Pride's right in there
[1:32:46] with the rest of
[1:32:49] them all these evil things this is what
[1:32:53] the scripture calls them
[1:32:57] evil I want to clarify
[1:33:01] something a bad
[1:33:03] attitude is not I'm sorry pride is not
[1:33:08] just a bad
[1:33:11] attitude
[1:33:13] Pride it's not just a bad
[1:33:17] attitude it is a
[1:33:20] devil
[1:33:24] yes it is not just a bad
[1:33:30] attitude let's identify it for what it
[1:33:32] is I'm telling you what it's not it is
[1:33:36] not just a bad attitude like it is not
[1:33:41] just you having a bad
[1:33:43] day it is
[1:33:45] not you just getting stuck in a
[1:33:48] situation it is not you just having a
[1:33:51] disagree agreement with your
[1:33:54] brother that is
[1:33:57] not what pride is pride is a
[1:34:04] devil it will come in various shapes and
[1:34:08] situations let's not belittle it and
[1:34:13] call it something other than what it is
[1:34:15] let's not make excuses for it that was
[1:34:19] just me having a bad day I was under a
[1:34:20] lot of tension and
[1:34:23] it was the devil of Pride that I now
[1:34:27] have to deal with and I'm going to deal
[1:34:29] with him because he's a
[1:34:33] devil I'm not going to explain it away
[1:34:37] I'm not going to sweep it under the
[1:34:38] carpet I'm going to deal with this devil
[1:34:43] of
[1:34:46] Pride if we don't handle him
[1:34:49] appropriately he's going to rule and
[1:34:51] reign in our
[1:34:53] lives let's handle him appropriately
[1:34:55] this is what the scripture calls
[1:34:58] him evil
[1:35:01] things evil
[1:35:04] things questions and answers brother
[1:35:06] brandom says now let's take a look back
[1:35:09] at Cain could you tell me where that
[1:35:10] spirit and that meanness come from if
[1:35:12] Cain was the son of Adam which was a Son
[1:35:14] of God where did that evil come from the
[1:35:16] first thing when he was born he hated he
[1:35:18] was a murderer he was jealous and now
[1:35:21] take the nature of his daddy the very
[1:35:23] start in the beginning Lucifer and he
[1:35:26] was in the beginning he was jealous of
[1:35:30] Michael that's what started the whole
[1:35:33] trouble
[1:35:36] right the whole trouble that we see and
[1:35:41] the things that we haven't seen for
[1:35:44] centuries remember we're 6,000 years
[1:35:47] into this just in this time allotment
[1:35:51] we're 6,000 years into that and all of
[1:35:55] that is
[1:35:57] because one person was jealous of
[1:36:02] another that's
[1:36:06] right but yet we think somehow we're
[1:36:09] going to reverse
[1:36:11] everything with pride still laying in
[1:36:13] our
[1:36:14] heart that we're going to go back to an
[1:36:17] Eden condition with the very thing that
[1:36:20] ruined even before a needing
[1:36:24] condition we better call it for what it
[1:36:27] is and we better deal with it for what
[1:36:29] it is it is a devil it is the same fruit
[1:36:33] that fell off the the tree of the
[1:36:35] knowledge of Good and Evil that ruined
[1:36:38] in the beginning and even before the
[1:36:40] beginning it was the same fruit from the
[1:36:42] tree the evil tree the tree of the
[1:36:46] knowledge of Good and Evil Pride fell
[1:36:48] off of that tree that's right
[1:36:52] and it ruined God's Church in
[1:36:57] heaven he was jealous of Michael that's
[1:37:00] what started the whole trouble jealousy
[1:37:03] Pride brother Brandon says remember that
[1:37:06] he was that he wanted to build a little
[1:37:09] better Kingdom than that of the humble
[1:37:11] kingdom kingdom of
[1:37:14] Michael interpreted that is I have a
[1:37:17] little bit better idea than
[1:37:19] you and because me naturally my idea is
[1:37:25] right that Saints is literally what
[1:37:29] started the downfall of
[1:37:31] everything is one man thinking somehow
[1:37:35] some way that he was
[1:37:38] entitled and would have of course a
[1:37:41] better idea than this
[1:37:44] man and that started the downfall of
[1:37:49] everything that's how power ful that is
[1:37:52] that's how evil that is let's not brush
[1:37:55] it away like it's something lightly
[1:37:56] let's call it for what it is it is a
[1:37:59] devil of
[1:38:04] Pride 1953 go tell my disciples the
[1:38:07] quote that you've been waiting on this
[1:38:09] whole service that I've never got
[1:38:11] to speaking of Mary brother brandom says
[1:38:16] she knew there was something about him
[1:38:18] was different from anyone anyone else
[1:38:20] speaking of
[1:38:21] Jesus she had Seven Devils cast out of
[1:38:25] her everybody that's been free from the
[1:38:28] Devil by the power of Jesus Christ knows
[1:38:30] where they're standing no one can ever
[1:38:32] come in his great divine presence and
[1:38:34] ever be the same person anymore so she
[1:38:37] had Seven Devils cast out of her pride
[1:38:42] and
[1:38:43] envy he doesn't
[1:38:45] list the other
[1:38:50] five we read that scripture and we know
[1:38:53] this lady in the Bible who had Seven
[1:38:54] Devils out of cast out of her but now a
[1:38:57] prophet comes on the scene and starts
[1:38:59] identifying what two of those Devils
[1:39:03] were and the two that he identifies are
[1:39:07] pride and envy
[1:39:10] Devils that she had cast out of her I'm
[1:39:13] sorry but if like I've read this story
[1:39:17] and heard this scripture many times and
[1:39:19] we knew she was not a good woman she was
[1:39:23] a woman of ill
[1:39:24] Fame my mind did not go to Pride and
[1:39:27] envy my mind went to much more repulsive
[1:39:30] things you know adultery fornication the
[1:39:32] list goes on and on and on brother
[1:39:35] brandom comes and identifies this two of
[1:39:37] the Seven Devils that was cast out of
[1:39:39] her were pride and
[1:39:42] envy that in itself caught my attention
[1:39:46] and started my mind
[1:39:49] blowing the next statement that he makes
[1:39:52] is what put me in Repentance for the
[1:39:53] last two
[1:39:55] months here's his definition of pride
[1:39:58] and
[1:40:00] envy she thought she was so pretty and
[1:40:03] there was no one like
[1:40:09] her she thought she was so pretty and
[1:40:12] there was no one like
[1:40:15] her the prophet identified that as a
[1:40:19] devil
[1:40:21] one of the Devils that the scripture
[1:40:23] would reference this is a famous woman
[1:40:26] in the scripture Saints she is known all
[1:40:29] around the
[1:40:32] world of having Seven Devils cast out of
[1:40:35] her but nobody's ever asked well what
[1:40:37] were the Seven Devils but a prophet
[1:40:39] comes on the scene and he would tell us
[1:40:42] one of those Devils was
[1:40:45] pride and the way that that Pride
[1:40:48] manifest the way that that devil right
[1:40:52] of Pride manifested itself catch this
[1:40:57] Saints the way that that devil of Pride
[1:41:01] manifested itself was in her mind she
[1:41:05] thought she was pretty and there was
[1:41:07] nobody like
[1:41:14] her as I said Saints this is not
[1:41:16] something I can preach you into you
[1:41:18] either get it or you don't get it
[1:41:22] you either realize
[1:41:25] yeah I've had some thoughts like that or
[1:41:29] you
[1:41:29] don't like I can't fix that I can't make
[1:41:32] it have the same effect on you that it
[1:41:33] had on me but I know one thing when I
[1:41:36] heard
[1:41:37] this and I realized that the prophet
[1:41:39] just identified one of the Devils that
[1:41:41] was cast out of this woman was pride and
[1:41:44] that Pride the devil of Pride manifested
[1:41:46] Itself by her thinking I'm kind of
[1:41:49] pretty and there's nobody like like me I
[1:41:52] realized I had a lot longer down the
[1:41:53] road to go than I
[1:41:57] realized I got a lot more Benjamin seol
[1:41:59] that needs to die than I
[1:42:04] realized and I've never even thought
[1:42:06] that I was
[1:42:11] pretty thought I was a pretty good Deer
[1:42:13] Hunter
[1:42:18] though I even thought I was a pretty
[1:42:20] good state trooper at one
[1:42:25] point and I got some ribbons to back up
[1:42:27] my
[1:42:30] argument you want know what that
[1:42:32] is that's a
[1:42:35] devil of
[1:42:37] Pride it's not Benjamin been a little
[1:42:40] cocky that is a devil of Pride that's
[1:42:44] not Benjamin been a little bit conceited
[1:42:46] that is a
[1:42:47] devil of
[1:42:49] pride
[1:42:55] I even thought I preached a couple good
[1:42:57] sermons every once in a
[1:43:01] while I seen it affect a couple people's
[1:43:03] lives one
[1:43:04] time I must be a pretty good
[1:43:08] preacher you know what that
[1:43:11] is Saints don't let it be something that
[1:43:13] it's not call it for what it
[1:43:17] is you say well there's nothing evil
[1:43:19] about that Saints we're so far beyond
[1:43:21] evil
[1:43:22] things it's it's done sa that's not the
[1:43:25] day we live
[1:43:27] in we have been called so much
[1:43:37] higher the devil of Pride manifested
[1:43:41] Itself by her
[1:43:44] thinking that there was nobody like
[1:43:47] her she was kind of pretty there was
[1:43:50] nobody like me
[1:43:52] me can we take that and put it in our
[1:43:54] own
[1:43:57] lives yes I think if we can honestly do
[1:44:01] that we'll realize real quickly we have
[1:44:03] not arrived
[1:44:06] yet and I think if we will ponder on
[1:44:09] these
[1:44:10] things and go back and search out Saints
[1:44:14] I've been opening doors in my life that
[1:44:16] have been shut for
[1:44:19] decades now that I realized that this is
[1:44:21] not just a complex this is not just
[1:44:23] seabolt DNA this is just not culture
[1:44:26] this is not just this is just the way
[1:44:27] that I am now that I've realized that's
[1:44:29] not what this is and this is a
[1:44:32] devil I've been hunting him
[1:44:34] down I have been hunting him down and
[1:44:37] I'm going to be honest with you along
[1:44:38] the way I've been absolutely repulsed at
[1:44:41] myself and I'm going to be repulsed at
[1:44:43] myself tomorrow when I find something
[1:44:44] else in the next day when I'll find
[1:44:46] something else from 12 years
[1:44:49] ago
[1:44:51] but I know one thing nothing's ever
[1:44:54] going to change if I don't go hunt him
[1:44:55] down and if I just let it be okay and I
[1:44:59] just let him lay there nothing's ever
[1:45:02] going to
[1:45:03] change but now that I know how this
[1:45:06] devil of Pride can manifest
[1:45:09] itself I'm on high alert for
[1:45:13] him and I'm hunting him down and I am
[1:45:17] changing my ways and I am changing the
[1:45:20] way that I
[1:45:22] think by his grace because I'm I
[1:45:26] recognize very very clearly that I
[1:45:29] cannot do this myself Saints I am so
[1:45:32] wrong I don't even know how wrong that I
[1:45:34] am am amen I have conducted and operated
[1:45:39] my myself for decades in a way that I
[1:45:41] thought it that I thought was okay and
[1:45:43] I've been wrong the whole time how do I
[1:45:46] stand a chance how do I stand a chance
[1:45:49] of figuring this out how how do I even
[1:45:50] know what to repent of and go make right
[1:45:52] I didn't even know it was wrong for
[1:45:59] decades how do I think that I'm going to
[1:46:01] figure out going
[1:46:02] forward it's only going to be by his
[1:46:06] grace to prick my conscience and be like
[1:46:09] hey remember what that
[1:46:11] is that's not just you disagreeing or
[1:46:14] having a better idea or you you better
[1:46:16] identify that for what it
[1:46:19] is you you better not talk to your wife
[1:46:22] that way that's not just you lining her
[1:46:26] out listen I believe in a man ruling his
[1:46:28] house you better not do it with
[1:46:33] pride you better rule your house you are
[1:46:36] held accountable for her and your
[1:46:39] children you better not rule it with
[1:46:42] pride and you better not set yourself up
[1:46:45] before your children like dad's got his
[1:46:47] act
[1:46:49] together
[1:46:54] Pride cometh before a fall you want to
[1:46:56] fall before your children set yourself
[1:46:58] up before him like dad's like dad knows
[1:47:01] what he's talking about you remember the
[1:47:03] story brother brandham said he said I'll
[1:47:04] be sitting there talking with the kids
[1:47:05] and I'll tell him hey there was three
[1:47:06] great men that came out of
[1:47:08] Kentucky and his wife said now Bill he
[1:47:12] said I would have to go off into the
[1:47:13] corner into the closet and repent of
[1:47:15] that Saints I don't think he was
[1:47:18] faking I don't think he was over there
[1:47:21] Lord I did it again
[1:47:23] sorry when he said I had to slip off and
[1:47:26] go get in the closet and repent for
[1:47:29] joking with his kids that there were
[1:47:30] three great men that came out of
[1:47:32] Kentucky we better reset the
[1:47:37] bar because it's closer than we think
[1:47:40] and it's lower than we
[1:47:42] think and we have trampled over it I
[1:47:45] have trampled over it
[1:47:48] egregiously thinking
[1:47:52] they understand me they know who I am
[1:47:58] then she thought she was so pretty and
[1:48:00] there was nobody like
[1:48:02] her but when Jesus spoke and said be
[1:48:05] thou
[1:48:06] clean all of that left her what left her
[1:48:11] pride and
[1:48:12] envy she became a new person she wasn't
[1:48:16] so pretty anymore in her own sight amen
[1:48:21] it didn't say she wasn't pretty
[1:48:23] anymore saints of God this was an
[1:48:25] ill-fed woman this is how she made her
[1:48:27] living I'm sorry but I don't think she
[1:48:29] was
[1:48:32] ugly her visual appearance did not
[1:48:35] change what changed was she was not so
[1:48:38] pretty in her own eyes anymore when he
[1:48:40] said be thou
[1:48:43] clean pride and envy
[1:48:48] left her appearance didn't change but
[1:48:51] her heart did her thinking did the pride
[1:48:54] went out and now she didn't
[1:48:56] think I'm kind of pretty and there's
[1:48:58] nobody like me I say Lord come to me and
[1:49:02] tell me to be clean speak your words
[1:49:06] over me to be
[1:49:07] clean drive this out of my life that I
[1:49:11] don't have these thoughts anymore facts
[1:49:13] of of situations may not
[1:49:18] change the r ribbons that I earned
[1:49:21] they're not going to go anywhere there's
[1:49:22] facts to back those up but what needs to
[1:49:25] change is the mindset behind them that I
[1:49:28] thought I was a pretty good interdiction
[1:49:31] officer I've got facts to back it up
[1:49:33] Saints it's not about the facts it's
[1:49:36] about what's in the
[1:49:38] heart I thought I was a pretty good Deer
[1:49:40] Hunter I've got facts to back that
[1:49:44] up that's not what need to change I
[1:49:47] don't need to go burn all the deer heads
[1:49:49] what needs to to change is up
[1:49:52] here I've got some pretty good rabbit
[1:49:54] dogs I don't need to go shoot my rabbit
[1:49:57] dogs the dogs are not the problem right

[1:50:03] than two hours the other day this is
[1:50:05] what needs to change not the dogs that's
[1:50:09] right you say that's
[1:50:12] Petty I say we better start being
[1:50:15] petty I say we better be so petty to
[1:50:18] where we wake up and look oursel in the
[1:50:19] mirror every morning and not one thought
[1:50:21] crosses our mind that I'm a pretty good
[1:50:24] Christian that's how Petty we better
[1:50:27] get that I've got my act together that
[1:50:30] I'm his bride I'm
[1:50:32] okay we better wake up every morning

[1:50:39] the most beautiful bride of Jesus Christ

[1:50:45] like you better get yourself
[1:50:47] together you better be more sincere
[1:50:50] that's right you better humble yourself
[1:50:55] right we're not going to walk out of
[1:50:57] this building and not be bride Saints
[1:50:59] we're bride and there's facts to support
[1:51:01] that and I would not want to change
[1:51:04] that but we better be the bride with the
[1:51:06] right
[1:51:08] attitude we better not be the bride
[1:51:11] that's the apple of his eye because
[1:51:14] we're kind of pretty and there's nobody
[1:51:16] else like
[1:51:17] us right right we better get beyond
[1:51:24] that I know where I'm at on time but if
[1:51:27] you'll bear with me just a little bit
[1:51:28] more I want to read this this little bit
[1:51:30] and and come to a
[1:51:33] close brother Ren says she wrapped
[1:51:35] herself in the robe of
[1:51:37] meekness and
[1:51:39] gentleness and followed the
[1:51:41] master let's get out of my mind that I'm
[1:51:44] kind of pretty and there's nobody like
[1:51:45] me and let me have him breathe his word
[1:51:47] over me to be clean amen and now let me
[1:51:51] take myself and wrap myself in meekness
[1:51:53] his meekness his humility and walk after
[1:51:57] him brother brandom says there's 2/3 of
[1:51:59] the earth that's in sin and more than
[1:52:01] that which two-thirds of the Angels were
[1:52:02] kicked out and those demon Spirits came
[1:52:04] into people and habitate their body see
[1:52:06] what I mean they're demons catch the the
[1:52:10] the words that he's using here they
[1:52:12] demons that once existed and they came
[1:52:14] into the people and gave them a nature
[1:52:17] Jesus cast seven out of uh seven of them
[1:52:19] seven of them what demons out of Mary

[1:52:27] Pride
[1:52:29] boast big people you see she thought she
[1:52:32] was
[1:52:33] something unclean now he starts getting
[1:52:36] into the ones that I would think of
[1:52:38] unclean filthy vulgarity listen to this
[1:52:41] one
[1:52:46] emulations emulations you know what
[1:52:48] emulation is it's competition

[1:53:09] it it's not acceptable
[1:53:11] anymore the word has exposed it it's not
[1:53:14] acceptable to me
[1:53:18] anymore competition is what that
[1:53:21] is emulation
[1:53:26] competition the church
[1:53:29] volleyball
[1:53:30] setting it was over the line it wasn't
[1:53:33] over the line competition we'll stand
[1:53:35] there and argue about it for five
[1:53:37] minutes I won't CU I don't play
[1:53:40] volleyball but you all will that like to
[1:53:42] play volleyball I know you all won't

[1:53:48] if you would in a moment of weakness
[1:53:51] that's
[1:53:53] emulations I've been to church camps and
[1:53:56] literally seen Brothers get mad at each
[1:53:58] other whether a ball was in or out and
[1:54:02] I'm like who cares come over here so I
[1:54:05] can tell you what a good Deer Hunter I
[1:54:12] am that's the
[1:54:15] truth that's the real demon the real
[1:54:18] demon is not the brothers over here
[1:54:20] arguing about whether the ball was in
[1:54:22] the real demon is the guy over here who
[1:54:24] wants him to shut up so he can tell them
[1:54:26] what a good Deer Hunter he
[1:54:35] is sure is nice
[1:54:37] to point at the other two brothers
[1:54:40] though and be like look how ridiculous
[1:54:41] they're acting don't they know that's
[1:54:43] emulations don't they know that's a
[1:54:46] demon you ought have seen this deer I

[1:55:09] bad but I'm not going to lie anymore and
[1:55:12] say the thought's not
[1:55:13] there and even if I have the thought I
[1:55:15] still need to deal with the
[1:55:17] thought and I need to quit roing about
[1:55:19] these guys every here making fools out
[1:55:21] of themselves fighting over whether the
[1:55:22] ball was in or out and I need to deal
[1:55:23] with the demon yeah the devil amen
[1:55:27] that's causing pride in my own
[1:55:30] heart really the only reason that I'm
[1:55:32] upset about them making fools of
[1:55:34] themselves is because they never picked
[1:55:35] me to play anyhow cuz they know that I
[1:55:36] wouldn't stand that wouldn't be any
[1:55:39] good you put yourself in that put
[1:55:42] yourself in that setting you say well

[1:56:17] pies I have facts to support that too I
[1:56:21] won't give you my Witnesses
[1:56:25] though we're all there at that camp
[1:56:28] we're all there in that Circle we're all
[1:56:31] there under the tree of the knowledge of
[1:56:34] Good and Evil with pride hanging all
[1:56:36] around us and it's so easy to find it
[1:56:39] here and here and
[1:56:46] here and you let one of them older men
[1:56:49] make an inappropriate comment to one of
[1:56:50] them younger
[1:56:52] sisters and you'll be going out of
[1:56:54] here maybe alive maybe
[1:56:59] not uncleanness at the church camp will
[1:57:03] not be tolerated we will deal with that
[1:57:06] before it
[1:57:08] happens but the demon of Pride and the
[1:57:10] devil of Pride will run all around the
[1:57:12] CR ground screaming and hollering and
[1:57:15] tooting his horn and we'll be like
[1:57:17] what's that what's wrong what's going on
[1:57:20] oh just leave him alone
[1:57:23] he it's a
[1:57:25] demon it's a devil and it's in the same
[1:57:29] category as that
[1:57:31] pervert that would want to do something
[1:57:33] of that to a young
[1:57:35] sister we may not understand that but
[1:57:38] there's too much scriptural proof and
[1:57:40] I've read them to you right it's in the
[1:57:43] same
[1:57:44] category it needs to be dealt with the
[1:57:47] same
[1:57:48] way
[1:57:51] brother
[1:57:55] Brandon said speaking of Joseph Joseph
[1:57:58] type
[1:57:59] Perfection brother brand says Joseph
[1:58:02] problem this is not verbatim you you go
[1:58:04] find the quote he said Joseph's problem
[1:58:06] was Joseph thought he was a pretty good
[1:58:13] boy you say well he was that wasn't the
[1:58:17] problem the problem was Joseph thought
[1:58:21] that he was a pretty good boy I'm not
[1:58:23] speaking of his son I'm speaking of the
[1:58:24] Bible character the one in Egypt right
[1:58:27] that was next to pharaoh who has facts
[1:58:30] to support that he was a pretty good boy
[1:58:32] like my brothers beat me half to death
[1:58:34] sold me into slavery I got thrown into
[1:58:36] prison for an false accusation and now
[1:58:38] I'm here seated beside the throne I must
[1:58:40] be a pretty good boy that wasn't the
[1:58:42] problem the the facts were not the
[1:58:45] problem the problem was he thought he
[1:58:48] was a pretty good boy yeah and he goes
[1:58:50] through all of that so that he can
[1:58:53] finally get to an understanding of
[1:58:58] what then he knows how to manage grain
[1:59:01] real well no he goes through all of that
[1:59:04] to get to a proper understanding I'm not
[1:59:07] okay and I have issues that I need to
[1:59:09] deal with I am not a pretty good
[1:59:14] boy he got to the point Saints the
[1:59:18] brother random says you've heard me
[1:59:20] quote this before that when trials and
[1:59:22] tribulation would come his way he would
[1:59:25] respond with Lord what part of your forn
[1:59:28] knowledge am I manifesting out
[1:59:31] now I was talking about this with our
[1:59:34] pastor the other day and he gave me some
[1:59:35] great insight and he actually gave me
[1:59:39] hope for myself but he said that's true
[1:59:42] and I believe that but if Joseph was a
[1:59:46] man like us he probably didn't do that
[1:59:48] the first time
[1:59:51] I just thought well if that's what
[1:59:53] brother brandham said well that's the
[1:59:54] way it's always been but let's think
[1:59:57] about it realistically like when he's
[1:59:59] getting beat and thrown in the
[2:00:02] pit and sold off into sve
[2:00:05] slavery like that might not have been at
[2:00:08] the point in time that he was saying
[2:00:10] Lord what part of your for knowledge am
[2:00:11] I manifesting right now it may have been
[2:00:14] a few years down the road to where he
[2:00:17] finally came to a realization so
[2:00:19] something greater is working here I need
[2:00:21] to grow up I need to deal with myself
[2:00:24] I'm not a pretty good boy
[2:00:26] anymore right these things are going on
[2:00:29] in my life but I see his hand over me
[2:00:31] all of the time I know where I would
[2:00:34] have fell but he kept me I know where I
[2:00:36] would have went astray but he kept me my
[2:00:38] life is a wreck right
[2:00:41] now I don't want to respond
[2:00:45] inappropriately Lord what part of your
[2:00:48] for knowledge in I manifesting out today
[2:00:51] that's where I want to get to Saints not
[2:00:54] why me Lord woe is me what are you doing
[2:00:57] this surely can't be
[2:00:59] fair I want those responses are from
[2:01:03] Pride those responses are from Benjamin
[2:01:05] thinking he's a pretty good boy that
[2:01:07] he's a pretty good Christian that he's a
[2:01:09] pretty good message believer that's how
[2:01:13] he
[2:01:16] responds I'm done with that by his grace
[2:01:20] I'm done with that now I want to
[2:01:23] respond I done said or thought anything
[2:01:26] that would Grieve Your Spirit out of my
[2:01:27] life that would allow this to come on
[2:01:30] me or is this simply you manifesting
[2:01:33] some part of your forn knowledge through
[2:01:37] me that's how I want to respond in
[2:01:43] humility I'm going to go through these
[2:01:45] last few examples very quickly and then
[2:01:47] we're going to close close it's almost
[2:01:48] 9:30
[2:01:49] 30 I thank God that we had a prophet
[2:01:52] that was
[2:01:54] real that we had a prophet that would
[2:01:57] stand and make even more of a fool out
[2:01:59] of himself than I've made out of myself
[2:02:01] tonight that would be so raw and expose
[2:02:04] himself before the public
[2:02:06] right he says and so they called me back
[2:02:09] out this was during the time of the
[2:02:10] flood and I always lived on the river
[2:02:12] and quite a
[2:02:17] Boatman you all have already caught up I
[2:02:19] don't even know to
[2:02:20] go you all know where he ended up at the
[2:02:24] Falls with a boat that won't start
[2:02:26] praying and screaming and hollering
[2:02:27] before God save me save me I'm quite a
[2:02:31] Boatman but say no he wasn't say nothing
[2:02:34] about being quite a Boatman then
[2:02:37] Saints you want to set yourself up to go
[2:02:40] over the falls of
[2:02:42] Life get in your head you don't even
[2:02:44] have to verbalize it just get in your
[2:02:46] head that you're quite a Boatman on this
[2:02:47] sea of life yeah let me know how that
[2:02:50] works out for
[2:02:52] you your engine's going to
[2:02:56] stop brother R said so I went out the
[2:02:59] next day and I took my little old rifle
[2:03:00] and walked down this way well I thought
[2:03:02] I was just too good of a Woodsman to
[2:03:04] ever get lost I'd been in the woods all
[2:03:07] my life he said now you couldn't turn me
[2:03:12] around I told you I could go really fast
[2:03:15] because you all got the principal we
[2:03:16] know the end of this story
[2:03:19] right Lord where's where's the wire at
[2:03:21] where's the wire at I'm lost I can't do
[2:03:24] nothing SS he was not joking that was
[2:03:27] life or
[2:03:28] death but he
[2:03:30] is he this is the seventh angel in the
[2:03:34] Book of Revelation amen who's now taking
[2:03:37] upon himself the nature of Christ to
[2:03:39] make of himself no reputation just to
[2:03:42] tell a story how it really happened why
[2:03:46] I'm really up here on this mountain with
[2:03:49] my hand up in the air hoping to hit a
[2:03:51] wire so my family don't die down at the
[2:03:53] bottom of the mountain why I'm really in
[2:03:55] this
[2:03:57] position cuz I took a demon of pride in
[2:04:00] my life and I thought I was a pretty
[2:04:03] good
[2:04:07] Woodsman and the facts said that he
[2:04:11] was and the facts did not
[2:04:15] change what
[2:04:17] changed before he came off of that
[2:04:20] mountain is he no longer longer thought
[2:04:22] that he was a pretty good Woodsman
[2:04:27] yeah said I thought I was just too good
[2:04:30] I couldn't get lost you see God had to
[2:04:31] learn me some
[2:04:33] sense so put some brains in my head to
[2:04:36] let me know that I wasn't
[2:04:38] self-sufficient that's right that's his
[2:04:41] interpretation of that event God I
[2:04:45] wasn't as good as I thought I was
[2:04:50] that's the seventh angel for
[2:04:53] you I say we should follow the
[2:04:55] example he said here you're too good of
[2:04:58] a wisman you you ain't lost what's the
[2:05:00] matter with you and I sat down on a rock
[2:05:02] I thought now you think you're lost
[2:05:04] don't you but you're not and I sat down
[2:05:06] on a rock again say now you're not lost
[2:05:09] you know where you're at why stand still
[2:05:10] you know where you're at but all the
[2:05:12] hunting and Wood's ability I had was
[2:05:15] gone I'm telling you I was actually
[2:05:18] completely
[2:05:24] lost says I was moving I thought oh God
[2:05:28] I'm lost I'm lost Lord I have no Compass
[2:05:31] I've nothing this is me the last two
[2:05:34] months once the seal came off of this
[2:05:36] Revelation this is me I'm lost I am lost
[2:05:40] I am nothing and I don't even have a
[2:05:43] compass to get myself out of this
[2:05:44] situation I don't even have the the
[2:05:47] well-being and the the ability to get
[2:05:49] myself out of this condition don't leave
[2:05:52] it on the mountain Saints bring it right
[2:05:55] here he
[2:05:58] says I have nothing but I said I still
[2:06:01] have you Lord and I kept talking out
[2:06:03] loud I thought wait a minute now you're
[2:06:05] going to get out of hand you're going to
[2:06:07] get frantic you're thinking about your
[2:06:08] wife dying tonight and that baby I said
[2:06:11] you better think about that you better
[2:06:13] think about dying and losing everything
[2:06:15] that you
[2:06:16] have don't leave it in this story Saints
[2:06:20] we better think about dying and losing
[2:06:22] everything that we
[2:06:23] have he's saying I'm making this prayer
[2:06:26] before God that I'm lost I'm lost I need
[2:06:28] help I don't even have and at the same
[2:06:31] time I'm having a thought you better get
[2:06:33] yourself together you're going to get
[2:06:34] franic you're going to get panicked
[2:06:36] you're going to lose your wife and your
[2:06:37] baby you better get yourself
[2:06:39] together is this not what we go through
[2:06:42] on a daily basis approach God and try to
[2:06:45] die to self see if this if this Same
[2:06:47] Spirit don't come come along right you
[2:06:49] better get yourself together you're
[2:06:52] overreacting you don't really need to do
[2:06:54] that you're
[2:06:55] okay
[2:06:57] true Spirits don't die
[2:07:00] Am Lord I'm not worthy to live but don't
[2:07:03] let them die okay now we're going
[2:07:07] somewhere who does this sound
[2:07:09] like this sounds like a man who made of
[2:07:12] himself no reputation Lord I'm not
[2:07:14] worthy to live but don't let them die
[2:07:17] here it is almost dark I'm lost father
[2:07:19] totally lost now we're getting somewhere
[2:07:22] totally Lo I'm not just lost I'm totally
[2:07:25] lost and I don't even know how to fix it
[2:07:28] God Amen won't you help
[2:07:32] me I say God wants you help
[2:07:36] me and I felt somebody on my shoulder I
[2:07:39] say praise
[2:07:41] God I felt them on my shoulder before
[2:07:43] Saints but I've got to fill them again
[2:07:47] amen I felt him on my shoulder before
[2:07:50] but I needed again I turned to look who
[2:07:54] it was and just then the fog cleared
[2:07:55] away and I followed through the bushes I
[2:07:58] seen I was going straight into Canada
[2:08:00] the way I was going with my knowledge
[2:08:04] and here was Hurricane Mountain right up
[2:08:06] here it was on the other side see I was
[2:08:09] passing right by it and everything that
[2:08:12] he could think to do in all his Woodmans
[2:08:15] ship in all his ability in all his
[2:08:17] thinking I'm a Prett good Woodsman and I
[2:08:19] can't get turned around and I can't get
[2:08:22] lost he finds himself even after prayer
[2:08:27] going the exact opposite way he should
[2:08:29] be
[2:08:33] going you say well then what chance is
[2:08:35] there there's still a hand
[2:08:38] Saints there's still a hand and there's
[2:08:42] still the master of the
[2:08:47] Wind brother random got to a point and
[2:08:50] he was preaching one time I think it was
[2:08:51] in the seals but I could be mistaken and
[2:08:53] he's going along boom boom boom tying
[2:08:55] stuff together and he says I was talking
[2:08:57] to this guy the other day and if ID have
[2:08:59] just had two two if I had two minutes I
[2:09:00] could have tied him up in knots into
[2:09:02] scriptures
[2:09:03] and hang on just a second hang on what's
[2:09:06] wrong
[2:09:08] oh he didn't like that I'm
[2:09:12] sorry you think that lesson on the
[2:09:14] mountain didn't come to fruition sir you
[2:09:17] think it didn't have some fruit you
[2:09:18] didn't think it changed his life that
[2:09:21] quick make a statement oh wait stop he
[2:09:24] didn't like
[2:09:27] something I find it astonishing the
[2:09:30] first thing that he comes to is oh maybe
[2:09:33] it was something I
[2:09:35] saidise not what's wrong with you all
[2:09:38] out there right is somebody resisting
[2:09:41] the
[2:09:42] message oh something I
[2:09:46] said right amen
[2:09:51] brother Randa said told a story one time
[2:09:53] I felt one time that God owed me an
[2:09:59] explanation remember how that worked out
[2:10:01] for
[2:10:03] him Saints I thank God for an honest
[2:10:07] Prophet I know we say that but it is
[2:10:09] astonishing what would we do if he would
[2:10:11] try to cover up 50% of the experiences
[2:10:14] that he had if he would not be honest
[2:10:16] and tell us what
[2:10:18] uh what came before these situations we
[2:10:21] would lose the
[2:10:23] lesson but because he was willing to
[2:10:26] make himself of no reputation I'm not
[2:10:28] saying he did it on day number one but
[2:10:30] by the end of the time when he left the
[2:10:32] face of this this Earth he would and
[2:10:33] I'll prove it to you here in a second he
[2:10:35] would make himself of no reputation so
[2:10:37] that we would get
[2:10:39] it am that is astonishing nobody's had a
[2:10:43] messenger like this before Luther
[2:10:46] couldn't do this Wesley couldn't do this
[2:10:48] this Pentecostalism can't do this Saints
[2:10:52] this is
[2:10:53] genuine sir said I felt God would me an
[2:10:57] explanation we know that didn't work out
[2:10:59] too good for him brother brand says
[2:11:02] that's the problem with mankind God will
[2:11:04] bless a man a little bit and then he
[2:11:06] gets all puffed up every
[2:11:10] time God will give him a little bit of
[2:11:12] gift he says and he gets all puffed up
[2:11:14] that's the problem with
[2:11:17] humans
[2:11:18] brother brandom says if you want to get
[2:11:21] somewhere with God never let an arrogant
[2:11:24] Spirit ever come around
[2:11:26] you prideful arrogant Pride if you want
[2:11:30] to get anywhere with God don't ever let
[2:11:32] that come around
[2:11:34] you brother Chad was preaching on John a
[2:11:39] couple Services ago and how that he
[2:11:41] represented the bride and how that there
[2:11:42] was so much more information and details
[2:11:45] in the Book of John and as he was
[2:11:47] preaching that I was already dealing
[2:11:49] with this thought but it struck
[2:11:52] me John outran Peter to the
[2:11:57] Grave John outran Peter to Jesus Christ
[2:12:01] where he was he outran
[2:12:03] him but John having the appropriate
[2:12:08] Spirit of the Bride on him yes never
[2:12:11] boasts about being quicker right it was
[2:12:15] factual he put it in there it was
[2:12:17] factual the other the he said the other
[2:12:19] disciple
[2:12:21] outr
[2:12:23] humility he never talks about how fast
[2:12:27] that he ran or how much faster than
[2:12:29] Peter he was and how he got the
[2:12:32] Revelation you see where I'm going he
[2:12:33] got it
[2:12:34] first why is it that we always have to
[2:12:36] be the first one to get the Revelation
[2:12:38] why can't we just say brother I have
[2:12:40] I've been in the message for 30 years
[2:12:41] and I have never seen that where did you
[2:12:44] get that from no it's oh yeah it's
[2:12:46] interesting yeah I was looking at that
[2:12:48] that a couple weeks ago and I had no you
[2:12:51] didn't you never heard that before just
[2:12:53] say you've never heard it
[2:12:56] before I read something kind of like
[2:12:59] that the other no you did
[2:13:00] not quit giving grounds to that
[2:13:05] demon call it for what it is I've been
[2:13:08] in the message for 39 years and I've
[2:13:11] never seen that before where did you get
[2:13:14] that that is
[2:13:16] amazing John never said anything about
[2:13:18] out never BR bragged about outrunning
[2:13:21] him but even so much more that when he
[2:13:25] got to that
[2:13:28] Revelation he looks in he verifies it in
[2:13:31] the word and he says going in First
[2:13:35] Peter amen and you preach
[2:13:42] it
[2:13:44] amen that's the
[2:13:46] bride amen will scream and holler
[2:13:48] anytime somebody says John represents
[2:13:50] the bride let's do it about
[2:13:52] that I I don't need to tell myself
[2:13:56] first the scripture says he believed
[2:14:00] that's right he was the one that
[2:14:01] believed
[2:14:04] before I don't need to preach it
[2:14:07] first let let those people think that
[2:14:10] brother saw it
[2:14:13] first why can't we deal with the demon
[2:14:15] of Pride and do that yeah
[2:14:18] we won't think for a second that it
[2:14:21] would be kosher to walk around and tell
[2:14:23] people how strong we are how
[2:14:24] good-looking we are how much money we
[2:14:26] got blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[2:14:28] but you let somebody think that somebody
[2:14:30] else got a revelation before we got
[2:14:35] it I got to go back how can I word my
[2:14:39] conversation to be like you remember
[2:14:41] three weeks ago when we were talking oh
[2:14:43] you don't remember that yeah I said that
[2:14:46] about
[2:14:49] we better get real with ourselves that's
[2:14:51] right that's a demon a devil of Pride
[2:14:56] that would cause that that's right
[2:14:59] Amen brother brandom demonstrated this
[2:15:02] in his life remember throwing darts the
[2:15:06] testimony yes never win a game of darts
[2:15:09] darts but when they're not playing a
[2:15:10] game he can sit there and throw a bulls
[2:15:11] eye every
[2:15:13] time that's how much he killed pride in
[2:15:16] his life yeah if there's any joy to be
[2:15:19] had in winning let my brother have
[2:15:22] it let's start dealing with him the way
[2:15:25] that the prophet taught us to deal with
[2:15:27] him brother brandom's pig hunting
[2:15:30] there's a pig contest he kills the
[2:15:32] biggest
[2:15:34] pig shows up there's an old man there
[2:15:37] who's in first place until brother
[2:15:39] brandom shows up remember what meant
[2:15:43] something to brother Brandon that's
[2:15:45] right right this is not him showing up
[2:15:49] to a mechanic show with the best built
[2:15:52] car this is a hunting
[2:15:55] contest this is
[2:15:58] real this is
[2:16:03] important this is life or death whether
[2:16:06] you believe it or
[2:16:11] not I redo this in my mind now that I've
[2:16:16] read this quote about Mary and I'm
[2:16:17] repulsed of how I would have handled
[2:16:19] this situation actually I'm not if it
[2:16:21] would have been a pig contest I would
[2:16:22] have cared
[2:16:24] less if this was a big buck
[2:16:28] contest and I show up with the biggest
[2:16:31] one right before closing time and
[2:16:33] there's an old man there who's in first
[2:16:36] place and he's going to win a
[2:16:43] rifle I would have gave him the rifle
[2:16:45] after I won it and I would have felt
[2:16:47] good about my
[2:16:50] myself that's the
[2:16:52] truth and that would be wrong and that
[2:16:55] would be a demon of Pride working in my
[2:16:59] life why can't I show up and I've got
[2:17:02] one that's 10 inches bigger than his and
[2:17:04] be
[2:17:05] like close the tailgate don't need to
[2:17:08] show anybody
[2:17:12] anything why am I even in a big buck
[2:17:15] contest to begin with let's start
[2:17:17] dealing with
[2:17:19] that unless there's free stuff involved
[2:17:21] if there's free stuff involved then it's
[2:17:23] fair
[2:17:24] game I'm saying do I would I really need
[2:17:28] to be in a big buck contest what's that
[2:17:31] serving this guy right
[2:17:37] here he gave us live
[2:17:41] examples but I'm going to go one step
[2:17:43] further because I think through a little
[2:17:45] bit of prayer and maybe some fasting I
[2:17:48] can get to this point but now you have
[2:17:51] the seventh vile Angel who I can show
[2:17:53] you in the scripture where my position
[2:17:56] is
[2:17:57] at I'm sorry Saints but brother brandom
[2:17:59] can't be with us here this evening he
[2:18:01] had an emergency in his family and he
[2:18:02] had to
[2:18:06] go yeah I'm
[2:18:10] here oh he just lied about me so that he
[2:18:15] could get people here
[2:18:18] right I'm not here I'm not here all
[2:18:21] right I'm not here all
[2:18:27] right I would have walked on the
[2:18:29] platform I would have waved and I would
[2:18:31] have left and I would have been feeling
[2:18:34] good about myself because I didn't
[2:18:35] chastise that man in front of everybody
[2:18:37] that all I did was I walked on there and
[2:18:39] waved to let them know that he was lying
[2:18:43] that's right God I say I'm coming up
[2:18:46] short saint
[2:18:49] I'm coming up short but I'm done not
[2:18:52] hunting him down and I'm done not
[2:18:54] calling him for what he
[2:18:56] is I'm going to say if I can't just keep
[2:19:00] my mouth shut and walk out of that
[2:19:03] building and let him have whatever
[2:19:06] positive influence he can have on the
[2:19:08] people if I can't do that he's not the
[2:19:13] problem I'm the
[2:19:16] problem saints of God it's going to go
[2:19:18] against everything that is in our flesh
[2:19:21] it is going to go against everything
[2:19:23] that is in our hybrid Spirit it is a
[2:19:26] total another
[2:19:28] level but so is the creative spoken word
[2:19:31] being on your
[2:19:32] tongue and if you want one you better
[2:19:34] get the other one first there is no
[2:19:37] power of the spoken word coming onto a
[2:19:39] tongue that has pride in
[2:19:41] it it's too great of power there's too
[2:19:43] much damage can be done it is not going
[2:19:45] to happen amen
[2:19:48] and even more so the creative word of
[2:19:50] God to come into my life to literally
[2:19:53] manifest Jesus Christ on this
[2:19:56] Earth and to physically change my atoms
[2:20:00] that is not going to happen with
[2:20:04] pride brother random says if you have
[2:20:06] one ought in your heart against any
[2:20:11] person sinner or
[2:20:15] Saint we can go along with 50% of that
[2:20:17] that he says ought against sinner or
[2:20:22] Saint you're in danger of
[2:20:26] Hellfire not just of not being bride not
[2:20:29] just of being backslid you have one
[2:20:32] ought in your heart against a sinner or
[2:20:37] a saint that ought is there because of
[2:20:40] Pride sir and his defin his
[2:20:45] interpretation of that is is you're in
[2:20:47] danger of
[2:20:49] Hellfire that's how serious it is you
[2:20:53] remember aik in the
[2:20:54] scripture aimc would have a man come to
[2:20:57] him while he's done nothing wrong and
[2:21:00] the other man has done everything right
[2:21:03] I'm sorry the other man has done
[2:21:04] everything wrong aimc has done nothing
[2:21:08] wrong and God would come to him and
[2:21:12] say you're as good as a dead
[2:21:16] man I've done nothing wrong
[2:21:19] Lord but aimc I've not studied this out
[2:21:23] and done the history on it but and I
[2:21:25] know he wasn't Abraham but I'm not about
[2:21:28] to call him an
[2:21:29] unbeliever like I I don't know all the
[2:21:31] circumstances I'm just saying you don't
[2:21:33] get that
[2:21:35] character and that response being a rank
[2:21:39] Heathen unbeliever and not caring about
[2:21:41] or fearing
[2:21:44] God we have to understand that just
[2:21:47] because somebody's not recorded in the
[2:21:50] Bible like Abraham was doesn't mean that
[2:21:52] God wasn't doing some stuff in A's
[2:21:57] life he may have been doing the exact
[2:22:00] same thing in aim's life that he was in
[2:22:02] Abrahams it's just Abraham was
[2:22:04] predestinated for this specific thing
[2:22:06] and to be recorded in the scripture yeah
[2:22:09] amen let's not look negative towards him
[2:22:14] this was a man that could this was a man
[2:22:16] that could stand before God and say you
[2:22:18] know the Integrity of my
[2:22:23] heart right I claim to be the Bride of
[2:22:27] Jesus Christ the Spotless virtuous
[2:22:30] sinless bride of Jesus Christ and I'm
[2:22:32] telling you I still wouldn't say that
[2:22:34] without a
[2:22:36] stutter and here's a man that would
[2:22:39] stand before the message of the hour
[2:22:41] that would stand and say Lord you know
[2:22:43] the Integrity of my heart in other words
[2:22:45] you judge me yeah right I'm an open book
[2:22:49] you judge me
[2:22:52] yeah why could he do that cuz aimc knew
[2:22:56] he didn't have any pride in there yeah
[2:22:58] and he proved there wasn't any pride in
[2:23:00] there because God says this is what's
[2:23:03] wrong you go do this and he lickly split
[2:23:05] went and did
[2:23:07] it he didn't say well I no he said if
[2:23:11] that's the way it is and that's the way
[2:23:13] you say I've got to handle it it's done
[2:23:16] yeah
[2:23:17] why no
[2:23:19] Pride I'm telling you Saints me being
[2:23:22] aimc um God told me to do this yes God
[2:23:25] speaks to me as
[2:23:29] well you believe this if you want to but
[2:23:32] I didn't even mean to say that but
[2:23:33] that's the truth
[2:23:35] yeah that's the truth that's the raw
[2:23:37] honest truth yes Abraham God speaks to
[2:23:40] me as
[2:23:42] well I hope it's getting real
[2:23:45] saints it's way late on a Wednesday
[2:23:48] night for it not to be
[2:23:50] real I hope it's getting
[2:23:52] real do we see ourselves yes sir yes
[2:23:56] Abraham God speaks to me as well and
[2:23:58] he's told me that you've deceived me but
[2:24:00] Abraham because God knows the Integrity
[2:24:02] of me my heart this is how I'm going to
[2:24:05] handle things because this is how God
[2:24:06] what God told me to
[2:24:08] do I don't read that in the scripture I
[2:24:12] read God coming to this man and saying
[2:24:14] there's a problem he says Lord you know
[2:24:15] the Integrity of me heart just tell me
[2:24:17] what to do this is what's wrong this is
[2:24:18] what you need to do yes Lord and oh by
[2:24:21] the way have that guy that's a liar pray
[2:24:23] for you yes
[2:24:32] Lord who being made in the image of
[2:24:35] God took upon himself no
[2:24:40] reputation no
[2:24:44] reputation in the beginning what God
[2:24:47] Eve's got Eve in trouble was her
[2:24:49] Pride Eve looked at the tree and
[2:24:53] couldn't see anything wrong with it and
[2:24:55] because Eve looked at the tree and she
[2:24:59] couldn't see anything wrong with it then
[2:25:01] surely there's not a
[2:25:03] problem because if there was a problem I
[2:25:06] mean I would I'm the wife of
[2:25:09] Adam I would see the see the problem
[2:25:15] like yeah the Slick talk tongue
[2:25:20] serpent wasn't what deceived
[2:25:23] Eve what deceived Eve was
[2:25:27] Eve she thought because I can look at
[2:25:31] the tree and I don't see anything wrong
[2:25:33] with it surely I can't be
[2:25:40] wrong brother random says we were put
[2:25:43] here to do what Pro prove to Satan that
[2:25:48] we're not like the first Eve you say
[2:25:51] well I would never touch those
[2:25:52] denominations I would not fornicate the
[2:25:54] word I
[2:25:59] would but yet we'll stick our head in a
[2:26:01] dirty television and thinking that we
[2:26:02] won't have the effects on it that
[2:26:03] brother Brandon said it would have on us
[2:26:05] we'll stick our nose in Hollywood and
[2:26:07] think that it won't have the effect
[2:26:08] because we can't see anything wrong with
[2:26:09] it surely it's not what brother brand
[2:26:11] was talking
[2:26:15] about
[2:26:21] if he said it's wrong it's wrong yes
[2:26:24] doesn't matter whether you agree with it
[2:26:26] or not doesn't matter whether you can
[2:26:28] see what's wrong with it or not if he
[2:26:30] said keep your head out of it he said
[2:26:31] keep your head out of
[2:26:33] it if he said keep your head out of it
[2:26:36] take it as grace and mercy from God to
[2:26:38] keep you from something that you don't
[2:26:40] even understand you want to know why
[2:26:42] there's mental illness on this planet
[2:26:44] television amen you want to know why
[2:26:47] people are calling me every day wanting
[2:26:49] me to get the hidden men out of their
[2:26:50] house and the bugs out of their house
[2:26:52] and the listening devices and the
[2:26:53] cameras that are hidden in their house
[2:26:56] Television right you want to know why
[2:26:58] it's
[2:26:59] exploding social media y the human brain
[2:27:04] cannot sit in front of something and
[2:27:05] process images at the rate that people
[2:27:07] are putting them in their brain their
[2:27:09] brains are
[2:27:14] frying their brains are frying yeah in
[2:27:19] so much that brother random says when
[2:27:21] that when the plagues come on the earth
[2:27:25] those are not natural things that's in
[2:27:28] their imaginary mind they are not real
[2:27:31] he says the things that they are seeing
[2:27:33] they are not real it's in their
[2:27:36] imagination but you try to convince them
[2:27:39] they're not real can't do it
[2:27:42] right it is real to them why is because
[2:27:46] they looked at the tree they heard the
[2:27:49] voice and they say well I don't think he
[2:27:51] really meant exactly what he
[2:27:58] said we do the same
[2:28:01] thing and we will get the same results
[2:28:04] if you think you won't get the same
[2:28:07] results as the world it's your pride
[2:28:10] telling you that amen right true amen go
[2:28:13] against the words of the prophet and
[2:28:15] think that you won't reap the same thing
[2:28:18] in your natural body that the world
[2:28:19] reaps that is your pride telling you
[2:28:22] that and I'm here to tell you you're
[2:28:24] wrong stick your head in that television
[2:28:27] stick your nose in Hollywood stick your
[2:28:29] nose in that social media fry your brain
[2:28:32] with your cell phone and all those
[2:28:33] images over and over and over and day
[2:28:35] after day 500 images in 60 seconds your
[2:28:38] brain cannot handle that it cannot
[2:28:40] upload that it cannot process
[2:28:43] that you will fry yourself amen
[2:28:47] true and you'll still have the Holy
[2:28:50] Ghost got a quote for it brother Brandon
[2:28:52] says you can lose your mind and still
[2:28:54] have the Holy
[2:28:56] Ghost don't think just because you're
[2:28:59] still the Bride of Jesus Christ that you
[2:29:00] cannot ruin your natural body by going
[2:29:02] against what the prophet told us not to
[2:29:04] do some of the warnings that he gave us
[2:29:07] absolutely were spiritually minded some
[2:29:09] of the things were absolutely natural
[2:29:12] some of them were both amen true amen
[2:29:15] don't be like the first Eve and just
[2:29:19] because you can't see why the prophet
[2:29:21] was saying this I'll go ahead and do it
[2:29:25] if brother brandom says don't mix
[2:29:26] marriages don't mix marriages you don't
[2:29:29] have to understand
[2:29:31] it do it and see what
[2:29:34] happens you might be dead and gone
[2:29:37] before it manifests itself but that's
[2:29:39] what brother random says lot did he says
[2:29:41] lot did not consider his children when
[2:29:44] he went to
[2:29:45] Sodom mix your
[2:29:48] marriage marry an unbeliever which
[2:29:50] brother brandom emphatically said never
[2:29:52] to do amen marry an unbeliever see if it
[2:29:56] don't have destruction coming down your
[2:29:59] path
[2:30:01] amen you may be dead and gone when it
[2:30:03] arrives but I assure you it's coming you
[2:30:06] cannot go against the word of God and
[2:30:08] not have it
[2:30:09] happen just because you can't see why he
[2:30:13] gave the warning yeah or why he said it
[2:30:17] don't worry about it just do it or don't
[2:30:20] do it based on what he
[2:30:29] said don't give your all to
[2:30:33] Christ and see if you come out better
[2:30:36] than the
[2:30:42] world don't give your
[2:30:45] all
[2:30:47] and see if you come out better than the
[2:30:48] world the only reason that we are in a
[2:30:51] better position than the world as Saints
[2:30:53] is because we have given ourself to
[2:30:54] Christ period by his grace we have given
[2:30:57] oursel over to him even if it's not in
[2:30:59] fullness yet we have given some portion
[2:31:01] of oursel over to him and that is the
[2:31:03] only reason that we are anywhere better
[2:31:04] off than the
[2:31:07] world don't give
[2:31:10] all and see if you don't end up just
[2:31:13] like the world we are not called to
[2:31:16] partiality we are called to
[2:31:20] fullness you want your kids to go
[2:31:23] astray keep your career before the house
[2:31:26] of
[2:31:27] G you want to lose your
[2:31:30] kids to the world to the sin to the
[2:31:33] flesh to the devil you as
[2:31:35] parents don't give all to God keep your
[2:31:39] career
[2:31:40] first keep your resident your residence
[2:31:43] first keep your close family first and
[2:31:46] you know easily Fellowship certainly
[2:31:49] whatever you do whatever you do don't
[2:31:52] forsake all and move to
[2:31:57] Lima best thing that I ever did since
[2:32:00] not because it's Lima not because of the
[2:32:02] pastor not because of you people it's
[2:32:04] because God said go and I said I don't
[2:32:07] want to and he says I supernaturally
[2:32:10] showed you and answered your prayer of
[2:32:12] what to do with your life you go and I
[2:32:14] said I'm gone to
[2:32:24] he has done financially what I would
[2:32:26] never even imagine in my world and
[2:32:27] that's the least of my
[2:32:30] concerns I have grown
[2:32:33] spiritually at a rate like under Miracle
[2:32:37] Grow and fluorescent
[2:32:39] lights amen and that's secondary to what
[2:32:42] I've seen happen in my family amen now
[2:32:45] that I have a family
[2:32:48] family when he says do something just do
[2:32:52] it and don't hold
[2:32:55] back when it came to the point in time
[2:32:58] that we had our second child on the way
[2:32:59] and I realized we can't be driving two
[2:33:01] hours both ways for service twice a week
[2:33:04] Saints I never prayed whether I should
[2:33:06] move to
[2:33:07] Lia the fact came up that now that we
[2:33:10] have these children I can't be in every
[2:33:12] service when the doors are open if I'm
[2:33:15] still residing 2 hours away I don't need
[2:33:18] to
[2:33:19] pray I need to
[2:33:26] move what if I don't is the
[2:33:31] question what if I don't and William
[2:33:34] comes to the age of accountability and
[2:33:36] he starts stepping off into the
[2:33:38] world and now I'm on my knees remember
[2:33:42] the Deliverance is in the commandment
[2:33:44] and I'm on my knees begging God SA save
[2:33:46] my boy my little William my precious
[2:33:48] little William save him save him and he
[2:33:50] says remember 12 years ago when I told
[2:33:51] you to give all and you still wanted to
[2:33:53] stay down south because it's better deer
[2:33:58] hunting let's make it real saints you
[2:34:01] put yourself there why aren't you giving
[2:34:04] all I'm not saying you're not but if
[2:34:06] you're not why
[2:34:09] not pride is why not you say well it's
[2:34:13] my career it's not it's Pride why did
[2:34:16] you care about your career if you don't
[2:34:17] have
[2:34:18] pride your financial well-being
[2:34:22] Pride your family status Pride your
[2:34:25] house
[2:34:27] Pride the scripture says it's all
[2:34:30] vanity the only thing that separates us
[2:34:35] from the world is if we have the ability
[2:34:38] to give
[2:34:39] all to die to Pride and to give
[2:34:45] all
[2:34:46] as the musicians
[2:34:51] come in the invasion of the United
[2:34:55] States brother brand says oh father
[2:34:58] while the great darkness is on the
[2:34:59] battle and the devil invading the
[2:35:01] countries invading the pulpits invading
[2:35:03] the churches listen to what he says now

[2:35:15] businesses invading the cities and the
[2:35:16] schools and the homes oh God help us to

[2:35:23] Lord forgive us now and bless us and
[2:35:25] keep us
[2:35:26] humble break us up
[2:35:29] Lord you said he that goes forth sowing
[2:35:32] in tears will doubtless return again
[2:35:33] rejoicing bringing them with sheath oh
[2:35:35] God break us to Pieces mold us a new
[2:35:38] Lord we're getting too much out of the
[2:35:41] way I am myself Lord I'm getting to a
[2:35:46] place where I'm thinking about how many
[2:35:49] will attend my
[2:35:50] meeting yes
[2:35:55] sir the devil invading the United
[2:36:00] States you go back and you listen to
[2:36:02] this tape you tell me if you think he
[2:36:04] was playing games you tell me if you'd
[2:36:06] think he wasn't been sincere you tell me
[2:36:08] you if he was just been
[2:36:11] flippant he is
[2:36:13] broken and saying the devil has invaded
[2:36:16] the pull pits and the United States and
[2:36:18] the churches and everything even he's
[2:36:20] invaded Me Myself and his manifestation
[2:36:24] of
[2:36:26] that is Lord I'm beginning to wonder how
[2:36:29] many will attend my meetings let's stand
[2:36:32] together
[2:36:35] please look at the example that he's
[2:36:38] given us compare that to where we're at
[2:36:42] he doesn't say Lord I'm beginning to
[2:36:44] lust after women Lord I'm beginning to
[2:36:46] count the finances Lord I'm beginning
[2:36:49] to his interpretation of the devil
[2:36:53] invading him is Lord I have got to the
[2:36:57] point I'm wondering how many is going to
[2:36:59] be attending the
[2:37:01] meeting why do you care how many is
[2:37:04] attending the meeting
[2:37:07] unless there's
[2:37:09] Pride see what he's dealing with pride
[2:37:14] pride see how it reveals itself how it
[2:37:17] exposes itself in the seventh angel I'll
[2:37:20] remind you who has a position in the
[2:37:22] scriptures I can show you very
[2:37:24] clearly would come to the point he would
[2:37:26] say
[2:37:28] Lord no he certainly wouldn't say Lord
[2:37:31] he would say Bill how don't you think
[2:37:33] you going to be at that meeting you
[2:37:34] think you'll get more than the last one
[2:37:37] you think the people will show up
[2:37:39] more an invasion of a
[2:37:43] devil true I'm going I want to close
[2:37:46] with this prayer heavenly father I'm so
[2:37:48] thankful for the
[2:37:49] god this is just after he told the story
[2:37:53] of being up on the mountain this is in
[2:37:55] 1962 right before the seals
[2:37:58] break heavenly father I'm so thankful
[2:38:00] for the god the one who leads me oh
[2:38:02] sometimes you can play something
[2:38:04] softly sometimes I can't hear him around
[2:38:07] me I get scared I want him close to me
[2:38:10] because I don't know what time I'm going
[2:38:12] to run up on the river I want him to be
[2:38:14] near me don't never leave me Lord right
[2:38:19] I can't
[2:38:20] talk I can't preach I can't hunt in the
[2:38:25] woods I can't fish on the bank I can't
[2:38:28] drive my car there's nothing I can do
[2:38:32] without
[2:38:36] you there was a point in time that I
[2:38:38] think he would have prayed like this I
[2:38:40] can't talk I can't preach I can't drive
[2:38:43] my car there's nothing that I can't do
[2:38:46] without
[2:38:47] you but
[2:38:49] now now God has come and dealt with this
[2:38:54] man and now right before the seals
[2:38:58] break he would include in his prayer
[2:39:02] Lord I can't even hunt that's right I
[2:39:06] can't even fish without
[2:39:09] you that's not coming from a man who
[2:39:11] thought he was a pretty good Woodsman
[2:39:13] thought he was a pretty good Boatman
[2:39:15] quite The
[2:39:17] Boatman this is another level Saints you
[2:39:20] want the seals to break in your life
[2:39:23] come to this point they'll break you
[2:39:25] meet him there they'll break let's pray
[2:39:28] together Lord
[2:39:31] Jesus father I pray that you would take
[2:39:33] the words that have been spoken and the
[2:39:35] inspiration that you laid on my heart on
[2:39:38] this
[2:39:39] father God I am embarrassed of how
[2:39:42] lengthy I've
[2:39:44] been
[2:39:47] but
[2:39:51] Lord you know that I didn't stand her
[2:39:53] and preach this of my own
[2:39:56] being Lord I didn't even stand here and
[2:39:58] preach this because I wanted to Lord I
[2:40:00] didn't even stand here and preach this
[2:40:02] because I felt like
[2:40:04] it you you know father Lord there is
[2:40:10] many here that has worked and they are
[2:40:13] tired in the flesh
[2:40:20] but father I
[2:40:22] pray that you would change our lives
[2:40:28] tonight father this
[2:40:31] has this has been unacceptable in length
[2:40:35] for a Wednesday night service but I pray
[2:40:37] that it would not just be a Wednesday
[2:40:39] night
[2:40:42] service father because if this was just
[2:40:45] another Wednesday night service I
[2:40:47] embarrassed of how long that I have went
[2:40:50] but if this has been
[2:40:52] you to come and reveal something to
[2:40:56] Benjamin seola how he needed to change
[2:40:59] and if this has been you in the
[2:41:02] foolishness of preaching to come and
[2:41:04] speak to your bride that you love to
[2:41:07] inspire them that there's another level
[2:41:10] that we need to come to then it's not
[2:41:12] been in vain Lord and then the time is
[2:41:15] accept acceptable and being here all
[2:41:17] night is
[2:41:20] acceptable father I pray that you would
[2:41:22] somehow let us snap out of carnality and
[2:41:26] forget about a clock and be real with
[2:41:29] you
[2:41:32] tonight God come and change our
[2:41:39] lives Lord may we snap out of this
[2:41:44] dimension and come up
[2:41:48] higher Lord may we not leave
[2:41:51] here just concerned about how long the
[2:41:54] preacher
[2:41:57] went what we have to do still yet
[2:41:59] tonight before we go to bed how early we
[2:42:02] have to get up to go to
[2:42:06] work God may you come

[2:42:19] work if there's anybody to be
[2:42:22] tired I can be
[2:42:25] tired but I value this Revelation that
[2:42:28] you dropped in my heart two months ago
[2:42:31] so much and I know that what it has done
[2:42:34] for me Lord I'm praying that somehow you
[2:42:37] would come through a supernatural
[2:42:39] mystical Channel and drop that into the
[2:42:41] hearts of this children these people

[2:47:01] Lord I want to go higher with
[2:47:03] you I just found the way to the next
[2:47:06] level and once again the way up is
[2:47:11] down we found that the enemy was so
[2:47:14] close
[2:47:15] [Music]
[2:47:17] cuz the enemy is
[2:47:19] me we find ourselves once again in the
[2:47:22] garden we have to make a decision which
[2:47:24] tree we eat off
[2:47:26] of say God help me to die to self like
[2:47:30] I've never died to S we didn't realize
[2:47:33] how many depths and how many layers it
[2:47:36] was going to be when we began this
[2:47:37] journey of dying
[2:47:40] out but God has exposed it so that he
[2:47:45] can deal with it I believe it with all
[2:47:48] my heart God has opened this channel so
[2:47:50] that he can do a work in our lives not
[2:47:52] just to open a channel to make us
[2:47:53] miserable and say I'm finished to open
[2:47:55] the channel so he can say I understand I
[2:47:57] want you to understand so I can come and
[2:47:59] help
[2:48:00] you I wrote down two
[2:48:03] lines while he was preaching and I wrote
[2:48:06] it if we can help
[2:48:09] ourself maybe he will let
[2:48:13] us just think about that if we can help
[2:48:16] oursel maybe he'll let us if we can't
[2:48:19] help oursel maybe he will
[2:48:24] amen I've come to the place where when
[2:48:26] it comes to this I can't help myself I
[2:48:29] need him to come and help me but what
[2:48:32] he's asked me to do is humble
[2:48:34] myself the scripture said humble thyself
[2:48:37] brother B preached the message on it
[2:48:38] humble thyself one thing I can do and
[2:48:41] he's given me the power to do is humble
[2:48:42] myself and lay myself down down and say
[2:48:45] God what I heard today is true now would
[2:48:47] you come and help me will you forgive me
[2:48:50] for my pride will you forgive me for my
[2:48:53] Envy will you wash that out of me Lord
[2:48:56] and continue to reveal it to
[2:48:59] me we've had such a good
[2:49:02] example even brother Ben laying himself
[2:49:04] bear as an example was a good
[2:49:06] example same God help me to be real and
[2:49:10] honest and truthful and lay myself bear
[2:49:16] and God is good

[2:49:21] a bride without spot a wrinkle and she's
[2:49:24] going to stand there in the Splendor of
[2:49:26] him she's going to be so much like him
[2:49:27] she will even be him he's going to have
[2:49:30] it and he's using the word to make sure

[2:49:53] don't know the title of it hopefully
[2:49:55] brother Ben can find it but when he when
[2:49:57] he reached down his hand for me he had
[2:50:00] to reach way down for me he didn't pluck
[2:50:04] me off the pristine shelf of good
[2:50:06] Christians that I want to make my bride
[2:50:09] that's not where he found me I don't
[2:50:11] know where he found you but I wasn't on
[2:50:13] that shelf I was down in the muck and
[2:50:16] the mire of the world I was lost and
[2:50:18] undone without a hope in this world Amen
[2:50:22] he didn't pull me off the good Christian
[2:50:24] candidate shelf but he reached way down
[2:50:27] and I don't ever want to forget what I
[2:50:29] was without him and what I am today

[2:50:38] soul was
[2:50:40] astray from the
[2:50:43] heav friendly
[2:50:46] way and was
[2:50:49] wretched and
[2:50:52] file as could
[2:50:57] be but my

[2:51:55] head for
[2:52:00] me oh I was

[2:52:11] there and he showed me
[2:52:15] that
[2:52:16] I could be
[2:52:21] free then he
[2:52:24] lifted my
[2:52:26] feet gave me
[2:52:29] Glory
[2:52:31] complete when he

[2:52:45] down his
[2:52:47] hand for

[2:53:40] great love to us Lord that won't allow
[2:53:42] that hiding spot to stay
[2:53:44] but you'll peel it back and you'll
[2:53:46] expose it

[2:53:58] often I defend myself feel offended get
[2:54:02] angry but I'm not treated
[2:54:05] right God I recognize the root of all of

[2:54:18] wash that out of me Lord help me to die
[2:54:21] in a greater way to myself to where I

[2:54:28] offended so that I don't have to defend
[2:54:30] myself and so that I don't try always to
[2:54:32] make myself look good but help me God to
[2:54:36] die in a greater way than I've ever died
