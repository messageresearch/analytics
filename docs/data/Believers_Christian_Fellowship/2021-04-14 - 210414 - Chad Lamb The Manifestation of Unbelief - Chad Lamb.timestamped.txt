[4:53] god bless you it's so good to see you
[4:55] this evening and while we're standing
[4:57] together let's take our bibles and turn
[4:59] to
[4:59] first john it's always a pleasure to be
[5:03] here and it's always wonderful
[5:04] to get to worship together amen what is
[5:08] so good to us
[5:09] first john chapter 4
[5:13] and i'd like to begin at verse 17 for a
[5:16] text tonight i'd like to take a title
[5:18] the manifestation of unbelief and
[5:21] we like to talk about the manifestation
[5:23] of unbelief but i'm going to start with
[5:24] a very odd scripture
[5:26] for that reading but i hope by the time
[5:28] we're done that it it makes good sense
[5:30] to you
[5:31] first john 4 17.
[5:35] hearing is our love made perfect that we
[5:37] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[5:39] because as he is so are we in this world
[5:43] there is no fear in love but perfect
[5:45] love casteth out fear
[5:47] because fear hath torment he that
[5:50] feareth is not made perfect
[5:52] in love we love him
[5:55] because he first loved us let us bow our
[5:58] heads and ask the lord's blessing
[6:01] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[6:03] jesus for this privilege to be here and
[6:06] god as we've gathered lord we've
[6:07] gathered
[6:08] to worship you to sing your praises to
[6:10] glorify your name
[6:12] and also lord defeat from your word lord
[6:15] you've brought us to your supper table
[6:17] lord may we come now and dine
[6:19] and i pray god that you would break the
[6:20] bread and may our eyes be opened and may
[6:23] we see you as you are
[6:24] may we eat from your hand lord as your
[6:26] lambs may we gain strength lord and may
[6:29] we go out and serve your purpose
[6:31] in this life in jesus christ's name we
[6:33] pray
[6:34] amen you can have your seats
[6:38] amen turn with me to mark chapter
[6:41] four
[6:44] quite a few scriptures we're going to
[6:46] read and again
[6:48] the title is the manifestation of
[6:49] unbelief and
[6:51] we're just going to take it from this
[6:53] angle and keep moving and
[6:54] and ask the lord just to give us some
[6:56] wisdom and revelation in the word
[6:58] as we move forward mark chapter 4 verse
[7:01] 35
[7:05] in the same day when the even was come
[7:09] he saith unto them
[7:10] let us pass over unto the other side
[7:14] and when they had sent away the
[7:15] multitude they took him even as he was
[7:17] in the ship
[7:18] and they were also with them other
[7:20] little ships and there arose a great
[7:22] storm of wind and the waves beat into
[7:24] the ship so that it was now full
[7:26] and he was in the hinder part of the
[7:28] ship asleep on a pillow
[7:30] and they awake him and say unto him
[7:32] master carest thou
[7:33] not that we perish that's a big
[7:36] statement
[7:38] see there was a problem they were having
[7:41] a problem
[7:42] but jesus had already spoke the word he
[7:44] said let us go into the other side
[7:46] so the word had already given the word
[7:48] let us go into the other side
[7:50] so their arrival at the other side was
[7:52] secure by the word
[7:55] the regardless of what the circumstances
[7:57] arose between the fulfillment of the
[7:59] word and the giving of the word
[8:00] never changed the outcome was secure
[8:03] because he said
[8:04] let us go on to the other side and he
[8:06] was the word amen and he was giving the
[8:08] word
[8:08] and they should have been able to rest
[8:10] in that but he was training his
[8:11] disciples
[8:12] through all of these things and so they
[8:14] arose
[8:15] and they asked the pivotal question and
[8:17] i want you to lock onto this question
[8:20] carest thou not that we perish
[8:24] and he arose and rebuked the wind and
[8:26] said unto the sea
[8:28] peace be still and the wind ceased and
[8:30] there was a great calm
[8:31] and he said unto them why are you so
[8:34] fearful
[8:35] how is it that you have no faith
[8:38] and they feared exceedingly and said one
[8:41] to another what manner of man is this
[8:43] that even the wind
[8:44] and the sea obey him
[8:48] so when when jesus told him to go to the
[8:50] other side
[8:52] he knew what was going to happen no
[8:54] doubt he was training his disciples and
[8:56] in their and in the way the storm
[8:58] becomes so bad that they fear for their
[9:00] lives
[9:01] and they wake up the master and and
[9:03] jesus preaches our brother ben preaches
[9:05] on this and he says you know he was in
[9:06] the boat the whole time you know
[9:08] nothing was going to happen they they
[9:10] they failed to recognize
[9:12] in whose presence they were whose
[9:13] presence was among them amen just
[9:15] because he wasn't active and he wasn't
[9:17] animated didn't mean he wasn't still
[9:18] there
[9:20] and sometimes in our lives amen there's
[9:23] times when
[9:24] when god is very active in taking a very
[9:26] active part but there's also quiet times
[9:28] amen
[9:29] and he's going to see what we'll do in
[9:30] the situation and it doesn't mean he's
[9:33] not
[9:33] there just because he's not animated and
[9:36] active to where we can see
[9:37] and tell that he's moving maybe he's
[9:39] just resting for a little piece to see
[9:41] what we'll do
[9:44] but but when they woke him up they
[9:47] insulted him
[9:50] when they woke him up they called him
[9:52] lord and master
[9:54] he had fed them and he had cared for
[9:55] them and he had worked miracles in their
[9:57] lives and he had healed their family
[9:58] members and
[9:59] and he had done all kinds of
[10:00] supernatural things to care for them
[10:03] and to take care of them and to protect
[10:05] them and when they got into the middle
[10:07] of a very very difficult trial
[10:10] amen and they forgot whose presence was
[10:12] with them they woke him
[10:13] up and said don't you even care
[10:20] we could look at those disciples and say
[10:22] you geyser
[10:24] but we do the exact same thing
[10:27] don't you even care that we perish don't
[10:30] you even care
[10:31] that this is happening don't you even
[10:32] care and i would say
[10:34] amen we love him because he first loved
[10:37] us he's already proven his love to us
[10:40] and fear will cat
[10:41] love perfect love will cast out fear and
[10:44] he that feareth is not yet made perfect
[10:46] in love
[10:47] and he hasn't yet realized who it is
[10:49] that loved him first
[10:52] and they woke up jesus christ and
[10:54] insulted him
[10:55] by saying don't you even care that we
[10:58] perish
[11:01] i say when we go to prayer let's not
[11:02] insult god
[11:04] god don't you even care don't you even
[11:05] see what's happening to me
[11:07] of course he sees what's happening to
[11:09] you of course he's present with you
[11:11] of course he cares
[11:14] and jesus turned and he rebuked the wind
[11:17] and the waves and
[11:18] he said peace be still and the wind
[11:20] ceased and there was a great calm
[11:21] and he said to them why are you so
[11:24] fearful
[11:26] now we would look at them in the same
[11:27] situation and say they have every right
[11:29] to be fearful
[11:30] but jesus does not excuse their fear
[11:34] we with human reasoning in a human mind
[11:37] with human emotions
[11:38] we would look at their situation if we
[11:40] had it on camcorder
[11:42] you know if we could go back and watch
[11:43] the whole scene play out we would say i
[11:45] don't fault them enough for being afraid
[11:47] i would have been afraid too amen but
[11:49] jesus didn't excuse it
[11:51] jesus says why were you so fearful
[11:55] he gave them no right and no reason to
[11:57] be so afraid
[12:00] and look what he links it to how is it
[12:02] that you have no faith
[12:05] why were they fearful because they
[12:07] didn't have enough faith
[12:11] and when i talk about the manifestation
[12:13] of unbelief
[12:14] i would like to give as one of the
[12:15] manifestations but the manifestation of
[12:17] unbelief as fear
[12:20] fear as a manifestation of unbelief
[12:23] because that's what jesus tied it to why
[12:25] are you so fearful
[12:28] and how is it that you have no faith
[12:30] because if you had
[12:31] faith you wouldn't be fearful
[12:35] brother brahma says in the message be
[12:36] not afraid 1961
[12:39] now i thought i thought on tonight a
[12:41] subject of a testimony meeting
[12:43] out of the bible and i want to read for
[12:46] a text out of saint matthew the 14th
[12:47] chapter the 27th verse
[12:49] and straightway jesus spoken to them
[12:50] saying be of good cheer it as i be not
[12:52] afraid
[12:53] now i want to take a subject for this
[12:55] testimony meeting of be not afraid
[12:58] there's two elements that control the
[13:00] entire human race in the world
[13:03] one of them is fear and the other's
[13:05] faith
[13:07] now it's either fear or faith controls
[13:10] every nation
[13:11] every denomination every individual
[13:14] you're either
[13:15] fear or faith that controls you
[13:18] and i don't know about you but i don't
[13:19] want fear to ever control me again
[13:22] i want to be controlled by faith but if
[13:24] i'm going to be controlled by faith then
[13:26] i have to get rid of fear
[13:27] and the only way to get rid of fear is
[13:29] perfect love
[13:31] because perfect love cast out fear and
[13:33] if i can get rid of fear and understand
[13:35] god's love for me
[13:36] amen then i can have faith let's turn to
[13:40] matthew chapter six
[13:42] we want to just read a few examples here
[13:44] and lay these out
[13:48] matthew chapter 6. now
[13:53] when we were looking here in mark
[13:54] chapter 4 we say why
[13:56] were they why were they so fearful and
[13:59] you realize that
[14:00] you know it might have been in the
[14:02] beginning of the storm that they weren't
[14:03] that afraid
[14:04] they had been through storms before they
[14:06] knew jesus was with them and he told
[14:08] them to go to the other side
[14:09] and this is the way it always starts for
[14:11] us you know it's not that bad and we can
[14:13] still handle this and we still have
[14:15] faith
[14:16] amen but but then as the as the storm
[14:19] increased and as the trial got worse
[14:21] amen they begin to have more fear built
[14:24] up inside of them
[14:26] amen and to fear the fear got to a place
[14:29] where the
[14:30] fear brought torment and overrode the
[14:32] love
[14:33] amen until they begin to question
[14:35] whether or not he loved them
[14:40] boy isn't this classic they began
[14:44] to question whether or not he loved them
[14:47] amen and
[14:48] and whether or not he even cared that
[14:50] they were going to perish
[14:51] and so many times that the trip the the
[14:53] trip the the trap
[14:55] i'm sorry that the devil lays for us he
[14:57] brings us into a situation and at first
[14:59] it's okay
[15:00] it'll be all right god will take care of
[15:01] it we even speak positive things like
[15:03] that
[15:03] but as it gets worse and worse and worse
[15:06] amen what happens is
[15:07] as fear builds what's what's happening
[15:10] is the fear is beginning to
[15:12] diminish the love because perfect love
[15:15] cast out fear until we begin to question
[15:18] whether he loves us or not
[15:21] now you may not say that you may not
[15:22] verbalize it but that's what's going on
[15:24] inside
[15:27] and in matthew chapter 6 verse 25
[15:31] it says therefore i say unto you
[15:36] take no thought for your life what you
[15:38] shall eat
[15:39] or what you shall drink nor yet for your
[15:41] body what you shall put on
[15:43] is not the life more than meat in the
[15:45] body more than raiment
[15:46] so in the first mark four when we read
[15:49] we were talking about a very terrifying
[15:51] situation
[15:52] amen and they begin to doubt and they
[15:53] begin to fear and they had anxiety
[15:55] anxiety turned to fear
[15:57] but now we're talking about a different
[15:58] kind of situation this is everyday life
[16:03] he says therefore i send you take no
[16:06] thought
[16:07] for your life don't even
[16:10] worry about what you eat or what you'll
[16:12] drink
[16:14] take notes off of your life what you
[16:16] shall eat or what you shall drink nor
[16:18] yet for your body what you should put on
[16:20] is not the life more than meat in the
[16:22] body more than raiment
[16:23] behold the fowls of the air for they so
[16:25] not neither do they reap nor gather into
[16:27] barns
[16:28] yet your heavenly father feedeth them
[16:30] are you not
[16:31] much better than they
[16:34] your heavenly father feedeth them
[16:39] do you realize the statement he made
[16:40] you're you have a heavenly father
[16:43] the same one that feeds the sparrows is
[16:46] the same one that's promised to take
[16:47] care of you
[16:48] amen but yet we're worried when the work
[16:51] begins to slow down or
[16:52] or they're calling about layoffs or or a
[16:55] potential slowdown in the economy
[16:57] all of a sudden we get nervous or how
[16:59] are we going to pay our bills how will
[17:00] we
[17:00] make our mortgage how will we buy this
[17:02] and how will we do that
[17:04] and jesus already told us do not worry
[17:06] about any of that
[17:07] because your heavenly father the same
[17:09] one that can feed a sparrow
[17:12] who has no soul how can he not take care
[17:15] of his own child
[17:18] remember you see these things begin to
[17:19] creep in amen and we've got to let
[17:22] perfect love
[17:23] drive that fear out and say i have a
[17:25] heavenly father
[17:27] he sees me he knows me if he sees the
[17:30] sparrow that falls to
[17:32] the ground not one falls that he doesn't
[17:34] know it and take knowledge of it and see
[17:35] it fall
[17:36] how much more so does he watch over you
[17:39] and i
[17:39] [Music]
[17:42] so this this is you say well i'm not
[17:44] afraid but when we begin to wring our
[17:46] hands and worry about
[17:47] do i have enough saved up for retirement
[17:50] am i going to be able to make it or
[17:52] or what if they what if they cancel the
[17:54] next contract what if
[17:55] my job lays off what if what if the
[17:57] economy goes bad again
[17:59] if we begin to wring our hands in worry
[18:01] and anxiety
[18:02] and fear over that i tell you what we're
[18:04] doing is we're becoming an offense to
[18:06] our heavenly father
[18:07] who has already promised to take care of
[18:09] all of our needs
[18:11] and i don't want to either with words or
[18:14] with actions
[18:15] ask him do you even care do you even
[18:18] care
[18:19] that i perish you even care that i don't
[18:21] have enough in the account do you even
[18:22] care
[18:23] that i can't take care of the bills amen
[18:25] we may not say that we may know better
[18:27] than the saiyan but our very
[18:29] actions prove that we're concerned
[18:31] whether or not he cares for us
[18:36] amen verse 27
[18:40] which of you by taking thought can add
[18:42] one cubit unto your stature
[18:44] and why take you thought for raiment
[18:46] consider the lilies of the field
[18:47] how they grow they toil not neither do
[18:49] they spend and yet i say unto you that
[18:51] even
[18:52] solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
[18:54] like one of these
[18:56] wherefore if god so clothed the grass of
[18:58] the field which today is and tomorrow is
[19:00] cast into the oven
[19:01] shall he not much more clothe you o ye
[19:04] of little faith here comes this
[19:08] statement again
[19:09] this is an issue of faith
[19:13] what's the issue of faith based off your
[19:15] worry
[19:16] and your fear over everyday living
[19:22] oh you have little faith therefore take
[19:24] no thought saying what shall we eat or
[19:26] what shall we drink
[19:27] or wherewith all shall we be clothed for
[19:30] after all these things do the gentiles
[19:32] seek for your heavenly
[19:33] your heavenly your
[19:37] not the sparrows but your heavenly
[19:39] father
[19:41] not just jesus's heavenly father but
[19:43] your heavenly father
[19:45] your heavenly father
[19:49] knoweth that you have need of these
[19:50] things but seek ye first the kingdom of
[19:53] god and his raiment
[19:54] and all these things shall be added unto
[19:56] you take therefore no thought for the
[19:58] moral for the moral shall take thought
[20:00] for the things itself
[20:01] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[20:04] thereof he's saying let's just overcome
[20:08] today
[20:09] don't worry about overcoming tomorrow
[20:11] god's already taken care of them
[20:13] let's look at matthew chapter 7 now
[20:17] in verse 9.
[20:21] or what manner is there or what man is
[20:24] there of you whom if
[20:25] his son ask bread will give him a stone
[20:28] or if he ask a fish will he give him a
[20:30] serpent if you then being evil
[20:32] know how to give good gifts unto your
[20:34] children how much more shall your father
[20:36] which is in heaven
[20:37] give good things to them that ask him
[20:41] pretty simple now let's turn to
[20:44] philippians
[20:45] chapter 4.
[20:51] philippians chapter 4
[20:55] and i would like to read verse 6
[20:59] chapter 4 verse 6.
[21:05] be careful for nothing this word
[21:08] careful in the greek means to be anxious
[21:12] to be troubled with cares so he's saying
[21:15] be anxious
[21:16] be troubled with cares be anxious for
[21:18] nothing
[21:19] so be careful for nothing but in
[21:21] everything by prayer and supplication
[21:23] with thanksgiving
[21:24] let your requests be known unto god
[21:27] do you read that right with prayer and
[21:31] supplication
[21:32] with thanksgiving you have to ask
[21:36] believing that he'll give it and you ask
[21:38] with thanksgiving at the time of the
[21:40] request
[21:42] this is not this is not begging this is
[21:44] not do you care do you even see
[21:46] would you please take everybody god i

[21:50] my father and i know you have my need
[21:52] and i'm asking for this and i'm thanking
[21:53] you for meeting my need now

[21:58] sparrow will fall to the ground that you
[21:59] don't know it and you can clothe the
[22:01] lilies you can take care of me
[22:04] so be careful for nothing but in
[22:06] everything by prayer and supplication
[22:07] with thanksgiving
[22:08] let your request be known unto god and
[22:10] the peace of god which
[22:12] passes all understanding shall keep your
[22:14] hearts and minds
[22:15] through christ jesus
[22:19] i say that's a good promise let's just
[22:21] make our supplication let's not
[22:22] care be anxious or worry about anything
[22:25] but let every request be known with
[22:27] prayer and supplication with
[22:28] thanksgiving and you'll have peace in
[22:31] your heart
[22:33] now let's go to matthew 14. i just want
[22:35] to lay in several of these
[22:36] things in as we move forward matthew 14
[22:43] and verse 22
[22:53] matthew 14 and 22
[22:57] and straightway jesus can train us
[22:58] constrained his disciples to get into a
[23:00] ship and to go before him and to the
[23:02] other side
[23:03] while he sent the multitudes away and
[23:05] when he had sent the multitude away he
[23:07] went up into a mountain apart to pray
[23:09] when the evening was come he was there
[23:11] alone but the ship was now
[23:14] was now in the midst of the sea tossed
[23:16] with waves for the wind was contrary
[23:19] and in the fourth watch of the night
[23:20] jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[23:23] and when the disciples saw him walking
[23:25] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[23:27] is a spirit and they cried out for fear
[23:30] but straightway jesus spake unto them
[23:32] saying be of good cheer
[23:34] it is i be not afraid
[23:37] and peter answered him and said lord if
[23:39] it be thou bid me come unto thee on the
[23:41] water
[23:42] and he said come and when peter was
[23:44] coming down out of the ship
[23:46] he walked on the water to go to jesus
[23:48] and when he saw the wind boisterous he
[23:50] was afraid
[23:51] and beginning to sink he cried saying
[23:54] lord save me
[23:55] and immediately jesus stretched forth
[23:57] his hand and caught him and said unto
[23:59] him
[24:00] oh thou of little faith wherefore did
[24:02] thou
[24:03] doubt and when they were come
[24:06] into the ship the wind ceased
[24:09] so here we know the story really well
[24:11] we've talked about it a lot and brother
[24:12] brennan preaches on it a lot
[24:14] but but but jesus comes walking on the
[24:17] sea
[24:18] and they said if it's you let me come
[24:19] and peter begins to step out and
[24:21] peter begins to be afraid when he looks
[24:23] about at the circumstances he begins to
[24:25] be afraid and sing
[24:26] and he cries out for help and the lord
[24:28] helps him amen
[24:30] the lord helps him but he says oh thou
[24:32] of little faith
[24:33] wherefore didst thou doubt and i just
[24:36] want to show
[24:37] the the the bible didn't say that that
[24:41] peter was doubting the bible said that
[24:42] he was afraid but when he was afraid
[24:45] jesus knew that he was doubting
[24:48] and sometimes i think we need to
[24:49] recognize what's going on inside of
[24:51] ourselves
[24:52] in times of trial in times of difficulty
[24:54] and sickness or
[24:55] strife or our family situations when we
[24:58] begin to
[24:59] see that and feel that fear begin to
[25:01] creep in amen
[25:02] we need to realize that that is doubt
[25:04] friends and we need to put that thing to
[25:06] rest
[25:06] quickly before it gets out of control
[25:08] because doubt left unchecked amen is
[25:11] going to go into panic amen
[25:12] when we begin to panic we're going to
[25:14] act in ways that's contrary to the word
[25:16] and we're going to forget that we have a
[25:18] heavenly father
[25:20] and so doubt brings fear and when we
[25:24] begin to see
[25:25] fear it's a manifestation of unbelief
[25:29] and when we begin to when we begin to
[25:32] see fear
[25:33] that's not the time to pretend that's
[25:35] not the time to fake but that's the time
[25:37] to get on our knees and say god
[25:38] would you please forgive me for being
[25:40] fearful right now
[25:43] it's time to check up with the lord and
[25:44] say lord would you please forgive me
[25:47] amen i'm feeling fear and i know that
[25:49] that's coming from doubt but i believe
[25:52] your word and i know you're my heavenly
[25:53] father
[25:54] and i'm asking for you to take care of
[25:56] this and i'm thanking you for taking
[25:58] care of it
[25:59] now give me the peace that passes all
[26:01] understanding
[26:02] we need to bring that thing into check
[26:04] amen we need to bring that thought
[26:06] captive to the obedience of christ
[26:07] and say this is not what i've been
[26:09] taught this is not what i've been
[26:11] trained to do
[26:12] i'm a more mature believer than this i'm
[26:15] not a little baby believer anymore but
[26:17] i've been taught
[26:18] not to doubt not to fear not to fret not
[26:21] to be anxious not to worry
[26:23] but i've been told to be careful for
[26:25] nothing
[26:28] i think if we just get honest with
[26:29] what's happening amen we can have a
[26:32] greater victory faster
[26:35] not justify our fear
[26:39] because the first thing we want to do is
[26:41] justify our fear
[26:44] like peter could justify his fear
[26:48] nobody had ever walked on water before
[26:50] there was no scientific evidence there
[26:52] was no experiments
[26:53] there was no records that he could go on
[26:55] he was walking on water and the waves
[26:57] were crashing all around him and it was
[26:59] a dangerous
[27:00] life-threatening situation he could
[27:02] justify his fear but god didn't justify
[27:04] his fear
[27:06] and when jesus was asleep in the boat
[27:08] amen and all the waves were crashing in
[27:10] and the boat was now full
[27:11] and they were despairing of their lives
[27:13] amen we you know we could justify that
[27:16] fear
[27:16] but jesus didn't justify their fear and
[27:19] we have to stop
[27:20] justifying our fear we have to stop when
[27:24] we are worrying and worrying and
[27:25] fretting and worrying
[27:26] we have to stop saying well that's just
[27:28] my nature that's not the nature of the
[27:30] holy ghost amen
[27:31] that's not the nature of christ amen
[27:33] that's a wrong nature and you may be
[27:35] susceptible to that
[27:36] because of your nature and your genetics
[27:38] and your upbringing but it doesn't mean
[27:40] that you have to give in to it it
[27:42] doesn't mean you have to live with it
[27:43] it doesn't mean you have to let it rule
[27:45] and reign amen if you're susceptible to
[27:47] worry if you're acceptable
[27:48] susceptible to anxiety and fear you need
[27:51] to take that thing for what it is
[27:53] it's an evil spirit it's of the devil it
[27:56] does not come from god
[27:58] and not justify and say well my mom was
[28:00] this way my dad was this way
[28:02] amen there's a power here to break the
[28:04] family chain amen
[28:05] there's a power here to break the yoke
[28:07] of bondage that have come through
[28:09] hybridization
[28:10] we've got the word of god we've got the
[28:12] promises of the hour and
[28:13] we've got instructions and it's been
[28:15] demonstrated before us
[28:18] that all things are possible to them
[28:20] that believe
[28:22] there would be anxious for nothing when
[28:24] he said it he meant it
[28:29] but we cannot justify our fear
[28:34] we cannot say well it's okay it's not
[28:36] okay
[28:38] it's something we need to take to the
[28:40] lord and say lord i want to die to this
[28:44] i do not want to be anxious because
[28:46] anxious
[28:47] comes from doubt because peace
[28:51] comes from perfect love
[28:54] and i know you love me and i know you
[28:56] love me
[28:58] and i love you give me that peace that
[29:00] passes
[29:01] all understanding
[29:04] and the message god's covenant with
[29:06] abraham and his seed from 1956
[29:09] prophet of god says unbelief can do
[29:10] nothing for you but damn you
[29:13] that's all it can do is destroy you and
[29:15] faith is the only thing that can help
[29:17] you
[29:18] so unbelief if there's no value in
[29:21] unbelief at all
[29:22] an unbelief accompanies fear
[29:26] unbelief accompanies fear
[29:30] when you go to reasoning and wondering
[29:32] then you begin to fear
[29:34] so unbelief companies fear that's why
[29:37] jesus said
[29:38] when the bible said that peter looked
[29:40] around and was afraid
[29:41] jesus said why did you doubt because
[29:44] fear
[29:45] accompanies unbelief or unbelief
[29:47] accompanies fear
[29:50] and so we as mature believers as the
[29:53] bride of jesus christ
[29:55] need to reflect his nature and
[29:57] understand that these things are not
[30:00] just part of our makeup i mean it's part
[30:02] of the human experience absolutely
[30:04] part of the human experience is to be
[30:06] fearful
[30:08] because as soon as adam fell adam when
[30:11] he heard the voice of the lord come
[30:13] walking in the
[30:14] in the garden he hid himself because he
[30:16] was afraid
[30:19] god said where are thou and he said i
[30:21] hid
[30:22] myself because i was afraid i was naked
[30:24] and i was afraid
[30:26] and so fear amen was an emotion that
[30:29] came with the fall
[30:31] and part of the human experience is fear
[30:34] but we've not been given
[30:36] that spirit we've been given the holy
[30:40] spirit
[30:41] which has the power to cast out fear
[30:45] and the message expectation from 1961 he
[30:48] says now fear has no
[30:50] value in it none whatever
[30:53] so i want to when i look at this and i
[30:55] believe the words of the prophet because
[30:57] it matches the scripture
[30:58] when it says fear has no value in it at
[31:00] all i don't want to waste one
[31:02] fraction of a second entertaining it
[31:05] because it has absolutely no value
[31:07] to it at all none whatever
[31:10] it's perfectly endless it doesn't it
[31:12] hasn't got one good thing about him
[31:14] if i was to be shot in the morning was
[31:16] going to be shot what good would it do
[31:17] to have fear
[31:18] what good would it do me you say well
[31:20] what good would have faith do you
[31:22] faith could deliver me but fear won't
[31:24] help me
[31:25] a bit
[31:28] you just get yourself all worked up and
[31:30] more nervous than ever
[31:32] when it comes time for the gun to fire
[31:34] so let's have faith
[31:35] faith could deliver me but if it doesn't
[31:37] what good would fear do anyhow
[31:39] just stay right with faith and hold on
[31:41] to it take god's promise and remain with
[31:43] god
[31:44] praise be to god this is good advice
[31:48] let's go to numbers 13.
[31:54] i look here in the exodus journey
[32:03] numbers 13 and verse 21
[32:09] at this point moses had sent out 12
[32:11] spies one from each tribe to go and spy
[32:13] out the
[32:14] land they were here at kedis barnea
[32:15] about ready to cross over
[32:17] he sent out the spies to bring back a
[32:19] report
[32:20] now verse 21 so they went up and
[32:23] searched the land from the wilderness of
[32:25] zen
[32:25] into rehab as men came to hamath
[32:29] and they ascended by the south and came
[32:31] into hebron
[32:33] where ahiman
[32:36] and telmai the children of anak were now
[32:39] hebron was built
[32:40] seven years before zoen in egypt and
[32:42] they came into the brook of eshkolen
[32:45] cut down from thence a branch with one
[32:47] cluster of grapes and they bare it
[32:48] between two
[32:49] upon a staff and they brought of the
[32:51] pomegranates and of the figs
[32:53] the place was called the brick of eschko
[32:55] because of the cluster of grapes which
[32:56] the children of israel cut down from
[32:58] thence
[32:59] and they returned from searching out the
[33:01] land after 40 days
[33:03] and they went and they came to moses and
[33:05] to aaron and to all the congregation of
[33:07] the children of israel
[33:08] unto the wilderness of peron to cadish
[33:11] and brought back word unto them
[33:12] and unto all the congregation and showed
[33:14] them the fruit of the lamb
[33:16] and they told them and said we came unto
[33:18] the land
[33:19] whether thou sent us thus and surely it
[33:22] floweth with milk and honey and this is
[33:24] the fruit of it
[33:25] now i want to stop for just a moment
[33:27] that when when they were back
[33:29] in egypt the god sent them a prophet and
[33:31] that prophet come to them and told them
[33:33] that is now is the time for your
[33:35] deliverance what was prophesied
[33:37] to abraham is now it's time to come to
[33:39] fulfillment
[33:40] amen and god is going to deliver you
[33:42] with a mighty hand as he told
[33:44] abraham our father and he's going to
[33:46] take you to the land of promise
[33:47] and he's going to establish you in that
[33:49] land and that is a land that floweth
[33:51] with milk and honey
[33:53] so now they go into the land and they
[33:55] bring back the evidence of the land
[33:57] and now they confess part of the word
[34:02] and by their confession they say surely
[34:05] it is a land that floweth with milk and
[34:07] honey
[34:09] so they're confessing that what moses
[34:11] told them is true
[34:14] moses had given the word of the lord and
[34:15] what moses told them is true
[34:18] and then they said this is the fruit of
[34:20] it now verse 28
[34:21] nevertheless they made a mistake right
[34:25] there
[34:27] first they were quoting the word and
[34:28] they were showing the evidence of the
[34:29] word
[34:30] now they're going to contradict the word
[34:34] nevertheless the people be strong that
[34:36] dwell in the land
[34:37] and the cities are walled and very great
[34:39] and moreover we saw the children of
[34:41] enoch there
[34:42] the amalekites the malachites dwell in
[34:44] the land of the south and the hittites
[34:46] and the jebusites and the amorites dwell
[34:49] in the mountains and the canaanites
[34:50] dwelled by the sea
[34:52] and by the coast of jordan and caleb
[34:54] stilled the people before moses and said
[34:56] let us go up at once and possess it for
[34:58] we are well able to overcome it
[35:02] you have two different types of
[35:04] believers here amen
[35:05] you have partial believers amen they
[35:07] were going along amen this is the same
[35:09] kind of believers that were going along
[35:11] with moses
[35:12] amen and they were singing and dancing
[35:13] when they had the great spoil of the
[35:15] land of egypt and
[35:16] when their children were robed in new
[35:18] garments that they borrowed from their
[35:19] neighbors and they
[35:20] had bracelets on them and earrings about
[35:22] them and necklaces and
[35:23] when they went out with a mighty host
[35:26] they were singing and dancing
[35:27] amen but when they came to to the red
[35:30] sea and they could not cross and
[35:31] pharaoh's army were coming behind
[35:33] this is the same crowd now that lost all
[35:36] faith and quit being believers
[35:40] and then after they crossed the red sea
[35:42] it's the same ones who started singing
[35:44] again
[35:46] and they became believers again
[35:50] until they ran out of bread amen when
[35:53] they ran out of bread they were not
[35:54] believers anymore and now they begin to
[35:56] cry unto the lord and say
[35:57] hey we should have stayed in egypt where
[35:59] at least there was leaks and garlic's
[36:00] aplenty
[36:03] and then the manna began to fall and
[36:04] they were believers again
[36:07] and then they come to where there was no
[36:09] more water and the water that they were
[36:10] brought to was bitter water
[36:12] and they stopped being believers then
[36:15] until moses turned the water from bitter
[36:18] to sweet by throwing the branch in
[36:20] and then they were believers again
[36:23] you see the problem amen
[36:27] the problem is when it was good they had
[36:30] faith
[36:31] when it was difficult or bad they lost
[36:33] all the faith
[36:35] that's not the believers that he's
[36:37] looking for he's looking for a believer
[36:39] who have just as much rejoicing just as
[36:42] much joy in their heart
[36:43] just as much faith amen when god is
[36:45] heaping blessings
[36:47] as when they get into a tight spot and
[36:49] it seemingly there is no more blessing
[36:51] amen and the diagnosis is negative and
[36:53] the treatments are obscure
[36:56] but he's looking for somebody who can
[36:58] take the faith of caleb amen
[37:00] and say yes i mean they're walled cities
[37:03] and they're giants and they're
[37:04] strong but we're more than able to take
[37:07] it
[37:09] let us go at once
[37:12] why because he believed amen he believed
[37:16] he believed all the way back in egypt he
[37:18] believed when they came out with a
[37:19] mighty hand
[37:20] he believed through the red sea crossing
[37:22] he believed the word of god
[37:24] amen when he saw the land and he saw the
[37:26] grapes and he saw the fruit
[37:28] and he knew that it was a a land that
[37:30] floweth with milk and honey
[37:31] he was willing to go all the way in the
[37:34] word and all the way with the prophecy
[37:37] regardless of the obstacle
[37:43] sometimes you have believers and friends
[37:45] and those that we know
[37:47] they're willing to go along
[37:50] for so long but when it gets really
[37:53] rough
[37:54] when it gets really difficult amen they
[37:57] can't go along anymore
[38:00] verse 30 again and caleb still the
[38:02] people before moses he said let us go up
[38:04] at once
[38:05] and possess it for we are well able to
[38:07] overcome him
[38:08] but the men that went up with him said
[38:10] we be not able to go up against the
[38:13] people
[38:13] for they are stronger than we and they
[38:16] brought up an evil report of the land
[38:18] which they had searched and to the
[38:19] children of israel saying the land
[38:21] through which we have gone to search it
[38:23] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[38:26] thereof
[38:26] i want you to focus on that that term
[38:30] it is a land that eateth up the
[38:32] inhabitants thereof
[38:34] because i want you to know that god is
[38:35] listening to this
[38:38] and all the people that we saw in it
[38:40] were men of a great stature
[38:42] and there we saw the giants the sons of
[38:44] anec which came of the giants and
[38:47] we were in our own site as grasshoppers
[38:49] and so were we in their sight
[38:52] 14 1 and all the congregation lifted up
[38:54] their voice and cried
[38:56] and the people wept that night and all
[38:58] the children of israel murmured against
[39:00] moses and against aaron and the whole
[39:01] congregation said unto them
[39:03] would god that we had died in the land
[39:05] of egypt or would god we had died in
[39:07] this wilderness
[39:11] and wherefore hath the lord brought us
[39:13] unto this land to fall by the sword
[39:15] that our wives and our children shall be
[39:17] a prey
[39:18] were not better for us to return into
[39:21] egypt
[39:22] they said one to another let us make a
[39:23] captain and let us return
[39:26] into egypt what a shame france
[39:30] after all that they've seen and all that
[39:32] they've been through and all that
[39:33] they've been delivered from
[39:34] what a shame but i'd like to take and
[39:38] turn the table to ourselves
[39:40] what a shame after all we've seen
[39:43] and all we've heard and all the
[39:45] testimonies we've heard and all the
[39:46] deliverance we've had
[39:47] and all that's god done for me what a
[39:49] shame amen to get into another situation
[39:52] and say
[39:53] god don't you care god we're not able
[39:56] we're not what do you mean you're not
[39:57] able you weren't able from day one when
[39:59] you were in egypt as a slave you weren't
[40:01] able
[40:02] but god is a boy man and with god we're
[40:04] more than able
[40:06] i mean shame on us amen for acting like
[40:09] the unbelieving israelites shame on us
[40:12] i said god let me have the faith of
[40:14] caleb amen
[40:15] let me stand and say the word says it
[40:17] has to be according to the word
[40:19] i don't know how amen caleb wasn't
[40:22] depending on his strength he meant he
[40:23] wasn't pretending on his arm or he had
[40:25] none
[40:25] he wasn't depending on his weapons he
[40:27] didn't have any he was depending on the
[40:29] word amen the prophecy said
[40:31] that they're going to go into the land
[40:33] he will drive out the inhabitants of the
[40:35] land
[40:35] he will give them the land for
[40:36] possession it didn't matter how
[40:39] all that mattered was the same one who
[40:41] who spoiled pharaoh the same one who
[40:43] destroyed egypt
[40:44] was the same one that would take him
[40:46] into the land
[40:48] they could believe in the spoiling of
[40:50] pharaoh because it was past
[40:54] but they had trouble believing in the
[40:56] destroying of the inhabitants of
[40:58] canaanland
[40:59] because it was present
[41:02] and as always just like with the
[41:04] disciples in the storm
[41:06] the visible physical circumstances
[41:10] was bringing fear and fear was bringing
[41:13] doubt
[41:14] and doubt was manifesting unbelief
[41:18] they were not believing the prophecy
[41:22] anymore let's go down here to verse
[41:27] six and joshua the son of nun and caleb
[41:31] the son of
[41:32] jefferna which were of them that
[41:33] searched the land rent their clothes and
[41:35] they spake unto all the company of the
[41:37] children of israel saying
[41:38] the land which we pass through to search
[41:40] it is an exceeding good land
[41:43] if the lord delighting us then he will
[41:46] bring us into this land listen to what
[41:47] he's saying
[41:49] he's going back to the love of the god
[41:53] he's going back to what god has done for
[41:56] them he's going back for the deliverance
[41:57] of the lord
[41:58] he's looking back to the love of god
[42:01] and he's saying if the lord delight in
[42:03] us then he will bring us into this land
[42:06] and give it us a land which floweth with
[42:09] milk and honey
[42:10] he wasn't talking about tactics of war
[42:12] he wasn't talking about a game plan for
[42:15] overcoming the enemy
[42:16] he was talking about a lord who delights
[42:19] in us
[42:20] will give us this land
[42:23] it had to do on the merit of god's love
[42:25] for him
[42:26] not their ability to overcome the land
[42:29] i hope that goes deep deep deep in your
[42:32] heart it has nothing to do with their
[42:34] ability amen to overcome
[42:36] they're looking at god's love and
[42:38] affection for them
[42:40] as the source for the prophecy as the
[42:42] source
[42:43] for the power that will give them the
[42:45] land and establishing them lamb
[42:46] it's because the lord delights in them
[42:50] not because they've done anything
[42:51] special or are capable
[42:53] of doing anything special
[42:58] let's read verse 8 again if the lord
[42:59] delighted us then he will bring us into
[43:01] the land
[43:02] and give it us a land which floweth with
[43:04] milk and honey only rebel
[43:06] not ye against the lord neither fear ye
[43:09] the people of the land
[43:10] for they are bred for us their defense
[43:12] is departed from them
[43:14] and the lord is with us fear them not
[43:18] oh what was caleb depending on he was
[43:21] depending on a god that loved him and
[43:22] had already proved his love for them
[43:25] they had forgot that there was a god and
[43:27] they had forgot that god loved them and
[43:29] then they forgot that they were the
[43:31] chosen of the lord and they were a
[43:32] delight in his eye
[43:33] amen they were just looking at
[43:35] themselves
[43:37] and that's dangerous friends to look at
[43:40] yourself
[43:42] let's go to chapter 14
[43:45] verse 26.
[43:48] but i want you to remember what they
[43:51] said
[43:52] they said this is a land that eateth up
[43:55] the inhabitants thereof
[43:58] and that our wives and our children will
[44:00] be a prey
[44:02] let's go to verse 26 now and the lord
[44:04] spake unto moses
[44:06] and unto aaron saying
[44:09] how long shall i bear with this evil
[44:11] congregation
[44:12] which murmur against me i have heard the
[44:16] murmurings of the children of israel
[44:17] which
[44:18] which they murmur against me say unto
[44:20] them
[44:21] as truly as i live saith the lord as ye
[44:23] have spoken in my ears
[44:25] so will i do to you
[44:28] now i want you to recognize that when
[44:31] they went
[44:31] back if you go back and you look at
[44:34] their murmurings and their complainings
[44:36] they never blamed god
[44:40] they they chided against moses and
[44:43] against aaron
[44:44] and they said why did you bring us up
[44:46] but we're better if we never come out of
[44:48] this land
[44:48] they never blamed god amen but god when
[44:52] he saw what they were doing
[44:53] say they murmur against me
[44:56] and i wonder how many times we've
[44:58] murmured against the lord amen
[45:00] we didn't say god this is your fault god
[45:02] why did you do this
[45:03] but when you say why is this happening
[45:05] to me why is my life falling apart
[45:07] amen you're just testifying that you
[45:09] don't have a god who loves you and
[45:11] watches over you
[45:12] more than the sparrows and the lilies
[45:16] it's a murmuring against god
[45:23] verse 28 say unto them as truly as i
[45:26] live saith the lord is
[45:27] ye have spoken in mine ears so will i do
[45:29] to you
[45:30] your carcasses shall fall in this
[45:32] wilderness
[45:35] and all that were numbered of you
[45:36] according to your whole number from 20
[45:38] years old and upward
[45:39] which have murmured against me doubtless
[45:41] you shall not come into the land
[45:43] concerning which i swear to you
[45:45] to make you dwell therein save caleb the
[45:47] son of jeff and
[45:49] joshua the son of nun but your little
[45:51] ones which you said should be a prey
[45:54] them will i bring in and they shall know
[45:56] the land which you have despised
[45:58] but as for you your carcasses they shall
[46:01] fall
[46:01] in this wilderness and your children
[46:04] shall wander in the wilderness 40 years
[46:06] and bear your whoredoms until your
[46:07] carcasses be wasted in the wilderness
[46:10] after the number of days in which your
[46:12] search the land even 40 days
[46:14] each day for a year shall your shall you
[46:16] bear your iniquities
[46:17] even 40 years and you shall know my my
[46:20] breach of promise
[46:21] i the lord have said i will surely do
[46:24] unto all this evil congregation that are
[46:27] gathered together
[46:28] against me in this wilderness they shall
[46:30] be consumed
[46:31] and there they shall die
[46:35] he's going to give them exactly what
[46:37] they heard he heard from them in his ear
[46:40] they said this land god called it a good
[46:43] land
[46:46] they brought an evil report against what
[46:48] god called good
[46:50] god called it a good land god called it
[46:53] their inheritance his chosen piece of
[46:55] land
[46:55] and it was god's land it was his land
[46:57] that he was giving to them
[46:59] and they bring an evil report against
[47:00] god's land that god called good
[47:03] and they said it's a land that eateth up
[47:05] the inhabitants thereof
[47:06] and so god had heard that amen and he
[47:09] had told them
[47:10] you shall die in this wilderness and
[47:12] your carcasses shall rot in this
[47:13] wilderness
[47:14] and now the land that was going to eat
[47:16] them up
[47:17] now they were free from that land but
[47:19] the wilderness they were in was going to
[47:21] eat them up one by one as they got
[47:22] buried in the land
[47:25] bury this one and bury this one and bury
[47:26] this one they said that land eats them
[47:28] up but it was going to be this land that
[47:30] was going to eat them up
[47:32] and saying our wives and our children
[47:33] shall be afraid he said the very ones
[47:35] that you say will be a prey the weak
[47:38] amen the
[47:39] incapable the ones that you feared for
[47:41] those are the ones that i'm going to
[47:42] raise up and they're the ones that i'm
[47:44] going to take in to possess the land
[47:46] what you thought was impossible is what
[47:48] i'm going to use what you thought was
[47:49] vulnerable what you thought was in
[47:51] danger amen i'm going to make strong
[47:55] see it's always the opposite of what we
[47:56] think
[47:58] they thought that they were going to
[47:59] protect their wives and protect their
[48:01] children
[48:02] and men and protect themselves but they
[48:03] were all going to die but the very ones
[48:05] that they thought needed protection were
[48:07] the ones that are going to take the land
[48:10] god was going to prove that he didn't
[48:12] need them
[48:14] they needed him let's go to hebrews
[48:17] chapter 3.
[48:26] hebrews chapter 3 and verse 17.
[48:33] this is referring to the same event he
[48:35] says
[48:36] but with whom was he greed forty years
[48:38] was it not with them that had sinned
[48:40] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[48:43] how did they sin they disbelieved
[48:46] and to whom swear he that they should
[48:48] not enter into his rest but to them that
[48:50] believe
[48:51] not so we see that they could not enter
[48:53] in because of unbelief
[48:56] but i want to ask you a question how was
[48:58] their unbelief expressed
[49:01] their unbelief was expressed in fear
[49:05] they were afraid of the inhabitants of
[49:06] the land they were afraid to take the
[49:07] land
[49:08] they were afraid for their wives they
[49:09] were afraid for their children
[49:11] they were afraid that the land would eat
[49:13] up the inhabitants thereof
[49:14] they were fearful they were afraid and
[49:17] being afraid
[49:18] amen caused them to disbelieve the bible
[49:21] says that they didn't believe
[49:23] the bible says why couldn't they inherit
[49:25] the land because of their unbelief
[49:28] is that right but they expressed it
[49:31] as fear so fear and unbelief go together
[49:37] let's go to mark chapter 8.
[49:46] mark chapter 8.
[49:55] we've read this many many times but i
[49:57] want to go through it because of
[49:58] i've never went the next step and showed
[50:00] what he says next
[50:01] this is mark chapter 8 verse 31
[50:05] and he began to teach them that the son
[50:06] of man must suffer many things and be
[50:08] rejected of the elders
[50:10] and of the chief priests and scribes and
[50:11] be killed and after three days rise
[50:14] again
[50:15] and he spake that saying openly and
[50:17] peter took him and began to rebuke him
[50:20] but when he had turned about and looked
[50:22] on his disciples he rebuked peter saying
[50:24] get thee behind me satan for thou savers
[50:27] not the things that be of god
[50:29] but the things that be of men
[50:33] peter was trying to get him to save
[50:34] himself but we went through all this
[50:36] before peter was really interested in
[50:38] his position in the kingdom and then he
[50:41] called verse 34 and then he called
[50:43] the people unto him with his disciples
[50:45] also he said unto them
[50:47] whosoever will come after me let him
[50:49] deny himself and take up his cross
[50:52] and follow me for whosoever will save
[50:55] his life
[50:56] shall lose him but whosoever shall lose
[50:58] his life for my sake
[51:00] and the gospels the same shall save it
[51:03] for what shall a man what shall it
[51:05] profit a man if he shall gain the whole
[51:07] world
[51:08] and lose his own soul so we know peter
[51:11] and peter's dilemma and peter's rebuking
[51:13] the lord and
[51:14] we know that the lord what the lord was
[51:16] saying amen was not what peter wanted to
[51:18] hear because peter had his own idea he
[51:20] had his own
[51:20] ambitions amen and and and he was
[51:23] telling the
[51:24] the the the lord that this is not surely
[51:26] going to happen to you you're not going
[51:28] to die
[51:29] and tricking him into believing he's
[51:31] going to preserve his life
[51:33] and he turned around and says get thee
[51:34] behind me satan
[51:37] for thou don't care about the things
[51:38] that pertain to god
[51:41] but the things that be of men and then
[51:44] he gathered him all together
[51:45] and when he gathered him all together he
[51:47] made this next statement
[51:49] he that will lose his life whosoever
[51:52] come after me
[51:54] let him deny himself and take up his
[51:57] cross and follow me
[51:59] whosoever will save his life shall lose
[52:02] it
[52:02] that's what peter was trying to do
[52:05] that's what the israelites were trying
[52:06] to do at candice barnea
[52:08] but when trying to save their life they
[52:10] lost it
[52:12] but he said if you'll lose your life for
[52:14] my sake in the gospels
[52:16] you shall save it see when we get into
[52:20] trouble
[52:21] trials and tribulations and hard things
[52:23] come
[52:25] we're really trying to save our life
[52:29] instead of just submitting and
[52:30] surrendering our life
[52:32] and saying whatever god wants if god
[52:34] wants me to die
[52:36] right here in this airplane i'll die
[52:38] right here in this airplane
[52:40] but i've lost my life i've been bought
[52:41] with a price i'm not my own i don't
[52:43] belong to myself
[52:44] i'm not here to save myself or to
[52:46] provide for myself amen if god
[52:48] amen when god saw fit that the apostle
[52:51] paul was destitute he was destitute when
[52:52] he saw fit that he abounded he abounded
[52:54] when he saw fit that he was blessed in a
[52:56] city he was blessed in his city when he
[52:57] saw fit to have him persecuted he was
[52:59] persecuted
[53:00] because paul lost his life so that he
[53:02] could find it
[53:04] but if we try always to preserve our
[53:06] life and we're always worried about
[53:08] preserving our life
[53:09] we shall lose it friends amen you cannot
[53:11] save yourself you cannot preserve
[53:13] yourself
[53:14] you cannot provide for yourself you
[53:16] might as well just turn the whole care
[53:18] of your whole being over to your
[53:19] heavenly father and as he desires
[53:22] as he sees fit whatever he deems
[53:25] necessary
[53:25] is what i will praise him for
[53:30] we have our own ideas of what would be
[53:32] right in each situation and what
[53:33] deliverance would look like and how god
[53:35] should answer our prayers and how he
[53:36] should save us and how he should deliver
[53:38] us
[53:38] and how i mean we always think we need
[53:41] more money but sometimes god says what
[53:42] you need is less money
[53:45] sometimes we think we need more
[53:47] opportunity but what we need is less
[53:49] opportunity sometimes we think
[53:50] we need we need more deliverance and we
[53:53] need to feel better and sometimes what
[53:55] we need for a season is to feel worse
[54:00] and so if you seek to save your life
[54:01] you'll lose it
[54:03] so let's just decide today to lose it
[54:07] let's lose my life
[54:11] amen let's go to john chapter 11.
[54:28] john chapter 11 verse 47
[54:36] i want to show this example in the
[54:38] scripture then gathered the chief
[54:40] priests and the pharisees at council
[54:42] and said what what do we for this man do
[54:45] with many miracles
[54:48] if we let him thus alone all men will
[54:50] believe on him and the romans shall come
[54:53] and take away both our place
[54:55] and our nation
[54:58] and one of them named caiaphas being the
[55:00] high priest that same year said unto him
[55:02] you know nothing at all nor consider
[55:03] that it is expedient for us
[55:05] that one man should die for the people
[55:07] and that the whole nation
[55:09] perish not so here the chief priests
[55:12] gathered together
[55:13] and the elders and what are they trying
[55:15] to do they're trying to protect their
[55:16] place
[55:18] and their nation they're going to try to
[55:21] save their place
[55:22] what is their place it's their position
[55:24] amen
[55:25] they they have a position under the
[55:27] roman authority and they don't want to
[55:29] lose their position as high priest and
[55:31] elders
[55:32] and they don't want to lose the nation
[55:34] amen so they go about with their own
[55:36] mind and their own accord
[55:38] to try to do what they believe will save
[55:40] them from the romans coming in and
[55:41] taking their place
[55:42] and they believe if if all them follow
[55:44] after jesus and
[55:45] and they make him a king and it'll cause
[55:47] a big stir
[55:48] and our political situation will get
[55:50] ruffled amen and so we'll lose our place
[55:53] in our nation
[55:54] so we've got to get rid of jesus so that
[55:56] we can preserve our place in our nation
[55:58] so they went about with their own plan
[56:00] and they got rid of jesus
[56:02] and just a few years later titus comes
[56:04] marching in
[56:05] and they lose their place and their
[56:07] nation
[56:09] it's just evidence again you cannot save
[56:12] yourself
[56:13] if you try to save yourself you will
[56:15] lose yourself
[56:19] if you just lose your life you shall
[56:21] find it
[56:24] praise god
[56:28] let's go to galatians chapter 3.
[56:35] galatians 3 verse 2.
[56:40] now the apostle paul in galatians here
[56:43] he's having a problem
[56:46] with the judaizers these have converted
[56:50] to christ seemingly
[56:52] but they want to keep the law and they
[56:53] want to make the keeping of the law a
[56:55] requirement for following christ
[56:57] they want to make it a requirement to
[56:58] the gentiles and and he's in this strife
[57:01] and he's in this debate with the
[57:02] judaizers
[57:03] and this is going to be the fight with
[57:04] legalism and and i i want you to just
[57:07] think of this for a moment
[57:09] don't leave it back 2 000 years but but
[57:11] let's bring it up today
[57:13] because what's happening is they could
[57:15] not just
[57:16] accept by faith they could just not
[57:18] accept the grace of god by faith alone
[57:21] that they could be children of abraham
[57:22] according to faith without keeping the
[57:25] law
[57:25] they had been taught so much that they
[57:27] had to have something to do with it that
[57:29] you have to secure your own salvation
[57:33] and you have to secure your own
[57:34] salvation by being circumcised and by
[57:37] keeping the law
[57:38] and by doing a certain minimum set of
[57:40] requirements and if you do all of this
[57:41] then you can find
[57:43] security in keeping the law
[57:46] and you realize that this is rooted in
[57:49] unbelief
[57:50] because christ come to fulfill the law
[57:53] to pay the price
[57:54] to set you free from the bondage of the
[57:55] law because by keeping the law
[57:57] no man can be justified you can only be
[58:00] justified by faith
[58:01] because the law is pointing out your
[58:03] flaws
[58:04] the law is pointing out your failures
[58:06] the law is pointing out the
[58:08] hybridization that you can't get rid of
[58:12] so now he's in this contested fight
[58:15] because what it is it's unbelief
[58:18] but it's religious unbelief
[58:21] it's religious unbelief saying that you
[58:24] have to do something
[58:26] that you yourself have to save yourself
[58:30] you have to be circumcised you have to
[58:32] be careful what you eat you have to
[58:36] and if we're not careful that same old
[58:38] pentecostal mentality can creep in
[58:42] and we begin we begin to find
[58:45] faults within ourselves and and we find
[58:48] little problems and we begin to doubt
[58:50] our own salvation because we're not able
[58:52] to keep every ordinance
[58:55] when it was based on faith to begin with
[58:58] this is what paul's dealing with now
[59:00] look at what he says here
[59:01] in galatians 3 verse 2.
[59:04] this only would i learn of you receive
[59:07] you the spirit by the works of the law
[59:09] or by the hearing of faith how did you
[59:11] get the holy ghost
[59:13] by your works or by the hearing of faith
[59:17] how do you receive the spirit by your
[59:19] works of the law or by the hearing of
[59:21] faith
[59:21] are you so foolish having begun in the
[59:24] spirit you are now made perfect by the
[59:26] flesh
[59:27] oh bring that home friends amen god
[59:30] god has called me and god has given me a
[59:33] seed of faith amen
[59:34] when i heard the message by hearing of
[59:36] faith amen i believed and received the
[59:38] spirit
[59:39] amen and now how am i going to top that
[59:43] how am i going to approve improve upon
[59:46] that
[59:46] how am i going to do better amen by by
[59:48] certain works or if i
[59:50] fail to do something how am i going to
[59:52] lose that
[59:54] but you see the same old mentality comes
[59:56] in if we fail here
[59:57] then i must not have it i'm not it i'm
[59:59] not one of god's i
[1:00:01] it was based on faith let's
[1:00:04] skip over to galatians 5. there's
[1:00:06] something very specific i want to get to
[1:00:08] here
[1:00:08] galatians 5 verse 1.
[1:00:12] it says galatians 5 1 says stand fast
[1:00:14] therefore in the liberty wherewith
[1:00:16] christ
[1:00:16] hath made us free and be not a tangled
[1:00:19] again with the yoke of bondage he's
[1:00:20] speaking on the same subject
[1:00:23] behold i paul say unto you that if you
[1:00:25] be circumcised christ shall profit you
[1:00:26] nothing
[1:00:27] for i testify again to every man that is
[1:00:29] circumcised that he is a debtor to do
[1:00:31] the whole law
[1:00:32] christ has become of no effect unto you
[1:00:35] whosoever of you are justified by the
[1:00:37] law
[1:00:37] you are fallen from grace
[1:00:41] for we through the spirit for we through
[1:00:43] the spirit wait for the hope of
[1:00:45] righteousness by faith
[1:00:46] for in jesus christ neither circumcises
[1:00:49] and availeth anything
[1:00:51] nor uncircumcision but faith
[1:00:54] which worketh by love
[1:00:59] what does faith work by love
[1:01:02] perfect love cast out fear
[1:01:07] this faith worketh by love what kind of
[1:01:10] love
[1:01:11] the love that god had to you when you
[1:01:13] realize that we love him because
[1:01:15] he first loved you and now faith
[1:01:19] worketh by love ephesians chapter 2
[1:01:25] now if you're concerned about what i'm
[1:01:27] saying about works
[1:01:29] don't worry because faith worketh by
[1:01:31] love and love produces works
[1:01:34] you'll keep the law if you love him if
[1:01:37] you love him you'll keep his
[1:01:38] commandments
[1:01:39] but it will be by love amen not by works
[1:01:42] and works will not produce
[1:01:44] faith and won't produce the spirit amen
[1:01:46] but faith will produce works
[1:01:48] and faith workers by love and love comes
[1:01:50] by a revelation of who you are and who
[1:01:52] you are in christ
[1:01:55] now ephesians chapter 2 verse 4
[1:02:00] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[1:02:03] great love wherewith he loved us
[1:02:05] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:02:07] quickened us together with christ
[1:02:09] by grace you are saved and hath raised
[1:02:11] us up together and made us sit together
[1:02:13] in heavenly places in christ jesus now i
[1:02:15] want to ask you
[1:02:17] why did he already quicken you with
[1:02:18] christ and why did he already seat you
[1:02:20] in heavenly places
[1:02:21] because of the great love we're with he
[1:02:24] loved us
[1:02:26] because of the great love we're with he
[1:02:28] loved us
[1:02:29] he has quickened you together with
[1:02:31] christ and seated you in heavenly places
[1:02:33] this is all past tense it's already done
[1:02:36] it's already finished it's a finished
[1:02:37] work with god
[1:02:38] because of the great love we're with he
[1:02:40] loved you
[1:02:42] he has quickened you with christ jesus
[1:02:44] he has seated you on heavenly places
[1:02:46] with christ amen
[1:02:48] and how can we now come to a situation
[1:02:50] in our lives and begin to question his
[1:02:53] love for us
[1:02:53] because of a difficult situation and say
[1:02:56] god why are you letting this happen to
[1:02:58] me
[1:02:58] he already proved his love to you he
[1:03:01] already proved
[1:03:02] it when he caught you up with christ
[1:03:03] amen when he set you in heavenly places
[1:03:06] in christ jesus
[1:03:06] and by faith he revealed it to you by
[1:03:09] his grace
[1:03:10] amen so you know that you're seated in
[1:03:11] heavenly places
[1:03:13] how can we offend so great a god who
[1:03:15] loved us so much
[1:03:16] by saying why god have you
[1:03:20] don't you care that i perish
[1:03:25] of course he cares he cares more than we
[1:03:28] could ever imagine
[1:03:31] sometimes when we get into these
[1:03:32] situations we need to go back to this
[1:03:35] that before i was born before
[1:03:39] jacob was born and esau was born before
[1:03:41] ether could choose
[1:03:44] he said jacob have i loved and he saw
[1:03:46] have i hated him
[1:03:48] before you were born before you could
[1:03:49] have good conduct or bad conduct
[1:03:52] he already raised you up with christ
[1:03:53] jesus and set you with him in heavenly
[1:03:55] places
[1:03:56] what do you mean does he not care does
[1:03:58] he not see does he not love
[1:03:59] of course he does he saw you before you
[1:04:01] were here he saw you in the trial before
[1:04:04] you entered the trial he already has the
[1:04:06] outcome and determined
[1:04:07] of course he loves you
[1:04:11] don't question that love
[1:04:17] let's read it again but god who is who
[1:04:19] is rich in mercy for his great love
[1:04:20] wherewith he loved us
[1:04:22] even when we were dead and sins hath
[1:04:23] quicken us together with christ by grace
[1:04:25] you're
[1:04:26] saved and hath raised us up together and
[1:04:28] made us sit together in heavenly places
[1:04:29] in christ jesus
[1:04:31] that in the ages to come he might show
[1:04:33] the exceeding riches of his grace and
[1:04:34] his kindness towards us
[1:04:36] through christ jesus for by grace are
[1:04:39] you saved through faith
[1:04:40] and that not of yourselves it is the
[1:04:43] gift
[1:04:43] of god if he's given you the gift of
[1:04:48] faith to believe
[1:04:50] he loves you with a great love
[1:04:54] and that love will never cease and that
[1:04:56] love will never stop
[1:04:58] and that love never needs to come into
[1:05:00] question in our hearts
[1:05:04] let's go to second corinthians
[1:05:09] chapter 11.
[1:05:17] see friends i believe this word that
[1:05:20] we've been given
[1:05:21] brings in maturity and it brings us unto
[1:05:25] christ-like
[1:05:26] ripeness do you believe that
[1:05:30] and christ-like ripeness
[1:05:33] is not only understanding a revelation
[1:05:37] of the mysteries of god
[1:05:38] but the revelation of the mysteries of
[1:05:40] god should produce something in our
[1:05:42] lives
[1:05:44] not an intellectual with an
[1:05:45] intellectualism so that we know
[1:05:47] something that's debatable we can debate
[1:05:49] and know something more than somebody
[1:05:51] else that's not the reason that he tore
[1:05:53] the seals off
[1:05:54] he meant so that he could show us the
[1:05:56] great mystery of god
[1:05:57] but he gave us the revelation of his
[1:05:59] great mystery because the revelation was
[1:06:01] to produce something and what was that
[1:06:05] revelation amen
[1:06:06] it was the rising of the sun amen and
[1:06:08] the rising of the sun was here to bake
[1:06:10] all the greenness
[1:06:11] all the immaturity out so that we can
[1:06:14] bake into the likeness of jesus christ
[1:06:16] as mature seed and so the revelation
[1:06:21] amen of predestination the revelation of
[1:06:23] our position with god
[1:06:25] coming from god returning to god being
[1:06:27] seated in heavenly places
[1:06:29] the election of the bride the calling
[1:06:30] out of the bride the bride at the end
[1:06:32] time
[1:06:32] all of these revelations should produce
[1:06:35] something in us
[1:06:36] and it shouldn't have us running around
[1:06:38] saying god where are you don't you
[1:06:39] recognize
[1:06:40] god can't you see what's happening don't
[1:06:41] you care
[1:06:43] there should be another revelation and
[1:06:45] say god i know you know me and i know
[1:06:47] you know where i'm at
[1:06:48] and i know you had a plan before the
[1:06:49] foundation of the world and i know i'm
[1:06:51] here as an instrument that you can work
[1:06:53] through and i'm trusting you in the
[1:06:54] middle of this trial
[1:06:56] because you're my heavenly father and
[1:06:58] you've deemed fit for me to walk this
[1:07:00] let me walk as an overcomer
[1:07:03] lord forgive me for forgive me for being
[1:07:06] fearful forgive me for my anxiety
[1:07:09] amen let me recognize your love from you
[1:07:11] lord let me see the seals torn away
[1:07:13] afresh
[1:07:14] right now in this triad
[1:07:18] he may not tell you the next step or how
[1:07:19] he's going to get you out of it or how
[1:07:21] deliverance will come
[1:07:22] but it doesn't matter if we can just go
[1:07:24] back and see
[1:07:26] what we were with him before the
[1:07:27] foundation of the world where we're
[1:07:29] going to
[1:07:30] what his purpose is right now then
[1:07:32] doesn't matter
[1:07:33] anymore what's happening will it be
[1:07:36] difficult yes
[1:07:37] will the flesh not like it of course not
[1:07:40] amen will the circumstances make you
[1:07:41] weary make you tired
[1:07:43] absolutely but those are things for us
[1:07:45] to overcome
[1:07:46] because he has already proved his love
[1:07:48] for us
[1:07:52] second corinthians chapter 11
[1:07:56] we're going to look at the apostle paul
[1:07:58] as a mature believer
[1:08:02] he says of the jews five times received
[1:08:05] thy forty stripes save one
[1:08:08] and he didn't doubt his sonship or
[1:08:10] whether or not god loved him
[1:08:13] i want you to think about these things
[1:08:15] not just read them as little sentences
[1:08:17] but to deduce five times he was taken
[1:08:20] prisoner by the jews five times he was
[1:08:22] taken into captivity and received
[1:08:24] 39 stripes five times
[1:08:28] he was can you imagine what it would be
[1:08:30] like for the guard to come and get you
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:32] to pull you away from the marketplace
[1:08:33] where you're speaking pull you out of
[1:08:35] the synagogue
[1:08:35] to take you down to the prison amen to
[1:08:38] strap you
[1:08:39] amen to strap your hands over the log
[1:08:41] and strip you
[1:08:42] down bare naked to the waist knowing
[1:08:45] that they've got a straw
[1:08:46] a strap there that they're going to
[1:08:47] stripe you down 39 times with the whip
[1:08:51] and not doubt who he was and not doubt
[1:08:53] whether god loved him or not
[1:08:55] and not doubt whether he was a son of
[1:08:56] god or not
[1:08:59] and the company says that they're going
[1:09:01] to lay us off
[1:09:03] and we wonder if god knows where we're
[1:09:05] at
[1:09:06] paul was strapped over a block amen five
[1:09:09] times by the jews and beaten 39 times
[1:09:12] and
[1:09:12] never doubted whether he was a son of
[1:09:14] god or whether god loved him or whether
[1:09:15] god knew where he was at
[1:09:20] and he didn't take the bait well if you
[1:09:22] were a child of god he wouldn't let
[1:09:23] these things happen to you
[1:09:27] i think paul was a child of god you
[1:09:29] agree
[1:09:30] and god let all these things happen to
[1:09:32] paul
[1:09:36] verse 25 thrice was i beaten with rods
[1:09:40] and never doubted his sonship or whether
[1:09:42] god loved him or not
[1:09:45] once was i stoned thrice i suffered
[1:09:47] shipwreck
[1:09:48] a night in the day i've spent in the
[1:09:49] deeps in journeyings often
[1:09:52] in perils of water and barrels of
[1:09:54] robbers and perils by my own countrymen
[1:09:56] and perils by the heathen in perils in
[1:09:58] the city and peris in the wilderness and
[1:10:00] perils in the sea
[1:10:01] and perils among false brethren and this
[1:10:04] is destroying
[1:10:06] all the pentecostal characteric
[1:10:10] faith preaching that god wants to bless
[1:10:12] you and god wants to give you money and
[1:10:13] god wants to
[1:10:15] did god not want to bless the apostle
[1:10:17] paul was the apostle paul not a
[1:10:19] son of god was he not in the will of god
[1:10:22] was he not doing what god wanted
[1:10:23] amen he never he wasn't questioning lord
[1:10:26] am i in your will why was i shipwrecked
[1:10:28] three times
[1:10:28] why do i have perils of robbers amen why
[1:10:31] are you letting me get robbed
[1:10:35] i'm in a missionary journey why did you
[1:10:37] let the ship
[1:10:38] wreck three times
[1:10:42] do you get the point
[1:10:45] just because all these things happen to
[1:10:47] us let's look back at the bible
[1:10:49] and say there's nothing out of the
[1:10:50] ordinary here there's nothing contrary
[1:10:52] to what was normal amen
[1:10:54] amen if we're going to have another book
[1:10:55] of acts then we're going to have a whole
[1:10:56] book of acts
[1:10:58] the good and the bad and all of it
[1:11:00] together god was not
[1:11:02] i mean god it wasn't evidence that the
[1:11:04] apostle paul was a child of god
[1:11:06] amen only in the good things he was
[1:11:07] still a child of god when he was
[1:11:09] shipwrecked when he's in perils of
[1:11:10] robbers when he's buried in the city
[1:11:12] perils of his country meant perils of
[1:11:13] the heathen
[1:11:15] what was he he was still the son of god
[1:11:17] when he was beat with rods when he was
[1:11:18] stoned once when he was
[1:11:19] beaten five times amen with 39 stripes
[1:11:22] what was he he was a son of god
[1:11:24] where was he in the will of god and did
[1:11:26] god love him every bit as much as he
[1:11:28] always had
[1:11:33] i hope the devil's getting a black eye
[1:11:35] tonight i hope he's losing his foothold
[1:11:37] i hope all his lies are being exposed
[1:11:39] and i hope they're crumbling right now
[1:11:42] because if god could love the apostle
[1:11:44] paul and let that happen in his life and
[1:11:46] paul could rejoice amen
[1:11:47] he could rejoice in his weakness he
[1:11:49] could rejoice in his sufferings and
[1:11:51] glorify god and then
[1:11:52] we absolutely have nothing else to do
[1:11:54] but say god you're wonderful
[1:11:57] you're beautiful and everything that
[1:11:59] you've ever done in my life has been
[1:12:00] perfect
[1:12:06] verse 27 in weariness and painfulness
[1:12:10] and watching's often in hunger and
[1:12:13] thirst
[1:12:14] and fasting often in cold and nakedness
[1:12:18] prosperity preaching doesn't have a lot
[1:12:20] to do with this scripture
[1:12:24] beside these things that are without
[1:12:26] that which cometh upon me daily the care
[1:12:28] of all
[1:12:29] the churches who is weak and i am not
[1:12:31] weak
[1:12:32] who is offended and i burn not if i must
[1:12:35] needs glory i will glory of the things
[1:12:37] which concern my infirmities
[1:12:39] the god and father of our lord jesus
[1:12:41] christ which is blessed
[1:12:43] which is blessed forevermore knoweth
[1:12:45] that i lie not
[1:12:46] in damascus the governor under eredus
[1:12:49] the king kept the city of damascus
[1:12:51] with garrisons desiring to apprehend me
[1:12:53] and threw a window in a basket was i let
[1:12:55] down by the wall
[1:12:57] and escaped his hands
[1:13:01] this is the same god who opened the
[1:13:03] prison doors for peter to go out
[1:13:06] the same god who when a viper was
[1:13:08] fastened to paul's hand shook it off
[1:13:10] into a fire
[1:13:11] was the same god who let paul get
[1:13:14] shipwrecked three times
[1:13:18] and god didn't love him anymore one time
[1:13:20] under any lesson another time
[1:13:23] god's love was fixed and perfect love
[1:13:27] casteth out all fear
[1:13:33] when troubles come and difficulties come
[1:13:35] and situations come up
[1:13:36] the devil comes right there to try to
[1:13:38] build worry anxiety
[1:13:40] and fear because fear had torment
[1:13:44] and fear and unbelief go together
[1:13:47] what's he trying to get us to do he's
[1:13:48] trying to get us to express unbelief
[1:13:50] but what is god looking for he's looking
[1:13:52] for a child of god to stand on his word
[1:13:54] and overcome by faith
[1:13:57] it's the trial of our faith friends
[1:14:00] being more precious than gold
[1:14:03] let's go to romans chapter 8.
[1:14:13] these are things we must be reminded of
[1:14:17] romans chapter 8 verse 31
[1:14:25] what shall we then say to these things
[1:14:28] if god before us who can be against us
[1:14:32] he that spared not his own son but
[1:14:34] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[1:14:36] not with him also
[1:14:37] freely give us all things who shall lay
[1:14:40] anything to the charge of god's elect it
[1:14:42] is god that justifieth
[1:14:43] who is he that condemneth it is christ
[1:14:45] that died ye rather that has risen again
[1:14:47] who is even at the right hand of god
[1:14:50] who also make inner intercession for us
[1:14:53] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:14:55] christ shall tribulation
[1:14:56] or distress or persecution or famine
[1:15:00] or nakedness or peril or sword as it is
[1:15:02] written for thy sake we are killed all
[1:15:04] the day long
[1:15:05] we are counted as sheep for the
[1:15:06] slaughter nay in
[1:15:08] all these things we are more than
[1:15:10] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:15:12] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:15:14] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:15:17] nor powers nor things present nor things
[1:15:19] to come nor height nor
[1:15:20] depth nor any other creature shall be
[1:15:22] able to separate us from the love of god
[1:15:24] which is in christ jesus
[1:15:26] our lord
[1:15:29] and perfect love cast out fear
[1:15:34] fear has torment
[1:15:38] i'm going to read something from the
[1:15:40] prophet here real quickly
[1:15:42] out of the easter seal from 1965. he's
[1:15:45] talking about the time that little
[1:15:47] sharon rose was dying
[1:15:49] he says i know that day when i walked
[1:15:51] into that hospital when i had my great
[1:15:53] challenge
[1:15:54] i seen my wife die me calling for her
[1:15:56] life and what have i done to stand on
[1:15:58] the street corner preach and pray for
[1:16:00] the sick
[1:16:01] and then satan said well he won't answer
[1:16:03] your prayer
[1:16:04] i seen her die but i know that in her
[1:16:06] was that resurrection power then bone
[1:16:08] shall rise again
[1:16:10] i see my little baby lay there and i lay
[1:16:12] my hand on say
[1:16:13] god don't take it look like he pulled
[1:16:16] the curtain down said
[1:16:17] i won't even hear you no more satan said
[1:16:21] there it is
[1:16:21] just one word he knowed better than to
[1:16:24] tell me that there was no god
[1:16:25] because i knowed that now catch this
[1:16:29] brother branham and another sermon calls
[1:16:30] this his gethsemane
[1:16:33] because this time his hardest trial he
[1:16:35] calls this is gethsemane
[1:16:38] he said he know better than to tell me
[1:16:40] there was no god because i know that
[1:16:42] but he said he don't love me he don't
[1:16:46] care for me
[1:16:48] cares not that we perish cares not
[1:16:52] that my little sharon road has
[1:16:53] meningitis and is dying
[1:16:57] you see the temptation friends even our
[1:17:00] prophet
[1:17:01] had to face this temptation in his
[1:17:03] gethsemane
[1:17:04] but he said he don't love me he don't
[1:17:06] care for me see every reason thing
[1:17:09] said you're just a young man yet 20
[1:17:11] years old there lays your wife laying
[1:17:12] down there in a morgue
[1:17:14] here's your baby going in there you said
[1:17:16] he was a great healer and he's all this
[1:17:18] and look what does he do
[1:17:20] one word he wouldn't even have to speak
[1:17:22] it just look down there and say
[1:17:24] just nod his head that's all would take
[1:17:26] place
[1:17:27] and it'd be healed but you see he don't
[1:17:30] love you
[1:17:31] he don't care for you letting your baby
[1:17:33] die right there now and even refuse to
[1:17:35] hear your prayer in this dark hour
[1:17:37] everything he said was absolutely the
[1:17:40] truth
[1:17:41] so what have you done work all day long
[1:17:43] until you couldn't hardly stand up and
[1:17:45] then sit up all night till 12 and 1
[1:17:47] o'clock standing on the street corners
[1:17:48] preaching
[1:17:49] making calls to hospital just come in
[1:17:51] and sit down in a chair sit there and
[1:17:53] sleep an hour or two and
[1:17:54] go back to work again next night the
[1:17:56] same thing and
[1:17:57] here you are about 21 22 years old every
[1:18:00] friend every young lady every young man
[1:18:02] that you ever associated with
[1:18:03] call you a crazy crank what have you
[1:18:05] done you made a fool out of yourself
[1:18:07] don't you see it i was just about ready
[1:18:10] to agree with him
[1:18:16] i was just about ready to agree with him
[1:18:19] see you had you would have to be there
[1:18:23] to know it
[1:18:25] you would have to have just had your
[1:18:27] baby die or your wife die
[1:18:30] and you'd have to be standing over a bed
[1:18:32] looking at a little 18 month old baby
[1:18:34] that you loved dearly
[1:18:36] that used to run to you when you come
[1:18:38] off work and wrap your little
[1:18:40] chubby arms around your neck and and
[1:18:42] cool over you and love you you have to
[1:18:43] look down in her suffering so bad
[1:18:45] her eyes crossed and swatting the flies
[1:18:48] away from her little eyes
[1:18:50] you'd have to be there to know that this
[1:18:52] is a gethsemane
[1:18:54] you'd have to be there to know what a
[1:18:55] trial this was
[1:18:57] because everything the devil was telling
[1:19:00] him was true
[1:19:00] and at that moment brother bannon was
[1:19:02] not feeling like god loved him he was
[1:19:04] not
[1:19:05] feeling emotional about god he wasn't
[1:19:07] feeling a tenderness of love and all he
[1:19:09] was feeling was heartbreak and despair
[1:19:12] and loss his feelings amen
[1:19:16] were were aligning with what the devil
[1:19:18] was telling him
[1:19:19] and the devil was saying now he doesn't
[1:19:21] care for you now he doesn't love you
[1:19:25] which is absolutely a lie
[1:19:28] but standing there looking in that baby
[1:19:30] begging god
[1:19:32] not to take this little baby in another
[1:19:34] place brother bam says
[1:19:35] she favored her mom and i wanted to keep
[1:19:38] her
[1:19:39] and raise her because he just lost his
[1:19:42] wife
[1:19:43] talk about heartbreak talk about agony
[1:19:48] and at that moment when the devil said
[1:19:49] he don't care for you don't love you
[1:19:52] that seemed true emotionally speaking
[1:19:57] that seemed true because he went to pray
[1:19:59] to god
[1:20:00] who healed vast amounts of people amen
[1:20:03] in his ministry
[1:20:04] now he's begging and he's asking god to
[1:20:06] heal her and god just put a black sheep
[1:20:08] down and refused to hear his prayer
[1:20:12] rejected his prayer rejected his calls
[1:20:15] and it felt like god didn't care and it
[1:20:18] felt like
[1:20:19] god didn't love him
[1:20:23] and i was just about ready to agree with
[1:20:25] him
[1:20:26] and something down in me that was
[1:20:28] quickening power
[1:20:30] said the lord gave and the lord take
[1:20:32] away
[1:20:33] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:20:37] amen what did he do he cut through the
[1:20:39] lie amen
[1:20:40] he cut through the emotion he cut
[1:20:42] through the despair
[1:20:44] he cut through it all and went back to a
[1:20:46] god that was greater than him that loved
[1:20:48] him and he said
[1:20:49] god give god taketh away blessed be the
[1:20:52] name of the lord because god reigns on
[1:20:54] high
[1:20:54] and he's just and he's right and
[1:20:56] everything he does is good
[1:20:59] it doesn't feel good it didn't feel good
[1:21:00] to brother branham even when he was
[1:21:02] saying that
[1:21:03] i doubt that he went on a shouting spree
[1:21:05] and then all of a sudden that he
[1:21:06] you know he had tinglies all over he
[1:21:08] just made the statement
[1:21:10] and then he said i begin to feel better
[1:21:15] he said in the message communion talking
[1:21:17] about the same thing he said then the
[1:21:18] tempter came to me
[1:21:20] there was the one time in all my life
[1:21:22] that i can call was the crucial moment
[1:21:24] my gethsemane
[1:21:25] and what was jesus doing in gethsemane
[1:21:29] amen jesus was wrestling with himself
[1:21:31] and overcoming his flesh
[1:21:33] and jesus was dying to himself in
[1:21:35] gethsemane and here brother branham said
[1:21:37] this was his
[1:21:38] i've ever had a trial if i've ever had a
[1:21:41] gethsemane this was his gethsemane
[1:21:43] and what was he doing he was dying out
[1:21:45] to himself
[1:21:49] when i was just barely holding on to the
[1:21:51] bed the devil said there you are
[1:21:53] that's the reward for trying to serve
[1:21:55] him you mean that he'll take that young
[1:21:57] 22 year old mother and lay her yonder as
[1:21:59] a corpse in the morgue and
[1:22:01] will take the precious baby your own
[1:22:02] flesh and blood and slam your prayer
[1:22:04] right in your face
[1:22:06] and then you mean to say that you'll
[1:22:07] serve him i was standing between
[1:22:10] opinions i had to decide
[1:22:13] then i put my hand over on her little
[1:22:15] head and i said the lord gave
[1:22:17] and the lord takes away blessed be the
[1:22:19] name of the lord
[1:22:21] i felt relief and one more quote he says
[1:22:25] in the message he careth for you in 1960
[1:22:28] and then satan came to my side he said
[1:22:31] and then you'd serve him here you are
[1:22:33] nothing but a boy and you mean
[1:22:35] what what have you done stood on the
[1:22:36] street corner everywhere you could and
[1:22:38] fasted until you was so weak you
[1:22:40] couldn't climb a telephone pole to do
[1:22:41] your work
[1:22:42] and what have you done but preach and
[1:22:44] cried and prayed and one word from him
[1:22:46] would change the whole picture but
[1:22:47] would he do it no he wouldn't do it
[1:22:50] he'll let her die
[1:22:51] and then you'll turn around and serve
[1:22:52] him i come almost in that hour
[1:22:56] when my legs wouldn't hold me up no
[1:22:58] longer i lean on the bed
[1:22:59] i said sherry you know daddy and she
[1:23:02] heard wheezing like and she looked and
[1:23:04] i know she was dying i thought just one
[1:23:07] word he wouldn't even have to speak
[1:23:08] he'd just look his own mind would just
[1:23:10] change the picture
[1:23:11] the meningitis would leave her and she'd
[1:23:13] be well just one word
[1:23:15] but yet he won't do it satan said then
[1:23:18] you'll continue on to serve him
[1:23:21] and i thought where would i go what
[1:23:24] would i do
[1:23:25] who would i go to where's my hope
[1:23:28] something happened to me i said a few
[1:23:30] years ago down here
[1:23:31] and i know that i love him
[1:23:34] what held in that hour it was love amen
[1:23:39] it was god the prophet said something
[1:23:41] happened to me and i know i loved him
[1:23:42] and you can only love him if he first
[1:23:44] loves you
[1:23:47] i walked over to the bed put my hands on
[1:23:48] her little head i said darling god gave
[1:23:50] you
[1:23:51] and god's taking you away blessed be the
[1:23:54] name of the lord
[1:23:55] though you slay me yet i'll trust you
[1:23:58] amen that's mature faith
[1:24:04] brother braham goes on to say in the
[1:24:05] church age book and the smyrna church
[1:24:08] age he says the cloudy skies and storms
[1:24:09] of life are no sign of god's disapproval
[1:24:13] neither are bright skies and still water
[1:24:15] signs of his love and approval
[1:24:16] his approval of any of us is only in the
[1:24:19] beloved
[1:24:20] his love is elective which he had for us
[1:24:22] before the foundation of the world
[1:24:24] does he love us oh yes but how shall we
[1:24:28] know
[1:24:29] we shall know because he said so
[1:24:32] not because everything works out not
[1:24:35] because it's always easy
[1:24:37] not because we're delivered from every
[1:24:38] trial the apostle paul wasn't delivered
[1:24:40] from every child brother branham wasn't
[1:24:41] delivered from every child
[1:24:44] but how shall we know because he said so
[1:24:47] and manifest that he did love us for he
[1:24:50] bought brought us to himself
[1:24:52] and gave us of a spirit placing us as
[1:24:54] sons
[1:24:57] and how shall i prove my love to him by
[1:24:59] believing what he said
[1:25:01] and by conducting myself with joy amidst
[1:25:04] the trials
[1:25:05] that he in his wisdom allows to come my
[1:25:08] path
[1:25:08] come come to pass how do i know he loved
[1:25:12] me because he said so
[1:25:14] and he gave me of his spirit
[1:25:17] but how shall i prove my love to him
[1:25:20] by conducting myself with joy amidst the
[1:25:23] trials that he and his wisdom
[1:25:25] allow to come to pass
[1:25:31] let's turn to ephesians chapter 3. i
[1:25:34] want to read just two more scriptures
[1:25:35] and we'll close
[1:25:37] ephesians chapter 3.
[1:25:40] verse 14.
[1:25:46] ephesians 3 and 14 for this cause i bow
[1:25:50] my knees into the father of our lord
[1:25:51] jesus christ
[1:25:53] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[1:25:54] earth is named that he would grant you
[1:25:56] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:25:58] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:26:00] in the inner man that christ might dwell
[1:26:03] in your hearts by faith
[1:26:04] that you being rooted and grounded in
[1:26:06] love may be able to comprehend with all
[1:26:09] saints
[1:26:10] what is the breadth and length and depth
[1:26:12] and height
[1:26:13] and to know the love of christ which
[1:26:15] passes knowledge that you might be
[1:26:17] filled with all the fullness of god
[1:26:19] now unto him that is able to do
[1:26:21] exceedingly abundantly above
[1:26:23] all that we ask or think according to
[1:26:25] the power that worketh in us
[1:26:27] unto him be glory in the church by jesus
[1:26:29] christ throughout
[1:26:30] all ages world without end
[1:26:34] amen paul is praying that you'll be able
[1:26:37] to comprehend
[1:26:39] that christ may dwell in your heart by
[1:26:41] faith that you may be grooted and
[1:26:43] grounded
[1:26:44] in love what are you going to be rooted
[1:26:45] and grounded in in
[1:26:48] love may be able to comprehend with all
[1:26:51] saints what is the breadth
[1:26:53] and length and depth and height and to
[1:26:56] know the love of christ which passes
[1:26:57] knowledge
[1:26:58] that you might be filled with all the
[1:27:00] fullness of god
[1:27:04] that's why when we talked about
[1:27:05] manifestations of unbelief
[1:27:07] doubt is a manifestation of unbelief and
[1:27:10] doubt
[1:27:10] comes with fear fear brings on doubt
[1:27:14] but perfect love will cast out fear
[1:27:18] a revelation of his love for us
[1:27:22] will cast out fear a revelation
[1:27:25] of the mysteries that we're laying under
[1:27:27] the seals and the mystery of the seventh
[1:27:29] seal
[1:27:30] that that revelation of that love that
[1:27:33] god has for the attributes
[1:27:36] that revelation is perfect love
[1:27:40] and it will cast out fear it'll cast
[1:27:44] away
[1:27:44] doubt it'll cast away unbelief it'll
[1:27:47] cast away all those things
[1:27:49] and we will know him who loved us and
[1:27:52] chose us
[1:27:52] and gave himself for us and will sustain
[1:27:55] us and keep us through every trial
[1:27:57] what did the apostle paul had that will
[1:27:59] keep him when he was on a block being
[1:28:01] beat
[1:28:01] it was the love of christ it was the
[1:28:04] revelation that christ died for him
[1:28:05] personally it was the revelation that
[1:28:08] god loved him so much through christ
[1:28:10] that he would come and he would die in
[1:28:12] his place so that he could be free and
[1:28:13] be united back to him
[1:28:14] that love held him on the beating block
[1:28:16] that love held him when he was beat with
[1:28:18] rods that love held him when he was
[1:28:19] stoned
[1:28:20] and when he was shipwrecked and when he
[1:28:21] was abused and when he was cast out and
[1:28:23] rejected
[1:28:25] it was that love that kept him not
[1:28:28] because god answered every prayer
[1:28:30] immediately and because everything
[1:28:31] worked out the way he thought it was
[1:28:32] going to work out
[1:28:34] that wasn't that wasn't the love that
[1:28:36] held
[1:28:37] it was a love that came from revelation
[1:28:39] that he loved me first
[1:28:41] and he chose me and i'm his bride by his
[1:28:44] choosing
[1:28:45] and his love for me won't change let's
[1:28:48] go to first corinthians 13.
[1:28:51] this will be our last scripture that we
[1:28:54] read first corinthians chapter 13.
[1:29:04] and now abideth faith hope charity
[1:29:07] these three but the greatest of these
[1:29:11] is love charity is the word for love in
[1:29:14] the bible
[1:29:16] faith hope and charity but the greatest
[1:29:19] of these
[1:29:20] is charity god has built up his church
[1:29:24] through seven church ages
[1:29:26] but he capped it off with the capstone
[1:29:29] of love
[1:29:30] divine love god when he opened the seals
[1:29:34] when he come himself to open the seals
[1:29:35] what was he doing he was opening the
[1:29:37] love letter
[1:29:39] and what was he opening the love letter
[1:29:41] for he was opening the love letter so
[1:29:42] that you could see your name was there
[1:29:45] so that you were the recipient of the
[1:29:47] love letter so that his love for you
[1:29:49] would be secure
[1:29:50] and you would be secure in his love and
[1:29:52] that perfect love would cast out fear
[1:29:54] and fear wouldn't bring any doubt and
[1:29:56] there would be no more unbelief in the
[1:29:57] bride
[1:29:59] now we're not secure because of
[1:30:03] legalism we're not secure
[1:30:06] because of what we know we're not secure
[1:30:09] because everything works out we're not
[1:30:10] secure because there's never any trouble
[1:30:12] never any trials never any forsaking
[1:30:14] that's not what gives us security
[1:30:16] but our security comes in the mystery
[1:30:18] that was in the love letter
[1:30:20] and then the love letter was the mystery
[1:30:22] that you're mine
[1:30:24] no matter what happens your mind before
[1:30:26] you took one action on earth you were
[1:30:28] mine amen no matter what happens at the
[1:30:30] end you'll still be mine you come from
[1:30:31] me
[1:30:31] you're coming back to me i chose you for
[1:30:33] this purpose you're mine
[1:30:37] so what shall separate us from the love
[1:30:39] of god shall persecution shall
[1:30:41] tribulation
[1:30:42] shall strive shall sickness shall
[1:30:44] abandonment shall anything separate us
[1:30:46] from the love of god
[1:30:48] that is in christ jesus i'm persuaded
[1:30:51] that nothing
[1:30:52] amen shall separate us from the love of
[1:30:54] god
[1:30:56] your hardest trial can't separate you
[1:30:58] from the love of god
[1:30:59] and all the devil's lies can't separate
[1:31:01] you from the love of god
[1:31:02] and your own mistake can't separate you
[1:31:04] from the love of god
[1:31:05] that's what the blood is for
[1:31:08] amen no more fear
[1:31:12] not because i have a bumper sticker that
[1:31:14] says no fear
[1:31:16] but because of the revelation of his
[1:31:19] love
[1:31:20] because of the great capstone that's
[1:31:22] come down this earth god himself
[1:31:24] in christ himself the bridegroom in love
[1:31:28] to come to show us his love to come to
[1:31:30] give us his love
[1:31:31] to be united with us in love so that
[1:31:35] perfect
[1:31:35] love will cast out fear
[1:31:40] i don't know about you but i'm thankful
[1:31:44] for that love let's all stand
[1:31:48] musicians if you'll come by the blake if
[1:31:50] you'll come
[1:31:53] next time things begin to get chaotic in
[1:31:56] life and
[1:31:58] seemingly they go out of control
[1:32:02] things come in such a wave sometimes
[1:32:04] they come so fast and they sum
[1:32:06] in such cycles that you can go from
[1:32:08] everything being okay and under control
[1:32:10] to having a feeling of absolute chaos
[1:32:12] breaking out your life and no control
[1:32:14] anymore
[1:32:18] but that's just a feeling that's not the
[1:32:20] reality
[1:32:23] and you can get to a place where you can
[1:32:26] the devil can bring questions in your
[1:32:27] mind

[1:35:25] in the name of jesus christ
[1:35:28] satan we recognize you in all your ploys
[1:35:30] and all your schemes
[1:35:32] to cause us to be fearful to cause us to
[1:35:35] doubt
[1:35:36] but perfect love is casting out fear

[1:36:19] these things from your word may they not
[1:36:21] depart from us when we walk out those
[1:36:23] doors and face our next trial
[1:36:24] but may they go deep into our hearts and
[1:36:26] become a natural response that comes out
[1:36:29] of us
[1:36:30] that we can in the hour of temptation
[1:36:32] like the prophet say
[1:36:33] the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
[1:36:36] blessed be the name of the lord
