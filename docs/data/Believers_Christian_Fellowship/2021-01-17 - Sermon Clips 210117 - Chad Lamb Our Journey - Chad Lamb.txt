========================================

when we listened to brother branham on tape say when you heard the eagle scream you recognized it was eagle food and left all the others you've been turned into the living image of the living god you heard from your theophany you can say amen amen when you're looking listen to brother branham look look at a group of living people and say i was over beyond the curtain of time and i seen them all over there and i seen you all over there you can say that's nothing but the truth why because i got something the pharisee doesn't have i got something the theologian doesn't have what i have is i have a connection with god amen i've got a link to god i've got some way to hear amen some connection to the heavenly to the eternal that says that's true when the prophet says something in your heart it says that's true and he says something else it doesn't matter what your head your head can be saying what where was that i didn't hear that scripture amen don't tell me mine's the only head that does that i'm going to have to go back and pray now your head your head can be saying your mind your intellect can be saying what scripture is that i don't think he quoted that scripture right i don't remember it that way but didn't he say over here this way your head can be doing that but something in your heart's saying amen amen amen that's the truth explain it to me i don't know but it's the truth hallelujah if we got that friends we should have confidence amen we should be happy people we should say praise be to god but i got this problem in my life and i and i don't seem to overcome amen just focus on the thing that you got amen and the thing that you got will change everything else we spend so much time trying to be a pharisee that we won't be a disciple look at peter trying to compare his life with the pharisee peter the ignorant unlearned fisherman who really couldn't keep his mouth shut and got himself in a lot of trouble even with the lord imagine him trying imagine him trying to compare himself with judas you see this is where we make our mistake we don't put our focus on the most important thing we get deceit by the devil to try to become a pharisee i don't want to be a pharisee i want to be a real raw rugged true believer and i want god to take that life that's inside of me and i want him to live his own life in me i don't want to decide what he wants i don't want to try to be something i'm not i want the reality living in me to push out and make everything the way god wants it
