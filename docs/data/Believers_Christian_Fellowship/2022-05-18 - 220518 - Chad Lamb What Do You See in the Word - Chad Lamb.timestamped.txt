[11:50] gather like this lord as we come
[11:52] with expectation in our hearts lord
[11:54] because you've been so faithful to your
[11:56] word
[11:57] you've promised lord if we gather like
[11:59] this that you'll be in our midst
[12:01] and you've promised lord that through
[12:02] the preaching you would save souls
[12:05] god we're here to receive from you that
[12:07] portion we have need of
[12:09] god we're looking to you to provide and
[12:11] we just pray lord that you would be
[12:12] exalted in all that would be said and
[12:14] done
[12:15] now you would take the preeminence lord
[12:16] and that you would take these lips of
[12:18] clay and preach your eternal words of
[12:20] life
[12:22] we love you we commit ourselves to you
[12:24] know we pray that you would help us to
[12:26] receive all that you have for us in this
[12:27] day
[12:28] in jesus christ's name we pray amen

[12:35] proverbs chapter 27. we want to welcome
[12:38] brother abraham myra he got in last
[12:41] night i went picked him up in dayton and
[12:43] we got back to the house yesterday or
[12:45] last night and so he was very tired
[12:47] after a long long journey he traveled
[12:49] for two days to come and see us and so
[12:52] you don't know what a sacrifice it is
[12:54] for me to be up here and allow that
[12:55] brother to sit back there because i
[12:57] would love to be hearing and minister
[12:59] the word so
[13:00] i'm trying to be good and have brotherly
[13:02] kindness amen
[13:04] but god bless you brother abraham it's

[14:30] come
[14:31] looking forward to hearing the word to
[14:33] receive my portion amen i hope you get
[14:35] yours too but i'm determined to get mine
[14:38] because i just i need the lord and i'm
[14:40] looking for him to speak
[14:42] amen while we're standing let's look at
[14:43] proverbs chapter 27
[14:46] and verse 19.
[14:51] let's read one one scripture here
[14:54] 27-19
[14:56] as in water face answered the face
[14:59] so the heart of man
[15:01] to man
[15:02] man god bless you so seated we ask the
[15:04] lord to bless us as we look into his
[15:06] word
[15:07] and i want to just focus on the first
[15:09] part of that scripture and i'd like to
[15:11] read this quote
[15:13] out of identification the prophet says
[15:15] and that's what we want to look at
[15:17] tonight i want to look at me and i want
[15:19] you to look at yourself and as we look
[15:21] into god's great mirror of his word
[15:25] let's be able to identify ourselves with
[15:27] some that we're going to speak about
[15:29] some of the characters of other times
[15:31] and i want to see myself in god's
[15:33] looking glass
[15:34] amen and so brother branham's telling us
[15:36] the bible is god's great mirror god's
[15:38] looking glass and we should be looking
[15:40] into that to see ourselves and some
[15:43] character something that's happened we
[15:44] can look and see ourselves so i titled
[15:47] this this evening what do you see in the
[15:49] word so it's a very personal question
[15:51] what do you see
[15:53] in the word
[15:54] and we're going to talk about that for a
[15:56] little bit of time
[15:58] delay a little bit of background let's
[15:59] go to exodus chapter 34.
[16:03] i'm going to lay this scripture in so i
[16:05] can move in to another scripture
[16:08] exodus 34.
[16:10] so what do you see when you look into
[16:12] the word we're going to find out that's
[16:14] a critical question
[16:16] it it really
[16:18] the
[16:19] when we look in when we look into this
[16:21] as we go further it's going to become
[16:22] very obvious obvious how critical that
[16:24] is
[16:25] what do you see when what what do you
[16:28] see in the word when you look into the
[16:30] word what do you see because what you
[16:32] see has everything to do with how you're
[16:34] going to live and who you are and so
[16:37] let's look at exodus 34
[16:39] verse 33.
[16:41] this is in the exodus journey we're
[16:43] going to read about moses
[16:45] and it says
[16:46] until moses had done speaking with them
[16:50] he put a veil on his face
[16:52] but when moses went in before the lord
[16:54] to speak with him he took the veil off
[16:56] until he had come out
[16:57] and he come out and spake unto the
[16:59] children of israel
[17:00] that which he was commanded and the
[17:02] children of israel saw the face of moses
[17:04] that the skin of moses face shone
[17:07] and moses put the veil upon his face
[17:09] again
[17:10] until he went in to speak with him
[17:12] we know this portion of scripture
[17:14] brother rem speaks about this
[17:16] moses when he would bring the word of
[17:18] god had to put a veil over his face
[17:19] because the glory that was on his face
[17:22] was too much for the children of israel
[17:24] to behold they couldn't look to it and
[17:26] we're going to get to that scripture
[17:27] that paul refers to that in just a
[17:29] moment
[17:30] amen and and so it was countenance was
[17:32] so bright that they could not behold him
[17:34] so he had to veil his face so that he
[17:37] could speak to them the word of god
[17:39] and in the message the unveiling of god
[17:41] brother brahm says and today the veil of
[17:43] tradition hides the word again
[17:46] saying it's not so but it is so
[17:50] god is testifying of it blasting himself
[17:52] right out as bright as the sun before
[17:54] everyone and they fail to see it god be
[17:56] merciful to us
[17:58] in type moses coming from the presence
[18:00] of god with the word of god for that age
[18:02] now watch we're now in exodus 19 don't
[18:05] miss this now exodus 19 moses is coming
[18:07] from the presence of god or 20 21 19 20
[18:10] and 21 moses is coming from the presence
[18:13] of god he has been into the word the
[18:15] word has been wrote and he in the
[18:17] presence of god with the word he had the
[18:20] word for that age there is a word for
[18:22] each age and moses come forth his face
[18:25] shine so see the word was in him ready
[18:28] to be manifest give out to the people
[18:31] the true word god had wrote it and it
[18:33] was with moses notice it was with moses
[18:36] and moses was ready to be manifested he
[18:39] was the word to them
[18:42] moses he was the word to them
[18:45] he was the living word hid amen
[18:49] he was the living word head veiled
[18:51] himself moses had to put a veil over his
[18:54] own face why he was the word so why did
[18:58] moses have to put a veil over face
[18:59] because he was the word amen and in this
[19:02] station they could not handle the word
[19:04] of god they had to turn from that that's
[19:07] why his face shone with the glory of the
[19:09] lord because the word is light amen and
[19:12] the light was so bright coming from
[19:14] moses they couldn't handle it and he had
[19:16] to put a veil over his face
[19:19] moses put available versus why he was
[19:21] the word to them he was the living word
[19:24] hid oh i love that
[19:26] amen until the word was i'm sorry he was
[19:29] that word amen until that word was made
[19:32] known moses had to veil himself amen
[19:35] do you see it wherever the word is it's
[19:39] veiled
[19:41] moses had the word now remember after
[19:43] the word was made manifest moses was
[19:45] moses again see but while the word was
[19:48] in him to be give out he was god
[19:52] i'm going to read that again
[19:54] so that we don't miss it
[19:58] but
[19:59] while that word was in him to be give
[20:02] out
[20:02] he was god
[20:06] god is the word
[20:07] and moses had the word and when he was
[20:10] brought with the word to give out while
[20:12] the word was in him he was god
[20:15] well he wasn't moses no more he had the
[20:18] word of the lord for that age nothing
[20:20] could touch him until that was over he
[20:22] had that word with him so therefore when
[20:24] he come the people turned their heads
[20:26] they couldn't understand
[20:28] they couldn't comprehend what's going on
[20:30] they couldn't receive the word and it's
[20:32] purity coming straight from the mouth of
[20:34] god amen and god had thundered and spoke
[20:37] to them on the mountain and they
[20:38] couldn't handle the voice of god so they
[20:41] asked moses to go to god and get the
[20:43] word and come back when moses went and
[20:45] got the pure word of god when he came
[20:47] down he was so illuminated with this
[20:49] word he had the glory all over his face
[20:52] and they still turned they couldn't
[20:53] handle it even secondarily coming from
[20:55] moses god was going to speak directly to
[20:58] them they couldn't handle that so they
[21:00] wanted one to go get the word but when
[21:02] that one brought the same pure word from
[21:04] god they still couldn't handle it amen
[21:06] because they weren't ready to receive
[21:08] the word yet
[21:10] so they had to turn and moses was forced
[21:12] to veil his face for the people not for
[21:16] himself for the people
[21:19] because they couldn't understand what
[21:20] was happening
[21:21] amen let's go to second corinthians
[21:23] together and i went to this as a to lay
[21:26] a foundation to where we want to go to
[21:28] second corinthians chapter 3.
[21:33] ii corinthians chapter 3.
[21:41] and let's look at verse 6.
[21:45] ii corinthians 3 and 6
[21:47] who also have made us able ministers of
[21:50] the new testament not of the letter but
[21:52] of the spirit so a new testament
[21:54] minister ministers the spirit
[21:57] not the letter the spirit amen the
[22:00] correct ministry in this day will
[22:01] minister the spirit amen not just give
[22:04] words not just read and repeat but it's
[22:06] got to minister the spirit amen
[22:09] so he's made us able ministers so an
[22:11] able minister of the new testament will
[22:14] not minister in the letter but will
[22:15] minister in the spirit amen
[22:18] that's very important to know
[22:20] for the letter killeth but the spirit
[22:22] giveth life
[22:24] but of the ministration of death written
[22:26] and engraved in stone he's talking about
[22:28] the law the old testament but if the
[22:30] ministration of death written and
[22:31] engraved in stone was glorious so that
[22:34] the children of israel could not
[22:36] steadfastly behold the face of moses for
[22:38] the glory of his countenance which glory
[22:41] was to be done away because that word
[22:43] was to be done away when christ came
[22:47] how shall not the ministration of the
[22:49] spirit be rather glorious so if that was
[22:52] so glorious that they couldn't look onto
[22:54] moses face and that was a the ordinances
[22:57] that must pass away amen now there's
[23:00] coming one that's greater how much more
[23:02] glorious shall this one be
[23:05] amen
[23:07] for if the ministration verse 9 for the
[23:09] administration of condemnation be glory
[23:12] much more does the ministration of
[23:13] righteousness exceed in glory
[23:16] for even that which was made glorious
[23:18] had no glory in this respect by reason
[23:21] of the glory
[23:22] that excelleth for if that which is done
[23:24] away was glorious much more that which
[23:27] remaineth
[23:28] is glorious
[23:29] so now the new testament the the word
[23:32] amen is that in this day is more
[23:35] glorious
[23:37] brother our brother brahman goes on to
[23:38] say in the unveiling of god and i'll be
[23:40] reading quite a few quotes from the
[23:41] unveiling of god
[23:43] it says paul's speaking here now in this
[23:45] sense
[23:46] here now and in this sense the spirit
[23:48] word we are ministers not of the letter
[23:50] the law but able ministers of the spirit
[23:53] that the spirit takes the letter and
[23:55] manifests it
[23:56] that was just law you had to go look at
[23:58] and say thou shalt not commit adultery
[24:00] thou shalt not steal thou shalt not lie
[24:02] thou shalt not do this that or the other
[24:04] you had to look at that but this is
[24:06] spirit that comes upon the promised word
[24:08] for this age and brings forth and
[24:11] manifests not two tables of stone but
[24:14] the presence of the living god
[24:16] so this amen this ministration of the
[24:18] spirit was not to to bring another
[24:21] letter of the law for you to look at and
[24:23] say now don't commit adultery now don't
[24:26] steal now don't do that all of those
[24:28] things remain true we're not to steal
[24:30] we're not to commit adultery we're not
[24:31] to do all of that but now it was not
[24:34] bringing forth an ordinance a law but
[24:36] now ministering the spirit that will
[24:38] actually take the nature of god and live
[24:40] it amen not just say don't commit
[24:42] adultery and hold yourself back by a law
[24:45] but you don't commit adultery because
[24:46] the spirit is manifesting the life
[24:49] and so now the spirit comes upon the
[24:52] promised word for this age this is what
[24:54] brother bam is saying the spirit comes
[24:56] upon the promised word for this age and
[24:59] brings forth and manifests not two
[25:01] tables of stone but the presence of the
[25:04] living god
[25:06] amen so what are we looking for in this
[25:08] day not another ordinance amen the
[25:10] message is not a book of ordinances amen
[25:13] some people have taken the message as a
[25:15] book of ordinances and we can't do this
[25:17] because the prophet said we can't do
[25:18] that because the prophet said and all
[25:20] they've done is turned the prophet amen
[25:23] back they've taken the message and made
[25:25] another law out of it but this is the
[25:27] ministration of the spirit the very
[25:30] spirit of jesus christ being ministered
[25:32] in the message to come and live the very
[25:35] presence of god in our midst
[25:37] not it's to bring forth not two tables
[25:40] of
[25:40] stone praise be the god
[25:44] but not two tables of stone but the
[25:46] presence of the living god
[25:49] this is so much different than that amen
[25:52] so we don't want to take this glorious
[25:54] message and turn it back into ordinances
[25:57] amen what it is bringing is the spirit
[26:00] that will make us live everything the
[26:02] prophet of god said if he said god is
[26:04] not like this and god doesn't like this
[26:06] and god does like this we can try in our
[26:08] human effort to measure up to that in an
[26:10] old testament way of measuring up but
[26:12] that's still not it because that letter
[26:14] brought death amen not life but when you
[26:17] see that and receive the spirit of the
[26:19] one who spoke that now that spirit lives
[26:22] in you and if god doesn't like it you
[26:24] don't do it
[26:27] not by ordinances but by a life
[26:31] but the presence of the living god
[26:33] it's not bringing back two tables of
[26:35] stone but the spirit that comes upon the
[26:37] promised world for this age is bringing
[26:39] the presence of the living god
[26:42] not a mythical thought somebody made up
[26:44] or some houdini a trick but the very
[26:47] promise of god revealed and made
[26:49] manifest right before us what sort of
[26:51] veil will that be behind
[26:54] it's a good question
[26:56] maybe a short man from kentucky
[27:00] with a seventh grade education
[27:03] amen
[27:04] now he goes on and say what about this
[27:06] glory he's referring to what we read in
[27:08] second corinthians what about this glory
[27:11] if that was veiled by a natural veil
[27:14] this is veiled by a spiritual veil
[27:17] so we realize the word must always be
[27:19] veiled because the unbeliever cannot
[27:22] stand the glory of the word they cannot
[27:24] see it amen so it must be behind a veil
[27:27] then it was a natural veil behind the
[27:29] veil that was covering moses face then
[27:31] what moses spoke amen went in behind the
[27:34] veil in the tabernacle and was veiled by
[27:36] badger skins so it was always veiled
[27:38] amen because they could not behold it
[27:40] amen that was a natural veil but now
[27:43] it's veiled by a spiritual veil
[27:47] so don't try to look at a natural
[27:51] break into the spirit and see where
[27:53] you're at see what our we're living in
[27:56] does it make sense to you it's a
[27:58] spiritual veil that's over the people
[28:00] say i'm methodist i'm as good as anybody
[28:03] i'm baptist i'm pentecostal don't you
[28:05] realize that the thing is a tradition a
[28:08] traditional veil so what is the
[28:10] spiritual veil that's on the people a
[28:12] traditional veil the true denominational
[28:15] traditional veil is a spiritual veil
[28:18] that is hiding the word from the people
[28:23] do you realize that that thing is a
[28:24] traditional veil it's hiding god from
[28:26] you
[28:27] praise be to god
[28:29] so what's hiding god now the spiritual
[28:31] veil what is the spiritual veil a
[28:33] denominational traditional veil
[28:37] that's hiding god
[28:39] from you
[28:42] he goes on to say he is veiled with a
[28:44] natural veil before he could speak the
[28:46] word to the people referring to moses
[28:48] now god has to veil himself as he
[28:51] promised in human flesh
[28:53] god don't you get it
[28:55] god has to avail himself in human flesh
[28:58] and put a spiritual veil over them
[29:01] so now where is god hiding god now is
[29:03] hiding in human flesh and putting a
[29:06] spiritual veil over them so that they
[29:08] can't see it
[29:10] and listen what he says god has to veil
[29:11] himself in human flesh and put a
[29:12] spiritual veil over them say well i'm
[29:15] this and i'm that
[29:19] do you see what he injected there he put
[29:21] a spiritual veil over them say i'm this
[29:23] and i'm that what's the spiritual veil
[29:25] i'm methodist i'm pentecostal i'm of
[29:27] this persuasion i'm of this flavor of
[29:29] the word i'm of this flavor of the
[29:31] message
[29:33] i'm aligned with this doctrine and i'm
[29:35] of this teaching and i'm of apollos and
[29:37] i'm of paul and i'm of cephas
[29:41] put a spiritual veil
[29:43] over them say well i'm of this and i'm
[29:45] of that
[29:46] in in order to speak to the people so
[29:50] god has to allow the spiritual veil so
[29:52] that he could speak to the people
[29:54] so he could speak through moses he had
[29:56] to come moses had to be veiled so god
[29:59] could bring or most god could bring the
[30:00] word through moses to the people it had
[30:02] to be veiled and so god could bring the
[30:04] word in this day he has to be hid in
[30:06] human flesh and put a spiritual veil
[30:09] over the people that they take their
[30:11] religious ideas and their camps and then
[30:14] in their different denomination and
[30:16] that's a spiritual veil so that they
[30:17] can't see god because god is hidden
[30:19] flesh
[30:22] now let's go on here in
[30:25] uh
[30:26] second corinthians let's continue second
[30:28] corinthians chapter three we'll go to
[30:30] verse 12 now
[30:32] seeing then that we have such hope we
[30:34] use great plainness of speech
[30:37] and not as moses which put a veil over
[30:39] his face that the children of israel
[30:41] could not steadfastly look to the end of
[30:43] that which is abolished
[30:45] now i want you to stop for a minute and
[30:47] we're going to have to go slow to
[30:49] understand the scripture
[30:52] and he says we use great plainness of
[30:54] speech
[30:57] not as moses which put a veil over his
[30:59] face
[31:00] that the children of israel could not
[31:02] steadfastly look to the end
[31:04] of that which was abolished
[31:07] moses had to cover his face
[31:11] so that the children could not look and
[31:13] see
[31:14] the end of the law
[31:19] so what was the end of the law
[31:21] it was what was hidden behind the veil
[31:25] what was hidden behind the veil
[31:27] the word in a
[31:30] man that's what this scripture is saying
[31:34] let's read it again with understanding
[31:36] and not as moses which put a veil over
[31:38] his face that the children of israel
[31:40] could not steadfastly look to the end of
[31:42] that which was abolished
[31:44] they couldn't see the glory of god in a
[31:47] human vessel he had developed so they
[31:49] couldn't see the end of the law would be
[31:52] god and a man
[31:56] praise god don't you love the bible
[32:00] but their mind now look at what he says
[32:03] but their minds were blinded
[32:06] their minds were blinded
[32:09] for unto this day remain at the same
[32:12] veil
[32:13] untaken away in the reading of the old
[32:15] testament which veil is done away in
[32:19] christ
[32:20] now their minds are blinded because unto
[32:22] this day the same veil remains there not
[32:26] a piece of cloth over moses face but the
[32:29] same thing that's causing them not to
[32:31] see god in a man now they couldn't see
[32:33] god in jesus christ god in the form of
[32:35] his sign now there was another veil they
[32:38] were blinded in their minds the same
[32:40] veil was there in the reading of moses
[32:41] he said brother jesus says you you read
[32:44] moses if you would have believed moses
[32:45] you would believe in me for moses spoke
[32:47] of me this is the end of that which is
[32:49] being abolished
[32:53] verse 14 but their minds were blinded
[32:56] for unto this day remain at the same
[32:57] veil untaken away in the reading of the
[32:59] old testament which veil is done away in
[33:02] christ
[33:03] but even unto this day when moses is
[33:05] read the veil is upon their heart
[33:09] this is now a spiritual veil
[33:13] what gave them a spiritual veil their
[33:15] tradition
[33:16] their traditional understanding of the
[33:19] word became a spiritual veil that was on
[33:21] their heart because jesus christ amen
[33:24] was the the end of the law he was the
[33:26] end of the law amen and they could not
[33:29] look at moses and see the end of the law
[33:31] but here comes jesus christ the end of
[33:33] the law god manifest and flesh and now
[33:37] they couldn't see it but jesus had no
[33:39] piece of cloth over his face he had
[33:41] nothing over his face because now the
[33:44] veil was on their heart because they had
[33:45] already adapted a traditional
[33:47] understanding of what moses brought when
[33:49] moses brought it pure he was the word
[33:52] and he had to hide his face because they
[33:54] couldn't handle the pure word but once
[33:57] the tradition set in now it becomes a
[33:59] spiritual veil in their heart because of
[34:02] traditional teaching of the word
[34:05] and now jesus didn't have to cover his
[34:07] face even though we could behold the
[34:09] glory of the lord in the face of jesus
[34:11] christ amen but they couldn't behold it
[34:13] because of the veil over the heart
[34:16] because their minds were blinded
[34:19] see how powerful a traditional veil is
[34:27] amen
[34:29] but even unto this day when moses is
[34:31] read the veil is upon their heart
[34:33] nevertheless when that shall be turned
[34:35] to the lord
[34:36] the veil shall be taken away
[34:41] brother brahm says in the unveiling of
[34:42] god moses was the veil the living word
[34:44] of god veiled behind human flesh the
[34:48] pillar of fire was in moses of course
[34:52] speaking what was to be veiled later
[34:54] behind skins you see
[34:56] now that the word the word was brought
[34:58] forth then it was written out then it
[35:00] was put behind and still veiled for god
[35:03] was always in that word amen he is the
[35:06] he's the word always he was in that word
[35:08] that's the reason that the word had to
[35:10] be veiled oh brother sister are you
[35:12] catching it look don't you see it's been
[35:15] veiled through these ages according to
[35:16] what god said and it will be opened in
[35:19] the last days those seven seals would be
[35:22] broke and the full thing would come into
[35:24] view of the people that took place all
[35:26] along the hour of the seventh angel's
[35:28] message all the mysteries of god should
[35:30] be made known in that elijah this last
[35:34] hour
[35:35] how that christ is put out of his church
[35:38] the son of god now he is he is revealed
[35:41] as son of man again how that the church
[35:43] is to be put in order in everything for
[35:45] the last day no creed no denomination
[35:49] just absolutely the word living in the
[35:51] individual
[35:53] so what is it to put the church in order
[35:54] in the last days you go past the creed
[35:57] no denomination no church system it is
[36:00] god in the individual
[36:03] absolutely the word living in the
[36:05] individual that's what's to take place
[36:08] amen it's been veiled through these ages
[36:12] but it's to be open in the last days
[36:13] when those seals open
[36:16] and it would come into the full the
[36:17] thing full thing would come into the
[36:19] view of the people what's taken place
[36:20] all along
[36:22] and the hour of the seventh angels
[36:23] message all the mystery of god should be
[36:25] made known in that elijah the last hour
[36:29] praise be to god
[36:31] what's to be made known
[36:33] what is to be seen
[36:35] what is the results
[36:37] just absolutely the word living in the
[36:39] individual
[36:43] remember wherever the word is it must be
[36:45] veiled
[36:47] it was veiled behind badger skins it was
[36:49] veiled behind moses and now it's veiled
[36:52] in human flesh
[36:55] let's go on and read in our scripture
[36:59] let's read verse 16 again
[37:01] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[37:03] lord
[37:04] the veil shall be taken away
[37:07] now the lord is that spirit and where
[37:09] the spirit of the lord is there is
[37:10] liberty
[37:12] but we all with open faith
[37:14] now stop reading
[37:16] open face means unveiled face
[37:19] so we with an unveiled face
[37:23] so but we all with open face
[37:26] beholding as in a glass
[37:29] the glory of the lord
[37:31] let's read this slowly
[37:34] but we all
[37:35] with an unveiled face
[37:37] what unveiled our face
[37:39] the message of the hour
[37:41] the opening of the seals
[37:43] that last angel's message
[37:45] we all with open face beholding us in a
[37:48] glass a glass is a mirror
[37:51] now what do you see when you look in a
[37:53] mirror
[37:56] i want to ask you every one of you
[37:57] stopped for a minute when you look into
[37:59] the mirror
[38:01] who do you see
[38:04] you see the person next to you
[38:07] the person over when you look into a
[38:09] mirror you see your own reflection
[38:12] every one of us when we look into a
[38:14] mirror we see our own
[38:16] reflection now read this carefully
[38:20] but we all with open face
[38:22] beholding is in a mirror
[38:25] the glory
[38:27] of the lord
[38:30] when you look into this mirror
[38:34] with an open face
[38:36] before you could look into the mirror of
[38:38] the word and you see bible stories
[38:41] you can look into the mirror of the word
[38:43] and you say jesus christ you look into
[38:45] the mirror of the word you can even see
[38:47] that there's a malachi for prophet you
[38:48] can look into the word of the lord and
[38:50] you can see seven thunders amen but when
[38:52] you have an open face
[38:55] when you have an open face when the veil
[38:58] has been taken off of you amen when you
[39:01] become unveiled when you are unsealed
[39:04] when the veil is removed from your face
[39:06] and you look into this mirror you see
[39:09] the glory of the lord where does the
[39:11] glory of the lord appear the same place
[39:14] that appeared in moses amen it was on
[39:16] his face
[39:18] why because he was the word and when the
[39:20] word was with him he was god to the
[39:22] people
[39:24] and now the apostle paul is taking that
[39:26] type all the way here in second
[39:28] corinthians he's pulling it all through
[39:29] and now he's showing you amen now we
[39:32] with an open face an unveiled face when
[39:36] we look into this mirror we can see the
[39:38] glory of the lord
[39:40] [Music]
[39:43] listen as in a glass the glory of the
[39:45] lord
[39:46] are changed
[39:49] into the same image
[39:51] from glory to glory
[39:54] even as by the spirit of the lord
[39:57] look at the challenge of the scripture
[40:00] we with an open face be holding us in a
[40:02] mirror the glory of the lord
[40:04] are changed into the same image from
[40:06] glory to glory
[40:09] amen you say i want to be more like
[40:11] jesus christ you never will until first
[40:14] you have an open face and you look into
[40:16] this mirror and you see the glory of the
[40:18] lord looking back at you and then what
[40:20] you see by revelation you will become
[40:22] what you see and if you don't see it you
[40:25] won't become it
[40:27] you must first see the glory of the lord
[40:29] in the mirror with an open face and then
[40:31] you're changed into the image you behold
[40:34] from glory to glory
[40:37] this is why without the revelation of
[40:39] the seven seals amen the bride was never
[40:42] coming to a full maturity to reflect
[40:44] back jesus christ on this earth it took
[40:46] something that would take the veil off
[40:48] of the bride the veil off of the church
[40:51] and when they took the veil off she
[40:52] could look into the word and when she
[40:54] looked into the word she could see the
[40:55] glory of the lord reflecting off of her
[40:58] and when she saw the glory of the lord
[40:59] reflecting off of her then she had the
[41:02] power to be changed into what she was
[41:03] looking at
[41:05] so without revelation there is no growth
[41:08] without revelation there is no change
[41:10] without revelation without the opening
[41:12] of the seals and god revealing it
[41:14] personally to you you can see god amen
[41:17] manifesting moses that's wonderful you
[41:19] can see god manifest in the fulfillment
[41:22] of malachi 4 and brother branham that's
[41:24] wonderful you can say god is in his
[41:26] bride that's wonderful but unless the
[41:28] veil is taken off of your face and you
[41:31] personally as an individual look into
[41:33] the mirror of this word and see the
[41:35] glory of god if you don't see that you
[41:37] will never be changed into the image of
[41:39] the glory of god
[41:41] it'll never happen amen it doesn't
[41:43] happen by saying all these people are
[41:45] god all those people are god and the
[41:47] veil's been taken off by face and i see
[41:49] malachi 4.
[41:53] the veil
[41:55] is not just to be taken off of malachi
[41:57] 4.
[41:58] but the veil is to be taken off of
[42:01] the veil is to be removed from your face
[42:04] not just brother banner's face but your
[42:06] faith it's not that just god reveals to
[42:08] you who malachi 4 was who the elijah
[42:10] ministry was who the seventh angel was
[42:12] you can see all of that and you can
[42:14] still be blind you can read the word you
[42:17] can read about malachi 4. you can read
[42:19] revelation 10 7 you can read you can
[42:21] read you can even read amen revelation
[42:24] 10 8-11 and say yep the bride will
[42:26] prophesy though shall eat the book again
[42:28] but unless you see yourself there in
[42:30] revelations 10 8 unless that's you
[42:33] standing there going to the angel to
[42:35] take the book then you'll never become
[42:37] what you're looking at
[42:41] we can want to change and want to change
[42:43] and want to be different and want to be
[42:44] changed but you'll never change until
[42:47] you see in the mirror the glory of the
[42:50] lord
[42:52] you look at the word and if you look at
[42:54] the word and if it's reflecting
[42:56] everybody else to you keep looking till
[42:58] you see yourself amen keep looking till
[43:01] you see you in the word till you see
[43:03] this prophecies about me this story is
[43:05] about me when i read the woman at the
[43:07] well that's me amen
[43:10] i was in tradition i was going back to
[43:12] the well that my father's dug i was
[43:14] carrying my man-made pot amen so i could
[43:16] dip a little more water out of the well
[43:18] going back to the pentecostal church
[43:20] just to get a little bit more just
[43:22] enough for another day supply
[43:27] where did i and she had a question this
[43:29] is what my denomination teaches but the
[43:32] jewish denomination teaches you worship
[43:34] over there i'm going back to where my
[43:36] father's dug to well i'm going back to
[43:37] the place of my father's this is
[43:39] denominationalism
[43:41] she's taking her little man-made pot and
[43:43] scooping up a little more water just to
[43:45] get another another little bit for
[43:48] another day
[43:50] but jesus says i had needs to go by
[43:52] samaria i'm gonna free that little woman
[43:56] and when she comes in contact with god
[43:58] god begins to reveal her situation to
[43:59] her amen and she says i perceive you're
[44:02] a prophet
[44:04] amen when the same thing was done before
[44:07] the pharisees they thought he was
[44:08] beelzebub she thought he was a prophet
[44:13] and he says
[44:15] she says i perceive you're a prophet
[44:19] now the jews say we have to worship and
[44:22] as soon as she found out she's standing
[44:24] with a prophet she wants to know where
[44:25] to worship god
[44:27] and how to worship god she wants to know
[44:29] how do i worship god and when he begins
[44:32] to reveal it to her amen reveals that
[44:34] he's the messiah she leaves her water
[44:36] pot
[44:38] she's not gonna need this no more
[44:40] because jesus said if you drink from me
[44:42] amen out of your belly will flow you'll
[44:44] be a living well water will spring up
[44:47] you don't need the man-made pot you
[44:48] don't need the man-made dug well you
[44:50] don't need denominations anymore when
[44:52] you come in contact with jesus christ
[44:54] and drink from that well there's
[44:56] something springing up in you amen
[44:58] living water living water of life that
[45:01] never runs out you don't need the
[45:02] man-made well you don't need the
[45:04] man-made system you don't need the
[45:05] man-made pot to carry it you become the
[45:08] well you become the water source you
[45:11] become the fountain of living water
[45:14] now she didn't need to know about
[45:15] jerusalem she didn't need to know about
[45:17] samaria all she needed to know she found
[45:20] in jesus christ and what did she find
[45:22] she found that she was the will
[45:27] when i look at that story it's not about
[45:29] a woman in samaria that's me
[45:33] that's i see myself when the veil's
[45:35] taken off that's me
[45:38] i'm right there
[45:39] i'm in revelation 10 8 to 11.
[45:43] i
[45:44] i'm there i'm all the way in revelation
[45:46] 22 17 and the spirit and the bride said
[45:48] come i'm there that's me why the seals
[45:51] the opening of the seals opened the seal
[45:53] of my life and took the veil from all my
[45:56] face and when i see the word i saw now
[45:59] in the mirror
[46:00] the glory of the lord
[46:03] where's the glory of the lord
[46:05] it's reflected in human flesh
[46:07] it's veiled it's hidden in human flesh
[46:09] and you can't see it till the veil is
[46:11] taken off of your face so you can see
[46:14] the glory of the lord
[46:17] and when that happens
[46:20] you're changed
[46:22] into the same image
[46:24] from glory to glory
[46:26] even it's by the spirit of the lord
[46:29] you see why denomination level the
[46:31] denominations could never produce this
[46:34] this is why partial belief can never
[46:38] produce this kind of life because you
[46:40] have to have something there has to be a
[46:43] revelation that will take the veil off
[46:46] of your own face
[46:48] as an individual that god will unveil
[46:51] you
[46:52] and when you look at the word amen you
[46:54] look into the mirror you see the glory
[46:57] of the lord in you and when you see that
[47:00] then you're changed into what you see so
[47:03] what's that mean you're changed into the
[47:05] revelation of who you are and when you
[47:08] catch the revelation of who you are
[47:10] you're changed into the image you're
[47:12] beholding by glory from glory unto glory
[47:17] without this revelation
[47:19] we're going nowhere
[47:22] without god personally revealing it to
[47:24] you amen we're going nowhere we're going
[47:26] to stay in the same run going around the
[47:28] same stump
[47:29] trying to solve the same problems never
[47:32] rising one bit higher because you're not
[47:34] going to get any higher than what you
[47:36] see in this mirror
[47:40] he said my life is going nowhere i keep
[47:42] going through the same ruts i keep going
[47:44] through the same problems i say get back
[47:46] into the message and pray for revelation
[47:48] say god i've got to see with an unveiled
[47:50] face what's looking at me in this mirror
[47:52] amen because without that i will never
[47:55] grow into the image of jesus christ
[47:57] until i see in the word jesus christ in
[47:59] me
[48:00] and when i see christ in me then
[48:02] whatever i see i will become
[48:06] it's a revelation friends
[48:10] that's why it's not more works
[48:13] more effort
[48:16] more trying harder
[48:18] more trying harder just means you get
[48:19] more tired
[48:22] and trying harder just usually means you
[48:24] fall harder
[48:25] because you hold out you hold out you
[48:27] hold out hold on strength until you have
[48:28] no strength left and then you crash and
[48:30] burn amen this is not the age for
[48:32] man-made religion for your own works
[48:35] amen this is god give a revelation so
[48:37] that we could see clearly with an
[48:39] unveiled face with a picture that's
[48:41] looking back in the mirror of god's word
[48:43] and we look back and we see jesus christ
[48:45] is hiding in flesh not over there not
[48:48] over there not over there but right here
[48:50] jesus christ is hiding in flesh
[48:53] and when i can see that i can be changed
[48:56] into that image
[48:57] from glory
[48:59] unto glory
[49:01] until you get that revelation you're
[49:02] going nowhere you're spinning your
[49:03] wheels in the mud
[49:05] hitting the gas trying harder forward
[49:07] back we're trying to get unstuck but
[49:09] what will unstuck the believer is a pure
[49:11] revelation of the word
[49:14] that's why chasing all kinds of things
[49:16] will never produce anything in our life
[49:18] we got to get to this word and say god
[49:20] show me your word clearly i want to see
[49:22] it in all its truth and all of its power
[49:24] and all of its clarity because it's the
[49:26] only hope we have for overcoming
[49:31] brother bam says
[49:32] in order to do this
[49:34] our denominational traditional veils
[49:37] must be broke
[49:42] in order to do this our denominational
[49:44] traditional veils must be broke by god's
[49:46] spirit of fire and sword which is his
[49:49] word
[49:51] what's going to rip the denominational
[49:53] traditional veil from us the word
[49:56] when we when we stay in that word and
[49:58] feed on that word and receive that word
[50:00] that word will remove the traditional
[50:03] denominational veil
[50:06] listen the the denominational veil does
[50:08] not go away because you attend a message
[50:10] church
[50:12] the traditional veil does not go away
[50:14] because you walk in those doors and sit
[50:16] in these pews it does not go away
[50:18] because you play a tape it goes away
[50:20] when the word is revealed to you and the
[50:22] word begins to tear away the tradition
[50:26] amen we can sit in something and repeat
[50:28] amen we can repeat phrases we can repeat
[50:31] catch phrases we can repeat what we're
[50:32] heard but it takes a genuine revelation
[50:35] by the holy ghost to come with a sword
[50:37] and rip that traditional fail and pull
[50:39] it away from your face so that you can
[50:41] see yourself in the lord
[50:48] he says always his word is a sword
[50:51] he took his sword that day full of fire
[50:53] and ripped that veil from top to bottom
[50:55] he does the same thing with the same
[50:57] word today not my creed my book of
[50:59] creeds my catechism but the sword of the
[51:02] lord see rips the veil down and you see
[51:04] god standing in plain view manifested in
[51:07] his word what a glorious view to look at
[51:10] see all right god's holy spirit and fire
[51:13] his sword rips it the word rips the
[51:15] denominational veil
[51:17] that's why we've got to stay in this
[51:19] word feed on this word i'll tell you
[51:22] sunday and wednesday is not enough word
[51:24] to overcome
[51:26] amen
[51:27] god that this is what this is this is
[51:30] the way we've been structured the
[51:31] prophet structured us this way we come
[51:33] here to hear the word of god preach
[51:35] because it's god's method and it's god's
[51:37] highest order of communication between
[51:39] god and man is the preaching of the word
[51:40] amen but you need this word every day to
[51:43] keep this traditional veil tore off of
[51:45] you if not you'll sleep slip back into
[51:47] spiritual amnesia forgetting who you are
[51:49] temporarily
[51:52] but we've got to stay in this word and
[51:54] let that sword continually keep the
[51:56] traditional mindset away from us it's so
[51:59] easy to slip back into traditional
[52:01] christian teaching
[52:05] and it's bringing blindness
[52:07] let's look at first corinthians 13
[52:09] together
[52:12] first corinthians chapter 13.
[52:24] first corinthians 13
[52:26] let's read verse 10
[52:30] but when that which is perfect has come
[52:33] then that which is in part shall be done
[52:35] away
[52:36] when i was a child i spake as a child
[52:39] i understood as a child i thought as a
[52:41] child but when i became a man i put away
[52:44] childish things so this is all about
[52:46] maturity
[52:48] this is all about growing up
[52:50] coming to full age into maturity
[52:54] so this
[52:55] that which is perfect has come that
[52:57] which is in part shall be done away and
[53:00] as soon as he talks about the part done
[53:01] away when that which is perfect perfect
[53:03] means complete or whole or fully mature
[53:06] then he goes right into when i was a
[53:07] child i spake as a child i thought as a
[53:09] child but when i became a man when i
[53:11] became perfect full age adoption age
[53:16] i put away all those childish things
[53:19] now look at what he says for now we see
[53:21] through a glass this word glasses mirror
[53:24] so now we see through a mirror
[53:26] darkly now listen to what this word
[53:29] darkly means
[53:31] the greek word is i enigma
[53:34] and it means an obscure saying
[53:36] an enigma
[53:38] a riddle
[53:40] or a mystery
[53:43] an obscure saying
[53:45] it
[53:46] an obscure thing
[53:47] it's obscure it's not clear it's like a
[53:51] riddle you can't decipher it and look
[53:53] what he says for now we see through a
[53:55] mirror darkly you're looking in the
[53:57] mirror but it's obscure you can't get
[54:00] the right image in the mirror and i ask
[54:02] you again when you look at a mirror what
[54:04] are you looking at
[54:06] you're looking at yourself so now we
[54:08] look into a mirror but it's it's a
[54:11] mystery it's a riddle it's an enigma
[54:13] it's obscure you can't make out what
[54:15] you're looking at in the mirror
[54:18] for now we see through a mirror darkly
[54:22] but then face to face because when you
[54:24] look at a mirror you look face to face
[54:28] now i know in part but then shall i know
[54:32] even as also i am known
[54:36] i'd ask you how well are you known
[54:39] you're known very well by the father
[54:43] but
[54:44] now we see through a glass darkly but
[54:46] then face to face now i know in part but
[54:49] then shall i know even as also i am
[54:51] known
[54:52] and now abideth faith hope charity these
[54:54] three but the greatest of these
[54:56] is charity
[54:58] this is what brother branham says in
[54:59] questions and answers in 1964 he quotes
[55:02] this scripture he says first corinthians
[55:04] 13 says when that which is perfect he's
[55:06] come
[55:08] that which is in part shall be done away
[55:09] with
[55:10] so all these little things of jumping up
[55:12] and down like a kid trying to talk in
[55:14] tongues and all these other things when
[55:16] that which is perfect and we do have
[55:19] today
[55:22] we do have today by god's help the
[55:24] perfect interpretation of the word with
[55:27] divine vindication
[55:29] amen this is not the day of partial amen
[55:32] this is not the day of childish day this
[55:34] is the day of full maturity because the
[55:36] word has come to full maturity the word
[55:38] has come to full light the word has been
[55:40] fully unveiled amen unsealed it's fully
[55:43] open now now is not the day of darkness
[55:46] now the day of light now is not the day
[55:48] of obscurity but now is the day of full
[55:50] revelation full light full
[55:54] everything
[55:56] and we do have today by god's help the
[55:58] perfect interpretation of the word with
[55:59] divine vindication then that which is in
[56:02] part is done away with when i was a
[56:04] child i spake as a child i understood as
[56:06] a child but when i become a man i put
[56:09] away childish things
[56:11] so we live in the day
[56:14] of the perfect word
[56:17] is that what he said
[56:19] and so now we see through a glass darkly
[56:22] but then face to face
[56:24] now we live in the day where the mirror
[56:28] is not murky anymore
[56:32] the glass is not dark anymore now we can
[56:36] see
[56:37] face to face
[56:40] and when we look in the mirror what
[56:42] should we see
[56:43] the glory of the lord
[56:45] and when we see the glory of the lord in
[56:48] the mirror of the word where will that
[56:50] glory be hidden in flesh
[56:54] the most unlikely flesh
[56:57] to us
[56:59] none of us thought you know growing up
[57:01] those especially those who did not grow
[57:03] up in the message and never heard these
[57:04] kind of terms and these things before
[57:06] you grew up nobody was walking around
[57:08] and saying one day i'm gonna find god in
[57:10] me
[57:13] one day i'll see god in my face
[57:16] amen it took the message to peel that
[57:19] veil away so that we could see the word
[57:21] and in the word you could find out that
[57:22] god always wanted to live in flesh amen
[57:25] he wanted to be manifest in flesh he
[57:27] wanted to dwell in his people amen
[57:30] then you can see that one day you're
[57:32] going to find god and where are you
[57:33] going to find him you're going to find
[57:34] him in you amen because there was a seed
[57:36] gene of god laying in your soul from
[57:38] before the foundation of the world then
[57:40] when you come in contact with the living
[57:41] word for your age it'll quicken that
[57:43] seed to life and you'll look back into
[57:45] the word again and you'll say that
[57:47] that's that's me that's me the woman in
[57:49] samaria is me amen revelation 10 8
[57:51] that's me
[57:53] he wasn't talking about another age or
[57:55] another people are somewhere far away he
[57:57] was talking about me this individual
[57:58] right here is going to flesh out that
[58:00] word right there
[58:02] [Music]
[58:03] amen what did it the revelation of the
[58:06] word took the veil off of our face so
[58:08] that we could see the glory of the lord
[58:11] and if we can see that we can be changed
[58:14] into what we behold
[58:16] from glory unto glory unto glory all the
[58:20] way till this flesh changes
[58:22] into perfection as well
[58:26] praise be to god
[58:29] brother branham he tells a story
[58:32] here in this message that i want to go
[58:34] through in the message of prisoner from
[58:35] 1963
[58:37] he says i preached some time ago at a
[58:39] businessman meeting in phoenix arizona
[58:42] of the reflection of jesus reflecting
[58:44] christ christian life
[58:46] i said i was born up here in kentucky
[58:49] where it's very primitive especially
[58:51] back when i was a kid
[58:53] and this certain little boy never had a
[58:55] home like we have here
[58:57] where we we had so many pretty ladies
[58:59] that have to look through mirrors all
[59:01] through the house to keep their hair
[59:02] just in place and so forth but he had
[59:04] one little mirror just a little piece
[59:06] tacked on a tree on the outside where
[59:09] the wasp bench was where his mother and
[59:10] father washed and they combed their hair
[59:12] and so forth from this little piece of
[59:14] an old mirror tacked on a tree
[59:17] and he says frankly that's the type of
[59:19] home that we live we have
[59:21] anybody wants to see a mirror we kids we
[59:24] had to get a box and get up on the wash
[59:25] bench he's talking about when he grew up
[59:27] as a little boy
[59:28] if we wanted to see in the mirror we had
[59:30] to get a box and get up on the old wash
[59:32] bench and look in this piece of a mirror
[59:34] that i picked up myself in a dump
[59:37] that wasn't down in kentucky that's here
[59:39] in indiana up on utica pike here
[59:43] brother ma'am he was talking about this
[59:45] little boy in kentucky and he was typing
[59:46] it with his own life and boy in kentucky
[59:48] he didn't ever have a proper mirror he
[59:50] just had a little one tacked up on a
[59:51] tree and brother branham describes this
[59:53] mirror he said it was like what he had
[59:55] and he describes his childhood and he
[59:57] says here he picked it up in a dump just
[59:59] a little piece of a broken mirror
[1:00:02] and they would nail it to a tree and
[1:00:04] bend the nails over to hold it so there
[1:00:06] was a little piece of broken mirror on
[1:00:09] on a tree
[1:00:10] and they couldn't see it at the little
[1:00:12] kids unless they got a box and got up on
[1:00:13] the wash bench and the bench was
[1:00:15] attached to an apple tree he said with a
[1:00:17] leg on one side and dad would fill it
[1:00:19] with wash water and he'd wash up before
[1:00:21] he went in the house and he would look
[1:00:22] in that little mirror and comb his hair
[1:00:24] and mom would comb her hair
[1:00:26] and just a little piece of broken mirror
[1:00:27] he got out of the dumb he said if us
[1:00:29] kids wanted to see in it we had to climb
[1:00:31] up to look inside
[1:00:34] but he goes on with the story he says
[1:00:36] now this little kid had never exactly
[1:00:39] seen himself like that
[1:00:42] so he come to the city to visit his
[1:00:44] grandma
[1:00:46] it's an it's a it's on the tour of the
[1:00:48] room that grandma had a house that he
[1:00:49] had a that had a complete mirror on the
[1:00:52] door
[1:00:53] i want you to catch that phrase a
[1:00:55] complete
[1:00:56] mirror
[1:00:57] on the door
[1:00:59] and so a little boy running through the
[1:01:01] room seen another little boy in front of
[1:01:03] him
[1:01:03] and the little boy was running also so
[1:01:05] he thought he should stop a few minutes
[1:01:08] and see what that little lad was going
[1:01:09] to do and when he stopped the little boy
[1:01:11] stopped when he turned his head the
[1:01:13] little boy turned his head he scratched
[1:01:15] his head the little boy scratched says
[1:01:16] finally walking closer to investigate
[1:01:18] and he turned around and his mother
[1:01:20] watching him and his grandmother with
[1:01:21] amazement said why mother that's me
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:28] brother branham remember what i talked
[1:01:29] to uh last week amen that these aren't
[1:01:32] stories these are parables
[1:01:34] brother branham preaches the same way
[1:01:36] jesus preached amen and when jesus
[1:01:38] preached he would start to tell stories
[1:01:40] about a man who had two sons and this
[1:01:43] one had a field and he lent it out and
[1:01:45] he starts telling these stories and
[1:01:46] these stories are parables and brother
[1:01:48] branham teaches he preaches the same way
[1:01:50] jesus christ preached
[1:01:52] and now he's telling us this little boy
[1:01:54] all he had was a piece of broken mirror
[1:01:56] you know how broken mirror is you know
[1:01:57] it's not steady on the edges and so it's
[1:01:59] a little distorting the edges maybe a
[1:02:01] crack running through it if you want to
[1:02:02] comb your hair you kind of have to move
[1:02:04] your head you can't even see you can
[1:02:06] only see so much of yourself you
[1:02:08] probably can't even see your whole
[1:02:09] hairline amen until you move your head a
[1:02:12] little bit and make sure that the left
[1:02:13] and the right side is okay all right
[1:02:15] we're okay and we move on if a little
[1:02:17] boy wanted to see anything he had to get
[1:02:19] a box and climb up and just peek up into
[1:02:21] it and he might see a little bit of his
[1:02:23] face or all of his face who knows how
[1:02:25] much amen but but this little boy who
[1:02:28] can only see so much of himself listen
[1:02:31] that little broken mirror is
[1:02:32] denominational traditional ideas it's
[1:02:35] only a little view of the word amen
[1:02:37] luther had a little view of the word
[1:02:39] wesley had a little view of the word
[1:02:41] pentecost had a little view of the word
[1:02:43] why because the nomination that came and
[1:02:45] broke up the word
[1:02:47] and they each grabbed a piece of broken
[1:02:49] mirror and they could only see a little
[1:02:51] bit in this mirror but this little boy
[1:02:53] when he went on a journey amen he come
[1:02:55] to a place that had a complete mirror
[1:02:58] and i want to tell you that there's a
[1:03:00] complete mirror that's been restored at
[1:03:02] the end of the ages this message has
[1:03:04] brought a complete full length perfect
[1:03:07] mirror no cracks no missing pieces amen
[1:03:10] it's all been put back together and made
[1:03:12] perfect and i'll tell you what else this
[1:03:14] mirror is not distorted
[1:03:17] it's not bent on the edges it's not
[1:03:18] twisted it's not flex amen it doesn't
[1:03:20] give you back a funny view of yourself
[1:03:22] you know if somebody takes the word and
[1:03:24] they bend it and they take this mirror
[1:03:26] and they bend it amen you'll get an odd
[1:03:28] reflection of yourself and you'll walk
[1:03:30] away horrified
[1:03:32] because you're three foot tall and 500
[1:03:34] pounds
[1:03:38] that's what man does to the word
[1:03:41] and when you look into man's broken
[1:03:43] piece of the word in man's distorted
[1:03:46] word amen it always gives you the wrong
[1:03:48] picture of yourself
[1:03:50] you either can't see all of yourself or
[1:03:52] what you see is twisted up and distorted
[1:03:55] until you walk away with the wrong view
[1:03:57] of who you are
[1:04:01] but in this day we've got a complete
[1:04:03] mirror a perfect mirror a perfect word
[1:04:05] by god's grace we have a perfect
[1:04:07] interpretation of the word with divine
[1:04:09] vindication the word has been restored
[1:04:11] and now you can stand in front of that
[1:04:12] mirror and know what god's idea was of
[1:04:15] you before the foundation of the world
[1:04:17] how he wants you to live how he wants
[1:04:18] you to dress how he wants you to speak
[1:04:20] how he wants you to talk what the
[1:04:22] reflection of jesus christ in a female
[1:04:24] form should look like because the word
[1:04:26] has been restored
[1:04:28] and when you look in that you see
[1:04:30] yourself the way god wants you to look
[1:04:32] the way god sees you and when you see
[1:04:35] that you can be changed into that image
[1:04:37] from glory and to glory by the spirit of
[1:04:41] the lord
[1:04:42] not by might
[1:04:43] not by power but by my spirit
[1:04:46] but you'll never be changed into that
[1:04:48] image until you get in front of the
[1:04:50] mirror
[1:04:52] the full mirror
[1:04:55] listen i don't want to hurt anybody's
[1:04:57] feelings
[1:04:58] but if you have stopped at malachi 4
[1:05:00] you're not standing in front of the
[1:05:01] complete mirror
[1:05:05] because you can see him but you can't
[1:05:07] see yourself
[1:05:09] and he came so that you could see
[1:05:11] yourself
[1:05:13] he had to come to restore the word
[1:05:16] so that the mirror would be brought back
[1:05:18] so that you could see yourself in the
[1:05:20] word so that you could become what you
[1:05:23] see
[1:05:26] this message is so vitally critical
[1:05:29] there is no other way than this message
[1:05:32] to please god in this day
[1:05:34] there is no other way to be formed into
[1:05:36] the image of christ there is no other
[1:05:38] way to be a proper christian outside of
[1:05:40] this word that has been restored
[1:05:42] everything else is a distorted view
[1:05:44] everything else is a partial view a
[1:05:46] broken view a distorted view this
[1:05:48] message is the only perfect word it's
[1:05:50] the only correct view it's the only
[1:05:52] thing that will unveil your face give
[1:05:54] you the right image of the way god sees
[1:05:56] you and give you the power to become
[1:05:58] what you're looking at
[1:06:00] there will be no other way to rise any
[1:06:03] higher than your ability to see what god
[1:06:06] sees in you
[1:06:09] because when we're changed by what we
[1:06:11] behold we're changed into the image we
[1:06:13] behold
[1:06:14] so if you're looking at a partial image
[1:06:16] you're only going to have a partial life
[1:06:18] if you're looking at a distorted image
[1:06:19] you'll always have a distorted life but
[1:06:21] the only way to have a full perfect life
[1:06:23] is to have a full perfect image you
[1:06:25] can't have a full perfect image without
[1:06:26] a full perfect word
[1:06:30] so there is no way in this day
[1:06:33] to live a christian life without this
[1:06:35] message
[1:06:37] and then you're changed the image you
[1:06:39] behold from glory and to glory by the
[1:06:41] spirit of the lord
[1:06:42] it's not you
[1:06:44] it's the same one who restored the
[1:06:46] mirror
[1:06:47] is the same one who unveiled your face
[1:06:49] to look in the mirror
[1:06:51] is the same one who will change you into
[1:06:53] the image that you behold
[1:06:54] from glory
[1:06:56] unto glory
[1:06:58] it's the spirit of revelation
[1:07:00] it's the holy spirit
[1:07:02] that reveals to you
[1:07:04] who you really are
[1:07:07] and until you see that you will never
[1:07:09] become what the bride is supposed to be
[1:07:12] in this day
[1:07:16] praise be to god
[1:07:18] brother ben says in the unveiling of god
[1:07:20] he said notice then when we become part
[1:07:22] of him as you are the veil that veils
[1:07:25] him
[1:07:26] you are part of him as long as christ is
[1:07:28] in you as christ was of god because god
[1:07:30] was in him
[1:07:32] made him god and as christ is in you the
[1:07:35] hope of glory you become part of christ
[1:07:37] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:07:39] do shall he also see
[1:07:41] you become part of christ as long as
[1:07:43] christ is hid in you
[1:07:45] then it's veiled to the unbeliever but
[1:07:47] you know he's in you
[1:07:49] you are templing christ
[1:07:52] i love this quote you are templing
[1:07:55] christ that's behind the veil
[1:07:57] the skin
[1:07:59] once again
[1:08:01] god is behind skin
[1:08:04] you are tempting christ that's behind
[1:08:06] the veil of the skin
[1:08:08] then we be behind because of this veil
[1:08:11] the veil again in human flesh hides god
[1:08:15] the word
[1:08:16] you catch that
[1:08:20] because of this veil the veil again in
[1:08:22] human flesh which flesh is he talking
[1:08:24] about your flesh
[1:08:25] my flesh
[1:08:27] hides god
[1:08:29] the word
[1:08:31] what is god the word what is the word
[1:08:32] god
[1:08:34] hides god the word
[1:08:37] from the unbeliever
[1:08:40] it's on display
[1:08:41] and hidden
[1:08:43] we with an open face
[1:08:45] we behold we with uh
[1:08:47] clear speech
[1:08:49] proclaim it
[1:08:51] but there's a veil a traditional veil on
[1:08:53] the heart of those that hear
[1:08:55] and only revelation will take that veil
[1:08:57] away
[1:09:01] again in the unveiling of god he says
[1:09:02] like he was in moses when the word was
[1:09:05] in moses he was god and flesh
[1:09:07] when it was in jesus it was god in flesh
[1:09:09] see only thing he done was change his
[1:09:11] mask not his word not his nature he is
[1:09:14] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:09:16] only changed his form he changed from
[1:09:18] noah to moses he changed from moses to
[1:09:21] david from david joseph on down until he
[1:09:23] come into the fullness of the godhead
[1:09:25] bodily see
[1:09:27] it's still the same god amen i hope that
[1:09:29] gets through it's the same god but he
[1:09:32] just takes on another veil see he puts
[1:09:35] on another veil
[1:09:37] he did it in the reformers
[1:09:39] guess it's the same god
[1:09:42] just changing his veil
[1:09:44] changing his mask
[1:09:46] he did it in the reformers taking on a
[1:09:48] veil taken on a veil until finally it
[1:09:51] come down through the lutheran age down
[1:09:53] through the other age
[1:09:54] then finally it comes out into the
[1:09:56] complete
[1:09:58] so what is this he's veiled in this and
[1:10:01] veiled in this and veil all the way from
[1:10:03] luther to wesley to pentecost until
[1:10:05] finally it comes out in the complete
[1:10:08] now catch
[1:10:09] very carefully follow me
[1:10:12] just before it comes what jesus christ
[1:10:14] coming out and complete
[1:10:17] just before it comes
[1:10:18] a prophet arises again
[1:10:23] what it does it foreshadows the word
[1:10:25] showing back there revealing what's been
[1:10:27] done what's been left off that the
[1:10:29] church will be not without understanding
[1:10:33] then when this fades out
[1:10:36] listen friends
[1:10:39] it's going to come out into complete
[1:10:40] it's coming to the full complete but
[1:10:42] just before it comes to the full
[1:10:44] complaint a prophet will arise so the
[1:10:46] prophet arising is not coming to the
[1:10:48] complete before it comes to the complete
[1:10:50] the prophet arises
[1:10:52] because the prophet is a four he's a
[1:10:54] forerunner amen the prophet comes to
[1:10:56] reveal what god's going to do amen so
[1:10:58] you can't stop at the prophet the
[1:11:00] prophet's coming to show you something
[1:11:01] god's doing
[1:11:04] so just before it comes into the
[1:11:06] complete
[1:11:07] a prophet arises
[1:11:10] and when this fades out
[1:11:13] what fades out
[1:11:14] that profit fades out
[1:11:17] when this fades out then like john said
[1:11:19] i must decrease he must increase
[1:11:22] then
[1:11:23] all in all comes into him now it moves
[1:11:27] into completion what was the prophet
[1:11:29] here to do he was here to unite christ
[1:11:31] and the bride together he was here to
[1:11:33] manifest the son of man so it's so
[1:11:35] manifest that it will it will unite the
[1:11:37] christ and the bride together again and
[1:11:39] then the fullness of christ pours into
[1:11:42] that bride and she becomes the full
[1:11:43] reflection of the word that's him
[1:11:45] incomplete now all in all has moved into
[1:11:48] this picture amen and so if you stop at
[1:11:50] the prophet you miss what he came to do
[1:11:58] he is fully manifested through luther
[1:12:00] wesley pentecostal age on down on down
[1:12:03] he is fully manifested you see come down
[1:12:06] just a manifestation god unfolding see
[1:12:09] him fulfilled in his promise for this
[1:12:11] day as they had it
[1:12:14] just before it comes into completeness a
[1:12:16] prophet rises on the scene and when this
[1:12:18] begins to fade out like john said i must
[1:12:20] decrease he must increase then all in
[1:12:22] all comes into him
[1:12:23] oh praise god so we've got to move amen
[1:12:26] we've got to believe this prophet we've
[1:12:28] got to take what he said he restored the
[1:12:30] mirror he put the word back together he
[1:12:33] un he opened the seals he unveiled the
[1:12:35] bride amen so that that message could
[1:12:38] take the veil off of your face so that
[1:12:40] you could look into that mirror and see
[1:12:42] who you really are
[1:12:45] and when the bride comes to that all in
[1:12:47] all moves in
[1:12:50] so that
[1:12:51] this bride becomes the complete
[1:12:53] reflection
[1:12:54] the veil
[1:12:56] that's temple in christ
[1:12:59] let's turn to james chapter one
[1:13:11] james chapter 1
[1:13:16] and i'm going to read from verse 22.
[1:13:22] james chapter 1 verse 22
[1:13:25] but be ye doers of the word
[1:13:28] and not hearers only
[1:13:30] i want you to stop for a minute
[1:13:33] we have heard the word in just
[1:13:35] generation
[1:13:36] is that correct
[1:13:39] but god never sent the word for us to
[1:13:41] hear
[1:13:42] he sent the word for us to live
[1:13:45] to manifest to demonstrate to be living
[1:13:48] epistles
[1:13:50] read of all men
[1:13:51] he didn't just give us the word to read
[1:13:52] and say wow that's good word
[1:13:55] but that that word would become manifest
[1:13:57] in us
[1:13:59] he said but be doers of the word and not
[1:14:01] hearers only deceiving your own selves
[1:14:04] for if any be a hearer of the word and
[1:14:06] not a doer he is likened to a man be
[1:14:09] holding his natural face in a glass a
[1:14:11] mirror
[1:14:13] for he beholdeth himself and goeth his
[1:14:15] way and straightway forgiveth what
[1:14:17] manner of man he was
[1:14:21] here's a man he's typing now somebody
[1:14:23] who hears the word
[1:14:25] and doesn't do it
[1:14:26] is like a man who goes up into a mirror
[1:14:29] and he sees himself and he turns around
[1:14:32] and as soon as he turns around he forgot
[1:14:33] what he saw
[1:14:35] he forgot what manner of man he was he
[1:14:37] slips back into amnesia he forgot who he
[1:14:39] was he forgot what he saw amen and if we
[1:14:41] look into the word and we don't begin to
[1:14:44] live the word we have looked into the
[1:14:46] mirror saw who we are but then go live
[1:14:48] some other kind of life amen then go
[1:14:50] chase some other kind of dream so get
[1:14:53] involved in something else that's not
[1:14:54] the word amen that's not for us amen
[1:14:57] when we look at this word we're a doer
[1:14:59] of the word we're a liver of the word
[1:15:01] we're an expresser of the word we are a
[1:15:03] manifesto of this word
[1:15:06] so if we look at the word and turn and
[1:15:08] walk away you're just like somebody who
[1:15:10] looked into the mirror and turned and
[1:15:11] they forgot what manner of man they were
[1:15:13] amen you slipped back in the spiritual
[1:15:16] amnesia you look right at the word amen
[1:15:18] right at the message and brother man i'm
[1:15:20] screaming out who the bride is where
[1:15:22] jesus christ is what the manifestation
[1:15:25] of the hour is and we turn around and
[1:15:27] live a compromised life and live for the
[1:15:29] world and just willy-nilly whatever and
[1:15:32] we we looked
[1:15:34] but we forgot
[1:15:37] we walked out the door on sunday and on
[1:15:39] monday we forgot who we were
[1:15:42] we forgot we were the word
[1:15:44] yes we come on wednesday night when we
[1:15:46] wake up thursday morning and go to work
[1:15:47] and we forgot we were the word
[1:15:52] oh praise god
[1:15:55] but we're supposed to look into the
[1:15:56] mirror and know who we are
[1:15:59] and turn around and live what we saw
[1:16:04] brother brahm says in spiritual amnesia
[1:16:07] and another thing that causes it among
[1:16:08] the people
[1:16:10] is getting between two opinions
[1:16:13] oh friends
[1:16:15] this man who behold himself in the
[1:16:16] mirror turned around and straightway
[1:16:18] forgot what manner of man he was
[1:16:21] he went right back into amnesia
[1:16:23] we listen to the prophet screaming
[1:16:24] sunday we say amen wednesday we say amen
[1:16:27] we're the bride of jesus christ amen
[1:16:29] we're to live the life of christ amen
[1:16:31] amen and immediately return and forgot
[1:16:33] what we heard
[1:16:35] and what causes this amnesia to forget
[1:16:38] who you are
[1:16:39] it's being stuck between two opinions
[1:16:43] two opinions about the word two opinions
[1:16:45] about the life two opinions on uh it
[1:16:48] could be two opinions you could have you
[1:16:50] could have two personalities
[1:16:53] you could have a work personality
[1:16:55] and a home personality
[1:16:59] and you're stuck between two opinions i
[1:17:02] live one way away from the believers i
[1:17:04] live another way with the believers
[1:17:07] i live one way at home i live another
[1:17:09] way away from home
[1:17:11] i'm one way in church but i'm a
[1:17:12] different way outside of church if you
[1:17:14] get stuck between two opinions you're
[1:17:16] going to look at that mirror and turn
[1:17:17] around and forget who you are
[1:17:20] because you'll be a hearer of the word a
[1:17:22] hearer of the revelation but not a liver
[1:17:24] not living the word not living the
[1:17:26] revelation
[1:17:29] what can cause this getting between two
[1:17:31] opinions i say friends with everything
[1:17:33] that's in us let's die to ourselves and
[1:17:35] take one opinion and that opinion is
[1:17:37] this message
[1:17:38] let's forget all our own opinions
[1:17:39] everybody else's opinions and let's line
[1:17:41] everything up in our lives to this word
[1:17:43] and if you've got trouble living one way
[1:17:45] one place and one way another i would
[1:17:47] say cut off all associations cut off
[1:17:50] every bit of form of entertainment or
[1:17:51] all other reading and dive into this
[1:17:53] word and nothing else until you can get
[1:17:55] into one opinion amen so god can change
[1:17:58] you and wake you up and break spiritual
[1:18:00] amnesia off of you and you know who you
[1:18:02] are and you're the same person at work
[1:18:04] as you are at church as you are at home
[1:18:06] as you are all by yourself away
[1:18:08] thousands away miles away from every
[1:18:10] believer that you'll be the exact same
[1:18:12] person
[1:18:14] amen because if not you get caught
[1:18:15] between two opinions and you forget who
[1:18:17] you are
[1:18:18] when i say god let me stay in this word
[1:18:21] till i've got one opinion of who i am
[1:18:22] one opinion of this word one opinion of
[1:18:24] the message one way to live my life and
[1:18:27] that's for you to live in me
[1:18:31] amen
[1:18:32] we need to devote ourselves to this word
[1:18:35] because it breaks our spiritual amnesia
[1:18:39] so then
[1:18:40] that'll cause amnesia
[1:18:43] and it gets you to a place where you
[1:18:44] actually what you've done you've lost
[1:18:46] your reasons
[1:18:48] you've lost your mind
[1:18:49] you don't know who you are you can
[1:18:51] identify yourself you can walk around
[1:18:53] eating everything but you still can
[1:18:55] identify yourself
[1:18:58] amen who are you well i'm so and so and
[1:19:01] i'm a mechanic down at so-and-so shop
[1:19:04] you got spiritual amnesia
[1:19:08] well i'm i'm i'm this and that and and i
[1:19:11] live in this home and this is my mom and
[1:19:13] this is my my dad you got spiritual
[1:19:15] amnesia until everything starts with i'm
[1:19:18] a son of god and i work in that shop
[1:19:19] over there i'm a son of god amen part of
[1:19:22] his bride and i live in this home i'm a
[1:19:23] son of god and i'm married to that
[1:19:25] sister there i'm married to that brother
[1:19:26] there tell you don't have to say that
[1:19:28] with everything you say but the
[1:19:29] mentality is always the same you're
[1:19:31] always a son of god you're always part
[1:19:33] of christ you're always reflecting
[1:19:35] christ in everything we do
[1:19:37] he said when you get in this amnesia you
[1:19:39] can eat you can talk you can walk around
[1:19:40] you can work you can do everything but
[1:19:42] you can't identify yourself
[1:19:45] listen i i want to say this from the
[1:19:47] bottom of my heart but there's so many
[1:19:50] people in the message that cannot
[1:19:51] identify themselves
[1:19:53] they attached themselves to a prophetic
[1:19:56] ministry they believed brother bannon
[1:19:57] was a prophet they believed that god
[1:19:59] sent him that he fulfilled all these
[1:20:00] scriptures but they have no idea what
[1:20:02] scriptures they're supposed to fulfill
[1:20:05] they know who he was but they don't know
[1:20:06] who they are
[1:20:08] and he came to bring an identification
[1:20:11] to the bride so that we would know who
[1:20:12] we are amen if we know who he is that's
[1:20:15] wonderful but he came to reveal who we
[1:20:17] are so that we know who we are
[1:20:23] how many people can't identify
[1:20:25] themselves
[1:20:27] they know what's been taught they know
[1:20:28] the major doctrines
[1:20:30] but they're still in doubt whether or
[1:20:32] not they're a son of god
[1:20:34] they're still questioning whether
[1:20:35] they'll go in the rapture they're still
[1:20:37] worried about whether or not they're in
[1:20:38] the bride or whether they'll make it or
[1:20:40] not
[1:20:42] amnesia
[1:20:44] see let's come down to one opinion
[1:20:48] one opinion
[1:20:52] you can walk around eat everything but
[1:20:54] you still can't identify yourself
[1:20:56] you've got your scholarly education some
[1:20:58] education you had but you don't know
[1:21:00] where it come from
[1:21:02] you don't know who you are where you
[1:21:03] belong that's amnesia so we're told
[1:21:08] i don't want spiritual amnesia
[1:21:11] i don't want to look at this message and
[1:21:12] turn around and forget
[1:21:14] who i really am
[1:21:17] but the man said it was a great day when
[1:21:18] i realized i wasn't the son of charles
[1:21:20] and ella branham
[1:21:22] he knew who he really was
[1:21:24] he had looked in the mirror and got a
[1:21:25] true identification of himself and he
[1:21:28] saw the glory of the lord
[1:21:32] his amnesia was broken
[1:21:35] and the message god's provided place of
[1:21:36] worship he says the church will come
[1:21:38] through justification through luther
[1:21:40] through sanctification through wesley
[1:21:42] through the baptism of the holy ghost of
[1:21:43] the pentecostals and go right on into
[1:21:45] the perfection of the son of man
[1:21:48] so what is the perfection of the son of
[1:21:50] man this next sentence is what he's
[1:21:52] going to identify as a perfection of the
[1:21:54] son of man
[1:21:56] i thought i thought the perfection of
[1:21:58] the son of man was back there in the 60s
[1:22:01] no that was a son of man revealing the
[1:22:03] son of man
[1:22:05] but the perfection of the son of man
[1:22:07] is that when husband and wife will be
[1:22:09] the same
[1:22:10] self-persons
[1:22:13] that's the perfection of the son of man
[1:22:16] that when she looks in that mirror she
[1:22:18] sees christ
[1:22:20] and when christ looks at her
[1:22:22] he sees christ
[1:22:24] so that we're reflecting
[1:22:26] the word
[1:22:28] i'm going to read that again
[1:22:30] it'll go through the baptism in the holy
[1:22:32] ghost where the pentecostals will go
[1:22:33] right on into the perfection of the son
[1:22:34] of man that when husband and wife will
[1:22:37] be the same self-persons
[1:22:41] god will be so manifested into his bride
[1:22:44] his church till they will both be the
[1:22:46] same they are one
[1:22:48] now you see where we're at
[1:22:52] i think god the prophet came
[1:22:55] and he put the mirror back together
[1:22:59] and then god would pluck up the word in
[1:23:01] that vessel and wave it over the people
[1:23:03] showing this is what you're coming to
[1:23:05] this is the first revelation of the
[1:23:08] bride
[1:23:09] one with spiritual amnesia broken one
[1:23:11] that come into the that come in union
[1:23:13] with christ so much that christ could
[1:23:15] use that vessel so much that people
[1:23:17] would be confused on which was jesus
[1:23:19] christ and which wasn't
[1:23:21] and he was the wave chief showing us
[1:23:23] that that maturity is what the whole
[1:23:24] bride is coming to
[1:23:26] i thank god for that but that wave chief
[1:23:28] was to encourage me that whatever god
[1:23:31] did to bring him to there he can bring
[1:23:33] me the same way that's my goal that's my
[1:23:35] target that's what i'm going to do
[1:23:38] not looking back but looking forward i
[1:23:40] look back to what god waved over us and
[1:23:42] said praise god that's what i'm growing
[1:23:45] to that's what i'm becoming amen i'm
[1:23:47] becoming a child of god in the full
[1:23:49] stature of jesus christ in human flesh
[1:23:53] growing into the head
[1:23:55] and i say thank god for that
[1:23:57] lord grow us
[1:23:59] into that image
[1:24:03] i want to read one more scripture
[1:24:05] first corinthians
[1:24:07] chapter 11.
[1:24:08] musicians if you want to make your way
[1:24:10] up
[1:24:20] first corinthians 11
[1:24:23] verse 7.
[1:24:24] now remember what we read
[1:24:26] we
[1:24:28] with an unveiled face
[1:24:31] looking into a glass or changed into the
[1:24:34] image that we behold or we behold the
[1:24:36] glory of the lord
[1:24:38] but i want to read first corinthians 11
[1:24:40] 7
[1:24:42] for a man indeed ought not to cover his
[1:24:44] head for as much as he is the image and
[1:24:46] glory of god that was jesus christ
[1:24:49] the perfect man the last adam he was the
[1:24:52] image of the invisible god
[1:24:54] but the woman
[1:24:56] is the glory of the man
[1:25:00] the woman is the glory of the man
[1:25:04] the bride
[1:25:05] is the glory of jesus christ
[1:25:08] and when we with open face
[1:25:11] beholding is in a glass
[1:25:13] the glory of the lord
[1:25:16] because the woman
[1:25:17] is the glory of the man
[1:25:20] and this bride
[1:25:22] is the glory of jesus christ
[1:25:25] and when we see that
[1:25:27] then we're changed into that image
[1:25:30] from glory unto glory
[1:25:33] by the spirit of the lord
[1:25:35] say i thank god for this message
[1:25:38] i thank god for a mirror that's not
[1:25:41] broken
[1:25:42] that's not distorted that's not twisted
[1:25:45] but it's a perfect mirror
[1:25:47] of the word that you can look into and
[1:25:49] get a proper identification of who you
[1:25:53] really are
[1:25:55] and if we can stay in one opinion not
[1:25:57] halt between two but one opinion we can
[1:26:00] live in this world
[1:26:01] with an understanding of who we are
[1:26:04] and spiritual amnesia can be broke off
[1:26:07] of us friends
[1:26:08] man let's all stand
[1:26:13] i say god
[1:26:15] let me see a clear image in this mirror
[1:26:19] take this word the revelation of this
[1:26:21] word by your spirit and take the
[1:26:23] traditional veil off of my heart take
[1:26:25] the veil off of my face so that when i
[1:26:28] see i'm not reading about stories of old
[1:26:30] people long time ago or things that
[1:26:31] happen somewhere else but i can see
