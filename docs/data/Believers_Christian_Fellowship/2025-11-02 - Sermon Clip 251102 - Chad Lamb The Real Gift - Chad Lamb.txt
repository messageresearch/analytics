TRANSCRIPT
========================================
This is the mind of God. This is the family album. This is where I find my identification. Amen. I took the kids and I I took them to Malachi 4 and repeated what brother Gabe did a few weeks ago when he says, you look at Malachi 4 and says, "Behold, I that's God send you." &gt;&gt; That's the mystery. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet. And we believe we know who that is. William Brandham. &gt;&gt; So those who receive the prophet &gt;&gt; and receive his mis ministry, who are they? &gt;&gt; I'll go through it again. &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this scripture identifies three people. &gt;&gt; That identifies God. It identifies Elijah the prophet. And it identifies a people who Elijah the prophet was sent to. &gt;&gt; So if you've received the ministry of Elijah the prophet, &gt;&gt; who are you? &gt;&gt; Did you just identify yourself scripturally? &gt;&gt; You just identified yourself scripturally. You didn't look in your mirror. You didn't look at your past. You didn't look who your parents were. You didn't consider what you done right yesterday or wrong yesterday. You found your identification in the prophecy for this day. I'M PART OF THE PROPHECY. BEHOLD, I SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET. I'VE RECEIVED THAT ELIJAH the prophet. SO, HE SENT ME. I'M IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I'M PART OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I FOUND MY IDENTIFICATION IN THE MIRROR OF GOD'S WORD. &gt;&gt; What about where the carcass is, the eagles will be gathered. What carcass? Brother Bram said, "The fresh kill of the word, where the word is fresh for your day." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The fresh mana that fell. Not the old carryover from a previous age. Not what had been killed the day before on the road, but the fresh kill of the word, which is what? The message of the hour. And the fresh kill of the word is where the eagles are gathered. The question is, is this message the fresh kill of the word? &gt;&gt; ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO IT? &gt;&gt; Are you feeding on it? &gt;&gt; Do you like it? YEAH. &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT'S YOUR IDENTIFICATION? ARE YOU AN EAGLE &gt;&gt; BASED OFF WHAT? THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF. NO. BASED OFF THE WORD OF GOD. I'M AN EAGLE. I FOUND MY IDENTIFICATION IN THE WORD TO BREAK MY AMNESIA. &gt;&gt; You say, "BUT I CAN'T CALL MYSELF AN EAGLE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID YESTERDAY." LISTEN, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DID YESTERDAY. I'M LOOKING AT THE PROMISE FOR THIS HOUR. AND THERE'S GOT TO BE A PEOPLE WHO CAN IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND STOP RELYING ON FEELINGS AND STOP GOING UP AND DOWN EVERY FIVE MINUTES BUT COME BACK TO THE BASIS OF FAITH IN THE WORD AND FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE BY THE WRITTEN WORD. &gt;&gt; THIS DOESN'T CHANGE YOUR EMOTIONS CHANGE. THIS DOESN'T CHANGE YOUR YOUR IDEAS CHANGE. YOUR EMOTIONS CHANGE. YOUR RESOLVE TO DO GOOD CHANGES. &gt;&gt; But this word can't change. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to find our identification in the word.
