[7:07] the seeing of our thanksgiving
[7:09] for your goodness to us for your grace
[7:11] that's abundant in our lives
[7:14] god now as we turn our hearts to your
[7:16] word we just pray that you would
[7:18] help us lord feed from your hand lord
[7:21] would you come and break the bread of
[7:22] life
[7:23] open our eyes to see who you are in this
[7:25] day

[7:28] your expression may we feed
[7:30] from that portion of the word we have
[7:32] need of lord may you be glorified and
[7:35] magnified in all we do

[7:38] preeminence among us
[7:40] in jesus christ's name amen
[7:44] god bless you let's just have our seats
[7:46] for a minute just before you
[7:48] uh we go to the word we have a baby
[7:51] dedication this morning
[7:53] so brother greg you and sister megan
[7:55] want to come and bring
[7:57] little greta elise bird and then i was
[8:00] looking up her name and i called
[8:01] our text brother greg to to make sure it
[8:04] was what
[8:06] what he told me it was and i looked it
[8:08] up and greta means child of light
[8:11] praise god and at least means dedicated
[8:14] to god
[8:15] but greta also has a secondary meaning
[8:17] meaning little pearl
[8:19] and i like that as well so praise god
[8:22] there's a lot to a name and she's got a
[8:25] lot in her name
[8:28] praise the lord

[8:40] so let's bow our heads together
[8:43] lord jesus we're so thankful father that
[8:45] we can
[8:46] hold this little baby in our arms and or
[8:49] that there's a mother and a father here
[8:51] that trust in you
[8:53] that recognize the source of all life
[8:55] and where this child came from
[8:57] and god has a token of their faith is a
[9:00] symbol of what they believe they've come
[9:02] down and
[9:03] they've handed this baby over and i lift
[9:05] her in my arms as if you were standing
[9:07] here
[9:08] to bless her life lauren to first give

[9:12] for her safe delivery lord that she's
[9:14] here and healthy and strong
[9:17] lord as the parents want to dedicate her

[9:20] little life
[9:21] you'd shelter her and you'd guard her
[9:23] all the days of her life
[9:25] god that as she would grow for all the
[9:27] time that you've appointed for us to
[9:29] remain on this earth that as she would
[9:30] grow
[9:31] she would grow in grace she would go in
[9:33] knowledge that she would know you lord
[9:35] from the time she's young
[9:37] that she would form a relationship with
[9:39] the living god
[9:40] and she would always know what it's like
[9:41] to walk with you that you would grip her
[9:43] heart while she's
[9:44] yet a youth lord and she would always
[9:47] love you
[9:48] we pray the blessing upon brother greg

[10:31] amen we can all stand
[10:38] praise god let's turn in our bibles to
[10:40] isaiah
[10:41] 53. you know the world is falling apart
[10:47] things are in chaos but the word of god
[10:50] is still being made manifest and the
[10:51] blessings of god are still with his
[10:53] people
[10:54] so we thank god for them i also want to
[10:57] remind you that
[10:57] don't forget that there will be
[10:59] communion service this
[11:01] afternoon for all who'd like to stay for
[11:02] that and we'll try to announce that
[11:04] again at the end of service
[11:06] amen let's look at isaiah chapter 53
[11:08] verse 1.
[11:11] who hath believed our report and to whom
[11:13] is the arm of the lord revealed
[11:16] for he shall grow up before him as a
[11:18] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[11:19] ground
[11:20] he has no form nor comingness and we
[11:23] when we shall see him there is no beauty
[11:25] that we should desire him
[11:27] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[11:29] of sorrows and acquainted with grief
[11:31] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[11:34] he was despised
[11:35] and we esteemed him not surely he hath
[11:38] borne our griefs and carried our sorrows
[11:40] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[11:43] of god
[11:44] and afflicted but he was wounded for our
[11:47] transgressions he was bruised for our
[11:48] iniquities
[11:49] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[11:52] him
[11:52] and with his stripes we are healed all
[11:55] we like
[11:56] sheep have gone astray we have turned
[11:57] everyone to his own way
[11:59] and the lord hath laid on him the
[12:00] iniquity of us all
[12:02] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[12:04] yet he opened not his mouth
[12:06] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[12:08] and as a sheep before her shears is dumb
[12:10] so he openeth not his mouth he was taken
[12:13] from prison and from judgment
[12:15] and who shall declare his generation for
[12:17] he was cut off out of the land of the
[12:19] living
[12:19] for the transgression of my people was
[12:21] he stricken and he made his grave
[12:24] with the wicked and with the rich and
[12:25] death because he had done no violence
[12:27] neither was any deceit in his mouth
[12:29] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he
[12:32] he hath put him to grief whom thou shalt
[12:35] make his soul
[12:36] when thou shalt make his soul and
[12:37] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[12:40] for he shall prolong his days
[12:42] and the pleasure of the lord shall
[12:43] prosper in his hand
[12:45] he shall see of the travail of his soul
[12:47] and shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[12:50] shall my righteous servant justify many
[12:52] for he shall bear
[12:54] their iniquities amen may god add the
[12:56] blessing to the reading of his word you
[12:58] can be seated
[13:00] god bless you matthew it's good to see
[13:02] you back for a visit amen
[13:04] we saved that seat for you nobody else
[13:06] took it so whenever you visit you can
[13:07] have it
[13:09] amen well we want to look at this uh
[13:12] we've read this a few times but i want
[13:14] to look at it
[13:14] in the context of a thought that god
[13:16] dropped in my heart i was going to go a
[13:18] different direction but this just
[13:19] stirring in me and i couldn't get away
[13:21] from it
[13:22] so for a week now i've been meditating
[13:24] on this and i'd like just for a title to
[13:27] title this
[13:27] every masterpiece has a scar so if you
[13:31] can just
[13:31] think about that every masterpiece has a
[13:33] scar
[13:35] and i'm not really speaking in the terms
[13:37] of worldly masterpieces
[13:39] because you know every every every
[13:42] masterpiece when they get to the point
[13:43] where they call it a masterpiece is a
[13:45] work of art or
[13:46] anything that somebody would call a
[13:47] masterpiece they're looking for
[13:49] something without flaw
[13:51] they're looking for something that that
[13:53] has no flaw that has no error that has
[13:56] nothing wrong with it that's a
[13:58] masterpiece
[14:00] but i like to take a different approach
[14:03] and look from the the um viewpoint that
[14:07] god's been dealing with me on if you'll
[14:08] just go on this journey with me
[14:10] that every masterpiece of god has a scar
[14:15] and we'll just begin to talk about that
[14:16] and share about that and hopefully
[14:18] it'll come to light in the the message
[14:21] the masterpiece which i'm going to be
[14:22] drawing heavily from today
[14:24] uh as i've been studying that message he
[14:26] says after he had spent all that time
[14:29] for years and years to make this
[14:31] then under the influence of seeing
[14:33] fulfilled what he had seen in his heart
[14:35] and in his vision
[14:36] and desired to see it was completed now
[14:39] he's referring to the statue of moses
[14:41] that michelangelo had worked so long on
[14:44] and he had made it so perfect to the
[14:46] image that was in his mind
[14:47] and he's coming to that part of the
[14:49] story he says and when it was completed
[14:51] he was so inspired by it
[14:53] that he thought his own masterpiece
[14:54] should speak back to him
[14:56] and he struck it across the leg and
[14:58] hollered speak and it made a flaw in it
[15:01] it put a flaw on the image to me
[15:04] the flaw was what made it the
[15:06] masterpiece
[15:07] brother is going to expound on this but
[15:09] i want i want us to lock in on that and
[15:12] don't let's not skip ahead to what else
[15:13] we know brother branham says but just
[15:15] catch what he's saying that it was
[15:17] strict and it had a flaw
[15:19] now there was a flaw in this perfect
[15:21] masterpiece but
[15:22] but the flaw brother branham said is
[15:25] what made
[15:26] it the masterpiece now maybe the mind
[15:28] that might think different you think
[15:30] that spoiled it
[15:31] no to me it made it what it was because
[15:34] after so many years of careful work and
[15:36] toils and inspiration and so forth
[15:39] of making it his toil had proved not in
[15:42] vain
[15:42] it was perfect and that's why he cried
[15:44] out speak because he had seen before him
[15:47] that that was had been able to to
[15:50] achieve to bring to pass the vision that
[15:52] was in his mind
[15:53] and therefore under inspiration he done
[15:55] something out of reason
[15:57] out of ordinary he struck it and
[15:59] hollered speak
[16:00] see he wouldn't have done that if he had
[16:02] thought
[16:03] but he didn't think he was it was
[16:05] inspiration of seeing what he had in his
[16:07] mind
[16:08] setting there perfectly before him
[16:13] amen let's turn to john chapter 20.
[16:19] do we know that brother branham is
[16:20] drawing a parallel between
[16:23] michelangelo creating this great work of
[16:25] the image of moses and
[16:27] being so inspired by seeing it he
[16:29] hollered speak and struck it
[16:31] upon the knee and and he's typing it
[16:34] with god and making his masterpiece when
[16:37] he would rebuild what had fallen in the
[16:38] garden and
[16:39] he built through the old testament
[16:41] through the apostles and the prophets he
[16:43] had built another
[16:44] masterpiece image of a son and that was
[16:47] the son of god that was jesus christ and
[16:49] he come
[16:50] so perfect he becomes such a perfect
[16:52] masterpiece that
[16:53] god struck a blow to him amen to his
[16:55] side and he pulled out the ingredients
[16:58] for
[16:58] his wife and he began to make the bride
[17:00] off of that blow off of that strike
[17:03] where he struck him and and brother ben
[17:05] was running that parallel
[17:06] and let's go to john chapter 20 now
[17:10] verse 26
[17:15] and after eight days again his disciples
[17:17] were within and
[17:18] thomas with them then came jesus the
[17:21] doors being shut and stood in the midst
[17:23] and said peace be unto you
[17:25] then said he to thomas reach hither thy
[17:27] finger and behold my hands and reach
[17:29] hither
[17:29] thy hand and thrust it into my side and
[17:32] be not faithless but believing and
[17:34] thomas answered and said unto him
[17:36] my lord and my god now
[17:40] we know that he presents himself to his
[17:42] disciples and
[17:43] we know thomas made the statement i will
[17:45] not believe it unless i can thrust my
[17:47] finger in his hand and
[17:48] my my hand and his side and so jesus
[17:51] appears to them
[17:52] but he shows them his wounds he shows
[17:54] them his flaws
[17:55] he shows them his scars
[17:59] and when when when thomas saw
[18:02] the scars he saw the fall he saw the
[18:05] mark of the crucifixion
[18:07] and he knew that this was the
[18:08] resurrection he says
[18:10] my he this is what he says my lord and
[18:13] my god
[18:14] amen there was something striking about
[18:16] seeing
[18:17] amen the resurrection of christ but
[18:20] christ
[18:20] pointed him because that's what he
[18:22] wanted to look to christ pointed him to
[18:24] the scars
[18:25] in the message marriage and divorce
[18:29] and this is well i'm not going to read
[18:30] this quote i'll read that later let's go
[18:32] back to genesis chapter 2.
[18:38] genesis chapter 2.
[18:46] and verse 21
[18:51] and the lord god caused a deep sleep to
[18:55] fall upon
[18:56] adam and he slept and he took one of his
[18:58] ribs and closed up the flesh instead
[19:00] thereof
[19:01] so now we know that we've been talking
[19:05] about this a lot lately but i
[19:07] i just can't leave the subject so just
[19:09] bear with me
[19:11] the that that god had made
[19:14] what was in his mind he made a
[19:17] masterpiece in creation and when he had
[19:19] created
[19:20] and brother baby said he created in an
[19:22] evolutionary way i mean not evolution
[19:24] but
[19:24] he created from the small creatures he
[19:26] made him up into the great creatures and
[19:29] finally he he made you know he come to
[19:31] apes and monkeys and
[19:32] and these things and chimpanzees and
[19:34] then he comes to a man and the man was
[19:36] reflecting his image
[19:38] amen and he come to that masterpiece but
[19:41] we'll read here in a moment but brother
[19:43] brother van tells us there wasn't
[19:45] something exactly right
[19:47] so how could you say that god come to
[19:49] his masterpiece it was perfect amen he
[19:51] was reflecting
[19:52] the image of god in the form of creation
[19:55] but it wasn't exactly right
[19:57] amen so god had to strike a little blow
[20:00] and to the side of adam
[20:04] he had to strike a little wound he had
[20:06] to make a little mar
[20:07] he had to put a a mark there
[20:11] and he he took one of his ribs and
[20:13] closed up the flesh instead there of now
[20:15] verse 22
[20:16] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[20:18] from man made a woman
[20:20] and brought her into a man and adam said
[20:23] this is now bone of my bones and flesh
[20:25] of my flesh
[20:26] she shall be called woman because she
[20:28] was taken out of
[20:30] man so now we see
[20:33] god when he when he forms his
[20:34] masterpiece if you would just be there
[20:37] looking over the banner and watching
[20:39] what god's doing and
[20:41] knowing that he's bringing up a creation
[20:43] and he's going to have a
[20:44] son over this creation and that son is
[20:46] going to be a reflection
[20:47] of himself upon the earth and god he
[20:51] he makes the reflection he makes the
[20:53] image and it looks so good and
[20:55] it looks so perfect but all of a sudden
[20:58] god
[20:58] who is the the mastermind behind the
[21:01] masterpiece this is what you have to
[21:04] remember
[21:05] you have to remember he's the mastermind
[21:07] behind the masterpiece
[21:09] so everything he does is perfect the
[21:12] mastermind behind the masterpiece
[21:14] if he looks at it and says no i need to
[21:17] place a little mark
[21:18] a little blow right here under his rib
[21:21] and i need to pull a piece out of that
[21:22] you who would be watching who doesn't
[21:24] have the mind
[21:26] of the master builder would say you're
[21:28] ruining it you're breaking it
[21:29] you're damaging what you made but he is
[21:32] the mastermind behind the masterpiece
[21:34] and he's not ruining it but he is
[21:36] marking it
[21:37] he is breaking it amen he is taking from
[21:40] it
[21:41] something that he can make a further
[21:43] image
[21:44] of the image that is in his mind
[21:48] so you would want to stop him amen you
[21:51] would want to tell him to
[21:52] don't do that don't ruin it don't break
[21:54] it amen but he's the mastermind behind
[21:56] the masterpiece he's not
[21:58] ruining it amen and brother branham
[22:01] comes to the story of michelangelo and
[22:03] he sees
[22:04] michelangelo was so inspired by the
[22:06] image in his mind becoming a reality in
[22:09] front of him
[22:09] he commanded it to speak and when it
[22:11] wouldn't speak out of frustration he
[22:13] strikes it with the hammer
[22:14] and everyone else brother bam say we say
[22:16] you flawed it it was perfect till
[22:18] that and brother man said that's what
[22:20] made it perfect to me
[22:21] because the mastermind behind the
[22:23] masterpiece put it there
[22:27] because it was such a reality to him
[22:34] and we know that god when he looked down
[22:37] at man alone in the garden although
[22:41] there was nothing wrong with the man he
[22:44] was made correctly he was made in the
[22:46] right order
[22:49] god looked down and says it's not good
[22:50] that man should dwell alone
[22:53] there was something else in his mind
[22:57] something else that had to be expressed
[23:00] so he would strike a blow
[23:02] [Music]
[23:04] brother bam told us we've been reading
[23:06] this quote i won't read all of them but
[23:07] we've been reading several quotes along
[23:09] the lines of how the woman was fashioned
[23:11] differently than all the other original
[23:14] creation and
[23:15] and i want to read one quote along those
[23:16] lines out of the invisible union
[23:19] when you see the woman a byproduct not
[23:21] another female like her
[23:24] made in that order knowing that she
[23:26] would be deceived god knowed
[23:28] if he didn't know the end from the
[23:30] beginning then he wasn't god
[23:33] if he isn't infinite if he can't be
[23:35] infinite without being omniscient
[23:37] omnipresent knowing all things eternal
[23:39] so he knowed all things
[23:41] and he had to make that woman the man
[23:44] didn't have a wife the wife and the man
[23:46] was the same thing
[23:47] he had the feminist and masculine spirit
[23:49] in himself
[23:50] he had to separate to take a byproduct
[23:52] after the whole creation made
[23:54] new no female created by god in the
[23:56] original creation can do a thing like
[23:58] that
[23:59] she was made thus to do it he knowed she
[24:01] would do it
[24:02] if he didn't he wasn't god
[24:06] but see the attributes that's in god
[24:10] had to be displayed so we spent some
[24:13] time on this but
[24:14] i just it's a it's it's amazing to me
[24:17] amen the way god does the things that he
[24:20] does
[24:20] remember don't ever forget he's the
[24:22] mastermind behind the masterpiece
[24:27] you see there's attributes
[24:31] that's in god had to be displayed
[24:36] god had to display himself
[24:39] as a redeemer he had to display himself
[24:41] as a healer
[24:42] he had to display himself as a savior
[24:45] amen
[24:46] but in his original form of creating
[24:48] there was nothing in the original
[24:50] amen because he because he being perfect
[24:53] he had to make the original perfect
[24:56] and as he was making it they could not
[24:58] sin
[24:59] but he had to create an opening he had
[25:01] to create an opportunity
[25:03] amen so that god wouldn't create evil he
[25:06] would not
[25:07] force evil he would not be evil but he
[25:09] would create
[25:10] something in a way that it had the
[25:13] ability to be perverted for evil
[25:15] purposes
[25:17] without him making it evil
[25:20] without him making it wrong
[25:25] see there was attributes that were
[25:27] locked inside of god
[25:29] characteristics of his nature that he
[25:31] had to have displayed
[25:33] and adam malone could not do it the
[25:36] original creation that had been formed
[25:38] out of the dust of the earth
[25:40] could not do it amen so god was going to
[25:42] have to take a byproduct
[25:45] made off of the original pull out of the
[25:47] man he was going to have to strike a
[25:49] little blow
[25:50] amen and pull out break off a piece and
[25:53] out of the broken piece of the
[25:55] masterpiece
[25:56] he would continue fashioning the
[25:58] masterpiece
[26:00] it was a continuation of the masterpiece
[26:03] broken off and continued to form the
[26:05] masterpiece
[26:06] and then he would present the two back
[26:08] together again and make it the
[26:10] masterpiece the two
[26:12] being won in the garden of eden god was
[26:15] not making the woman wrong he was making
[26:17] her different
[26:19] do we believe that he was not making her
[26:22] wrong he was making her different
[26:26] because he had attributes that were
[26:28] locked inside of him
[26:30] he was to be a savior and to make
[26:33] everything perfect the way he had
[26:36] then there could be nothing lost
[26:39] oh don't be children be men and women
[26:41] we're at the end
[26:42] so brother bam is trying to get us to
[26:44] see what he's saying this is not for the
[26:46] immature this is not skim
[26:48] milk this is the meat of the gospel this
[26:50] is getting down
[26:51] to the mind of the mastermind amen
[26:55] god is by a prophetic gift allowing us
[26:58] to go back not just to see the thing
[27:00] that was made
[27:01] but go into the mind of the thing that
[27:03] was that made it
[27:05] so that we can understand why he made it
[27:07] that way
[27:09] because until god through a prophetic
[27:11] gift could take us
[27:12] and tap into the mastermind behind the
[27:14] masterpiece
[27:15] we would look with confusion at why why
[27:18] would god do it this
[27:20] way why would god allow the the devil
[27:22] amen to be
[27:23] in the garden why would he allow him
[27:26] access to his children
[27:27] why would he put those two trees there
[27:29] why didn't he put a fence around the
[27:31] tree
[27:32] why did he make the tree to begin with
[27:34] why was the tree there
[27:36] why why did they have access to the tree
[27:38] why would god not prevent the fall
[27:41] why would he why would he not keep the
[27:43] devil why didn't he just destroy him
[27:44] from the beginning
[27:48] why did he make a woman that way amen to
[27:50] where she could fall
[27:52] why why why why why
[27:55] because all we're doing is looking at
[27:57] the image and the image we see
[27:59] is yielding questions because we don't
[28:01] understand because it doesn't look like
[28:03] a masterpiece in the way that we would
[28:04] think a masterpiece would be made
[28:06] there's a there's a flaw there there's
[28:08] something there
[28:09] there's an open door there's an ability
[28:12] amen for the door to be opened
[28:15] and you would think a mastermind making
[28:17] a masterpiece he would make it so tight
[28:20] button it up under such security with
[28:22] such safety that there would be no
[28:23] opportunity for the fall
[28:25] but see the problem is we didn't
[28:27] understand through the church ages what
[28:29] was in the mind of the mind of the
[28:31] master craftsman
[28:33] and so we would make all kinds of
[28:34] excuses and stories and fairy tales and
[28:37] all kinds of ways to explain all of this
[28:40] but when god tapped us into his mind and
[28:42] he opened
[28:43] he opened a realm of heaven he opened
[28:45] the door to his mind
[28:47] to the revelation of the word amen and
[28:49] invited us to come up hither
[28:51] through a prophetic gift he was sharing
[28:53] with us the mind
[28:55] the mastermind of the masterpiece
[28:57] builder
[28:58] and then you could look at his
[28:59] masterpiece and say it's perfect it's
[29:02] perfect
[29:02] it's perfect everything he did was
[29:05] perfect
[29:10] see if you go back and we begin to read
[29:14] uh genesis in the account in the garden
[29:17] of eden
[29:18] and you begin to read it without the
[29:20] understanding
[29:22] of the mind of god you start to think
[29:25] that what god was wanting to do
[29:28] was create a perfect world and in that
[29:31] perfect world
[29:32] he was going to set a perfect son or
[29:34] daughter and then the perfect son and
[29:36] daughter he would have perfect
[29:37] fellowship
[29:39] and all of that is true is that all true
[29:42] that's all true but you and
[29:46] i without this prophetic gift we would
[29:48] have thought
[29:49] that's the only thing he wanted to do
[29:53] that's all he was after he just wanted
[29:55] to get a perfect son
[29:57] and a perfect daughter and he wanted to
[29:58] get them in a perfect place so he could
[30:00] come down and have perfect fellowship
[30:01] and he accomplished all of that in his
[30:04] creation
[30:04] amen by the time he got to the end of it
[30:06] he looked over all that he made and he
[30:08] said behold
[30:09] it is very good and he took his rest
[30:11] amen and he began to fellowship
[30:13] he had it the way he had it the way he
[30:16] wanted it
[30:17] he had perfect fellowship with a perfect
[30:19] son or daughter
[30:20] and a perfect setting
[30:23] but god made it in such a fashion
[30:27] that it could become imperfect
[30:32] showing that there was something more
[30:35] that he wanted
[30:36] this wasn't the only thing he wanted
[30:38] this wasn't the only expression in his
[30:40] heart
[30:41] it wasn't the only thing in his mind it
[30:43] wasn't the only thing he wanted us to
[30:45] see
[30:45] the great artist wanted us to see more
[30:50] so we as human beings think that
[30:53] perfection was in the garden
[30:55] that was it oh how horrible what a
[30:58] horrible thing
[30:59] that the picture was ruined amen god
[31:02] knew before the foundation of the world
[31:04] that the picture would be ruined
[31:05] amen it was part of his intention to
[31:08] allow the picture to be ruined
[31:10] because he's making a great masterpiece
[31:13] and all of these are pieces of the great
[31:15] masterpiece
[31:17] and we get locked down on one picture in
[31:20] one piece and get confused and don't
[31:22] understand why it's this way and why
[31:23] it's that way
[31:24] until a prophet of god can lift us up
[31:26] and see a greater picture and say
[31:28] all of this is painting the same picture
[31:37] when when lucifer comes as the devil and
[31:41] begins to work through the serpent
[31:46] he's looking for the weak spot
[31:49] the part that can be flawed
[31:53] so he comes to the part that's made off
[31:55] the floor
[31:58] looks like a broken piece
[32:01] looks like a marred spot and he comes
[32:04] and
[32:04] he comes to the woman and he begins to
[32:07] work on her and find out that there's a
[32:08] weakness laying in the woman
[32:12] and he thinks now that he's taking
[32:14] advantage of god
[32:18] and he's taking advantage of god's
[32:20] miscalculation
[32:24] god left a weakness here oh he shouldn't
[32:28] have done that
[32:28] he uh oh i i've caught something god
[32:32] didn't foresee
[32:35] i see i see he gave in to his son
[32:39] because his son was lonely and he had to
[32:41] catch up with
[32:42] creation and make something i see
[32:45] now he's been he's so wise he's become a
[32:48] fool
[32:51] with such wisdom and such intellect and
[32:54] such reasoning abilities and such
[32:56] brightness amen he sees this weakness
[32:58] this is what got him in trouble in
[33:00] heaven
[33:01] amen because he couldn't understand
[33:03] michael's humble kingdom
[33:05] and he thought for sure that he could
[33:06] build a greater kingdom
[33:08] than michael's humble kingdom there is
[33:10] something in the humility
[33:12] something in the simplicity that he
[33:14] didn't comprehend
[33:15] and that's what got him in trouble the
[33:17] first time and that's what got him
[33:18] kicked out
[33:21] and now he comes to earth and he begins
[33:24] to try to bring perversion into god's
[33:26] paradise
[33:27] amen into god's pleasure which is eden
[33:29] and he begins to explore
[33:31] and he finds a weakness and he thinks
[33:33] once again
[33:34] aha i got him i found it
[33:40] and god when he built the woman he had
[33:43] laid a trap
[33:45] a big old bear trap and he had opened
[33:48] that bear
[33:48] trap and he said it and he's got it
[33:52] sitting there
[33:53] but he doesn't want it to look like a
[33:55] dangerous place to step
[33:58] so he makes it look comfortable and easy
[34:01] you can take this one
[34:04] you can you may not be able to get to
[34:06] adam but to his wife
[34:08] you can get to this one all it is is a
[34:10] trap that was sad
[34:11] and when the devil come down exploring
[34:13] the weakness of the woman
[34:14] and he and he went to touch that he
[34:16] didn't realize that he pushed over the
[34:18] first domino
[34:19] in a whole string of dominoes that was
[34:21] going to be the thing that was going to
[34:23] absolutely destroy his very existence
[34:27] because god had attributes inside of him
[34:29] as redeemer attributes amen
[34:32] that he had to be expressed and if he's
[34:34] going to express himself as a victor as
[34:36] a champion
[34:37] as a father as a healer as a deliverer
[34:40] he was going to have to have a worthy
[34:42] adversary that could draw
[34:43] all of these characteristics out of him
[34:48] you could even you could even go beyond
[34:51] eden
[34:52] you could go back further than eden and
[34:54] you could look to heaven
[34:55] and you could say if you look in eden
[34:57] say why did god put
[34:59] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[35:00] there where they could access it why
[35:02] why did he do that and you have to ask a
[35:04] question why did he make lucifer in such
[35:06] a way
[35:07] that lucifer could be corrupted by his
[35:09] own brightness
[35:12] there was a weakness in lucifer
[35:16] what was his weakness his weakness was
[35:19] he didn't have
[35:20] character but he had every gift and
[35:24] every ability
[35:25] he had all he had everything if you read
[35:28] the description of him
[35:30] in ezekiel he has every attribute you
[35:32] could possibly want
[35:34] he was beautiful he had you know the
[35:36] pipes and the tablets and the organs
[35:38] were made in him and the day he was
[35:39] created
[35:39] he was full of wisdom he was perfect in
[35:42] beauty
[35:45] but there was a weakness in what looked
[35:48] like
[35:49] perfection god
[35:52] could not make lucifer evil
[35:56] any more than he can make the woman evil
[36:01] but he made lucifer in such a way he
[36:04] could be corrupted he didn't make him
[36:07] corrupted
[36:09] but he made lucifer with a door that can
[36:12] be opened
[36:15] and gave him free choice where he could
[36:18] open the door
[36:19] and he was deceived by his own
[36:22] brightness his own
[36:26] revelation his own wisdom his own
[36:29] understanding his own enlightenment his
[36:32] own brightness
[36:33] is what he was deceived by and you think
[36:35] how
[36:36] could god let that happen amen because
[36:39] inside of god were attributes that had
[36:41] to be expressed
[36:45] because before amen before there was a
[36:48] creation on the earth there was a lamb
[36:50] slain from before the foundation of the
[36:52] world
[36:52] and there were names attribute names
[36:54] written on that book of life
[36:55] amen so god had already the mastermind
[36:58] behind the masterpiece
[37:02] he already had a pencil sketch
[37:07] and that pencil sketch is the lamb's
[37:10] book of life
[37:12] and he's building his masterpiece to
[37:14] match his pencil sketch
[37:16] i hope you forgive me for using terms
[37:18] like that
[37:22] but how could god
[37:25] allow that to happen in heaven
[37:29] how when he finished heaven let's just
[37:32] think about the creation because before
[37:34] the heavenly realms and dimensions were
[37:36] created there was just god
[37:39] he wasn't even god yet because there was
[37:40] nothing to worship him he was elohim the
[37:42] self-existing one
[37:45] and when he first began to create
[37:47] brother brahma said in my opinion he
[37:49] first created
[37:50] angels and he began to create a heavenly
[37:52] realm with
[37:53] with heavenly creatures so that they
[37:55] could begin to worship him
[37:56] and so his first creation amen was in
[37:58] the heavenly realms
[38:00] and when he when he began to create in
[38:01] the heavenly realms they began to
[38:03] worship him
[38:04] and that made him god
[38:09] and so his first oh if i could just say
[38:12] if you'll just forgive me for just using
[38:14] terms that i understand because i don't
[38:16] know how to say it but his
[38:18] first paradise
[38:21] his first eden his first creation his
[38:24] first place where the angels sang
[38:26] songs to him and worshiped him around
[38:28] the throne and began to glorify his name
[38:31] that first place was the heavenly realm
[38:35] and there was a creature placed in that
[38:37] first realm
[38:39] that could be corrupted it couldn't be
[38:41] corrupted by god but he could be
[38:44] self-corrupted
[38:47] and he was self-corrupted and began
[38:51] to bring a corruption into the heavenly
[38:54] dimension
[38:57] and there was a fall that took place in
[39:00] the heavenly dimension
[39:02] and god's first masterpiece of heaven
[39:05] now is flawed does that make sense
[39:11] so god begins to create now upon the
[39:14] earth and we know what we catch in
[39:15] genesis 1 2 is a re-creation
[39:18] there was a creation before in genesis 1
[39:20] 1 and now we have a re-creation he's
[39:22] forming now a world and he's forming in
[39:25] eden which is his pleasure
[39:26] now he's forming a garden in the and
[39:28] eastward in eden now
[39:29] he's setting there the the image of
[39:31] himself in the form of a man
[39:33] now he's recreating his pleasure upon
[39:35] earth and he's got everything just right
[39:38] there's a perfect harmony in all of
[39:39] creation and nature is clicking right on
[39:42] time
[39:42] and there's harmony between the man and
[39:45] all of the creation
[39:46] and everything's just right but
[39:49] it's not good that that man's alone
[39:53] if all god was trying to do was
[39:58] move from heaven because heaven now
[40:01] has a flaw i hope you'll forgive me for
[40:04] saying that this is the only way i
[40:05] understand it
[40:07] we all think that the heavenly realm is
[40:09] perfection but the bible shows us that
[40:11] the heavenly realm is not imperfection
[40:14] because when daniel was praying in the
[40:16] book of daniel he was calling for a
[40:18] revelation
[40:19] on on these 70 weeks that jeremiah spoke
[40:22] of
[40:22] amen and god had dispatched gabriel to
[40:25] come to him
[40:26] but gabriel could not get to him because
[40:28] the prince of the power of persia
[40:30] withstood him
[40:31] so he had to return and get michael and
[40:33] michael would come
[40:34] where is this taking place in the
[40:35] heavenlies
[40:37] in the heavenly dimension in the
[40:39] heavenly realms
[40:40] amen all of this warfare is taking place
[40:43] where they're resisting gabriel
[40:44] you would think gabriel could just walk
[40:46] right in and do whatever he wanted
[40:49] but there's something that's happened in
[40:51] the heavenlies
[40:53] there's a scar
[40:58] even the apostle paul says we wore not
[41:00] with flesh and blood
[41:02] but against principalities and powers in
[41:05] heavenly places
[41:08] so there's a warfare there's a
[41:09] resistance there's there's a fighting
[41:11] that is going on
[41:12] in the heavenlies
[41:16] so you think well that was now flawed
[41:20] so god will now come down to the earth
[41:22] and begin to bring his eden his paradise
[41:26] the creation that's in his mind
[41:30] and the same thing that happened in
[41:31] heaven now takes place on earth
[41:34] there was a weakness created in a vessel
[41:37] amen in the
[41:38] the the uh the devil comes in through
[41:40] the serpent he exploits that weakness
[41:43] and and by free choice she opens the
[41:45] door she was made so that she could open
[41:47] the door
[41:49] and then a a corruption sets in
[41:52] a flaw a brokenness comes into the image
[41:55] of god
[41:57] and now you would think as a human being
[42:00] we would say
[42:01] why did he do it he should have learned
[42:04] what happened in heaven
[42:07] god should have known better look at
[42:09] what happened in heaven
[42:10] and now it's happened again on earth oh
[42:13] poor god
[42:17] that's how humans think but in this age
[42:20] we've been
[42:21] lifted above human reasoning we've been
[42:23] lifted out of carnal understanding
[42:25] we've been lifted out of denominational
[42:27] fairy tales and story books
[42:29] amen and nursery rhymes we've been
[42:30] lifted into a realm where you can see
[42:32] it wasn't poor god god had a plan in the
[42:35] lamb's book of life from before the
[42:37] foundation of the world
[42:38] and he's working his plan he's building
[42:40] his masterpiece
[42:41] and it looks like but if it's ruined
[42:43] it's not ruined amen
[42:45] it has to go this way for the next step
[42:54] brother branham in marriage and divorce
[42:56] he refers to the way
[42:58] that the woman was made
[43:01] he said he didn't make her like that in
[43:03] the beginning like the rest of his
[43:05] females because it wouldn't be
[43:06] it would be unbecoming to him he is the
[43:08] fountain of all purity
[43:11] that's the reason he had to let satan
[43:12] get a hold of her what he had done in
[43:14] the perversion
[43:15] such a creature would be would not be
[43:17] becoming to him originally designed for
[43:19] him
[43:21] all his works that he designed and the
[43:23] original is in continuation
[43:26] continuity all of his original works was
[43:30] in continuity the female dog the male
[43:31] dog
[43:32] female kale the mountain male cow
[43:34] everything in continuity all nature is
[43:36] in continuity
[43:37] seed die go in the ground just like
[43:39] death burial resurrection the sap goes
[43:40] down out of the tree
[43:42] drops its leave off comes back the next
[43:43] year with resurrection of new life see
[43:45] what i mean
[43:46] everything even nature of god is all
[43:48] continuity
[43:49] in one and here is one designed out of
[43:52] the continuity of god
[43:54] nature is so designed so it can't send
[43:56] think
[43:57] the original creation of god could not
[43:59] sin
[44:00] oh don't you see it now in this view
[44:02] here the perversion of the church the
[44:04] original is the word
[44:05] he's bringing it right back to the
[44:06] church the original is the word but the
[44:08] byproduct that come off the word
[44:10] after calvary amen the devil could get
[44:13] to that
[44:14] and corrupt that
[44:17] so he's showing us the same story he's
[44:20] actually teaching us the seven church
[44:21] ages
[44:23] there is no sin in god see what i mean
[44:26] here is a creature that came into
[44:27] existence by a perversion
[44:29] god is going to have a church but look
[44:31] at his perverted thing that got out
[44:33] here god has male and female but this
[44:36] woman see the very symptoms if it shows
[44:38] back
[44:38] that was in god's mind he could take an
[44:41] hour or two and break that down
[44:44] oh my
[44:48] he said listen i'm going to repeat that
[44:50] sentence sentence but this woman see the
[44:52] very symptoms of it shows
[44:54] back what was in god's mind
[44:57] the very way he made her and what
[44:59] happened shows what was back in god's
[45:02] mind
[45:03] he didn't make a mistake
[45:07] did he allow his image to be flawed yes
[45:09] was it a mistake
[45:10] no praise god
[45:14] he said we could take an hour to and
[45:16] break that down
[45:18] she made this creature for that way
[45:21] he she made this creature for that way
[45:24] he made the creature and
[45:26] turned her so satan could get a hold of
[45:29] her
[45:29] and he did god her matter made
[45:32] god didn't turn her over to satan god
[45:35] didn't make her
[45:36] god made her i this is the only way i
[45:38] know to say it so it's a
[45:39] it's a simple way to say it but god made
[45:41] her with a door that could be open but
[45:42] god didn't make her with an open door
[45:47] because god didn't make corruption god
[45:49] did not make evil
[45:50] amen what god made was perfect and what
[45:52] god made was good
[45:54] amen and that door could have stayed
[45:56] shut by free moral agency could have
[45:57] stayed shut forever
[46:00] but god knew he had already foresaw he
[46:02] knew what would happen
[46:03] so god he he sent her down
[46:06] with a weakness with a door that could
[46:08] be open but he put a good latch on it
[46:14] and he gave her the word and if she
[46:17] would have stayed with the word that
[46:18] door would have stayed latched
[46:23] the devil couldn't turn that latch
[46:28] she was the only one that could turn it
[46:32] god wouldn't even turn that latch
[46:35] because god can't make anything
[46:36] corrupted
[46:39] she had to do it of her own free choice
[46:44] so god turned her
[46:47] so satan could get a hold of her and he
[46:50] did
[46:53] i think we come to the conclusion now
[46:55] that god didn't make a mistake
[47:00] see if we don't have this understanding
[47:02] that the
[47:03] that has come through this prophetic
[47:04] ministry in this day
[47:07] then we look back at the garden of eden
[47:10] through denominational fairy tales
[47:14] and you think the devil is really strong
[47:16] and he keeps tripping up god
[47:21] that devil he's crafty he's wise
[47:24] he's strong and he keeps tripping up god
[47:30] but when you come to the revelation of
[47:32] the hour you realize that god is
[47:34] further entangling the devil and further
[47:37] ensnaring the devil
[47:38] and further ensnaring the devil until
[47:40] god's finally done and got him so
[47:42] tied up that his doom and his damnation
[47:45] is so complete
[47:46] that when god flips the switch it's
[47:48] finished
[47:51] he's bringing him in he's getting him
[47:53] closer he's putting him
[47:55] further into the trap deeper in
[47:59] with every mar and every strike and
[48:01] every flaw and every failure
[48:04] he's bringing him in a little closer
[48:14] so we know
[48:17] there was a flaw
[48:21] in the garden of eden brother branham
[48:23] said the masterpiece now lay
[48:25] in ruin
[48:30] and god wasn't going to let it stay that
[48:32] way he went right to work to rebuild it
[48:37] the truth is god was waiting for this to
[48:40] happen
[48:42] so that he can move to the next step in
[48:45] his masterpiece in the message the
[48:48] masterpiece he says and as
[48:49] he began to work upon creeping things
[48:52] like the little animals upon the earth
[48:54] and then he began to bring it from that
[48:56] into something else higher
[48:57] then finally he brought it into the
[48:58] larger animals such as the lion tiger
[49:00] bear
[49:01] then he brought into the type of maybe
[49:02] monkeys apes and so forth
[49:04] now not an evolution as we think one
[49:06] come from
[49:07] that was a complete creation god working
[49:09] in a pattern
[49:10] but finally there come forth upon the
[49:12] earth of perfection
[49:13] and that was a man and when he could see
[49:16] in that man that it looked like him
[49:18] so now when he looked upon him he was a
[49:20] reflection of what his creator was
[49:22] god had now been able to achieve the
[49:24] thing that he wanted a man in his own
[49:26] image
[49:27] and when i might say to this that when
[49:30] he made this man
[49:31] there was something about him yet that
[49:33] didn't look just right
[49:35] because that he was by himself and
[49:36] that's how god had been by himself
[49:38] and he was eternal and the man now in
[49:40] the image of god
[49:41] also exists on the earth by himself
[49:45] so he must have struck a little blow
[49:47] over on his left side
[49:48] and from there he took the peace that
[49:50] struck off of it and made him a help
[49:52] made a wife
[49:53] then he wasn't by himself he had
[49:55] somebody with him
[49:57] and that's his great work and he as
[50:00] any sculptor would take his masterpiece
[50:02] now
[50:03] first he had a masterpiece of himself
[50:05] and now see the masterpiece was lonesome
[50:07] like he was so he divided the
[50:09] masterpiece
[50:10] by striking in the side and brought
[50:12] forth to help me
[50:13] so he had a masterpiece that masterpiece
[50:16] was a man like himself
[50:18] but he struck the masterpiece and flawed
[50:20] it and broke it so that he could make
[50:21] another masterpiece
[50:25] that was not a devaluation of the first
[50:27] masterpiece
[50:28] but within that masterpiece was another
[50:30] masterpiece hidden
[50:33] and he had to strike it he had to break
[50:35] it to bring out the further expression
[50:37] of the masterpiece
[50:42] now to make the two one he put them like
[50:46] any great sculptor in a place that's
[50:47] beautiful a sculptor
[50:49] wouldn't make a great masterpiece and
[50:51] then take it and set it in an alley
[50:52] somewhere
[50:53] are hidden behind buildings as our lord
[50:55] told us
[50:56] a man doesn't light a candle and put it
[50:58] under a bushel now listen to this
[51:00] statement he slips in because this is
[51:02] one of those that just triggered
[51:03] thoughts in me
[51:04] said when we become god's masterpieces
[51:08] we're becoming god's masterpieces
[51:12] so there's masterpiece works that are
[51:14] continuing to go on
[51:16] when we become god's masterpieces we're
[51:17] not hidden in an alley somewhere
[51:19] we must give light so we're going to
[51:22] move on we'll come back to that
[51:23] statement
[51:24] in a few minutes so we see that he after
[51:26] he had made this masterpiece he placed
[51:28] it up
[51:29] here on the earth and put it in the most
[51:30] beautiful place there was in the garden
[51:32] of eden
[51:32] he placed his masterpiece of two being
[51:34] one in the garden of eden how
[51:36] it must have pleased him that he saw his
[51:38] masterpiece was well
[51:39] we find out that he rested he was so
[51:41] well pleased with his work
[51:43] now remember that my opinion listen to
[51:46] what brother brahms is going to say now
[51:47] just
[51:48] catch it he's talking about god he just
[51:50] made the statement he made the one he
[51:52] broke him
[51:53] a piece off and made the other made his
[51:55] great masterpiece of two being one set
[51:57] him in a beautiful place somewhere not
[51:58] an alley but
[51:59] in eden he was so satisfied that he took
[52:01] his rest now brother ben's going to
[52:02] inject the thought
[52:04] now remember that my opinion the
[52:07] masterpiece is the stroke
[52:11] the masterpiece is the stroke that
[52:14] married saint angelo's moses masterpiece
[52:16] in the monument so what's he saying
[52:20] that the masterpiece is the stroke the
[52:22] stroke's what makes it what it is
[52:24] and there's going to come a stroke a
[52:26] blow to this masterpiece
[52:28] but there has to come that blow to that
[52:30] masterpiece
[52:31] that's what makes it the masterpiece
[52:35] you say brother chad what are you saying
[52:37] you're saying the fall the fall of man
[52:39] the ruination of mankind the sin and the
[52:42] fall amen it was the stroke that made it
[52:44] the masterpiece
[52:45] it was the stroke that made it the
[52:46] masterpiece because remember when the
[52:49] woman was formed
[52:50] before she was formed there was a lamb
[52:52] slain from before the foundation of the
[52:53] world
[52:54] there was attributes that was locked
[52:55] inside of god that had to be expressed
[52:58] so absolutely the blow the strike the
[53:00] fall
[53:01] is the masterpiece makes it what it is
[53:04] because that
[53:04] unlocked attributes of god that can
[53:07] start going into display
[53:10] a whole set of characteristics and
[53:12] nature of god
[53:13] was locked up oh
[53:16] what are you saying brother that i'm
[53:18] saying what the prophet of god has come
[53:20] to teach us that when god dwelled alone
[53:22] with himself
[53:23] elohim amen was locked inside of him a
[53:26] million billion trillion attributes
[53:30] things he wanted to express and desire
[53:32] and there alone by himself
[53:34] he was not having expression so the
[53:36] first thing he did
[53:37] in order to express himself is god he
[53:40] creates angels so that they can worship
[53:41] him what's he doing he's expressing
[53:44] what's in the mastermind of the master
[53:46] builder
[53:49] but he had more in him than to be god
[53:52] because there was also a father
[53:56] there was also a warrior a conqueror
[54:02] a mighty one so he would
[54:05] create a michael
[54:09] because in him was a conqueror
[54:12] a mighty one a great warrior so he would
[54:15] create a michael
[54:16] and michael now was going to be the
[54:18] conqueror the mighty one the great
[54:19] warrior angel of god
[54:22] but he was going to be hidden in
[54:23] humility
[54:28] and then he was going to create another
[54:30] one which are going to be lucifer
[54:32] and lucifer was built in a way that he
[54:34] could self-corrupt
[54:37] and in his self-corruption he would
[54:39] begin to look at michael
[54:41] and not realize that there lays a power
[54:44] an attribute of god in angelic form
[54:47] there lays a
[54:48] conqueror a mighty one a powerful angel
[54:50] he couldn't see it amen with the
[54:52] intellect wisdom reasoning that he had
[54:54] all he could see was the humility
[54:56] but god had placed attributes down in
[54:58] michael that had to be expressed in
[54:59] order to express
[55:00] that there was an angel that had to fall
[55:04] so that war could break out in heaven so
[55:06] that god could express himself
[55:13] is it a bad thing or a good thing it
[55:15] just depends on which side you're on
[55:19] it depends on how you look at this
[55:20] brother better says don't be
[55:22] children anymore this is the end time
[55:24] this isn't for childish observation
[55:27] i mean when we were children our parents
[55:28] would do things that we did not
[55:30] understand
[55:30] decisions they made that made absolutely
[55:32] no sense to us they
[55:34] would forbid us from activities that
[55:35] look like nothing but pure pleasure and
[55:37] fun
[55:39] when you're a child you're like what's
[55:40] wrong with dad he's there's something
[55:42] wrong with dad
[55:43] he just doesn't get it
[55:46] he won't let me jump off the house with
[55:48] my handmade parachute he won't let me
[55:51] see if i can skip my four-wheeler across
[55:53] the pond he what's wrong with dad
[55:57] but then you grew up and you're like boy
[55:58] i'm thankful for dad he kept me alive
[56:03] and we had childish understanding of god
[56:06] childish understanding of the heavenly
[56:08] realm childish understanding
[56:10] and i'm not saying we have adult
[56:11] understanding but brother bam is calling
[56:13] us to have adult understanding he's
[56:14] saying stop being children this is the
[56:16] end time
[56:18] god releasing his mind releasing his
[56:21] nature
[56:22] releasing in the opening of the seven
[56:24] seals friends it wasn't just about
[56:26] information
[56:27] it was the very plan of god the very
[56:29] desire
[56:30] nature plan concept of god was now being
[56:34] pulled back amen so that you could see
[56:36] his original pencil sketch
[56:38] and then you could see this is his
[56:40] masterpiece everything's ticking just
[56:42] right on time
[56:43] nothing's out of kilter there's nothing
[56:45] wrong with what god's doing
[56:50] god's calling for us to be not children
[56:53] anymore
[56:55] but to understand
[57:01] i'm continuing on in this masterpiece
[57:03] quote
[57:05] with this thought now remember
[57:08] that my opinion the masterpiece is the
[57:11] stroke
[57:12] that marred it
[57:18] and it was the stroke that cut the side
[57:20] of the masterpiece that brought out the
[57:22] bride
[57:23] and now we see him as a masterpiece
[57:24] family in the garden of eden
[57:26] how beautiful was that it so pleased him
[57:29] until he took his rest but while he was
[57:32] resting and trusting to his masterpiece
[57:34] his enemy came in and found his great
[57:35] masterpiece
[57:36] and by deceit he crawls under the garden
[57:38] walls and he marred this beautiful
[57:40] masterpiece he marred it
[57:42] so that it fell now notice then this
[57:45] masterpiece
[57:46] when satan got a hold of it the deceiver
[57:48] broke through the walls and he marred
[57:51] this masterpiece because that's the way
[57:53] he did it
[57:54] how did he do it it'll go more in the
[57:56] details of that the masterpiece was
[57:58] walled by the word god's word and the
[58:00] masterpiece itself of the family was
[58:02] fortified by his word
[58:04] but the broken part that was broke off
[58:06] of the original
[58:08] you catch that the broken part that was
[58:10] broke off the original
[58:13] that's what he's going after the broken
[58:15] part
[58:16] that was broke off the original went out
[58:19] beyond that wall it gives satan a chance
[58:22] tomorrow and now as you know what i
[58:24] believe on those things
[58:25] so i won't have to say that but the
[58:27] masterpiece was broken
[58:29] but the great sculptor when he seen the
[58:31] fall of his family the masterpiece he
[58:33] wasn't willing just to leave it lay
[58:34] there face down and ruin
[58:36] he went to work immediately to build it
[58:38] up again
[58:39] he wasn't willing that it should perish
[58:41] lay there like that all the time
[58:43] because he is god and he will not be
[58:45] defeated so he went to work immediately
[58:47] and began to build again
[58:48] into his own image a man
[58:52] we know that he built that image and
[58:55] that image of that man that he rebuilt
[58:56] was jesus christ
[58:57] amen but he struck him too and he broke
[59:00] him
[59:01] and he took a broken piece off of him
[59:03] and the broken piece off of him
[59:05] is what the devil came to because it
[59:07] could not break him
[59:09] he was an original creation he was an
[59:12] original spoken word creation of god
[59:15] he could not be broken but broke off of
[59:17] him
[59:18] come another part which was the bride
[59:19] the church and that's the part that the
[59:21] devil focused on again
[59:29] he says in the identified masterpiece of
[59:31] god and now what made him
[59:33] to me the masterpiece to me and to you
[59:35] is because god smote him
[59:37] he smote him at calvary if he hadn't
[59:39] smitten no matter how many
[59:41] dead he had raised how great he had
[59:43] preached what his great life was what
[59:45] his claims was
[59:46] he was proven there he was so pleased
[59:48] god was until he was the only man that
[59:50] ever stood on the face of the earth
[59:52] that god could smite for the rest of
[59:54] them all
[59:56] that perfect one was smitten for the
[59:57] imperfect the whole creation
[59:59] that had fell through adam it was
[1:00:01] redeemed through jesus christ god's
[1:00:03] masterpiece
[1:00:04] has stood the test how did he do it
[1:00:07] by the word it is written man shall not
[1:00:10] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:00:12] that proceeds
[1:00:13] out of the mouth of god
[1:00:16] back to the masterpiece message
[1:00:18] paragraph 78 he says
[1:00:20] god when he looked upon him
[1:00:24] he was so inspired he to see him the way
[1:00:28] he looked
[1:00:29] and see the form of him he was so
[1:00:30] inspired that it would be the perfect
[1:00:32] masterpiece of a redeemer jesus the
[1:00:34] redeemer
[1:00:35] so god in order to be smitten himself
[1:00:40] who's being smitten now god
[1:00:44] god in order to be smitten himself
[1:00:47] because to pay his own penalty god and
[1:00:49] christ become one
[1:00:51] so god could be smote in the image he
[1:00:54] could be scarred
[1:00:59] god made himself a body
[1:01:02] called it son but a body he could live
[1:01:04] in so that he could be smote
[1:01:07] so that he could be scarred
[1:01:11] you say scar god don't forget it's the
[1:01:14] scar that makes it the masterpiece
[1:01:17] the scar is what makes it what it was
[1:01:20] god came down
[1:01:21] so that he could be scarred so out of
[1:01:24] the scar
[1:01:25] could come the rest of his attributes
[1:01:30] now i wanna i wanna
[1:01:34] lay that as a foundation as a big
[1:01:35] picture but i to
[1:01:37] dive down a little bit and get to the
[1:01:39] the smaller picture of you and i
[1:01:42] because we see now what god's done in
[1:01:45] his plan of redemption and the plan that
[1:01:47] he had
[1:01:47] how all of these seeming falls and
[1:01:51] strokes and and uh uh images falling
[1:01:55] into ruin
[1:01:55] how it all looks like disasters but not
[1:01:58] one of it is a disaster in god's plan of
[1:02:00] redemption it's all
[1:02:01] one's moving to the next to the next and
[1:02:03] it's moving god's plan of redemption
[1:02:05] right now
[1:02:06] remember god had a masterpiece creation
[1:02:12] and he had that in adam he had a
[1:02:14] masterpiece
[1:02:15] family when he separated him and brought
[1:02:18] the two together but don't forget he has
[1:02:21] a masterpiece redemption too
[1:02:25] and all of these are playing into the
[1:02:27] masterpiece redemption
[1:02:29] picture that he's painting the thing
[1:02:32] that he's fashioning
[1:02:37] it's as if you look at a a great work of
[1:02:41] art or you look at a wall that's
[1:02:43] all sculpted and it tells a narrative it
[1:02:45] tells a story
[1:02:47] but if you look down each sculpture each
[1:02:50] each thing portrays another part of that
[1:02:52] story and then and you have this image
[1:02:54] and that image
[1:02:55] has a story then you go down the wall
[1:02:58] and the next image has a story and the
[1:02:59] next one has a story and the next one
[1:03:01] has a story
[1:03:02] you can get hung up on one story and say
[1:03:04] well that's a tragic story
[1:03:06] but that story leads to the next story
[1:03:08] leads to the next story and by the time
[1:03:09] you get down
[1:03:10] and you look at the whole mural of all
[1:03:12] these sculptures that god has made
[1:03:14] all these masks and each one of them was
[1:03:16] a masterpiece moses was a masterpiece
[1:03:20] but he was flawed is that right
[1:03:23] jeremiah was a masterpiece but flawed
[1:03:25] isaiah was a masterpiece but flawed
[1:03:26] david was a masterpiece but was flawed
[1:03:30] and you could hang up on one and say oh
[1:03:33] the artist
[1:03:34] oh how could he allow this flaw and this
[1:03:36] failure and how could god
[1:03:38] uh tell a story and paint a picture and
[1:03:40] have a bad breaststroke there and have a
[1:03:43] a marred spot there and how when we read
[1:03:46] the bible
[1:03:47] it's not perfect amen it's not perfect
[1:03:49] in the way man thinks is perfect but
[1:03:51] when god looks down at this word he says
[1:03:52] it's perfect the way i
[1:03:54] think of perfect because you could just
[1:03:57] go to one character in moses and say
[1:03:59] well
[1:04:00] what a failure noah after he had had
[1:04:02] faith and he had survived
[1:04:04] uh the the flood and he had a great
[1:04:06] testimony then he's found drunk and
[1:04:08] there's a corruption that sets in
[1:04:09] because of his drunkenness and his
[1:04:10] family
[1:04:12] what a disaster what a disaster and
[1:04:15] we're looking what a disaster
[1:04:16] amen you go to another image and you
[1:04:19] begin to look at the image of david and
[1:04:20] how david was a man after god's own
[1:04:22] heart
[1:04:23] and how perfect but he has this
[1:04:25] temptation with bathsheba
[1:04:26] and has a man murdered and takes the
[1:04:28] wife of uriah and
[1:04:30] oh what a disaster in the baby that is
[1:04:32] born of that conception dies
[1:04:35] what is happening god what are you doing
[1:04:40] but i'm so thankful we live in a day
[1:04:42] amen we're the prophet of god he could
[1:04:44] show you all the details on the wall
[1:04:46] you could look at it all and he says now
[1:04:47] back up
[1:04:49] back up lift out of the barnyard spread
[1:04:52] your wings amen those old and new
[1:04:54] testament get a little higher until you
[1:04:56] can see the whole picture
[1:04:57] and when you see the whole picture you
[1:04:58] say it's perfect it's perfect it's
[1:05:00] perfect it's perfect
[1:05:01] it's perfect because he had one story to
[1:05:05] tell
[1:05:06] one goal he wanted to achieve and all
[1:05:08] the characters in the bible were types
[1:05:10] and shadows pointing to this one thing
[1:05:12] that god wanted to achieve
[1:05:16] i'm so thankful to be alive in this day
[1:05:20] i am so thankful amen that we don't have
[1:05:23] coloring book of the old testament and
[1:05:25] that's all we know about it but it came
[1:05:27] in the vivid life amen
[1:05:28] we begin to see that my story is wrapped
[1:05:31] up in their story amen
[1:05:34] everything god's doing he's been showing
[1:05:36] what he's doing and he's doing what he's
[1:05:37] been showing
[1:05:40] one leads to the next leads to the next
[1:05:42] leads to the next and they're all
[1:05:44] marred they're all scarred they all have
[1:05:46] a flaw because it's the flaw that makes
[1:05:48] it the masterpiece
[1:05:50] and when you understand what the
[1:05:52] masterpiece is then you begin to
[1:05:54] understand why it's the flaw
[1:05:56] that makes the masterpiece because the
[1:05:58] masterpiece is redemption
[1:06:01] and you can't have redemption without a
[1:06:03] flaw you can't have redemption without a
[1:06:05] scar
[1:06:06] there has to be a scar to have
[1:06:07] redemption there has to be a fall
[1:06:09] to have redemption and god's great plan
[1:06:12] is redemption
[1:06:18] so that he can show his attributes so
[1:06:21] that the artist can show
[1:06:23] all that was in his mind all that he
[1:06:25] conceived before the foundation
[1:06:27] everything that was in him is coming out
[1:06:29] in this work of art
[1:06:34] i come to this quote here in masterpiece
[1:06:38] when i was
[1:06:39] meditating on it and it just struck me
[1:06:42] and this is what i want to spend a few
[1:06:43] minutes on now
[1:06:46] now watch every masterpiece is put on a
[1:06:48] foundation a sculpture
[1:06:50] angelo's monument of moses is on a three
[1:06:52] or four foot piece of marble
[1:06:54] he begins to talk about the four corner
[1:06:57] foundation and it being the patriarchs
[1:06:59] of abraham
[1:07:00] isaac jacob and joseph but he's going to
[1:07:03] get to joseph start talking about joseph
[1:07:04] he says abraham
[1:07:05] was faith isaac was love represented
[1:07:08] love amen
[1:07:09] and then jacob represented grace because
[1:07:11] he was the supplanter the shyster
[1:07:13] and then he gets to joseph his
[1:07:14] perfection and listen what he says
[1:07:18] said abraham portrayed christ of course
[1:07:20] so did isaac in love abraham did in
[1:07:22] faith isaac didn't love jacob did in his
[1:07:24] grace
[1:07:25] because jacob means deceiver and that's
[1:07:26] what he was but god's grace was with him
[1:07:29] but when it come to joseph there was
[1:07:30] nothing against him
[1:07:33] just one little scratch for the
[1:07:37] foundation must also
[1:07:39] be a masterpiece
[1:07:43] are you catching it he didn't say
[1:07:47] joseph was perfection he was all perfect
[1:07:49] and that's what made it a masterpiece he
[1:07:50] said no
[1:07:51] all but one little scratch
[1:07:56] one little scratch for the foundation
[1:07:59] must also be a masterpiece
[1:08:01] when he told his father the prophet say
[1:08:03] to your pharaoh say to pharaoh
[1:08:05] that your people are cattle raisers not
[1:08:07] shepherds because a shepherd is an
[1:08:08] abomination in egypt
[1:08:10] but when the old prophet god before
[1:08:12] pharaoh he said your servants are
[1:08:13] herdsmen so
[1:08:14] it scratched it see that's
[1:08:18] why it still makes it the masterpiece
[1:08:27] if joseph had been perfect he wouldn't
[1:08:28] need redemption
[1:08:32] if joseph hadn't had that scratch that
[1:08:35] flaw
[1:08:37] he wouldn't know god as a forgiving
[1:08:40] father
[1:08:42] he wouldn't know god as a redeemer and
[1:08:44] as a savior
[1:08:45] he wouldn't know how powerful the blood
[1:08:48] is to wash away all sins
[1:08:51] there would be so much of god that
[1:08:54] joseph if he didn't have the scratch
[1:08:56] wouldn't understand but it was that
[1:08:59] scratch that little scratch that still
[1:09:01] made it the masterpiece
[1:09:02] it still had to be a masterpiece so it
[1:09:04] still had to have a scratch
[1:09:09] think about this god so wanted to be
[1:09:11] identified
[1:09:12] with his creation that he would form a
[1:09:14] spoken word body
[1:09:16] and come and dwell in that body and in
[1:09:18] that body would be the blood
[1:09:20] of god it would be the body that god
[1:09:21] created to dwell in
[1:09:23] and he would be scarred in that body
[1:09:26] because
[1:09:26] he's also a masterpiece
[1:09:30] and all of his masterpiece is scarred
[1:09:32] and even
[1:09:33] god and his fleshly body is scarred
[1:09:38] there's a theme here
[1:09:42] and i want to take a look at our lives
[1:09:44] for just a few minutes
[1:09:46] and the message things that are to be
[1:09:47] the prophet of god says you know
[1:09:49] i've always been considered on account
[1:09:51] of they call me a woman hater
[1:09:54] and i'm not i don't like him moral
[1:09:57] indecent i like real genuine sisters of
[1:09:58] christ
[1:09:59] that way all right i had some scars when
[1:10:02] i was a kid
[1:10:05] i know things that happened that's kind
[1:10:07] of turned me on that way
[1:10:10] but it was all god making and molding me
[1:10:12] for this hour
[1:10:16] when brother branham could look back
[1:10:17] over his life he could see scars
[1:10:22] he could look back over his ministry and
[1:10:24] he could see scars
[1:10:27] rejection as a child he could see the
[1:10:31] scars
[1:10:32] of what he saw taking place at his
[1:10:34] father's moonshine still and the women
[1:10:36] laying out all night married women and
[1:10:38] living in it scarred him
[1:10:42] and he would say harsh things about
[1:10:44] immoral women never about sisters he had
[1:10:46] up most respect for them but
[1:10:48] about harsh things and he says i know
[1:10:50] that i had some scars as a kid that
[1:10:52] turned me that way
[1:10:53] but look at brother brenham now not
[1:10:55] regretting his scars
[1:10:56] not wishing them away not blaming them
[1:10:59] for anything
[1:11:00] he said that's what turned me that way
[1:11:02] he says but listen he says
[1:11:04] it was all god
[1:11:08] making molding me for this hour
[1:11:14] he could look back at the scars of
[1:11:16] poverty
[1:11:17] the scars of rejection due to his
[1:11:20] family's poverty and his dad's
[1:11:21] alcoholism
[1:11:22] scars of getting the wrong ideas about
[1:11:25] women that had to be corrected by seeing
[1:11:27] godly women
[1:11:28] scars scars scars scars and ministry by
[1:11:32] rejection of ministers and false
[1:11:34] accusations
[1:11:35] and he said sometimes he said i think
[1:11:37] i'm all cut up on the inside
[1:11:41] from a lot of hard battles but he didn't
[1:11:44] say
[1:11:45] i wish i didn't have him i wish that
[1:11:47] didn't happen to me
[1:11:48] because remember it's the scar that
[1:11:50] makes the masterpiece
[1:11:53] even god come down to be scarred to be
[1:11:56] in the masterpiece
[1:12:00] every one of us are scarred
[1:12:03] we're scarred by the fall
[1:12:07] do you believe that by what took place
[1:12:08] at the garden of eden you're scarred
[1:12:11] if you want to see your scar just lift
[1:12:12] your shirt and look at your belly button
[1:12:14] not now but when you get home
[1:12:19] you have a mark there that now you've
[1:12:22] come because of what took place
[1:12:24] everyone that's born that way outside of
[1:12:26] christ now
[1:12:27] is is born into corruption
[1:12:32] you're marked with wrong thinking marked
[1:12:35] we've been marked with wrong teaching
[1:12:37] we've had we
[1:12:38] we are scarred by things other people
[1:12:40] have done to us
[1:12:43] we are scarred by things we've done to
[1:12:45] us
[1:12:48] we're scarred by what parents have done
[1:12:50] uncles and aunts
[1:12:51] we're scarred by what other church
[1:12:53] members have done
[1:12:55] is that right
[1:12:58] we have we have scars
[1:13:03] we've stood up and we've fallen back
[1:13:05] down
[1:13:08] walked a few steps and fallen back down
[1:13:12] is that true i hope i'm not the only one
[1:13:15] run for a little bit then trip and fall
[1:13:17] back down and get marred again
[1:13:19] get broken again get scarred again
[1:13:24] and you think if only god would have
[1:13:26] kept me from that if only god would have
[1:13:28] in my childhood not allowed that abuse
[1:13:30] not allowed that neglect
[1:13:31] not allowed if only god would have
[1:13:33] stopped me from seeing that it would
[1:13:34] have never started this
[1:13:36] addiction in my life if only god would
[1:13:39] have kept me from that first puff
[1:13:40] why didn't god stop that
[1:13:45] why didn't god let me be born in a
[1:13:46] different house why couldn't i have a
[1:13:48] different home
[1:13:49] why couldn't i have a different mother
[1:13:50] and a different father it would have
[1:13:51] been so different for me
[1:13:52] if god would have come on brother
[1:13:57] if god would have just stopped me god
[1:13:59] why don't you stop me from sin
[1:14:04] listen when you really fly a little
[1:14:06] higher
[1:14:08] you realize it's the scar that makes the
[1:14:10] masterpiece
[1:14:12] it's the stroke it's the fall because if
[1:14:14] you lived a perfect life
[1:14:16] not even joseph was allowed to get
[1:14:18] through without a scratch
[1:14:19] i mean because the scratch would require
[1:14:21] redemption and redemption was an
[1:14:23] attribute that was locked inside of god
[1:14:25] in this whole story he's been telling is
[1:14:27] a story of redemption
[1:14:28] because he's a god who wants to be
[1:14:30] expressed he's a god who wants to be
[1:14:31] known
[1:14:32] he's an artist who's expressing in all
[1:14:34] of his windy work he's expressing
[1:14:36] himself in it all
[1:14:41] when you come to a realization that
[1:14:44] all of this was for a purpose
[1:14:49] the the the being drug from pillar to
[1:14:52] post and
[1:14:53] marriages and divorces and a messed up
[1:14:57] childhood and a messed up adulthood and
[1:15:01] a messed up mind and this and that you
[1:15:04] can
[1:15:04] you can just take your own story and you
[1:15:08] can
[1:15:08] fill in all your own scratches your own
[1:15:11] scars
[1:15:13] and you can see oh if that wouldn't have
[1:15:15] happened i wouldn't be dealing with this
[1:15:16] issue now
[1:15:19] is that right yes if only i hadn't had
[1:15:22] this
[1:15:22] i wouldn't have this i'd like to say if
[1:15:26] you didn't have that you wouldn't know
[1:15:27] christ
[1:15:30] brother branham was talking one time
[1:15:32] about his nervous tension that he had he
[1:15:34] had it since he was a child
[1:15:35] he said oh i've thought so long if i
[1:15:36] could just get free of this nervousness
[1:15:38] but then i begin to think
[1:15:41] this nervousness is a blessing
[1:15:44] why would i be without this tension
[1:15:46] without tension he said you would just
[1:15:48] fly loose it's the tension that holds
[1:15:49] you together
[1:15:50] and he says it's this tension that drove
[1:15:52] me to christ
[1:15:59] it's the scars that make redemption
[1:16:02] beautiful
[1:16:05] it's the scars that make calvary
[1:16:10] so precious
[1:16:14] it's the scars that make what the
[1:16:17] prophet teaches us
[1:16:19] so powerful
[1:16:23] i wish brother ben could have wished he
[1:16:25] was born in a wealthy family he could
[1:16:26] have wished he was born to
[1:16:28] a non-alcoholic dad he could have wished
[1:16:29] that he was born and had gotten an
[1:16:31] education he could have wished he could
[1:16:32] wished and could have wished and
[1:16:33] couldn't wish
[1:16:34] but we look at brother branham's life
[1:16:35] and we say i can't feel sorry for you
[1:16:37] because everything that you suffered
[1:16:38] with was for me
[1:16:41] it was to display christ to me you look
[1:16:44] at brother brennan's life and you don't
[1:16:45] look at a messed up life and you don't
[1:16:47] look at a failure
[1:16:48] you look at a masterpiece do any of you
[1:16:52] or is it just me
[1:16:52] you look at brother branham's life and
[1:16:54] you look at what he went through and you
[1:16:55] look at what god brought him to and you
[1:16:57] look at what the word did
[1:16:58] and you're looking at a masterpiece
[1:17:01] why is it that we can look at brother
[1:17:03] branham's life and see a masterpiece and
[1:17:05] we look at our life and all we see is
[1:17:06] ruin
[1:17:08] we can look at we can look at redemption
[1:17:10] in his life salvation in his life
[1:17:12] deliverance in his life we can look at
[1:17:14] what he was
[1:17:14] we could even look at his mistakes when
[1:17:16] he tried to get his wife
[1:17:17] amen to lie and you can look at him and
[1:17:21] say
[1:17:21] what beautiful humility but if you do
[1:17:24] the same thing and come to the same
[1:17:25] repentance all you can say is what a
[1:17:27] waste of human flesh
[1:17:33] but i'd like to say it's the scar that
[1:17:35] makes the masterpiece
[1:17:38] it was brother benham's failure under
[1:17:41] tension and under stress with the call
[1:17:43] of the lawyer that came in
[1:17:44] it was that failure that god would by
[1:17:47] the power of the holy ghost convict him
[1:17:49] and he would come back
[1:17:50] and make a repentance and he would
[1:17:52] repent for the people and explain what
[1:17:53] he had done and how he had failed god
[1:17:55] and i say that's a masterpiece but
[1:17:58] without the scratch
[1:18:01] is the masterpiece on full display
[1:18:05] do you get the full effect of the mind
[1:18:07] of the
[1:18:09] of the artist without the scratch
[1:18:17] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:18:19] ordered to the lord
[1:18:23] when he formed me in the womb he knew me
[1:18:26] all my members were written in this book
[1:18:28] when they were not yet
[1:18:29] fashioned are these true statements
[1:18:32] about you
[1:18:34] if they're true statements about you
[1:18:36] then he knows he knows what family you
[1:18:38] were born into
[1:18:39] he knows of the difficulty he knows
[1:18:42] about the dead loved one he knows about
[1:18:44] the abandonment he knows about the
[1:18:46] neglect
[1:18:46] he knows about the abuse he knows about
[1:18:48] your failure
[1:18:50] brother branham said there's certain
[1:18:52] failures amen there's certain failures
[1:18:54] that you carry a scar with you the rest
[1:18:55] of your life you can never erase it
[1:18:58] that's true certain things you do to
[1:19:00] your body and certain things you do with
[1:19:02] your body
[1:19:03] that you can be forgiven you can be
[1:19:04] justified in the sight of god but on
[1:19:07] this earth you can
[1:19:08] never erase some of those things you
[1:19:10] live with those scars the rest of your
[1:19:11] life
[1:19:13] brother branham he made a statement uh
[1:19:16] that i found fascinating back in 1951
[1:19:19] i'll just i'll just quote it to you i
[1:19:21] got to hear at the end of my notes
[1:19:24] he's talking about a husband and wife
[1:19:28] and he's talking about dealing with one
[1:19:30] another and not being rough with one
[1:19:32] another
[1:19:33] and when some person just won't give in
[1:19:35] just give in to him sometimes
[1:19:36] and he says it'll work its way out later
[1:19:40] and he says
[1:19:44] see if i can find it
[1:19:48] he says in here
[1:19:52] oh my computer's locked up he says
[1:19:56] i won't get a verbatim but you trust me
[1:19:57] right i'm not making it up
[1:20:01] he says there's a golden bowl
[1:20:04] of oil in the human heart
[1:20:09] he said it can be broken right
[1:20:12] it can be broken and it leaks out he
[1:20:15] said
[1:20:16] it can be healed but you'll always have
[1:20:19] a scar
[1:20:23] see when you come into this life as a
[1:20:24] child you've got that
[1:20:26] golden bowl of oil in the human heart
[1:20:31] is that true yes golden bowl of oil in
[1:20:35] the human heart
[1:20:37] and somewhere along the way it's been
[1:20:39] broken
[1:20:41] i don't know any of us that can say it's
[1:20:43] not been broken
[1:20:45] it's been broken we know what it's like
[1:20:47] for the heart to be broken
[1:20:48] and the oil to leak out
[1:20:52] but what the prophet said is that can be
[1:20:54] healed
[1:20:56] that can be healed it can be healed and
[1:20:59] it can hold oil again
[1:21:01] that's the most encouraging thing to me
[1:21:04] is it doesn't have to stay that way
[1:21:06] that heart can be healed and it can hold
[1:21:08] oil again
[1:21:10] but you'll always have a scar
[1:21:15] will you ever completely forget whatever
[1:21:17] happened to you no
[1:21:19] will will you never think back
[1:21:23] with regrets and never think back at the
[1:21:26] difficulties will it
[1:21:27] will it never will the scar go away
[1:21:30] no the scar is not going to go away
[1:21:34] but to me the scar is the masterpiece
[1:21:38] because the scar shows that there was a
[1:21:40] god that could heal that heart so it
[1:21:42] could hold oil again
[1:21:44] the scar is what shows god the scar is
[1:21:46] what shows the power of god
[1:21:48] the scar is what shows the ability of
[1:21:50] god to take what the devil tried to
[1:21:52] bring ruined to
[1:21:53] but god can bring a healing so that
[1:21:55] heart can hold that golden oil again
[1:21:57] and you can love and receive love and
[1:21:59] you can function as a christian as a
[1:22:01] believer
[1:22:01] because there's a god on this earth
[1:22:03] there's a redemption that's taking place
[1:22:05] there's a power of healing that's here
[1:22:10] let the scar be a masterpiece amen
[1:22:13] quit letting the devil take your scar
[1:22:16] and continue to bring ruination and can
[1:22:18] bring
[1:22:18] bring heartache and bring destruction
[1:22:20] amen that's not why it's there it's
[1:22:23] there to display
[1:22:24] the power of god and all the attributes
[1:22:26] of god to overcome everything that the
[1:22:28] devil has ever laid at the feet of god's
[1:22:30] children
[1:22:31] there is a power that has been released
[1:22:33] in this hour and that is the full power
[1:22:35] of the full word
[1:22:36] so that we can fly a little higher than
[1:22:38] the chicken yard a little higher than
[1:22:40] the fence post so we can get up and say
[1:22:42] it's all been god god knew the end from
[1:22:44] the beginning there's nothing out of
[1:22:46] kilter with god
[1:22:47] i'm not damaged good i'm a display of
[1:22:50] righteousness i'm a display of the power
[1:22:52] of god
[1:22:52] i'm a display of the handiwork of god
[1:22:57] it's the scar that makes the masterpiece
[1:23:01] you can say i don't want to have any
[1:23:02] problems nobody wants to have problems
[1:23:06] like i've got problems with my tablet i
[1:23:09] don't want to have any problems with my
[1:23:10] tablet
[1:23:12] but god
[1:23:16] god has made it so
[1:23:20] that the attributes that were locked
[1:23:22] inside of him
[1:23:24] can only be released
[1:23:28] when there's a scar
[1:23:32] the attributes that were locked inside
[1:23:34] of him
[1:23:36] were were released when there was a scar
[1:23:38] in heaven
[1:23:41] then he come down to earth and he made
[1:23:43] something that was beautiful
[1:23:46] you and i if we were given the option
[1:23:49] and god said what do you think
[1:23:51] now not now but if he would give us the
[1:23:53] option before we come to the message
[1:23:56] what do you think should i put the tree
[1:23:58] of knowledge of good and evil in the
[1:23:59] garden or not
[1:24:02] which choice would you make i said no
[1:24:04] don't take a chance
[1:24:06] and ain't worth the risk and he says
[1:24:09] there's no risk
[1:24:12] i'm not taking a chance there is no risk
[1:24:16] there's something in me i want my
[1:24:18] attributes to know
[1:24:19] there's something in me that has to be
[1:24:21] expressed there's something that i
[1:24:23] am that has to be manifested and i'm
[1:24:26] telling you if you
[1:24:26] if you wanted to be born in a flowery
[1:24:28] bed of ease and you want to be rocked in
[1:24:30] a gentle cradle all your life
[1:24:32] and never have to face ridicule never
[1:24:34] have to face rejection
[1:24:35] never fail of your own bad choices never
[1:24:37] have anybody else wound you to the point
[1:24:39] of scaring you
[1:24:40] i'm telling you you're going to miss out
[1:24:42] you are you're ruining
[1:24:44] god's picture you're ruining god's
[1:24:45] handiwork you're ruining god's piece of
[1:24:48] art
[1:24:52] remember brother man talks about the
[1:24:53] picture he does this so much friends
[1:24:55] it's amazing
[1:24:56] he said i look at this picture it was
[1:24:57] all storms and it was all clouds and it
[1:24:59] looked terrible it looked frightening
[1:25:01] it looked like a horrible scene they
[1:25:04] said you got to get closer
[1:25:06] it looked horrible it looked terrible it
[1:25:09] looked like it was a failure
[1:25:10] and as he got closer he began to see
[1:25:12] angel's wings
[1:25:14] and you get a little closer and you see
[1:25:16] it's the rejoicing and the gathering of
[1:25:18] angel it wasn't anything scary at all
[1:25:24] we look at our lives and think it was
[1:25:26] horrible it's not horrible friends
[1:25:30] if god has brought you as a
[1:25:33] predestinated seed gene of god and
[1:25:35] brought you to redemption
[1:25:37] brought you back in contact with himself
[1:25:40] through this word
[1:25:40] to be united with you then there was
[1:25:43] nothing wrong with it
[1:25:46] there's nothing wrong with it amen do
[1:25:48] you have regrets yes
[1:25:49] paul the apostle had regrets he was
[1:25:51] persecuting the christians
[1:25:53] but he as that persecuting force was
[1:25:55] actually accomplishing god's good
[1:25:57] by driving them out of jerusalem is that
[1:26:00] true
[1:26:01] the persecution got them out of
[1:26:02] jerusalem and they took the message with
[1:26:04] them wherever they went
[1:26:07] but when god called paul paul all the
[1:26:10] way over and
[1:26:10] in first corinthians 15 i believe it is
[1:26:13] he's still
[1:26:14] showing regret he said i'm not even
[1:26:15] worthy to be called an apostle because i
[1:26:17] persecuted the church and brother
[1:26:18] branham said
[1:26:19] he said he consented to the death of
[1:26:21] stephen and he watched steven die
[1:26:23] amen that death and he said it always
[1:26:25] kind of bothered paul
[1:26:29] but what does paul say let's just turn
[1:26:30] there i don't have any notes anyway so
[1:26:33] praise god
[1:26:37] let's go to first corinthians
[1:26:40] i wasn't planning on going here but god
[1:26:42] has different plans in mind
[1:26:49] first corinthians
[1:26:57] first corinthians 15.
[1:27:14] yeah verse nine for i am least of the
[1:27:18] apostles that i am not meat to be called
[1:27:19] an apostle because i persecuted the
[1:27:21] church of god
[1:27:22] but by the grace of god i am what i am
[1:27:26] and his grace which was bestowed upon me
[1:27:28] was not in vain
[1:27:29] but i labored more abundantly than they
[1:27:32] all yet not i
[1:27:33] by the grace of god which was with me
[1:27:35] therefore whether
[1:27:36] it was or i or they so we preach and so
[1:27:40] you believe
[1:27:41] the apostle paul is saying i'm not even
[1:27:43] worthy to be called an apostle
[1:27:46] because of my persecution of the church
[1:27:47] but it wasn't based on his worthiness
[1:27:50] they meant it was based on god's choice
[1:27:51] and he said but by the grace of god i am
[1:27:54] what i
[1:27:55] am but he says i bestowed abundantly
[1:27:58] more
[1:27:59] labor what was it there was something in
[1:28:02] the scar
[1:28:02] that kept driving him there was
[1:28:04] something in the failure that kept
[1:28:05] pushing him he kept going to the next
[1:28:07] village amen
[1:28:08] there is something about watching steven
[1:28:11] die
[1:28:13] there was something about the memory
[1:28:15] amen of crying moms and crying dads when
[1:28:18] he would haul a mother off to prison or
[1:28:19] hall
[1:28:20] father off to prison there was something
[1:28:22] about that
[1:28:23] scar that god was getting leveraged out
[1:28:26] of god
[1:28:26] was giving mileage out of because the
[1:28:28] apostle paul
[1:28:29] he wasn't saying well i'm no good i'm
[1:28:31] worthless i'll never do nothing for god
[1:28:33] look at what happened
[1:28:34] he recognized the call of god in his
[1:28:36] life and instead of sitting down on his
[1:28:37] heels and sitting on his hand
[1:28:39] and saying i'm such a bad person he said
[1:28:41] but it's the grace of god but it's
[1:28:43] moving me to greater action
[1:28:45] it's moving me to the opposite i
[1:28:48] hindered now i'll promote i stop now
[1:28:50] i'll move forward
[1:28:51] i stone now i'll be stoned i beat so now
[1:28:54] i'll be beaten
[1:28:58] amen you have sisters who have lost
[1:29:01] their virtue because of poor choices
[1:29:03] and they decide all is lost all is vain
[1:29:05] i'll never be no good
[1:29:06] i say let it motivate you into godly
[1:29:09] femininity and say
[1:29:10] what i was i'll be the opposite of them
[1:29:13] what i
[1:29:13] lost i could never get back i'll be
[1:29:15] scarred in some ways for life but by the
[1:29:17] grace of god i am what i am i'm a
[1:29:20] daughter of god and because of what i
[1:29:22] know
[1:29:22] that sin is life because i know where
[1:29:24] that takes you i'll never flirt with
[1:29:26] that line again but i'll be a
[1:29:28] model of what god wants a christian lady
[1:29:30] to be
[1:29:32] don't let it hinder you let it push you
[1:29:34] forward
[1:29:36] don't let it stop you
[1:29:39] amen some have been parts of failed
[1:29:42] churches
[1:29:45] failed ministries failed this fail that
[1:29:47] amen don't let it motivate you to pull
[1:29:49] away from mine because god still has to
[1:29:51] have a true church
[1:29:52] there has to be true ministry there has
[1:29:53] to be a true gathering of the same
[1:29:55] amen say hey i'll work just as
[1:29:57] diligently for the next one but you
[1:29:59] worked for the last one and it failed
[1:30:00] it doesn't matter there's a true one
[1:30:02] somewhere and i'll work till i find it
[1:30:07] it is not time to stop and say but i'm
[1:30:11] scarred
[1:30:15] i would but i have you know
[1:30:19] i have this issue i have this problem i
[1:30:21] have a difficulty my personality my
[1:30:26] you know what the brother bram said they
[1:30:28] said about dwight moody worst speaker he
[1:30:30] speaks
[1:30:31] nasally who can stand to listen to him
[1:30:34] and he won
[1:30:34] tens if not hundreds of thousands of
[1:30:36] souls to christ
[1:30:38] what did he do with a good speaking
[1:30:40] voice with a nasally high-bitch voice
[1:30:42] that nobody wanted to hear
[1:30:45] and the boot he said he was ugly
[1:30:51] i asked you which one of you knowing
[1:30:53] that you're ugly
[1:30:54] having them write about it in the
[1:30:56] newspaper
[1:30:58] describing your speech or the lack
[1:31:00] thereof your ability your name
[1:31:02] how many of you would get up the next
[1:31:03] sunday and preach to a few thousand
[1:31:05] people
[1:31:05] after you read that report
[1:31:08] [Music]
[1:31:11] but the apostle paul says i will now
[1:31:13] glory in my infirmities
[1:31:14] for when i am weak then am i strong
[1:31:21] see it's not time to make scars excuses
[1:31:25] the scar makes it the masterpiece
[1:31:28] because the masterpiece is redemption
[1:31:33] you know the scripture says we've been
[1:31:35] reading it
[1:31:36] out of corinthians he says you know look
[1:31:39] around
[1:31:40] not much mighty not very noble not rich
[1:31:43] have been called
[1:31:45] but god has chosen the weak things
[1:31:50] why did god choose the weak things he
[1:31:53] chose the things that are not to bring
[1:31:54] the not the things that are
[1:31:55] he chose the weak things to break the
[1:31:57] power and strength
[1:31:59] of the wicked why why is god
[1:32:02] why is god doing it this way because
[1:32:05] it's the scar
[1:32:06] that makes the masterpiece
[1:32:10] brother chad my home wasn't what it
[1:32:11] should be when i was growing up
[1:32:13] there was hypocrisy and this and that
[1:32:15] and so i don't want to go to church
[1:32:20] let it motivate you to not be a
[1:32:24] hypocrite
[1:32:27] it's not listen when we look at it we
[1:32:30] all have scars
[1:32:34] but is that outside god's plan is that
[1:32:37] error is that wrong
[1:32:41] remember god had a lamb slain from
[1:32:45] before the foundation of the world and
[1:32:46] he had your name on that book
[1:32:47] knowing that you would be redeemed and
[1:32:49] furthermore he knew what age and what
[1:32:51] time you would come
[1:32:55] and he already made redemption
[1:32:57] provisions for you
[1:32:59] because he knew you would need
[1:33:02] redemption
[1:33:06] you mean god already knew i'd have a
[1:33:08] scratch
[1:33:09] god probably knew you would have ten
[1:33:11] thousand scratches
[1:33:15] but the scratch makes you a trophy of
[1:33:17] his grace
[1:33:20] the corruption makes you a display of
[1:33:22] his power
[1:33:23] the failure makes him more powerful
[1:33:28] your perfection doesn't make god more
[1:33:30] perfect
[1:33:31] your failure makes god more perfect he's
[1:33:34] making you perfect by a perfect bleeding
[1:33:36] word that bled and died for you to wash
[1:33:38] you from everything else it's the word
[1:33:40] that's perfect and the word is what's
[1:33:42] making you perfect
[1:33:43] you're not being perfect so that you can
[1:33:45] display god amen
[1:33:46] you're failed so that god can wash you
[1:33:48] up and bring you into perfection by his
[1:33:50] word
[1:33:52] so then who becomes the mighty one god
[1:33:58] praise god franco got my notes up but i
[1:34:01] don't even feel like using them no more
[1:34:03] thank you brother franco you're a genius
[1:34:09] you know we all suffer from the same
[1:34:12] things
[1:34:13] and we watched brother branham suffer
[1:34:14] from it he talked about it openly
[1:34:17] he he he didn't like being poor
[1:34:24] when he went out on his first campaign
[1:34:26] and he had stitched back the pocket and
[1:34:27] sewed it himself and it was a poor job
[1:34:29] in a borrowed coat
[1:34:30] he held his hand over it and he offered
[1:34:32] people his left hand
[1:34:34] what was he doing he was suffering under
[1:34:37] the scar of poverty
[1:34:39] but here's a man without enough money to
[1:34:41] buy a coat or even enough money to have
[1:34:43] it tailored correctly the borrowed when
[1:34:44] he bond
[1:34:45] and here's a man who will preach all
[1:34:47] over the world seven times around the
[1:34:49] world
[1:34:49] and stand in king's palaces and pray for
[1:34:51] kings and why did he start without
[1:34:53] enough money amen what was it
[1:34:55] it was the it was the bad patch job on a
[1:34:57] coat
[1:34:58] that scar made it the masterpiece to me
[1:35:01] because that man had no ability to do
[1:35:03] what god would use him to do
[1:35:04] it shows how wonderful god is
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:08] he could use his lack of ability as an
[1:35:10] excuse this is what moses tried to do
[1:35:12] moses thought he was powerful he thought
[1:35:14] he was strong so god had to send him on
[1:35:16] a little journey amen and he knew he was
[1:35:18] the redeemer he's the right one he's the
[1:35:20] chosen vessel
[1:35:21] he's come to the right time 400 years
[1:35:25] but he's not yet in the right condition
[1:35:28] he's going to have to get a couple scars
[1:35:30] first
[1:35:32] he's going to have to try to bring
[1:35:33] deliverance he's going to have to fail
[1:35:35] amen he's going to kill an egyptian he's
[1:35:37] going to be
[1:35:37] rejected of his brother and cast out of
[1:35:39] the kingdom and he's going to have to
[1:35:40] run
[1:35:41] and god is going to have to give him a
[1:35:42] hot tempered wife
[1:35:45] do you think she didn't give him some
[1:35:46] scars
[1:35:47] [Laughter]
[1:35:50] you're kidding yourself
[1:35:55] until he's so scarred up and cut up and
[1:35:58] beat up
[1:35:59] when god comes to him in a burning bush
[1:36:00] said i can't do it go get somebody else
[1:36:04] i'm not able i can't even talk right
[1:36:08] they won't listen to me i mean
[1:36:11] can you imagine what he's thinking my
[1:36:13] wife won't listen to me you think
[1:36:14] they'll listen to me
[1:36:20] god knows what he's doing
[1:36:26] he got moses to the place where moses
[1:36:28] knew he couldn't do it anymore and moses
[1:36:30] was all scarred up
[1:36:32] but brother man said that's the
[1:36:33] condition he wants us to get into
[1:36:37] then he can use us to be trophies of his
[1:36:41] grace
[1:36:42] to display his power to show the power
[1:36:45] and redemption the power in the blood
[1:36:46] the power in the word
[1:36:50] it's not time for us to act like moses i
[1:36:53] can't speak and
[1:36:55] i can't preach like brother so and so
[1:36:56] god calls somebody to minister and
[1:36:58] because they can't preach like other
[1:36:59] sons so they won't minister
[1:37:02] my goodness friends preach whatever god
[1:37:05] laid on your heart if he called you to
[1:37:06] preach preach he called you to sing
[1:37:08] sing i can't sing like sister so i can't
[1:37:10] sing like brother son so
[1:37:11] god never told you to sing like them he
[1:37:12] just told you to sing
[1:37:19] we get scarred up by rejection and
[1:37:21] complexes and failures
[1:37:23] and we get to the point where we feel
[1:37:24] like we we can't do anything we can't do
[1:37:26] anything right
[1:37:27] if we try we're going to mess up that's
[1:37:29] absolutely the truth that's why you wait
[1:37:30] for god
[1:37:31] and when god calls you just move forward
[1:37:33] by faith and let god
[1:37:34] let your scar be the masterpiece
[1:37:40] god allowed heaven
[1:37:44] to get scarred
[1:37:47] i don't know how else to say it i i
[1:37:50] might you say but
[1:37:51] you're talking about heaven i don't
[1:37:52] understand how to say it
[1:37:54] the heavenly dimensions the heavenly
[1:37:56] realms there was a fall
[1:37:58] brother ben said sin started in heaven
[1:38:01] so there was a mar in heaven a flaw a
[1:38:05] a fall a scrat i don't know what you
[1:38:08] call it but something happened
[1:38:10] and god allowed it he come down the
[1:38:14] earth and he made a paradise and he made
[1:38:16] perfection
[1:38:17] so he's so satisfied with it he he went
[1:38:19] to a rest
[1:38:20] but it fell when it was marred
[1:38:24] and never was it wrong outside of god's
[1:38:27] plan
[1:38:28] not according to the pencil sketch
[1:38:32] never was it not what he was trying to
[1:38:35] achieve
[1:38:38] every time there was a failure of fall
[1:38:42] in the heavenly realm in the earthly
[1:38:44] realm
[1:38:45] falls all through humanity here's all
[1:38:48] there's a picture that he's painting
[1:38:49] there's a masterpiece that he's working
[1:38:51] on there's something he wants to display
[1:38:56] and now we've come to the end of time
[1:38:58] where brother baby says let's not be
[1:39:00] children but let's be men and women
[1:39:03] let's realize if god would allow
[1:39:06] his perfect heavenly realm to fall
[1:39:10] so that he could show redemption if he
[1:39:13] would allow
[1:39:14] his perfect paradise on earth to fall so
[1:39:17] he could show redemption
[1:39:19] then what about me could god use my
[1:39:22] failure
[1:39:24] to show his redemption could he show
[1:39:25] could he use my scars
[1:39:27] to show redemption and the answer is
[1:39:31] yes it's the scar that makes it the
[1:39:35] masterpiece
[1:39:37] well i've got this situation in my life
[1:39:39] i've got this
[1:39:40] in my past i have this marriage thing
[1:39:42] and this relationship thing and this
[1:39:44] criminal record thing and i've got this
[1:39:45] and this and this
[1:39:49] read the bible there's a lot of those
[1:39:52] things there
[1:39:55] but each one of them was another image
[1:39:57] making the great image each one of them
[1:39:59] was another brush stroke another part
[1:40:01] another little a sculpted piece in the
[1:40:04] great wall
[1:40:05] of the tapestry of god and this whole
[1:40:08] wall is painting one story
[1:40:11] and it's the very mind of god the very
[1:40:13] heart of god the very thought of god
[1:40:16] amen to show himself to have a bride of
[1:40:18] his own choosing and show himself to
[1:40:20] that bride so that she will know him
[1:40:23] and it's all been redemption there's a
[1:40:25] redemption there's a masterpiece
[1:40:27] redemption
[1:40:29] and you guys are part of the masterpiece
[1:40:32] redemption
[1:40:35] do you have scars yeah
[1:40:40] maybe there's still areas in your heart
[1:40:42] that are broken
[1:40:44] and it just won't hold the oil but i
[1:40:47] want to tell you there's a power here
[1:40:48] today
[1:40:50] that'll mend that broken heart if you're
[1:40:53] something you just haven't been able to
[1:40:54] get over in your past if there's
[1:40:56] an abusive situation your own failure or
[1:41:00] somebody else's failure a church failure
[1:41:02] or whatever
[1:41:03] if there's something that's left in your
[1:41:05] life and there's a crack where all the
[1:41:07] golden oil of love keeps seeping out
[1:41:09] i want to tell you there's a god here
[1:41:11] today right now
[1:41:13] that can mend that place in your heart
[1:41:15] so that you can hold the golden oil of
[1:41:17] love
[1:41:19] god allowed the crack to come but he
[1:41:22] allowed the crack to come so that he can
[1:41:24] be the hand that mends the crack
[1:41:28] so that your scar will then display his
[1:41:31] love
[1:41:31] your scar will then show his
[1:41:33] faithfulness your scar will show his
[1:41:35] power
[1:41:39] i invite you this morning let the great
[1:41:42] healer
[1:41:43] heal your hearts
[1:41:47] don't hate all those cracks stop hating
[1:41:50] them
[1:41:52] stop hating your past stop hating
[1:41:56] you know i don't think paul was ever
[1:41:57] proud of what he did
[1:42:00] i don't think paul was ever i think he
[1:42:02] was always disappointed
[1:42:05] but he didn't allow it to stop him from
[1:42:08] moving on
[1:42:09] with the plan of god there's all kinds
[1:42:13] of things that have happened to us
[1:42:15] we could probably stand here for another
[1:42:17] two hours just mentioning all ways that
[1:42:19] people get damaged and scars come
[1:42:22] afflicted by others and inflicted by
[1:42:23] ourselves
[1:42:26] but i'm telling you there's a power here
[1:42:28] to heal
[1:42:30] because that's the image he's trying to
[1:42:32] paint
[1:42:34] he's trying to take you that have been
[1:42:37] cracked and he's trying to seal up that
[1:42:39] crack
[1:42:41] will i have a scar yeah that's the point
[1:42:45] the point of the scar is to make it the
[1:42:48] redemption masterpiece
[1:42:50] so that everybody can see redemption
[1:42:54] if there's no scar there's no evidence
[1:42:57] of the handiwork of god
[1:42:59] we've been all scarred up but there's a
[1:43:02] great power that's here to heal
[1:43:06] the one that healed paul can heal you
[1:43:10] the one that would get moses back into
[1:43:12] action is here to get you back in action
[1:43:16] the one amen that would that would
[1:43:18] restore david after he was fallen is
[1:43:20] here to restore you
[1:43:24] remember the greatest kingdom that that
[1:43:26] israel ever had
[1:43:28] there was a type of the golden age the
[1:43:30] type of their millennium was solomon's
[1:43:31] kingdom
[1:43:32] is that right but look how solomon
[1:43:35] arrived on this earth look at what
[1:43:38] happened with his mother and father and
[1:43:40] and the the the degrading event that
[1:43:43] took place the shame that was on the
[1:43:45] family
[1:43:46] his mother bathsheba was married to
[1:43:48] uriah the hittite amen
[1:43:50] and david took her for his own while he
[1:43:52] was out fighting a battle
[1:43:53] and then conceived an idea to have him
[1:43:55] murdered so that so that he could cover
[1:43:57] up his sin
[1:43:59] but god exposed it all and the first
[1:44:01] baby died and the very next baby to be
[1:44:03] born amen
[1:44:04] after uriah has died after the after uh
[1:44:07] the baby died amen david and bathsheba
[1:44:10] are now husband and wife
[1:44:11] and david goes to comfort her and she
[1:44:14] conceives and brings forth solomon
[1:44:16] solomon has a mark on his life from his
[1:44:19] very birth
[1:44:21] but nathanael the prophet shows up that
[1:44:23] day like he doesn't for any other of the
[1:44:25] births
[1:44:26] that's recorded in the bible we have no
[1:44:28] other recording of nathanael the prophet
[1:44:31] showing up at the birth of one of
[1:44:32] david's children like he did for solomon
[1:44:34] because solomon's coming out of a
[1:44:36] horrible situation
[1:44:39] it's ugly and can you imagine what
[1:44:40] everybody else in the kingdom thinks
[1:44:44] this child will never amount to anything
[1:44:47] look at how he's come look at what's
[1:44:48] happened look at his mom look at his dad
[1:44:50] look at the sin
[1:44:51] look at the murder
[1:44:55] here comes this little baby out of a
[1:44:58] mess
[1:45:00] and the prophet shows up it says god has
[1:45:04] called him jedediah
[1:45:06] whom the lord loves
[1:45:09] call him jedediah why because
[1:45:12] he was the chosen one the one god
[1:45:16] had chose to be the successor the one
[1:45:18] that god had chose
[1:45:19] to be the great king that was going to
[1:45:21] type the millennial reign of jesus
[1:45:22] christ
[1:45:23] and you would think god how could you
[1:45:26] you knew it was going to happen you knew
[1:45:28] he was going to come why didn't you
[1:45:29] protect bathsheba
[1:45:30] why didn't you let why did you let uriah
[1:45:32] ever be born why was she married to
[1:45:33] begin with
[1:45:36] because the story shows god's grace
[1:45:40] in god's election and god's choosing
[1:45:44] amen you may have a story that's that
[1:45:47] bad or worse
[1:45:49] but if god chose you he loves you
[1:45:54] you chose for a purpose and nothing that
[1:45:58] not none of the scars or failures or
[1:46:00] mistakes
[1:46:01] none of it will stop god's purpose
[1:46:04] from taking place in your life nothing
[1:46:06] will stop
[1:46:08] god from using you to display the
[1:46:11] masterpiece of his redemption
[1:46:14] i say god you can have me broken
[1:46:18] tattered scratched bruised torn
[1:46:21] some people did it to me and i've done
[1:46:23] it to myself
[1:46:25] but lord may every scratch testify of
[1:46:27] your goodness
[1:46:28] may every scar testify of your mercy may
[1:46:31] everyone
[1:46:31] show how beautiful your grace is in your
[1:46:34] plan of redemption in this day
[1:46:36] may everything display your masterpiece
[1:46:42] can my scars here's the question can my
[1:46:44] scars
[1:46:46] in my life make me god's masterpiece
[1:46:52] ask yourself the question can my scars
[1:46:56] that are in my life can that
[1:46:59] make me god's masterpiece
[1:47:03] and the answer is yes
[1:47:06] but you need to let him you need to just
[1:47:11] trust him not sitting back and making
[1:47:14] excuses or allowing the devil to bring
[1:47:17] torment but allow the grace of god to
[1:47:20] take its effect
[1:47:22] allow the plan of redemption to bring us
[1:47:24] up
[1:47:26] and make us the masterpiece that he
[1:47:27] wants to display to the world
[1:47:30] and he's got a bride that's been washed
[1:47:32] by the water of the word
[1:47:33] she's not been prairie but she's been
[1:47:35] made perfect by the word
[1:47:37] and now she comes into subjection to the
[1:47:39] word so that that word can manifest
[1:47:40] through her life
[1:47:43] and you can say it's coming through a
[1:47:46] life that had been marred as a child
[1:47:48] but it's still coming through it's
[1:47:51] coming through a life who had a dad he
[1:47:52] was an alcoholic they're coming through
[1:47:54] a life
[1:47:55] of a former alcoholic a drug addict a
[1:47:57] prostitute
[1:47:59] mary magdalene was called having seven
[1:48:01] devils and brother bam said she was a
[1:48:02] street prostitute
[1:48:04] but yes she was the first one to see
[1:48:05] jesus in the resurrection
[1:48:08] she became a trophy of his grace and she
[1:48:11] began to display to us the church has
[1:48:13] been
[1:48:13] released from the seven devils of the
[1:48:15] denominations in the church ages
[1:48:18] it all has a purpose it's all for god's
[1:48:21] great image
[1:48:22] it's all for god's great picture that
[1:48:24] he's painting
[1:48:26] just let him take you and heal the
[1:48:29] wounded places and pour the oil of love
[1:48:32] back in your heart
[1:48:32] and let him put you back on his mantle
[1:48:36] don't take yourself off of there it's
[1:48:38] his grace that puts you there
[1:48:40] it's his love the scar
[1:48:44] is what makes it the masterpiece
[1:48:48] paul
[1:48:51] he was moved into action by his failure
[1:48:56] i say god move me into action by my
[1:48:58] failure
[1:48:59] don't let my failure keep me out let my
[1:49:01] failure push me in
[1:49:05] my need for you my need for deliverance
[1:49:07] my yes we have needs for deliverance we
[1:49:09] need god delivers we need god to free us
[1:49:11] we need god to give us strength
[1:49:13] we need god to help us overcome we need
[1:49:15] it
[1:49:16] but don't let our need keep us from god
[1:49:18] let our need push us to god
[1:49:21] so that he can lift us up and make us a
[1:49:23] trophy of his grace
[1:49:26] god bless you all let's stand let's
[1:49:29] stand
[1:49:30] when we stand as the musicians come i
[1:49:32] want to read one more scripture out of
[1:49:33] revelation
[1:49:36] revelation chapter 5.
[1:49:48] revelation chapter 5 verse 9
[1:49:52] and they sung a new song saying thou art
[1:49:54] worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:49:57] seals thereof
[1:49:58] to for thou was slain it has redeemed us
[1:50:01] to god by thy blood out of every kindred
[1:50:04] and tongue and people and nation
[1:50:07] and hast made us unto our god
[1:50:10] kings and priests and we shall reign
[1:50:15] on the earth this is the song of the
[1:50:18] redeemed
[1:50:20] do you know why they can sing this song
[1:50:22] because they needed to be redeemed
[1:50:25] they they needed to be redeemed they
[1:50:28] needed to be saved they need to be
[1:50:30] lifted out of corruption they needed to
[1:50:32] be washed they needed to be sanctified
[1:50:34] they needed
[1:50:35] to be filled with the holy ghost they
[1:50:37] needed redemption
[1:50:39] and god was going to create a need
[1:50:42] so that he could meet the need so that
[1:50:44] what was inside of him could be on
[1:50:46] display
[1:50:48] and inside of you and me god allowed
[1:50:50] circumcised could god
[1:50:52] create corruption no did god create evil
[1:50:54] no but he said it in a way that it could
[1:50:55] corrupt itself
[1:50:56] and it could be corrupted by choices
[1:50:58] choices others make choices you made
[1:51:02] and god allowed it to come into
[1:51:04] corruption and brokenness
[1:51:06] to create in us a need
[1:51:09] and when we have a need then god shows
[1:51:12] up with the one that can meet
[1:51:14] every need and when he meets the need
[1:51:17] now whose handiwork is on display the
[1:51:19] devils are gods
[1:51:20] now who was showed off who's
[1:51:22] demonstrated their power
[1:51:23] and their glory is it the devil is it
[1:51:26] you you couldn't do it
[1:51:27] the devil all he could do was push you
[1:51:29] into the hand of god and then god would
[1:51:31] pick you up by his redemption and
[1:51:32] healing
[1:51:33] and say this is what i always wanted to
[1:51:35] show myself mighty on your behalf
[1:51:38] to show my power to show my might to
[1:51:41] show my love to show my grace
[1:51:45] praise be the god i will now therefore
[1:51:48] glory in my infirmities
[1:51:50] for when i am weak then am i strong
[1:51:54] those things that i think about when i
[1:51:56] was a child and things i've done through
[1:51:58] my young
[1:51:58] young life i just shudder sometimes at
[1:52:01] the foolishness that the pride
[1:52:03] at the horrible choices that i made and
[1:52:06] the damage that i've done to myself and
[1:52:07] others
[1:52:08] you look back and you just shudder
[1:52:12] but if it wasn't for that i wouldn't
[1:52:13] know what great need i had
[1:52:15] and i wouldn't know what great powerful
[1:52:17] savior that i have and i wouldn't
[1:52:18] understand the power of the word that's
[1:52:20] been released in this day because the
[1:52:22] power of that word has re-freed me from
[1:52:24] every one of those things that were
[1:52:27] trying to hold me back
[1:52:30] it's the thing that pushes me to god
[1:52:31] it's the thing that keeps me close to
[1:52:33] god and is the thing that causes me to
[1:52:35] sing his praises day by day
[1:52:37] because i couldn't do it but he did it
[1:52:41] so he took my picture of a beat up
[1:52:43] tossed around
[1:52:44] boy that was drunk from pillar to post
[1:52:46] and all these
[1:52:47] terrible things that you would look at
[1:52:49] and say they were terrible i'm saying
[1:52:50] they were wonderful because where i'm at
[1:52:52] now
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:55] now i know my god and i know his power
[1:52:58] and i know he can deliver and i know he
[1:52:59] can save and i know he can heal
[1:53:01] and i know not because brother branham
[1:53:03] said it i
[1:53:04] know that he can heal a broken heart and
[1:53:06] pour the oil of love back in
[1:53:09] and i know by experience that there's
[1:53:11] still a scar but i know that behind that
[1:53:13] scar
[1:53:14] is the golden oil of love that god
[1:53:16] poured in because he healed
[1:53:20] now i don't look at the scar with
[1:53:21] disdain i look at it with love for my
[1:53:24] maker
[1:53:26] i don't look at my past with hatred and
[1:53:28] contempt and spite
[1:53:30] if you look backwards like that you're
[1:53:31] always going to be walking forward that
[1:53:33] way too
[1:53:36] but i look at my life as the tender hand
[1:53:38] of jehovah
[1:53:40] driving me to the promised land
[1:53:44] and i look at it as a power that only
[1:53:48] god had
[1:53:49] to lift me out of such
[1:53:52] in may all my failures display his glory
[1:53:56] may all my scars look at my scars
[1:54:00] you want to see a scar let's look at
[1:54:03] scars
[1:54:04] why do you want to look at your scars
[1:54:06] because i've been healed
[1:54:08] that's a sign of healing i was wounded i
[1:54:11] was
[1:54:11] bitten by the lion amen i would i was
[1:54:14] trying to be taken by
[1:54:15] by the violence of the demons amen i
[1:54:17] i'll show you my scars you want to
[1:54:19] compare scars i'll compare scars because
[1:54:20] my scars show the goodness of god
[1:54:23] and the glory of god i don't hate them
[1:54:25] they're what make it the masterpiece
[1:54:29] be the masterpiece that god wants you to
[1:54:32] be
[1:54:34] if the devil is still trying to use the
[1:54:36] past to hold you down
[1:54:37] amen let god cut those strings today
[1:54:40] there is no reason god didn't allow it
[1:54:42] to happen
[1:54:43] amen for your destruction he allowed it
[1:54:45] to happen for his
[1:54:48] glory
[1:54:50] let him be glorified come to him
[1:54:54] say lord i need that power that can heal
[1:54:57] a broken heart
[1:55:00] and i need that golden oil of love that
[1:55:02] can be poured back in and held
[1:55:04] and a heart that's been mended i need
[1:55:07] you to free me from the consequences of
[1:55:10] my own actions
[1:55:11] i need you to free me from what others

[1:55:15] i need your glory to be made manifest
[1:55:19] in this vessel let's just bow our heads
[1:55:24] let's just reverently just meditate
[1:55:29] there's none of us have gotten through
[1:55:30] life without scars
[1:55:33] there's not a one of us who have
[1:55:35] traveled for some distance in this life
[1:55:39] that doesn't have a mark indicating a
[1:55:42] flaw
[1:55:43] a failure an injury
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:55:48] but all the power of god is here
[1:55:52] the presence of god is here to set free
[1:55:56] the power of god is here to heal
[1:56:00] the love of god is here to restore
[1:56:04] oh if we could just turn from all of
[1:56:07] those negative things
[1:56:09] and begin to see it in the positive
[1:56:11] light god had intended before the
[1:56:13] foundation
[1:56:14] of the world when he wrote our names in
[1:56:16] the lamb's book of life
[1:56:17] he knew we'd read we would need
[1:56:19] redemption
[1:56:20] so he wrote our name in a book of
[1:56:22] redemption from before the foundation of
[1:56:24] the world
[1:56:26] we've already looked to the end of the
[1:56:27] book and we see
[1:56:29] that the saints are crying and praying
[1:56:32] of god who's redeemed us of every tongue
[1:56:34] and nation
[1:56:36] and hast made us kings and priests
[1:56:40] we shall reign upon the earth
[1:56:43] god you have made us kings and priests
[1:56:47] you have redeemed us you have made us
[1:56:50] trophies of your grace
[1:56:52] god forgive us for holding on to things
[1:56:54] we should have let go of years ago
[1:56:56] forgive us for allowing the devil to
[1:56:58] yank us around by failures and mistakes
[1:57:02] wounds god we're coming to you now
[1:57:05] to trust you to know that this is part
[1:57:08] of your
[1:57:08] beautiful story of redemption
[1:57:12] this is part of the reason there was a
[1:57:14] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:57:16] world
[1:57:17] because we would need it now we come to
[1:57:20] you oh god
