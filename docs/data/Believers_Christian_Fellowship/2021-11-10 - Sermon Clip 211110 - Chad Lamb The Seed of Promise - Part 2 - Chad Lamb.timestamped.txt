[0:00] and god said unto him in a dream yea i
[0:03] know that thou didst this in the
[0:05] integrity of thy heart for i also
[0:07] withheld thee from sinning against
[0:10] me
[0:14] he did not stop abimelech from sinning
[0:17] against sarah
[0:20] that's not why he came down to him in a
[0:22] dream
[0:24] that's not why he smote them with curses
[0:26] and closed their wounds because that had
[0:27] already taken place at this time he had
[0:30] he had come down to speak to him in a
[0:32] dream abimelech was not what abraham was
[0:35] abraham was the seed line abimelech was
[0:39] not but abimelech was righteous because
[0:40] he wasn't doing this intentionally
[0:45] and because abimelech was righteous
[0:48] god came to him
[0:50] and said you're but a dead man
[0:53] you're under a curse
[0:55] the wounds are already shut up in your
[0:57] nation and you're going to die because
[1:00] you've taken a man's wife and he says
[1:02] you know the integrity of my heart he
[1:04] told me he lied to me
[1:06] and god says i know the integrity of
[1:07] your heart that's why i kept you from
[1:09] sinning against me what was he doing he
[1:12] was protecting his word because isaac
[1:15] had to come from sarah and abraham
[1:18] amen and so abhimalek didn't know it but
[1:22] bhimalek was standing in opposition to
[1:24] the word of god he was going to hinder
[1:26] the word he was going to stop the word
[1:29] he was going to derail the word so god
[1:31] comes down supernaturally injects
[1:33] himself into the situation because he
[1:36] has to manifest what's in his mind he
[1:38] has to manifest what's written in the
[1:39] last book of life he has to manifest
[1:41] what's written in the stars do you get
[1:43] what i'm saying
[1:45] so now god has to come down he has to
[1:47] play he has to warn he has to speak
[1:50] because he's got to preserve this womb
[1:52] because it's this is his plan and from
[1:54] there the word is coming forth
[1:58] to stop that word from coming forth
[2:01] brings a curse and brings death
[2:04] even though abimelech wasn't aware of it
[2:08] even though pharaoh wasn't aware of it
[2:11] they weren't doing it intentionally but
[2:13] to come against the word even
[2:15] unintentionally will bring death because
[2:18] the word is life and to come against
[2:20] life is death
[2:23] so the movement of life in that day was
[2:26] coming from abraham through sarah unto
[2:29] isaac and that was the movement of life
[2:31] and to stop that would bring death and
[2:34] curses upon you
