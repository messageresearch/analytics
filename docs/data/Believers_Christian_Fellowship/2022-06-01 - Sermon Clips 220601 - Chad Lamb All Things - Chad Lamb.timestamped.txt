[0:00] now there is an angel but this angel to
[0:02] the lord that are encamped about those
[0:04] that fear them that fears him now it
[0:06] isn't promised that sinners has angels
[0:10] so we're talking about a different kind
[0:11] of angel amen they're not that sinners
[0:14] doesn't have angels it's only the
[0:16] redeemed has angels
[0:18] did you know that the angels of the lord
[0:20] and camp about those that fear him now
[0:22] angels are messengers i want you to
[0:25] notice it's so perfect and it'll prove
[0:28] predestination to you
[0:30] the fact that only the redeemed have
[0:32] angels proves predestination to you and
[0:34] these little ones of the kingdom are
[0:36] their angel always beholds the father's
[0:38] face so there's a receiver inside of the
[0:41] believer a sea gene of god amen in the
[0:44] soul to receive revelation amen and when
[0:47] you received the revelation that this
[0:48] was eagle's food and left the others you
[0:50] heard from your theophany so there's a
[0:52] representation of you somewhere that can
[0:55] see the father's face
[0:58] which means with that representation
[1:01] there is nothing hidden amen there's
[1:03] nothing obscure there's nothing hidden
[1:05] that representation can see the father's
[1:08] face
[1:08] and if the father's faith is unveiled to
[1:11] that angel amen praise be to god brother
[1:14] branham said now he says and angels are
[1:16] messengers
[1:19] what message are they carrying and to
[1:21] who amen
[1:22] because the angels are messengers amen
[1:25] are you receiving any messages amen is
[1:27] there any revelation coming on this
[1:29] revealed word in the end time praise be
[1:31] to god amen we have representation in
[1:34] heaven
[1:35] [Music]
[1:36] and i'm so glad there's a mystical
[1:38] channel somewhere
[1:40] that something could come rolling down
[1:41] from the unseen world and landing here
[1:44] just like the woman at the well amen she
[1:47] didn't
[1:47] she didn't have to go to school she
[1:49] didn't have to do any experimentation
[1:51] amen she's standing there talking to the
[1:54] man began to receive something was
[1:56] moving inside of her at this visitation
[1:58] and she began to receive the word and
[2:01] brother branham said because she had
[2:02] representation in heaven
[2:04] [Music]
[2:05] and i just say
[2:06] thanks be to god that there's ears
[2:08] somewhere that can hear amen
[2:10] there's eyes somewhere that can see amen
[2:13] i need more than these ears and i need
[2:15] more than these eyes i need something a
[2:16] little deeper because many people have
[2:18] heard many people have seen and still
[2:21] not believed but oh god thank god for
[2:24] eyes and ears that can hear and see
