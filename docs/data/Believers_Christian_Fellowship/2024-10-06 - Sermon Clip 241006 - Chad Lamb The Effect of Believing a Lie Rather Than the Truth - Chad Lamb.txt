TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there may be tough circumstances we may have to work through a few things we we may have to make apologies and make things right but it doesn't change the truth the truth is you're loved you're highly favored amen the angel came to Mary and Mary was there amen she was just a young girl in a no-name place from a no-name uh situation and she was going to get married and who knows what she's been told all her life she might have been told you know you're kind of an odd person you're a little different her mom might have said you know if you would change this and this you know some boys might marry you I don't know but that's happened to people you know what that starts to do in people makes a lie I'm not nobody wants me my mom thinks that I'm not attractive and if I did this different that starts a lie and a girl starts to believe that lie she has to change something about her appearance herself Amen to attract that's a lie who knows what Mary had heard who knows what she went through who knows if she was rejected not rejected rejected but something happened when she went to the well that day when the angel Gabriel came to her he gave her a true identification he said behold thou highly favored of the Lord it didn't matter at that moment it didn't matter what anybody else had ever said about her if it was her mom if it was her dad if it was an old boyfriend if it was her siblings it did not matter anymore because God had called her highly favored and in the eyes of God she was highly favored chosen The Chosen vessel of God to bring forth Jesus Christ and I'm telling you today there's been an angel that has come to you that said behold highly favored of the Lord you say how do I know it's me because I believe it I heard the eagle scream something in me said that's nothing but the truth it wasn't my emotions it wasn't an education amen something in me responded to the word and what is that it's the Lord saying behold thou highly favored of the Lord You're The Chosen vessel to bring forth Christ in this generation it's you what you need to do is let it come out of your mouth don't be afraid because of the past because rejection because of feelings but take the word and say I've been chosen before the foundation of the world I am part of Christ and he's chosen me to manifest himself in this same time how do you know it I only have one indication and that's because I believe him that's it I don't have any other proof I don't have any other evidence I don't have birth records I don't have but I have faith and if Faith saved zakus and if Faith saved the woman at the well and if Faith saved the woman who washes feet then it's faith that has saved me and redeemed me because I've come to the same place they came to I came to the anointed word made manifest for the day and when I came to the living Jesus Christ Christ the word for this day and I anointed and I washed it I respected and I believed it and I confessed my sins salvation has come this day the truth has set us free
