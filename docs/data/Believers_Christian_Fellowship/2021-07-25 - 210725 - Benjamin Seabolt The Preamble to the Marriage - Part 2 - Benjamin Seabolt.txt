time [Music] trying [Music] me [Music] precious lord jesus we just want to pause here a moment lord to once again thank you for this opportunity together lord to come and to fulfill your scripture that we would not forsake our assembling ourselves together lord and even the more so as we see the end drawing now lord and we're so thankful once again that we can gather here knowing that we're not just socializing knowing that we're not just here because we think alike or maybe we would see some things in the scripture the same but lord that we've been able to come and together around a person the person of the word the lord jesus christ lord to come and together around truth as billions or at least millions would gather on what we would know as sunday or representing the sabbath day and they would gather and go to lodge's lord and they would have certain portions of the scripture that they would agree upon but yet they would deny other ones lord we're so grateful that you have come and that you have revealed all of yourself to us and that we've been able to receive all of you lord and that's who we gather around this morning we don't ever want to take that for granted lord we don't ever want to let it be common to us that we have truth to walk in lord we would just ask now that as we would come to this part of the service lord father we stand here and you know the hearts of each and every one lord there is no mortal man that can stand here and meet the needs of every person that's in this building lord even if there would just be one or two here lord it would be impossible for a man to meet the needs of another man lord you've got to come on the scene father you have got to come and break your word lord for we need you lord we just commit all things into your hands lord we love you we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you if you'll turn in your bibles to revelation chapter 19. we'll uh have every intention of continuing on where we left off a couple sundays ago with the preamble to the marriage and i'll have to apologize for how long i kept you last time i certainly did not intend to keep you two hours so i apologize for that i really intended three or four so i'll try to do better but the lord knows it's you would just have to i guess be in this position to understand but every time i walk out here you know i look at my notes and i think about the thought that they've given me and you're like okay well yeah 30 45 minutes and we'll be done here and i'm not sure what happens but then i look over at my timer and it's two hours and i haven't got anywhere so i'm not sure how that works i'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing but it is a thing and it's true and it's it is what it is so we just want to commit ourselves to him and we want to go as slow as he wants us to go and we want to go as fast as he wants us to go and you all control a lot of that so really the blame is on you so you can't blame me but god bless you this morning it's sure good to be with you we'll look here at revelation chapter 19 and verse 7 and then i'll let you have your seats says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready god bless you as you would be seated i'm just going to read this uh excerpt of this story out of the choosing of the bride that we're really basing this inspirational and this this topic one obviously it's a very familiar story very familiar uh parable that brother branham lays down here but just for the sake of maybe somebody that would be here that's not familiar will just review this very quickly in 1965 choosing of the bride and we want to remember the context that's because it's crucial to remember the context that brother branham is preaching this under he's standing on the west coast he's standing in the los angeles at the at the tail end of his ministry and he's standing there and he's pulling out the scripture of elegies are going to call out a bride he's pulling out the scripture of the seventh vile angel uh pouring out the seventh vial and he's literally as he's preaching this sermon he's literally fleshing these scriptures out because he's literally the instrument that god used as eleazar to go into call out abroad and he's literally the seventh vile angel standing there and he's getting ready at the end of this service to spiritually through his vocal cords pour out the seventh vial on the west coast so as i said before it's you know it's not that all the messages aren't important but there's just some of them that are at a crossroads there's some of them that are a juncture in time and a dispensational change and a literal literal fulfillment of the scripture so we want to we want to understand the context that this is under when brother branham just tells this story it's ex he's he's not just telling the story there's something crucial and critical that he's trying to lay out in simplicity but he says starting in paragraph 85 and i'm going to paraphrase some of this he says i've married many couples but it always reminds me of christ and his bride one of the weddings that i performed here some time ago was quite an outstanding thing in my life it's been several years ago when i was just a young minister my brother was what was working on the pwa and there was a boy that worked up there with him from indianapolis he said to my brother one day i want to get married if i just had enough money to pay the preacher doc said well my brother is a preacher and he may marry you he said he never charges people for things like that well that night my brother asked me and i said if he's never been married before either one of them and everything is all right so when saturday came along and the boy came down it's been a great thing for me to always look back upon this a rainy afternoon an old chevrolet car with the headlights wired on with belling wire that drove up and out got a boy he certainly did not look like a groom to me or would do anybody he had on a pair of shoes looked like they was run over his trousers was real baggy he had on one of these old moleskin jackets looked like he had been run through a washing machine without being rinsed and a little lady got out with a little checkered dress and she didn't have hardly any shoes on she had hitchhiked from indianapolis had a little hair and long kind of plaits down her back looked very young and i said to you said to her are you old enough to get married she said yes sir said i have my written permission from my father and mother i had to show it to the court here to get my license i said i'd like to talk to you for a little bit before we perform this wedding and they sat down the boy kept looking around the room he needed a haircut real bad he wasn't listening to me i said son i want you to listen to what i'm saying he said yes sir and i said do you love this girl he said yes sir i do and i said to her do you love him yes sir i do i said to the boy now have you got a place to take her after you marry said yes sir i do said all right said now i want to ask you something i understand you're working up here on the pwa and he said yes that's about 12 a week i said you think you can make a living for her he said i'll do all that i can do and i said well that's all right and i said now what if he gets out of work what if he loses his job sister what are you going to do you going to run back home to mama and papa she said no sir i'm going to stay right with him and i said what sir if you have three or four children nothing to feed them and you haven't got any work what are you going to do are you going to send her away said no sir i'll struggle right on we'll make it somehow brother brandon says i felt real little and i seen that he really loved her and that they loved one another and i married them so obviously we're most of us are very familiar with that story but again remember the context that he's dropping this under this is the this is the same context and the same way he'll come to the first seal and he's you know everybody's setting an anticipation waiting for him to break the seal break the seal read the scripture break the seal and he says me and brother vale was talking the other day about these guns you know if it gets off a little back here when it gets all the way out here at a thousand yards it's clear off the target he just broke the seal and everybody's wanting him to break the seal he's here preaching choosing of a bride they're wanting him to preach choosing a bride he's already preached choosing another bride and that's how simple that we can miss it that's how simple it is that a fool would not err therein if we will just understand the context that he's delivering this in and the simplicity that he brings this in will catch you so obviously we picked up these questions that brother branham was asking this couple and that's what drew my attention to the situation because every time that brother branham tells this story he's got the same questions in here that never deviates and there's a significance to that because we know what he's doing is this is the pattern and these are the principles for a true and proper marriage for a true and proper engagement that leads into a marriage and that that marriage would stand and that there would not be anything that would undermine that so this is the pattern that will work both naturally and spiritually so we want to understand that that way we don't come to the end of our road here thinking we're married but yet we deviated away from the pattern and maybe we were in a relationship maybe we were even engaged maybe we were even a spouse but we weren't actually in a marriage and remember the point of the marriage is to reproduce the son of man again and if you're unfamiliar with that terminology don't get nervous about that to reproduce the son of man again is to simply reproduce all of the word in flesh that's that's the definition of the fullness of the son of man all of the word in flesh and we know collectively as a bride that we have to be able to do that so just a very quick review he spoke to this lady and asked her are you old enough to get married she said she was produced her written permission said that you know i had to show that to the court in order to be married and we typed that to our written permission in the word we don't want to go off of feelings and we don't want to go off of think so's but we understand that acts 2 38 gives the prerequisites to the marriage and acts 2 38 says you have to repent and you have to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ in order to move into a marriage with him in order for him to give you his spirit to give you his name you have to take those first two steps it's not optional it has to be there so that's obviously just a very simple thing but you know it's it's true and there's a lot of people that would that will overlook that and say well god knows what's in my heart you're right he does and if he lays in his scripture that you have to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you don't then he knows what's in your heart that's a problem so i won't dispute that he looks upon your heart and the water is not going to save you but it's an outward expression of an inward work and it's a confession before the people that you have taken his name therefore when you go out and you act like the world after you said that you've taken his name there's church discipline for that so there's a purpose and a reason behind that and he says if you love me you'll keep my commandments so even if you even if you disagree with it if you can see in the word that it is one of his commandments you still have to line up to it so there's no wiggle room around that there's no way to move forward with god without obeying what his word says to do and that is your written permission because if you have truly repented and you have truly been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ god is obligated brother branham said he is obligated to give you the gift of the holy spirit it's not optional because if he didn't he would be a liar and we all know that god is not a liar so that is your written permission that you can give to the minister when he asks you are you old enough to be married are you spiritually mature enough to be married yes i have my written permission i have repented and i've been baptized in his name we can move forward with this he asked the man he says do you love this girl obviously that's a huge huge issue because if he doesn't love this girl obviously we're not moving forward but we took that into the spiritual realm and we we realized that brother branham told us about god's love and he says it's not as a parent who would just protect their child and hover over their child and not let anything bad happen to them while that's good he says that's not god's love he says god's love is much deeper than that god's love is elective love his love is expressed through election and predestination so we want to drive that stake down first and have a proper understanding of god's love because if not we're just going to be second guessing our entire walk you have to settle that first peter says you have to make your calling and your election sure so if you don't settle the fact that god loves me simply because he chose me then the rest of the marriage is just going to be in shambles just the same as in natural if that lady doesn't understand that this man loves me if nothing else if he messes up every day and does everything else wrong if every external indicator tells me he doesn't love me he still loves me because he's told me he loves me and it's that simple we have to understand that god does love us god has chosen us because he's told us that and he's told us that how did brother reno say because he brought his word our way it's really that simple saints it really really is of all the billions of people on the earth think of the small minority that's even had a chance to hear what you've heard let alone have the capacity to truly receive it that is not a coincidence don't make it more complicated than what it has to be remember he's choosing a bride he's choosing the bride so if he's chose you allow it to be so allowed the indications to be so if he's chose you he's got to come and tell you he's chose you that's why you have the capacity to receive it so we want to drive that nail down and have a good clear proper understanding of that and then we moved to the lady brother branham obviously asked her do you love him and we obviously brought this out in the church age book in the same the same portion brother branham says we prove our love to him by simply believing what he said and conducting ourself with joy amongst the trials that he sees fit to bring our way so we understand that he loves us but then there's the reciprocating outward expression for us that we can prove our love back to him if there was anything else that we could do to prove our love to him do you not think eliezer would have told us because remember that's his job eliezer's job is to go get rebecca make sure she loves isaac and then bring her bring her to isaac if ellie easier thought that rebecca could have done anything else to prove her love to isaac remember isaac's daddy is the one that hired him so if he brings this girl back and isaac is not happy daddy's not going to be happy he's out of a job so if there's anything else that he can do or instruct rebecca to do to prove her love to isaac would he be most foolish not to tell her so when he comes and the only thing that he tells us is to prove your love to him is believe what he said and conduct yourself with joy amongst the trials that he sees fit to bring your way and he doesn't say anything else to prove your love to him that's how simple it is he would be most foolish if there was a works program you could get into to prove your love to him and he didn't tell you about it guess what when he comes back he's going to get fired and he's not going to take that risk he's not going to do that he's going to make sure that the proper instruction is given so when when he brings that and it's in such simplicity and it's just so as we would say so simple why make it more than what he said it was why not just rest in the simplicity that he says believe what he said and conduct yourself with joy amongst the trials that he sees fit to bring your way it's really that simple that's how we prove our love to him per the prophet he moves back to the gentleman asked her do you have a place to take her after you marry he says yes i do he never told him it was a boxcar brother branham didn't ask it wasn't important what it was he just says do you have a place because he wasn't going to go out and do an inspection on the place the point was he just had a place so he did have a place he said yes i do and they moved on to the next step obviously we know that christ has a place for us he says if i leave you i will come again and get you again because i'm going to prepare a place for you we know in revelation chapter 5 that he opened the door to that place for us into heavenly places so he did have a place he prepared that place and he took us to that place revelation chapter 4 he tells his bride to come up hither if he's going to tell her to come somewhere that obviously means he has somewhere for her he has somewhere he's wanting her to go so that'll finish our review portion if you want any more than that you can go back and listen to it yourself we're going to move forward here into this next question that he asked brother brown says i said all right now i said i want to ask you something i understand you're working up here on the pwa and he said yes sir says that's about 12 a week said do you think you can make a living for her now remember he's already asked her do you have some place to take her he answered yes but now he says can you make a living for her he says i'll do all that i can twelve dollars a week i'll do all that i can brother brandon says well that's all right twelve dollars a week twelve dollars a week brother brandon says that's all right why why did he say that's all right he wasn't worried about the numerical figure he wasn't worried about the dollar figure he was worried about what the man said he says i will do all that i can that was the that was the important part do you think you can make a living for her he said i'll do all that i can john 6 53 says then jesus said unto them now we have to remember he's already said he's got a place for them but now this is about a living making and living for her what is the living he has to feed her and he has to clothe her right i mean we all learned that in school the three elements of survival food uh shelter and clothing right i mean we have food water and clothing we have to have those three elements so he's got he's got the shelter for her but is he going to be able to feed her and is he going to be able to clothe her john 6 53 then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is me indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father has sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever so obviously we're looking that at the natural typing it to the spiritual this gentleman tells brother man i make 12 dollars a week i will do all that i can to feed her and clothe her christ comes on the scene and he says i am the bread that came down from heaven why does he need to tell them his bride that he is the bread that came down from heaven because he knows this principle and he's looking to move into a marriage he's already told him i'm going to prepare a place for you i will go i will prepare a place for you i will come again and gets you and gets you but in that meantime he still has to feed her and he still has to clothe her and christ knows these principles for a true marriage and he says my my flesh is meat indeed my blood is drink indeed and if you will eat of my flesh and drink of my blood you shall have life he that eateth of this bread shall live forever it sounds like to me he's meeting the requirement revelation 10 verse 8 says and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel with standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up why didn't he tell him to take it and stand on it because that's not his responsibility his responsibility is to feed his bride and to clothe his bride take it eat it up and it will shell it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as hunting 1965 the anointed one at the end time brother branham said it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man very familiar quote but why is he drawing attention to this why is he laying this down why is it so important that we recognize what we're eating because this is a requirement that god himself has laid out for a proper marriage i must feed this lady i must clothe this lady can i make a living for her it sounds like to me he can make a living for us it sounds like to me that he has provided food for us isaiah 61 verse 10 says i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decath himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with jewels revelation 19 verse 7 we just read let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the land has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints why is there so many references to feeding and clothing go search the scriptures why is it always about i've got a place for you here's food here's clothing because the whole picture is the marriage and god knows the principles to the proper marriage that's why it's always talking about i've got a place for you come through an open door i will clothe you with my word i will clothe you in righteousness eat the book see it's all of these small things pointing to the bigger picture it's all of the small things pointing to the whole picture which is the marriage verse 13 and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed clothed in fine linen white and clean revelation 21 verse 1 says and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband sounds like she's clothed to me sounds like she's been fed to me sounds like he has met his end of the deal even at twelve dollars a week present sage of my ministry brother branham says i hope he will crown my ministry of this of letting me take the cloth of the word and dress his bride in the cloth of the word for his righteousness and i hope he will crown me let me stand on that they say behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world why is this prophet's request of all things that he he could request why would his request be to take the cloth of the word and to clothe the bride because he knows the principles he knows what it's all about he knows this is about a marriage and he knows that the obligation that god has to his spiritual right is the same that a man has to his natural bride he's got to feed her he's got to clothe her why would eliezer want to do anything else why would he want to do anything else this is what god wants to do this is what god has to do and if he wants to be about god's business he knows that he has to do what god wants done which is to meet his principles which is to meet his requirements to feed her and to clothe her he cares do you care 1963. listen to this statement jesus cared enough for the message of today to bring these same things to pass as he said till he died and rose again to send them by the holy spirit i'm going to read it again jesus cared enough for the message of today to bring these same things to pass as he said till he died and rose again to send them by the holy spirit well i thought he just died on calvary for my sins he did well i accept calvary i accept god i'm a christian the prophet of god said jesus died on calvary for this message so if you try to tell me that you can set this message aside but yet still accept calvary it doesn't line up he says he he cared so much for this message to bring this message that he died and rose again to send them by the holy spirit you can't accept one without accepting the other saints it is impossible his ministry today that he's still alive he cared enough won't we care that's the thing won't we care he died for this ministry so if you reject this ministry what have you rejected you've rejected his death and there is no way that he can feed you and clothe you and prepare a place for you that's remember what we're talking about what did brother branham ask this guy can you make a living for her and what was his response at twelve dollars a week living going to take her to live in a boxcar his response was i'll do all that i can do is that not the same response christ has had i will do all that i can do to the point i will give my life for this ministry so that they can be properly clothed out of a laodicean condition out of a low see later with cnh that i can clothe them properly at that time and all the darkness and nakedness of the world i will still do all that i can do i will die 2 000 years ago i will literally give my life i will die so that they can have truth to be clothed in 2000 years from now this this man who was in real bad need of a haircut answered the prophet the same way christ himself would answer the prophet i will do all that i can do he turns to the sister he says what if he gets out of a job sis what if he loses his job what are you going to do are you going to run back up home to mama to papa she said no sir i'm going to stay with him what if he loses his job what if it looks like he's not going to be able to take care of you what are you going to do think spiritually saints don't get lost in the natural the natural is important yes if your husband gets out of a job and you run back to mama and papa you're out of the will of the lord you're wrong but think spiritually also in the natural he gets out of a job things look tight as we as we touched on last sunday if you start if you start thinking that you're going to start fending for yourself maybe you won't run back to mama and papa but maybe you'll run out and try to fend for yourself you're out of the will of the lord it's not it's not the proper pattern here what if he loses his job sister what are you going to do are you going to run back all remember this is the same problem that started this whole thing saints in the garden eve tried to fend for herself let's not go let's not get so spiritually lifted up in our position that we can start that we can start deviating from the pattern and do the same mistake that happened in the beginning to bring all of this about eve stepped out and tried to fend for herself she tried to shift for herself she tried to make something happen because she didn't have a proper understanding and she didn't have proper trust in adam to fulfill this word remember the word was multiply and replenish the earth the the motive was not a bad motive it was a motherly motive it was a motherly instinct she recognized that was her position she recognized that's what she was to do but brother branham says where adam lacked was he lacked in the knowledge of how to reproduce himself so adam is lacking in this knowledge god has withheld this knowledge from him at this point in time so how can he give it to his wife but in that meantime his wife gets impatient and she doesn't have trust in him let's put it this way adam adam lost his job and what did eve do did she stick with him or did she go try to fend for herself think spiritually i was praying in the back before i came out and you would just have to be really i'm just going to say this you all forgive me i'm it may sound really blunt but we've we've recognized the last several services god is trying to say something very specific very clear to the point that it's almost laughable like this is kind of obvious at this point everybody's saying the same thing but nobody can help it we don't have anything else to say everybody's saying the same thing but i was just praying in the back before i came out and i was asking the lord it's like help me not to miss it what specifically is this about everybody's coming along and just saying the same thing everybody's in the same vein everybody's saying this what specifically is it and i didn't hear a voice but just what dropped in my heart was this very clear i don't want my bride trying to fend for herself that is what this is about saints that's as clear as i know how to make it maybe we should sing him and go out but that's as clear as i know how to make it that is the point of all of this the laodicean age is all about that woman fending for herself it's wrong in the natural and it's wrong in the spiritual and if i had to wrap everything up everything that's been preached here for brother kyle from brother chad from brother burley for myself everything the the last several services that is what god is trying to say is i don't want my bride to fend for herself because if you try to fend for yourself you're going to mess it up that's why he's asking this sister this question what are you going to do sis when it gets tough because tough times are coming saints there's too many scriptures and too many quotes to support that and furthermore if tough times weren't coming it would break this marriage pattern because the whole reason that brother branham is asking this lady what she's going to do when tough times come is because he knows there's going to be tough times come so don't try to tell me that there's not going to be a politically backed persecution before this bride leaves the earth it would actually break this pattern there is going to be tough times come what are you going to do what are we going to do as an individual when things are tough and maybe our pastor doesn't even have the answer you sure don't have the answer the deacons don't have the answer the trustees don't have the answer you don't have the answer the pastor don't have the answer nobody's got the answer we're all out of a job what are we going to do what are we going to do are we going to run back to mama and papa are we going to run back to our own understanding are we going to run back to our own knowledge are we going to run back to our own thought process are we going to fend for ourself there's nothing wrong with not knowing the answer there is something wrong with trying to make up the answer and that is what started all of this in the beginning that is what we have to not do to reverse it it how much better now we understand the big picture we know as brother chad has been bringing out we know eve had to fall we know that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world we know she had to fall so his expressions could be made manifest but i'm with with that understanding just think how much better would it have been or what would the result have been if eve would have simply rested and when he says and he comes you know you were made this way this is your purpose this is what you're supposed to do you were designed for this this is the way that it's supposed to be what if she would have just said i don't know that looks great looks okay looks like it might be right but my husband hasn't told me that yet so i don't know see that was the deviation in the beginning that is the deviation that has to be reversed in the end and that is what god if you leave here with nothing else this morning don't walk out of these doors in times that are coming and try to fend for yourself spiritually let your husband come on the scene and let him fend for you let him come on the scene and feed you and clothe you and make a place for you don't try to fend for yourself do not make the same mistake what if he loses his job sister are you going to run back home to mama and papa don't run back to your own knowledge don't run back to your own reasoning let me ask you this has it ever worked for you in the past and you think when more pressure comes and more situations come and it gets it gets harder and it gets more intense that all of a sudden now your reasoning is going to work it's not going to work saints it's not going to work we have to put our trust in him totally we half at 12 a week we have to put our trust in him living in a boxcar with newspaper tacked up onto the wall we have to keep our trust in him you know i found that ironic when brother branham goes through all of this he marries them they go and they live in their boxcar he does his sneaking up on them acting like he's checking the lines so he can see how they're doing and when he gets there what are they talking about they've got all the money laid out on the table and the only thing that this man is concerned about is buying this lady another dress oh that's a good story that's cute tearjerker saints it's not a story the only concern this man has is clothing this lady he had it then he has it now he always will have it it's in such simplicity that we just drive right over top of it his concern is to clothe you allow him to clothe you don't go try to make your own clothes don't go try to fend for yourself allow him to clothe you she said no sir i'm going to stay with him psalms 31 verse 23 says o love the lord all ye his saints for the lord preserveth the faithful and plentiful rewardeth the proud doer who is he going to reward the faithful the faithful not the one that tries to go and do it themselves he's going to reward the faithful psalms 89 my covenant will i not break nor alter the thing that is going out of my lips once i have sworn by my holiness that i will not lie unto david his seed shall endure forever and his throne as the son before me it shall be established forever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven selah how will it be established forever as the moon why the moon why the moon because the moon is the bride and what is the bride the bride is faithful it shall be established forever mike he's speaking of his covenant with david it shall be established forever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven psalms 101 6 mine eyes shall be upon the faithful not the ones that run back to mama and papa his eyes will be on the faithful the ones that just stand there say i don't know i don't have the answer my husband hasn't told me but i'm sure not going to do something on my own i'm sure not going to try to make something up i'm going to stand here and i'm going to be faithful on what he showed me mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land that they may dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way he shall serve me isaiah 1 18 come now let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land but if you refuse and rebel you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it how is the faithful city become a harlot how is the faithful city become a harlot it was full of judgment and righteousness lodged in it but now murderers thy silver has become drost thy wine mixed with water thy princes are rebellious in companies of thieves everyone loveth gifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fatherless neither do the doeth the cause of the widow come unto them therefore oh my goodness did you hear that verse saints 33 23 thy princes are rebellious and companies of thieves everyone loveth gifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fatherless neither doeth the cause of the widow coming to them who's he talking about since he's talking about the ministry because it's the ministry's job to look after the fatherless it's the ministry's job to look after the widow but what did they do they became rebellious thieves loving gifts following after rewards how is it the faithful city has become a harlot therefore saith the lord the lord of hosts the mighty one of israel i will ease me of mine adversaries and avenge me of mine enemies and i will turn my hand upon them purely purge away thy dross and take away all thy ten and i will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counselors as at the beginning who's he talking about the ministry i will restore thy judges as the first and thy counselors as at the beginning afterward thou shalt be called afterward after i do this after i restore thou shalt be called the city of righteousness the faithful city why did he have to send us a prophet saints why did he have to send us malachi 4 because they had become thieves they had become robbers they didn't care about the fatherless they didn't care about the widow they cared about gifts they cared about rewards but he says you have turned into a harlot the ministry has fallen they've turned my church into a harlot but i will restore i will send my true word i will send my true word and after that after i have restored the judges and the counselors after i have restored the word through the ministry thou shalt be called the city of righteousness the faithful city ephesians 1 verse 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints where which are ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus why did he ask this little lady this question because he wanted her to tell him i'm going to be faithful because if she tells him i'm going to be faithful now he can identify her in the scripture now he can say it's going to be okay because if she's going to be faithful she will be the moon she will be the faithful city she will be the righteous city she will be the one that paul will speak to paul is not speaking to the unfaithful paul is not speaking to a bride that's going to defend her finn for herself paul is speaking to the faithful in christ jesus if you're not faithful in christ jesus paul is not even speaking to you but if you are the faithful in christ jesus paul is speaking directly to you paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be unto you why is grace unto you because you're faithful you're not fending for yourself you're trusting in him grace be to you and peace why is peace given to you because you're faithful from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ why do you have spiritual blessings because you're faithful why have you been called up into heavenly places because you're faithful do you get any of that if you're not faithful no why is it important that this little lady responds to the prophet i'm not running back to mama and papa i'm not going to try to fend for myself oh you say well that's just a good question it is it's a good question but the spiritual principle that lays behind it allows this prophet to know that if she's going to be faithful and she's not going to run off and try to do her own thing she's going to be a representation of the faithful city and now there is nothing withholding from her now nothing stands in the way blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed you with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love how many wants to be holy and without blame before him in love be faithful be faithful and you can be having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved colossians 1 verse 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy timotheus our brother to the saints and faithful brethren in christ which were which are at colosse why is it always to the faithful because god because god is not going to speak to a flirter god is not going to come home at the end of his work day and try to find his wife wondering where she's at wondering where she's gallivanting around at now and then just express himself to anybody he's going to come home at the end of his work day at the end of the laodicean age at the end of the seventh day when he's going into his rest he's going to come home and he's going to sit down and say there is my faithful wife and reveal himself to her to the saints and faithful brethren which are in christ which were which are at colosse grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ first peter 4 19 wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him and well doing as unto a faithful creator what are you going to do when it gets tough sis are you going to run back to mama and papa let him let them that suffer at 12 an hour 12 a week sorry inflation you know how it works let them that suffer at 12 a week according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him and well doing as unto a faithful creator revelation 2 10 fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer pretty self-explanatory fear none of those things that thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life do you want a crown of life be faithful unto death if you don't want a crown of life go fend for yourself go make your own way lean to your own reasoning plan your way out of it go get a credit card go get some more bills go get some more pills i meant to say you need the credit card for the bills don't try to fend for yourself whether it's emotionally financially physically or spiritually don't try to fend for yourself because if you do you will automatically reproduce the same thing eve reproduced the scripture's already been set you're not going to change it fend for yourself and you will produce a cane you will produce something that is unregenerable unconvertible never work in the program of god don't fend for yourself be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life revelation 17 14 these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is the lord of lord and the king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful you say well i'm called and i'm chosen praise the lord not there yet still not there yet still running back to mama and papa are you called are you chosen and are you faithful when the son of man returns will he find faith or will he find people still trying to fend for themselves will they will he still find people trying to reason their way out or something no when the son of man returns he will find faith and why will he find faith because he has restored the ministry and now she is the faithful city they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful he turns back to the gentleman he said what sir if you have three or four children nothing to feed them and you haven't got any work what are you going to do are you going to send her away he says no sir i'll struggle right on we will make it somehow deuteronomy 7 verse 9 know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god which keepeth covenant and mercy with him that lo with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations first corinthians 10 13 there hath no temptation taking you but such is is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that ye may be able to bear it hebrews 10 23 let us hold fast fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised hebrews 11 11 through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past aged because she judged him faithful who had promised how did she conceive because she judged him who was faithful she judged him as faithful who had given her the promise she didn't run back to mama and papa at this point she had already tried her own way remember didn't work out too swell funny thing is what did it produce an ishmael what did brother brandon say ishmael was unregenerable unconvertible aka kane it's detrimental to try to make our own way saints it is detrimental it will cause this cycle to continue over and over and over in the big picture and in your daily life keep trying to make your own way financially it's going to be unconvertible and unregeneratable it will not work try to solve your emotional problems it's going to be unregenerable and unconvertible it will never work try to fix your spiritual problems not going to work the pattern is already there it will not work in any instance but if you judge him as faithful you can conceive and you can bear the son of man again if you judge him as faithful see the funny thing is you can never you can never be faithful as much as you want to be you can never be faithful unless you judge him as faithful because we love him because he first loved us if he wasn't faithful we would have no capacity to be faithful if he wasn't faithful we would have no desire to be faithful because remember what we're talking about he's choosing a bride and he's brother branham says a man always chooses what's on the inside of him why is he looking for a faithful bride because he's faithful why is he not looking for a bride who wants to fend for him for herself because he never offended for himself when he was here why is he looking for a bride that will be satisfied with twelve dollars a week is because he was satisfied with the allotment the father gave him when he was here why is he looking for these characteristics why is he desiring for you to display these characteristics is because these are his characteristics and if you will be as sarah and you will judge him as faithful big picture and little picture then he can move then he can come on the scene it's got to the point now saints that anymore whenever something rises up the first thing i try to do is go to god and tell them i can't fix this because you know the first thing that i always wanted to do and it's in my dna to do is see problem fixed problem it's my specialty c problem fixed problem see problem fix problem some of us get more of a dose of that than others i got a lot of it my daddy had a lot of it his daddy had a lot of it it's what we're known for working and fixing problems it's not always a good thing unless he tells you how to fix the problem first and then you see the problem you can fix the problem but it's got to the point that when something rises up i try i haven't perfected it yet but i try to pump the brakes and say lord i can't fix this because even if i think i can fix it i know i really can't because even if i think i can let's just take something carnal there's a bill that needs paid i can't pay that bill but i can pay that bill if i work this other job or i work an extra job whatever the case may be so that you see the problem you fix the problem but what if he doesn't even give you health and strength to work that job how are you going to fix the problem you can't so if he doesn't even give you health and strength to work i'm not saying there's anything working the overtime or work in the other job it may be perfectly right it may be the answer to the solution it may be what god has put there to fix it but if you say i'm going to do that because i can see how that will work it's not going to work and even if it does it doesn't give glory to him so what's the purpose of it if your life doesn't give glory to him and everything what's the purpose of even living but if he comes and he says i've presented and i've prepared and i've i have allowed this job here in this situation to provide the funds for this bill that needs paid and that's the way i want you to fix that now who has fixed the problem and now who is obligated to give you health and strength to go and do that job it's really that simple it really is it is really that simple but we get so prideful and we get so arrogant and we get such such faith in ourselves that we think we can take care of ourselves and the scripture says you can't even breathe unless he gives you breath so don't try to convince me that you can fix your problems because you couldn't even breathe to provide oxygen into your lungs and into your brain cells to even reason out a problem if he didn't even give you breath to do it you say well that's really elementary it really is but we have got so prideful in our in our own knowledge just as lucifer did he got so lifted up in his own capacity that he failed to even recognize i can't even get out of bed unless he gets me out of bed but it's got to the point that that's how i try to approach it now and most of the time i'm actually kind of right because if something happens to the vehicle lord knows i i can't fix it like i can put gas in it i can change the oil if i have to i can hear up the tires but something else happens it's not going it's not going to work it is not going to work i am not going to be able to fix that you say well that's really trivial it is but it works the windshield washer square quit spraying on my vehicle i am so humble at this point that i just said ain't no way i can fix that i'm taking it somebody who can so i called the guy i said hey i've got to bring this in it's not spraying i'm not even getting into it like i know my capacity i know my limitations if you need a deer it needs killed call me if you need the turkey need skill call me you need somebody spied on call me but you need a vehicle fixed not me i said i know my capacity i don't deal in this realm when can i bring it in he says well do me a favor before you do that just pop the hood look up under there there's usually a little rubber hose that goes into the back of the nozzle those pop off a lot of times and it won't spray yeah but you don't know me you don't know my luck with vehicles you don't understand it'll be more complicated than that no it was literally that simple i said god i don't know how to fix that i've got to take it to somebody please help me with this situation i call the guy he says just check the rubber nozzle now i know you all are laughing at me because you're like yeah i would have done that you know you're ignorant for not even knowing that i am i'm sorry it's just the way that it is but he says just look back there those rubber hoses pop off a lot of times you can plug them back on and everything will be fine pop the hood the rubber hoses had popped off plugged it back on it was fine i needed to get a little like two dollar nozzle to replace it with because it got plugged up and that's why the hose had popped off but it's that simple saints and he wants to operate on that level and on a heavenly level from the lowest of lows to the simple of simple to the point that you're setting on the throne with him not fending for yourself and if we can't get it right in the simple things we will never get it right in the spiritual things the scripture says that he that is not faithful in the little things and no wise will get greater things we have to come to that recognition on a daily basis i can't fix this i don't know the next step i don't know what to do and if you do that's fine just recognize that he's the one that's gave you the knowledge to know what to do don't think it's yourself don't think it's something that you came up with don't get prideful and lifted up where am i at sarah judged him faithful that's how she was able to produce a promised son revelation 1 5 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth and to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood who is the faithful witness jesus is the faithfulness why is he looking for a faithful witness as the moon in the sky because he is the faithful witness that's why he's looking for a faithful witness revelation 3 14 and unto the angel of the church of the lord it seems right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness why does he keep repeating himself see it's scriptural what i do i keep repeating myself in the scripture god does the same thing why does he keep repeating himself why does he keep drawing attention to this because as he is so are we in this world why does he want us to be faithful and true is because he is faithful and true why is he choosing a bride that is faithful and true is because that is what's on the inside of him revelation 19 11 and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that set up on him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth make that he doth judge and make war isaiah 49 15 can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet will i not forget thee sounds like to me he is faithful remember we're dealing with the question brother branham turned to the man and he asked her ask him what are you going to do when things get tough what are you going to do when you got too many children to feed and you can't make it what are you going to do are you going to send this bride away you've brought her through luther you've brought her through wesley you brought her through the pentecost but now it's a load of seeing and things are tight it's dark it is hard to make a living what are you going to do lord are you going to send this bride back into another age are you don't get confused about into another age are you going to send her back into another condition are you going to just leave her in a justified condition are you just going to leave her in a sanctified condition are you just going to leave her with the gifts of the spirit because things are tight things are tough it's dark are you just going to leave her there are you going to send her back into that it's safe there it's safe there mama and papa will take care of her what did the lord say he said no i will die i will die here on calvary so that i can clothe her two thousand years from now i will die here on calvary i will give everything that i am so that she does not have to stay in those conditions that i can bring her out of those conditions and literally make her as i am she will be on the earth i will not leave her in an incomplete condition i will bring her into the fullness of the word made flesh i will not leave her with just an anointing but i will i will bring her to the point that the holy spirit indwells her i will bring her to the point that i indwell her myself i will not send her away when things get tough i will make a way for her i will struggle on i won't leave her in those those conditions i will open that door for her i will open that door into heavenly places even if it cost me my life and it did per the prophet he died for this ministry he died so you have no excuses he died so that you have no no way back you don't have to run back you can move forward in the word you can be as he is in this earth he died for that he didn't just send you back he didn't send you away till things got easier it's not going to get easier but he died to make that way for you he died to prepare this word for you so that you could be clothed so that you could be faithful are you going to send her back to mama and papa things are tight things are rough things are dark are you going to just leave her there in her own in her own reasoning in her own thinking maybe she makes it maybe she doesn't he says no no we'll struggle on we will make a way somehow how's he going to do it saints i don't know i don't know how is he going to overcome this load of cnh on 12 a week i have no idea but i know he died so that he could and i know he has washed me and he has forgiven my sins and covered them with his own blood the sins of my unbelief the sins of my not understanding the sins of my ignorance he died to bring a word so that we don't have to stay in that condition we don't have to stay in a condition of sin by ignorance we can move into a proper understanding if you want to stay in ignorance you can but you don't have to if you if you see that was the that was the issue with the lotus c and ages they wanted to stay into that they thought they were rich they thought they were closed they thought they could see but they were ignorant to the fact that they couldn't they were wretched and blind and naked and poor and miserable but they didn't know any better because they were ignorant because they refused the i south but you don't have to stay in that condition because he died that you didn't have to he says a woman may forget her sucking child but i will not forget my bride sounds like to me he's faithful sounds like to me he meets the requirement deuteronomy 31 6 be strong of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the lord thy god he it is that doeth go with thee that he will not fail thee nor forsake thee sounds like he's faithful to me hebrews 13 5 let your conversation be without covetedness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee philippians 1 verse 3 i thank my god paul's speaking i thank my god upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day into now being confident of this thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ why does he want you to be faithful because he is faithful and he's going to express his faithfulness through you musicians if you'll come we're going to wrap this up revelation 21 verse 5 and he that set upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and you guessed it faithful what are you going to do lord when things get tough you want to send her away you want to tell her to make her own way you're going to tell her good luck and walk out the door he says no no i am going to open a door for her into heavenly realms i'm going to call her up a little higher to where she can see things for what they really are and i'm going to impart into her before the foundation of the world the capacity to be faithful and trust in me and then i'm going to stand back and i'm going to watch and i'm going to watch as she chooses to be faithful unto me you say well that's kind of rigged it is it is but would you have it any other way brother branham says he could predestinate because he foreknew he foreknew the decision you would make therefore he could predestinate you to have the capacity to believe would you have it any other way do you want it to rest on your willpower your ability to get it right or are you comfortable and are you okay with him rigging it and giving you that capacity right he says write this down john for my words are true and my words are faithful we get to the end of this and brother branham says now let me just review the questions real quick we're at an hour and 15 minutes so i'll get you out under two hours just focus real quickly on this he comes and he's this man has chosen a bride and brother branham is going to do the marriage but before this marriage can take place there has to be this preamble to the marriage this conversation has to take place and it has to take place to the point that he tells this boy listen to what i'm saying i want to talk to you you're not paying attention he asked this girl are you old enough to get married are you spiritually mature enough to move into a marriage do you have your written permission have you done everything i've told you to do have you repented have you been baptized in my name are you spiritually mature enough are you old enough to be married he asked this man the type of our lord do you love her he answers affirmative he asked her do you love him she says yes i do he asked the man do you have some place to take her the lord responds i will go away i will come again but i'm going to prepare a place for you can we see this clearly can we see the prophet going through this pattern because he knows the pattern that god has set he says yes i do have a place for her i've opened the door up in the heavenly rooms i've got a box car for her with newspaper tacked to the wall good enough you've got a place for her he says what are you going to do for a living for her can you feed her can you clothe her can our lord feed us has he fed us has he clothed us what are you going to do sis when it gets tough what are you going to do little bride when it gets tough are you going to run back into your own understanding from another age from another dispensation from your genetic makeup maybe you have a little bit of a intelligence just because your brain cells haven't broken down completely yet from hybrid food maybe you maybe you have a little bit of ability to look at things and reason them out are you going to rely upon that what are you going to do little bride when it gets tight she says i'm just going to stand right here i'm just going to stick it out i'm just going to stay right with him i'm not going to fend for myself what are you going to do lord what are you going to do when looted seeing comes and all the floodgates of hell are open and hell has literally spilled out on the earth spilled out onto earth what are you going to do how are you going to make a living for how are you going to clothe her how are you going to keep her from he that i don't know i don't know but i will do all that i can i will give my life so that i can take care of them two thousand years from now we will struggle right on we will make it somehow but he goes through all of this and then this is his final statement he says i felt little i felt little why did he feel little because he's running them through the ringer he's running them through the ringer he's asking hard questions he's running them through the ringer and asking them hard questions and all along they really did love each other and he says i felt little he felt bad he felt bad for asking them all these questions because they before they even walked in they really did love each other why would he feel bad for asking them all these questions because before they walked in they really did love each other already see this is the indication of a true ministry the ministry's job is to make you fall in love with christ and once you do that he don't need to keep asking you hard questions or tearing you down or making sure everything's okay or what kind of house do you have to take her to a boxcar has that been inspected has child protective services looked at that that wasn't the point the point of the ministry's job was to get you in love with christ jesus and then any true ministry that would keep prying into that and discrediting that and making you try to doubt that and getting you into a works program it shows that they're prideful because they should feel bad about that that's what the prophet did that's what he said i'm not making it up he said it at the end of all of this when he came to a proper understanding these two people love each other lord i sure feel bad for asking them all these questions look at the humility look at the homeless you see look remember the big picture remember the big picture this is choosing of abroad this is eliezer standing on the west coast calling out a bride literally and when eliezer went and he found rebecca and he said this is my intention this is representation these are the gifts of my master take them here's some for your family and then he says will you go she says i'm going to go i will go i will go eliezer did not say well that's great have you looked at these gifts over here i have more gifts he did not divert the focus back to himself when she said i'll go he said let's go why because eliezer was not going to marry rebecca eliezer's job was to get rebecca in love with isaac so she would go to him and when she came to the point that she was really willing to forsake her own way of living her mama and papa think spiritually when she got to the point that she was willing to forsake her own reasoning and trust solely in him this man that she had never visibly seen before but she already knew when she came to the point that she says i will go eliezer says let's go he never broke out any more gifts he never even tried to give any more gifts to laban when she says i'm willing to go eliezer said let's go they got on the camels and they left it was laban it was the family it was their own reasoning it was your own reasoning that tried to say stick around just a little bit longer do you have any more of those bracelets those were pretty dynamic when you brought them out thank spiritually saints there wasn't anything wrong with the bracelets and the earrings and the all the gold that he had wasn't anything wrong the purpose was to be a representation of her husband but once she fell in love with the husband he never tried to sell her any more bracelets he never tried to give her any more earrings he never tried to do anything else and that is exactly what brother branham was fleshing out he's standing here on the west coast as eliezer trying to call that pentecostal age out trying to call them out he comes at the very first of the service and he says now you know my ministry no man can do this only god can do this what's he doing he's introducing the bridegroom no man can do this it has to be god he doing he's showing the bride the bracelets he's showing her the earrings he's giving gifts to laban but what was the purpose so he could come to the end of that remember the two scriptures he read eliezer and the seventh vile angel the seventh vile angel is the same angel that showed john the city the faithful city as a bride adorned for her husband the purpose wasn't just eliezer eliezer was here to give gifts to make her fall in love with her husband to recognize her husband to get on the camel and take her to her husband and when she got on the campbell he wasn't interested in sticking around to show more gifts to laban he wasn't interested in saying hey rebecca well come over here there's one box that i forgot i know you're in love with isaac i know you want to go but i've got something i've got something for you think spiritually saints when eleazar got rebecca in love with isaac he says let's go because i want to go back home i want to get off the scene because i'm not going to marry you isaac's going to marry you marry you ellie easier was not i'm trying to stop but eliezer was not wanting to stick around with rebecca's family he wanted to get back to his own family therefore he wasn't interested in sticking around to show laban what a great ministry he had when he was done rebecca's on the camel we're going to see isaac he was not interested in showing himself off regardless of what gifts he still had on the camel to laban he says i'm out of here i'm going back to my family that's exactly what eliza did as we stand tell me that's not what brother branham did he came he called out a bride he introduced that bride to her bridegroom and then he said i must decrease he must increase i probably won't be around much longer but these tapes they'll live on it's the same pattern saints it's the same pattern in such a simple story but think think about how many scriptures were fulfilled when he was standing there behind that pulpit preaching that message it is mind-boggling literally i'm not saying types and shadows i mean he's literally fleshing out these scriptures remember the point of eleazar you'll just play something softly remember the point of eliezer eliezer was there to get rebecca for a marriage for a marriage he didn't find rebecca and then just leave her there he found rebecca put her through an open door put her onto a camel and took her somewhere [Music] the point is not to recognize the church ages saints the point is to recognize the church ages so you can recognize the messenger so you can get through the open door so you can get on the camel and go to isaac the point is not the relationship the point is not just to stay in that stage of the relationship the point is to get married so that you can reproduce christ himself again anything short of that is rebecca on a camel out in the middle of nowhere running around with all her bracelets and earrings the point is the marriage and that is exactly what brother random came in choosing of abraham as the seventh mile angel the same angel that showed john the city descending out of god descending from from god out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband the same seventh angel is the same one that declared me and you that revealed me and you to ourselves that's what choosing of a bride was all about was to reveal you to you so that you could be faithful and chosen and put your faith in him not fend for yourself because if you really know you are the bride of jesus christ why do you need to take care of yourself in the natural if you really know who your husband is and you have faith in him why do you need to try to fend for yourself in any aspect financially emotionally physically whatever it's across the board we have to put all of our faith in him don't fend for yourself because the struggles are coming the struggles are here the struggles are coming don't run back to mama and papa do not run back to your own reasoning do not try to fend for yourself trust in your husband the revealed word let's pray together precious lord jesus father help us lord help us lord i will make the same mistake that eve made in the garden lord we are so degraded in our hybridization that it is just a miracle and your supernatural keeping power that we are even in our right minds lord the world has descended into hell into pure insanity and chaos and it all stems back to one thing to one woman tried to make something happen herself lord let us not be that woman let us not make that same mistake and we thank you lord that you predestinated us not to or we would there would be no way around that we have no capacity to keep ourselves but we are so grateful that you have predestinated us not to make that fall and as such you had to restore the judges and the counselors and the ministry to give us this word that you sent us a prophet to reveal yourself through so that we would not make that same fatal mistake that we could recognize our husband the revealed word and that we could come out of a laodicean condition and that we could enter completely into you and just rest in you to get into heavenly places and allow you to fight our battles to allow you to feed us to allow you to clothe us to allow you to shelter us lord father i pray as we would come to the close of this service lord that you would help us not to try to make our own way not to fix our own problems but to rest and acknowledge you lord to acknowledge you in all things that you could direct our paths we love you we appreciate you we are so thankful for what you have given us and lord as you died to bring this to us may we die to ourselves and receive it we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ the bride says amen god bless you let's sing brother [Music] provided you need he's
