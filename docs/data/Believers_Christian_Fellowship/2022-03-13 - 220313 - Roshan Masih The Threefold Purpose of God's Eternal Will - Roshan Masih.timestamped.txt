[5:28] starting to see some of the brothers
[5:29] come back through and brother roshan is
[5:31] certainly a very good friend of ours one
[5:33] that's been here several times and we've
[5:35] benefited from his ministry so we're
[5:37] excited to have him preaching today
[5:39] he'll also be taking the wednesday night
[5:41] service for us and he's preaching this
[5:43] afternoon at the youth meeting so we

[6:01] active in outreach and in translation
[6:03] and hosting ministers meetings and

[6:08] very very busy brother and the lord has
[6:10] really blessed him and gifted him that

[7:11] you we want you to feel welcome amen may
[7:14] we all enter in
[7:15] right now and let's look beyond the veil
[7:18] because really for us it doesn't matter
[7:20] what veil stands here
[7:22] as long as god has placed a gift down in
[7:24] there then god can use that gift to
[7:26] speak to his children and so we must
[7:28] look beyond the veil and connect to god
[7:30] because this is the channel that god
[7:32] promised to use and if we have respect
[7:34] for that we can benefit from that
[7:36] so let's look beyond the veil
[7:39] and
[7:40] receive what our lord has for us today

[10:43] amen
[10:45] may the lord bless you all so it's a
[10:48] privilege to come again
[10:52] and
[10:54] i
[10:55] thank you brother chad and his family
[10:57] for their
[10:59] loving spirit and hospitality
[11:02] and for all of you praying for us
[11:05] and helping the work we are doing there
[11:08] so
[11:10] may the lord bless you all
[11:13] so before we say it
[11:15] i would like to read to scripture from
[11:17] the bible
[11:20] those both scriptures are found in the
[11:23] new testament
[11:25] first i would like to read
[11:27] revelation
[11:29] 22
[11:30] 17
[11:35] and then we will read from the book of
[11:37] galatians
[11:45] and the spirit and the bride say come
[11:49] and let him that here
[11:51] say come
[11:53] and let him that is a thirst come
[11:57] and whosoever will
[11:59] let him take the water of life freely
[12:03] and another scripture galatians 1 15 16.
[12:09] when it pleased god
[12:11] who set me apart from my mother's womb
[12:15] and called me through his grace
[12:17] to reveal his son in me
[12:24] so may the lord add his blessings upon
[12:26] the reading of his word
[12:28] you may be seated please
[12:40] god bless you again
[12:43] i have few things in my mind i was
[12:46] studying
[12:47] the messages lately
[12:50] and
[12:51] that's what i would like to
[12:53] share with you
[12:55] and i hope that it will be a blessing
[12:59] to all of us
[13:02] and
[13:05] that's about
[13:08] what god is doing now in the present
[13:11] tense
[13:14] we know that whatever
[13:16] god does there is a purpose
[13:19] and there is nothing
[13:21] without the purpose
[13:24] and we are here
[13:26] on this earth
[13:28] to fulfill
[13:30] that purpose
[13:32] and god has called us
[13:35] for a purpose
[13:38] that's what i'm going to preach this
[13:40] morning
[13:41] the eternal
[13:43] will of
[13:44] god's purpose
[13:46] or uh there is a three poor
[13:51] purpose of god's eternal will
[13:55] and
[13:56] that will
[13:58] is
[13:59] revealed to us
[14:01] that
[14:03] his will
[14:05] might be fulfilled in us
[14:08] so we have read here that
[14:12] in the last days
[14:15] bride
[14:16] as she
[14:18] eat the word
[14:20] eat the book she becomes the word
[14:23] and when she become the word
[14:26] whatsoever she speak the spirit is
[14:29] speaking
[14:30] through heart the bride
[14:33] so the bride
[14:35] and
[14:36] the spirit are saying the same thing
[14:39] because they both are one
[14:42] and then we read here
[14:45] paul is saying
[14:47] that when it pleased god
[14:51] who set me apart
[14:53] from my mother's womb
[14:55] so he said he set me apart he chosen me
[15:00] and the purpose that he chosen me
[15:03] is that
[15:04] he may reveal his son
[15:07] in me
[15:10] amen and we know that when god created
[15:14] everything
[15:15] in the beginning in the book of genesis
[15:18] chapter one and two
[15:20] we see the creation of god
[15:22] and a god who is full of wisdom
[15:26] he created everything according to his
[15:30] plan
[15:31] because when god started to
[15:33] create things
[15:35] he had a plan
[15:37] behind it
[15:38] and according to his plan
[15:40] and purpose he started to create things
[15:44] different things god is a creator
[15:47] and he can make
[15:49] everything in one day
[15:52] but he did not create everything in one
[15:55] day
[15:56] he created things in six days and he
[15:59] chose
[16:00] and planned and decided
[16:04] what to make
[16:06] what the
[16:09] and
[16:10] whatever he created
[16:13] it was his own expression
[16:16] the water is his expression he is a
[16:19] water of life
[16:20] when he created tree he is the tree of
[16:24] life
[16:25] when he created flowers he is
[16:28] the road of sharon
[16:30] so everything
[16:32] he created
[16:34] amen was his own expression
[16:40] everything in the universe
[16:42] was expressing him
[16:45] he created a lion
[16:47] before line comes on the earth it was
[16:50] already in heaven
[16:53] and god created something
[16:55] which was already in heaven
[16:58] that
[16:59] line which is in heaven
[17:01] on earth
[17:03] may be the expression of
[17:06] which is in heaven
[17:09] because we see there are four
[17:11] uh cherubims there one is like a man
[17:15] so
[17:16] whatever god was making visible
[17:20] it was an expression of invisible things
[17:24] and then
[17:25] god on the sixth day
[17:28] created man
[17:30] and the bible says
[17:32] god created man in his own image
[17:36] and in his own likeness
[17:42] so now
[17:44] sixth day
[17:46] god created man
[17:49] and man matches him
[17:53] everything god created was
[17:55] god's
[17:56] expression
[17:58] god was showing
[18:01] himself
[18:03] in the animal life
[18:05] through the plant life
[18:07] through the merry life different lives
[18:10] but it was all god
[18:13] he is everything he is the creator
[18:17] and he is the creation
[18:20] everything is he himself his own
[18:23] expression
[18:24] and when man came on the earth it was
[18:28] god's full expression
[18:32] in his own image and in his own likeness
[18:36] and when god created man god
[18:39] rested
[18:41] because
[18:43] now
[18:44] there was something who can practice the
[18:47] authority
[18:48] for god there was some
[18:51] one who can
[18:54] represent him because man
[18:57] was created to express god
[19:02] amen
[19:04] so that was the purpose
[19:07] of man
[19:11] on the earth
[19:13] in the beginning
[19:14] that
[19:15] man
[19:17] will be
[19:19] god's expression
[19:22] and the man may represent
[19:25] god
[19:27] amen
[19:28] that's the purpose
[19:30] god created and when there was a perfect
[19:33] man
[19:34] in perfect unity with god
[19:37] and then god rested
[19:39] that's what when in the millennium reign
[19:42] and now the word has opened to us and we
[19:45] are becoming the word as we eat the word
[19:48] and when we will come into the
[19:50] perfection of
[19:53] in the stature of perfect man then god
[19:56] is going to rest we will be at rest in
[19:59] the millennium so we see that
[20:02] god's purpose in creating man was for
[20:07] man to express god
[20:09] and represent him
[20:12] that is for man to be his expression
[20:16] and his representation
[20:19] this man this means
[20:21] we
[20:22] were created in a way
[20:24] that
[20:25] matches him so that he can enter into us
[20:31] though all his creation is expressing
[20:34] him but the man is created after his own
[20:38] likeness
[20:40] and he can enter
[20:42] into us
[20:44] and we can be full
[20:46] complete
[20:48] expression of god
[20:51] because only the man
[20:54] is after his own likeness and image amen
[20:57] so
[20:59] that's how the bible begins
[21:02] man
[21:04] and god
[21:05] in perfect unity
[21:08] man
[21:09] and god
[21:11] working together
[21:19] and we have
[21:21] six
[21:22] thousand
[21:24] years of history
[21:26] of man
[21:28] and god
[21:29] working together
[21:31] since the creation
[21:34] so we can see
[21:36] that the bible
[21:39] is
[21:41] a book
[21:43] full of christ
[21:44] from genesis
[21:46] to revelation
[21:49] and
[21:50] we can also say that the bible is a book
[21:53] full of men
[21:55] from genesis to revelation
[21:59] so god's
[22:01] great purpose
[22:02] from genesis to revelation
[22:06] is that man and god may come together
[22:10] and work together
[22:12] and
[22:13] we may be
[22:15] his expression
[22:18] representation
[22:20] on the earth
[22:21] from the time of creation
[22:23] god has always been going on
[22:28] he never stopped
[22:30] and he does not want us to be stopped
[22:34] or stagnated
[22:36] or make a line or draw a circle
[22:40] but he wants us to go
[22:42] move further
[22:44] all the time and god is going on
[22:47] going on
[22:49] going on from genesis to to revelation
[22:53] he has never stopped he is working on
[22:56] his goal to achieve it
[22:59] because god created man
[23:02] and the
[23:03] plan was god's plan
[23:06] was that
[23:07] man might be his complete expression but
[23:11] man
[23:12] failed
[23:13] he fell
[23:15] god
[23:16] god
[23:17] could do it in adam
[23:19] and eve
[23:21] but they fell
[23:23] and then god's purpose never defeated
[23:27] so it started
[23:30] with other people
[23:32] from genesis to revelation he is going
[23:36] on to achieve his
[23:38] purpose and
[23:40] want to fulfill his plan
[23:44] the bible says the brabranum said the
[23:46] entire bible is an expression of one
[23:50] goal that god had
[23:53] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[23:56] entire bible so whole bible
[24:01] is telling us about one goal
[24:05] one purpose
[24:06] and that goal and purpose
[24:09] is god's plan
[24:11] and the entire bible
[24:13] is an expression
[24:16] of that one goal
[24:19] one plan
[24:21] amen and that plan
[24:24] he has
[24:25] he has a plan
[24:28] and according to his plan
[24:30] he created everything
[24:33] and this plan
[24:35] he uh
[24:37] and with this plan he has an aim
[24:41] and a goal
[24:43] and that that plan
[24:45] was a mystery
[24:49] what he wanted to do
[24:52] why he has created everything
[24:55] why he created the universe
[24:57] why he created heavens and all
[25:00] they all declares him
[25:02] but why he did this it was a mystery
[25:06] it
[25:07] never been told to anyone
[25:13] it was in his mind
[25:17] he was all alone in the beginning
[25:20] with his plan with his thoughts
[25:24] and the bible says ephesians 3 9 to 11
[25:30] and to make all men see
[25:33] what
[25:34] is the fellowship of the mystery
[25:37] which from the beginning of the world
[25:40] hath been hid in god
[25:45] so that mystery
[25:47] was hid where it was hidden
[25:50] in him
[25:52] he did not
[25:54] tell to anyone
[25:55] it was hidden in himself he never
[25:58] disclosed
[25:59] he never tell to anyone
[26:01] he kept it secret in himself sometime
[26:06] you also don't tell something to anyone
[26:10] so it is kept secret in you
[26:13] so that's how god kept it secret
[26:16] and that secret was in god's mind he did
[26:20] not tell to anyone
[26:22] the bible says which from the beginning
[26:25] of the world hath been hidden god who
[26:29] created all things by jesus christ
[26:32] to the intent that now unto the
[26:36] principalities and powers in heavenly
[26:39] places might be known by the church
[26:43] the meaningful wisdom of god
[26:46] amen
[26:49] so
[26:50] the bible says according to the eternal
[26:52] purpose which he purposed in christ
[26:55] jesus our lord
[26:58] so god had a plan
[27:02] had a goal
[27:03] and that was hidden in him
[27:07] he kept it secret
[27:09] since the word began
[27:12] and ephesians 1 8 9 another scripture so
[27:15] i am going to read many scripture
[27:18] and i know that we all love to read the
[27:22] bible
[27:23] amen
[27:25] ephesians 1 8 9
[27:27] wherein
[27:28] he had abandoned toward us in all wisdom
[27:33] and prudence
[27:34] having made known unto us the mystery of
[27:39] his will
[27:40] according to his good pleasure which he
[27:43] hath purposed in himself
[27:50] so we have read two
[27:52] verses
[27:53] here
[27:54] ephesians
[27:57] 3 9 11
[27:59] and ephesians 1 8 9.
[28:02] so the verses of
[28:06] we have read here
[28:08] shows us
[28:09] that god has an eternal plan
[28:12] according to ephesians 3 11
[28:17] and according to ephesians 1 9
[28:19] that plan
[28:21] is the mystery of his will
[28:25] that's what i'm going to preach this
[28:28] morning that's what we are talking about
[28:31] he says having made known unto us the
[28:35] mystery of his will
[28:37] according to his good pleasure which he
[28:40] had purposed in himself
[28:44] so he had a plan
[28:47] he had mystery
[28:49] and that mystery purpose
[28:51] locked in himself never told to anyone
[28:55] what he wanted to achieve what is his
[28:57] will
[28:58] and
[28:59] this plan is the mystery of his will
[29:03] it is something unknown to man
[29:06] and now
[29:07] i'm quoting
[29:09] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[29:13] there was a mystery
[29:14] that was in the back part of god's mind
[29:17] mind
[29:18] never been to told anyone it was hidden
[29:21] in god
[29:24] and
[29:25] said
[29:26] and now in this last day
[29:29] he has revealed it and shows it
[29:33] and by the grace of god we will see it
[29:36] this morning in the light of the message
[29:38] of da'awah amen
[29:41] so what is the mystery of god
[29:46] he had mystery
[29:48] and it was hidden in him
[29:51] god's mystery was kept in silence
[29:55] in the times of the ages
[29:58] romans chapter 16 25
[30:02] now to him
[30:04] that is of power
[30:06] to establish you according to my gospel
[30:10] and the preaching of jesus christ
[30:12] according to the revelation of the
[30:15] mystery
[30:16] which was kept secret
[30:18] since the world began
[30:22] so according to the scriptures
[30:25] god
[30:28] has a plan
[30:31] and he wanted to achieve something
[30:34] and that
[30:35] was kept secret
[30:38] it was
[30:41] in silence
[30:43] never been
[30:45] told to anyone
[30:48] so this mystery was hidden in god's
[30:51] heart
[30:52] and was nor to reveal to anyone
[30:57] since the world began the bible says
[31:01] so in the past generation
[31:03] god did not tell people
[31:06] or
[31:07] did not tell anyone
[31:09] the reason why he created all things
[31:13] and the bible says
[31:16] he created all things by jesus christ
[31:20] amen
[31:21] it is ephesians 3 5
[31:23] but why
[31:25] god created everything by jesus christ
[31:28] ephesians 3 5
[31:30] but why he created everything
[31:33] he did not tell to anyone
[31:36] he did not open it
[31:39] and
[31:40] ephesians 3 5 says
[31:42] which in other ages
[31:45] was not made known unto the sons of men
[31:50] so everything
[31:52] was in his great mind
[31:55] in his thoughts
[31:56] as an attribute
[32:00] and he
[32:03] kept it secret
[32:06] and
[32:07] he appointed
[32:08] a time for it
[32:10] and where according to his appointed
[32:13] time he started to give out this mystery
[32:18] little by little
[32:20] because if you open everything at once
[32:23] our human mind cannot
[32:25] grasp it we cannot take it
[32:29] because
[32:30] god
[32:32] is a great god infinite god
[32:36] eternal
[32:37] and we cannot understand
[32:40] even
[32:42] when we read
[32:44] the message and
[32:46] is talking about
[32:50] behind the curtain of time when it went
[32:52] beyond there
[32:54] so
[32:56] they are
[32:57] telling prabranam many things
[33:00] and he did not know about those things
[33:02] he is still learning there
[33:05] so
[33:06] even when we get there
[33:13] we will learn
[33:16] amen
[33:17] so god started to give out his mystery
[33:21] little by little little by little amen
[33:25] so then paul says roman 16 26
[33:30] but now is made manifest
[33:33] and by the scriptures of the prophets
[33:36] according to the commandment of the
[33:38] everlasting god
[33:40] made known to all nations
[33:43] for the obedience of faith
[33:46] amen
[33:47] so when god
[33:49] started to reveal this mystery
[33:52] little by little
[33:55] then
[33:56] it was
[33:58] made known
[34:00] it was preached
[34:03] the man who caught the mystery but
[34:06] branham said what is the plan
[34:10] when god opened the mystery the seal
[34:13] there is a man
[34:15] messenger the angel of the aid
[34:18] so he caught the mystery
[34:21] and when he caught the mystery
[34:23] then he
[34:26] after
[34:27] he got the revelation
[34:29] he started to proclaim that message to
[34:32] the people
[34:34] so then people knew
[34:37] what god is doing
[34:41] amen that's all god's plan
[34:44] is unfolded
[34:46] in all throughout all the ages little by
[34:49] little
[34:50] so when it was made known it was
[34:52] preached
[34:54] the bible says preach unto the gentiles
[34:57] believed on in the world
[35:01] so god
[35:02] started to give out his mystery little
[35:04] by little
[35:06] he started to give out the mystery to
[35:09] his prophet to his seer
[35:11] to his saints
[35:13] all
[35:14] the people in the old testament
[35:18] and throughout the egypt
[35:22] and god revealed this mystery to paul
[35:28] messenger to the first churches
[35:33] and when god revealed this mystery
[35:36] to paul
[35:37] he was
[35:39] going on the road to damascus
[35:42] and that's where he met the pillar of
[35:46] fire
[35:48] and after that
[35:50] great experience
[35:52] he went to arabia
[35:56] in the
[35:57] desert
[35:59] and one day he was caught up in heaven
[36:04] and they did not tell
[36:06] to anyone after 14 years
[36:10] of
[36:11] his experience he wrote in the bible
[36:14] that i know one man was caught up in
[36:17] third heaven so when he
[36:20] was caught up in heaven
[36:23] god revealed this mystery to him
[36:27] amen
[36:30] ephesians 3 3
[36:32] 2 5
[36:34] how that
[36:36] by revelation
[36:38] he made known unto me the mystery
[36:42] so now the paul is talking as i wrote
[36:46] a four in few words
[36:49] whereby
[36:50] when he read
[36:52] he may understand
[36:54] my knowledge in the mystery of christ
[36:57] which in other ages was not made known
[37:01] unto the sons of man
[37:03] as it is now revealed
[37:06] unto his
[37:07] holy apostles and prophets by the spirit
[37:11] and then ephesians 3 9 and to make all
[37:14] men see
[37:16] what is the fellowship of the mystery
[37:18] which from the beginning of the world
[37:21] hath been healed in god who created all
[37:25] things by jesus christ
[37:27] so here we see
[37:31] there was the mystery
[37:34] and god had a plan
[37:36] and that was hidden in god
[37:39] but then god started to give all this
[37:41] mystery
[37:42] and paul
[37:44] received the revelation of that mystery
[37:48] amen
[37:51] and that mystery was hid in god
[37:53] and when
[37:56] god started to reveal this mystery
[38:02] then coalition of colossians
[38:06] colossians 2 2 says
[38:08] that
[38:10] that mystery
[38:12] of god
[38:14] is christ
[38:17] so god's mystery is christ
[38:23] that was his
[38:24] that was hidden
[38:26] in god
[38:30] amen from the
[38:34] work
[38:34] again
[38:36] from the very beginning
[38:39] god
[38:43] kept something secret
[38:47] and
[38:50] he did not tell to anyone
[38:52] and then when it started to reveal to
[38:56] the people
[38:57] it
[38:58] revealed that christ is the mystery
[39:03] collision two two
[39:06] what is christ is the mystery
[39:08] that one god wanted to become a man
[39:12] that was the mystery that was never been
[39:15] to told anyone
[39:17] to two colossians
[39:19] that their hearts
[39:21] might be comforted
[39:23] being knit together in love
[39:26] that unto all reaches of the full
[39:28] assurance of understanding to the
[39:31] acknowledgement of the mystery of god
[39:34] and of the father and of christ
[39:38] so hence the mystery of god is christ
[39:42] and christ is the mystery of god
[39:46] revealed
[39:48] so the mystery
[39:50] that was hid in god
[39:53] was christ
[39:56] jesus
[39:58] and that mystery was that god will
[40:01] become
[40:02] a man one day
[40:04] he will come into flesh
[40:07] that was never told to anyone
[40:12] nobody
[40:13] knew about it
[40:15] but when it revealed paul caught that
[40:18] mystery
[40:20] and he
[40:22] started to give or to the church
[40:25] because
[40:27] that is the plan of redemption
[40:29] there is someone
[40:32] to receive or catch that mystery
[40:35] and when he catch the mystery seal is
[40:38] open the mystery is unfolded and the
[40:41] angel of the eighth is there to catch
[40:43] the mystery then he proclaimed
[40:46] then he started his message
[40:48] then it is given to the church to the
[40:52] people amen galatians 2 9
[40:58] 4 in him
[41:00] dwelt
[41:01] all the fullness of the godhead burden
[41:07] and i want to put here
[41:12] in
[41:12] in the words of the prophet
[41:15] am i'm going to quote and know earth it
[41:18] not
[41:20] bubranam said
[41:22] whether it is god the father
[41:25] god the holy ghost
[41:28] whether it is the angels
[41:31] principalities
[41:32] powers dominions
[41:35] whatever it is
[41:37] all things run by him
[41:40] all things consist by him
[41:45] he is
[41:47] all the fullness of all things
[41:50] all the fullness of earth
[41:53] all the fullness of heaven
[41:55] all the fullness of god
[41:57] all the fullness of angels all the
[42:00] fullness of time all the fullness of
[42:03] eternity
[42:04] everything dwelt
[42:06] in him
[42:09] amen
[42:11] that's what bubranam said so everything
[42:14] dwelt in him
[42:17] in christ jesus
[42:19] angels
[42:21] god
[42:22] father
[42:23] holy spirit earth
[42:26] heaven eternity time
[42:29] us
[42:30] amen
[42:32] everything
[42:34] so god's eternal will
[42:37] is
[42:39] that
[42:40] all things in heaven
[42:42] and on earth
[42:44] be headed up in christ
[42:49] that's his eternal will
[42:52] that's his eternal power
[42:54] purpose
[42:56] that is what he wanted to achieve in us
[43:01] amen
[43:03] ephesians 1 10
[43:05] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[43:08] of times
[43:09] he might gather together in one
[43:13] all things in christ
[43:16] both which are in heaven and which are
[43:19] on earth even in him
[43:22] in other words christ is to be the head
[43:26] over all things
[43:30] amen
[43:32] when this happens
[43:35] when christ becomes the head
[43:38] over all things
[43:40] then
[43:41] in everything everything in the universe
[43:45] will express the lord
[43:47] that is god's eternal will
[43:51] god's will
[43:52] is for christ
[43:54] to be the centrality of all things
[43:58] and for all things to be subject to
[44:01] christ
[44:02] so that he may
[44:04] be had over all things
[44:09] colossians 3
[44:11] 11 says
[44:12] christ is all
[44:15] and in all
[44:19] he
[44:20] is the principal theme of the entire
[44:23] bible
[44:25] bubranam said
[44:27] if he is the
[44:29] principal theme of the bible he should
[44:32] be the principal theme of our talking
[44:37] of our singing
[44:39] and we know that
[44:41] we are here for his service and he is
[44:44] the principal theme of our gathering
[44:47] here
[44:48] he should be
[44:49] because he is all
[44:52] and in all
[44:54] he is everything
[44:56] he is the principal thief he
[44:59] is
[45:02] the head
[45:04] over everything
[45:06] amen colossians 1 18 that he himself
[45:12] might have the first place in all things
[45:17] that is god's eternal
[45:19] will and purpose
[45:21] that's christ
[45:24] may take the preeminence in us
[45:27] first place
[45:29] in all things
[45:31] galatians 1
[45:32] 18.
[45:34] so i'm reading lot of scriptures
[45:38] yeah and he is the head of the body
[45:42] the church
[45:44] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[45:47] the dead
[45:48] that in all things
[45:50] he might have the preeminence
[45:54] amen
[45:55] he might have the preeminence
[46:00] and
[46:02] concerning this mystery
[46:04] ephesians 3 6 says
[46:07] that christ jesus
[46:13] that in christ jesus
[46:15] the gentiles are we are the gentiles
[46:19] he is the mystery
[46:22] he is the plan of god
[46:26] and he is everything
[46:29] he is all in all
[46:31] and in him
[46:34] we
[46:35] the gentiles
[46:36] becomes fellow heirs and
[46:39] fellow members of the body
[46:42] and fellow partakers of the promise
[46:45] through the gospel
[46:47] so we becomes the part
[46:50] of that mystery
[46:52] god is amen always working towards this
[46:57] goal
[47:00] and we as we are in christ
[47:03] we becomes a part
[47:06] of christ
[47:08] and we become the little christ
[47:11] amen
[47:12] because we are in him we are his part
[47:17] and he is our part and we are his part
[47:20] ephesians 1 10 that in the dispensation
[47:23] of the fullness of times he might gather
[47:26] together in one
[47:28] all things in christ
[47:31] both which are in heaven and which are
[47:34] on earth even in him
[47:38] amen
[47:40] when the fullness of time
[47:42] when the fullness of jesus
[47:44] comes
[47:47] he will head up all things in christ
[47:49] jesus
[47:51] the things in the heavens
[47:53] and the things
[47:55] on the earth
[47:56] this means that all things will be
[47:59] gathered together
[48:01] in one
[48:02] place
[48:03] and will be crowned with the name of
[48:06] christ
[48:08] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[48:12] earth is named
[48:15] amen
[48:18] what is the mystery
[48:21] that christ
[48:22] may become our head
[48:26] and
[48:27] he may be
[48:28] all in all
[48:31] that everything must come under his
[48:35] subjection
[48:36] when
[48:38] when god
[48:41] becomes man
[48:44] and he comes in the flesh
[48:47] in the form of jesus christ
[48:50] and once he becomes jesus
[48:53] christ
[48:54] a man
[48:56] god
[48:57] in the flesh
[48:58] then what he is going to do
[49:01] he will gather everything in that person
[49:05] which is in heaven
[49:07] which is on earth
[49:09] everything will be gathered
[49:12] in that person
[49:14] because that person is god
[49:16] we have just read brahmana says that he
[49:19] is the father
[49:22] the father is in him the holy ghost is
[49:25] in him amen he is
[49:28] the fullness of everything and when god
[49:32] becomes man
[49:34] jesus christ then everything
[49:38] will be
[49:40] gathered in him
[49:42] then he will become the head of
[49:44] everything
[49:46] everything will come
[49:48] under his subjection
[49:51] when he comes in the body of jesus
[49:54] christ
[49:55] and that's why the bible says in the
[49:58] name of jesus every knee should bow
[50:02] of those who are in heaven and on earth
[50:06] and under the earth
[50:09] philippians 2 10
[50:11] amen
[50:14] so god's great plan
[50:17] is that everything he will gather up in
[50:21] one
[50:23] in the lord jesus christ
[50:26] that is his great goal
[50:28] great purpose
[50:30] that his
[50:31] great
[50:33] eternal
[50:34] will
[50:35] that's what he want to achieve
[50:40] and that's what
[50:42] he is doing
[50:44] in order to reach this goal he has to go
[50:48] on and on
[50:52] with
[50:53] every step of the lords going on there
[50:56] is always something new
[51:02] but ranam said
[51:04] that gold
[51:06] is expressed
[51:11] in the lives of the believers
[51:17] amen
[51:18] throughout the bible from genesis
[51:21] to revelation
[51:22] everywhere
[51:24] so with people like adam
[51:28] noah
[51:29] abel abraham moses david there was
[51:34] always a new step of the lord's going on
[51:37] because god never stopped
[51:40] from genesis to this day
[51:43] he is working
[51:46] amen
[51:47] jesus said my father is working
[51:50] so his
[51:51] own work he's at work he's working amen
[51:55] so god
[51:57] when god is working
[51:59] he's working in men
[52:02] he needs us
[52:05] god needs people
[52:07] to work
[52:10] god needs our operation
[52:13] that's why god wants to gain us
[52:17] and when he gain us a group of people
[52:20] totally submitted to him then god can
[52:23] choose that person
[52:25] so god
[52:28] worked in christ
[52:30] god what in the apostles
[52:33] god worked in abraham noah
[52:36] eliza
[52:37] moses all the prophets but brahm said in
[52:41] all the believers
[52:46] in their characters
[52:48] he was showing
[52:50] his great purpose his great goal
[52:53] he wanted to achieve
[52:55] amen so god worked
[52:58] himself
[53:00] in different
[53:01] different scenes
[53:03] and in the saints throughout the ages
[53:06] and he is working in us also
[53:10] amen
[53:12] the goal and direction
[53:14] of god's work are absolutely the same
[53:18] it never changed
[53:21] he's god who never changed
[53:26] but
[53:28] the odd word
[53:30] manifestation
[53:32] the outward form of god's word
[53:35] completely different in every age
[53:39] however
[53:41] the principle
[53:43] way
[53:44] content
[53:45] and purpose of god's word
[53:48] are absolutely one and the same
[53:54] message tells us that there is only one
[53:57] work god desires to do through all the
[54:00] israel only one word one goal one
[54:03] purpose
[54:05] the unique work that god has been doing
[54:08] throughout the death is to work himself
[54:12] into us
[54:13] into man
[54:16] when god works himself
[54:19] amen
[54:22] into us
[54:24] what we manifest
[54:27] what we express is different from
[54:30] individual to individual
[54:33] when god worked himself into luther what
[54:37] was manifested through him was
[54:39] justification
[54:43] and when god worked himself
[54:46] into
[54:47] wesley
[54:48] what was the manifestation
[54:51] sanctification
[54:54] and when god
[54:55] worked himself into pentecostal
[54:58] what was manifested through them
[55:01] that was a different manifestation
[55:06] they spoke in tongues
[55:10] amen
[55:12] but
[55:13] everything is doing
[55:15] is
[55:16] a furtherance of
[55:18] the same thing
[55:20] here's the next move next step
[55:24] but every time the expression the
[55:26] manifestation
[55:28] is different in every person or in every
[55:33] eighth
[55:35] amen
[55:38] so god's work in each person is
[55:41] manifested in a different way
[55:44] the same god is working but he is
[55:47] manifested in
[55:49] different ways through different people
[55:53] because god is god of varieties
[55:57] thus we cannot imitate spiritual things
[56:00] but can only follow the inner principle
[56:05] when there is a life
[56:07] life cannot be manufactured
[56:14] life like
[56:17] my children
[56:19] they are the extension of my life
[56:25] so the same life
[56:29] but now in another form
[56:33] and when
[56:34] there
[56:35] is a life
[56:37] it cannot be imitated
[56:41] like if you want to make statue or
[56:43] amazes
[56:46] you can make maybe hundreds of hundreds
[56:48] they can be same and looks alike
[56:52] but when it comes to the life
[56:54] it cannot be the
[56:56] same your children
[56:59] are
[57:01] you are like the extension of the same
[57:04] life
[57:04] but even if you will
[57:07] they cannot be like
[57:10] you they will manifest the same life in
[57:15] different way
[57:17] so god is life jesus christ is life
[57:21] that life
[57:22] is working in us and into us every time
[57:27] god comes in us
[57:29] and he manifests himself
[57:32] express
[57:33] himself in a different way
[57:36] that's why
[57:38] the spiritual things cannot be
[57:42] emitted we cannot
[57:44] imitate or
[57:48] there is always different
[57:50] like
[57:51] what god is doing here is different
[57:57] and what god is doing in india is
[58:00] different
[58:03] same goal same purpose
[58:08] everything but the manifestation is
[58:10] different it is according to
[58:13] the need of the people
[58:16] amen
[58:17] that's why you have to come to the
[58:19] church
[58:21] because you are playing a part
[58:27] and now you preach one sermon
[58:30] maybe 10 times
[58:32] you cannot preach the same
[58:35] sermon
[58:37] though you have notes everything but if
[58:39] you preach here
[58:41] it will be different
[58:43] according to the people
[58:46] and when you preach the same sermon
[58:48] different place
[58:50] it will be different according to the
[58:53] people because people play the part
[58:56] that's why we need to come to the church
[58:59] and when you place your part you get
[59:02] what you expect and god
[59:05] meet your needs according to
[59:08] your need
[59:10] amen so life cannot be imitated life
[59:14] cannot be imitated life cannot be
[59:17] manufactured
[59:18] so god
[59:20] when he started to manifest himself in
[59:23] truth
[59:25] luther it was different manifestation
[59:28] but the same god same purpose same goal
[59:31] but university was different and when
[59:34] brother branham came
[59:37] it was a great healing revival
[59:40] and mysteries was open
[59:42] everything it was same god same purpose
[59:45] same god
[59:46] goal but different manifestation amen
[59:51] so now let's
[59:52] talk little bit about paul because paul
[59:56] the first messenger
[59:58] is saying that god
[1:00:00] chosen me
[1:00:02] separated me from the
[1:00:05] womb
[1:00:06] of my mother
[1:00:08] why to reveal his son
[1:00:12] in
[1:00:13] me
[1:00:16] that's why
[1:00:17] we have been called
[1:00:20] god has not separated us from our job
[1:00:25] or
[1:00:27] our school or our college but god has
[1:00:30] separated us
[1:00:33] from the foundation of the word
[1:00:35] we are chosen in him
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:39] and
[1:00:40] then he called us so he says when it
[1:00:43] pleased god who set me apart from my
[1:00:46] mother's womb and called me through his
[1:00:49] grace to reveal his son
[1:00:52] in me
[1:00:55] amen
[1:00:57] paul was a great
[1:01:00] religious person
[1:01:02] he followed
[1:01:05] jewish
[1:01:06] religion
[1:01:09] a religion which was established
[1:01:13] ordained
[1:01:15] and given by god
[1:01:19] god came down
[1:01:21] and give the commandments and
[1:01:24] instruction
[1:01:26] that was the only true
[1:01:29] religion
[1:01:31] on the earth
[1:01:33] and paul was following that religion
[1:01:37] and he was so jealous
[1:01:40] that he do not want to see anyone beside
[1:01:43] what he believed
[1:01:45] so he was killing christians
[1:01:49] persecuting them
[1:01:52] and one day
[1:01:53] he met pillar of fire
[1:01:56] and when that pillar of fire struck him
[1:02:00] he fell down
[1:02:02] and because
[1:02:04] he saw something
[1:02:08] in heaven
[1:02:10] and he heard
[1:02:12] a voice
[1:02:13] which saying saul saul why you
[1:02:17] persecuting me why did you persecute me
[1:02:22] because the source of the voice was in
[1:02:24] heaven so he asked
[1:02:27] lord who are you
[1:02:31] and the lord said i am jesus
[1:02:35] and in paul's intention
[1:02:38] and in paul's thinking
[1:02:41] he was
[1:02:43] persecuting someone who
[1:02:46] was on earth
[1:02:51] and he never
[1:02:53] though he though he heard that
[1:02:56] i am jesus to whom you are persecuting
[1:02:58] but still there is a question
[1:03:01] how he can persuade someone who is in
[1:03:04] heaven
[1:03:09] and
[1:03:10] the first
[1:03:13] time
[1:03:14] god
[1:03:15] intervened
[1:03:17] paul
[1:03:20] god revealed to him
[1:03:22] that i
[1:03:23] and my people are one
[1:03:26] i am one with the believers
[1:03:28] believers and i
[1:03:31] are one
[1:03:34] amen
[1:03:35] that's
[1:03:36] what
[1:03:38] be revealed
[1:03:40] to paul
[1:03:42] he caught the visa
[1:03:44] he received
[1:03:46] something
[1:03:47] amen and jesus is saying
[1:03:50] that if you persuade the believer you
[1:03:52] persecute me
[1:03:55] and
[1:03:57] the poor paul who was a great religious
[1:04:00] person who was filled
[1:04:03] filled with all the doctrines
[1:04:06] all the
[1:04:08] righteousness whatever because he said
[1:04:10] am percy is so pharisees
[1:04:14] he was a sincere person
[1:04:17] he was following
[1:04:20] something which was ordained by god
[1:04:25] but still that was not god's eternal
[1:04:28] purpose
[1:04:30] so god intervened
[1:04:32] many times
[1:04:34] sometimes we
[1:04:35] are gathered around some doctrine
[1:04:39] and we preach those things
[1:04:41] and we love to talk
[1:04:43] all those things which are good
[1:04:46] nothing should say against them
[1:04:50] but christ is not a doctrine
[1:04:54] trash is a
[1:04:55] tricep life
[1:04:58] what is this message
[1:05:01] which is given to us
[1:05:03] he said christ is revealed in his own
[1:05:06] word
[1:05:07] what are those seals
[1:05:09] what is open christ
[1:05:12] revealed himself
[1:05:16] so this message we have received
[1:05:19] is not a bunch of doctrine this is not
[1:05:23] israel that's why when he's preaching on
[1:05:25] the seventh seal said don't make any ism
[1:05:29] leave it as it is
[1:05:32] because the seventh healing jesus christ
[1:05:34] himself
[1:05:36] coming down
[1:05:37] in us
[1:05:38] that he may many self himself into us in
[1:05:42] his own
[1:05:44] way
[1:05:46] he's the life
[1:05:48] but what we did
[1:05:52] we took something
[1:05:54] and
[1:05:56] separated ourselves
[1:05:59] and this is this this is this those all
[1:06:02] things are the truth
[1:06:04] all is truth
[1:06:06] because truth being given to us through
[1:06:09] the message
[1:06:10] and but somebody took little part of the
[1:06:13] truth and he separated from brethren and
[1:06:17] somebody took little part of the truth
[1:06:19] but this whole message
[1:06:22] amen
[1:06:24] we have to read the whole book
[1:06:26] this whole message is good this whole
[1:06:29] message is the revelation of jesus
[1:06:31] christ
[1:06:33] so when we
[1:06:36] preach something or draw a line
[1:06:39] then we are stuck
[1:06:42] we are stagnated
[1:06:45] and then god
[1:06:47] comes
[1:06:48] and intervene
[1:06:50] that's what happened
[1:06:51] in in the life of paul
[1:06:54] he was so religious
[1:06:58] he was sincere
[1:07:02] and he was doing following something
[1:07:04] which was given by god himself
[1:07:09] but that was a great hindrance for him
[1:07:13] sometimes
[1:07:14] good things
[1:07:16] becomes hindrance
[1:07:19] things which are related to god
[1:07:22] things
[1:07:23] related to christ
[1:07:26] becomes hindrance
[1:07:28] when we
[1:07:32] stuck or when we stop
[1:07:36] never
[1:07:37] we should not stop never
[1:07:40] god is going
[1:07:42] all the time
[1:07:43] so we must go with him
[1:07:46] truth is always marching on
[1:07:50] amen
[1:07:51] so when god met paul
[1:07:54] god revealed that i am one
[1:07:57] with my people
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:00] and
[1:08:06] the great hindrance was
[1:08:08] something which was given by god
[1:08:13] because they took it as doctrine
[1:08:16] they took it as a religion
[1:08:20] this message is not
[1:08:23] given us to make a religion or doctrine
[1:08:27] or ism
[1:08:28] the message is given to live life
[1:08:30] because this message is life
[1:08:34] life has been restored
[1:08:37] in the church
[1:08:38] that we may express
[1:08:41] him
[1:08:43] that's paul says that he chosen me
[1:08:47] to reveal his son
[1:08:50] enemy
[1:08:53] amen so god's revealing of his son to us
[1:08:57] is in us
[1:08:59] and
[1:09:01] not outwardly
[1:09:04] but inwardly
[1:09:06] christ's will in us is the center of
[1:09:09] god's plan
[1:09:11] god's plan is to reveal christ into you
[1:09:14] to make christ your life
[1:09:17] and your everything
[1:09:21] at one time saul was fully occupied and
[1:09:25] jealous
[1:09:26] for the jewish religion
[1:09:28] the jewish religion we are talking that
[1:09:31] which was
[1:09:33] the best religion
[1:09:35] but that was not
[1:09:37] god himself
[1:09:41] god's eternal plan is that god
[1:09:46] work
[1:09:46] himself into us
[1:09:49] amen philippians 3 7 8 and paul says
[1:09:54] but what things were given to me
[1:09:57] those icons
[1:09:59] counted laws for christ
[1:10:02] those things were good
[1:10:05] you are doubtless and i count all things
[1:10:08] but laws for the excellency of the
[1:10:10] knowledge of christ jesus my lord for
[1:10:13] whom i have suffered the loss of all
[1:10:16] things and do count them but done
[1:10:19] that i may be in christ
[1:10:24] so he says i count all those things
[1:10:28] but done
[1:10:31] means rubbish
[1:10:34] that i may win christ
[1:10:45] paul
[1:10:47] said i count all those things
[1:10:51] done
[1:10:52] what things
[1:10:55] good things
[1:10:57] religious things
[1:11:01] he was so sincere
[1:11:04] following what was given by god
[1:11:09] and he said to gain christ
[1:11:14] i
[1:11:15] left
[1:11:17] all those good things
[1:11:20] i caught them but dunk those good things
[1:11:26] so we have to see god's plan
[1:11:30] that he does not want us to make
[1:11:33] religion
[1:11:35] only
[1:11:37] his plan
[1:11:39] is for us
[1:11:42] not to make us formal
[1:11:45] or
[1:11:46] any kind of religious person but we want
[1:11:50] us to make christians
[1:11:52] and branham said christians means christ
[1:11:56] life
[1:11:57] a christian is a christ man a man filled
[1:12:01] with christ
[1:12:03] a man mingled with christ
[1:12:05] a man lost in christ
[1:12:08] amen
[1:12:10] so that's god's plan
[1:12:12] is to reveal his son
[1:12:14] in us so that we can be conformed to the
[1:12:18] image of his son
[1:12:20] god's intention and god's plan is not
[1:12:24] just for us to be religious
[1:12:26] good spiritual or knowledgeable uh
[1:12:29] of the scripture
[1:12:31] but god's plan is for us to be filled
[1:12:34] with christ
[1:12:35] to be
[1:12:36] occupied
[1:12:38] projected
[1:12:41] saturated
[1:12:42] permeated
[1:12:44] blended and mingled with christ
[1:12:48] that we may be the full expression of
[1:12:51] him
[1:12:55] this is
[1:12:57] is an is of personal life
[1:13:00] this is
[1:13:01] the is to display the token
[1:13:05] token is christ life
[1:13:08] has come back in the church
[1:13:11] and that life must be on display
[1:13:14] because that's god's will
[1:13:17] that's what
[1:13:18] god
[1:13:19] wants to
[1:13:20] do in us
[1:13:23] today is not the age of formalities
[1:13:27] today is not
[1:13:29] the age of religion today is the age of
[1:13:32] the living christ and the living members
[1:13:36] know the christ in teaching and
[1:13:37] doctrines by the christ in life the
[1:13:41] christ as a life-giving spirit
[1:13:45] that we may become the flow of that life
[1:13:50] we are not merely fellowshipping
[1:13:53] concerning
[1:13:54] uh salvation or spirituality but we are
[1:13:57] dealing with god's eternal purpose
[1:14:01] we need to realize that this is our
[1:14:04] golden time to be used by god
[1:14:07] the lord needs you
[1:14:09] as a channel through which he can carry
[1:14:12] out his move that he may express himself
[1:14:17] that we may be the full manifestation
[1:14:21] of his life
[1:14:23] that's god's purpose
[1:14:28] we
[1:14:29] need to realize
[1:14:31] that we are here
[1:14:34] for nothing
[1:14:36] not for any doctrine
[1:14:39] not for any ism
[1:14:42] but we are here hundred percent for
[1:14:45] christ jesus on
[1:14:49] and when
[1:14:52] that christ jesus in i
[1:14:55] is in us
[1:14:56] amen
[1:14:58] then we can express him
[1:15:01] that this message
[1:15:03] has come to us
[1:15:05] to recover
[1:15:07] restore christ himself to be
[1:15:10] realized by us
[1:15:12] as everything
[1:15:16] christ himself is our knowledge our
[1:15:18] teaching our doctrine our revelation our
[1:15:22] regulation our form of a gifts of our
[1:15:24] power everything
[1:15:26] is christ
[1:15:29] and that's why prabhanam said when the
[1:15:32] word is opened those seals are opened he
[1:15:34] said those seeds are christ himself
[1:15:39] amen
[1:15:40] if you have christ you have everything
[1:15:45] because the christian's life is not a
[1:15:48] matter of religion
[1:15:51] of teaching of
[1:15:53] forms of
[1:15:55] regulation
[1:15:56] or of gifts but a matter of christ
[1:15:59] himself
[1:16:00] christ in us
[1:16:02] hope of glory
[1:16:04] but branham said if you do everything
[1:16:08] you do everything
[1:16:12] and missed that life
[1:16:14] you missed everything
[1:16:17] you do everything like paul you follow
[1:16:19] the doctrine you preach the
[1:16:22] listen you
[1:16:23] pay ties and you
[1:16:25] are involved in all the activities
[1:16:28] church activities
[1:16:30] preaching whatever
[1:16:34] if you
[1:16:35] missed that life
[1:16:37] you missed everything
[1:16:41] so that life
[1:16:43] should be in us
[1:16:45] that's why the polls paul says but what
[1:16:48] things were gained to me those i counted
[1:16:50] laws for christ
[1:16:55] and i caught them but dang
[1:16:58] because
[1:16:59] paul was brought
[1:17:01] to the realization that the only gain in
[1:17:04] the universe was christ himself
[1:17:07] whatever we do on earth our job
[1:17:11] our authorities our success
[1:17:14] whatever we do
[1:17:16] nothing is counter
[1:17:18] but whatever we do
[1:17:21] for christ
[1:17:23] remains forever and ever
[1:17:26] even
[1:17:27] a cup of water
[1:17:30] amen
[1:17:31] so we see that
[1:17:33] uh
[1:17:36] all the things he countered as laws were
[1:17:38] good things but
[1:17:40] those things were not christ himself
[1:17:43] that's why
[1:17:44] we should always keep ourselves in
[1:17:47] direct contact with christ
[1:17:51] then we will be one with christ in
[1:17:53] reality
[1:17:55] and when
[1:17:56] we are one with christ
[1:17:58] in reality
[1:17:59] and then
[1:18:01] when we will meet the people
[1:18:03] we will not give them any doctrine
[1:18:06] any forms any regulation but we will
[1:18:10] give them christ
[1:18:14] that's why brahmana said
[1:18:16] i am afraid today that too many of us
[1:18:20] are not getting people to christ
[1:18:23] we are getting them to a church to a
[1:18:25] theory
[1:18:26] but we must get them to christ he is the
[1:18:30] only one and the only one that has life
[1:18:34] he that has the son has life
[1:18:37] amen so when you have that life
[1:18:41] christ is
[1:18:43] our life
[1:18:44] and
[1:18:45] when we have that life the token in us
[1:18:48] and when we will meet the people
[1:18:52] then we will impart christ to them
[1:18:58] we will give
[1:18:59] life to them
[1:19:01] we will not give any doctrine
[1:19:04] any religion
[1:19:07] we will impart eternal life to the
[1:19:10] people
[1:19:11] because as a believer
[1:19:13] as a minister our our job is to
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:19] bring
[1:19:20] people close to god
[1:19:24] as a minister
[1:19:27] our job because the people think that we
[1:19:30] are close to god
[1:19:33] and our job is to bring god closer to
[1:19:37] the people
[1:19:38] and then peop bring people close to god
[1:19:42] that they may
[1:19:44] be united together
[1:19:46] that's our job we are not here to
[1:19:49] represent ourselves
[1:19:51] we are not here to represent any church
[1:19:53] we are not here to represent any
[1:19:56] doctrine anything but we are here to
[1:20:00] represent christ jesus
[1:20:03] that was his purpose to bring adam
[1:20:08] amen
[1:20:09] that's
[1:20:12] the greatest thing
[1:20:16] could ever happen was to impart eternal
[1:20:19] life to people
[1:20:23] what is eternal life
[1:20:25] the life that he lived
[1:20:27] the life that was in him
[1:20:30] impart that to others
[1:20:33] can a man do that
[1:20:36] he said the son of god
[1:20:40] so when we mingle with him
[1:20:43] when we are one with him when we are
[1:20:46] united with the word
[1:20:49] when he is in him
[1:20:51] we are in him and he is in us
[1:20:54] we become the living manifestation of
[1:20:57] the written word
[1:21:00] and when we become the manifestation of
[1:21:03] the word
[1:21:04] as we receive the word of the earth
[1:21:07] then we become the manifestation
[1:21:10] we bring out that life
[1:21:12] we become the channel the source the
[1:21:15] flow
[1:21:16] of that life and then that life is
[1:21:19] imparted
[1:21:21] to the people
[1:21:24] that's what god wants
[1:21:26] philippians 1 20 and 21
[1:21:30] according to my earnest expectation
[1:21:34] and who
[1:21:35] that in nothing
[1:21:37] i will
[1:21:38] be
[1:21:40] put to shame but with all boldness as
[1:21:44] always even now christ will be magnified
[1:21:48] in my body whether
[1:21:50] through life or through death
[1:21:52] for
[1:21:53] to me to leave his christ
[1:21:57] that's what paul says
[1:21:59] paul said that for him to leave was
[1:22:01] christ
[1:22:04] this means that we need to leave christ
[1:22:09] paul's life was to leave christ
[1:22:12] he lived christ
[1:22:15] because christ was in him
[1:22:21] and we cannot leave christ
[1:22:24] if he is
[1:22:26] not in us
[1:22:30] galatians galatians 2 20 i am crucified
[1:22:33] with christ
[1:22:35] nevertheless i live
[1:22:37] that not i
[1:22:38] but christ lived in me
[1:22:41] and the life which i now live in the
[1:22:44] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[1:22:46] god who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:22:51] so we are living christ
[1:22:53] and this living of christ is for us to
[1:22:57] magnify him to make him larger
[1:23:00] in others eyes
[1:23:03] the christian life is a life that leaves
[1:23:05] christ
[1:23:08] i
[1:23:10] want to quote one quote
[1:23:13] says and if the life of christ is in the
[1:23:16] church
[1:23:18] of christ then it is god to have the
[1:23:20] character of christ it will produce the
[1:23:23] life of christ
[1:23:25] if the life of the spirit of christ is
[1:23:28] in the church
[1:23:29] it has
[1:23:31] to produce that life because the life
[1:23:34] that is in you
[1:23:36] makes your character
[1:23:39] it means
[1:23:41] the people should see christ in us
[1:23:45] we christians
[1:23:47] should live a life that leaves christ
[1:23:49] and magnifies him
[1:23:52] because
[1:23:55] in
[1:23:56] the book of timothy paul says that they
[1:23:59] may lay hold on eternal life
[1:24:03] and that is jesus christ
[1:24:05] so god's ultimate intention
[1:24:09] is to work himself into us
[1:24:12] so that we may express him and represent
[1:24:16] him
[1:24:17] however there is only one way that this
[1:24:19] can be
[1:24:21] accomplished
[1:24:22] god must come into us
[1:24:25] to be our life
[1:24:29] it cannot be impersonated
[1:24:35] it cannot be imitated that's what
[1:24:37] prophet said
[1:24:39] christ must
[1:24:41] come in us
[1:24:42] then
[1:24:46] become our life
[1:24:48] today there is a great need for
[1:24:50] christian to see that
[1:24:52] god's intention is
[1:24:55] to make christ life to us
[1:24:58] that is his eternal will
[1:25:01] and god is always working on this goal
[1:25:07] amen
[1:25:10] and that goal
[1:25:12] or purpose
[1:25:14] is in three four
[1:25:18] let me read the mystery
[1:25:20] of god righteous the mystery of god
[1:25:22] revealed
[1:25:24] what is his threefold purpose
[1:25:28] manifest himself his self in jesus
[1:25:31] christ to come into the body
[1:25:34] by jesus christ
[1:25:37] number one number two
[1:25:39] to have the preeminence
[1:25:41] to have the preeminence in his body of
[1:25:44] believers
[1:25:45] that is his bride
[1:25:47] that he lived in people
[1:25:50] number three to restore back eden
[1:25:53] bring back that which was lost
[1:26:00] when he brings back eden
[1:26:03] which was lost
[1:26:04] then
[1:26:05] it is for all things to manifest christ
[1:26:11] so what god
[1:26:13] is
[1:26:18] achieving want to achieve
[1:26:24] prophet said
[1:26:26] he does these things in three steps
[1:26:29] first
[1:26:35] he was all alone
[1:26:39] and he hid in
[1:26:41] himself
[1:26:43] that he wanted to become
[1:26:45] a man
[1:26:46] that's jesus christ
[1:26:48] and but branham said
[1:26:50] what god was
[1:26:52] he poured himself into christ
[1:26:58] that
[1:26:59] christ
[1:27:00] may be the full
[1:27:02] expression and full manifestation of god
[1:27:07] and when christ jesus came he said son
[1:27:10] can do nothing
[1:27:14] except he see the father
[1:27:17] first doing
[1:27:19] so
[1:27:20] christ was
[1:27:22] in total submission
[1:27:26] god had
[1:27:27] preeminence
[1:27:29] in the body of christ
[1:27:33] and what god was
[1:27:35] he poured himself into christ
[1:27:38] and brother branham says the first part
[1:27:41] is
[1:27:42] manifest himself
[1:27:44] in jesus christ
[1:27:46] to come into the body
[1:27:48] by jesus christ
[1:27:51] and when he came in the body
[1:27:54] in jesus christ
[1:27:56] he had preeminence
[1:28:00] in that body
[1:28:03] that is the first step
[1:28:05] god
[1:28:06] came in christ
[1:28:09] and
[1:28:11] then
[1:28:12] he goes forward because he never stopped
[1:28:16] that what christ was
[1:28:18] he poured himself into the church
[1:28:22] that's our part
[1:28:24] that's what we are living
[1:28:27] christ in us
[1:28:30] that
[1:28:31] he may
[1:28:32] have
[1:28:33] the preeminence in the church
[1:28:36] in his body of believer
[1:28:41] that's what we are living now
[1:28:46] jesus christ in us
[1:28:48] that he may reveal his son
[1:28:52] in us
[1:28:54] that we may become the living
[1:28:57] manifestation
[1:28:58] of the written word
[1:29:02] that we may be his representative on the
[1:29:06] earth
[1:29:08] that we may be under his total
[1:29:10] submission
[1:29:12] because when he becomes jesus christ he
[1:29:16] gathered everything
[1:29:19] which is in heaven and which is on earth
[1:29:22] in that body
[1:29:23] in that person
[1:29:25] in that one place
[1:29:27] christ jesus
[1:29:31] amen
[1:29:34] we are here
[1:29:36] to fulfill that power
[1:29:38] that's why
[1:29:40] i have read revelation 22 17
[1:29:45] spirit and the bride say come
[1:29:50] when christ comes in us
[1:29:54] pour himself into us
[1:29:59] then we becomes the final voice to the
[1:30:02] final is
[1:30:04] god speaks
[1:30:06] god
[1:30:07] manifests himself
[1:30:10] into us
[1:30:11] through us he does his own work
[1:30:15] through us
[1:30:18] and he speaks through us
[1:30:20] we become his voice
[1:30:23] and
[1:30:24] said his voice is like
[1:30:26] many water
[1:30:28] people multitudes
[1:30:31] that's what we are
[1:30:34] here for
[1:30:36] to fulfill the second part
[1:30:39] to fulfill
[1:30:40] the second fourth we are living now in
[1:30:45] the second fourth
[1:30:47] we are living now in in the second fold
[1:30:51] of his great plan
[1:30:53] and purpose and that is his eternal will
[1:30:58] that
[1:30:59] we may come under his total submission
[1:31:05] amen
[1:31:08] said he needs one person
[1:31:10] who is totally surrendered
[1:31:13] and submitted to god
[1:31:15] he can do much
[1:31:17] can accomplish much in that one person
[1:31:21] the problem is
[1:31:23] we are not manifesting christ instead
[1:31:27] we are manifesting many other things
[1:31:32] we are manifesting the society we are
[1:31:35] manifesting
[1:31:36] worldly things and
[1:31:38] there are a lot of things
[1:31:42] but his eternal will is
[1:31:45] we may become written epistle
[1:31:49] we may be the living
[1:31:52] representation
[1:31:54] that is why he created adam
[1:32:03] and then
[1:32:04] when
[1:32:06] he take the preeminence in us
[1:32:11] when we become the world
[1:32:16] and
[1:32:17] we are under his total subjection
[1:32:20] then he takes us
[1:32:22] and goes to
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:25] the malini
[1:32:27] eden
[1:32:28] and what
[1:32:30] he does there
[1:32:31] then in the millennium
[1:32:33] he is the head over everything
[1:32:38] everything is under his subjection in
[1:32:41] the millennium amen
[1:32:45] so that is why
[1:32:47] brother branham said
[1:32:48] jesus christ is god's threefold purpose
[1:32:54] jesus christ
[1:32:55] is god's threefold goal
[1:32:59] jesus christ is
[1:33:01] god's
[1:33:02] threefold
[1:33:04] mystery
[1:33:06] jesus christ is god's threefold purpose
[1:33:10] jesus christ is the principal theme
[1:33:13] of the entire bible
[1:33:18] in other words
[1:33:22] it is for christ to be had over all
[1:33:26] thing
[1:33:30] and in this second fold
[1:33:33] second purpose of his will
[1:33:37] it is for men to be like christ to have
[1:33:40] his life and his glory
[1:33:44] amen
[1:33:47] and god will eventually reach his goal
[1:33:54] one day
[1:33:55] all things will manifest christ
[1:33:59] so i'm closing
[1:34:01] before closing
[1:34:07] i am telling
[1:34:10] that god
[1:34:12] came in jesus
[1:34:14] and he showed the preeminence
[1:34:16] and then christ
[1:34:18] came in the church
[1:34:20] he wanted to show
[1:34:22] the same kind of
[1:34:24] preeminence
[1:34:26] to the world
[1:34:29] to the people
[1:34:33] we are his victory
[1:34:40] he is looking for a church
[1:34:43] sin cannot stand there
[1:34:48] virtuous
[1:34:49] sinless
[1:34:52] bride of jesus christ
[1:34:54] a glorious church
[1:34:57] filled with christ
[1:35:02] and before he store
[1:35:05] the eden because the whole bible is
[1:35:08] in three steps three full purpose
[1:35:11] three-fold plan
[1:35:12] three 4
[1:35:15] goal
[1:35:18] god accomplished his plan in three steps
[1:35:24] and now
[1:35:27] this is the second step
[1:35:31] and in this step
[1:35:33] he want us
[1:35:35] to come
[1:35:38] under total subjection
[1:35:42] and christ
[1:35:44] may become our head
[1:35:47] as it is ephesians 4 15
[1:35:52] but speaking the truth
[1:35:54] in love may grow up into him in all
[1:35:58] things which is the head even christ
[1:36:03] in the millennium all things will be
[1:36:06] will become subject to him and we are
[1:36:09] headed up under him
[1:36:11] everything
[1:36:13] that he might gather together in one all
[1:36:15] things in christ both which are in
[1:36:17] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:36:19] him so god's plan has to do with the
[1:36:23] whole universe
[1:36:25] whole universe everything
[1:36:27] will come under his subjection
[1:36:30] in the millennium reign he's the king
[1:36:32] over
[1:36:33] everything
[1:36:34] but before it happens
[1:36:37] he wanted to show
[1:36:39] that preeminence
[1:36:41] that had ship
[1:36:43] in the body of believers
[1:36:46] in the church
[1:36:47] in us
[1:36:50] he
[1:36:54] he does not carry this
[1:36:56] work directly
[1:36:58] he does not go directly in the
[1:37:00] millennium
[1:37:02] but before that there are a bunch of
[1:37:05] people
[1:37:08] they are gathered
[1:37:10] by the message of the hour
[1:37:12] and they are the one who caught the
[1:37:14] revelation
[1:37:16] the mystery of god's threefold purpose
[1:37:19] god's threefold plan
[1:37:21] and they know what he wants to done with
[1:37:24] the world
[1:37:27] and the word is in them
[1:37:32] and they give the preeminence to the
[1:37:35] world
[1:37:37] they
[1:37:38] come under total submission to christ
[1:37:43] so god
[1:37:44] or jesus christ
[1:37:47] now
[1:37:48] in this second world
[1:37:51] he brings the church
[1:37:53] which is christ's body
[1:37:55] under the authority of christ's headship
[1:37:59] he shows in us that we are in complete
[1:38:02] submission
[1:38:05] he shows to satan
[1:38:08] to the word
[1:38:11] that we are
[1:38:12] his voice
[1:38:16] under the millennium reign he will be
[1:38:19] the head
[1:38:20] of everything
[1:38:24] but before that
[1:38:26] he wanted to show this in you his
[1:38:30] headsheet
[1:38:31] in me
[1:38:33] because when
[1:38:36] once he
[1:38:38] become man
[1:38:40] then he brings everything
[1:38:42] under his subjection
[1:38:44] jesus christ
[1:38:46] that is his eternal will
[1:38:50] but
[1:38:51] the question is
[1:38:54] is he
[1:38:55] your head
[1:38:57] is he the head of your house
[1:39:01] is he
[1:39:03] the head of your job
[1:39:07] is he the head of your life
[1:39:11] is he the head of
[1:39:14] your everything
[1:39:17] do we give the preeminence to god
[1:39:22] what are
[1:39:23] our priorities
[1:39:27] are we
[1:39:28] in total submission to christ
[1:39:35] that's what
[1:39:36] our part
[1:39:38] that's what god wants to do
[1:39:41] that he made
[1:39:43] his life
[1:39:44] in us
[1:39:47] and when he does that
[1:39:49] becomes into that kind of perfect unity
[1:39:53] then we will go
[1:39:55] to rest with god
[1:40:01] so this is very serious question
[1:40:07] is he the head
[1:40:09] of whatever we do
[1:40:13] because that's god's eternal will
[1:40:16] that he may be
[1:40:18] the head
[1:40:21] the church his body
[1:40:24] he may take the preeminence in us
[1:40:28] let's pray
[1:40:33] as we bow our heads
[1:40:35] you can think about it
[1:40:43] christ jesus is god's threefold
[1:40:46] purpose
[1:40:47] christ jesus is god's threefold mystery
[1:40:51] now that mystery is in us
[1:40:55] and we must the bride
[1:40:58] reveal this mystery
[1:41:00] which is christ jesus
[1:41:06] dear heavenly father
[1:41:09] we want to thank you for your word
[1:41:14] and we see that great plan
[1:41:18] which is
[1:41:19] revealed and unfolded by the message of
[1:41:22] the hour
[1:41:25] and we
[1:41:26] see that
[1:41:28] this plan
[1:41:30] is that
[1:41:33] you want to come in the body of the
[1:41:36] believer
[1:41:37] you wanted to have the preeminence

[1:43:29] we may magnify your name
[1:43:32] in whatever we do
[1:43:35] we want to magnify your name before the
[1:43:38] people
[1:43:39] through our lives
[1:43:41] when they see our lives they glorify you

[1:43:48] and without you we can do nothing
[1:43:51] and you are that life

[1:43:56] be impersonated

[1:45:50] is
[1:45:52] [Music]
[1:46:00] is
[1:46:02] [Music]
[1:46:32] let's all stand
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:34] i don't know about you but i was greatly
[1:46:36] edified by the word
[1:46:39] and i was also challenged
[1:46:42] amen i
[1:46:43] you know i want to
[1:46:45] i've given him my life but i want to
[1:46:47] give him more of my life
[1:46:49] i want to go deeper in those things and
[1:46:51] my commitment to him and my surrender
[1:46:54] how many of you believe that you died
[1:46:56] out and gave all to christ but then you
[1:46:58] find out that there's more to die out to
[1:47:00] and then you find out there's more to
[1:47:02] die out to and then as time goes on you
[1:47:05] find out there's more to die out to
[1:47:07] well this morning i found out there's
[1:47:09] more to die out to
[1:47:11] but you know what whenever i hear it all
[1:47:13] i want to do is give him everything
[1:47:15] i really want to die out and i believe
[1:47:17] you do too i want christ to have
[1:47:19] preeminence in me
[1:47:21] it's the call of the age it's the
[1:47:23] purpose of the second fold it's where
[1:47:25] we're at it's the cry that's in our
[1:47:27] heart lord take more of me
[1:47:29] as i give up more will you take more
[1:47:32] i believe that's where the bride ought
[1:47:34] to be not in pride not in arrogance but
[1:47:38] in that constant saying god i want to
[1:47:41] die paul said i die daily i want to die
[1:47:44] daily
[1:47:45] and i want him to have preeminence if
[1:47:47] that's the second fold of his great
[1:47:49] purpose
[1:47:50] if that's the point that we're at now
[1:47:52] then there's nothing
[1:47:54] nothing more important than him having
[1:47:57] preeminence in you and i
[1:47:59] there is nothing that supersedes that so
[1:48:02] that should be the thing that matters
[1:48:04] most to us in life than anything else
[1:48:07] not what we'll do next or our job or our
[1:48:09] plan but the thing that should be front
[1:48:11] and center and foremost on our mind is
[1:48:13] god please have preeminence in me and
[1:48:16] take out anything that's hindering that
[1:48:18] preeminence
[1:48:19] i want you to have first place
[1:48:21] oh i appreciate
[1:48:23] the lord i appreciate god and i
