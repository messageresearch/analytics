TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and this is a a interesting dialogue that brother Benham is having with the Catholic priest because the Catholic said oh God is in his church and we know that's also true is that true God is in his church amen and they're taking a promise to the bride upon themselves falsely so but that's a promise to the bride of Christ a true church that God is in his church amen but what they did with that Revelation is they made themselves the authority of the word and they gave themselves the right to adjust it or change it so they took a true Revelation and by a true Revelation misappropriated amen they lost the guide to the word and they became their own guide and could no longer find the word and why this is so important is because the truth and error are so close they travel on such close lines amen now if we do the same thing the Catholic Church says and say we are the bride we are the word and we start interpreting our own word we'll do the same exact thing the Catholic Church did but this word amen that's been revealed to us through a prophetic ministry will guide us to the light every time we can never become our own guide and to me that's that's where I believe the bride must stay on that Razor's Edge where she is the word for the day amen she she is the Tabernacle of deity absolutely she's the manifestation of the word for this day amen but she can never become her own interpreter of the word amen there's already been the interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication through a prophetic Ministry to bring us back to the truth of the Bible amen and that's why it's so important we don't start coming up with our own Revelations amen it's a Catholic spirit and it's dangerous to keep saying we're the bride we're the bride we're the bride amen God gave us one thing to check everything with and that's his Bible amen and we don't take our own interpretation we take the interpretation that's been given to us in this day this ministry praise God but then if we get so self-confident that as if as if everybody in the bride agrees on something will be right that doesn't make it right because you don't know that everybody around you's bride praise God we have to stick with the word so I think this is so super important the day that we live in Deception comes in many ways but it always comes close to the truth we have to stick with the word that's been revealed in our day
