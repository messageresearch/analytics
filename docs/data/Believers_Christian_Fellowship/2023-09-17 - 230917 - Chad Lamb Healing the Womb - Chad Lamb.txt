in this day we ask you do all these things according to your purpose in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning certainly good to be here with you all amen if you'll take your Bibles while we're standing we'll read a scripture and then uh we'll let you be seated in just a moment let's turn to Genesis chapter 3 amen just want to remind you that um brother Emanuel will be taking the services coming Wednesday he'll be sharing with us some of what the Lord has done while he's been gone and it's good to have brother Emanuel back isn't it Wednesday and today amen also want to let you know that brother Ben seol is in Michigan preaching for brother Dan Ratliff this morning so that's where he's at today and also this coming Sunday brother Kyle will be up in Lorraine preaching for brother Nathaniel cias so everybody's going everywhere amen and that's fine as long as everybody gets back for camp for a retreat so we can all be together for the family Retreat amen so just be praying for these brothers that God would bless them and use them mly amen let's look at Genesis 3 verse 13 and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent begal me and I did eat verse 16 unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee let's look at verse 20 and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living amen God bless you as you take your seats and we begin to look at these scriptures amen we just want to welcome all our visitors amen God bless you it's good to have you with us God bless you Sister Faith it's good to see you again amen God has been good amen now as we look at this um these scriptures it's all related to one event and this event is the fall we know that the fall came because Eve left the protection of the word she was seduced and beguiled by the serpent amen he brought to her reasoning and she reasoned in her mind and brother Benham said before she ever fell in her body she fell in her mind amen she took the reasoning of The Serpent and and she took his comments contradictory to the word and it sounded reasonable and it began she began to be seduced into such a way that she thought she was doing something good when she was in fact doing something evil she was beguiled she was seduced she was deceived and and so in doing that she allowed something other than the word amen into her mind and she considered something other than the word and and it began to bring a corruption in her thinking and then she moved into the Act and the ACT brought a corruption into her body amen and then it brought a corruption upon the Earth because now amen there was going to be children born because of this sin because of this fall cuz we know that it was adultery and then then behind the adultery there was there was sex by Will and and now all of this is going to begin to unfold the situation we're in now and it all started back here and so all of all the scriptures we read are all related to the same thing that the woman was deceived by the serpent but then she was cursed but the curse had to do with bearing children amen the great I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and th conception so now the now now the the fall amen her sin brought upon this condition and then when we go to verse 20 and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living amen this is seems like a good thing but it's not a good thing before she didn't need an identification she didn't need a name because her identity was in Adam amen her name was Adam when God created him he made them male and female he created he them and called their name Adam this is in Genesis chter 5 so she already had an identification she already had an identity but the fall brought her a separate identification and that identification is a result of adultery is a result of the Fall result of reasoning a result of leaving the word amen so then we we we find a state where now amen God wanted to accomplish something upon the Earth and we're going to look at this and God wanted to do something on the earth and and now this plan is going to now fall into ruin and move into a Plan of Redemption which we know also serves God's purpose amen but but now Eve was supposed to bring forth a a child but now that her wound was tainted by the Fall she's not able to bring it forth in the way that was originally intended okay so now let's jump back to verse 15 this is the the Lord speaking to the serpent said I will put in it between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel now the curse comes to the serpent that he now changes his whole physical structure no longer will he be able to mingle seed with human anymore now he's brought to crawl on his belly the legs come off of him no more ability to communicate with a human being now he is put to the ground and then he then now verse 15 is not is not just the curse now verse 15 becomes a prophecy amen yes I will put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel this is the prophecy of the coming Christ the seed the seed of the woman amen but we know that that Eve that woman canot produce that seed because the womb has been corrupted she hybrid her seed brother Venom says so now I I want to look at the quote in Satan's Eden says and so God knew that we would be here but then he put us in flesh so we would be contacted in order he would contact he became one of us when he became Jesus Christ the son of God himself the fullness of the manifestation of God therefore that was God's purpose to display his attributes in Fellowship when I was in my father I knew nothing about it but when I became his son I was born of him I was an attribute of part of my father and you're a part of your father and as children of God we are part of God's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have Fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon the Earth and that was God's purpose at the beginning amen yes sir that's what God wanted at the beginning so from the very beginning what God wanted was his attributes to come forth and be expressed upon the Earth to have Fellowship as a family upon the Earth amen that's what God wanted amen and and and before it could come forth in Perfection amen there was a corruption that set in through Eve receiving the wrong seed bringing a hybridization and bringing corruption and now that way was corrupted so now God comes through the way of redemption and he's going to accomplish the same purpose amen only in doing it he's also going to express himself the rest of the attributes that can only be expressed this way amen but the original the original intention was to to bring his attributes into flesh to have Fellowship as a family of God upon the Earth amen praise the Lord continue on in the same quote he had everything under control when he turned man over in the Garden of Eden on free moral agency he said son it's yours what a beautiful place God Was So Satisfied till he just went back and rested from all his works every tree never brought forth thorn thns and thistles no berries ever came off a Thorn Tree everything was perfect all seeds were perfect everything was in perfect condition then when he went to take a little rest his enemy slipped in with deceit and took it over by misinterpreting his program to his children amen that deception was so deadly by misinterpreting God's program to his children by bringing a deception by reasoning by reasoning on the word and missing interpreting God's program brought the ruination amen the collapse of Eden amen the the casting out of the Garden of Eden and the the fall of Man and the corruption in our bodies and death and the cycle of Destruction and everything that we see came because he misinterpreted God's program to his children and he was deceived by that so in relating to the God's purpose his initial purpose in the pergan church age from the church age book The Prophet says the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God but she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to die so what was why was uh Adam given a bride he was given a bride to reproduce himself upon the earth when we want to understand God Amen we understand God by his original intent by his original work amen because what God did in his original work in creation what we see in Genesis the first two three chapters in Genesis what we see God doing is God fores showing what he intends to do amen and then then there was a fall in a cycle of redemption but the cycle of redemption is a cycle it's a circle it brings us right back to this intention so you see by the end of of it we come back to where we started so the beginning declared the end because God knew the end from the beginning he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end so the the whole cycle of redemption was to come back to this this is the picture this is what he wants if we want to understand God we understand God by what he does by what he displays by how he shows himself and then everything he's doing is to come back to this praise God and spoken word is the Original Seed and I'm going to be quoting quite a bit out of that message says all of God's son must be the same yes sir to be born of the word of and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 see to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again into the place of where you should have been at the beginning we come into this Earth brother B said you were born wrong yes right you're not you're ought to be condition you're now come in a fallen condition this body the ought to be condition wasn't a fallen human body it was a human body not a hybrid human body amen not one with with animalistic nature mixed into it with by hybridization by deception we were we were to come to flesh but not this way yes so now God has to do something to bring us back amen because he can't just leave us like this because God's purpose can't be defeated amen when God made his original Masterpiece and it fell by ruin and it was laying there brother bam said laying there in the dirt he went to work immediately to rebuild his Masterpiece because God's not going to be defeated in his purpose see this is what is so beautiful about the message is is when when when we think about the opening of the seals amen the the sounding of the trumpets it's it's these it's this mystery this this mysterious Thunders that give the bride Faith amen why because it takes the seals off the book and what it does is it unbinds the entire Bible amen and when he unbinds the entire Bible we begin to see God's whole purpose and God's whole plan but more importantly than just seeing God's purpose and God's plan he begins to reveal to us his purpose in US according to his plan that's what begins to build such personal faith amen so now God has got the way to to bring it back he said so when when you're born of the word and spirit not natural birth but spiritual birth when you're born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again amen like in John 3 to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again to the place of where you should have been at the beginning that's the reason of Christ death brings us right back again to where sons of God if Eve would have brought forth that child she would have finally done it did not God tell her multiply and replenish the Earth but she had to walk over here and play the part of a amen that's strong language but that's Bible language it's not just brother bram's language that's Bible language when she do she she she mixed her seed she hybridized herself amen and she couldn't bring forth that child anymore she couldn't bring forth that son she could no longer help Adam reproduce himself upon the Earth because now it wouldn't come right so as I'm preaching this uh I'm actually backing up and grabbing a a thought that I preached in U Poland and I know several of you went and watched those because I tried to forbid you and you did it anyways but but it's been on my heart to share it here at home too because God opened up just a little nugget I mean it's not like a uh anything brand new but God just opened up a little nugget for me I mean when I was over there ministering in Poland and it blessed me so much and I want to share that with you but but every time we look at it it expands amen even from then it's expanded in my heart and and these are things we're familiar with but they just keep expanding amen they're becoming more of a reality it's it we saw the picture but the picture's coming in Greater Clarity greater Focus amen it's amazing that we've had television around for how long we've had television around I don't know maybe 70 80 years we've had television around amen but the first television compared to the HD 5K 6K screen you have now it's a drastic difference amen and we've been looking at the same message for a long time but I'm telling you by the grace of God and Revelation the clarity is coming amen the color is becoming more Vivid it's moving from black and white grainy now there's some color but the color is not exactly like the color we see naturally it's kind of but then it becomes more real and more real and more real until they're going to have screens pretty soon that people are just going to walk right into thinking it's the reality amen they'll bump into it it'll be a picture of a window or a door and somebody's going to smash their face it's becoming so clear this message is becoming so clear amen amen oh I thank God for that so when I was in Romania I preached the message on healing the womb and that's what I want to talk about now because we find that Eve corrupted her womb by receiving the wrong seed the wound that was supposed to bring forth that seed that child it was corrupted amen and and everything that came forth from that wound was now corrupted so she could no longer no longer keep that promise she could no longer produce that word and and so she can no longer produce Christ is that right but then God laid a prophecy down in verse 15 of chapter 3 in Genesis that there would be a seed that would bruise the head of the Serpent's Seed amen he laid a prophecy sound that there would be a seed it would come forth but in order for that to come forth now he can't go to just any womb to any woman because it's all hybrid so now he has to come to a virgin womb amen a virgin womb amen and the Virgin womb of Mary amen God used now this wasn't any part of Mary it couldn't be part of Mary or else it would still be hybrid it still be corrupt but God had a virgin womb and in that virgin womb he planted himself his Creation in that womb and to bring forth out of a virgin wound showing it takes virgy amen because what we had before wouldn't work amen and then there he plants himself in there and now through a virgin wound amen Comes This seed Christ the body of Christ amen that wound produced the body of Christ or the body of Jesus Christ the flesh body so this is what God was doing in the prophecy amen and all of these things listen everything I'm talking about relates to us amen everything I'm talking about is not just a story story it's not just history you know it's wonderful to understand what happened I mean it's amazing to understand what happened it unlocks so much understanding when we understand what happened in the garden now we know why Jesus had to be virgin born yes and now we know why there had to be human blood as a sacrifice to atone for the sins of the people without understanding the Fall In the Garden of Eden our Christian religion becomes some sort of piece together fairy tale without a real logical understanding of why a a human sacrifice why a virgin birth the answer to the why is the Revelation that was laying under the seals of what what had happened back before the foundation of the world Amen but as wonderful as that is to know and the encouragement it gives us to have faith in God's word and faith in God's ability amen all of that relates to you and I and all of that must become personal to you and I because we say it this way everything God does in the macrocosm in the the great picture he's doing in the microcosm of your life and there has to be a correlation between the macro and the micro amen and the spoken word is the Original Seed he says the only way that we can ever be born again is first the womb of the Mind receive the word and then the spirit comes on top of that and brings it to life there you are that's what does it that's the real gospel teaching brother I believe it's I now I love this I believe if St Paul was standing today he teach the same thing I do in this hour I believe that amen I love the way he says that I didn't that wasn't even part of my thought I just had to conclude it it was so good then further down he says now Mary's wound Mary's wound the physical mind see was virgin WB why she believed God's word no matter how much anybody criticized how many things somebody else said that didn't have one thing to do with it she believed God's word regardless oh I wish I could just get that over are you getting it first was her mind before the act ever taken place in her little room the ACT had to take place here first to let the Spirit come in to do the rest of the work now he's even speaking about Mary when it comes to to the Virgin Mary now an angel comes to her an angel messenger comes to her and brings her a message amen and what's the message he's bringing to her he's bringing her to her amen God's will for her day he's bringing to her the revealed word for her hour that's what this Angel is bringing to Mary that th now he's telling her it's time for this prophecy that's been laying in this Bible so long it's time for this prophecy to be fulfilled amen but you realize with prophecy there's always a time and a place amen yeah so what this Angel messenger brings to to Mary is not just the time it's time that's wonderful but he brings to her the place amen and I tell you this I believe with all my heart it's easier for Mary to receive the time of the prophecy than to receive the place of the prophecy wow because she can say yes we've been waiting for this yes we want the Messiah yes and it's in you wait wait a second how is this going to be knowing that I know no no man I I can't see how I can do this I can't see how it can be me I'm just a a 15 16 year old girl amen living in Nazareth amen getting ready to be married to a man I I I want the promise to come I want it to be time I believe that it's time I believe that it's overdue I can see the condition we need the Messiah and then he says but the Messiah is coming from you and she said wait a minute hold on Amen praise God you realize that the when we look at prophecy and we look down through the Bible amen the woman has always been the hidden Mystery in the mystery am I hope I can I hope I can share this in a way that it'll it'll just start dinging the Revelation Bells inside when God said let us make man in our image and our likeness and he made them male and female God made one form one vessel and that one being was Adam and in Adam Adam was reflecting God Amen so Adam was a mystery revealed amen what was it it was the mystery of God yes let us make man in our image So Adam was the mystery of God revealed is that right but there's a further mystery in the mystery and the further mystery in the mystery was the bride amen was the feminine amen that had to be expressed as well so contained in the mystery was a another mystery and the other mystery was the woman amen praise God Amen all right yes so when when Adam was commissioned when he was still in spirit form he was commissioned to multiply and replenish amen so in order for God to bring that to pass he brings him in the flesh but that's not the end of the mystery in order to bring that to pass now he brings another part of Adam into flesh and that's the female part of Adam he brings in the flesh unites the two together and now the prophecy can be fulfilled and just before it's fulfilled the devil slips in but deception and corrupts her womb so we see where the problem is so the woman is always the hidden Mystery of the mystery God said I will put enmity between thy seed and her seed so there's a mystery laying in the woman but the question is which woman praise God there's which woman amen that was always the mystery which woman is it is it the woman of Israel the nation of Israel that God wants to marry will it be her she's in feminine distinction will it be the church where is this woman and all of a sudden the messenger from God comes to Mary and says you're the woman you're the revelation of the mystery that was in God's mind before the foundation of the world and when he says I will put imity between thy seat and her seat he was thinking of you and now all of a sudden you talk about a a big mouthful to swallow down this young girl amen who who who probably may have never hardly left her Village in her whole life maybe just a couple of times she had a very small world she had a very narrow window amen and now an angel comes to her and says you're it she was the great mystery that had been waiting to be revealed for thousands of years she was the mystery contained in the prophecy in the Bible she was it amen yes Genesis 3:15 she's part of it amen Isaiah 7 she's part of it all those scriptures she's part of it amen she doesn't know she's part of it cuz she was born with spiritual Amnesia she come into the world like you and I come into the world she has no understanding she didn't wake up and say I think I'm part of the prophecy no it took an angel messenger from God to wake her up to the fact that you're the one amen God you know we can look we can look at the prophecy amen and we can see am mean as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the in the revealing of the son of man absolutely Sodom all over I mean the Sodom condition is here we can say that these things must be revealed at the end time we can look we got we see the flashing red lights of his we see the signs of the end all around us we can say it's time for this prophecy to be fulfilled and God sends an angel messenger and I day say this is the hour this is the time this is the Fulfillment of the scriptures and we can say amen hallelujah we need it we know it it's the return of Christ this is what we need this is the long awaited restoration the restoring all things but there's another mystery in that mystery and the Mystery in that mystery was not just the time but also the place where is the place where will this prophecy come to life where will it be manifest it'll be manifest I don't know what you can say but I can say by faith it'll be manifest here by the grace of God because I heard something else in the prophet's voice I heard more than it's time I heard it's time and you're it amen amen and Mary Mary had to believe something she could not prove she could not test how was she going to test it brother bandam said before she felt one thing before she had any evidence she was pregnant yeah the Bible doesn't show us that she waited another month to see what would happen but immediately she ran to Elizabeth's house and confessed to Elizabeth what had taken place in her life showing that Mary believed what this angel said see sometimes the problem is we're afraid to confess what our heart's telling us because we don't have the right evidence we don't have any proof I'm not so sure I still feel this way I woke up the next morning I'm feeling this way I'm not really sure if something's going on inside that's am Mary wasn't afraid to confess amen what she had believed what the angel had told her and so the woman is another part of this prophecy oh praise God I don't know where to go next I'm jumping around let's just jump let's take a jump you want to jump with me let's go to uh Genesis chapter 18 Genesis Chapter 18 let's look at verse one Genesis 18 And1 in Genesis 18:1 it says and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamry and he sat the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass pass not away I pray thee from thy servant so here in Genesis 18 the Lord is appearing to Abraham he's visiting Abraham amen and God had given Abraham a prophecy he had told Abraham that his seed shall inherit the land and and it was a prophecy all the way back when God first called Abraham he gave him this prophecy that that I'm G taking you to a land and I'm going to give it to you and your seed and and and he and God speaks to Abraham this way and then we come here after God had dealt with Abraham we saw Abraham's journeyings through the Book of Genesis and the Transitions and the movements and we see God come to him and I remember I think it was about 2 years ago maybe brother Les coli came to me after a service and he showed me that this is the seventh time that God comes to Abraham I didn't have time to look it up right then I I just believed him but just before I went to Edmonton this couple months ago I sat down and I went through the Book of Genesis and I looked at it and this is exactly the seventh time that God Appears to Abraham the seventh time God comes to Abraham either comes to him in a vision he speaks to him by a voice he appears to him in some other way amen and this is the seventh time and so the seventh time that God comes Amen to the Seed of Abraham to the the the recipient of the promise and the seventh time something's going to transpire so beautiful friends this word just keeps unveiling keeps unfolding and and through the prophecy he keeps telling Abraham you know this is your land the your seed shall possess it but he has no seed he can't have a child and the problem is is is there's no conception is that right there's no way to produce the promise because Sarah is Barren and Sarah is Abraham's wife and and so Sarah realizes she's Barren and she tells Abraham the Lord is uh withholding me from having child take Hagar it's legal we can do this and perhaps they'll raise up a child and all of the we we understand all we've been through all of that before but but we we realize now that Sarah didn't doubt the promise she believed the promise her effort to produce the promise showed she believ in the promise what Sarah was missing was not the timing of the promise or the faith in the promise she was missing the place of the promise that's right she was missing her part in the prophecy believing the prophecy she believed that Abraham was chosen of God no doubt Abraham discussed these things with her wife she believed the prophecy she believed he would have a seed to believed he would inherit the land amen but she didn't believe she could do it amen she didn't believe it could be her so then there's a there's a visitation and a visitation and a visitation and a visitation but now we have the seventh visitation and in the seventh visitation God comes in flesh in the seventh Church age in the seventh visitation now God doesn't just come as a vision he doesn't come as a voice now he comes in flesh amen the same thing repeat in our day in the seventh Church a god Came In the Flesh of a prophet amen it was a son of man revealing the son of man amen the PLS of man were repeated where he discerned the thoughts in Sarah's uh heart been the tent door behind him and the prophet of God stood here and did the same thing referencing re Genesis 18 showing us that this event is taking place in our day and before we come to the seventh visitation God starts visiting Abraham starts telling him it's Sarah not until I think it's the I think it's the sixth time that he comes to him not until then he says out of he says you'll have a seed then he says out of thy loins see the prophecy's building new bits of information are coming all the time it never changed the prophecy it was true from day one when the culmination was already determined when he first spoke it but every time God visits Abraham he adds a little more amen he says your seed shall possess the land then he says what will you give me another visitation what will you give me seeing I have no child Amen in this eleas or us and and all these things he says no it won't be thy servant amen it'll come from your loins now he's got more information now there settles the confusion I'm not looking to adopt a seed to make a seed it'll come out of my loins amen then go on more information and more information until finally I think it's the sixth visitation I didn't go back and check it but he comes and he says no out of Sarah Sarah shall have the child Sarah shall have the son is that right right so then we come to the seventh and in the seventh God's coming down to confirm the promise this is just amazing to me let's go to verse n chapter 18:9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the man or women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord uh my my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of shy bear a child which am old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son he come he came in flesh and when he came in flesh and he showed the sign of the Messiah because this would become the sign of the Messiah when Jesus is here he came in flesh and what was he doing he had come to Abraham and he had come to Abraham and he had come to Abraham and as far as we know in all of those visitations Sarah was never included but in this visitation God was going to include Sarah amen now the the word would be performed on her now the discernment would be on her when in the seventh visitation when he comes comes in flesh says it this is the this is the message uh resume of the ages from the church age book the last chapter of the church age book said this age started just after the turn of the of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power so he begins to speak about what happened in the Pentecostal Revival at zeusa Street but I just wanted to grab this statement he said it was it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost what bride was she was Pentecost she was a virgin bride is that right but the prophet told us before that he came to her in the Union in the marriage Union she was already a fallen woman so in returning and returning her back to what she was at Pentecost would bring her her back to a virgin bride amen but Pentecost never went on to the full promise they fell before the full promise we understand that so returning back to Pentecost is not the destination returning back to Pentecost brings us back to a condition so that we can fulfill what they failed and what was that to go all the way on to a union with Christ amen and then do what reproduce Christ amen this is important things to understand it's you got to take the whole message and to get the whole picture of what the prophet's telling us because if we go back and stop at Pentecost Pentecost was the starting point not the stopping point so to return back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers amen just brings us back to the right starting point so that we can finish the commission not so that we can go back there and stay there and camp out there and say this is wonderful we return you return to do what they didn't do that's the point of the return and so when in the seventh in the seventh visitation when God comes in flesh and discerns the thoughts and and the tent behind him and he does all of that what immediately happens after that immediately after that they're turned back young amen is that right because then in the next chapter amen they go down to Gar and when they go down to Gar amen all of a sudden we know aimc the king of gar he wants to take Sarah amen who's already 80 years old to be his wife because he assumes she's a fair young virgin why because the 80-year-old Sarah was young again this King could have any virgin he wants the prophet shows us this out of the Bible and and he wants Sarah because Sarah is beautiful being an 80y old woman so we see that in the seventh age in the visitation when God came in flesh amen he turned them back young but it's going to take something more than going back to their original condition because in Sarah's original condition she had not yet conceived the promise and brought forth the promise amen there's a Myster laying in Sarah and the promise was to Abraham but Sarah was part of Abraham so she's part of the mystery she's the mystery behind the mystery amen so now they go back to young again but when they go back to young again it still doesn't bring a conception it brings him back to the right condition so that she can bear a child carry the child remember brother Brenham said she her heart was old she would had a heart attack her milk veins were dyed up she couldn't bring forth this life first he had to take her back to her youth back to her original condition back to the faith of the fathers back to what she was at Pentecost so that she could bring forth this child in strength not in weakness there's still no conception right so we go through verse 20 gar we go to or chapter 20 now we go to chapter 21 and in chapter 18 we've been through this before but I just want to refresh you chapter 18 he says I will return unto thee who's he speaking to Abraham he say because Sarah's in the tent behind Abra he tells Abraham I will return unto thee at the appointed time I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son now they're young they go to gar they have the all the things that transpire in gar then he sends them away and Abraham has to pray for them and all that transpires and after that he comes to verse 21 it says and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him God said to Abraham I will visit you you realize after he said that we don't read anym in the Bible where he visited Abraham because Sarah is part of Abraham and so when he says I will visit you at the appointed time I will visit you how did that visit take place it took place in chapter 21 when the Lord visited Sarah amen look in this visitation when you look into this visitation he says and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken and for Sarah conceived here comes the conception not in the seventh visitation but this is the eighth visitation this is the eighth time he come and the eighth time is life eighth time is eternity eighth is new day amen now he confirmed the promise and now he's here to fulfill the promise and he comes to Sarah in the eighth visitation which is the first back to the beginning again and in this visitation we don't have a public sign a public working and nothing we can reference there's nothing tell me what happened what did he say what did it look like was it smoke was it fire was it voice we have no record whatsoever in 211 of what happened the only thing we know is that he visited Sarah how we don't know what was the experience we don't know what did she see we don't know what did she hear we don't know what did she feel we don't know one thing we know for sure she got a private visitation from God herself and that visitation produced a conception which is what they did not have at [Applause] Pentecost amen amen so the seventh visitation God in flesh PLS of memmory bring us back to a virgin condition back to what we are at Pentecost to move into the conception but to come come to conception it's going to take a visitation from almighty God privately to you amen and you don't have anything to base it off of Amen you don't have any certain sign to look for you don't have any certain experience you can attach it to amen because because in the third pool amen when they went into the little room they had nothing that they could express nothing that could they say nothing that they could explain all they could say is where I was this way coming in I'm this way coming out something happened to me everything is different for me but I can't give you the formula I can't give you a recipe I can't give you something to repeat and I can't oh my goodness I can't confuse you with my recipe you just have to come in contact with God yourself for what purpose for what purpose see this is the thing that becomes so intriguing and so important we can talk about meeting God and we can talk about an experience with God and we can talk about uh the little room and we can talk about the third pool and we can talk about and we can get excited we can shout But realize that visitation was to do something not so for the rest of Sarah's life she says I met God I had an experience with God yes but what did it do for you what was the experience for what was the private visitation to do it was to fulfill the promise in her what she could not do herself what she could not produce what she didn't have strength for amen and all of her efforts all of her life she could not conceive when she was a virgin brother Bram said they probably lived together since she was a little girl 15 16 years of age amen and all the opportunities they had to come together for conception when she was in the prime of her health when the prime of her her strength he could not produce this son could not produce this son it was going to take God himself coming on the scene and when God himself came on the scene in the seventh visitation what was he trying to do he was trying to awaken Sarah to her part in the prophecy and in this seventh visit in the seventh Church age when God repeated what he did on the plains of memory he's trying to wake up the bride to her part in the prophecy it's you amen it's you it's not your handmade it's not somebody else it's not another age it's not in the future you're not too old amen praise God let's go to Hebrews chapter 11 Hebrews chapter 11 verse 11 through faith chapter 11 is the faith chapter without faith is impossible to please God the worlds were framed by the faith faith is the evidence faith is the substance through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised I love this scripture we've preached it before but this scripture has come to life to me in this last year by faith through faith Sarah herself received strength where did Sarah get this Faith amen she read what did what did the Faith do through faith she received strength to conceive seed what was it Sarah could not do conceive seed she could not conceive seed when she was young when she was a faithful wife when she lived for years in the strength bar childbearing years she could not produce this then she gets old she knows she can't do it she's lost all faith in her being part of the promise then God comes down and restores her faith and begins to show her a sign of discernment and turns her back young again and though she's back young it still doesn't change the problem she can't conceive seed she can be young she can be all that she was when she was a young virgin bride to her husband she can be all that she was that the first church was you understand what I'm saying go back to being everything the first church was but the first church failed amen so there's got to be something more happened then just going back to being what the first church was we have to go back to that Amen to restore our strength but it's going to take Faith amen for us to bring a conception and what kind of Faith listen I'm I'm telling you it's not communal Faith it's not group Faith Sarah herself individual Faith herself received strength to conceive SE why through faith how did she get the strength to conceive this seed through faith what awakened her faith it was a personal visitation from God amen amen oh friends praise be to God Amen let's let's take this message the entirety of the message amen and say God hey this is something that you've done this is not something man's done amen when you see what God did here to Abraham to fulfill the promise God came to Abraham Abraham never came to God God gave him a promise Abraham believed that promise where did Abraham get the faith to believe that from God Amen then God you know every time God came to Abraham Abraham never came to God God came to Abraham and then when you come in flesh in the in the seventh visitation God came to Abraham a mean it was God God God God performed this God did this God willed this God accomplished this God did it all that's what we realize it's God Amen but God has a Time and God has a place oh praise be to God well praise the Lord I don't have a clue where I'm at but I'm happy am I'm feeling good wherever I'm at it's a happy place because God is unveiling the mysteries of our life amen praise the Lord so ah yeah let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 let's pick it up right here and just see where we go from here Ephesians chapter 4 verse 17 remember he had just said in spoken words the original see we read this before the only way that we can ever be born again is first in the womb of our mind receive the word and then the Spirit comes on top of that and brings it to life he talks about Mary Mary first Mary's wom the physical mind see she was a virgin womb she believed God's word so first it was in her mind first she received the word and then when she received the word by faith then it came to pass in her body so now let's look at Ephesians chapter 4:1 17 says this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding dark and being alienated from being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over into lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness but ye have not so learned Christ if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after God has created and righteousness and true Holiness this is this is just referencing what brother bam talked about first it was in her mind and our minds were alienated from God because of the ignorance that was in us the darkness that was in us when we were born and walked as other Gentiles walk so what is God going to do first he's going to pierce the darkness with an illumination with the word amen and and that word that illumination is going to bring something to our minds that we receive then the spirit comes upon it it'll bring a new birth praise God he says again in spoken word he says now what was it a virgin mind womb virgin womb for the baby results eternal life Eve a good woman as she was virgin as she was but first she let the doubt come in by the word a devil's lie what did to do brought her into contact in the wrong way what was her child death Mary a virgin mine virgin womb when the devil tried to tempt her and the angel come to her then and said you're going to have a baby Satan said oh now I better inquire about that angel said it's an act of God and she no doubt thought of Isaiah 9:6 she said behold the hands made of the Lord what's the results virgin birth Eternal Word in her and she brought forth eternal life what's he saying one deception brings death but then when the word comes amen it comes into her mind and she remembers the word Isaiah 9:6 and then she surrenders to the word what's the results life amen praise God let's look at Colossians 1 Colossians chapter 1 verse 19 for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell praise God and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven and ye that were sometimes alienated in enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight praise God we were alienated and enemies in our mind why we had the wrong understanding no understanding carnal Spirit carnal thinking the reasoning that Satan had brought uh to Eve had permeated the whole world it's what we were raised in we were raised in the reasoning of the world the the the darkened mind we were alienated in enemies in our mind but God was going to bring a word to pierce the darkness and drive the darkness away now this is where I'm really wanting to to labor for a little bit again in spoken word he says when Christ comes to his bride she'll be a virgin like Mary was this is so so good so hang with me for God will not bring Christ through a womb of a and neither will he bring the bride he can't bring his word through a of his word now I want to listen to that sentence again carefully God will not bring Christ through a womb of a and neither will he bring the bride so what's he wanting to bring in this day he's wanting to bring forth a bride amen which is Christ he can't bring his word through a of his word them is horrible words but that's what the Bible says I'm saying what it says this has got to be understood the pro the true bride like Mary will have a virgin wound for the Bride of the word which is Christ when Christ the word comes to the bride she'll be the same as he is a Virgin by the word praise God Amen I hope it's going over see I hope you understand what was he word the word of God upon his vest had a name written the word of God in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and one Among Us he is God and God is the word and when his bride comes she'll be the same product that he is amen then he says virgin yes oh we're going to get to this friends because you and I in the wombs of our mind in the spiritual womb we were not virgin we had listened to everything heard everything listened to every kind of Filth told every kind and heard every kind of joke watched every kind of program seen heard participated in the wickedness of this world how can we say our minds were virgin but when he comes to her she'll be virgin amen what a dilemma we're born in hybridization with the wrong spirit with the womb of our spirit totally corrupted and polluted alienated in our mind we come in a horrible condition no ability no ability to bring forth Christ no ability to conceive no no no cleanness that we can offer no clean place for the word to come to is that right we have none of that but he says when he comes to her she'll be virgin I believe it what a dilemma we've got amen and and you know here's what causes some of the dilemma and people to receive this prophecy they said well I did this and I did that and I thought this and I conducted this and I participated in this and I did all of these things how could God choose me my how could he choose you he chose you before you did all those things hallelujah amen the those things weren't in the equation when he chose you he chose you before and none of those things amen can do away with his choice praise God when God makes a choice it's permanent it's Everlasting amen it's a product of his of his perfect understanding and knowledge amen he didn't make a choice just to change his choice because he didn't know that they were going to fall into sin that doesn't make that leaves God like you and I weak and and feeble and subject to the elements and the changes all around him that's not God said I am God and I change not so none of those things matter but yet they leave us in a poor condition to bring forth the word that right yes do you agree amen that doesn't change God's mind if God saw us in the prophecy nothing's going to change that when he saw Sarah her old age her inability to conceive none of it mattered he already saw her in the promise amen and because he saw her in the promise now because it was in his mind now he's obligated himself to bring the promise to pass because his subjects can't do it Hallelujah they can't not do it the recipients of the prophecy the time of the prophecy the place of the prophecy they cannot perform the prophecy but because it was eternal in God's thinking now he's got to come on the scene and he's got to facilitate amen the performance of his word prise God because his subjects can't do it they were born in hybridization they were Fallen when they were ruined amen so if God is going to have a virgin bride yes then you know if if let's just take it this way if God is going to have a virgin bride that's going to be the Fulfillment of the prophecy like Sarah was the Fulfillment of the prophecy what will the bride have to do to perform this prophecy in herself nothing what could Sarah do what could Sarah do what strength did she have what ability what could she do to bring forth the promised son she could do nothing amen it was completely out of her hands what could Mary do to bring forth the Messiah nothing she didn't know any man it was completely out of her hands it was out of her control so when it was time God would come to the place at the appointed time and he would visit amen Mary at the appointed time amen so now God has a time and he has a place to bring forth his word and he's promised she'll be virgin but we have our dilemma because we're so messed up in our minds so he gives a little clue when Christ comes the word comes to the bride she'll be the same as he is a Virgin by the word amen when his bride comes she'll be the same product he is Virgin did Christ belong to a denomination did Jehovah neither does his bride she is part of him she needs no dgma she won't have any she'll be absolutely virgin so when he comes to his bride she won't be the nomination because because that's receiving the seed of a man is that right how many of you were in denominational Church before he came to the message how many of you believe denominational Doctrine that's the seed of a man in the womb of your spirit you've received the seed of a man what are you going to do now are you disqualified from the promise no what we can't produce he's going to come on the scene and he's going to change the condition because we were part of the prophecy from the beginning so he says she'll be absolutely virgin and then he says how I highlighted this how I want to know how tell me how how I who believed all this false Doctrine I who did all these horrible things how am I going to be virgin he said how by the word not by your efforts not by your cleaning up programs not by your self-righteousness not by legalism how it's going to be by the word it's something you can't do just like it's something Sarah can't do it's something he has has to do says amen she'll punctuate every word of God say amen amen be it unto me according to Thy word amen oh my there you are punctuate God's word have a virgin wound what will she come out of a virgin wound the word what did Jesus come out of a virgin wound am which is what the word amen again in spoken word he says now this body is to do the same because the body is head and body is together that's right right if Christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same thing that his head was that right and a Church of God born of the word of God uh born of the word virgin born from the word not denominational now virgin born from the word amen now we're getting into the true true New Birth because it's going to take a true New Birth Amen on the inside of you Amen to bring you into a virgin condition amen because the original your original birth and everything that goes with it is so corrupted and so polluted it can't be used by God so God is going to bring a spiritual birth to bring forth a spiritual seed let's go to Ephesians 5 Ephesians 5:25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word how is he going to sanctify and cleanse his wife by the word when we when we read this scripture when we get to the end verse 32 he says this this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church it's like he's talking about marriages but he's really talking about Christ and the church right so husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish God is going to present to himself oh yeah amen how because he's going to wash her by the washing of the water of the word he's going to purify her by the word he's going to cleanse her by the word he's going to whatever her condition is he is going to change her condition by the word yes amen amen what is she going to have to do to have this change in her life there's only one thing that she has to do and it's the same thing Mary did all she can do is surrender to it and say be it unto me according to your word amen in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ the prophet says what is sin he says sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in God which is the word pure unadultered oh Hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments Washed by the Water of the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you and you are washed in bleeding word he says what do you mean the word bled for me if you go back to John 1:14 he said the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us when was that it's referring to Jesus Christ the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God Amen that was Christ amen the word was made flesh and dwell Among Us that was Christ when the word was made flesh and dwell Among Us it was then taken crucified nailed to a cross and that word bled which which word was it what part of the word it was the fullness of the word nailed to the cross so the full measure of the word bled for you and died for you and so now when you come to the fresh kill of the word what is the fresh kill of the word the fresh kill of the word is where there's fresh blood amen the fresh blood is with the fresh kill and in our day there's a fresh outpouring of the spirit of God because there's a there's a the full measure of the word that was crucified has returned to the church with the blood the spirit the life amen to do the cleansing work in US you cannot separate the spirit and the word amen you can't say I want the spirit but I don't want the word amen the spirit comes with the word amen it's the bleeding word the blood represents the life the word is the word the word and the blood come together that's where the Eagles get get it in the fresh kill amen he says same quote invisible Union your garments Washed by the Water of the bleeding word the word became blood the word bled for you you are washed in bleeding word the word bleeding the life of God in the word and the Word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and cleaned and Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stay on God and on his word yes amen amen I I was subject to those worlds I was subject to denomination I was subject to all of these things I was in it I believed it I had agreement with it I participated in the things of the world I did all of that and God knew the condition I was in but he also knew who I was in Prophecy he knew who you were in Prophecy and he knew how you came in hybridization he knew how darkened your mind was and how alienated you were in your mind so God came down Amen in the seven Church age he came down and and he he dwelt he came through a body of Flesh of a prophet to begin to bring us the word that will wash us Amen to do what to bring us back to a virgin condition Amen to bring us back to what we were when in the day of Pentecost when Christ was handed a fresh clean virgin bride Untouched by man this word this fullness of the word that is restored is bringing us back to that condition to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers right to the Virgin condition that the church was once in before she was a fallen woman amen and God did it himself amen who asked for the message to come who asked God to send a prophet who asked God to fulfill the prophecy in our day he did it himself who asked God to come down as a son of man as the son of man who he did it himself who asked God uh to make me part of the promise he did it himself who asked God to predestinate me he did it himself it's all his doing amen so he came amen and he gave himself amen that he might sanctify and cleanse his bride with the washing of water of the by the word amen so that he might sanctify and purify and present to himself a bride without spot or wrinkle why because there's a purpose behind it all and the purpose is all the way back in the original purpose that God had given Adam a wife and that was so he could reproduce himself upon the earth and the same thing taking place in this day God came down amen like he did on the plains of mammory he did a mighty work not so you could say he did a mighty work what was he doing he was bringing you a word that would cleanse you and I and bring us back to our virgin condition like we were at the beginning so we can meet him and have a conception to reproduce Christ upon the Earth again that's the point of it all amen and so many times we find we get hung up in certain places we get hung up and God sent a prophet and look at all the Miracles that's beautiful but there's something else behind it there's a mystery in the mystery amen we get excited about the restoration of the gifts we get excited about the Miracles and we get excited about the the the truths being connected back together and the correct teaching that all beautiful we should get excited about all of it but don't stop there don't stop till there's a conception in your soul and Christ Is Made Alive in you and I that's the purpose from the beginning that was thed by the devil in every Church age that's what the devil has stopped amen but in this one it's not going to be stopped because God has determined amen that he's going to fulfill his promise in this day Hallelujah this is the time there's a place do you know where the place is can you say by faith this is the place this is where he's going to fulfill his promise this is why because Something's Happened to me that I cannot explain to you but something inside of me says the promise is for me he's changed me deep on the inside outside I still have problems I still have hybrid flesh I still make mistakes I still sometimes view things the wrong way way misunderstand stuff but the change didn't take place on the outside the change took place in a private meeting deep in my soul and something deep inside is changed yes brought back to a virgin condition so that this could be the place to fulfill the promise oh praise God yes thousands of years people wanted to hear this kind of preaching thousands of years they wanted to know how will God do it how will he wrap it up how will he perform his word amen think of the the hundreds of years the thousands of years the priests and the Levites would look at Genesis 3:15 and say I wonder how yeah I wonder what that'll look like I wonder where it'll be then Isaiah 7 comes along and a virgin C conce can you imagine the priest and and and all the saints they're wondering how will this be I I don't understand and then when God does it there's only a few that can receive it but look at the blessing upon the few that could receive it Hallelujah and for thousands of years we've wondered how God's going to restore Eden how is this going to come to pass how will that promised seed come forth and Friends he let us see it hallelujah we're seeing it we're witnessing it we're participants in it we're part of it by his grace we're part of it amen I don't know that we can reverence it enough I don't know that we can talk about it enough I don't know that we can preach it enough I don't know that we understand it enough I I don't know we got to give our whole lives our whole beings and everything we are to this Revelation this is the point this is the time Amen in the place you know the prophet said God had one plan one purpose one goal one thing he wanted to achieve and all the characters in the Bible have been typing it and showing it and all the Bible is showing this one plan and that plan has three parts to it the first thing that unfolds is God wants preeminence in a man because he lost it in Adam so now he's going to get it in another son and he did that in Christ Jesus and the second is to get preeminence in the people he's doing that now right now now is the second fold of the three-fold plan the hidden Mystery that was in God the Eternal purpose that he purposed the reason he wrote a Bible the reason he did everything the second part is unfolding now the great desire he had above all other desires is unfolding now amen oh there's no way we get it like we should get it but I want to I want it to be more of a reality this is the Revelation that changes our life this is the re you talk about changing conduct amen you could preach all kinds of you shouldn't wear this and you shouldn't do this and you shouldn't do this and this and that and you can tie together with scriptures and you use all kinds of quotes but I'm telling you the thing that'll change you is when you realize I'm part of this Revelation it'll change every desire in your body even when you do wrong you didn't want to and you hate that you did and you change it quickly because your desires are changed by the washing of the water of the word bringing you back cleansing you from all the prostitute spirits and The Prostitute condition and bringing you back to Virgin praise God there was there was a problem All Through the Bible of barrenness if you watch God's seed there was barrenness men Sarah was Barren it took God to fix it Rebecca was Barren it took God to fix it you realize these are women who are in the lineage of Christ these are women who are part of the prophecy these are the women who the word has to come through no options it's got to come from Sarah nobody else it's got to come from Isaac's wife no one else you understand Sarah could not produce Isaac but God came down yes Rebecca could not produce Jacob but God came on the scene Rachel could not produce Joseph but God showed up amen here I am even I was I was writing down a few of them even manoah's wife Samson's mother mother was Barren you know what every one of these women produced a Christ type amen a foreshadow of Christ a promise of God coming on the scene and none of them could do it in their own strength you read through the Bible and the Bible says Rejoice thou Baron amen Rejoice that baren and those that bear not amen Rejoice praise God because many are the seed amen many are the seed of the unrighteous amen more so than the right why because God's only looking for what he wants to produce in your life amen you can look and and so there's the unrighteous there's the bond women out there there's all these denominations they can outwork US 10 to one you talk about good deeds and loving your neighbor and feeding the poor and sending out Bibles I mean you look at they can produce produce produce produce but God doesn't want that production he wants his seed amen he wants his word coming to manifestation that's the seed he's looking for I believe God I believe God protected the lineage by barrenness so that they couldn't just do what they wanted produce what they wanted they had no ability until God was ready to fulfill his word then God would come on the scene heal the barren womb and let them bring forth the promised seed you think why can't I do these Mighty works why can't I do this why can't we do what this church does why can't we do I mean these people don't even believe the word they teach Trinity Arian Doctrine what look at all that they can accomplish God doesn't want all of that he wants one thing he wants himself reproduced on the earth Rejoice Baron Hallelujah and say I only want to bring forth one thing out of the womb of my heart I only want to bring Christ that's the only thing not my ideas not my works not what I think we should do there's only one thing that I want to come out of my life and that is Christ the true seed the for this day amen Hannah couldn't produce but when God came on the scene she had Samuel a type of Christ go to the New Testament Elizabeth couldn't produce but then she had John the Baptist the word fulfilled in her day I don't want to just do a bunch of things produce a bunch of works I want to be a vessel that lays still and quiet and open and surrendered for God to come on the scene and manifest himself when he wants where he wants the way he wants think of the mockery that all these women went through you think of the shame that they bore and little did they know when they were bearing shame and they were weeping and they were grieving because they couldn't they couldn't bring forth what they desired to bring forth they couldn't manifest they couldn't manufacture the looks that they got the things they had to cont we read about it in the Bible Hannah was vexed by her husband's other wife Rachel was vexed by Leah's ability ility to produce but oh praise God they were being reserved amen they were being protected they were being saved to bring forth the word amen and the word only I thank God that's what I want to be saved for reserved for it's for the word and the word only in the in the message we come to a place where brother brandham starts to explain to us the third pool and then he gets to a place at the end of 1963 where he starts to teach about a manifestation of the third pool and uh he talks about this quite a bit at the end but he's he's referring he begins to refer back to a time that he was hunting in Indiana while he was hunting the Lord came to him and spoke to him and said uh you know speak and it'll be given to you you know something like that I don't remember exactly what was said but God comes to him and encourages him to speak the word and he says what should I say and he says well you're hunting you need squirrels and and you can speak so brother man begins to speak the spoken word and as he speaks squirrels appear one here one there then he gets satisfied when he shoot the squirrel and he goes to pick it up and he goes to leave and the angel of the Lord says but I thought you said three or however many what and we see the squirrels and that happens twice it happens once in Kentucky too once in Indiana and once in Kentucky then the third time we see this manifestation of the spoken word a third pool manifestation is when he's in brother Wright's house and and he's telling the stories of the squirrels being created and hady Wright says that's nothing but the truth and all of a sudden the spirit of God came in and brother B stood to his feet said say whatever you want it'll be given to you and she said I want the salvation of my two boys he said I give them to you in the name of the Lord It's third time then he comes to the the fall of 1963 and he has the experience in Colorado we all know up on the mountain when he's hunting and the blizzard begins to move in they were warned about it for days and it's coming in and he warns everybody to get back to Camp as soon as you see anything any pre expectation it begins the rain and sleep and snow starts to fly and he begins to head back to camp and a voice tells him go back where you were and he tells he tells in the message he says I was going back to sudden death it was death to go back into that storm but he goes back and obeys The Voice then God tells him to speak to the storm and he speaks to the storm and it does exactly what he says clouds roll back sun come out and shine until we're done hunting and all of that then he begins to walk and as he's walking the the Sun comes out and things are drying up and and and he has all these experiences now he has experienc where the Lord says why don't you walk with me and he says Lord I would love to he he looks at his hands he says I looked at my hands in in my thoughts in every way I was turned a young man again then I saw my wife standing in front of me and she was young and blackheaded then he had the encounter with the deer that would approach and wouldn't leave and then he says I give you your life and and they walk he said go off to the woods Mama take your babies and go I give you your life and they wouldn't leave they kept coming back and you see this whole experience now in these first four experiences he you see there's creation he says not even like when Jesus was on earth when he took bread and broke bread and more was created he said this was from nothing not taking something what kind of creation was that it was the same kind of creation we find in Hebrews chap 11 where the things that are made were made of things that do not appear this was God's kind of creation so we see twice creation third time is the spoken word the third pool for salvation the fourth time we see temporarily brother brenaman stepped into an Eden condition here's a redeemed Son of God with the power to control nature he says in the Lord walking with him that's restored Fellowship because God would come in the cool of the evening and walk and he says won't you walk with me so there's a fellowship a walking with the Lord he said we were walking through Virgin Timber never touched by man amen he was young his wife was young amen the the animals wouldn't leave his presence all of this shows that temporarily it stepped into an Eden condition to show us what Redemption is amen see all of that but then when we come to the fifth I've always listen to this but all of a sudden several months ago when I was meditating on it just hit me with impact the fifth was a tumor in his wife's womb it was a tumor that had grown and begin to cause her problems causing her a lot of physical problems and I began to think what is a tumor a tumor is another life yes there was another life growing in her womb a foreign life a foreign substance and it was growing and and it was threatening her health and threatening her life and it just kept growing there and and I asked then I started meditating on how did it get there well brother benam had picked up that it was there the potential was laying there years before but when did it come to life and when did it start growing it's when she disrespected her husband remember she was upset she was flustered she went and slammed the door in brother bram's face and locked the door and wouldn't open it for him she disrespected her husband and brother B went out to wash the car and remember he's praying for her and saying God forgive her she didn't mean that and brother B gives God gives him a scripture and tells him to go back in and gives her the scripture and tells her he said God didn't like that when you did that you shouldn't have done that and when she disrespected her husband who was a prophet all of a sudden this thing began to grow in her womb and it began to be more uncomfortable and it began to affect more of her life in a negative way to so much so they're debating on having surgery what should we do we're praying and praying and praying asking God what to do and should we have surgery should we delay surgery the doctors worried about it becoming malignant and all these other things that brother Ben's going through in this trial you know it's a hard trial but here he comes in November I believe it is of 63 and he's by himself in his house and all the fam's back West and he's back east in his home Jeffersonville he's praying he's lonely he's missing his family and all of a sudden he begins to pray for his wife and he begins to intercede for his wife see the one who she disrespected is the one who's standing in the gap for her and if you think about it we've disrespected Christ the whole church systems the whole world has disrespected Christ who is our Prophet who's the son of man we disrespected Christ and what happened to us something in the womb was growing a foreign life see the The Prophet's whole life symbolizes something I don't understand it all there's so many details in his life and so many things but I believe it all has purpose and it all has meaning cuz brother benam said a prophet's very life becomes the word to the people becomes a sign to the people so here his wife under the disrespect has a foreign life growing in her wound and it's threatening her life and affecting her life in a negative way and it's a hindrance and here her husband who she's offended is the one standing in the Gap and playing the role of the intercessory high priest saying Lord forgive her she's done all these things she didn't mean that she was under pressure she doesn't say a word she irons my shirt she packs my back what's he doing standing in the Gap he's the intercessor he's The Advocate amen he's playing the part of Christ and then while he's praying God says stand on your feet he stands up and he says whatever you say that's the way it'll be and brother benam says before they ever lay a hand on her the doctor ever lays a hand on her it'll be gone and that is exactly the way it happened she went to the examination that morning she got up on the table it hurt her so bad she couldn't hardly get on the table she had to have help it hurt to have a sheet touch it but but as the doctor went walking over she got a cool feeling over her body and by the time his hands touched her there was nothing there and the doctor did the examination checked the x-rays and he said that sister sister already he says ma uh your your I think he says Mrs brandham your tumor is gone I think that's more than just a story what removed the foreign life the foreign substance that was growing in the what healed his wife's womb it was the spoken word it was the spoken word amen and it was what is the spoken word brother brandom calls it the third pool amen when he tie he ties all five of these manifestations to the third pool amen because when the word came back to his hand The Sword in his hand it was the third pool the opening of the word the word back in a man's hand and God gave him permission each one of these times to speak the word as if he was God and God honored it as if it was coming from God and so now in the fifth time that you see the manifestation of the spoken word the third pool manifestation the fifth one is Grace Grace Grace amen what did she deserve she deserved what she got amen she disrespected her husband what did she get instead she got Grace when her husband would stand in the Gap and play the role of intercessor but at the appointed time what was going to remove the tumor what was going to remove the life and cleanse and heal her womb what was going to do it it was going to be the third pool spoken word when that came on the scene she was instantly healed amen and what have we received in this day it's the third pull this is the spoken word this is the word of the Lord and what's the spoken word supposed to do to you and I it's supposed to heal the womb take out the life take out the foreign life the foreign son whatever was choking our life and hindering our life and affecting our life God is here under the power of this this word to cleanse us from all the prostitutes to push out every other life form every idea of man and the masses that were growing inside of our spiritual wound that was hindering us it's been removed by the spoken word oh it's more than a story to me this has become a reality to me this is the power of the spoken word oh praise God he says it back again in spoken word is the Original Seed he says from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word amen what makes this virgin word this word that has comeing this day I I this is why I said you cannot overemphasize the Revelation the word for our day it has the power to cleanse us it has the power to remove other life it has the power to heal the wound so that we can conceive it has the power to bring us in contact with the Living God so that we have faith strength by through faith to conceive on this word to do what to reproduce the son of man again amen that's why anytime we begin to downplay the word and downplay the Revelation and downplay the seals and downplay the Thunders to me a warning Bell goes off cuz it's this third pull that has the power it's this spoken word that has the power Amen to produce this cleansing this purification it's the word that has come amen you they they they couldn't come to this place in any other age it's this age it's now it's under this ministry amen praise God Amen where else are we going to get cleansed and made a virgin it's this message where else are you going to hear the third pole amen the spoken word that'll bring a manifestation of a healing of your spiritual wound where else this message there's nothing else that's why we don't mix things in with it that's why we don't leave Parts out of it it's this message that was brought to us and it's to fullness it's entirety it's the bleeding word that cleanses us it's the spoken word that brings life it's the healing it's the restoration it's [Music] everything amen that's why we must have this message and we must preach it in its fullness we don't water it down we don't trivialize it we don't dissect it we just preach it amen this is what he brought to us and this is the purpose he brought it for brother man again in spoken word he says oh people God bless you hear me I can't believe nothing but God's word I want it to be my life everything that I am I want you to do the same let your walks your talks your moves everything you do be in the word of God Amen Let the mind of Christ come into you and that'll pregnate you with the word let what let this mind be in you which was also Al in Christ we've been hearing about it amen we heard about it on Wednesday what is it going to do it the that'll pregnate you with the word if you don't if you don't let the mind if you let the mind of denomination come in you'll be denominational pregnated if you let the mind of Christ come into you you can't deny his own word cuz he's God you be pregnated with the word and believe it I don't care if they put you out kick you out run you out and every door is closed you'll go just the same oh praise God Christ is now taking himself a bride to be pregnated with his own seed word in her wound Spirit wound in her mind and won't mix with any denominational trash with it she is Virgin to him amen what's he doing oh I just want to refer back to what I said a few minutes ago we can get hung up anywhere in this great drama that's unfolding hung up in first pole second pull hung up in Miracles and signs and wonders hung up in the ministry of a prophet hung up we can get hung up in the truth restored the loose ends tied back together in correct Doctrine and none of those things are wrong we should spend a lot of time in all of that but all of those things are supposed to produce something in this day it's supposed to bring a conception of the word in the spiritual womb of our mind and our heart to do what to reproduce Christ on the Earthen if we fail if that fails in this day then the prophecy has [Music] fail to stop along the way is not the point the point is to go all the way to the promise God by his grace by the washing of the water of the word has brought us back to be a fresh bride like we were at Pentecost like Sarah was fresh and young again but that wasn't enough right she had to get something from God himself to her personally that would give her through faith strength to conceive we've seen the Miracles we've seen the prophets Ministry we've heard the tapes we we've seen the truth restored we've seen all of that and we've seen uh ourselves even brought back out of denomination cleansed and but we need something else am we need this word that we hear this word that cleanses this word that purifies we need this word to come to life inside of us and to manifest out of us the son son of man again remember improving his word we I read it here many many times and I'm going to take time to read the lengthy version but just I'm going to take a snippet out of it said the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together it's the son of man Christ Jesus come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church in him as one the bride then she'll go home to the marriage supper she's already united we go to the wedding this is uniting time and signs amen this is the invisible Union this is all of that it's supposed to be taking place now then he goes on to say and then what does it do then this is what I'm trying to emphasize there the the he'll come down in human fles and make the word so real that it'll literally unite the two together they're United then what does it do then the marriage was supposed to produce something when God made the woman and brought her out of the man out of Adam and he brought them back together there was a purpose in that act and it wasn't so you can say look there was one now there's two no it was so there would be three four five six seven so that they would repr produce so they would reproduce another Son of God on the earth God has come down and there's not a doubt in our mind that God has come down in human flesh and made the word so real that it'll unite the Bride In Christ again and then what it'll do that's the part that I'm emphasizing that's the part that has got me totally consumed then what will it do it manifests the son of man again amen what Eve failed to do amen what the first church failed to do what Israel failed to do we you and I are commissioned we're part of the prophecy this is the day and he's got the power and he's come on the scene and he is making it come to pass but that's what has to come to pass amen amen that he has to reproduce the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing says in Christ is the mystery God revealed it's not a group it's a personal Vindication of a pregnated child of God filled with the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he don't care about nothing else and the Holy Spirit living its life pulsating through him showing the personal Vindication of the word itself expressing itself to the people and the world same message the pregnated person with the seed of God the word in there manifesting itself amen it's not just to receive the word if you'll just if if you'll allow me just to use a natural type and just follow with me the adults are here will understand Sarah received seed is that right she received seed and she received seed and she received seed and she received seed but there was no conception there was no reproduction of a life when she was made young again and they went down to Gar there's no doubt in my mind that she once again receive seed is that right right yes but there was still no conception that was going to take an invisible Union between her and God hallelujah that was going to take a visitation from God to her personally and give her the faith to recognize her part in the prophecy and give her through faith strength her herself to conceive seed and then she produced The Promised son we can sit in church and receive seed and receive seed and receive seed and listen I just just take me as your brother it can even be pleasurable and enjoyable but without a conception we can get excited about we can enjoy en Joy it it can be a pleasurable experience to receive seed but without conception the promise still hasn't come in the manifestation we need to conceive on this word amen and it's going to take a total surrender to God and it's going to take God coming to us personally amen and how will the conception take place just like it did for Sarah through faith amen we'll be sitting here receiving seed like always before but all of a sudden something will change all of the sudden it'll be like just another Sunday but all of a sudden ping something inside connects with it in a different way and all of a sudden it begins to change everything begins to change and now I'm not trying to not do this and I'm not trying to not do this and I'm not trying to be this and all of a sudden there's another life inside and it's not like I'm trying to not say that and trying not to go here and trying to not look there all of a sudden this life takes over my life and it starts to produce itself that's the conception we need on this word and marriage and divorce he says and so is it with the church that refuses to become pregnated in the age that we now live in to bring forth children of this age we are not lutherans we are not wesle neither are we Pentecostals we got to be the children of this age through the pregnancy of the word of God to bring forth a child of this age the seed child he was on to saying the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word unadulterated not touched by any man's organization any man-made Theory she'll be purely unadulterated Bride of the word amen I hope you get that out there on the air she will be the pregnated daughter of God what will the bride be not just the one who hears the bride will be the pregnated daughter of God there's got to be a pregnation amen amen amen this is what this is what is so meaningful in first Colossians to me when brother Benham goes to Christ as the mystery of God revealed he's going to begin preaching the seven seal the great mystery that was not unfolded and he goes to his opening scripture in Colossians chapter 1 and he begins to labor on this verse this great mystery which was hid even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to the Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory remember the Apostle Paul when he began this whole journey all at the beginning when he was trying to found the church on the word he says he says I'm travailing again till Christ be formed in you what was Paul's the purpose of Paul's Ministry to have Christ formed in them but they took another seed but when we come to the Fulfillment of all Paul was longing for amen what is it now amen travailing till Christ be formed in you Christ in you the hope of glory a pregnated child of God and choosing of a bride he says we find today that the modern Church a modern World Church the modern world Church church and also that the spiritual church are both pregnated to give birth to Sons one of them a denominational birth is going to be going to give one day to these to these days at the World Council of churches will produce to the world the Antichrist through a denomination that's exactly the truth I may not live to see it I believe I will but you young people remember that you heard a minister say that that'll finally wind up and what is the mark of the beast when she forms that World Council of churches and she'll give birth to her son the Antichrist the other who wants to be the other Hallelujah the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride what are you going to bring forth what are you going to bring forth the finished body what was the woman to Adam she was the finished body of Adam what will be produced in this day the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride what are you supposed to produce amen what is supposed to come from our lives bride but I am the bride I come to unite with him to receive the seed to conceive to reproduce What to reproduce Jesus Christ in the formation of his bride reproduce this age manifestation for this day Christ in you yes the hope of glory that's the prophecy this is the time amen where is the place amen amen God bless you let's all stand musicians if you could please come let's bow our heads and let's pray together Lord Jesus we have heard your word Lord and we find ourselves and ourselves so incapable of producing your word so unable we can't cleanse ourselves we we can't purify ourselves we can't equip ourselves we can't strengthen ourselves we can't conceive by ourselves we are so dependent on you Lord yes Lord but God I'm so thankful that you showed yourself so mighty on our behalf you have come in such an undeniable way like you did on the plains of memory before when you confirmed the promise to Abraham and now we as Abraham seed has received the confirmation of the promise oh but God we need that little extra something you did for Sarah we need it so bad in our lives Lord we need you to come to us Lord in this visitation Lord the private visitation that will give us strength to conceive this word to produce it in our lives dear God I pray if there's anyone here Lord who has never come to that private visitation God I pray you'd go to them now you go to them Lord we can't even tell you how to go to them we don't know it's only something between you and them only something you do privately with them but I pray you'd go to each one now and that you would Quicken them to life and that you would bring them Lord to the reality of who they are and the age they're living in and that you would give them through faith strength to conceive on this seed to reproduce you in Bride form on this Earth God how we love you for living in this day we're so blessed Lord we are so privileged and so blessed BL forgive us for our complaining forgive us for our grumbling forgive us for our negative attitudes Lord we're so happy to be here today so happy to see these things that Saints of old have longed to see prophets your Mighty prophets have longed to see this and you've allowed us Lord to see and to hear and to believe and to receive these things and not just to be hearers but to be recipients and not just a be recipient but a participant Lord that's what we're longing for for Lord all we know to do is surrender to you and let you have your way come to each of us Lord Quicken us to life produce yourself in US Lord according to the promise for this hour we thank you for this word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you brother John was a tiny simple stable all beaten and warn hardly a place for the king to be born didn't take something special to reveal his majesty so I
