pray lord thank you god for the grand privilege of being able to stand here together and worship your name for god you were desiring those that would worship in spirit and truth lord and you've called us unto that place by your grace lord you've drawn us you placed something within us before the foundation of the world that would ensure that we could respond to the call and you've placed us here lord this morning to sing your praises and we want to say thank you lord for it's a grand privilege god as we turn our hearts lord to your word i just pray that you would come lord like only you can and that you would break the bread of life god that we would see you in the breaking of bread and recognize you in the way you break the bread god that we might all be fed from your hand lord and we might go here strengthen and equip that our lives might please you lord and we might live our purpose in this life for your glory take preeminence among us take preeminence in every heart and every life may you drive away every spirit that would try to hinder may it be barred in this place may your holy ghost have free reign to move as you wish bring us up higher lord and let us see more clearly than we ever have before in jesus christ's name we pray amen and god bless you it's good to be here this morning if you could take your bibles and just turn to the book of matthew i'd like to look at a portion of scripture i want to say we appreciate your prayers praying for us while we were gone we had a very blessed time out in oregon we had a good set of meetings over the weekend and we were able to baptize sister esther the sister from california and so it was wonderful we met her and spent some time with her this evening at the communion service i'll share more of the testimony there's several details i want to go into what god had done was just amazing to me only god can move the pieces on a chess board like he does and it's just amazing when you watch him do it so i would like to share that with you tonight and uh we had a wonderful time with brother rich and sister charity cobb and their family they treated us good we just appreciate them inviting the whole family and making it possible that we could all go together this is one of the very few times in 14 years of ministry that my whole family has got to come i think this is maybe the third time and so it was a real blessing for all of us and we enjoyed that and i'm thankful for the brothers who ministered here i was able to listen to the services and i enjoyed them and also that special the sister sang on sunday was wonderful god bless you all we were getting ready we were three hours behind so i was preparing i sent a little desk in the bedroom preparing and angie turned the service on blake was finishing a song and it was coming to the special and so i quit studying and i watched the special and i enjoyed it and that made us really really homesick so that was a bad idea and so then it kept playing in the background while i was studying and then brother ben started preaching and he kept preaching i kept listening then i got on my seat and i'm standing there by the bed watching the phone's laying on the bed and i said take the phone away and she was reached what i said wait wait a minute he said a few more things i said okay take the phone away and i said well just hold on just a second so finally she got the phone out of the room so i could go back to focusing on our service but so any of you brothers that go away ministering it's a bad idea to watch the home service it makes you home sick and then you just want to see everybody but we just appreciate everybody doing their part and everybody pulling on the word and all your prayers it was a real blessing and so we're really really happy to be home again and happy to have this time together i want to remind you the communion service after this afternoon service or for this afternoon service and i'll try to remember to remind you of that again at the end of service amen let's uh read matthew chapter 1 verse 20. matthew chapter 1 and verse 20. but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us you can be seated i wanted to start with this scripture in the part that i really want to highlight is that all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet and so there were certain things that had to be done and they had to be done a certain way to fulfill prophecy and so now joseph you know with the angel visits mary and we'll get into that in a minute and gives her a commission and she receives a conception according to the word joseph now is is pondering these things pondering about putting her away privately and the angel comes to him in a dream and tells him what is going on and and telling her not to put her away but but that thing which is in hers of the holy ghost and and explaining that all of this had to be done to fulfill the scriptures and so i'd like to take a subject the lord just leading me down a thought of the unexpected fulfillment and that's always been the the trick in the fulfillment of prophecy is god always fulfills prophecy in an unexpected way and so we have to be careful to watch for the unexpected fulfillment i want to look at isaiah chapter 40 as we go into this isaiah chapter 40 and we'll start at verse 3. i'm going to read several scriptures here back to back and then we'll go in uh to the thought in isaiah 40 verse 3 the voice of him that christ in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god every valley shall be exalted every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken in now just imagine that you're reading the book of isaiah not in 2021 but imagine you're reading the book of isaiah in maybe ad-10 amen or maybe or maybe just before the birth of christ and you're reading the book of isaiah and by reading the book of isaiah he's giving a prophecy of the coming of the lord but look at a coming of a forerunner to the coming of the lord but look at the prophecy the voice of him that christ in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god amen what would you think what would you be looking for by reading the scripture if you didn't know the fulfillment we're standing here and we know the fulfillment but if you didn't know the fulfillment when you read this portion of scripture what would you be imagining in your mind what would you be looking for you would be looking for a road being built in the desert every valley shall be exalted every mountain and hill shall be made low well that makes sense because it's got to be a straight road so you've got to take down the mountains and you've got to fill in the valleys and make a straight path so you would instantly be looking for a physical fulfillment of these words and every valley shall be exalted every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight in the rough places plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it when you read that scripture not knowing the fulfillment but just reading the scripture you would be looking for something happening on a grand scale you would be looking for something massive something all flesh will see it'll be so big it'll be so mighty all the mountains will be flattened the valleys will be fed the rough place is smooth it'll be made a highway in the desert for the lord amen so he can come marching in triumphantly and all flesh shall see the glory of the lord you would be looking for something massive let's turn to malachi chapter 3. malachi chapter 3 verse 1 behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight and behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts here's another one of those prophecies that you would be looking at for the fulfillment but what would you be looking for amen you'd be looking for this to be fulfilled but how would it be fulfilled let's turn over to mark chapter 1. mark chapter 1 and verse 2. addis is as it is written in the prophets behold i send my messenger before thy face which i'll prepare the way before thee the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord and make its path straight so that's referencing both scriptures that we just spoke about in isaiah 40 also malachi 3 they're both referenced here in verse 2 and verse 3 and it says in the lord make his path straight verse 4 john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins and there went out unto him all the land of judea and they of jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins and john was clothed with camel's hair with a girdle of skin about his loins and he did eat locust and wild honey and preached saying there come one mightier than i after me the latchette of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose i indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost let's turn to luke chapter 3 and read about john as well and here luke chapter 3 verse 2. ananias and cophious a caiaphas being the high priest the word of god coming to john the son of zacharias in the wilderness and he came into all the country about jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins as it is written in the book of the words of isaias the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his path straight every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough way shall be made smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham and now also the axes laid into the root of the trees every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is shown down and cast into the fire so now when we see we've read the prophecy in isaiah 40 we've read the prophecy in malachi 3 but now we look into the new testament to the fulfillment when this forerunner came when this when this messenger came that god promised to send when we see him emerge on the scene he comes out of the wilderness wearing a a coat of camel's hair and and skins wrapped around his loins eating locust and wild honey and standing on the banks of the river and screaming for them to repent amen calling them vipers and snakes and the axes laid to the root of the tree this is the fulfillment of that prophecy and i want to read a few things brother benham said about them in god hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same this is a message that i've been studying and this is where most of this is coming from in fact i'm just repreaching christ or god hiding himself in simplicity so if you want to know what we're going to talk about just go listen to that because i've been watching this and god's drawing my attention to these things and pulling some things out for me to see and and god hiding himself in simplicity and then revealing himself in the same he says now how all this spoke when it had been for 700 years there was to be a forerunner come before the messiah but when he come on the scene in such simplicity they missed him they were all reading the prophecies they were looking forward to this coming of this forerunner that will pave the way for the coming of the lord amen and they wanted listen they all wanted him to come because they wanted to move forward in prophecy so they wanted the messenger of the covenant to come the forerunner to come because they wanted the lord to come on the scene they wanted him to come and build that highway in the desert they wanted him to come and bring the mountains low and bring the valleys up and the crooked place is straight and the rough place is smooth they wanted him to come do that so that all could see the glory of the lord they wanted it or at least they thought they wanted it so they had an imaginary way that they thought it would come to pass and they were looking i mean they were looking for the fulfillment to come according to their own intellectual understanding by being able to read words they read words and envisioned in their mind the fulfillment of those words amen but when god sent the fulfillment of those same words it didn't match the vision of their intellectual mind it was far away from what they thought in 1961 in the message serves we would see jesus said in john the baptist the elijah that was coming that he would be some great fellow because the mountains would skip like rams and the leaves would clap their hands and the high places made low and the low places high well they expected some great outstanding something to shake the nation but when he come what was he he was a man with a piece of sheepskin draped around and with beard all over his face lives off of locust and wild honey come forth preaching on the money banks of jordan and shaking the churches to repentance they didn't want to come to repentance they just wanted the lord to come and set up his kingdom they just wanted all the the blessings and the good things associated with the fulfillment of prophecy amen they didn't they didn't realize that this calling of repentance was the preparation for the coming of the lord and again in god hiding himself in simplicity he says what did happen an old whiskered guy like that with no education at all with a piece of sheepskin wrapped around him come stumbling out of the wilderness of judea saying repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand and you bunch of snakes don't you think to say i belong to a certain organization god's able these stones to rise children to abraham see brother branham is now he's coming he's coming after getting caught up into the constellation of seven angels and told to go back for the revelation of the seven seals and so now he's come back and he's come to the first service in a series of services where he's going to be preaching on the seven seals and this first service he comes to is god hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same and brother ma'am it starts off by doing a dedication service because they just did a a remodel to the tabernacle and expanded it so he explains all of that he says now he goes i don't have time to get into those seals i'm just going to take this little message here but it'll tie right in it'll tie right in he said now watch it it'll tie right in and so brother branham says i'm not preaching yet on the seals i'm just preaching this i'm just preaching this because of the dedication i don't have time but it'll tie right in so you you've got to understand that the prophet his steps were ordered of the lord amen what he preached when he preached the order he preached it and how he preached it it all matters and here he comes at the very beginning of preaching the seals he starts with god hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same so we see i just i like this title i could just preach on this title because we understand that god hides himself in simplicity absolutely god hides himself in simplicity but he reveals himself in the same so it's not just hidden in simplicity it's revealed in simplicity so you can say god's hidden in simplicity but god doesn't want to stay hidden in the simplicity he wants to be revealed through the simplicity so the whole point is for god to bring the revelation of his word not to keep it hidden he hid it in simplicity so that he could reveal it through simplicity so that only the predestinated seed would catch it revealed through simplicity and everybody else would miss it but it's not just to be hidden in simplicity is to be revealed in the same now he's he's here preaching about john the baptist showing up he's he's hauling repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand says you bunch of snakes don't you think to say i belong to a certain organization god's able to these stones to rise children and abraham they said my well that's not him there we know that's not him but it was him see he was making the path clean there's when the rough places was made plain there's when the high places was brought down don't you think you got abraham to your father don't begin to tell me that kind of stuff because god's able these stones to rise children to abraham the high places were brought down oh my that's it yes see the difference he said that's what would take place and when they come they thought oh my they was just ready to receive him if he would come to their own organization but because he came like that in such a simple way yet in interpreting the scriptures the high places was made low they didn't want to accept it but they was boy he shaved them off he shook the hide right off of them you bunch of vipers you snakes in the grass i tell you the axes laid to the root of the tree and every tree that won't bring forth fruit is cut down and cast into the lake of fire and i indeed will baptize you with water but there's coming one after me who's mightier than i he will baptize you with the holy ghost and fire and his fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge the floors of straw burn up the shaft and take the wheat to the garner that was when the rough places was made plain but the people didn't get it but it's just exactly with the word just exactly the way the word said it so simple that they missed it they missed seeing it don't you be blind see don't you be blind brother tells this story about the coming of elijah and the fulfillment of the prophecy and when he finishes that he's admonishing the people said don't you be blind now they were blind they missed it but don't you be blind what's he preaching god hiding himself in simplicity what's he going into the opening of the seals you don't don't you be blind amen this is the way god does it and so now when when when when uh uh john the baptist was standing there in the spirit of elijah preaching such a strong message ripping the hide off of the system they meant and bringing them down amen don't you think that that you have abraham to your father god's able to these stones to raise up abraham he was bringing the high places low and the low places high he was taking the crooked places and straighten them out because he says you vipers amen and and he was doing exactly what the prophecy said he would do and for us we have no problem saying amen to that because we can read it in the new testament bible we can read jesus say this was elias that was to come but if you had been there that day amen and you read these scriptures and you saw that manifestation there's only one way to take these scriptures and that manifestation and line them up together and the only way is to have direct revelation from your father because god does it in such a way that he does exactly what he said he will do but when he does exactly what he say he'll do it looks so different to an understanding you get through intellectual reading of the bible oprah on the same page so all christians have no problem saying that john the baptist fulfilled these scriptures but that's just because they can read where jesus said and the bible said that john fulfilled these scriptures if the bible hadn't said that and john came and went amen if the bible if you couldn't read in your new testament that john fulfilled those scriptures and jesus didn't say himself that he was alliance you would be sitting here and trying to add up the prophecy in isaiah 40 with the fulfillment john the baptist and he supposed amen to make a highway in the wilderness a highway in the desert for the lord he is supposed to take the mountains and bring them low and make the valleys and build them up and make the crooked places straight and the rough place is smooth amen so that all flesh will see the glory of the lord that's actually what's written and he didn't come with a shovel he'd have a bulldozer he didn't have a working crew he didn't move as far as we know any dirt but what he did is he stood out on the banks of jordan and he says you pharisees you sadducees you highfalutin come down off of your high horse amen and you simple you beggars and you prostitutes hey you're children of god too you come on up come to repentance and come to the same place you come down you come up amen come to the same what was he doing he was making a highway in the wilderness he was preparing the way of the lord by knocking what was he doing he was spiritually fulfilling what was physically spoken by isaiah the prophet and something in the people moved them to his ministry they recognized that god was there they considered him a prophet even if they didn't understand the prophecies that was being fulfilled we know that even his disciples didn't completely understand because we know john was one of his disciples and when when when when the second day after jesus was baptized amen when john the baptist pointed and to jesus said behold the lamb of god to take away the sins of the world john the disciple he left john the baptist and he started following jesus so we know he was one and we know there was two that did that and and i believe it was uh john and andrew and they turned from that ministry and started following the lamb of god but there was a day that the disciples sat down and asked jesus why do the scriptures say that elias must come first john and andrew were sitting there they had been part of that ministry that ministry that ministry pointed them to the lamb of god and they took the word of john the baptist as a forerunner pointing to the lamb of god and followed the lamb of god and still sat down and asked jesus i thought there was supposed to be more scriptures fulfilled and he said it he's already come and you didn't know it see it's going to take revelation from god a select seed upon the earth because he's going to hide it in simplicity they were looking for something huge on a huge scale and what they got was a wild man with a fuzzy face and a camel's hair coat and a leather and girdle eating locust and honey and screaming on the banks of the river and condemning them at every turn can you imagine the the pharisee who studied all his life and knew the words and knew the hebrew and and knew and knew and knew and knew and knew so much he couldn't learn and he knew so much he couldn't see he saw so much it was blind and he knew so much he couldn't learn can you imagine him listening to john calling him you viper i'm telling you god is able these stones to rise children abraham he's like what is he talking about stones the children of abraham i'm a children a child of abraham i can trace my physical leonard all the way i've got the documents i've got the i've got the certificates i've got evidence that i'm i'm a child of abraham and he's saying don't think to yourself you have abraham to your father god's able to these stones how is god going to take a rock and make a child of abraham see the intellectual mind gets so tied up amen with the language of the bible amen in the fulfillment of the scriptures what he was doing when he was knocking that high priest or those priests off of their high horse he was making the high places low and when he was calling sinners to repentance amen he was bringing the low places high he was preparing the way of the lord but it was not according to their understanding and i think we all know that that's repeated in our day the same thing has happened in the day in which we live god has hid it in simplicity but he's revealed it in the same he hid it in that man john who didn't mess with society didn't have any links to society didn't didn't have any support from the church systems he hid it in that man and that man was hiding the mystery he was he was god was hiding himself in the simplicity of that vessel the vessel was simple what was hidden was god it was the word of god coming in the manifestation but the vessel was humble and the vessel was simple and when they looked at the vessel and the mode in which he operated they couldn't expect they couldn't accept that this wonderful great thing was happening in this simple vessel because they were looking for the grand move of god and they were missing the grand move of god they were looking for what man calls big and man calls big god calls foolish let's turn to matthew chapter 11. matthew chapter 11. i want to begin reading in verse seven and as they departed jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john what went you out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind but what went you out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft clothing were in king's houses but what went you out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you and more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare the way before you here jesus is confirming that that man that you went to see is the fulfillment of that prophecy verily i say unto you among them that are born of a woman are not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets in the law prophesied until john and if you will receive it this is elias which was for to come he that hath ears to hear let him hear he's telling you if you can receive it this was elias here jesus is standing here himself and jesus himself is telling you that this is the fulfillment of the prophecy in isaiah 40 and malachi 3 this is for the fulfillment of elias and you know jesus didn't have any better reputation than john the baptist had in that day now as christians we look back and say that was him jesus said it was him it's confirmed john said it was him luke said it was him matthew said it was him jesus said it was him amen but jesus was saying that's him but in the day that he was saying it his testimony wasn't any more accepted than john the baptist testimony was accepted that's why he said if you can receive it because he knew he was speaking to a minority of the people who could actually receive what he was saying that this was elias that was for to come and because this was elias and he come that makes me what he foreran amen he said you've got to recognize what's come so you can recognize what's here and so jesus was standing here confirming that there was the forerunner's ministry had come because if that hadn't come he was here to prepare the way of the lord amen the messenger of the covenant and here he was the messenger of the covenant amen the lord himself was standing here in flesh saying if you'll receive it that was elias that was for to come okay that was elias wonderful that was elias okay that was elias what's that saying about jesus see if you could receive it if you can receive that that was elijah if you can receive that then what manifestation are you looking at now if you could receive it that was elias i just i just imagine human beings are human beings or human beings and so sometimes maybe i imagine too much you know what must have been in the and the ears of those that heard that they're like wow that was a lie wow that was elias and they're standing in front of the messenger of the covenant that he was forerunning amen and i wonder how many were still missing that this was the thing that he forerun this was the way that was prepared for him to come he's the one who walked in on that path and now he's standing here the mighty one the great one is standing there saying if you'll receive it that was elias ah i wondered i always wondered i thought maybe but now he said that's elias and jesus is waiting oh man can you believe it that was what isaiah wrote about ah that's what malachi oh that's hey elias has come but the whole point was the manifestation that was standing in front of them and now they caught that elias had come wonderful but who's standing before you see people have always been able to accept the previous dispensation but accepting the current dispensation has always been problematic he says verse 15 or verse 14 again if you will if you will receive it this is elias which was for to come he that hath ears to hear let him hear now we've said this before but every one of them had ears that could hear physical words but he's speaking about different ears because they all had ears on their head as far as we know there was nobody without an ear and as far as we know there was none among them that was deaf amen so he was talking about a different set of ears ears that can hear what he's saying not the not the vibrations that's coming off his vocal cords those can hit your natural ears and then you can get a natural understanding of natural words coming from vocal cords but he's looking for those who can hear what he's saying who can hear what he's pointing to and the message god hiding himself in simplicity again says then and watch what he he done he preached such a mighty christ coming he's got his fan in his hand he's fanning his way i mean he will thoroughly purge his floors he will he will take up the trash and sweep it out yonder and burn him that's right you take out the trash sweeping out yonder and burn it that's right he will gather up the grain and take it into the garner see he was inspired but when jesus come they was looking for and all them apostles you know they was looking for a great something to come my my boy he's coming that's all there is to it boy he will be mighty he will kick them romans off the face of the earth my he will make them greeks go this way and romans go that way when he come when he come a little humble fellow being pushed around from one side to the other what was it god hiding himself in simplicity even john the baptist in his ministry those that would accept him now as the forerunner the prophet that would come he's now preaching of jesus he says there's one that coming after me whose shoe lashes i'm not worthy done loose and his fan is in his hand and he'll thoroughly purge his threshing floor and they're like yeah yeah he's going to sweep the romans right out of here he's going to move the greeks he's going to be a mighty conqueror yes yes yes and because they were looking for a mighty warrior with a fan in the hand that would thoroughly purge his threshing floor they missed the little stoop shoulder man prophet who came walking along healing the sick and doing miracles and they missed that this was what john was speaking about because when john spoke about that they envisioned something in their mind by intellect and when he stood there before them amen they didn't correlate this is that when he come he's a little humble fella being pushed around from one side to the other they wanted a general they didn't want this little man who would hide himself and move through the crowd and and leave they didn't want this man who was being rejected and scorned and ridiculed and he would just go from place to place or leave jerusalem because they wanted to stone him and go back into galilee they didn't want that kind they were looking for the mighty one with his fan in his hand that would thoroughly purge his threshing floor they wanted their understanding of what that was he says it's got to come in their own way for their own denomination and except it does that it isn't him it's just psychology or it's the devil or it's not god because if it was god he'd have to come in their own way you see the way we've got it interpreted that's the way that jesus had to come to the pharisees it had to be that way see if god was going to send the messiah they had it all interpreted just how he must be and because he come different than it then he wasn't the messiah he was the illegitimate something he was the beelzebub but it was god hiding in simplicity so you see what the denominations do and then i'd like to say it this way you see what the denominational spirit does because if we say denominations you'll miss it because it comes so much closer to home than that we've been separated from the denominations now since the ministry of brother banham but don't forget there's a denominational spirit that's still moving that's still trying to infiltrate to penetrate to have influence because that's the spirit that he's always the antichrist has always used to derail the plan of god and to trick that trapped the people of god so he's not moving to new tactics he's still using that old denominational spirit and the denominational spirit had an intellectual interpretation of the fulfillment of the scriptures so that when jesus came now because he came different than their understanding they couldn't just leave him alone and let him preach because he came different now he couldn't be the messiah and if he's not the messiah then he must be beelzebub so that's why it's an antichrist spirit because an antichrist spirit is not a spirit that just says i don't understand that it doesn't make sense to me an antichrist spirit says that's not him that's not god that's not christ that's not the fulfillment of the word that's not the truth that's not right that's an antichrist spirit amen and so the antichrist spirit is not somebody who is just confused on the matter and somebody says i don't understand it doesn't make sense to me i don't know the denominational antichrist spirit couldn't just say i don't know he's doing a good work i don't understand maybe it's god maybe it's not i'm not sure yet let's just wait and see no the antichrist spirit said no look in the scriptures does it say anything about a prophet out of nazareth he's not it look at the scriptures where was the forerunner that made the highway in the wilderness that hasn't come yet so this isn't him [Music] when he comes he's going to thoroughly purge the threshing floor he's going to do this and do that and so they take they they take their own interpretation of the words that they have read in the book and they try to match the manifestation to their own interpretation and when the manifestation doesn't match the interpretation they reject the manifestation and call it bl's above they call it an evil spirit they call it heresy they call it a cult they call it all kinds of things and that denominational spirit is an antichrist spirit that will fight the very fulfillment of the word instead of just leaving it alone gamaliel showed a great example he said just leave it alone if it was not of god it will come to not amen but don't go out there and blast what you don't understand and so now now the the because it didn't come according to their denominational understanding now they see a manifestation but the manifestation doesn't master understanding so they attribute the manifestation to the devil instead of recognizing this is the lord this is the messenger of the covenant that was elias that was to come and this is him let's go to malachi chapter 4. malachi chapter 4 verse 5. behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse here's another prophecy laying of a forerunning of elijah and we know that this is a split prophecy in verse 6 because we know that john the baptist four ran his first coming and john the baptist did the first part of this all the way to the comma he turned the heart of the fathers to the children because they were coming to a new and living way the fulfillment of the law and christ was going to become the propitiation for their sins and they were being brought into a new and living way to enter into the holy of holies and so now he fulfilled that the turning the hearts of the fathers to the children but there's another part of the prophecy and the heart of the children to their fathers so now the children that now are going to grow up this new testament children there's going to come a time that the heart of these same children are going to be turned back to the original fathers to the original pentecostal fathers and so when you read this prophecy he says now verse 5 behold i will send you a lie to the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord so christians know that this is a prophecy that must be fulfilled and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children in the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse we read this scripture and for us by revelation it is so easy to understand we can see the fulfillment of this but just imagine reading the scripture amen for for uh 2 000 years before the coming of the prophet in this end time to fulfill this amen you have to come up with all kinds of ideas of what it means to turn the hearts of the fathers and the fathers and the children and man there's there's whole ministries and christian them out there there's whole ministries that are called the elijah ministries that are trying to restore natural fathers and natural sons they're having camps and crusades and teaching fathers how to be good dads and bring the relationship between a natural father and natural son and they believe that they're fulfilling this prophecy see what the carnal mind does and when you see the prophecy fulfilled what is the fulfillment of the prophecy it comes in such a simple vessel amen it comes in a man amen born in poverty in kentucky amen a small man of stature without much education and a seventh grade education with no political backing with no with no uh uh institutional backing with no formal education god took such a simple vessel to fulfill this prophecy and we we you know we we who have have eyes to see and ears to hear we look at the fulfillment and say absolutely that's the fulfillment but listen we see it so plain because we have eyes to see and ears to hear it's been revealed to us of the father so for us it's not a stumbling block we can look at that and say that's absolutely the truth and we've seen the manifestation of that but the manifestation came so simple it came so humble that millions and billions have had a hard time accepting that this is the fulfillment of that scripture he come in such a simple vessel but realize that that scripture was hidden in simplicity amen of a man that that when he started in the ministry couldn't read his own scriptures he would have his girlfriend stand up in church and read the scriptures now listen if you're if you're one of the big highfalutin denomination scholars i mean that's a hard pill to swallow that god is going to forerun the second coming amen he's going to send elijah before the great and dreadful day of the lord to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and this man this man that he's going to use he can't read his own bible in front of people he'll hand it to his his girlfriend and ask his girlfriend to read the scriptures and then he'll preach oh that's a that's a hard one to accept friends unless unless you have eyes to see and ears to hear and you can say that's perfect that's the way he's always worked that's the way the bible's written that's the pattern god has always used but you can see how millions would miss the manifestation of the hour because they missed the way it came it's not that god wasn't faithful to send it it wasn't that god didn't do exactly what he said he would do he he sent it the way he said he would send it he said it when he said he would send it he did exactly what he said he would do but there was such an intellectual understanding of the scripture amen that when it came it couldn't be him so they would have to say he does those things by the devil it's mental telepathy it's familiar spirits it's all of these things why because the denominational spirit amen can't accept it because of intellectual understanding and when they can't accept it when the fulfillment doesn't match their interpretation then they reject the fulfillment praise god in the message of the trial we're not preaching anything new so don't wait for the new thing we've heard all of this before but it it just becomes more real to us all the time amen it becomes more tangible it becomes more vivid amen week by week month by month and the trial says he spoke down on the river he said as john the baptist was sent forth to proclaim the coming of christ oh oh praise god i'm going to read the rest of this sentence this is this is the that pillar of fire that came down in 1933 when brother branham was baptizing the 17th person and that pillar of fire spoke listen to how brother ben repeats it this time listen to what he says he says he spoke down on the river he said as john the baptist was sent forth to proclaim the coming of christ at the end of his ministry jesus came as john was sent so will your ministry forerun the second coming of christ what did he just say amen let's not gloss over these things what did he just say he said as he's making a type he's running a parallel picture as john the baptist was sent forth to proclaim the coming of christ at the end of his ministry jesus came and as john was sent so will your ministry before run the second coming of christ so if they're a parallel if they're running on parallel tracks amen then as john the baptist 4 ran the first coming of christ so will your ministry before run the second coming but how did it work the first time amen at the end of his ministry jesus came so what will you expect the second time at the end of his ministry jesus will come brother branham's drawing a parallel he's typing the two as amen but the coming of the lord is such a mystery to the minds of people because they've take catholic dogma and they've reheated through the lutherans through the methodist through the pentecostals until they've got a vision and an image of the coming of the lord that is not scriptural and because of that because of that intellectual understanding of reading the bible and coming up with their own interpretation now when he comes and fulfills the promise in our day the interpretation doesn't match the fulfillment so what do they do to the fulfillment amen they call it horrible names they say it's a false teaching and it's heresy and it's antichrist and it's a colton but as john the baptist four ran his first coming so your ministry before in a second ask john at the end of his ministry jesus came well what happens at the end of brother benham's ministry maybe the same thing maybe it's the same way maybe what that maybe what god was speaking on that pillar of fire was the truth maybe we missed it because we had our own doctrine our own denominational understanding we already had a picture in my mind and listen i don't fault anybody for having a picture in my mind i've had it all my life all my life i was taught a certain way i read the bible with a certain intellectual understanding i have my own pictures and you know what i'm finding out sometimes i still have my own pictures that god is correcting from the message and from the bible the god is still breaking down some of the wrong images that i have the wrong pictures i have in my mind because i'm taking it by intellectual reading amen and if we've learned anything this morning i hope we learn that you cannot see the fulfillment by an intellectual reading of the promise because there was no way that you could read the intellectual promise of a forerunner and look at john the baptist and say he fulfilled that how would you ever come up with that intellectually it doesn't match intellectually but by revelation spiritually it just goes like this so if we've learned anything this morning that's what i want us to learn is you can't just take bible school intellectual reading of a bible and then as the promise that will come and then come to the promise and say i understand it by the intellectual reading you only understand it by seeing the fulfillment and when you see the fulfillment that's the interpretation of the word and then god will quicken to your heart that's it that's the only way you'll see it friends amen you remember they never saw it till it was fulfilled who knew what it was going to look like who knew how he was going to fulfill it i mean who knew what what it was going to be until he does it amen and when he does it when he does it he interprets the word by bringing it to pass and when he interprets the word by bringing it to past then the father must quicken a revelation to you that this is that back to god hiding himself in simplicity he said you love him my isn't he wonderful i hope and trust that the message will produce what it was intended to do what's he talking about this message god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself this in the same he's now coming to the end of this message he said i hope and trust that the message will produce what it was intended to do that it'll get you to a place that you don't look for flowery things or some when you see god in greatness look how humble it is and then you'll see god don't look for him when elisha was back in the cave the smoke went across blood thunder lightning and all these kinds of sensations we've had blood in the face and in the hands and sensations and everything they never bothered that prophet he just laid there but he heard a still small voice what was it the word lock that in what was it elijah heard that moved him out of the cave that got him into action he heard the word what was the still small voice the word amen there was a whirlwind amen there was a fire there was a thunder none of it moved him amen but when he heard the still small voice that was the word and when he heard the word he moved but how did he move when he heard the word he took his mantle and wrapped his face in humility amen and he come out to face god because he was called by the word out of the cave and god was god gonna call you and i by the whirlwind by the fire by the by the by the earthquake or he's gonna call you by the still small voice of his word and how we'll know he called you is because you will wrap a mantle around your face and walk out of that cave with humility not pride not arrogant but humility because you'll recognize this small voice this still small voice that is the word that is god he heard a still small voice what was it the word then he covered his face and walked out see that was it remember friend don't look for great big you say god he speaks of great big things there'll come a time they'll be this that or the other great big things i hope you're catching what i'm talking about see great big things and all when this comes to pass it'll be great big like this and it'll be so humble you'll miss the whole thing and just go right on you'll look back and say well that never did come see passed right over the top and you've never even seen it see it's so it's so simple god lives in simplicity to manifest himself in greatness what makes him great because he can simplify himself mother branham now is coming to the end of god hiding himself in simplicity and he's saying i hope this message has the it says i hope it has the effect it'll produce what was in it it was intended to do so brother bram said i'm not preaching on the seals yet here but it'll tie right into it just catch he said just catch what i'm saying and at the end he says i hope this message will produce what it was intended to produce that you don't look for big flowery things that you're not looking for great big things that if we're looking for the fulfillment of the promise what promise the promise that was foreran because we're looking at brother branham's ministry and how many believe he's the forerunner he's the fulfillment of malachi 4. he's the elijah that is to come and man he's come he's in his ministry he's for running something amen and the thing that he's forerunning needs to come because like it was for john amen jesus came while john was still on earth and he's running a parallel that's why brother branham when he gets to the revelations 10 he starts talking about this mighty angel with a rainbow overhead with an open book amen he says it's none other but the angel the covenant it's none other but christ and when he looks at that he says now this coming this seventh angel which is the same as malachi 4 elijah this seventh angel will be on earth at the time of this coming which parallels john the baptist the first coming and so now brother benham is coming to god hiding himself in simplicity and here he is the forerunner amen forerunning the second coming his ministry is forerunning the second coming and he's coming to preach the seals and he's saying now listen don't look for something big what's he coming to do preach the seals amen what's he coming to do preach amen what was in those seven unknown thunders the unwritten word that was in the pyramid the rock under the rock and he's coming to that and he's saying now don't look for something big when god comes it'll be so humble that they'll miss it and go right over it that was his intended purpose of preaching god hiding himself in simplicity brother branham says he doesn't yet he doesn't yet know what those seals are and he told us day by day one of those angels would come to him and give him the revelation amen he would see it he would see what it was doing and he would write it down then after he wrote it down he would search the scriptures to find it all through the scriptures then he would come preach it that night then would happen the next day and the next day and the next day so brother branham here preaching god hiding himself in simplicity does not know what he's going to be preaching monday and tuesday and wednesday and thursday and friday and saturday and sunday he doesn't know what he's preaching but he knows the principle of god don't look for something big amen if you're going to see the fulfillment of the scripture if this ministry is for running something the something that is forerunned is going to have to come while this seventh angel is on the earth and he says don't look for something big don't look for something great amen look at elijah in the cave the earth shook under the whirlwind the rocks crashed the earthquake shook everything around him the fire burned everything off the mountain but none of that moved him that wasn't it yet but when he heard the still small voice that was the word and it was the smallest thing the quietest of the four events you had the wind the whirlwind the fire the earthquake and the voice the quietest of the four events moved the prophet the the most subtle of the four events moved the prophet the the least intense i'm speaking just carnally now not spiritually the least intense the least fearful the least physically discerned that's what moved that prophet and what was it it was the word because the fourth the fourth act the fourth dispensation was greater than the three amen greater than the fire greater than the earthquake greater than than the whirlwind greater than all of that was the word because the word is greatest of all see brother benham comes now and he preaches the seals and we know how he preaches through that week and he says it's been a supernatural week he said you know he said i'm nearly he comes to the end of it he said i'm nearly out of my mind a man a man can only take so much he said all of this has been happening coming to me day by day and and it gets to the end and he comes to the seventh seal and he's preaching in the seventh seal and he comes down towards the end of the seventh seal and he says i better stop right there i just feel checked not to say no more about it so just remember the seventh seal the reason it was not open the reason it did not reveal it no one should know about it and i want you to know before i even knowed one word about that the vision came years ago you remember that he said i feel checked to say no more about it and he talks about no one should know about it and i want you to know before i even know one word about that the vision came years ago and he's talking about something he mentioned previously he said the vision came years ago what vision he's talking about the third pool vision that he had back in 1956 and the third pool vision he had in 1956 is where he was fishing amen and all the ministers were gathering around he was trying to catch the rainbow trout in the deep water so the rainbow trout were covenant fish the rainbow covenant fish in the deep water and he had this fishing lure and he kind of knew the techniques of fishing and the ministers were gathering around and wanting to learn how to do it and he gave it a little pull and he said that attracted the little fish amen and then he gave it another jerk which was supposed to scatter the fish and attract the big fish but he pulled too hard on the second pool and when he did he said it come out a little fish just like skin over the lure he said i caught a little one like them other brothers were catching so that second pool caught the same kind of fish all the other ministers were catching and what was the second pool it was discernment when he would tell you your name and what was wrong with you and and where you lived and what had happened in your past all of that he he said uh that when i pulled that too hard i come out and caught a little bee fish just like those other brothers were catching but he was trying to catch the rainbow trout so when he pulled too hard he got the line tangled around him amen and he was upset and the angel told him go don't get your line tangled in a time like this then he saw that he had a baby shoe and he was trying to take a giant cord and push it through the eyelid of a baby shoe and the voice said you can't teach pentecostal babies supernatural things leave them alone so whatever this is coming after the second pool the pentecostal babes can't catch it it's got to go beyond pentecostal now brother man's not talking about original pentecostal faith he's talking about the pentecostal denomination the pentecostal movement what i call pentecostalism couldn't catch it couldn't get it they couldn't catch the supernatural things leave them alone so then the next thing he's caught up in a vision and he sees a giant cathedral amen and he's up in the air and there's a cathedral there's people outside moving their way through to the prayer line and there's a little room and he's told i'll meet you in there he said this will be your third pool so the first pool you know attracted the fish the second pool caught the little fish like everybody else was catching but he was trying to catch the rainbow trout but he said coming to the third pool that third pool amen that that's the pool that was supposed to catch the rainbow trout the covenant fish the elec seed have gone what was it the third pool is the word because he goes up to sabino canyon in january of 1963 and in sabino canyon he's up there praying lord what is this all about his hands are in the air and something struck his hand and he looked it was a sword and a voice said it's the sword of the king and brother said eventually come to the conclusion that that a king the king the king not aching the king he only has one sword and that sword is his word and brother bam said so help me it's the word amen it's the word that's the third bull watch the third bull it's the same thing that pulled elijah out of the cave it's the word and it wasn't the great big fiery things it wasn't the great big showy things amen the first pull was to attract the little fish the second pool was intended to it was intended to scatter the fish to get the attention of the big fish and the third pool was the one that was supposed to hook the covenant faith and what is the third pull the third pull is the word and so what is the word the third pull is the word what is the word well it's more doctrinal teaching a better the word is christ the word is a person it's jesus christ in the beginning the word was with god the word was god we know the word was eventually made flesh and dwelt among us the word it's the person of the word jesus christ himself amen what is the third pool it's the word i mean we say that it's the word it's the word and i think sometimes referring back to intellectualism not not anything that that we mean to do but going to intellectualism we say the word like like we'll we'll hold up a bible or something and look at a page with black marks on it and there's nothing wrong with that because this is the materialized form of that word but the word is a person amen the word is the person of the word the anointed word jesus christ himself what was brother branham doing that week amen that he was preaching the seals amen he was preaching the mystery that laid under those seven thunders and then when seven thunders uttered john was about to write but he was told don't write those things so there was something that thunder and he said thundered as a voice of god something thundered that was not permitted to be written and brother banner said when the seventh seal opened nothing was written john didn't write any he said see they're connected together these two things are connected together what the seventh seal and the sealing up of the thunder so what the thunder spoke and the that became silent and not writing it and the silence under the seventh seal those two things are connected together so what was under those seven thunders the unwritten word light had never shined upon this before now the prophet of god is coming day by day not of his own accord not of his own ability but one of those messenger angels came every day and gave him the revelation and he saw it and he saw what it did and he wrote it out and then he went through the scriptures to search it out amen and then he would bring it that night then he would do it the next day then he would do it the next day what was he doing amen he was preaching the revelation of the seven seals amen that means the seven seals were breaking open and the sounding of the thunders they were opened 2000 years ago in symbol form but the interpretation of the symbols was the breaking forth of the sealed thunders and the only one that can break those seals is the lamb that's why brother branham when he's in the seals he says he he says oh i don't know which which sermon it's in either god hiding himself in simplicity or the breathe he says now if you'll watch you'll see something happening this week remember those angels he said i hope i don't have to take it right out in my hand and show it to you remember he said that i hope i don't have to take it right out then later he says i hope you've seen the mysterious part of the week what is it it's those seven angels well of course the seven angels are a mystery i mean they made up the head of christ they're angels we can't see them of course they're a mystery what were the angels doing they were coming to him day by day to give him the revelation of the broken seal showing that the lamb is the only one that can break the seal so who's the one breaking the seals who was it in march of 1963 that was breaking the seals and revealing to the prophet it was the lamb he's the only one who could do it brother brahm said it's not me don't put any man in this at all don't look to me don't even say thank you it wasn't me at all that wasn't my thinking it was them angels what was it the lamb was on the scene and he come in such simplicity it was a simple vessel with a seventh grade education with no seminary training with no big backing and he was preaching in a little brick building in jeffersonville indiana on the corner of 8th and penn street have anybody been by the building don't look for great big things don't look for flowery things in that building day after day day after day the lamb was breaking the seals brother i'm saying can you see what's going on do you see what's going on it's all around you and you've missed it around me see intellectualism will never catch it it's all around me what's around me something's here how do i it was happening all around them what the preaching of the seals it was happening all around them that week and they were missing the significance of what was taking place they were reveling in the revelation underneath those symbols that wow that ties together and that ties together and that ties together in that time wow it all ties together yes it all ties together that's what the seal means that's what the thunders uttered oh i see it now do you see it now do you see do you see it now well now yeah i see i see a white horse and his antichrist coming forth and i and i see a red horse now he's fighting in blackwood i see it i see what was in those seven thunders do you really see it because who's the one breaking the seals that's the mysterious part of the week that's what was coming in such simplicity they were missing the mighty angel had come down with an open book in his hand and the seventh angel was on earth at the time of this coming and now he was proving it by the preaching of the seals and the preaching of the seals was proving that the mighty angel has come down with an open book in his hand and brother bam said it's been going on all around you all this week have you caught the mysterious part of them week charlie remember that vision remember it's them been them angels what the angels of the mystery what the constellation want turn it to the right who is it see the mysterious part of the week was the one who was able to break the seals how many people left saying i never knew a white horse rider was an antichrist i always thought that was christ and they weren't wrong and it wasn't wrong for them to marvel in that revelation that was right and how many people were saying but did you ever notice the red horse when they went out and you notice it matches the church ages just perfectly but brother branham said there's a mystery that lays under those what is the mystery that lays out the thunders the mystery that lays over the thunders is the one who broke the seals that's the mystery laying under those seven thunders he goes now he's in the seventh seal he's preached all of this and it's just amazing to me he's preached all of this and now he comes to the seventh seal and the seventh seal he's actually not saying anything like he did the first he's saying a lot go back and read the seventh seal again brother branham is telling you what the seal is in the seventh seal he's absolutely the first time i read the seventh seal i read it with anticipation i read it with baited breath i'd gone through six seals and i understood what he was talking about i saw it tied together i saw it run down through the scripture and then i knew i knew he had went down through i think it was matthew 24 and showed that when jesus went through the six seals he left off the seven in revelation chapter eight he left off the seventh amen in revelation chapter 10 the seven thunders were sealed up and i'm like oh here it comes and i'm reading and i'm reading and i'm reading and i remember reading like i had so caught what brother bannon was showing and how the seals were open and how he showed the interpretation of those seven seals and how he tied it all the way down to the scripture and how he showed that nothing yet has been written about the seventh and i i so saw that that i get to the seventh i'm like it's coming it's coming amen the thing that wasn't written he's gonna tell us all about it and i remember my heart beating faster as i got further back in the book and he said now i feel to stop right there it was the letdown of my life i remember being so disappointed and so discouraged and then after that he just goes back and tells all the stories again do you remember what i told you in the vision what time is it sirs yeah i heard that i want to know what the seventh seal is do you remember that constellation of the angels and i went out west and come back for the interpretation you remember that do you remember the the vision i had and i had the baby shoe in my hand remember and he said i'll meet you in there and and he said you remember that will be your third pool then on sabine canyon that day and that happened he said this is your third pool so brother man i'm saying he said that was that will be your third floor foreshadowing it seven years before now seven years later he's saying this is your third pool and brother said did you see that and did you see this and you see that i don't feel to say anymore i'm like okay i mean you didn't say anything anyways but i've just went back and read the seventh seal about three times in a row in the last couple of weeks and he absolutely tells you what it is amen this opening of the seventh seal is declaring that the mighty angel has come down and the evidence that he's come down is the opening of the seals which is the preaching of the thunders proving who's here to open the seals that's the mystery that's laying under those mysterious thunders he's telling you right in the seventh seal he's telling you that this is the third pool this is what will attract the rainbow trout this is the word amen this was the unwritten word laying under that capstone lights never shined on this before it wasn't written in the bible that this is the interpretation but he's come down and took the very bible to show you what the unwritten word is and this was the opening of the seventh seal and brother banham was standing there showing you that the seventh seal was now open but remember when he got to the vision of the third pool and the vision of the thermal said this will be your third pole and you won't tell it to nobody and brother brenham said when that seventh seal opens it'll be a total secret bam said oh go back and read the seventh seal brother bam said he's he's in the 17th i think it's the seventh seal he says now it's been going on all around you and i was forbidden to tell you until the services were over i'm not praise god services are over tell me that's what he's doing in the seventh seal he's telling you but he can't come right out and tell you he said you won't explain this one he's not allowed to explain this one all he can do is demonstrate it all he can do is show it amen all he can do is rehearse the visions and tell you what's happened that week and it's been those angels and those angels came to me every day and i didn't know those things it's not a man it's not me this is the mysterious part of the week it's been going on all around you he can't tell you what it is but he can tell you what's happened because if you can see what's happened then you know what it is and he comes here to the seventh seal he says now i better stop there i'm going to read the sentence again i feel checked not to say no more so just remember the seven seal the reason it was not open the reason it did not reveal it no one should know about it and i want you to know before i even know one word about that that the vision come years ago you remember then and here it is just as these others have slides right straight into the word exactly where it was and god knows my heart i never one time thought of such a thing as that and there it was it's later than we think so those visions was the vision of the third pool you won't tell it to nobody it'll be a secret that slides right into this he said oh my just shows it's from god if it's exactly in the promises of god from the end of the message you notice notice now for the end of time message this seal he's revealed what is the seal the end of time message have we heard the end of time message that's what the seal is for the end of time message this seal he's revealed all the six seals but he don't say nothing about the seven and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely totally secret according to the bible before knowing that remember revelations 10 1-7 chapter 10 1-7 at the end of the seventh angel's message all the mysteries of god should be known we are at the end time the opening of the seventh seal did i miss something or did he tell you we're here we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seal this seal is the end of time message now listen way says now now how did i know the other day last sunday a week ago today when i was preaching on be humble be humble remember god deals in little things i didn't realize what i was really talking about and now i see it it's in such a humble way you think that something like that would be revealed to the vatican but to come just like john the baptist it comes like the birth of our lord and a stable glory to god so help me the hours at hand we're here what's he doing he's saying i didn't even know like i knew i was supposed to preach that i knew it had tied into the message but i didn't know coming here to the seventh seal i didn't know standing here that i that a week ago this sunday a week ago that i would be saying be humble be humble be humble you would think something like this what's he talking about it would be so grand that something like this it would be revealed at the vatican or it comes in such a uh or but it comes like john the baptist it comes like the birth of our lord and the stable what's he talking about he's talking about the seventh seal what's the seventh seal the coming of the lord he said you would think something like that would be preached in the vatican but no it's at this little brick church on the corner of eighth and penn street it's not preached by the pope what is it the greatest message is striking earth for the day and it's not preached in the big churches and the big halls it's a little brick building he said it comes like john the baptist what was john the baptist he didn't follow in his father's footsteps as a priest he didn't go to the seminary he didn't have backing he was a wild man out in the wilderness eating honey and when wild loki's and coming out with camel skin over saying repent amen repent and and you high places be brought down your know places be brought up what's coming the opening of the seventh seal is just like that there's two things he talks about that the seal is like it's like the coming of john the baptist and the coming of our lord in the stable what's happening maybe it's the second forerunner and the thing that he foreign maybe it come just like the first time maybe it come like john the baptist and our lord in a stable how many people were driving by that day and knew there was a church service and had no clue what was going on how many people on earth had no clue what was going on jesus was his mother was coming down amen from from nazareth coming out of galilee into into bethlehem how many people knew it she was carrying the word the messiah was within her how many people knew it it becomes such a simple humble way it come from a girl out of nazareth a mean city it didn't come like they would expect this to come a virgin shall conceive well what is our conception of a virgin it's the virgin nation because the glorious nation of israel or it must be the virgin daughter of the high priest it's always got to be something big but when the angel came he came to a little virgin that was chosen before the foundation of the world amen that was going to get water amen a little virgin girl in nazareth that nobody knew about and very few people cared anything about but the time of the promise was going to be fulfilled in her and now she was going to be carrying the word now the word was going to be in her and here she comes walking around pregnant amen and and she is the fulfillment of the prophecy but because they didn't expect the prophecy to be fulfilled that day their interpretation and the fulfillment didn't match so they reject the interpretation and start rumors and lies about how she was impregnated they she's what are they claiming listen what are the lies telling you the lies are telling you that that's some man's seed in here but that was no man's seed in her that was the the seed christ amen that was within her amen and brother benham comes to the seventh seal and he says you think something like that would be preaching the vatican but it comes like john the baptist it comes like our lord in a stable i'm telling you the same thing has happened and they've missed it god help us not to keep missing it open our eyes lord and let us see what's happening all around us amen let us recognize our day and its message let us recognize what you're doing in this hour and let us god wash away denominational understanding out of our mind wash away intellectual reading out of our mind and give us your revelation on the word eyes to see and ears to hear because we must have it in this hour it comes like john the baptist like the birth of our lord and the stable glory to god so help me the hour is at hand we're here now do you see it what a question how many of you think in the group he was talking about saw it now do you see it the truth of god's vision the seven angels bringing me from the west they were coming from the west coming back east bringing here for this message tonight see don't go intellectual on me he says those seven angels picked me up and brought me back to the east brought me here for this message tonight you see but i thought it was the angels each night you missed it each night was pointing to the seventh seal every day the revelation coming forth on the seal was pointing he says those angels brought me back for this message tonight this was the whole purpose the opening of the seventh seal it was the point of those angels visitation it was the reason i was caught up and they brought me back here for this message tonight all those six are pointing to this the revelation under each one was pointing to this they brought me here for this message tonight now the voice of that great thunder and the mission that was brought here has been revealed it's proven that it was of god just think now i knew not these seals and they've been revealed this week did anybody think of that oh those seven angels being this being the message that was coming forth them angels bring me back here for that i say thank you lord god give me eyes to see and ears to hear all that you're doing in this day let's just stand i feel to stop right there i got much more but we'll come back wednesday for that i want to stop right there remember like i said if you take anything away today if you hear anything remember that an intellectual reading of the scripture can never prepare you for the interpretation of the fulfillment of that scripture god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same god was hiding himself in the simplicity of that little preacher in that little building and that eight day meeting it was simple it was as simple as simple could be it was a little brick building in a little midwest town with a a a small of stature preacher that had no great tie-ins with any denomination or or wasn't orchestrated with many other people and in that man with limited education and ability he was in that little brick building with a bunch of regular people a bunch of average slightly above slightly below it all averages out a bunch of average people and they were all sitting there what was happening amen a tremendous event was happening amen it was god hiding himself in simplicity but revealing himself in the same it wasn't just the hiding amen it was hiding if you don't have these ears eyes to see and ears to hear but it was also the revealing if you have eyes to see and ears to hear how will i see it i'll see it and the same thing he hid it in is the same thing he'll reveal it in it's the same mechanism amen it was john the baptist that he hid that forerunner coming in but it was john the baptist that he revealed the forerunner coming in it was in the stature of a man amen that that god hid the coming of messiah it was in the stature of a human being that was born of a baby that was born in a stable amen that had a his mother had a bad reputation and a rumor about his birth amen and and he had nothing going for him in life he was simple listen we think of jesus christ and we love him and adore him amen because of what he's done for us but if you live back in that day he would have been a regular person walking down a regular road dressed in regular garb the scripture says there was nothing no beauty that we should behold him there was nothing to attract your attention to him physically but it was the still small voice attracted the attention how many people walked past jesus in his lifetime rubbed shoulders with him walked through the market with him and had no idea who he was god was hiding god was hiding the coming of the messiah in that vessel simple but he was revealing the coming of the messiah in that vessel simple god hidden and revealed in simplicity i think sometimes we make it too complicated when it's really easy it was god it was christ himself opening those seals revealing that he was here to open the seals showing that the mighty angel had come down with an open book and i say thank you god i don't need it any more complicated than that i believe it let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for this day god we thank you for eyes to see and ears to hear lord it's so marvelous to us god we know that it's by your grace lord there's nothing we've done but absolute grace that you have given us eyes to see and ears to hear god some of these things we've looked at for years for decades but by your grace you keep unfolding them to us and you make them clearer and we understand them better while we're so thankful for them we just asked lord that you would continue to give us the isab that allows us to see you in this day and god i pray that you'd help us lord to play our role to do our part to not miss what it is you're doing in this day and in this age but god may you reveal it to us by your own self would you come and reveal it to us lord and may we see may we see the promise and may we see the fulfillment match god matched in in the day of john the baptist it matched in your first coming it matched in the forerunner ministry of brother branham it matched in your second coming give us eyes to see lord all that you've done in this day god forgive us for our intellectualism forgive us for our wrong pictures and our wrong ideas i pray god that you'd wash it all away from us now and god that we could have your mind on everything and not rely on a past understanding but we be able to take lord the message you've given us which is the correct interpretation of the word and may it lord illuminate us afresh lord that we might see your word as you intended it for this day god allow that to happen for each one of us for we love you and we want to see you here we want to see you now we want to understand you in the day that we live in grant it to us father may we serve you with all of our lives and may you get glory in our lives we love you and ask your blessing in jesus christ's name amen god bless you friends i just want to remind you that we have communion service today so let's come back here at 4 pm and for the communion service amen the song brother it was a tiny simple stable all beating
