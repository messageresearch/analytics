[0:00] prove me he he he didn't say just you
[0:03] know set it home and you know if you
[0:05] feel like it come down and throw
[0:06] something in the bucket no he say
[0:08] improve me he says don't come in our day
[0:11] don't come and set in a message church
[0:13] and get lost in the crowds I wrote in my
[0:15] Bible back in the 80s I think it was uh
[0:19] inside one of my Bibles and it says
[0:21] there's safety and numbers because I
[0:23] just really felt like I could go and
[0:25] just set and and no one would see me
[0:28] right but we're we're way pass that amen
[0:31] and so we we have to come into the body
[0:35] and we have to expect God to prove who
[0:38] he says we are amen amen I I want that I
[0:44] I you know I don't want a boyfriend
[0:45] girlfriend relationship I want to make
[0:48] love to Jesus Christ right and so he has
[0:52] to know that we are all in amen and you
[0:56] know how he proves that is when he pulls
[0:58] you through the fiery trials
[1:00] because you you come down and you're
[1:02] just emptied out and you can't go any
[1:05] farther and you say blessed be the name
[1:07] of the Lord right I'll never leave you
[1:10] and I'll never forsake you and so he
[1:12] says and prove me now here with sayeth
[1:16] the Lord of hosts if I will not open up
[1:19] the windows of Heaven Amen in our day he
[1:23] has opened the windows of Heaven of this
[1:26] word and and we still see overt
[1:29] Supernatural right praise the Lord but I
[1:32] think in the last year or so I've seen
[1:34] more Supernatural coming to pass of the
[1:38] word in our life in our attitudes in our
[1:41] relationships than I've ever seen amen
[1:45] amen the ministry coming into the pulpit
[1:47] and speaking back the very things that
[1:49] you're thinking on or you've prayed
[1:52] about right that's a supernatural God
[1:55] that's the spirit of discernment that's
[1:57] the Holy Ghost right Hallelujah
[2:01] if I will not open up the windows of
[2:03] Heaven no one should be
[2:07] sad no one should be down oh why isn't
[2:11] God moving fast enough oh he is he's
[2:14] just waiting for us to stop saying that
[2:17] right amen
[2:19] hallelujah and pour you out a blessing
[2:23] that you shall
[2:25] not be room enough to receive it God
[2:29] Amen
[2:31] right amen we're not talking money right
[2:35] we're talking about you being so in love
[2:39] with Jesus Christ that every word he
[2:41] speaks you say it is
[2:44] written that's thus sayth the Lord amen
[2:47] and then you wait on on the outpouring
[2:51] of that word it it's even the word comes
[2:55] and and it it it it it forms and creates
[2:58] the atmosphere in your house so that
[3:00] when you even your language changes to
[3:03] where when you're when you're speaking
[3:05] to the family then it's it's it's like
[3:08] you you're you're creating the outcome
[3:10] prise oh Hallelujah because after all
[3:14] we're little
[3:15] messes praise the Lord
