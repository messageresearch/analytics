[0:00] we have to have the first principles you
[0:01] have to start with the foundation
[0:03] without any foundation the house will
[0:05] crumble but there is a need to go
[0:08] further there's an there's an there's
[0:10] there's a time there's an age and I
[0:12] believe that as Paul's writing this the
[0:14] church could go to two different
[0:16] direction they were to go on to
[0:18] Perfection that's God's that's the
[0:20] original intention of giving the Holy
[0:23] Ghost and the word coming to Paul now is
[0:26] the next step will the church go on to
[0:28] Perfection or or will they St will they
[0:31] fall away from their first love and
[0:33] so what what God's intention is to bring
[0:37] it back to that place he uses brother
[0:39] Branham his ministry Malachi 4 to
[0:42] restore us back to the original faith in
[0:44] order to get us to that place now now
[0:47] we're back to the original now the truth
[0:50] can be laid in so that we can go on to
[0:55] Perfection and so he says in
[0:58] verse but strong meat belongs to them
[1:02] that are of full age this word full age
[1:05] is the word Tios it means complete or
[1:09] perfect or
[1:11] maturity so let us go then the next
[1:15] verse says let us go on
[1:17] unto full age yeah let us go on to
[1:21] completion let's let us go on unto
[1:26] Perfection that's what Paul is speaking
[1:28] of so what what is going on to
[1:33] Perfection it's perfecting the emotions
[1:36] perfecting the outward things of church
[1:39] or it it what is it no it's the strong
[1:42] meat amen it's the revelation of the
[1:44] word it's not the
[1:47] milk we all need milk to start but it's
[1:50] it's the strong meat that we have to
[1:53] receive what is that strong meat that we
[1:55] have to receive what in the world did
[1:57] Paul start this Ian going to tell you
[2:00] about
[2:03] MDC think about that someone a prophet
[2:06] had to come on the scene and tell us
[2:10] about MDC because when we get the
[2:12] revelation of
[2:14] MDC that is going to bring us on to full
[2:17] age to maturity to perfection without
[2:20] the revelation of mzc there's no
[2:25] Perfection Paul's Paul is not like some
[2:28] preachers they're just
[2:30] shotgunning everything all over the
[2:32] place there's a purpose and a procedure
[2:34] and a process of why he's saying what
[2:37] he's saying and he doesn't finish it
[2:40] then he goes on in seven and he lays the
[2:43] groundwork for the prophet to pick it up
[2:45] in the last stage and say this is God on
[2:47] morpha and you know what else so are you
