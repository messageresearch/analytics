TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh god we'll make a way where there seems to be no way he works in ways we cannot see he will make [Music] me [Music] [Music] with love and strength for each [Music] he works in ways [Music] with love and strength [Music] if [Music] me [Music] and they will fall [Music] in jesus name we bless your name now we bless your names we bless your names [Music] you [Music] are true [Music] [Music] hey as brother john comes this morning let's just sing this song [Music] do you love him this morning [Music] just raise your hands [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh let's sing it again [Music] love me [Music] sure [Music] let's see it one more time [Music] ah [Music] love me [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] first lovely [Music] is [Applause] [Music] he's so good to be in his house and worship him let by our head with prayer precious heavenly father we love you because you manifested your love to us first and this morning you're gonna manifest your love by talking to us talking to our hearts telling us your secrets thank you for the songs of zion received them as a sacrifice by the testimony now provide for our daily bread father we need you more than ever it's so strange that you use a human being to speak to your bride a man is full with flow flows and things but who can go against your will father we just commit ourselves to you now so you can use us as you see fit use us as a tool to communicate your children this morning i need you more than ever and i pray all this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen thank you musicians uh we're gonna stand stay uh standing and go straight to the word of god this morning it's good to be back in the house of the lord thank you for all your prayers and anticipation you're not waiting upon a man but upon him the lord so that's wonderful um philippians chapter two um you can follow along with me also on the screen philippians chapter 2 we start with verse 5 this morning i have a thought that came a few months ago as the pastor was preaching about the relationship versus religion you remember that and yeah things start just opening and keep building on it and keep adding things to it and other ministers too that came before me they just add things to us so wonderful we always preach what somebody else preached the day we don't do that be worried all right we always repeat what was said already in the bible in the message amen so uh philippians chapter 2 verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it to not a robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in a fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross verse 9 wherefore god also had highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father may god add his blessing to the reading of the word in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated so i want to title this message the mind of jesus christ the mind of christ and with a separate subtitle of a blending time hopefully i will be able to express that the way i get i got it all right and that's the challenge right um so the mind of christ blending time so the word let that we start with if i go back and say let this mind be in you which mind the mind of jesus christ let it be in you so let is to allow allow the mind of christ to be in you give it permission you see the holy ghost is a gentleman he's asking for permission but god has already made provision for you to accept it he has made provision that for you to open because allow is uh open uh is let is open is you say let me in right you say to somebody let me in what i mean open for me right and god believes that that's your desire that's what you want to do and you want you want it he wanted so now he's just telling you because that's what god does he keeps his church by preaching to it by telling her the word give permission to it to him allow the mind of christ to come in and dwell in you is that right what a power that is given to us because we can open or we can close but god believes that we will open to him is that right and what is the mind of christ is is character is nature and if we dig deeper into the mind of christ we will find out his mind is his word is that right so open to the word of god the revelation of the word of god and never when you hear the word and never say this is too hard or too harsh the first thing we do when we hear the word of god is to say amen to it and that's how you open you open by saying i don't know how it's going to take place but i say amen to it and that's the beginning is to say amen to the word of god are you with me that's the mind of christ let it what a power that has been given to us there's a place here maybe i will read it later there is uh maybe a sister who's asking brother branham a question and but it didn't hard to refill refer to uh refer to it last time and she's asking i cannot give myself entirely to the lord why is this is that any bad spirit in man if you look at the answer from brother branham he's saying to the sister why can't you why can't you give yourself to him why can't you and you look at all the answer is explaining her how what it is to give yourself to and to christ but is not giving her an answer is actually ask her why not because all the things that if you are a girl everything you have kept pure now you're giving it to the man in whom you trust why is it hard for you to open to christ just open is something that god has left to us to do it's a power that we're giving back to him and when the mind of christ comes into us we start expressing christ we start expressing his attributes and sometimes it becomes so blurry that you cannot say was it god speaking oh my brother speaking and that's where god want us to get to where it's like blending in is it him is it brother branham or is it god now is it brother branham or now he's god it's a blending time and that's where god wants us to be because in this world christ has to be manifested in us to a point where somebody can say god came to visit me and another person would say was he really god was he was it an angel with how they describe it with wings no he was a human being but he was god was he god was he a man god want us to come to a point where people cannot distinguish between the two that's it that's what we are called to do by letting the mind of christ in us and let once he get in he cast out anything that is contrary the word of god is the light when it comes he casts out the shadow the the uh the darkness out and is a process it's a process that is takes time but as the light is coming and shines into all the region of your spiritual being the darkness now is cast out amen that's where we want to be so if there is if we're inviting the mind of christ it means we're shedding uh we're shutting the door to the mind of the antichrist enter word the spirit that is in this world we close the door the strong men get in the house the weak one get out now we want to talk a little bit about the weak one [Music] mind of god versus mind of christ versus mind of satan antichrist let's go to genesis chapter 4 verse 3 it says and in the process of time it came to pass that cane brought off the fruit of the ground and offering unto the lord and abel he also brought off the first length of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto cain and to his offering he had no respect and cain was very rough and his countenance fell now in a message of victory day preached in 1963 what about him say that seeing that the two boys saw abel and cain trying to find favor with god to come back because they know that they were just fresh from the garden of life and they had fell on the other side by the transgression of their parents and had made them subject to death just like we all stand this morning subjects to death and they wanted to know how to get back into that place where they could find life again and in doing so they they were trying to find favor with god so uh the bible say in the process of time and brother branham say it was not too long after they left the garden they felt in their heart that something is not right just like you can feel like i feel empty brother pray with me and i don't i don't feel that presence of god i used to they see that there is a distance between them and god and they want to find favors therefore they went to offer an offering to god and let me tell you that about does not know what to offer but cain thinks he knows but ever say that there is nothing good in a human being to begin with and anything that god will honor is inspired by god himself therefore he went and prayed to the lord and say god tell me what can i offer you and god gave him a revelation something beyond what he could imagine a slain lamb that's what i'm requiring it didn't make sense to him the word doesn't make sense to us sometimes it's not because i preach the word it means i understand it i don't understand it but it's the truth amen it did not make sense to evil but he said since god said it i will follow it but cain say i know exactly what you what will please you i know exactly no what will please cain know exactly what uh to offer you and uh and he went and prepare an altar and decorate it and put flowers and fruits and beautiful they say look what i did for you we know the story god give to the two believers to the two worshipers god is giving them his feedback because it can only give you honest feedback it can only tell you the truth because jesus is the way the truth and the life it could only fade through to cain and say cain can ah imagine you know if we dramatize a little bit god looking at that altar and turn a look at abel although look he said my exactly what i saw up there exactly what is father lucifer did it was in the beauty he wants to present me the beauty how can i agree with him how can my soul agree with him you know god said look at it and say that each seed shall reproduce according to its own kind that's exactly right you see this boy is actually reproducing his father how can i agree with it he gave them his feedback sometimes god give us feedback when we come to church he inspired the pastor to give us feedback sometimes he can be harsh i can sometimes i live here shake a hand with a brother and the brother will tell me tell me something like oh today was a spanking but you see him happy even though he was spanked huh my my we love it because our father cares right that's why he gave us our f the feedback is so that we know what he really want us to do we know his will and we want to apply his will i want god feedback every day in my life but some people get really rough and they stick it as personal sometimes people even can leave church because they receive god's feedback through the pastor and you see where you can trace that spirit but god is calling us this morning to receive the mind of christ cast away the mind of the antichrist god gives him feedback and it was not good it was not good ah genesis chapter 4 verse 6 and the lord said unto cain why are thou rough and why is thy countenance fallen cane i can look at your face your eyes you're so angry your countenance have fallen because i give you the feedback if thou if thou does well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou does not well sin life at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him so god is giving god is following cain after his feedback and say kane why are you rough but i'm saying he say to cain and say just do like your brother evil and i will receive you but king can not do it it's just impossible but god is saying if you do i will but it cannot just stand the revelation do you agree with me you see god is pleading with cain and telling him that sin unbelief is outside your door don't open to it open to the mind of christ the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world like your brother don't let that sin that spirit that is at your door don't open to it once you open to christ you close the door to that spirit but you don't know where that spirit can lead you it's hard to say where that spirit will lead you you will not have control over what it's going to do god plead god plead with cain god prophesy if you open to that spirit you don't know where it's going to lead you but we know what ken did you see cain the feedback to cane i wrote it down in my notes here feedback activate kane's shame it's not like you and i god tell me i want your perfect will in my life no feedback was shame in cain which shame the shame of his father when his father went to build a kingdom that was better than michael he didn't succeed he was thrown here and then you see his ambition never worked therefore the fact that god rejected his cane worship a trigger and activate that shame you and i we love god's feedback amen sometimes it's not what god god bless me with a job god bless me with this sometimes it's just god stop me from doing something that is not right you will appreciate it even more because when you look back you see how god spared your life you know do we agree amen genesis chapter 4 verse 8 and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and through him and the lord said unto cain where is ab thy brother and he say i know not am i my brother's keeper my god prophecy was fulfilled sin lay at the door don't open to it but cane open and this is what happened you see abel forgot that people walk on eggshells around the cane i'm bringing it to a drama i'm bringing to the natural what an expression walking on eggshells you guys have heard it all your life it doesn't change anything for us to learn a different language it's kind of weird but so representative is really clear you know around the cane you gotta walk like eggshells you gotta be careful don't show that you are too happy don't start singing but because he was happy evil has received forgiveness of his sins because his his sins were under the blood so he must be very happy maybe he was going around and say oh revelation is so good oh i love the revelation oh and cain said why then when you get close to me you start singing well you say that's a tantrum a child tantrum that's what we're going through cain maybe one day the pastor was preaching here and say cain and abel must have spoken about revelation and maybe that same week i had the same idea it came to me papa because we tap in the same channel is the channel we tap on it that's why we preach the same thing so yeah he must have said oh hi king don't say hi to me do you love revelation don't talk to me about them i told you don't talk to me about revelation it killed him sorry for the graphic but that's what happened then god came and god asked cain where is your brother listen what he said to him am i my brother keeper cain lacks empathy he has no empathy this is a god's son because god does not have grandchildren so abel was his son and god we dramatized want to take his body and go bury it because can't kill him left him somewhere and god acting like he did not know like a human being where is the body of my son i want to give him a burial am i my brother's keeper church what a spirit is that no wonder god say don't let that spirit in you don't let that mind in you he lacks empathy god is crying for his son but cain is what the is condescending to god i don't know this uh race of lucifer is so awful how can you stand in front of god and tell god uh you know something like you're barking at the wrong tree you didn't give me cast custody of my brother and yet you come and ask me about my brother you working with the wrong tree what courage this this person has you know is gaslighting god saying that you came to looking for something where you you didn't leave it here it's demeaning it's self-absorbing it's all about cain cain can argue with god isn't it awful genesis 4 let's continue we we just jump to verse 14. behold that has driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be head and i shall be a fugitive and the vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me and the lord say unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him now notice that cain does not repent cain does not say i did there is no accountability there is no it doesn't take any responsibility probably say something like now that i'm accused of killing my brother now that i'm accused of killing my brother i need protection you never say i did i'm so sorry it's already done but you say now i am accused for killing my brother i need some protection and dramatize it dramatize a little bit and say god say to him my children i give them the best protection there is and that's the word the revelation of the word do you want me to give you the revelation of the word cain can say i don't want to hear about revelation give me a protection like a weaponry and you know thanks things like that god say the best protection is the word and church the best protection god gave us is his word that's why the devil attacked that word daily so we ca it can take it out of our heart best protection is revealed you say it doesn't like a revelation cain isn't the message works is faith expressed in 1965 but abandoned is talking to a uh a minister talking to him about the trinity about god is only one god and but is in three functions father son and holy ghost and this man did not agree with brother branham and here is and works is faith expressed a baptist minister told me and not long ago you say i just can't accept revelation and i said then you cannot accept the bible you cannot accept christ because it's the revelation of god is god revealed in flesh therefore the whole church is built upon divine revelation are you with me church so yes the father did not accept the revelation the children did not accept the revelation but they want their own protection you see look at a strange situation that i have highlighted here cain has killed his brother cain has destroyed his relationship with god remember we talked about cain want to find favor with god right but he has destroyed his relationship with god but cain say is happy how do you know brother is his son we heard it is happy that god has given protection it will be veined 70 times you remember that so he's happy but he has killed his brother he has killed his brother if we bring it into today he has killed the influence of his brother his brother gift has been vindicated but the gift is for the whole body it could just say my gift has not been vindicated but my brother's gift god has approved it and we can see that god is using this man praise god because it's for the whole body right no he killed his brother influence showing to people not to have confidence in his brother not realizing that this is for the whole body of christ a gift is not for the person that has the gift it is for the whole body and into a gift that goes a lot of things they are scars and there is a lot of tears and pain in a gift ask a musician they will tell you that song that bless the people sometimes he's like i was in certain such situations such such pain and that song just sprung down and now when he's now uh uh god magnify that gift god show that gift to the people people don't know what goes into that and cain did not know but he killed the influence of his brother think about that you just say something to that sister who made it compose that song of that brother and just destroy him now they don't want to come up here and sing but the gift is for the whole body cain could just say well i don't have it but my brother has and brother but i'm saying that whoever has the ball we all go and protect it because it's for the team is more than for the team it is for the body it's even more than the body it is the kingdom amen amen am i too hard somebody has to say amen all right oh there's so much that goes into a ministry you know in a gift you know brother branham used to to say uh you know let me just say this there's a time where brother chad called me asking me if i can take the service and i look i was just crying a few minutes ago two three minutes five minutes i was crying honey look he just called me so god want me to be in this condition before you can use me when you feel like nothing or so your life is turning upside down so that's the time when he uses me not where i feel so like oh my i'm gonna go invade egypt so that's not the time i didn't tell him hey call me brother can you take it to service that's the way god does things when you feel your lowest that's when he can use you you know brother branham say god one day you know you read the message you listen to it but i'm saying god will change my ministry god will change my ministry it'll be something amazing i'm looking forward to it it is going to change my ministry oh my then one day he stopped and said god will not change my ministry it will change the minister because the ministry is always there it is a gift it's god but the men need to change a good disposition wow well let me keep going cane think is happy but cain is miserable now put two and two together kane is saying i'm happy i'm protected these relationships destroy oh i need nothing i'm so good oh my look at me [Laughter] but the bible says genesis chapter 3 verse 17 because thou sayest i'm rich and increase with good and have need of nothing noah's not down are rich and miserable and poor and blind and naked without protection naked without protection i counseled thee to buy of me gold trying fire the thou mice be rich and white raymond that thou might be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and i know thy eyes with the eyes of that thou might see it doesn't know that is blind is miserable but you say i'm protected i'm okay what is this is it a mental situation or a spiritual condition could that be both but i'm going to use both right is it natural or is it spiritual could that be both you see the pastor has been preaching to us showing that when you go to work actually you are expressing christ is that right is it natural is it spiritual maybe it's blending in time what you do is natural it's spiritual yeah when i was much much younger i listened to brother when i'm talking about maybe adoption he said god may call you to be a housewife in the body eat the body doesn't make sense god can call you to be a person that makes chairs really i thought in the body there are nine gifts five ministry you know but whatever i'm saying even making chairs is in the body function it just makes it does make sense now as you're living your life that's how god is being manifested his gift is just you expressing christ's mind to the world and therefore cain what is doing is display a different attribute and god is calling us this morning not to do that but he's not giving us a code of conduct is that right it's not giving us a code of conduct how to behave well is saying let the mind get in let the word in let the word in every day the darkness will be cast out i'm gonna take a lot of angle so bear with me cain's condition can luck lack empathy it doesn't it doesn't care that god is crying forever doesn't care cain is validation seeking is untitled it's always about gain it's condescending it's trying to change god's reality and say hey how can you come and look for evil here it's manipulative because we're telling god that oh you didn't give me custody yet you come asking for able here cane condition is demeaning cain cannot handle disappointment it's too much for him but in your disappointment you keep worshipping him you know you keep serving him cane atmosphere the atmosphere that cain produces causes a high level of stress people have to walk on eggshells cane is argumentative you did not give me custody and now you cain has a frightening rage i bring it to the natural could that be spiritual too well is expressing something else it's spiritual because those are not in the mind of christ christ gave life cain took life christ obey until death king cannot obey to love things such as just give this sacrifice and that will be over can live for cain cain worship king but jesus said i sanctify myself for others and he said eternal life is to live for others but look at all this condition the list is long you can find yours canes is unpredictable you don't know what can trigger a central monkey a big drama it doesn't take responsibility it has tendency of blaming somebody else he hates feedback don't tell me that my gift is not good enough but cain say there is nothing wrong with him he's doing well he's doing well yeah church i can see you you're quiet it's painful but this spirit works today it's so strange that uh the statistics say 10 to 15 of people have that and in some area it can be 50 percent with this how can you display christ it's impossible to display christ with all that listen the neighbors seen this how the neighbor will see christ oh i believe the message i i we go to church our past is wonderful yes which is true but christ is not expressed i'm painting a bad picture i am not mocking or making fun of anybody in the world that has this no i'm painting a bad picture i'm dramatizing you can see maybe i am a picture person i like the big picture all right let me ask a question i wrote here can a person display such behavior be a christian now i don't want to use my intelligence to answer that question all right i don't want to do that i want to go by the word and looking at the word i will say this person is not yet converted the love of god but they are not converted yet our prayer you and i is god to generate conversions because we have a lot of uh confessions or decisions but now we need conversion because the decision is good only when god takes it to the goddess he need revelation then that decision will be good but we have so many decisions i would lord i will do this i will serve you but this is not conversion it's all intellectual if you can pray for the body of christ ask god to send more conversion remember peter cast out devils and perform miracles but yet christ told him you are not converted yet so therefore my brother would display this is in his way to conversion he needs somebody to believe with him somebody to pray for him that god changed this intellectual cane conversion into a revelation personal revelation now i almost gave it the answer to another question after you saw the list that i had here if you ask a science because what i'm saying science will find god before you he was not talking to us but they won't do anything with it science can find the dna of jesus i'm telling you they can't if the words keep going they can build some tools that can find dna but they won't do anything they can have the blood of jesus he won't do any good science saw the cloud science saw the pillar of fire they didn't do anything right but they can find it when you ask them those psychologists and psychiatrists they will say what you have told us about cain if if a person who has those type of traits exist then that person has what is called narcissistic personality right there they would just say oh that's it that's it i said to you bear with me now there is something that is called a dsm-5 where all i'm not expert all the uh mental sickness there about 200 of them they go in this dsm-5 but when it came to this narcissistic personality psychologists psychiatrists were not too sure to put it in it was like can this be a sickness they say yes no yes reluctantly they say yeah let's put it as a mental sickness why because actually the doctor's duty is to try to ease pain is that right but this person has no pain is fully functioning the pain is inflicted to people around them therefore how can you say it needs help actually when they go to get help it's usually because they're in trouble with the law or something like that and they will drop out of that uh session with the therapist they actually will will uh charm the therapists and they will actually accuse other around them that they the one that has the sickness not themselves and they're happy only the people around them are miserable able is you know able can see the the consequence of the tantrum but cain is fine as long as i'm think seven times i'm okay and but they know that this person is sick but it's a fully functioning it's not like alzheimer's but they fully function at the reason they do everything but just the atmosphere around them is toxic and then they decided no no we're gonna ah we we're just going to to keep it as a dsm-5 we do we do have now in a message i read this before long time 1962 letting off the pressure see it's just a built-up pressure it's the age that we are living in in neurotic age where people don't know what to do where they where they are going and the doctor don't have the answer for it because the psychiatrist is being doctorate by the psychiatrist so they have not the answer well it's so good they don't have the answer because the answer is in the word of god a young sister is a newcomer sister work went to branham tabernacle and another sister of a different church was trying to show this uh newcomer that brother branham was not spiritual enough you got to understand this is a time where you know a pentecostal movement a lot of people can could pray for the sick miracles everywhere because god has us as told brother branham to bring to the world the gift of healing so he went everywhere now this is a conversation taking side with jesus here not long ago a certain sister that goes to this church was at another church where god was making everything happen and this church this sister say to the other sisters say you know that man that could pray for the sick say must have a very victorious life and say he must just be able his family and everything be healed at uh it's not for finger if but branham was spiritual enough he could when his children his wife is sick you could just say healing that's the critics now whatever i'm saying that um the same thing so that that is you see just trying to find something she was just trying to find something to this young convert to blight their name the name of the works of god see they wanted to blight it every time a child gets sick one of his children he takes them to a doctor you know what brother when i bring these children to the doctor sure i would then if the doctor can't i will ask god to help before i go there then if the doctor can do nothing about it then i will take him up a little higher huh that's right yes sir it's just the same today they are trying to find a trap somewhere i took this because if the doctors the psychiatrists the psychologist say this is not something that can be healed we don't even want to put it in a book well let's just put it so it means they can then we need to bring the better a little higher if you know anybody it's your duty as representing the the christ in this world when everybody says impossible this person by god grace can heal and express christ's mind than the mind of the world it is a challenge to god but god says somebody has to pray somebody has to believe i used to tell people somebody has to pray and i didn't have much argument i said somebody has to pray i used to tell them that even the coming of brother branham somebody had to pray and somebody people were in prayer then god gave a prophecy i will send william branham somebody has to pray now that uh brother chad get into the deep of that word and say things are directed from the earth that's my own words by the way it starts here even the redemption is here the bride is here the bridegroom is here the headquarters down now it seems to be here the cleansing of earth and heaven here and somebody has to pray about it if science say we don't know what to do that's good you go higher the principles of divine healing 1961 the principle of divine healing now the first thing a person does when they get sick maybe around home you have a few remedies and things you try the next thing is maybe you call the doctor that sensible thing to do if the doctor can do no good then you got a right to go to god that's what you should do call on god and god is the order of circumstance he can do when nothing else can do when man comes to the end of the line god can do psalm 103 bless the lord all my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord of my soul and for get not all his benefit who forgive us all thine iniquities who healeth all thy disease amen science has a limit doctors have limit god has no limit he is the lord who heals all sickness physical mental spiritual is the lord who heal the body the spirit the soul bring that matter higher amen i want to take a little how they say digress a little bit but uh maybe it will make sense uh you see the angel say to brother branham if you are sincere when you pray and get the people to believe you nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer is that right so you see when i look at it i don't know if you bother him talks about a lot i never i don't know if you made a connection but if you look at the the first bible of god is this zodiac hopefully this is clear to you you will see that the first sign of the zodiac when i look at the newspapers usually they put it like harris and then the last one they put it like sagittarius but brother branham when he look at this zodiac you say the first sign is actually the virgo the coming of the lord in the virgin is that right then he said the last sign is the leo the lion of the tribe of judah right and he say look if you look at that you will see that if you do viggo being the first you have to go round and round to get to leo is that right but he said before you get to leo you will pass through the cancer age now brother branham say the angel told him no disease will stand even cancer cancer is announced in heaven before he get to earth and god said to him even cancer will not stand are you with him and he said we are in the age of cancer and barabaram says that the in this super exhortation of divine healing he said the supernatural being that spoke to me said that talking about praying for the sick he specified one disease he said not even to cancer shall stand before the prayer there has been more cancers healed than anything else so god announces in heaven on earth cancer is coming he sends his prophet and the prophet pray more cancers than anything are healed amen praise god for that but now what happened in 1963 the souls that are in prison now everybody say could i vision when i was a little boy is the the hour is the time when them weary looking gloomy hell being created right here on earth hell on earth are you with me so that i in prison now i plead that with all my heart as we see not only somebody talking but the scripture itself bringing us to the this hour and that vision of a little boy seeing those people in that condition that was brother brennaman 14 years old when he was losing blood and now think the hell the thing that is so in hell he saw it in jcpenney the hell itself mercy has been blown out from the earth and now hell itself is here and the people lord are in hideous condition hell change the dimension come here are you with me it brought with all the demons to determine to put pressure on you to bring dog that mental condition that the doctors don't understand hell on the surface dimensions are now blending in now the same year 1963 they hear that verb so hell on earth he also see christ the head the lion the judge coming from heaven the head is coming down heaven is coming down hell is going and they're all together here what that cause distress among the nations perplexity of time up to the bride because the king has come the judge is here to claim to claim the bride is that right therefore there is no sickness that can stand i'm telling you the first pull was great it was good the second pull was great but nothing compared with the opening of the world brother bradham is not here to show the poor one first of all second paul but the world is in his people it's not the public display but yet the world is here doctors can say anything they want but if you want to open that door christ is more than able to change to transform to renew to make your son dory god amen oh i don't even know because it's not blurry where are we now are we in the case cancer age but the lion is here why is that cancer or leo what about both i don't know that's me that's me amen well luke 21 25 and there shall be sign in the sun in the moon in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's heart failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory oh my demons on earth 200 cents against the bride 200 million right against the bride oh my perplexity of time but nation see nation nation sees the coming of the lord in a cloud they should be afraid but the bride should have peace amen no more fear no more anxiety no more of those things it's a neurotic age but we are going to the age of leo praise god amen it's you god chose you yeah yeah me too i feel like you feel nobody but god say you yes he will express the mind of christ in you yes let me say this beside cancer what are the sickness you saw in the prayer line i did not do statistics but i will tell you it is about nervousness sister you are nervous you see people things are like gloomy and brother you are just nervous how many times you heard it well it makes sense when god shows something in heaven before before it happened on earth he shows it first in heaven distress perplexity of time hell on earth heaven came down and that that's why we feel that pressure if you don't feel that pressure you must feel that pressure you are a christian you should you should feel that pressure but that pressure is different from person to person family to family all kind of things are happening right now and its purpose is to stop the manifestation of sons and daughters of god right now but the devil is defeated amen shalom to the bride amen this is what the prophet said in the comforter 1561 let us go back just a few minutes and find those men who kept god's great sacred trust that that was his word now that's what we inherited is the word and in the time of strain in a time of perplexity in the time of distress in the time of perilous times they found comfort in keeping the world the world is god's comfort you want to be comfort the world when you know and can walk down even to the valley of the shadow of death and know that god says so that sets it god said so amen amen amen now in the bible we are living that adoption number two in uh 1960 and and in the bible where we're living in the last day the top of the pyramid the cross fishes which is the cancer age of the cancer age in the zodiac in the time of the coming of the leo the lion in the crapping stone that's where we live again so it's not wrong in the time of the coming of leo the lion in the clapping stone and in the days of the manifestations of the sons of god in the bible see where are we at we are right at the end where are you cancer age or leo in between we it's later than we think that's why all these demons are coming quickly because they know he's later than we say and god rely on somebody like me i shouldn't feel good about it not okay usually we just feel like we we don't measure up but he's saying just say amen to it he will do it it will make provision it's not about me it's about him amen yes the coming of the world is greater than any other pose let's bring him bring it higher yeah the situation is too bad sometimes that condition i described to you is the nature of cain but we cannot just say nature of cain because we have been made hybrid the way we came in this world was not god's plan is that right so we came in hybrid way so we can manifest some of the things even worse some of all kind of things but if we let the word of god come then the darkness will be cast out you see the bible say that the i is the light of the body the prophet is the eye of the body and the body when it's single is good it sends the light to the rest of the body the whole being has a light the revelation in you is the light that goes into all the regions of your being i'm trying just to say it i'm trying just to avoid to say all the rooms of your house i'm creating new vocabularies maybe you will pay attention the light goes into the region like the in the matthew they say galilee of the gentiles people that were living in a darkness a great light has shined that's you in it in me the light of shining a darkness gentiles stand up and shalom to the bride if i if my life has been contaminated by this spirit that's not me that's not you you gotta just shut down that door open to the mind of christ his word because how can you display christ like brother ron was saying the other time say he read psalm 69 i am hindering the works of god yeah you don't want to hinder it you actually want to display christ to the dying world but what happened is with this spirit i'm gonna just put that list here just a small list people living under that cane spirit under that atmosphere they show signs they suffer anxiety i'm not saying all anxiety comes from a bad atmosphere you understand i cannot keep cl disclaiming disclaiming i won't finish what i'm talking about but you are spiritual people you have filters yeah so people that are living under a condition like that they suffer anxiety depression ptsd post traumatic stress disorder what the the uh our uh army servicemen that's what they suffer you know after seeing all these atrocities they come home they have this ptsd like doctors say people under narcissistic uh personality influence they live and anxiety depression pst complexes and it's painful sometimes the suspicious they isolate themselves the second guessing everything they do sometimes they can't even marry the the person that looks like the one that was narcissistic in their life because they trying to get them approved and they ended up burying that person you and the person both the person of narcissistic and the person that goes through that they both did not do anything they did not look for it let's make it clear a narcissist cannot say i'm going to be narcissistic the person that under that influence don't say i want to be under that influence atmosphere so if you go through this anxiety depression and everything you just need to claim you have to claim your right in the name of the lord jesus because you must display christ and the complexes will not get you too far very far with god we know the scriptures we know the coach you didn't look for it but you can get rid of it we've got help with his word what do you do again i'm not saying i'm going to give you a code of conduct it's just like brother ben ben cebu was saying that if you fend for yourself you will produce a cane you keep repeating that you keep repeating that if you fend for yourself i'm going to do this i'm going to be a good boy yeah that's good but that doesn't help what you need is let the word let the word means i don't resist the word i say amen to the word and the work that the world will do it's hard to say what he's going to do he has the power to cast out any kind of demon yes 55 the way to have fellowship let me you know pause a little bit here and say uh if somebody said brother were you preaching psychology no no i'm preaching the word i will prove it to you actually uh i don't know psychology to tell you i i one time i was taking some computer science things and they asked me to take a class of psychology or you know human elective you know human human science as an elective maybe i took economy and introduction to psychology and i don't remember i don't remember we're front love and whatever i don't i don't even know and the wonderful lady that was teaching us she uh every time she came to the class it was just like she's uh she's mocking christians to me yeah she would just say something like we imagined things and you know then one day she came in class and she said um there is something that science does not understand you turn out the people that are always a negative they develop sickness like cancer diabetics science doesn't know the correlation amen it's in the word [Music] the atmosphere is favorable to demons it's not every diabetic or cancer whatever you have comes from a negative thought disclaimer but science doesn't know for people that have those negatives so let's listen to the prophet now in 1955 he preached a message called the way to have fellowship 1955 what brought on juvenile delinquency was parent delinquency the parent failing to take care of the children you remember a few years ago when my boy was born there has been about i think he's about 19 now i remember the doctor told my wife faye just let that kid and say it ain't going to hurt him and if a grandma comes along to pick him up and say take her take her keep her hands off of him and say he ought to be broken at six months old and now you better you know better than that sounds like a talking of a witch dog doctor instead of a real doctor and then you know what it out out hatch out so probably saying that a doctor may be a psychologist say to them when you get your kid leave them today they say even leave them put them in a different room let them cry all night if they don't have fever there is okay but i'm saying that which craft that kind of psychology is witchcraft it ouch out a bunch of neurotic and a bunch of gangsters listen god gave you that baby to love i don't care how bad you spoil it love it anyhow that's right love it if you don't love it now it will grow up in a cold home and and different it to it will seek love somewhere or something i put something in highlight can be anything it will make an outline for somewhere mother take thy baby and give it the fellowship and love now make it a part of you which it is and act like it and hug it and kiss it and love it don't be too cold with the things of the world god gave you that as a treasure raise it right amen notice that uh that's what's the matter we got away from the things of god you get away from nature then you out of the will of god so it's not psychology it's the nature the first bible of god nature pick up that baby when it's crying are you to sing some for them i was not a good singer but it worked ah and i didn't know i didn't read this it was just nature nature not psychology this child that was left crying that child will experience what is called abandonment and narcissism narcissism is they say it comes from it feeling abandoned then the child wants to fend for themself when they grow up is a defense mechanism this is where brother uh i say it again but a ben was saying you fend for yourself you will produce cain he didn't know what he was talking about he was giving me my message something it's an abandonment so they fend for themselves is the protection mechanism that's why they do all the things on people they create a toxic environment because they feel abandoned and this is not psychology this is by the brand seventh grade student right early spiritual experience 1952 i lost my my first wife and been married and lived single for five years and then my little boy was going to school and what caused me to ever to think of getting married again she made me promise when she was dying that i would not live single i uh i said billy come go home with me i was living on a boat on the river camping i couldn't stay home home wasn't home to me no more down with my mother that is gone and and with my mother-in-law and i just could not stay nowhere and some people kept billy and i went over and he was playing in his little sand pile i said billy you want to go home with daddy he turned and looked at me he say his little eyes and all eyes and say daddy where is my home church is six years old even if the garage is way you spend the night at home you will not ask daddy where is my home this child spoke like the mule the mew because brother branham had all these scars with him all this disappointment with life when god took his wife now he wants to pass it down without knowing is passing down to the next generation he doesn't want to get married and moved the kid from place to place and he is he had no home to go i didn't answer him i chalked up i turned and walked away i looked back at the little fellow i thought oh god someday if i fall into a gallows or an electric chair he turn and say daddy dad you if you had done what a mother told you to do and made it home and raised me right instead of me pulling uh being pulled about from pillar to post it would not have been this way and i begin to think maybe in her death i ought to allow her going from this world maybe she was right i was married again lovely christian woman filled with the holy ghost which is my wife today a lovely person what i read there is brother branham life of was a chaos it was an unstable life and that impact that child and bodybuilding knew that this child that has no home will develop something it could be a gangster it could be in electrical chair because of the environment i raised him nature what he was trying to do he was passing down the scars that he has scars make us who we are and god came through our scars show that he's a healer god can show that he has the redemptive power god can display his redemption through our scars but our scars are not made to pass down to the next generation or to pass it around us to people that interfere with us people that are around us must receive the the manifestation of jesus christ the mind of christ that's what we pass around that's why we passed down the children will have their own scars and all that but for us my prayer is to be a blessing to the body a blessing to anybody around me i want to display christ not the spirit amen nature it's not psychology abandonment calls a child a person to become narcissistic later on in life chaos in the family alcoholic family can cause those things even i heard that even a grandparent alcoholism can pass that to the children the grandchildren but there is also another thing that that people are talking about entitlement entitlement children that are in entitlement they may end up with the same condition always everything is like you go to the teacher and say journey my journey deserve a a why did you give a d johnny i've grown up knowing that i'm entitled to everything therefore get the order hey it's all about journey the spirit is there and all this they do it as a defense mechanism because they were abandoned they lived in the chaos or the extreme they were always untitled because we tell our children that you can be whatever you want to be that's what we say right i understand the encouragement that obstacles come you you can fight you don't give up easily but telling the child you can be anything you want come on a christian you say you will be what god has called you to be and i want to be where god wants me to be if he doesn't want me on a puppet no one minute spend there if he wanted me to do something that's where i'm going to be blessed and a blessing for others oh my i but uh is talking about the atmosphere that people create that atmosphere is the spirit inside them and god is telling us let the mind let the mind of christ be in you don't let that mind of the devil the antichrist spirit when you open to one you close to the other let the strong man inside the weak one will decrease and constantly decrease we are called to express him to the point that the world will not know who is who oh my don't you want that so i have so much to say about it but the time is running out i want to stop this subject that so i can take a normal subject next week god will oh my the other day i was talking to my daughter rebecca she came with her joe and they were packing to leave and we started talking about you know the word of god and deep things and and uh we start talking even about the dressing code how people wear their clothes and and at one point i said to her it's so strange that brother branham could say that pretty s lady only brother branham could say that so i came to church then very next sunday but a child was preaching about virtue and womanhood and you remember that womanhood and motherhood and he went through the dressing code we all know how we tap in god's mind and god wanted to show us because these things should not become familiar it's god showing us i was with you i saw the the need that you have i saw your concern and i saw all the things now i'm answering you i'm giving you my feedback through the pastor and us but a child is preaching the very next service after i spoke to my daughter he also stopped and said it's not strange brother branham can say a pretty lady just like i say how many times you heard about a child saying things like that then you can wonder when was it brother chad went so it was when but brother chad was very serious telling us think that was the holy ghost then when he used a little human it was not british it was not the holy ghost it was still the holy ghost even in the humerus oh so strange that brother branham brother brown can say pretty lady it was still him i'm not saying everything we say is god but that's where we are called to do we are called to be that line should be blurry where you don't know who is who this is so much christ that i i even your temperament god is using it your sense of humor or lack of it god uses it everything you are god uses it this to point that where is god and where is the person you see my mind that i i do some computers and many of you here the jiraiyas of the world here my mind is like i want to know when brother branham is talking and when he's not talking i want to know when jesus talks because whatever i'm saying whatever he told you it was like like the way he says it right i wanna write a a script brother where i wanna put brother branham words in black and put the jesus words in red computer program i'm telling you you can't do it it's so blurry even when he says sister you know i don't know you it's like the samaritan woman and oh you say well that's not jesus that's brother branham and then he said whatever he told you i don't even know i'm telling you it's so blurry it's a blending in time because another place he will tell you i see myself talking to the audience and i was somewhere else i see myself who was talking all the things about preparing people's mind telling them like uh netanyahu like the samaritan woman maybe he was not verbal at all where is he here or there my program will crash but that's where god wants us to be that they say is christ or is baracadima is it bird death or is christ is the manifestation that's where we're going and the devil is putting all the things that he can on our way so we can't manifest that but he's defeated oh my i i hate your pizza will get cold [Music] i still have a lot of things to say but i really wanted to finish that subject and take a more relaxed this has been a burden to me it's a burden to me maybe my personality doesn't show it it's a very important subject i want to kind of put aside because god when he show you something is for his body if somebody needs it so ah amen this is what he want us to do 1956 why are people so toast about and when christ the holy ghost comes into your heart is in your in you with your temperament is living in his own life through his own will through you hallelujah i know that sounds awful but it's right christ you're so healed you are that christ speaks the kind of words you will speak he thinks the kind of thoughts he would think through you he does the kind of works he will do through you you are yielded and resting that what a beautiful picture of a consecrated christian yielded god is working through even your temperament if you are quiet if you are more you know uh you know more talkative or whatever you consecrate your life he uses what is dedicated to him and he can think is thought to you and you can see brother branham he's just saying that just say that it's him it's not me and you see he say oh this thing is called what uh it's called you know jesus knows the name but he's using brother mind to speak it that way it sounds like his brother bread it's blurry amen ah let me uh wind down here the anointed the end time 1965 in the very day that the son of man is revealed revelation 10 1 to 7 read it when you get home the seven angels message opening up the seals what is what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separate now that's where it seems to be so hard for you to see not the son of man himself but the seven angel the seventh angel messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's let the it's it's left the shock it can't organize it it's the grain itself again you can't he was trying to show that you can't separate it's so hard to separate this the earthly angel with the heavenly angel it's so blurry it's a blending time and today is the same thing that's where god wants us to go that's where he want us to get to the relationship is so entertaining that people have hard time to separate who is who amen but what the devil has tried to do is to remove that relationship and favored compliance rather than relationship you comply you're good no compliance is not greater than relationship you see it that spirit is all over the place i don't i just cannot get into all these details people even it goes everywhere at your job in the families with friends and even the church i saw the spirit even on the pulpit sometimes many times actually i'm trying to clean it the up spirit i saw it you go in a place people don't even have the liberty to manifest their joy by listening to the word they have manufactured that for them they you cannot maybe do this i don't want to get in the details but what is it is that same spirit that uh destroyed the relationship with christ if it with the human being to put that spirit of cain it does not have to be that extreme but anything that does not exalt christ we want it to to get away to be removed from our life how do you do it by not a code of conduct but by letting the word but i i hear that i we have to let the word i have done it continue doing it it means there's still some greenness whatever there's still some shadows some darkness in some regions that's why god continue continue listening to the word continue praying let that darkness keep going because in reality sons and daughters of god have to be manifested on earth again that spirit we are not looking for a code of conduct we're looking for him to take over and go into all the region the light goes into the all the region and cast out all that lack of empathy and all those things you know i was remembering brother kyle preaching and say how can you intercede if you don't feel empathy cannot make you feel it's a demon spirit you can only intercede if you can feel the pain the situation that person is going to therefore the devil wants to actually i you know is trying to put a to stop the works of god and let him do it elsewhere i am called to manifest to express christ in this dying world but i'm used to pray i'm living in a dying world among dying people but in the shadow of death the light of shine the people that live in the shadow of death their light has come to you that light cast out all the evil all the germs all everything so god help us this morning remember not a code of conduct how to behave well but receiving the word it will do the rest you believe that it all stand as the come in as they're coming we i'm just going to read the first timothy god is doing diagnostic of this age to timothy chapter 3 verse 1. he say that this this known also that in the last days perilous times shall come you can remove the display brother if you want for men shall be lovers of own cells sounds like a psychologist talking here now you know i read it again this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boosters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful they are unthankful because they untitled unholy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fears despise of those that are good traitors haiti high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god what a diagnostic from the holy ghost yet the holy ghost say that despite all this you will display christ to the dying world or we need people we need somebody to pray about it you need the person that goes through this to surrender completely to the lord i told you about question and answer that brother branham received in 1964 brother branham i can't give over completely to jesus have i an evil spirit let me just say let me just spend the rest of the time on that you can't surrender to jesus they don't see i don't know man or woman i could not tell which it is god knows that you can't surrender to jesus why what's the matter you see but i'm returned the question if you are a woman don't you have to surrender to your husband to be a wife surrender all you are a little lady when you were married virtuous fought all your life to stay virtual virtuous but one day you found a man that you loved you were is completely the things that you've you'd fought against all your life and try to live clean and clear and virtuous now you surrender every bit of it to one man is that right you put yourself completely in his hand you are his all that you have stood for indecency and moral and everything like that now you turn over to a man because you surrender yourself to the man can't you do the same thing to jesus christ just surrender yourself that that way all that i am all my mind all my thoughts certainly you can surrender to the lord we can surrender to the lord do you agree with me amen god bless you go wait brother i give my mind [Music] fill me with your thoughts [Music] let me [Music] my i give my mind [Music] fill me with change [Music] let me live [Music] [Music] me teach me [Music] [Music] me show me your birthday [Music] like [Music] make it all brand new [Music] let me live [Music] heavenly father is burdened that you lay on my heart now is out father is hard to express what you give to your your preachers to express it to the people father i pray that you filter everything and provide to them a clear clear understanding of your thought this morning yes we may not have all kind of extreme behaviors and things but yet we still have that sticky nature in us and the more we receive your word and feed on that word a change takes place you keep growing and growing in us father and one day you mature in us and [Music] and people will look and say is it him or is christ and that's where you want to bring to us with our own ability we cannot we cannot do it father but we view everything is possible all we do we need is to relax and receive the revelation that is getting clear and clear and clear because the line of the tribe of judah has come the head of the pyramid is here the capstone is coming here to claim to unite with the rest of the body then the body is acting like the head the head and the body are blending in it's so blurry to see god help me every time i hear your word i i should say amen to it and say lord i receive your word i believe your word i receive the mind of christ you know i'm a human being i have this flesh i have this corrupted mind help me god i pray for new birth i pray for conversion we have so many decisions so many confessions we need conversion we need not this intellectual faith we need a true revelation we need birth we need children of god born by the word of god please grant it to us father we pray for anyone that can recognize recognize this spirit in themself or anywhere else god there is only one solution they had to close the other door and open the door to the mind of christ father they came here they were patient with me they received your word so grant to each and every one but what they were looking for coming here any prayer i commit them to you granted father we pray for our pastor give them a good stay where they are and and uh a trip back here whenever they come be with us as we will gather again on wednesday let your grace and mercy be upon us in jesus christ let me pray amen oh make it all brand new and change my life [Music] i just want to think you take me [Applause] [Music] teach me [Music] way [Music] and change my it's true [Music] according to [Music] to your promises i can stand secure carve upon my heart the truth according to [Music] me [Music] to your promises [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] your me is [Music] oh this is the evening time it's later than you think [Music] is [Music] all things are ready now the bright grew my ears [Music] oh this is the evening time it's later than you think [Music] all things are ready now to bring through my ears [Music] one more time this is the evening time [Music] it's later than you think [Music] [Music] here [Music] i stand in all within the presence of god [Music] [Music] sacrifice the only source of life my hope is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] and those who trust in him will find their hearts and red my hope is [Music] is [Music] amen and those who trust will find their hearts is [Music] [Music] is [Music] i stand in all within the presence of the lord [Music] the living sacrifice the only source of life [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] empty and broken i came back to him a vessel unworthy [Music] but he did not despair he started over again and i bless the day he didn't throw the clay away over and over holds me and makes me into his likeness [Music] i am and it's all because [Music] he didn't throw the clay away he is the [Music] image he wants me to stay but when i stumble and i fall in my vessel breaks he just picks up all the pieces he doesn't throw the clay away [Music] over and over he molds me and makes me into his likeness he fashions [Music] and it's all [Music] he wants me to stay [Music] he just bakes up all the pieces he doesn't throw the clay away over and over he molds me and makes me into his likeness he fashions the clay a vessel of on earth i am today and it's all because jesus he didn't throw the clay away and over and over he moves me and makes me into his life he fashions [Music] a vessel of honor [Music] to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth [Music] all through life's journey from earth to glory [Music] to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth to be like all through life's journey [Music] to be [Music] [Music] you
