good to know the master of the wind man god bless you friends while we're standing if you could take your bibles and turn to psalm chapter 1 verse 1. i'm gonna keep kind of on the same theme we've been on i can't seem to get away from it so we're just going to stick with it and i keep bouncing in my in my mind and in my understanding between solomon's kingdom that he set up in the golden age of of israel and the new jerusalem and and i just keep bouncing back and forth and so we may talk about the new jerusalem today and maybe sunday we'll be back in in the solomon's golden age but praise be to god i just see so many similarities to where we are now i see so many parallels to what's going on with us now and i just like to explore that in psalm chapter 1 verse 1 let's read blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in the law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper man let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word we thank you god that you've made a way for us to be here together that we can worship with our brothers and sisters that we can lift our voices in song and praise lord to glorify and magnify your greatness lord as we come now lord to this portion of service where we look to you to break the bread of life we pray god that you would feed us you're the great shepherd may you feed us from your hand lord may we not see a man but may the man fade out of the picture lord and may we see you coming down through a vessel of clay and ministering your word to your children maybe take that word and grow by it lord and become all that you want us to be in this day may the word bring on flesh and may that flesh be bring a manifestation in our lives that all may see in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated man as you're seated i just want to share a testimony with you i got uh two letters in the mail today and i just got them this afternoon and uh many of you remember levi yoder the amish man that ezra had met and witnessed too and who had received the message and he's over in holmes county and then annie his stepdaughter who we've been corresponding with and many of you know the saga that's been unfolding over the last year or two actually more than that more than two years with that and i've got a letter from each of them today and i want to read that to you and he's going to share a testimony because of the situation she wasn't permitted to live with her parents levi is her stepfather and then his wife is her mother and they wouldn't allow her she's 24 years old but they wouldn't allow her to go home and she asked us to pray about that she'd been praying about it and last time angie and i were there we prayed with her about that so she writes this in as a testimony she said hey brothers and sisters you have prayed me out of the prison of separation on friday august 21st 2020 at 1 pm this barrier was removed by the power of god dad met his probation officer on friday he told dad i am allowed to be here praise the lord the lord has heard each and every one of your prayers what man tries to make impossible the lord will make possible praise the lord hallelujah amen praise be to god goes on to say thank you to every one of you for praying for me may god bless you i have always believed that i will be here before my parents move into the new house i told mom like that and then she asked you think so i answered yes i will be here if you believe and do not doubt in your heart then it will come to pass praise the lord chad angie next time you come you will meet us together in our new house probably in september i can't wait to meet you once again mom and dad are in the main part of the new house and i am upstairs in my room in the new house today i am blessed to be with my parents after being separated for 11 months three weeks the good lord had a wonderful plan for me praise the lord amen god has turned her mourning into gladness then also in the in the same envelope i had a letter from brother levi this is a tremendous testimony as well but he starts off by in this portion i'm going to read starts off by saying annie is upstairs singing songs and thus cheering the atmosphere such a great blessing we are listening to the messages most every day and sometimes twice a day remember we snuck in a little uh tablet and uh we slipped it in and we we slipped in a backup battery pack and a bottom of a can of popcorn so he wouldn't get caught and so this has been a lot of fun smuggling message material into the amish community praise be to god anyways he says thus cheering the atmosphere is such a great blessing we are listening to the messages most every day and sometimes twice a day these messages are of great encouragement to us in this time of preparation the battle is on chad you have stood by me so humbly encouraging me to stay with the church stay with the church in flesh so that the spirit can witness through me i deeply appreciate you for that lately things surfaced to the point where i was invited to attend a ministerial meeting so that so that all the bishops of our churches could hear my complaint these are from three communities in ohio and two in new york in their mind this was to humble me so i would quit talking about god's word and just do and believe what they say well guess what christ won the victory said satan used my own parents to try to shut me up but all to no avail in front of approximately 10 or 12 bishops and preachers i pled my cause by god's word one preacher tried to push the cause by bringing up some things i had said concerning my faith in baptism the bible way and laying on of hands praying for the sick i was prompted by god to quote the scripture for this and telling them that i've seen the sick get healed and have experienced it on my own body numerous times god was just using this rare opportunity to witness to the blind spiritually blind after i stepped outside they counseled over the matter for several hours in the end they adjusted some of their views on the subject we had come together for and they never again mentioned my faith concerning baptism and healing praise be the god i have nothing but god's word and i need nothing else praise god praise god all ye brethren praise the god that is a wonderful wonderful testimony our brother has been his eyes have been open he's been enlightened to the message and now when he was in the face of trouble he stood upon the word and they could not fight the word praise god so i appreciate your prayers for levi no doubt that things are coming to a head i doubt that he'll be able to stay you know in that church forever for maybe not even very much longer but praise be to god there must be somebody there that's got to hear something because he's been in there longer than i expected and they keep bringing they keep bringing it around to conversations and discussions but guess what he god keeps him there and he keeps giving them the word and then they have nothing to say and i praise god it's wonderful when the word of god shuts up those who are making accusations you don't have to defend yourself you don't defile you don't argue all you have to do is quote the scriptures praise be to god amen we're still believing for his wife's healing she's still in a wheelchair and i'm just trusting god to raise her up for his glory for a manifestation that will further open the eyes of many that are blind and cause them to love the word as levi loves the word so pray for us we're going to try to head over there we weren't able to visit they've had crews some amish crews working there for several months since i believe it was may or june working on the house but he says all is getting finished now in the next week and he's inviting us to come out so pray for us as we go out and levi with his new home where he's situated is far away from everybody in his church he used to watch him they used to spy on him amen and he's in a better situation and he wants to open his house and start having bible studies inviting his friends and his family to start having bible studies so pray for us that god will make a way and whatever god once done will happen but we certainly are encouraged by that and we want to be there amen and if if there's one more soul to come out we want to be there if not we just want to testify the truth anyhow for all to hear so that everybody has a chance amen so be praying for that amen so we we read here in the book of psalm which we've read this i think a couple weeks ago a couple services ago that this man who delights in the law of the lord and meditates on his law day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper brother takes this scripture in one place and he makes this his he says this man shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water what man the one who delights in the law of the lord the one who meditates on the law day and night he says he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and brother branham injects god's fruit not the man's fruit but this man who's planted by these rivers of water shall bring forth god's fruit in in the season his leaf also shall not wither and whoso what and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper let's turn over to proverbs 11 and read one scripture over there proverbs 11 verse 30 the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life that's a big statement because we know what the tree of the life is the tree of life is christ the tree of life brings eternal life the tree of life is christ but here they're saying the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life this man who meditates on the law day and night he'll be like a tree planted by the river's water that will bring forth his fruit god's fruit in due season and his leaf shall not wither and now the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and as we speak i want to talk about the dwelling places in the new jerusalem and there's a quote that brother branham mentions here in a minute that i really want to hone in on and i want to talk about but i want to look at this tree of life because as we begin to look through the scriptures we find out that that you know we know the book of genesis in the book of revelations or book of symbols we have trees in genesis we have we have tree of life in the book of revelations and these symbolize something and god is trying to tell us something through the symbols because remember he's hidden the truth in the book amen this is a great mystery that's been through this whole bible and the whole mystery has been spelled out through the bible but it's been spelled out in mystery form so that at the end of time he could come through a prophetic gift and he could begin to reveal to us the mysteries that are laying in the book amen and part of the way he does that is by interpreting the symbols to us so we we praise god that now we see the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and you have to ask yourself how many trees of life are there amen how many trees of life are there and i would i would say it this way there is a tree of life but that tree of life i'm i'm not gonna i'm not going to even try to guess how many representations there are of that tree of life but there was one tree of life just like there is one christ but we know christ's body is many many one christ but his body is many praise god and so how many trees of life well the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life amen so praise god i don't think the bible is referring to another tree of life or that there's an alternate treat of life or that you can either have christ the tree of life or the fruit of righteousness of the the fruit of the righteous can be another tree of life so that now you have two paths to eternal life but it's the same thing in another manifestation it's the same thing in another form it's the same thing in another expression let's go to revelation 21. that's why you know i'm so thankful that god sent a messenger in this day because i grew up in church from the time i was probably two or three weeks old through my entire life i probably never missed more than two weeks worth of services in my whole life i was faithful to go to church and taught in sunday school and all the things that you normally have in church amen but but i learned the bible as symbols i learned the old testament as stories but god came and he took all those pieces that were laying there and they were disjointed and they were separated and they were they were puzzle pieces but i didn't know they were puzzle pieces and they were laying all over the table but god brought a prophet in our day to show you the picture and start putting the pieces of the puzzle together these aren't stories there's one story these aren't old testament stories amen these aren't new testament this isn't new testament history this is one story one goal one purpose god had and the whole bible is explaining one mystery one mystery purpose that he had one thing god wanted to achieve in the whole bible i so enjoyed sunday's service with brother aaron here you know i sat in my seat and just fed and fed and fed amen because it's exactly it's exactly the truth amen it's not it's not this you know genesis account here revelations account here the genesis and revelation account go right here what seed was sown there comes the fruition over here what started there comes the full manifestation at the end of the book so we don't separate these things out and we understand that god speaks to us many times in symbols and in metaphors and giving examples that that point to a greater truth and so i grew up all my life thinking that someday if i'm good and god is good to me that i'll be able to walk up to a literal tree and pluck a piece of fruit off of that little tree and eat that fruit and somehow have eternal life but then through the message i realized i can eat of that tree now i don't have to wait that tree is here that tree is available there's fruit on that tree and then we can come to the tree of life and eat of the tree of life and have eternal life i don't have to wait to go find the tree and for the the tree to be restored in a physical way amen and and and hope that someday i can get there and someday i can eat it amen i'm here i'm in in the presence of the tree and can eat of that tree it's like the new jerusalem oh i want to go to that city friends i'm in that city i'm looking at that city amen there's a reflection of that city on the earth amen and if you see the reflection you better understand the city it's an easier way to understand the city by understanding the reflection so so so many things that we put off in the future are kick down the road amen i i i don't want anybody to ever misunderstand what i'm saying when i say that because it's so easy to be misunderstood i'm not saying that i don't want a physical manifestation i want to live in that city at the end of the millennium i want amen i want in the millennial reign to see christ sit on the throne of david in a physical form that i can see in my physical form i long for that i'm looking forward to that amen but i'm not going to just sit on my heels amen and long for the day that someday i see that i'm seeing the representation of it now i'm experiencing the reality of it now amen all that is is a further unfolding of what he's doing now what he's doing now will further unfold in the millennium what he does in the millennium will further unfold amen in eternity after the millennium it's just a further expression of further unfolding of the same thing we have here today so how amen how uh how wonderful it is that god has been so good to us amen to take away sunday school stories and give us reality to take away the carrot at the end of the stick amen and all christianity is following the carrot at the end of the stick if i'm good and do good someday i'll get to eat that carrot and all christians let around amen hoping to eat the carrots someday friends amen forget it i'm eating from the tree of life amen the food is here amen the life is here christ is here praise be to god so don't take these things and shelf them over here or put them back there bring everything today amen today is the day if we experience it today amen it's a guarantee you'll experience it that day if you miss it today you'll miss it that day revelation 21 verse 9 and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to the great high mountain and showed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and it was like her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal man i was i enjoyed aaron reading that on sunday because it was already in my notes for tonight amen but but now this this angel is going to show john the lamb's wife so when john turns to see the lamb's wife he sees the city then let's go uh further to 22. and one within that city he begins to show him things that are in the city revelation 22 and 1 and he showed me a pure river of water of life clearest crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb and in the midst of the street of it on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bear 12 men are fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations so when we look at this scripture now uh we've been through this several times but in this city when he when he goes to see the lamb he sees the city when he when he when he wants to when he when he goes to see the bride of the lamb when he goes to see the lamb's wife amen he shows him the new jerusalem so the new jerusalem is an expression of the lamb's wife and the lamb's wife is an expression of the new jerusalem so the two go together why do the two go together because scripture put them together if you want to see the new jerusalem look at the lamb's wife if you want to see the lamb's wife look at the new jerusalem amen they're the expression of the same thing praise god so now now with that in mind let's let's keep looking at this subject brother bam says in the future home the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride he said oh holy mountain there will be streets of transparent gold avenues and houses and parks if you want to read this revelation 21 18 the tree of life will be there 12 different manners of fruit one each month will be born on it the people that eat these fruits they'll change their diet every month now if you look in the scripture and when it talks about this in verse 2 it said in the midst of the street on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month so this tree is referred to in the feminine but we know that the tree of life is christ but here it's referred to in the feminine amen because christ also has a feminine side christ is known as masculine and feminine amen so brother bram says all the way back in 1957 and questions and answers on hebrews he says there's even a tree in there and the tree on either side bears 12 man or a fruit and they yield their fruit once a month which is 12 months in the year they rent they render 12 manner of fruit every year as it goes by 12 is that worship number you see so he says there's 12 men or a few there's 12 months in the year and 12 is a worship number amen and we realize that the term worship amen is not the same term as praise praise means to shout forth or declare or it comes from a root word that means to shoot an arrow amen to sing something out or say something out or to sing praises to the lord but worship means to bow down so worship is the act of submission or reverence to to deity or to a king amen is this term worship so worship has a manifestation to it or worship has fruit what is the fruit of worship the fruit of worship is obedience to the word a fruit of worship amen for instance cain and abel both brought worship and both of their worship brought fruit but one fruit was rejected and the other fruit of worship was received because one came by revelation of the word and one came by self-will amen but but both of these worshippers were bringing forth worship and their worship was manifest in what they did and the manifestation was the fruit of their worship and one was rejected because it was the wrong kind of fruit and one was receded because it was the right kind of fruit so here we find that that these 12 men are a fruit amen they represent they represent worship or true worship or perfect worship amen which is not ever expressed in self-will is always expressed in a total submission to god and god is his word so there will be a tree that bears fruit all the time and it's wonderful to note it's not just one manner of fruit but there's a continual fruit we can say it this way and this is just me this is just brother chad but there's a perpetual bearing of the fruit a consistent constant in season bearing fruit there's never a month there's never a change in the calendar there's never a period of time that there's not fruit on this tree which means that that this this this this tree this tree of life that's here amen is a constantly bearing of fruit i mean it's not all the same amen it's fruit at church and it's fruit at home and it's fruit at work and it's fruit when you're alone and it's fruit for every season and manner of life it's not one-sided it's not hypocritical it doesn't have gaps in it amen so many times you know even in our christian walk through time if we look if we look through our history we can find gaps in our bearing of fruit i was good at church and i was good at home amen but i began to struggle at school i was good here good here i struggled here amen but but this is a tree that is going to bear every month amen consistently bearing fruit non-stop every month consistently it doesn't go through a dry time it doesn't go through an empty spell it doesn't go through any time of barrenness but she's going to bring forth the fruit of the word constantly amen in a perfect worship back to god again and again and again and again and she's going to do it in honesty and integrity and every manner of operation is going to be fruit every obstacle every trial going to be fruit this is a tree of life amen is going to be bearing the fruit of life this is the quote that i want to hone in on and pay close attention to here for the next little bit and this is what triggered a lot of my thinking in the future home he says on this throne on top of it 1500 miles high the whole world will see the light of the world jesus sitting on the throne on top of the world top of the church top of mount zion which is 1500 miles half the size of the united states and raises plumb up until you can see him the world over 1500 miles high now miller venom is talking in very real measurements amen and very real uh uh measurements and and and space and things like that but let's bring this right back home now to where we are now because when brother brandon preach future home you know well because i told you brother branham draws an analogy in future home and he's showing the future you know 1500 miles square at the base and going up 1500 miles there's going to be a physical mountain rise up out of the earth and a city dwell over it but he says i can drop a little something here he says that's about the dimensions we got right here now he's talking about in the church one from maine down to arkansas one from here in canada over to the coast he said it's about what we have here showing that that city that's there is represented on earth so that's so on top of mount zion amen where is the light of the lamb shining to the whole world today where is it today friend don't tell me where it's going to be amen a thousand years from now or more but where is that light shining now that light is on top of the mountain amen it's on top of mount zion and where is the top of mount zion it's the bright age friends on top of the seven church ages the capstone is coming down he himself has united with his bride and it's the lamb enthroned in her and that's the light of the whole world there is no other light for this world amen it is life it's the top of the city it's the top of mount zion it's the top of the church ages it is him and her united as one and now he is reflecting himself down through her through the whole city because it's all the truth it's all the character it's everything that's been built up through the entire new testament church now on full display where is the light of the world on top of mount zion who is the light of the world the lamb jesus christ himself is he on his throne yes is his light shining yes is the light shining in darkness every much is so is with shining the day that light came to the earth and they were so stuck in darkness they refused to receive the light not a physical light not a light you can see not a light that's widely accepted or recognized as light because when jesus was here he was not widely accepted and not recognized as light but he said i am the light of the world and i am the life i am the light and i am the life and i want to say friends on top of mount zion he's here the light is here the life is here outside of that light is darkness the city is reflected here on earth the light is here so now we we've gotten our minds in the right spot brother brennan's preaching future home i'd like to say just as in my own way of thinking my own understanding amen brother man's preaching future home not to get us excited about something that will come someday but brother branham is preaching future home to get you to recognize what is today what is here amen and what is here is showing what will be and what will be is known by what is so i'm in the same quote in future home and all up and down here will be the redeemed there will be the houses of pure gold listen i don't care about a house of gold you understand gold represents deity deity tabernacled in flesh and one day this flesh is going to be changing the body like his own glorious body and it will be pure gold amen when we get a glorified body that will be your house of pure gold right now the holy ghost is sanctifying cleaning this house so that he can live in it but this is not yet the house of pure gold but i've got a house of pure gold coming amen it's not one that's got a couch and a sofa and something i'm going to sit and amen it's a body it's a body where my atoms have changed been made like into his own glorious body houses of pure gold there will be avenues and parks and gardens and the river of life come trickling out of the throne and running down through little chasms and over every terrace and listen to this and the tree of life will be blooming in every yard you know what i don't think brother branham's misquoting the bible or trying to add to the bible i think he's trying to get us to understand a picture he's painting a picture you say where did he get that in the bible i didn't see that in the bible every yard amen he's a prophet of god he's trying to get you to see something he said the the there would be parks and gardens what is this this is a recreation of the garden of eden the city is the garden the gardens in the city amen he's in the garden amen like aaron was sharing with us on sunday amen god amen the first work he did was make a garden amen eastwood and eden mean the beginning or at the start of eating made a garden and he put the man in the garden and here once again he's got a city that's a garden and the man is in the garden and the river of life flowing down it's a well-watered land from the throne it's watering down trickling down through every terrace and every chasm that means every part of this bride is well watered and the tree of life will be blooming in every yard and bear its fruits 12 times a year a changing fruit every month so i want to focus on this the tree of life will be blooming in every yard amen that means amen in my house in front of my house there should be a tree of life blooming that means if that image is supposed to be reflected here that means in my yard there should be a tree of life blooming now friends there should be something amen declaring the very life of the tree of life is present on the earth now because in my yard if i'm going to have a yard there with a tree of life blooming then i've got to have a place here with the tree of life blooming in my yard praise be to god listen this is not the day for partial that was church ages dip in the holy ghost partial outpouring partial understanding partial partial partial ad ad amen it's all been added amen it's all been poured back in it's all been given back so this is not the time of partial this is the time of full manifestation so the tree of life will be blooming in every yard when i read that i said oh god let the tree of life bloom in my yard let it be blooming now in my yard lord he says in the restoration of the bride tree from 1962 the first thing he did is he destroyed god's first precious fruit tree christ he was the tree from the garden of eden that's right the first the first fruit tree he destroyed it first one god planted here on earth was christ he destroyed that tree that was bearing his fruit now they had all kinds of organizations and he just had that in his hands but when he come to that tree that bore the actual fruit that roman bug got in there see destroyed the tree the tree yes jesus said in saint john if i do not the works of my father i have not the fruits of my father don't believe me he was bearing the fruit of god he was the tree from the garden he was the tree of life amen in rome cut him down and hung him on a tree and he says he destroyed that he's the tree that was destroyed all the way back from the from he was the tree from the garden of eden that had been destroyed and if you look in genesis 3 14 i'll just read it to you and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt i eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so all the way back after the fall god planted a seed of his word showing that there would be a seed of a woman that would come forth and it was planted all the way back from the garden of eden and all through the old testament that seed of the tree of life grew grew through the prophets grew through the psalms and probably grew all the way up until it come into full fruit bearing and what did they do to that tree they cut it down and hung it on a cross and out from that tree came another tree and that was a bride tree amen but the roman bug got into that tree in the first age and began to eat the fruit and then eat the leaves and then eat the bark and then suck the sap but he said i will restore saith the lord all that the cankerworm palmer worm caterpillar locusts have eaten i will restore saith the lord because there was a seed planted in genesis from eden that grew up amen then the romans destroyed that and then he brought forth the bride tree and the roman bug destroyed that but he's going to have one in the last day that's a restored bride tree that will not be destroyed by rome amen because rome the veil has been taken away and rome cannot deceive her anymore no more deception like in the garden no more deception like in the first age because he's he's opened the book he's loose to seal the mystery of god's mind is revealed like never before on this earth and what did he reveal the seal why did he break the seal and unlock the mystery amen so that this bride won't be deceived she's predestinated not to be deceived so he sent a word amen because she was deceived by words he brought a word that will stop deception remember in the beginning the woman was deceived by words and the first church age she was deceived by words doctrines and teachings so he came and he gave us his whole mind so that we can't be deceived any longer by words because he gave us his word that's why if we just stick with the word we won't be deceived not try to manipulate into it just stick with it and as god reveals it and opens it and you see it and it's there and it's playing just stay with the word see he said in the end time evangelism from 1962 he said looky here remember my message recently on the bride tree how they took jesus he was the tree the one that david saw a tree planted by the rivers of water his fruit and season the most perfect tree and they cut him down and hung him on a man-made roman tree for a mockery but what did he do rose up again on the third day what else did he do he set forth a bride tree a man and a woman like the trees that was in the garden of eden two trees one of them the tree of life one of them the tree of death and what did he do he come to redeem this tree so since he redeemed it at calvary he's ready to plant her now oh my i get the feeling religious when you say that see to restore his bride tree the one that should have been in eden but she fell there because she disbelieved the word but here he's going to restore a tree that will believe the word and when she come up on the day of pentecost that original doctrine that original faith then what did the rome begin to do send a cankerworm send a palmer room and each one took as part of the of the fruit the leaves and everything and sucked it all down but what did the prophet saw that he said but i will restore that tree saith the lord she started back in the reformation what did she do organized god pruned her right in saint john 14 cut all the organization off of it and she came back to wesley she organized pruned her off but i will restore she's still coming now what does it do in the evening time there will there will be not an organization there will be a top where does the fruit ripen at first in the top why the sun hits it in the evening time the seeds are planted now for the evening time bride tree when the tree of life returns back to the bride tree what was the restoration doing in the reformation it was bringing back the sap it was bringing back the bark it was bringing back the leaves bringing back blooms but in order to bring back fruit you've got to bring back the bridegroom tree and what will it be in the end time he said in the end time what will it be he said when the tree of life returns back to the bride tree you see and the evening lights has come out now to water and ripen that fruit that's been on the tree that's been planted oh praise god this is the day we live in france this is the place where we're at i i say it like this today in this world there is a light there is a light on the throne on top of mount zion in the bride it's the light of the lamb it's god is the light thereof and the lamb is the light thereof but i also want to say that there's a tree of life in every yard bearing the same fruit he bore amen a full manifestation of the full life amen it's to be here in this day and it's to be in every yard that's why when we do the carrot on the stick thing you know it's so detrimental to our christian walk to keep putting things off because you know everything is hanging at the end of the stick we'll call it the golden carrot when i eat that i'll have a ride when i eat that i'll manifest the life when i eat that i'll be perfect when i get there but he's given us the fruit of the tree he's given us all the food we need to overcome in this day he's given us all the food with all the vitamins with all the nutrients with all the substance that we need to be everything he's called for his bride to be in this day we've got to eat on it and become what we eat we've got to feed on the word amen not kick it down not sometime in our mind amen project in the future i'll do in the future i'll overcome in the future today's the day to overcome today's the day to let the tree bloom in your yard god wants it to bloom now that doesn't mean there's not a process we're all in the process there's a process to this god's working us in the process amen but we're all going to be blooming the tree of life will be blooming in every yard in the in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed prophet of god says now remember he is that tree of life contrary to the serpent seed you see he is that seed the woman's seed the tree of life in the garden unless they put forth their hands and move this tree they'd eat that tree and live forever and he's the only tree that can be taken that you can live forever his word is life and that by the word then the word of god which eve turned down in the garden of eden then here is christ the word made manifest and when he come on earth he was the tree of life do you believe that and rome what did they do he had to be chopped down and he was put on a tree of disgrace curses he that hang on a tree became a curse for the human race and now through that through what through calvary and now through that he brings forth a bride tree which will be the tree of life restored back to him as husband and wife in the garden of eden glory to god by the same word and the same god may manifest in husband and wife the same bride tree back again so now at the end time amen the bridegroom tree will come back to the bright tree the tree of life will come back to the bride tree amen and at the same time amen the bride tree will be stored back to the tree of life the two are coming back together again by the same word and the same god made manifest in husband and in wife the same word and same god made manifest in the husband is the same word and same god to be made manifested in the wife let's turn together to isaiah 61. now you may remember isaiah 61 is the scripture that jesus goes into when he goes into the temple one day and he's handed a scroll and he reads part of the verse amen and he closes the scroll and he says this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears and brother branham comes and he and he preaches um oh what does he preach amen the next sermon he preaches is this day this scripture is fulfilled amen but he but he's preaching on judgment and i can't remember right now when he's preaching it's not choosing of a bride but it's something like that birth pains thank you birth pains he's preaching the sick seals preaching judgment he's preaching birth pains amen and in birth veins he begins to he has this episode where his bible pages of bible stick together a priest comes and hands him his bible amen just replicating the scene that jesus had went through two thousand years ago amen and then brother later the lord tells him amen go back to your bible and then he sees the pages are stuck and he and he takes him to this realization that he just went through exactly what jesus went through but he didn't repeat what jesus repeated he was finishing what jesus left off because he said part of this scripture applies to his first coming and part of the scripture applies to his second coming so when when brother branham when that priest hands him the scroll i mean he reads out of that book and then he begins to preach birth pains he's actually he's actually noting he's actually signifying that we're in the second coming now this is the second coming so isaiah 61 verse 1 the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives in the opening of the prison to them that are found to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord comma this is where jesus stops now when brother branham comes back amen brother batman doesn't come he doesn't come in birth pains and read any of this verse but he preaches the message birth pains which is finishing what jesus didn't finish and later god shows him that that's what that's this is what this is for that jesus had stopped here because the rest of it pertained to his second coming so let's keep reading in verse 2 and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn so the day of vengeance of our god amen is the wrath that is going to be poured out is the judgment that's coming upon the earth but listen listen it also says to comfort all that mourn semicolon not the end of the sentence yet let's finish the sentence to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified all of this is to be fulfilled in the second coming friends and that's what's going on right now judgment to the world amen judgment to the world but comfort to all them that mourn amen you that have mourned the condition of the world you have mourned the rejection of the word you're the mourne now in the second coming there's coming a comfort for you that mourn there's coming to a point unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes amen you've been rejected the word has been rejected christ has been rejected amen and put on the outside of the church but in the second coming you're getting beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees trees of righteousness the planting of the lord his garden his vineyard his planting his trees trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified listen the world is falling apart the world is falling apart that's what birth pains were about but the birth pains that were bringing a destruction on the earth the purpose of the birth pains was not to destroy the earth the purpose of the birth pains is to bring a bright new world for a millennium so it just depends on how you look at it whether or not this is a good thing or a bad thing when a woman goes into travail this is what brother brennan begins to preach this is the scripture he's looking for when a woman is in travail amen when a woman is in travail to bring forth a child is that a good thing or a bad thing it's it's painful it's difficult it's near to death for her it's a near-death experience for her amen but she's going through that to produce life she's not going through that just for suffering she's suffering for life she's suffering to bring forth life and the earth is going through birth pains amen to bring forth a bright new world for a millennium amen at the same time that that catastrophe is striking and disasters on every hand and chaos on the earth amen there's oil of joy there's there's beauty for ashes there's a garment of praise for this is not the time to hang our head and kick our feet in the dirt amen he is here amen the light is here the lamb is here the fruit is here amen the carrot's not on the stick but the fruit is in me amen i've tasted of the lord and i know that he's good i've taken the book and eaten the book [Music] this is the second coming for the believers the second coming for the world is destruction the second coming for the believers is joy unspeakable and full of glory [Music] that why what's going to happen in second coming that we might be trees of righteousness the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life these trees are trees of righteousness and brother baby said there's going to be a tree in every yard see all these things are speaking of the same thing not five million trees of life but one tree of life expressed in every member in the bride tree of life in your yard in your yard in your yard in your yard in my yard not a different tree of life not a secondary tree of life not a kind of tree of life or a knockoff tree of life but the tree of life blooming in each believer brother branham says in 1960 to whom would we go if you got a little tree that's got apple trees it'll bear apples if you just put it in the right foundation if you've got a heart hungering for god you want to see the power of god you want to feel the vibrations of his eternal life you want to see if the holy ghost is real or not just plant your tree in his right foundation and you'll find out something goes to work oh he will begin to draw the waters of life and that little tree will begin to bear blossoms and fruit it'll start growing because you're planted right you've got to get started right get get get the revival right so if you want the tree to produce all that it can produce it's got to be in the right foundation or the right soil it's got to be planted on the right foundation which is christ the word the word has been given back to us that the tree can be planted in the right ground 1958 brother behind says if a christian church is divine or the branches that's in christ they'll do the works of christ and bear the life of christ by their fruits you shall know them now then the way that he is today he's here in the form of the holy spirit working through his church performing the same things that he did there that makes him the same yesterday today and forever his life the life that was in christ which was god which was god produced the kind of life that he lived then that same life comes into his churches his church members since they have been purged by his blood and given the holy spirit access to work through them bears the same fruit that he bore so therefore the world can see that christ is the same yesterday today and forever same tree same fruit and in the second adoption message brother brand preaches in 1960 said god by his election grace called you god by his election grace sanctified you god by his election grace and his power baptized you and put you into his land of rest they which have entered into this rest have ceased from their going astray they cease from their works like god did from his they have joy unspeakable and full of glory the tree of life is blooming in them where is this tree of life it's blooming in you in your yard amen the tree of life amen brother branham oh i mean i mean don't dismiss anything the prophet of god says he makes a statement like that the tree of life will be blooming in every yard what scripture is that we're talking about oh my goodness just take a prophet for a prophet he's trying to get you to see something he's not saying there's going to be a literal i don't know maybe there is a literal tree of life and everywhere i don't know but what he's trying to show us is the condition that should be present today amen the tree of life should be blooming in our hearts friends it should be bringing forth the same fruit that it produced in the first church the same fruit that it produced in jesus christ it should be producing now amen don't limit that life in any way amen if he if he open blinded eyes he can open blinded eyes today he can do it spiritually and he can do it physically if he raised the dead he can raise the dead today he can raise the spiritually dead and he can raise the physically dead don't limit that fruit in any way and don't put it on a carrot at the end of a stick and say it's for tomorrow or another day or another time it's for now the full life is available now whatever he wants to do he can do amen through his vessels it's not for us to manufacture it's not for us to work up but do not limit the power of god do not limit the life that is here it should be bearing amen this tree that's blooming in our heart it should be bearing all manner of fruit in every season that means when sickness strikes your house amen it should bear fruit of healing amen when need strikes your house it should amen it should bear fruit of provision amen if evil spirits bring torment unto your house it should bring a fruit of deliverance amen this tree that's blooming in our heart it should bring forth fruit in every season and not be barren a fruit for every occasion a fruit for every need amen why because the tree of life is blooming in my heart bringing forth fruit bringing forward worship bringing for obedience amen in every situation if sickness comes there's a fruit of healing if need comes there's a fruit of provision amen how many of you are experiencing that and say that's the truth amen when it comes at my door i find there's something in me that i didn't know was there before and all of a sudden god does something and there's fruit they meant fruit of the word comes on display in the hour of need why because there's a fruit tree blooming in our hearts a tree of life is blooming in them they have long suffering gentleness goodness patience faith meekness gentleness and so forth the tree of life is blooming in them because their hope is anchored in christ jesus the witness of the holy ghost bearing record with signs and wonders following the believers let's turn to first corinthians together first corinthians chapter three first corinthians chapter 3 verse 6. it says i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase so that neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for we are laborers together with god i mentioned that a few weeks ago but they're not laborers for god they're working in partnership with god ye are god's husbandry you're his field you're his garden you're his vineyard all the labor that was going on was for god's husbandry you're god's husband you're his building you're the thing he's trying you're the garden he's bringing back you're the tree he's restoring you're his project he's the great husbandman which means farmer or keeper of vines amen and and all the ministry that paul was talking about we're laborers together with god but you're the project we're all working on you're the project god's working on you're the project paul was working you're the project apollos is working on one's planting one's water one's pruning what are we doing what are we working for we're working for the bride tree we're working for the restoration of the bride tree let's go to john 15. god uses this analogy over and over and over again we're the planting of the lord we're the vineyard of the lord we're the vine of of christ and we're the branches he's divine just over and over we see the same thing reflecting back john 15 1 i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every banter in me that beareth not fruity taketh away and every branch that beareth fruity purges it that it may bring forth more fruit see like i said there's a process and in this process apollos paul pastor evangelist friend another brother they're laborers together with god in god's husbandry in his field but part of what god does is right here every breast that beareth fruit he purgeth it but it was bearing fruit why did he purge it why did he cut it why it was bearing fruit because when he began to see fruit he recognized that's a true vine when it begins to give fruit of the word amen how many of you can testify of this with me amen when you gave your heart to the lord and god miraculously transformed your life all of a sudden there was fruit fruit fruit answered prayers healings all kinds of manifestations and then all the sudden purging and nothing you pray for happened before every prayer you prayed was answered then all of a sudden you go through a time what's he doing he eat that that's a vine that's an original fine from the original rootstock amen it's bringing forth fruit amen that's where amen we all got to get together and work with god amen and work in this vineyard this is one from the original stock friends this is one that's tied back to the original amen this is where the pruning comes he didn't prune it ain't meant to stop it from bearing fruit he said he that beareth fruit he purges it that it might bring forth more fruit because this this bride tree is going to bear every month not just one time not a flash in a pan but when god's done when the great husbandman is done with his work he's going to prune off every little sucker everything that that's not producing life everything that's extra everything that's unnecessary he's going to he's going to strip it away he's going to prune it away amen so that it can bring forth more fruit there's going to be fruit every month amen there's going to be all manner of fruit in its season she says jesus goes on to say now you are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me i am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me he can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so that ye be my disciples how is the glory glorified when you bear much fruit it glorifies god not you it glorifies the husband men who kept this vine that's why in isaiah 61 3 you are the your trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified this tree bringing forth fruit in its season is to glorify god because it was his plan from the beginning see like i said god uses this analogy over and over and over again he even uses his analogy in the old testament amen speaking of the nation of israel he said consider my vineyard what more could i have done i mean i i built a hedge of protection around them amen i digged and i dung the soil i for i did everything but yet it still wouldn't give me fruit see god's very clear in his description in the bible he doesn't want a vine that says i'm a vine he wants the manifestation of the life from the root to come out of this branch he doesn't want to say i'm a christian i'm a christian i believe the message that's not what he's looking for he's looking for something that'll bring the life of the message the fruit of the message amen what what god was talking about all through his bible he doesn't want i mean he doesn't want a nice stone hedge all the way around and a bunch of unbearing vines amen he wants something that's bringing forth fruit he said i that this was a good garden israel was a good garden amen it had stone wall all the way around it it had he had dung the soil he had digged the soil he had pruned the vine and when he goes back to it there's no fruits that's why jesus curses the fig tree because there's no fruit god doesn't want us to know about these things he wants us to live them god doesn't want us to say someday oh this this bride tree that someday she's going to produce fruit what more does he have to do friends he's put the wall up he's trimming the vines he's done the soil he's digged it amen what's he looking for for fruits yield back to him fruit brother says in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says now there's only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when there's nothing else can follow it and now the ecumenical world has set up of such a regime there could be no denomination and no nothing else follow it you're either in it or you're not in it the fruit is in the top of the tree and the light is shining on that predestinated fruit and she is ripening into christ-like fruit bringing forth the same mellowness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him i hope you see it see when brother ram goes into crisis mr god revealed for me this clarifies some things for me because it's not just being able to replicate certain kind of works but it's to have the same spirit you can replicate some of the works like you can replicate there can be a replication of healing motherboard said you know the witch doctors can accomplish some of that a replication of tongues and interpretations and a witch doctor you can have i mean all kinds of denominations can have different replications of certain works amen and if we if we have to take if we have to take every work as a sign that that's where christ is then every time there's a healing you have to say christ is in that church which there's always healing that's one of the fruits it should always be there divine healing should always be part of us amen tongue should always be part of us every gift that was ever given was never taken away but what he's showing here is it's not just a certain gift that's replicated or a certain demonstration but it's the very nature in life that was in that original tree amen is what's shining forth in this bride tree it can't have a different nature it can't have a different sweetness and melons than christ himself i don't care i don't i shouldn't say i don't care but you can get look alike fruit and not have the same life in the root but we want all the fruit that's supposed to be on this tree that's coming from the original life the original nature it's got to be the same melons and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him brother says in jehovah jireh from 1964 he said look old brother when the holy spirit come into that vine and produce from its vine to the first branch and they wrote a book of acts behind it if that tree ever puts forth another original limb she'll grow the same thing it'll be jesus christ what did he say did you catch that he said if this this original book of acts he said when the vine put that first vine put forth the branch they wrote a book of acts of founder if they ever do the same thing it'll be the same thing it'll be jesus christ not doing some of the things he did it'll be him with his full nature in his full life now we've got methodist presbyterian baptist lutheran everything else grafted into it bearing denominational fruit but if it ever puts forth another branch she'll be a genuine christ-filled christ-centered word of god it didn't say she'd believe the word of god and said she would be the word of god she'll be a genuine christ-filled christ-centered word of god the word of god made alive let's took the romans i want to read this as our last scripture romans chapter 7. romans chapter 7 verse 1. yeah romans 7 1. know you not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath the husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth should be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband is dead she is free from the law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god how are we going to bring forth fruits we have to get married we have to be divorced from the old life from the old man from the old nature it has to die amen but then we have to be married to christ so that we can bring forth fruit unto god this bride tree has to bring forth fruit brother beth says in the restoration of the bride tree but what he was god's perfect prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree amen glory going to say something directly he is the bridegroom tree do you believe it from the garden of eden amen then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he's got to have a bride tree she has got to be born of the same material the word made flesh in the tree hope you get it it's the same life in this female tree the bridegroom as it is in the bride the works that i do shall you also why because it's the same life so if the bridegroom tree can't produce fruit without the bride tree can the bride tree produce fruit without the bridegroom tree see what's the key to producing fruit one you have to be the right seed you have to be planted in the right foundation which is the word the right seed in the right foundation then it's got to be watered from the word it's got to receive the light of the sun amen all of these things that was typed out through the message and in the bible and it grows up and it's got to be purged and pruned by the husbandmen but still it's got to come in contact with the mail to bring forth life the bridegroom tree needs the bride tree the bride true needs the bridegroom tree you say i'm i'm bride i'm bright i'm bride that's wonderful amen but you've got to be one with the bridegroom so that the life of the bridegroom amen can come through the bride tree because the tree of life has to be blooming in every yard bringing forth all manner of fruit this is the wedding the wedding has produced pollination pollination produces fruit this is the season friends i want to finish with this last quote brother man says in investments 1963 he says i was remarking about in my soul a few moments ago mind about bearing the fruit of the spirit as one of the brothers give that quotation bearing fruit you know we can't manufacture fruit we have to bear fruit sheep doesn't manufacture wool but because he would but because he has wool and bears wool he is a sheep these are simple ideas simple concepts but they're as true as true can be all the way through he bears well he is a sheep that's the reason he bears wool that's the only way we can ever be a christian is not because that we have the name or try to work up something to manufacture it being a sheep you just bare wool being a christian you just bear the fruits of it see we can't work this up we can't pump it up we can't manufacture it we can't make it happen but on the flip side i i'd like to i'd like to bring balance to that we can hinder it so you you can't make yourself seed when you're not seed but even if you are the right seed you can hinder this process you can hinder this process by staying away from the husbandmen you can hinder this process by not drinking in the water you can hinder this process by not standing still and being pruned see we can hinder this process but we can never manufacture fruit so there's this there's this calvinistic armenian thing again we're back him into the book of ephesians again back to the the fact that if you're not of the original stock of the original tree of life you cannot produce the 12 manner of fruits but even if you are of that original stock and then that original and you've got the capability of producing fruit in every season under every occasion for every need it's all there the potential's in the seed i mean you've got it all but you've got to be able to stand the purging you got to be drinking in the water you got to be basking in the light amen we got to be surrendering and submissing in pure worship to god and if we can just surrender to him and let him cut where we need caught if we just let him bring the water and the rain and drink it in when he gives it to us if we'll just lay in the presence of the sun we will produce 12 manner of fruit fruit for every occasion fruit for every season fruit to meet every need that comes our way and if we look at our lives and we reflect and we say sometimes i'm satisfied with what i see i see god working in my life but over here i'm not so satisfied ten months of the year fruit two months the tree's not bearing doing good at work doing good at church not so good at home right good at home good at work not so good with my brothers and sisters church this is reality this is the reality i'm not saying that's not a tree of life i'm not saying the tree of life is not blooming in your yard but that tree of life isn't intended to constantly bring forth fruit for every occasion in every season sometimes we just need to look and say god i realize you need to purge me i realize that i'm dry and i need a little bit of rain god help me not to run from the light but help me to lean into the light help me not to stay away from fellowship help me not to remove myself from the purging hand of the husbandman help me just to surrender lord amen i'm not happy with partial because this isn't the age of partial i'm not just happy that i believe the message and got a sanctified life and i've got a revelation of the seals and i've got a nice family but i want to bear all manner of fruit in every season i want to have no barrenness in my life in any place i want every branch every vine in this tree to bloom and bring forth fruit and i can't do it i can't do it on my own but god's promised that he'll send the reign and that there's a team of workers laboring with god in god's husbandry and just yield to that hand god knows what's in us and he knows to get it out how to get it out if you see a tree if you go by and you look at apple trees right now apple trees are bearing like crazy they're starting to harvest they'll be harvesting now i don't know how long but the leafy green bunch of apples hanging all over it but you know the husband of that field after he gathers up those apples if he wants to get the same thing next year what is he going to have to do to that tree here in a month or two he's going to have to cut it down and it's going to look like he tried to kill the tree and you're going to say what did you do to your tree he said i'm ensuring that it'll bring forth in its season again see there's times that god because because he intends for the tree of life to be blooming there's times he's got to cut time to water time to fertilize time for everything but he's going to make sure that we bear 12 manner of fruit and i say be it unto me god i'm your tree i believe with all my heart i'm part of that tree i believe it i believe that i'm part of that city that that if he talks about a dwelling place there it's me he's talking about me if he says there'll be if the if he says the tree of life will be blooming in every yard that's describing me that's my yard i believe it but i also know i need the great husbandmen to keep doing the work so that i can bring forth fruit in every season i want to bear all manner of fruit i want to be whatever jesus christ was on earth i want him to have that potential in me and whenever he calls for it i want it to come out if he uses opposition to bring it out so be it if he uses difficulty and hardship to bring out that fruit so be it my goal is to bear fruit in every season not to dictate which season i've got to bear fruit in july i got to bear fruit in june because he's going to have all manner of fruit there's going to be a tree of life blooming in every yard let's all stand do you believe you're part of that tree of life let's bow our heads and close our eyes just in your own heart how many of you like to say lord i think i need some pruning but i welcome it lord or we can maybe say lord i see that what's going on in my life is you've been pruning me you're not mad at me it's not just a bad set of circumstances it's not just a lot in life i have but it's actually lord your hand pruning me you may not have
