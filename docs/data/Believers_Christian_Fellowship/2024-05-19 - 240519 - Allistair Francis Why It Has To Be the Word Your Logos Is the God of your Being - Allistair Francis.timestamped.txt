[24:01] light that has ever graced the Earth

[25:08] the name that sets captives free the
[25:11] sweet name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[25:14] Christ amen
[25:17] amen amen the Lord bless you let us read
[25:21] Matthew chapter
[25:23] 4 verse 2- 4
[25:29] for our scripture
[25:31] reading Matthew 4:
[25:34] 2-4 and then also 1 Corinthians 1:
[25:40] 21 I certainly
[25:42] appreciate all of you very
[25:45] much and
[25:47] uh um I never may never get to know all
[25:50] of you
[25:52] personally uh in the flesh but that
[25:55] doesn't really matter because from here
[25:58] feels like I know every one of you in
[26:00] the way it's supposed to be and uh just
[26:04] knowing that people love the word is
[26:07] everything your reaction your amen and
[26:11] your
[26:12] questions amen it's beautiful the
[26:14] fellowship has just been wonderful so I
[26:16] really really appreciate you and the
[26:19] songs that were sung I from the from the
[26:22] moment I landed and brother Chad and
[26:26] brother Dan picked me up it's like every
[26:28] single day every part of our
[26:30] conversation was about what I was
[26:33] preaching and nobody knew anything and
[26:36] the songs that were sung even the one
[26:38] this morning it's just and it means so
[26:41] much because you come here with this
[26:42] nervousness and this you know
[26:45] questioning yourself and what are you
[26:46] going to say how are you going to say it
[26:48] but then God's people just places it
[26:51] perfectly for us so I really appreciate
[26:54] it Matthew 4:4 and when he had found
[26:58] fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was
[27:00] afterward and hungered and when the
[27:03] tempter came to him he said if thou be
[27:06] the Son of God command that these Stones
[27:09] be made bread but he answered and said
[27:13] it is written man shall not live by
[27:17] bread alone but by every word that
[27:21] proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen
[27:24] do we know what it really means do you
[27:26] know what it means to to live by
[27:29] word it's this is not Christian theology
[27:32] this is actual
[27:35] reality and that's what we're going to
[27:37] speak on today let's read 1
[27:39] Corinthians chap 1:
[27:43] 21 so first he tells us we have to live
[27:47] by word then he tells us this for after
[27:52] that in the wisdom of God the World by
[27:55] wisdom knew not God it pleased God by
[28:00] the foolishness of preaching to save
[28:03] them that
[28:04] believe so even calling we have to live
[28:07] by the word and yet it's called
[28:10] foolishness amen the Lord add a blessing
[28:12] to his word you may be seated
[28:16] amen so this is going to be the subject
[28:20] we're speaking on why it has to be the
[28:24] word amen I'm really excited to speak to
[28:27] you about it why it has to be the word
[28:30] and the title your logos is the god of
[28:35] your
[28:37] being and I want that to be the reality
[28:40] for every believer I ever meet for the
[28:43] young people why it has to be the word
[28:46] the title answers it because the logos
[28:49] your logos is the god of your being amen
[28:53] amen and that's what we want to explore
[28:54] this morning so I trust that it will be
[28:57] a blessing uh to us so I just want to
[29:00] also
[29:01] say um and and nothing here is going to
[29:04] be directly a continuation of the last
[29:07] two services that we've done but I trust
[29:09] that doing Dimensions so I did
[29:12] Dimensions here in two Services back
[29:15] home I did a service on each Dimension
[29:19] and a series that lasted um a month or
[29:23] more so I know that you have the the
[29:27] teaching to fill in all the gaps I'm
[29:29] just going to encourage you from
[29:31] everything that was said of course it's
[29:33] meant to give you questions it's meant
[29:35] to give you probing it's meant to make
[29:37] you reconsider what you thought before
[29:41] it's not meant to confuse you or change
[29:43] you because you're the bride of Christ
[29:44] nothing can nothing can make you
[29:46] disbelieve the word everything that we
[29:49] say has to bring something to question
[29:51] to probe to move on do not become the
[29:55] people that say this is what I believe
[29:58] I'm not judging beyond that the word
[30:00] says take every inch of
[30:04] ground don't be satisfied sitting back
[30:07] and saying I think I've got what I want
[30:09] now don't tell me anymore fight for
[30:12] every inch of ground this is the land
[30:15] that is given to you appreciate every
[30:17] single part of it and if he's given us
[30:20] his word I want to enjoy every single
[30:22] corner of it amen and I trust that's
[30:26] going to be something my dad told us
[30:29] brother Steve as we grew up and we and I
[30:33] and I really appreciate that about him
[30:35] he said to me Al whatever you believe
[30:39] put a
[30:40] comma never put a full stop because we
[30:44] are mortal and God is always revealing
[30:47] when you think you know something
[30:49] question it again and that's what we
[30:51] would do every night of our lives with
[30:53] him at Family altar discussions on the
[30:56] word probing probing robing questioning
[30:58] questioning questioning fellowshipping
[31:01] he would learn from us we would learn
[31:03] from him we would learn from one another
[31:06] but we never stopped fellowshipping on
[31:08] the word so I know there may be some of
[31:11] the things I missed even those those
[31:13] crude diagrams that I put up I um one of
[31:16] the questions that came up was uh did
[31:18] you put eight Church ages uh because I
[31:21] had you know those eight circles with
[31:23] the and no it wasn't Church ages those
[31:25] were people in the church ages
[31:28] originally when I did the slide I had 20
[31:30] then I thought I had to put the text on
[31:32] the site so I cut it down I didn't even
[31:34] count how many there were so no I didn't
[31:36] put a church ages it was it was people
[31:39] people with the Holy Ghost amen but I
[31:42] appreciate the questions and the
[31:43] questions that came up it's really
[31:45] wonderful to see how you don't miss a
[31:47] beat this is good you're listening glory
[31:50] to God Amen so to get to our subject why
[31:54] it has to be the word and I think being
[31:58] message
[31:59] Believers we have I have taken this for
[32:03] granted uh all my life because uh I was
[32:08] born a Christian whatever that means uh
[32:11] became a a message
[32:13] believer uh and we got used to sitting
[32:16] here in church and and the Lord calls us
[32:19] foolishness this the foolishness of
[32:21] preaching if the world looks at you
[32:23] right now they think you're crazy that
[32:26] you you waste 4 hours sitting here all
[32:30] facing one person behind a desk he looks
[32:33] like any other Idol worshipping Oracle
[32:37] to which you are giving
[32:39] obeisance it looks terrible it looks
[32:42] Pagan it looks like you're just another
[32:44] foolish Gathering of people you should
[32:47] be out there it's nice and warm doing
[32:49] something in your shorts you know riding
[32:52] a bike or enjoying your life you only
[32:55] have one life that's what they they
[32:58] think uh and uh enjoy it while you have
[33:02] it this in every sense is foolishness to
[33:05] man to be sitting here and look at you
[33:09] I'm speaking things you don't know me
[33:10] you're nodding your head in agreement
[33:12] what's going on why should you be
[33:15] agreeing why should you be saying those
[33:16] weird things like amen you know so we
[33:20] grew up with this in the message we took
[33:22] it for granted it became um uh uh almost
[33:26] tradition to us
[33:28] but you know when you receive Revelation
[33:30] eventually it becomes
[33:31] reality but so it occurred to me you
[33:34] know I want to make us understand why
[33:37] the word is so important why it has to
[33:39] be the word and it occurred to me that
[33:42] there is a reason why people no longer
[33:44] Place such importance on the word So
[33:48] when you say things like there is a
[33:50] famine in the word in the church in the
[33:52] land it doesn't sound like such a big
[33:54] deal what do you mean we got the tapes
[33:57] we've got this
[33:58] we we go to church what do you mean
[33:59] there's a famine we're hearing different
[34:01] preachers all the time right but are you
[34:04] hearing the
[34:08] word and what does the word do for you
[34:11] and why does it have to be the word
[34:13] because you know people are going to
[34:14] come up to you and say okay fine you've
[34:16] got the word but what about the
[34:19] Miracles shouldn't there be a
[34:21] restoration of the abundance of the
[34:23] Miracles what are the Miracles going he
[34:26] didn't say man shall not live by bread
[34:27] alone but by many
[34:31] miracles no it has to be the
[34:35] word
[34:37] amen the it wasn't Mary didn't say be it
[34:41] unto me according to your
[34:44] Miracle amen amen there's something
[34:47] about word and we're not talking about
[34:50] some Supernatural thing that's floating
[34:53] around we're talking about actual word
[34:56] what is
[34:58] word do you even appreciate what it
[35:01] means that's what we're looking at so I
[35:04] want to be honest with you this morning
[35:07] and speak directly to us this is not
[35:10] going to be a teaching with pictures
[35:12] like before so you better stay awake uh
[35:16] it's not going to be um another kind of
[35:18] teaching that's going to uh convict you
[35:21] or something like that this is going to
[35:23] be Fellowship amen this is going to be
[35:26] talking about human nature
[35:28] this is going to make you appreciate
[35:30] what the word is to you personally amen
[35:34] and I'm going to trust the Lord to bring
[35:36] out all the thoughts that he has placed
[35:38] in my heart I want to also say I was
[35:40] telling brother Chad this message that
[35:43] I'm about a speak on I Was preparing
[35:46] this from
[35:47] 22 specifically for your church I hadn't
[35:50] preached it back home and I was driving
[35:54] after brother Chad invited me the first
[35:56] time and uh I was driving and then I
[35:59] realized these thoughts are coming into
[36:00] my head and I'm going to forget it so I
[36:02] started recording in my phone so I've
[36:04] got three audio recordings on my phone
[36:06] of my thoughts as I was just talking
[36:08] them and then later had to start
[36:11] listening to them all over again to
[36:12] catch a thought and then the sermon
[36:14] began to build up so it was specifically
[36:18] to
[36:19] you and so after that I did preach it to
[36:22] my church because I came here the last
[36:24] time and didn't because I was preaching
[36:25] with brother Daniel and the Lord led us
[36:27] in a different way but here it is today
[36:30] amen and I believe that it is for us
[36:34] amen so I want to tell you with this
[36:37] message where you are in the message and
[36:40] what's expected of you today because it
[36:42] can get so confusing like almost like a
[36:45] weird dream
[36:47] right sometimes coming to church our
[36:49] relationship with God it's it seems
[36:52] mostly
[36:54] surreal we talk about it but it seems
[36:57] like a lot a large percentage of of what
[37:01] we talk about and what we feel and what
[37:03] we experience is beyond our natural
[37:06] sight and it's almost like we have to
[37:08] convince ourselves that it's there like
[37:12] you don't see God physically you don't
[37:15] see him literally you don't describe his
[37:17] Essence we don't really know that what
[37:20] do you actually have you only have
[37:22] church you we don't have any more
[37:25] prophets walking around with sticks and
[37:27] pillars of fire we don't have those
[37:29] things of the Old Testament where people
[37:32] look at experiences and get frightened
[37:34] by it and and have to deal with with
[37:37] with respect with it and so on we don't
[37:39] have those things anymore all we really
[37:41] have is church is one another is
[37:43] listening to the preaching of the word
[37:45] so it it seems like a lot of like maybe
[37:49] if I could put it in a percentage
[37:50] probably more than 50% of what we
[37:53] believe and what we talk about looks
[37:55] like it's it's invisible yeah
[37:58] and you can't live in The
[38:00] Invisible yes we say look to the Unseen
[38:02] what do you even mean by that right and
[38:05] so when you try to force yourself to
[38:09] place your faith in something that is
[38:11] not real to you personally your faith is
[38:14] weak it's got to be real you've got to
[38:17] know how it affects you you've got to
[38:19] know why it's important to you that's
[38:21] why our question is why it has to be the
[38:25] word amen so I want to go to our first
[38:28] quote you can follow with me the prophet
[38:30] says in spiritual food in due season
[38:33] it's just the same thing that David did
[38:36] this morning with the oxcarts got away
[38:39] from the word when the word was
[38:42] presented and give to them they did not
[38:45] want it therefore they had gotten away
[38:47] from it that's what these people had
[38:50] done in the Days of Elijah gotten away
[38:53] from the word this is condition of
[38:56] message people today today yes sir they
[38:58] thought they had the word yes but didn't
[39:01] have
[39:02] it amen we have the word we have the
[39:07] word but many of us don't realize what
[39:10] we have glory to God there are several
[39:14] things here and why is he saying these
[39:16] things because of what happened to him
[39:20] and the Seven Seals because after he
[39:22] preached Seven Seals you know what he
[39:24] went through with his friends and the
[39:26] church and everything around him he's
[39:28] actually telling that generation they
[39:30] thought they have the word but didn't
[39:32] have it he's trying to bring it to them
[39:34] and they're not receiving it amen so
[39:38] he's warning the people at that time
[39:40] 1965 that they've gotten away from the
[39:42] word he says when the word was presented
[39:44] to them they didn't want it and he
[39:46] explains why why did they not want the
[39:50] word when he brought that why do they
[39:52] not want the opening of The Seven seal
[39:53] why do they not want the seven Thunders
[39:55] because they thought they already had
[39:57] the word
[39:58] yeah right amen why do they think they
[40:01] had the word because whatever they had
[40:03] they felt was working for them right
[40:06] amen this is the danger because the word
[40:09] that you receive is your god am it's the
[40:13] logos of your being amen let's go to the
[40:18] next quote paragraph
[40:20] 163 the mystery of it as paragra 163 uh
[40:24] spiritual food and due season the
[40:26] mystery of it is those
[40:28] seals each one of those churches made an
[40:30] organization and got into it and that's
[40:33] one of the secret things that been wrong
[40:35] before God you see it Dr Lee see look it
[40:38] is that that's the thing right there
[40:40] that's one of the secrets they organize
[40:42] and see was completely out of the will
[40:44] of God and that will be exposed in the
[40:47] last days and lead the people not to a
[40:49] Creed or a denomination but back to the
[40:52] true
[40:53] word and here it is and a true word will
[40:57] come to a certain group of people and
[41:00] the son of man will reveal himself in
[41:03] the midst of them amen
[41:06] amen praise be to God
[41:10] Amen the son of man will reveal himself
[41:12] in the midst of them why it has to be
[41:14] the word why does it have to be the word
[41:18] because he will bring the true word to a
[41:20] certain group of people and then he will
[41:23] manifest himself he will reveal himself
[41:26] like the song was sung today he will
[41:29] come into Plain View am amen amen so I
[41:33] want to talk to you now about the effect
[41:36] of words why it is so important a why
[41:39] word is so significant and I and I
[41:42] promise you after we done speaking
[41:44] you're going to walk away and you're
[41:45] going to have conversations with your
[41:47] family you are going to change your
[41:50] life like never before because you
[41:53] actually don't appreciate what words are
[41:57] we this made me think about everything
[41:59] that happens in my life God so let's
[42:02] start are you ready for this okay now
[42:05] we're going to talk about human nature
[42:07] everything and I want to say this we're
[42:09] not talking about psychology
[42:11] psychologists are
[42:13] robbers pardon me for any budding
[42:15] psychologist
[42:17] here God already knew about the
[42:20] brain so everything that they come up
[42:23] with all the enzymes and the names and
[42:25] you know epinephrine and and cortisol
[42:28] and uh serotonin dopamine those are
[42:31] names they made up for things that God
[42:33] created and God already knows how it
[42:36] works so we're not when it come to human
[42:38] behavior brother R said it's been the
[42:40] greatest part of his life to watch the
[42:42] nature of
[42:43] people amen if you're a Son of God
[42:46] Nature has to stand out to you you have
[42:49] to be able to discern nature you have to
[42:51] be able to decide what it is you have to
[42:53] know what it is so when we talk about
[42:55] human behavior a lot of believer say you
[42:57] know what this is psychology no it's not
[42:59] psychology this is the reality
[43:02] psychologists copy what we know they
[43:04] just don't know
[43:06] that all right so let's talk about it
[43:09] first let's make the
[43:11] observation there's no other species on
[43:15] planet Earth that communicates with
[43:22] words let that sink why does it have to
[43:25] be
[43:26] word there is no other
[43:29] species yes yes parrots can talk but
[43:31] they don't know what they're saying okay
[43:34] we know that even a crow can call some
[43:37] word or something but they have no idea
[43:38] they don't communicate with each other
[43:40] in words they they do things by
[43:43] association they'll say something just
[43:45] cuz you give them a peanut but they have
[43:47] no idea what you're saying right we are
[43:50] the only species that communicates with
[43:55] word we can communicate with actions
[43:59] facial expressions in fact your babies
[44:01] when they are born they start to
[44:03] communicate with facial expressions uh
[44:06] crying right and then slowly you start
[44:09] teaching them language Say Mama D da
[44:15] right and you start teaching them and
[44:16] they can you can you remember their
[44:18] first Expressions when you tell them to
[44:20] say mama it's
[44:24] like right look at they don't even know
[44:26] but but sooner or later they realize
[44:29] that words are important for them to
[44:30] communicate something to you yeah but um
[44:34] we we communicate by hand actions
[44:37] gestures facial expressions eyebrow
[44:39] movements eye rolling mouth smile frown
[44:44] um um uh stepping body language stoop
[44:47] shoulder chest out all those those are
[44:51] Communications but you can have all
[44:53] those Communications and people place
[44:55] more value on what you
[44:59] said right words don't just make the
[45:03] largest and most important part of our
[45:06] communication but they affect our mental
[45:09] functioning and our soul praise God Amen
[45:14] that's why I said it's real why does it
[45:16] have to be the
[45:17] word our soul is where your nature is
[45:21] programmed amen where who you are is
[45:25] programmed a lot of your nature you take
[45:28] from your DNA you'll find you'll see a
[45:30] whole family when they talk they all
[45:32] talk like this and you'll see the mother
[45:34] does that all the children talk like
[45:37] that oh one hand here like that oh you
[45:40] just see it in the DNA they have this
[45:42] thing that happens it's transferred by
[45:44] DNA but do you know your DNA has
[45:47] information coded in you in the genes of
[45:50] your father and your mother and it it
[45:54] very much affects how you think and feel
[45:57] and react to life around your DNA has
[46:00] has information from your ancestors
[46:02] which is passed down to you your DNA has
[46:04] the viruses that your great great great
[46:06] ancestors pass down to you it's in the
[46:10] it's encoded in the DNA you are
[46:12] susceptible to certain things in your
[46:14] blood because of what's in your DNA but
[46:17] do you know that words seem to have the
[46:20] power to even make you live contrary to
[46:23] the nature of your
[46:25] DNA
[46:27] Amen in other words words can recode
[46:31] [Music]
[46:34] you you know that at one time people
[46:37] people um believed in something and they
[46:41] believed in that wholeheartedly and the
[46:43] Next Generation began to talk them out
[46:45] of it and by the Next Generation they
[46:47] were not believing that anymore they
[46:49] were not even living by it because the
[46:52] words that passed down the information
[46:55] recoded them
[46:57] yeah that's how powerful it is let's
[47:00] Express a little bit more of it first
[47:02] let's talk about the negative effects of
[47:05] words you'll notice children that are
[47:08] brought up with harsh words develop
[47:11] characters that show low
[47:13] self-esteem anger rage nervousness
[47:17] cruelty to others if you if you
[47:20] constantly bringing up a child with
[47:22] sarcasm or constantly berating them for
[47:25] something you'll see those children when
[47:26] they come and if someone
[47:28] shouts they Flinch it's the words that
[47:32] that's that's been encoded into them
[47:34] daily that creates bodily reaction those
[47:38] words and the way they are being
[47:40] parented is going to affect their
[47:42] interpretation when they listen to other
[47:45] people it so affects your being that it
[47:49] affects your interpretation of any words
[47:51] you hear or
[47:54] read That's How negative words words
[47:57] affect children you can actually tell
[47:59] you walk into a classroom of children at
[48:01] a school and you can tell immediately by
[48:04] their reaction to a teacher what their
[48:06] word is at
[48:09] home children brought up with lies and
[48:13] deceptive language grow up being
[48:15] deceptive and
[48:17] manipulative and never understanding the
[48:19] value of Truth you can just never get
[48:22] the truth out of them and it seems like
[48:24] they're always wheeling and dealing like
[48:27] to be able to get something they have to
[48:28] come up with elaborate stories and
[48:31] because from the beginning they're just
[48:33] brought up with lies and
[48:34] deception the word that they receive in
[48:37] their home is coding
[48:40] them we have chosen to set limits with
[48:43] words you don't realize how much we do
[48:45] this we made it a norm like for example
[48:48] in your American society I remember
[48:49] reading uh from from the time I was a
[48:52] child I think reading American
[48:54] literature where you had when it came to
[48:57] like courtship and dating I don't even
[49:00] remember what it means but what it you
[49:03] define a relationship when you say
[49:04] you're talking to her what does that
[49:08] mean but it seems like oh we're just
[49:10] talking I know okay you're having
[49:12] conversation no no that's a definition
[49:14] of a
[49:16] relationship uh and and then when it's
[49:18] dating I don't and then when it's
[49:20] committed it's got another it's like
[49:22] you've got to even Define your
[49:24] relationship with a person by words
[49:27] and it's you say oh okay that's funny
[49:30] it's amusing it's not just amusing it's
[49:32] very important because the public seems
[49:34] to need to know whether you're
[49:38] talking because now how seriously do we
[49:41] take you or we're just talking to each
[49:43] other and then do not say you love her
[49:48] if you're just
[49:50] talking why what's the
[49:52] problem right because just saying those
[49:55] words produces an incredible power that
[49:59] happens between the two of them and
[50:01] people and Society are going to hold you
[50:03] to it because now it's like okay once
[50:05] you said you love her you're married to
[50:07] her it's over it's finished you can
[50:08] never go and and be with anyone else
[50:10] again so just guard yourself if you're
[50:12] just talking don't say you love
[50:15] her
[50:16] words and does it really but it was like
[50:20] Dad Mom but what if I feel it I'm not
[50:23] allowed to say it no no no no just
[50:25] protect yourself because once you say it
[50:26] it's over but you're feeling
[50:30] it right words we play Such value on
[50:35] those words I love
[50:37] you in a relationship well today I tell
[50:40] you it's it's ridiculous everywhere you
[50:42] go if you at work at families people who
[50:44] don't love you say love
[50:47] you it's used like it's so offhandedly
[50:50] love you love you love you it's not even
[50:53] carrying any value anymore because it's
[50:55] become a new greeting you you might as
[50:56] well say
[50:59] hello you know but why do you think that
[51:02] we are exclusive the girl says you know
[51:04] one person will say why do you think we
[51:06] are exclusive I didn't even tell you I
[51:08] loved you and she's saying but your
[51:11] actions prove to me I can feel that you
[51:14] love me but I didn't say
[51:16] it that's the value of the
[51:19] words it's at that point to guard your
[51:22] feelings and be cautious and but we will
[51:24] insist that words must def find the
[51:27] status of our
[51:29] relationship did you realize you do that
[51:33] but I didn't say it the negative effects
[51:35] of words Saints are
[51:38] immense words cause Wars you see those
[51:42] silly games which politicians
[51:44] play press
[51:46] conferences why do they have to have a
[51:48] press conference when one guy test
[51:50] missiles in the
[51:52] ocean because words are supposed to
[51:55] appease him and is not even speaking to
[51:57] him they're speaking to the media in
[51:59] their country to appease a guy across
[52:01] the ocean because he testified missiles
[52:04] into the ocean that's the games
[52:06] politicians play they use words to
[52:09] prevent Wars to cause Wars to cause
[52:12] stock markets to react just
[52:15] words words can make grain go up and
[52:18] down in the stock market
[52:23] grain they cause separation words say sa
[52:27] cause separation of
[52:29] families words cause isolation of
[52:32] individuals words causes depression in
[52:35] individuals words causes
[52:39] anxiety do you understand are you
[52:41] getting to understand why word is so
[52:44] important to the human
[52:46] being on the other hand if you look at
[52:49] the positive effect of words positive
[52:52] effect of words is spoken of in the
[52:54] Bible constantly proverbs 15:4 says a
[52:57] wholesome tongue is a tree of
[53:02] life a wholesome what is that mean it's
[53:04] going to bring forth fruit it's a tree
[53:07] of life a wholesome tongue a tongue that
[53:10] speaks goodly words is a tree of
[53:13] life
[53:15] amazing and now watch a child who is
[53:17] brought up with good speech good
[53:20] language no swearing no slang words of
[53:24] honesty words of integrity that child
[53:27] will grow up secure confident happy
[53:32] unstressed no depression no need to lie
[53:35] comfortable telling the truth
[53:37] comfortable confessing when is wrong
[53:39] easily apologizing easily loving someone
[53:43] easy communicating sitting comfortably
[53:46] across a table no hidden agenda just
[53:49] being brought up with positive
[53:53] words and I don't mean
[53:56] perverted praise like when he like when
[54:00] he makes something that's absolutely
[54:01] ugly and he say wow you're the best in
[54:03] the
[54:04] world you're
[54:06] amazing no you should actually that's
[54:08] good son but you can do
[54:10] better that's better words right and
[54:15] know if he runs in a in an athletic race
[54:17] at school and he comes last you take him
[54:19] out for an ice cream and say well you're
[54:21] fantastic you came out last don't worry
[54:23] you try you need a trophy for trying
[54:26] he's going to have no problem coming out
[54:28] last for the rest of his life you're not
[54:31] telling him the
[54:33] truth man I know your American public is
[54:38] is going wild with that kind of thing
[54:40] positive reinforcement and I don't know
[54:42] what else right so a child brought up
[54:46] with good speech the child will become a
[54:49] teenager that will not be confused in
[54:51] relationships but will be able to read
[54:53] people correctly and be able to tell
[54:55] lies from truth and not be manipulated
[54:58] by deceivers not be taken by pedophiles
[55:02] and all that they'll know hey this is
[55:04] what mom and dad taught me there's the
[55:07] distance here's what I've learned in the
[55:09] word here's the distance they'll be able
[55:11] to make healthy boundaries teach them
[55:14] good speech amen incredible yeah the
[55:18] child will not need to seek fulfillment
[55:20] in drugs and alcohol and fornication if
[55:23] you see people who are able to
[55:25] communicate at well they are well set
[55:29] together people because they were grown
[55:31] up with real
[55:33] word good
[55:36] word right you should know this because
[55:39] the Lord Jesus said word is
[55:42] a
[55:44] seed you know that and a seed if it's
[55:47] planted will bring forth if it's
[55:50] negative word it's still negative seed
[55:53] if it's positive word it's positive seed
[55:55] we're not just talking about the Bible
[55:58] we're talking about your everyday
[56:00] speech it's all sewing
[56:04] seed all right let's go to the danger of
[56:08] how words are expressed so have you ever
[56:10] heard people tell you know when you're
[56:12] talking to someone you say something to
[56:13] someone and uh and they tell you you
[56:17] just said something to them and they say
[56:19] to you so what are you trying to
[56:22] say what are you trying to say and
[56:25] you're saying I just told you what I
[56:27] wanted to say what do you mean what am I
[56:29] trying to say and why are they saying
[56:32] that you are trying to say something
[56:34] when you just said it are you not
[56:36] speaking clearly enough even though you
[56:39] felt like you said exactly what you mean
[56:41] they're saying what are you trying to
[56:43] say can see some of you know what I'm
[56:45] talking
[56:46] about it's because the way you express
[56:50] words causes those listening to
[56:54] misinterpret what you saying and change
[56:56] your meaning it's like saying I love
[57:00] you they're going to ask you what you're
[57:02] trying to say right because the way
[57:05] you're saying it is is affecting your
[57:09] message what you're transferring to them
[57:12] right and it's because the way you
[57:14] express your words causes those
[57:16] listening to misinterpret what you were
[57:18] saying and changing your meaning do you
[57:21] realize preachers for preachers like us
[57:24] how often we are in peril because every
[57:26] time we're behind here we worried about
[57:28] what you think we are trying to
[57:30] say all the
[57:33] time probably the most criticized people
[57:35] on the planet are the preachers of the
[57:38] message so it's because the way you
[57:41] express your words now here's something
[57:44] and this is the beautiful part of it
[57:46] what you don't realize is that to every
[57:50] word you speak magically it's a bad word
[57:53] but I I can't find another one right now
[57:56] magically to those words that you are
[57:58] speaking are attached
[58:00] emotions and those emotions go into the
[58:03] person who's listening and can cause
[58:05] them to misinterpret or not even get
[58:07] your meaning purely because you're
[58:09] adding emotion into
[58:13] it suddenly it's so difficult to speak
[58:16] to people right and you got to say to
[58:19] someone you know what I can't speak to
[58:21] you right now cuz I'm emotional I need
[58:23] to calm down a little bit or you say to
[58:25] them you need to calm down a little bit
[58:27] before we talk about this because
[58:29] anything I say because of your emotions
[58:31] you're going to misinterpret it right
[58:33] and you're going to not get what I mean
[58:35] right so amazingly two words emotion is
[58:39] added and actually can change the
[58:40] meaning so and it's like you know if a
[58:43] preacher if he attaches to little
[58:46] emotions then he's
[58:48] boring
[58:50] right and then if he adds too much of
[58:52] emotion then you lose the point of what
[58:55] he's saying
[58:57] yes when you go out there oh powerful
[58:59] service brother oh it was just amazing
[59:01] what did he say
[59:03] uh what did he start what scripture you
[59:06] start with oh no but it was powerful
[59:10] because he added more emotions into it
[59:12] than actual
[59:14] substance and so what did you come out
[59:16] with what what were you coded in with
[59:18] when you came out of the service that
[59:20] was full of emotions you can barely
[59:22] remember it's it's it hasn't even
[59:24] changed your life it just changed your
[59:27] thinking for a little moment while you
[59:28] were Anointed with
[59:33] something every inflection of the word
[59:36] every connotation every facial
[59:38] expression can affect how words are
[59:41] interpreted by you so I've always felt
[59:44] that the reason why I started with that
[59:46] introduction I've always felt that we're
[59:48] missing something when it comes to the
[59:50] word of God because the logos is the
[59:54] word amen am amen why it has to be the
[59:58] word the logos is the word right in the
[1:00:01] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:00:03] God and the Word was God in the
[1:00:05] beginning was the logos the logos was
[1:00:07] with God and the logos was God that's
[1:00:10] why he said the logos your logos is the
[1:00:13] god of your being yes sir and we want to
[1:00:16] make that real to you this morning so no
[1:00:18] matter how much we quote John 1:1 we
[1:00:21] seem to be missing something we we enjoy
[1:00:24] it we say Amen to it we believe it but
[1:00:26] it's just like something like slightly
[1:00:29] out of our reach right then we read that
[1:00:32] scripture that says by the foolishness
[1:00:34] of preaching God chooses to save the
[1:00:38] souls what does it mean by save brother
[1:00:40] bam said save is
[1:00:42] SoDo in the Greek which means
[1:00:45] healing God by the listen you're not a
[1:00:49] child of hell you you realize you your
[1:00:53] your Gene seed in your heart was before
[1:00:55] the found foundation of the world it was
[1:00:57] in him that means when it came into you
[1:00:59] you were never going to hell in the
[1:01:00] first place even though death was
[1:01:02] attached to you right so you're not
[1:01:05] saved from hell you're being healed by
[1:01:08] the
[1:01:09] word by the foolishness of preaching so
[1:01:12] what you're coming here for every day
[1:01:14] every time you come to church is healing
[1:01:17] we're constantly being healed you
[1:01:19] understand what it means by when he
[1:01:21] spoke to the woman and said she shall be
[1:01:22] healed in childbearing saved in
[1:01:25] childbearing
[1:01:26] because at that time the death rate
[1:01:28] among women at child birth was terrible
[1:01:30] it was like both mother and baby could
[1:01:33] die or mother could die and baby would
[1:01:34] survive or so on right but if they
[1:01:37] stayed steadfast to the Lord they would
[1:01:39] be healed in childbearing they would be
[1:01:41] saved in childbearing of course that
[1:01:43] scripture can be applied spiritually too
[1:01:45] I know you're good at that we know that
[1:01:48] save means heal it means the word that
[1:01:51] we believe has the power to heal us from
[1:01:55] something
[1:01:57] and let's not live under any illusion
[1:02:00] when we grow up from a child you are
[1:02:03] being diseased you are being diseased by
[1:02:06] the country you live in the city you
[1:02:08] live in the race you were born into the
[1:02:11] culture you are born into the family you
[1:02:14] live with the education you receive the
[1:02:17] place where you work you are being
[1:02:18] diseased every day there is only one
[1:02:23] salvation and it's the word of God and
[1:02:25] it's going to take the foolishness of
[1:02:27] preaching to do
[1:02:28] so glory to God that's why God
[1:02:32] instituted the foolishness of
[1:02:34] preaching do you find it do you not find
[1:02:38] it odd that preaching changes
[1:02:43] Hearts teaching of the word changes
[1:02:47] Hearts I know some of you some of you
[1:02:50] wives can say you know I try to get my
[1:02:52] husband to change for like 20 years and
[1:02:55] then he comes into the service
[1:02:58] and right vice versa husband I try to
[1:03:02] get my wife I try to get my child CH
[1:03:04] you've been trying you've been working
[1:03:05] programs you've been reading the books
[1:03:07] called the strong willed child God help
[1:03:10] us and you've been you labor for 10
[1:03:13] years and then there comes a preaching
[1:03:15] of the word and
[1:03:17] Bam life
[1:03:19] changed because it heals the word heals
[1:03:24] the word changes heart heart it changes
[1:03:27] nature glory to God literally gives
[1:03:30] people a change of heart in the same way
[1:03:33] preaching that has deception can draw
[1:03:36] man's Hearts away from truth and when
[1:03:40] preaching draws man's heart away from
[1:03:42] truth it puts in it a disease that comes
[1:03:45] from The Fifth Dimension because that's
[1:03:47] what deceptive word is yeah it's from
[1:03:49] The Fifth Dimension it's a it's word
[1:03:52] that diseases the soul it's word that
[1:03:54] brings in demonology it what it's word
[1:03:56] that brings in unbelief doubt any human
[1:04:00] being that lives with doubt and fear in
[1:04:02] their soul is someone who always looking
[1:04:04] over his back someone who's always
[1:04:05] nervous someone who's always
[1:04:07] misinterpreting everything anybody says
[1:04:10] someone who's always Moody someone who
[1:04:12] can never be happy even about a colorful
[1:04:14] birthday present it's like you give them
[1:04:17] a birthday present thinking oh now I
[1:04:18] have to buy something for
[1:04:22] them just can't appreciate the moment
[1:04:26] right somebody would some of you know
[1:04:28] what I'm talking
[1:04:30] about
[1:04:32] amen words in history so it's not a
[1:04:37] mystery to us that in the Bible God had
[1:04:42] to give 10
[1:04:44] commandments to change the nature of
[1:04:48] man God used
[1:04:51] words 10 commandments and asked them to
[1:04:54] keep my word words abide in my words
[1:04:58] keep repeating my words come into the
[1:05:01] Tabernacle three times a year and hear
[1:05:03] my words make sure every boy has
[1:05:06] frontlets on his right hand and upon his
[1:05:08] forehead and take out those parchments
[1:05:10] and read the
[1:05:12] words God instituted that the
[1:05:15] Commandments in written word form to
[1:05:18] help transform them from degenerate
[1:05:20] Society into Holiness am words
[1:05:26] you know I I did this one series over
[1:05:28] December it was a fun series for our
[1:05:29] youth and the title of it was why
[1:05:31] couldn't God just dot dot dot and I said
[1:05:34] ask the questions and and of course the
[1:05:37] first question was why couldn't God just
[1:05:39] not have created the
[1:05:41] devil and of course we went through they
[1:05:43] just had fun with it and it was
[1:05:45] fantastic and but but this is it why
[1:05:47] couldn't God just wave a wand and and
[1:05:49] heal us but he insists on using Word
[1:05:57] yeah just for our
[1:06:00] understanding magic wands oh no I'd
[1:06:05] rather have the word there's far
[1:06:08] more uh enjoyment in the word there's
[1:06:12] far more satisfaction in the word
[1:06:14] there's far more appreciation for God's
[1:06:16] nature in the word amen I don't need to
[1:06:18] see Miracles I need more of his word so
[1:06:21] I can become that Miracle god let's go
[1:06:24] to Psalm 19
[1:06:29] just to show you because we've speaking
[1:06:30] about the Ten
[1:06:31] Commandments the words of The
[1:06:33] Commandments the levitical law and the
[1:06:35] words of Deuteronomy actually brought
[1:06:37] peace among them and made them better
[1:06:40] humans you know I I feel like I got to
[1:06:41] stop here before we read that scripture
[1:06:43] and just tell
[1:06:46] you the world before the levitical law
[1:06:50] was diseased by
[1:06:53] tribalism All Humans created tribes in
[1:06:56] fact whatever surname you have here as
[1:06:58] you're sitting here today originates
[1:07:00] from a tribe and you're once part of a
[1:07:03] clan if you're Anglo-Saxon or european
[1:07:05] descent you come from a clan if you're
[1:07:07] from Africa you come from a clan or a
[1:07:09] tribe and and it's um there is no such
[1:07:13] thing as racism that racism is a lie of
[1:07:16] politics it's what is really called
[1:07:19] tribalism right racism there if you
[1:07:23] don't like uh a person uh it's because
[1:07:27] you're a human with preference it's not
[1:07:29] racism racism is when you legislate
[1:07:31] something against another race yeah
[1:07:34] right that's racism that's deliberately
[1:07:37] using the law to put down someone that
[1:07:39] we did have in a part but most people
[1:07:42] just don't like things about other
[1:07:44] people I don't like my own race when
[1:07:46] they don't smell nice you know if they
[1:07:49] eat weird things or that doesn't mean
[1:07:52] I'm racist towards him it doesn't matter
[1:07:54] who I mean if I get in elevator and a
[1:07:56] guy is smelling of sweat that he worked
[1:07:58] in I'm not uncomfortable you know and
[1:08:01] it's not racism it's simply human to be
[1:08:05] that way if I don't like the way someone
[1:08:07] talks someone if I grow up in a family
[1:08:09] and someone talks really loud shouting
[1:08:10] all the time you'll see it in my face I
[1:08:13] get grumpy
[1:08:14] instantly and and yet and if someone is
[1:08:17] is is a person who just talks and laughs
[1:08:20] while he
[1:08:21] talks me personally I've struggled to
[1:08:24] keep up with him
[1:08:25] he's such a jovial character I'm so
[1:08:27] happy for him but you know what calm
[1:08:29] down a bit so I can understand what
[1:08:30] you're saying that isn't racism it's
[1:08:34] just being human each one of us likes
[1:08:37] different things and the thing about
[1:08:38] tribalism is we choose our tribes based
[1:08:41] on our survival we TR choose our tribes
[1:08:44] based on convenience to protect a
[1:08:46] certain way of
[1:08:48] life so what what a lot of Christians
[1:08:51] don't appreciate about the levitical law
[1:08:54] is that for the first time it created a
[1:08:57] condition where 12 different tribes
[1:09:00] lived in Perfect Harmony that never
[1:09:04] existed in a history of mankind because
[1:09:07] tribes were always trying to take Land
[1:09:09] from the other one because of food
[1:09:11] resources water rights all that they
[1:09:13] were always fighting I mean look what
[1:09:15] even happened here in America you
[1:09:16] literally had towns with a street and
[1:09:18] Catholics and one side and Protestants
[1:09:20] on the other those were two tribes of
[1:09:23] people and then other Europeans moved in
[1:09:26] and then there was issues with the Irish
[1:09:27] and the swedes and the Italians and they
[1:09:30] all have their tribes it wasn't racism
[1:09:33] it was tribalism and they had no word to
[1:09:36] bring peace among them yeah the word of
[1:09:38] the levitical order taught them about
[1:09:41] marriages about food about uh producing
[1:09:45] about taxes about religion the levitical
[1:09:49] law was the first wisdom of the world
[1:09:52] that brought peace amongst tribes by the
[1:09:55] way this is why Babylon took Israel this
[1:09:58] is why Greece took Israel why mid
[1:10:02] Persians took Israel they wanted the
[1:10:05] law the law of Moses redid their
[1:10:10] constitutions whenever they like when
[1:10:12] they took the bab the Babylonians took
[1:10:14] the Hebrew Boys in they were watching
[1:10:16] the law and they made Daniel one of
[1:10:19] their advisers eventually he became the
[1:10:22] chief advisor why because of the law of
[1:10:24] Moses
[1:10:25] there was never a constitution that
[1:10:28] existed in history that brought peace
[1:10:31] among people like the law of God that's
[1:10:34] why it's of so such value and then when
[1:10:36] Christianity came in because people
[1:10:39] obviously look at that Roman Empire
[1:10:41] destroying everything building
[1:10:43] everything up when Christianity came in
[1:10:45] it redid
[1:10:47] Constitution can can you really fathom
[1:10:51] that the simple word of this Hebrew from
[1:10:53] Israel which was pre over just 3 and 1
[1:10:56] half years transform the Roman
[1:11:00] Empire you know what the if you study
[1:11:03] the Roman Empire and see what it was to
[1:11:05] transform it to Peaceful Republic was
[1:11:09] impossible Caesar Julius Caesar stood
[1:11:11] there in his Senate and half of his lazy
[1:11:13] senators were sitting there all we were
[1:11:15] interested in was money and lands and
[1:11:18] Corruption and he stood there thinking
[1:11:20] these guys are definitely going to turn
[1:11:22] against me they don't care about
[1:11:24] anything they con ution was all wrong
[1:11:26] but once Christianity came and stretched
[1:11:28] to the Western World It produced
[1:11:31] peaceful
[1:11:32] democracies it was the word of God of
[1:11:35] course they perverted it but without
[1:11:37] Christianity we' be we still be fighting
[1:11:39] those bloodthirsty
[1:11:42] Wars this is the truth the law of God
[1:11:45] brought peace among
[1:11:47] tribalism so the words of the
[1:11:49] Commandment the levitical law and the
[1:11:51] words of Deuteronomy brought peace among
[1:11:53] them and made better
[1:11:56] humans why does it have to be the
[1:11:58] word so let's read I Love This David
[1:12:02] saying the law of the Lord is perfect
[1:12:05] watch converting the
[1:12:08] soul the law of God changes your nature
[1:12:12] because your soul is the nature of the
[1:12:13] spirit converting the soul the testimony
[1:12:17] of the Lord is sure that sure means
[1:12:20] trustworthy yeah solid amen making wise
[1:12:24] the simple that means those of us who
[1:12:27] not educated didn't even know much in
[1:12:28] life just by hearing the word of God it
[1:12:31] makes you wise it fills you with wisdom
[1:12:34] we're talking brother Chad this morning
[1:12:36] and I said you know you can take a
[1:12:37] carpenter who has that much knowledge of
[1:12:40] wood and and his and his uh whatever
[1:12:43] tools he possesses but he's got that
[1:12:45] much wisdom and it makes him a brilliant
[1:12:47] Carpenter but you can have a guy comes
[1:12:49] out of college with that much knowledge
[1:12:51] and that much wisdom and is useless
[1:12:56] right making wise the simple because
[1:13:00] wisdom was there before knowledge was
[1:13:02] there wisdom put everything together
[1:13:06] right the statutes of the Lord are right
[1:13:09] rejoicing the heart can you see the
[1:13:11] positive effects of words upon the
[1:13:14] heart the Commandment of the Lord is
[1:13:17] pure that means it's single it's not
[1:13:20] corrupt it's not mixed it's pure
[1:13:23] enlightening the eyes I don't even need
[1:13:25] to preach on that because it's
[1:13:27] self-explanatory so David the king years
[1:13:31] later gives honor to the word knowing
[1:13:34] that it was by the word that order was
[1:13:37] brought into his kingdom he knew that
[1:13:39] that's why he gives honor to the word
[1:13:41] right while all other countries around
[1:13:43] them were struggling in their tribalism
[1:13:46] and mass and idolatry they just could
[1:13:49] never get it right Kings rise up Kings
[1:13:51] kill the other one then they got to kill
[1:13:53] each other's children to prevent that
[1:13:54] lineage can you imagine all the kingdoms
[1:13:56] around Israel that were just falling and
[1:13:58] rising and falling and Rising they were
[1:14:01] boted with veneral disease they were
[1:14:04] just um each one had his own Temple uh
[1:14:08] each Clan had their goddess their Temple
[1:14:10] their priesthood goddess Temple
[1:14:12] priesthood God Temple priesthood then
[1:14:14] the one said our God is the father of
[1:14:16] all your Gods so we have the most
[1:14:18] important this is what was going on for
[1:14:21] generations and they looked upon Israel
[1:14:23] and there are these people just
[1:14:25] flourishing under this law growing one
[1:14:28] Faith one
[1:14:30] Lord one law amen and all coming to
[1:14:34] Shiloh to bring the atonement uh one
[1:14:37] priesthood all United in one word and
[1:14:40] this country was growing and was
[1:14:43] becoming a threat to the whole world
[1:14:45] every time they grew someone had to come
[1:14:47] and take them over I mean come on why
[1:14:49] does Alexander the Great have to come
[1:14:50] and take over the small piece of of land
[1:14:53] it's so small yeah his it's going to
[1:14:55] take them over just 12 tribes in Perfect
[1:14:58] Harmony because they had
[1:15:01] word sought after the
[1:15:04] word think about this for 4,000 years
[1:15:08] Saints and this is the important thing
[1:15:10] there were no books for society the
[1:15:12] first mass-produced book was the
[1:15:14] Bible there were no books for 4,000
[1:15:17] years people couldn't read there were no
[1:15:20] books yet the importance of words seemed
[1:15:22] to be being built up to a place
[1:15:25] they were being built up to hear the
[1:15:27] word he was say come to the Tabernacle
[1:15:30] the seventh day shall be a solemn
[1:15:31] assembly and it shall be uh a time where
[1:15:35] the word is spoken so all imagine
[1:15:38] church for the Hebrews they no preachers
[1:15:42] do you realize this generation right now
[1:15:45] has been is the generation in God's
[1:15:48] economy that has the most teachers and
[1:15:50] preachers in a history of the Bible
[1:15:54] Moses was not a pre
[1:15:55] preacher he had to read the same law
[1:15:58] over and over and at the Sabbath all
[1:16:01] they had to do was read the law Moses
[1:16:03] didn't even say well what the law really
[1:16:05] means is this and can you type that with
[1:16:08] that he just every Sabbath they would
[1:16:12] just read the same thing and those
[1:16:14] people can you imagine those people
[1:16:15] sitting there never reading they can't
[1:16:18] read they talk by Grunts and groans and
[1:16:21] a few words here and there and now
[1:16:22] they're hearing this word this law being
[1:16:26] spoken and is changing their hearts Thou
[1:16:29] shalt not Thou shalt not Deuteronomy is
[1:16:32] being read telling them what to do how
[1:16:34] to how to handle the rent for the house
[1:16:37] upon a wall how to handle mold in your
[1:16:39] house what where did this come from when
[1:16:43] it turns this way it looks leprous the
[1:16:45] priest must burn down the place and
[1:16:47] break this out and they had no knowledge
[1:16:49] of all these things and the law was
[1:16:52] putting something into them that was
[1:16:54] bringing them cleanliness Holiness
[1:16:57] Healthy Living Word did all
[1:17:01] that amen no one else was going to
[1:17:03] convince them you know if the people saw
[1:17:06] mold growing in the damn corner of the
[1:17:08] house they thought
[1:17:10] demons what are we going to do do you
[1:17:13] know what you know why uh um in in
[1:17:16] European culture when you sneeze they
[1:17:19] say bless
[1:17:20] you yeah because they thought your
[1:17:22] spirit leaves and the devil
[1:17:25] catches it so you got to say bless you
[1:17:27] so as a spirit comes back because they
[1:17:30] believe spirit is the wind Ru in the
[1:17:32] Hebrew when you sneeze the the the
[1:17:34] spirit comes out so you have to say
[1:17:36] bless you
[1:17:38] gazuntite kti be well in the German and
[1:17:42] the Dutch and the Africans because uh
[1:17:45] you got to bless the person when they
[1:17:47] why why do they why do they say bless
[1:17:49] you because they didn't know what the
[1:17:50] flu was so they meet someone who had who
[1:17:53] had a flu virus and they they just
[1:17:55] realize if you come in contact with
[1:17:56] someone it jumps to you they thought
[1:17:58] it's demons they had no knowledge of
[1:18:00] viruses or anything God kept them away
[1:18:04] from all that with words you shall not
[1:18:07] touch any unclean thing if it's decayed
[1:18:09] you will you will quarantine yourself
[1:18:12] for 7 days without the camp wash
[1:18:14] everything with running water if there's
[1:18:16] mold in your house what does mold do
[1:18:17] produce respiratory disease if it turns
[1:18:20] this color or that color this is what
[1:18:22] the priest must do this is how you
[1:18:23] handle your marriages Where were humans
[1:18:26] going to get
[1:18:28] that it had to come from God who
[1:18:30] understood all Natures it transformed
[1:18:33] Natures it gave them intelligence beyond
[1:18:36] all human
[1:18:38] existence amen the Messiah It Was
[1:18:42] preparing them so this this uh group of
[1:18:45] people having heard the word It Was
[1:18:47] preparing them to hear the word of the
[1:18:48] Messiah who is going to come 4,000 years
[1:18:50] later 2,000 years
[1:18:51] later and then the Messiah comes and the
[1:18:54] Lord Jesus says my words that I speak
[1:18:57] unto you are spirit and life amen amen
[1:19:01] and we quote that every denomination
[1:19:03] quotes that but do we really appreciate
[1:19:06] what that means let's read thinking
[1:19:08] man's filter and I want to show you this
[1:19:10] brother B says down through the spirit
[1:19:13] then she can pull into her soul things
[1:19:16] that isn't of God and against his word
[1:19:19] if that's a taste in the soul it it can
[1:19:21] come through the taste see it can come
[1:19:23] through the think through the reason
[1:19:24] reing there's no harm in it I have taste
[1:19:26] I have feelings I have a feeling that
[1:19:28] this is all right she can come right on
[1:19:29] down through there and right into a soul
[1:19:31] and if a soul is of that type shows that
[1:19:34] she isn't drawing through God's filter
[1:19:36] the simple thing I want to show you
[1:19:37] there is that words become more complex
[1:19:39] and the more books were printed the
[1:19:42] Bible was being printed the law was
[1:19:44] being printed the more people started a
[1:19:47] were were being able to to read uh the
[1:19:49] written word began to change
[1:19:52] things why because written word can be
[1:19:56] misinterpreted this is the issue we have
[1:19:58] with word today and brother B is saying
[1:20:01] when you have something in your soul and
[1:20:04] you're drawing through that this is how
[1:20:06] people can can bring out things that
[1:20:08] isn't of God things that is against God
[1:20:11] when you're receiving word inside that
[1:20:13] is not of God you are going to bring
[1:20:15] things out of you that's not of God it's
[1:20:18] going to affect your nature it's going
[1:20:19] to affect your behavior it's going to
[1:20:21] affect your interpretation your thinking
[1:20:23] your emotions yeah that's why it's got
[1:20:26] to be word amen that must be restored to
[1:20:30] us amen written word was going to cause
[1:20:33] the problem of
[1:20:36] misinterpretation I mean if if if you
[1:20:38] got to say something to someone and they
[1:20:40] tell you what are you trying to say do
[1:20:42] you know what happens when you email
[1:20:43] someone to say I'm
[1:20:45] sorry or explain why you said what you
[1:20:48] said how well does that go for you or
[1:20:50] Whatsapp someone to make an apology or
[1:20:53] to or to explain something when they
[1:20:55] read and they let their wife read and
[1:20:58] someone else read you now get three
[1:21:01] different interpretations and what are
[1:21:02] they trying to say he thought he's
[1:21:04] making things right written word is just
[1:21:08] worse it made everything worse when the
[1:21:10] Bible was mass-produced we then
[1:21:12] developed 3,000 different Christian
[1:21:17] denominations a word should always have
[1:21:20] been delivered by Spoken Word it
[1:21:23] probably was a bad idea for the gospel
[1:21:25] to be printed but it is what it is amen
[1:21:28] so it caused all the problems we have in
[1:21:30] the message and Christianity Today then
[1:21:33] you wonder why do we make such a big
[1:21:36] deal about the opened
[1:21:39] book what does that mean what does
[1:21:42] opened book mean this is not a book that
[1:21:44] was closed and it's opened what do we
[1:21:47] say when we say the opened book when we
[1:21:50] say open book what makes it opened right
[1:21:54] it's because it is accompanied by the
[1:21:59] person who is that word and that's why
[1:22:03] when the book is opened and you receive
[1:22:05] the opened book you there's no way of
[1:22:10] misinterpreting because he is the
[1:22:12] revealer of his word right once you
[1:22:15] receive it and that's the code you
[1:22:17] receive for your being right you cannot
[1:22:20] receive doubt or unbelief with an open
[1:22:22] book amen and it comes in with
[1:22:25] transforming power beyond written
[1:22:28] word the open book makes the written
[1:22:31] word real glory to God so why do we make
[1:22:35] a such a big deal about Revelation
[1:22:38] because people who have taken written
[1:22:40] word and corrupted their souls by
[1:22:43] misinterpretation require Revelation to
[1:22:45] change that
[1:22:48] amen we are so that's why spoken word
[1:22:51] had to come in the end time we are so
[1:22:53] because only spoken word is going to
[1:22:55] give you the right revelation of the
[1:22:57] written word right and therefore you
[1:22:59] have the enemy who's not going to waste
[1:23:02] his chance he's going to come and use
[1:23:04] spoken word to destroy that that's right
[1:23:07] to make the written word even worse than
[1:23:10] that amen so we are so particular about
[1:23:14] words that we insist on understanding
[1:23:17] histories history the atmology of words
[1:23:20] where words derived from the Hebrew part
[1:23:22] of it the Greek part of it you know how
[1:23:25] uh it was formed what's the real meaning
[1:23:27] behind it why do we do
[1:23:30] this why can't we just live life amen
[1:23:33] why can we just make up our mind about
[1:23:34] this and why do we because a human
[1:23:37] attaches the greatest value to words
[1:23:41] right you may not think so but you do it
[1:23:44] every
[1:23:45] day every day you realize as a preacher
[1:23:49] you you come here and you and you call
[1:23:51] to pray let's say you call to open the
[1:23:53] Service in prayer right there your mind
[1:23:55] is going to a a a turmoil of what to
[1:23:58] say you might in one because we're
[1:24:01] humanistic you're thinking I want to
[1:24:03] pray to please God but I also don't want
[1:24:05] to use words to offend and I also want I
[1:24:08] might want to use words to impress I
[1:24:10] might want to use words to make the
[1:24:11] worship better I I might want to shout a
[1:24:13] little bit I might want to say things
[1:24:16] quiet a little bit I might want to say
[1:24:18] all that going in Split seconds just to
[1:24:21] say a few words amen
[1:24:25] and who's going to call a brother who
[1:24:26] comes here and prays Lord Jesus bless
[1:24:29] the service heal everybody amen church
[1:24:32] can say don't call him
[1:24:35] again and yet there's nothing wrong with
[1:24:37] what he
[1:24:41] said so you are constantly at war with
[1:24:45] your own Spirit every time you speak
[1:24:48] your mind is moving A Thousand Miles a
[1:24:51] minute if it was such a thing every time
[1:24:53] you say something to someone it's the
[1:24:55] thoughts are flowing and you're trying
[1:24:57] to get the best out of what you say to
[1:24:59] get the best reaction to get the best
[1:25:01] result for
[1:25:05] yourself Lord who that's why we're so
[1:25:08] particular about words and we insist on
[1:25:11] understanding histories of the words and
[1:25:13] of the prophets of the past so do you
[1:25:15] can you sense now why the second coming
[1:25:17] of the Lord to bring full Redemption has
[1:25:21] to be the word amen amen amen there was
[1:25:25] a holy ghost
[1:25:26] dispensation the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:29] Ghost was given to Ephesus to the
[1:25:31] Ephesian Church age because they were
[1:25:35] infants in the word you say infants yes
[1:25:39] all they remember when Paul and and
[1:25:42] Peter and all of them came out there
[1:25:44] were no message books there were no
[1:25:46] Bibles the church had no Bibles I mean
[1:25:49] those guys must have had the easiest
[1:25:51] time preaching they could say something
[1:25:52] and no one was checking quotes to
[1:25:54] correct
[1:25:55] them right and Paul preached 25 hours
[1:26:00] one guy died and they Ro Rose him up and
[1:26:03] preached
[1:26:05] again those people were so hungry but if
[1:26:08] they had their Bibles they' be sitting
[1:26:10] this guyy is taking a bit too long we
[1:26:12] know this already you know we checked
[1:26:14] and and then he says he says things he's
[1:26:16] not saying it right you know because
[1:26:18] they had access to if they had access to
[1:26:21] written word they were going to be
[1:26:22] correcting the preacher but people were
[1:26:24] so hungry they were coming to listen
[1:26:26] because every word of wisdom was so
[1:26:30] beautiful to the human
[1:26:32] spirit amen do you know those of you
[1:26:34] from European descent when your Lords
[1:26:38] and Ladies when they were dressed up in
[1:26:40] all their fineries and have a handsome
[1:26:42] man coming in the street with his
[1:26:44] impressive handlebar mustache and all
[1:26:46] goatey and if he says to his to the lady
[1:26:50] Thou Art Fair like the Dew upon the
[1:26:51] grass and she faints
[1:26:55] it's like give me a man with
[1:26:57] poetry it became a thing that men could
[1:27:01] speak poetry to us now poetry is like so
[1:27:03] feminine a guy who speaks poetry is
[1:27:05] weird but back then the ladies were
[1:27:08] fainting because a man could speak with
[1:27:11] eloquent Words which is why they would
[1:27:13] stand in the street and say good
[1:27:16] morning ma'am you look lovely today
[1:27:20] today try that with a woman you look
[1:27:22] lovely today what's the matter with you
[1:27:26] weird person but that's how it was
[1:27:28] because men had to have access to
[1:27:30] beautiful words to woo the heart of a
[1:27:32] female and females realized they wanted
[1:27:35] men with words because they attach value
[1:27:38] to the
[1:27:42] words now here's the problem we're
[1:27:44] having with with um with word today in
[1:27:49] the message and in the church Christians
[1:27:51] today are Desiring signs wonders and
[1:27:56] experiences so we want to tell you we
[1:27:58] want to show you experience versus word
[1:28:01] because they feel like experience
[1:28:04] creates a bigger impact and let's prove
[1:28:06] it to you right so you can have a great
[1:28:08] experience that has great impact on your
[1:28:11] life maybe a healing maybe some prophecy
[1:28:13] maybe something that happened maybe you
[1:28:15] were a witness of something right and
[1:28:18] then later someone can come and totally
[1:28:21] remove the the effect of your experience
[1:28:23] by telling you something
[1:28:25] something proving to you that experience
[1:28:27] is absolutely
[1:28:28] nothing you know you see a you see
[1:28:30] something you see a miracle or let's say
[1:28:32] this somebody spoke in tongues and a
[1:28:34] prophecy came for you and somebody
[1:28:37] interpreted that prophecy and it's a
[1:28:39] message for you and you're now so
[1:28:40] concerned you know and this actual
[1:28:42] experience you were in the service you
[1:28:44] fell the weight of the Holy Ghost you
[1:28:45] fell convicted in your heart you uh you
[1:28:48] think I really have to solve it I really
[1:28:50] have to work on my life do something and
[1:28:52] then someone comes and tells you you
[1:28:53] know we actually know that person
[1:28:55] there's something wrong in their life
[1:28:58] that's it experience gone
[1:29:02] words all that you felt in the service
[1:29:05] all that you thought the prophecy meant
[1:29:06] you
[1:29:07] disappears because words were told you
[1:29:10] to discredit a
[1:29:12] person experience is
[1:29:15] nothing it experience only uh uh Works
[1:29:18] to confirm something that was already
[1:29:22] given to you by word not the other way
[1:29:24] around
[1:29:25] right personal experience can serve well
[1:29:28] to solidify your understanding if that
[1:29:31] understanding is backed by a particular
[1:29:33] experience related to something God has
[1:29:36] revealed to you not the other way around
[1:29:39] s why because whatever people are told
[1:29:42] or whatever they hear whatever spoken
[1:29:44] word they receive spoken word is the
[1:29:46] Original Seed amen not written word
[1:29:50] right spoken word is the most powerful
[1:29:53] it changes
[1:29:54] nature and they tend to live by it and
[1:29:57] believe it words can make them even deny
[1:30:00] an
[1:30:01] experience you know it's like if you
[1:30:04] ever been to a courtroom and uh there's
[1:30:07] a witness who saw an accident and uh he
[1:30:10] knows he says I saw what happened this
[1:30:12] guy went through a red light he turned
[1:30:14] right he was not even using his his uh
[1:30:17] his indicators we call it in South
[1:30:19] Africa I know what you call it here
[1:30:21] flickers what is it turn signal oh
[1:30:25] that's so
[1:30:26] long turn signal we call it
[1:30:30] indicators our word sounds
[1:30:33] better so anyway he didn't even use his
[1:30:36] turn signal and he just went through and
[1:30:38] I saw that he was moving at at a great
[1:30:40] speed and the and the the the prosecutor
[1:30:43] or the defendant's lawyer comes to you
[1:30:45] and says so where exactly were you or I
[1:30:49] was standing over there uh were there
[1:30:51] any people in your
[1:30:52] way uh wasn't there a crowd according to
[1:30:55] the cameras we saw there was a crowd
[1:30:57] around you um and uh are you a
[1:31:01] mathematician uh do you know about
[1:31:03] acceleration do you know how could you
[1:31:05] tell what speed he was traveling at I'm
[1:31:08] a driver for 20 years I should know no
[1:31:10] you don't suddenly his experience and
[1:31:14] his witness starts changing because the
[1:31:16] the defendant's lawyer is putting doubt
[1:31:17] in his mind about what he saw and what
[1:31:19] he knows by the way what color was the
[1:31:22] car uh it seemed like like a it seemed
[1:31:25] like a like a steel gr it seemed like
[1:31:28] are you
[1:31:30] sure that's what lawyers do and then uh
[1:31:34] he turned right and and if he turned
[1:31:36] right and there were people in front of
[1:31:37] you how do you know he wasn't using his
[1:31:39] turn
[1:31:41] signal you know because there were
[1:31:42] people walking across this intersection
[1:31:45] and and how did you know they will put
[1:31:47] words in your mind that makes you deny
[1:31:50] what you even
[1:31:52] saw and you'll up believing it and then
[1:31:55] you walk away you came up there to the
[1:31:57] witness stand like this I'm ready for
[1:31:58] you you walk out
[1:32:00] like what just
[1:32:02] happened right and this is what happens
[1:32:05] when people come to church and you feel
[1:32:08] strong in a conviction about something
[1:32:09] you witness you come ready to testify
[1:32:11] and the Deacon tells you you know what I
[1:32:13] don't think it's a good day for you to
[1:32:15] do that and then you downcast you come
[1:32:18] into the service a powerful message and
[1:32:19] you feel like oh they denied me this you
[1:32:22] missed the whole thing just because of
[1:32:24] someone's words removes an entire
[1:32:28] experience words can make them even deny
[1:32:31] their experience the mystery of it
[1:32:33] Saints is words are the most powerful
[1:32:36] because when they are believed they are
[1:32:39] so powerful as as when they are rejected
[1:32:42] when a person believes what they've been
[1:32:44] told it inscribes a particular nature
[1:32:47] into that Soul which you will live by
[1:32:51] thereafter it drives your mind to think
[1:32:53] in a a certain way to interpret life in
[1:32:56] a certain way to interpret reality in a
[1:32:59] certain way that nature produces a new
[1:33:02] set of characteristics it can produce
[1:33:04] anger sadness uh irritation agitation
[1:33:08] whatever kind of nature just the words
[1:33:11] that were imprinted inscribed into your
[1:33:14] soul but think of what happens when that
[1:33:16] same word is rejected it produces a
[1:33:19] different character in The Soul
[1:33:20] resulting in different characteristics
[1:33:22] and a different path of
[1:33:26] life than believing and accepting
[1:33:29] rejecting a new character same
[1:33:35] word so this is what I want to bring to
[1:33:37] you all right let's go to what it really
[1:33:41] does word brings
[1:33:44] meaning we want to break this down even
[1:33:47] further so when you consider words as
[1:33:50] letter form some would say it's not all
[1:33:53] that powerful because you know what
[1:33:55] people who you there's people who use
[1:33:57] sign language right so it's not really
[1:33:59] letter I was speaking to our brother who
[1:34:01] was able to sign the other night and we
[1:34:03] were talking about that and I I
[1:34:05] mentioned that as well so what words so
[1:34:09] word is beyond even letter and even
[1:34:11] speech because word can even be signed
[1:34:14] right right you can use sign language
[1:34:16] for people who can't hear or speak and
[1:34:19] still word is transferred to a person
[1:34:21] and it can change in nature yeah yeah
[1:34:24] right so if word can transcend even what
[1:34:27] is written or what is spoken it moves us
[1:34:30] into other dimensions of
[1:34:33] word so we consider that the Bible tells
[1:34:36] us that in the beginning was the word
[1:34:39] and the Word was God the word was with
[1:34:41] God and the Word was God and that was
[1:34:43] before Earthly languages was
[1:34:47] formed true amen the word himself like I
[1:34:52] said the other night did God say let
[1:34:54] there be light in
[1:34:56] English no not even Hebrew none of that
[1:34:59] was formed the Catholics had no right to
[1:35:01] turn Latin into the holy language
[1:35:03] because God never even spoke
[1:35:06] Latin just stop and think about it for a
[1:35:09] second the Word was
[1:35:14] God what does that mean to
[1:35:16] you so word is not just speech it's not
[1:35:20] just
[1:35:22] writing the word was God the word is God
[1:35:27] and it began as a thought and when it
[1:35:29] was expressed it BEC speech and then
[1:35:32] when speech is believed it becomes
[1:35:34] manifested amen amen so it began as a
[1:35:38] thought amen so what word really is so
[1:35:42] why does word become manifested why do
[1:35:44] you every single one of you listen to
[1:35:47] the word and then it becomes manifested
[1:35:49] why would a human do that what is a
[1:35:51] human seeking me meaning of
[1:35:55] life every human here and outside in the
[1:35:59] world wherever you are every person
[1:36:01] who's under depression every person
[1:36:03] whose mind is going insane every person
[1:36:06] who's having a birthday party right now
[1:36:08] every person who's trying to work right
[1:36:10] now and earn a living every single human
[1:36:12] is searching for meaning in life amen
[1:36:16] and they're looking for it everywhere
[1:36:18] those who have gone into alcoholism have
[1:36:20] given up trying to find meaning those
[1:36:23] who are to drugs have given up on trying
[1:36:25] to find meaning they didn't even find it
[1:36:27] or something that was given to them
[1:36:28] removed all meaning from life for them
[1:36:31] and they are living in a hopeless state
[1:36:34] but all humans are looking for
[1:36:37] meaning more than anything unlike other
[1:36:40] creatures humans want meaning in life
[1:36:43] they seem to want to to know everything
[1:36:45] they want to have meaning what does this
[1:36:47] mean what does this mean what do you
[1:36:49] mean right I wonder what that means a
[1:36:52] sign in the heaven what does that mean
[1:36:54] or the solar eclipse or the moon the red
[1:36:56] moon or this happening everything is
[1:36:59] meaning what does this mean what does
[1:37:00] that mean what does this
[1:37:02] mean and Christians who grow up under
[1:37:04] prophecy they're the worst ones
[1:37:06] everything means
[1:37:08] something brother Al I had a dream last
[1:37:11] night a black snake was chasing me what
[1:37:13] does that mean it means you're afraid of
[1:37:17] snakes that's what it means no could it
[1:37:20] be an evil spirit no you're afraid of
[1:37:22] snakes you have some anxiet in your life
[1:37:24] and it's expressing itself in your dream
[1:37:26] don't spiritualize it do you want it to
[1:37:28] be a prophecy of something is that going
[1:37:31] to give you more meaning but you're
[1:37:33] searching for meaning so every single
[1:37:35] dream becomes something Supernatural I
[1:37:38] tell our people just remember if you
[1:37:39] dream you can receive messages from both
[1:37:41] sides amen It Whatever dream if it
[1:37:44] doesn't tie up with the word don't form
[1:37:47] something out of it that's
[1:37:49] right search for meaning that's what
[1:37:52] they want all whole lifelong answers to
[1:37:54] question why how when how those of you
[1:38:00] who have Todd us that
[1:38:02] why why because I said so
[1:38:06] why it never ends you're just waiting
[1:38:09] Lord I'm waiting for this wise stage to
[1:38:10] go away just can't handle it anymore so
[1:38:14] the mystery in what word really is is
[1:38:17] meaning amen are you with us if you talk
[1:38:20] to a child and make a statement to them
[1:38:22] and you expect them to comply children
[1:38:25] are the
[1:38:26] best what do you
[1:38:29] mean what do you mean this actually will
[1:38:32] show you how good you are at
[1:38:35] communicating what you mean just talk to
[1:38:38] a child total five and seven that's the
[1:38:41] best age they're going to make you teach
[1:38:43] something in Simplicity you're going to
[1:38:45] have to dumb yourself down you're going
[1:38:47] to have to remove all your harsh words
[1:38:49] you're going to remove all your simple
[1:38:50] your your uh your your difficult
[1:38:52] language you're going to have to make it
[1:38:54] so simple you even have to get down to
[1:38:56] eye
[1:38:57] level eye to eye because you know the
[1:39:01] these Toddlers and and little ones
[1:39:03] they're always when you talk to them
[1:39:04] they're
[1:39:05] like like everything's shaking all over
[1:39:07] the place and they moving I'm talking to
[1:39:09] you you'll literally have to hold their
[1:39:11] face you want to get their meaning
[1:39:13] across to them because if you don't
[1:39:15] they're going to tell you what do you
[1:39:16] mean I didn't know what you mean I'm
[1:39:18] sorry I did that it's not my fault it's
[1:39:19] your fault you didn't tell me what you
[1:39:21] meant
[1:39:23] right from a child sayings what do you
[1:39:25] mean it simply means you need to express
[1:39:28] your thoughts a little better to create
[1:39:31] better understanding because until their
[1:39:35] child finds meaning in what you say it's
[1:39:38] they're not going to comply with
[1:39:40] you so more than likely if you're
[1:39:42] getting a rebellious child first check
[1:39:44] how much meaning you're giving them
[1:39:48] right you want them to have a certain
[1:39:50] Behavior you feel just telling them is
[1:39:52] good enough but I told you not to do
[1:39:55] that but why I want to I want to do it
[1:40:00] why should you not want to do
[1:40:02] it see that children are so beautiful in
[1:40:06] that they'll make you confront uh
[1:40:08] something to the finest detail of
[1:40:11] reality they don't just want to be told
[1:40:13] don't do that cuz I said so because even
[1:40:17] you don't do that when your pastor says
[1:40:20] so because you want meaning how how do I
[1:40:23] know that I must comply with
[1:40:26] that and and now as adults upon whose
[1:40:30] authority because that's a thing does
[1:40:33] that give you more meaning of what has
[1:40:35] been said if it's if it's spoken by
[1:40:36] someone more
[1:40:38] respectable even the simplest person can
[1:40:40] tell you something with meaning and if
[1:40:42] you value meaning you'll listen to it it
[1:40:45] doesn't even have to be a pastor or
[1:40:46] Deacon or a preacher that person's
[1:40:49] spoken word with reality behind it can
[1:40:52] give you meaning but here we are
[1:40:54] respector of persons because someone is
[1:40:57] more popular or someone is a higher
[1:40:59] degree then we take what and when you do
[1:41:02] that you are not receiving something
[1:41:04] with meaning amen every human is looking
[1:41:08] for meaning that's what the word really
[1:41:10] is that's the difference between the
[1:41:12] word that is confusing word of the
[1:41:14] educated word of man that comes from the
[1:41:16] word of God that's the difference the
[1:41:19] word of God carries real meaning amen
[1:41:22] that's why it has to be the word yes sir
[1:41:25] when did meaning lose its importance to
[1:41:28] humans right because that's what's
[1:41:30] happening today right I mean look at how
[1:41:32] they're changing
[1:41:34] language literally changing language
[1:41:36] today you can't even speak the truth
[1:41:40] this woke
[1:41:42] language is actually sleep language it's
[1:41:45] not woke it's not a they're saying they
[1:41:47] woke up it looks like they're they're
[1:41:49] tranquilized yeah they don't even know
[1:41:51] what reality is yeah
[1:41:53] right people can so easily choose to
[1:41:55] follow something that has absolutely no
[1:41:59] meaning brother Chad and I were
[1:42:01] discussing he didn't even know I was
[1:42:02] going to talk about this but we were
[1:42:04] talking about the lack of respect among
[1:42:07] people and the way we um you know the
[1:42:11] the the way uh teenagers are talking the
[1:42:13] way public is talking there was a time
[1:42:16] where we we we strove for good speech
[1:42:20] now we like cutting things everywhere
[1:42:23] words are cut in half you know there's
[1:42:26] there's they're communicating over
[1:42:27] social media someone sends you a
[1:42:30] meme what is a
[1:42:33] meme half the time when I get send
[1:42:35] things I've going to say back what does
[1:42:37] this mean I don't know what you saying
[1:42:39] am I supposed to laugh at this or how am
[1:42:41] I supposed to respond I don't know you
[1:42:43] know and and this is what's happening
[1:42:45] today language is just being
[1:42:48] obliterated it's like it's like so
[1:42:50] perverted you you can't even talk like
[1:42:52] them anymore
[1:42:54] right more and more people don't care
[1:42:57] for meaning anymore and that's where I
[1:42:59] believe the lack of interest in the word
[1:43:01] of God in Messi's churches is coming
[1:43:04] from because they're not seeking for
[1:43:06] meaning they think they've got something
[1:43:09] and when they thought they had it they
[1:43:10] didn't accept the open book they didn't
[1:43:13] that's what the Lord said about David
[1:43:15] that's what the prophet said they
[1:43:16] thought they had the word that's why
[1:43:19] they didn't receive it what they
[1:43:21] attached a certain meaning to something
[1:43:23] just because brothers so and so started
[1:43:25] a Doctrine they attached meaning to that
[1:43:27] they thought this works for us let's
[1:43:28] form our tribe our camp around that and
[1:43:31] let's persecute all other camps and then
[1:43:34] it never works because it doesn't have
[1:43:36] real meaning then it produces a certain
[1:43:39] kind of character and a certain path of
[1:43:41] life and eventually the church breaks
[1:43:43] down people backslide because they're
[1:43:46] taking things without the real meaning
[1:43:48] which is why it must take the word here
[1:43:52] in the end time
[1:43:54] the enemy was so poisoned the soul of
[1:43:56] man that he has lost that desire for
[1:43:59] meaning and feels temporarily satisfied
[1:44:02] living without meaning you ever see
[1:44:04] people walking around
[1:44:07] aimlessly you know life not knowing what
[1:44:10] to do not having a clue what to do our
[1:44:14] our grandparents were already married by
[1:44:17] 16 had jobs building houses you know and
[1:44:21] today children are struggling to find
[1:44:23] meaning in life because we're creating
[1:44:26] systems that's dictating something to
[1:44:28] them removing the original meaning of
[1:44:30] life and you're educating them this
[1:44:33] meaning is being imprinted into them by
[1:44:35] the words they receive yeah right it
[1:44:39] reveals meaning the Bible has the
[1:44:42] answers with meaning for relationships
[1:44:44] amen amen the Bible is the greatest
[1:44:46] source of meaningful life young people I
[1:44:50] cannot tell you what a a great asset it
[1:44:54] is to know your scripture yes sir amen
[1:44:59] and we were we were fellowshipping this
[1:45:00] morning over breakfast about
[1:45:02] Ecclesiastes and and and the things that
[1:45:04] we're learning a simple thing like
[1:45:05] Solomon says don't be over Wicked and
[1:45:08] don't be over
[1:45:11] righteous that means it's like if you're
[1:45:13] going to be Wicked just a little
[1:45:16] bit don't be over Wicked then I got to
[1:45:19] understand that I thought you know what
[1:45:20] I really like coffee but I shouldn't
[1:45:22] indulge
[1:45:24] that's the wisdom in there it's wicked
[1:45:27] it's my pleasure but I shouldn't have
[1:45:29] too much cuz it's not healthy right and
[1:45:31] at the same time don't be over righteous
[1:45:33] he even says don't be over
[1:45:37] wise if you only know the value and the
[1:45:41] meaning that your scriptures have you'll
[1:45:43] hang on every
[1:45:45] word you got you got meaning for every
[1:45:48] aspect of your life in the scriptures
[1:45:50] and then to top that off we got a
[1:45:52] message on top of it
[1:45:54] glory to God and it didn't just leave us
[1:45:56] to then the very person of the written
[1:45:58] word comes down glory to God it gives us
[1:46:02] meaning for every part of our every day
[1:46:05] you could give your soul the answers it
[1:46:07] desires for every the Bible has the
[1:46:08] answers with meaning for relationships
[1:46:11] to governing the world from
[1:46:13] relationships to governing the world for
[1:46:15] handling of society in the best way for
[1:46:18] health that's right it reveals meaning
[1:46:21] for raising children
[1:46:24] so it feels like rejection of the word
[1:46:26] of God has brought about rejection of
[1:46:29] meaning in life so when you reject the
[1:46:32] word of God the revealed word today you
[1:46:34] are rejecting the meaning of life for
[1:46:36] today this is why you'll constantly have
[1:46:40] an unending thirst because there's no
[1:46:43] answer in your soul for the question for
[1:46:46] meaning so it feels like rejection of
[1:46:49] the word is just what's causing it today
[1:46:51] and yet you don't need to be a Christian
[1:46:52] to desire
[1:46:54] meaning do you know what a soul
[1:46:57] is soul is the question who is
[1:47:02] God the soul comes from God that's the
[1:47:05] answer every human soul wants who is God
[1:47:08] where do they chase they chase looking
[1:47:09] for God they don't know what they're
[1:47:10] asking they don't know what their soul
[1:47:12] is asking they think it's ambition they
[1:47:14] think it's entertainment but this all
[1:47:16] the soul wants to know is who is
[1:47:18] God that's it's one single question and
[1:47:21] just that question either can have faith
[1:47:23] in it or doubt in it amen this is why a
[1:47:26] person who filled his his soul with the
[1:47:28] desire for smoking when he got the qu
[1:47:31] the answer who is God the smoking was
[1:47:33] God Amen right
[1:47:37] y if you don't f it with meaning you
[1:47:39] have problems do you know that this is
[1:47:42] the reason people always seem to reach
[1:47:44] out to
[1:47:48] religion even if you're a person who
[1:47:50] doesn't believe in God atheism is your
[1:47:52] religion yeah it's true I once told an
[1:47:56] atheist dadd he got so upset with me I I
[1:47:59] said to him you have faith he said no
[1:48:02] faith is blind I said yeah you have
[1:48:04] faith he said what do you mean I said
[1:48:06] you have faith that atheism is right you
[1:48:09] believe it I said do you believe that
[1:48:11] there is no God he said yes I said well
[1:48:13] so long as you believe you have
[1:48:15] faith he lost his mind I said and you
[1:48:20] have a
[1:48:20] following of atheists and you have books
[1:48:24] written that there is no God so you just
[1:48:26] have a Bible too and then you all get
[1:48:28] together on social media and you
[1:48:30] communicate and have church
[1:48:33] yes right so there's no difference
[1:48:36] everything you're accusing me of you are
[1:48:38] yes man he lost his
[1:48:41] mind you can be from the australias from
[1:48:44] the Amazon you could be a Native
[1:48:46] American you and you search for meaning
[1:48:49] yeah right you you look to the Stars you
[1:48:52] gaze at the mountains you stare across
[1:48:54] the Horizon of the ocean you uh you
[1:48:57] stand there at the ocean when it's
[1:48:59] crashed the waves are crashing against
[1:49:00] the sand your brain ignites in different
[1:49:02] reasons if you had to put color to it
[1:49:04] it'll just it's flourishing with color
[1:49:07] you're standing there in front of the
[1:49:08] ocean and your eyes start misting up
[1:49:10] because you're taken by the beauty of
[1:49:12] something you can't help it your soul
[1:49:15] wants
[1:49:17] meaning and moments Flash before your
[1:49:20] eyes and simple things like a little
[1:49:22] song starts to bring memories from a
[1:49:24] time that you stored as a treasure in
[1:49:27] your
[1:49:28] soul you can't help it you're searching
[1:49:31] for
[1:49:32] meaning parts of your brain start to get
[1:49:34] excited that don't normally get excited
[1:49:36] when you're looking at a blank page or a
[1:49:38] computer screen right when you're
[1:49:40] standing out there alone with someone
[1:49:43] whom you love your eyes get Misty your
[1:49:45] skin has goosebumps your life seems to
[1:49:48] flash before you you recall memories
[1:49:50] that you made you establish meaning in
[1:49:52] your past in your present you're trying
[1:49:55] to make sure there's meaning in your
[1:49:56] future and unexplained emotions come
[1:49:59] over your wife or somebody ask you what
[1:50:01] what's the matter I don't know I just
[1:50:03] don't want to talk about it now I'm
[1:50:04] going through
[1:50:06] something and then the cell phone
[1:50:10] rings boom moment's gone so this is what
[1:50:13] I believe is happening today in the
[1:50:15] world saint as long as you have people
[1:50:17] constantly
[1:50:20] distracted you're going to stop having
[1:50:22] moments that require
[1:50:24] meaning that's what you got to face the
[1:50:27] fact that's what's happening today as
[1:50:30] long as you can be the enemy wants to
[1:50:32] keep you distracted you're going to not
[1:50:34] search for meaning how is it going to
[1:50:36] keep you from reading the word he's
[1:50:38] going to make sure you're under pressure
[1:50:40] at work he's going to make sure you're
[1:50:42] checking all those emails you're
[1:50:43] checking all all those those messages or
[1:50:45] checking up with someone you're going to
[1:50:47] have so many distractions and prioritize
[1:50:50] everything else and you don't realize
[1:50:52] it's that simple 10 years go by and
[1:50:54] suddenly your relationship with your
[1:50:56] wife has gone cold come on now because
[1:50:59] you were not chasing meaning you are
[1:51:01] being distracted from chasing meaning
[1:51:03] every
[1:51:04] day and then suddenly your child
[1:51:06] backslides and you thought what happened
[1:51:08] then you realized I was too busy with
[1:51:09] work to pay attention to them or
[1:51:12] something else happened and I didn't do
[1:51:13] enough to bring meaning to their life I
[1:51:15] should have been there uh every time
[1:51:17] they had something or I should have been
[1:51:19] there for them and then it's living with
[1:51:21] regret because during every of your life
[1:51:23] you're not following
[1:51:26] meaning so this is what I believe is
[1:51:29] happening today as long as you have
[1:51:31] people distracted moments of meaning are
[1:51:34] disappearing if the enemy keeps that
[1:51:36] going for 10 years of your life after 10
[1:51:38] years you suddenly have a moment and you
[1:51:40] realize the last 10 years of your life
[1:51:42] had had no meaning and suddenly you're
[1:51:45] filled with regret Believers carry
[1:51:48] meaning am amen this is why I believe
[1:51:51] believers who carry the word are so
[1:51:53] important to society we carry meaning
[1:51:56] for the soul the Christian Church put
[1:51:58] aside meaning 1,500 years ago when they
[1:52:01] chose to disregard the holy ghost in the
[1:52:03] church and they kicked it out then when
[1:52:06] the Renaissance period arrived you know
[1:52:08] the all the painting 16 Chapel
[1:52:11] industrialization great painters great
[1:52:13] musicians composers suddenly this what
[1:52:16] were they looking for trying to bring
[1:52:17] meaning into life more color into life
[1:52:20] right and they became a subject the
[1:52:22] educated called logic and
[1:52:26] reasoning they felt that if something
[1:52:28] was logical it would give meaning to the
[1:52:30] soul they decided that if something had
[1:52:32] good reason to do something had good
[1:52:35] reason then it carried meaning and would
[1:52:38] satisfy logic and reasoning is not bad
[1:52:41] because it provides meaning for things
[1:52:44] if you see things that occur around you
[1:52:45] but not for the question why did the
[1:52:48] universe come into being or why should I
[1:52:51] marry this girl and why do I feel like
[1:52:53] she will Satisfy My Soul and why do I
[1:52:56] feel committed to her when I barely know
[1:52:58] her and yet why do I feel like I cannot
[1:53:00] live without
[1:53:02] her constant question logic and what are
[1:53:06] you looking for logic and reasoning
[1:53:07] you're going to check with a friend
[1:53:09] check with Mom check with Dad check with
[1:53:10] this check with that why are you so
[1:53:13] unsure because you you've been
[1:53:15] programmed to use logic and reasoning to
[1:53:18] make
[1:53:20] decisions that started with the
[1:53:22] Renaissance period mathematics science
[1:53:24] all that and that's the reason when
[1:53:26] people don't find meaning soon enough
[1:53:28] they reach out for substances addicts
[1:53:30] they become dissatisfied with
[1:53:32] relationships with that girl they fell
[1:53:34] in love with after school they made
[1:53:36] promises to at the altar they had
[1:53:38] children they used to love one another
[1:53:40] they suddenly become dissatisfied with
[1:53:42] life in
[1:53:44] general because they let reasoning and
[1:53:46] logic getting
[1:53:48] away so meaning extends to revelation
[1:53:52] how does one know when you have meaning
[1:53:56] it's like when you have found what we
[1:53:57] call your soulmate this thing people
[1:53:59] have right soulmate what does that even
[1:54:02] mean what you have found is what you're
[1:54:04] saying is you found meaning in a
[1:54:06] relationship we got to break this down
[1:54:07] to find a detail it's not just a
[1:54:10] friendship you can use for a better life
[1:54:12] with someone oh I I I want to marry her
[1:54:15] cuz I need someone to wash my
[1:54:16] clothes or I need someone to cook my
[1:54:18] food or I need someone to talk to or I
[1:54:22] need to marry that person because she's
[1:54:24] very quiet she can listen to me
[1:54:28] talk right it's always selfish motives
[1:54:32] that you you do to satisfy yourself how
[1:54:34] somehow you know when you met your
[1:54:36] soulmate you found something
[1:54:40] more that you didn't even know you
[1:54:43] needed but something inside clicks
[1:54:46] there's a meaning that takes place
[1:54:48] beyond logic and reasoning you bring her
[1:54:51] home and your mom say says look what the
[1:54:53] Cat Dragged
[1:54:55] In hopefully Believers don't say that
[1:54:58] but there's going to be every single
[1:55:00] thing and it's going to be like what
[1:55:02] what are you even thinking do you know
[1:55:03] what family they come from you know
[1:55:05] amongst the Indians is are they even
[1:55:08] educated do they have a degree are they
[1:55:12] poor are you in your right mind because
[1:55:14] those things bring meaning in
[1:55:17] life right if you want to marry an
[1:55:19] Indian you've got to have a degree and
[1:55:21] you got to have money
[1:55:23] cuz that's meaning apparently so when
[1:55:26] you have found someone that you feel you
[1:55:29] love and you are promising to spend your
[1:55:31] life with them and when you make those
[1:55:32] vows at the altar you're giving over a
[1:55:35] part of your soul to them yes why must
[1:55:39] we speak vows and why are vows so
[1:55:42] important and why are they kept what
[1:55:43] happens when you speak a vow at the
[1:55:46] altar it's not just God listening to it
[1:55:49] and we must keep them because no you are
[1:55:51] inscribing something into the other
[1:55:53] one's
[1:55:55] Soul by your
[1:55:58] words you are giving over a part of your
[1:56:01] soul to them and what must have happened
[1:56:04] is that you have settled something
[1:56:05] inside you that believes that you found
[1:56:07] meaning in this person's life that's
[1:56:11] going to add meaning to your life amen
[1:56:14] you're excited to see the meaning you
[1:56:16] believe you are going to receive in the
[1:56:18] days after when you're living together
[1:56:20] people will doubt your choice in her and
[1:56:23] even question you but you seem so sure
[1:56:25] you've never been so sure of anything
[1:56:27] like this before what you have
[1:56:29] experienced is something powerful
[1:56:31] related to word and it's called
[1:56:36] Revelation that's why people will
[1:56:38] disagree with you because you have a
[1:56:40] revelation you have something inside
[1:56:42] that says this is the person there is
[1:56:45] nobody else people are going to ask you
[1:56:48] how do you know you're making a mistake
[1:56:51] shouldn't you be thinking again no youve
[1:56:53] have you have meaning inside and no no
[1:56:57] argument is going to remove
[1:57:00] that you have you know this is why when
[1:57:04] a hard time comes you'll stick together
[1:57:06] when the worst time be it death be it
[1:57:09] Peril be it Sword whatever it is you'll
[1:57:11] stick together because meaning is what's
[1:57:13] holding
[1:57:14] it amen you have a revelation that
[1:57:17] allowed you to see meaning some Beyond
[1:57:19] time and space that allowed you to make
[1:57:21] a decision that seems all wrong for
[1:57:24] every reason that others point out to
[1:57:26] you so let's break it down quickly
[1:57:28] before we move to the next
[1:57:29] step what you what are you actually
[1:57:32] saying when you love her when you say I
[1:57:36] love him what do you actually mean what
[1:57:40] is
[1:57:42] love what are you saying it's a word
[1:57:45] what is it caring is it an emotion is
[1:57:48] love mean at Valentine you must buy red
[1:57:50] hearts and teddy bears and chocolate
[1:57:53] what is it what do you mean by you love
[1:57:55] her what does it mean when you're in
[1:57:58] love with
[1:58:00] someone it's a lot less romantic when
[1:58:02] you know what it actually
[1:58:04] means it means you believe in
[1:58:08] them amen yes if you love your wife you
[1:58:12] believe in her and she believes in you
[1:58:16] that's what love is can you live you can
[1:58:19] only live with someone who you believe
[1:58:22] believe in because if you believe in
[1:58:24] them there is trust there is no jealousy
[1:58:28] there is no enmity there's you believe
[1:58:32] in them that's what it actually is amen
[1:58:38] belief what do you believe about them
[1:58:40] you believe in their way of life you
[1:58:43] believe in their emotions you you
[1:58:45] believe in their thinking you believe in
[1:58:47] their speech you believe in their
[1:58:48] essence you believe in their personality
[1:58:51] you actually believe they'll make you a
[1:58:53] better
[1:58:54] person it that's what love actually is
[1:58:57] love that word that full letter word
[1:58:59] nobody seems to know what it
[1:59:01] is it means believing in
[1:59:04] someone I love you brother I believe in
[1:59:07] you I love you sister I Believe In You
[1:59:09] am
[1:59:11] amen there
[1:59:13] are
[1:59:17] um here we go pergan Church AG now we
[1:59:20] can see this association with the word
[1:59:22] he is the word that is who he is the
[1:59:25] word in his name am I at the right place
[1:59:29] it doesn't look like I'm at the right
[1:59:34] place um I'm looking for my pergan
[1:59:37] church age 162 yeah this is it uh now we
[1:59:41] can see his association with the word he
[1:59:43] is the word that is who he is the word
[1:59:45] in his name in John 1:1 where it says in
[1:59:48] the beginning was the word the root from
[1:59:50] which we get our translation for word is
[1:59:52] logos now watch which means the thought
[1:59:56] or
[1:59:58] concept the concept of
[2:00:01] God huh double meaning of thought and
[2:00:04] speech now a thought expressed is a word
[2:00:07] or words isn't that wonderful and
[2:00:10] beautiful John says the concept of God
[2:00:13] was expressed in
[2:00:15] Jesus
[2:00:17] beautiful so when I believe the word
[2:00:20] when I love him amen I believe in him
[2:00:25] that's not just saying I agree with his
[2:00:28] concept no I believe in his concept
[2:00:31] means my soul is attached to his concept
[2:00:34] my soul is so attached it's like linked
[2:00:36] it's like Stitch together that's what it
[2:00:39] means when I believe the
[2:00:41] [Music]
[2:00:43] word the word comes in four forms
[2:00:47] thought spoken word written word
[2:00:49] manifested word amen so once it's
[2:00:52] thought it's spoken and this is the
[2:00:54] magic of it right when it's spoken it
[2:00:58] cannot return void and this is the
[2:01:00] problem when you lie it's going to
[2:01:04] produce something yeah right right it's
[2:01:07] not ever going to do nothing yeah if you
[2:01:10] say anything deceptive it's going to
[2:01:13] produce something if you say something
[2:01:15] positive it's going to produce something
[2:01:17] because that's the sequence thought
[2:01:19] speech or if it's written mean it's
[2:01:22] recorded and then it's
[2:01:24] manifested right the logos of God became
[2:01:27] the spoken word then became the written
[2:01:29] word in the Bible and then the
[2:01:31] manifested word in his people the word
[2:01:33] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he the
[2:01:36] very Concept in the thought of God's
[2:01:39] mind whatever that is manifested spoken
[2:01:44] you know this this's one place brother R
[2:01:46] said he speaking about Genesis 1 God
[2:01:48] spoke the word spoke the word Genesis 1
[2:01:51] and then he for form Med everything am
[2:01:54] before anything was formed he made man
[2:01:56] and man wasn't even formed then he
[2:01:58] formed him out of the Dust of the ground
[2:02:00] he's so it becomes spoken word and then
[2:02:02] it becomes manifested word that's right
[2:02:05] glory to God so within time written word
[2:02:08] and spoken word are supposed to transfer
[2:02:11] the original concept right right right
[2:02:15] the original thought the thoughts of the
[2:02:17] hearers of the word so the final
[2:02:19] manifestation would be exactly according
[2:02:22] to the original thought that's what we
[2:02:24] need amen so if you're sitting and
[2:02:27] listening to the message and the message
[2:02:29] is not bringing the life of the original
[2:02:32] thought right there's something wrong
[2:02:34] with the word you're receiving and
[2:02:36] that's why it's going to produce a
[2:02:37] character upon the church that shouldn't
[2:02:39] [Music]
[2:02:40] be that's how it works this is why we
[2:02:44] needed the original word to return in
[2:02:46] the end time glory to God the meaning of
[2:02:50] life that it brings is
[2:02:53] unparalleled amen problem lies in
[2:02:56] between spoken word and manifested word
[2:02:59] there's this terrible thing written word
[2:03:02] which everybody
[2:03:05] misinterprets that's the problem right
[2:03:08] unbelief was encouraged by the written
[2:03:11] word being misinterpreted so that every
[2:03:13] time spoken word is given logic and
[2:03:16] reason tells you to compare it to the
[2:03:18] written
[2:03:19] word what does it mean by check it up
[2:03:21] with the word how do you interpret that
[2:03:25] yeah when you when you hear your pastor
[2:03:27] preach do you check it up with the
[2:03:29] revealed word or the written
[2:03:32] word when check it up with the word when
[2:03:35] your pastor preaches do you check it up
[2:03:37] with the logos himself or the written
[2:03:39] word amen because if you are triggered
[2:03:42] by reasoning first you will go straight
[2:03:43] to the written word to try and disprove
[2:03:45] it the the question you need to ask
[2:03:47] yourself is why are you doing that yeah
[2:03:50] are you searching for meaning or to
[2:03:52] correct
[2:03:54] something always check the motive
[2:03:57] because if you really want to know the
[2:03:58] meaning check with the logos himself
[2:04:01] amen praise be to God unbelief was
[2:04:04] encouraged by the written word I'm not
[2:04:06] saying listen I'm one of those people
[2:04:08] who loves the written word I'm going to
[2:04:11] check it every single day if I have to
[2:04:13] right but my motive is to love him more
[2:04:17] my motive is to believe more Not To
[2:04:19] Doubt more that's right amen amen
[2:04:22] because I love him and I know love means
[2:04:24] to believe him I want to read what I
[2:04:26] want to believe and now if I'm going to
[2:04:29] check something which I didn't
[2:04:30] understand I want to check it with the
[2:04:31] motive of believing
[2:04:34] am because I love him so then spoken
[2:04:37] word which is the original see it takes
[2:04:39] its place in the mind as perceived word
[2:04:41] brother said the word the mind is the
[2:04:43] womb of the soul the spoken word comes
[2:04:45] to you it germinates it drops into it's
[2:04:49] the womb of the Soul it germinates and
[2:04:51] drops into the soul and then you believe
[2:04:53] it amen right that's the reason
[2:04:56] Revelation or of the or the revealed
[2:04:59] word is
[2:05:00] crucial if you don't have the correct
[2:05:03] revelation of the spoken word you will
[2:05:06] manifest Christianity according to man's
[2:05:09] idea sec in Corinthians Paul says it's
[2:05:12] impossible for a man to understand the
[2:05:14] things of God if he has the spirit of
[2:05:17] man you cannot understand the things of
[2:05:20] God unless you have the spirit of God
[2:05:22] is that right that's where the Holy
[2:05:24] Ghost comes in I always use this uh this
[2:05:26] analogy I'm not sure if I mention it
[2:05:28] here but it's like it's like this you
[2:05:31] have man and you have a
[2:05:33] chimpanzee and they both look alike
[2:05:35] right somewhat a little bit more ha and
[2:05:38] he's not wearing clothes right but he
[2:05:40] has he can walk around he's got five
[2:05:42] fingers he's got five toes he's got a
[2:05:44] head he's got eyes facing forward his
[2:05:45] nose like ours his ears and you can put
[2:05:48] a suit on him you can put a tie on him
[2:05:52] you can teach him how to drink from a
[2:05:54] cup you can give as long as you keep
[2:05:57] giving him peanuts he'll do exactly what
[2:05:59] you what you want him to do you just
[2:06:02] keep giving him snacks and he's going to
[2:06:03] keep he will wear the suit for more
[2:06:06] peanuts yeah right right right yeah but
[2:06:09] does he know why he's wearing a
[2:06:11] suit the suit has no meaning to him yeah
[2:06:14] he actually hates it he doesn't know how
[2:06:17] why should he can you imagine a
[2:06:19] chimpanzee lip on a cup
[2:06:22] how difficult that must be and and
[2:06:24] what's he going to do with the tie it's
[2:06:26] choking
[2:06:27] him to put his feet in a shoe he's not
[2:06:30] going to climb a tree yeah you're
[2:06:32] removing the meaning from him by trying
[2:06:35] to put human things on him right there's
[2:06:39] only one way you can get this chimpanzee
[2:06:42] to think like a human yes sir you have
[2:06:45] to become a
[2:06:50] chimpanzee you have to go down to his
[2:06:52] level you have to explain so what what
[2:06:55] happens if you become a chimpanzee and
[2:06:57] you walk in the tribe and say we need to
[2:07:00] build a house we can be better let's
[2:07:02] become civilized let's stop biting each
[2:07:04] other's faces off you know let's share
[2:07:07] the
[2:07:09] berries this is we can become better
[2:07:11] people we can become you have to become
[2:07:13] a chimpanzee it's funny but this is what
[2:07:16] God did for us that's right but the
[2:07:20] church wants peanut
[2:07:22] nuts blessings I'll be a Christian as
[2:07:25] long as he heals
[2:07:26] me I'll be this as long as he blesses me
[2:07:30] but are you finding meaning or you just
[2:07:32] want
[2:07:33] peanuts but he became
[2:07:36] man he showed us how to be better he
[2:07:39] brought his the concept of God into
[2:07:41] flesh the word was made flesh for you
[2:07:44] and I he died for you and I and he could
[2:07:47] show us that we don't have to be this
[2:07:49] immoral human race we can and be
[2:07:52] Godlike he brought that down to us I
[2:07:55] don't want
[2:07:56] peanuts I want his word I want the
[2:07:59] meaning praise be to God the Holy Ghost
[2:08:02] was not sent to give you power of
[2:08:04] Miracles and speaking in tongues and
[2:08:05] prophecies so we could boast in
[2:08:07] spiritual power it is the nature of God
[2:08:10] only given as a gift to eventually lead
[2:08:12] you to meaning that's that is to believe
[2:08:15] the word Saints there is a famine of
[2:08:17] revealed word today do you see why
[2:08:20] people play so much value in what you
[2:08:22] say and that they that you can accept or
[2:08:25] you can condemn with your words take a
[2:08:27] few lessons from the scripture what did
[2:08:29] they say to Jesus Christ not for the
[2:08:32] Miracles and works but because you say
[2:08:35] that's right amen his words yeah right
[2:08:39] when he said who do men say that I
[2:08:43] am now he's challenging their word yeah
[2:08:46] what meaning do you have oh some say
[2:08:48] this some say that what do you say he
[2:08:51] amen and when it was said that was the
[2:08:53] Christ the son of the Living God Flesh
[2:08:55] and Blood had not revealed this to you
[2:08:57] they got meaning which was not revealed
[2:08:59] by Flesh and
[2:09:01] Blood why was it so important at
[2:09:03] Revelation when Jesus third pool
[2:09:05] Ministry came in when everyone left
[2:09:07] Jesus the 70 turned away he turns to the
[2:09:09] disciple and says will you leave me too
[2:09:11] what did they say whom can we turn to
[2:09:14] for you have the Miracles of eternal
[2:09:15] life that's right you have the signs of
[2:09:17] eternal life you have the word you have
[2:09:20] the meaning
[2:09:21] you have the answer for my
[2:09:23] soul
[2:09:25] amen who can we turn to all of the
[2:09:28] reasons to give why that be why so
[2:09:31] concerned with words they didn't say
[2:09:33] because you do great Miracles the the
[2:09:36] the 70 were going out and doing the
[2:09:39] Miracles and turned
[2:09:42] away right and when they heard the word
[2:09:45] they stumbled at it because it wasn't
[2:09:47] the meaning they were looking
[2:09:49] for where they secretly studying the
[2:09:52] philosophers to be to be philosophers
[2:09:55] why did the group of 11 unimportant
[2:09:58] uneducated men of all different stations
[2:10:00] of life care about
[2:10:03] words because they heard him speak and
[2:10:06] his words brought meaning to their soul
[2:10:09] amen his name is called the word of
[2:10:14] God when Jesus said my words that I
[2:10:16] speak unto you are spirit and life this
[2:10:18] meant that the word of God is like a
[2:10:20] seed that carries power to germinate a
[2:10:22] character amen that gives you a path of
[2:10:25] life amen that means he was saying that
[2:10:27] words carried in power to them to
[2:10:28] transform Souls by changing their
[2:10:31] Natures to deny previous desires and
[2:10:33] lusts and to give them new desires amen
[2:10:36] so the more word you believe the more
[2:10:38] character you receive the more character
[2:10:40] you receive the more word you believe
[2:10:43] until you can believe in
[2:10:45] fullness and if you believe in fullness
[2:10:48] you receive the full
[2:10:49] character thank you so here's why this
[2:10:52] is crucial to us because belief is
[2:10:54] attached to words it's so hard to
[2:10:56] comprehend and admit that our belief is
[2:10:58] based on
[2:11:00] Words Right the foolishness of preaching
[2:11:03] yeah our belief is based on Words you
[2:11:05] know someone can love you with the
[2:11:08] actions where they can cook for you
[2:11:10] every day they can wash your clothes
[2:11:12] clean your clothes clean your house they
[2:11:14] can uh play good music in your home they
[2:11:17] can make a nice atmosphere and all of
[2:11:20] those things they can do everything for
[2:11:22] you but their words to you can Crush
[2:11:27] you belief is attached to words belief
[2:11:31] affects the soul and changes the nature
[2:11:33] then when you truly believe something
[2:11:35] you cannot help acting on it because
[2:11:37] believing in something gives you Faith
[2:11:39] to act why is the word so important to
[2:11:42] true believers they know the
[2:11:44] transforming power of the word they know
[2:11:47] the danger of false word amen they know
[2:11:50] that word without that Revelation is
[2:11:52] immediately misinterpreted into
[2:11:54] perceptions that alters the nature of
[2:11:56] people to create Strange Behaviors am
[2:11:59] that is not in accordance with the
[2:12:00] nature of the Holy Spirit that's why
[2:12:03] Believers know and distrust false
[2:12:08] word they know the word without
[2:12:10] Revelation is immediately misinterpreted
[2:12:13] a True Believer knows the warning that
[2:12:15] in the last days people will not be able
[2:12:17] to endure sound
[2:12:19] doctrine that they will accept wed down
[2:12:23] weak words to suit their lives of
[2:12:25] pleasure I had a wonderful Minister
[2:12:28] friend who said to me he said
[2:12:30] brother I think people today are looking
[2:12:33] for a convenient
[2:12:36] God and I thought wow that's
[2:12:39] it they want a convenient God they and
[2:12:42] he said this they want a God to agree
[2:12:45] with
[2:12:48] them A True Believer knows that warning
[2:12:51] amen a Believer knows his responsibility
[2:12:54] to share the true word that will change
[2:12:56] people's lives for the better we're
[2:12:57] almost closing a True Believer knows he
[2:13:00] cannot force a person to believe but he
[2:13:02] can adjust himself so that people see
[2:13:04] his life and might believe you know as
[2:13:07] preachers we can use our Charisma to
[2:13:10] convince you but if we are trying if we
[2:13:13] convince you someone can convince you
[2:13:15] better we have the responsibility to
[2:13:18] know when we deliver the word it must be
[2:13:20] pure
[2:13:21] not with my character behind it not with
[2:13:24] Charisma behind it not with anything
[2:13:27] else that's wooing a person it must be
[2:13:30] purely delivered from God himself if
[2:13:33] it's any other way they're going to be
[2:13:34] convinced out of it by someone with a
[2:13:36] more convincing
[2:13:37] argument because naturally you are
[2:13:40] logical
[2:13:41] reasoners and the enemy knows that right
[2:13:45] A True Believer knows the important of
[2:13:47] feed importance of feeding his soul on
[2:13:49] incorruptible word from the pulpit a
[2:13:52] True Believer knows that his soul cannot
[2:13:54] be satisfied with half truths or tainted
[2:13:57] doctrines of man the word as we call it
[2:14:00] the open book meaning the thoughts of
[2:14:03] God in the form of the revealed word
[2:14:05] sent to bring us in the last days unto
[2:14:07] Mount Zion the spirits of just men made
[2:14:13] perfect that's what the word does Amen
[2:14:16] let's close this
[2:14:17] down I've got one last thing to talk to
[2:14:20] you about the end which shouldn't take
[2:14:22] long but just look at this the Thy word
[2:14:25] have I hid in my heart that I might not
[2:14:26] sin against thee if you want to know the
[2:14:29] Bible is telling you why the word has to
[2:14:31] come into the heart the word protects me
[2:14:33] from sin Psalm 119 105 Thy word is a
[2:14:37] lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[2:14:39] path what does that mean it gives me
[2:14:41] direction for
[2:14:42] Life John 17:17 sanctify them through
[2:14:47] thy truth Thy word is truth sanctify
[2:14:50] them means separate them consecrate them
[2:14:53] give them purpose through Thy word
[2:14:56] because it's truth these are just three
[2:14:59] of hundreds that's right of scriptures
[2:15:03] this is the prayer of Jesus in in
[2:15:06] Gethsemane sanctify them through thy
[2:15:08] truth Thy word is truth amen sanctify
[2:15:12] make holy the truth shall set you free
[2:15:14] Saints Traditions are formed from the
[2:15:17] anxiety of logic and reasoning yes right
[2:15:20] do you know that yeah because leaders in
[2:15:23] the message leaders in the gospel
[2:15:25] leaders in the past they formed
[2:15:27] Traditions to control the church to to
[2:15:30] keep a religion because they were
[2:15:32] anxious that they were going to lose
[2:15:33] people or that they thought even if they
[2:15:36] were thinking good they were thinking
[2:15:38] that that we don't want the faith to die
[2:15:40] we need to be strong on these traditions
[2:15:42] we need to keep this we need to police
[2:15:45] this and you failed because the moment
[2:15:47] you start doing that you're not allowing
[2:15:49] a person to find real meaning
[2:15:51] [Music]
[2:15:52] amen so a real five-fold ministry will
[2:15:56] not be doing that to people be
[2:15:58] delivering the truth with absolute
[2:16:00] Revelation amen Proverbs 13:13 says who
[2:16:04] despiseth the word shall be
[2:16:08] destroyed thus sayeth the Lord shall be
[2:16:13] destroyed this is not a commandment this
[2:16:16] is not a suggestion this is not advice
[2:16:18] this is a statement if you despise the
[2:16:21] word sent for your day you shall be
[2:16:24] destroyed you might as well have not
[2:16:26] heard it than to have heard it and
[2:16:28] despised
[2:16:30] it but he that fearth the Commandment
[2:16:32] shall be rewarded you'll find meaning
[2:16:36] glory to God rejecting the word is you
[2:16:39] destroying your own life amen you you
[2:16:43] remember your soul is longing for
[2:16:44] meaning as a Believer as a bride of
[2:16:46] Christ you're only going to find
[2:16:48] happiness and to be complete if you
[2:16:51] meaning for your day and it lies in the
[2:16:53] open book amen now taking all that we
[2:16:57] have said this morning Saints well it's
[2:16:59] now
[2:17:00] afternoon ask yourself what a serious
[2:17:03] lack of word in a believer's life causes
[2:17:06] for him or
[2:17:10] her ask yourself what consequences are
[2:17:13] about to come upon this world that is
[2:17:15] living without meaning Can you feel it
[2:17:18] happening they're losing their mind
[2:17:20] they're heading for
[2:17:22] war it's like they're not even
[2:17:25] rational it's even logic and reasoning
[2:17:28] is failing them that's what I
[2:17:31] mean the the the whole aspect of meaning
[2:17:34] is gone they don't even know what life
[2:17:35] is they don't even know what marriage is
[2:17:37] they don't even know what bringing up
[2:17:39] they're advising young women not to have
[2:17:42] children which species does
[2:17:47] that this is the worst state of man
[2:17:49] we've ever seen this is why a Son of God
[2:17:52] is satisfied with the word this is why
[2:17:54] saints Saints of God die with peace and
[2:17:57] no regrets amen this is why those who
[2:17:59] get the word sleep easier are happier
[2:18:03] handle stress better they are not
[2:18:05] struggling to find meaning meaning is
[2:18:07] all around us and they bring meaning to
[2:18:10] everyone else they
[2:18:13] meet what can a worldly what meaning can
[2:18:16] a worldly neighbor bring to
[2:18:19] you but us them what you mean to
[2:18:22] them you know it right kinsman redeemer
[2:18:27] and this story was written in all the
[2:18:29] old manuscripts when they were
[2:18:30] segregating the Bible the holy men when
[2:18:32] they were trying to put it together in
[2:18:33] the Old Testament This Book of Ruth was
[2:18:35] one of the outstanding books that they
[2:18:37] accepted why if it's just a love story
[2:18:39] why would the writers and ancient sages
[2:18:41] accept this book as inspired because
[2:18:43] there's a hidden revelation in it and in
[2:18:46] this hidden revelation you catch the
[2:18:48] real meaning and it'll bring you close
[2:18:52] to
[2:18:53] God glory to God you cast the real
[2:18:56] meaning it brings you close to God if
[2:18:59] there is lack of the word there is lack
[2:19:00] of meaning if there is lack of meaning
[2:19:02] the soul of man is no contentment the
[2:19:05] worst thing is to see a human living
[2:19:07] with no contentment if there's no
[2:19:09] contentment a man's Soul dies a really
[2:19:12] slow painful death eating away at his
[2:19:15] Spirit his mind becomes diseased his
[2:19:17] mind one not one spiritual fiber at a
[2:19:20] time until there's nothing left to save
[2:19:22] and the man who was once is
[2:19:27] unrecognizable right what he was once
[2:19:30] he's now
[2:19:32] unrecognizable yeah so in closing I want
[2:19:36] to just leave you with this thought
[2:19:38] simple
[2:19:39] thought your
[2:19:41] logos is your God Amen your logos your
[2:19:47] logos is the god of your being it's what
[2:19:51] your temple
[2:19:53] worships in reality I'll ask you the
[2:19:56] question who is your god who is God to
[2:19:59] you you can't you can't imagine the
[2:20:03] father you you can't imagine the spirit
[2:20:06] of God you can't see the Holy Spirit you
[2:20:10] don't know Jesus Christ from 2,000 years
[2:20:13] ago you have nothing tangible to attach
[2:20:18] belief to
[2:20:21] the only thing you have is your
[2:20:24] logos the word of your being that is who
[2:20:28] you pray to that is who you worship that
[2:20:31] is who you submit to your logos is your
[2:20:35] god that's how a human was made if
[2:20:38] everything we spoke to you about that
[2:20:39] you know now that words have meaning
[2:20:43] people only bow down to meaning people
[2:20:45] only submit to meaning who God is to you
[2:20:49] is your logos amen this is why it has to
[2:20:53] be the word yeah amen the logos of your
[2:20:56] being is the reality of God to you
[2:21:00] because it rules your being that's why
[2:21:03] it had to be the word and the word only
[2:21:04] could bring let's read John 1 1 to 3 or
[2:21:07] 1: 4 in the beginning was the word the
[2:21:10] word was with God and the Word was God
[2:21:12] the same was in the beginning with god
[2:21:14] listen to this and I want to prove this
[2:21:16] to you all things were made by him and
[2:21:19] without him was not anything made that
[2:21:21] was made what is it saying to us the
[2:21:24] logos is your god whatever you hold in
[2:21:27] your heart in your mind your logos your
[2:21:31] word is going to create everything in
[2:21:34] your life everything you put in your
[2:21:36] life is caused by you your logos your
[2:21:40] reaction your words your feelings your
[2:21:43] emotions it rules
[2:21:46] you and you once lived with a corrupted
[2:21:49] logos yeah
[2:21:53] in him was life and the life was the
[2:21:56] light of man applyed to yourself
[2:21:59] personally and you'll see why people
[2:22:01] live in
[2:22:03] darkness because their logos is
[2:22:06] Darkness
[2:22:08] amen have you noticed and this is this
[2:22:11] is where we're closing have you noticed
[2:22:13] how the L do you do you are you even
[2:22:17] awake
[2:22:19] spiritually do you know know what
[2:22:21] information overload
[2:22:23] is do you know what's happening on the
[2:22:26] Internet it's for the first time humans
[2:22:30] are having an information
[2:22:33] overload their minds are filling with
[2:22:35] the logos that is not the word of
[2:22:38] God who are they listening to their
[2:22:41] souls are searching for meaning they're
[2:22:43] listening to Dr Jordan Peterson they're
[2:22:45] listening to all the philosophers on
[2:22:47] YouTube they listen imagine the these
[2:22:50] desperate souls are searching and
[2:22:52] there's nothing Mr Dr Jordan Peterson is
[2:22:54] probably a good speaker a good
[2:22:56] philosopher trying to understand the
[2:22:57] very mysteries of Life he's probably
[2:23:00] more well balanced than all our
[2:23:01] politicians he's probably more well
[2:23:03] balanced than other philosophers that we
[2:23:06] had in the past Socrates and arist I
[2:23:08] don't know then there's other people but
[2:23:10] young people are flocking to these men
[2:23:13] who are speaking word and they're
[2:23:15] getting meaning of life from them
[2:23:17] they're reading their books they're
[2:23:19] watching their videos on YouTube they're
[2:23:21] listening to their podcast why are
[2:23:23] people so
[2:23:26] desperate this is happening all around
[2:23:28] you at a time where the logos himself
[2:23:31] has
[2:23:32] descended with an open book and there
[2:23:35] are people around you desperate people
[2:23:37] searching for a logos to give their life
[2:23:40] a good path good meaning good marriages
[2:23:44] they're looking for Logos to recode what
[2:23:46] a man
[2:23:48] is because they've been hammered with
[2:23:51] toxic masculinity feminism man must wear
[2:23:54] pink shirts and man must dress more
[2:23:56] feminized man must do this man must do
[2:23:58] this and now those men are rushing to
[2:24:00] this philosopher on the on YouTube to
[2:24:02] find out what can I be to change what
[2:24:05] they're telling
[2:24:08] me millions of people are taking their
[2:24:11] those men's word as logos I can't tell
[2:24:14] you how tragic that is when I watch this
[2:24:16] and what we
[2:24:18] have it makes me want to go go out and
[2:24:20] tell them I have something for
[2:24:24] you people of the world are make now for
[2:24:28] your family if you're young people if
[2:24:31] you're
[2:24:32] spending if you're imagine a scale if
[2:24:35] you're spending this much time on the
[2:24:37] internet and this much time on the word
[2:24:40] of God and you're just depending on
[2:24:42] Sunday morning service this is your
[2:24:45] logos right amen because this is where
[2:24:49] you are taking me meaning of life
[2:24:52] from and now check what happens with
[2:24:54] every family if your logos is built on
[2:24:57] education television music podcast
[2:25:01] news I I mean just look at your country
[2:25:05] America they designed it to control you
[2:25:08] you have presidential elections every
[2:25:10] four years midterm elections every four
[2:25:12] years do the people ever get a
[2:25:15] break they got you in a constant cycle
[2:25:18] of division and hate yeah yes what do
[2:25:21] you think the logos of your country
[2:25:23] is what do you think the mindset of your
[2:25:26] people are are they stable do you ever
[2:25:29] think they'll be stable if they're
[2:25:31] constantly pitted against each other one
[2:25:33] party against another party they wanted
[2:25:36] that way because they're getting rich by
[2:25:38] it how can you have people voting every
[2:25:42] four years and in between that every two
[2:25:44] years yeah midterm elections Senate
[2:25:47] votes house votes Congress presidential
[2:25:51] the people don't get a break you can
[2:25:53] barely get used to one president and
[2:25:55] there's another
[2:25:56] one and each one comes with another
[2:25:59] logos and then they legislate that logos
[2:26:02] and then they must police that logos
[2:26:04] yeah right what's happening to society
[2:26:06] is breaking your education system down
[2:26:08] you don't trust schools anymore and the
[2:26:11] last time I came here one brother tells
[2:26:12] me it's so difficult to be a teacher in
[2:26:15] America because they're forcing you to
[2:26:17] teach certain things to the children
[2:26:21] how does that form a society it's so
[2:26:24] politically divided I don't even want to
[2:26:26] tell you about our
[2:26:28] country I mean but but America was
[2:26:31] supposed to be the Bastion of democracy
[2:26:33] the example to the world the Improvement
[2:26:36] of the of the Roman system instead now
[2:26:39] it's a laughing
[2:26:40] stock they don't even know where they
[2:26:42] stand with
[2:26:45] Israel men should not have their logos
[2:26:48] being given by other men whether it's Dr
[2:26:51] Jordan Peterson whoever is on on on the
[2:26:54] on the on YouTube man should not be
[2:26:56] giving logos to other men it has to be
[2:27:00] God himself because true meaning only
[2:27:02] comes from him the god of your being is
[2:27:05] your logos what is your logos that
[2:27:09] controls you what is it that your spirit
[2:27:11] bows down to what is the only thing that
[2:27:14] tells you when someone is telling you
[2:27:15] the truth how do you ever how are you
[2:27:18] ever going to navigate what your wife is
[2:27:20] telling you if you're falling in love
[2:27:22] with someone how are you ever going to
[2:27:23] know that you're doing the right thing
[2:27:25] if you're operating by man's logos
[2:27:27] you're lost you're heading for
[2:27:30] disaster the god of your being is your
[2:27:33] logos what is your logos that controls
[2:27:36] you what are you without the
[2:27:40] word whatever your logos is you draw
[2:27:43] from it when you speak it manifests in
[2:27:46] you and cements it into your substance
[2:27:50] and you become what you
[2:27:54] speak that is how word Works logos
[2:27:58] spoken word manifested word you know
[2:28:01] this very well a good man out of the
[2:28:03] good Treasure of his heart bringeth
[2:28:05] forth good things an evil man out of the
[2:28:08] evil treasure bringeth forth evil things
[2:28:10] Matthew 12:36 but I say unto you that
[2:28:13] Every Idle word that men shall speak
[2:28:17] they shall give account thereof in the
[2:28:19] day of judgment Matthew 12:37 by thy
[2:28:22] words Thou shalt be justified and by thy
[2:28:26] words Thou shalt be
[2:28:28] condemned where are you bringing words
[2:28:31] from your
[2:28:32] logos and the word a man is not
[2:28:35] corrupted by what he takes in butes out
[2:28:38] what comes out because when you speak it
[2:28:41] you know what when you when you have a
[2:28:42] thought and he working it over you're
[2:28:44] reasoning it out you're not going to act
[2:28:46] on it until you speak it that's right
[2:28:49] because once you speak it it becomes
[2:28:50] manifested it's ingrained in your
[2:28:52] substance it becomes who you are people
[2:28:55] are going to hold you try that but you
[2:28:58] said 10 years
[2:29:00] ago I remember you said that don't deny
[2:29:03] it if you denyed you're lying then you
[2:29:04] forced to say oh but I said this because
[2:29:06] that you must understand the conditions
[2:29:08] under which I said that no no you said
[2:29:10] it it became your substance you believed
[2:29:13] it you acted upon it you treated me this
[2:29:16] way because of what you said you can say
[2:29:18] sorry if you want to but 10 years when
[2:29:20] why and you believed it and you acted on
[2:29:22] it and you treated me that way because
[2:29:24] people are not going to forget what you
[2:29:25] say
[2:29:28] Amen by the words that you speak you
[2:29:30] shall be justified and the words you
[2:29:32] speak you shall be condemned because
[2:29:34] whatever you speak becomes
[2:29:37] you that's why I need the word today
[2:29:40] amen that's why it takes the word I'm
[2:29:44] not looking for signs and wonders I'm
[2:29:46] not looking for experiences I'm not
[2:29:48] looking for anything else I I believe in
[2:29:50] him I love him I believe he came down
[2:29:54] for that very reason to bring meaning to
[2:29:56] my life I believe he can make my
[2:29:59] marriage better I believe he can make me
[2:30:01] a better person I believe if I keep his
[2:30:04] logos in my home my children my wife
[2:30:07] will all have a better uh understanding
[2:30:09] of Life we'll all share the same thing
[2:30:12] you know it's so simple you can see a a
[2:30:15] household where there's just the the
[2:30:18] father of the house is just a joker
[2:30:20] practical joke what do you think the
[2:30:21] kids are going to be like because that's
[2:30:23] he's made that the logos of his house if
[2:30:25] he's an authoritarian he he runs his
[2:30:28] house by rules well what do you think
[2:30:29] the kids are going to be
[2:30:31] like whatever your logos is is what you
[2:30:35] become this is why you need the word
[2:30:38] only church if the word cannot change
[2:30:41] you nothing
[2:30:43] can only the word can give true meaning
[2:30:46] to life make the open book open book The
[2:30:50] go of your being and watch the change of
[2:30:52] your character take place amen he will

[2:31:10] share this with you it's something that
[2:31:12] I hold very very close to me I want to
[2:31:15] know this is the reason why I want to
[2:31:17] speak right I want to I want want to
[2:31:20] speak well I want to say the right thing
[2:31:23] I want to say it with the right
[2:31:24] inflection I want to say it with the
[2:31:26] right motive I want to speak it with
[2:31:28] truth because I know whatever I speak
[2:31:31] becomes me and I want what I speak to be
[2:31:34] influenced by the revelation of God for
[2:31:37] this day that's why it's got to be the
[2:31:39] word amen the Lord bless you let's bow

[2:31:54] you have brought true meaning to our
[2:31:56] lives Lord maybe we have we have not
[2:32:00] realized the value of the word the value
[2:32:02] of the revelation of your word maybe we
[2:32:05] have not uh understood what what value
[2:32:08] there is maybe we we needed to
[2:32:10] understand by the behaviors that the
[2:32:12] prophet speaks about throughout the
[2:32:13] message maybe we needed to to see these
[2:32:16] things Lord because we we come to church
[2:32:19] sometimes we think it's just a tradition
[2:32:22] sometimes we think we're just come
[2:32:23] because we have to because we're message
[2:32:25] Believers because we're Christian but
[2:32:28] Lord I pray that you would make it a
[2:32:30] real understanding in the heart of every
[2:32:32] person that when they come they prepare
[2:32:35] to receive the logos of God the concept
[2:32:39] of God because we believe that in our
[2:32:42] soul nothing else is more important to
[2:32:45] us father we believe in your way of life
[2:32:48] we believe in your your thoughts being
[2:32:50] our thoughts we believe in our words

[2:33:30] become a reality to every person every
[2:33:34] young person not just some fictional or
[2:33:37] fantasy religious idea but an actual
[2:33:41] reality because words affect us I pray
[2:33:45] that it may be indelible in the hearts
[2:33:48] of your children printed Lord that they
[2:33:51] may know and realize every moment every
[2:33:53] time we read a devotion every time we
[2:33:55] read a scripture every time we read a
[2:33:57] message every time we listen to a a
[2:33:59] recording or a message of the Prophet it
[2:34:02] is

[2:34:23] word may we be be may we find Focus may
[2:34:28] we come back we don't want to live lives
[2:34:30] of regret Lord at the same time if we
[2:34:34] have wasted our life it isn't too late
[2:34:36] Lord we know we are willing to change

[2:36:08] hallelujah men shall not live by bread
[2:36:16] alone but by

[2:37:11] amen we we knew the value of the word
[2:37:15] but now I think we're learning more and
[2:37:17] more the value of what God has given us
[2:37:20] I wrote down one line here at the end
[2:37:22] something brother Benham said said are
[2:37:25] we sufficiently impressed with the word
[2:37:27] that is in our
[2:37:28] midst I think that's our goal is to be
[2:37:32] sufficiently impressed with what God has
[2:37:35] given us what God has given us is
[2:37:37] changing us what God has given us was
[2:37:39] sent to bring us into his very image so
[2:37:42] that we can reflect the very thought of
[2:37:44] God he gave his word so it would
[2:37:46] reproduce the word in flesh
[2:37:49] God help us help us to consecrate
[2:37:52] ourselves help us to surrender ourselves
[2:37:55] help us to focus on what he's given us
[2:37:57] this whole world is set up to distract
[2:38:00] us from that Focus God help me to resist
[2:38:05] the distraction and stay focused on what
[2:38:09] he has given us and be sufficiently
[2:38:12] impressed with the word that is in our
[2:38:15] midst how many of you want to be changed
[2:38:17] into the image of the word
[2:38:20] amen then it's going to take absorption
[2:38:23] of the word to be changed into the image
[2:38:26] of the word may God help us I don't know
[2:38:29] about you but I I was
[2:38:32] blessed I was
[2:38:34] challenged I was corrected amen and I
[2:38:37] was lifted up am I was encouraged to
[2:38:39] move forward I was given instruction
[2:38:41] amen all the things that that Paul told
[2:38:44] Timothy the word would do I received it
[2:38:47] today may God
[2:38:50] have his way with each one of us I hope
[2:38:53] you like me will leave these meetings
[2:38:55] better than when I came having a clearer
[2:38:58] focus more determination a clearer
[2:39:00] vision and asking God to change me into
[2:39:05] the image of his
[2:39:07] word yeah one thing I realized is the
[2:39:11] true word will bring the true life amen
[2:39:15] the false word will bring a false life
[2:39:19] because the word will reproduce
[2:39:22] itself God give us
[2:39:24] revelation of your true word amen men
[2:39:29] God is
[2:39:30] good I just want to say we love you all
