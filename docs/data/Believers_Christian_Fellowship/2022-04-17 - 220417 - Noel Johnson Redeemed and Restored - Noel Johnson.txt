wonderful earth will grow [Music] let's just pray our most gracious and loving heavenly father we've gathered ourselves together this morning lord to worship you we honor the resurrection brother adam says we do that every sunday but lord today is a special day in the christian world when lord they pause to acknowledge that yeah you did rise but yet lord they don't have the understanding of what the resurrection means but lord you sent a prophet to us in this generation that we could fully understand that when you rose from the dead lord it has a special significance for your bride take me lord as your instrument this morning and use me tell me to relax in you and i'm asking you lord to take control of my thoughts and my mind the lord the things that are said wouldn't be my thoughts but lord they'd be yours and the words that are spoken lord they would come from you bless us lord with your presence and bless us through your word for i ask it in jesus most precious name amen while you're standing if you'd open up unto leviticus the 25th chapter and we'll read verses 47 down to 49. the thought this morning if i could put it that way it's we have been redeemed and we have been restored in leviticus it says and if a sojourner or a stranger wax rich by thee and their brother that dwelleth by him wax poor and shall sell himself into the stranger or sojourner by thee or to the sock of the stranger's family after that he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his brethren may redeem him either his uncle his uncle's son may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him or if he be able he may redeem himself you can be seated in christianity today the christian world anyway they celebrate the resurrection but yet they take in in the what's going on within the christian world they have easter eggs and easter bunnies they have all kinds of paganism but this is the time of the year also that the jewish people celebrate the passover because it's in the passover they go back into their history and they begin to look at what happened to them when they were delivered from egypt and when we begin to understand what jesus christ did at the cross he redeemed us and he delivered us from sin he delivered us from the power of in the bondage of satan he came to set us free where we no longer have to be a slave to sin we no longer have to be a slave to sickness we no longer have to be a slave to satan but he set us free and that is the significance if you will of the resurrection because when he rose brother branham says we rose with him when he rose he proved who he was when he rose all of a sudden all of the promises that had been made all the promises of the scripture now has been open to us it isn't supposed to be a struggle with us it's not supposed to be we're striving for this or striving for that but when we begin to fully comprehend calvary and what calvary has accomplished for us it makes it so really we should be able to come in our christian life we should be able to rest in him realizing it's not about us and what we do but it's about him and what he has done for us because like i say this is christianity this this is the significance of calvary god we cannot save ourselves that like it talks about there in leviticus a person he was taken he was sold into and he sold himself into slavery he waxed poor and so and and when we were born into this world we we were sold into slavery we were sold into slavery because of our natural birth but somebody was able to come along in leviticus it says the near kin can come along to him and they can take him and they can restore him they can redeem him they can they can make him so no longer is he bound to the taskmaster that he had sold himself to no longer is he under the under the obligation to obey that taskmaster but he's able to take and he's able to take him and he's able to go back and he'd be able to be free and he can go back to the land that that his forefathers had had and he's able to go back and in freedom and and he can rejoice in the fact that all of a sudden now he's no longer a slave but see too often we think we're slaves too often we look at ourselves and our flesh and our flesh has its limitations but too often satan keeps coming along and says no you are my slave you must obey what i command you to do you must sit there and i will i will put a sickness on you i will i will cause problems in your life and and i will make you my slave i will dictate to you the life that you will live i will dictate to you the the problems that you're going to have i'm gonna i am going to control you and so often that's what we live under we live under this fact that we believe satan still controls us we live under the fact that we have to listen to him but really we don't calvary set us free that is the significance of calvary that is the significance of the resurrection and this is the subject if we will in this morning the bible says in galatians the third chapter it says but the scripture has concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ may be given to them that believe when we go and we begin to understand god's plan and purpose of plan of redemption he had to make it so that he so that anybody would be able to be able to accept the salvation which god is offering to them if it had been based upon works it would leave a lot of us out it was based upon genealogy it would leave a whole bunch of people out so what he did was he said that he he leveled the playing field he made it so that everyone that comes into this world you're born in sin you're shaped in iniquity you come to the world speaking lies and you're all under the dominion of satan you're all under the bondage of him but he says it comes he says we were so we were all under sin that that the level of the playing field but the promise by the faith of jesus christ he says that is what sets us free and who gives us the faith jesus christ gave you that faith why did you accept him as your savior why have you accepted this message because god has given you the faith to be able to accept this i look at the people that i used to grow up with why did i accept jesus christ why did not to punish the people in my in the classmates why not why didn't they not accept it i look around and and within the message lord why have you kept me in this message because there's a lot of things that have come along all the false doctrines and all the false teachings and all the things which go with it why have you enabled me to remain steady why have you been able to keep me in the center of the line why the others have drifted off here and drifted off there it isn't the fact that i have kept myself with the fact that he has kept me i know elijah was having a pity party one day and after he had this marvelous example of god's power up on mount carmel and he was he sat there and he called down the fire from heaven and consumed the sacrifice and all that stuff and after this mighty display of power then then uh jezebel said i'm going to take you and i'm going to kill you just like you did my prophet my my uh priests and so he was running away and finally he ended up in a mountain and he went god asked him what are you doing here so i'm the only one left i'm the only one that deserves you i'm the only one that loves you i'm the only one that cares about you no i've you know basically i've had enough take me home and god says now well just just wait a minute he says you're not the only one i have reserved to myself seven thousand that have not bowed the knee to baal god reserved they could not keep themselves god kept them who's keeping you god's keeping you he's watching over his bride some of god's going to have a bride no he has one and we are we are that bride and he has watched over us to ensure us that we will make it to the end of the journey brother branham says e fell but he says they're coming there's coming a bride the second eve and he says she cannot fall because i will ensure she cannot fall i will ensure that she will not be deceived i will ensure that she can she won't drift away off to the right or to the left no i have reserved to myself my bride and i am watching over my bride and i'm going to see to it that my bride finishes the journey that my bride will never fall my bride will never accept something which is false no my bride i will watch over her i will protect her i will keep her so it's not you keeping you it's god keeping you this should allow you to relax i mean not relax to the point where you just kind of accept any piece of trash that comes down the road no but it's able to relax in christ saying god you've seen me this far you've taken care of me this far and so lord i'm relying upon you to continue to watch over me and to keep me and to guide me i'm relying upon you to give me the revelation of your word that i have need of for today and if we can get into that that understanding it takes a lot of the struggle out it takes to me it takes a lot of the worry out god you've carried me this far you've watched over me this far you've protected me this far well if you've done this far i expect you to continue the journey i expect you to continue to watch over me and take care of me because i have committed myself to you lord and i believe i'm part of your bride and that makes me a part of you but lord i'm relying upon you to keep me i'm not relying upon myself it goes on in galatians but before it came but before faith came we were kept under the law we were set up unto the faith that we should afterward were revealed why was the law given to take the jewish nation and to sit there and and to have them to remain as an entity so that god in the end could bring jesus christ through them the law was to keep them and when you look at the jewish nation it's the law that has separated them when we lived in israel um we we could visit in their house but they could not come and visit in ours we could we did not keep our house kosher we had milk and meat together that was forbidden for them and if in during this time of year also during the passover i think during the time anyway they have to go through their house and have to remove all of the leaven and so in essence in their home they have two kitchens two sets of pots two sets of pans two sets of everything and only use one time a year so that's that's all walled off that's all protected out and so the certain time of the year all of a sudden they take that curtain down and then they used to use those at your which were one time a year for one week okay the law was kept so like i say we could visit them they could not visit us okay but here again that's what kept them separate it's the the food the food laws which they have and a few other things but the law kept them so that so that that seed could remain pure so that christ could come he said it goes on in verse 24 it says wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to christ that we might be justified by faith it's under the law that we understand god what god is expecting of us when we become a christian we become aware of god we become aware of his holiness we become aware of his purity we become aware of the fact that in him there is no darkness in him there is no sin in him there is no shadow of turning no he is pure and he is righteous and he is holy but he expects us to be that also it isn't up to us we can live any kind of a life it isn't up to us we can go and become part of the world and interact with the world and just make it so that there's no difference between us and between them no the law shows us what god expects us to be the law of the law shows us how he expects us to act and how he expects us to live and some people they look at the law and says oh man this is so restrictive oh i can't go here and i can't go there and i can't do this and i can't do that and oh i wish i wasn't a christian because then i could go ahead and i could groove the world and do the things i want to do well if that's your opinion you never met jesus christ because see when you come to jesus christ it's a love affair it's a love relationship between you and between him he says if you love me he says then you'll keep my commandments and the commandments will not be burdensome to you but because you love me he says you will do this and you will do this willingly because of the love that you have for me it goes on and says but after that faith has come he says we are no longer under a schoolmaster for we are all the children of god by the faith in jesus christ when faith actually comes when we believe on jesus christ as our savior and then we accept him as our savior and we go through the water baptism and we're and we and all of a sudden god comes and fills us with the holy spirit then something comes inside of us and no longer do we have to read the law no longer do are we concerned with obeying this and obeying that no but something comes inside of us and begins to change you from the inside out it isn't you struggling and striving to do this and struggling and striving to overcome no what you do is you learn to rest in god and then you let god perform his work through you he lets god change you he says in the new covenant he says i'm going to take my law and write them in their hearts and in their mind that means it's going to become literally a part of you the law and you you unite together the law and you literally becomes one and therefore you keep the law because now it's your nature to do that and therefore if it's your nature to do that it's no longer a struggle in ephesians 2 and 14 it says for he is our peace who hath made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make of himself twain one new man so making peace and that he might consider that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby when jesus christ came he fulfilled the law when jesus christ came that he he took and by his sacrifice at calvary he fulfilled the requirements of the law to redeem that which was a part of him from the beginning and in jesus christ he now there's in jesus christ there is no distinction between jew and gentile we're all one body in jesus christ because the law and the commandments the food laws and all those other things they've all gone by the wayside i know when we lived in israel for a while we it was easy for us as christians to all of a sudden take on jewish traits as all of a sudden easy for us to go ahead and partake of their of the uh of the different festivals which they have and and there it's it's it's there was a pressure put upon us because of the country which we were living in and those that had remained in israel even today they're more jewish they're more israelite if you are than they are christian in fact a lot of them have forsaken christianity and basically they have been assimilated into the jewish economy but see we we were not supposed to become assimilated into the jewish economy no we were to remain separate we were still we were to show them what jesus christ is we were to show them that the law has been done been done away with and right and by now by being in jesus christ he says now there's a freedom that we have because now that law has become a part of us we keep the law because it's our nature to do so because here again that's christianity going on in galatians 4 it says now i say that in heir as long as he is a child he differed nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but as under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father so it says even so we when we were children were under the bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth the son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them they were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of a son into your hearts crying of a father he goes on here and says we were in the world you're subject to the world satan was our master he was the one that controlled our lives he was the one that dictated he was the one that directed us he was the one by his by his demons or whatever like that he would sit there and he would he would swing you this way and he would swing you that way and because we're in flesh this there the flesh likes the world it's what you grew up with it's what you grew up in why do you some people like sports i was never any good at it so i never really developed an in any liking for it but i mean but there's a lot of people i mean i see as their children were growing up the father liked football his son likes football and so they played football and in in essence i guess there's nothing wrong with that i mean i was i was never any good at it i was always short couldn't run fast in fact i remember once they finally gave me the football in in one of the in grade school well i ran toward the wrong goal i got all the way to that one and somebody says hey that's the wrong one really so i had to run the whole length going the other direction and invite all these people trying to tackle me that shows you how much i knew about football but here but here again but i watched i watched the young people but see sports is competitive and where i and in one regard i don't brother branham brother brown when he was he was playing with something they were throwing darts and i think brother perry greene made mention of the fact when he was up there camping with him on brother branham could take darts and he could throw them in the bull's eye every time not miss one but then when he was playing against somebody else he would let you win he would sit there you might you might hit you know the 10 and the five and something like that well he would sit there and he would miss the whole thing a couple three times and he would hit the ones and the fours or whatever but he wanted the other one to win brother branham was not competitive he wanted you to experience the joy it was of being the one hey man look at me look at look at i i beat the prophet well no he let you win okay i mean be be honest with yourself but brother branham it's it's not about complete about being competitive and even in christianity it's not about being competitive against other people i i am me good bad or indifferent i am what i am i mean yeah there was once i tried to mimic another minister and i felt flat on my face twice and figured enough of that so i'll just go ahead i'll be me and uh yeah like i say good bad and different i am what i am by the grace of god and i have my own style some people like it some people don't that's their problem not mine because i can't be anything other than what i i am but we're not being competitive against each other we are in a race to run but it's not running against somebody else we're running against ourself because satan sits there and he will try and hinder and he will try and make it so you don't finish the race and he will try and put obstacles in your path and so what you have to do is realize what he is trying to do because there is a goal which has been set before us and we are trying to reach that goal which means sometimes we have to jump over the hurdles we have to go around the obstacles we have to do all these other types of things but there's a goal which is set before us and the problem that we have as ourselves because sometimes we get weary and well doing sometimes all of a sudden something an obstacle comes up and we look and figure man there ain't no way i can overcome that one and if you rely upon yourself then no you can't but if you go back into the scriptures and says lord i can do all things through you that strengthens me and if you can and so i can do all i could overcome everything that said that is said in the past that it's in my way i can overcome everything because you are the one in me and you are going to enable me to to run the race and to complete that which you've given to me to do and says he came to redeem when the fullness of time came god sent forth the son made every woman under the law he had to be born under the law because he had to fulfill that law he had to be born into under the jewish culture because he had to fulfill the jewish law but so the fullness of time came he came in god's timing and god's purpose he came and he fulfilled that law he he lived a life of perfect a perfection like jesus asked me who can who can condemn me of sin well he never he never sinned he always fulfilled the law but he did that and then he was hung upon the cross as the sacrifice for our sins for my sins and because he did that now now all of us and i can overcome everything through him but he did that so he could redeem me he could set me free from satan he could he can make it so satan no longer has and has any authority over me satan no longer no longer has the right to control me i give him the opportunities that's true but that's my fault not what god has done but he came to redeem me why so i can come to adoption and brother branham says adoption means that your name on the book is on the check is the same as if if it's god speaking and we are coming to the time in in we are coming to the time when we are supposed to be coming into adoption we as the bride of jesus christ are going to be the final are going to be the final example to this world so we have to come to adoption a full adoption will not take place until the changing of our body but brother branham talks about it in other places he says no he says he says the bride should already be approaching this this this thing and then we saw it in brother bradham oh he was there on son running for squirrels and god spoken to him and says where do you want how many squirrels do you want he says well i want three well where do you want the first one so god instructed brother branham to speak the word it wasn't brother brown says hey i'm here in the here in in in hunting out for squirrels all right let's just speak the word if he'd have been under his own unction no it never would have happened but god instructed him when he was up there up there in colorado and all of a sudden the storm came god says turn around and go back up the mountain oh well that means i'm going to die i mean that's what he thought and then god spoke to him and says speak to the storm oh uh he said what you say that's exactly what it'll be so he spoke it and exactly what he spoke that's exactly what happened but see there was under god's instruction you can't just have the spoken word just because you think you can speak it i i wrestled with this a little bit before because i was thinking about you know what can what can i do as a son what rights and privileges do i have as god's son the bible says you have not because you asked not so it's free to ask and when somebody is sick we ask we pray we claim the promises we go back to the scriptures god this is your promise to us and so we begin to speak based upon the promises god has given unto us but now if it comes down to the having the spoken word that to me is something different because then that has to come from the unction of god that has to be and this is my opinion okay but i god has to tell me to speak it or god has to direct me to speak it i know we had one brother in our church and he had operation on his elbow the doctor the doctors did the best which they could but then he developed an infection in it so the doctors treated him with the antibiotics and it seemed to go away and then it came back well then they had to go in and clean it all out again and put more antibiotics in it and okay and it seemed to reside and then it came back it can only happen so many times and then they have to amputate and then god instructed me he says i want you to go pray for him i says well there's the pastor there's the deacons there's a trust station or who am i to go and you know and i hate driving into charlotte but i was obedient i went and we found where he was at what room and then uh we talked a little bit and he said you know why i'm here he says well no not really i said god told me that this is not a physical problem this is a spiritual problem and so i have come to rebuke that spirit that's causing that infection so that you can be healed and believing god had sent me i prayed in that manner then the infection went away and everything went fine but here again that was by god leading for me all of a sudden the guns are called down the fire from heaven and says you know and command this and command that no i have to have an unction i have to have a leading i have to believe that it's god's will for me to do and to say the things which i do to redeem them they were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of a son into your heart's crying abba father which means you recognize god is your father you have earthly parents that may be true but yet god himself is your father and do you understand the implications of that statement if god is your father that means you are his son and because you are his son their privilege would just go away which co which you know which is is part of of being a son and as you grow and and brother branham talks about how his sister a father will take his son and he will train him in the business until finally after the after the sun has reached the level of maturity where where he the father can trust his son with the business then he will begin to turn the business over to his son and then after a while he takes his son out and adopts him into the family which means whatever he says is the same as the father saying but see this is where the bride should be coming you are god's child god is your father and if you could recognize god is your father and you can learn to be obedient to your father and he will teach you how to rule in the kingdom that god has put you into then and only then can he trust you with the spoken word brother brown says power power without character is satanic you don't believe that look at our government but yet if you begin to understand that you that if god if christ's character can come and be manifested in you and it's no longer you living but christ living through you then the very character of christ is in you and when that character of christ is in you and you become obedient unto the father then he can begin to trust you it took brother branham in his life brother branham was in one place and and uh he god told him he says there's a trap laid for you and he wouldn't tell brother branham what it was so then what happened was all of a sudden in brother brown's meeting all of a sudden a couple of young people were sitting on the front row and they started making love to each other and brother branham warned her two or three times don't do that there's other places to do that and then god spoke to him and says what you say that is what will happen and there's a pause in that sermon and then brother rahm says i forgive you for that because god was going to test him what will you do with the spoken word but the character of christ came over and and took control and and it was god it was it was christ speaking through him i will forgive you for that and from that point on then god can trust him with more and more of the spoken word and first john or in john 1 and going from 10 to 13. it says jesus christ was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god you were born because you are a part of god from the beginning in the process of time you came into manifestation god watched over your parents and grandparents however many generations back to bring you to the to bring you to the place where you are now with all the characters and faults and and and and whatever else they can't came along with it but he came along and he placed you in this generation because you are going to be the final manifestation of god to this earth they tell me when a relay race they sit there they save the strongest one to last you are the strongest ones you are a part of god from the beginning so what did he do he reserved you for this generation because he knew he could take control of your bodies and he could begin to express himself through you and so you are in a race to run and but all those that have gone on before us they cannot be made perfect without us they're waiting for us to finish the race they're waiting for us to come into the manifestation of the sons of god they're waiting for us to so become one with jesus christ until it's no longer i who live but christ who lives in me and then when we come to that place in our in our christian walk then all of a sudden god can trust us and god can begin to manifest and express himself through us in christ the mystery of god revealed brother branham makes a statement making his mystery known to his bride tree redeemed by christ the second adam going back home to be restored back to the original edom free from death sickness sorrow shame going back with eternal life christ redeemed us the second adam to take us back home to take us back to be what god intended for us to be in him from the beginning you're sons and daughters of god you're living in this world as we age we have problems well but but god is going to take us back to the eden condition he's going to take us back to the place where we can actually live as sons and daughters of god without the clumberson-ness of the flesh that we now live in and this is where he he redeemed us he did all of this to carry us back into that point but see we're at the end of all things we're at the time when god wants to sow it wants to sow come and live in us until it's no longer us living but christ and when we can come to that when we can come to that position then then all of a sudden god can begin to live and manifest himself through us and then we can begin to experience what it would have been like in eden then we can have peace then we can begin to then we can we can rejoice in the holy spirit we can enter into his presence we can come when adam was when adam and eve were in the garden there was open fellowship with god there wasn't anything to hinder them but see in christ now we also enter into that relationship because of the blood god doesn't see us he looks at us through the blood brother branham expresses that and so what do we begin to understand i have open fellowship with my father sin is not there as a barrier between me and between him when i make a mistake i confess it once i've confessed it's in the sea of god for forgetfulness and then i've reestablished my relationship i have not always been a perfect child there were times i aggravated my mom onto the place where she looked at me and said wait till your dad gets home and boy i knew i was in trouble then so when dad came home from work i made sure he had his slippers made sure he had a glass of water made sure the paper was there where he wanted it and he knew all right what did you do today oh nothing dad i was the perfect little angel so let me talk to your mom and then i would have to go out and get a switch and then i would stand up for dinner but i was always his son i had to suffer the consequences of what i had done during that day but i was always his son well i am god's son well if i make mistakes yeah i have to there are penalties which have to be you know you you reap what you sow but still god in his mercy lots of times he will he will make it not as bad as it could be but here again but it comes down down to the to the place that i i am his son and he's taking me back to the place where once i've confessed my faults once i've confessed that i have done wrong then all of a sudden i have reestablished that relationship and after my dad made it so i had to stand up for dinner then he would come and he would love me and he would say it's all right you're still my son i still love you okay so the relationship here again was reestablished brother branham makes mention of the fact when i study the message i gain understanding not revelation understanding i understand different things but i have i lack the revelation of some of those things i can say i am a son of god i have that by knowledge i have that because the scriptures tells me that i have that because god told me that but i don't have the full revelation of what it is to be a son and being able to have all the manifestations and being able to to experience and be able to express god in the way that i desire to but we're coming to a time when all of a sudden god is opening his word and his understanding to us even more and more and one of these days the revelation of what god has tried to tell us through the prophet one of these days that revelation will come and see god holds that revelation you can study all that you want i mean that what the bible tells us in the old testament they're the the prophets and stuff after they prophesied they looked at this and trying to figure out how is this going to happen how is he going to come what's he going to manifest what's he going to do this how is he going to do that and they became totally different than what they their imagination was and so here again when we look at what's going on in the world today um we didn't figure covert would come we didn't figure russia would invade ukraine we didn't figure ukraine would put up the fight that it's doing we didn't figure we didn't figure all the mess that's going on within our within our our our nation but see god knew all of these things because it's like i think my brother chad made mention once when um joshua was out there he was overlooking the city and all of a sudden the angel appeared unto him and joshua pulled out his sword are you forced or for the enemy he said neither one i'm not for you and i'm not for your enemy i'm here to make sure that the word of god is fulfilled i'm here to make sure that god's plan that he has already purposed before the foundation of the world i am here to make sure that is fulfilled so it doesn't matter what we see going on in our nation doesn't matter what we see going on into the world god is sovereign in what he does he wants his word fulfilled and he is fulfilling that word but it goes on on on here and um it's it is a so it's christ expressing this is mystery of god reveal he says so it's christ expressing himself in the individual he says the new birth is birth is christ the new birth it's christ it's a revelation it's the revelation of god living in you and this is the revelation he said god has revealed to you this great mystery this mystery of what brother brown or paul wrote about this mystery the great mystery which has been hidden from time and memorial all the way down through the scriptures he said but now this mystery is being revealed unto you which is christ living in you he goes on and to say he said that he said so god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's the new birth he said he said oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is so when the final revelation comes of what we are that's when the rapture will come but see god holds that revelation if we knew who we were if we had the full revelation of what it means to be a son and daughter of god if we had the full revelation every everything that christ purchased for us at calvary if we had that full revelation within ourselves today we'd be out of here because there'd be no question i know i can do this i know i can command satan i know i can cast out the devils i know i can go and heal the sick i know i can raise the dead i can know i can stop the storm i know i can walk on the water i know i can do all these things because i'm god's son that's what jesus did we look at brother brown's life and ministry look at what god did through him and people want to limit what god did through him to him no he god was showing us what we are this is what you can do but you have to have the faith to believe it you have to have the revelation that what this is what god is trying to instruct you this is what god is trying to tell you this is who you are you are a son and daughter of god and as a son of god he says these are the things which you can naturally do by virtue of who you are and it goes on in in in the revelation of jesus christ he said satan knows that if the people can get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her we're in a battle and the battle is raging satan knows his end is coming too close he knows that he has to hinder us he knows that he has to keep us from getting the revelation of who we are but seek was once said revelation come satan's power will be powerless before him before before him so here again it comes down to the place where where when we begin to understand we're still going to be in a battle we're still going to be fighting but we but we will understand no i don't have to put up with this satan go pack your bags and leave i don't want you here anymore i'm tired of you have you harassing me i'm tired of the sickness i'm tired of the pain i'm tired of all the things which you have been doing in my life and the lives of other people and then we can command and because by virtue of who we are and then be having the revelation of who we are the fact that we are god so just we are god's children and we are the bride of jesus christ and we and all that jesus christ is we have access to when we begin to understand that then all of a sudden satan pops up his ugly head and we can hit him and the more he pops up his head eventually we get him bloody nose and black eyes kick him in the shin walk all over his back and do whatever else we can do to him but it comes down to the place when that revelation fully comes into us now yes say don't put up a battle he always does he always he always will but then we will have the ability to to command him like i said when you're when i when i was drafted into the army they they trained me to be able to be a lab tech others they tried to go out into the battlefield and shoot i went in as a conscientious objector therefore i wasn't i never trained with a rifle okay because i figured oh one of those might be my brother and i would hate to shoot my brother well i'm after you've been there for a little while yeah give me a rifle okay let's get down to business but here again but but we we have while i was over there in vietnam i mean the battle was there i mean the base camp that i was in they lob mortars into the base camp that i was living staying in um [Music] we had a helicopter and they had sandbags all the way around it well they lobbed one one mortar right on the middle of the guy's blades and destroyed it they knew where we were they knew how to hit us well we also knew how to hit them but here again it's a war but here again when we understand what we have access to when we begin to understand we have the power to command satan and we begin to see how satan works we begin to see all of a sudden you get in a nice church and all of a sudden satan will send somebody in and be nice and peaceful and quiet and all of a sudden he'll stick up his ugly head and try and create divisions within the congregation and when we begin to realize that then okay then we deal with it i know we had in the church i go to um at least brother brother henry greene i mean he had some people come into his into the church and he knew the spirit that guy had and so he hid it sunday after sunday after sunday after sunday until finally that person left they weren't going to convert so all and once that person left that he could get back to preaching the gospel to the rest of us but i mean here again but he knew he sensed that spirit and he knew that spirit was evil and he attacked it repeatedly day after every every service that there was okay but see this is this is the that's the function of the pastor i mean it's also the deacons and the trustees i mean i'm not limiting it to him but i mean once you understand how satan operates and you begin to notice the spirit that comes in he says you know then you can begin to do something you know brother branham often often makes a statement that we are him we're flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and this type goes back to adam and eve in the garden and this is what i want to concentrate on a little bit when we begin to understand what when god took and he created adam he took adam adam was a spirit being adam was in a theophany form and then god says no adam he says you're supposed to be the ruler of the world and for you to understand the world for you to understand the the people the the animals that you are subject over the jordan the control over you need to experience what they experience and so then he made a temple of clay for adam and he put that temple they put that spirit and put it in that temple and so then man became a living soul which means that's that soul that the theophany now came and began to dwell in that body and so there adam would begin to go and he would begin to see the animals and he would name them and he would rejoice over the fact what god had done but yet adam could not fellowship with anybody he could not relate to the animals i mean we have a pet dog you know we can throw his little toy and he'll run after it after about the third time he says i've had enough of this nonsense and he goes and crawls into his little house and goes for whatever well i can only fellowship with him so much when he wants to be petted he jumps on my lap when he doesn't want it all of a sudden he goes back he goes and finds his own little place to lay down okay but here again you can only fellowship with him so much so god he said okay adam you're lonely he says just like god said he was lonely because in god there was a father in god there was a family and he wanted to have fellowship with that family you're part of that family and so all of a sudden he took adam and he put adam to sleep he pulled out a rib and then he created another body for the and that and that's when he separated the the theophany of eve and put it in that body and so and here again so when eat when adam looked at eve he says your flesh is my flesh and your bone of my bone and god when he when he looked at them he called their name adam god never regarded them as two people he always regarded them as a single entity but see we were in jesus christ when in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god we were part of that the offending when god created that theophany that he himself dwelt in and this and this is where it all comes back down to this is this i mean when it talks about we're going to be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone we have to realize we always were a part of god we were part of that theophany that god created and eventually that theophany was made flesh and dwelt among us and brother brown says we were in that flesh and that body of jesus christ so when that body of jesus christ hung up on the cross he says we were in that then and when god judged that sin what did he do we were judged in that body then by taking our sins and nailing it to his cross that's why the bible says we can become the very righteousness of god see god made his in rising of the son he says when god made his first bridegroom he made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman in spirit form in spirit formed him in the dust of the earth to make him material and notice when he made eve from adam he took not another piece of clay he took from the same piece of clay the same word for adam was a spoken word he said he says see he he took from him and and then taken the he had the masculine feminine spirit he took the feminist spirit away from adam and placed it in eve so it's still a part of adam's spirit it's adam's flesh so eve was part of eve was adam eve was an expression of adam okay we are the bride of jesus christ we were in that theophany when that theophany was formed when god through that theophany began to create the world and all the things that we see around us when god began to do that we were a part of that the offending and so when that theophany came into flesh we were in him at that point in time wrote brother banham talks about that it says in in smyrnan church it says the very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took the place in the body thus the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she's also called the body of christ it's very apparent that that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him and came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god in a many-membered body whereas god before was only in in one member and so here again we have when we begin to understand we were always a part of god we were part of that theophany and if we were a part of that theophany what's he trying to do he's trying to get us back into what we were in him from the beginning brother branham says in in god who's rich in mercy i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and the scare you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of god so you always were a son of god for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before the before there well he says before he even became material on earth before there was anything but god you were in him you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he know the color of your hair you would have and you know all about you so god knows you because you're him because you are a part of him you are a part of him from the beginning you are flesh it was flesh and bone of his bone when when god created that that theophany you were part of that theophany when that theophany was taken and manifested in flesh then although we were we were part of that theophany were part of that flesh being and then when he was hung up on the cross and there he died brother battle says he says just like god took a part of adam and he made the body for eve he says when jesus christ was smitten he said what did it do that released the bride so so you're not just human beings you're not just people walking around in human flesh and have to struggle with this and struggle with that no you are you are a part of god you always were a part of god i mean brother branham god what god has been trying to tell the bride no you are jesus christ you literally you are jesus christ why because when it goes in brother man restoration the right jesus he says you're going to form what's known to me as your bride see all right i'll go he says you'll be part of me you'll be my bride my life will be in your body just as husband and wife as one person you and i are going to be one at that day you'll know that i am in the father the fathers and me i and you and you and me oh i just love that and satan gets so angry at that see the oneness of god you know what he's saying here you are a manifestation of god you are an expression of god and if you are the expression of god it basically in the way that he puts it here you don't just see the oneness of god he's almost elevating us to the place we're a part of the godhead we're not a part of the godhead and the fact that we can sit there and and we can do as we please we're not part of the godhead that we can dive on a cross for other people's sin no but we are an expression of god we we are to be the final voice to the final age we are to be the final manifestation of god in this age he said he said all that god was deported to christ and all the christ was important to the church he said there you are it makes them all one everything that god poured into jesus christ god emptied himself into jesus christ and jesus christ emptied himself into the bride and therefore the bride collectively is the fullness of the godhead bodily you are a part of god you are a manifestation of god you are an expression of god and so we need to start living like that we need to start acting like that we need we need to start taking the privilege that we have as being god's children and we need to be able to exercise that when we come across things which we have to fight against when all of a sudden satan throws something in our path we have the power to overcome that when all of a sudden i mean jesus christ he had his problems jesus christ i mean you know he he got hungry satan came to him and tempting him oh you think you're the son of god do you hmm fine if you are take these stones make them bread jesus says ah i could do that sure i could but it says it's written you shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god and satan says oh well this is different it takes him up to a pinnacle and says hey tell you what you see all those people down there yeah he says jump off and watch the angels come and take and glare guide you very gently down he says because then the scriptures say that he will give his angels charge over thee where you won't even stumble against a rock or whatever and jesus says you don't tempt god you don't put yourself into a situation where all of a sudden you you could where all of a sudden you you're you're trying to command god to do something that god never intended to do and he said all right tell you what bypass the cross if you are the son of god if you are the one that you say that you are he says the cross is your destiny tell you what worship me i'll give you the world jesus uh he says i'll get i'll get it in my under my own terms i'm not going to sit under your rulership but here again satan tempts us satan tries to control us satan does the things that he does trying to get us to deviate from the word because it's the word that we have to manifest it's the word that we have to obey it it's the word that god is trying to express through us and the life that we live all of it live that has to be the word made manifest into the generation which we're now living it says in first john it says in john john 1 he came into the world the world was made by him the world but the and the world knew him not he came unto his own which was the jews and his own received him not but as many received him to them gave you the power to become the legal right to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god god pre-pre-planned you when you would come he didn't have you come and luther's day he didn't have you come in methodist day he didn't have you come pentecostal day he had you for this day because he has a purpose for you being here it's not just to come to church and sing songs and worship that's part of it we need to glorify him because there's something in us that wants to glorify there's something in us that wants to worship and there's something in us that wants to pray there's something in us that desires that fellowship that desires their closeness that intimacy that we can have with god but he said we in this generation have to overcome satan we in this generation have to show satan you don't control us god controls us we're living in satan's eden but he doesn't control us he's always attacking us he's always trying to get us to deviate from the word he's always trying to have us make ourselves something that we're not but he's sitting there trying to sit there and put us in situations where all of a sudden we will we will disobey god's word we will try to glorify ourselves we're not to glorify ourselves or to glorify god it goes on a philippian in in in two philippians 2 5-10 he said let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus we are to think the same way he thought we are to consider ourselves the same way that he considered himself he says who being in the form of the full expression of god thought in that robbery to be equal with god but equal with god but made of himself no reputation took upon him the form the form of his servant and was made in the likeness of man when jesus christ was came into this world when he was born in the manger and we began when he knew who he was he thought it not robbery to equal with god he said i can claim to be god it's not taking away from god because i am god but he said he but he came he being a full expression of god he took upon himself the form of his servant some people think oh i have the power and look what i can do with the power if you have that attitude something's wrong because jesus came to serve jesus never used the power that he had for his own benefits if jesus wanted to be a millionaire he could have in his day i mean you know you set up a little stand and you have some people you want some water how much you want well you know 20 liters would be good okay bring some water over and he blesses it okay money money money come on no pay up oh um you want some bread how many loaves you want well five would be nice so you take one break off five puts the original one back come on pay up i mean if you had a business and you had no overhead everything's profit okay but that's not what he did he said they're they're out of wine in a in a wedding okay bring the water he blessed it he'd never charged him for when he had that little kid's lunch he fed he fed a multitude he never he they didn't take up an offering no they took up the remnant i mean he he he came to help others he would go and and he would heal the sick he would raise the dead he would cast out demons and the only thing he asked a couple of them he said i think some lepers came into him and says and says if you will you can make us clean he says do you actually believe that yes i believe that fine and by your faith you're cleansed and it came to the place where they had to exercise their faith but he healed them and never charge anything so what do we do we are servants to mankind we are servants to each other somebody comes to you and asks and says i'm having this i'm where i you know i need prayer i have i have this this illness and okay you are you are a priest a priest intercedes on behalf of someone else and so what do you do you pray for them and watch god heal them okay you're you're performing the function of a priest and you're also a king you're king over what you're king over a spiritual kingdom what is a spiritual kingdom he says we rule over satan's kingdom when you take and you cast out a demon what are you doing you're ruling over satan's kingdom you're telling satan you no longer can possess this body now you have to leave because i am commanding you to leave therefore we are kings and priests and we do this without without without expecting anything in return why do we go to foreign countries when we go to foreign countries we pay our own way i mean i've we've been to india 15 over 15 years um yeah i paid my own way i mean the first five years i had to rob my bank account just enough to buy my tickets because i felt led so i went there and we ministered unto others there was no offering there was nothing coming back but this was god led me to go so i went and after a while then god began to supply funds from other sources but still it wasn't mine and i'm still very careful with what i do with what i receive but i'm there to serve i'm there to take a group of people and try and encourage them through the word to try and get them to understand what god has done in this generation to try and get them to understand god has done something in our generation god sent a prophet to us so we could understand the word and you need to understand the word you need to be able to grasp hold of the mysteries which god has been revealing unto us unto us through the prophet's messages and so you go into church after church after church what are you trying to do you're trying to encourage them you're trying to lift them up you're trying to teach them as much as possible this is this is the message this is who you are this is what god is trying to do in your life and encourage them to sit there and stand up against satan and be able to do battle against against the evil one so jesus said being found in the fashion of a man he humbled himself and he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross jesus came to serve brother brown says in one place when you live your life for others you're looking heaven in the face if you're living your life to benefit yourself if you're living your life to a mass of wealth if you're living your life to just kind of make everything comfortable for yourself and in some ways that's not necessarily bad but it's what is your focus but when you begin to live your life for others you see somebody else have a need and says here i i can do that and we supply them and sometimes we supply them when it hurts but they have a need and i have the ability to supply that need if i don't supply that need if the bible say if you see your brother have need and you don't and you don't help him out he says you're worse than an infidel or something to that that effect so if you have the ability to help someone help them go out of your way to try and help them because that's what jesus would have done in the rising of the sun brother branham says now notice that this quickening power zoe bringing the word the mind that was in christ was the mind that was in christ was in you then i'm trying to show you that you when when you raised when god raised when god raised jesus from the dead he raised you also and also quickened through life with him you you neither are quick into life although you although then you were but an attribute in this thought but god had saw you all in him in the feminine see when god looked down upon that body he said remember he went there with you in him see god had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when jesus so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body see they are all one same word the same word spoken speaks of the groom speaks of the bride and so he's saying here that when jesus christ hung upon the cross we were there in him well if we were in him then and he died upon the cross for the sins of the world that means he died on the cross for my sins because i was in him and that means this my sins was judged in him at that point in time in colossians 2 and 13 it says and you being dead in the sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinance that was against that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross when he was nailed to the cross my sins were nailed to the cross then and so once i have once i make a mistake i confess that mistake he's already paid the price and therefore the slate is clean it goes on revelation of jesus christ brother brown says but it's still not real to most people because the revelation about the spirit is not there the word the word has not been quickened the bible says in second corinthians 5 21 that we have become the righteousness of god by our union with jesus christ did you get it it says we are the very righteousness of god himself by being in christ it says that he jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but he came sin for us that by our union with him we might become the righteousness of god if we accept the fact and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our union with him have have become the very righteousness of god to reject one is to reject the other to accept the one is to accept the other he became our sin sacrifice he became the final payment for our sins he's the propitiation that means that the debt has been paid and so by being in him and the thing is they're in him by being in him we are the very righteousness of god that is how god views us god does not view us by ourselves god views us in him if we can begin to understand that we are that we by being in him that's all that god views this is me or us this is him that's all god sees brother branham says god hears our voice speaking through the blood so when we net when we bow our knees or however we pray and we begin to speak unto god it's not us it's us speaking through him and that's all he sees he hears our voice speaking to him and therefore he will hear us because we are the righteousness of god himself because we are in him we are we are part of him satan will tell you oh he said why would god hear your prayers i mean look at the life that you live look at the mistakes that you make oh do you remember the mistakes from yesterday oh yeah that was bad what about last week remember that incident last week oh yeah that was terrible oh and then you think you're going to pray to god and god hear you well man i guess not you know i mean why would god hear hear me being a sinner but i'm not a sinner i'm him you are the very righteousness of god himself because you are in him what did god do with adam and eve in the garden they sinned so what did god do he went looking for them for one and they were hiding in the bushes and god says oh you made a mistake okay things are going to change but then god went out and he found two animals he slew those animals and he took the sacrifices of those animals and gave it to adam and eve whenever god looked at adam and eve what did he do all he saw was the sacrifice he was reminded constantly the price for their sins had been paid for and now i can have fellowship with them and what did god do for us he slew he he hung up on the cross for my sins and so what did he do he clothed me in that sacrifice so now what does he do whenever he looks at me he has to see the sacrifice because i am in him and because i am in him i am the very righteousness of god god does not view me as a sinner you know one of the things when i was in baptist and pentecostal church you know we were they there was something they always emphasized he says you are a sinner saved by grace the emphasis you're a sinner you're no good rotten individual you sin every day you make mistakes every single day how do you think or god's going to look at you how are you going to never make it to heaven oh he says you're nothing but a sinner a sin or a sinner and you have to do this penance and that penance and you have to do this and you have to do that so you're always under condemnation oh lord i'm sorry i'm just a no good sinner but i have a need this morning if you could forgive me my little sins my you know and so there's always the condemnation but this message tells me something else you are a son and daughter of god which has been fully restored to your rightful position with your father because of the sacrifice that god did at calvary and if you can accept the fact that god that jesus christ died on the cross for your sins that your sins were nailed in the body of jesus christ as he hung up on the cross if you can accept that fact you are yes you are our sinner saved by grace but also you are a son and a daughter of god has been fully restored to your rightful position with your father and so whenever you go before god you don't go before him as a sinner saved by grace you go before him as a son and daughter of god that has been fully restored you are the very righteousness of god himself because you are in jesus christ you are a part of the godhead and that we have to be brother brown says if you if you're going to accept him as being your sacrifice then you have to accept that you're the righteousness of god if you don't accept that you're the righteousness of god then you're not believing in calvary that's kind of a flat statement but that's basically the way it comes down to so quit looking at yourself as a no-good rotten sinner realize you're living the flesh you make mistakes you will always make mistakes brother brown talks about you have a of nature so what happens is the will burn h will always cause you problems but he says inside of you there's a wheat inside of you there has been a transformation of your very nature that dwells within you and eventually that nature will begin to express itself brother brown says when you receive the holy ghost he says it comes in about the size of a button and he says what happens then you begin to get into the word you begin to get into the message you begin to get into prayer and what does it do it begins to grow and grow and grow and grow and as it grows it bid and begins to push out all the all the corruption and all the diseases and all of your sin and all of your sickness and all of your other things until eventually you become the very righteousness of god until event the bible says you are predestined to be conformed to the image of his son i will be because it's predetermined i mean that's what predestination means god has predetermined that i will become the very i will come into the very image of jesus christ there's a lot of work to be done i admit to that but yet god has predetermined that is my end but we're in the bright age we are in the time when god is going to so dwell within the bride until it's no longer her living but now is god himself living through her and we have to come into that we are at the end of the end i mean i'm people ask me you know i don't pay attention to the world really what i'm doing is i'm looking for my father and my mother and my brother to all of a sudden come and sit down have breakfast with me one day they've passed on sure but there'll be a resurrection and when there's a resurrection i expect them to come and knock on my door and say hey we have we want to have some breakfast wow all right and then i know 40 days later i'm going to become a young man again that's what i'm looking for but see we're there this is not a pipe dream this is not something in the far-off part you know whatever no this is the reality of the hour we are living in you look at what's going on in the world you know you know all those what's what russia is doing this is the fulfillment of scripture they're threatening to bomb us well first for the first one ever hits i get my change am i worried about the world events no because god is sovereign god is performing his will god is the one dictating the world events going on around us and what is he doing in the dictating of all these events he's making it so that the resurrection is um is upon us and all of a sudden the changing of my body is eminent and i'm looking forward to that i'm looking forward to being 120 pounds again i'm looking forward not to have some of the things that comes with aids but we're there really we are there in restoration of the bride to he said he says you will be a part of me you'll be my bride my life will be in your body but just like husband and wife as one person you and i are going to be one at that day you'll know i am in the father the father's in me i am in you and you and me oh i just love that jesus gets hate and gets so angry he says don't you see the oneness of god we are part of that godhead we are we are god god wants to take and so use his bride until the bride becomes a pro-manifestation of god himself brother branham in the masterpiece he says he says i'm using this in a parable now of the bride the masterpiece that's coming forth as the masterpiece fell there was a masterpiece rising the masterpiece fell at an icy rome after nia rome he said she's come she's come through a process but she is coming right back again into the masterpiece perfected because she's a part of that word that was spoken by him the church has gone through the church ages but now we're at the completion we're at the fulfillment of all of these things the process that began in the day of pentecost so the process began in niagara he says that that process is coming to its final end and we're part of that process we are part of the thing that all of a sudden we will become him literally we will become him he he will sow and dwell us until it's no longer i but christ now living and manifesting himself through me christ the mystery of god revealed oh if god can get him get him prisoners like that talking about paul now that's when he can express the preeminences you see he's got he's got the manner of the person so that he knows nothing but christ you get what i mean he says all right he said first he wanted to express himself completely god in christ that he succeeded how could god express himself through jesus christ jesus christ had to give up his will to do the will of the father he had to give up his ambitions to do the will of the father he had to give him all his desires to do the will of the father that's the only way that god could have the preeminence when that person becomes totally submitted unto the father that dwelt within him so second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them god can only express himself as we allow him to do that you can stop god do you realize that when god told me to go to charlotte and pray for the brother i could have said no i'm too busy traffic's too heavy i don't feel like going i don't want to do this and god never has a plan b moses you're going to lead him out but i don't want to go i don't care you're going anyway well i can't speak right okay aaron will be a prophet but you're going jonah god says i want you to go to nineveh i don't like those people i ain't gonna go i'll show you what i'm gonna do i'm gonna get in a boat and i'm gonna as far away from here as i can that cost him three days in a whale's belly and right after the fish vomited him out god says now will you go well okay he wasn't exactly a willing servant but yet he had to obey because god commanded him to god didn't say well okay you want to go fine i'll find somebody else to go no you are going well in today's world what is he doing he says you're going to go why is chad over in poland because god directed him to go why has he gone to other places because god directed him to go why did my wife i go to india because god directed us to go okay we're just trying to do god's bidding we're just trying to do what god instructs us to do but he has to have the preeminence you know it's interesting when i'm in india i realize i have no control i'm in the states i think i do i'm finding even in the states i don't we we went to uh arizona last year and i had my i had my bad habit i itemized i list everything i'm going to be here this day this year this day this day i'm going to minister here this you know i had all lined out for the whole month yeah we landed and i got a call you can't stay in the house that we're going to stay in because somebody else is in it oh so we go to plan b and then i was going to help my brother he had just bought a house and they were remodeling it and so i was going to visit with him on the saturday you can't stay here he says i'm called to minister on wednesday i've got to prepare all right scratch that plan so we did something else we get there and like every day changed every day changed but i had to learn to not rely upon my plan get up in the morning well lord here i am today what do you want done i make my plans and um we get a phone call and everything changes okay this wasn't important for me to do today this is what we're going to do today but it if if it wasn't the fact that i was willing to submit my will in that regard i would be very frustrated because my nature is to plan it in fact my pastor gets he jokes to me says you have the whole year planned out don't you well yeah don't you so it's a standing joke with us now anymore but but if we come to the place it's no longer what i want it's what does he want done today and thirdly he says to restore the kingdom to its right foot rightly position that fell uh that fell by sin and the first adam back there we're he's trying to get us back to the eden condition in christ the ministry of god of god revealed he says god expressed in jesus christ who was both father and son and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminence all that god was he poured into christ no the christ was he's poured into the church the believers and so now we have to begin to understand where does god dwell i'm looking at him literally i am looking at god because you are now the expression of him and the more you can yield yourself to him the more of him you can express but you have to be willing to yield you have to be willing to give up your will your desires and your you know everything until literally you can take yourself and put yourself in the hand of god and says lord here i am use me and mean it i mean the prophets some of them one one of the guys i think it was ezekiel all of a sudden um god says you're going to be an example to the people he says i want you to sit there and ration out your food but you're going to mix cow manure with it ah that doesn't sound appetizing and then what i think was isaiah he had to walk naked for about two or three years okay i mean some people might enjoy that but i don't think in that time it was a good idea but here again they were they had to do what god directed them to do anyway you know just because we only have a portion of the holy spirit does not limit the power that dwells within us we have electrical outlets those are connected to a fuse panel the fuse panel determines the amount of amperage that will flow through that circuit okay if it wasn't for that you plug something in there and you try and draw 40 amps out of that it'll pop you won't allow that okay but we are an outlet but see there's no fuse box god if god wants to flow through us a hundred percent let him flow you are the one that limits him you are the one that says no i can't do that. you're the one who says well lord that's more than i think i can handle today and let's let's plan it for another day no no god says i want you to do something and i wanted to do it now and he's expecting you to say okay where do you want me to go it says jesus christ the mystery he says what what was jesus manifested for to show god he was god he had to be no man could die no prophet could die he was god he he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was of the kings he was the history he says you know and and through and he was the history and and he was that was to come he there was this okay and through that and through that purpose he and through the purpose he achieved the church that he the fullness of god might bring to pass every promised word of god in these last days when he gets the preeminences the preeminence in the church to position his place within the church so god has to come to the we have to come to the place where we're willing to allow god to have the preeminence preeminence implies total control we were satan say i mean i said we gave satan the preeminences before why not give it to god this time why not allow him to rule and reign in our hearts and our lives because you're his sons and his daughters you were a part of him from the beginning and now he's wanting to use you to express himself through you it's not about you it's about him it's not what you do for him it's what you will allow him to do through you christ the commissioner of god going on now he sanctified or set apart for his purpose with his spirit and blood a church that he might that he might make every promise in this last day to be revealed he said that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express himself in christ then express himself through the church and the same thing christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them he said this is god's great mystery of love expressed that god and man became one see the whole thing is god and man one god and man was one there and god and man is one here see what it is being filled with the spirit him having the preeminences when we go into revelations chapter 3 14 it says unto the angel the church of the ladies write these things saith the amen the faithful and through witness the beginning of the creation of god jesus christ was the beginning of that creation we are to be the final creation we are to be that final expression of god to this earth so as jesus was the beginning of the and how did he become that creation it talks about the dove and the in in the church and its condition brother brown says the dove and the lamb united together that's when god and man became one that's when heaven and earth embrace each other hallelujah that's when god was made flesh that's when god came down from the spirit form and was made man and dwelt among us so what happens when you receive the holy spirit when you were born you were sons and daughters of god then you accepted jesus christ as your savior and god began a work in your life to begin to mold you into his very image but then when you received the holy spirit what did you do that's when god and man became one in you that's when god so became in your body and he began to dwell in you then all of a sudden now just as jesus christ when the holy spirit came upon him in the river of jordan when you receive the holy spirit it's the same thing god and man is uniting together in you and from that point on then jesus was tempted in the wilderness but he and he came back but he always had to learn how to submit to the will of the father that dwelt in him brother branham somebody asked when god this was a trinitarian he said i used to pray for the father or whatever like that he says whom do i pray for now he says pray for the god that dwells in you have you ever tried to get away from yourself very difficult because everywhere you go you go right well if god dwells in you then wherever you go he goes with you so you can never get away from god any more than you can get away from yourself yeah if you sin all of a sudden brother ram says yeah then god goes off in the holy spirit he sits on a tree until you repent and stuff but basically you have to come to the understanding god is no further away from you than you are from yourself i mean i listened to somebody that they were having a class on how to pray i figured boy you're making it complicated i'm sitting driving my car and all of a sudden lord i have a need or somebody comes into mind well lord this person has a need lord would you manifest would you go and heal them or would you deal with them or would you help them and i just talked to him sure he's my father and i respect him in that position but still he's i mean he's my loving father here i'm his son so i just talked to him i talked to him like i talked to every to anybody anyway so it says it says it we're coming to a conclusion of the process we are coming to the place when god wants to so live in us until it's no longer us in revelation 10 7 but in days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophet the mystery of god is christ dwelling in you that is the mystery in paul's day that was something for the for god to dwell in gentiles for god to dwell in people that were non-jewish for god to sit there and take people there were infidels and worshiping of idols and all of a sudden for god himself to go and humble himself enough to dwell in in sinful flesh ah this um this this was more than the people that they could understand but here but this is what the mystery is god's coming and dwelling within you because see it it takes it comes to the place where because in revelation 10 it goes on to down 8 through 11. and the voice which i heard from heaven spaking to me and said and go take the little book which is open so so that the seals have been opened at this point and the hand of the angel would standeth upon the seeing upon the earth so you don't go to the prophets you go to christ brother branham was not christ he was the prophet to this age god revealed things to the bride through him but he's not jesus christ he's not to be worshipped anyway and i went into the angel and told him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in their mouth sweetest honey i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it and it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nations tongues and kings this is after the messenger this is after the prophet we have a ministry we are to perform but it says john take the book take the book and eat it because you and the book have to become the same i think as god spoke to ezekiel ezekiel here's the scroll eat it he looked and says oh no he says everything in there is bad news for everybody and god says eat it because that is what you are going to tell everyone we eat this book we become one with the word and we begin to live that word and then we begin to prophesy we begin to tell others about the grace and the mercy of god until finally we're taken off the face of this earth brother brown says when the methodist failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until on this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age he said yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it's its own mouth so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her not just the prophet in her yes sir for it says in the last days of revelations uh 17 the spirit and the bride say come this is where we are this is what god is trying to get us to understand we know that through the ministry of the prophet brother branham says he says god the the the wave sheath which was jesus christ was was waved over the people on pentecost but then in brother adam's ministry that same wave sheet which was jesus christ was waved over the bride the wave ceased is the first one that came to perfection the first one that came to maturity and so as it was waived over the day on pentecost that's what it's showing that he jesus christ when he rose from the dead he was the first one that actually showed he was a mature son of god he was the first one to come into completion but now he's waved over over the bride in this day what to see what it was trying to show he says as jesus christ was waved over over in pentecost he says now it's been waved over us what showing that the full word has been restored to us he's trying to tell us who we are he's trying to let us know that all the power that was in god now dwells within the church he's trying to tell us you're the very righteousness of god himself he's trying to show us that you have power over satan you have the right to sit there command satan to leave that power rests within you when jesus christ sent out the disciples two by two he says go into the cities and the villages is round about he says raise heal the sick raise the dead cast out demons i've freely given you the authority freely use it that has never been rescinded that still dwells in us that's still part of what we have the right to do by virtue of who we are as as the bride of jesus christ in uh [Music] it's the rising of the sun as we waved again we realized in the last days according to luke 17 30 in the sun of in in the sun day again in the day when the sun of man will be revealed or waved again over the people he says in the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that the word again is waved over the people that the dead that the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us and is giving us life the bride is in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church there have to be a sheave waved over again in the last day and that's what happened in our generation in the bomb in gilead brother browner makes a statement he says the one thing we have to move up to now is supreme faith to what we've had something that you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you're doing when you understand like you you walk out and say well i'm going home i'm going out to start the car he said that's all an act of faith tomorrow i will meet you at a certain place it's all an act of faith because you've just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you well that's the way that well that's the way the things of god are after you have trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes like a regular routine and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord so the raps will be just going right on that way it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plan of god i did a study on havoc a couple years ago and that changed my whole concept of what it is to have faith faith is not believing for something it's believing in someone abraham had to believe that the god that had given him the promise had the ability to perform and bring that promise to pass he made a promise that that isaac he said all the promises to abraham rested in isaac so abraham when god told him i want you to take isaac i want you to take him up to the mountain i want you to kill him and reduce him to ashes abraham and said unto his servants he says mind my son we're going to go to the mountain and i and my son we're going to return he believed that even though his son was reduced to ashes god would raise him up because all of the promises of god to abraham rested in isaac he had to believe in god it didn't matter the circumstances didn't matter the conditions no he hadn't believed that god was in such control that god could do what god had promised that he would do god says he heals do you believe do you believe that he has the ability to fulfill his word if you have the ability to believe that that god that you serve that you worship that you adore if you can believe that that god has the ability to do what his what he's promised in his word then all you have to do is begin to claim that promise and then thank him for the for the manifestation of the fulfillment of that word we had i remember we were in one youth camp a while back and there was this young sister and she was there crying out and crying out and crying out and finally the minister which was there he went over to the sister and he says well sister he says what do you need from god and so she told him he said well sister instead of continually asking and begging he says start thanking him jesus says well okay and so she began to thank god for the fulfillment of a promise a little while later she was running the aisles because she was shouting she says god has answered my prayer god has taken care of the situation that i had in my life it was it's not we don't we are god's children we do not have to beg we are not beggars we go to our father and says father i have a need. okay we tell them what the need is well lord thank you for fear thank you for taking care of that need it may not be today may not be tomorrow but thank you god for fulfilling that promise when god appeared in in habakkuk i did this study in havacook god had taken habakkuk and he had showed him the condition of his world the priests were a bunch of hypocrites the economy wasn't wasn't was on the rocks everybody else was just doing their own thing and then nobody was worshiping god in sincerity and in truth and havoc told god he said why don't you judge these people because his righteous indignation rose up and god says yeah i think it's a good idea i'm paraphrasing obviously he said i'll send the chaldeans in oh no no no god that's not a good idea because they're not nice people they kill because they like killing when they come into this city they will kill anybody and everybody and so havoc all of a sudden had to wrestle with this and then havoc 2 and 4 it says behold his soul which is lifted up as not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith the soul which is lifted up the man who thinks he can do it on his own you think you can handle what's coming destruction is heading our way this nation is on is this nation's is in this nation is shot brother branham says god's going to send god you know he says god russia is going to send atomic bombs and blow up this place he said last thing he saw in the vision was america with nothing but a bunch of craters but we're going through economic problems right now we're going through all kinds of issues god was telling habakkuk he says he says you have to trust me you do not have the ability to handle what's coming so you will have to believe me that i will take care of you and to me this changed my whole concept it isn't i have to believe for something but i have to believe that the god that has called me the god that has directed my life the god that has supplied my needs i have to believe that he will continue to provide and he will continue to supply when we get sick i have to believe that he will heal me because that's his promise to me but it comes to the place where i have to totally rely upon him it's no longer me relying upon myself it's no longer me relying upon the things that i have ability to do it's no longer me relying upon what i think i can or can't can't do no it's learning to take my hand and put it in his hand and say lord i'm putting my hand in your hand don't let go because i need you to lead and guide me today and have a cook have to wrestle with this but then habakkuk 3 16 starting there he said when i heard my belly trembled my lips quivered at the voice rottenness entered into my bones and i trembled in myself that i might rest in the day of trouble when he when he cometh upon cometh up unto the people and he will invade them with his troops he was scared what was coming to his nation he was scared because judgment was coming he was scared because he knew that there was going to be an invasion of a foreign army and he knew when they came into that city he was afraid for his own life so he had to come to the place where he was going to take total reliance upon him upon god and but con god alone but then it goes on in verse 17 it says though the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall there be fruit in the vines and the labor of the allah shall fail and the fields shall yield no made in the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls though there be nothing though he be reduced to absolutely nothing though there'd be no food in the land there would be no cattle no there would be nothing to buy there would be nothing to eat there would be absolutely nothing though everything he had be taken from him he goes that yet i will rejoice in the lord i will joy in the god of my salvation that verse is the strongest way that you could possibly put it in the hebrew language i will shout i will dance i will jump i will go into his presence with singing i will i will rejoice with him even though i even though i have absolutely nothing that will not change my my my desire to worship my god if he takes everything from me he says i will still worship god with my whole heart i will worship him as if i possessed everything and to me that's what brother brown when he talks about you know you have to have faith you have to have trust and that's the way he said the bride will be at the last day we cannot comprehend what's coming when california sinks as a result of an earthquake there will be a tidal wave that will go around the world and hundreds of millions of people will die in 20 24 to 48 hours our economy will go belly up there will be nothing at that point in time will you still come to church will you still worship god as if you possessed everything or do you worship god because it's comfortable i think one place in the scriptures that says if you can't serve god in the good times how are you going to serve him in the bad times if you can't run with a man what are you going to do and you have to run with the horses so it takes a commitment within ourselves what do we think about god is is god out of the center focus of our life is god the very one that we worship is god the very one that we have a desire for is our whole focus of our life focused upon jesus christ and him and him alone if we be reduced to nothing we still come and worship will it change our relationship with our father or begin to realize he is sovereign he knows what he's doing and all he's asking is for us to have the faith in him if the musicians want to come i'm closing this in philippians 3 12 to 14. paul writing not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after that i might apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of of jesus christ jesus paul was running a race he was in a struggle he says i haven't attained what god has called me to to become he says no he said he says he says but but i follow after i pursue something and i pursue something with all of my energy i pursue something with my whole heart he said brethren i count on myself to have have apprehended with this one thing i do forgetting with those things which are behind and i reach forth under the things which are before me i press towards a mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus and that's where we're at our economy is shot the world stage is getting to the place they're predicting a famine there's earthquakes everywhere volcanoes are erupting where they haven't been for quite a long while we have wars going with russia going into the ukraine they said that's going to devastate the world economy because of what of the different things it's going to make the price of our food go up it's going to make the price of our fuel go up it's going to make it so really we we're gonna there's a struggle ahead but during that struggle if your focus is jesus christ if your focus is having the relationship with god who is your father if you're having enough faith to believe that the god that has provided for you and healed you and taken care of you all of these years if you actually can come to the grasp of the fact and believe in that god to the place of no matter what happens tomorrow you will still worship that god you will still believe in that god and you'll have faith in that god to take care of you and supply your needs this is what habakkuk had to come to in his generation and i honestly believe this is what we're going to have to come to in this generation let's just pray heavenly father much has been said this morning and lord i have tried to express it from my heart and believe lord it was your words because lord i could tell you that they could say what the prophet said but lord i honestly believe that we are in the last days and there's going to come upon this nation something which we don't which we have no comprehension of but lord we are your bride in elijah's day you reserved seven thousand which had never bowed the need of baal you kept them and lord you have you have a bride you said the bride of today will not fall because you have preserved her you have followed her you have predestinated her we believe we are part of that bride lord and so lord now take what has been spoken and lord let it become a revelation to us in our hearts that lord of the things which are coming upon us we won't waver we won't fail but lord our focus will always be on you we sang this song turn your eyes upon jesus and all the things of the world will fade away and lord that's where our focus needs to be we need to look at you in such a way lord that the world and the things of the world mean nothing to us the lord you become our bridegroom and lord we are we just want to worship you we want to adore you we want to have an intimate relationship with you so grant that lord to me and to the people in front in front of me lord and lord be help us to have the revelation of who we are and what we are in you i ask it in jesus precious name amen my
