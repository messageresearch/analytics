TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is such a simple statement be it unto me according to your word but it's not simple friends by saying that she's acknowledging that i believe you that i was in the back part of god's mind when he was having isaiah give a prophecy he was thinking of me that being unto me was loaded with meaning friends she was receiving the revelation of her hour and she was receiving the revelation of herself in that hour she was receiving the revelation of her position in god in that hour and when she said being unto me she was saying i believe what you tell me that i believe that i'm the virgin that isaiah spoke of that god thought of before the foundation of the world when there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world that you were going to bring it through a virgin because you knew there was going to be a fall you see this beat unto me is loaded with meaning had to accept it she had to receive it and then she let she let that word flow through her she could not produce it she could not manufacture it she could not copy it what could she do there was nothing she could do well what have we heard in this hour there's been a messenger there's been a seventh angel messenger that come and give us a revelation of the word to be performed in this hour but that messenger was unlocking the mystery in us and placing us in that mystery placing us as the vessels the word would come through amen and and you can we can look at this and you can see the wave sheath and say there's no way i can do that i can tell you god's not asking you to do that god's not asking you to do anything amen that's what sometimes becomes so discouraging people they they look at brother branham's life and they look at the maturity he came to and the character he had and the manifestation say i could never do that i i would venture to say he never did that that's what he told us he said i'm not the one who does this i'm not the one who did this i was only standing by when he did those things he wasn't looking for somebody who could perform to the task mary never could perform to the task he's looking for somebody who will say i believe that's the truth and i yield myself to that truth and be it unto me according to your words now can we listen to the prophet and can calling out a bride and listen we can look at the prophet calling out a bride as a story we can look at it as a mark in time that he's calling on a bride but we need to take the message personally he's calling me bride
