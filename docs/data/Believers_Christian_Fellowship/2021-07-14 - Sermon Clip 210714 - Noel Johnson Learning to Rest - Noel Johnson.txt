========================================

you are called as christians but you're also called to be the bride of jesus christ you were born a human being but now you're called to be sons and daughters of god it takes a huge change in our thinking oh yeah i'm just a sinner saved by grace in fact that's what bothered me when i was in the bath in in in the denominational system oh yeah you're a sinner saved by grace the emphasis was on i was a sinner i was always going to be a sinner i was always going to have mistakes i was always going to have problems i'm always going to trying to overcome but in this message i find that no i'm a son of god that has been fully restored to my rightful position with god but still it takes a huge chance for information in my thinking do i am i acting as a sinner side by grace or now am i able to act as a son of god am i able to actually get into the channel where god can speak through me and do the things through me that he's wanting to do because see that's what we are called to be we are at the end time the end time is no longer future we are there but see we have to begin we have to step into the office of being the bride of jesus christ we have to step into the office of being sons and daughters of god we have to be able to sit there and begin to realize this is what i am the bible says now are you the sons of god does not appear what you shall be but but when you shall see him you should just be him like he is that's now but you have to believe it [Applause] you have to believe this that's why god sent the prophet that one one minister i think anyway they they made mention of the fact you know during the church ages he was dealing with both vines when he gets to the to the last church age the lady is seeing church age no he was just dealing with a false one it took a prophet to this generation to tell the bride no you are not lukewarm no you are not reaching increasingly no what you are you are the son of god you are the pure pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ you are sinless in his sight and sometimes i wrestle with that one even but it has to it comes to the place in our thinking we have to be willing to step into that we have to be willing to get out of ourselves and quit relying upon ages and good relying upon our own thoughts and our own processes and our own intellect if you will and begin to come to come to grips with the fact no we are sons and daughters of god we have the authority of god because of who we represent
