[5:11] it's in this place because his presence
[5:13] remains with us amen
[5:14] let's all stand and let's go to the word
[5:24] all right let's go to saint john the
[5:26] gospel of john chapter one
[5:29] and we'll start there i'd like to i'd
[5:31] like to preach in the way of a christmas
[5:33] message
[5:34] and it's interesting brother branham
[5:36] every year preached a christmas message
[5:38] and he'll preach an easter message and a
[5:39] thanksgiving message but it's all the
[5:41] same thing he just preached the message
[5:43] amen
[5:44] whatever label it had or whatever time
[5:46] of year it was he still preached the
[5:47] message of the hour
[5:48] amen and we very much want to do the
[5:50] same thing so let's go
[5:52] to john chapter 1 verse 1.
[5:56] in the beginning was the word and the
[5:58] word was with god and the word was
[6:00] god the same was in the beginning with
[6:02] god
[6:03] all things were made by him and without
[6:05] him was not anything made that was made
[6:08] in him was life and the life was the
[6:10] light of men
[6:11] and the light shineth in darkness and
[6:13] the darkness comprehended it not
[6:16] let's jump over to verse 14 and the word
[6:19] was made flesh
[6:20] and dwelt among us and we behold his
[6:22] glory the glory is the only begotten of
[6:24] the father
[6:25] full of grace and truth let's turn from
[6:28] there over to luke chapter 2.
[6:38] luke chapter 2
[6:41] and we'll begin reading from verse 1.
[6:46] luke chapter 2 and verse 1. and it came
[6:48] to pass in those days
[6:50] that there went out a decree from caesar
[6:52] augustus that all the world should be
[6:53] taxed
[6:54] and this taxing was first made when
[6:56] cyrenius was governor of syria
[6:58] and all went to be taxed everyone in his
[7:00] own city and joseph also went up from
[7:02] galilee
[7:03] out of the city of nazareth unto judea
[7:06] unto the city of david which is called
[7:08] bethlehem
[7:09] because he was of the house and lineage
[7:10] of david to be taxed with mary his
[7:13] espoused wife being great with child
[7:16] and so it was that while they were there
[7:18] while they were there the days were
[7:20] accomplished that she should be
[7:21] delivered
[7:22] and she brought forth her firstborn son
[7:24] and wrapped him in swaddling claws
[7:26] and laid him in a manger because there
[7:28] was no room for them
[7:30] in the end man let's just bow our heads
[7:32] and pray
[7:33] lord jesus we thank you father for this
[7:35] opportunity to be together
[7:37] lord we thank you god as we open this
[7:39] book lord that
[7:40] it would be more than just the literacy
[7:43] of humanity being able to open a book
[7:45] and read it
[7:46] but god we pray you would open it to us
[7:48] lord open it to our understanding by
[7:51] revelation that we might have spiritual
[7:53] discernment
[7:54] of what your word is speaking to us for
[7:56] this hour that we live in now
[7:58] we answer you bless us lord that you
[7:59] would speak through these lips that you
[8:01] would have your way with us
[8:02] in jesus christ's name amen you can all
[8:05] be seated
[8:07] and then as we come into the christmas
[8:10] season it's a
[8:11] strange this has been a strange year and
[8:13] everything remains strange
[8:14] and and but i just pray that the lord
[8:17] will bless you and you
[8:18] have a good time with your families and
[8:20] take the time to just
[8:22] connect with your family and just
[8:23] consider it a blessing
[8:25] you know so many people this year
[8:28] strange we can't get together like we
[8:29] would some
[8:30] can some are not able i mean you have
[8:32] grandparents who are stuck in nursing
[8:34] homes who can't get a visit
[8:36] from anybody in their family so there's
[8:38] a lot of loneliness a lot of things that
[8:39] have changed
[8:41] but also in some ways it has taken
[8:44] christmas and made it a lot simpler
[8:47] taking away some of the running around
[8:49] and carrying on and brought it back to
[8:50] just a family at home
[8:52] and if we take advantage of that just
[8:54] our families at home and remember
[8:55] brother brennan said christmas should be
[8:57] the greatest day of worship of all the
[8:58] year
[8:59] and so don't forget if god has slowed us
[9:02] down and simplified things and made it
[9:04] the way we're not traveling or we're not
[9:06] gathering
[9:06] like we used to in years past let's
[9:09] still make it a day of worship amen
[9:11] and let's not waste the opportunity god
[9:13] gave us and let's not forget those who
[9:16] maybe are stuck in a nursing home and
[9:18] we'll get no visit no family no
[9:20] no nothing let's just remember them in
[9:22] prayer especially our brothers and
[9:24] sisters and
[9:25] and those that are related to them it's
[9:27] not an easy time
[9:29] but it's a good time the flesh may not
[9:32] like everything that's happening the
[9:33] flesh may not like
[9:35] all of the uh the changing environment
[9:38] changing situations the uncertainty in
[9:40] many things
[9:41] amen but but god is so good he's in
[9:43] control of everything
[9:45] because when we look here at luke
[9:46] chapter 2 the whole world went into a
[9:49] taxation
[9:50] there was a law and that law had brought
[9:53] about
[9:53] a a requirement especially
[9:57] as we see in in israel and judea there
[9:59] was a requirement
[10:00] that individuals would go back to their
[10:03] the city that they were born in or their
[10:04] city of their heritage at least
[10:06] to be counted and to be taxed and and no
[10:09] doubt that that was
[10:10] turmoil that created a lot of hardship
[10:13] and a lot of difficulty
[10:14] if you think just about mary and joseph
[10:17] mary
[10:18] was great with child and i would say it
[10:20] wasn't a convenient time for her to take
[10:22] a trip
[10:24] we know that while she was there for the
[10:26] taxation
[10:27] her days were accomplished and she
[10:28] delivered and we know traveling down she
[10:30] was great with child
[10:32] and we've talked about this before but
[10:34] if we put ourselves in the environment
[10:35] in that day
[10:36] amen they were they were under foreign
[10:39] rule they were under roman rule they
[10:41] they didn't have
[10:41] their liberty they didn't have their
[10:43] freedom as the jewish nation as they'd
[10:45] want to have and
[10:46] they were crying out for a deliverer and
[10:48] and deliverance
[10:50] but here they have a new law that
[10:52] requires everybody move about and travel
[10:54] back to
[10:55] a place of heritage for a taxation and
[10:58] i'm sure there was a lot of complaining
[11:02] can you imagine can you imagine if that
[11:03] happened now
[11:06] okay i i there was probably a lot of
[11:08] complaining a lot of disruption to
[11:10] people's lives disruption to plans
[11:13] disruption to who knows what was
[11:14] disrupted what kind of hardship that
[11:17] created
[11:17] but nonetheless they were subject to
[11:19] that and mary and joseph couldn't
[11:21] circumvent that because of where they
[11:23] were they were subject to those things
[11:24] and they began to travel amen in the
[11:26] very thing that was the difficulty the
[11:28] very thing that was troublesome or
[11:31] or difficult or inconvenient was moving
[11:33] them right according to prophecy
[11:37] because the government is not going to
[11:39] move outside of god's word of prophecy
[11:42] god's prophecy is going to orchestrate
[11:44] everything that's happening in the
[11:46] government
[11:48] i mean even if you think about if you
[11:50] think about the environment in europe
[11:53] amen in the late 30s that would create
[11:56] uh hitler's regime and and start world
[11:59] war
[11:59] ii and all the chaos and all the turmoil
[12:02] and all the laws and all the governments
[12:04] and the uprisings and the changes
[12:06] and everything that was happening in
[12:08] that time period
[12:09] and we look at that and we say oh that's
[12:11] a terrible thing a terrible time
[12:14] but the prophet of god would look at
[12:16] that time and he would call it the
[12:17] tender hand of jehovah
[12:19] moving israel back into the homeland so
[12:22] that they can receive their messiah
[12:24] and so the things that are happening in
[12:27] 2020 and the things that may happen on
[12:29] in 2021
[12:30] amen nothing is going to move outside
[12:32] plans of prophecy
[12:33] his cogs are turning right on time amen
[12:36] and we need to
[12:37] we need to check ourselves some time and
[12:40] stop the complaining
[12:43] i wince when i say that because i'm
[12:44] talking to myself amen
[12:47] stop the complaining and understand that
[12:49] whatever is happening is happening for
[12:50] our benefit whatever is happening is
[12:52] happening for the word of god saying
[12:54] for the prophecy's sake and this thing's
[12:56] marching forward and there's nothing
[12:58] different this christmas than was the
[13:00] christmas jesus was born
[13:02] amen we know he wasn't born december
[13:04] 25th we know he's born in the spring
[13:06] because he's a lamb i'm just talking the
[13:07] world is celebrating the world is
[13:09] talking about it and brother branham
[13:10] says we're not going to ignore and act
[13:11] like it's not happening
[13:14] so so we know that he was born in the
[13:15] spring but that spring that he was born
[13:17] it's no different than this last spring
[13:19] it'll be no different than the next
[13:20] spring if there is a spring
[13:21] amen the same things that were happening
[13:23] there are happening again
[13:26] we're in the same environment we're in
[13:28] this in the same circumstances
[13:29] it's the same spirits it's the same
[13:32] cycle of prophecy that's moving
[13:34] forward in a revolving history and we
[13:36] find her that's how we can so easily
[13:38] find ourselves in the bible
[13:40] because this prophecy this word of
[13:42] prophecy is
[13:43] moving forward in a cycle of natural and
[13:46] spiritual types and it's moving forward
[13:48] in a revolving history
[13:49] and we find ourselves back in the same
[13:51] places that they found themselves in the
[13:53] word of god
[13:54] fighting the same spirits in many of the
[13:56] same circumstances
[13:58] so praise god it's not a it's not a book
[14:00] of history
[14:01] it's not a book that's only pointing to
[14:03] the future but it's a book that's
[14:04] explaining to us
[14:06] what's happening in our lives now so we
[14:09] know that they had to go back to
[14:10] bethlehem
[14:11] they had to go to the because it was the
[14:13] city of david and they were of the
[14:15] lineage of david
[14:16] and so they had to go to bethlehem and
[14:18] brother branham i'm referencing two
[14:21] main sermons uh today and referencing
[14:24] why little bethlehem and why it had to
[14:26] be shepherds
[14:27] and this would be a good season to go
[14:29] back and listen to as many of you
[14:30] probably already have
[14:31] but as the as the days move forward and
[14:33] we go into the weekend
[14:35] it would be good to listen to uh why
[14:37] little bethlehem
[14:38] and why it had to be shepherds and and
[14:40] because brother branham starts to
[14:42] break down some things and explain even
[14:44] what's going on in our day
[14:46] and we find out bethlehem means the
[14:49] house of god's bread
[14:51] the house of god's bread where else
[14:54] could jesus christ be born but in the
[14:56] house of god's bread
[14:58] and he was of the lineage of david
[15:00] joseph was and mary was
[15:02] also they were both of the lineage of
[15:03] david they were both come from david
[15:05] amen and he had to go back he had to go
[15:08] back because the prophecy
[15:09] said that out of bethlehem of judea
[15:13] would come a governor that would rule
[15:15] the people
[15:15] amen in bethlehem would be the least of
[15:18] the cities
[15:19] of judah amen because god is always
[15:21] working through humility he's not going
[15:23] to the greatest he's going to the least
[15:25] and he's coming from there but bethlehem
[15:27] has a rich history
[15:29] that has everything to do with you and i
[15:31] and brother brown explains this
[15:33] thoroughly and why
[15:34] it had and why little bethlehem
[15:37] but all the way back when israel was
[15:40] crossing into the promised land
[15:42] they would come to a city called jericho
[15:45] and in jericho there'd be a woman who
[15:46] would
[15:47] who would believe the word of god and in
[15:49] believing she would receive a token
[15:51] and that token would save her household
[15:53] and that would that woman would be known
[15:54] as the
[15:55] harlot rahab a canaanite
[15:58] gentile woman but but she would be
[16:01] married eventually after
[16:03] jericho collapsed and after they moved
[16:05] forward into the promised land
[16:06] she would be married to a prince of
[16:09] judah
[16:10] she'd be married to the prince of the
[16:12] house of judah and that prince would be
[16:14] salmone
[16:14] and she would become the wife of salmon
[16:17] and brother benham said
[16:18] rahab and salmon would go to bethlehem
[16:21] and they were the ones who established
[16:23] bethlehem
[16:24] so what was the establishing of
[16:25] bethlehem where did bethlehem come from
[16:27] bethlehem was established by a gentile
[16:30] woman
[16:31] married to a prince of judah so this is
[16:34] how important this city
[16:36] is god was looking after bethlehem all
[16:39] the way back
[16:40] amen when he would take the harlot rahab
[16:42] amen and he would
[16:43] and he would redeem her under a token
[16:46] and save her under a token
[16:47] her and her household she would be
[16:49] united with a prince of the house of
[16:51] judah which is typing christ taking a
[16:53] gentile bride
[16:55] and they too in their union would move
[16:57] forward and establish themselves
[16:59] in bethlehem so bethlehem was founded
[17:02] was founded by a christ type a prince of
[17:05] the house of judah
[17:06] marrying a gentile who was called a
[17:10] harlot
[17:12] can you see yourself in the bible this
[17:15] is where bethlehem comes from
[17:17] that's why david had to come out of
[17:19] bethlehem that's why the son of david
[17:21] has to be born in bethlehem
[17:23] that's why bethlehem has the name of the
[17:25] house of god's bread
[17:26] amen it has everything to do with the
[17:29] story of christ and his bride
[17:33] so now bethlehem come from rahab
[17:38] rahab was married to salman they
[17:40] established bethlehem
[17:42] and they had a son and that son's name
[17:44] was boaz
[17:46] and boaz becomes the type of the kinsmen
[17:48] redeemer a type of christ
[17:50] and when it's come time for boaz to
[17:52] marry who else would he marry in
[17:54] bethlehem
[17:55] but ruth the moabitess another gentile
[17:59] woman
[18:00] marries a christ type the kinsmen
[18:02] redeemer
[18:03] wear in bethlehem in the house of god's
[18:07] bread
[18:07] amen would be a union between a gentile
[18:10] woman
[18:10] and a christ type in bethlehem
[18:14] in the out of their union would come
[18:16] obed and from their union would produce
[18:19] a seed would reduce a sun
[18:21] that would be the redemption of naomi
[18:23] would be the redemption of israel
[18:25] so the union between the gentile and the
[18:28] christ type
[18:29] will produce a seed will produce a son
[18:32] that will be redemption for israel it's
[18:34] the same thing that's happening in our
[18:36] day
[18:37] through the union of a bride amen with
[18:39] christ will produce
[18:40] the son of man again that will be a
[18:42] redemption for the 144 thousand
[18:45] all of this is laying in bethlehem so
[18:49] you know i i so appreciate amen the way
[18:52] our children are able to be raised
[18:54] because when i grew up i didn't know
[18:56] anything about the bible story we would
[18:58] read luke chapter 2 but
[18:59] you read it until it's just words amen
[19:01] and the words have no meaning it's a
[19:03] historical thing
[19:04] and everybody knows i mean you start
[19:06] reading it as soon as you start
[19:08] luke chapter 2 and it came in in the
[19:11] past in those days that there went out a
[19:13] decree from caesar and and much of the
[19:16] world especially the christian world
[19:17] can begin to recite it from there or at
[19:20] least follow along closely enough to
[19:21] inject a few words
[19:24] but there's so much meaning here that
[19:27] has to do with the message of the hour
[19:30] and the message they are unlocked and it
[19:31] takes it away from a fable
[19:33] or a story or a historical happening
[19:36] amen and we begin to see
[19:38] why little bethlehem because the bride
[19:41] is there established bethlehem was
[19:43] established
[19:44] by a gentile woman and a prince of judah
[19:48] redemption amen the redemption for naomi
[19:51] which
[19:52] is a type of the old church or the type
[19:53] of israel redemption for naomi
[19:56] amen was laid down the type of it the
[19:58] shadow was laid down in the book of ruth
[20:00] the redemption for israel was shown
[20:03] in bethlehem
[20:06] praise be to god i so thank god for the
[20:09] word of the hour
[20:10] that our children know the truth in
[20:12] christmas
[20:14] they don't know anything about a santa
[20:16] claus amen they know it's not real
[20:19] they know it's a fable they know it's a
[20:20] story they know it's a makeup
[20:22] amen they know it it's something it's a
[20:24] distraction it's a diversion it's a
[20:26] celebration of the world
[20:27] amen but the truth of christmas has
[20:30] everything to do with you and i and
[20:31] where we're at here right now
[20:33] there's a christmas taking place today
[20:38] we don't want to talk about the
[20:39] christmas of 2000 years ago and look
[20:41] back at how wonderful that is
[20:42] that was amazing amen where are the
[20:44] presents
[20:47] but i'll tell you the present is here
[20:49] the gift of god is here
[20:51] christmas is here there's a christmas
[20:53] today tomorrow
[20:54] every day the 25th the 26th to 27th
[20:58] january february march april it's
[21:00] christmas
[21:03] where's christmas christmas is in me
[21:05] christmas is all around me
[21:07] i'm part of christmas
[21:11] amen let's read verse 7 again
[21:16] verse 6. we'll start at 6 and continue
[21:17] on and so it was that while they were
[21:19] there the days were accomplished that
[21:21] she should be delivered
[21:22] and she brought forth her first born son
[21:24] and wrapped him in swaddling claws and
[21:26] laid him in a manger
[21:27] because there was no room for them in
[21:29] the end huh
[21:31] imagine that you know joseph
[21:34] is journeying down he's got a wife
[21:36] that's great with child
[21:38] and that child is of the holy ghost the
[21:40] lord told him in a dream to take her and
[21:42] now you know all this taxation and all
[21:45] this trouble and all this traveling down
[21:47] and
[21:47] everybody's moving about and now there's
[21:49] no room in the end
[21:50] and we've got to go uh now to a stable
[21:53] because there's no room in the end
[21:54] we all know the story so well but if we
[21:57] could just place ourselves in that day
[21:59] he knows his wife is so close to
[22:02] delivering she's so uncomfortable maybe
[22:04] in a great deal of pain
[22:05] he's trying to find a place to go and
[22:08] god already has a provided place
[22:10] but god's provided place isn't the first
[22:13] place you want to go
[22:15] i don't believe it was the first place
[22:17] joseph wanted to go because the
[22:19] scripture says there was no room at the
[22:20] end
[22:21] how did they know there was no room in
[22:22] the end if they didn't check at the end
[22:25] so his first choice wasn't the stable
[22:30] we understand that this wasn't joseph's
[22:32] first choice but this had been god's
[22:34] choice be from before the foundation of
[22:36] the world
[22:37] and listen friends we we are in the
[22:40] christmas now
[22:41] amen it's in us it's all around us
[22:43] christ is being delivered amen through
[22:45] his bride
[22:47] and there's already a predestinated plan
[22:50] god already knows what's going to happen
[22:52] but sometimes he doesn't give us our
[22:54] first choice or second choice or third
[22:56] choice but he moves us to a place
[22:57] we wouldn't even go ourselves because
[22:59] it's perfect for the prophecy
[23:01] because what was coming forth was the
[23:03] lamb of god and the lamb of god
[23:05] couldn't be born in that end the lamb of
[23:07] god had to be born where lambs are born
[23:11] had to be born in the stable because god
[23:14] is orchestrating this whole thing
[23:16] so that we could look back and say
[23:18] that's why
[23:19] that's why that's why it was prophecy
[23:22] being fulfilled
[23:25] verse 8 and they were in the same
[23:27] country shepherds abiding in the field
[23:29] keeping watch over their flock by night
[23:32] and lo the angel of the lord came upon
[23:34] them and the glory of the lord shone
[23:35] around about them
[23:37] and they were afraid and the angel said
[23:39] unto them fear not for behold i bring
[23:41] you good tidings of great joy
[23:43] which shall be to all people for unto
[23:46] you is born this day in the city of
[23:48] david a savior which is christ the lord
[23:51] and this shall be a sign unto you you
[23:53] shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling
[23:55] claws laying in a manger
[23:57] and suddenly there was with the angel a
[23:59] multitude of the heavenly host praising
[24:01] god and saying
[24:02] glory to god in the highest and on earth
[24:04] peace good will towards men
[24:06] and it came to pass as the angels were
[24:08] gone away
[24:10] were gone from them unto heaven the
[24:12] shepherd said one to another
[24:14] let us now go even into bethlehem and
[24:16] see this thing which has come to pass
[24:18] which the lord hath made known unto us
[24:21] and they came with haste and found mary
[24:23] and joseph and the babe
[24:24] lying in a manger and when they had seen
[24:26] it they made known abroad the saying
[24:28] which was told them concerning this
[24:30] child
[24:31] and all they that heard it wandered at
[24:33] those things which were told them by the
[24:34] shepherds
[24:35] and mary kept all these things and
[24:37] pondered them in her heart
[24:39] and the shepherds returned glorifying
[24:41] and praising god for all the things that
[24:43] they had heard
[24:44] and seen as it was told unto them
[24:47] and the message why it had to be
[24:49] shepherds brother branham begins to
[24:51] explain
[24:51] amen why would god call shepherds why
[24:55] would shepherds get an
[24:56] angelic visitation and why would the
[24:59] shepherds be
[25:00] the first ones on earth to know that
[25:02] christ the savior is born in the city of
[25:04] david
[25:05] because brother branham said shepherds
[25:07] always attend the birth
[25:08] of lambs who would be more fitting
[25:11] amen when the lamb of god was going to
[25:13] be born but to tell the shepherds and
[25:15] the shepherds
[25:16] were the ones who would always be the
[25:18] first people to know when a lamb was
[25:20] born
[25:21] and nothing's going to change on this
[25:22] day amen because the lamb of god is
[25:25] being born in a stable
[25:26] in the house of god's bread according to
[25:28] prophecy
[25:29] and there's some shepherds who are going
[25:30] to be the ones who are the first
[25:32] witnesses to testify
[25:33] that a lamb is born and gone
[25:37] and called shepherds he said because he
[25:39] didn't call the educated you didn't need
[25:41] any education
[25:42] to be a shepherd amen the brother
[25:43] baptist said they were more likely than
[25:45] not illiterate amen but
[25:46] but god would choose amen shepherds
[25:49] because shepherds had the right
[25:50] characteristics he was looking for amen
[25:53] to be the first people on earth to
[25:54] declare
[25:55] that the savior is here that the lamb is
[25:58] here
[26:00] amen because the way that god had to
[26:02] bring his lamb
[26:03] he had to bring him in humility amen he
[26:06] had to bring him in a stable
[26:08] he had to lay him in the manger he meant
[26:10] and these are things that the
[26:11] theologians couldn't understand
[26:13] these were things that the aristocrats
[26:15] could not comprehend they could not
[26:17] accept
[26:18] but these were not things that were
[26:19] foreign to shepherds
[26:21] shepherds were accustomed to the stable
[26:23] to the sights and sounds and smells
[26:27] brother brahma said some of them
[26:28] clergymen they'd have to run in there
[26:30] and put a clothespin on their nose
[26:34] but god would call shepherds because of
[26:35] their humility because of their
[26:37] familiarity with lambs
[26:39] because of their understanding of the
[26:41] humility by which christ had to be born
[26:43] god called the humble god called the
[26:45] lowly because the lowly and the humble
[26:47] would be able to understand
[26:50] and they would have no conflict no
[26:52] problem amen
[26:53] seeing what was seen and believing and
[26:55] accepting it just the way
[26:57] god sent it they wouldn't need it in a
[26:59] nicer package they wouldn't need it in a
[27:01] better way
[27:02] they were perfectly comfortable with the
[27:04] way god would send his word
[27:07] and i'm telling you there's still
[27:08] shepherds on earth today
[27:10] that are perfectly comfortable with the
[27:12] way god has chosen to send his word in
[27:14] this age
[27:15] they're not looking for a better a
[27:17] better location they're not looking for
[27:18] a better place amen they're fine with a
[27:21] stable they're fine with a manger
[27:23] they're fine with swaddling cloths
[27:24] taken off the yoke of an ox why because
[27:28] they're simple they're humble
[27:29] amen they have nothing to prove they
[27:31] have no reputation to save
[27:32] amen they just see they hear they see
[27:36] they believe they testify
[27:40] praise god brother branham says
[27:50] the scriptures say in here let's go back
[27:54] and look
[27:55] at verse 15.
[28:00] and it came to pass as the angels were
[28:01] gone away from them into heaven the
[28:03] shepherd said one to another let us now
[28:05] go
[28:05] even unto bethlehem and see this thing
[28:07] which has come to pass
[28:10] look at the simplicity of the shepherds
[28:12] they didn't say let's go
[28:13] see if this is true
[28:17] they knew it was true and they were
[28:19] excited and say let's go see this thing
[28:21] that
[28:22] has come to pass they accepted it
[28:26] because an angelic messenger a messenger
[28:29] from
[28:30] heaven told them it was true and they
[28:32] accepted it
[28:33] they didn't need to go talk to the
[28:35] sanhedrin they didn't need to talk to
[28:37] the
[28:37] priest that was in charge of the
[28:38] synagogue of bethlehem they didn't need
[28:40] oh they all they needed was an angel
[28:43] messenger to tell them that christ was
[28:45] here that this
[28:46] is christ he's born in the city of david
[28:48] and they said let's go see this thing
[28:50] that
[28:50] has come to pass
[28:54] oh god make us shepherds amen make us
[28:57] like the shepherds to be able to realize
[28:59] in this day amen this thing has come to
[29:02] pass
[29:02] christ is here amen christ the savior is
[29:05] here
[29:09] then they went and they seen
[29:12] after they seen i mean this is why god
[29:15] chose shepherds
[29:16] they didn't need anybody else's word on
[29:19] it
[29:20] what the angel said was enough
[29:24] then they run down to bethlehem because
[29:26] their excitement to see
[29:28] and when they had seen the vindication
[29:30] of the word
[29:32] the next thing they they say is they run
[29:35] out and begin to tell everybody
[29:37] they didn't need a counsel they didn't
[29:39] need they didn't need
[29:41] approval they didn't need anything they
[29:44] believed they saw
[29:45] and they testified
[29:50] and the scripture says verse 17
[29:53] and when they had seen it they made they
[29:55] made known abroad the saying which was
[29:57] told them concerning this child
[30:00] they're saying this is christ this
[30:03] is the savior this is the fulfillment of
[30:05] prophecy
[30:06] and and listen what says next and all
[30:10] they that heard it wandered at those
[30:11] things which were told them by the
[30:13] shepherds
[30:14] it didn't say they believed they just
[30:17] wondered
[30:18] amen and we've had the same experience
[30:20] in our day we tell them the same story
[30:22] and when we tell them to in present
[30:24] tense there's been an angel messenger he
[30:26] said this and i
[30:27] seen and it's true that christ is here
[30:31] the word is here amen amen the lamb of
[30:34] god is here
[30:35] amen and the bridegroom has come and
[30:37] they wonder
[30:38] now what is that they're talking about
[30:40] what is that what a strange thing
[30:42] why these shepherds are running through
[30:44] bethlehem what is this they're talking
[30:46] about
[30:46] hey friends they're still wondering
[30:48] today
[30:50] there's people who are still wondering
[30:52] about the testimony of simple
[30:54] humble shepherds
[30:57] but that testimony was true and if they
[31:00] had believed that testimony then there
[31:02] would have been no confusion when the
[31:03] wise men
[31:04] showed up about two years later but they
[31:06] had no idea the message of the wise men
[31:09] when they come about two years later
[31:11] because they didn't receive the message
[31:12] of the shepherds
[31:13] and when he did receive the message of
[31:15] the shepherds now there was nobody there
[31:17] that could receive the message of the
[31:18] wise men
[31:21] praise be to god god knows what he's
[31:24] choosing
[31:25] now now
[31:28] bethlehem brother ben tells us was the
[31:32] bread center
[31:34] of that whole region said they grew
[31:36] barley there or wheat or whatever it was
[31:38] and you see them threshing barley and
[31:40] wheat boaz had
[31:41] great wheat and barley farms and there
[31:43] was a time of threshing
[31:45] when ruth come into the land and
[31:46] gleaning and all of that so we know
[31:48] brother ben points to that and says it
[31:49] was a great
[31:50] bread center for all of that area
[31:54] and he says it was a great water a place
[31:56] of water
[31:57] there was a tremendous well of water a
[31:59] spring of water in bethlehem
[32:01] it was a water center and there was a
[32:03] bread center for that area
[32:06] why did god choose bethlehem praise be
[32:10] to god
[32:11] let's turn to john chapter 6.
[32:27] i know to many of you these things are
[32:28] so familiar we go over them all the time
[32:30] but
[32:31] i want the kids to hear and i want the
[32:32] teenager to hear and i want those who've
[32:34] not
[32:34] caught at all i want them to catch it
[32:36] this time around
[32:38] john chapter 6 verse 35 this is the
[32:41] woman
[32:41] this is the woman at the well conversing
[32:43] with jesus in verse 35 it says and jesus
[32:46] said unto them
[32:47] no i'm sorry yeah just six this isn't
[32:50] the woman at the well sorry
[32:51] that'll come later hold that that's
[32:54] that's chapter 4
[32:55] 6 35 and jesus said unto them i am the
[32:58] bread of life
[33:00] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[33:02] and he that believeth on me shall never
[33:04] thirst
[33:05] so you get that bread and water i want
[33:08] you to catch that bread
[33:09] and water he says uh let's read it again
[33:13] he said unto them i am the bread of life
[33:15] that cometh down
[33:16] that i'm sorry that cometh he that
[33:19] cometh to me shall never hunger and he
[33:21] that believeth on me shall never
[33:23] thirst let's go down to verse 48
[33:26] he says i am the bread of life your
[33:28] fathers did eat
[33:29] manna in the wilderness and are dead
[33:31] this is the bread which cometh down from
[33:33] heaven
[33:33] that a man may eat thereof and not die i
[33:37] am the living bread which come down from
[33:39] heaven if any man
[33:40] eateth this bread he shall live forever
[33:42] and the bread that i give is my flesh
[33:45] which i give for the life
[33:46] of the world and his flesh was the word
[33:49] made flesh his flesh was the word
[33:53] his flesh was the manifestation of the
[33:55] word of god for that day
[33:57] and he said i give the bread that i give
[33:59] to you
[34:00] the bread that i give to you is the word
[34:03] made flesh
[34:04] is my flesh and now jesus is the bread
[34:07] so now what came was the lamb of god in
[34:10] bethlehem but bethlehem's the bread
[34:12] center of the world of the bread center
[34:14] of that region
[34:15] and to the bread center of that region
[34:16] comes the bread from heaven
[34:19] and where does he take him he has to be
[34:21] born he has to be born in a stable
[34:23] because he's a lamb but he's not just
[34:25] the lamb he's also bread
[34:28] he's also the weed he's also the seed
[34:30] he's also the
[34:31] the feed amen he's not just the lamb
[34:34] that'll take away the sins of the world
[34:36] he's also the bread of life
[34:38] amen that you have to feed on to live
[34:40] and so where does he take the bread of
[34:42] life
[34:43] he makes sure that the bread of life is
[34:44] not placed in a cradle or not
[34:46] placed in any place it's got to be
[34:48] placed in a manger
[34:50] because what's a manger a manger is a
[34:52] feed trough or a hay rack
[34:54] amen for cattle and for sheep and when
[34:56] the shepherds show up
[34:58] they understand what a manger is and why
[35:01] this little baby is laying in the manger
[35:03] because this was the lamb that was born
[35:05] in the stable but he was placed in the
[35:07] manger
[35:08] because he's sheep food because sheep
[35:11] eat from the manger
[35:12] this has become the not just the lamb
[35:15] that'll take away the
[35:16] sins of the world the sacrificial lamb
[35:17] but he's also the meat
[35:19] he's also the bread he's also the food
[35:21] that we feed on and live
[35:24] shepherds know who is the shepherds
[35:28] let's just say this way the shepherds
[35:30] know where they are in prophecy the
[35:32] shepherds heard the angel messenger
[35:34] the shepherd knows where christ is the
[35:36] shepherd know who
[35:37] christ is and the shepherds know where
[35:39] to take the sheep for sheep food
[35:43] there's still shepherds on earth today
[35:44] that know the same thing
[35:47] whatever happened in that christmas is
[35:48] happening today
[35:51] brother branham said in the message why
[35:53] it had to be shepherds
[35:55] he said why scholars would have been so
[35:57] out of place there he's talking about
[35:59] the stable
[36:00] under such circumstances they had left
[36:02] right quick why
[36:03] the messenger coming to common herdsmen
[36:06] maybe they could not even
[36:07] some of these herdsmen might not have
[36:09] been able to have signed their own name
[36:11] very doubtful you know the herdsmen that
[36:14] jesus chose
[36:15] when he was here on earth to hurt his
[36:16] sheep loveth thou me peter more than
[36:19] these
[36:20] yea lord thou knowest i love thee feed
[36:22] my sheep and the bible said that peter
[36:24] was an ignorant and unlearned man
[36:27] still choosing shepherds brother
[36:30] remember said when jesus was there
[36:32] what is he choosing when he was choosing
[36:33] his disciples he was choosing
[36:35] shepherds and he got the ignorant and
[36:38] unlearned because he said feed my
[36:40] sheep what will you feed the sheep
[36:42] there's nothing else to feed the sheep
[36:44] but the living word amen the bread that
[36:47] have come down the fresh
[36:48] manna from heaven is the only thing that
[36:50] you feed the sheep
[36:51] amen and true shepherds know what to
[36:53] feed the sheep
[36:57] now i want to take a look at zechariah
[36:59] 13. let's go to zechariah 13
[37:02] because i want to look at this water as
[37:05] well
[37:06] he was the bread of life but brother
[37:08] brenham said that bethlehem was also the
[37:10] water sinner and we know that he's also
[37:12] the fountain of living water
[37:16] zechariah 13 1.
[37:22] the book of zechariah chapter 13 verse 1
[37:25] and that day there should be a fountain
[37:27] opened to the house of david
[37:30] and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for
[37:32] sin and for uncleanness
[37:34] and that day there should be a fountain
[37:36] opened to the house of david
[37:38] to the habits of jerusalem for sin and
[37:41] for uncleanness
[37:42] listen to what the prophet of god says
[37:44] in the message why little bethlehem
[37:47] god smote a rock or had moses to do it
[37:50] his prophet smote the rock
[37:52] what was it open the rock what is rock
[37:56] a rock is revelation amen a rock is a
[37:58] revelation of the word of god
[38:00] amen and moses the prophet smote the
[38:03] rock and brother man says what did he do
[38:04] he
[38:05] opened the revelation and out of the
[38:07] revelation come living water
[38:10] and and he goes on to say the rock the
[38:13] rock was
[38:14] christ and christ is the word the rock
[38:17] was christ
[38:18] do you believe it all right then if the
[38:20] prophet opened the rock so life could
[38:22] come out
[38:23] then if it is the rock today we need the
[38:25] holy spirit and
[38:26] some man who will smite back the rock
[38:28] amen and let the word come out
[38:30] because he is the word what's brother
[38:33] ben saying he's saying
[38:34] we need some man we need the holy ghost
[38:36] we need the holy ghost
[38:39] in some man who will smite back the rock
[38:41] amen if it took a
[38:42] moses amen the first time it'll take one
[38:45] like unto moses
[38:47] and who was that one like unto moses it
[38:49] was the prophet of this day brother
[38:51] branham and we need
[38:52] and he says we need the holy spirit and
[38:53] some man who else is that man that could
[38:56] smite back to that rock amen so that
[38:58] life can come out
[39:00] amen and he says listen and some men who
[39:03] will smite back the rock amen
[39:04] and let the word come out
[39:08] because the word is the water of life
[39:11] the word amen
[39:12] is the water of life springing up into
[39:14] everlasting life he said the word come
[39:16] out because that word carries life
[39:18] he said my word they are spirit and they
[39:20] are life
[39:22] he said now strike back the rock amen
[39:24] and let the word come out because he is
[39:26] the word
[39:27] we've bypassed on creeds and drinking
[39:29] stagnant water from cisterns
[39:32] what we need today is an opening of the
[39:35] word that lives

[39:38] about what we need is an
[39:40] opening of the word that lives friends

[39:57] house of david

[40:06] opening of the word that lives

[40:12] forever
[40:13] he cannot fail they they can call it
[40:15] mental telepathy
[40:17] they can say whatever they want to or
[40:19] spiritualism or a devil
[40:21] as long as the word is flowing free and
[40:23] producing
[40:24] exactly what it said it would do it's a
[40:27] fountain in the house of david
[40:28] again what's he saying
[40:32] whatever that fountain was it's a
[40:33] fountain again as long as what as long
[40:36] as that word is flowing freely and doing
[40:38] exactly what it said it would do
[40:40] it's a fountain amen in the in the house
[40:43] of david again
[40:44] back in bethlehem where that jesus
[40:47] christ the same yesterday today forever

[41:00] david again
[41:02] when's it become open again it's become
[41:04] open again at the end time amen
[41:06] when you can go back to bethlehem back
[41:08] to the house of god's bread
[41:09] amen when we can go back to the word
[41:12] made flesh on earth
[41:16] praise be to god in the message broken
[41:20] cisterns
[41:21] prophet said it was standing here in the
[41:24] fountain filled with blood that day
[41:25] standing there in the temple
[41:27] the time of storm in zechariah the 13th
[41:30] chapter
[41:30] he was that fountain opened in the house
[41:32] of david for cleansing and for sin
[41:35] cleansing of sin he was that fountain
[41:37] and in psalm 36 9 he was david's
[41:39] fountain of life
[41:40] he is still that fountain in the house
[41:42] of david
[41:44] and he is the poets in his heart there
[41:46] the poet said there is a fountain filled
[41:48] with blood
[41:49] drawn from emmanuel's veins where
[41:50] sinners plunged beneath the flood
[41:52] lose all their guilty stains he is that
[41:55] fountain of life
[41:56] fountain of water he is the word of god
[42:00] people of these last days has forsook
[42:02] them the true word water of life
[42:04] and that hewed themselves out
[42:06] denominational cisterns
[42:07] again a huge dug and now we find out
[42:11] that they have had broken cisterns
[42:14] and then the cistern is filled with
[42:15] unbelieving germs unbelieving boasting
[42:18] educational programs and so forth which
[42:20] is contrary to god's promise
[42:22] they are doubters of the word now these
[42:25] systems that they've got the bible said
[42:27] we're broken broken cistern is a leaking
[42:29] cistern
[42:30] and it's seeping out what's it doing
[42:32] it's seeping out into religious
[42:33] cesspools called the world council of
[42:35] churches
[42:36] and that's where the the broken cistern
[42:39] is leading them to
[42:40] all because they have forsook him the
[42:43] fountain of living water
[42:44] and made these cisterns it was the same
[42:47] thing in the time that jesus was born
[42:49] amen they dug themselves out cisterns of
[42:52] pharisee
[42:52] camp of pharisee campus sadducee
[42:54] herodians and and all these others
[42:56] amen he came as a fountain of living
[42:59] water
[43:00] amen and where did he come from
[43:01] bethlehem the house of god's bread
[43:03] there's a spring of living water flowing
[43:05] up there's bread for the sheep to eat
[43:08] there's a lamb of god that was born
[43:10] where out of bethlehem
[43:12] the house of god's bread
[43:15] and he is the fountain opened in the
[43:17] house of david and brother branham says
[43:19] what we need
[43:20] is somebody that can smite that bring it
[43:22] back to the word to the opening of the
[43:24] word and whenever the
[43:25] words open and flowing out and doing
[43:27] what it said it would do
[43:28] producing what he said it would produce
[43:31] it's a fountain open in the house of
[43:32] david
[43:33] what is it it's the water is flowing
[43:35] where's it flowing
[43:36] it's flowing from jesus christ the same

[43:46] and forever
[43:48] he is the same he does the same he will
[43:51] forever be the same
[43:53] he is the word made manifest in our day
[43:57] and wherever that's flowing out doing
[43:59] exactly what it said it would do
[44:00] there is where it's a fountain open in
[44:02] the house of david again
[44:04] there's a there's a fountain in
[44:06] bethlehem flowing

[44:28] water

[44:34] a gentile woman rahab salman the prince
[44:37] of israel type of christ
[44:39] coming together and in their union they
[44:41] established a bethlehem
[44:42] out of bethlehem will come boaz and
[44:45] boaz and ruth amen from that will come
[44:48] obed
[44:49] jesse david for the prophecy to be in
[44:51] the son of david the son of david will
[44:53] be born back
[44:54] in bethlehem again why it's back to this
[44:57] original picture of christ and his bride
[45:00] coming together and out of that union
[45:02] there's established a house of god's
[45:03] bread
[45:04] and out of that house of god's bread
[45:06] will come the lamb of god the word of
[45:08] god
[45:08] the water of life the bread from heaven
[45:11] that's why it's back to bethlehem again
[45:13] friends that's why it's back to the
[45:15] original intent the original idea the
[45:17] original mystery that's been laying in
[45:19] the bible the mystery that was there
[45:21] when rahab married solomon
[45:22] the mystery when they went up to
[45:24] bethlehem and established it the mystery
[45:26] of boaz and ruth the mystery of david
[45:28] it's all laying right there in the bible
[45:30] and the mystery is coming to
[45:32] manifestation in this day
[45:34] and where it's manifested in this day
[45:36] the living word
[45:37] made flesh that prophecy that was typed
[45:40] through the bible
[45:40] is now standing on earth in flesh the
[45:43] bridegroom is united with his bride
[45:45] and that is a fountain in the house of
[45:47] david that's open again
[45:48] that is bread from this bread center of
[45:50] the world bethlehem
[45:53] christmas is here christmas is in you

[46:05] now
[46:07] amen that was only showing amen what
[46:10] he's doing to bring about this
[46:12] to bring us back to bethlehem with the
[46:14] original foundational intent of
[46:17] bethlehem
[46:19] because out of bethlehem will come the
[46:21] king that will rule
[46:23] out of bethlehem will come the water
[46:26] will come the bread will come the king
[46:29] the son of david praise god
[46:34] the bible's so beautiful friends and
[46:37] only
[46:37] a prophet of god could go back and pick
[46:39] these pieces up and show you
[46:43] salmon and rahab
[46:46] you know the world looks at the story of
[46:48] rahab and they cannot figure it out
[46:51] they cannot understand rahab the heart
[46:53] they say well you know it's the mercy of
[46:55] god and look how merciful god is they'll
[46:56] even take a
[46:57] harlot and they don't even understand
[46:59] the picture that's being painted amen
[47:01] they don't understand and the moabite is
[47:03] marrying boaz amen they don't
[47:05] understand how how judah could take
[47:08] tamar
[47:09] and deception and bring about the godly
[47:11] seed
[47:13] but we understand because it's our story
[47:16] because we've lived this story and we're
[47:17] living this story amen we
[47:19] understand bethlehem
[47:22] bethlehem was it's not just a little
[47:25] story it's not
[47:26] god didn't say you know where where when
[47:29] when i bring the lamb where would i
[47:31] bring him where will i bring david
[47:33] because david will be my
[47:35] my my chosen king and from my chosen
[47:37] king who will be a son a prophecy of a
[47:40] son of david that will rule forever
[47:42] where will i bring him from i like the
[47:45] ring of bethlehem
[47:46] he knew he knew when ruth was when rahab
[47:48] was born where bethlehem was going to be
[47:50] he knew when solomon crossed the dry
[47:53] jordan
[47:54] where bethlehem could be because it was
[47:56] all playing into the picture he wanted
[47:58] to paint and at the end time we had a
[48:00] prophet of god that could point us all
[48:01] the way back
[48:02] and say that's what was going on when
[48:04] salmon fell in love with rahab the
[48:06] harlot
[48:06] that's what was happening when they
[48:08] moved up to establish bethlehem
[48:10] that's what was happening amen when
[48:12] david was on the hillside
[48:13] longing for water from the well of
[48:15] bethlehem
[48:19] what is it all about it's all about you
[48:22] and i today
[48:23] the mystery of god made manifest
[48:29] i'll keep reading and why little
[48:30] bethlehem and that's exactly where god
[48:32] waters his sheep again
[48:34] his sheep again today where's god
[48:36] watering his sheep again today
[48:39] right back at bethlehem it's cool
[48:43] fresh water right back at bethlehem
[48:47] what was the point of bethlehem what was
[48:50] the point of rehab
[48:53] salmon ruth and boaz david
[48:57] and joseph and mary both from the house
[48:59] of david
[49:00] their lineages both go back to david
[49:02] going back to be taxed
[49:04] going into a stable laying him in a
[49:06] manger
[49:07] what what what is all of that it's all
[49:10] pointing to the word
[49:11] made flesh
[49:15] what's the goal always been to have the
[49:17] word made
[49:18] flesh god
[49:21] prophesied all the way back in genesis
[49:25] in the beginning when he made man and
[49:26] pulled out a woman
[49:27] united them he always showed us that out
[49:30] of christ will come
[49:32] a woman and it'll be the word made flesh
[49:36] and that's the day that we live in right
[49:39] back to bethlehem
[49:40] it's cool fresh water he cried out if
[49:43] only i had a drink from that well again
[49:46] who is it david crying out longing for
[49:48] the water from bethlehem
[49:50] he said i'm going to close now listen
[49:52] close if only i had a drink this is
[49:54] brother brandon preaching his christmas
[49:56] message if only i had a drink
[49:59] inside of him cried out if i could only
[50:01] drink once more from that well at
[50:03] bethlehem
[50:04] his desires was a was a commandment to
[50:07] those who loved him remember his soul
[50:08] was crying for a drink of that water
[50:11] and those who loved him his least desire
[50:13] was a commandment
[50:14] we're told that three of those men got
[50:17] together great men
[50:18] one killed 800 by himself the other one
[50:20] jumped into a pit and killed a lion
[50:23] one took a stick and knocked the spirit
[50:24] of an egyptian's hand and slew him with
[50:26] his own spear
[50:27] and stood on a field of lentil that like
[50:29] that and killed 300 around him
[50:31] great men listen to the next statement
[50:34] they were gentiles
[50:37] great men these great warriors they were
[50:40] gentiles
[50:42] i wonder why they were gentiles i wonder
[50:45] why the greatest of the three the three
[50:47] greatest in the camp of david david was
[50:49] an outcast king he was an anointed king
[50:52] and he was pushed outside the city
[50:54] amen and there was those that gathered
[50:56] outside the camp and they came to the
[50:58] great anointed king
[51:00] who were they who were the greatest
[51:02] three of them they were gentiles amen
[51:04] gentiles because the great king when
[51:06] he's pushed out of the city there's
[51:08] going to be
[51:09] gentile warriors that gather to this
[51:11] king
[51:11] [Music]
[51:13] they were gentiles watch where they came
[51:15] from david here is a type of christ
[51:18] bethlehem because christ is david's son
[51:21] here he stands there crying for a drink
[51:23] of that water
[51:24] and his desire was a command i said to
[51:27] those who love
[51:28] a command i said to those who loved him
[51:30] three of those men pulled their swords
[51:32] fought 15 miles of men down to the city
[51:35] while
[51:36] others fought keeping them were gallant
[51:38] fighting men those philistines twice
[51:40] their size some of them
[51:41] but they were men gallant who could
[51:43] fight one of them stood alone
[51:45] alone handed and killed 800 men right
[51:48] around them in one day
[51:49] they were great men they trusted god
[51:51] they had faith in their leader
[51:53] and they cut his way down through until
[51:55] while some of them
[51:56] cut and the other one got a bucket of
[51:58] water and they cut their way
[52:00] back through another 15 miles of men and
[52:02] brought that up to david so he could
[52:04] drink it
[52:06] david was the outcast king and to him
[52:08] were gathered
[52:10] mighty gentile warriors the greatest of
[52:12] his warriors were gentiles
[52:14] because in this day when we go back to
[52:17] bethlehem to get the water of life
[52:20] there'll be gentiles that are fighting
[52:22] their way through denominational
[52:24] demons that are trying to keep the
[52:25] people from the water
[52:28] this water this original word amen the
[52:30] original word that was originally
[52:32] brought to us amen that paul had brought
[52:34] in the new testament that was corrupted
[52:36] it's garrisoned about by philistines but
[52:39] praise god there are warriors who have
[52:41] gathered to the son of david amen
[52:43] to the outcast king and they're willing
[52:45] to fight their way
[52:46] just because the king wants a drink of
[52:48] that original water from bethlehem
[52:50] with the original purpose with the
[52:52] original intent
[52:54] and they're willing to fight their way
[52:56] through to get that drink of water for
[52:58] him
[53:00] he goes on to say oh you bethlehem
[53:03] dwellers
[53:04] i call for men warriors who's not afraid
[53:08] i don't care if there's 800 standing on
[53:10] one side and 10 000
[53:11] on the other i want warriors who will
[53:13] come with me and cut a hole through this
[53:15] line of unbelieving philistines
[53:17] the world council that has got
[53:19] garrisoned around the word of god
[53:21] trying to make it creeds and feed the
[53:23] people
[53:24] what's he saying he said what is it that
[53:26] surrounded bethlehem to keep the people
[53:28] from the water
[53:29] and the bread of life amen what are they
[53:31] trying to keep the people from
[53:32] they're trying to keep the people from
[53:34] the word
[53:38] but there's warriors who will fight
[53:39] their way through the word there's a
[53:42] he said there's a well there's a
[53:44] fountain open in the house of david
[53:46] bethlehem for sin and then clean his
[53:49] brother
[53:49] sin is unbelief in his word there's a
[53:53] fountain
[53:53] open to the house of david for cleansing
[53:56] from sin
[53:57] what is sin unbelief what will cleanse
[53:59] us from unbelief
[54:00] the original unadulterated pure word of
[54:03] god will come and wash us from
[54:05] from the harlotry of the systems from
[54:08] unbelief in the word amen from
[54:11] corruption of creeds
[54:12] and they've garrisoned off bethlehem to
[54:14] keep the people from the water and from
[54:16] the bread
[54:16] and they've come up with creeds to feed
[54:18] the people
[54:20] but there are gentile warriors on this
[54:23] earth who will do the same thing they
[54:24] did back there
[54:25] that was only a foreshadow of our day
[54:28] and there's gentile words today that
[54:30] will cut their way through creeds
[54:31] dogmas philistine demons to get back to
[54:34] the water in bethlehem and get back to
[54:36] the bread center
[54:40] and they may look like shepherds
[54:44] praise be to god in a thinking man's
[54:47] filter
[54:48] brother brother said it's a perfect
[54:50] place calling you to that perfection
[54:53] and you have to be perfect to get there
[54:56] the bible said so jesus said be
[54:59] therefore perfect even as your father in
[55:01] heaven is perfect
[55:02] it's a perfect kingdom so it must be a
[55:04] perfect people come
[55:06] because you have to stand and be married
[55:08] to a perfect son of god and you must be
[55:10] a perfect bride
[55:11] so how can you do it through anything
[55:12] else but the perfect word of god
[55:14] which is the waters of separation that
[55:17] washes us from our sins
[55:19] what do you need you need that water
[55:21] from bethlehem
[55:23] why because he's calling for a perfect
[55:24] bride to be in a perfect
[55:27] condition to be married to a perfect
[55:28] bridegroom how can you do it there's
[55:30] only one way
[55:31] you need that perfect water that's the
[55:34] water of separation that'll wash you
[55:36] from uncleanness to wash you from creeds
[55:38] and dogmas
[55:39] wash you from ideas of man wash you from
[55:41] all the unbelief that's the only way you
[55:44] can stand perfect and unadulterated
[55:46] virgin bride of jesus christ is if we
[55:48] let this water from bethlehem wash us
[55:54] but it will take the perfect word of god
[55:56] which is the waters of separation that
[55:58] washes us from our sins amen
[55:59] that's right the blood of jesus christ
[56:01] think of it the dripping bloody word
[56:03] amen
[56:04] the word of god bleeding blood to wash
[56:06] the bride and
[56:07] yes sir she stands perfect virgin
[56:09] unadulterated
[56:10] she never sinned in the first place amen
[56:13] she was trapped into it
[56:14] so what's it going to take it's going to
[56:16] take that water from the well of
[56:17] bethlehem
[56:18] and when those three men cut their way
[56:20] down there and they scooped up that
[56:21] water bucket and they run it back to
[56:23] david
[56:23] david took that water which is the water
[56:26] of life amen
[56:27] representing the blood of jesus christ
[56:29] and he took that water and he poured it
[56:32] out on the ground
[56:33] in a prophecy showing that one day the
[56:35] son of david will spill his blood out
[56:38] upon the water
[56:39] and out of that blood will come the
[56:41] water of life
[56:42] to bring the people back to the water of
[56:44] life from bethlehem
[56:47] amen david took that water and how
[56:50] could i drink this when these men
[56:51] sacrificed and he poured it out and
[56:53] brother branham said he was just showing
[56:55] that christ would spill out his blood as
[56:57] an offering to god
[57:01] and that life that was spilled would
[57:03] become the water of life for you and i
[57:08] again in thinking's man's filter he says
[57:10] also now we want to look at ephesians 5
[57:13] 26 that it's the washing of the water by
[57:15] the word
[57:17] a waters of separation what does it do
[57:19] then the filter of god is the word
[57:21] waters of separation
[57:22] washes washing of the waters of
[57:24] separation by the word
[57:26] god's filter then you can't come into
[57:29] christ through a church filter you can't
[57:31] come by denominational filter or creed
[57:33] filter
[57:33] there's only one filter that you can
[57:35] enter into the holy place
[57:36] and that's through the washing of the
[57:38] water by the word
[57:40] the word of god is a thinking man's
[57:42] filtering
[57:43] and the word of god is the waters of
[57:45] separation that washes us
[57:47] and separates us from our sin of
[57:48] unbelief where is that water
[57:50] i want to tell you there's a fountain
[57:52] open in the house of david
[57:54] because when the word amen is flowing
[57:57] freely and doing what he said he would
[57:58] do
[57:59] the manifestation of the word for the
[58:01] hour amen doing exactly what he said he
[58:03] would do
[58:04] is a fountain opened in the house of god
[58:06] there's water flowing from bethlehem
[58:08] friends we can cut our way through and
[58:11] get to that water
[58:13] let's go back to zechariah
[58:20] if while you're turning zechariah go
[58:21] back to zechariah chapter 12. i want to
[58:23] read this quote out of the invisible
[58:24] union
[58:26] what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in
[58:29] what
[58:29] the word unbelief in god which is the
[58:32] word
[58:33] pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving
[58:36] soon for the skies amen
[58:38] standing ready think your garments
[58:40] washed by the water of the bleeding word
[58:42] the word became blood the word bled for
[58:45] you and you are
[58:46] washed in the bleeding word the word
[58:48] bleeding the life of god
[58:50] in the word and the word was bled for
[58:52] you that you might be washed from the
[58:54] filth of these prostitutes
[58:55] and be cleansed and sanctified by the
[58:57] washing of the water
[58:58] of the word and makes your mind and
[59:00] heart stayed on god
[59:02] and on his word that fountain is open
[59:05] friends that water is flowing out of
[59:08] bethlehem
[59:09] amen and and we can cut our way to that
[59:12] water
[59:14] zechariah chapter 12. i want to back up
[59:17] just before we had read
[59:18] 13 1 13 1 says in that day and i just
[59:22] want to know
[59:23] in what day in that day there shall be a
[59:25] fountain open in the house of david
[59:27] to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin
[59:29] and for uncleanness and i want to just
[59:30] back up and just take the scriptures
[59:32] before
[59:33] and start a chapter or chapter 12 verse
[59:35] 10.
[59:36] and i will pour upon the house of david
[59:38] and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem
[59:40] the spirit of grace and of supplication
[59:43] and they shall look upon me whom they
[59:44] have pierced and they shall mourn for
[59:46] him as one mourneth for his only son
[59:49] and shall be in bitterness for him as
[59:50] one that is in bitterness for his
[59:52] firstborn
[59:53] in that day shall there be a great
[59:54] morning in jerusalem as the morning of
[59:57] had had a dreamland in the valley of
[59:59] mcgeeden
[1:00:01] and the land shall mourn every family
[1:00:02] apart in the family of the house of
[1:00:04] david apart and their wives and the
[1:00:05] family of the house of nathan apart and
[1:00:06] their wives
[1:00:07] apart and the family of the house of
[1:00:09] levi apart and their wives apart the
[1:00:10] family of shemia apart and their wives
[1:00:12] apart
[1:00:13] and all the families that remain every
[1:00:14] family apart and their wives apart
[1:00:16] and in that day there shall be a
[1:00:18] fountain open in the house of david
[1:00:21] we know that this is speaking about a
[1:00:23] time when two witnesses are going to be
[1:00:25] prophesying and showing messiah
[1:00:27] the word amen the word made flesh jesus
[1:00:30] christ
[1:00:31] to the 144 thousand and this this is
[1:00:34] bringing them to the feast of atonement
[1:00:36] where they recognize amen that they have
[1:00:38] slain
[1:00:39] the lamb of god and they separate every
[1:00:41] man to them house and mourn
[1:00:42] but brother branham takes the same thing
[1:00:44] and types it
[1:00:45] right back to the church because where
[1:00:47] did he get his wounds in the house of
[1:00:49] his so-called friends
[1:00:51] and we look back in this day because
[1:00:53] we've come to the true atonement to the
[1:00:55] word to recognize
[1:00:56] it's the word that bled for us it's the
[1:00:58] word that died for us that the true
[1:01:00] atonement is the word
[1:01:01] and the word has been crucified by
[1:01:03] creeds and dogmas in churchianity and
[1:01:05] church systems
[1:01:05] and we stand today and we separate from
[1:01:08] those things and we look back and say
[1:01:10] oh they've been crucifying the word
[1:01:12] they've been piercing the word
[1:01:13] it's been the word and in this day
[1:01:18] amen we've mourned over the fact that
[1:01:21] it's been denominational systems and
[1:01:22] denominational teaching in our own
[1:01:24] denominational ideas
[1:01:26] that has been crucifying the lamb of god
[1:01:29] we mourn and then we come to rejoicing
[1:01:32] because we recognize he returned
[1:01:36] so it's in that day the day that they
[1:01:39] recognize their messiah
[1:01:42] i just want you to hold on to that it's
[1:01:44] the day that they recognize their
[1:01:45] messiah
[1:01:47] and we know that there's a future
[1:01:48] fulfillment of that under the
[1:01:50] two prophets moses and elijah but in the
[1:01:53] feast of trumpets brother branham said
[1:01:54] think of it
[1:01:55] it's the end time folks hallelujah the
[1:01:58] great day of the lord is at hand
[1:02:00] gather yourselves together to the feast
[1:02:02] of the messiah
[1:02:04] they'll reject him and they'll find out
[1:02:06] that there is their messiah
[1:02:08] the bible said them striking things like
[1:02:10] this would take place
[1:02:11] in revelation 11 call their ministry
[1:02:13] will be the ministry of moses and elias
[1:02:15] calling to israel out of the jewish
[1:02:17] traditions just
[1:02:19] as the seventh angel's message called
[1:02:21] the bride out of pentecostal traditions
[1:02:23] so brother madam is typing the same
[1:02:25] scene that's going to take place in the
[1:02:27] future he's typing it with his own
[1:02:29] ministry
[1:02:31] just as the seventh angels message
[1:02:33] called the bride out of the pentecostal
[1:02:35] traditions remember
[1:02:36] moses and elijah is to call israel out
[1:02:38] of the old atonement of the lamb
[1:02:40] and sheep and blood and goats and
[1:02:42] sacrifice to the real living sacrifice
[1:02:45] to the word
[1:02:48] so they're going to show them that you
[1:02:49] you you you crucified the lord of glory
[1:02:53] amen he's going to they're going to show
[1:02:54] them the word because they're going to
[1:02:55] receive the same message that we're
[1:02:57] receiving amen
[1:02:58] and it brings them to the feast of
[1:02:59] atonement where they mourn for what they
[1:03:00] lost
[1:03:01] but they come to the word for their
[1:03:02] atonement the true brother brother of
[1:03:04] them says
[1:03:05] the real living sacrifice to the word
[1:03:10] and the seventh angel's message under
[1:03:12] the same trumpet
[1:03:13] same everything exactly the same seal is
[1:03:15] to what call the people the bride
[1:03:18] out of the pentecostal world tradition
[1:03:21] to the
[1:03:21] genuine atonement the word christ
[1:03:24] impersonated in his word here
[1:03:26] made flesh among us what they what
[1:03:30] happened to them
[1:03:30] has happened to the church amen has
[1:03:33] happened to the bride
[1:03:34] she's been called out of the old
[1:03:36] pentecostal tradition
[1:03:37] and she's been brought into the true
[1:03:39] atonement the living sacrifice
[1:03:41] to the word
[1:03:44] and it's in that day
[1:03:47] it's in that day that there's a fountain
[1:03:51] open in the house of david
[1:03:55] brother brahms said in the message why
[1:03:57] little bethlehem
[1:04:00] you say well i belong to the biggest
[1:04:02] organization
[1:04:04] that takes you that much further from
[1:04:05] god you say i do this that
[1:04:07] that just takes you that much further
[1:04:09] you've got to humble yourself until you
[1:04:11] see that
[1:04:12] until if you abide in me and my words
[1:04:15] abide in you
[1:04:16] then ask what you will what we try to do
[1:04:19] as soon as god gives us a little
[1:04:21] shower blessings we try to twist it all
[1:04:23] up and get dignitaries in there that's
[1:04:25] going to make great big names and
[1:04:27] outdo the other ones this one starts
[1:04:30] this way and that one
[1:04:31] god leaves the whole thing what we need
[1:04:34] today is a fresh pouring out of the holy
[1:04:36] spirit upon the hearts that's humble
[1:04:39] let's go to john chapter 4.
[1:04:45] i want to read two scriptures as we
[1:04:46] close john chapter 4.
[1:04:54] this is the story of the woman at the
[1:04:55] well that i misquoted earlier
[1:05:00] verse 10 john chapter 4 verse 10 jesus
[1:05:03] answered and said unto her
[1:05:05] if thou knewest the gift of god and who
[1:05:07] it is that saith to thee give me to
[1:05:09] drink
[1:05:10] thou wouldn't have asked of him and he
[1:05:12] would have given thee living water
[1:05:15] see jesus was that fountain from
[1:05:17] bethlehem
[1:05:19] jesus was the fountain of living waters
[1:05:21] from bethlehem
[1:05:23] and the woman saith unto him sir thou
[1:05:25] has nothing to draw with and the well is
[1:05:27] deep from winston
[1:05:28] hast thou the living water art thou
[1:05:30] greater than our father jacob which gave
[1:05:32] us the well and drank thereof himself
[1:05:34] and his children and his cattle
[1:05:36] jesus answered and said unto her
[1:05:38] whosoever drinketh of this water
[1:05:40] shall thirst again but whosoever
[1:05:42] drinketh of the water that i shall give
[1:05:44] him shall never thirst
[1:05:46] but the water that i shall give him
[1:05:47] shall be in him a well of water
[1:05:50] springing up into everlasting life
[1:05:53] he was the he was the fountain
[1:05:57] of the house of david he was the the
[1:06:00] water from bethlehem
[1:06:02] but he said if you come to this well and
[1:06:04] drink
[1:06:06] you'll have water coming out of you
[1:06:09] let's go to john chapter 7.
[1:06:16] john chapter 7 verse 37
[1:06:20] in the last day the great day of the
[1:06:22] feast
[1:06:23] that's the last day the eighth day of
[1:06:25] the seventh feast
[1:06:27] the last day the great day of the feast
[1:06:29] jesus stood and cried
[1:06:30] saying if any man thirst let him come
[1:06:33] unto me
[1:06:34] and drink he that believeth on me as the
[1:06:38] scripture has said
[1:06:39] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[1:06:42] living water
[1:06:45] he said he is the well
[1:06:48] he is the bread amen
[1:06:52] the water is still flowing friends
[1:06:55] it's still there and and for some it may
[1:06:58] still be behind
[1:07:00] the army of philistines but it's still
[1:07:02] there that foul has been opened in this
[1:07:04] day because the word has been made
[1:07:06] manifest the word is flowing freely amen
[1:07:08] we've come
[1:07:09] back to bethlehem we've come back to the
[1:07:11] original we've come back to the word
[1:07:13] made flesh
[1:07:14] amen we've come back to the original
[1:07:16] intent of christ and his bride coming
[1:07:18] together
[1:07:20] and there's a fountain open there's a
[1:07:21] well open and we can drink from that
[1:07:23] well but if we drink from that well be
[1:07:25] we
[1:07:25] become the well amen
[1:07:28] we become the shepherds amen we become
[1:07:31] just like peter when he says
[1:07:33] ignorant and unlearned but peter would
[1:07:34] you feed my sheep amen
[1:07:36] and and he's sending out shepherds and
[1:07:39] he's still sending out shepherds friends
[1:07:41] he's still sending out those that'll go
[1:07:43] to bethlehem and see
[1:07:44] amen that christ is here amen that the
[1:07:46] word is made flesh
[1:07:48] and will believe what the angel said and
[1:07:50] will run around
[1:07:51] and say hey guess what an angel said and
[1:07:53] look it's the truth
[1:07:56] and we'll stand in revelation 22 we need
[1:07:59] shepherds that'll stand in revelation 22
[1:08:01] 17 and say if anybody's thirst let him
[1:08:04] come and drink
[1:08:06] why because there's water here the lamb
[1:08:08] is here the bread
[1:08:10] is here the water is here eat and live
[1:08:12] drink and live
[1:08:14] amen feast on the lamb why
[1:08:17] because it's christmas all over again
[1:08:20] he's been
[1:08:20] born brother branham back in this
[1:08:23] message
[1:08:24] why little bethlehem right where i
[1:08:27] stopped he said
[1:08:28] we need a fresh pouring out of the holy
[1:08:30] spirit upon hearts
[1:08:31] that that's humble we need a real
[1:08:34] christmas
[1:08:35] a birthplace listen when brother man's
[1:08:38] talking about christmas he's bringing it
[1:08:39] right
[1:08:39] to his day we need a real christmas
[1:08:43] a birthplace what is a christmas what
[1:08:46] was that
[1:08:46] what was that christmas it was a
[1:08:48] birthplace for the word
[1:08:50] made flesh to be born and it was born in
[1:08:53] the house of god's bread
[1:08:56] in the city of david we need a real
[1:08:58] christmas a birthplace
[1:09:00] he says if you could realize that you're
[1:09:02] nothing but a stable
[1:09:05] that's not hard can you realize you're
[1:09:07] nothing but a stable
[1:09:09] you realize you're nothing but a stable
[1:09:12] god didn't go to jerusalem
[1:09:13] to shiloh or raymond gilead he came to a
[1:09:16] stable that was polluted
[1:09:18] when you let god you become and you
[1:09:20] realize in yourself that you're nothing
[1:09:22] but a stinking stable
[1:09:25] but welcome open your doors when these
[1:09:28] great big
[1:09:28] places and ends are turning him away
[1:09:31] open your doors of the manger of your
[1:09:32] heart and let jehovah
[1:09:34] come in to that and watch what takes
[1:09:36] place for he is the word he said if you
[1:09:38] abide in me
[1:09:39] my word in you he is the word let him
[1:09:42] come into you
[1:09:43] and watch what takes place we can just
[1:09:46] realize
[1:09:47] that you're a stinking stable
[1:09:50] but just open yourself to him amen and
[1:09:53] and let
[1:09:54] the word made flesh be birthed amen in
[1:09:56] you amen that stable that day
[1:09:58] so long ago it became a temple
[1:10:02] why because the lamb of god was there
[1:10:05] because god was
[1:10:06] was abiding there amen and that he moved
[1:10:08] into a little house and when the magi
[1:10:10] showed up the wise men nearly two years
[1:10:12] later
[1:10:12] he was living in a house and they went
[1:10:13] into the house and they began to worship
[1:10:15] in the house
[1:10:16] because christ was there but christ is
[1:10:19] here and he can be in you and you can
[1:10:21] worship him
[1:10:23] you can drink from the well of bethlehem
[1:10:26] you can
[1:10:26] feast on the bread from the bread center
[1:10:29] you can see the lamb
[1:10:30] and then be humble enough to be a
[1:10:32] shepherd and say
[1:10:33] i believe the report of the angel and i
[1:10:36] believe enough
[1:10:37] just to say what he said and to say what
[1:10:40] i see
[1:10:40] and to say what's the truth
[1:10:45] could you imagine you know them taking
[1:10:47] the shepherds and begin to question them
[1:10:49] in the synagogue in bethlehem
[1:10:51] now what about this word and what about
[1:10:53] this prophecy and what about this and
[1:10:54] what about that
[1:10:55] and the shepherds amen probably
[1:10:57] illiterate probably couldn't sign their
[1:10:58] name
[1:10:59] they couldn't answer their questions
[1:11:00] they couldn't defend their doctrine
[1:11:02] oh they didn't have to defend their
[1:11:04] doctrine it came from heaven amen
[1:11:06] they saw the vindication with their own
[1:11:08] eyes they knew it was true
[1:11:10] they went about just saying what they
[1:11:11] had heard and what they had seen
[1:11:13] amen they didn't need to prove it to the
[1:11:15] sanhedrin they didn't need to prove it
[1:11:17] to the temple guards or the or the
[1:11:19] synagogues or the high priest or
[1:11:21] whatever elders there were all they were
[1:11:23] commissioned to do
[1:11:24] was to believe what the angel had sent
[1:11:27] and they were simple enough to do it
[1:11:31] listen let's be shepherds
[1:11:34] let your heart be a manger let your old
[1:11:36] stinking stable open its doors and
[1:11:38] welcome him when he's turned out from
[1:11:40] all the end
[1:11:41] hey if this is if this is where you want
[1:11:43] to come then come
[1:11:46] we welcome you if you drink of the water
[1:11:50] you become a fountain because the word
[1:11:53] is
[1:11:54] living this day friends it's not dead
[1:11:57] christ isn't dead he's alive the word is
[1:12:00] made flesh
[1:12:01] again and there's
[1:12:04] water there's bread there's
[1:12:08] life in bethlehem let this be our
[1:12:12] christmas
[1:12:13] but brother graham said what we need is
[1:12:14] a real christmas
[1:12:16] not an inflatable santa claus in
[1:12:18] somebody's yard
[1:12:20] not a little manger scene what we need
[1:12:23] is a manger scene tonight
[1:12:27] we need a manger scene in the bethlehem
[1:12:29] dwellers we need a manger scene with
[1:12:31] humble
[1:12:32] shepherds that can humble themselves and
[1:12:34] just believe what the angel said
[1:12:37] we need a real christmas the world's
[1:12:40] caught up in fantasy
[1:12:42] the world is caught up in storytelling
[1:12:46] but there's a real christmas that's
[1:12:48] going on now
[1:12:50] there's a real bethlehem with a real
[1:12:52] fountain and real bread
[1:12:54] and i say come to the water of life and
[1:12:58] drink freely
[1:12:59] come come into bethlehem come drink from
[1:13:03] the well come eat of the bread
