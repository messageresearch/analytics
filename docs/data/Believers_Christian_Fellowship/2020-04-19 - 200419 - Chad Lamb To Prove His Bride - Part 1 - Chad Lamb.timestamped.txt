[0:19] [Music]
[0:28] yesterday
[0:29] [Music]
[0:41] here i am
[0:44] [Music]
[0:50] one more time
[0:54] here i am
[0:58] [Music]
[1:09] in praise
[1:15] [Music]
[1:21] yesterday today
[1:24] [Music]
[1:27] forever i will praise your holy name
[1:34] here i am again
[1:37] [Music]
[1:47] praise the lord
[1:50] don't you love to worship him
[1:52] don't you love to tell him how wonderful
[1:54] he is
[1:55] and how much you appreciate him amen
[1:58] that it's certainly good to be here with
[1:59] you today and it's nice to see the
[2:01] families together and some of the
[2:03] sisters are able to join us
[2:05] the singing is much
[2:06] nicer and god bless you we just
[2:09] appreciate it while we're standing let's
[2:11] take our bibles and we'll go to first
[2:12] corinthians and we'll read this
[2:13] scripture and pray we'll let you have
[2:15] your seeds
[2:18] look at first corinthians chapter three
[2:22] verse 18.
[2:26] first corinthians 3
[2:29] and 18
[2:31] let no man deceive himself
[2:33] if any man among you seemeth to be wise
[2:35] in this world let him become a fool that
[2:38] he may be wise
[2:40] hallelujah what a statement let him
[2:43] become a fool that he may be wise
[2:46] for the wisdom of this world is
[2:48] foolishness with god for it is written
[2:50] he taketh the wise in their own
[2:52] craftiness
[2:54] and again the lord knoweth the thoughts
[2:56] of the wise that they are vain
[3:00] so many times we think wisdom is the
[3:02] pinnacle of everything but only godly
[3:04] wisdom is
[3:05] the wisdom of man is just vain
[3:08] and let's bow our heads and pray dear
[3:10] lord jesus we thank you god for this day
[3:12] and this opportunity to be here
[3:14] though we appreciate god that you've
[3:16] allowed us this privilege where we can
[3:18] gather together even if it's not the
[3:20] whole congregation but this is a
[3:22] privilege for us lord we don't take it
[3:24] lightly but we want to thank you god and
[3:26] we want to worship you with full hearts
[3:28] and when i ask lord that you would just
[3:30] take this vessel of clay inadequate and
[3:33] incapable as a human being but in your
[3:35] hand you can do all things lord
[3:38] we ask that you would move the man out
[3:39] of the way but you would come yourself
[3:41] by the power of your holy spirit and
[3:43] preach your eternal words of life lord
[3:45] then we might receive exactly what we
[3:47] have need of in this hour that we're
[3:49] living for we can look nowhere else but
[3:51] to you lord for leadership because there
[3:54] is no other leadership that can lead us
[3:56] through
[3:56] we love your god and ask your blessings
[3:58] over everything that will be said
[4:00] bless our ears to hear in our hearts to
[4:02] perceive all that you have for us in
[4:04] jesus christ's name we pray amen
[4:07] you can be seated if you can just keep
[4:09] your spot here in the bible
[4:12] i want to give you a little update i saw
[4:14] uh
[4:14] brother steve and sister marsha here on
[4:16] friday brother steve's having a hard
[4:18] time keeping out of the office so he
[4:20] came in to get a little work done so it
[4:22] was really good to see him and sister
[4:23] marshall was actually here at the prayer
[4:25] time on friday and it was really good to
[4:28] see them and see they're doing good
[4:30] they're improving brother steve still
[4:31] has a little bit of weakness but he's
[4:33] getting better and better we thank god
[4:35] for that and also sister bessie's doing
[4:38] really well she's really made a good
[4:39] bounce back and brother dave's been
[4:42] doing great no symptoms but he's been
[4:43] under quarantine
[4:45] and he told me his quarantine's supposed
[4:47] to lift tomorrow
[4:49] so he is looking forward to that
[4:51] he told me he's just gonna pack a lunch
[4:53] get in the car and take a long drive
[4:56] somewhere so i just pray the lord will
[4:58] bless him with a beautiful sunny day and
[5:00] clear roads and letting him and his wife
[5:02] enjoy their time out but he's been stuck
[5:05] in the house and brother dave doesn't do
[5:07] well stuck in the house
[5:08] and so he's been under a different kind
[5:11] of trial
[5:12] also i had the privilege yesterday of
[5:13] talking to brother gene petry he's in
[5:15] the hospital in an icu unit
[5:17] and he's been there for several days and
[5:20] it looks like he'll be there several
[5:21] more days he had double pneumonia the
[5:23] bad case of pneumonia in both lungs so
[5:25] he's getting treatment there but he's
[5:27] responding to it he's still tired he's
[5:29] still sick he needs the lord to deliver
[5:32] him but he was in good spirits when i
[5:34] talked to him yesterday
[5:35] and i talked to him the day before and
[5:37] you know he was really tired and weak
[5:39] and from one day to the next the next
[5:41] day i talked to him he started quoting
[5:42] scripture and when he started quoting
[5:44] scripture to me i knew things were on
[5:46] the upswing and he started talking about
[5:48] the word and started talking about
[5:50] you know connections he was making in
[5:53] the message and i thought praise the
[5:54] lord god bless brother gene
[5:56] and he told me the only people he has to
[5:58] witness to is the people coming in to
[6:00] care for him so
[6:01] he's witnessing down there
[6:03] so god bless him just keep praying for
[6:05] him he's still in serious condition but
[6:07] stable
[6:08] he needs the lord to touch him he's
[6:10] still very sick so just keep praying for
[6:12] him and for his family as well
[6:14] so we appreciate that i also say it's
[6:17] really nice to be able to have some more
[6:19] together i thank god for this
[6:21] opportunity you know most of the world
[6:23] is completely shut down
[6:25] and then completely
[6:27] shot doors closed no opportunity but by
[6:31] the grace of god ohio is
[6:33] deemed churches religious institutions
[6:36] an essential business and allow the
[6:37] doors to stay open
[6:39] and we have to fulfill some requirements
[6:41] we have to do you know what's in the
[6:43] order for us to do but that to me that's
[6:45] a small price to pay to be able to
[6:47] gather together and worship the lord
[6:49] it's not the way we would like to do it
[6:51] but i thank god that we can be here and
[6:52] i can see your face and we can worship
[6:55] together so it's a privilege that we
[6:57] shouldn't take lightly because very few
[6:59] in the world have this privilege
[7:01] we just want to thank god for that and
[7:03] we want to respect them
[7:05] also i want to say it's really hard not
[7:07] to have the older ones with us our older
[7:09] brothers and sisters because
[7:11] you know we would have no church we
[7:13] would have nothing without them
[7:15] they're our fathers and our mothers
[7:16] they're the one who's paid for this
[7:17] building
[7:18] they're the one who paid for the camera
[7:20] to have streaming they're the one who
[7:22] who's labored to keep the message and
[7:24] stay true to the word and keep things
[7:26] going we would have nothing we have if
[7:28] it wasn't for our older brothers and
[7:30] sisters so it's we would love to give
[7:32] them a place of preference amen that
[7:34] they would get to go first and not us
[7:36] but it's just the way things are in the
[7:38] situation we find ourselves in this is
[7:39] the way it needs to be but it's no lack
[7:41] of respect for them we have tremendous
[7:43] respect
[7:44] and
[7:45] we've had some threats of an uprising
[7:50] but
[7:51] but praise the lord because they're also
[7:52] the most faithful
[7:54] and they've been the most faithful for
[7:56] the longest and this is a trial for them
[7:58] too and just keep praying for them and
[8:00] we just want to say that we love you we
[8:02] appreciate all you've done for us
[8:04] because we couldn't be here if it wasn't
[8:05] for you all and you're in our thoughts
[8:07] and in our prayers and we think of you
[8:09] often and we can't wait till things
[8:12] change
[8:13] and with
[8:14] with with no restriction we can all come
[8:16] back together and and worship the way we
[8:18] want to
[8:20] i also want to say that we had nice to
[8:22] see people at the prayer time friday and
[8:24] yesterday it was really a special time i
[8:28] came in at the end yesterday and just
[8:30] broke down you know because it was such
[8:31] an atmosphere when god's people are
[8:33] praying you know i usually come in and
[8:35] pray at the beginning of the prayer time
[8:37] so at five yesterday i came in and
[8:38] prayed and the people were just in and
[8:41] out at different times praying and
[8:42] there's just a few people at a time they
[8:44] come in and pray and then go and then
[8:46] somebody else will slip in
[8:48] but when i come at the end of that
[8:50] prayer time after five hours something's
[8:52] different and uh there's an atmosphere
[8:55] that you just can't explain and so i
[8:57] just appreciate god's people coming
[8:59] together to pray
[9:00] i appreciate having that privilege as
[9:02] well and i know many of you are praying
[9:03] in your homes i know you're remembering
[9:06] you know the rest of the body the rest
[9:08] of the bride and we appreciate that and
[9:10] i know for a lot of people this has been
[9:12] a time of revival and refreshing and
[9:14] renewing because some people have had
[9:16] less work or no work and time at home as
[9:18] a family and i've heard from several
[9:20] people they've listened to a ton of
[9:22] messages they've read books they've went
[9:24] back and streamed archives and streamed
[9:26] other services from other places and so
[9:28] for a lot of people this has been a
[9:29] strengthening time and i thank god for
[9:32] that because i feel like this is a time
[9:34] to get stronger for what comes next
[9:36] and we always like to think that
[9:38] when this trial is over everything well
[9:41] you realize this one's just building for
[9:43] the next and the next we'll build for
[9:44] the one after that
[9:45] and god is just training us and
[9:47] strengthening us and building us for
[9:49] what he wants to accomplish in this day
[9:51] that we live in and so we always think
[9:54] we'll be out of the woods after this one
[9:56] but it hasn't happened yet
[9:58] i mean it just hasn't happened brother
[10:00] branham said you know you're either
[10:01] going into a trial in a trial you're
[10:04] coming out of a trial so
[10:06] if you're out of one just beware
[10:09] there's another one coming somewhere
[10:11] we didn't come to this life for a picnic
[10:13] we're not here for pleasure we're here
[10:15] for training
[10:16] and training for reigning and god is
[10:18] going to accomplish his purpose in us
[10:21] he's going to help us to go through
[10:22] enough of the negatives and enough of
[10:24] the up and downs to know that we can
[10:27] trust his word and his word only
[10:29] and we're going to know his
[10:30] characteristics and we know his
[10:31] character we're going to have a love for
[10:33] him a profound love for him because
[10:34] we've seen the contrast
[10:37] and so that's what god is accomplishing
[10:39] and we want to let him accomplish it and
[10:41] i i don't want to begrudge
[10:43] the things that he allows to come our
[10:45] way because it's accomplishing his
[10:46] purpose
[10:48] i don't want to be too upset it's not
[10:50] what i like and i've expressed some of
[10:52] my dislike and i have to repent for that
[10:54] but i thank god that he knows what's
[10:56] best and he knows what we need and he
[10:58] knows when we need it and he gives it to
[11:00] us exactly when we have need of it so
[11:02] this trial is also accomplishing
[11:04] something good in his kingdom and that
[11:06] we're thankful for
[11:07] we just want to ask god to have his
[11:10] absolute perfect way with us
[11:13] uh this morning i'd like to take as a
[11:15] subject to the the title to prove his
[11:18] bride
[11:19] to prove his bride and these are nothing
[11:21] new that i want to share in fact it's a
[11:23] review of many things we've been talking
[11:25] about for quite a while and it's just
[11:27] the way the lord has led and this is the
[11:29] inspiration that he's given for today
[11:32] and i myself have been looking for
[11:33] different inspiration
[11:35] i waited all day for two days i wanted
[11:38] to go in a different direction i said
[11:40] god we want something fresh something
[11:41] different let's forget about our
[11:43] troubles and our trials and let's launch
[11:45] into new territory and open up the word
[11:47] but but you know you can't make god open
[11:50] something if he doesn't open it and you
[11:52] can't get away of god's leading if god
[11:54] wants to go one direction no matter how
[11:56] much you want to go another direction
[11:57] you can't go another direction it's
[11:59] impossible
[12:00] and and so here we are god wants us to
[12:03] glean all that we can out of this time
[12:05] and learn all that we can from the
[12:06] circumstances we're in and so we're
[12:08] going to talk some about those things
[12:10] but but let's look at this scripture
[12:12] again in first corinthians chapter 3
[12:16] and verse 18.
[12:19] let not man
[12:21] let no man deceive himself if any man
[12:23] among you seemeth to be wise in this
[12:25] world let him become a fool that he may
[12:27] be wise
[12:29] for the wisdom of this world is
[12:30] foolishness with god for it is written
[12:32] he taketh the wise in their own
[12:34] craftiness
[12:36] and again the lord knoweth the thoughts
[12:37] of the wise that they are vain
[12:40] so our goal in this life is not to have
[12:42] more worldly wisdom
[12:45] but you know everyone around us is
[12:47] moving in a different direction because
[12:49] the goal is more education and more
[12:51] knowledge and more wisdom and and you
[12:54] know to grow and increase in these
[12:56] things that are in this world but for us
[12:58] we have to deny the things that are in
[13:00] the world to seek after the wisdom that
[13:03] comes from god which is foolishness to
[13:05] this world
[13:06] so we have to if if we even consider
[13:09] ourselves to be wise we must become
[13:11] fools that we may be wise
[13:13] because the wisdom that we're seeking is
[13:15] not the wisdom is not what the world
[13:17] calls wisdom it's not what those in the
[13:20] world would look to his wisdom it looks
[13:21] to them like foolishness but to god it
[13:24] is the true wisdom
[13:26] because to god the wisdom of man is
[13:28] foolishness
[13:29] because god
[13:31] you know he's all-knowing and supreme in
[13:32] every way and the wisdom of man is
[13:34] trying to outpace god and trying to
[13:37] prove that there is no god or trying in
[13:40] their own foolishness to prove god but
[13:42] all they're doing is proving a god of
[13:43] their own thinking of their own
[13:44] understanding and god is watching the
[13:46] whole thing and to him it's absolute
[13:48] rubbish
[13:49] it's childish it's foolishness but man
[13:52] is thought he's achieved to such a
[13:53] pinnacle of wisdom he thinks that he's
[13:56] come to such a place it must be like the
[13:58] tower of babel you know where they they
[14:00] think they've come to such a wisdom such
[14:02] an achievement that somehow they can
[14:05] outsmart god that they can build a tower
[14:07] that will somehow uh give them a power
[14:10] and an ability to overcome the judgments
[14:12] of god
[14:14] and and god destroyed the whole thing
[14:17] and now we've come back in many ways by
[14:19] science to a tower of bible where where
[14:22] man believes that he can you know he can
[14:24] take care of himself and he can
[14:27] whatever obstacles you know if we pull
[14:29] our resources in the world we can
[14:30] overcome this thing but god's proving
[14:32] that the wisdom of man is foolishness
[14:35] man doesn't know he doesn't know what's
[14:37] happening tomorrow he doesn't know
[14:38] what's happening next week he doesn't
[14:40] know how to protect himself or save
[14:41] himself he doesn't know what he's doing
[14:43] and it becomes more apparent all of the
[14:46] time but the wise just think they're
[14:48] wise
[14:49] but to become a fool is my desire
[14:53] to become a fool for christ just to take
[14:55] him at his word
[14:58] you know
[14:59] we all got an education of some sort it
[15:02] was the law
[15:04] and
[15:05] that education brother branham tells us
[15:07] you need in this life
[15:10] he said you need he said i'm not i'm not
[15:12] promoting ignorance you need some sort
[15:13] of education and depending on your job
[15:15] depends on how much education you need
[15:17] to work your occupation to do your job
[15:20] and brother branham wasn't saying that
[15:22] that in itself was wrong but he's trying
[15:24] to get us to look and not to look at
[15:26] that and depend on that for anything
[15:28] eternal
[15:29] or anything in the kingdom of god
[15:30] because that means nothing in the
[15:32] eternal nothing to the kingdom of god
[15:34] that's just a temporary thing for a
[15:36] temporary life because we've come down
[15:38] to in this life and to do that we need
[15:41] certain things and a certain amount of
[15:43] education in a certain amount of
[15:44] training because he's accomplishing
[15:46] something through it all but the real
[15:48] thing that we need is not the education
[15:50] and the training for the job but the
[15:52] real thing we need is education and
[15:54] training in the word of god and how to
[15:56] stand on the word of god and the word
[15:58] only
[16:00] and so you know when i when i preach on
[16:02] this i've told myself over and over chad
[16:04] be careful
[16:05] because i don't want to push something
[16:07] too hard i don't want to get my own
[16:08] nature involved and that happens so many
[16:10] times i get my own thinking own nature
[16:12] and i push something too hard because i
[16:14] don't want this morning to push anything
[16:15] too hard i just want to share what's on
[16:17] my heart
[16:18] amen so so paul and i told one brother i
[16:21] said if you see me going too strong stop
[16:23] pooling
[16:26] amen
[16:28] because we're always susceptible of
[16:30] injecting ourselves and our own nature
[16:32] but i want to look at things the way god
[16:34] looks at them amen and i want to have
[16:35] god's perspective on things not my own
[16:38] and not the worlds and not anybody
[16:39] else's
[16:41] let's go to first corinthians chapter
[16:42] one and let's look at another scripture
[16:44] here
[16:49] don't exactly know where we're going to
[16:51] get to
[16:52] uh this has been unusual for me it's
[16:54] been a different kind of preparation
[16:57] but usually i like i have lots and lots
[17:00] of time and lots and lots of no's and
[17:03] usually i'm cutting out pages of notes
[17:06] and i think last night at 11 i had one
[17:08] quote
[17:11] yeah i'm preaching like an evangelist
[17:15] but you know
[17:16] it's because i i want to go somewhere
[17:18] else i want to talk about something else
[17:20] and god would give me no inspiration i
[17:22] labored all day for other inspiration
[17:24] but god this is all they gave me and
[17:25] this morning he just tied all these
[17:27] thoughts that have been random in my
[17:28] mind and he lined them up for me so i
[17:30] could see a vein so i just pray that you
[17:33] just relax in the spirit pull on the
[17:34] word of god and let's see what god has
[17:36] to share with us this morning first
[17:39] corinthians chapter 1
[17:41] verse 26
[17:44] for you see your calling brethren how
[17:46] that not many wise men after the flesh
[17:49] not many mighty not many noble are
[17:51] called
[17:52] but god has chosen the foolish things of
[17:54] the world to confound the wise and god
[17:57] has chosen the weak things of the world
[17:59] to confound the things which are mighty
[18:02] and the base things of the world and the
[18:04] things which are despised hath god
[18:06] chosen yea and things which are not
[18:09] to bring to not things that are
[18:12] that no flesh should glory in his
[18:14] presence but of him are you in christ
[18:17] jesus who of god has made unto us wisdom
[18:20] and righteousness and sanctification and
[18:22] redemption that according as it is
[18:24] written he that glorieth led him glory
[18:27] in the lord
[18:29] so
[18:30] you know this scripture is opposite of
[18:32] what the world is looking for
[18:35] brother bram said the world is looking
[18:36] for a superman
[18:37] they're looking for somebody that and
[18:39] brother bam said they're looking for a
[18:40] president that can outsmart russia you
[18:42] know they're looking for someone that
[18:44] can win the arms race or or
[18:46] or win the trade uh whatever the trade
[18:49] war and somebody that can bring a better
[18:50] economy and somebody that can outsmart
[18:53] or fix all these problems and and
[18:55] they're looking for a mighty man they're
[18:57] looking for a superhero they're looking
[18:58] for the super intelligent they're
[19:00] looking for the phds amen and every
[19:03] leader that they want you know man wants
[19:05] a leader who's strong and capable and
[19:08] and can overcome great obstacles that's
[19:10] the leader that the man's looking for
[19:12] and the church is the same way i mean
[19:14] they want their pastor to be
[19:15] good-looking and they want their pastor
[19:17] to be smart and they want their pastor
[19:19] to be witty and funny and and serious
[19:22] and all those other things and so i'm
[19:23] sorry to disappoint you
[19:26] in all of those areas
[19:29] but god's not taking that kind to
[19:31] display his word god is taking the base
[19:34] things of the world god is taking the
[19:36] humble he's taking the weak amen because
[19:38] god wants to be the only one who gets
[19:40] glory that all our glory will be in him
[19:43] because we realize our frailty our
[19:45] weakness we're not capable of doing
[19:47] these things we're not capable of doing
[19:48] what he asked us to do we're not capable
[19:51] of of being wise enough to navigate
[19:53] through this world and i think as things
[19:55] have changed for us in the last several
[19:57] weeks we've come to the realization that
[19:59] i don't have the wisdom to figure out
[20:01] what's happening
[20:03] i don't have the wisdom to figure out
[20:04] what's happening i have no idea what's
[20:06] happening next you know the governor
[20:08] made a statement that maybe they'll
[20:10] start rolling back things may 1st i have
[20:12] no idea what's going to happen may 1st
[20:15] he doesn't have an idea what's going to
[20:17] happen may 1st
[20:18] and so we realized that god is weakening
[20:22] everything and and one of the places
[20:24] that he's weakening is he's weakening us
[20:28] he's weakening us in our own uh uh our
[20:31] own wisdom our own uh knowledge our own
[20:34] ability to figure something out because
[20:36] we realize we haven't figured anything
[20:37] out correct yet
[20:39] we've guessed and probed and maybe got
[20:41] close and maybe been far off and all
[20:43] these things but we realize when god
[20:45] does something he does it it's sure it's
[20:46] solid amen and he doesn't do it
[20:48] according to our understanding and so
[20:50] he's weakening us in our own
[20:53] intelligence
[20:55] he's weakening us in our own wisdom amen
[20:58] because that's the thing that he wants
[21:00] to use he wants to use things that are
[21:02] not to bring to not things that are
[21:06] god is not looking for a superhuman
[21:10] to accomplish his goals when he came
[21:12] himself amen he had no form or
[21:14] comingness that we should adore him that
[21:16] we should want him and then he was
[21:18] despised and rejected brother bannon
[21:20] said he was stoop shouldered and a small
[21:22] man
[21:24] right he didn't come as a hulk he
[21:25] doesn't come as a military mind he
[21:28] become meek
[21:29] and lowly
[21:31] i mean that's what god that's what god's
[21:33] wanting that's what god's doing so he'll
[21:36] take us in all of our wisdom and ability
[21:38] and he'll pull the rug out from under us
[21:40] and that's a good thing
[21:42] he'll flatten us and he'll say hey you
[21:45] know don't worry just follow me it'll be
[21:47] all right amen you don't have to have
[21:49] anything figured out you don't have to
[21:51] be smart you don't have to be wise amen
[21:54] you don't have to be able to predict the
[21:56] future you don't have to have an angle
[21:59] you know we don't have to have an angle
[22:01] we don't have to know what's coming next
[22:04] that's not what god needs god needs
[22:06] somebody who knows they don't know
[22:10] he has somebody who's been abased
[22:13] and knows that they don't know anything
[22:15] he had to take an apostle paul until
[22:18] apostle paul said all of these things my
[22:20] resume i count as done
[22:23] i had a nice resume and it accomplished
[22:25] lot in the religion of the jews because
[22:27] they like a nice resume
[22:29] the jewish religion they liked the
[22:31] pedigree and they they liked
[22:32] accomplishment and they liked the zeal
[22:34] and they liked that he come from the
[22:36] school of gamaliel and they they liked
[22:38] the uh that he was you know
[22:40] a jew by birth of the tribe of benjamin
[22:42] a pharisee by faith zealous for the word
[22:45] of god my he was ticking every box amen
[22:48] for the jewish leaders and they got paul
[22:50] he was the up and coming amen but god
[22:53] wanted paul for his own purpose but he
[22:55] didn't want paul that way
[22:58] so god flattened paul amen and paul
[23:01] realized everything i knew i didn't
[23:04] really know correctly amen everything i
[23:06] thought i knew i found out i was wrong
[23:08] and he abased paul amen he blinded him
[23:11] because paul thought he could see
[23:13] [Music]
[23:14] so he blinded him so he could realize he
[23:16] was a blind man
[23:18] and that he would need one of these
[23:20] saints that he was running to persecute
[23:22] one of these that he hated one of these
[23:24] that he called a heretic and an ignorant
[23:27] you know who knows who knows what paul
[23:29] would have called these christians
[23:31] what names he would have used about
[23:33] their heretics and
[23:35] this new you know this new faith and and
[23:38] that they're leaving the faith and we
[23:40] got to defend the faith who knows what
[23:42] they would say but now he got paul in
[23:44] the condition where paul was going to
[23:46] need one of these people he was
[23:48] persecuting and hating to come and lay
[23:50] hands on him so that he could see
[23:55] why because that's what god wants he
[23:56] wants something humble and abased and
[23:59] will forget everything they knew
[24:02] moses was trained in all the military
[24:04] might and wisdom of the egyptians
[24:06] brother bam said he could teach the
[24:07] egyptians
[24:09] raised with the best tutors and the best
[24:11] education in pharaoh's house but that's
[24:13] not the way god wanted moses he just
[24:14] wanted moses but he didn't want moses
[24:16] education and he didn't want moses's
[24:18] wisdom he didn't want moses ability he
[24:20] just wanted moses
[24:22] he just wanted paul and he didn't want
[24:24] paul with all the scholarly achievements
[24:26] he wanted paul
[24:28] and when he got paul to where he wanted
[24:29] paul says i count everything before i
[24:32] count it is done
[24:34] i give it up
[24:36] i lose it all
[24:37] that i might no know him
[24:39] and then god had
[24:41] a paul that he could use and guess what
[24:43] all those characteristics that made paul
[24:45] what he was
[24:46] were the characteristics god still
[24:48] wanted to use
[24:51] but he wanted it humble and he wanted it
[24:52] based he wanted his own way
[24:55] so god had chosen the foolish things of
[24:57] this world to confound the wise
[25:01] because the wise can't figure it out
[25:04] because it's achieved by faith
[25:06] and there's no figuring out faith
[25:10] and god has chosen the weak things of
[25:12] the world to confound the things which
[25:14] are mighty
[25:17] in the base things of the world and the
[25:19] things which are despised hath god
[25:21] chosen yea and things which are not to
[25:24] bring to not things that are
[25:26] that no flesh should glory in his
[25:28] presence
[25:30] but of him
[25:31] are you in christ jesus who if god has
[25:34] made unto us
[25:35] wisdom and righteousness and
[25:37] sanctification and redemption
[25:40] where is our wisdom in him
[25:43] our righteousness is in him our
[25:45] sanctification is in him and our
[25:47] redemption is in him
[25:50] that according as it is written he hath
[25:52] he that glorieth led him glory in the
[25:55] lord let's turn to the book of acts and
[25:57] look at acts chapter 4.
[26:02] acts chapter 4 and verse 13.
[26:10] i was going to pull one little scripture
[26:12] out of a story here
[26:14] and not take time for the whole story
[26:15] but acts 4 13
[26:17] now when they saw the boldness of peter
[26:19] and john and perceived that they were
[26:20] unlearned and ignorant men
[26:22] they marveled
[26:25] why did they marvel
[26:27] because they were ignorant and unlearned
[26:31] but yet they were bold in the face of
[26:33] the council
[26:35] they would answer according to the
[26:36] scripture they would answer according to
[26:38] their faith they weren't intimidated
[26:40] they weren't backing down but yet they
[26:42] were ignorant and unlearned and and when
[26:44] they perceived that they were unlearned
[26:46] and ignorant men they marveled
[26:48] and they took knowledge of them that
[26:49] they had been with jesus
[26:51] why because they had no record of what
[26:53] school jesus came out of amen and they
[26:55] reckon him to be the same way ignorant
[26:57] and unlearned i mean where did this man
[27:00] learn letters
[27:01] where did he learn these things at 12
[27:03] years old he's disputing with them in
[27:05] the temple where did he learn those
[27:06] things what school did he go to what was
[27:08] his pedigree and jesus had none
[27:11] amen and so now when he comes up with
[27:13] two more amen they begin to act like
[27:15] jesus they're the base things of the
[27:17] world these are
[27:18] fishermen
[27:20] god chose if you look at god's choosing
[27:23] god when he begins to choose for his
[27:25] disciples he goes and chooses men who
[27:27] are washing out their nets after a day's
[27:29] catch
[27:30] i mean this is not these are not the
[27:32] allies that you would choose if you were
[27:34] starting a new political move
[27:36] and if you wanted to start a new
[27:38] denomination these are not the guys to
[27:40] pick
[27:41] but jesus is not interested in a
[27:42] political move he is not interested in a
[27:45] denomination he is interested in the
[27:48] word amen he's interested in
[27:49] accomplishing the word of god amen and
[27:52] god and god doesn't need wisdom your
[27:55] wisdom he doesn't need your strength he
[27:56] doesn't need your ability he just needs
[27:59] you as a weak broken humble base vessel
[28:02] so that anything that's accomplished the
[28:04] credit all goes to him because when they
[28:06] looked at peter and john and they
[28:08] realized they were ignorant and
[28:09] unlearned they marveled they didn't
[28:10] marvel at john and and peter being wise
[28:14] and so smart they marvel that they're
[28:16] being unlearned they're able to answer
[28:19] this way in boldness amen and and
[28:21] confirming the word amen they marveled
[28:23] and they took note that they had been
[28:25] with jesus
[28:26] who was getting the credit
[28:29] what were they crediting with their
[28:30] boldness what were they crediting with
[28:32] their answers amen it wasn't those two
[28:35] guys because they knew they were
[28:36] ignorant and unlearned fishermen but
[28:38] they realized when they saw the boldness
[28:41] and they saw the answer and they saw the
[28:42] miracle they realized that they had been
[28:44] with jesus
[28:46] and if i if there's anything that i can
[28:49] accomplish in this life if they could
[28:50] just realize i've been with jesus
[28:53] because they i want them to look at me
[28:55] and say that man he's got nothing
[28:59] which is the truth i've got nothing
[29:03] i literally have nothing
[29:06] i have no big bank account i have no
[29:08] extra funds amen if if my paycheck went
[29:11] away tomorrow i've got about three four
[29:14] weeks
[29:15] and i'm done
[29:18] amen
[29:19] i don't have
[29:21] i don't have anything
[29:23] no super wisdom no super powers no super
[29:26] intelligence no formal education i
[29:28] barely got out of high school and i
[29:30] graduated because i went to vocational
[29:32] school
[29:34] because i was bored in school i hated it
[29:37] so i went to vocational school just
[29:39] because at least you get to do stuff you
[29:41] know
[29:43] and you know and vocational school
[29:44] wasn't a high level of education for me
[29:47] because all i was learning to do was
[29:48] electrocute people and blow stuff up
[29:53] and so
[29:54] i didn't get you know the best education
[30:00] but god wasn't interested in that
[30:05] like many of
[30:06] you i come from broken home
[30:10] from family
[30:12] situations that were not pleasant from
[30:14] disasters
[30:17] come from raised in denomination raised
[30:19] in independent pentecostal churches and
[30:21] assembly of god pentecostal churches
[30:23] raised all of these ways i had no
[30:25] understanding i thought i knew something
[30:27] but i realized when first time i got a
[30:28] hold of a message book that i didn't
[30:29] know nothing
[30:31] and when i i got a concordance my wife
[30:34] bought me a concordance because i
[30:35] thought man i'm the smartest guy in town
[30:37] i have a concordance
[30:39] and i could look up any word in the
[30:41] bible
[30:42] and i could read every every scripture
[30:44] where this word is used and i was a
[30:46] smart duck until brother jeremy came
[30:48] along and he gave me a church ages book
[30:50] and i realized that concordance that i
[30:52] thought made me smart that concordance
[30:54] unraveled with the church age book in
[30:56] that concordance and unraveled
[30:58] everything that i'd been taught all my
[30:59] life
[31:01] so there's no heritage there's there's
[31:03] no
[31:04] heritage in the message there's no
[31:06] knowing things the right way or learning
[31:08] them the right way or pedigreed or
[31:10] education or understanding or any super
[31:13] ability because that's what god's
[31:15] looking for
[31:16] that's what he wants he wants the
[31:18] handicap
[31:21] he needed the halt lame and blind
[31:24] to show that he was fulfilling the word
[31:25] and that he was the messiah
[31:28] he needed the fishermen who were
[31:30] ignorant and unlearned brother branham
[31:32] said peter couldn't sign his own name
[31:35] ignorant and unlearned and that's what
[31:37] god was looking for then when he when he
[31:40] got somebody with a little bit of
[31:41] education he chose a tax collector to
[31:43] make sure he was hated and despised
[31:48] god's choice
[31:51] what's god looking for he's not looking
[31:53] for fineries he's not looking for wisdom
[31:55] he's not looking for power he's not
[31:57] looking for strength he's looking for a
[31:59] vessel that he can use a predestinated
[32:02] ordained vessel and that predestinated
[32:04] ordained vessel he has to get it in a
[32:06] condition where it has no dependency on
[32:09] itself so that it can be utterly
[32:11] dependent on him and when it can be
[32:12] utterly dependent on him then he can
[32:15] accomplish his purpose
[32:17] so when god abases it's a good thing
[32:20] and when god amen you say how could god
[32:23] choose me how could he not choose you
[32:25] i've had people tell me before i've had
[32:27] such a terrible life if you knew the
[32:29] things i've done if you knew the things
[32:31] i've been through if you knew the sin in
[32:33] my life and blah blah blah blah blah and
[32:35] i'm just thinking perfect
[32:38] how's this different than anybody in the
[32:40] scriptures
[32:41] you know so many times people struggle
[32:43] but my situation but my marriage but my
[32:46] family but but my parents but my
[32:49] but but that's perfect you realize
[32:52] god wants things that are broken
[32:55] so when they're fixed he gets the glory
[32:59] and so don't ever don't ever downplay
[33:02] what god doing how could it be me or why
[33:03] did he choose me or or why hey if you
[33:06] feel like you're unworthy to be one of
[33:08] them then praise god you're probably one
[33:11] of them
[33:12] at least you're getting close to where
[33:14] god wants us to be
[33:16] brother madam says in things that are to
[33:18] be from december of 1965 it's now in
[33:21] this world that we live in this
[33:23] education
[33:24] i want to prove to you education science
[33:27] civilization and all these things that
[33:29] we seemingly so enjoy today is of satan
[33:33] and will perish
[33:36] i'm going to say this clear because
[33:37] brother branham said it clear
[33:39] and and and not mince words
[33:44] but
[33:46] but
[33:47] education
[33:48] science
[33:49] civilization and all these things that
[33:51] we seemingly so enjoy today is of satan
[33:57] now i say it but i also want to include
[33:59] brother remember said now we need an
[34:00] education to live in this life
[34:02] and products that science have produced
[34:04] we use
[34:05] i mean we use cell phones
[34:08] we drive a car
[34:09] brother bam said man in this wisdom
[34:11] intelligence made a car he kills more
[34:12] people with the automobile
[34:16] right
[34:17] because whatever man does has an element
[34:18] of death attached to it
[34:20] it's never perfect he said he made
[34:21] penicillin and that was a great thing
[34:22] for mankind and brother branham said it
[34:24] was a great thing
[34:25] but sometimes the penicillin kills
[34:28] because man cannot get anything
[34:30] perfectly right
[34:31] everything he does has an element of
[34:33] death attached to it
[34:34] but yet we'll take the penicillin
[34:38] we'll drive in the car brother ben said
[34:39] we need automobiles
[34:41] when jesus was here he rode a donkey
[34:44] he ate in an upper room slept in a house
[34:47] rode in a boat
[34:48] you understand we're in this life amen
[34:51] in the way this life is constructed god
[34:54] has ordained us to live in this life
[34:55] that means a certain element of
[34:57] education a certain element of science
[34:59] even some benefits to our physical body
[35:01] from science
[35:03] right brother branham had no problem
[35:04] taking medicine he did
[35:07] so it's it's not that we will throw all
[35:09] that away and become amish
[35:11] that's not the point so don't don't make
[35:13] me say something i'm not or brother bam
[35:15] say something he's not
[35:16] but what he's trying to get you to see
[35:18] is don't put any confidence in those
[35:20] things
[35:21] because that car that we love can kill
[35:23] you
[35:25] that tablet that can help you might kill
[35:27] you
[35:30] when you get in the car amen and you
[35:33] turn the key it's got to take an element
[35:35] of faith to know that god's going to
[35:36] keep me and get me to my destination
[35:39] safely it's not this car that's going to
[35:41] do it and it's not the airbag that they
[35:43] engineered but it's going to be god that
[35:45] gets me safely to my destination
[35:47] and if god has led me to some medical
[35:50] help and i have faith that god wants me
[35:52] to take this medication then i've got
[35:54] faith that god wants me to take this
[35:55] medication and faith is what's going to
[35:57] make it work
[36:00] because if we put too much faith in the
[36:02] airbag or too much faith in the medicine
[36:04] god is going to let that fail us at some
[36:06] point so you realize i can't put my
[36:09] faith in education science and man's
[36:11] achievement i can only put my faith in
[36:13] the word of god
[36:15] but yet we live in this life as
[36:17] creatures in this world because that's
[36:19] how he wants to be displayed he wants to
[36:21] be seen in your clothes in your car and
[36:24] in your house at your job that's how he
[36:27] wants to be displayed
[36:29] because that's how he was displayed when
[36:31] he was here and whatever the whatever
[36:33] was in the culture he was in the culture
[36:36] whatever was whatever technology was
[36:38] available he was using that technology
[36:41] we understand that
[36:43] but yet
[36:44] god when he was in christ he was not
[36:47] limited by that civilization or that
[36:49] technology
[36:52] he used it but wasn't limited by it
[36:53] because he knew it had limits
[36:57] right
[36:59] when the boat would fail he could walk
[37:02] on the water
[37:05] when the when the bakery was not
[37:07] sufficient to feed 5 000
[37:10] he could multiply bread
[37:12] so although although he would send his
[37:16] treasurer
[37:17] into a town to buy food
[37:21] you understand
[37:23] he would send the treasure into the town
[37:24] to buy food what's he doing living a
[37:26] normal life living like everybody else
[37:28] we need a little money we'll take a
[37:30] little money and we go buy us a little
[37:32] food you go fetch the food and bring it
[37:34] back here well i talked to this woman at
[37:35] the well
[37:37] he would send judas to go give some
[37:38] money to the poor he sent judas after an
[37:40] errand he would send two to go make the
[37:42] upper room ready
[37:45] right
[37:46] he was living like a man amen like we're
[37:49] supposed to live but he was not bound by
[37:51] that technology he was not bound by that
[37:53] civilization any time that civilization
[37:56] would hinder the word of god he would
[37:58] just step over that science and
[38:00] education and civilization and
[38:01] accomplish what he had to accomplish for
[38:03] the word of god
[38:04] so my brother ben said we go out on the
[38:06] limb of knowledge of good and evil we go
[38:08] to the doctor but we go so far until
[38:09] they can't help us no more and we jump
[38:11] over to the tree of life because where
[38:13] man has limits god has no limits
[38:18] why i said i don't want to push this too
[38:19] hard in one way because we've got to
[38:20] understand we're creatures amen that
[38:23] we're supposed to live in this dimension
[38:25] in this time element to perform what god
[38:27] wants us to perform to accomplish what
[38:29] he wants accomplished and it's going to
[38:30] take a car
[38:34] it's going to take whatever means that
[38:36] god wants us to use
[38:38] but we should put no faith in those
[38:40] things
[38:41] we should have no confidence in them
[38:42] because every one of them are limited
[38:45] and they will all fail
[38:48] his education science civilization and
[38:50] all these things that we seemingly so
[38:52] enjoy today as of satan and will perish
[38:56] you say brother random civilization yes
[38:57] sir this civilization came by come by
[39:00] satan genesis 4 proves it cain's son
[39:02] sees started this civilization building
[39:04] cities and organs and so forth and
[39:06] civilization came by knowledge knowledge
[39:09] is what the devil sold eve in the garden
[39:11] of eden and that caused her to to cross
[39:14] her to cramp transgress god's
[39:15] commandment so there will be a
[39:17] civilization in the world that we're
[39:19] going to but it won't be this kind of
[39:21] civilization
[39:23] for in this civilization we have
[39:25] sickness sorrow lust death everything in
[39:27] this civilization wrong but in that
[39:29] civilization there will be none of these
[39:31] things we don't need science
[39:36] hallelujah
[39:38] science is the perversion of the
[39:40] original anyhow you split a molecule to
[39:43] split atoms and do so and so to blow you
[39:45] up you take gun powder bang this to kill
[39:47] something you take the car and take
[39:49] gasoline out of the earth and the
[39:50] materials out of there to loosen it up
[39:51] the fibers so it can blow up and go down
[39:54] the road at 90 miles per hour and kill
[39:55] somebody see oh so nervous squeeze and
[39:58] hurry up we got to push and taking oh
[40:01] see it's all of the devil
[40:04] the kingdom of god will not have
[40:06] automobiles airplanes or any scientific
[40:09] achievements
[40:10] oh hallelujah i don't know why that
[40:12] sounds so good to me but it must be i
[40:14] originate from some place like that
[40:16] because when i hear something like that
[40:18] it feels so good to me that's the place
[40:20] i want to be
[40:23] it won't have any education at all
[40:27] it'll be an education so supreme to this
[40:30] that this won't even be thought of see
[40:32] education civilization and all this
[40:35] comes from satan
[40:38] 1965 power of transformation
[40:41] now he had six thousand years to do it
[40:43] with his poison spray and how did he do
[40:46] it now this is the striking part and
[40:48] listen close now he did it by
[40:50] civilization
[40:51] which is only about six thousand years
[40:53] to make satan's eden how did he do it he
[40:55] did it by civilization
[40:57] now that sounds strange but that's what
[40:59] i'm going to make a statement here that
[41:01] will keep you guessing maybe for a few
[41:02] minutes i hope not but did you realize
[41:05] this no i'm not trying to support
[41:06] ignorance but did you know that
[41:08] civilization science education and the
[41:10] things that we cherish so great today is
[41:12] the very instrument of satan even
[41:15] civilization
[41:16] civilization never come by god
[41:18] civilization come by satan now i'll
[41:20] prove that to you by the word just in a
[41:22] few minutes
[41:23] civilization is not of god for let me
[41:26] show you in this civilization the more
[41:28] civilized we get as we work through
[41:29] science we are always killing ourselves
[41:33] and this civilization has built up to
[41:34] this pinnacle now and we got death in
[41:37] this civilization we got sin in this
[41:38] civilization we got sickness in this
[41:40] civilization that can't be of god
[41:45] so god in this great own great kingdom
[41:48] that is to come will have a civilization
[41:50] but it will not be anything like this it
[41:53] won't be by science it'll be a faith
[41:55] civilization by the word
[41:58] hallelujah it'll be a faith civilization
[42:01] by the word amen guess what we're
[42:04] already part of that kingdom
[42:06] do you believe you're already a citizen
[42:08] of that kingdom then we need to operate
[42:10] by faith in the word
[42:12] we need to operate according to the
[42:14] civilization we're going to and while
[42:16] we're in this civilization the greatest
[42:19] thing to us has got to be faith by the
[42:21] word
[42:23] that everything is conquered by faith
[42:26] everything is overcome by faith in the
[42:28] word of god that that science is not my
[42:32] uh
[42:33] science is not my savior the word is my
[42:35] savior
[42:36] the government is not my savior
[42:37] civilization is not my savior but the
[42:39] word of god jesus christ himself is my
[42:42] savior
[42:43] he is the strong tower that the
[42:44] righteous run into are safe not a
[42:46] civilization not a scientific
[42:48] achievement not a program none of that
[42:51] but the only thing that i run into and
[42:53] i'm safe is in jesus christ
[42:55] he is the strong tower he is the word he
[42:58] is the one with the feathers that i hide
[43:00] under it's him and him only
[43:04] we work in a realm in our physical and
[43:07] our physical attribute we work in a
[43:09] realm of science and education and
[43:11] civilization but we're not from this
[43:14] world
[43:15] we're from another world and that other
[43:16] world is a faith civilization this is a
[43:19] civilization based on unbelief it was
[43:22] founded on unbelief it's rooted in
[43:24] unbelief and it's expressing unbelief
[43:27] where we come from a civilization that's
[43:29] rooted in faith amen grounded in faith
[43:32] amen and faith in the word of god amen
[43:35] because in us is the word
[43:38] and the word made spirit and life is the
[43:40] kingdom
[43:42] so the kingdom of god is within us
[43:45] that's what we have to live by that's
[43:47] the set of rules we live by
[43:50] but that doesn't put us in communal
[43:51] living in montana
[43:53] on the backside of a desert puts us
[43:54] right here
[43:56] walking like the disciples were ignorant
[43:58] and unlearned but they took note they
[43:59] had been with jesus
[44:01] because they believed something
[44:04] that changed their whole life
[44:06] they believed something that gave them a
[44:07] different perspective on every situation
[44:09] that they now face where once they were
[44:11] intimidated and fearful afraid of the
[44:14] council afraid of the jews amen afraid
[44:16] to be taken captive amen and all the
[44:19] sudden when that seed quickened to life
[44:21] with the baptism of the holy ghost they
[44:23] ran out preaching the gospel amen no
[44:25] longer intimidated no longer afraid amen
[44:28] because faith was awakened
[44:31] they realized
[44:32] that they were citizens of this kingdom
[44:35] they have nothing to be afraid of
[44:38] they were arrested
[44:39] but they had nothing to be afraid of
[44:42] they were beaten
[44:43] but they had nothing to be afraid of
[44:45] they were killed
[44:47] but they had nothing to be afraid of
[44:50] you realize
[44:51] god allowed
[44:54] god allowed the governments of those
[44:56] days to take his apostles and nail them
[44:59] upside down on a cross
[45:02] and they had no power to resist it
[45:06] why because it was the will of god
[45:11] but yet inside of them
[45:14] was enough power
[45:16] to speak a world into existence and go
[45:18] live a private life on it
[45:21] but it was controlled by a law a law of
[45:23] faith and without a commandment they
[45:25] couldn't have faith to speak it into
[45:27] existence
[45:28] without god giving them permission they
[45:30] didn't have faith to move it into
[45:32] existence and so if god said you're
[45:34] going to be nailed to a cross then they
[45:36] were going to be nailed to a cross with
[45:38] enough power in them to change the whole
[45:40] circumstances jesus christ when he was
[45:42] spit on and beaten and mocked and nailed
[45:44] to a cross there was enough power in him
[45:46] and the power that created the whole
[45:48] world was resting in him enough power to
[45:50] change the whole circumstances but he
[45:52] wouldn't because it pleased the father
[45:53] to be here
[45:56] so you realize it's power under
[45:58] control it's got to be power under the
[46:01] control of god and that's what we're
[46:03] seeking in this civilization to operate
[46:05] by faith not intellect not reasoning not
[46:08] selfish desire not willfulness but that
[46:11] our lives are conducted and directed by
[46:13] faith
[46:14] the spirit of god moves and we respond
[46:18] let's look at galatians chapter
[46:26] 2. galatians chapter 2 and verse 20.
[46:36] this is paul
[46:38] the apostle paul after his conversion
[46:40] galatians 2 and 20.
[46:42] i am crucified with christ nevertheless
[46:44] i live
[46:45] yet not i but christ liveth in me
[46:48] and the life which i now live in the
[46:50] flesh
[46:51] i live by the faith of the son of god
[46:55] who loved me and gave himself for me
[46:57] paul was saying the life that i now live
[47:00] in the flesh
[47:02] this life where paul rides on a ship
[47:06] right where paul
[47:08] maybe uses a cart where paul writes
[47:11] letters where paul uses language where
[47:14] paul in this life he now lives in the
[47:16] flesh
[47:17] he lives by the faith of the son of god
[47:20] not in the son of god
[47:22] it's the same faith
[47:24] and the life that we live in the flesh
[47:26] we live by the faith of the son of god
[47:29] not faith in our civilization not faith
[47:31] in our government not faith in science
[47:33] but faith
[47:34] in god
[47:35] the faith
[47:37] of the son of god
[47:39] let's go to second corinthians 10.
[47:44] i just want to lay these in
[47:47] and then move on second corinthians 10
[47:50] and 4.
[47:52] for the weapon of our warfare are not
[47:54] carnal but mighty through god to the
[47:55] pulling down of strongholds
[47:57] casting down imaginations in every high
[47:59] thing that exalted itself against the
[48:01] knowledge of god
[48:03] and bringing into captivity every
[48:05] thought to the obedience of christ
[48:09] you realize
[48:11] this is what we have to do every day
[48:14] because every
[48:16] day
[48:18] we have to cast down imaginations
[48:21] in every high thing that exalted self
[48:23] against the knowledge of god
[48:26] because every message that we get every
[48:28] day is against the knowledge of god
[48:31] everything science and education and
[48:33] civilization pushes through your cell
[48:35] phone to you is contrary to faith in the
[48:37] word of god
[48:39] it's contrary amen to
[48:42] it's it's every high thing that exalted
[48:44] itself against the knowledge of god and
[48:46] bringing into captivity every thought to
[48:48] the obedience of christ do you realize
[48:50] that as you
[48:52] if you go to your cell phone and you
[48:53] watch the news you're going to have to
[48:55] apply this scripture
[48:57] because you're going to hear things that
[48:58] are contrary to the word of god
[49:00] you're going to hear things that are
[49:02] absolutely opposite of what told us in
[49:04] the word amen the news is going to tell
[49:06] you you're in danger the word's going to
[49:07] tell you you're safe
[49:09] the news is going to tell you to be
[49:11] afraid but but he's going to tell you
[49:13] fear not
[49:15] so we're going to have to as we watch
[49:17] the news and it's not that we don't read
[49:18] the news brother branham read the
[49:20] newspaper he listened to the radio
[49:22] it's not that we don't catch the news
[49:24] but we must have this scripture active
[49:27] in us all the time that these thoughts
[49:29] that are coming in where are they coming
[49:31] from science civilization education and
[49:34] it's of the devil
[49:36] trying to get in my mind a cloud to come
[49:39] into my mind to get me to drop my faith
[49:42] in the word of god and as i begin to
[49:44] drop my faith in the word of god the
[49:46] devil begins to push me into all kinds
[49:48] of circumstances where faith would ride
[49:50] over everyone now the waves begin
[49:52] cresting over the ship all because i
[49:55] haven't kept faith in the word the
[49:57] primary thing
[49:58] i spent too much time in social media
[50:01] too much time in the news too much time
[50:03] in these things and not enough time in
[50:05] the word of god
[50:07] and now i'm from a faith civilization
[50:09] going to a faith civilization living in
[50:11] the midst of an unbelieving civilization
[50:14] and i've got to be on guard all the time
[50:16] to bring every thought captive into the
[50:18] obedience of christ which is the word
[50:21] and so
[50:22] we realize that this is a battle every
[50:24] day
[50:26] we have to know where we're at we have
[50:28] to know who we are and not just
[50:30] duly walk through this life with our
[50:33] senses dulled not keenly aware what's
[50:35] going on
[50:38] the the media
[50:41] and now you know with this social media
[50:45] has the ability to influence the whole
[50:47] world in a way of thinking
[50:50] in a matter of hours or days
[50:54] they can put out some social media
[50:56] blurbs pass it through facebook twitter
[50:58] whatever
[51:00] in a few hours they can have hundreds or
[51:02] thousands of people gather in a capital
[51:05] in a capital city for a protest nobody
[51:08] mailed a letter
[51:10] they don't even send emails anymore it's
[51:12] too slow
[51:14] take their phone got an idea send out
[51:16] the idea if a few people pass it along
[51:18] in a matter of hours
[51:20] and a day or two they can get three or
[51:23] four thousand people to show up in
[51:25] lansing michigan
[51:26] to protest something
[51:28] you realize what power that is
[51:31] but that's not how we're supposed to
[51:33] live
[51:34] we're supposed to be influenced by the
[51:36] word of god and only by the word of god
[51:38] amen we're supposed to have faith faith
[51:40] is supposed to be the thing that moves
[51:42] us not doubt not unbelief not suspicion
[51:46] not hearsay amen not not not conspiracy
[51:50] theories none of those things should
[51:52] move us we should be moved by faith in
[51:54] the word of god
[51:55] and sometimes we get into a place and
[51:57] god allows us to come to a place where
[51:59] we don't know where to move next
[52:02] but we're of a faith civilization
[52:04] without the wisdom of the world because
[52:06] the wisdom of the world when you get
[52:08] into a place where you don't know where
[52:10] to go next they call a council they
[52:12] bring the wise men together they make a
[52:14] decision and they move forward but the
[52:16] children of god don't move that way the
[52:18] children of god when they get back to in
[52:20] the corner they don't know where to go
[52:21] they can't move without faith so they
[52:24] have to hold still
[52:26] because this isn't wisdom this isn't a
[52:27] figuring out god this isn't a figuring
[52:29] out my circumstances this is resting in
[52:32] the leadership of the holy ghost to lead
[52:34] me in the plan of god
[52:36] and if we're going to go by faith we've
[52:37] got to go all the way by faith
[52:40] because god will lead by faith and he'll
[52:42] lead us down a dead-end road
[52:45] seemingly
[52:47] but if we're going to go down there by
[52:48] faith then when we get to the end of
[52:50] that road we're going to have to sit
[52:51] there by faith until faith opens up
[52:53] another way
[52:56] you can't go down there by faith amen
[52:58] and get out by reasoning
[53:00] if you do you're going to miss the
[53:02] tremendous victory that's getting ready
[53:03] to take place you're going to miss the
[53:05] parting of the waters you're going to
[53:06] miss the moving amen the moving of god
[53:09] when we go when we're led by faith we've
[53:11] got to stay put by faith until faith
[53:14] opens up another way
[53:17] and many times god leads us in ways we
[53:20] didn't anticipate and we didn't expect
[53:22] and it wasn't the answer that we wanted
[53:26] but when god gives it god gives it
[53:29] brother kyle was preaching on
[53:31] uh wednesday
[53:33] you got armor got a sword
[53:36] got all the power of the word
[53:38] all power of heaven
[53:41] here to back you up
[53:45] is it true
[53:46] the fullness of the word is here with
[53:48] the full life
[53:49] of the holy ghost here to back it up to
[53:51] enforce your claims
[53:54] power like like unspeakable amounts of
[53:57] power is here with the bride do you
[53:58] believe that
[54:00] but it's power under control
[54:02] and when god says yeah you look good
[54:05] everything's on right you did a good job
[54:07] now go sit down
[54:10] my goodness that's not what you wanted
[54:11] to hear
[54:13] i wanted to hear speak to squirrels talk
[54:15] to the mountain i wanted to hear do this
[54:17] supernatural thing i i wanted to hear
[54:20] make custer's last stand make him shoot
[54:22] you in the pulpit
[54:25] you know that's the nature of man
[54:28] god
[54:29] god
[54:30] is going to break
[54:32] every idea that we have
[54:35] every thought about power
[54:37] and strength and ability
[54:40] and break it down
[54:42] do we say okay god i don't know what to
[54:44] do next
[54:45] i'm just waiting for you
[54:48] i don't know
[54:49] where to go
[54:51] yeah you've led me here
[54:53] i know you've led me here
[54:55] followed you here
[54:57] where do we step next
[54:59] i don't know
[55:01] then he opens up a way and you say no no
[55:03] that's not a good way
[55:06] it can't be that way
[55:10] but if we're going to go by faith we've
[55:11] got to go all the way by faith
[55:14] faith doesn't work according to wisdom
[55:16] god's wisdom is so much different than
[55:18] our wisdom god's ways are so much higher
[55:21] than our ways
[55:23] but he chooses the base the low
[55:25] the humble
[55:27] and he does great things
[55:29] brother branham says in the god of this
[55:31] evil age
[55:32] from uh
[55:34] august of 1965.
[55:37] so what would god call a people out of
[55:39] this evil age for
[55:41] this is a good question
[55:44] what would god call people of this evil
[55:45] age for his name
[55:47] the reason that it is is to try her his
[55:50] bride when she has made manifest been
[55:53] tried been proven proved to satan like
[55:55] it was at the beginning so shall it be
[55:57] at the end
[55:59] so why did god call a people out of this
[56:01] evil age
[56:02] to prove his bride
[56:04] a couple paragraphs later he says we
[56:06] find now this evil age is to prove to
[56:10] satan she is not like eve
[56:13] that she is not that type of a woman and
[56:15] she will be tried by his word the bride
[56:18] as adam's bride was tried by the word
[56:21] so god now is he's bringing the whole
[56:24] redemption story full circle now
[56:27] because he had an adam first adam and he
[56:30] had an last adam
[56:32] and he had a first woman of first even
[56:34] he's going to have a last eve
[56:36] and and then this first adam his bride
[56:40] she was living in a perfect world of
[56:42] righteousness
[56:44] everything perfect godly it was a faith
[56:47] civilization friends
[56:49] it was what we're going back to it was
[56:51] perfect in every way everything was in
[56:53] harmony it was a perfect peace it was a
[56:56] perfect innocency it was a perfect life
[56:59] everything was perfect and in the
[57:01] perfect world the serpent came in the
[57:03] devil through the serpent and begowed
[57:05] eve in god's perfection amen and
[57:07] deceived the woman and by that came the
[57:10] fall so god now is going to bring a full
[57:14] circle of redemption and now he's going
[57:17] to let satan produce his own eden
[57:20] and now we've got a message brother
[57:22] branham preached at the end of august of
[57:24] 1965 and called satan's eden and now
[57:27] when it comes to satan's eden everything
[57:29] has come to satan's perfection
[57:32] to where to where he can move the masses
[57:34] with his technology with his scientific
[57:37] achievements and his governments and his
[57:38] civilization and education he can
[57:41] control the whole world
[57:43] he's come to the peak of satan's eden to
[57:45] this evil age which is this age that we
[57:47] live in but this is the age god chose to
[57:50] call his bride amen his perfect image of
[57:53] a perfect bride come back to seed again
[57:56] why this age because he wants to prove
[57:58] to satan she's not like eve
[58:00] you could get even perfection but this
[58:02] one's going to come in your perfection
[58:05] and he's going to and you've defiled my
[58:07] perfection but this woman's coming to
[58:09] defile your perfection
[58:11] coming to destroy and disrupt your
[58:14] education in science and achievements
[58:17] and civilization and governments are all
[58:19] going to come to not he's going to take
[58:21] the things that are not of this world
[58:22] and bring to not the things that are
[58:25] and why did he bring a little humble
[58:27] bride made up of fishermen and farmers
[58:29] and mailmen and blah blah blah all of
[58:31] these things to bring it up because he's
[58:33] going to take nothing he's going to take
[58:35] the base he's going to take the rejected
[58:37] he's going to take the despise and he's
[58:39] going to overturn satan's eden with him
[58:42] because he's the only one that can get
[58:43] the glory and they're going to get a
[58:45] people who's not going to depend on
[58:46] science it's not going to depend on
[58:48] achievement god going to depend on the
[58:50] government
[58:54] praise god
[58:55] but they're going to depend on the word
[58:56] of god
[59:00] there's a quote
[59:02] out of the message and ensign from 1953.
[59:06] i'm going to read this quote because i
[59:07] find it very fascinating
[59:10] i said if i prayed for a thousand people
[59:13] and all of them died in the morning
[59:16] tomorrow night i could preach divine
[59:18] healing and pray for the sick just as
[59:19] easy as i can tonight
[59:22] because it's god's word and it can't
[59:23] fail
[59:26] that's a big statement
[59:30] it's god's word god has given it to us
[59:32] don't bypass it embrace it
[59:35] claim the promise say it's mine oh lord
[59:39] so brother bam says
[59:44] a thousand people before this he said if
[59:46] i pray preached salvation to a thousand
[59:48] people and they
[59:49] accepted their salvation by faith
[59:52] and they died and they come back from
[59:54] the dead and they told me brother
[59:55] branham quit preaching that amen because
[59:57] it's wrong there's nothing there he said
[59:59] i would still preach it because i
[1:00:00] believe it it's the word
[1:00:02] those are big statements
[1:00:05] then the next thing he says is if i
[1:00:06] prayed for a thousand people
[1:00:09] and all of them died in the morning
[1:00:12] tomorrow night i could preach divine
[1:00:14] healing and pray for the sick just as
[1:00:16] easy as i can tonight
[1:00:18] because it's god's word and it can't
[1:00:20] fail
[1:00:21] now
[1:00:22] this is this is where my mind goes my
[1:00:24] mind always goes funny places
[1:00:26] but as soon as i read that my mind goes
[1:00:29] what would the papers be like in the
[1:00:30] morning
[1:00:32] what would be on social media what would
[1:00:34] the news say
[1:00:36] what would the parking lot of that
[1:00:38] auditorium look like how many cameras
[1:00:40] and news stations would be there how
[1:00:42] many protesters would be at the end of
[1:00:44] the road
[1:00:47] let's bring it home to the reality you
[1:00:49] know
[1:00:50] because if if he prayed for a thousand
[1:00:52] people brother ben and prayed for a
[1:00:53] thousand people and in the morning they
[1:00:55] all died i guarantee the press would
[1:00:57] have something to say about it
[1:00:59] and the government may have an
[1:01:01] investigation that they open
[1:01:03] and the people that the social pressure
[1:01:06] would be intense
[1:01:08] but he said i could come back the next
[1:01:10] night and preach divine healing just as
[1:01:12] easy because the word of god and the
[1:01:13] word of god can't fail so brother
[1:01:15] branham knew where he stood if that
[1:01:17] happened to him he would come right back
[1:01:19] preaching the word of god the same way
[1:01:21] he preaches the night before
[1:01:23] now that wasn't the next place my mind
[1:01:24] went
[1:01:26] so who wants prayer card number one
[1:01:34] it's fine for brother branham to say
[1:01:36] that and to say amen
[1:01:39] but if you were there that next night
[1:01:42] would you be there early to get a prayer
[1:01:44] card
[1:01:45] would you hope and pray that you're the
[1:01:47] first person in the prayer line
[1:01:49] it's not just brother branham's faith
[1:01:51] that's at the test it's the faith of the
[1:01:52] people
[1:01:53] it's not just brother bran's faith
[1:01:55] that's on the line now it's yours
[1:01:57] hey brother brahm did his part he
[1:01:59] brought us a message he delivered the
[1:02:01] word he delivered it true and straight
[1:02:03] but now it's our turn to take it and
[1:02:05] believe what he said it's our turn to
[1:02:07] take it and stand upon it no matter what
[1:02:09] anybody says no matter what anybody
[1:02:11] thinks no matter what's happening all
[1:02:13] around us is to stand on it
[1:02:15] i say god help me help me help me help
[1:02:18] me
[1:02:20] to die
[1:02:23] to reasoning to die to unbelief that i
[1:02:25] would want to be in the prayer line the
[1:02:27] next day make me the kind of believer
[1:02:29] that if he was going to get back and
[1:02:31] preach it that i would be the first one
[1:02:33] in line that day that i would have been
[1:02:34] the first one at the church to come in
[1:02:36] and get my prayer card and march up
[1:02:38] there because he believes in divine
[1:02:40] healing i want to believe in divine
[1:02:41] healing
[1:02:43] he believed in the power of god to
[1:02:44] deliver i want to believe in the power
[1:02:46] of god to deliver you realize you've got
[1:02:48] to have faith under those conditions to
[1:02:50] get in the prayer line now you're not
[1:02:52] just depending on that man because what
[1:02:54] that man can do can fail
[1:02:59] now it's not the man anymore
[1:03:01] now it's your faith
[1:03:03] and it's the word of god
[1:03:05] the first thousand might went through
[1:03:07] trusting in the man because he's done it
[1:03:09] thousands of times
[1:03:11] he's prayed for the sick thousands of
[1:03:13] times we've heard thousands of
[1:03:14] testimonies that first thousand through
[1:03:16] that night might have been basing their
[1:03:18] faith on those testimonies
[1:03:21] might have been basing their faith on
[1:03:23] that man and his righteousness and his
[1:03:25] calling and his gift from god and his
[1:03:26] visitation of an angel they might have
[1:03:28] been able to go through the line with
[1:03:30] that kind of faith but the second night
[1:03:33] all of that's going to be different
[1:03:35] now the next time they come through the
[1:03:37] line they're going to have to come
[1:03:38] through the line believing the same word
[1:03:40] that he's standing preaching because it
[1:03:42] looked like everything he said and did
[1:03:44] had just failed
[1:03:48] praise be to god
[1:03:50] you think god won't test his children
[1:03:51] with things like that
[1:03:53] he certainly certainly certainly will
[1:03:59] god doesn't need to make things nice and
[1:04:00] pretty
[1:04:02] and comfortable and easy
[1:04:04] he can make them uncomfortable
[1:04:06] and he can make them difficult
[1:04:09] i'll ask another question
[1:04:12] if brother branham was preaching in this
[1:04:13] pulpit this morning
[1:04:16] where would the people be
[1:04:20] now i'm not talking about defying any
[1:04:22] laws because i don't think brother
[1:04:24] branham would right he never did
[1:04:27] when he went with a restricted visa he
[1:04:28] didn't preach
[1:04:30] when he had to take a yellow fever shot
[1:04:31] to travel he said that's what caesar
[1:04:33] requires
[1:04:34] he would do he would keep the law i'm
[1:04:36] not talking about the law
[1:04:38] put the law aside
[1:04:39] say there's no restrictions none
[1:04:41] whatsoever everything's open
[1:04:44] but we got the same kind of issues going
[1:04:45] on in the world
[1:04:48] if brother branham was preaching
[1:04:50] where would the sick people be
[1:04:56] i say this for a reason
[1:04:58] i don't like hypotheticals because it's
[1:05:00] not hypothetical brother brandon's not
[1:05:01] here god doesn't want him here it's a
[1:05:03] different day something different
[1:05:05] supposed to take place today so i'm not
[1:05:07] saying that we should repeat what
[1:05:08] brother branham did i not at all
[1:05:10] i'm just saying this for us to get us to
[1:05:12] think a little differently
[1:05:14] i want to think just a little bit
[1:05:16] differently
[1:05:20] where is our faith
[1:05:25] when brother branham was having healing
[1:05:27] lines
[1:05:28] you were standing in line patiently
[1:05:30] waiting for your turn to be prayed
[1:05:32] you could be standing behind a man with
[1:05:34] tuberculosis
[1:05:38] and the woman behind you could have a
[1:05:39] sick baby
[1:05:41] with a mysterious disease you don't know
[1:05:42] about
[1:05:44] but the people stood in line
[1:05:46] waiting to get prayed for because they
[1:05:48] believed that that man had a gift and
[1:05:50] that god was answering his prayer and
[1:05:52] that i could be healed
[1:05:57] when brother branham was preaching
[1:05:59] please don't misunderstand me because i
[1:06:01] don't think i have no desire to go
[1:06:04] against the requirements of the
[1:06:05] government none whatsoever and i don't
[1:06:06] think brother branham would and i'm not
[1:06:08] condemning anybody for anything i just
[1:06:11] want us to think
[1:06:13] when brother branham was in an
[1:06:14] auditorium
[1:06:16] there was every disease imaginable
[1:06:20] laying on cots out in front of him and
[1:06:22] out in the seats
[1:06:27] and there was no guarantee
[1:06:29] that you wouldn't get sick there
[1:06:34] there was no guarantee
[1:06:37] but there was something that god was
[1:06:38] doing that was compelling the people to
[1:06:40] come anyways
[1:06:45] now
[1:06:46] we don't have to go to an auditorium
[1:06:49] we don't have to have a prophet we don't
[1:06:51] have to have a prayer line
[1:06:53] that same presence is with his word now
[1:06:57] the same presence that was with that man
[1:06:59] on the platform is the same present
[1:07:01] that's with his word
[1:07:02] and if his word is in you the same
[1:07:04] presence is with you
[1:07:06] in your home when you go to work when
[1:07:09] you have to go out in public wherever
[1:07:11] you go that same presence is with you
[1:07:14] that same presence with that man and
[1:07:16] that man would get the asian flu
[1:07:18] and he'd get a headache and he'd have a
[1:07:20] stomach condition that would tear him up
[1:07:22] every seven years it didn't create
[1:07:23] perfect health for him
[1:07:25] it didn't create perfect health for his
[1:07:27] family
[1:07:29] do you understand
[1:07:30] it's not about perfect health it's not
[1:07:32] about no trials it's not about ever
[1:07:34] having to face sickness it's not about
[1:07:36] if that presence is there nothing bad
[1:07:38] will ever happen lots of bad things
[1:07:39] happen to brother branham he had a gun
[1:07:41] blow up in his face and almost take his
[1:07:42] eye out
[1:07:44] he talks about being sick all the time
[1:07:47] do you ever read the message
[1:07:51] but he still believed god
[1:07:53] he believed god to take care of him he
[1:07:55] believed god to deliver him he believed
[1:07:56] god to heal him he believed god to watch
[1:07:58] over him he believed god to move him he
[1:08:00] believed god
[1:08:02] and i want to believe god
[1:08:04] i want to believe god the same way that
[1:08:05] wherever i am in whatever situation i'm
[1:08:07] in amen not to be rebellious brother
[1:08:09] branham wasn't rebellious but i just
[1:08:11] want to have faith to believe god
[1:08:13] that he's going to take care of me that
[1:08:15] he'll deliver me that whatever happens
[1:08:17] to me he'll bring me through i just want
[1:08:19] to have faith in him
[1:08:22] not faith in science i'm not holding out
[1:08:25] for uh a a
[1:08:27] vaccination to fix everything christ has
[1:08:30] already fixed everything
[1:08:32] for the believer he's our portion
[1:08:35] he's our hiding place he's our deliverer
[1:08:38] don't let the situations change our
[1:08:40] faith in the word of god
[1:08:42] that doesn't mean that we're foolish it
[1:08:44] doesn't mean that we're that we're uh uh
[1:08:48] reckless or or hazardous in any way it
[1:08:50] just means we believe
[1:08:53] doesn't keep us from washing my hands i
[1:08:54] wash my hands because my hands get dirty
[1:08:57] i've washed them for years we wash them
[1:08:58] because that's what we do
[1:09:02] we use hand sanitizer because
[1:09:04] it
[1:09:04] works you know what i mean
[1:09:07] because we live in this life like we
[1:09:09] drive a car
[1:09:11] like we use a cell phone but you know
[1:09:14] we we we do things
[1:09:16] because of the life we live in
[1:09:18] if we're sick we don't go make other
[1:09:20] people sick
[1:09:23] we don't go around hugging everybody
[1:09:24] just to prove that they're not going to
[1:09:26] get it and then the next day they're all
[1:09:28] sick we're not here to prove anything
[1:09:29] we're just here to believe god
[1:09:31] just to believe him to take care of us
[1:09:33] wherever we are
[1:09:35] wherever we go and that his spirit will
[1:09:37] lead us lord if there's some place
[1:09:39] that's dangerous for the girl he'll
[1:09:40] check me in my spirit and i won't go
[1:09:43] to be led by the spirit of god by faith
[1:09:45] and if god says don't go there i won't
[1:09:47] go there regardless of what anybody
[1:09:48] thinks because god's in control that i'm
[1:09:50] led by faith not by fear amen not by
[1:09:54] science not by anything else but i'm
[1:09:55] ready by faith in the word of god and i
[1:09:57] know that i can hear the still small
[1:09:58] voice and when he says don't go there
[1:10:00] i'm not going to go there
[1:10:02] and when he says you're free then i'm
[1:10:04] free but i i don't i don't want to live
[1:10:07] my life afraid of something
[1:10:10] i don't want to live my life afraid of
[1:10:11] rejection afraid of persecution afraid
[1:10:14] of sickness afraid of injury i don't
[1:10:16] want to live my life afraid because i
[1:10:18] have a heavenly father who watches over
[1:10:20] me
[1:10:21] my steps are ordered he has ordained the
[1:10:23] way that i take he watches over me he he
[1:10:26] is he has he's already ordained me to
[1:10:28] accomplish certain things in this life
[1:10:30] and until his purpose is complete in me
[1:10:32] i'm not leaving this life
[1:10:34] we just want to believe the word of god
[1:10:36] so i used that hypothetical brother
[1:10:39] branham was here knowing that god
[1:10:40] doesn't want him to be here he doesn't
[1:10:41] want our faith in that that's not the
[1:10:43] day and age that we live in but i use
[1:10:44] that to get our thinking to be a little
[1:10:46] different
[1:10:47] because brother branham said you know
[1:10:48] he's in church in jeffersonville if
[1:10:50] you've been to the tabernacle it's not a
[1:10:51] big place
[1:10:53] and he says bring your sick and bring
[1:10:55] your afflicted call your friends bring
[1:10:56] them all in we're going to have prayer
[1:10:58] for the sick tomorrow night
[1:11:01] brother branham didn't tell the sick
[1:11:03] people to stay home
[1:11:07] you understand what i'm saying i'm not
[1:11:09] saying be rebellious
[1:11:10] i'm not saying fight against the
[1:11:12] governor's decree i don't believe we
[1:11:13] should i'm not saying that please don't
[1:11:15] make me say something i'm not
[1:11:17] but brother branham invited all the sick
[1:11:19] to come
[1:11:21] to be prayed for
[1:11:25] i don't want to have to protect myself
[1:11:29] i want him to be my protector
[1:11:32] i want to be led by a spirit
[1:11:35] i want to be sensitive i want to be
[1:11:37] thoughtful i want to be caring i want to
[1:11:40] care about people around me and i want
[1:11:42] to be sensitive and caring to those
[1:11:43] people i want to project divine love
[1:11:47] i don't want
[1:11:48] to take my faith
[1:11:51] and force somebody else into a
[1:11:52] comfortable position because of my faith
[1:11:55] i don't want to do that i have no desire
[1:11:56] to do that
[1:11:57] i don't want to push somebody beyond
[1:11:59] their faith because of my faith
[1:12:01] but i do want to live by faith
[1:12:04] i want to live more by faith than i've
[1:12:06] ever lived by faith and i don't want my
[1:12:08] faith to become an arrogant bold in your
[1:12:11] face insensitive unfeeling uncaring type
[1:12:14] of thing not at all and i don't want my
[1:12:15] faith to become a rebellious thing where
[1:12:17] i even fight against god's commandment
[1:12:19] to obey the authorities that are over us
[1:12:21] i don't want to do that either
[1:12:23] but i do want to live by faith
[1:12:26] i do want to believe the word of god
[1:12:29] i don't think we have to give up
[1:12:32] anything
[1:12:33] we can believe the word of god and still
[1:12:36] be sensitive and caring towards others
[1:12:39] around us
[1:12:40] be thoughtful and mindful of of their
[1:12:42] anxiety or their fear their worry or
[1:12:44] even their health i think we can be
[1:12:46] mindful and thoughtful and caring for
[1:12:47] those things
[1:12:49] but not out of fear
[1:12:52] no fear out of faith
[1:12:55] i want to believe the word of god
[1:12:58] but i want to act the way jesus did
[1:13:00] he wasn't
[1:13:02] arrogant he wasn't boastful
[1:13:06] he wasn't
[1:13:08] uh
[1:13:09] he wasn't insensitive or uncaring or
[1:13:11] unfeeling he was just led by the spirit
[1:13:13] of god he did what his father taught him
[1:13:15] to do
[1:13:16] and that's what i want to be and that's
[1:13:18] what i want to do
[1:13:21] i wouldn't want
[1:13:23] i wouldn't want
[1:13:25] if i heard
[1:13:28] if i heard brother branham was
[1:13:30] going to be over in such-and-such a city
[1:13:34] i wouldn't want all of a sudden my faith
[1:13:35] to go to the roof
[1:13:37] i don't think that's the day we live in
[1:13:40] i don't think that if we find out
[1:13:42] brother ben is having a healing campaign
[1:13:44] over here now don't think i wouldn't
[1:13:45] want to go watch
[1:13:47] hear him preach
[1:13:48] love and admire the gift and the man
[1:13:50] that's not what i'm saying
[1:13:52] i don't want all the sudden for me to go
[1:13:54] from no faith to having faith because
[1:13:55] he's in this city preaching
[1:13:58] i don't think that's what he's called
[1:13:59] his bride to in this day
[1:14:01] i think he wants us to have
[1:14:04] the faith of the son of god
[1:14:07] i think he's calling the bride to have a
[1:14:08] perfect faith
[1:14:10] in perfect submission to his perfect
[1:14:13] leadership
[1:14:14] and perfect faith in a perfect word
[1:14:16] he's not calling his bride to be
[1:14:18] insensitive and uncaring and mean but he
[1:14:20] is calling her to believe
[1:14:23] to believe to believe the word to
[1:14:25] believe in god
[1:14:26] and let god be her portion
[1:14:29] and her deliverer
[1:14:32] let's look at matthew 14.
[1:14:35] now you can see why when i want to
[1:14:36] preach this i don't want to push it too
[1:14:37] hard i want to go slow
[1:14:39] because you can push this too hard and
[1:14:42] you can wind up on the opposite side of
[1:14:43] where god is
[1:14:45] you can push something so hard that
[1:14:47] you're actually fighting against god
[1:14:52] i believe what kyle preached the other
[1:14:53] day was timely and correct that god
[1:14:57] gives you all the armor and gives you
[1:14:58] faith in that armor and tells you to sit
[1:15:00] still
[1:15:02] sit still and wait
[1:15:04] and do no harm i believe that
[1:15:06] but i believe sometimes sitting and
[1:15:08] waiting requires as much faith as moving
[1:15:10] in action
[1:15:12] i think sometimes to do nothing requires
[1:15:14] just as much faith to be in a bunch of
[1:15:16] action and doing a bunch of stuff
[1:15:19] i think sometimes it might require just
[1:15:21] as much faith
[1:15:22] to subject ourselves
[1:15:24] the ordinances
[1:15:26] and rules
[1:15:27] because god wants us to
[1:15:28] as it would to blow past all of them and
[1:15:30] just be bold and arrogant
[1:15:34] sometimes sitting still requires just as
[1:15:35] much faith as moving forward
[1:15:38] and i want to be sensitive enough to
[1:15:39] catch where he's at
[1:15:41] what's he going to what's he telling me
[1:15:43] not what do i want to do but what does
[1:15:45] he want me to do and i want to do it by
[1:15:47] faith
[1:15:50] you know we
[1:15:51] we're in complete compliance with what's
[1:15:54] been required for us as an exempt
[1:15:55] business because that's what we feel
[1:15:57] like the lord wants us to do and i'm
[1:15:58] happy to do that
[1:16:00] because that's what the lord wants
[1:16:02] and and i don't want to begrudge that or
[1:16:04] be angry about it or say horrible things
[1:16:06] about it because if that's what god
[1:16:08] wants that's what i want i want god to
[1:16:10] have his way
[1:16:12] but we're not doing this to protect
[1:16:14] ourselves
[1:16:15] because the word is our protection
[1:16:18] we're not doing it because we're afraid
[1:16:20] because he says don't be afraid
[1:16:23] but we're doing it out of obedience
[1:16:25] because he's asked us to be obedient
[1:16:27] so i want to have the right mental
[1:16:29] attitude about why we do what we do we
[1:16:31] do it because he's asked us to we do it
[1:16:33] because we're subject to the ordinances
[1:16:36] of the authorities that are over us
[1:16:38] and he hasn't told us to do different
[1:16:41] so this is an act of obedience but the
[1:16:44] act of obedience should never breed fear
[1:16:47] because the obedience to the rules is it
[1:16:50] it's obedience to god and shows our love
[1:16:52] for god
[1:16:54] but the word is our shield
[1:16:56] the word is our protector the word is
[1:16:58] our defender the word is our deliver
[1:17:00] it's always the word and part of the
[1:17:02] word is to obey the ordinances of the
[1:17:04] king and the governors
[1:17:06] that's still part of the word so it's
[1:17:07] our faith in the word is our obedience
[1:17:10] so
[1:17:11] more anything i just want to operate by
[1:17:13] faith
[1:17:14] not my own thinking i want him to cast
[1:17:17] down reasoning in every high thought in
[1:17:19] my own wisdom and my own desire and i
[1:17:21] just want to obey god
[1:17:23] but i sure want to believe him
[1:17:26] matthew 14.
[1:17:31] look at
[1:17:33] verse 22.
[1:17:38] and straightway jesus constrained his
[1:17:40] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[1:17:42] before him and to the other side while
[1:17:44] he sent the multitudes away
[1:17:46] we've been over this scripture so many
[1:17:48] times but i just can't get away from it
[1:17:50] and when he had sent the multitudes away
[1:17:52] he went up into a mountain apart to pray
[1:17:54] and when the evening was come he was
[1:17:56] there alone
[1:17:57] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[1:17:59] sea tossed with waves for the wind was
[1:18:02] contrary
[1:18:03] and in the fourth watch of the night
[1:18:04] jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[1:18:07] and when the disciples saw him walking
[1:18:09] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[1:18:11] is a spirit and they cried out for fear
[1:18:15] but straightway jesus spoken to them
[1:18:17] saying be of good cheer it is i
[1:18:19] be not afraid
[1:18:21] and peter answered him and said lord if
[1:18:23] it be thou bid me come unto thee on the
[1:18:25] water
[1:18:27] and he said come
[1:18:29] and when peter was come down out of the
[1:18:31] ship he walked on the water to go to
[1:18:33] jesus and when he saw the wind
[1:18:35] boisterous he was afraid and beginning
[1:18:37] to sink he cried saying lord save me and
[1:18:39] immediately jesus stretched forth his
[1:18:41] hand and caught him and said unto him oh
[1:18:44] thou of little faith wherefore this thou
[1:18:46] doubt
[1:18:47] and when they were coming to the ship
[1:18:48] the wind ceased and they that were in
[1:18:50] the ship came and worshiped him saying
[1:18:53] of a truth thou art the son of god and
[1:18:55] when they were gone over they came into
[1:18:56] the land of gnaserad
[1:18:59] i want to
[1:19:00] read out a quote here out of jehovah
[1:19:01] jireh
[1:19:02] part 3 from 1964
[1:19:05] today people are something on the order
[1:19:06] like
[1:19:07] they was in the days when the disciples
[1:19:09] was out on the ocean
[1:19:10] and one night a storm came up and there
[1:19:12] was nothing all hopes was gone that they
[1:19:15] would ever be saved and they seen him
[1:19:16] coming walking on the water now the ship
[1:19:18] was waterlogged and the sails was broken
[1:19:20] the oars was gone they were holding one
[1:19:23] another screaming and they looked out
[1:19:25] there and seen him coming walking on the
[1:19:26] water and was scared of him their only
[1:19:29] hope and they were afraid of the only
[1:19:31] thing that could save them
[1:19:35] if that ain't a true picture today again
[1:19:38] they thought it looked spooky you know
[1:19:40] they said they cried out for fear it was
[1:19:42] a spirit it looked like
[1:19:44] too like spiritual that's the same thing
[1:19:47] it is today
[1:19:48] but if you'll just do like they did when
[1:19:50] they cried out they heard that voice
[1:19:52] coming fear not it is i be not afraid be
[1:19:55] of good courage
[1:19:56] and if you'll just watch the word of
[1:19:58] promise for this day you'll hear that
[1:20:00] same voice speaking through the word
[1:20:02] it's me i promise to do this in this
[1:20:04] last day fear not don't be scared put
[1:20:07] your trust in me the son of god who he
[1:20:09] is believe it now
[1:20:12] hey
[1:20:12] we've been in a storm tossed about but
[1:20:15] this word of god has come amen in this
[1:20:17] revelation of this hour is christ come
[1:20:20] walking on the water
[1:20:22] it's him and it looked scary to many of
[1:20:24] them they didn't understand it at first
[1:20:26] it looked a bit spooky it looked a
[1:20:28] little bit too spiritual amen but as
[1:20:30] they were fearful he said it is i be of
[1:20:32] good cheer it is i be not afraid
[1:20:37] and so many times we get into a
[1:20:39] situation god knew they were going to
[1:20:40] get in that situation
[1:20:42] he sent them in the boat he sent them
[1:20:44] out and he went up under the mountain
[1:20:45] and brother branham said he went up to
[1:20:46] the mountain to pray and was watching
[1:20:48] over them they were never out of his
[1:20:49] eyesight they were never out of his
[1:20:51] foreknowledge they were never beyond his
[1:20:53] reach
[1:20:55] but he let them get in that situation
[1:20:57] why because he wanted to come in the
[1:20:59] midst of the storm walking on the water
[1:21:01] and he wanted to be their deliverer when
[1:21:03] there could be no other deliverer you
[1:21:04] realize these were fishermen who lived
[1:21:06] their life on the sea and there was no
[1:21:08] hope for them to deliver themselves
[1:21:10] their only hope for deliverance was this
[1:21:12] one who came in an unorthodox way
[1:21:16] he came in a way that that had never he
[1:21:18] did something that had never been done
[1:21:20] before
[1:21:22] you realize jesus christ and his
[1:21:24] ministry love to break religion apart he
[1:21:28] loved to break traditions apart he would
[1:21:31] often do things in a way that had never
[1:21:33] been done before and they couldn't
[1:21:34] accept it because they'd never seen it
[1:21:36] before
[1:21:37] and now their deliverance come walking
[1:21:39] on the water in a super unexpected way
[1:21:42] oh friends let him work in the unusual
[1:21:45] let him do what's never been done before
[1:21:48] let him do something in a way that
[1:21:49] that's totally different than what we've
[1:21:51] ever seen him deliver before and when he
[1:21:53] comes walking on the water don't be
[1:21:55] afraid amen let him speak to your heart
[1:21:57] be of good cheer it is i be not afraid
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:02] don't be afraid of his deliverance just
[1:22:04] because it's weird
[1:22:06] just because it's different just because
[1:22:08] the circumstances are unusual amen if
[1:22:10] you would have not accepted the unusual
[1:22:12] you could have not accepted jesus
[1:22:13] ministry
[1:22:15] and if you don't accept the unusual you
[1:22:17] cannot accept brother branham's ministry
[1:22:20] because it was unusual it was different
[1:22:22] he was breaking the traditions of the
[1:22:24] day brother brother
[1:22:25] the lord jesus christ was breaking the
[1:22:27] traditions of the day
[1:22:30] but peter
[1:22:31] when he heard those words
[1:22:33] be of good cheer it is i
[1:22:35] be not afraid
[1:22:37] peter there's something in peter that is
[1:22:40] marvelous
[1:22:42] peter said lord if it's you
[1:22:44] bidding me come
[1:22:48] if it's you bid me come
[1:22:50] and jesus says come
[1:22:54] see peter when he saw the deliverance he
[1:22:57] was afraid like everybody else was
[1:22:58] afraid but when he heard the voice of
[1:22:59] the lord
[1:23:01] peter wanted to be wherever the lord was
[1:23:04] you can find that all the way through
[1:23:06] peter wanted to be with the lord
[1:23:08] and peter had such a desire to be with
[1:23:10] the lord he would chance getting out of
[1:23:13] the boat
[1:23:15] he would take a chance and he said lord
[1:23:18] if that you bid me come and he said come
[1:23:21] and peter climbed down out of the boat
[1:23:23] and began to walk upon the water
[1:23:28] what what was the motivation i don't
[1:23:30] know the bible doesn't say but he wanted
[1:23:32] to come to the lord
[1:23:34] i just take it as his motivation he
[1:23:36] wanted to come to the lord
[1:23:38] and how many want to come to the lord
[1:23:40] in the midst of the trial want to get to
[1:23:42] the lord amen it may be a scary way
[1:23:46] to get to him might be a frightening
[1:23:48] walk it might be a walk we've never
[1:23:50] walked before
[1:23:52] but but we asked him
[1:23:54] can i come
[1:23:56] peter didn't just climb out of the boat
[1:23:58] he had permission to come
[1:24:01] remember this power is under control and
[1:24:04] it's by permission
[1:24:05] every time brother branham manifest the
[1:24:07] manifestation of the spoken word it was
[1:24:09] by permission
[1:24:12] so he said can i come he says come he
[1:24:14] climbed down the boat and he began to
[1:24:16] walk upon the water to go towards the
[1:24:18] lord he was doing what nobody besides
[1:24:20] the lord himself had ever done before
[1:24:23] and as he's walking upon the water all
[1:24:25] of a sudden he begins to look at the
[1:24:27] circumstances around him and when he
[1:24:29] looks at the circumstances he begins to
[1:24:31] begin afraid when he becomes afraid he
[1:24:34] begins to sink and when he sinks he
[1:24:36] cries out to the lord lord save me and
[1:24:38] the lord reaches down and pulls him up
[1:24:39] and rebukes him for not believing
[1:24:44] pulls him up and he says oh thou little
[1:24:46] faith
[1:24:47] wherefore didst thou doubt
[1:24:49] i'll tell you why he doubted because he
[1:24:51] was standing in the middle of a storm
[1:24:53] standing on water that nobody had stood
[1:24:55] on before watching the storm and the
[1:24:57] waves
[1:24:58] blow and and the waves crush over him
[1:25:01] that's why he doubted
[1:25:04] what would you do if you were there
[1:25:07] right
[1:25:08] he doubted because of the human nature
[1:25:12] but what was in him that made him want
[1:25:14] to get to the lord what was in him that
[1:25:16] made him walk on the water it was faith
[1:25:18] amen and the enemy to faith was doubt
[1:25:20] when he began to look at the
[1:25:21] circumstances and begin to see but he
[1:25:23] cried to the lord and the lord rescued
[1:25:25] him and brought him to the shed
[1:25:27] now there was other disciples in the
[1:25:29] ship
[1:25:31] and none of them asked to come out
[1:25:36] you say well they wanted to take the
[1:25:37] safe road that ship wasn't safe
[1:25:41] that wasn't the safe place to be
[1:25:44] where is the safe place to be in the
[1:25:46] trial wherever the lord is
[1:25:48] peter had more sense than the rest of
[1:25:50] them but when peter got out trying to
[1:25:52] exercise his faith and trying to get to
[1:25:54] the lord he failed as a man and he sunk
[1:25:57] in the water and god had to rescue him
[1:25:59] and rebuke him amen and when he went
[1:26:00] back to that boat and maybe he went back
[1:26:02] to that boat seemingly a failure but i
[1:26:05] want to say this i would rather be peter
[1:26:07] than everybody else that stayed in the
[1:26:08] boat
[1:26:10] i would rather i would rather take a
[1:26:12] chance to get to the lord than try to
[1:26:14] stay in a boat that's not going to
[1:26:15] survive anyways and without the presence
[1:26:18] of the lord that boat's not going to
[1:26:20] make it that boat was flawed it was
[1:26:22] failing amen they had no more hope in it
[1:26:24] brother branham says amen and they
[1:26:26] stayed with the sinking vessel
[1:26:29] rather than ask the lord if i can come
[1:26:31] to him
[1:26:33] peter was of a different nature he was
[1:26:34] willing to leave the
[1:26:36] the known
[1:26:38] to step into the unknown
[1:26:40] he was willing to leave his comfort
[1:26:42] because his comfort as a fisherman had
[1:26:44] been his boat all his life
[1:26:46] since the time he was a child he had
[1:26:48] been in a boat and he wanted to get out
[1:26:51] of that boat and get to wherever the
[1:26:52] lord was
[1:26:56] god is breaking every traditional idea
[1:27:00] we've ever had
[1:27:01] [Music]
[1:27:02] he's breaking church gatherings in most
[1:27:04] places in the world he's breaking up our
[1:27:06] he's breaking apart so many things he's
[1:27:08] bringing forward every traditional idea
[1:27:10] we had
[1:27:12] and the question is do we want to stay
[1:27:14] in the thing that's failing
[1:27:17] or do we want to take a chance
[1:27:20] and maybe fail
[1:27:22] and maybe have the lord come and rescue
[1:27:25] us
[1:27:27] are we willing to take a chance to get
[1:27:29] out of the familiar
[1:27:31] because it's not going to work
[1:27:33] it's not going to work
[1:27:35] what worked all their lives as fishermen
[1:27:37] wasn't working anymore
[1:27:39] friends there's coming a time very soon
[1:27:41] what's worked for all of our lives won't
[1:27:42] work anymore
[1:27:44] it's not going to work there's going to
[1:27:46] come a time that we've got to be willing
[1:27:47] to get out of the boat when he says he
[1:27:49] says it's me this is me and you say can
[1:27:51] i come
[1:27:54] can i come and wait for him to say yes
[1:27:58] see this is a walk of obedience what if
[1:28:00] jesus had said no peter better stay in
[1:28:02] the boats
[1:28:04] i want to have enough faith to stay in
[1:28:06] the boat
[1:28:07] or get out
[1:28:09] whatever the lord says do
[1:28:11] i want to get to a place where i have
[1:28:12] such leadership of the holy ghost and
[1:28:14] such faith in the lord that when i see
[1:28:16] something no matter how odd it is no
[1:28:18] matter how unusual no matter it's the
[1:28:20] first time i've ever seen this before
[1:28:22] amen but if if it's him and i ask to
[1:28:24] come and he says come i want to come
[1:28:26] if i ask to come and he says stay i want
[1:28:28] to stay i want to have that much faith
[1:28:30] to do what he tells me to do
[1:28:32] i want to be obedient more than anything
[1:28:34] else in my life i've come to the place
[1:28:36] more than anything i want to be obedient
[1:28:38] i don't want to look good i don't want
[1:28:39] to look smart i i don't care if the
[1:28:42] whole world thinks this or thinks that
[1:28:44] things are ignorant and unlearned it
[1:28:46] doesn't matter i just want to be
[1:28:48] obedient
[1:28:49] i just want to be wherever he is
[1:28:53] wherever he is in the storm that's where
[1:28:54] i want to be and if he's moving on the
[1:28:57] water i want to say can i come to you if
[1:28:58] he says no i want to stay but if he says
[1:29:01] yes i want to climb down out of the boat
[1:29:03] and risk looking like a fool in front of
[1:29:06] everybody else
[1:29:08] risk failure risk drowning
[1:29:12] but i'd rather be on that water than in
[1:29:14] that boat
[1:29:19] god's moving us
[1:29:21] it's moving us
[1:29:24] he's we're losing faith in things that
[1:29:26] we used to have faith in
[1:29:30] we're losing confidence in things that
[1:29:32] we used to put confidence in and we may
[1:29:33] not have realized how much confidence we
[1:29:35] put
[1:29:36] in some of these things but god's going
[1:29:38] to let him fail
[1:29:41] and maybe especially for his bride they
[1:29:43] may fail first
[1:29:45] to get us out of the boat
[1:29:50] jesus
[1:29:53] i want to go look at matthew 9. i want
[1:29:54] to look at a couple scriptures back to
[1:29:55] back if you'll just take this walk
[1:29:57] through the
[1:29:58] gospels with me
[1:30:00] i want to look at something
[1:30:02] and then we'll start winding down
[1:30:08] matthew 9 and 27
[1:30:15] and when jesus departed thence two blind
[1:30:17] men followed him crying and saying thou
[1:30:19] son of david have mercy on us
[1:30:22] and he was coming to the house the blind
[1:30:24] men came to him and jesus saith and
[1:30:26] believeth believe ye that i am able to
[1:30:29] do this and they said unto him yay lord
[1:30:31] then touch to their eyes saying
[1:30:33] according to your faith be it unto you
[1:30:35] and their eyes were open and jesus
[1:30:36] straightly charged him saying see thou
[1:30:39] see that no man know it
[1:30:41] so we have two blind men saying lord
[1:30:43] save us
[1:30:44] he ask them what they want to see and he
[1:30:46] touches their eyes
[1:30:47] and their eyes come open
[1:30:49] let's go to mark chapter 10.
[1:30:54] mark 10 and 46
[1:31:00] it says and they came to jericho
[1:31:03] and as he went out of jericho with his
[1:31:04] disciples and a great number of people
[1:31:06] blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat
[1:31:09] by the high by the highway side begging
[1:31:12] when he heard that it was jesus of
[1:31:14] nazareth he began to cry out and say
[1:31:16] jesus thou son of david have mercy on us
[1:31:19] and many charged him that he should hold
[1:31:20] his peace but he cried the more oh great
[1:31:24] cried the more a great deal thou son of
[1:31:27] david have mercy on me and jesus stood
[1:31:30] still and commanded him to be called and
[1:31:32] they called the blind man saying unto
[1:31:34] him be of good comfort rise he calleth
[1:31:36] thee
[1:31:37] and he casted away his garment rose and
[1:31:39] came to jesus and jesus answered and
[1:31:41] said unto him
[1:31:42] what will thou that i should do unto
[1:31:44] thee
[1:31:45] the blind man said unto him lord that i
[1:31:47] might receive my sight
[1:31:49] and jesus said unto him go thy way thy
[1:31:51] faith have made thee whole
[1:31:53] and immediately he received the sight
[1:31:56] followed jesus in the way
[1:31:58] let's go to john chapter 9.
[1:32:02] this will all make sense in just a
[1:32:04] minute
[1:32:09] john chapter 9
[1:32:11] verse 1
[1:32:13] and as jesus passed by he saw a man
[1:32:15] which was blind from his birth
[1:32:17] and his disciples asked him saying
[1:32:18] master who did sin this man or his
[1:32:21] parents that he was born blind
[1:32:23] jesus answered neither hath this man sin
[1:32:26] nor his parents but that the works of
[1:32:28] god should be made manifest in him
[1:32:31] i must work the works of him that sent
[1:32:33] me while it is day
[1:32:35] the night cometh when no man can work
[1:32:37] as long as i am in the world i am the
[1:32:39] light of the world
[1:32:41] when he had thus spaken he spat on the
[1:32:43] ground and made a clay of spittle
[1:32:45] and he anointed the eyes of the blind
[1:32:47] man with the clay and said unto him go
[1:32:49] wash in the pool siloam which is by
[1:32:51] interpretation sent
[1:32:53] he went his way therefore and washed and
[1:32:55] came seeing
[1:32:57] all right this is interesting
[1:32:59] why do we read all this
[1:33:01] well because we have three healings of
[1:33:03] blind men
[1:33:05] the first time he touched their eyes
[1:33:08] and they could see
[1:33:10] so the second time when blind bartimaeus
[1:33:12] starts calling out and he calls for
[1:33:14] blind bartimaeus to come
[1:33:16] what do you think the disciples are
[1:33:17] waiting for
[1:33:19] they're waiting for jesus to touch his
[1:33:21] eyes
[1:33:22] because he touched his eyes before so
[1:33:24] obviously to heal a blind man you touch
[1:33:26] their eyes
[1:33:28] but jesus didn't touch his eyes
[1:33:30] he said go and be go seeing and he could
[1:33:32] see his eyes came open
[1:33:34] well then they get to the third one
[1:33:37] there's a man born blind
[1:33:39] and he sees him they asked him the
[1:33:40] question who sinned he said no one but
[1:33:41] the works of god might be made manifest
[1:33:43] and he goes to him and now the disciples
[1:33:45] have an argument
[1:33:47] what's he going to do this time flip a
[1:33:49] coin he's either going to touch or not
[1:33:50] touch i think touch because of this
[1:33:52] certain i think not touch because in
[1:33:54] this circumstance and this is like that
[1:33:56] circumstance and under these conditions
[1:33:58] he touched and remember he used his
[1:33:59] right hand and because he was standing
[1:34:01] with his right foot and now he's got his
[1:34:02] left foot forward and that time he just
[1:34:04] spoke the word
[1:34:07] can you see yourself
[1:34:09] [Music]
[1:34:11] we always try to figure god out
[1:34:14] we always try to mentally understand
[1:34:16] what god's going to do we always try to
[1:34:18] get ahead of the program and figure it
[1:34:19] out and i don't think the disciples were
[1:34:21] any different than us
[1:34:22] they probably questioned among
[1:34:24] themselves why did he touch one and not
[1:34:26] touch the other like why if you could
[1:34:27] just speak why would you even touch
[1:34:30] like if he could speak to blind barnabas
[1:34:32] why would you touch him
[1:34:33] but if he touched him to hit him how did
[1:34:35] he know he could speak and not touch i
[1:34:37] it's confusing
[1:34:39] but then when he comes to the third man
[1:34:41] it's going to get more confusing still
[1:34:44] because one's healed by touching his
[1:34:46] eyes one's healed by speaking the word
[1:34:48] but now he's gonna spit in the clay
[1:34:51] and he's gonna make a mud out of that
[1:34:53] spit and he's gonna take it he's gonna
[1:34:55] rub it in the man's eyes
[1:34:56] well now they have no clue this isn't
[1:35:00] left foot forward right foot forward
[1:35:01] this isn't he does this in june and he
[1:35:03] does this in august no this is a
[1:35:05] complete different set of circumstances
[1:35:08] now they're just as bewildered as ever
[1:35:10] why why if you can speak why spit if you
[1:35:13] can touch why something like this amen
[1:35:16] god knows why i don't know why god knows
[1:35:18] why but there's one thing for sure is
[1:35:20] jesus christ would never start a new
[1:35:23] tradition and he wouldn't get painted
[1:35:25] into a box
[1:35:26] he wouldn't get backed into a corner but
[1:35:28] god can show himself mighty any way he
[1:35:31] wants and he's requiring us to believe
[1:35:33] him if he does it one way one day a
[1:35:36] different way than next he's not going
[1:35:37] to do it the same way twice
[1:35:41] oh i love that in him it keeps us on our
[1:35:44] toes we're not going to figure him out
[1:35:45] we're not going to figure out what's
[1:35:46] going to happen next we're not going to
[1:35:48] get into this situation i've seen this
[1:35:49] situation before and under these
[1:35:51] circumstances it ain't going to happen
[1:35:52] like that friends
[1:35:54] god you'll get right to the point of
[1:35:56] having it figured out and god will do a
[1:35:58] sharp right turn just to throw you off
[1:35:59] so you quit relying on reasoning and
[1:36:02] come back to faith in god
[1:36:05] god can do what he wants to do the way
[1:36:08] he wants to do it when he wants to do it
[1:36:10] and we're required to believe him
[1:36:13] he can he can heal one one way and he
[1:36:15] can heal you a different way somebody
[1:36:17] can have an instant touch and you can
[1:36:18] fight it out for a week
[1:36:21] but who's going to complain
[1:36:23] he healed
[1:36:25] the man with the spit and the clay in
[1:36:27] his eyes wasn't complaining and saying
[1:36:30] why i'm so dirty why didn't you do like
[1:36:32] you did blind bartimaeus hey this guy
[1:36:35] wasn't complaining
[1:36:36] he had been delivered and it was the
[1:36:38] program of god and it was the desire of
[1:36:40] god and his obedience to that program of
[1:36:42] god delivered him and he could see
[1:36:46] we've got to get away from thinking our
[1:36:48] own thoughts amen and just rely upon him
[1:36:50] is he a healer absolutely how will he do
[1:36:53] it i have no idea
[1:36:55] he can use a doctor he can use a
[1:36:57] chiropractor he can use music
[1:37:00] is that what brother branham said
[1:37:02] is this the time for music or the
[1:37:04] chiropractor i don't know
[1:37:06] but i'm going to follow his leadership
[1:37:08] and let him be god
[1:37:10] and if he heals me one way one day and
[1:37:12] he heals me someplace totally different
[1:37:13] the next time will praise be to god he's
[1:37:16] the healer
[1:37:17] and he can do it any way he wants to do
[1:37:20] it
[1:37:22] we've got to cast down reasoning in
[1:37:24] every high thought that exalted himself
[1:37:26] against the knowledge of god and we got
[1:37:28] to be a fool so that we can become wise
[1:37:33] it's a good time to say i don't know
[1:37:37] what's going to happen next but i don't
[1:37:38] know
[1:37:40] but i know who's got it figured out
[1:37:44] and whenever i see him move i want to be
[1:37:46] wherever he is
[1:37:48] if i see him moving over here i'm going
[1:37:49] to try to get over there and say lord
[1:37:50] can i come
[1:37:52] if he says no i said okay
[1:37:54] if he says yes i want to go
[1:37:58] why would he call a bride
[1:38:02] in
[1:38:03] in this evil age
[1:38:05] to prove she's not like eve
[1:38:08] why
[1:38:10] you realize the messages that we are
[1:38:12] bombarded with is different than it's
[1:38:14] been in any generation the amount of
[1:38:16] unbelief that we face every day is
[1:38:19] unprecedented it has never been this way
[1:38:22] satan's eden has come to perfection and
[1:38:25] everywhere you turn your head is his
[1:38:27] message not the lord's
[1:38:29] everywhere you turn your head is his
[1:38:31] images his signals his words
[1:38:35] there's been this is unprecedented it's
[1:38:37] never been like this amen and you're
[1:38:40] bombarded constantly with news and
[1:38:42] information and and the information is
[1:38:45] contrary to one another the experts
[1:38:47] don't agree
[1:38:51] but they're still experts
[1:38:53] praise god
[1:38:55] i don't know where they got their expert
[1:38:56] certificate this one got one from one
[1:38:58] place that's different in this place
[1:38:59] because these experts don't agree
[1:39:01] but yet they're experts
[1:39:03] and we're supposed to believe the
[1:39:05] experts
[1:39:08] no
[1:39:09] we're supposed to believe the word of
[1:39:10] god
[1:39:13] i mean i'm not angry at the experts
[1:39:15] thank god for them i mean let them do
[1:39:16] whatever they can
[1:39:18] but i'm not putting my confidence
[1:39:20] cnn nbc fox
[1:39:23] it's all the same
[1:39:25] not putting my confidence no drudge is
[1:39:27] better no it's the same
[1:39:30] it's all products of unbelief
[1:39:33] and reporting on unbelief
[1:39:35] through unbelievers
[1:39:37] it's all it's a flood of unbelief
[1:39:41] but i want to say god just take me to
[1:39:44] your word
[1:39:45] just flood my heart with your word flood
[1:39:49] my mind with your word let me stay in
[1:39:51] the tapes constantly let me stay in the
[1:39:54] message books in my bible and in prayer
[1:39:55] and in fellowship constantly lord
[1:39:58] because th these
[1:39:59] these signals are all wrong they're
[1:40:01] everyone wrong
[1:40:03] this is right let every man's word be a
[1:40:05] lie and let god's word be the truth
[1:40:10] amen
[1:40:11] i mean it's amazing you talk to somebody
[1:40:14] about a disease and one person has one
[1:40:16] fact that one person has another fact
[1:40:19] and you're safe within six feet no
[1:40:20] you're not safe within 10 feet 10 feet
[1:40:23] or 6 feet
[1:40:26] i don't know
[1:40:28] sheltered in the arms of jesus
[1:40:32] because the experts are not sure
[1:40:35] i don't know when they'll be sure i
[1:40:37] don't know when they'll have it figured
[1:40:38] out but it doesn't matter
[1:40:41] i'll do what god asked me to do i'll
[1:40:43] submit to the authority that is
[1:40:44] overplaced over me but i'm going to
[1:40:46] believe god for my protection
[1:40:49] because if they say six foot and ends up
[1:40:50] ten foot
[1:40:52] what are we gonna do
[1:40:55] lose faith
[1:40:57] do you see what i'm saying
[1:40:58] if the safe distance is six foot but
[1:41:00] they find out all experts agree tomorrow
[1:41:02] it's ten foot well what about us being
[1:41:04] six foot apart you realize god's our
[1:41:06] protector
[1:41:08] he's got to be our protector we have no
[1:41:09] other hope it's got to be god
[1:41:11] it's got to be him
[1:41:13] there's no other hope friends this is
[1:41:15] the only one we've got he's got to be
[1:41:17] our protector he's got to be our
[1:41:18] deliverer he's got to be our healer amen
[1:41:21] there's nothing else that we can trust
[1:41:24] i trust in him
[1:41:26] you talk to people you talk to somebody
[1:41:28] and they got a whole different set of
[1:41:29] facts than what you got well i heard
[1:41:32] this and this well i heard this and this
[1:41:34] i don't know what to but i heard the
[1:41:36] true report
[1:41:38] that by his stripes i'm healed
[1:41:40] i've heard the true report that he is my
[1:41:42] father and he's watching over me i've
[1:41:44] heard the true report and i choose to
[1:41:45] believe that broadcast the gospel the
[1:41:48] good news and i want to believe it every
[1:41:50] day of my life and not not be nervous
[1:41:53] and not be afraid i'll be compliant i'll
[1:41:55] be kind and then i'll be loving and i'll
[1:41:57] project love to others but i'm not going
[1:41:59] to be afraid
[1:42:02] because if i'm all of a sudden needing
[1:42:03] to protect myself then why does god
[1:42:06] protect me
[1:42:09] he's got to be my shield
[1:42:11] he's got to be my buckler he's got to be
[1:42:14] my strong tower
[1:42:15] i don't have any other hope
[1:42:20] oh so much
[1:42:22] i want to say
[1:42:24] but god is good friends
[1:42:27] i want to read one more scripture and i
[1:42:29] got so much but maybe we'll get to it on
[1:42:31] wednesday some of these other things
[1:42:33] but let's go to john 21.
[1:42:42] john 21
[1:42:44] and verse 5.
[1:42:46] my thoughts are a little scattered
[1:42:48] because i'm just sharing from my heart
[1:42:51] trying my best
[1:42:53] to just
[1:42:55] let god lead and not push my own ideas
[1:42:58] or own personality but just let god lead
[1:43:02] if i can put
[1:43:04] your faith in anything
[1:43:06] i want to put it in the word of god amen
[1:43:09] if i could put you in any safe place
[1:43:12] it would be in the word of god
[1:43:14] if i could give you any protection it
[1:43:15] would be the word of god i have nothing
[1:43:17] else
[1:43:18] i have nothing else that i can guarantee
[1:43:20] that'll keep you safe and keep you
[1:43:22] protected and keep you out of harm the
[1:43:24] only thing i have is the word of god
[1:43:27] and when it looked like the word of god
[1:43:29] when it looks like the word of god fails
[1:43:31] all we can do is go right back to the
[1:43:32] word of god because we have nothing else
[1:43:35] it was like brother ben if i prayed for
[1:43:36] a thousand people i'd come back tomorrow
[1:43:38] why he has nothing else to give the
[1:43:40] people but the word
[1:43:42] and if you stand on the word and it
[1:43:43] looks like the word failed what do you
[1:43:45] do you come right back to the word
[1:43:46] because we got nothing else
[1:43:48] there is nothing else there is no other
[1:43:51] hope the only hope we have is the word
[1:43:53] of god
[1:43:54] nothing else is going to change our
[1:43:55] bodies it's going to be faith in that
[1:43:57] word
[1:43:59] we've got to believe him
[1:44:01] and let him lead
[1:44:03] john 21
[1:44:04] verse 5
[1:44:07] then jesus saith unto them children have
[1:44:09] you any meat
[1:44:10] they answered him no
[1:44:12] you know where they're at
[1:44:14] they're in a boat
[1:44:16] they're fishing
[1:44:18] jesus is resurrected they don't know
[1:44:20] what else to do
[1:44:21] peter says i go fishing and several of
[1:44:23] them said we'll go with you
[1:44:24] they're out in the boat a little ways
[1:44:26] from land and
[1:44:27] and jesus calls out them children have
[1:44:29] you any meat
[1:44:30] they said no
[1:44:32] and he said unto them
[1:44:33] cast a net on the right side of the ship
[1:44:35] and you shall find
[1:44:38] wow
[1:44:39] he's going to do something unusual again
[1:44:42] he's going to do something weird
[1:44:45] kind of like something he's done before
[1:44:48] and they cast therefore and now they
[1:44:50] were not able to draw it for the
[1:44:51] multitude of fishes
[1:44:54] therefore that disciple whom jesus loved
[1:44:56] which is john
[1:44:57] saith unto peter it is the lord
[1:44:59] now when simon peter heard that it was
[1:45:01] the lord he gird his fisherman's coat
[1:45:02] unto him for he was naked and did cast
[1:45:05] himself into the sea
[1:45:08] oh i like peter
[1:45:11] i like peter friends
[1:45:14] when he saw jesus come walking on the
[1:45:16] water in the midst of the storm
[1:45:19] he said can i come to where you are
[1:45:21] she said come and he got out of the boat
[1:45:23] to come
[1:45:24] but now the circumstances are different
[1:45:26] and things are a little different
[1:45:27] there's no storm but they're empty
[1:45:31] they're not having any success
[1:45:33] jesus says cast it on the right side and
[1:45:36] they did and john the type of the bride
[1:45:38] caught it
[1:45:40] it's the lord
[1:45:42] but peter
[1:45:43] always wants to be where the lord is
[1:45:46] he was in a perfectly good boat
[1:45:49] and that boat had oars and a sail and
[1:45:51] all the equipment needed to get to the
[1:45:53] lord
[1:45:54] in fact everybody else rode the boats
[1:45:57] without peter's help
[1:45:58] to get to the lord
[1:46:00] but peter just couldn't help himself he
[1:46:03] gird himself about and he jumped in and
[1:46:05] he swam to the lord he couldn't wait to
[1:46:08] get to where the lord was
[1:46:10] and i'm not i i'm not ashamed that that
[1:46:13] was peter
[1:46:14] i'm not ashamed there was a nature god
[1:46:16] had to train some things out of peter he
[1:46:18] had to teach peter to be obedient he had
[1:46:20] to bring peter to humility but there was
[1:46:22] something god loved in peter
[1:46:25] he swam up and
[1:46:27] the lord fixed food for them and he
[1:46:29] began to redirect
[1:46:31] peter
[1:46:33] peter just wanted to be where the lord
[1:46:34] was
[1:46:35] but he says if you love me
[1:46:37] feed my sheep
[1:46:41] if you love me
[1:46:42] feed my sheep if you love me
[1:46:44] feed my sheep
[1:46:46] and god was training peter peter you
[1:46:49] love me
[1:46:50] you jump out of a perfectly good boat
[1:46:52] just to get to me you'll climb out of a
[1:46:55] boat in the middle of the storm to come
[1:46:56] to where i am peter you love me
[1:46:58] if you love me
[1:47:00] feed my sheep
[1:47:02] if you want to get to me
[1:47:04] if you want to be near me
[1:47:06] do what i told you to do
[1:47:09] he had to redirect peter
[1:47:11] i want to be able to be redirected
[1:47:14] i want to be where he is hey if the
[1:47:16] lord's here i'm out of the boat
[1:47:20] if the lord's not in the boat i want to
[1:47:22] be wherever the lord is i want to get
[1:47:24] out of the tradition i want to get out
[1:47:25] of the uh of whatever
[1:47:27] my own idea i want to get out i want to
[1:47:29] jump out of it as fast as i can and swim
[1:47:31] to wherever the lord is
[1:47:33] but if the lord sits me down and says no
[1:47:34] i want you over here i want to go over
[1:47:36] there
[1:47:37] he says you're loving me do this i said
[1:47:40] i'll do that lord whatever i want to be
[1:47:42] wherever you are but if you send me here
[1:47:43] i'm going to go there because that's
[1:47:45] what you want
[1:47:47] peter learned how to be obedient but
[1:47:49] peter had a love for the lord that would
[1:47:51] get him out of the boat that would get
[1:47:53] him out of the normal
[1:47:55] that would get him out of the usual that
[1:47:56] would get him out of the comfort zone
[1:47:58] and would get him to where other people
[1:48:00] weren't willing to go and i want to be
[1:48:03] that way
[1:48:05] i want
[1:48:07] could he look foolish
[1:48:08] yes
[1:48:10] i mean he's standing there
[1:48:12] how far ahead of the boat he was i don't
[1:48:14] know
[1:48:15] maybe he beat him by 10 minutes
[1:48:17] and he's sopping wet
[1:48:20] but it was worth the 10 minutes to peter
[1:48:24] somebody might have said you fool
[1:48:27] if you'd have just stayed 15 more
[1:48:28] minutes in the boat we would have got
[1:48:30] here you wouldn't have had to nearly
[1:48:31] drown you wouldn't have had
[1:48:37] you fooled why did you climb out in a
[1:48:39] storm and go walking where you nearly
[1:48:40] drowned it wasn't for the lord you'd be
[1:48:42] dead right now you fool
[1:48:51] peter was no fool
[1:48:54] it was worth it to him
[1:48:55] to be wherever the lord was
[1:48:59] i'm proud of peter amen not ashamed to
[1:49:02] peter
[1:49:04] i don't want to be more worried about my
[1:49:06] reputation
[1:49:08] it's going to take looking like a fool
[1:49:10] to be wherever the lord is
[1:49:12] then call me a fool i want to be where
[1:49:14] the lord is
[1:49:16] you nearly drowned peter look at you
[1:49:20] you walk in the water you nearly drowned
[1:49:21] and the lord had to bail you out
[1:49:27] peter probably
[1:49:28] wasn't mean
[1:49:31] but he could have said
[1:49:32] thomas
[1:49:34] have you ever walked on water
[1:49:42] by being a fool i've gone places i've
[1:49:44] never been before
[1:49:47] i've experienced supernatural things in
[1:49:49] the lord i've never experienced before
[1:49:52] staying in the tradition
[1:49:54] i've never felt like it was to be
[1:49:56] supported by faith
[1:49:58] peter wasn't supported by water
[1:50:01] peter was supported by faith
[1:50:03] he lost the support of the familiar old
[1:50:05] ship the old church walk the old
[1:50:07] churchianity and he got out there and he
[1:50:09] walked on something that wasn't supposed
[1:50:11] to work but his faith held him up
[1:50:15] thomas john and james and
[1:50:18] they stayed in the old church system
[1:50:21] peter was the one who looked like the
[1:50:22] fool but peter had been a place they'd
[1:50:24] never been
[1:50:26] and peter had an experience they've
[1:50:27] never had
[1:50:31] i said make me a fool
[1:50:33] i just want to be where he is
[1:50:35] if i got to swim
[1:50:37] walk on water
[1:50:38] if i try and fail and he's got to rescue
[1:50:40] me
[1:50:41] hey he'll rescue me
[1:50:44] but i want to get to him
[1:50:46] i want to be wherever he is wherever
[1:50:48] he's working where he's moving if it's
[1:50:49] unusual i want to be there if it's odd i
[1:50:52] want to be there if it's scary i still
[1:50:54] want to be there
[1:50:55] but i want to be where he is
[1:50:59] wasn't safer in the boat
[1:51:01] no matter what anybody thought it wasn't
[1:51:03] safer in the boat
[1:51:05] wherever the lord is they just said
[1:51:07] peter
[1:51:09] peter peter peter peter
[1:51:11] he was coming to the boat
[1:51:15] right when he picked you up after you
[1:51:17] made a fool of yourself and after you
[1:51:18] drowned he picked you up and he come to
[1:51:20] the boat and you remember what happened
[1:51:22] when he got on the boat everything
[1:51:23] stopped everything was fine why didn't
[1:51:25] you just wait for him to get in the boat
[1:51:29] oh praise god
[1:51:31] praise god
[1:51:33] cast down reasoning in every high
[1:51:35] thought hey you had no guarantee without
[1:51:37] peter he was coming in that boat maybe
[1:51:38] he was coming for peter
[1:51:41] i don't know i don't know why the
[1:51:42] circumstances were the way they were but
[1:51:44] i want to be able to get out of this
[1:51:46] boat and go wherever he is if he bids me
[1:51:48] come
[1:51:49] and if i see him over there i want to
[1:51:51] get rid of the familiar and i want to
[1:51:52] swim to wherever he is and if it doesn't
[1:51:54] look orthodox and they're not pretty
[1:51:56] strokes amen and it's not a good job
[1:51:58] swimming i don't care as long as i get
[1:52:01] to where he's at
[1:52:03] and he's revealing himself in this word
[1:52:05] and he keeps popping up in strange
[1:52:07] places in the scriptures and he keeps
[1:52:09] popping up in strange places in the
[1:52:10] message and he shows the seventh seal
[1:52:12] over here and the son of man ministry
[1:52:14] over here and it pops up and i just want
[1:52:16] to jump out of the boat and swim to that
[1:52:18] because this boat is too slow for me
[1:52:22] i want to be wherever he is
[1:52:25] fear not it is i
[1:52:27] be of good cheer
[1:52:29] don't be afraid to get out of the boat
[1:52:32] will you look like a fool
[1:52:34] it's a good chance
[1:52:36] will the people in the boat understand
[1:52:38] you
[1:52:40] probably not
[1:52:44] well maybe you need rescued
[1:52:47] maybe
[1:52:48] you'll get out in unfamiliar territory
[1:52:50] and start to get nervous and start to
[1:52:52] get afraid and start to sink
[1:52:54] possibly
[1:52:56] but he'll save you he'll rescue you
[1:53:01] just keep pressing towards the mark of
[1:53:02] the high calling in christ jesus
[1:53:05] just become a fool
[1:53:07] that you might be wise
[1:53:09] let's cast down reasoning
[1:53:11] science education
[1:53:14] civilization it's of the devil brother
[1:53:17] bam says it over and over and over i'm
[1:53:19] not ashamed to say it
[1:53:20] and i'm not ashamed to use my phone or
[1:53:22] drive my car
[1:53:24] but all those things will fade away but
[1:53:26] the one thing that's going to change my
[1:53:28] body is faith
[1:53:29] the faith of the son of god the one
[1:53:31] thing that's going to move me into the
[1:53:33] kingdom of faith is my faith in the word
[1:53:35] of god and that's the thing that i want
[1:53:37] to have faith in his word above
[1:53:40] civilization above science above
[1:53:43] education i want faith in his word and i
[1:53:45] want everything else to be subjected to
[1:53:48] faith in his word
[1:53:49] and i want that to be supreme
[1:53:52] so friends in the days of
[1:53:55] pandemics
[1:53:57] and the days of uncertainty and
[1:53:58] financial crisis and the days of
[1:54:01] contagious diseases
[1:54:03] i've only got one thing for you
[1:54:05] that's the word of god
[1:54:07] i've only got one recommendation that's
[1:54:09] the word of god i've only got one
[1:54:11] guarantee that i'll never fail and
[1:54:13] that's the word of god
[1:54:15] and if i if i die and the lord takes me
[1:54:18] let him take me screaming this to this
[1:54:20] congregation stay with the word
[1:54:23] don't trust science don't trust wisdom
[1:54:26] don't trust governments stay with the
[1:54:29] word
[1:54:30] because the word won't fail
[1:54:32] if it looks like it failed come right
[1:54:34] back to the word again because the word
[1:54:36] can't fail
[1:54:37] right amen
[1:54:39] pray for a thousand people in the
[1:54:40] morning they're dead
[1:54:44] get prayer card number one

[1:54:50] have yes
[1:54:52] [Applause]
[1:54:54] amen
[1:54:55] if everything goes haywire
[1:54:57] everything goes wrong
[1:54:59] and the intellect and
[1:55:01] and the reasoning all goes crazy
[1:55:04] ask god to give us enough faith to have
[1:55:06] prayer card number one
[1:55:08] next night
[1:55:10] i want god's word to be supreme in my
[1:55:12] life

[1:55:25] i'll tell you what i love you all
[1:55:30] i've
[1:55:30] just
[1:55:32] come to the place where i give up trying
[1:55:36] i quit trying to be a good preacher
[1:55:38] i quit trying to have a nice subject
[1:55:41] i quit trying to go a different
[1:55:42] direction
[1:55:44] i quit trying to have something new
[1:55:47] all i know to do is say believe the word
[1:55:50] follow him
[1:55:51] and everything will be all right how
[1:55:53] will it work i don't know
[1:55:55] would it be bad maybe
[1:55:57] could it be scary probably
[1:55:59] will it work absolutely
[1:56:02] there's nothing else that we can point
[1:56:03] each other to but to work to the word
[1:56:06] to what the message the prophet brought
[1:56:08] us it will work
[1:56:11] the same faith in the same word it will
[1:56:14] produce the same results and if you have
[1:56:16] to try it two times or three times or
[1:56:18] four times he never said how many times
[1:56:21] we'd have to try he didn't say how long
[1:56:22] we'd have to stick with it but he said
[1:56:24] it would work
[1:56:25] and it will work friends
[1:56:28] god bless you let's bow our heads and
[1:56:30] pray
[1:56:32] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[1:56:34] lord
[1:56:35] god it means more to us than life
[1:56:38] god when this life is gone this word
[1:56:40] will continue on god when this natural
[1:56:43] fades away
[1:56:44] when we no longer need science or a car
[1:56:46] or an airplane or a cell phone or a
[1:56:48] computer when it's no longer necessary
[1:56:51] lord your word will continue marching
[1:56:53] forward your word will still be the
[1:56:56] foundation that we stand on and it'll
[1:56:57] still be our life it'll still be our
[1:56:59] portion
[1:57:00] god forgive us lord for all of our
[1:57:03] confusion and all of our wondering in
[1:57:06] our mind

[1:57:09] help us to become fools lord that we
[1:57:10] might be wise

[1:57:20] and that you may bring by your power by
[1:57:23] your authority by your own work by your
[1:57:25] spirit that you may bring to not all the
[1:57:28] things that are
[1:57:30] god you've called us and satan's eden
[1:57:32] because you deemed this a perfect time
[1:57:35] you let it get as bad as it could
[1:57:37] possibly get
[1:57:38] in the realms of unbelief
[1:57:42] and lust
[1:57:43] in every evil thing lord you've let it
[1:57:46] come to the pinnacle because you deemed
[1:57:48] this the appropriate time to prove your
[1:57:50] bride

[1:57:54] that you would take us lord weak

[1:58:07] and shake the world
[1:58:09] then will you take us lord
[1:58:11] plan inside of us your same spirit
[1:58:14] give us the same faith in your word
[1:58:17] would you take us
[1:58:18] and prove to your enemy satan
[1:58:21] that this bride of yours is not like eve

[1:58:27] do it but you can do it in us lord we
