[Music] oh lord praise you praise the lord man if you could turn in your bibles to revelation chapter 21 i'd like to read the first 11 verses of revelations 21. we're grateful that we could be here we're just coming in just barely made it to service and we took the last couple weeks off just trying to enjoy a little bit of a vacation because we have followed the leading of the lord to start a church from scratch in phoenix arizona and we leave here we might just drive straight through and get in tonight and tomorrow morning we start packing boxes and lord willing labor day weekend will be holding our first service at uh arizona believer's church in phoenix arizona and so we covet your prayers and brother paula fontaine told me it was a really uh or maybe it was uh actually his brother brandon senecola said it really was a cheap trick to try to go to the pastor's retreat whenever they have them just start your own church but uh that's not the reason but we are uh we're believer following the leading of the lord we've seen the hand of god in doing it and i mention it to you just ask for your prayers because you as an assembly have been very supportive of my wife and i have been very encouraging and uh we consider many of you just just as a church we just consider to be family and so you know that there is a body that is working to bring to pass every promise of god to be made manifest in the bride in phoenix arizona we we're just we're looking for that last soul uh and we believe that in this this end time evangelism is the shaping of the stone so we're not expecting it to be a harvest like the world would look for but i believe it's going to be a hundred fold it's gonna be a hundred percent it's gonna bring forth whatever god has ordained for it to bring forth and so we covet your prayers in following the leadership of the lord and doing that revelation chapter 21 also i want brother danny ratliff asked us uh wanted to send greetings to you brother chad and also to the church here at pastors bible tabernacle in ann arbor area he wanted to send his greetings to you revelations chapter 21 verses 1 to 11 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more seed and there's in the past in a way it's there's a lot of rich meaning that's being implied there because we know that the heavens and the earth are an original spoken word attribute of god therefore it has an eternal quality but yet there's a transformation that takes place and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end so there's a beginning and an end i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i show thee the bride the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was likened to stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal if we could bow our heads in a word of prayer our heavenly father lord it's just so thrilling to read the bible and to see jesus christ in every verse and to know that it was your very breath that wrote these words it's been your very presence that's washed out over it preserved it that we could even open a book lord and read it and believe and have confidence that despite the translations and despite the different turns and paths that even this uh these writers and these translators took we believe that you have been able to hide yourself within these words lord we're thankful for a prophet to come and to restore us back to the bible to believe the bible to take you at your word and to anchor ourselves in the scripture so fathers we have read this and it's from your mind and from your heart we pray that you'd bless it may be made alive to us by revelation today and bless your people for their faithfulness for their attentiveness for their anticipation for the word and even their ability to pull upon the gift and lord may we have just an endurance today and a ready mind to receive from you we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you can be seated i'm very grateful for the opportunity to minister today and i have struck my heart that this is my last service um in this time in my uh time of my ministry if someone call it evangelism or traveling and ministering and being sent out to minister and i felt the lord deal with my heart and i give this as a warning i just want to summarize 20 something years of ministry today but i there's things that have been in my heart that god just struck struck me with and impacted me with to kind of just if i could just deliver my burden as an evangelist i know i have a little bit of a different gift than maybe the traditional evangelist and the dynamic gifts that we see in the body of christ today but i feel something in my heart just express what has been the thrust of my god dealing with my heart in a particular way and god deals with different people in many different ways but if it's in the word we believe it and we accept it and as i was pondering that this week and just realizing this would be my last opportunity to minister out from my home church which is right now a hickory bible tabernacle with brother berry i realized that the first time i ever preached meetings and i was invited to preach more than just a sunday service it was right here in lima ohio so i'm very grateful to have that opportunity to come back and to minister and just complete this stage of my life and my ministry before we transition into the next step of starting a church and the my title today is the becoming god the becoming god and i'm drawing a lot from christ as the mystery god revealed and christ revealed in his own word and so if you're just looking for a pointer or just a little signal for something to listen to or to read uh those two sermons are always very good just to pour into and study and i believe christ is the mystery of god revealed it means a lot to us as the bride because uh when brother brown be is preaching that sermon we see that whatever silence was still on that seventh seal when brother branham preached it earlier that year it had begun to lift and had moved into that cycle where now this seventh seal is being made known very plainly to his elect and not everyone can see it but the elect sees it and so in revelations chapter 21 again our title is the becoming god in revelations chapter 21 and i want to i thought in my heart that uh i want to take you guys at your word every time i preach you always tell me and i say always the people who tell me it's a lot of people tell me you stopped too soon you could have gone longer but the chad's told me preach as long as you want three hours is no problem so i thought finally since this is my last chance as an evangelist i want to do it and i mentioned that to my wife and she said oh no you can't do that brother chad said you can't do that it's too long people wearing masks they can't breathe and everything so i don't really know what to do except just obey the lord at this point but revelations chapter 21 expresses a symbolic picture we know there's particular aspects that may be literal but yet we know that it expresses a symbolic picture and this image that we read in revelations chapter 21 holds the mystery of the bride of christ and it's very remarkable um it's where it's placed in scripture here at the very end and revelation is a book of symbols and the symbol is a lot like a sign when i refer to a sign maybe even a traffic sign or a traffic light or a billboard or something a symbol is like a sign in that it points beyond itself to something else so if you see a symbol if revelation is a book of symbols we don't look to the symbol but we realize the symbol is pointing beyond itself to something else just like a sign is indicating something so it's pointing to something beyond itself just like a stop sign when you see a stop sign it points to the law a law that requires cars to stop in an orderly fashion at different intervals so that traffic uh can be safe or you could cross an intersection so the sign itself is pointing to a law the sign itself is pointing to an order it's pointing to an interval of cars stopping and starting again and it's important to understand that concept to assemble but also to a sign when god gives a sign so that a sign of something is not pointing to itself but rather it points beyond itself to something else so when we saw the sign of the son of man or you saw the sign of discernment it's not pointing to itself but it's big you got it it goes beyond itself it's pointing to something else so the sign of the son of man could be given uh for a number of years but what it's pointing to is something beyond itself and that's when the son of man himself comes and makes himself manifest in revelations chapter 21 verse 2 he's john writing and expressing in himself what he saw and he says and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem and i believe brother lonnie jenkins said it many many years ago and it really stuck out to me that the bride sees what john sees she hears what john hears once you've come up into revelations chapter 5 we see and hear what john sees and hears it says i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god so it's something that's ushering forth from god out of heaven so it's not just coming out of heaven it's coming down from god out of heaven and as he's beholding the city and he sees this come down out of god out of heaven john is struck to say as a bride adorned for her husband so what the inspiration that john receives when he sees a city is this is like a wife this is a bride prepared and dressed for her husband and as this inspiration strikes him and he describes the city and this or he just describes the city in this manner as a bride adorned for her husband verse 3 says and i heard a great voice out of head saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and there's an aspect to this declaration and this unction which is descriptive of the gentile bride because in hosea chapter 2 verse 23 he says i will sow her unto me in the earth so god is going to sow as a seed a woman i'm going to sow her in the earth her seed is already in the earth she's laying there in the earth and says for me for my purpose for what i desire i will sow her unto me in the earth and this is an important principle i hope that you can grab a hold of and catch and maintain through the remainder of the service god is saying i will sow a woman i will sow her for me for my benefit for my purpose she will be sown into the earth and he says and i will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and i will say to them which were not my people because this is the perception of the jews this is the perception of israel that if you are not from the father father abraham then you're a heathen you're a reprobate you're a gentile you're outside the promises god does not have mercy upon you he has judgment you are not his people we are the people of abraham isaac and jacob and we are the people of the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and they had that type of relationship and anyone outside of that natural lineages would not were not the people of god but yet god is declaring that you will be my people those who were seemingly weren't you will by be my people thou art my people and they shall say thou art my god so he will say to you you are my people even though you were not seen as my people perceived as my people could have never been imagined to be my people i will say you have been my people all along and then there's this unction in this response back thou art my god so as he says that the tabernacle of god will be with men and god shall be with them and they shall be their god there is a reflection of the gentile bride which is sown into the earth for the per for god's purpose for him himself now this is john's reaction and the voice that speaks from heaven when he sees the holy city the new jerusalem coming out from god he says this is like a bride adorned for her husband then in verse 9 the angel this vile angel speaks and says come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife so there's union that's taking place it's this is a wife not a girlfriend not someone a spouse he says i'm going to show you the bride the lamb's wife so when john sees the city he's struck with the inspiration this is a bride prepared for her husband now he's actually going to be shown a bride he's going to be shown a wife he says and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain so this is a great and high mountain when you think of a high mountain i think of brother branham saying that there's these three these three showdowns there was a mount carmel showdown a mount transfiguration slowdown and then a mount zion showdown and in each showdown it happened at the top mount carmel was at the top mount transfiguration was at the top and so now mount zion's climax and her showdown takes place at the top paul brought the church to mount zion at its base and at the very beginning of it but now in this hour when brother branham comes preaching the same gospel paul preached it's not a foundation message it's a capstone message at the very top so he's carried to a great and high mountain at the very top the very pinnacle it says and he showed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god now john is going to be shown a wife and he sees the city when he saw the city he thought of a wife so now these themes are being married together to where this holy city the new jerusalem is in fact the lamb's wife it is the bride of christ or the god's bride because he describes the great city the holy jerusalem which he's not been there's not been a trick played on him i'm going to show you the lamb's wife and he sees a city but it's a symbol we know there'll be a city but it's also a symbol here it's representative of something he says descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and what does paul teach us that the woman is the glory of the man first corinthians 11 7 the woman is the glory of the man so when the city descends it's the lamb's wife and she comes forth and she has the glory of god because she is the wife of god therefore the woman is the glory of the man and we can say that if the man is the glory of god the son of man is the glory of god and the bride is the glory of the son of man we see these themes repeating themselves in the message so she has the glory of god says and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clearest crystal and that's representative of her having the mind of christ and having a clear understanding which is the evidence of the holy ghost she has this purity of thought purity of mind she has the mind of christ she has the glory of god and her light her understanding her revelation is pure and crystal clear and so these symbols of revelation is speaking of which speak of the new jerusalem the holy city are pointing to the bride and the bride is revealing the mystery of christ brother branham teaches this in choosing of a bride he says now we here see plainly the spiritual plan of god's planning for his future home with his future bride it comes into view now so it's god's plan for his future home and his future bride so it's god's bride it's his future home with his future bride he's saying we see plainly the spiritual plan it's coming into view and he says if a man marries a sex queen you see what he's looking for for the future so in this we see god's planning for his future home with this future bride and brother brad i'm saying if you see a man that marries a woman who's of a particular disposition or particular character he's saying you see what he's looking for for the future so a man at the moment that he chooses a wife even if it hasn't been expressed or it's unknown the man's hidden character is revealed in his wife something having not yet been manifested something not yet seen when a man chooses a woman you don't have to know his future you can just look at his wife and see what he's planning regardless of how he's lived and what he's done the woman that a man chooses speaks of what he's looking for in the future so the wife holds the mystery of a man's future home and therefore the bride herself holds the mystery of the future home and that is why the bride the lamb's wife is the first manifestation of the holy city the new jerusalem the future home of a man is first seen in the woman that he chooses to marry so it hides but then it also manifests and reveals the future he says again in choosing of ride it reflects when a man chooses a woman he says it shows what he has in his mind of what his future home is going to be i just think about as a mess a student of the message how these things connect together he says it shows what he has in his mind of what his future home is going to be he says again it reflects what's in the man a man that takes a woman like that shows just what he's thinking of the future again he says that reflects his own godly character and reflects what's in his mind and what's going to be in the future isn't this beautiful so he's preaching choosing of a bride and he's using not the natural process to understand god's process choosing is the receiving choosing is a naming and even as it when god told samuel i'm going to i'm going to have a new king he says i want you to go to jesse's house and the one who my name is going to be the one that's going to be the king and so the naming is a choosing the naming isn't identifying it's a name being called brother is preaching the choosing of a bride why because the bridegroom was receiving a bride unto himself he was naming her he was choosing her and he's using this natural process of how a natural man would choose a woman and he's saying you may know nothing about the man how he likes his home to be kept where he wants to live and what he wants to do but as soon as he chooses a woman look at the woman because she reveals what the man's thinking she reveals what's in his heart she reveals what his future home is going to be so it reveals a man's character and it reveals the man's future it reveals things that are presently true about the man but it also reveals what the man is meditating and planning in his heart that's what the woman reflects in the natural and brother adam is saying this is so with god as he chooses a bride he is identifying and naming the holy city the habitation of god the new jerusalem and as she is made up and comes to be in flesh like you are today you are the habitation of god you are the tabernacle of god you are the very dwelling place of the almighty you are the ones who are the very ministry of the son of man you are the new jerusalem and it comes it comes into being now because you being chosen and being married to christ the union takes place here taking place now and i love it to know that all of us individually have that revelation that i don't have to stand here and and convince you by reading quotes that the union is now but i can preach what brother branham said say it the way he said it knowing that to those to whom he's ordained to marry those to whom he's ordained himself to unite with you will have a revelation of this union individually and that is what we desire as ministers is that you come into union and understand in revelation of this because it's the key for us to go home and so the principle that i want to establish as we go forward is a wife is the manifestation of the hidden thoughts of a man a wife is a is a manifestation of what's in a man's mind it's a reflection of his heart a bride reflects what's in the heart of a man reflects what he's thinking now that with that is a building block in the foundation what we see in revelations chapter 21 is a completion of seeds that were sown in the book of genesis we know that genesis is the seed chapter brother brandon refers to it as and the picture in revelations chapter 21 is something that unfolds or develops over time and through a process and what john is seeing is he's seeing a finished product symbolically we can read it we said oh it's all finished it's in its splendor the bible is quickly going to be wrapped up in chapter 22 and this great scene is going to be described there's a great uh a call that goes out the spirit and the bride say come why because you've got to come into fellowship with this christ you've got to come in through and walk through these scriptures to come to the finality and the conclusion of this bible and so john is seeing a finished product but i want to just lay a few principles very quickly about how that what we see in revelation is actually the product of seeds that were sown in genesis and and there's ways that we can type it and we can begin to show the parallels between the book of genesis and the book of revelation but i want to be very specific and focused uh this morning with you and in a message brother branham who do you say this is he's speaking about the foolish virgin and and the woman eve he says notice the woman here represents the future denominational church called bride it all come up in genesis it's a seed you start in genesis you'll get your picture straight so it's remarkable he's identifying the fullest virgin and he's liking it to what eve reflected and manifested and said we see the seeds of it in genesis he says in another place babylon first appeared first in genesis he says it appears over here in the bible again about the middle of the old testament and then comes all over into revelation for the last days babylon so he says it appears in the beginning it comes back in the middle and it comes back at the end so it's sown it manifested in genesis and then you see it again in the in revelation but not only does the foolish virgin appear in genesis or babylon appear in genesis but the bride does now she may not be as clearly identifiable and evident as babylon or or the foolish virgin and those that would play that role but the bride is also hidden and sown in the book of genesis bill abraham says in genesis was the seed chapter where all seeds were sown everything you find in the world come out of genesis everything began back there in the beginning he says now we do have things today that are hybrid and perverted but we can go back to genesis to see where it was changed and then he uses again the example of babylon found in genesis and also found in revelation he says but you've got to go back to the beginning to start everything and this is a statement that's very uh profound to me it just strikes me says now if the faith that was once delivered to the saints we got to go plumb back to the beginning to get it to find out what we're going to talk about many when they think about the faith once delivered to the saints they go back to the first church and we can say the day of pentecost and listen the day of pentecost first church those are not terms of derision those are not derogatory terms those are not criticisms uh those those those things are to be revered and to help precious to our hearts and not use those words uh to kind of profane what has been listen if they weren't who they were you can't be who you were are there's no way in the world you can't profane pentecostaleodycia you'll profane the very thing you're standing upon not the nonsense it became after a number of years but the real genuine holy ghost that was poured out the messenger being the holy ghost itself the baptism of the holy ghost and those things being poured out in laodicea we're standing upon the shoulders of our pentecostal brethren who received the restoration of the gifts who received the baptismal goals and we're partakers of the same and so that when brother we think about the apostolic faith or the faith of our fathers the faith once delivered to the saints we don't just go back to the first church but we go all the way back to genesis he says you've got to go back to the beginning to find out what we're talking about it's the only way that you can fully make sense of what god's doing on the day of pentecost so genesis holds patterns for us it holds types and it foreshadows it forecasts and foreshadows things that are to take place and it's the very foundation and holds the seeds of what god is doing in creation in christ as the mystery of god revealed brother branham says just this statement he says the threefold purpose of god manifested in adam and eve and that to me is a very weighty statement the threefold purpose of god manifested in adam and eve there's other aspects that are manifested in the old testament you can see glimpses and different shadows and types to the different characters in the old testament and brother brahm talks about how moses and david and joseph um foreshadowed and typed the coming of a perfect bridegroom and so what you see in the old testament is just forecasting foreshadowing different glimpses different expressions and you can see and type what christ was going to be but then when the bridegroom comes and manifest himself then everything that was passed that pointed to him just stands out and is highlighted because they were all foreshadowing the coming of a perfect bridegroom he says this about adam and eve themselves the threefold purpose of god was manifested in adam and the woman he says god making himself known so god's purpose was hidden as a menace a mystery in the manifestation of adam and the woman there's the man and the woman standing there in the beginning in genesis chapter two and god is hiding something about himself and his plan in this image of adam and the woman billy branham and power of transformation says there was adam and eve walking in the garden of eden every seed bringing forth it never could do nothing else it never could do nothing else because god said let it be that way it had to be that way now as brother brahms describing this he has prophetic vision to see what was taking place then and he says adam and the woman he's given us maybe a glimpse into the silence between genesis 2 and genesis 3. because once we see this beautiful picture the man and the woman in the garden of eden the very next chapter is the serpent uh tempting the woman to fall and we don't see the time that they had spent together in the presence of god coming into the garden at which his presence was declared by a voice and so god's presence is declared by which the voice of god came walking in the garden so we can't just picture maybe a man with flesh and some nikes on coming for a morning jog with with adam but rather the voice of god declared the presence of god and adam knew god by his voice and it wonderful i repeats again in the last days that we know his presence by his voice and so as as it's brother rams see in this image he sees the man and the woman under a command the seed of god being sown god's saying be fruitful multiply replenish the earth each seed bringing forth of his kind he says oh my isn't this beautiful he's describing he sees it and he says oh how i'd like to stop here just a minute to say there is where we are facing yet the completion of that word so if you want to understand where the bride is today she is facing and she has passed with and she has been given a sacred charge to complete that word because that word was never finished by adam and the woman that word was never completed so brother adam's coming as a prophet in the end and say the potential of that the promise of that everything that they stood for and represented the bride now in the end will fulfill all that was promised to be made manifest in the virgin here we stand facing the fulfillment and the completion of the original not just restored back to the original but we are the completion and the climax and the finishing of the original you could give me maybe just a tiny bit more on the monitors up here this is what happens when you don't preach for a couple weeks you lose your voice now he says that god said as he describes it we're facing the completion of that word he says god said let it be he says and that's why it was the way that it was and let it be is drawing from even from genesis chapter 1 verse 11 where it says in each seed bringing forth of its kind whose seed was in itself so each kind or each specie had a seed within itself and it brought forth itself by the seed that was in it so it was a duplicate here i am i i'm a wheat plant i have my seed in myself to bring forth a mirror image of me and that's how it would replicate and brother branham actually it was god who said the law of reproduction i believe he said pick up your pen and write this is god's law of reproduction so god himself says you want to know how i reproduce this is god's law of reproduction and so god establishes his principle of reproduction by seed and he's revealing something about himself he's revealing something about his purpose he's revealing something about even his desire it's god's law of reproduction to reproduce as a verb means to produce again a reproduction as a noun is an act an adjective noun is an act of forming again it's a generation and so if you have one with the seed in itself to reproduce is to brief is to bring out another one and so it's expressing something about god when he says this is my law of reproduction let each seed whose cities in itself produce a duplicate of the original by dna by design it and listen in god's original it would have been exactly the same if you did a dna test well this is grain of wheat number one and you did another dna test you say well this is grain of wheat number one which is which and so genesis chapter one i told you i was gonna cover i'm stressed it was at the end in case we don't get all the way to revelation but we'll start with genesis 1 and we'll see if we can get to at least habakkuk but genesis chapter 1 is the beginning of god becoming it isn't the finished picture but it's foreshadowing and as you ponder it god is wanting to tell the story of himself and help you to understand why you're even here and this is a god that is invisible without beginning or end and so you have to find a starting point to tell your story and god starts within the beginning and genesis even the this word that's used as latin it comes from the latin generation or nativity in the greek it means origin or creation or generation it comes from the word to be born and so in the very very book genesis it speaks of a generation of nativity something to be born it's related to the word genos which is race or birth or to beget with its root from gene which is your origin the source or seed or dna so genesis is the dna it's the seed we can go back to that and with the right kind of understanding the right kind of interpretation of the word which only god can give you can begin to see your fabric who you are your identity in genesis in genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth in the beginning god he was before the beginning he did not have his beginning in the beginning but even before the beginning there was just god with nothing else that says and he created the heaven and the earth beginning it means the first the best the chief or the choice part in the very beginning this is when the time this is when a time when something begins the beginning of the time when something happens the act of starting something and it says the introduction is in the beginning god it's elohim it comes from a conjunction a combining of l which means strong one and allah which means bound by an oath so here's el allah the strong one bound by a promise bound by a covenant bound by an oath bound by a promise that he has made bound by a desire he's bound by the strong desire l allah it's elohim you know god was before the beginning and he's described as elohim one who exists by himself bibraham often repeats that phrase one who exists by himself then as he has begin to create and the bible says in genesis chapter 2 verse 4 as he is created he says these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens now before there was anything visible and there was just god elohim the strong one bound by an oath that he is referred to as god but now that there's things that have come to be he's called lord god and lord is jehovah elohim lord god jehovah elohim and jehovah it means the self-existence one but it comes from the word adonai coming from the hebrew hawa adonai adonahi coming from hawai and means to become he said well brother aaron man we've we haven't even gone back to school yet well class is in this is important to understand this a name means something a name reflects a man's character there's something to a name we realize that and so as he gives himself this designation from god to lord god his elohim now married with jehovah jehovah elohim jehovah coming from the root havah which means to become or to exist or become known hava means continually becoming so it's something that's becoming it's something that is existing so god has continually becoming god is unveiling himself he's the god who becomes he was elohim god but now he's jehovah god why because now there's something expressed and it's the invisible god who's now becoming so the becoming god is always unfolding he's the invisible one who reveals himself as he becomes when he was just god with no with no expression then he could not be made known so then god as he begins to create and creates a heavens and he creates an earth and he begins to lay these things out he is now becoming it's the becoming god and brother banham teaches this he says we know that the world is a creation and before there can be a creation there has to be a creator of that creation and this is the principle i want you to catch and this creator expresses himself in the creation it says god creating the creation is expressing himself back in the creation so god is expressing himself in the creation the creator expresses himself by the thing which he creates so if we can go back to genesis 1 and see god's original creation before satan stepped in and changed it we can see god reflecting himself god creating is expressing himself back in creation he says even if we didn't have a bible we would still know that so the bible just sets it in order why because romans 1 20 says the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even as eternal power in godhead romans 1 20 stands for this principle that the invisible things of god are from the creation the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made so if god is invisible he cannot be seen there is still an expression of him in creation so in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth then john picks it up and he looks at seemingly the same beginning in john 1 1 he says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god now whereas genesis says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth john 1 1 takes us perhaps just a skosh back a little bit we say quantum leap sometimes to think of a very uh large leap but it's just an infinitesimal leap it's very small almost indistinguishable so if we could just take a quantum leap back just a small step back john is looking at from this perspective in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and we know all things were made by him so when god created the heavens and the earth in the beginning the word created in the beginning was god the word and so we go back to this point to realize the very first thing that had to transpire is that the invisible god had to form himself into a visible expression called the word he was before the beginning the word before there was ever anything else he was the word but the very first form he takes in a in a condescension is the word logos and this is a very difficult concept to get our heads around that before there was anything there was just god the invisible god there was nothing else and when you think about someone being alone you think about that person uh being expressed within some sort of space and you think of someone oh they're all alone at home and so you think of a person at home alone and you think of dimensions and space and three-dimensional uh four four dimensions of walls and height and depth and you'd see all these things because this is this is how someone exists they exist within space and time but god did not exist within space and time he was just god light time space matter did all these different dimensions didn't even exist yet it was just god himself he was the dimension he was the existence he was the only thing there was and he's invisible and so god could have created something and then there just would have been that with no relation so god in order to bri to express himself and to give order he first forms himself and brother brahm says then when he come out there was nothing he says in there he'd come to the logos there's nothing the invisible had nothing but then there's something and this establishes god's pattern of unfolding he unfolds from the invisible to the visible and and i wanted perhaps to preach this this thought this is what i personally wanted to preach this morning i wasn't given that option to do so would have been disobedient but i wanted to preach on how the unfolding of the invisible how that god is invisible and then he forms himself into a visible form and then he establishes the pattern from then on that god always moves from the invisible to the visible and once he had brought man to creation and on earth in a visible form and he had worked from invisible spiritual to in the flesh and that's god's pattern then he got it perfectly in order visibly expressed harmony of the invisible supernatural with the physical invisible harmony between the heavens and the earth everything's perfect operating in harmony when satan comes and interrupts that harmony god now has to work from the physical to the invisible and that's why with israel everything was natural they were given a natural land they were given a natural circumcision they had natural sacrifices and then when their messiah came he was a physical natural messiah but once the messiah came he revives the invisible original from genesis 1 28 from genesis 3 15 and now god can work invisibly on the heart of a man and bring them a new birth and become a new creation without anything happening visibly to someone's eyes there stands a new creature in christ jesus and now he works from the invisible and he's been working as in the church to bring her to a place where even the bride of jesus christ receives an invisible union and receives a supernatural spiritual messiah before we physically meet him in the air and come back in the next coming upon a physical earth for a physical millennium with a physical messiah i got to preach it it only took me two minutes but that's god's pattern so he says and remember the creator expresses himself in the creation there's nothing but god there's nothing visible tangible see you could see but he says then there comes from that the logos it was the logos that went out of god he says there he was plain out there in space just like a child before the door like a son playing before the father like a son playing before the father we can't try to take our understanding of father and son and and that paradigm of an individual entity and another individual entity that have different personalities different desires different objectives different goals and impose that upon god now becoming the logos and then seeing two different personalities or even use the phrase which is catholic uh eternal sonship but it's the invisible god now fully expressed in the logos he says it's like a son playing before the father why he came out from the invisible like a child he's saying he says i can see him draw the whole picture in his mind of the kingdom and what it might be as soon as the logos comes forth he's drawing the whole picture in his mind of the kingdom and what it might be in question and answers in august of 1964 he says the logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of god so the logos is an attribute of the fullness of god when god become into a form to where it could be seen it was the anointing of the great spirit that went forth it's condescending coming down so the logos is god coming down into a visible form and it's that visible form that creates the heavenlies and the supernatural order of angels and worship and all the hierarchy of heaven but he's now in a form that angels can see and can appear before him and there's some sort of relation and connectivity to it but yet it's not that form that he wants to relate to man in and so he's saying that this he's when god become into a form where it can be seen it's condescending coming down and christ identified the same in all generations as he spoken it was the word and the word is made manifest and as the word is made manifest it's god becoming material so this is odd all of god becoming material becoming tangible he says in identification 64. god came down the character of god was in christ he was the reflection he was god made visible god made visible so you can see how his conditioning down now he achieves it in the flesh of christ it says in the beginning was god he wasn't even god before then god is an object of worship the only thing he was was the eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were expressed to words and a word was made manifest so you have god who's invisible forms himself into a logos that becomes the word because it's the invisible mind person entity god be informed in the logos so once it's expressed it becomes word says it's all god becoming tangible what we see in the old testament what we see in the even in jesus christ what we see is god wanting to become tangible he says it's all god becoming tangible and you are a part of god and jesus come to redeem those that were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world it was god's thoughts and that's what he came to redeem god's thoughts brother said are not like your our thoughts his thoughts are real and they are eternal so this gives an eternal quality to the elect to where you have i know it's difficult to try to understand i know you can't fully wrap your mind around it and yet it doesn't it's not in the same vein of pre-existence of souls and the same vein of eternal sonship but you being in god in the beginning have an eternal quality his thoughts are real and they are eternal and you are forever linked link to those original thoughts he said those are the ones that come to redeem as soon as it strikes to them they see it because the life is in there but if life isn't there then what can they do see they don't see it they'll never see it and the whole thing jesus says at that day at that day you'll know that i am in the father and the father and me and i in you and you and me now there's a riddle for you i am in the father and the father in me and then i in you and you and me you can't unpack that you can't unwind that turn that around every single different way you can and try the it find the end from the beginning who's in who who's which i am in the father and the father is in me i and you and you and me that's not a russian doll you can just unpack and say well here you this just just you just line it up this way no this one goes in that one and the one that you just put in that one's got to go inside that one and then you got to take the one in that one and put it in this one and then this one put inside that one [Applause] hallelujah that's who you are [Music] at that day you're going to know i and you and you and me i am in the father the father me i you and you me the whole thing is god becoming material not just in christ christ and the father the father in christ but now i and you and you and me it's god becoming material like a husband and wife becoming one god and his church becoming one [Music] the becoming god unfolding and manifesting listen to the scripture that he quotes at that day you shall know that i am in the father the father and me i and you and you and me the whole thing is god becoming material like god and his bride john 14 19 to 20 yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live you shall live also now the prophet catches an inspiration and a prophecy in this and it is the rising of the sun in paragraph 97 he quotes this because i live ye live also but he doesn't say speaking to his disciples he says speaking to his wife here he is speaking to his disciples they can receive a truth of it compound meaning compound truth they receive a truth of it but now there's yet a prophetic utterance that comes forth from the bridegroom itself because i live ye live also he says because i live ye shall live also what is he doing he's prophesying of the wife when brother branham quotes it because i live ye live also why we've not it's not shall but you do it's not shall but you do live speaking to his wife what was it he's speaking now because i live you will live and now because i am living because i'm alive you are alive also because i live you live also he says what a resurrection that that was what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power that's what snatched you from death to life that's what lets you see his coming quickening power did this who's he speaking to his wife so brother bam takes john 14 19 because i live ye shall live also because i live my bride lives also speaking to his wife brings us to hosea chapter two i will no longer call you a bahali which is a an oh to balaam and babylonian deities but i will call you ishi which is to be married and i'll take away the names of balaam out of your mouth and they will be reno remember no more in your name i'm going to give you your new name i'm going to give you a new identity i'm going to kill your old husband he's dead he's been divorced i'm going to put that old woman away and in that day i'll be married to my wife and she'll be called is she she shall be called mary i'm speaking to my wife [Music] i ran into a very uh a very discouraging situation one time when i was in central america ministering and i was sitting down with a very wonderful evangelist who travels constantly all over the uh this one country uh dozens of churches a year very very faithful and they have regular ministers meetings uh every every month they've been doing this for decades and um i said and i asked d what what kind of things do you guys kind of go back and forth on is there ever any real good discussion maybe disagreements or arguments he says oh no we never we never have any arguments or disagreements and i was like okay i mean for my closest minister friends that i feel like i see just eye to eye on on things we still have things that we look at a little bit differently and so there's a back and forth even sometimes it might appears if there's an argument consider this consider that turning things over and talking this guy said no never never an argument i thought are you guys really even having meetings and he said you know one time we did have a disagreement he said a minister was teaching that in this remember that he speaks spanish he's speaking to me in english he says a minister one time was teaching that the bride is actually married to christ now and it's his wife instead of just a bride and i and i said wait a minute there was a disagreement over there i said also somebody doesn't believe their wife goes no this brother was saying that we're married that we are his wife not his bride and i said so help me out understand what is the bride translated to in the message by your translators he said bride in our spanish translation is novia which is girlfriend and not esposa which is wife and so you have almost a whole language that has not caught the revelation that we're not merely a girlfriend or a fiancee or engaged to christ but the union has come and we're not just a bride in waiting but it's her day of union and she's now wife so he says because i live ye shall live also continue in verse 20 john 14 20 at that day ye shall know when you become wife at that day ye shall know that i am in my father in ye and me and i in you he's speaking prophecy now now there's it doesn't mean to say that there wasn't some understanding and some light that was shed upon these verses and some reality that existed within the believer's heart or even some truth that was so but he's saying at that day ye shall know now if we want to at least establish that it has always been i in you ye and me and i and the father has always been that way i am in the father i you and me and i in you even though it's always been that way he's saying now it's going to come a time where we know this is the reality we understand the implications of it we understand the consequence of it we understand the purpose of it and we fulfilled the promise and the potential of john 14 20. so i i i'm not trying to express this to establish oh they didn't have it it wasn't so but we must understand that brother adam took john 14 20 and he cemented it as prophecy for this hour that the full reality and comprehension of it does not take place until you came to be until you came to understand until you came into this union he says in christ is a mystery god revealed god making himself known we're not supposed to make converts to christianity by a government but by revelation christ in you as god was in christ and god was in christ christ in you when what god did in christ christ does in you what signs god did in christ christ doesn't you oh isn't that beautiful oh my i like that jesus said at that day that's this day at that day when this revelation is made known you will know that i am in the father and the father and me i and you and you and me when the revelation is made manifest at that day ye shall know that i and the father are one i am in the father and the fathers and me then the revelation comes forth then it's i in you and you and me there you are the threefold manifestation the threefold manifestation at that day when the revelation is made known at that day when the revelation is made manifest when the revelation comes forth then it's i on you and you and me there you are the threefold manifestation what for to bring it back we've got to be so brother bam takes john 14 20 and he establishes how this is god becoming tangible is now at that day it's i in you in you and me that brings us to revelations 3 20. behold i stand at the door knock if any man will open i will come into him and he to me and i will sup with him and he with me oh my i feel good i haven't even preached an hour yet i feel like we're just this is just going great you know don't be discouraged about wearing a mask it's just god and morphe right i mean always changing our mask genesis chapter 2 verse 8 and i can tell you're smiling even though you have mask on it's really awkward traveling with a mask you sit next to a little kid and you want to smile out and make them laugh but you just come across looking really creepy what you try to do with your eyes to get a little kid to laugh with the mask on genesis chapter 2 verse 8 i feel like maybe i've laid my foundation and now i want to go back to see the creator express himself in the creation this becoming god god becoming material it's all god becoming tangible the whole thing is god becoming material like a husband and wife at that day you shall know i and you and you and me and then i am in the father at that day speaking to his wife god making himself known when the revelation is alone the revelation is made manifest so i want to look for a moment at the word that we're completing the threefold purpose of god made manifest in adam and the woman the completion of that word of every seed bringing forth of its kind to see what god was planning for in his future what he's looking for in his future as the creator expresses himself back in creation in genesis chapter 2 verse 8 i see this as being kind of the climax of the physical creation as far as the earth it says in genesis chapter 2 verse 8 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden god now plants a garden eastward and the word eastward means in the beginning in eden although it would have a geographical context directional context and we would relate eastward but it also holds this meaning that when god created was bringing forth eden at the very beginning he planted a garden eastward in eden and brother bannon goes to great lengths in different places to establish that you have eden then you have the garden in eden and he says that adam and the woman were thrust out of the garden but yet in the fall they lived in eden they just didn't have access to the garden of eden so it represented something very special to god as a matter of fact the world that god loved was the garden in eden the world that god loved was the original eden condition everything in perfection everything operating in perfect harmony otherwise we'd have a real big conflict when he says love not the world or the things of the world because if you do the love of god is not in you yet the bible says for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son you have to understand the world that god loved and the world that he gave his son to redeem was this original order in this original world not the perversion and the cosmos that comes after it not even the wheat plant and everything that unfolds after it god's original love and aspiration was enveloped in and made manifest in this garden that he planted in the beginning in eden that's the treasure hit in the field which you are you're that pearl of great price none of us found christ and hit him in the earth and went and sold everything and come back and dug him up and bought the field but he did for what the treasure in the field you're the treasure in the field so he atoned for the sins of the whole world he atoned for everything past present and future but what did he do it for for the elect seed that was in it that's the parable to understand the parable of that great treasure and that great pearl so the lord god planted a garden eastward in the beginning in eden and then notice this great description here and there he put the man whom he had formed god is expressing himself in creation he's actually hiding a mystery in the earth and what he's creating and brother branham says this and satan's eden having faith in all his word his seeds he brought an eden of holiness love and eternal life that's what god's eden produced holiness and it brought an eden of holiness of love understanding perfection and eternal life that's what god let me just stop and say this there's many different ways he describes it perfect understand the love of god perfect love all around no death he describes it a lot of different layers of how perfect this eden was he said that's what god is planting his word his seed that is what his church will be at the end it'll be the same thing brother branham is specifically connecting the bride in the end time to what the eden was in the beginning what the garden of eden was in the beginning the bride is at the end he's connecting the bride now to a garden of eden condition he said that's what christ is the mystery god revealed us for to bring her back to the position with her husband again to bring her back to the original condition he says in the garden of eden so it's not just a location i've got to go find the river euphrates i got to go find that fertile ground there somewhere in the middle east no don't think of a geographical location don't get hung up on that just yet just walk in the footsteps of the righteous just walk in the path as the light goes forward you'll end up there if there's a geographical location but right now this is a spiritual position and the garden of eden was a spiritual condition a supernatural relationship a harmony between the physical and the supernatural everything operating perfect harmony and it was a condition and the revealed word brother branham is preaching and especially what he's teaching a crisis of mystery is to bring us who are in these pesthouses back to the original condition of spiritual harmony and union with the supernatural and actually have what is the fullness of redemption and have a fullness of a relationship with christ even before this body is redeemed that's what the church will be at the end it'll be the same thing so the prophet has connected these things perfectly together now now that we're in the afternoon i'm going to start skipping a little bit but brother brahman satan's eating goes on to talk about a beautiful spot laying east of eden called the garden of eden he said god made the world's headquarters in the garden it says god out old maid finally arrived with its headquarters in a beautiful spot laying east in eden he says it was a perfect it was perfect peace perfect harmony everybody everything in perfection and he says this he says that's what god did he put his son and his wife over all of it he put them in full control they could speak to the winds and it would cease to blow they would speak to the tree and it'd move from here to there who would they would it was just perfect he placed his beloved children his son and his daughter a husband and wife to control it and what the bride is at the end will be the same thing connecting them together so what was in the garden of eden is foreshadowing the bride of christ and christ and even the perfect eden that will be in eternity but this garden the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden this garden that god plants represents the bride because a garden in scripture is figurative of a spouse in saul in the song of solomon chapter 4 verse 12 a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse isn't this beautiful my sister my spouse it's the same dna it's the re it's to be brought out of the man it's described in a way that we see the original the man and the woman the woman brought out of the man she is the bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she is now a mirror image of him and now the scripture speaking even in this very spiritual supernatural way the garden enclosed is my sister my spouse verse 15 a fountain of gardens a well of living waters a stream from lebanon so awake on north wind and come thou south blow upon my garden that the spices there it may flow out notice how the bridegroom is now speaking to his bride speaking to the one he loves you are like a garden my spouse all wins blow and let the spices be fragrant let them blow and now notice what the bride speaks back let my beloved come into his garden and eat his pleasant fruits the bride is like a garden a woman a spouse is likened into a garden and here the bridegroom describes her as a garden but then she cries out all come into the garden and eat it by present pleasant fruits and then chapter five begins with this i am come into my garden my sister my spouse song of solomon painting a beautiful picture of here's a beautiful garden and a and the husbandman coming into the garden which is figurative of a wife and a spouse and brother and the bible speaks the beginning the lord god planted a garden in the beginning of eden this garden of eden represents the bride of jesus christ in the last days represents her position and her condition in the last days and she says oh let my beloved come into his garden he says i am come into my spouse i am come down into her in genesis 2 15 it says the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it notice the very image of how the man is placed into the garden the guard being figurative of a wife he places the man into the garden and what does he do to the garden he dresses it and keeps it this is the very image that paul draws upon in ephesians chapter 5 verses 25 to 33 32 where he speaks about the mystery of christ and the oneness with his bride he's somehow a man loves his wife and washes her and keeps her and cherishes her wife he's a husband i the lord do water it i will keep it night and day she is a vineyard this is the very thing that now adam is doing in the garden it's representative of a husband i will dress it in the word i will keep it night and day the lord took the man whom he had formed and put him in the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it birdman says what the garden was then the church is the same thing in the end it'll be the same thing and there he put the man whom he had formed and there he put the man and put him in the garden of eden and brother branham and christ revealed in his own word says now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence what is it the very thing that we see in genesis chapter two the very thing we see we in song of solomon is a very thing that happens in the hour we're living in now he himself has stepped into that he says it's god himself it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like adams was at the beginning he brings it right back to the beginning it says how the woman was brought out of his side it comes back to the same picture in the end that the bride comes forth in this radiant glory what is it who is it it's god himself becoming to that place just as in the beginning he took this beautiful garden and he took the man that he had formed which was in the image of god and there he placed the man it's exactly what god had in his mind that one day i'll have a garden which is my bride in satan's eden and i will step down into his eden like he did in the mine and i will step into her and i will give her a sacred charge for redemption because i'll let the serpent use the woman for the fall i will save the woman for the end for redemption and she and she alone will be given a sacred charge for the fullness of redemption where is that redemption today it is in the bride of jesus christ why because christ is in here my i know these things have been preached before and i think i've preached it here before too because i think i've i've preached here enough to where i just said you know what i'm probably preaching something but i just got to do it just do it but listen to the i see how beautiful it is god takes six thousand years and creates this perfect eden and the perfection of eden he places as long as the woman was in the man she couldn't be tempted and so in that in that one there's perfect immunity not no temptation at all but now that he takes the woman out now brother branham says she wasn't another creation because if it had been another creation would have been greater so she comes as a byproduct and he uses that word in a sense that might seem to be a little bit of a derogatory but he's wanting us to understand that it's not another creation it's a byproduct of the man and it made her vulnerable and god placed her on that basis one minister told me that a woman is a byproduct and so she buys products and so he takes the woman out of the man and now the woman being out from the man he placed her brother and says on the basis that she could fall but then he says he places you on the basis that you cannot fall and that's god even the redeeming the woman in the end because he put her on that basis of free more agency to allow her to be tempted and what happens is satan a spiritual being inhabits the flesh of a human-like serpent a beast and inhabits possessing his flesh he causes him to preach a sermon that traps into the mind of a woman then drops down into her heart and by that under by that quickening it actually brought forth death and death said immediately when she received that thought into her mind and then she begins to act upon that that instinct and act upon that death and she sold it into her race she sows it into humankind and it causes the whole thing to fall and then when when the judgment is going forth and he begins to speak judgment upon different he curses the servant he curses curse the man he curses the woman he curses the serpent and then the earth what did the earth do he curses the earth along with it and then it's from that very earth that abel wants the cain wants to bring for sacrifice but yet god is expressing things and all these different things are taking place and he curses the serpent and he says i'm gonna there's gonna be a seed of the woman that's gonna crush your head so what's satan looking for the first son because it says he he and what is the first thing he do he murders that seed so he's always been looking for the seed after that but this is what happens after six thousand years death lies and perversion enters in god's perfect eden so then god lets six thousand years come and allows satan to build his eden his eden of quote unquote perfection his eden of unrighteousness he gets it where he wants it and now when satan finally has his eden god himself comes down inhabits the flesh of a redeemed son of god who preaches a sermon and a woman hears it and once that's quickened to her heart it actually is going to bring to pass the final climax wherein we defeat death and we avenge the blood of abel that's why creation is grown in hallelujah to be delivered into the glorious liberty of the sons of god while they weren't meant to be ruled by the nonsense that's out there now and they were cursed in the beginning having done nothing but yet it logs to see you come to your position in christ it longs to see the manifestation of the sons of god and to be delivered into the glorious liberty of manifested sons and daughters of god god waited two thousand six thousand years to do to satan exactly what he did in his eden it's becoming to a place there's nothing left except for him to step into it i will sow her unto me in the earth god planted a bride at the beginning before satan ever got to the woman he had already sowed you into the earth and it sealed up the womb of the earth as it was and the earth was pregnant with the bride and nothing could destroy it nothing could harm that until the last seed comes to expression before satan could ever even get to you he'd already sown you brother branham says in the beginning of the creation he says in a notice not it not august of 65 in the beginning of the creation of god when he began to create and bring you into existence you started back there's a seed and worked down to where you are now in the beginning when god created he began to bring you into existence you started back there's a seed and worked down to where you are now and then you were all in christ and in christ he died to redeem all of you and you are a part of this word god is expressing himself the creator is expressing himself in the creation and we see it expressed now i don't know if that's a sign but the clock fell down up here okay it's like it's 51-21 what is that 12 15. now just to take a step further after he says there he placed the man that he had formed now you have a man in the garden but look at the expression though it expresses some type and shadow though it expresses the bride of christ and christ in the midst of her now there's still that's something not that's not quite right and the lord god said after he'd been good good good creates man it's very good but now the first time this word is ever uttered in this sense and the lord god said it is not good but what was not good is it was not good that man should be alone i will make him a help meet for him god's expression is not complete man was in the very image of god but the image held a mystery just like god did in the beginning and so the bible says he took a rib which the lord god had made taken from the man he takes that rib and made he a woman so now when the woman is made he says and brought her unto the man and brother madam says that's what the church is doing today for jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the brightest part of the groom therefore the word that's to be fulfilled in this day is part of the same word that was fulfilled in his day and it's the same word same experience same life this isn't siege it's not here with the shock for when god separated adam he was both male and female and then genesis 2 and on he created a man out of the dust of the earth man was created in god's image god is a spirit so he's a spirit man then when he become flesh animal flesh on the earth he is showing portraying here the bride therefore part of his spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to christ so when he says when the woman came out of the man what was god portrayed he was once again portraying the bride [Applause] god is showing us something that we can sow identify ourselves with the original so identify ourselves with scripture that we can't read it without thinking that's me this is something he wanted me to see me to know me to draw from he is showing portraying here the bride and what is happening in this very dynamic as brother madam preaches these great mysteries after the seals are open we have a prophet bringing her the bride to the man just as it says in genesis 22 and he made a woman and brought her unto the man this is the ministry of elijah the minister of elijah is to take the woman and bring her face to face with god brother branham said in voice of the sign he says notice john immediately he's saying hey one day the lambs come in one day's land so the next day he says behold the lamb and i said what changed the attraction was now the prophet the prophet's prophecy and he says and john immediately said he must increase i must decrease he presented the church to christ and we're told in the last days that we'll repeat again and it has repeated again brother branham introduced the woman to the man he has introduced this as this woman that was a spouse he has introduced the bride to her mate the revealed word that's why he appeared the way he did in this hour is that you would know your mate the revealed word the introduction has been made the friend of the bridegroom rejoices the prophet's joy is complete because he has made the introduction brother branham is not rolling over in his grave brother branham is not restless to come back brother branham rejoices because he hears the voice of the bride with her bridegroom his ministry is fully authenticated his ministry is fully vindicated his ministry has been thoroughly confirmed he has done what he was commissioned to do he has introduced the bride to jesus christ [Applause] he's presented us to christ and christ will take us the rest of the way isn't that what he did in the first church he took them john handed them off the very same disciples peter and different ones were disciples of john i said i'll take him from here and that's what vindicated john's ministry and he took them to the climax of their day which is the new birth in an upper room and christ is here taking us to the climax in our day which is a new body and a meeting in the air brother branham said in earnestly continuing for the faith the first one to end now this is you've got to follow the layers here he presented the church to christ program says the first one to introduce the faith for the christian church was none other than jesus himself he was the introduction of the faith that was to be handed to the christian church now we've got to think with understanding think spiritually about the faith of our pentecostal fathers think spiritually about the faith those members had that when they were gathered into the upper room this wasn't hearsay this wasn't just what mama said but their messiah had appeared to them and continually appeared to them and was with them and walking amongst them and manifest himself until they were at the place for the climax when the promise would come and brother ram says it's christ they introduced the faith to the pentecostal fathers and so how is it today that we're going to be restored back to the faith of the original pentecostal fathers unless it's christ himself who introduces that faith back to us he is the dynamics and the dynamics are up to him it's he himself fulfilling the promise for today looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith i am the alpha and the omega and brother brown says we come to the church's dispensations end time that's what i read tomorrow tonight it shall be light in the evening time we've had plenty of dismal time but there shall come light the same eson the same sun that came and changed the dispensation then comes again and so when the woman was brought into the man adam is just he's met with this inspiration genesis 22 chapter 2 verses 23 and 25. this is now bone of my bones flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she's taken out of the man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed what is he portraying he's portraying here the bride brother abraham says it is the rise of the sun he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others have spoke of the bride it can only manifest it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him this is what adam speaks prophetically brother branham when he describes when the woman was brought to the man and i wish i would have taken the statement with me to the pulpit but he said the very first time the man ever looked at that woman he said it struck him and he said and that still reverberates within mankind today the affinity the connection the draw the attraction of a man to a woman even in her falling condition it began the very first time adam ever saw the woman it put such a charge such a striking atom that it shook into its very dna into his very core and no matter how much it's been mingled and mongrelized and hybrid through thousands of years it still resonates and vibrates within a man today that image of a woman why because it was something that was fully from the man it was everything that had been with him everything he fellowshipped around everything he thought about what he longed for and didn't know he had put such a strike in him why because she is him and he told him he had given a commandment now it's 12 23 so i'm very conscious of the time the when god says let us make man in our image he first formed some spiritual being and he gives them a command be fruitful multiply replenish the earth subdue it have dominion over it control it it's very very broad powers and controls very broad job description then he forms them in flesh and he puts the spirit man in the flesh and then when god says it's not good that man should be alone i will make a help meet for him he immediately begins to describe how that adam was working in the garden and he says he went to all the animals the animals came to him and he named all the animals what they were so when he says i'll make a help me form one to aid him in his cause one that's complementary to him for his commission and his purpose it actually means a second self it means another self as if in a mirror so it's not the same it's equal but opposite she was co-equal with him they could speak they could control she was complementary to his purpose and suited to help him finish his job and they had to be fruitful multiply and replenish which means fill it up to completion it didn't mean have babies till there's no more room it was just there was a set thing in god's mind to set order away seeds that needed to be expressed and come forth that's why brother branham says seemingly hypothetically she would eventually brought forth christ why because he had a full replenish of filling up that's when there's enough that's when my thoughts have been expressed but then as so adam though is still doing a work without the expression of the woman he's naming the beast of the field he's naming all the fouls there he's given them all names but as he's naming them all he sees the reflection in them of something that's not yet manifest yet for himself he found no mate yet for himself he found no one to help him though he's naming male female male female male female but then god inserts that into the time when he describes the woman coming forth because he wanted to realize the woman is for a purpose he want to understand it was to aid adam in fulfilling his commission and his charge be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth so adam could do a lot by himself but there was one thing he couldn't do without the woman and that was multiplier and so this is part of god's original purpose not just a man not just a woman but a man and a woman and a reproduction of the man he he utters forth in prophecy therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh this is part of the original word what does it signify a word that signifies that there's to be more to this masterpiece therefore shall a man leave his father he's speaking it prophetically this is the word that was never finished by adam and the woman this is what you're facing today that's why brother brown begins to talk about the bride being pregnated and bringing the full word into manifestation because he says the first son adam was the spoken seed word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god that's what the woman is for the woman is to reproduce the son of god that is what the bride was given to adam he was given he had a work to do but he could not finish the work he was given without the woman so genesis 1 28 required a wife and in this we see god the creator expressing himself in the creation but it says when god made this man there was something about him yet that didn't look just right because he had been by himself and that's how god had been by himself he was eternal and now man in the image of god also existed on earth by himself so he struck a blow over on the left side and from there he took a piece off of it and made a help meet a wife then he wasn't by himself he had somebody with him that's his great work this is god expressing himself in creation listen god when he did this to adam was showing that i will from myself bring forth a woman i'm portraying it in the beginning because he saw adam oh he's something like me i see myself so i will bring out of adam that hidden part because i have a woman hidden in me god is expressing himself in creation what god wanted to become is expressed in the beginning what god wanted to become he expresses in the beginning brother brown said the very creator that created the earth for a purpose satan defiled it what did satan defile he didn't defile the earth the very creator that created the earth for a purpose satan defiled the purpose he says in the church age but the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world so god's heart purpose and his eternal purpose was to take a bride of his own choosing heart purpose the thing that was central to god the thing that made him who he was when somebody has a heart purpose his eternal purpose is to have a bride of his choosing this wasn't god wanting to play doll this wasn't god trying to play house but the world is not god's sandbox we're not his beach party where he's just building something and see what happens oh look at the waves did this oh look what happened and god is just playing games with a bunch of human beings no god had a passion god had a desire god had a purpose his heart purpose the very thing that was central to god the very thing that identified his passion the very thing that identified his exercise existence his eternal purpose was to have a bride of his own choosing and it was that burning passion that climaxed into a place where he finally said i must have a bride and it was that part purpose that thrust god into a visible expression called the logos and then the full manifestation of all his attributes are the heart purpose of that logos so that every act every movement every word everything he's doing must meet that goal and that end the heart purpose of god was have a bride of his own choosing he wrote it this way it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride wow that's what he wanted he wanted a word bride it was god's purpose to bring forth the people like himself that would be a word bride and for god to have what he wanted or to fulfill his purpose he had to become he couldn't just merely have he couldn't just create and have what he wanted he had to become to get what he wanted is that brother lonnie would say god didn't just want to have a family wanted to become a family it was god's purpose to bring forth the people like unto himself so christ is a mystery god revealed he says but he what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way he could express it was to become a son of man so he wanted to be a father and the only way he could be a father was to become a son and he wanted a wife right he wanted to be a husband that's what he wanted and the only way that he could be a husband was to become a wife this is god becoming it's the only way that he he he can be known he can be felt he has to become it's not somebody we just talk about it's just not someone we worship it's somebody who's becoming you the word has been made flesh now flesh is being made word to complete god's perfect picture oh what a love story the only way he could express is to become a son of man that's why jesus kept saying son of man they didn't know what he was talking about but now you get it he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal christ secondly to have preeminence in his body of believers that his bride that they might he might live in people listen the second purpose really isn't unlike the first god being expressed in one the firstborn the bridegroom jesus christ now the same god having preeminence in the individual members of the body of christ to bring forth a body a bride to which the bridegroom is the head of now this is the thought i've been building to try just to give context to these several things i want to read and try to get through very quickly to close and it is the rise of the sun and i know you've been thinking about this statement over and over again some of you but notice what leads to this statement who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the word of god by by the word of god by signs by wonders we see today in quotes luke 17 30 he refers to malachi chapter four he said that word again is waived over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead the son of god is alive again with the baptismal holy spirit right among us and giving us life as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept so it's christ the bridegroom in the bride coming of christ now however you want to diagram this however you want to put the comma and if you were to do a sentence diagram it's all going to end up in the same place in the bride coming of christ a coming of christ in the bride or the bride coming of christ however you want to look at it the truth remains the same coming out of the church there'll have to be a sheep waved again in the last days so he refers to this concept and i don't believe that brethren is just tripping over his words and accidentally saying something in the bride coming of christ in the bride the coming of christ into her he's to return back again it is people in human beings you are the expression of his coming today embrace it don't let the critics chase you away from it that's our secret that's why there's power that's why there's manifestations of healing that's why we can stand above the nonsense that's why we can walk into a new body because we've received the promised word for this day [Applause] in the bride coming of christ and then he revisits it in paragraph 29 242 remember he went there with you in him talking about on the cross god never separated the bride from the groom yet so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body they are one same same word same word spoke of the groom speaks of the bride don't you dare try to separate the bride from christ you cannot make them two separate things they have got to be viewed the same word that speaks of the groom it speaks of the bride he says those same words spoke of the groom speaks of the bride well how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride [Applause] [Music] how could he how could he come and not be the bride this is the part that was missing we see christ the word god fully manifested in one man but there had to be the full expression of the word and the woman and we are now the climax of that body that's been building from the moment the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost god began to make up his body and you're the capstone to that body you're married to that first outpouring that point is part of you every age is the age of the holy ghost to the true believer we cannot separate ourselves from it but we must recognize the word today that's being fulfilled and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride god of this evil age he says the word bride heading up in the person of the word of god made manifest in this evil age the word bride is the heading up of the person of the word heading up in the person of the word of god all right it's so wonderful christ revealed in his own word now in this last days he has promised to manifest himself in the fullness again of his flesh in spirit for as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now look at the sodom how it's set in what taken place and jesus christ being manifested in bodily form of his church today it's the becoming god he said god was in the beginning he kept coming down through the prophets and on down until god himself became human like us plumbed down at the foot of the ladder a baby born in the manger hated rejected despised and a bad name and everything he was then he started rising and from the feet he began to build the church the bride coming back and now coming into the headstone where it all joins together and makes that one great transfigured body of jesus christ can you see now why he says and christ is a mystery god revealed she has now risen by the power the vindicated word promised to her not just risen from the dark ages but from the beginning from his bosom from his heart from the very thoughts to flesh she's now risen she now stands on her feet and i'm going to read through this very quickly now christ is a mystery god revealed i'm going to hit him real fast now god's great secret he had before the world begin back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and go is going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed so this is something in the back part of god's mind something that he's going to achieve he says in the countdown he says and he's able to achieve to himself a bride he is going to in the last days be able to get a bride that with the ministry that so exactly like a man and his wife becomes one and when jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one it fulfills the scripture he quotes john 14 12 luke 17 30. it's actually fulfilling hosea 2 23. it fulfills revelations 21. he's able to achieve himself a bride back in the back part of god's mind there was something he's trying and going to achieve what does he say there's going to come a super royal seat of abraham there's to be a spiritual bride raise up she's to come on the scenes in the last days and talking about the sheep being waved from all the prophets there came the son of god so after all the prophets and the jewish old church ages there came christ the lord the sheep waving but he says there's been many churches churches brides brides churches brides brides but there's got to come one hallelujah there has to come a real bride there must come one that's got the mechanics but the dynamics also makes that church live and move in the power of his resurrection what there had to be another one waved how is he waved in the flesh of his bride again there has to come a real bride why because there was something in the back part of god's mind something that he was trying to achieve he says he's achieved himself a bride paragraph 203 of christ's mystery and those things typed him just in tight but yet the mystery was hid so even though things typed him there was a mystery hid them men didn't know what they were doing they only knew what they were led by the spirit to do now holding it back in the last days for the great revelation but expressing himself in moses david joseph elijah on down through didn't he say the church ages manifested reflected and foreshadowed the coming of a perfect bride just as the old testament reflected the coming of a perfect bridegroom he says yes we could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives out and show it expressed jesus christ perfectly yet never given a secret in full waiting for it to be make known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehensive before he could express it if he told the whole thing but what's the only part that's missing the bride that was in him in his first expression he'll have it have to manifest himself in christ so god in the first purpose of the threefold purpose fully manifest himself in christ and we can say that's very good but then god would say it's not good because they're still yet a wife in him because there's a wife in me and in order for me to be a husband which christ is i must also become the wife in order to have what i always wanted in my heart it's the becoming god he says it was never given out in full waiting for it to be fully comprehended before he could express it so he says it's all the last days when this great mystery that god had in his heart is being revealed what's the mystery he had in his heart to have a bride of his own choosing to have a woman like unto himself now that is asking a lot i want a woman who is just like me is what god said and there's only one person who could do that god himself [Music] continue christ's mystery now when christ in the church is just be christ in the church is just being made known wait huh what it's just now being made known something different than what it was before he was he was in it he was there but now this prophecy this scripture this day this fulfillment is just being made known the whole thing is the revelation of god to take eve back to the right position again with her husband and god is the husband of the church and the church is his bride i'm just sharing these so you can hear christ is the mystery god in that context of what i've of this hour and a half i've been preaching already he says christ life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ and the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do you cannot elevate christ at the expense of his bride to do so means you're not lifting up christ if you lift up christ at the expense of his body what christ are you lifting up it must be another gospel it has to be another jesus because you cannot lift up christ without drawing the bride unto him if i be lifted up my wife will be drawn unto me because she is me she's my bone she's my life she's my flesh she's my power and he comes to the very end paragraph 4 57 elohim god manifest in flesh jesus showing that he himself god and him will be manifested in his bride in the last days what was the sign what was the symbol what was that meeting with abraham he stepped down into earth angels what was he doing he's never done this before like this he's created a body here he is elohim is walking with angels they've made bodies too and he's coming up to abraham he says i want to show you something i'm going to send two messengers down into laodicea but i'm going to stay up here with abraham in the elect group i'm going to talk to abraham because one day there's going to be a branham that i'm going to use to speak to my elect and i'm going to give a sign to sarah in the tent behind me and the very first thing they ask about when they come up to abraham was where's your wife listen there was only one who had a message for her but the others were talking about her but there was only one hallelujah only one that had a message for her so the other two had to go down in laodicea but the one who had a message for her remained hallelujah and i will visit the according to the time of life and he came to her and she conceived and brought forth the sun what was he foreshadowing the bride in the last days that's pregnant with the word and brings forth jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he has visited you according to the time of life elohim what was he showing that he himself god and him will be manifested in the bride in the last days oh my my just no into it just a revelation of god it's eternal it just keeps moving on and on and on like this sermon i forgot to tell you guys at the beginning i'm just fishing just fishing today and brother bear said time's not allotted to a man while he's fishing just fishing now let me just in end it with this we'll ask the musicians to come i want to i want to make this personal to you you are now made in things that ought to be december 5th 1965 you are now made you're set in this church because your duty is to express god to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are god knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and he says and what is that word bride i'm glad he asked the questions who is this melchizedek why because he had the answer and what was that word bride what is that word brian the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living you are the message of the hour the reflection of it he says one place you are jesus the reflection that's come up to this the missing part the hidden revelation the missing generation you count the generations in the book of matthew and it says there's forty so forty uh two generations there's one missing you are the missing generation you are the generation of his coming you're the other part that was hidden in him though shown in type and reflected in type and though uh unfolding in different ways to the church ages it now comes to this the full word is to be born into manifestation again brother abraham says the identified masterpiece of god he is making a bride yes sir he's you and the chips now chopping off the world and you got to make this personal it's making a bride chopping off the world oh church joining creed's denominations dogmas all has to be put away from the church their formal ideas their indifference their doctrines their things come back and let the master pick up the ball some of you church has a bad taste in your mouth all because of these creeds church joining dogmas formal ideas and different doctrines and things come back come back let the master pick up the bow that would be my invitation to anyone searching god come back anybody who's been hurt by this message you know we've been hurt by this message and the paradox is the same thing that hurts is the same thing that's going to heal i i just feel compelled to share this the word hurts and it heals and this message can be preached in a way that's very cutting it can itself intend to hurt a and to bring a conviction and bring a sense of guilt but then it can be used to cause the wrong kind of hurt to bring a sense of shame and to abuse us and it causes scars and complex and the very people wielding the quote unquote message of the hour can drive us away but you're going to have to come back to the message for your healing the very thing that caused your greatest pain is the only thing that's probably going to cause that's going to be able to bring the greatest healing bring it to your right mind bring a sense of balance and relief you're never going to find it fighting against the thing that hurts you you're going to have to come to the very thing that he's ordained for you and brother bam tells a story about a couple who had a child dying and because of the death of that child the house became so contentious that they agreed to have a divorce and they separated and they divorced and they had their lawyers and the lawyer told them look you're gonna have to divide up your possessions and they went to that house and brother bamboo dramatized it i'll just embellish it a little bit how they're in there saying well i want the picture no i want this picture i want the bed i want in the fighting going over everything contentious fighting back and forth they finally make it to the attic and they start going through little things they finally pull out a shoe of a baby who died that represented the very thing that ripped them apart that child the death of that child what broke their marriage but it was the very thing that brought them back it was in that face in it confronting it finding the beauty of it the joy of it the very thing that it was and coming back to the original that's what brought the healing again and listen i know it can very be very hard there's things that trigger us there's things that are toxic there's things that we just repulse us and it gets us all anxious in our stomach and nerves but come to the master let them pick up the bow i can say is my own testimony and i apologize for injecting myself but i know the master is here and you've been abused you've been violated and the violin does not seem to give a great sound but oh let the master let the master pick up the bow come back let the master pick you up in his hands and strike the word and say jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen lord if you could just bow your heads i want this to be an unction to somebody oh i think of the young people who've endured so much in this world so much by our own failings as parents so much about our ins and outs and the differences and the things that have transpired and the hurts from within and everywhere else oh there's a master there's a master he says say amen lord make me mold me make me lord what i should be then there'll be a different thing if i be lifted up from the earth i'll draw all men unto me he's cutting you out now cutting you down to his word only cutting all the creeds and dogmas and everything away from you trying to get back to a bride for the son another pastor piece part of the word let me say this to the young couples young families young brothers and sisters even in the youth group this is why things have been hard but man says in christmas why do you hunger why do you thirst it's god trying to get this great revelation to you you won't satisfy it in church joining you're not going to satisfy it in youth camps and youth means it's not going to be satisfied in a harmony among individuals it can only be satisfied in christ jesus couldn't take the place you remember when they read the day in the book he just read part of the prophecy and left the rest for this day the last day were supposed to take that part isn't that powerful jesus couldn't take this part you've got to take it so you see he has to cut he wants to cut the church out just like he did the sun out like he he did the bride and the groom to to be his bride you must be part of him no part of the creed no part of the church not part of the denomination but part of him hewed out of any kind of form won't work you've got to be hewed from the word the world cut off of you just leave the word only live in you the great sculptor is counting on you willing to stand and have you shaped yourself shaped in the likeness of his requirement that his word requires in the last days i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy christ the identified masterpiece of the word made flesh you are asked to identify yourself in him by the same word to be the masterpiece of bride now brethren god had a masterpiece then to present to the world now he wants a masterpiece today are you willing are you ready my christian friend i'm asking today are you willing and are you ready if there's been something strike your heart today are you willing and you're ready could you could you just as an individual the camera's just on me stand your feet and say lord make me mold me make me lord what i should be if you've wondered far from god come back to the master are you willing are you ready my friend are you really sure that your life is so reflecting christ no matter what the world says they say you lost your mind you've gone crazy you went and joined that bunch of holy oils don't pay no attention to that and if you're not really truly saved and in that body and the word of god in you and reflecting itself and the life of christ reflecting out of you brother sister don't you take that chance i don't care what you are what kind of experience you have let that word reflect through you each day because god in the last days has taken a bride for his son jesus christ he says let us bow our heads if there's anyone would want to give their heart to christ today there's still water to baptize lost souls there's still a genuine experience of the baptism the holy ghost upon the seed of god you cannot join church you cannot recite creeds you can't have stacks of quotes that gets you in you've got to know him in the person of the resurrection what is the new birth the revelation of jesus christ personally to you if there's a repentance you could do in your heart if there's a coming back to the master to pick up the bow just surrendered to him today and maybe all of us could say lord help me [Music] help me to be a reflection in this hour i want to pray for those that have stood with our heads bowed i want to pray for these standing and maybe those who are seated can pray with them my gracious pray with us now our gracious heavenly father lord you know the desire in the hearts of those that are standing the lord whatever the unction might be in their heart whether it be from a place of great pain a place of conviction a place of longing to belong lord a place of longing to sense your presence and not wonder and question lord maybe a son coming back home a broken violin to the master i pray that you would receive them today in their need and you would take them as you have so many times before your son and your daughter hold them close to your bosom and assure them that you love them and that you'll care for them and you'll see them through to the end appear to us now according to your promised law that if there be any that are outside the body of christ may they repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the message of their sins holding to the promise to receive the baptism of the holy ghost the quickening of the seed of god in them and may they walk in the newness of life lord may they be born again to see the word may they may they feel you and know you in the forgiveness of

the wife what's in a man's heart is manifesting a wife what a man has planning what he's thinking what really what he is has made manifest in the wife that's why brother branham could preach christ is the mystery god revealed because the bride is the mystery of christ finished that's why you see in revelations 10 7 the mystery of god should be finished because once he achieves a bride to himself the mystery he held in his heart from the beginning is finished and the rest is just housekeeping the rest is just him getting everything got to get the you have that honeymoon and then get the world ready for the eternal eden from that moment that he's achieved himself to a bride taking him to himself the rest is the unfolding to bring us back to that eternal expression where there is no end if

preconceived ideas of what it needs to be to be successful i just know if i completely yield to him success will be what he wants it to be but i know this i'm longing for home and what i want to do is i want to find that herding sheep that lost sheep the wandering soul in arizona and take their hand and walk into a meeting in the air beulah means married i'm longing for that union in the sky where the invisible will finally made perfectly visible for a country to which i named for been before will there be spoken for time old many more and someday holy i'll stand there my hopes shall be [Music]

lies a brand new song of joy [Music] is [Applause] [Applause] shall we [Applause] [Music] oh the whole bible was written for this day the account in genesis genesis 2 genesis 3 it's written for our day [Music] aren't you glad to be alive this day it's amazing how through the foolishness of preaching a preacher can preach words but what strikes us is more than the word something down inside amen and it triggers an emotion but it wasn't something just just on an emotional level it was something that goes all the way to the core of our being and what he was speaking was my identity he's preaching who i am amen not who i am on a birth record not who i am and and the elements of the earth that you see but who i am from the mind of god who i've always been intended to be i'm so thankful for that what was preached today is beyond us talking humanly speaking it's beyond us to be christ to be the expression of god as a wife it's beyond us and i just want to say i'm so thankful it's beyond us because all we could do is mess it up like it's been messed up before it's beyond us so he secured it in his mind before the foundation of the world it is what is happening nothing can defile it nothing can stop it friends all he's asking for us to do is yield to it he's got it all figured out he's got it already worked and he's got the power to perform it all all he's looking is for somebody to say back to him be it unto me according to thy word before we dismiss i just want to share with you a testimony i asked you on wednesday to pray with us for brother jeevaratnam marlapudi the brother in india who is from india who's here last year for two weeks when i got home wednesday night i got a call from his son on an internet call and he says god bless you brother chad thank you so much for your prayers he said my father has made a dramatic turnaround amen he said my the doctor just left so he called me wednesdays said the doctor just left and i'm getting home about 10 10 30 at night the doctors just left and the doctor is a hindu man and the doctor says the medicine did not heal your father he said your god has healed your father amen [Applause] out of the mouth of a hindu doctor he said the medicine i gave won't do that he said that's your god and i just say praise god brother marlon booty's doing better his wife's doing better his eldest son and elle's daughter's still fighting symptoms so remember to pray for them but the god who did it for one will do it for another and thank you for being faithful in your prayers and thankful to our brother and i just so appreciate i so appreciate god so appreciate that he had a plan and he wasn't dependent on me he made a plan secure before the foundation of the world all he did was reveal it to me and when he revealed it to me he unlocked something inside of me that was locked down there under the dirt and under the hybridization and under all of the messed up situations we've come through in families and births and everything else there was something down there that was locked up and when god gave the revelation to this hour he unlocked something and that that he unlocked was his eternal purpose from for the foundation of the world and if we can just yield to that that's working within god is going to accomplish he will absolutely accomplish everything he purpose to accomplish he's going to do it in us it's beyond us and i'm thankful for that how many of you feel to be the most privileged you feel yourself to be the most privileged human being on the face of the earth to be here and to hear the things that we hear no other age no other generation nobody else knew they were going through the motions they were acting it out in time they had no idea but we're not just acting it out everything that's been acted out in type is coming to full manifestation in our lives this is the culmination of the scriptures this is the completion of the purpose from genesis and i'm so privileged to be here with you say i love you may god bless you may we continue amen to be all that he calls for us to be in this life this is bower heads and praise we're dismissed lord jesus we thank you god for all that you've done for us lord for the sweet words that you've spoken to us today lord you used a man you used our brother brother aaron but we recognized there was something more than just brother aaron more than just a man's vocal cords more than just a ministry entrusted to a man but god it was you speaking to us your eternal purpose your eternal thoughts you were calling us our name you're calling us by name you were giving us our true identification you were placing and positioning us lord according to your word and purpose god let us never forget these things lord may they never become secondary in our life maybe they always be the primary things to us our main motivation our main purpose our main calling in this life god bless your bride lord as your children leave from here may the things that we heard have the proper impact in our lives and may you be glorified in us god we love you what you've done is amazing what you've done is beyond us but god we're fully completely relying on you to fulfill your promise and your purpose you said you will have a bride without spot or wrinkle we believe it and say amen it'll be so you told us through the prophet that you've ordained a bride that will not fall and we say amen that's the truth not by my ability not my my by my strength or my might or my mind but according to your word it'll be and i am so thankful you've called me to be that expression god we trust in you we trust in your word god we as an assembly now would like to thank you for our brother aaron and his family and as he moves to this next transition and what you're calling him too we together ask that you would bless him abundantly lord as you physically move him helping to find the right place to settle his family that you would bless him with physical blessings but more than that you would pheasant bless blessing with spiritual blessings lord that you would move him into this place that you've ordained for him to be and that you would bless the people there and that together he and his family and the sheep that you gather amen to a shepherd's call will grow together lord to be what you've called them to be to manifest you in that place god we we ask that you would go with them go with us guide us lord may every step we take being the center of your will may everything we do be pleasing unto you we love you father ask your blessings as we part or may we go into this world as your expression in this day not a cliche lord not a term that made us excited during a service but in everyday reality living itself out in our everyday lives may we be the message at work in school and in our families our relationships with one another may we be the expression of you in feminine form as a bride upon this earth in this day in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless your saints we'll let you be dismissed the song i'm resting on the finished work of jesus christ today all circumstances will be gone the word of god who has still remained no sickness fear no guilt or sin can have control and worry me the keys of faith are in my hands i am bound for victory i am who i truly am i am a great commission from my lord i have now received the prince of power [Applause] i use the chains of circumstances [Applause] who i truly am [Applause] i am all things are possible with god all things i know that jesus the iron is the

truly am i am free i'm covered by his blood all these are possible with god i know that jesus is the same today the prophet came to show the life the bride must have it on display the hour has come
