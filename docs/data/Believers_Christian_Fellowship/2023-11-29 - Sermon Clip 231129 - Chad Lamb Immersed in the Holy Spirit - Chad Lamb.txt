TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the message of leadership he says the choice of your conduct you can't mix it now you're either for God or against God and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell I hope this doesn't confuse you because I've been talking about the baptism hly ghost quicking the seed but now we're going to show more in depth we're going to get a good clear picture of this of this teaching you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so that's exactly right look here you are an outside person you have five senses that contacts the outside body God gave you five senses not to contact him your Earthly home seed taste feel smell and here then you have a spirit on the inside of that and it has five Outlets conscience and love and so forth five Outlets that you contact the spirit world with but with your spirit your physical contacts the physical your spiritual context is spiritual but inside of that you got a soul and that soul is the gene that come from God what's brother benam telling us he's telling us that you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can be immersed in the Holy Ghost but the immersion of the Holy Ghost is there to Quicken a seed on the inside but if there's no seed on the inside you can still be immersed in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that immersion will not bring a new birth because there's nothing inside to Quicken but it's not that it's not an immersion it's an a baptism of the Holy Ghost it's an immersion in the Holy Ghost but it's not an immersion that brings a new birth that's why he said if you have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth brings the fullness of Christ inside and seals you because it brings to life the seed that's laying there yeah but if there's no seed there you can still be immersed you're submerged in the Holy Ghost and have manifestations and Gifts the gifts and callings of God are without repentance amen it doesn't you don't even have to be born again to manifest those gifts you can manifest those gifts and if they're laying in you amen the immersion of the Holy Gift can bring out the gifts and they can begin to operate and operate correctly and operate spot on that's still no evidence you're born again right amen you're only born again when the predestinated C Gene of God comes to life by the immersion of the Holy Ghost that's the new birth and the evidence is you're changed amen and the evidence is you take all the word all the way and you never leave it right than you lord it's why it can be so deceiving coming out of a Pentecostal Revival and having those thoughts mixed in amen we have to have the true understanding there's nothing wrong with the gifts the gifts are perfect the gifts are good the gifts are meant to be here they still need to be in operation not a thing wrong with them nothing wrong with Sensations and experiences we want those and we want more of them amen but we have to know what the new birth actually is because you can have Sensations in meetings you can get excited you can get enthused you can even have manifestations but unless something inside of you is quickened to life you've not been born again
