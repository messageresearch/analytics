good to see you let's take our bibles while we're standing and turn to first john chapter four we'll read this scripture and then we'll let you have your seats look at first john chapter 4 verse 4. amen first john 4 and 4 year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world it's good to be reminded of that right now let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word how one scripture can be so encouraging lord one phrase lord lift it out of your word can just lift our spirits because we're connected to that word we are part of that word it's our identification lord we pray now lord that as you come on the scene and break the word of life to us lord that you would open our eyes to see give us hearts to perceive and receive all that you have for us have preeminence among us take this gift and this vessel for your glory feed your sheep lord tonight as we've come expecting we've come hungry we've come desiring lord more of you lord i know you won't disappoint lord i know you won't disappoint we look to you for all things in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated amen i'd like for a subject tonight just to take for this title your position overrides your condition if you just write that down because i think that would be something that we should remember all the time that your position overrides your condition and as we go on to become very evident what we mean by that uh but but brother vamp says in adoption part 1 from 1960 he said we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are amen let's turn to ephesians chapter 2. i'd like to read another couple scriptures but ephesians chapter 2 and verse 4 ephesians 2 and 4. but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins had he quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus so we know that we have already been lifted up and seated in heavenly places in christ jesus and brother graham tells us heavenly places oh how i wish i had time here i've got it mark right here in my bible about heavenly places what is heavenly places heavenly places just for a moment is the believer's position in christ see where the believer stands in christ in heavenly places so what is my heavenly place is it's my position in christ and and i'd like to i would like for just the to make the point if you'll allow me to make the point it's he's not talking about heavenly places like so many times and a humanistic idea is i've been in heavenly places meaning i've had an emotionally high experience or i felt really good or i was really lifted up and my emotions are in excitement and all that amen this transcends excitement amen this goes beyond feelings amen your position in christ in heavenly places is secure on your lowest day when you feel worthless and no good like you failed christ and you're you're a miserable christian in the weakest and the lowest that there can be and how could he choose you because you failed him so much your position in christ is still secure so we're in heavenly places not when we feel good we're in heavenly places because we've been lifted up and quickened when we were dead in trespasses and sin he has quickened us up together with him and we're in heavenly places in christ jesus the new birth places us solidly by revelation in this position and nothing will take us out of that position so we've got to make sure that that our position is secured by revelation not by emotion because our feelings and emotions change but we got to catch the revelation of our position in christ amen in our position in christ is secure and transcends our emotion amen so you know somebody can catch you when you're not well when you're distressed when you're upset when you're crying and tearful and say how are you doing you say i'm fine i'm in heavenly places in christ jesus on my low day i'm in heavenly places on my high day i'm in heavenly places in christ jesus and how can you say such a thing you can't say it by intellectualism you can't say it by an emotionalism you can only make that statement by faith in the word of god by a revelation of your position in christ because so many times so many times we sabotage our own faith by our word and our testimony how are you i'm horrible [Laughter] how are you i'm horrible terrible my life is a mess everything's a wreck but that doesn't sound like what the word says the word says you're in heavenly places in christ jesus amen now you can say you know what all around me is trouble my flesh is in trouble my emotions are distressed but i am in heavenly places in christ jesus my position is secure um right now i just want to skip to a scripture i just feel to skip around this a little bit and i shouldn't even say anything because you don't even know i'm skipping around so that was just for me not for you so let's go to luke chapter 10. luke chapter 10 i want to take a look at some scriptures and i love the way jesus speaks the word in a way that may cause us to change maybe a paradigm shift maybe our thinking sometimes is wrong in luke chapter 10 verse 19 we know that the seventy went out two by two into the city's round about to preach the kingdom of god is coming has come and they did miracles and they come back and they testified and jesus says to them in verse 19 and behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you so so when when jesus gives this statement to them it's a statement of invincibility does that sound right we'll read it again i've given you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you so it's a statement of invincibility and if we if we misunderstand what jesus is saying then all of a sudden we can believe that that if something would harm us in the flesh or trouble us in the spirit in the an emotional realm that that it would hurt us physically it would hurt us emotionally that somehow we don't have this kind of power right but i would say that would be a misunderstanding of the scripture because we know the disciples were hurt they were killed they were stoned they were chased from city to city i mean just look at the apostle paul's life and he said nothing by shall any means hurt you when jesus says nothing shall by any means hurt you he must mean something different than what we would intellectually think he means by that statement and just to show this point let's go over to chapter 21 because i don't want you to think i'm too far off the mark chapter 21 verse 16. so i think maybe invincibility isn't what we think invincibility is because this is an invincible army that's marching forth today but invincibility may it may not be the way we think it is let's look at luke 21 verse 16 and you shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolk and friends and some of you shall shall they cause to be put into to death and you should be hated of all men for my name's sake let's stop there so now he's telling the same group that he said i give you power over scorpions and serpents and over all the power of the devil nothing shall by any means hurt you he's speaking to some of the same disciples and he says you shall be betrayed amen some of you shall they calls to be put to death and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake look at the name next sentence but there shall not a hair of your head perish well that sounds like an oxymoron that is a complicated statement they're going to persecute you they're going to hate you and some of you they'll kill but they'll not hurt one hair of your head so apparently not harming one hair of your head is different than what we think it is in this flesh because he's telling you nothing shall perish you've got another body coming your place is secure you'll be in the kingdom you'll be on the millennium you'll have a glorified body because for god everything is now amen there's no there's no then and now everything is now he knows their position is secure amen nothing that they have is going to be lost every brother branham i mean they they i think it was brother bram's wife said uh you're losing your hair he said i haven't lost the one amen same thing as this scripture you can look with your eyes and say his hair is gone and he says i haven't lost the one and she said well where are they he said where were they before i got them that's where they are so you see sometimes we get these statements and invincibility and power over this and nothing might shall be any means hurt you but then he's talking about a life of suffering and persecution and rejection and some of you they'll kill but not one hair of your head shall perish amen maybe maybe just maybe to me when god is speaking of invincibility when god is speaking of security when god is speaking of no harm maybe he's talking about your overall condition in the grand scheme of things because nothing's going to hurt you nothing's going to harm you nothing's going to get you out of your position in heavenly places in christ jesus nothing's going to stop your body change nothing's going to stop you from getting the inheritance nothing's going to stop you from overcoming so sometimes we get the wrong idea of christianity and power and invincibility and all of this stuff and and it gets ingrained into our minds and sometimes when we go through difficulties and troubles the same as the disciples would have went to after the departure of christ some of the same afflictions some of the same difficulties some of the same rejections and ailments and sicknesses and the devil comes along and starts to cause us to doubt our position and doubt our promise because we had the wrong idea of invincibility it's the word that's invincible it's the seed that's invincible it's the life on the inside that's invincible we saw that in the life of paul we saw that in the life of peter we saw it in john john the apostle john they tried to kill him they tried to boil him in oil and they boiled him and and he wouldn't burn but when they beheaded david and when they beheaded peter the knife was sharp and the knife was sure and his head rolled off so was john did john have more faith than than paul peter was hung upside down on the cross and crucified amen did did he have less faith than john because john died of old age and he didn't get born you see sometimes we have the wrong idea of what faith is the wrong idea of invincibility the wrong idea of being an overcomer in this age the greatest example we've ever had of overcoming was jesus christ in his body of flesh on this earth and he overcome and how did he overcame he overcame by surrender to the will of the father and that's our overcoming to keep the word so i want that just to be in our minds now brother brahm says here i want to go back to our position heavenly places is our as a believer's position in christ and an adoption he said like i just quoted you can uh you can never rightly be able to have faith into positionally you know what you are and then christ is the mystery of god revealed he says but god's great mystery what the eternal god had as a mystery has now been unfolded in jesus christ then give right down to his church what was once in god's mind is now in the body of christ what was in god's mind is now in the body of christ where is the body of christ it's on earth it's the believers it's the elect seed amen so now what was in his mind the revelation the secret the mystery and what was in god's mind is now in the body of christ jesus making love to his church his bride whispering secrets to her you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and and love you and everything you know how it is that's what god christ is doing to the church he is letting her know the secrets just the secrets not these flirters i mean his wife all right now look but by having the revelation of his secret made known to them by his grace so he's rolling up his wife and he's making love to his wife not the flirters not everybody out there but just his predestinated bride he's pulling up to his side and he's whispering to her the secrets amen why because revealing himself to her through the secrets by the opening of the seals and revealing her to the great mystery of god that that revelation and that great mystery when he reveals christ when he reveals himself to her she is included in the mystery she is included in the secret and so when he's whispering love secrets to her ear he is positionally placing her within himself in the word and so that love secret that he's giving not to everybody but only to his wife amen is the very thing that is revealing to her what she is her position so that she can have the right kind of faith and i would say in this day it's impossible to have the right kind of faith in this hour or amen without christ himself whispering the love secrets in your ear because you can never rightly have the right kind of faith amen and until you're positionally placed in christ by the revelation of the mystery is positionally placing you today in his body in your age amen in christ so i want to turn to psalms 27. i'm bouncing around but we'll bounce onto a good spot maybe psalms 27. psalms 27. we'll begin at the beginning but we know brother branham when he started preaching the rapture message he started in this scripture this is his opening scripture and he read the first five verses of psalms and and so so when brother branham comes to open the subject of the rapture that teaches about the rapture he goes to psalms 27 and that was no mistake and and i want to read it together we'll read the first five verses but i want to read more of it here in a little bit the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid now listen brother branham when when he's starting with this scripture there's a reason he's starting with the scripture he he is he is he knows the conditions of the rapture he knows the atmosphere around the rapture he's going to preach the rapture and as he preaches the rapture he's going to start to show us that the lord himself shall descend with a shout with a voice with a trump and he's saying he does all of this while he's descending the lord himself descends amen with a shout what was a shout amen it was a message to gather the bride and brother showing that this that that under the shout the rapture cycle has begun there was a rapture taking place that there's a rapture going on amen but he's setting the conditions for the rapture in psalms 27 because if we don't understand if we don't understand what he's doing why he's doing what he's doing it looks like he reads the scriptures out of psalms 27 then skips context and goes over uh the first thessalonians first he goes to peter and talks about scoffers arising and then that day saying everything remains the same and we've got those scoffers still today that say you claim the rapture's on but everything's the same i'm looking for something to happen but it's happening friends it's happening day by day it's happening so those are the two opening scriptures he tells you there's a condition for this in psalms 27 and then there's going to be scoffers saying amen where is the promise of his coming for everything remains the same as it's always been and they're missing it and then he goes down to the uh thessalonians and he goes to the lord himself shall descend with a shout with the voice with the trumpet and then he starts laboring on that and he's talking about that and he doesn't come back and address why he opened with psalms 27. but i think for us it's evident when he's when you begin to read that he's showing you the conditions and the time of the rapture the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fear the war shall rise against me and this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after that that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock brotherhood comes along knowing where he's going he's going to talk about the rapture the secret catching away amen the thing that all christendom has been looking for for 2000 years he begins to speak on it but he starts with such a uh knowing what we know now it makes sense but but not understanding he starts with such an odd spot he starts saying we're gonna talk about the rapture i mean the rapture is i mean it's the rapture is the the release the rapture is the freedom the rapture is the victory the rapture is the overcoming and that's the true but what is the atmosphere of the rapture what is he doing in the rapture he is creating a pavilion he is creating a tabernacle he's creating a secret place amen where you can go amen in a time of trouble so you'll have no fear amen he's the light of your salvation he is your light whom shall you fear though all the enemies gather about all the forces of hell there's been a place provided up upon a rock which a rock is a revelation and then the revelation of jesus christ is the rock that the church is founded on and christ is the mystery of god revealed so now in the time of rapture it's a troublesome time amen but he's creating a safe place he's creating a place of security a place of safety in a troublesome time in the rapture cycle and it's up upon a rock on a revelation in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle not the outer court not the inner court but the secret of his tabernacle the holy of holies i'm going to go on and read the rest of this brother bam only reads the first five verses but i just would like to read it it says then now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will i offer in this tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yeah i sing praises unto the lord david just described earlier in this let's go back to verse two when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing if i desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide in me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me shall set me up upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yeah i was singing praises unto the lord in the time of trouble on the rock in the pavilion in the secret of the tabernacle david's head is lifted above his enemies means his understanding is higher than everybody around him his revelation has lifted his head christ has lifted his head his revelation is understanding up above all of us enemies and in that condition all he can do is sing and rejoice and sing praises to the lord you see friends in your position in christ when we understand our position i mean it doesn't matter how many foes how many are encamped how much trouble david was in trouble friends he was in a troublesome time he had enemies all around they wanted to gather around and eat up his flesh but god in that time had created a place on the revelation of jesus christ in the in the pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle he had a place where his head would be lifted above his enemies and in that place david cannot mourn in that place david cannot be gloomy in that place david can only sing praises unto the lord praise god see in the rapture time [Music] in the rapture time it can be a troublesome time [Music] but there's a place of security in the rapture when the world is in trouble and there's trouble all around and the enemies of god would try to take out the servants of god in any way they can any demon i mean you think where do you think the demon guns are trained amen brother branham said when the when the bottomless pit was open and amen those demons come out of the river euphrates he said those hundred or uh two hundred thousand thousand he said where did they go and then did they go to the nomination no they go after the bride so you've got enemies round about that want to eat up your flesh amen you've got foes that would like to destroy you amen but in this time amen in the end time in the harvest time in the rapture time amen when the gates of hell have been open and thousands and thousands of demons have ushered out gunning for the bride amen there's been a secret spot put on a rock that he has lifted his bride into that spot amen and put her head above all the enemies amen more revelation and all she can do is sing and praise his name and rejoice see i want to read a couple scriptures here and then or a couple quotes and then keep keep going and the easter seal says oh if we if we are ordained on that ground if we are ordained to be on that ground like the eagle walking in the chicken's nest if you're ordained on the ground the holy spirit is here to find you and when it finds you you recognize its call and know the hour you're living you know that these things are supposed to happen quickly you're raptured up to meet it and now you're setting in heavenly places in christ jesus oh what a promise what a heavenly father who should give us these things don't keep putting the rapture off in the future we're looking forward to the change in the body but god has already called us up with a shout he has already brought us out of laodicea there's already been a door open in heaven there's already been a voice that says come up higher and then when we heard the eagle scream quickly we were raptured up to meet it there's a position for us said in the rapture message to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture now it is a revelation for the revelation is faith you cannot have revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now faith that's what faith is the revelation of god the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body so the rapture is a revelation to the bride he says in the rising of the sun because i live you live also speaking to his wife because i live you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power so brother branham is telling us amen there's people being raptured up right now amen caught up in the heavenly places amen with a revelation that is seeding them securely in christ jesus there's a resurrection out of dead denominationalism there's a resurrection out of the deadness of the church and then he's bringing back what's he resurrecting he's resurrecting a bride back and we were part of that resurrection we were part of that rapture and so now we find ourselves in psalms 27. when we look at psalms 27 i want to i want to look at that in the conditions of the rapture and say the the the only place to overcome is in the secret of the tabernacle the only place to have joy the only place to have victory the only place to overcome is in the secret of the tabernacle because out there are enemies that want to eat his flesh out there there are foes that are gathered around out there is every force that would try to destroy him but the place of rejoicing the place of joy amen the place of security the place of safety is in the pavilion in the secret of the tabernacle up upon the rock and that is our position friends and our position in this rapture cycle transcends our condition our position amen is overriding our condition because it doesn't matter what condition we're in you can be sick you can you can have complications you can have distresses you can have work pressures but your position overrides your condition your conditions should never override your position you can see because there's been a place provided for us because there's been a rock that has been revealed to us in this day the revelation of jesus christ christ the mystery of god revealed opened amen as the seals were open now there's a place up on a rock up above our enemies where our head can be lifted up and then we can go into the pavilion of the lord and to the chambers of the lord into the secret chamber of the lord through the secret place of the tabernacle and in there we have joy and there we have rejoicing and there we have shouting and there we have security and there we have peace and there we're feasting with the lamb feasting on the lamb eating the manna that has been preserved seated with christ jesus in heavenly places but i want to tell you in this day that's the only place to be everywhere else amen will bring distress amen we'll bring stress amen we'll bring depression we'll bring anxiety we'll bring fear i say if god has provided us a place in this rapture cycle then it behooves us to stay in that place and the whole goal of the enemy is to get us to look outside and the war now the struggle is just to stay in the place that's provided brother brahm says in spiritual amnesia you that wants the holy spirit you that wants the experience not an emotional excitement you want the holy ghost the life the germ of life in inside you and you want to get rid of that amnesia that's making you you can't identify yourself you don't know where you stand you don't know what you are let's get rid of it right now there is a new birth here for you a real genuine new birth i don't want any of that old amnesia lingering on anymore i want to know who i am where i am what i'm here for that amnesia means you can't identify yourself amen you don't know your position in modern events made clear by prophecy prophet of god says you're a gene of your father you were in your father yet you had no fellowship with you with you because you was in there but you knew it not and he knew it not but you was manifested that you might that he might fellowship with you and you're being born again you're born of the eternal life and that's the only one form of eternal life and that's god's life zoe the greek word zoe only one form of eternal life then if you are a son of god or a daughter of god you were in god all the time but he knew what bed and time that you'd be planted so now you you're you're made a creature a son of god manifested son or daughter of god to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living god of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time i'm going to read that again you you're if you're made a creature a son of god manifest son or daughter of god to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living god of this hour the message is coming forth in this time and so you've been placed here you've been placed here for a specific time and you've been placed in a position in this time by the new birth you're in this position that god had created for david that david was talking about in psalms 27 and you're here for a purpose you're in a position and you're here to meet the challenge of the hour and there's a couple other things i want to say i'm just trying to ask god to help me to say it right because when i say it wrong it stumbles but i don't want to i don't want to stumble brother bam says in why little bethlehem i don't worship a jew i worship god when i worship jesus christ i don't worship some fiction or some kind of historical something i worship jesus christ the presence of jesus christ right now which is his word that's manifested in this age i hope you we all believe that we all know that but it's those things have to sink deep friends i'm not worshiping some fiction or some kind of historical something i worship jesus christ listen how does he worship jesus christ the presence of jesus christ right now which is his word that's manifest in this age so how are you going to worship jesus christ without worshiping through the word that's manifest in this age the present tense jesus christ he says again and when their eyes were open they knew him would you like to to look took a trip with cleopas and them on the road to emmaus i like to walk with them and it's possible i'm glad to be living today that i can still do the same thing walk with him today just the same as they did then they thought of it the thought of it was how that jesus had risen up from the dead but the sad part of it was some of them who loved him didn't know it jesus says because i live you live also the word is resurrected the word is here amen you can walk with the word and some people have been walking with the word amen and they didn't even know it he's resurrected the word is restored and he's come back in the fullness of the word and some don't even know it it's the same thing today he said now some of them who loved him didn't even didn't know it and that's certainly a picture of today there are so many people who love him who doesn't yet realize that he's alive it's some kind of a history that they have learned in some school in some book of theology some ethical code of ethics that they studied somewhere and jesus is a historical figure to them and yet in the history they love him and don't realize that he is alive with us walking right around with us just as he always did he is here just the same as he ever was how in the manifested word for this age and the message of the hour that's how he's walking around in an anointed ones at the end time says remember david now he was honest sincere trying to do god of work and wasn't ordained to do it they the anointed one but jesus said they're teaching for doctrine the interpretation of scriptures of man see not the word of god not his vindicated word teaching a historical christ sees something that was now see there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with the historical jesus there's nothing wrong with with the christ that was the rock that followed them through the wilderness there's nothing wrong with the pillar of fire that led them into acts there's nothing wrong with christ that was typed in the ark in noah's day the error was leaving him in history and brother branham preached lifting christ out of history amen because because it's not wrong to believe in that it's wrong to reject him today it's wrong to leave him historical christ and many people will say well i mean he's not dead he's alive amen he he he he's not a dead christ he's not just a god of history he's not just a christ of history he's christ today but you ask him where and they want to put him off sitting in a seat somewhere in another place in another dimension and not realize that he's here he's a present tense jesus christ and you can worship a present tense jesus christ not a historical figure not a historical god but a present tense jesus christ that is here among us what in the manifestation of his word which is what his bride church come back to grain again he's back in the grain it's harvest time it's the restoration of the bride tree it's the promised word for this hour it's the manifestation of the light and the word for this day and it's a present tense jesus christ [Music] and you can worship a present tense jesus christ but there's billions who are worshiping a historical christ and they're missing the present tense jesus christ [Music] amen in the present tense jesus christ amen the revelation is the rapture cycle it's lifting out of denomination it's lifting out of laodicea it's lifting out of man's ideas and lifting us back into heavenly places back in the mind of christ and the revelation of god and that has provided that revelation this message of this hour has provided the secret of the tabernacle it has provided the hiding place up on the rock it has provided the hiding place in the pavilion in christ it has provided the hiding place in the secret of the pavilion in the holy of holies and an invisible union with christ how do i get there amen the word alive today has provided the safety place has provided the place above the heads of your enemies you can't get there without the message of the hour you can't get there without this revelation what rock will you stand on if it's not christ the mystery of god revealed if it's not the seventh seal what rock are you standing on that will lift you above the heads of your enemies the secret place is in christ amen in communion with christ feasting on the lamb as the lamb is in you and you're in him that's the only place of safety it's the only place of security and the only way to get there is through the revealed word of the hour and so saying that you see so many things that are so troubling and friends we're in a troubling time i mean we're in a precarious time where where i've said many times where things that were so solid now don't seem solid anymore things that will seem secure and safe don't seem safe or secure anymore things that were normal are no longer normal you have this sense that anything can happen at any time there's a sense worldwide that that what was so solid now seems so fragile and and it was a false sense of security and if we put our security in the united states government that's a false security says in the message he careth for you we can't look at democracy [Music] if i would have said this during the reagan administration i'd have got run out of message churches we can't look at democracy now it was right but it's run it's lived its life kings lived their life and kingdoms and dictators and all lived there today democracy was the best thing they had but it's so polluted through politics it's rotten to the core no hopes on it at all i hope we can believe the prophet no hopes on it at all you're just like trying to build on a charred city that's burnt to smolders you can't build it it's ruined and gone and it has to be that way it must come that way the bible says it'll be that way satan is the ruler of every nation every kingdom belongs to satan and he rules him according to his own way of ruling no the people have the power [Laughter] democracies failed to run its course it's rotten by politics i don't mean to trouble you but this is what the prophet said and it's better to come to terms with it now because it's not going to get any better satan is the ruler of every nation every kingdom belongs to satan and he rules them according to his own way of ruling brother rem says in birth pains now she must rot of course speaking of the united states as i have said in order to bring new birth look what she has rotted into notice my brother and she's totally rotten her politics and system is just as rotten as they can be there isn't a sound bone in her in her world system in her politics and her religious politics and whatever it is one says i'm a democrat i'm a republican i'm a methodist i'm baptist why the whole thing is rotten to the core there's got to be something give way she can't stand if you put a george washington or abraham lincoln in every county in these united states it still couldn't come back it's beyond redemption it's beyond redemption brother remember says in god's provided place of worship this world must soon come to an end it can't go much longer sin is too deep it's beyond hope there is no more hope for the world it's past that i believe the holy spirit is gleaning in the fields finding this one and that one for the hour is far spent i'm going to say this i want to make a few more statements but also say brother branham said i'm glad that i live in america i'd rather live here than anywhere else and i agree and he said here are canada so that's throw off to the canadians said here are canada and i'm still that way but i wonder if we'll still be that way years from now if there is years from now are things continuing would we still feel that way i still feel that way today so it's not a bash against where we live i'm glad grateful where he's placed me there's benefits there's been privileges there's been a a a a a way of living that's been nice nice to raise a family nice to live in relative peace but that's not where our security comes from that's not what we put our hope in it's not our place of safety that's not our refuge in the time of storm that's not the thing that brings us security our position in christ brings us security the nation has to fall has run its course it's beyond redemption there's no hope for it anymore these are the things that brother branham has told us but you see you see the denominational world especially the evangelicals and the right-wing conservatives which are mostly christians it's their only hope you can see in the way they talk you can see them the way they act it is their only hope amen and i mean they're up in arms i mean ready to fight because it looks like an election is rigged and being stolen losing their candidate and they're i mean just absolutely beside themselves and i would say that they have no pavilion and no secret tabernacle that i have because i'm singing and rejoicing and happy and thankful and glad because everything's ticking just the way it's got to be these things have to fall they have to collapse every system of man has to fall to ruin amen because we're coming amen to that seventh trumpet amen all the way over in revelation 11 where he says the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our god and his christ that's what i'm putting my hope on that's where my faith is i'm not turning this around not patching it up not not not somehow a grassroots effort to fix it there is no grassroots effort to fix this the prophet said it's beyond redemption amen in the religious world i mean they're trying to redeem america bring it back to her glory days there is no more glory days america has become the beast of revelation 13 and must be the beast of revelation 13. it's prophecy that's what it must be and i say that to say this don't let that discourage you one drop one drop if anything it should be encouraging because the prophet said it amen we're seeing it it's manifest it's the truth amen it was thus saith the lord it's right and one thing that discourages me i mean when you see people who are message believers getting caught up in that political realm to try to turn the thing around and save the nation when the prophet said it's beyond redemption and what's happening is the devil is trapping you and pulling you out of the secret of your tabernacle stealing your joy because of an election stealing your joy because of a nation that's under the rule of satan that he is ruling the way he wants to rule it and we're losing our joy over that we're becoming fearful and anxious and nervous and irritated amen and getting on facebook and fighting with democrats you understand friends our victory is finished it's already been met the battle's won the victory is ours the kingdom is ours the kingdoms of this world has become the kingdoms of our god in this christ and i'm a joint heir i'm part of that christ i'm falling air it's going to be renovated and burned over and i'm falling air to it why do i want to prop it up see a denominational faith in a historical jesus brings a denominational response to current events i hope you can catch that but if we can just take what the prophet said in believing all these things have to be this way everything's ticking right on time [Music] it's not that there's not discouraging thing that's happening it's discouraging and it's not that you can't get rocked in your flesh it's not that you can't be surprised or shocked it's not that you can't real amen but but there's nothing we can do about it the only thing we can do is run into the place of refuge and begin to sing and rejoice because my head is lifted above my enemies i'm set on the firm foundation of the rock of the revelation of jesus christ i'm in the secret of his tabernacle i am secure my security was not in the nation my security sure isn't in social security my security is not in a stimulus package or the us dollar holding its value my security is not in the u.s military or a strong border my security is not in elected officials my security is in christ my security and my refuge and my place of safety is in that secret tabernacle amen set upon this rock of christ the revelation of this hour worshiping the present day jesus christ the word may manifest in this hour this message and why can't we be happy in there why can't we sing and praise and rejoice though there's enemies all about though everything's going wrong those are there's a tightening up coming there's a pressure and a squeeze coming upon the bride why can't i still sing and the secret of his pavilion laws are changing things are changing rapidly i think what god has done for us is by his grace he has absolutely done the best thing he can ever do for us by peeling back the false front of democracy and showing us that we live in a tyranny so how can you say that by the time we have a constitution the constitution has been overridden how has it been overridden by a declaration of emergency and now we found out that under certain conditions when conditions change in states of emergency i wonder if the catholic church can create states of emergency in states of emergency governors have become dictators bypassing their own legislative branch and ruling with the pen i hope i'm not making you angry i hope that you're just realizing it's the truth so many people maybe even message believers were caught in the falsehood of a democracy a godly nation uh friends is not a godly nation brother bam said it wasn't a godly nation he said it's worse than sodom and gomorrah we're under the falsehood of we live in freedom we don't live in freedom tomorrow night you can't go out past 10 o'clock you can't leave your house in the state of ohio how free are you you might as well come to terms with it you might as well face the facts that america's gone brother bam told us all those things were already in place we just didn't see him until a worldwide pandemic comes along when a worldwide pandemic comes along we see what he was telling us was already there already in laws already in place already passed by congress congress's amen already passed by legislative branches those things are there but they just wait for the right conditions where they can go into effect emergency clauses and worldwide pandemics and and and domestic war these things are coming friends one after the other after the other god in his grace peeled the false front of democracy off so that we can lose all hope in that so that we can quit being upset and bothered and discouraged by what the prophet told us already was and just say you know what the world's crazy scary things are going all around do you know what i'm going to do i'm going to pick up my seal book and go back into the secret of the tabernacle you know what i would encourage all of us to do is get off our phones and computers and quit watching the news and go back to the message and that goes for all of us it's not wrong to check the news i'm not please don't get me wrong brother bam talked all over all the time about reading the newspaper so i mean we're not condemning checking the news but it all of a sudden it becomes so shocking and things change so fast also you become addictive and the updates and the and you're constantly and what you're doing is you're constantly delving in a world of unbelief in a world that is falling apart a world that is discouraging a world that is changing so rapidly amen and then then you you if you listen to commentators i'm telling you you're going to pick up their spirit i'll tell you for sure you start listening to commentators on the radio and talk show host you will pick up their spirit amen and and i can spend some time with you and i could tell you who you've been listening to on the radio because if you listen to this guy he's super sarcastic you'll be super sarcastic this other carl guy he calls the opposing party names and you'll start using the same names he uses for that opposing party do you understand what i'm saying what's the point they're all fussing and fighting amongst themselves what are they trying to do everybody wants to be the captain of a sinking ship it's taking torpedoes it's full of holes the mast is broken in half i mean the sails have burnt up in fire there's no food there's no water and who wants to be the captain they're standing in line to try to pilot this boat let them fight over it let them have it i'm part of a kingdom kingdom of god is in me that kingdom is sure that kingdom is secure i'm i'm on a rock in a pavilion in the secret of a tabernacle and i will sing praises to the lord i will rejoice yea i will sing praises unto god for everything in my life is perfect i am secure i am safe everything is fine with me let's turn to mark four mark chapter four mark chapter 4 verse 35 and the same day when even was come he saith unto them let us pass over and to the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and they were also with them other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat unto the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they wake him and say unto him master carest down not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are you so fearful and how is it that you have no faith i want to read quite quite a lengthy quote out of calling jesus on the scene from august in 1963. brother ben was he's telling he's taking the same scripture and he's dramatizing he's telling us the story around it and so it is you know it might have been the young john that hadn't had his heart so scarred with so much theology he must have said something like this think of it right here in the ship this one that is identified by jehovah's word to be jehovah's servant in whom he is pleased is right here in the ship with us what a secured feeling oh please just hang with me and catch this story the way brother ben was telling him what a secure feeling oh if we tonight could only catch that vision the very jehovah that made the heavens and the earth is right in this little vessel of ours while we're sailing life solemn maine for the holy ghost is jehovah in spirit form in you god the holy spirit has got himself in you jesus said at that day you'll know that i am in the father the father and me i in you and you and me oh oh my then god all that god was he poured into jesus all that jesus was he poured into his church dividing himself on the day of pentecost that pillar of fire come down and busted himself up the shekinah glory and put it in different ones tongues of fire was seen upon each one the holy spirit god identifying himself in human beings talk about amazing grace how sweet to sound what a what a secure it is how secure we feel to know that when we're driving on the highways whatever we're doing that jesus lays in the ship amen the one who who can perform any miracle can do anything that he wants to do doing it again perfectly identifying himself he is in our little boat as we're sailing life solemn maine same as he was then so is he now what a feeling of security while sailing the troubled waters of life that's our security friends further down he says they they were something like us today those disciples out there on that ship that night after the revival was feasting on the results brother mum says they were having testimony service talking about all that they had seen him do i want you to catch this they were talking about all that they had seen him do previously and he was in the ship but he was asleep it says now maybe between the revivals now he said they were feasting that night after the revival was feasting on the results now maybe between the revivals now we are looking for another stir where there has got to be something happen now that will gather the church together there will have to be some kind of a press god always does it that way to run his people together is oppressed a bad thing or a good thing depends on if you're flesh or if you're in the spirit he said i believe that it's already being formed that will shut out everything that won't agree with them and then it's going to run the church together and we're waiting for that to happen and we're living on the results of the great revival that we just passed and he is resting a couple paragraphs down he says then trouble arose all of a sudden the ship began to rock the sails blew off the oars broke the water filled up the boat trouble at hand see it happened suddenly all hopes of survival was gone though they had seen him do so many great things when trouble strikes they forgot all about it now i want to ask you something as a brother isn't that about the attitude of the people today well come to church here and shout and praise god when our brothers and so forth speak the word we can hear the promises we just praise god for what he's done listen at the testimony of that one saying i was once blind my eyes were blind now i see one said the doctors give me up with cancer and in two weeks or two days or some there wasn't one speck of cancer that's been a long time ago they can't find it no more yet i laid bound up in a wheelchair paralyzed i walked as good as anybody else we hear those testimonies but just like it let it strike our little house one time then we forget all about the glory that we've been enjoying all those great things oh it's us now see those things happen for a purpose they happen to try you now trouble that we can't remedy seems like the doctors can't remedy and there is nothing can remedy they tried to pull their sails it blew away they tried their oars they broke they run to the middle of the ship it filled up satan was determined to take them now he thought he had jesus asleep away from them and then he could slip in on them now that's the way it is today when satan gets a chance here he comes and you go to the doctor he says there's nothing you can do it's advanced who he hasn't gotten nothing for a nervous breakdown we haven't gotten anything for mental troubles no we can't do nothing arthritis no we can't do nothing for that we can maybe give you cortisone and that'll kill you so we haven't got nothing for it leukemia nothing we can do about it see then you get all trouble but look back hasn't he healed leukemia hasn't he healed cancer hasn't he done everything right hasn't he kept his word see get trouble when it strikes our little ship this little bark that we're sailing in is frail anyhow gets filled up with doubts world notice trouble that they could not remedy then fear sets in listen troubles they could not remedy as long as those fishermen could navigate the boat they weren't fearful as long as the sail was intact and the oars were in their hand and they could set a course and steer there was no problem but when they come to the situation that they could no longer remedy then fear set in i'm telling you friends we're in troublesome times in this country and all around that we cannot remedy there's not a thing we can do to protect ourselves defend ourselves there's nothing notice trouble they could not remedy and fear sits in just like it is now even we got fears and national troubles amen we got fears and church troubles we got fears all around everywhere now we say well now what can we do about it if we could only remember that he is in the ship see but but yes he is in the ship this is him in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word is the same yesterday today and forever did you catch what he said he said if we can just remember he's in the ship where's he at the word that was in the beginning is the same yesterday today and forever how's he in the ship he is the word and the word is here the revelation of the word is here he is in the ship but i don't see him if you see the revealed word for the day you see him if you see the manifested word in this hour you see him and he's in the ship in what form is he in the ship he's in the form of the word made manifest in this day i'll read that again is he in the ship that's the question but is yes is he in the ship here this is him brother brahm's going to identify him this is him in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god what's that it's him and the word is the same yesterday today and forever how is the word the same yesterday and today forever because the word has always been in every age the manifested word for that day and the manifested word and the present tense day is always the same yesterday today and forever it's still just take this it's the remedy it's the medicine it's the cure for every breakdown it's the cure for every cancer it's the cure for every ailment it's god manifested in a word the word is god jesus said it's a seed the seed being planted in the right kind of ground it'll grow exactly what it is and every promise will be produced we forget all about it now that now that he is in the ship they should have known that he knew that that thing was going to happen it just brother i'm saying they're troubled oars are broke amen the sail is torn it's taking on water they can no longer steer it amen they get troubled and they forgot that he's in the ship they had spiritual amnesia and they forgot that he was present with them in the form of the manifested word and they should have known that he back there sleeping was already aware that this was going to happen they should have known that he knew that the thing was going to happen do you believe that certainly he knew it he knew all the time it was going to happen why he only did it to to prove to test their faith why was he sleeping to prove their faith he could have stayed active he could have been walking around the boat he could have been encouraging the whole time don't worry i know all about this don't worry i know it's going to happen amen don't worry everything's going to be fine but the whole scene was set to prove and test her faith so he was back in the boat sleeping amen so that they would so that they would forget he was there sometimes things strike us and it seems like god is asleep things happen and it seems it seems like he can't be reached but you should know you should know he already knew this was going to happen coven 19 did not take jesus christ by surprise neither does the thing that's coming next has taken him by surprise or the thing after that or it's not taking him by surprise they should have known he's in the ship and he already knows it's going to happen he's in our little ship our little bark it's frail it's weak amen there's things that we can't remedy but don't forget he's in the boat and don't forget he already knew this was going to happen he's only allowed this to happen to prove the faith of his bride because his bride will stand on the word amen she'll stay with the manifested word and she won't budge off of it even when it seems like it's not working to remedy the situation she's being tested to stay with the word and sometimes he does the same thing for you and me he lets things happen just to see what we'll do about it are you going to get on facebook forums political analysis arguments are you going to go to the secret of the tabernacle you know the other day i got so tired of reading news i just picked up the breach and i just started slowly very slowly going through the breach one or two pages at a time and guess what i did i sang i rejoiced i sang praises to the lord because i realized i'm in the secret of a tabernacle i realized he's present how is he present the manifested word amen what was breaking my spiritual amnesia that was causing discouragement it was the breach friends it was the message of the hour that was reminding me he's in the boat and he already knows about it don't lose sleep don't get stressed don't let your blood pressure go up everything's fine i'll read this again sometimes he does the same thing for you and me he lets things just happen to see what we'll do about it do you believe that the scripture said every son that cometh to god must be tried chastened prude satan will make you prove every inch of ground that you claim he certainly will so sometimes god lets those things happen jesus says in luke 17 or luke 12 32 fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom don't be worried don't be fearful i'd like to read another scripture together psalms 23 and we'll end with this one how many of you believe are in the rapture how many heard the shout come up higher many's been called out of laodicea called out of denominationalism resurrected a new life if that's the case then you've been placed in the secret of the tabernacle in the pavilion on the rock with your head above your enemies your position overrides your condition but i'm sick in my body but i'm in the secret of the tabernacle i'm up upon a rock i've heard the shout i've come up higher i'm in heavenly places in christ jesus my position in christ is secure it doesn't matter now what happens this is something god knew was going to happen he's allowed it for his glory he's accomplishing something some purpose and whatever whatever's happening in my life whatever troubles come upon me god is going to get glory in this and god's going to accomplish his purpose and my life and the lives of others so i'm not i'm not going to let it bring me down and i'm not going to let it pull me out of the secret chamber i'm going to stay right here and sing praises to the lord he says in psalms 32 verse 1 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he's making me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me besides the waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will feel no fear no evil for thou art with me because you're in the boat he's in the boat friends doesn't matter how the shadows fall and how dark it gets in the shabash and the in the valley of the shadow of death it does not matter i will fear no evil for thou art with me my rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runeth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever what's the solution to all of our troubles the revelation of the message but but brother chad i've got this trouble in that

that simple it's that simple david had enemies he had foes he had those who wanted to eat up his flesh and what did he do about it nothing god put him up on a rock in a pavilion in the secret of the tabernacle and in there he sang and rejoiced and saying praises to the lord stick with the message friends the message will take you further than cnn or fox or whatever little alternate news that you think is the truth which isn't the truth because the truth is the word how can you say that brother chad my little sidebar internet thing it only tells the truth unbiased please please my conspiracy theorists my online news media they only tell me the truth unbiased please it's not the truth the truth is the word everything else is tainted by man everything else is corrupted by man and the desires and the lust of man there's only one truth there's only one truth and that's the word stick with the word everything else will sort itself out god will take care of it all you will conquer everything as the word conquers through you take the word stand on the word take the revelation hold on to the revelation stay in the message stay in the tape stay in fellowship and let everything else fix itself because god has already got a plan for your life god already knows what you're going through he already has a purpose and a plan for everything that's coming don't try to run over here

word don't let the devil distract us there's all kinds of little puppets and marinettes and all kinds of little chimes and and little shows and songs and all these things that are going on trying to get our attention don't give it attention give attention to christ the word worship jesus christ the manifested word stick with him let him encourage your faith let him come on the scene let him remind you that he's in the boat and watch everything else it's amazing how friends when you stick with the word and you have faith in god it's amazing how you keep moving forward in the word and things start to fix themselves things you thought were unmovable things you thought were unchangeable amen they begin to shift why did they begin to shift it wasn't your wisdom it wasn't your effort it wasn't what began to shift amen as you walked with the word the word began to fix everything and put everything in place how does it work i can't tell you how it works all i can tell you is it works the place to be is in the secret of the pavilion my position we can all stand musicians if you come your position overrides your condition how will i have victory how will i overcome stay in

things there's no help my help cometh from the lord my victory my deliverance my overcoming is all by the lord all by his word don't get caught up in all of the talk don't get caught up in all the conspiracy theories don't get caught up in all the talk don't get caught up in all the rage and anger can you be discouraged yes can you say that's not right well of course it's not right can you say what they're doing is wrong well this isn't the constitution you can say all of those things but what can you do about it is it contrary to prophecy is it going differently than what brother ram told
