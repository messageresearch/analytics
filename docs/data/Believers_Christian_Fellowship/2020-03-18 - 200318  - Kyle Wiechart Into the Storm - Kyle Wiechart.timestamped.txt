[0:00] so if we go to psalms 91
[0:04] and we'll begin at verse 1.
[0:08] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[0:09] the most high shall abide under the
[0:11] shadow
[0:12] of the almighty i will say of the lord
[0:15] he is my refuge and my fortress
[0:17] my god and him will i trust
[0:20] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[0:22] snare of the fowler and from the noise
[0:23] and pestilence
[0:25] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[0:27] and under his wings shalt thou
[0:28] trust his truth shall be thy shield and
[0:31] buckler
[0:32] thou shall not be afraid for the terror
[0:34] by night nor for the arrow that flieth
[0:36] by day
[0:37] nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[0:38] darkness nor for the destruction that
[0:41] wasteth at noonday
[0:42] a thousand shall fall at thy side and
[0:44] ten thousand at thy right hand
[0:46] but it shall not come nigh thee only
[0:48] with thy
[0:49] with thine eye shalt thou behold and see
[0:51] the reward of the wicked
[0:53] because thou has made the lord which is
[0:54] my refuge even the most high thy
[0:57] habitation
[0:58] there shall no evil be fail thee neither
[1:00] shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
[1:03] amen make that take that word into our
[1:06] hearts and say god
[1:08] you know you've promised to take care of
[1:10] me and i'm trusting you to do what you
[1:12] said you would
[1:13] you bought me with your blood you
[1:15] purchased me you redeemed me back
[1:18] and you've taken full responsibility as
[1:20] my head and i'm trusting in that
[1:22] the the government is upon his shoulders
[1:24] so we just trust him to take care
[1:27] but just in a uh just going a little
[1:30] further from sunday
[1:31] i just wanted to also think about
[1:34] i've been thinking about this and
[1:35] meditating on this as well
[1:37] i was talking to another brother the
[1:39] other day and and we were talking about
[1:41] some of these things
[1:42] but for us as the believers as the bride
[1:45] of jesus christ
[1:47] we've got peace in our hearts we we
[1:50] we're under the wings of jehovah we're
[1:53] covered in feathers
[1:54] you know i love that word picture the
[1:56] bible paints here
[1:57] that he he shall cover thee in verse
[2:00] four with feathers
[2:01] and under his wings shalt thou trust his
[2:04] truth
[2:05] his truth shall be thy shield and
[2:08] buckler
[2:09] so we've got the truth we've got the
[2:10] word we've got the presence of the lord
[2:12] and
[2:12] there's such a peace inside and such a
[2:14] joy even in the midst of all kinds of
[2:16] trouble
[2:18] but the reality is that's just our
[2:21] portion
[2:22] outside the bride people are afraid
[2:26] they're very afraid they're terrified
[2:28] they're gripped by fear there's a spirit
[2:29] of fear that's moving about
[2:31] and gripping the heart to the people and
[2:33] and
[2:34] for me i want to take note of that and
[2:36] recognize
[2:38] that it's time for us to have compassion
[2:40] there's gross darkness upon the people
[2:42] and it's time to have compassion
[2:45] and and not in any ways come across an
[2:47] arrogant as though
[2:48] you know just because we're under the
[2:50] wings of jehovah that we can have an
[2:52] arrogant attitude about that
[2:53] like nobody else should be scared they
[2:56] very well may should be scared
[2:59] you see so so
[3:02] we don't want to condemn or criticize
[3:05] somebody in the world
[3:07] who's afraid but we want to have
[3:08] compassion and a heart of love and say
[3:10] you know the reason i feel the way i do
[3:13] is because what god's done for me
[3:15] because of the connection that i have
[3:17] with his indwelling presence in my life
[3:19] there's a peace
[3:20] that surrounds me i know i'm well cared
[3:23] for i know i'm taken care of and i'm on
[3:24] a foundation of his word that will not
[3:26] move
[3:27] and but that's my position but that's
[3:29] not this man next to me position
[3:32] and we're starting to see a drastic
[3:35] uh difference between the believer and
[3:38] the rest of the world
[3:40] people you know who lived a stable life
[3:43] and
[3:43] had some sort of confidence and all of a
[3:46] sudden the confidence around the world
[3:48] is being shaken the confidence all
[3:49] around and
[3:50] and all of a sudden the gap between the
[3:52] believer and the unbeliever is getting
[3:54] wide
[3:55] and and so i just want us to be
[3:58] conscious of that
[3:59] because it also creates opportunities if
[4:02] we can just be humble
[4:04] you know i told the story of the
[4:05] moravians on the ship when
[4:07] when john wesley was crossing over to
[4:09] america and the storm came and
[4:10] those circumstances but he also writes
[4:13] in his diary
[4:14] and other places about that trip that
[4:16] the moravians were a humble people
[4:19] and they were serving the rest of the
[4:20] people all the time
[4:22] they were taking care of the sick on the
[4:24] ship they were serving they were doing
[4:25] menial tasks that nobody else wanted to
[4:27] do and the moravians gladly did it and
[4:29] they did it with joy
[4:30] so they weren't just you know singing
[4:32] all the time they were serving everybody
[4:34] around them
[4:35] and even the people who were terrified
[4:36] they would joy were serving them
[4:38] and so you know we're in a special
[4:40] position
[4:42] and i want to recognize that and and not
[4:46] condemn anybody else but say god if
[4:49] there's
[4:49] any way i can take what's in my heart
[4:51] and put it in their heart i would gladly
[4:53] do it
[4:54] with everything that's in me if i could
[4:56] take the joy in my heart the peace that
[4:58] god's given me
[4:59] the love for god if i could take that
[5:01] and put it in the heart of the people
[5:03] you see
[5:04] with a face and tear eyes and fear
[5:07] i would do it if i could and i'm just
[5:10] praying god give us an opportunity
[5:13] give us an opportunity but but let's
[5:15] walk in
[5:16] in meekness and humility that's what i'm
[5:19] going to say
[5:20] we know that we're under protection but
[5:22] also you know
[5:23] everybody else is afraid and so when we
[5:26] walk into a place if you go into a
[5:28] waiting room for a doctor or if you go
[5:29] into
[5:30] uh anywhere like that they've got the
[5:34] seats you know
[5:35] three feet six feet apart however long
[5:37] far apart they are
[5:38] because that's what they've been
[5:40] recommended to do that's what they're
[5:41] told to do
[5:42] just because we're not we're okay
[5:43] doesn't mean we should go push those
[5:45] seats together and sit down
[5:47] because as soon as you do that you bring
[5:49] fear into the heart of somebody else
[5:51] and that's not even kind you know
[5:54] they're afraid
[5:55] don't scare them just sit six feet apart
[5:57] do your thing and go back
[5:59] we're not afraid it's not that we have a
[6:02] problem but they're afraid
[6:04] and i don't want to make them more
[6:05] afraid i don't want to induce
[6:07] panic by my conduct i went into saint
[6:09] rita's the other day to visit somebody
[6:11] and they had to sign up and they asked
[6:12] everybody to use hand sanitizer when
[6:13] they come in the door
[6:14] so i used hand sanitizer when i come in
[6:16] the door not because i was afraid of
[6:18] germs
[6:19] because the sign says please use hand
[6:21] sanitizer
[6:22] it's just a common courtesy and if
[6:25] somebody would see you walk past that
[6:27] and
[6:27] arrogantly say i don't need that and i'm
[6:29] the bride of jesus christ what would
[6:30] that do in their heart the fear that
[6:32] would come up
[6:33] and all those things we've got to be
[6:34] careful amen that we don't cause an
[6:36] offense for no reason
[6:38] so we just want to be conscious of that
[6:40] and have compassion
[6:41] and understand capstone love is a
[6:44] different kind of love
[6:46] it's a love of understanding based off
[6:48] revelation
[6:50] and we know amen that god is our refuge
[6:53] god is our strength he's our strong
[6:55] power his word will work
[6:56] his promises are true we're in the we're
[6:59] under the blood covenant we know that
[7:01] we're safe and we know that there's
[7:02] healing in the cup
[7:05] but it doesn't mean that that that
[7:07] revelation can be forced on somebody
[7:09] else
[7:11] and it doesn't mean that that puts us in
[7:12] a position where we incite panic and
[7:14] fear in somebody else's heart
[7:16] so we just have to have understanding
[7:17] because capstone the
[7:19] capstone is understanding knowing the
[7:22] difference
[7:22] that's gross darkness satan's eden
[7:27] has brought the people satan as the
[7:29] shepherd
[7:30] of this world has brought the people
[7:33] into destruction
[7:35] the pale horse riding in the fourth seal
[7:37] that anointing breaking out upon the
[7:39] earth
[7:39] is bringing death but praise god the
[7:43] true white horse writer is writing in
[7:45] our hearts
[7:46] christ what a contrast what two
[7:48] different paths we're on
[7:50] amen and we're coming to a time where
[7:52] we're starting to see there's two
[7:53] different paths that we're on
[7:55] and so we want to be conscious of that
[7:57] also let's look together at first peter
[8:00] chapter 3.
[8:08] first peter chapter 3.
[8:15] and verse 15.
[8:18] first peter 3 and 15 but sanctify the
[8:21] lord god in your hearts
[8:22] and be ready always to give an answer to
[8:24] every man that asks you a reason of the
[8:27] hope that is in you
[8:28] with meekness and fear i believe we're
[8:31] gonna have more
[8:32] opportunities to exercise this scripture
[8:34] in the next few weeks or months
[8:36] and i have a desire to because if
[8:40] somebody else can receive the hope that
[8:41] i have as far as i know the door to the
[8:44] ark isn't shut
[8:46] and noah never shut it and noah didn't
[8:49] desire to shut it
[8:50] noah was standing in the door until god
[8:52] sent him in saying come
[8:54] come come come come and i want to do the
[8:56] same thing
[8:57] stand in the door and say come come come
[8:59] until god says no more
[9:01] but as far as we know that door is still
[9:03] open and i want somebody to be able to
[9:05] receive what i have so i want somebody
[9:08] to be able to receive peace
[9:11] also in the assembly things are changing
[9:15] we've got a situation over the next few
[9:17] weeks maybe the next couple months
[9:19] where people are going to probably be
[9:21] sent home from work some have already
[9:22] been sent home
[9:23] some may some with pay maybe some
[9:26] without pay
[9:27] and so we want to watch one another and
[9:29] bind ourselves closer together
[9:31] and be conscious of where your brother's
[9:33] at and if you can help him help him if
[9:36] you if you know of a need and you can
[9:37] meet a need and meet a need but let's
[9:39] watch out for each other right now
[9:41] that's we're a family and god's put us
[9:43] together to watch for each other and
[9:45] care for one another
[9:46] and if you know of a need and you know
[9:48] you can't meet that need
[9:49] talk to one of the deacons and the
[9:50] deacons will make sure they get with
[9:52] whoever needs help
[9:53] we want to help one another because
[9:55] we're here for each other we're one
[9:57] family this is why god's brought us
[9:58] together
[10:00] and so we want to watch out for each
[10:01] other we want to encourage each other
[10:04] in the faith now is not the time to stay
[10:07] apart
[10:09] call one another text one another get
[10:11] together whenever you can
[10:13] and encourage one another in the word
[10:15] now is the time
[10:16] to be quoting scriptures and quotes to
[10:18] one another
[10:19] now's the time to be reminding each
[10:21] other of what we're standing on and what
[10:23] we're standing for
[10:24] and what god has done in our lives and
[10:26] what he intends to do
[10:27] and now is the time to really encourage
[10:29] one another this is the time to get
[10:31] closer not further apart this is the
[10:32] time to show greater brotherly love
[10:35] than than before and let the love of
[10:37] christ be expressed among
[10:38] us and this is also a time
[10:41] to be led by the spirit of god
[10:45] because everything
[10:49] is is changing i could say it that way
[10:52] everything's changing
[10:53] some things are becoming confusing some
[10:55] things are becoming more clear
[10:56] but it's going to take individual
[10:58] leadership to navigate the changes
[11:01] to know when to speak and when not to
[11:02] speak when to move and when not to move
[11:05] when to go and when to stay there's
[11:07] times that and we don't know
[11:09] that things will get more difficult or
[11:10] less difficult we don't know anything
[11:12] that'll happen next
[11:13] all i know is god's in control that
[11:16] everything's ticking just right on time
[11:18] but with that being said we need a
[11:20] greater sensitivity to the spirit of god
[11:23] and quit using our brains
[11:26] and be led by the inward inward movement
[11:28] of the spirit of god and let god
[11:30] tell us when to speak who to speak to
[11:33] when to be quiet
[11:35] right no more no more just doing things
[11:38] our own way
[11:40] amen the world used to be predictable it
[11:43] used to be steady you used to know what
[11:44] you used to we used to believe we knew
[11:46] what we were going to do on monday
[11:47] tuesday wednesday thursday friday
[11:49] we had the week planned out we had the
[11:50] calendar full and now
[11:52] god is god has taken away some of those
[11:54] things to say hey you know what
[11:56] i have no idea what will happen two
[11:57] hours from now
[11:59] but praise god i know who does
[12:02] i know the one who knows what'll happen
[12:04] two hours from now two months from now
[12:05] two years from now
[12:06] if there's that much time left in this
[12:08] condition i know the one who
[12:10] knows and so i just want to hold his
[12:11] hand because i don't know the next step
[12:14] i'm going to have to take but he's
[12:15] already got it figured out
[12:16] he already saw it in his mind before the
[12:18] foundation of the world and he's
[12:20] purposed that i would be here to act out
[12:22] what he's already seen
[12:24] and so now's the time you know if if
[12:26] we've watched the way god's been
[12:28] preaching the word to us
[12:29] it's about cut off the entertainments
[12:32] stop the foolishness
[12:33] be more sincere be more dedicated be
[12:36] more prayerful
[12:37] why because god knew this hour was
[12:38] coming
[12:40] and we didn't know it but god knew it
[12:44] and so now is the time to be more
[12:46] prayerful to be more consecrated to be
[12:48] more sincere
[12:50] amen so that we can hear that still
[12:51] small voice and be led by the spirit of
[12:53] god
[12:54] because we're moving into those crucial
[12:56] hours
[12:57] so even just this afternoon i heard word
[13:00] just in the last few hours
[13:02] that they closed all barber shops and
[13:05] hair salons
[13:06] so brother dave and brother craig wood
[13:08] and brother jeremy
[13:09] that's that's their business that's
[13:11] their livelihood and now they closed all
[13:13] the barber shops
[13:14] and that wasn't in the works from what
[13:15] we understood earlier but in the last
[13:17] few hours something else changed
[13:19] by the time we get out of here something
[13:20] else can change by time we wake up in
[13:22] the morning something else can change
[13:24] and i say god hide me under your wings
[13:28] lead me with thy staff let thy rod
[13:31] comfort me
[13:32] let me follow the shepherd let me just
[13:33] be holding to your hand
[13:36] now's the time now is the time to be
[13:40] more sincere
[13:42] trust gone don't forget the prayer times
[13:45] that are here
[13:46] friday and saturday one to five on
[13:48] friday and saturday five to ten
[13:50] i believe they're timely i believe cod
[13:53] called for him
[13:54] on time and i i know that it's having an
[13:58] effect on me
[14:00] and i enjoy the effect that it's having
[14:02] on me and i pray that god will just
[14:04] bless us all through that time
[14:07] so more than anything don't be afraid
[14:09] don't be scared
[14:11] when you see everything changing there's
[14:14] there's turmoil everywhere but inside
[14:18] there's an anticipation and excitement
[14:21] because god's doing something
[14:23] something's happening
[14:25] something's moving and i'm part of the
[14:27] move
[14:28] i may not know fully i may not be able
[14:31] to explain
[14:32] all but i know i'm part of the move
[14:34] something god's
[14:35] moving through something god's doing in
[14:37] this hour and we're part of it
[14:39] and i've got an anticipation and an
[14:41] enthusiasm in the midst of trouble and i
[14:44] said we
[14:44] we need to stay close together and
[14:46] encourage that in one another
[14:47] we need to fan those flames in each
[14:49] other saying this is the hour for a
[14:51] fuller manifestation of the word
[14:54] god has been so good to us friends
[14:57] that he has he has taught us over and
[15:00] over
[15:01] out of the message who we really are
[15:03] breaking spiritual news is showing us
[15:05] where we came from and
[15:07] what we're here for what his purpose is
[15:09] and where we're going showing
[15:10] who the bride is and where the mercy
[15:12] seat is and
[15:13] all of these wonderful truths that he's
[15:15] been giving to us what age we truly live
[15:17] in and
[15:18] where we're supposed to be positioned in
[15:19] christ and he's done all of that and
[15:21] we've received all of those truths
[15:23] but all of those truths are just to give
[15:25] us confidence in who we
[15:26] are so we can have confidence to live
[15:28] what he told us to live
[15:30] so all of those things weren't to
[15:32] tantalize us and make us excited about
[15:34] doctrine
[15:35] i mean although we're quite excited
[15:36] about the doctrine but all those things
[15:38] were
[15:39] were put together were taught to us were
[15:41] brought to us
[15:42] so that we would have a clear
[15:44] understanding of who we really are
[15:46] so that in the hour of trouble we're not
[15:48] going to be shaking because we're on a
[15:49] firm foundation that i
[15:50] part of christ i come from god i go to
[15:55] god i will not be lost he hasn't forgot
[15:57] about me
[15:58] he did he knows exactly where i am and
[16:00] exactly what condition i'm in
[16:02] and i'm at total rest with that the
[16:04] headship has come to unite with the body
[16:06] i'm in the invisible union with my lord
[16:08] my headship
[16:09] and i don't have to be afraid or worry
[16:11] because he's going to take care of me
[16:14] all of those moved were supposed to move
[16:17] from teachings and doctrines to life
[16:20] and this is the hour we have to know who
[16:22] we are and
[16:24] what our purpose on this earth is and
[16:26] what he's commissioned us for
[16:27] and now is the time for manifestation of
[16:30] all we've learned
[16:32] i say praise be to god let us stay
[16:35] humble loving compassionate
[16:39] we're bold in faith because we believe
[16:42] but not arrogant and not harsh or
[16:45] critical
[16:46] bold and faith and we can talk bold with
[16:48] one another as much as we want
[16:50] but when you get on amongst a paranoid
[16:52] world who's scared
[16:53] it's time to express compassion and
[16:56] concern
[16:57] and sympathy not that we don't tell the
[16:59] truth
[17:00] but that inward spirit tells you when to
[17:02] speak and when not to speak
[17:09] [Music]
[17:16] amen
[17:18] [Music]
[17:26] [Music]
[17:28] he wants all of my heart
[17:34] all he wants

[20:32] is
[20:35] amen god bless you all so good to be
[20:38] with you this evening
[20:39] i'll say it i said it on sunday i was
[20:41] happy when they said unto me let us go
[20:43] into the house of the lord amen
[20:45] now we don't know how many more times
[20:46] we're going to have this opportunity but
[20:48] while we have the opportunity
[20:49] i'm happy to see you hey and i always
[20:52] appreciate these these are precious
[20:55] moments for us
[20:56] and we want to take every opportunity to
[20:59] keep doing this as long as we can
[21:01] so if you don't mind if you'll just take
[21:03] your bibles
[21:05] we will go right to the little thought
[21:09] and god's laid on my heart i know it's
[21:11] here somewhere there it is
[21:13] if you could turn to exodus
[21:17] chapter 19.
[21:26] exodus chapters 19.
[21:34] starting at verse 3
[21:38] and moses went up unto god and the lord
[21:41] called unto him
[21:42] out of the mountain saying thus shout
[21:45] thou say
[21:46] to the house of jacob and tell the
[21:48] children of israel
[21:49] ye have seen what i did unto the
[21:51] egyptians and how i
[21:53] bear you up on eagle's wings and i
[21:56] brought you
[21:56] unto myself now therefore if you will
[22:00] obey my voice indeed and keep my
[22:02] commandment
[22:03] then ye shall be a peculiar treasure
[22:05] unto me above all people
[22:07] and for all the earth is mine and ye
[22:10] shall be unto me a kingdom of priests
[22:12] and a holy nation these are the words
[22:15] which thou
[22:15] shalt speak unto the children of israel
[22:19] and if you'll also turn to isaiah 40.
[22:37] isaiah 40 verses 28
[22:46] hast thou not known hast thou not heard
[22:49] that the everlasting god the lord the
[22:52] creator of the ends of the earth
[22:53] fainteth not
[22:54] neither is weary there is no searching
[22:57] of his understanding
[22:59] he giveth power to the faint and to them
[23:01] that have no might he increases their
[23:03] strength
[23:04] even the youth shall faint and be weary
[23:07] and the young men shall utterly fall
[23:09] but they that wait upon the lord shall
[23:11] renew their strength
[23:12] they shall mount up with wings as eagles
[23:15] they shall run
[23:16] and not be weary they shall walk and not
[23:20] faint i believe the spirit of the lord's
[23:23] just leading a certain way because i
[23:24] think everything that brother chad said
[23:26] i either have that scripture i have that
[23:28] quote
[23:29] so we're just trusting the lord he knows
[23:30] how to encourage us in these things and
[23:33] these uncertain times i kept getting
[23:35] calls all day today from different
[23:37] individuals either losing their jobs or
[23:40] financial problems and it finally got to
[23:42] the point i
[23:43] i just said i there is no sure place to
[23:46] stand
[23:47] except for christ there is no other
[23:50] solid rock that i know of there's
[23:51] nothing i can tell you there's nothing i
[23:53] can
[23:54] say other than i would stand upon a
[23:57] revelation at this point in this hour
[23:59] so let's just go to the lord in prayer
[24:02] most gracious heavenly father lord we
[24:04] come before you lord
[24:06] honored and humbled lord that by your
[24:08] grace we know that you we are yours
[24:10] lord we know that you hold the earth in
[24:13] the palm of your hand lord your eyes on
[24:15] the sparrow how much more of you
[24:16] watching over us
[24:18] father lord we have such a confidence
[24:20] and a rest and an assurance lord that
[24:23] you are in total control and father god
[24:26] i just pray lord that you would take
[24:28] this evening lord
[24:30] i know that i'm insufficient and i'm
[24:32] unable lord
[24:33] i have no ability of my own lord god i
[24:36] just pray lord that you would take this
[24:38] consecrated time that's been set aside
[24:40] lord to hear your word
[24:42] and you would anoint me lord to move me
[24:44] out of the way and just say those things
[24:45] that you once said
[24:47] lord shut my lips to anything that
[24:48] wouldn't be right
[24:50] lord anything that would maybe puff me
[24:52] up don't allow it father
[24:53] for there's only one worthy lord amongst
[24:56] us and that's you father
[24:57] so lord god i just pray lord you take
[24:59] this time
[25:00] lord and you would just brew over your
[25:02] people lord
[25:04] and lord that you would just bring glory
[25:06] unto yourself
[25:07] as your word said if i be lifted up i'll
[25:10] draw all men
[25:10] unto me so father we're here to glorify
[25:13] you to honor you to respect you and to
[25:15] love you
[25:16] and to lord to look at your word and to
[25:19] believe it with all that is in us father
[25:21] god
[25:22] lord we love you and we know that for
[25:23] this great hour and this time we've been
[25:25] called
[25:26] so lord god i just pray lord that you
[25:28] would move and speak to us and tell us
[25:30] what you want us to know
[25:32] we love you in jesus name amen
[25:35] amen you may be seated
[25:39] so a little bit of a tricky day for me
[25:43] to prepare it really was i'll be honest
[25:45] with you so it may be more just talking
[25:47] from my heart
[25:48] i just i'm a little shocked i'll be
[25:51] honest with you
[25:52] at the amount of unprecedented changes
[25:54] that seem to be happening every
[25:56] no longer a week or day but seemingly
[25:59] every hour
[26:01] but it just gives us such assurance that
[26:03] this world is falling apart
[26:05] and the only thing that will stand is
[26:06] god's word because he said heavens and
[26:08] earth will pass away but my word will
[26:10] never fail
[26:11] and i believe god likes to show his
[26:13] great strength on behalf of his beloved
[26:15] bride
[26:16] i just have a feeling that the mighty
[26:17] conqueror is still a mighty conqueror
[26:19] i just have a feeling that inside of him
[26:22] is still this longing attribute to say
[26:24] wait till i show my great strength to my
[26:26] wife to my bride who's been humbly
[26:29] taking me at my word for all these years
[26:32] i'm going to show her how much i love
[26:34] her and how much i've got it
[26:36] all under control so i am i i will i
[26:39] don't mean to say it arrogantly i am
[26:41] excited
[26:42] uh i am extremely excited to see what my
[26:45] god is going to do
[26:47] in an hour like this he loves moments
[26:49] like this when all odds seem to be
[26:51] getting stacked
[26:52] against just before the devil could
[26:54] accomplish his cowardly goals right
[26:56] it's sure paving the way for some
[26:58] interesting things to be happening
[27:01] as we go and i just wanted to share you
[27:04] know brother
[27:04] chad had mentioned there um a picture i
[27:07] had sent him there last sunday
[27:10] and because about three um three months
[27:12] ago i had um
[27:13] had my computer crashed and like all
[27:15] things you know i'm looking for a screen
[27:16] saver
[27:17] and i had had a conversation a couple
[27:20] weeks even before that with brother
[27:22] jeremy and i said you know
[27:23] brother jamie i says it's not that i
[27:25] don't think there's more ground to take
[27:27] when it comes to the word
[27:29] but why is there such a feeling inside
[27:30] of me that it's time to manifest the
[27:32] things that we've already taken
[27:34] a hold of and and it just there was just
[27:37] this
[27:37] conversation just a statement right
[27:39] jeremy it wasn't anything overly thought
[27:41] it was just a statement we were just
[27:42] talking i think we both agreed it just
[27:44] comes to a point in time
[27:45] we love the word like brother chad was
[27:47] saying but these things are preparing
[27:48] for us for a life to be manifested
[27:51] the seven still expressed in a mom and
[27:53] then a dad and a mechanic and a farmer
[27:55] who looks like all hopes are lost but
[27:57] they're just taking the god at his word
[27:58] and
[27:59] god is supernaturally supplying all of
[28:00] their needs according to his riches and
[28:02] glory
[28:03] and there's nothing out of catering he's
[28:04] just waiting for the opportunity
[28:07] so i had um you know i had preached a
[28:11] sermon
[28:12] well so i had i came across the picture
[28:14] and i wanted to put it
[28:16] on my computer like three months ago and
[28:18] and
[28:19] i just was looking for an eagle picture
[28:21] and this is the the picture i've been
[28:22] asked a lot about this picture so i
[28:24] wanted to at least show it to you
[28:25] that i had put on my my computer and
[28:28] it's it's just simply an eagle taking
[28:30] flight
[28:31] but um the course that it's taking is is
[28:33] directly into the storm it's not away
[28:35] from the storm
[28:36] right so it's an interesting situation
[28:38] that i hadn't even thought about and
[28:39] this picture never struck me brother
[28:41] paul until uh sister naomi sang that
[28:43] song
[28:44] a time to fly and i was just liking the
[28:46] picture of the eagle but i didn't
[28:47] realize that the
[28:50] direction the eagle was pointed was
[28:52] headed right into a storm
[28:54] and but it's fitting and it put me to
[28:57] tears after i listened to sister naomi's
[28:58] song and then
[28:59] i kind of just got overly emotional
[29:01] because if you also look at this
[29:03] um i had a i have a little portion of a
[29:06] computer that does facial recognition i
[29:07] know
[29:08] strange right but and if you'll notice
[29:10] in the top it says looking for you
[29:14] so i said oh could it be uh this storm's
[29:17] looking for me
[29:19] yeah i think so um so we can get upset
[29:22] about what's going on
[29:23] but i'll be honest with you it's just
[29:25] birth pains it's just the birth pains of
[29:27] a great bride that's coming forward
[29:29] and it's the whole earth groaning
[29:31] waiting for the manifestations of the
[29:33] sons of god and god knows just exactly
[29:35] how to get out of her
[29:37] what he has placed into her so it comes
[29:39] a certain point in time you don't get
[29:41] too upset about it you know
[29:43] for this purpose came i on this earth i
[29:46] came here as an expressed attribute of
[29:48] his life
[29:49] and i'm here to express it and he's
[29:50] going to prove his word
[29:52] and that proving of his word is in my
[29:54] life and so this life has to be put to
[29:56] the test
[29:57] and he's putting it to the test each and
[29:58] every one of us and i'm excited for
[30:00] what's going to come as a result of that
[30:04] so in looking at that i just wanted to
[30:06] take some time like i said just talking
[30:08] to you tonight
[30:09] i just want to take some time at um of
[30:12] considering these storms that are surely
[30:14] coming
[30:14] and the the effects of the storm and the
[30:16] purpose of the storm for us
[30:18] as individuals so i titled this little
[30:20] thought into the storm
[30:22] um because here we go it was and it's
[30:26] um there's certain things happening i
[30:28] don't exactly
[30:29] understand a full um you know you could
[30:32] get almost confused just saying okay the
[30:34] germs and
[30:34] all this stuff and then you see the
[30:36] economic collapse so one thing is for
[30:37] sure
[30:38] this is greatly setting up some things
[30:40] that are
[30:41] are going to be um very drastic changes
[30:45] you see the panic in the eyes of the
[30:47] people my wife was getting
[30:49] milk at walmart the other day and you
[30:51] know that she said that the cashier lady
[30:53] stopped a woman she had a whole grocery
[30:55] cart full of milk and
[30:56] she said you can't take a whole grocery
[30:58] cart full of me you're allowed to have
[30:59] two
[31:00] two gallons of milk and she said the
[31:02] woman looked at her and got angry at him
[31:03] just get out of my way woman
[31:05] and um she told carrie i said 30
[31:07] something years i've been here i've
[31:08] never seen a person act like that
[31:11] yeah so they're sh they have no sure
[31:14] place to stand
[31:16] they they're they know it they know that
[31:19] this is all that this world has to offer
[31:20] them
[31:21] the only safety and security they can
[31:23] have is what they can provide in their
[31:25] own hands
[31:26] and at the same time they're trying to
[31:28] grab everything we're trying our hardest
[31:29] to give up everything
[31:32] they're trying to get a hold of as much
[31:33] as they can and i'm doing everything i
[31:35] can to get rid of everything that i've
[31:37] uh of gathered up over the last 36 years
[31:40] of my life
[31:41] i've realized that everything i've been
[31:42] working so hard at was just the very
[31:44] things that was hindering my ability to
[31:45] take off flight where i was supposed to
[31:47] go from the beginning
[31:48] and this is a new paradigm and a new
[31:50] reality for me that i'm getting more
[31:52] excited about
[31:53] because we we know this that in this
[31:55] world full of independence is a sign of
[31:57] maturity as brother aaron said but he
[31:59] but in the spiritual realm of things
[32:01] complete dependence
[32:02] dependency upon god is the sign of true
[32:05] maturity
[32:06] and that's where i believe that each and
[32:08] every one of us has to come to and i
[32:09] believe these are the great
[32:10] opportunities god's giving us at this
[32:12] moment
[32:12] to really let go and give it away i'm
[32:16] not trying to see how much hand
[32:17] sanitizer i can stock up
[32:18] not trying to see how much toilet paper
[32:20] i can get or how much meat i can get in
[32:22] my freezer
[32:23] not at all at this point i don't want
[32:25] anything
[32:26] all i got and all i need was this from
[32:29] the beginning this is all we ever needed
[32:31] and we tried to substitute this with so
[32:33] many other things along the way and all
[32:35] it did was spiritually
[32:36] the bride of jesus christ and i don't
[32:38] say those things disrespectfully but
[32:40] let's be honest there was an immature
[32:42] bride on the scene and it was a young
[32:44] bride that was coming to full maturity
[32:45] and you know and the prophet of god in
[32:47] his wisdom knew he was talking to a
[32:48] young bride
[32:49] but you go listen to countdown and
[32:52] you'll see that he's speaking
[32:53] in such a way that he knows that a
[32:54] mature bride will come on the scene at a
[32:56] later date and time that'll be able to
[32:58] take those deeper things
[32:59] that'll be able to understand and take
[33:01] it and not take offense to it
[33:02] but say praise god that's where he
[33:04] wanted me from the beginning and that's
[33:05] where i'm going
[33:07] so these things when it comes to music
[33:08] and it comes to these things this is
[33:10] just a maturing bride
[33:12] that's no that's no anger at a person
[33:14] there's no anger at my brother or my
[33:15] sister hey why don't you
[33:16] no hey we're all guilty and we're all
[33:18] growing up let's grow up together
[33:19] let's take full possession of those
[33:21] things that we were called to right
[33:23] so it's just a maturing time it's just a
[33:25] maturing time and i'm a part
[33:27] i'm proud to be maturing with all of you
[33:30] all right
[33:31] so i appreciate how the word's been
[33:33] coming forward and i appreciate the
[33:35] cutting off cutting off cutting off
[33:38] right
[33:38] it's we know we're all guilty we all
[33:41] have things in areas of our unbelief
[33:43] that we've been compromising in for far
[33:44] too long
[33:45] each and every one of us know those
[33:47] little areas but little too much
[33:49] confidence in our ability
[33:50] too much confidence in our will power
[33:52] too much confidence and even our
[33:54] intellect
[33:54] our knowledge of the message and then
[33:56] none of it you didn't really
[33:58] set your wings you were supposed to be
[34:00] sons of god led by the spirit of god in
[34:02] all things in everything everything we
[34:05] do we were supposed to be able to
[34:07] ride that wave of the holy ghost and
[34:08] just have just wherever it takes me
[34:10] that's where i'll go
[34:12] so maybe god is just giving that
[34:13] opportunity to us once more
[34:15] i'm excited where that'll take us huh
[34:19] so if you'll turn to mark the book of
[34:22] mark
[34:25] and i did put a powerpoint together
[34:27] because i do have some lengthy reading i
[34:29] hope that's okay tonight
[34:30] and i didn't want to just sit here and
[34:32] read i know it's hard to hold
[34:34] your minds like that so i but i so i put
[34:37] the powerpoint so you can follow
[34:39] the direction and we're going
[34:43] in mark chapter 4 verse 37.
[34:49] it says and there arose a great storm of
[34:51] wind and the waves beat into the ship so
[34:53] that it was
[34:54] now full and he was in the hinder part
[34:56] of the ship asleep on a pillow
[34:58] and they awakened him and he said unto
[35:00] him master cares
[35:01] not or cares thou not that we perish and
[35:04] he arose and rebuked the wind and said
[35:06] unto the sea peace
[35:07] be still and the wind ceased and there
[35:10] was a great calm
[35:11] and he said unto them why are you so
[35:14] fearful
[35:15] how is it that you have no faith
[35:18] and brother chad brought this out so
[35:19] perfectly you know just to lay the
[35:21] foundation here what is he looking for
[35:23] when the storm comes on
[35:25] he's looking for faith and he says when
[35:27] i come back will i find it
[35:29] will i find faith when the storm comes
[35:31] on you know will i be saying what the
[35:33] word says
[35:34] or will i be tossed to and fro with the
[35:36] every wind and every wave that comes my
[35:38] way
[35:39] or will i have a steadfast assuredness
[35:41] that i'm standing
[35:42] and he's not just in the boat he's in me
[35:46] right for he said greater is he that's
[35:48] in you than he that is in the world the
[35:50] boat may be going down
[35:51] but i can't go down because he's in me
[35:54] right and brother branham says in
[35:56] calling jesus on the scene he says now
[35:58] christ is in the church reconciling the
[36:00] people to god
[36:01] he promised to do it as if it has been
[36:05] written that
[36:05] he is the same yesterday today and
[36:08] forever you believe that
[36:09] congregation says amen i believe it with
[36:13] all my heart and he is just waiting to
[36:15] be called on the scene
[36:17] now the only thing can call him on the
[36:19] scene
[36:20] is for us to awaken him in ourselves
[36:23] call him on the scene so many times
[36:27] we're looking off for a minister to do
[36:29] something for us or
[36:30] we're looking for god to come down with
[36:32] an angel and part the way for us and
[36:34] and all he's waiting for is say hey what
[36:36] did i put inside of you
[36:37] you've got the word speak and go forward
[36:40] right
[36:41] you see he's setting up the opportunity
[36:43] for all those little amateur gods
[36:44] to really express what they were called
[36:46] for right
[36:50] so now here comes the lengthy readings
[36:53] so let's just hang with me a little bit
[36:56] what is cancer what is disease we'll
[36:59] deal on that for the next five minutes
[37:01] now what is cancer
[37:02] what caused that thing let's take a
[37:05] cancer
[37:05] anything that you wish to take
[37:07] tubercular pneumonia whatever you wish
[37:09] to any disease diseases or germs
[37:12] let me pass something here quickly as
[37:14] our time is going
[37:15] listen did you know the bible predicts
[37:17] that in the last days there will be germ
[37:19] warfare
[37:20] that diseases will break out upon the
[37:21] people and they'll fall on
[37:23] everyone without the baptism of the holy
[37:25] ghost the spirit
[37:27] but when the with the angel who or who
[37:29] had charge over these plagues was given
[37:31] orders to touch
[37:33] none of them who have them who the mark
[37:36] was
[37:37] why how much kind of teachers have we
[37:39] got to be brethren to get the church in
[37:41] order
[37:43] get the church in order first to be in
[37:46] that kind of a condition
[37:47] immune you know the government is
[37:50] spending billions and billions and
[37:52] billions of dollars trying to find the
[37:53] vaccine and the little do they realize
[37:56] it's right here there's certain things
[37:58] that science not going to be able to
[38:00] solve
[38:00] that it's only a spiritual immunity
[38:02] against and it's right here if they only
[38:05] knew
[38:06] that there was a place of refuge that
[38:08] there is a city of refuge
[38:10] a new jerusalem a bride adorned for a
[38:12] groom upon the earth
[38:14] my arms are sore now brother bam says
[38:16] from where doctors had punched needles
[38:18] into it and tried to inoculate me from
[38:20] yellow fever and so forth i told them i
[38:22] didn't need it
[38:23] but they wouldn't listen to me but i'll
[38:25] tell you
[38:26] what god's going to do god's got a serum
[38:28] and it's called the holy ghost
[38:30] and when that serum goes in it
[38:31] inoculates you hallelujah and in the
[38:34] last days
[38:35] in these last days but look friend the
[38:38] time is coming
[38:40] that when there is rising up a church if
[38:43] we can't have faith for divine healing
[38:45] how are you going to have faith for how
[38:46] are you going to have
[38:48] how are you going to have for a rapture
[38:51] you've got to move out
[38:53] friend we've got to get out of this old
[38:56] slow church condition that we're in
[38:59] and step out launch out cut the
[39:01] shorelines and get out into somewhere
[39:04] where you lose all senses of fear and
[39:07] doubt
[39:08] out where there are all things possible
[39:10] brother just as free as it can be
[39:13] you've got to sail sail set towards
[39:16] heaven
[39:17] nothing can stir you no way you've got
[39:20] that way
[39:20] that's all nothing can harm you
[39:25] so maybe these are the opportunities
[39:26] that he wants us to set ourselves right
[39:28] into
[39:28] now that's the kind of church it's going
[39:30] to be one of these days according to the
[39:32] bible where the angel poured out his
[39:34] wrath and the diseases broke out
[39:36] and men even rotted in their flesh there
[39:38] where they were standing and the fowl of
[39:39] the air came down and
[39:41] eat the eat off of the shoulders and the
[39:43] flesh of captains and great mens and
[39:45] presidents and warriors and diplomats
[39:46] and potentiates and everything
[39:48] and the angel was given charge don't you
[39:50] come near anyone
[39:51] that's got the seal of god in their
[39:53] forehead it's going to be one of these
[39:56] days divine healing is going to be a
[39:59] great thing
[39:59] among the people so let's get in
[40:02] condition
[40:03] god wants us you say well brother
[40:05] branham you say let's
[40:06] that's what god's waiting on we're
[40:10] waiting on jesus to return and jesus is
[40:13] waiting
[40:13] on us you say well how
[40:17] what can we do about it the bible said
[40:19] that the hour has come that the bride
[40:21] has made herself
[40:22] ready amen this is the hour that she has
[40:26] made herself ready consecrating
[40:29] separating you know the great thing
[40:31] about jesus that really stuck out to me
[40:33] is he separated he consecrated himself
[40:36] for others he separated himself he
[40:39] sanctified himself he said for others
[40:41] sake
[40:42] and that great hour where he could have
[40:44] chosen a path that would have
[40:45] made him more comfortable he chose a
[40:47] harder way
[40:48] but he chose a harder way for me and you
[40:51] now will the bride walk in his footsteps
[40:53] i believe brother ben she will the
[40:55] sermon that we heard from brother ben we
[40:57] know that the bride is walking in his
[40:58] footsteps because she's bone of his bone
[41:00] life of his life the same character and
[41:03] attributes of jesus christ expressed in
[41:04] the mail
[41:05] is now being expressed in the female so
[41:07] now is our great opportunity to sanctify
[41:09] and set ourselves apart
[41:11] it shouldn't have to be that we have to
[41:12] get pushed and prodded we should say
[41:14] thank you lord
[41:15] i appreciate this nether opportunity to
[41:17] draw closer unto you
[41:18] and to kill myself for others sake
[41:22] because there's others that are going to
[41:23] be watching you like you've
[41:25] never thought before everybody's going
[41:28] to be watching you
[41:29] they're going to watch your reaction
[41:30] they're going to watch your word they're
[41:32] going to watch your
[41:33] emotions are going to see what happens
[41:35] with you under the squeeze
[41:37] god's setting it all up he knows how to
[41:40] bring attention
[41:42] to his bride and the thing he wants the
[41:43] whole world to take notice of
[41:45] he's setting it all up brother branham
[41:48] also says in 1960 god's provided way
[41:51] how we thank thee that in this great
[41:53] hour that when all hopes of mortal life
[41:55] is finished atomic bombs our lane and
[41:57] hangers and hydrogen bombs and sickness
[41:59] and disease and germ warfare
[42:01] oh god and everything the way it is
[42:03] knowing that the bible said that a man
[42:05] would actually rot in their flesh and
[42:08] the angel was given commission
[42:10] don't you touch any of those don't you
[42:12] come near
[42:13] those who has the wine and the oil
[42:16] don't touch those who has the seal of
[42:19] god
[42:20] upon their forehead do we have anything
[42:23] to be afraid of
[42:24] no we've already taken the vaccine
[42:28] we've already been inoculated
[42:32] let's just keep going 1963 accepting
[42:34] god's provided way at the end time now
[42:36] some of them said
[42:37] well now if the plagues fall we'll just
[42:39] go in a hospital
[42:41] if the plague now if the plague happens
[42:43] to fall you know what we'll do
[42:44] we'll go get dr jones we'll know he'll
[42:46] know how to take care of it
[42:48] it didn't work yet they were smart well
[42:50] if the plagues fall we'll just go down
[42:52] beneath the ground
[42:53] in a cave we'll shut the door
[42:57] that that won't do it one bit of good
[42:59] we'll stay home
[43:01] we'll put a mask over our face we'll put
[43:03] in some disinfectant on it
[43:05] didn't do a bit of good god
[43:08] made a provided way yes
[43:12] and it was what the blood god provided
[43:15] it as
[43:16] simple as it seemed to take the blood of
[43:20] the lamb and sprinkle the door
[43:22] yet god said that that was his way and
[43:25] he
[43:25] honored it all out from under the blood
[43:29] died the firstborn
[43:34] now i'm not drawing any conclusions but
[43:37] i'm going to make a little statement
[43:39] and i'm maybe going out on a limb i can
[43:40] be corrected i told him he could be
[43:41] wrong
[43:42] but it was a first born now we all know
[43:47] that something striking a certain age
[43:49] generation
[43:51] that are more susceptible at this moment
[43:53] very clear
[43:55] 70 to 80 years old most susceptible
[43:58] prophet of god was on the scene the word
[44:00] came forward
[44:01] and the first to reject it i may be
[44:04] going on a limb
[44:05] but at least just it's interesting may
[44:08] not be true
[44:09] it's just interesting but they died
[44:14] who rejected the simplicity of a prophet
[44:17] and his message in their day
[44:18] and they rejected the pathway to the
[44:20] blood was which was by the word
[44:22] in its simplicity and they made they
[44:25] said it's foolishness it's nonsense we
[44:27] have our churches we have our doctrines
[44:29] we have our creeds
[44:30] we don't need what that fanatic is
[44:32] saying and they're going to call us
[44:34] fanatics for saying these things
[44:36] but that's okay i'm in good company
[44:43] christ comes 1954. christ comes three
[44:45] times the first time he came to redeem
[44:47] his church is that right the second time
[44:49] he comes to receive
[44:50] his church and the third time comes with
[44:52] his church
[44:53] he come to redeem her he comes to
[44:55] rapture her and be caught away in the
[44:57] time of the plagues and so forth
[44:59] returns back to the millennium and lives
[45:01] through the millennium wow
[45:05] and i'm getting more excited time just
[45:07] keeps moving on
[45:09] so we've got nothing to fear now let's
[45:12] go to psalms 27
[45:13] i i don't mean to be moving but we just
[45:15] have a lot to read and lot to go through
[45:18] and i just want to bring one little
[45:20] portion of this obviously
[45:21] i have it highlighted but i think it'd
[45:23] be good for us to read this
[45:25] brother branham preaches the rapture
[45:26] quotes psalms 27
[45:28] psalm of david the lord is the light of
[45:30] as my light and my
[45:32] salvation whom shall i fear the lord is
[45:34] the strength of my life of whom shall i
[45:36] be afraid
[45:37] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[45:39] foes came up to eat my
[45:40] flesh they stumbled and fell though and
[45:43] hoes should encamp against me
[45:44] my heart shall not fear the war should
[45:47] rise against me and this will i be
[45:49] confident
[45:50] one thing have i desired of the lord
[45:52] that i will seek after that i may dwell
[45:54] in the house of the lord all the days of
[45:55] my life
[45:56] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[45:58] inquire in his temple
[46:00] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[46:02] me in his pavilion
[46:03] and in the secret of his tabernacle
[46:05] shall he hide me
[46:06] he shall set me upon a rock
[46:11] and now shall my head be lifted up
[46:15] above mine enemies round about me
[46:18] therefore will i offer in his tabernacle
[46:21] sacrifices of joy so you want to know
[46:24] the greatest witness in this time
[46:26] be happy smile
[46:30] yeah don't let nothing put a frown on
[46:32] your face
[46:33] conduct yourself with joy in the midst
[46:35] of the trial brother ben i'm saying
[46:38] and now shall my head be lifted up on my
[46:40] enemies and my enemies round about me
[46:41] therefore will i offer in his tabernacle
[46:43] sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i was
[46:45] seeing praises
[46:47] unto the lord boy there's another one
[46:49] next time you're in walmart
[46:51] you know what to do start singing with a
[46:54] big old smile on your face there you go
[46:57] you're going to stand out like a sore
[46:59] thumb and it'll set quite a testimony
[47:02] in the place of panic like that hear o
[47:05] lord when i cry with my voice and have
[47:06] mercy upon me
[47:08] and answer me when thou said i seek ye
[47:11] my face
[47:12] my heart said unto thee thy face lord
[47:14] will i seek
[47:16] hide not thy face far from me and put
[47:18] not thy servant away in
[47:19] anger thou hast been my help leave me
[47:22] not neither forsake me
[47:24] o god of my salvation when my father
[47:27] and my mother forsake me then the lord
[47:29] will take me
[47:30] up now i just want to hone in on that
[47:34] when my father and my mother forsake me
[47:36] then the lord will take me up and i had
[47:39] always read that many times and i gotta
[47:40] think well maybe my mom
[47:42] reject me my dad reject me my family
[47:44] would reject me and
[47:45] that could be that could be part of it i
[47:47] don't doubt that many of us have all
[47:49] went through that
[47:50] in some form or fashion but just want to
[47:53] think about this for a moment
[47:54] um but the the hebrew word here for
[47:57] forsake is as
[47:59] as ab to leave or to loose or to forsake
[48:02] or to
[48:02] depart from or to leave behind to let
[48:05] alone to leave abandon forsake neglect
[48:08] to let loose of to set free let go
[48:11] to free and i want to look at ephesians
[48:15] 5 for this call shall a man leave his
[48:17] father and his mother and shall be
[48:18] joined unto his wife and
[48:20] they too shall be one flesh this is a
[48:23] great mystery but i speak to you
[48:24] concerning christ
[48:26] and the church so i know this may sound
[48:29] a little strange but you know let's just
[48:31] take me for a moment
[48:32] for many many years of my life i had a
[48:35] name of a kyle weikert
[48:37] i had a reputation and i had an identity
[48:40] that i found in
[48:41] my dad and our family and as time grew
[48:44] on i i
[48:45] went to school and i got strong and i
[48:48] played sports and had a lot of
[48:49] confidence in the physical body that i
[48:50] had and the intellectual mind that i had
[48:53] and
[48:53] had an ability to maybe navigate through
[48:56] work life and
[48:57] do certain things and had confidence in
[48:59] my reasoning abilities and my
[49:02] you would say ability to interact with
[49:04] people i had a lot of
[49:05] confidence in the things that always
[49:08] provided for me
[49:10] for my whole life you know a man's
[49:12] strength provides for him
[49:14] a man's intellect provides a way for him
[49:16] gives him a certain identity
[49:19] but in just thinking of that as a child
[49:22] as just a little girl you would say
[49:24] she's completely identified in her home
[49:26] with her mother and her father and
[49:27] that's all she knows but
[49:29] as that little girl comes to full
[49:31] maturity she one day
[49:32] leaves everything that once provided for
[49:35] her
[49:36] protected her gave her her identity
[49:39] and she's handed off to fully embrace
[49:42] another man
[49:44] and i just wonder a little bit from me
[49:46] and for each of us
[49:48] for how long have we been finding our
[49:51] security
[49:52] and our confidence and our
[49:55] strength and our human reasoning and our
[49:58] human ability
[50:00] willpower strength
[50:03] family name family tradition
[50:07] strong heritage but there comes a point
[50:10] in time i got to leave it all
[50:12] to unite with christ there comes a point
[50:15] in time where nothing else can go in
[50:17] there
[50:18] just me and him my intellect can't go
[50:22] my reasoning can't go my emotions can't
[50:25] go
[50:26] it's just me faith taking hold of him
[50:29] the word that's it so maybe it's not a
[50:33] bad thing when all these things start to
[50:35] fail
[50:36] and my mother and my father forsake me
[50:38] because maybe that's
[50:39] finally for the first time in my life
[50:42] that the lord will truly take me up
[50:46] remember my uh sermon there on enoch's
[50:48] journey home
[50:50] you know he just was walking with the
[50:52] lord and slowly
[50:54] everything was falling away until one
[50:57] day
[50:57] he walked with god so long that god took
[50:59] him just gathered him right up into
[51:01] myself he had fully maybe finally
[51:04] fully believed and embraced that word
[51:06] but step by step revelation by
[51:08] revelation
[51:09] one step at a time word by word he was
[51:12] building
[51:12] he was building coming higher coming
[51:14] higher coming higher
[51:16] until he could finally take flight
[51:20] i don't think it's going to be too far
[51:21] off for that for us
[51:24] just one step at a time so finally
[51:26] saying you know lord
[51:27] i can't figure this out anymore lord i
[51:31] really don't have an ability to navigate
[51:32] this situation i really don't know
[51:35] what to do and then he can finally say
[51:38] finally
[51:39] why don't you come with me and i think
[51:41] that's what we're going through
[51:42] and i think that's what god's preparing
[51:44] us for a truly forsaking of all things
[51:46] and just taking god at his word
[51:48] at this point so
[51:52] another little lengthy reading um
[51:56] brother branham says an eagle in her
[51:57] nest and you know there may be
[51:59] many a little eagle been walking in some
[52:02] old denominational chicken yard for a
[52:04] long time
[52:04] sitting here tonight that's right but i
[52:07] hope that he calls you and says son
[52:09] you're mine what must i do lord that was
[52:12] the cry she said just make
[52:15] first big jump and flop your wings and
[52:18] he made the first jump and flopped his
[52:20] wings
[52:20] and he found out he wasn't earthbound
[52:23] anymore
[52:24] because he sat on a barnyard post right
[52:27] in the center of a pentecostal
[52:29] organization
[52:31] his mother said son you've got to come
[52:34] higher than that or you can't
[52:37] or i can't get you
[52:40] said just give another jump and i'll
[52:43] bear you up on my wings
[52:46] you see so it's a good thing to forsake
[52:48] all it's a good thing to abandon and be
[52:50] forsaken by mother and by father and
[52:52] everything that once
[52:53] gave us strength and hope and protection
[52:56] because that one next jump
[52:57] throws us right into his arms and that's
[53:00] where we're going by faith
[53:02] if there's anything the church of the
[53:03] living god needs tonight it's another
[53:06] jump from all the barriers of
[53:08] denomination
[53:09] from all the isms just cut loose every
[53:12] life
[53:13] every line go free and jump
[53:16] he will bear you away on the wings of
[53:18] the great speckled bird
[53:20] it's such meetings as this at such times
[53:23] as this it's such an
[53:24] audience as this where he can make it
[53:27] make
[53:28] that great jump to feel his power reach
[53:30] under
[53:31] reach under us with his word and bear us
[53:34] away
[53:34] from the little earthly cares and things
[53:37] that we have
[53:38] he's your father and he loves you the
[53:41] nest during time has already come
[53:43] but we need another jump we got
[53:46] to the barnyard post but we need to get
[53:50] free
[53:50] so we can just ride on his wings for our
[53:54] first
[53:54] solo flight what a joy it will be
[53:58] when that great final day comes
[54:02] and those that know how to jump and flop
[54:05] their wings
[54:06] those who know how to do it someday
[54:08] he'll come that great eagle
[54:10] of the sky shall come in glory and he'll
[54:12] spread forth his great power
[54:14] the holy spirit and those who are
[54:16] magnetized to it
[54:18] shall take a ride for eternity forever
[54:21] amen you see why i'm saying what i said
[54:24] let's take one more jump we did jump
[54:27] we know we're not earthbound but we
[54:29] gotta take one more jump
[54:30] and that's a reckless abandonment to
[54:32] take god at his word an
[54:34] absolute reckless abandonment you almost
[54:37] literally have no i'm not saying almost
[54:39] you must lose your mind
[54:42] you absolutely have to lose your mind
[54:45] and i promise you it's scriptural
[54:49] shamgar one day lost
[54:52] his mind absolutely
[54:55] lost his mind and i shared with the kids
[54:57] a while back ago you know what the bride
[54:59] of jesus christ needs
[55:01] she needs 600 philistines marching
[55:04] towards her
[55:05] right now to take everything that she's
[55:07] got
[55:08] because finally she'll put no more
[55:10] confidence in herself
[55:12] one last time and take god at his word
[55:15] as brother branham said
[55:16] here he heard something coming up the
[55:18] road here come a thousand
[55:20] philistines armed spears swords hanging
[55:22] on their sides trained men
[55:23] trump trump right up the road they came
[55:26] and little shamgar stood there
[55:28] what could he do he was a farmer he
[55:30] wasn't a soldier
[55:31] he didn't have nothing to fight with he
[55:33] looked sitting in the corner
[55:35] there was an ox goat that's just an
[55:37] interesting thing he has not a training
[55:39] there's no training he's got nothing to
[55:41] fight with
[55:42] the only thing he has is the only thing
[55:44] that can deliver him
[55:46] faith in the word of god that's it
[55:49] at the end of the day there will be
[55:51] nothing else that can stand
[55:53] it's going to be so simple it's going to
[55:55] be so humble
[55:56] that most of the world will reject it
[55:58] it's too simple
[56:00] you mean just simple humble faith
[56:03] little hyssop taking the blood and
[56:05] applying the blood upon the doorpost of
[56:07] my life
[56:07] this simple faith i don't need to be
[56:09] able to jump through mental hoops with
[56:11] you no
[56:12] just simply taking him at his word he'll
[56:14] do the rest
[56:15] so losing your mind is not a new thing
[56:17] you don't think david lost his mind
[56:19] david lost his mind david
[56:22] why are you you you take on a lion
[56:25] that's no common sense maybe we should
[56:27] actually put a little bit of common
[56:29] sense to this right
[56:30] you know let's be honest this this thing
[56:31] is pretty bad this virus is pretty bad
[56:33] and
[56:33] we need to be balanced in our approach
[56:35] in these things we need to use some
[56:36] common sense
[56:37] show me where common sense is anywhere
[56:38] in the bible there's no common sense in
[56:40] the bible
[56:41] david had no you would say common
[56:44] earthly sense
[56:45] what common sense says i'm going after
[56:47] that lion
[56:48] what common sense says that bear i'm
[56:50] taking you out
[56:51] what common sense of a little boy where
[56:53] an entire army of trained men
[56:55] are too afraid tackles an 11-foot
[56:57] goliath
[56:58] what's where's the common sense in this
[57:00] where's the common sense of shamgar
[57:02] where's the common sense where's the
[57:04] balanced approach nonsense with a
[57:06] balanced approach
[57:07] all that was was human reasoning still
[57:09] mixed with the word of god that was
[57:10] producing death
[57:11] all along and it crippled the little
[57:13] bride
[57:14] but i am thankful that god that we have
[57:16] been forsaken by mother and father
[57:19] and we're leaving those things and
[57:20] taking our god-given position
[57:22] by faith in the word and we're losing
[57:25] our minds and taking
[57:26] on a goliath who are you uncircumcised
[57:29] philistine to defy the armies of the
[57:31] living god
[57:32] who are you you're gonna each and
[57:36] everyone have that opportunity to take
[57:37] your stand
[57:38] so simple and so humble but we're going
[57:41] to get that opportunity
[57:45] brother baum says oh yes he permits
[57:47] crosses and crossroads and junctions
[57:50] he always does that in order to perfect
[57:52] us for his service he permits those
[57:54] things to happen
[57:55] can't you understand that congregation
[57:57] amen he does that so
[58:00] he can perfect you for the calling he's
[58:03] called you for
[58:04] that's your growing pains he did daniel
[58:07] that way you know
[58:08] he did the hebrew children in the fiery
[58:10] furnace
[58:11] what did the fiery furnace do the fiery
[58:14] furnace only broke the bands that had
[58:15] them bound
[58:16] that's all the furnace did just burnt
[58:19] loose the bands
[58:21] sometimes it takes trials to break the
[58:23] bands of the world
[58:24] off of us take you out of the world
[58:27] might be
[58:28] have to take you out of your creed first
[58:31] like the man drowning in the river
[58:33] you have to take him out of the river
[58:34] before you can get the river
[58:36] out of the man so i think the fiery
[58:39] trials and storm are the very thing the
[58:41] bride needs to finally let loose
[58:43] to to really throw off everything
[58:45] because
[58:46] do you know what to do anybody tell me
[58:48] what they should do in the next 30 days
[58:50] tell me how to plan tell me how what
[58:53] what should any of us do to get ready
[58:55] for this
[58:56] and nobody has an answer the entire
[58:59] federal government doesn't have an
[59:00] answer the federal reserve doesn't have
[59:02] an answer the doctors don't have an
[59:03] answer
[59:04] the whole world doesn't have an answer
[59:07] what a blessed place we are in
[59:10] man because i have the answer i know the
[59:14] answer
[59:16] he's my father i know him personally
[59:19] all i have to do now is a complete
[59:22] reckless abandonment and saying god
[59:23] finally i'm not going to put any
[59:25] confidence and planning into this
[59:27] anymore
[59:27] lord you're going to take me just where
[59:28] you want me to go and i'm going to
[59:30] express that great purpose that i was on
[59:32] this earth for him from the beginning
[59:34] so let's not get upset this is the
[59:36] greatest blessing that's ever come
[59:37] towards us
[59:41] show us thy father and it will suffice
[59:44] um
[59:46] okay so now so i wanted to go to this
[59:48] it's a little story and you all know the
[59:49] story so i'll just read a portion of it
[59:52] brother branham talks about he's in the
[59:54] woods there and i began to hear
[59:55] something i looked over to my side and
[59:56] there
[59:57] said a little old pine squirrel i don't
[1:00:00] know whether you have them here or not
[1:00:02] that's the noisiest thing in the woods
[1:00:04] there it was setting up there with a
[1:00:06] little tail throwed up just
[1:00:07] going chatter chatter chatter chatter
[1:00:09] chatter like he was going to tear
[1:00:11] me to pieces i thought did i excite you
[1:00:14] little fella
[1:00:15] i didn't aim to but i said oh you're
[1:00:19] like i did hallelujah hallelujah oh how
[1:00:22] wonderful and he kept chatter chatter
[1:00:24] chatter
[1:00:24] his cotton blue eyes looked down like
[1:00:27] that and i thought
[1:00:28] you're not watching me and all at once i
[1:00:30] noticed a great big old eagle
[1:00:32] that had been forced down in a storm
[1:00:35] under this blow down
[1:00:38] and this story just come back to my mind
[1:00:39] you know because here we are talking
[1:00:41] about eagles
[1:00:42] here we are talking about eagles going
[1:00:43] right into the storm and here we have a
[1:00:45] story of an eagle that got blown down
[1:00:48] maybe he didn't tackle that storm quite
[1:00:50] like he was supposed to
[1:00:52] and sometimes that can happen to you and
[1:00:54] it has certainly happened to me
[1:00:56] we look back in life circumstances i
[1:00:58] look back at
[1:00:59] situations and trials that came my way
[1:01:02] and you know what they blew me down
[1:01:04] they put me hiding behind in a dark
[1:01:07] place you know just i didn't i didn't
[1:01:09] take it right
[1:01:10] i didn't handle it right and it comes to
[1:01:12] each and every one of us
[1:01:14] sometimes the storms of life just
[1:01:15] us spiritually you
[1:01:18] and maybe sometimes you may even feel
[1:01:19] like that's why i even put this in
[1:01:21] it's like i just feel like maybe
[1:01:22] sometimes you may be looking at the
[1:01:24] trials ahead you're looking at the storm
[1:01:25] scum
[1:01:26] you know what you're called to do and
[1:01:28] you remember that last time
[1:01:30] you didn't pass the test you ran
[1:01:34] you went and hid you didn't even tackle
[1:01:36] it
[1:01:37] you gave up and i've been there
[1:01:40] and i think each and every one of us has
[1:01:42] been here and i don't think you can live
[1:01:44] long enough and walk with the lord long
[1:01:45] enough where there's times you can look
[1:01:46] back in your life or you hang your head
[1:01:48] say lord i know i let you down right
[1:01:50] there i have
[1:01:52] but i'm not looking back at that as an
[1:01:55] excuse to not tackle the storm ahead
[1:01:57] i'm looking back at that and it's
[1:01:59] driving me to take on that storm because
[1:02:01] i'm saying it's going to be different
[1:02:02] this time
[1:02:04] there's something on the inside of me
[1:02:05] and it's saying not this time
[1:02:08] you might have got me there you might
[1:02:10] have discouraged me and put me in a
[1:02:11] corner and i really messed up and i
[1:02:13] really
[1:02:14] got down but not not no more you see
[1:02:17] because brother brown begins to say
[1:02:20] uh any let me jump to this one
[1:02:23] so after a while he got tired of looking
[1:02:25] at that little pine squirrel
[1:02:27] listening to him and so he just made one
[1:02:30] big jump and if you remember the little
[1:02:31] pine squirrel saying
[1:02:33] days and miracles over jesus christ
[1:02:36] ain't the same yesterday today and
[1:02:37] forever
[1:02:38] see just a chatter chatter what was he
[1:02:40] trying to do trying to get you to
[1:02:42] disbelieve
[1:02:43] don't take god at his word but you just
[1:02:46] even though that eagle got blowed down
[1:02:48] there was just something
[1:02:49] in that eagle that could only take such
[1:02:52] unbelief for so long
[1:02:54] he finally got sick and tired of all the
[1:02:57] chatter chatter chatter
[1:02:59] we can't take god at his word you're
[1:03:01] getting too extreme
[1:03:02] you're losing your mind you need to stay
[1:03:04] balanced
[1:03:08] the ego just finally had enough of it at
[1:03:10] one point
[1:03:12] so he just made one big jump flopped his
[1:03:14] wings a couple times and he was out of
[1:03:16] the bushes out into the midair
[1:03:18] then i cried and he never flopped
[1:03:21] anymore
[1:03:22] he never tried to flop his wings to get
[1:03:24] away he just set his wings
[1:03:26] and every time that air would come in he
[1:03:28] just
[1:03:29] knowed how to set his wings out into
[1:03:31] that air
[1:03:32] just lift him up i watched him the air
[1:03:35] came
[1:03:35] in and lifted him up lifted him up until
[1:03:38] he went plum out of sight
[1:03:40] leaving that little old pine squirrel
[1:03:42] setting there cursing and going
[1:03:44] on his way i thought that's it lord
[1:03:47] not a jump jump here run run there join
[1:03:50] methods join baptist come back
[1:03:52] be baptized this way this way it's it's
[1:03:54] just setting your wings of faith
[1:03:57] in a humble of the holy ghost comes in
[1:04:00] right rise from it on and on and on plum
[1:04:04] out of sight
[1:04:05] leaving this old earth bound doctrine
[1:04:07] here
[1:04:08] chatter chatter chatter days of miracles
[1:04:10] past chatter chatter chatter
[1:04:12] don't get the holy ghost leave it soar
[1:04:14] away
[1:04:15] go on set your wings right away god
[1:04:18] sends the winds
[1:04:19] to ride up on it so
[1:04:22] let everybody do their arguing their
[1:04:24] fussing they're uh
[1:04:26] you know it's a shame but it's true it's
[1:04:29] what constantly happens a man of
[1:04:30] insecurity has to put down another man
[1:04:32] so he can feel like he's adequate
[1:04:34] and at this point i says god bless you
[1:04:36] all i'm just waiting for the wind to
[1:04:38] come
[1:04:38] i'm setting my wings i'm getting them
[1:04:40] ready i'm tired of all the chatter
[1:04:41] chatter chatter and the day's a miracle
[1:04:43] and you're the
[1:04:43] you can't do that you can't that's okay
[1:04:46] there's just something inside of me it
[1:04:47] says i still got some god-given wings
[1:04:49] here i'm gonna take my flight
[1:04:51] i'm just gonna take my flight i'm just
[1:04:53] i'm done with it
[1:04:54] not chattering chattering back let the
[1:04:57] squirrels do what they must
[1:04:58] they must be there you know what i think
[1:05:00] this growth purpose is
[1:05:02] to annoy the eagles they're just there
[1:05:06] to put that final poke in them
[1:05:08] like i'm tired of this i'm
[1:05:11] out of here not fussing not arguing
[1:05:16] just gone just saying enjoy earthbound
[1:05:20] conditions i'm going higher
[1:05:22] [Applause]
[1:05:23] amen read between the lines
[1:05:27] the difference shalom the difference is
[1:05:30] just like
[1:05:30] it was in the beginning when there was
[1:05:32] gross darkness upon the earth and the
[1:05:34] spirit of god moved upon the face of the
[1:05:36] water and said
[1:05:37] let there be light and god separated the
[1:05:39] light from the darkness
[1:05:41] and i believe that we are now living in
[1:05:43] the hour again
[1:05:44] that when god is separating light from
[1:05:47] darkness
[1:05:48] and he's pressing it to the other side
[1:05:50] of the world
[1:05:51] that the light may be made manifest
[1:05:54] and we are then the church the reason
[1:05:57] i'd say shalom
[1:05:59] to them is because that it's god's peace
[1:06:02] that's what i want to bring to you this
[1:06:04] morning for this new year's
[1:06:06] not looking back but we're looking
[1:06:08] forward to the breaking
[1:06:10] of a new day until there is something
[1:06:12] great
[1:06:13] lying ahead of us where the years has
[1:06:15] been
[1:06:16] the joy that we've looked forward to the
[1:06:18] pressing
[1:06:19] coming of the great light and now we can
[1:06:22] see it breaking
[1:06:23] over the horizon the horizontal rain
[1:06:26] it's breaking between
[1:06:27] mortal and immortality we see it
[1:06:30] breaking between heavens and earth
[1:06:32] from earthbound sickness and troubled
[1:06:35] world into the bright and shining day of
[1:06:37] an immortal life and an immortal body
[1:06:40] and an immortal earth that shall never
[1:06:43] pass away
[1:06:44] its shalom to the church now it's
[1:06:47] light time coming for the believers but
[1:06:50] gross
[1:06:50] darkness for the people
[1:06:54] good morning shalom
[1:06:57] the world is falling apart shalom
[1:07:01] peace they are truly in gross darkness
[1:07:03] and have no
[1:07:04] no hope but shalom
[1:07:07] arise and shine thy light has come
[1:07:12] and so this was the other screensaver
[1:07:14] that i put on my
[1:07:15] computer about three months ago the
[1:07:18] first one was when you open it
[1:07:20] it has to identify you and that's the
[1:07:21] eagle that's taking on the storm but
[1:07:25] that eagle doesn't stay in the storm
[1:07:26] forever
[1:07:28] he just knows that that storm is
[1:07:29] necessary to lift him up
[1:07:31] into the heavenly realms where his
[1:07:32] heavenly father is and that's exactly
[1:07:35] what each and every one of us know
[1:07:37] and don't mean to talk so simple but you
[1:07:39] know it's the truth
[1:07:40] deep down on the inside of you you know
[1:07:42] that that is right
[1:07:44] that it's just the simplicity of taking
[1:07:47] god at his word
[1:07:48] in moments like this where every storm
[1:07:51] is coming your way
[1:07:52] that's actually going to be the very
[1:07:54] thermal dynamics needed for the eagle
[1:07:56] to throw her up into the heavenly realms
[1:07:58] from which she came
[1:08:00] and that's where we're going as mark 16
[1:08:03] said
[1:08:03] and he said unto them go into all the
[1:08:05] world preach the gospel
[1:08:07] to every creature in good times and in
[1:08:10] bad
[1:08:11] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:08:12] be saved he that believeth not shall be
[1:08:14] damned
[1:08:15] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:08:17] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:08:19] devils
[1:08:20] they'll speak with new tongues they
[1:08:22] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[1:08:24] any deadly thing
[1:08:25] it will not harm them they shall lay
[1:08:27] hands on the sick
[1:08:28] and they shall recover this is my
[1:08:30] promise
[1:08:32] as the story goes brother bam said about
[1:08:34] the woman if god could heal me with that
[1:08:35] which
[1:08:36] is uninspired what will he do with that
[1:08:38] which really is inspired
[1:08:40] so you see don't back down
[1:08:43] keep going you have a hope that lies
[1:08:45] within you
[1:08:46] little did you know what god's placed on
[1:08:48] the inside
[1:08:49] now is just the time and the opportunity
[1:08:51] for the full expression
[1:08:53] of those little secrets that god had in
[1:08:55] the back part of his mind
[1:08:56] now being expressed in the time in which
[1:08:58] you're living yeah
[1:09:00] each and every one of us musicians if
[1:09:01] you'll come
[1:09:03] i told you i wouldn't i don't think i
[1:09:06] told you i wouldn't be long
[1:09:07] i told you i was going to talk to you
[1:09:13] i want to close with this
[1:09:16] the cloudy skies and the storms of life
[1:09:18] are no signs of god's disapproval
[1:09:21] so it could get dark but don't think of
[1:09:23] it god's disapproving of things
[1:09:26] neither are bright skies and still water
[1:09:29] signs of his love and approval
[1:09:31] his approval of any of us is only in the
[1:09:34] beloved
[1:09:35] his love is elective which we he had for
[1:09:38] us before the foundation of the world
[1:09:40] does he love us ah yes but how shall we
[1:09:44] know
[1:09:44] how shall we know because he said so and
[1:09:48] manifested that he did love us for he
[1:09:50] brought
[1:09:51] us to himself and gave us his spirit
[1:09:55] placing us as sons and how shall i prove
[1:09:59] my love to him
[1:10:00] by believing what he said my
[1:10:03] that little eagle might have got
[1:10:04] discouraged blown down by a big storm
[1:10:06] but there was still something inside him
[1:10:08] that believed what god
[1:10:10] said you got something inside of you
[1:10:12] still says
[1:10:13] i just believe what god said
[1:10:16] so what do we do believe what he said
[1:10:19] and by conducting
[1:10:20] myself with joy in the midst of the
[1:10:23] trials
[1:10:24] that he and his wisdom allow us to come
[1:10:26] to pass
[1:10:28] so smile and sing the next time you're
[1:10:31] going through walmart
[1:10:32] it's going to please your lord be happy
[1:10:35] lose your job
[1:10:36] smile no more money smile

[1:16:18] is
[1:16:22] [Music]
[1:16:23] praise the lord i'm
[1:16:26] i was greatly edified by the word
[1:16:28] tonight
[1:16:30] and greatly encouraged more than
[1:16:32] anything
[1:16:33] friends we need to never forget the abcs
[1:16:38] we need to never forget the application
[1:16:40] of the word in our lives
[1:16:42] that it's got to live that everything
[1:16:43] we've been taught has to live
[1:16:46] and you know i was thinking there at the
[1:16:48] end when brother kai was talking
[1:16:50] brother ben talked about that great
[1:16:52] sculpture he's been working on in the
[1:16:54] masterpiece you know
[1:16:55] we know he started with the male part of
[1:16:57] the masterpiece but the masterpiece is a
[1:16:58] masterpiece family
[1:17:00] husband and wife together and he's been
[1:17:03] through seven church ages working on the
[1:17:05] female part of that masterpiece
[1:17:07] and in the studio time alone with the
[1:17:10] master's hand
[1:17:11] has been so beautiful he's just talking
[1:17:13] to you and telling you
[1:17:15] i'm taking this away and i'm fashioning
[1:17:17] you this way
[1:17:18] and we've had all this time in the
[1:17:20] studio
[1:17:22] but brother branham says before that
[1:17:24] piece of work can go to the hall of fame
[1:17:27] first it has to pass through the hall of
[1:17:29] critics
[1:17:31] and if it was up to us we would stay in
[1:17:33] the studio forever
[1:17:35] but god's going to eventually take his
[1:17:37] masterpiece and put it on display
[1:17:40] and it'll pass the test of every critic
[1:17:43] and he'll move it into the hall of fame
[1:17:46] you know that's the part we've been
[1:17:48] trying to avoid
[1:17:50] do you believe that that's the part
[1:17:53] we've been trying to avoid we've enjoyed
[1:17:55] the studio with just us and him we're
[1:17:58] going to enjoy
[1:17:59] the you know the hall of fame restored
[1:18:02] to an eden condition
[1:18:04] but to get from there to there we must
[1:18:06] be on display
[1:18:07] and pass through the hall of critics and
[1:18:10] we would have avoided it we would have
[1:18:11] never
[1:18:12] chosen it amen we would have just stayed
[1:18:14] where we were but god is moving the
[1:18:16] circumstances because this is going to
[1:18:18] be again the unveiling of christ
[1:18:20] in bride form and it's going to pass
[1:18:23] through the holy critics but don't be
[1:18:25] discouraged
[1:18:26] it's going to the hall of fame
[1:18:29] god is working circumstances that we
[1:18:31] would have never worked
[1:18:33] god is doing things that we would have
[1:18:35] never voluntarily done
[1:18:38] we were too comfortable but thank god he
[1:18:42] loves
[1:18:42] us and he will do everything he said
[1:18:44] he's going to do
[1:18:45] and he will bring to pass everything he
[1:18:47] said he's going to bring to pass
[1:18:49] because his word won't fail so i thank
[1:18:52] god
[1:18:52] i thank him for what he's doing
[1:18:56] jesus for the glory that lay ahead
[1:18:59] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:19:03] jesus come to a place where he had to go
[1:19:06] through the cross
[1:19:08] through the hall of critics to be
[1:19:10] crucified
[1:19:11] and in order to do that he had to set
[1:19:14] his eyes
[1:19:15] higher beyond the temporary
[1:19:19] into the eternal and for the glory that
[1:19:21] lay ahead he endured the cross despising
[1:19:23] the shame
[1:19:24] remember this wasn't something he was
[1:19:26] looking forward to he prayed three times
[1:19:28] that this cup could pass
[1:19:29] him as a human as a man there's a dread
[1:19:32] there was an agony there was an angst in
[1:19:34] his heart
[1:19:35] coming into this time amen but he
[1:19:37] surrendered his will to the will of the
[1:19:39] father and moved forward
[1:19:40] before the glory that lay ahead i tell
[1:19:43] you maybe it's
[1:19:44] time for us to quit thinking about the
[1:19:46] earth
[1:19:47] the carnal things and let's start
[1:19:49] setting our eyes
[1:19:51] on what's coming next and walk forward
[1:19:54] with our vision
[1:19:55] set forward not on the temporal but on
[1:19:58] the eternal
[1:20:00] oh i was encouraged tonight
[1:20:04] if we find ourselves with a little more
[1:20:05] time off
[1:20:07] let's have some more fellowship
[1:20:11] let's not waste what's what's what's
[1:20:12] coming our way if god is stripping away
[1:20:15] some things and we find ourselves
[1:20:16] working from home or not working or
[1:20:19] whatever happens you know that
[1:20:20] the kids are already not in school
[1:20:24] and so if we find ourselves with more
[1:20:25] time let's have more fellowship
[1:20:27] let's spend more time in the word let's
[1:20:29] do the things we know
[1:20:30] are going to really count in this hour
[1:20:32] that we're alive let's not
[1:20:34] waste it and squander it on things that
[1:20:36] matter for nothing
[1:20:38] but let's start taking our time and
[1:20:39] putting it the things that matter the
[1:20:41] most
[1:20:43] amen god bless you guys
