========================================

But what went you out for to see a prophet? Yay, I say unto you, and more than a prophet, for this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare the way before me, Malachi 3. &gt;&gt; So, who does Jesus say that John the Baptist is? Jesus says he's Malachi 3. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist says he's Isaiah 4, Isaiah 40. Amen. Uh, Matthew says he's Isaiah 40. Luke says he's Isaiah 40. Mark says he's Malachi 3 and Isaiah 40. But you'll never find any scripture, amen, that tells you that John the Baptist is a restorer of anything. He's a preparer. Because if he came at the end of the Jewish dispensation to restore, he would take him back to the law of Moses. But he wasn't there to restore. He was there to prepare because there's coming a new and living way. Grace was being open. The New Testament was coming. Christ was coming as a sacrifice for all sin. He wasn't restoring. He was preparing. &gt;&gt; There was a new entrance, a new gate opening, something, a new way coming. &gt;&gt; Don't you love review? &gt;&gt; It becomes more real all the time. Friends, this word never fails. And what God sent us was a word prophet. And that word prophet stays exactly with the word. And he knows the word. He's got a seventh grade education. He told you one time, I hope you understand what I'm saying. I don't have language enough to explain it. &gt;&gt; He didn't have the credentials. He didn't have the language, but what he had was the mind of God. And what he had was a gift. Amen. To pick up on the true interpretation of the word. And he would stay exactly with that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 1, this is when the angel comes to Zachchariah before John the Baptist is born. And the angel comes to Zachchariah and says, "And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias," that's Elijah, "to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children." &gt;&gt; See the comma? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's as far as he went in the Malachi 4 prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pause. for 2,000 &gt;&gt; years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He did prepare. He did turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, the Jewish fathers to the children of the New Testament, but he went no farther in the prophecy. And the angel who spoke to to to uh Zachcharias, John's father, he was exactly with the word and he stopped at the right place to stop. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prepared for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Even this angel knew what John the Baptist portion was. It was preparation prepared for the Lord, not restoration. He was preparing. He was only there to fulfill the first half. And because he only fulfilled the first half when they said, "Are you Elijah?" He said, "No." "Are you that prophet?" "No." "Who are you?" I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Prepare ye the way of the Lord. He knew his part of the prophecy. The angel knew his part of the prophecy. Amen. And he stayed true to that part of the prophecy. But after the comma, there's another part yet to be fulfilled. And I say it's been fulfilled. It's been fulfilled in this generation. There come a man with the spirit of Elijah named William Brandham. And he fulfilled the rest of that prophecy. &gt;&gt; And God vindicated and confirmed it. And it's without question that those who have eyes to see and ears to hear &gt;&gt; and a heart to perceive.
