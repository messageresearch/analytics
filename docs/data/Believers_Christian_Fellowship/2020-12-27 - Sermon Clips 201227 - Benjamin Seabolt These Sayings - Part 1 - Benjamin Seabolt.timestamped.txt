[0:01] brother branham said the secret of the
[0:03] message
[0:04] was to be about the father's business
[0:06] and the father's business
[0:09] was to fulfill the word of god
[0:12] and then he gives us our instructions
[0:15] of what we must do to be about the
[0:18] father's business
[0:20] and he says our instructions are to
[0:23] vindicate malachi 4.
[0:27] to vindicate luke 17 30.
[0:30] to vindicate hebrews 13 8 saint john 14
[0:33] 12
[0:34] all of his word revelation 10 7 the
[0:37] opening the seals and the mysteries of
[0:38] god
[0:39] i'm going to make it real plain for you
[0:40] saints we know there's an attack on this
[0:43] message we know there's an attack on the
[0:45] prophet there's an attack on the cloud
[0:46] there's a tackle on this vision there's
[0:48] a tackle on that vision there's attack
[0:49] on this situation
[0:52] we are not to try to re-fulfill those
[0:56] things we are to
[0:58] vindicate and to clear
[1:01] and remove all suspicion or false blame
[1:06] and to show and to prove that which has
[1:09] been said
[1:10] to be right reasonable and justified
[1:16] and here's the thing we're to do that
[1:19] without ever
[1:20] uttering a word
[1:24] because if you utter a word they can
[1:26] utter more words
[1:28] if you argue they can argue back if you
[1:31] get
[1:31] facts and figures and clippings and
[1:33] whatever else
[1:35] they can get more
[1:38] what they can't argue with is the
[1:41] vindication
[1:43] of a lived life
[1:46] because deep down in their heart
[1:49] they will know i can argue all that i
[1:52] want to
[1:54] but you know what they'll never say this
[1:57] they're incapable of saying this because
[1:59] if they say this they declare that you
[2:01] and the father are one
[2:02] and if they say that then they are to
[2:04] automatically declare what their father
[2:05] is
[2:06] but what they will never tell you is you
[2:08] know what that person's got something i
[2:10] don't have
[2:13] and it lines up with what that man said
[2:15] that they call as a prophet
[2:18] and when you vindicate that
[2:21] you remove all suspicion and blame from
[2:25] that ministry
[2:26] that god sent us
