two wednesdays it is the rising of the sun but let's just begin with a word of prayer before we take our seats it's all about our heads lord jesus we thank you father for the privilege that we have of being here once again nor we thank you lord that you put it in our hearts to sing praises to your name it's such a joy for us to lift your name on high and sing about your wonder and your grace and your amazing love and lord as we listen to the last portion of this tape i pray you'd quicken it to us lord that had become a living word alive within us lord while we would see what it is you're trying to tell us in this hour what it is you want to whisper the love secret you're trying to whisper to your bride may we receive it lord tonight from you may you open our hearts lord to receive all that you have for us bless us now we pray as we listen to this and lord may we leave here lord and more prepared to serve you more equipped lord for the journey and we leave here strengthened by this manna know that we might be pleasing to you in all we do in jesus christ's name we pray amen i mean we're going to let you have your seats and we'll we'll go through some of our scripture reading thank you musicians amen let's go ahead and go through some of our scripture reading the scripture reading that brother brenham had at the beginning of this so we don't lose track of what he opened with and our first scripture will be revelations chapter 1 verse 17. so when the prophet of god started this service he he read three scriptural passage passages of scripture so we'll read through those and then in the second part we started with another one the fourth one we'll read that as well revelation chapter 1 verse 17. revelation 1 and 17 says and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death let's turn to romans chapter 8 this is the second portion of scripture that brother branham opened this service with romans chapter 8 verse 11. in romans 8 verse 11 he says but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now we'll turn to mark 16 this is the third passage of scripture that he opened with mark chapter 16 verses 1 and 2. verse 1 and when the sabbath was passed mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and solomy had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came into the sepulchre at the rising of the sun amen part way into the service brother branham goes to another scripture that's leviticus 23 i'd like to read that together leviticus chapter 23 and verse 9. leviticus 23 and 9 and he read from 9 down to 11 so we'll read those three verses and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you become into the land which i give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheep before the lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it and he and ye shall offer that day when you wave the sheaf and wave the sheaf a he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the lord sorry i went a little further than i intended it was supposed to be 9 10 11. um so now let's take our book and i want to do just a little review before we get into the questions i'm just going to read pull a few snippets out from the beginning let's go all the way back to paragraph 23. paragraph 23 is on uh page four top portion of page four i always want to go and hit a few highlights so that we don't lose track of what we've journeyed through so far so in paragraph 23 he says now my text this morning i want to take for a text it is the rising of the sun and for a subject i want to use the quickening power so his text was the rising of the sun and he took that out of mark 16 and his subject was the quickening power let's look over the next page at paragraph 29 and 30 on page five as people today are trying to say we should wash feet once a year on thursday and on friday we should take the communion and all different doctrines they argue about whether it should be this day or that day or whether it should be a sabbath day or the first day of the week or all these things are just merely tradition tradition what good would any of it do you whether you had land or not lent if there is no life in you it's only a memorial which there's nothing against it but they have certainly carried out their tradition but left off the main thing satan doesn't care how religious you are how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again amen let's turn over to paragraph 41 at the top of page seven very 41 it says but this time when the sun rose there was a dual sun rising another sun rising it was not only the sun rising it was the eson had risen to bring eternal life to all god's promised seed that by foreknowledge he had seen laying upon the earth and let's go to next page of paragraph 49 on page 8. he says i'm sure this morning that even we who believe it cannot comprehend what a great thing that was because he raised from the dead we also have already raised from the dead for we were in him man let's go to paragraph 54 at the top of page 9 verse 54 now and then not only that he sent word to his disciples his believing fear not for i am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore and i have the keys to death and hell i've already conquered it don't fear anymore for every foreordained predestinated seed of god shall come to life when that light spreads across the earth of the glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth a crop that god ordained it to he had raised from the dead it's a guarantee friends amen let's go to paragraph 79 over on page 12. paragraph 79 we are the benefactors of his resurrection quickened after being dead in the world in sin and trespasses he has quickened us together with him raised with him now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus his his spirit brings his same life again on the earth listen his spirit brings the same life his same life again on the earth if the spirit of god that raised up christ the body the anointed body if the spirit of god anointed that body in such a way that when that seed fell in the earth he just wouldn't let him rest there no he quickened him and raised him up that same spirit by the same works by the same power by the same signs being you it'll also raise you up amen let's look at paragraph 89 over on page 13. paragraph 89 we're going to read several paragraphs all the way into the next page with this that's why they had to waive the sheaf where it was the first one that come to maturity and it was waived as a memorial of thanksgiving to god believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign and today because he was the first son of god to come to full maturity to be in god he was plucked up from the earth and has waved over the people oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although he had he had been typed in many times as we'll see later that he was tight but this was really the first fruits of them that slept he was waved over the promised seed that had promises the promise of life he was waved at the day of pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the pentecostal people that was up at pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and to be waived again we realize in the last day according to luke 17 30 and the sunday again and the day that the s-o-n of man will be revealed or waved again over the people now who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if all the teaching that we have had and the confirmation of the word of god by word of god by signs by wonders we see today that in the book of luke here that that as we just quoted or the luke the 17th chapter in the 30th verse and malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us and is giving us life as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept and the bride coming of christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheaf what was the sheaf the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheaf hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because i live ye live also speaking to his wife because i live ye live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of pentecost the word made manifest now and as i say it's to be waved again in the last day praise god it's been waved friends the word made manifest has been waived let's go to paragraph 154 and that'll be found over on page 21. paragraph 154 at the bottom of page 21. but brother when you hear the scream there's something in you you're an eagle to begin with why you are that seed that that the resurrection of the s-o-n has drawn and the wave sheep upon the earth to make you recognize that you are an eagle and not a denominational chicken now we talk about the wave sheath right and we understand that god took the first one to prove that it was a mature seed amen and he waved it over the people the son of man ministry the word made manifest has been waived in this day but now he comes and he says that the resurrection of the s.o.n has dawned and the wave chief upon the earth to make you recognize that you are an eagle why was the wave sheep waved upon the earth so that you would recognize you're an eagle and not a denominational chicken so that you would see something different so you would see the word made manifest you would see the reality of a living word the scriptures made alive and you would know i'm not this but i'm that that wave sheath was waved so that you would recognize and the wave sheep upon the earth to make you recognize that you are an eagle and not a denominational chicken you see it ha if the spirit that raised him from the dead the word the dynamic of the word dwells in you it also quickens your mortal body now how we now how we flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone because quickly while you were yet mortal sinners morty mortal ready to die these bodies it quickened that body what's quicken brings to life the spirit that once liked to drink to run around to commit adultery and all these things it quickened why the thing died and you are resurrected it quickens your mortal body therefore your bodies is the temple of the dynamics because why from the beginning you are part of the mechanics oh there is your resurrection there is the church in the resurrection with him these bodies right now are quickened so you've heard you believed it changed you from a denomination to the word praise god this is the resurrection amen you're part of that resurrection you're in this resurrection you've experienced this resurrection it's going on now amen paragraph 191 this is the last one we'll read and then we'll get into our questions paragraph 191 on page 25. now when you get the dynamics you have been quickened from mortal to immortality it makes the whole body come subject to the word it'll make you act different look different live different it'll just make you different now look ben quickened you who were once dead in sin and trespasses and darkness has he quickened what by his spirit that raised up jesus on easter morning from the dead and if it dwells in your mortal bodies now watch it also quickens brings the life makes it subject to the word now how can you claim to have that spirit and throw yourself away from the word you're quickened by something else for it will quicken your mortal bodies to the word sure it will amen praise the lord all right can we pull up this powerpoint we'll go ahead and go to our questions we are going to begin on page 30 at paragraph 230. so we're going to start at page 30 on paragraph 230 that's towards the top of the page and we're going to go all the way to the end of the message all the way through his prayer at the end so let's look at our questions here and you can write these down if you wish to first question what three steps must you take to walk the highway to heaven's doors now sometimes these questions i write they may sound a little funny in their grammar the way they're written but i wrote it that way for a reason because there's a certain way something is spoken by the prophet so we want to catch that what three steps must you take to walk the highway to heaven's doors like i said before there's no trick questions these all come in chronological order i mean it just helps us stay focused and glean nuggets out of the message question one again what three steps must you take to walk the highway highway to heaven's doors praise god this is when it was good to take shorthand in college question number two what is the abstract to the title deed what is the abstract to the title deed so that was question number two what is the abstract to the title deed and question number three what is the opening of the seals what is the opening of the seals question number three so many good nuggets here question three what is the opening of the seals and question number four what does the breaking of the easter seal from around our lives reveal question number four what does the breaking of the easter seal from around our lives reveal these are so exciting i want to just blurt it out but we'll wait once again question number four what does the breaking of the easter seal from around our lives reveal all right let's go ahead and go to the tape we're going to begin like i said on page 30. so if you want to turn to page 30 we'll begin a paragraph 230. so brother franco if you want to go ahead and start the tape now load it quick them into the presence of god why it was the spirit of god that raised up jesus from the grave and the spirit of god are given that eternal life comes from the greek word if you look up zoe which moves it through you and then quickens their even their mind how can you say that that spirit dwells in you though you've done everything that you thought was right here's your evidence when you got it now if the spirit that was in crisis in you it also quickened you to the word for he is the word and if he contrary quickens you away from the word then it isn't the spirit of christ care what you've done until that moves you in the word my sheep hear my voice and they shall live by every word every word i was talking about the other day my own mother she's going on now and she was a very odd woman and she was you know about half indian and she was up but in there she was a person who didn't dream but all i think she had four or five dreams all of her life but every time she dreams a dream it was true she had a dream it was true i remember one time i first started preaching many years ago was living right up here on the road right just above here i was preaching right at this church she dreamed the dream that i was standing here by the side of a three step and i was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the highway and on the highways a little pearly like white line runs right into the the doors of heaven to the pearly gate and that pearl has been stretched out to the top of these steps if that ain't my message exactly today justification sanctification sanctifications and i was saying that a person has to come by these three steps to be able to walk that highway and said that there was a lady came by now you know what kind of shoes people wore 35 years ago but there's a lady come by i have a great big pair of the actually where today spike your shoes and she come by and i said wait a minute sister you can't walk that highway there and i think you can't beat it and she said um i'll show you i can be justified sanctified and deal with the holy ghost still wants it and she i just let her go couldn't do no more about it couldn't stop her and she jumped up on the highway to look back your sister said yeah i told you she started to run up and she you know what the bible said in isaiah fifth chapter that you have outstretched neck they have to pitch over see missing as hefty accurate as we go making a tinkling with her heels her daughter's design in the last thing and she started up that highway just as hard as she could run and as while the road got narrower in there she started really missing like that and off she went mother said the harvest screams that i've heard in my life with that woman falling into those flames and smoke going down down like that i turn around said see she just obeyed everything but one word see everything but one word sure pentecostal women can be saved sanctified and deal with the holy ghost and then faith absolutely mention lightly by bread alone but by every word see and she failed it and as i said see she went on in all right but she she failed to listen tell her what was ahead and he's wrote the gospel by the disciples apostles and doctrines of the apostles and prophets and so forth and they won't listen followers this creating power is zoey bringing the word the mind that was in christ within you then i'm trying to show you that you when you uh raised when god raised jesus from the dead he raised up you also and also quicken to life with him you are now quick and lie although banned you were but an attribute in his thoughts but god has saw all in him at the finish see when god looked down upon the body the spirit left him in the garden against him and he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was god god anointed that flesh which is human flesh and he didn't if he went after his god he never died that kind of death thank kill god but he didn't have to do it but remember he went there with you in him see god had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both neglect females it was all redeeming that one body see they are one same same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks to the bride well how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything even to prove it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards then don't the group the bride have to do the same thing has to be exactly what the word said should be in these last things don't you have to return to your mouth before don't you have to be manifested like wasn't the days of sodom don't the world have to be just exactly like it is isn't these things a perfect identification of the word of god made known to us well friends i know i'm keeping you a long time 15 minutes yet so dinner but maybe i'll get through but then but notice looking here what a perfect thing it is i don't want to see it against me look notice this but god foresaw the bride in the groom hallelujah see to save his wife like adam he had to go with her i had him know what he was doing he didn't know what she was doing but adam walked out with his wife see and jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her remember he became you he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what a love what a fellowship how can we deny how can we do anything but love him friend uh she could stay on ours but let's move on for it right uh the pentecostal experience today and the coming of the holy ghost in this last days as promised is like the abstract to a title deed see now you can get a title sure okay you can get a title to your place but that's still going to say it's yours no sir somebody way back energy come in and put a claim on it but when you get an abstract that shows that everything is ever against it is struck off coming back from the foundation is that right and when a man has said that he believes the word and then when the holy spirit comes it is the abstract to the title and that gives you permission when you have that abstract and every bit of that belongs to you and everything's on it belongs to you hey and that gives us the abstract when the holy ghost comes upon this pile of eve that god saw back on her for the foundation of the world and put a name on the book of life but was born through a man and woman and subject to sin and guilty of sin but when i believed on it i received the deed but when the holy ghost comes it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it my father done it my grandmother earned it like a little epileptic child prayed for a few minutes ago to come to you from the grandparents therefore if she fell down and upon the child i said but when the abstract has come it struck off omitted everything i'm uh abstract foreign amen and it sure is the spirit that raised christ from the dead i have an abstract need that i'm part of that body with the abstract of the holy ghost making that body of word lit up just exactly like it did in him let's be prominent right there the abstract call my sins are struck out all your sins are struck by the blood of jesus christ and the holy ghost has come as an abstract to the title deed that god give me by grace by foreign amen oh my what scared us no wonder he said fear not anything he that was dead and alive again and i'm alive forevermore had the keys of death and hell don't worry about nothing even if he would hurt you beautiful let's go right quick now the abstract title the death is settled everything against it has been struck off glory i may act silly but i feel good oh an abstract deed do you realize what that means you realize what that means brother there's nothing you can take it away from me amen i am a holder hey man what a why why i have now cashed in on my beneficiary of his death burial and resurrection he become me that i might become him now he became a sinner that i might become a son amen holy abstract deeds for these signs shall follow them that believe the abstract deeds now quickly before it got 15 minutes forward let us now notice quickly the quickening of the spirit i'm going to show you some signs so you'll understand look now watch what this quickening power was my subject as the sun has raised up look how done on them at pentecost what it did to them what that quickening power did to them it's quicker than now let's notice what it did on stephen stephens is full of quickening power wasn't that right see he was full of quickening power it didn't make him scared he said you stiffness uncircumcised the heart and ears you always resist the holy ghost like your father's destroy you which one of the prophets has chosen for the coming of the just one in your father's stone oh my done something to him sure he is full of questioning power and they said we'll get rid of that guy and when he died just stone him in the torah i see the heavens open christian power was working i see the heavens open and jesus standing at the right hand of god that's what quickly power done for stephen notice another fellow had just quickly power his name is philip he was so full of quickly power just have a great big meeting down in samara devils is being cast out people's baptized the name of jesus christ that's had a real meeting and the spirit spoke to him oh the the dynamics come down and it said leave this revival but while the minister said don't make any difference he's full of quickly power he had the gasoline and the dynamic was falling upon him they go out into the desert and he found a eunuch there and baptized him in the name of jesus christ one man who took the message down to ethiopia is that right and he obeyed god and old penis to god if you've never been baptized in the name of jesus christ do it and watch your britney power pick your faith when stephen's done this great thing or not speaking of the done this great thing to leave that great revival and obey the commandments of god on his fulfillment about baptizing this eunuch in obedience to god he was so full of cleansing power to call him away if this spirit that raised up jesus from the dead it quick and fill up so he wasn't seen for maybe 150 miles or somewhere else or another country it's quick in this mortal body how did it go full of equipment oh church of the living god we take that around your own little sugar tits that we're nursing around here today we've got to be full and played up with quickly power until the quickening of the holy ghost we got to be caught away someday in that rapture amen oh my excuse that expression i think about a mother that makes those little factories too for the baby some of you old man is remember the little baby gets a squirrel and take some coffee grounds and some sugar wraps up in the sack let him suck on it just a pacifier there's no strength in that but kitty a little caffeine in there and stuff a little sweetness to make it far down it's getting caffeine we're tired of that stuff is that get back your egos back to the word of god be barely nothing can hurt your feelings you're free from all the scandal of man whatever anybody says against you that just brings more quickening power caught away into the heavenlies the eagle is done through above the chicken way up there in the heavenly places in christ jesus oh it was owned philip that quickening caught him away let's take another man there was a man by the name of enoch and he had walked with every word of god for about 500 years he had a testimony that our heaven one time failed his word he got so full of the quickening power when the dynamics hit him on that mechanic he didn't even have to die he just took it apart just started walking himself like philip he got support quick and power instead of going over to the gates and going to another place where they found him up in the upper coast is there instead of that way he was like well i said i'm an old man anyhow i just got so much quicker walk out here that's the same quickly power that we have right now i think it will quicken your mortal body isn't that right it's the quickening powers edict was that perfect testimony that everything god told me to do i did it everything that i've seen he said for me to do i've done it and become so full of dynamics or or mechanics until when the quickening power stuck in the mechanics it affected him right up he walked on out of the earth into heaven now now i notice on elijah after he looks elijah that great prophet man and his excuses brother and sister in that day he had busted them painted face women then jesse bell and they had and stood until and nobody looked like stood with me and he rebuked and desired and stood out there and god is taking care of me and helped him in every place you know the old fella got tired one day he said you know so i just can't go as far as it's going i guess it's 90 years old real lord walked around there and he was so full of quick and tired you know what he looked across yards oh god i can almost see the other side against you for the quickening power until he seen a chair hooked over there some horses the fire chair the fire hooked to some tree over there he just walked across the river and went home without even dying the quickness power set calls the chairs to come down from heaven and take him up being put off his coat and throw it back for elijah that's right now then that thought picked up that robe the type of the church picked up that role now he's done twice a miracle which is a type of christ in the church elijah done four he done eight see now he was he was double the power because he asked for it greater things than this that i do sure you do see but he was so full of quickening power and everything so he done all these double what elijah done more than he did and noticed he lived a life on up to about 80 or 90 years old he got old and he he died he died they took him out and buried no that quickly bar didn't leave me many many years after that when the flesh had all rotted off his bone he was laying in a tube and they were packing the dead man one day and they saw the enemy and they just throw this man on top of elijah's motion so much quicken power on those folks to a man rested over that dirt hallelujah amen he that raised up christ with the hands lord all so quick in your immortal body the elijah back there elisha and elijah remember that dead man that prophet full of that quickening power laying in the grave and rotted away just so much quickly powerful sort of dead man holy come to life you can still lay hands on this there you are and remember we are flesh of his flesh jesus christ we are flesh of his flesh and bones of his bones oh there's no way out of it we're going to rhyme amen that's all he's going to rise that's all easter means more than just a tradition it is also now our bodies are quickened with him and we're sitting in heavenly places and this body may rot in the sea it may rot in the ground it may not be a spoonful of ashes but it's just coming forth for the spirit that raised up my lord from the dead has quickened this mortal body squeaking your mortal body and we are his beneficiaries of his resurrection his policy of eternal life that i've talked too much about no wonder he said fear not you know for paul said therefore is your state brave where is your victory i'm full of quickening power thanks be to god who gives us a victory in your lord jesus christ yes sir quick encounter oh my he is alive forevermore the same yesterday the day and forever hebrews 13 8 notice messiah the anointed one so is his bride the messiah the anointed one notice death does not stop god's quickening power they have to stop it when you've got it it's eternal david ain't nothing going to stop it you can't harness it you can't take yourself into it if you live your life out there still stop it's as good as it was notice moses is full of that quickening power fuzzy is the prophet who the word came to he was part of the word he was the word of that day is that right and after he was dead 800 years mount transfiguration there is still but they're alive that right they're quickly powered death don't never take it away no no i'll raise it up again the angels come bearing down in the valley he had been rotten and gone his bones was gone and everything else but the quickening power was still there they quickened him and brought him up and there he was standing so she says that right brother branham after 800 years old month if you'd read matthew i got a scripture matthew 27 51 you just write part down when all goes back there that believed that he would come the bible said here after he come they were sleeping in the ground quickly powers up on and they were part of him than satan they were part of him because they believed on him potentially they had that life through the sacrifice of a sheep of propitiation which could never bring spirit of sheep back up on the man how about now is the spirit of the man got himself up on this earth how much more quickly power do we have but through the perpetuation our sin was offered a land and type what we have is not the type that's the anatype what are we scared about and those fellows who only had a tight party to his resurrection and went down into the grave with it a job back there under his great stream ah everything took away from him the devil said let me have him i'll make him curse you to your face and then he broke three supposed to take his life and he did he all but take his life and his wife even turned against better breath had become strange to him in other words you should have nothing to do with him she doesn't seem to love him anymore just pushed him away job you're miserable watching his curse god died said you talk like a foolish one he held right to what he had now he's a prophet he said i am not a sinner i have offered the provided sacrifice amen he knew where he was standing he was on the word no matter what the other said is right there at the word then that great tremendous hour says you speak like a food you said the lord gave the lord taken away while blessed be the name of the lord said i'll come in this world without anything i'll come here naked i'll go out the same way blessed be the name of the lord that night broke out and falls as kids dead his poverty stricken us friends all turned against these church members everything else scraping himself with a what a miserable wretch nobody's ever make that yeah he was an eagle um you can't keep the film over his eyes all the time all it was standing on that word what happened the sky sealed back the thunders began to roar the lightning began to flash and job looked up and saw the vision said i know my redeemer and the last days he'll stand up on this earth and go away from the skin worms has destroyed this body bones and all that quickness will be there i'll seek god for myself whom i shall see for myself my eyes shall behold and not another is that right go after my reigns be consumed within me go after the skin worms that's in my body now will destroy you know skin worms don't come to you that worm's already in you your own skin once you ever lose that punch in the coffin and put it air tight the bugs are each up just the same because they're in you you are just a bunch of bugs to begin with on the inside though the skin worm my skin worms destroys me my flesh get in my flesh house to god and on that resurrection morning all right hallelujah matthew this great writer 27 51 said after he is resurrected from the dead that's the old testament many of those just left in the dusty earth come up out here and entered into the city and appeared to me that quickening tower still on the bones of elijah when there was no more bones still on job when he was on the spoon for the dust left of his body but the quickly power was still there if this spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwelling he'll also quicken your mortal body don't just quickly now say well we're starting back you live in a better time now if you all i see your putting on some scriptures or i put down first thessalonians 4 16 notice how beautiful see in the saints then that sleep in christ will god bring with me see faith in the grave resting like elijah was some like elisha was see some of them be christians some will be taken some will be in the grace they will go with it the trumpet of god shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise first and we which arrive and remaining shall be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air the quickly power on the living the quicken power on the dead see that same quickness power of god presented in both of these prophets look at their names are almost the same elisha elijah see the pride in the group one of them is mr jesus jesus almost the same between them he and she elijah and look cots represent here now elisha was taken up in the rapture represents the church or elijah and elisha rested until the resurrection see it's just like a bird needs two wings to balance itself the church is represented right there in those two prophets where we which alive and remain to the coming lord shall not hinder them which our sins for the trumpet of god shall sound both wings shall come together and we will fly away fly away because what in the living are dead that quitting power still is noticeable remember remember now quicken to see what these things are what's the quickness power of this day remember we are quickened not long ago for help as i i think our lord said is so depaul what the father shows me i felt nothing back i'll tell you and in these last days when we see this quickening power upon us he even gives quickening power to us to see the stick here we have seen the quickness power working among us like it was then upon them in the early days sit bring back asian raise the dead see it makes the stick well the other day i found someone a little donovan works yeah i guess you all know it i was up front hunting with these poor little fella's a nice little guy who comes here at churchill it's a very good friend of mine and he just thinks i didn't want to buy it i looked his ear turned all inside out and i said hi donovan you're talking about a hand like a cancer that's a diamond what's american ear he said don't know brother my six seven months and just keep getting i said why you say something bad i didn't want to bother you brother man i said do you know what it is but i have an idea i just put my hand over and never said a word two days after there wasn't even a scar what is it that quitting power see it will quicken your immortal body his hair would heat off his brains would have been gone see if he died but the quickening power see that one day when i was wearing myself about i said you boy you better go ahead you're 50 years old you if you go dreams even larger hurry up and do it you're getting old there that morning the quickening power comes and let me look over the curtain i've seen all of you over there he said all that she ever loved and all loved you they're guilty i've seen them all there like that what was it quickening power john the revelator was still full of quickly power that stood up and seen the end from the beginning isaiah was full of quickly power and stood up and seen the millennium and all quickening power he had the spirit that raised up christ from the dead dwelling you they were quick in your mighty bond mortal body remember the quickness power look what we see in this day the quickly power has come to us to open the seven seals what was that the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of god the quickening power of god foretold this would take place the quickening power of god made the world testify to it it's the truth the angel of the lord what told you was around that killer fight quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth and then that they didn't know what it was and when you just looked this way and it's our lord of medicine he is the one who opened those seals he is so sealed or the whole word of god is christ and christ is the field that was opened what is opening us that revealing christ and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they didn't they took the picture and there he is senator supreme judge showing that he's alpha and omega the beginning and the end what identification quaking power get back to us quickening power let's just see is coming creeping power stretches from death to life quickly power gives discernment to know what's wrong with him what to do what you have done and what you ought not have done what you should have done and what you will be greasing power all these things our lord jesus is so full of quickly power he was all of it together he's so full of quickly power he said this you destroy this body and i'll raise it up in three days talk about confidence and quitting power destroy this body and i'll wear this temple and i'll bring it up in three days why why'd he say that he knew that it was written of him see it is written here by the word of god which could not fail the word said i will not suffer my holy one to see corruption neither will i leave his soul in hell and he knows that quickness power would raise him up that there would be one cell corrupted he said you destroy this temple i'll bring it back again in three days why it was prophecy the word of god and prophecy if it's true word of god cannot fail and the same prophecy and word of god that they raised him up says that we are already raised with him don't worry said fear not and it is written that the spirit that is now within him now in us also quickens our moral bodies here on friends the s-o-n is up the sun is up no now look at transfiguration with everyone represented there there was the living thing that raptured that was elijah then in there and there stood moses the dead saints referee also pulled them ahead quickly power whether one died and the other didn't die they're all there notice oh look what we're now seeing in these last days the same thing as he promised john 14 12. now look servant people say you claim to have power no no we're just like them at mount transfiguration see certainly we do not claim power but we like like they was on the mount transfiguration they wasn't saying more to say seriously i am the disciples they should i am to i am you know what happened notice they seen jesus glorified that's all they want to see represented jesus glorified and so is it today we don't try to be some big person we don't care what people say about us our name ain't nothing it's his name our life is nothing it's his life it's his power not our power and there's only one thing that we love to do is see him glorified and how can he be when he's glorified in us by his resurrection it's in us we see him represented again as he was today did you get that i think our desire is not to be glorified our desire is not some big name partners are it's not bruce some church or make more than a sunday school or try to bring in hog tithes push in offer a picnic party or bring stars buttons or something else like that that's not our design our desire is to see him glorify glory by what not with self-pride but in us our lives to prove he is alive and living in us if i can get myself out of the way so when william branham not even thought of and you not even thought him so we can see jesus glorified among us see him that's our desire that's the quick gives us the quickening of us and it gives us joy to know that we are with him both flesh and bone of him being the bride of him and seeing his same vindicated methods proving in us that he is now risen from the dead no wonder he said fear or not first now notice we are redeemed by him and now risen with him that's what easter means to the people risen with him notice now we have his spirit in us the abstract deed fully paid you don't say well i hope i make it you've already made it right i will make it up already honorably he made it for me not me him well i just want to see him manifest it how can you do it calm down no he's in you he's in you well then lord if i get myself out of the way you can manifest myself how can you do it because you are deemed itself all that the father has given me will come notice the glory with all that evidence correctly witness now this point oh i think of that song on that resurrection morning when death cards will be broken we shall rise hallelujah we shall rise you believe that we shall rise in him we become part of him the easter the revealed secret of god like it was then of life after death we are now alive who were once dead and sent in trust faces the true easter seal has broke death from around me and i'm alive now easter seal at the beginning broke the seal of the roman seal the easter seal that he was sealed up and man when they died was gone but he broke the steel and revealed the secret and now god by his holy spirit has broke the steel from around our lives and christ is revealed as he lives in heaven for now we are quick and with you all page after page we shall rise hallelujah we shall rise amen on that resurrection morning when death lords are broken we shall rise hallelujah oh aren't you glad i'm so glad way back down under a little cold shed one morning the seals were broken and i raised him a new creature he is freaking in power the sun's up not long ago i told a story about a fisherman a fellow come out cardinal fisherman's taking fishing out on the west coast they went out that morning they needed to fish out there for the salmon well you know what takes place yourself a foggy out there i've seen my little brother eddie bisco down there missionary to the indians out there and we fished ourselves out on this coast so this fish was kind of a green horn hill he went fishing and they drifted out waiting for daylight to come in and then and they couldn't hear the fall going no more this fisherman got all excited today we're drifting out to sea hey got all excited he said sit down the old fisherman quite so he knew what he's talking about they just wait till the sun comes up and we see where we're at you see my zombie method of fabulous pentecostals just wait the sun comes up we'll see where we're at it is the word wait do you see the word manifested shining across the seed the wave sheath we'll see where we're at do you love him sorry i kept it this long how many of us go stay over per night man come back again is there one here or a manny who doesn't have this quickening power in you the sun is shined across you set this tabernacle you've listened to tape and yet the spirit has never quickened you so you could follow the word of god that you when a new man could obey every word that he's written oh that's a dangerous thing what if you'd be a dead seed no life but there's something in you to tell you i i want to ride this morning i want to rise from the state that i'm in i don't want to be just a dead seed be less of dirt drip wood i want to rhyme will you raise your hand say pray for me brother god bless you god bless your mother there's no way at all or an altar call what we call an altar call people come up around the altar i'm not too much on it anyhow that was just added to the church during the days of the methodist religion the bible says as many as believe yes we're baptized there's a pool here full of water waiting for any kennedy who is ready to die to themselves now you might be buried in many times in the name of the lord jesus but until that seed is lying see it won't quicken it it's no baptismal waters is like the dude that fell from heaven it could fall upon the sea but there's no life there he can't live but that real baptismal waters of death to yourself and you're ready to die out to everything that you've ever been taught by creeds and denominations which is contrary to the word and you'll walk as a son or a daughter of god and you mean it in your heart watch what that baptism of water will do to you this morning repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your wrongs your sins and you shall receive the sheath the wave offering you shall receive the dynamics the holy ghost for the promises to you and all them to all generations it'll be father god i have spoken and taken up much of the people's time but lord god there's no stopping to it it just seems you just have to quit and walk away and rest and come back we're living in a dying world amongst dying people with a message of life and with the evidence of the resurrection dear god we are only going to be mortal once and what will it be if we let this opportunity passes our hearts are burning our souls are thrilled these who have come in and many are hearing this message this morning yes two or three hundred lifted their hands they want to believe lord oh surely that speed's not dead lord how could they raise their hands like that there's something oh god it's all self it's that wife of job standing there saying oh but lord that that joke that believer walked in this morning die completely and be buried here in this baptismal waters of dewdrop that come from heaven the word of god that says it will wash away every sin and remit it you're baptized in the name of jesus christ what for the remission of your sins sins remitted in the name of jesus christ may then father may if they're sick may they walk out well may they may they walk out under the power of the holy spirit if they've been sinners they walk out washed and cleaned and the mechanics by going in the dynamics come from above the holy spirit and catch them away lord quicken their mortal bodies then we shall hear genuine new terms powers of god love untold dying grace and living grace and a resurrected christ a body a bride representing him on earth father they are yours they raise their hands i have preached the word now father receive them i pray in jesus christ's name i said amen you love him isn't he wonderful are you satisfied that you are a part of that easter resurrection that you raised with raise your hand you are included my little children as paul would have said i'm not trying to impersonate him what the love i love you i started the roads and everything else to get here to get to speak with you come up out of the desert across the snow grits and so forth to get your we flying planes you drive across the country so we can get together we love one another we are part of one another don't you never let satan tell you anything else being a part of one another we are a part of him and we are fellow citizens of the kingdom enjoying these blessings together of the resurrection and now see now you are already resurrected when god raised him up he raised the sun is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was to be resurrected completely in that last day your potential do you have now why do you know your soul changed didn't it your body come into obedience to it that it obedies to what a church is the word which is the lie then you are now resurrected from the dead it is easter with jesus and i it's easter with you and jesus as easter with you i and jesus we are all or jesus you and i we're all resurrected together and we will rise at the last date even though our spirits leave our bodies even though the bodies rush may they go to dust may they be burnt up may they be in the bottom of the sea the bible said an angel poured out he is upon the scene and everything that died come up yeah there's nothing can hide us or separate us from that god that we love so well let's raise this up together god bless you i've sitting here a long time if that people still on that telephone they sure 50 cents a minute they've really paid this morning but i just couldn't stop at that hour i just had to go on now the lord willing i'll be back tonight to talk with you again and if i can't then you all know i suppose we're not owned no no we're on telephone no more not on telephone no more you all know where i'm going don't you africa have called for a long time for years i've tried to get back now a vision that spirit of the lord has prepared the way amen praise the lord instead when those poor ladies heard that i didn't come the last time went there they laid on the ground day and night moaned and cried and said lord what have we done thousands of them those people don't even believe they got a soul and they cried and they moaned and they forgot don't you spend no word ahead please don't see if that visa would happen to go through there and get amongst them ministers that stopped me right there i have to go in as a hunter i'm going up to the queen that brought 17 train loads down and come down to the meeting you get to go up and hunt on her territory and i go in my passport everything calls for a hunter i'm a rangers service then there's going to be one brother being said what are capital meeting parks the stadiums are already rented they don't even know it since oh glory praise that the will of god will not be hindered that my soul has cried for africa since the blessing may i be able to return again and bring you message of a great meeting i probably won't see anymore from the day until i return back regardless for a few days now it's 10th of may will you pray for me remember you don't know what troubles are to hit there which doctors on every side and the devil and don't think they don't know what to do you better know what you're talking about when you stand before him but i know in whom i have believed and i'm persuaded he's able to keep that which i've committed to against that day now there's some packages playing here dear god as this message this morning of the resurrection and be standing here lord and proving by the word that that quickening power is in the believing child therefore upon believing in faith that that quickly power has changed my life and these people believe god and it changed their lives and we pray one for another i'm laying my hands upon these handkerchiefs that may god who quickened jesus christ and brought him from the dead and that spirit that raised him up from the dead be dwelling in our body the spirit that was up on the body of elijah that you're being dead and nothing but bones it had quickness power in it the hands of the apostles had quickly powering us the minds of the apostles the sight of the apostles the the tongues of the believers all had quickening powers now may that quickly power as i lay this word upon them in my hands to represent a professor by grace of that quickness power make quicken every one of these sick bodies and they be made hold again through jesus christ's name may it not only for these packages but for those people out there in the audience everyone that suffers those little children elderly people whatever they are maybe that quickening power quicken them right now in jesus name amen now how many got quickening power i'll lay your hands up on one another if that quickly powers to you now there's only one thing to keep it from henry that's your unbelief a woman touched his garment was made whole a roman soldier spit his face and went to hell so it depends on where you at do you believe it do you believe it now i want you to bow your head and pray for one another just just pray right out just say lord this person just pray for one another dear god [Music] we do this in the name of jesus christ the only names given among man whereby that we can be saved for him these people who are fellow citizens of the kingdom are professor of lightning power quicken it to them or just now may the spirit go from eagle to eagle from word to earth to the fullness of jesus christ be made manifest that each of the bodies for physical spiritual or any need they are needed as we lay our hands upon one another in jesus christ i wanted to play it all the way to the end because it's nice to hear it all way through the end but i also love that prayer at the end brother branham admonished us all the way through this message that the quickening power is in the believer the same spirit that raised jesus christ from the dead if it be in you it'll quicken your mortal body and brother branham doesn't end with a prayer line he ends with the believers laying hands on one another because this has to come into manifestation it's not just something he preaches something he believed and he was trying to get the people to recognize that you can lay hands on one another and the same thing's true today it hasn't diminished one on man let's go into our questions and look at those first and then i want to look at a few other comments first question what three steps must you take to walk the highway to the doors of heaven let's go to paragraph 2 33 on page 30. page 30 paragraph 233 everyone said i remember one time when i first started preaching many years ago we was living right up here on the road right just above here i was preaching right here at the church and she dreamed to dream he's speaking of his mother that i was standing here by the side of three steps and i was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the highway and on the highway is a little pearly like white line run right through the doors of heaven to the pearly gate and that pearly that burley had been stretched out to the top of this or that pearl had been stretched out to the top of these steps if that ain't my message exactly today justification sanctification the baptism holy ghost and i was saying that a person was to come by these three steps to be able to walk that highway there was a lady come by now you know what kind of shoes people wore 35 years ago there was a lady come by and on a great big pair of like they wear today spike heeled shoes and she come by and and i said wait a minute sister you can't walk that highway with that said you can't do that she said ah she said look around at the rest at the rest of the women said don't believe him he's a madman see don't believe him i'll show you i can be justified sanctified and filled with the holy ghost and still walk that she i just let her go couldn't do no more about it couldn't stop her and she jumped up on the highway and she looked back at the sisters at the sister and said see i told you she started to run up and she i and you know as the bible said in isaiah the fifth chapter that they would have outstretched next they have to they're pitched over they have to to keep their balance when the high heels pitched him forward i remember brother lonnie explaining this with a diagram years ago the reason that the high heel shoes are so immoral because it pushes a woman off her center of gravity pushes her forward and she has to arch her back when she arch her back she augments her breasts so the whole thing is a perversion when she does that when she arches her back she also augments her backside and augments her breast and it all is just to show off the figure of a woman that's why you know whether they're fat or whether they're skinny it's not the fat or the skinny it's how high they are amen and brother brendon brings this right out of the scripture he's not just saying this for not he brings it right out of isaiah the fifth chapter and they would have outstretched next they have to they they're pitched oversea mincing they have to have to twist mincing as they go making a tinkling with their heels see the daughters of zion in the last day and she started up that highway just as hard as she could run and after a while the road got narrower and narrower she started reeling mincing like that and off she went and mother said the horriblest screams that i ever heard in my life was that woman falling into those flames and smoke going down down like that said i turned around and said see she just obeyed everything but one word see everything but one word sure pentecostal women can be saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost and then fail absolutely man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds see and she failed it and as i said see she would have went on in all right but see she failed to listen telling her what was ahead and he's wrote the gospel by the disciples apostles and doctrine the apostles and prophets and so forth and they won't listen i wanted to bring this out for a particular reason first brother brandon said that was his ministry just exactly justification sanctification baptism holy ghost but but in in the way that he's taking this dream and he's typing it with his ministry you realize that justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost got you on the highway that third step wasn't the finish line amen brother baby said the baptism holy ghost is the new birth that's just the start you just begin and then you grow up amen so now now that that third step gets you on the highway where you walk that pearly line all the way to heaven's doors and so that's where brother branham had such an issue with the pentecostals because they stopped amen but you had to walk all the way and then brother branham also says here that you know sure a pentecostal woman can be saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost and then fail brother branham made this really really clear and anointed ones at the end time he says you can have the baptism holy ghost on your spirit not your soul on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell amen and that's what brother branham was seeing there was a baptism that had fallen amen and the tares were being blessed along with the wheat but it wasn't going deep in the tares because there was no seed there for it to strike amen but it was just the baptism of the holy ghost but i want to pick this up for the true baptism of the holy ghost that settles us in in paragraph 231 back on page 30. just before he gets to the story he tells this story for a reason and i'm going to back up and show you in paragraph 231 it says now look how can you say that that spirit dwells in you though you've done everything that you thought was right here is your evidence whether you got it or not if the spirit that was in christ in you it also quickens you to the word for he is the word and if it contrary quickens you away from the word then it isn't the spirit of christ care what you've done until that moves you in the word my sheep hear my voice and they shall live by every word every word i was talking on the other day so you see the baptism in the soul that brings a new birth will take you in line with every word this pentecostal woman that he saw that says i can come justification sanctification baptist holy ghost and walk that but ignoring isaiah chapter 5 and ignoring the commandment of the word amen it shows that she didn't have the real thing in the soul because it would have kept her in line with the word all the way through and for us who received amen received the real baptist holy ghost in the soul amen with a genuine new birth it'll keep you all the way friends it'll keep you lined up with the word and don't worry if you get off step his rod in this staff they comfort my comfort me he'll keep us in line the next question question number two what is the abstract to the title deed let's go to paragraph 246 on page 32. what is the abstract to the title deed towards the bottom of the page paragraph 246 like the pentecostal experience today and the coming of the holy ghost in this last days as promised is like the abstract to a title deed see now you can get a title sure see you can get a title to a place but that still don't say it's yours no sir somebody way back yonder could come in and put a claim on it but when you get an abstract that shows that everything that's ever against it is struck off plumb back from the foundation is that right oh praise god you can claim to be a christian but the devil he may want to put a claim on that also amen but the abstract will take it back further all the way back to the foundation and prove everything is stricken off paragraph 248 and when a man has said that he believes the word and then when the holy spirit comes it is the abstract to the title deed that that gives you permission when you have that abstract that every bit of that belongs to you and everything is on it belongs to you amen and that gives us the abstract when the holy ghost comes upon you this title deed that god saw back yonder for the foundation of the world and put it name on the book of life but was born through a man and a woman and subject to sin and guilty of sin but when i believed on it i received the deed but when the holy ghost come it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it my father done it my grandmother done it like the little epileptic child i prayed for a few minutes ago that came through from the grandparents the absolutely fell down upon the child i said but when the abstract has come it struck off omitted everything i'm an abstract holder then amen and as sure as the spirit that raised christ from the dead i have an abstract deed that i'm part of that body with the abstract of the holy ghost making that body of the word live out just exactly like it did in him as he promised in the last day the abstract all my sins are struck out all your sins are struck out by the blood of jesus christ and the holy ghost is come as an abstract to the title deed that god give me by grace by foreknowledge oh my what are you scared about no wonder he said fear not i am he that was dead and alive again and i'm alive forevermore and have the keys of death and hell don't worry about nothing even death ain't going to hurt you notice beautiful let's go right quick now the abstract title the debt is settled everything against it has been struck off oh what a revelation we need friends everything against it has been struck off there's nothing to hinder me now there's nothing to stop me now there's nothing to keep me from receiving every promise in the book is mine amen everything that's against it's been struck off he's paved the way he's given the promises and there's nothing going to keep me from it now nothing going to keep me from the fullness of my redemption amen everything against it has been struck off glory i may act silly but i feel good now to see an abstract d do you realize what that means do you realize what that means brother there is nothing can take it away from you amen i'm a holder amen what deed i have now cashed in on my beneficiary of his death burial and resurrection he became he became me that i might become him now he become a sinner that i might become a son amen and hold the abstract deed for these signs shall follow them that believe see the abstract deed oh praise be to god what an assurance that we have seen in this day let's look at par question number three what is the opening of the seals let's start back at paragraph 304 on page 36. nope sorry page 38 nope page 40. wow i was way off down at the bottom of page 40 let's look at 30304 the question is what is the opening of the seals i want to begin all the way back here at paragraph 304 john the revelator was fill filled full of quickening power that stood up and seen the end from the beginning isaiah was full of the quickening power and stood up and seen the millennium and all quickening power and if the spirit that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you it'll quicken your body mortal body remember the quickening power look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals what was that the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of god the quickening power of god foretold this would take place see the quickening power of god made the world testify to it it's the truth the angel of the lord i told you was around in the pillar of fire quickening power and let the world testify that it's the truth and in that they didn't know what it was and we knew just look this way it's our lord up there you see he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ what is the opening of the seals revealing christ i want you to hold on to that statement because it gets really good what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and here he is standing there supreme judge showing that he is alpha and omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us so what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ let's go all the way back to paragraph 12 with something a statement brother benham opened with and i want to read that in this context page two all the way back on page two paragraph twelve and so there he spoke to me and said the seven seals will be open the seven mystery sevenfold mystery of the bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed and we yet a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these blessings and hearing these mysteries marriage divorce servants all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by god himself that's opened those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in the last days what is the opening of the seals revealing christ and brother brenham said these seven mysteries would reveal the church that she was part of christ from all the way in the beginning it's part of the mystery laying under the seven seals the revelation of christ is the revelation of christ both male and female so the revelation of the church the seven mysteries of the church of what she was she was always in christ that's part of the revelation of the seven seals and part of the revelation of christ and christ is the mystery of god revealed are you part of that by his grace by his foreknowledge not me and my flesh not the boy that was born of parents but that attribute of god that came from the mind of god as part of him and always was part of him and we believe it by the revelation of the seven seals praise god that blessed me question number four what does the breaking of the easter seal in our lives reveal let's look at paragraph 325 paragraph 3 25 what does the breaking of the easter seal in our lives reveal paragraph 3 25 on page 43 you believe that we shall rise in him we become part of him the easter the easter the revealed secret of god like it was then of life after death we are now alive who were once dead in sin and trespasses the true easter seal has broke death from around me and i'm alive the easter seal at the beginning broke the seal of the roman seal the easter seal that he was sealed up and men when they died was gone but he broke the seal and revealed the secret and now god by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and christ is revealed as he lives in us christ is revealed amen what is the the the breaking of the seals it's revealing christ amen and now as god by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and christ is revealed as he lives in us for now we are quickened with him let's go down to paragraph 3 26 oh aren't you glad i'm so glad way back yonder and a little old cold shed one morning the seals were broken and i raised with him a new creature his quickening power the sun is up amen the sun is up amen praise be to god i thank god that he's he by his message of this hour and by the revelation of the holy ghost he has broken the seals from our life and revealed what revealed christ in you the hope of glory there's a few other comments that i just want to make before we close if we could go back to paragraph 242 paragraph 242 on the bottom of page 31. i just want to highlight a few things brother benham said but remember he went there with you in him god had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body they are one same same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the bride well how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride but when he did when he when he did everything even to proving it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards then don't the bride have to do the same thing have to be exactly what the word said she would be in these last days don't she have to return through malachi 4 don't she have to be manifest like it was in the days of sodom don't the world have to be just like exactly like it is isn't these things perfect identification of the word of god made known to us you were there in him that life of god is inside of you it was there then amen that seed that attribute of god was in you now it was in there then brother branham said that's why he said we already he already made us pay for our sins when we were with him in the calvary and that's why brother branham gets gets down and he says it's not that a will it's not that he will or he might he already has it's finished amen and when the abstract comes when the holy ghost comes amen the holy the baptism of the holy ghost proves that there's nothing against you and your title deed is good all the way back to the foundation of the world all the way back to the land's book of life it's the evidence the baptism holy ghost is the evidence that your's title is secure everything's struck against it there's nothing that can foul it up there's no claim against it because it come all the way back from the original writing in heaven and the lamb's book of life where the deed was recorded and it's clear from here back there with no obstructions what a security that's been given to us there's no hope so in this friend there cannot be a hope so if there's a hope so then we've got to go back to a fundamental revelation and say god i need the assurance of the baptism of holy ghost to quicken to me the reality that my name is written on that lamb's book of life so that i quit hoping that i'll make it we can't hope that we'll make it we have to know that we've already made it that when he was on calvary i that life that's in me now was there yeah it's secure it's finished amen praise god if we're still in the cycle of hoping and failing and restoring and hoping amen we need to say god i need a deeper revelation i need an assurance that comes from the baptism holy ghost that i know that i know that i know that it's finished for me and then i'm secure that's what this message has done friends it's given us such an assurance such a guarantee amen praise god let's look at paragraph 303 on page 40. paragraph 303 on page 40. and one day when i was wearing myself i said you boy you'd better go ahead you're 50 years old if you're going to do anything for the lord you better hurry up and do it you're getting old and there that morning the quickening power come and he let me look over the curtain and i seen all of you over there oh he said all that you ever loved and all loved you they're given to you see i seen them all over there like that what was it quickening power oh praise god amen i hope that brings security to your heart let's look at paragraph 317 over on page 42. paragraph 317 on page 42. we're just like them at mount transfiguration c certainly we do not claim power we like they was on the mount transfiguration they wasn't saying moses say see who see who i am the disciples said see who i am see who i am you know what happened notice they seen jesus glorified that's all they wanted to see represented jesus glorified see friends this is a major attitude adjustment brother branham's bringing the right proper correct attitude and so is it today we don't try to be some big person we don't care what people say about us our name ain't nothing it's his name our life isn't nothing it's his life it's his power not our power and there is only one thing that we love to do is see him glorified and how can it be when he's glorified in us by his resurrection that's in us we see him represented again as he was today did you get that see our desire is not to be glorified our desire is not some big name our desire is not to boost some church or make more in sunday school or try to bring in hogtie push in offer a picnic party or bring stars buttons or something else like that that's not our desire our desire to see him glorified glorified what not with self-pride but in us our lives to prove he is alive and living in us if i can get myself out of the way so when william branham not even thought of and you not even thought of till we can see jesus glorified among us see him that's our desire that gives us the quickening power and it gives us joy to know that we are with him both flesh and bone of him being the bride of him and seeing his name send his same vindicated methods proving in us that he is now risen from the dead sea no wonder he said fear not for now notice we are redeemed by him and now risen with him that's what easter means to the people risen with him notice now we have his spirit in us the abstract deed fully paid no you don't say well i hope i make it you've already made it not i will make it i've already made it remember friends you can't even say i will make it you can't even say i will make it that day i will be there no i i will you already have you're already seated in heavenly places in christ jesus you've already paid for your sins on calvary you're just now recognizing it but not i will make it i've already made it i never made it he made it for me see not me him well brother bannon they said i don't care what they say there he made it for me that's all i want i'm caring about i just i just want to see him manifested how can you do it call him down no he's in you see he's in you well then lord if i can get myself out of the way you can manifest myself how can you do it because you ordained it so all that the father has given me will come notice glory see brother branham was the seventh angel he was also the fulfillment of the prophecy of malachi 4 that i will send elijah the prophet he was that manifestation of elijah prophet that elijah's spirit was in him he was the seventh angel he was the seventh church age messenger he was a mighty prophet amen and he never lifted himself up he never got glory for himself he did nothing but point to christ and the truth is we are the bride of jesus christ by his doing by his grace by his choosing not anything we've done ourselves and if we can't as the bride have the same attitude that prophet had with all the manifestations he had all the scriptural references he could point to his own life still he humbled himself and subjected himself to christ and was always pointing upward to jesus christ if we can't have that same attitude then we're not as bride if it makes us elevated if it makes us proud if we talk about we're the bride we're the bride we are we are his wife and he's the great one among us it's jesus christ who we want to seek glorify we want to see him elevated we want to see him glorified he will glorify his bride but she will not glorify herself sometimes i get nervous and bride preaching that it's too much glorification of the bride and not enough glorification of the lord god christ himself will lift his bride up and say here she is then the way he goes with her she does not have to lift herself all she has to do is keep lifting him up him let that be our attitude friends paragraph 346 paragraph 346 on page 46 and now see now you are already resurrected when god raised him up he raised you the son is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom of life like he was to be resurrected completely in the last day your potentials you have now why do you know your soul changed didn't it your body come in obedience to it didn't it and obedience to what a church the word which is the life when you are now resurrected from the dead it is easter with jesus and i it's easter with you and jesus and it's easter with you i and jesus we are all our jesus you and i we are all resurrected together what a consolation the comment i liked in there the sun is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was all the potentials are there all the the power is there the word is there but you're growing into a blossom life like he was i said lord let me reflect that life let's go back to paragraph 333 and i want to finish with this brother branham asked them to bow their heads 3 33 and i just want to leave this as a thought is there any here or many who doesn't have this quickening power in you i'm not going to ask anyone to raise their hands or make any kind of movement or acknowledgement but you've heard this message we've listened to it today and if you don't have that assurance where you can say not i hope to make it or i will make it you say i've already made it if you don't have that assurance that assurance is available friends is there one here or many who doesn't have this quickening power and you the son has shined a cross and you sit in this tabernacle you listen to tapes and yet the spirit has never quickened you till you could follow the word of god that you women and you men could obey every word and that he's written oh that's a dangerous thing what if you would be a dead seed no life in you but there is something in you that tells you i want to rise this morning i want to rise from the state i'm in i don't want to be just a dead seed be left to dirt and drift away i want to rise you may be in here you may be a young person an old person or something in between amen but if you don't have that assurance that quickening power the abstract that's come to the title deed to let you know everything's struck off amen and you may say you're afraid and may not have been able to line up to the word you've heard the word preached and won online but not able to line up to it amen brother branham's saying amen what you need is the abstract to the title deed you need the same spirit that raised jesus from the dead to quicken your mortal body and he says but there's something in you that tells you i want to rise this morning i'm asking you is there something in you that says i want to rise this morning i want this mortal body to be quickened by his spirit i want to line to every word i want to come full obedience to the word i want to surrender my life i want to die out i don't want my own way i want his way i don't want to be glorified i want him to be glorified i want to surrender i want to give up i want to turn over i want to rise if that's in you and there's something in you pulling you that way and there's a desire then you can rise friends there's a light here the pillar of fire is still with the word it hasn't gone anywhere the light is here the sun is up and it will quicken you brother says will you raise your hand say pray for me brother god bless you god bless you my look at the hands there is no way at all for an altar call what we call an altar call people come up around the altar i'm not too much on any anyhow that was just added to the church during the days of the methodist revival see the bible said as many as believe see we're baptized there is a pool here full of water waiting for any candidate who is ready to die to themselves there's it friends ready for any candidate that's ready to die to themselves now you might be buried in many times in the name of the lord jesus but until that seed is life see it won't quicken no no baptism of waters is like the dew that fell from the heavens it can fall upon the seed but there's no life there it can't live but if that real baptism of waters of death to yourself and you're ready to die out to everything that you've ever been taught by creeds and denominations which is contrary to the word and you'll walk as a son or daughter of god and you mean it in your heart watch what that baptism of water will do to you this morning repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the mission of your wrongs your sins and you shall receive the sheaf the wave offering you shall receive the dynamics the holy ghost for the promises to you and all them to all generations if you're here and you want to rise i say the sun is up it takes a death to self let's all stand musicians if you could come and brother ben if you can make your way up it is the rising of the sun the sun is up it's it's burning bright friends the word has been made manifest all the clouds and the gloom has been parted and moved away and the light here is to strike the seed and there's a time for each one of you some of you been raised up little babies in church and always come but there's a time for that light to strike that seed for god depart the waters in your heart for god to move back the clouds in your life and if there's something in you that's crying out say i want to rise i don't want to live my own life i don't i want to be whatever that word says is what i want to be friends if that's in you and there's a cry out for that that is absolutely the grace of god don't play with it don't push it off don't kick it down the road if there's something stirring in you says i want to rise i want to be the word i want christ glorified in my life i want to obey every word i want the spirit that raised him from the dead to quicken this mortal body what i cannot do myself i want him to do for me if that desires in you that's the grace of god and if it was in you i would just lift my heart and my hands to him and say god i receive it you know my heart i want it i believe this is it and i want it in jesus christ's name god will give it to your friends it's a promise amen it's a gift it's not something you earn not something you work up not something you pull down or pump up it's a gift amen but you've got to come through repentance amen you've got to die through the waters of death to self is repentance and you've got to come to the waters of the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the wave sheath the quickening power the baptism of the holy ghost let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father god we could have never done this on our own we could have never even come up with this truth but god you spoke it through the lips of a prophet you made it so manifest and so real and brought it so to life out of the bible that we can see that this is the day that the sun is up the wave sheath has went forth we've seen you in all your glory amen god and we know that you're here to quicken every seed to life every seed that you for ordained and predestined to life when that light strikes it it'll come to life god i pray if there's a seed laying here that's been covered under darkness of hybridization born wrong through sexual desire coming to this earth with the wrong nature i pray god that you begin to part those waters now that you move away the clouds lord and let the light of this message lord this true word your reality hit that seed lord and bring it to life even tonight on a wednesday night i pray god that there are those who are reaching out to you i pray you'd reach back to them with the baptism of the holy ghost the assurance lord that it is the abstract to the title deed that my deed is secure my fair has been paid and everything that's against me is stricken off and not i will make it or i hope to make it but i've already made it by his grace god it's not what we've done it's what you've done for us but we accept it now by faith and we rejoice in it in jesus name god sweep through this place and touch every heart there's a seed that's not come to life may they come to life now lord your light is shining as bright as it ever has may it penetrate the deepest darkest lord the deep and darkness lord of the world and may it hit that seed and bring it to life we trust in you lord we rejoice in the assurance that you've given us and the guarantee that we have lord in the solid assurance that we have that we've already made it because you made it for us and we are benefactors lord of your overcoming and god we thank you for that you've made us joint heirs lord you took our place so that we could take yours and we say thank you lord jesus we love you for it may we give the rest of our lives in the last moments of breath in our body to surrender to you that you could live through us may we give our lives completely to you to live this word so that you could be glorified may we surrender all as a thanksgiving to you lord we ask these things in the name of our lord jesus christ amen god bless you all
