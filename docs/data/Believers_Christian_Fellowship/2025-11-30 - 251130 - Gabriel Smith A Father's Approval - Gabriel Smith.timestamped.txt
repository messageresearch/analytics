[0:00] Oh, wonderful
[0:03] Savior
[0:04] is Jesus
[0:07] my Lord.
[0:09] A wonderful
[0:13] Savior
[0:15] to me.
[0:19] He hideeth
[0:22] my soul in the
[0:27] of the rock
[0:29] where rivers
[0:32] of meure
[0:34] I seek.
[0:38] Oh, he hides
[0:42] my soul
[0:44] in the cliff
[0:46] of the rock
[0:49] that shadows
[0:51] a dry thirsty
[0:55] land.
[0:59] He hideth
[1:01] my life
[1:04] in the depths of his love.
[1:08] And God lurs me there
[1:13] with his hand
[1:18] and covers
[1:21] me there with his hand.
[1:27] Oh, what a wonderful
[1:31] Savior
[1:33] is Jesus,
[1:35] my Lord.
[1:38] He taketh
[1:40] my burden
[1:43] away.
[1:48] He holdeth
[1:50] me up and I shall not be moved. You
[1:58] give
[2:00] me strength
[2:02] as my name.
[2:07] He hideth
[2:09] my soul
[2:12] in the cl
[2:14] of the rock.
[2:17] Dead shadows
[2:19] a dry thirsty
[2:22] land.
[2:26] Oh, he hideth
[2:29] my life
[2:31] in the depths of his love.
[2:36] And God purs.
[2:55] Oh, with numberless
[2:59] blessings
[3:01] each
[3:03] he grounds.
[3:06] and filled with his fullness
[3:11] divine.
[3:16] I sing in my rapure.
[3:21] Oh, glory
[3:23] to God
[3:25] for such a redeemer
[3:30] as mine.
[3:34] Oh, he hideth
[3:37] my soul
[3:40] in the cl
[3:42] of the rock.
[3:45] Dead shadows
[3:47] a dry thirsty
[3:50] land.
[3:54] Oh, he hideth
[3:57] my life
[3:59] in the depths of his love.
[4:04] And God b me there
[4:09] with his hand
[4:14] and covers
[4:16] me there with his hand.
[4:23] Oh, and cold in his brightness.
[4:29] Transported
[4:31] I rise
[4:33] to meet him in clouds of the sky.
[4:43] His perfect
[4:45] salvation.
[4:48] His wonderful
[4:51] love
[4:52] I'll shout with the millions
[4:57] on high.
[5:01] Oh, he hide in my soul
[5:07] in the cl

[5:12] dead shadows
[5:14] a dry thirsty
[5:17] land.
[5:21] He hideth

[5:26] in the depths of his love.
[5:31] And God th me there with his hand.
[5:40] and covers
[5:43] each hair with his hand.
[5:58] when I don't understand
[6:03] and things get out of hand
[6:07] and I don't know what else that I can do
[6:16] when I've done the best I can
[6:21] in the strength I have.
[6:25] I'm sorry, Lord. I should have come to
[6:29] you.
[6:33] So I cast
[6:36] my cares upon
[6:39] you.
[6:43] A strong and mighty tower
[6:47] that I can run to.
[6:51] A present help in trouble times when I
[6:57] am confused.
[6:59] Lord, I cast all my cares upon
[7:05] you.
[7:09] When will I ever learn
[7:13] to put my trust in you?
[7:17] When every time you always see me
[7:22] through.
[7:26] When all of my fears
[7:30] they hide you from my view.
[7:34] Oh, help me Lord to cast my cares upon
[7:39] you.
[7:42] So I cast
[7:45] my cares upon you.
[7:51] A strong and mighty tower
[7:56] that I can run to.
[8:00] a present help in trouble times when I
[8:05] am confused.
[8:08] Lord, I cast all my cares upon
[8:13] you.
[8:16] I cast all my cares upon
[8:21] you.
[8:24] I lay all my burdens
[8:29] down at your feet.
[8:33] And anytime
[8:35] I don't know just what to do,
[8:41] I will cast all my cares upon
[8:46] you.
[8:49] Though I cast
[8:51] my cares upon
[8:54] you,
[8:58] a strong and mighty tower
[9:02] that I can run to,
[9:06] a present help in trouble times when I
[9:12] am confused.
[9:14] Lord, I cast all my cares upon
[9:19] you.
[9:22] So I cast
[9:25] my cares upon
[9:28] you.
[9:31] A strong and mighty tower
[9:35] that I can run to.
[9:39] a present help in trouble times when I
[9:45] am confused.
[9:47] Lord, I cast all my cares upon
[9:53] you.
[9:56] A present help in trouble times when I
[10:02] am confused.
[10:04] Lord, I cast all my cares
[10:10] upon
[10:12] you.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; I am thine, O Lord. I have heard thy
[10:30] voice and it told thy love to me.
[10:39] But I long to rise in the arms of faith
[10:48] and be closer
[10:50] drawn
[10:52] to thee.
[10:55] Draw me nearer,
[11:00] nearer, blessed hope, to the cross where
[11:06] thou has died.
[11:11] Draw me nearer,
[11:14] nearer,
[11:16] nearer, blessed Lord
[11:21] to thy preious
[11:24] leading
[11:26] sight.
[11:30] Consecrate
[11:31] me now to thy service,
[11:36] Lord, by the power
[11:40] of grace divine.
[11:45] Let my soul look up with a steadfast
[11:52] hope and my will be lost
[11:57] in the
[12:00] draw meer
[12:05] nearer blessed Lord to the cross where
[12:11] thou has
[12:16] Be nearer,
[12:19] nearer,
[12:21] nearer. Blessed Lord,
[12:26] thy preious
[12:29] leading
[12:30] sound.
[12:34] Oh, the pure delight
[12:37] of a single
[12:40] love that before
[12:43] thy throne I stand.
[12:49] When I kneel in prayer and with thee my
[12:55] God I commune
[12:59] as friend with friend

[13:08] nearer blessed Lord to the cross where
[13:14] thou has eyes.

[13:22] nearer,
[13:24] nearer, blessed Lord,
[13:28] to thy preious
[13:31] leading
[13:33] side.
[13:36] There are depths of love that I cannot
[13:42] know till I cross the narrow
[13:48] sea.
[13:51] There are heights of joy yet I may not
[13:57] reach till I rest in peace
[14:02] with thee.
[14:06] Draw me nearer,
[14:10] nearer, blessed Lord, to the cross where
[14:16] thou hast died.

[14:37] Oh, I am thine, O Lord. I have heard thy
[14:44] voice and infold
[14:47] thy love to thee.
[14:52] But I long to rise in the arms of faith.
[15:00] Be close
[15:04] to thee.
[15:07] Call me here,
[15:11] near blessed Lord, to the cross where
[15:17] thou has hide.
[15:21] Draw me nearer,
[15:26] nearer. Blessed Lord
[15:31] to thy preious
[15:35] side.
[15:37] If we could all stand as brother Gabe
[15:39] comes, sing, I give my mind. I give my
[15:43] mind
[15:47] completely to you.
[15:52] Lord,
[15:55] fill me with your thoughts.
[16:01] Make it all brand new.
[16:06] Change my life.
[16:12] Let me live in all that's true.
[16:20] I just want to think
[16:23] like you.
[16:28] Oh,
[16:30] take
[16:33] me
[16:35] and walk
[16:39] me.
[16:42] teach me to
[16:47] be still.
[16:53] Lead
[16:55] me
[16:58] and guide
[17:01] me.
[17:04] Show me your perfect
[17:09] will.
[17:13] I give my life.
[17:18] Come be to you,
[17:23] Lord.
[17:26] Fill me with your thoughts.
[17:31] Make it all brand new.
[17:35] Change my life.
[17:40] Let me live in all that's true.
[17:48] I just want to think
[17:51] of you.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:00] Trust um it's everyone's
[18:03] heart's cry this morning.
[18:06] I just want the mind that was in Christ
[18:08] to be in us.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; And uh greet you all this morning in the
[18:13] name of the Lord.
[18:15] Oh, praise the Lord. We got some
[18:17] visitors in the house of God.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; And so we just want everyone to feel at
[18:22] home
[18:24] and uh feel welcome.
[18:26] Trust that uh you all had a good
[18:30] Thanksgiving.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh appreciate uh the Lord
[18:35] Jesus giving us another year.
[18:38] And um just want to um mention uh our
[18:45] precious brother Bob Brooks this
[18:48] morning. Uh he's at home resting. Um he
[18:52] had um some problem with some uh blood
[18:55] clots, I believe, in his lungs. And so
[18:58] he had a a a procedure done a day or two
[19:01] ago. And so thankfully he's at home
[19:04] resting. And so if you I tell you, I
[19:07] love that soldier.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; Hey, brother Bob, you know, he just
[19:12] &gt;&gt; I love that man. And uh so just trust
[19:15] that uh God give him a speedy recovery.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; And um talked to pastor last night. And
[19:23] so he's already he was already at
[19:25] Junction City yesterday. So um just want
[19:29] to remember him that the Lord will give
[19:33] him the right thought to bring to the
[19:35] people to help them and give them
[19:37] traveling mercies. And so um I I got
[19:42] just a little something on my heart and
[19:44] I I really do coveret your prayers this
[19:47] morning. Um, I am uh I'm a little
[19:51] nervous.
[19:53] I um
[19:55] uh uh uh you know, I I um
[20:02] I'm I'm going to
[20:04] uh trust that the Lord will do heart
[20:06] surgery on us all this morning.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; And um I uh trust that it'll be a
[20:12] blessing to you. So um we we'll just
[20:16] read the the book of Luke
[20:20] um
[20:22] the uh 15th chapter.
[20:25] Very familiar portion of scripture.
[20:29] Luke chapter 15 and verse 17. Uh just
[20:33] jump right in here in the middle of the
[20:35] the the story, but I know it's familiar
[20:40] to to most of us if not all of us.
[20:44] speaking of the prodal son after he had
[20:48] lived riotously.
[20:50] Uh, I appreciate the 17th verse because
[20:55] thankfully he came to himself,
[20:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[20:58] &gt;&gt; And uh, I'm sure some of us, all of us
[21:02] ought to be able to realize that it's
[21:04] just the grace of God that we came to
[21:06] ourselves.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; And he said, I I have hired servants of
[21:11] how many hired servants of my father
[21:14] have bred enough despair and I perish
[21:16] with hunger. I will arise and go to my
[21:19] father and say unto him, Father. I have
[21:23] sinned against heaven
[21:26] and before thee, and am no more worthy
[21:29] to be called thy son. Make me as one of
[21:33] thy hired servants."
[21:36] And he arose and came to his father. And
[21:39] when he was yet a great way off, his
[21:42] father, oh my, his father saw him and
[21:48] had compassion
[21:50] &gt;&gt; and he ran
[21:53] and fell on his neck and kissed him.
[21:57] And the son said unto him, "Father, I
[22:00] have sinned against heaven and in thy
[22:03] sight, and am no more worthy to be
[22:06] called thy son."
[22:10] But
[22:11] the but the the father said unto his
[22:14] servants, "Bring forth the best robe,
[22:18] and put it on him, and put on his ring,
[22:21] put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his
[22:23] feet, and bring hither the fatted calf."
[22:26] and he killed it and he said, "Let us
[22:28] eat and be merry. For this my son was
[22:32] dead and is alive again. He was lost and
[22:37] is found." And they began to be married.
[22:41] I'd like to speak to you this morning uh
[22:44] by the help of the Lord on a father's
[22:48] approval.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[22:52] Heavenly Father, truly we love you. this
[22:56] morning and just so grateful for your
[23:00] grace and mercy and to be called by your
[23:02] name.
[23:04] And Lord, uh my my heart is grateful for
[23:08] the news
[23:10] for brother Bob and coming through the
[23:13] surgery and and Lord, I just pray that
[23:17] you would bless his recovery
[23:19] &gt;&gt; and give him health and strength. And
[23:23] Lord,
[23:25] pray your blessings be upon his precious
[23:28] wife, Lord, Sister Suzanne, as she's
[23:32] ministering to his needs. We just pray
[23:34] that you would undergurt her, Lord.
[23:37] And Lord, as we look to you this
[23:40] evening, this morning, this morning,
[23:43] asking Lord that you would have your way
[23:45] in this service, we just ask that you
[23:48] would take the forefront, the
[23:50] preeminence, and that I would be able to
[23:55] just yield myself to you in a way that
[23:57] you could minister to your children.
[24:00] Truly, Lord, that's our heart's desire
[24:03] is just to receive something from you.
[24:06] feeble men that we are, but we bring
[24:10] what we have and we lay it at your feet
[24:11] and ask that you would just receive and
[24:13] use as only you can. We just ask your
[24:16] blessings upon our pastors. He's a way,
[24:20] Lord, that you would just stir up the
[24:22] gift that's within him and pray that you
[24:25] would bless his efforts, Lord, and bring
[24:27] them home safely, all for your glory.
[24:30] God, we love you and we praise you and
[24:33] we commit all we are into your hands and
[24:35] we ask these things to be so in Jesus
[24:38] lovely name. Amen. God bless you. You
[24:43] can be seated.
[24:46] a a father's approval
[24:49] and um I um
[24:54] I think of um the prodal son and
[24:59] um I hope that the Lord will help me to
[25:01] be able to
[25:03] say the right words to help you and
[25:06] encourage you um during this uh holiday
[25:11] season.
[25:12] Um,
[25:14] you know, the the prodal son, I think we
[25:18] can all relate to in some way, shape or
[25:20] form.
[25:21] Um, he he was um,
[25:26] you know, he he had done some things in
[25:29] his life that caused a lot of regret,
[25:32] a lot of pain.
[25:34] And you know the amazing thing is is
[25:39] that he when his father saw him his
[25:42] father ran
[25:44] and no doubt he didn't run with anger
[25:48] he didn't run with ragemen.
[25:52] But in that prodal son's mind, he was so
[25:56] he had a servant's mentality
[25:59] &gt;&gt; and he was missing the father's love
[26:03] and he could only see that he was not
[26:06] worthy.
[26:08] And I think we as human beings is one of
[26:11] our great struggles of the day is seeing
[26:14] our worthiness.
[26:16] And and uh especially as men,
[26:21] we as men, we are groomed and raised
[26:26] from birth to base who we are on what we
[26:30] can do.
[26:33] Nine times out of the 10 when we meet
[26:36] somebody, we want to know, well, what do
[26:37] you do?
[26:40] &gt;&gt; And and if somebody has a simple job,
[26:43] well, they get placed on a lower rung.
[26:50] And we may not even intentionally mean
[26:53] to do it,
[26:54] &gt;&gt; but it's it's the society in which we
[26:56] live in.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. that it's based upon your bank
[27:00] account and what you've done in life,
[27:04] what you've accomplished, what your
[27:06] worth is. And we as human beings and
[27:10] men, we we base value, conscious or
[27:14] unconscious, on what we do. And um um
[27:21] I think it's so important for us to be
[27:25] um mindful of these things in life
[27:29] because we can miss out on the light of
[27:31] a lot of life's opportunities
[27:34] by basing who we are on what we're
[27:36] worth.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz really uh brother Brennham said he's
[27:42] just a clot of Indiana dirt. Yeah.
[27:45] Right.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; And and you uh uh may have your chest
[27:52] pumped out this morning because the
[27:55] Buckeyes beat the Wolverines. And
[28:01] &gt;&gt; but remember, a Buckeye is just a
[28:04] worthless nut.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:16] So,
[28:18] but you know, brother Brandham tells us
[28:21] that uh when he's speaking of the
[28:24] prodal, he says uh we heard his voice
[28:28] and we cried out as did the prodical
[28:30] son. Save me, oh my father. I I am
[28:33] returning to thee. A son can go a long
[28:37] time before he recognizes that he is a
[28:39] son. In fact, a lot of true Christians
[28:42] are like the story of the baby eagle
[28:44] that was hatched out under a hen. You
[28:46] know, that eagle is a type of the true
[28:48] believer.
[28:50] And so, we can go a long time in life
[28:52] before we finally recognize who we truly
[28:54] are.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; And we can get past all of the facads
[28:57] that we put on. And you know, no matter
[29:00] whether you was in this message, born in
[29:02] it, you may have been born with a
[29:04] message silver spoon or you may have
[29:06] come off the streets. But still in the
[29:09] eyes of God, uh uh uh we're all the
[29:12] same.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[29:15] &gt;&gt; And you know, uh brother Brandham tells
[29:17] us, he says, "God leads his people
[29:19] through great trials to purge them. And
[29:22] sometimes it takes years to do it.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Years to do it." And as for myself
[29:30] tonight, I believe that right now, God
[29:32] is training such men to meet the front
[29:34] line. Men are going to be at times shook
[29:38] from their feet. Sometimes look like the
[29:40] whole thing's falling. And yet in the
[29:42] midst of all they know that living God
[29:45] and keep their face forward, keep moving
[29:48] on.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; And you know I I I I think of the great
[29:52] dilemma that we are in today of of
[29:55] wanting our father's approval as as that
[30:00] uh prodal son wanted. He he didn't feel
[30:03] worthy of his father's approval. And
[30:06] many times we as human beings, we uh I
[30:10] think all of us, if we would be honest
[30:12] enough, uh uh sometime some of us right
[30:14] now are still seeking our father's
[30:16] approval. And I'm speaking of your
[30:19] earthly one right now. And and we as
[30:22] men, if we would be honest with
[30:24] ourselves, sometimes we search our whole
[30:27] life just longing to hear daddy say,
[30:30] "I'm proud of you."
[30:36] And I I'd say this to all of you
[30:38] fathers. If you haven't said that to
[30:41] your children in a while,
[30:45] you need to be m mindful of the longing
[30:48] that's in your child's heart right now.
[30:53] Because when we raise children, you
[30:56] know, we have to raise our children like
[30:58] God raises us.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. with with unconditional love.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; And too many times we bl we we we put
[31:08] too many conditions on our children that
[31:12] when you attain to this or you have to
[31:15] do this and and it it it it's really
[31:18] quite traumatizing to a child, believe
[31:22] it or not, to put conditions on them.
[31:25] You ought to love your child just
[31:28] because they're your child.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; And that may seem real simple in a in
[31:35] the house of God,
[31:38] but remember that. Write it down and
[31:41] apply it.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow morning.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Apply it when they get that F on their
[31:47] grade.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Apply it when they're not on the honor
[31:52] roll.
[31:56] apply it when they don't want to go to
[31:58] college.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; See, because we have to God God loves us
[32:11] unconditionally.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; That's the unconditional covenant of
[32:15] grace that God does not put
[32:17] stipulations. God so loved us that he
[32:20] gave.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; And we as human beings have to be
[32:25] mindful that we have to apply that same
[32:29] principle on our everyday lives that we
[32:32] love unconditionally.
[32:34] It's not based on what they are or what
[32:37] they're going to be. It's just because
[32:39] they're mine.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; And because God gave them to me.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; That's enough.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. You don't have to do
[32:49] anything
[32:50] &gt;&gt; to earn my love.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; It's always going to be there.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; But you may say, "But that's not how I
[33:02] was raised, Brother Gabe."
[33:05] And that's your battle. Yeah.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Because
[33:10] we'll go through life and and and we'll
[33:13] realize so many times in life that we
[33:16] done it wrong,
[33:18] &gt;&gt; we didn't raise them the right way.
[33:21] though they was in a message church and
[33:23] though they was at every youth meeting
[33:26] and though they was at every Wednesday
[33:28] service and and though we had family
[33:32] devotions but there was still things in
[33:34] our life that we missed.
[33:40] But
[33:44] the battle brother,
[33:47] the battle, dad,
[33:49] is to be able to go and say, "I done it
[33:53] wrong."
[34:00] See, because it's it's it's it's when
[34:02] we're in our private life.
[34:06] It's when we're all alone
[34:11] that we can go to our
[34:14] children and say, "I done it wrong
[34:19] and I'm sorry."
[34:21] You know, sometimes we don't realize the
[34:25] value of just a simple I'm sorry
[34:29] because all that child wants is to hear
[34:33] the approval
[34:35] that look
[34:40] and and you know we we we don't re we
[34:42] don't see the value of being able to
[34:45] apologize and repent to our children
[34:47] because what you're actually doing is
[34:49] you're making the gospel real.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Because they see that a grown human
[34:57] being is applying what the Bible says.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; And I've and I've found in my own life
[35:08] that it it holds so much weight
[35:11] &gt;&gt; to be able to repent. Yes.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; You you know you know brother Brandham
[35:17] longed for his father's approval.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; So much so that when when he was with
[35:26] one of his daddy's friends and this man
[35:29] really loved brother Brandham. The the
[35:31] man loved brother Brandham so well that
[35:33] he was going to let him borrow his boat
[35:35] to go down and I think it was duck
[35:37] hunting or something. And but that man
[35:40] whipped out a whisk a flask of whiskey
[35:42] one day and and and brother Brandham
[35:46] would look at that whiskey flask and he
[35:48] says I remember the next time my father
[35:50] offered me a drink I told him I told him
[35:54] he he said I I I was assisting because
[35:56] he didn't he didn't take it. I took the
[35:59] bottle and I started to take it and
[36:00] while I was standing there I started to
[36:02] drink it. I heard something and brother
[36:05] Bram talks about the whirlwind and he
[36:08] says if it would have been me I would
[36:11] have drank it
[36:13] &gt;&gt; but it was God protecting his gift
[36:16] &gt;&gt; that had been born.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now this is brother Brandham
[36:23] wanted his father's approval.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; So much so that even though the voice of
[36:30] God told him, don't you ever drink or
[36:33] smoke or defile your body in any way,
[36:36] there'll be a work for you to do. He
[36:38] didn't just tell him once, but he had TO
[36:40] KEEP GOING BACK TO HIM OVER AND OVER AND
[36:44] OVER AGAIN
[36:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT LITTLE BOY WANTED HIS
[36:50] FATHER'S APPROVAL.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; THAT TRAUMA
[36:56] ON HIS LIFE WAS SO STRONG
[37:01] &gt;&gt; THAT IT WOULD HAUNT HIM HIS WHOLE LIFE.
[37:10] You you you think it was there was a
[37:14] reason why he would want to become a
[37:16] boxer when he when he got older
[37:20] &gt;&gt; cuz he couldn't drink or smoke or defile
[37:23] his body in any way.
[37:26] But but there would be a work for him to
[37:28] do. But while he was running from that
[37:31] work, he had to be a tough guy.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[37:36] He would go out west and then want to
[37:39] what? Become a rider.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; HE COULDN'T AFFORD THE THE STIR ALL THE
[37:47] THE CHAPS AND ALL THAT. SO, HE HAD TO
[37:49] SETTLE FOR A PAIR OF LEVIS'S,
[37:53] but he realized he wasn't a rider.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; HE REALIZED ONE DAY HE WASN'T A BOXER.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; He was going to be a soldier for God.
[38:08] He he would he WOULD COME TO A PLACE IN
[38:10] HIS LIFE THAT THAT SAME TEMPTATION WOULD
[38:13] COME UNTO HIM AGAIN
[38:16] WHEN HIS LITTLE ANGEL WOULD PULL OUT A
[38:18] cigarette
[38:20] and offer it to him.
[38:23] AND HE WAS DETERMINED
[38:27] &gt;&gt; to smoke that cigarette.
[38:30] He said just as determined as he is to
[38:32] preach the gospel that morning.
[38:38] BUT THERE WAS THAT SAME WHIRLWIND THAT
[38:41] WOULD COME WHIRLING,
[38:44] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[38:46] AND IT WOULD BREAK HIM IN SUCH A WAY
[38:49] BECAUSE THIS LITTLE ANGEL
[38:52] WOULD CALL him a
[38:55] &gt;&gt; AND THAT THAT THAT WORD WOULD HAVE SUCH
[38:58] AN IMPACT ON HIM THAT IT WOULD CUT HIM
[39:01] TO HIS CORE.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; AND HE WOULD GO WALKING DOWN THE ROAD
[39:08] WITH THEM WITH THEIR LIGHTS ON MAKING
[39:10] FUN OF HIM.
[39:13] and he WOULD GO TO GOD AND SAY, "LORD, I
[39:15] JUST want to die."
[39:19] That was the first time he mentions
[39:22] wanting to die the death.
[39:25] AND THAT WAS NOT JUST THE FIRST AND
[39:28] ONLY,
[39:30] but it WOULD COME IN WAVES ALL
[39:32] THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE,
[39:35] &gt;&gt; WISHING THAT THIS WORLD WOULD PASS FROM
[39:38] HIM.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE TRAUMA
[39:44] WAS SO INTENSE.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; AND THE AMAZING THING IS
[39:52] HE WOULD SAY GOD IS PROTECTING
[39:55] &gt;&gt; THE GIFT.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD PROTECT THE GIFT,
[40:03] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WOULDN'T PROTECT THE HEART OF A
[40:07] LITTLE BOY.
[40:21] God would protect
[40:23] the gift
[40:25] for you and I.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; But God would not protect
[40:32] the heart of that little boy.
[40:46] There would come a time
[40:49] where there would be such heartbreak
[40:53] that he would be on that telephone pole
[40:58] and see the shape of that cross
[41:02] and want the life to leave his body.
[41:06] So much so that he would pull off his
[41:08] gloves and start to reach for that power
[41:12] line that would send tens of thousands
[41:19] of volts electricity and break every
[41:21] bone in his body.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; But something happened.
[41:28] Amen.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; God would protect the gift,
[41:38] &gt;&gt; but he didn't
[41:43] protect his heart.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Bear with me. Yeah.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Uh yeah, it it'll take a minute for you
[41:57] to me just marinate on it.
[42:04] Brother Baron says, "The thing of it is
[42:06] it's in my own nature. I love to listen.
[42:09] I like to help everyone that I can. In
[42:11] doing so, I let my nature get in the way
[42:14] from God.
[42:16] Don't you see? My will of things is not
[42:18] always God's will of things. And people
[42:21] will ask me to do things and I love
[42:23] people.
[42:24] As I've always told you before, at one
[42:26] time I didn't have many friends because
[42:28] I was considered amongst the people that
[42:30] I was a
[42:34] a grown man,
[42:36] but the trauma
[42:39] still comes out.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "I didn't have many friends,
[42:44] but since I come out and found God's
[42:46] people, he's given me up in the millions
[42:48] of friends. and love them so well to
[42:50] that I just do anything for them. You
[42:52] know, I want you to see I want you to
[42:55] see
[42:57] the extremes
[42:59] that that God when brother Brandon
[43:01] preaches God hiding in simplicity. He
[43:04] goes, "I couldn't I couldn't get anyone
[43:07] to talk to me. Nobody cared for me. And
[43:10] now I have to hide to get a little
[43:12] rest." And now the Lord has given us
[43:15] this grace place and the great things
[43:17] that he's done. AND HE'S GIVEN ME BESIDE
[43:19] A BAD NAME, HE GAVE ME A NAME LIKENED TO
[43:23] SOME OF THE GREAT MEN.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; TO ME,
[43:27] IT'S THE GREATEST PROPHET.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; YES.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; THAT STRUCK THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; OUTSIDE OF OUR LORD.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; YES.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Gabe, you're awful
[43:39] full of him." I am cuz God sent him to
[43:42] me.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:48] I am Malachi 4.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Hey, brother brother Chad can say he's
[43:58] Revelation 10:8.
[44:00] I CAN SAY I'M MALACHI 4.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; HUH?
[44:08] &gt;&gt; COME ON, BROTHER.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; HELLO. YOU SAY, "BROTHER GABE, YOU
[44:14] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD,
[44:16] &gt;&gt; I
[44:18] &gt;&gt; sin, brother Gabe,
[44:21] &gt;&gt; will you marry and RANDOM BEFORE THE
[44:23] COMING OF THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF
[44:25] THE LORD?
[44:27] &gt;&gt; YOU READ YOUR NAME IN THERE
[44:29] &gt;&gt; AND WE'LL FIGHT IT OUT IN THE
[44:30] VESTIBULE."
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Jeremy, uh, Brother John, if you
[44:35] just
[44:38] a little officiating there, brother
[44:42] I don't want to be sevenfooters. I just
[44:46] give me a little one. One of you little
[44:47] ones.
[44:51] But brother Brown said he gave ME A NAME
[44:54] LIKE some of the great MEN AND HE'S
[44:57] CALLED OFF MY ENEMIES WHEREVER I WENT.
[45:00] THERE'S NEVER BEEN NOTHING STAND BEFORE
[45:02] IT WHEREVER IT WENT. AND HOW GRATEFUL I
[45:04] AM FOR THAT. AND HOW WOULD I EVER KNOW
[45:07] AS A LITTLE RAGGED KID UP HERE TWO OR
[45:10] THREE BLOCKS FROM WHERE THE INGRAM
[45:12] SCHOOL WHEN I WAS A LAUGHING STOCK OF
[45:15] THE SCHOOL FROM BEING SO RAGGED
[45:18] AND SKATE ON THE OLD POND? HOW DID I
[45:20] EVER KNOW THAT DOWN BENEATH THAT POND
[45:22] WAS A SEED OF A LILY THAT COULD BLOOM
[45:26] LIKE THIS? AND HOW DID I EVER KNOW THAT
[45:29] NO ONE TALKED TO ME YET HE WOULD GIVE ME
[45:32] A NAME THAT WOULD be honored amongst his
[45:34] people?
[45:36] &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD GOD PUT HIM ON WHY WOULD GOD
[45:39] PROTECT THE GIFT
[45:41] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT PROTECT THE LITTLE BOY?
[45:44] &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD HE PUT HIM ON SUCH EXTREMES OF
[45:48] HIGHS AND LOWS?
[45:54] Brother Brandon would say this.
[46:01] I had some scars when I was a kid.
[46:04] I know things that happened that's kind
[46:07] of turned me that way.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; But it was all God making
[46:13] and molding me.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:16] for this hour.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; He had to have a man
[46:24] &gt;&gt; that would have just the right thing.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; The right kind of thing that when he
[46:30] spoke whether you was on the lowest of
[46:33] the low or the highest of high you would
[46:36] could relate to him.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; He would be relatable.
[46:40] Look, you
[46:44] &gt;&gt; ex My wife just told me this morning on
[46:46] the way to work, experience
[46:48] is the greatest teacher.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; It is.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; You You look Look,
[46:53] &gt;&gt; we can look, we can read this all we
[46:56] want to.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; But you got to experience it. Amen.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; See,
[47:08] we may think some of those things was to
[47:11] hurt us, but it's really to mold us and
[47:14] shape us. Yes.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; To be rugged Christians.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Not hot bed plants that have to be pity
[47:21] pattied around and patted on the back
[47:24] with predestination and soft
[47:27] &gt;&gt; cupcake, but rugged
[47:30] &gt;&gt; rugged.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram tells us, he says,
[47:40] "We only have to go through those
[47:42] schools of sufferings.
[47:45] to know how the other fella feels.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; You say God would put him through all of
[47:50] that. Absolutely.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; But because he had you on his mind.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; See, if if I'm in a valley,
[48:05] I want somebody to come to me in that
[48:08] valley that's been in that valley before
[48:10] me.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; And in order for you to come to me when
[48:14] I'm in that valley, you had to go to
[48:17] that valley first.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz I had to be able to see you in that
[48:22] valley and out of the valley
[48:25] &gt;&gt; and then come back down into the valley
[48:27] and show me how to get out of the
[48:29] valley.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; There's all for God's purpose. God takes
[48:34] the black things that are in our life
[48:36] and he makes them crystal clear white.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; You you look at the prophet of God. This
[48:40] is This picture is so amazing to me. I
[48:44] want you to look right smack dab in the
[48:47] middle is Malachi 4.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; And if you look to Brother Brandham's
[48:51] right side, that big tall man is Oral
[48:54] Roberts.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; So you have two out of the three angels.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Right.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; But this is what I love about it.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Look at that.
[49:11] right there.
[49:14] That makes me love him so much more
[49:18] &gt;&gt; because look, think about this. This
[49:21] right here,
[49:24] that's Malachi 4.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; That's Revelation 10:7 1-7.
[49:31] That's
[49:33] &gt;&gt; right.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30.
[49:36] This is this is the man that held the
[49:39] king's sword.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; This is the man that that that that had
[49:44] a supernatural uh pillar of fire follow
[49:47] him his whole life.
[49:49] And we would think WE WOULD BE WOWED AT
[49:51] THAT. YOU you would see pictures where
[49:54] he's GOT THE LICK OF FIRE on his
[49:55] shoulder and he he would be the one that
[49:58] God would use to loose the book of
[50:00] redemption.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; But when he would stand before
[50:13] He would get on his tippy toes.
[50:16] He would try to make himself.
[50:22] I I don't know. To me,
[50:25] to me, I love that
[50:29] because he just wanted to fit in.
[50:33] a man that would stand against the world
[50:38] &gt;&gt; and all the denominational ideas
[50:42] that would come against
[50:44] God's word.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; But yet there was a still a measure of
[50:50] frailty in that prophet of God.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; And and to me God would allow that to
[50:58] get taken and captured. Now, some people
[51:01] may look at that and mock it. To me, I
[51:04] look at that picture and I cherish it
[51:07] because what I see, I see me.
[51:13] See, none of us want to be vulnerable.
[51:17] But what I've learned in life, your
[51:19] vulnerability is really power.
[51:24] It's when we try to be something that
[51:26] we're not
[51:28] &gt;&gt; part
[51:31] when when we're trying to be something
[51:33] that we're not. We're not making
[51:36] ourselves vulnerable.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; But I I I didn't come I did, by God's
[51:41] grace, I did not come this far to play
[51:43] church,
[51:44] &gt;&gt; nor am I going to start.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; I want to be real. And and and to me,
[51:50] the thing of it is is we have to be
[51:53] honest enough with what's inside of us.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Like if there's something wrong, I want
[52:01] it to come out in the church.
[52:03] I want one of you to speak in tongues
[52:06] and say, "Thus sayeth the Lord," on the
[52:08] fifth row, that big fat man back there
[52:14] &gt;&gt; and rebuke me if you have to
[52:17] &gt;&gt; cuz I want to be right.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Like like TO ME, YOU SAID, "OH, NO,
[52:23] THAT'D BE BAD. THAT'D BE ON THE
[52:24] INTERWEB." AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT NO
[52:26] ARCHIVES.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; I want
[52:31] amen.
[52:32] Amen.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I don't want to miss
[52:35] heaven.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; I want to hear say I want to hear well
[52:39] done
[52:40] &gt;&gt; thou good and faithful servant.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; I gave you just a little bit but you was
[52:46] faithful with that little bit I gave
[52:47] you. Right. Right.
[52:50] See, whatever is in us there, there's
[52:53] there there's a story
[52:55] there's a story
[52:58] about a a wise teacher
[53:01] when he was sitting down
[53:04] teaching his students one day and he
[53:07] asked him the question,
[53:09] "If someone bumped into you and spilled
[53:12] your cup of coffee,
[53:15] why did you spill the coffee?
[53:21] And I want you to answer that question
[53:22] in your mind. Why did you spill the
[53:25] coffee?
[53:27] And and the teacher listened to the
[53:30] students response and they said,
[53:31] "Because someone bumped me."
[53:35] And the wise teacher said, "No,
[53:41] because you had coffee in your cup."
[53:47] That is what you were carrying.
[53:50] If you had tea in your cup, that tea
[53:53] would have spilled out. See, whatever
[53:55] was in you, whatever was in that cup was
[54:00] going to spill out.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; And life is the is the same way is WHEN
[54:06] WE GET SHAKEN UP IN LIFE,
[54:08] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IS INSIDE OF US IS GOING TO
[54:11] SPILL OUT.
[54:13] IF THERE'S IF THERE'S HATE AND ENVY AND
[54:16] ANGER, WHEN YOU GET BUMPED, it's going
[54:18] to come out.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; WE WORRY ABOUT THE BUMP. IT'S NOT THE
[54:24] BUMP THAT REALLY MATTERS.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; SEE THE BUMP? THE BUMP. Anybody know
[54:30] what a trigger is?
[54:33] &gt;&gt; See, see, we got triggers in life,
[54:36] &gt;&gt; right, sir?
[54:38] &gt;&gt; And we try so hard in life. We try so
[54:42] hard in life to encapsulate late ourself
[54:46] so nobody touches our trigger
[54:58] &gt;&gt; right
[55:00] &gt;&gt; see we got we got there's internal
[55:03] triggers
[55:05] emotional distresses
[55:08] losses in control feeling vulnerable
[55:11] There's external triggers of going to
[55:13] certain places and
[55:15] &gt;&gt; you know, oh my, the Thanksgiving
[55:17] season,
[55:20] &gt;&gt; THE HOLIDAY SE THERE'S ENVIRONMENTAL
[55:23] TRIGGERS.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE THERE'S ALL THESE TRIGGERS
[55:26] AROUND US,
[55:28] &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S NOT THE TRIGGER THAT WE HAVE
[55:31] TO WORRY ABOUT.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE QUESTION IS IS WHAT IS BEHIND
[55:35] THAT TRIGGER?
[55:38] WHAT IS BEHIND YOUR TRIGGER?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; THEY MAY HAVE PUSHED A BUTTON, BUT WHY
[55:43] DID YOU GO OFF?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; THE TRIGGER TRIGGERED YOU. YES. BUT THAT
[55:52] IS NOT THE POINT.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT'S BEHIND THE TRIGGER.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[56:05] If there was no ammunition,
[56:08] &gt;&gt; there would be no explosion.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; See, it's it's it's is
[56:16] it's when we get triggered.
[56:19] It's when we it's when they touch that
[56:22] soft spot,
[56:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:27] &gt;&gt; And when we
[56:33] It's when we have,
[56:37] you know, so many times, no, nobody
[56:39] nobody wants to be vulnerable.
[56:43] And we spend so much of our time
[56:45] protecting ourselves,
[56:48] guarding our emotions, and trying to be
[56:52] oh so pious. And
[56:58] &gt;&gt; but why
[57:04] See,
[57:11] cuz the thing of it is
[57:13] there's some things that are seen
[57:18] and there's some things that's unseen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; There's some things that's obvious
[57:22] triggers,
[57:24] but there's some things that don't you
[57:26] don't even recognize as triggering you.
[57:30] And we live our lives in such a way
[57:32] because we're trying to protect those
[57:35] triggers in our life.
[57:37] You know, we we we're in the holiday
[57:40] season,
[57:43] and I I don't know about you, but I I
[57:47] have a I have a real struggle
[57:50] during the holidays.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Because there's so many
[58:00] expectations.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:04] I I uh I I I I'll be honest with you. I
[58:08] I struggle with Christmas gifts.
[58:11] Not because of the message theology
[58:14] that's came out. And
[58:18] well, you can't even say Merry Christmas
[58:20] without somebody else communicating.
[58:22] Yeah.
[58:29] But but to me
[58:33] like I don't want to give you a gift
[58:35] unless I can give you a gift.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; From your heart.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Preacher says
[58:42] &gt;&gt; that's exactly right.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Yeahise. See, I I don't I And and so and
[58:48] so to me, I struggle
[58:51] and I found out that no matter how hard
[58:55] I tried to make a happy home around the
[58:58] holidays, there's an atmosphere in my
[59:01] home of sadness.
[59:06] And I've tried so hard to not pass on
[59:09] the traumas of my childhood,
[59:12] but it it it it hurts me that every year
[59:15] I see those same traumas in a shadow in
[59:17] my children.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; See, because unconsciously,
[59:24] no matter how hard you try,
[59:29] there's unseen traumas.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. See,
[59:33] &gt;&gt; there's all that baggage that you carry
[59:36] around
[59:37] &gt;&gt; whether you want to or not
[59:43] &gt;&gt; because we get caught up in the to-do
[59:45] list and you know the the I mean I mean
[59:49] you think about it even so much so that
[59:51] that that the sun doesn't shine
[59:55] and because we we go from the outside to
[59:57] the inside and we don't get that vitamin
[1:00:00] D that we need. Right.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Right. Some of us are more more uh uh
[1:00:05] sensitive than others
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; and and we we have deaths that happen
[1:00:11] and regrets and losses and past
[1:00:15] experiences that happen, financial
[1:00:18] stress cuz we got a big family and
[1:00:20] everybody does this and they had this
[1:00:23] and
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; well and they gave me a gift and so I
[1:00:30] got to get Right?
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; And why is that?
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; It's insecurity.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; It's insecurity.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because you don't want
[1:00:42] somebody to do for you cuz you don't
[1:00:44] feel worthy.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; And because you don't feel worthy, you
[1:00:50] have to overcompensate and give back.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; And and if you would check, if you would
[1:00:57] try that, it goes back. Listen, you
[1:01:00] young brothers, I know I keep preaching
[1:01:02] to you and I hope you're taking notes.
[1:01:04] You young brothers that's getting
[1:01:05] married and gotten b getting babies and
[1:01:08] listen, you have to be mindful. The most
[1:01:11] critical time of your child's life is
[1:01:13] from zero to 8, 10, 12 years old and and
[1:01:17] that's going to be the time where you're
[1:01:18] going to check out because you don't
[1:01:20] think it's important because mom's going
[1:01:21] to take care of it, your wife. But that
[1:01:23] is you'll miss the greatest times
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; because that's ex Oh my s preach. That's
[1:01:31] exactly right. You can't get it back.
[1:01:33] That's exactly right.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; No matter how Listen, I had to talk to
[1:01:38] my children this morning.
[1:01:40] And I had to tell him, look,
[1:01:44] you know, I
[1:01:47] look, you know, there was a season in my
[1:01:51] life where I went through about seven
[1:01:53] years of depression.
[1:01:57] And it was a very dark time for me. But,
[1:02:00] you know, from my first two, they they
[1:02:02] had made it to about to about five, six
[1:02:06] years old to where they got some some
[1:02:10] quality time with dad. But my little
[1:02:13] baby, she was growing up during the
[1:02:16] darkest hour of my depression.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; And so there was there was opp missed
[1:02:22] opportunities,
[1:02:24] right?
[1:02:30] And there's lots of regrets.
[1:02:34] But see, I don't say this for sermon
[1:02:37] feel. I say this because it's on my
[1:02:40] heart to say.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; But but what I had to do, I had to go
[1:02:45] back to her and repent.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; And the reason why I did is because 10
[1:02:51] years down the road, she may be in a
[1:02:53] struggle. And that little bit of
[1:02:55] information I gave her this morning may
[1:02:58] be the exact thing that she needs to get
[1:03:00] her through that dark hour.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; But it takes humility to be able to do
[1:03:07] that.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; You have to admit, I missed the mark.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; I did wrong.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; And I am sorry.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; That means you have to humble yourself.
[1:03:22] YOU HAVE TO LOOK. WE always talk ABOUT
[1:03:24] HEADSHIP. WELL, BEAT THE HEAD THEN.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; BEAT THE HEAD THEN.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; You have to be able to humble yourself.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; See, I messed up.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; But I would much rather do that
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; and give her the ammunition she's going
[1:03:44] to need
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; because she may have a trigger one day.
[1:03:48] And because daddy did that when she was
[1:03:51] 13 years old, it helped her to go
[1:03:54] through her teenage years
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; to realize there there's a there's a
[1:03:58] void in my life because when I was 6 7 8
[1:04:01] years old, dad was checked out in a lot
[1:04:03] of areas. And because dad wasn't where
[1:04:06] he was supposed to be, maybe that's why
[1:04:08] I'm dealing with what I'm dealing with.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE NOT. BUT I WANT TO
[1:04:13] cover every base
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; cuz when I stand before God on that day
[1:04:18] and I stand before you all, I want to
[1:04:20] know that I've done everything in my
[1:04:22] power to be right before God.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Listen brothers, look, I I I I tell you
[1:04:31] because you know we we we want so much
[1:04:36] for we want approval. It is a very
[1:04:40] fundamental
[1:04:41] part of our being as human beings to
[1:04:44] want approved.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; You brothers, some of you brothers will
[1:04:49] will will work 60, 70, 80 hours and it's
[1:04:53] not about the paycheck.
[1:04:57] What you're really clocking in for is
[1:05:00] the ghost of approval past.
[1:05:12] It's why we'll spend our whole lives
[1:05:15] working and working and grinding and
[1:05:18] grinding
[1:05:20] and we miss
[1:05:23] we miss
[1:05:24] our time with our families and our
[1:05:27] children. It's because the ghost
[1:05:31] of approval passed.
[1:05:38] There's men that have built kingdoms
[1:05:42] and at the end of their lives they would
[1:05:45] look back and say, "I've been looking
[1:05:47] for my father's approval
[1:05:59] where I started thinking about this
[1:06:02] because I had to look at my own life
[1:06:06] and I realized
[1:06:08] that
[1:06:10] I
[1:06:11] I've spent
[1:06:13] there's been such a void in my heart
[1:06:18] because I always wanted my daddy to say
[1:06:20] I'm proud of you.
[1:06:29] And sometimes that longing, that's why I
[1:06:32] say, "Dad, if I I hope you're looking
[1:06:35] through your rolodex of life
[1:06:38] and I hope you don't just say, "Yeah,
[1:06:40] when they did this and they won and they
[1:06:41] scored, I said, I'm proud of you. Shame
[1:06:44] on you."
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying, yes. Shame on you.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, my dad, I don't listen.
[1:06:53] You you turn a corner.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; You do something different
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; because your child is longing
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; to hear those words.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; I'm proud of you.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Just for being
[1:07:11] you.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Not because you did anything. Not
[1:07:16] because you got an A. Not because you
[1:07:18] sang a song special. Not blah blah blah.
[1:07:23] I'm just proud of you.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; And if we don't say that,
[1:07:31] we're missing the opportunity
[1:07:34] to build a character and a confidence
[1:07:37] and a courage on the inside of her
[1:07:40] children.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; And you know what? You'll never get it
[1:07:43] back.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Because those are foundational building
[1:07:48] blocks
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; that they need. A child needs to feel
[1:07:52] accepted
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; just for being
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; them.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, yeah, cuz God
[1:08:04] accepted you when you was unlovable.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; When you was an enemy of God,
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; he he he didn't save you when you was at
[1:08:16] your best.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; He saved you when you was at your
[1:08:18] lowest." Hallelujah.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; The Bible says when we were enemies of
[1:08:21] God in our mind,
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; when when when we were unlovable,
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; that's when he said, "Clickup. I'm going
[1:08:28] to die for them."
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; And if we don't have Look, look, and you
[1:08:38] say, "Well, Brother Gabe, my daddy
[1:08:39] didn't I I know your daddy didn't tell
[1:08:42] you that, and that's why you struggle
[1:08:45] with saying it now."
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:08:48] And you may be sitting there with gray
[1:08:50] hair and stooped shoulders. I get it.
[1:08:53] Listen, I'm at 51 years old. I'm not as
[1:08:55] old, but I still feel it.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; And and we will struggle through life.
[1:09:03] Look, when brother Chad, remember
[1:09:05] brother Chad preached, I think it was
[1:09:06] Wednesday, remember when when when
[1:09:08] nobody in heaven and earth was worthy.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Why would God do that? Why would God say
[1:09:15] at the end OF IT ALL, NOBODY IN HEAVEN
[1:09:17] AND EARTH WAS WORTHY TO TAKE THE BOOK,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; NOR YOU COULDN'T EVEN LOOK ON THE BOOK?
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD GO TO THE VERY FUNDAMENTAL,
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; THE VERY CORE OF HUMAN BEINGS OF LACK
[1:09:31] AND WANT AND WORTH AND ACCEPTANCE. AND
[1:09:34] HE WOULD LET EVERY ONE OF US KNOW,
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; EVERYONE THAT STRUGGLES WITH THE COMPLEX
[1:09:39] OF I'M NOT WORTHY. I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE GRINDING AND GRINDING AND
[1:09:46] LOOKING AT THE BANK ACCOUNT AND LOOKING
[1:09:48] AT THE CAR AND BLAH BLAH BLAH
[1:09:51] TRYING TO FILL THE VOID.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD LOOK AT YOU AND ME
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; AND HE WOULD LET US KNOW NO one
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; was worthy.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] because we would have to be reminded
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; over and over
[1:10:11] in the darkest hour.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Nobody was.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; We We listen. WE TALK ABOUT BROTHER
[1:10:18] BRANDHAM AND WE PUT HIM ON A PEDESTAL.
[1:10:20] MAN, HE DIDN'T DRINK OR SMOKE AT THE
[1:10:22] FOUNTAIN. WOW.
[1:10:27] OKAY.
[1:10:29] WELL, what about
[1:10:31] when them boys beat him to pieces and
[1:10:34] called him a Kentucky squab? And what
[1:10:36] did brother Bam do? HE WENT STRAIGHT
[1:10:39] HOME, GOT HIS 22 RIFLE.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "OH YEAH, COLINE, HERE I COME."
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; BEFORE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS WAS POPULAR,
[1:10:53] BROTHER BRANDON WOULD HAVE BEEN A
[1:10:54] TRAILBLAZER. OH YEAH.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; HE JUMPED OFF THE HILL AND HE SAID,
[1:10:58] "WHICH ONE OF YOU WANT TO DIE FIRST?"
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; AND HE WASN'T THREATENING. HE WAS NOT
[1:11:04] BLUFFING.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; BROTHER B SAID HE USED TO GET SO MAD HE
[1:11:08] WOULD LAUGH.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE LAUGHED LIKE AN IDIOT.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; TEMPER,
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:11:24] So even
[1:11:26] my prophet
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; that God sent me
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; wasn't worthy.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; He wasn't worthy.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; No one
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; was worthy.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; And we have to be mindful
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; our worthiness. And you know what? We
[1:11:49] can say it and I I guarantee it'll fall
[1:11:51] flat because we're like, "Yeah, I know
[1:11:52] that, brother Gabe." Our worthiness
[1:11:56] does not matter.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; I want you to say amen Tuesday
[1:12:02] afternoon.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz we can say amen in the house of God
[1:12:06] when we feeling good. Right.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:09] But it's but it's when we're on the
[1:12:11] battlefield
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; AND EVERYTHING'S FALLING APART
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; and and and and your your your your
[1:12:19] COWORKER PULLS UP IN A 2025
[1:12:23] OR THEY GET THE PROMOTION AND YOU DON'T
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; RIGHT OR YOU LO YOU SAY, "OH YEAH,
[1:12:30] BROTHER GAB, WE'RE YEAH WORTHINESS."
[1:12:32] OKAY, LOSE YOUR JOB MONDAY MORNING.
[1:12:34] YEAH.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; UH LOSE YOUR JOB AND WHAT HAPPENS? WE
[1:12:40] AUTOMATICALLY LOSE OUR IDENTITY.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; WE LOSE OUR IDENTITY
[1:12:48] BECAUSE OF WHAT? OUR WORTH. YEAH,
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; because we put our identity and who we
[1:13:00] are and what we are and our position and
[1:13:02] I'm under archives.
[1:13:12] Better get THAT OLD PRIDEFUL SPIRIT OFF
[1:13:14] OF YOU.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; HUH?
[1:13:24] SEE, it's when we lose everything.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; It's when we lose everything
[1:13:33] and it all falls apart. It wasn't the
[1:13:35] fact that we had to lose. It wasn't that
[1:13:38] God had to have that happen,
[1:13:42] but it's because we put too much stock
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; in what we are. Yeah,
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; we put too much stock in what we know.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; The reason why we ain't a good testimony
[1:13:56] on a workplace is we're we're too busy
[1:13:59] uh uh uh downplaying the Baptist because
[1:14:01] we got more revelation than them
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; OR THE PENTECOSTAL CUZ WE GOT THE
[1:14:07] PROPHET.
[1:14:10] OH, come

[1:14:23] STORM, FOLK.

[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; HEY, IF YOU HAVE IT, YOU MAY BE SITTING
[1:14:35] IN IT RIGHT NOW.
[1:14:46] RIGHT.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; WHY?
[1:14:52] Cuz we want approval.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; We want to be the best.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Because it's the society
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; that we live in.
[1:15:06] Whoever comes up last in the race does
[1:15:09] not get a prize.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Well, lady will see it now. It's, you
[1:15:13] know,
[1:15:15] participation trophy.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; But but
[1:15:27] y'all know that's true.
[1:15:30] But
[1:15:31] but but
[1:15:33] it but but whoever wins, THEY GET THE
[1:15:36] BIGGEST PRIZE AND THE BIGGEST TROPHY AND
[1:15:40] THEY GET THE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL and
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; right
[1:15:50] is this okay?
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:52] We
[1:15:54] we live in this society,
[1:15:58] this the season that we live in, you
[1:16:01] know,
[1:16:03] we deal with the holiday blues of
[1:16:06] isolation,
[1:16:09] lost loved ones,
[1:16:11] and and we get so
[1:16:16] sometimes we we ain't mindful
[1:16:19] of the quality times.
[1:16:22] And
[1:16:24] you know, sometimes we get so busy.
[1:16:28] You just you pray for me cuz I I I don't
[1:16:30] want to go.
[1:16:32] I'm already almost an hour.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; So So
[1:16:43] I I I want to ask you a question.
[1:16:48] If you found out that your child was
[1:16:50] bullied
[1:16:52] and they suffered
[1:16:55] and didn't talk to you,
[1:16:58] how would you explain it?
[1:17:07] And if in your mind you said, "Well, I
[1:17:10] would feel horrible." That's not what I
[1:17:12] asked you.
[1:17:14] If your child was bullied
[1:17:18] and they suffered
[1:17:20] and they didn't talk to you, how would
[1:17:23] you explain that?
[1:17:28] See, because the trauma
[1:17:30] didn't start at being bullied.
[1:17:36] The trauma started
[1:17:39] is because they didn't feel safe enough
[1:17:41] to open enough
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; to come to you and talk to you about it.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. That's the truth.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Please don't let that go over your head.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; And don't don't ignore that cuz that's
[1:17:56] not a quote.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz the trauma started
[1:18:03] before they were bullied.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; It's because they didn't feel safe
[1:18:11] enough
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; at home.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; They didn't feel open enough
[1:18:19] at home.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; To talk to you
[1:18:24] about it.
[1:18:34] It's because
[1:18:36] they didn't feel accepted.
[1:18:41] They didn't feel worthy.
[1:18:46] There wasn't that open
[1:18:49] line of communication.
[1:18:56] See, when brother Brenham says make a
[1:18:58] home a happy home,
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; it's making it an unconditional home
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; that I'm going to love you whether you
[1:19:13] serve God or not. That's right.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to love you if you become the
[1:19:21] worst person in the world.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Daddy will still be there.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; But if we're worried about how we'll
[1:19:33] look,
[1:19:38] we'll miss the opportunity to create an
[1:19:41] open channel.
[1:19:48] Do y'all believe that?
[1:19:52] See,
[1:19:54] when
[1:20:03] the Lord Jesus
[1:20:09] before he goes to the Gethsemane and his
[1:20:12] prayer to the father in St. John chapter
[1:20:15] 17,
[1:20:18] not only did
[1:20:23] He says, "These words spake Jesus and
[1:20:25] lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,
[1:20:27] 'Father,
[1:20:29] the hour is come.
[1:20:32] Glorify thy son
[1:20:34] that thy son may also glorify thee."
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; What was it? He wanted to make father
[1:20:46] proud.
[1:20:51] Even the Lord Jesus,
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; he wasn't just worried about the son
[1:20:57] being glorified, but he said that the
[1:20:59] son also may glorify thee.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; In other words, that I could that I
[1:21:05] would be accepted that
[1:21:09] there was a mutual thing he wanted. It
[1:21:11] wasn't just that he would be glorified,
[1:21:14] but the son would be glorified in him.
[1:21:18] That's right.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:21:21] when the Lord Jesus was on earth, he was
[1:21:24] very particular
[1:21:26] about even in the Old Testament in
[1:21:30] Exodus 22, he says, "Ye shall not
[1:21:33] afflict any widow or fatherless child.
[1:21:37] If thou afflict them in any wise," watch
[1:21:39] what? Watch how God was so protective of
[1:21:43] a child that didn't have a father's
[1:21:47] protection.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Not just not just a child, but a widow.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; He would say, "Thou shalt not afflict
[1:21:56] any widow or fatherless child. If thou
[1:21:59] afflict them in any wise, and they shall
[1:22:02] cry out unto me, look, cry at all."
[1:22:08] Even
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; God is so particular. He says, "If they
[1:22:12] say the least little thing,
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; he says, I will surely hear their cry
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; AND MY WRATH
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; SHALL WAX HOT
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; AND I WILL KILL YOU WITH THE SWORD."
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; GOD'S TALKING TO HIS ELECT RIGHT HERE.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "IF YOU DO, IF YOU TOUCH A
[1:22:40] HAIR ON THEIR HEAD,
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; MY WRATH
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; IS COMING DOWN."
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; He says, "AND YOUR WIVES SHALL BE widows
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; and your children fatherless.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET ME
[1:22:58] see you lay hands."
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Bec- because God listen, God knows that
[1:23:05] if there's a child that don't have a
[1:23:07] daddy,
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; there's going to be lacking in that
[1:23:09] child.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; That it's not that child's fault.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; AND GOD REALIZES THAT. AND SO GOD TELLS
[1:23:17] HIS PEOPLE, "THOSE PEOPLE GET EXTRA
[1:23:21] SPECIAL CARE
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD KNOWS THAT THERE'S GOING TO
[1:23:26] BE VOIDS IN THOSE PEOPLE'S lives
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; that's not their fault."
[1:23:33] Yeah,
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; that's good.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Look, he says this even in the New
[1:23:42] Testament.
[1:23:45] He says pure religion and undefiled
[1:23:48] before God is the father is this to
[1:23:51] visit the fatherless and the widows and
[1:23:55] their affliction and to keep himself
[1:23:58] unspotted
[1:24:00] from the world. That visit is just not
[1:24:03] go see him every once in a while, but it
[1:24:05] actually means to look after
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; to to look upon in order to help or
[1:24:11] benefit, to look after, to care for,
[1:24:13] provide for.
[1:24:16] So God is telling us that if there if
[1:24:19] there's a child that's lacking
[1:24:22] fatherhood
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; and the dad is not there, we as the
[1:24:26] people of God
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; are called to fill that void. That's
[1:24:31] right.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Because there's things that's going to
[1:24:39] be in that child that they're going to
[1:24:41] deal with that your children won't deal
[1:24:44] with. Right.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; When the widows when they don't have
[1:24:53] their husband, that means, you know, it
[1:24:56] it's not just so much, but it really, if
[1:24:58] you think about it, they're not going to
[1:24:59] have that headship in the home.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; They're not going to have that shoulder
[1:25:05] to lean upon
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; there. You know, you know, look, I I'm
[1:25:08] going to say I look, do you know I hope
[1:25:12] you understand when I say it like this.
[1:25:15] Do you know
[1:25:18] cuddling
[1:25:19] is super important?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about you brothers
[1:25:24] cut. You understand what I'm saying?
[1:25:28] But I'm trying to show you that we need
[1:25:31] as human beings, we need physical
[1:25:34] contact.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:25:38] And you sisters, I should have hold a a
[1:25:41] whole lot more estrogen than that. Just
[1:25:42] a couple of you.
[1:25:45] I ought to see some elbows. Like
[1:25:55] cuddles release good feel-good hormones
[1:25:58] like oxytocin and serotonin, which
[1:26:01] reduces stress and anxiety while
[1:26:03] boosting mood and sleep quality. calms
[1:26:06] the nervous system, decreases cortisol
[1:26:08] to stress homing and promotes feelings
[1:26:10] of safety and security. It can also
[1:26:13] improve immune function, lower blood
[1:26:15] pressure and heart rate.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Gabe.
[1:26:25] Blink three times for amen.
[1:26:31] It's okay. We'll get the deacons to
[1:26:33] defend you. Come on, sis. You
[1:26:37] Right.
[1:26:40] Cuz listen, I'm saying this for you
[1:26:42] young brothers, too. You said, "Bro, I'm
[1:26:43] a man." All right. Well, be a man and
[1:26:45] hug your wife.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Listen, cuz we need it. And so when
[1:26:53] God's saying, "Visit
[1:26:56] the widow and the fatherless."
[1:27:00] Why? Cuz he needs your hands.
[1:27:04] Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; He don't need your money.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; He don't need you to put an extra 20 in
[1:27:10] in the in the offering basket. What he
[1:27:14] needs is your feet.
[1:27:16] What he needs is your heart. What he
[1:27:19] needs is your hands. So that you sisters
[1:27:23] put your arm around that widow.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Be mindful. Listen, widows need physical
[1:27:30] touch.
[1:27:35] That's my mama right there.
[1:27:38] Right. Right.
[1:27:40] That's right. Yes. They look the
[1:27:44] fatherless child,
[1:27:48] they need
[1:27:51] to feel that arm go. Look, you brothers,
[1:27:54] they need to feel that. They need to
[1:27:57] know that somebody
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; cares for them.
[1:28:03] Because whose hands is he going to have
[1:28:07] to use but your hands?
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Whose heart is he going to have to feel
[1:28:15] through?
[1:28:16] Lest it be your heart. Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; You know, we we we we
[1:28:25] go through
[1:28:28] emotions
[1:28:30] and sometimes we may not necessarily
[1:28:34] know why we feel the way that we do and
[1:28:37] why that we act the way that we act.
[1:28:40] But you know, this is what I love when
[1:28:43] when you deal with a situation.
[1:28:45] I love this picture because a lot of
[1:28:48] times when we have a situation in life,
[1:28:50] we'll look at just this little itty
[1:28:52] bitty confrontation or right interaction
[1:28:55] between you and somebody else.
[1:28:58] But I want you to understand, you may be
[1:29:00] you may be able to have scripture and
[1:29:02] verse why they're wrong.
[1:29:05] And God will wink at that situation and
[1:29:08] you'll be condemning God because he
[1:29:10] winked at that situation.
[1:29:14] Amen.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; And what you failed to see,
[1:29:19] God sees
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; what we cannot.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; See, God sees a panoramic.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; And too many times we have tunnel vision
[1:29:31] because we got the quote, we got the
[1:29:33] scripture and lock, stock, and bear it.
[1:29:35] They're done, finished, blah, blah,
[1:29:36] blah. And we're dead wrong
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; because God is able. He understands.
[1:29:44] He's able to see the intricacies.
[1:29:48] He's able to see the family strains.
[1:29:51] He's able to see the birth order. He's
[1:29:54] able to see the name was Elvis and it
[1:29:56] shouldn't be.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Elvis,
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS RAT.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; YEAH. BROTHER BANNER SAID UH UH I if if
[1:30:09] YOUR IF YOUR CHILD IS NAMED RICKY, HE
[1:30:12] SAYS FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES, CHANGE HIS
[1:30:13] NAME.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; He said IF YOU IF YOU CHANGE HIS NAME,
[1:30:17] WATCH HIS NATURE CHANGE.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; I you know when I some when somebody at
[1:30:25] work or somebody tells me, "Oh yeah, we
[1:30:26] we had a baby blah." I said, "What'd you
[1:30:28] name it?" And they'll tell me and I
[1:30:30] always always say, "What does that
[1:30:32] mean?" And I would say 95% of the time,
[1:30:35] maybe 100%. They'll say, "I don't know."
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:30:45] Because the name has meaning to it,
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; right? And so the thing of it is is is
[1:30:52] you got to understand when we deal with
[1:30:54] a situation, there is a whole bunch of
[1:30:58] variables in the background.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Right. like on a computer system, all
[1:31:04] this stuff running in the background
[1:31:06] that you don't see. You're looking at
[1:31:08] the screen, but you don't see what's
[1:31:10] going on in the background.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; But God does, THANKFULLY.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE GOD UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S GOING
[1:31:16] ON IN THE BACKGROUND, HE CAN WORK
[1:31:18] EVERYTHING OUT FOR HIS GLORY.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. is Lord.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; See, he says this in in Psalms 139:1. OH
[1:31:29] LORD, THOU HAS SEARCHED ME AND KNOWN ME.
[1:31:34] THOU KNOWEST MY DOWN SITTING AND MINE
[1:31:37] UPRISES. THOU UNDERSTANDEST MY THOUGHT.
[1:31:42] That's purpose or aim.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; THOU UNDERSTANDEST MY PURPOSE. MY
[1:31:47] THOUGHT, MY aim are FAR OFF. THOU
[1:31:49] COMPASSES MY PATH AND MY LYING DOWN AND
[1:31:54] acquainted with all of MY WAYS.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, IF GOD CALLED YOU, HE
[1:32:01] KNEW you was going to be in the mess
[1:32:03] that you're in today.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; But he already KNEW WHEN HE CALLED YOU,
[1:32:08] YOU WAS GOING TO BE IN THIS MESS THAT
[1:32:10] you're in right now.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; AND YOU FEEL THERE'S NO WAY. THERE'S
[1:32:13] COULDN'T HAVE BEEN, SHOULD HAVE BEEN,
[1:32:15] COULDN'T HAVE HAD BEEN.
[1:32:21] But the Bible says that he knoweth
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; he knoweth that we are but dust.
[1:32:30] You know when you look at a man
[1:32:35] behind every man who fights to give
[1:32:37] everything to his children
[1:32:40] is a boy who wishes someone fought as
[1:32:42] hard for him.
[1:32:53] But if you didn't go through what you
[1:32:54] went through,
[1:32:57] do you hear what I said? You went
[1:32:59] through.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; It didn't stop you.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; You went through it.
[1:33:06] What you went through, you went through.
[1:33:10] But if you didn't go through it, you
[1:33:12] wouldn't have the love in your heart
[1:33:13] that you have. That's right.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't give the way that you
[1:33:18] give
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; because we have to go through the
[1:33:21] schools of suffering
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; to know how the other fella feels.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going to try to close if that's
[1:33:32] okay.
[1:33:34] You know, too many times in life,
[1:33:38] we look at the situation and brother
[1:33:39] Brandham says, "In the beginning, God
[1:33:41] has created you to be the master of
[1:33:43] every circumstance."
[1:33:45] That's the origin. That's authentic.
[1:33:48] That's God's word. There was nothing
[1:33:50] nothing could happen unless you was the
[1:33:52] master of it. That's what you were
[1:33:56] created for.
[1:34:00] So, so what we need to realize is God's
[1:34:04] not playing checkers.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; God's playing three-dimensional chess.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; And too many time we have a checkerboard
[1:34:17] mentality
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; and we don't realize the span that God
[1:34:21] is dealing in. And he don't real you
[1:34:23] don't realize the pieces that he's
[1:34:25] moving
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; to make your purpose come to pass in
[1:34:29] your life.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; See when we too many times when we talk
[1:34:34] about sin you know sin what does sin
[1:34:37] mean? Sin means to miss the path
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; to miss the goal to miss the mark. And
[1:34:44] when we talk about sin, we look at
[1:34:49] something outwardly that we're doing or
[1:34:52] somebody's doing. But really, sin is
[1:34:55] unbelief.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; And if we're not believing God's word,
[1:35:02] that is sin.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; And look, here's the thing.
[1:35:11] You fill in the blank.
[1:35:18] cuz only you know.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about a checklist
[1:35:25] of, you know, long hair, no makeup.
[1:35:29] I don't, you know, I don't have no
[1:35:32] Facebook. I don't watch movies. I don't
[1:35:36] It's not what I'm talking about, right?
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; It's not what I'm talking about. I'm
[1:35:40] talking about sin.
[1:35:43] Because we can because we're looking for
[1:35:46] approval.
[1:35:48] We can just do the checklist of approval
[1:35:50] like we're earning God's approval by the
[1:35:53] things we're not doing.
[1:35:59] Is it really about that?
[1:36:02] No.
[1:36:04] But how many years did we spend trying
[1:36:08] to earn God's approval by the things we
[1:36:11] stop doing?
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; How many times did we kick out the
[1:36:17] television?
[1:36:20] I used to keep a receipt. I'd keep the
[1:36:21] receipt.
[1:36:26] You
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; True story.
[1:36:29] Hey, I KICK OUT THE TELEVISION just to
[1:36:31] bring it back in.
[1:36:40] how carnal it was. No doubt God had to
[1:36:43] look down from heaven just like
[1:36:46] bless his heart.
[1:36:52] Right. But you know
[1:36:56] it wasn't God. It was the fact because
[1:37:00] I've always wanted the approval.
[1:37:04] I spent so many years trying to find and
[1:37:08] earn the approval,
[1:37:11] the approval of my mom, the approval of
[1:37:14] my dad,
[1:37:16] the approval of others.
[1:37:19] And we can get so caught up that we
[1:37:21] miss.
[1:37:25] He's the one that made you worthy.
[1:37:27] That's it. Is that the truth?
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; And if we would, you know, if you think
[1:37:33] about it,
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; what does justification mean? When God
[1:37:39] justifies you, he says you never done it
[1:37:42] in the first place.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Okay. Think about what God does. He
[1:37:49] tells you that before he even cleans you
[1:37:51] up through sanctification,
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; right? and then even to the baptism of
[1:37:56] the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; So at the very fundamental purpose when
[1:38:01] God picks you up out of the hog pin and
[1:38:03] you're filthy and undone, he wants you
[1:38:06] to understand, listen, before we go any
[1:38:09] further.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; You're like, "Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't
[1:38:12] worry. No, don't worry about the tele."
[1:38:14] No, no. Before we go any further,
[1:38:17] listen. I want you to God, he wants you
[1:38:18] to understand this.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; You've never done it in the first place.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. what I'm doing. No,
[1:38:23] no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Stop. Stop. Don't worry about this. This
[1:38:28] right here,
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; God wants you. Cuz the moment that you
[1:38:32] go, I never done it in the first place.
[1:38:34] No, no, no. That goes all back on Satan.
[1:38:36] It does. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it does.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he wants you to understand,
[1:38:43] be
[1:38:45] at rest.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Because he realizes there's going to be
[1:38:51] a lot of children that come through the
[1:38:54] eons of time.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; That didn't have the approval of their
[1:39:00] earthly father.
[1:39:03] And because they didn't have listen you
[1:39:05] brothers that pour in the love and I'm
[1:39:07] proud of you and you can do it and you
[1:39:10] don't understand what you're doing for
[1:39:12] your children to help them to be cou
[1:39:15] courageous courageous and
[1:39:18] but you if you haven't done that you
[1:39:21] don't know the detriment that you're
[1:39:23] putting them under and you'll never hear
[1:39:26] them say it.
[1:39:29] You know, I you will never hear me. You
[1:39:32] will never hear me come to my daddy. I
[1:39:35] hope he never hears this. You'll please
[1:39:37] if you know him, please don't get send
[1:39:39] this out. You You'll never hear me come
[1:39:42] to dad and say, "Dad, I want you to tell
[1:39:45] me you're proud of me.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:53] I'm 51 years old and for 51 years I've
[1:39:57] longed to hear those words.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; But you will never hear me.
[1:40:06] Ask him that.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz the pain goes too
[1:40:12] deep.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; I don't want to ask him. I want him to
[1:40:19] tell me.
[1:40:26] And I say this not for Larry Joe, but I
[1:40:30] say this for your children
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; because there's still hope for you.
[1:40:36] But you know it's going to take
[1:40:39] you humbling yourself like I did to that
[1:40:41] little girl this morning. And you're
[1:40:44] going to have to set them down. You have
[1:40:45] to have some pride and go, you know
[1:40:46] what? God had to rake me over the coals
[1:40:49] this morning.
[1:40:52] And I'm guilty.
[1:40:55] I don't tell you I'm proud of you like I
[1:40:59] should.
[1:41:04] And it's going to take
[1:41:06] humility. I may be talking to one
[1:41:09] brother, but that one brother is enough
[1:41:11] for me to say this.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; I don't care how you was raised. That
[1:41:17] does not matter. It we don't just keep
[1:41:20] passing it down.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; But at some point in time, it has to
[1:41:24] stop
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; and you have to say it's going to stop
[1:41:29] in my home.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Today's the day
[1:41:34] I'm going to have to eat some humble pie
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to have to say, "Oh man,
[1:41:41] is it easy?" No. If it was, every daddy
[1:41:44] would do it.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; But if you're a real dad,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; not just the father,
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; but if you're a real dad, you'll repent.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; And you'll say,
[1:42:01] "I'm sorry."
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; You know, it's it's it's it's two simple
[1:42:06] words,
[1:42:08] but they're so hard to say.
[1:42:14] But when you say it,
[1:42:16] it brings release.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; When you say it, it brings healing.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; When you say it, it opens up the door.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; When you say it, it makes them feel
[1:42:33] safe.
[1:42:36] When you say it, it makes them feel
[1:42:38] welcome.
[1:42:41] When you say it, it makes them feel at
[1:42:44] home.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Can we stand together?
[1:43:03] I I know this was a little different
[1:43:05] this morning
[1:43:07] and uh
[1:43:11] I hope that uh
[1:43:16] it uh
[1:43:18] gives you food for thought this morning.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:26] is the musicians they come.
[1:43:31] You know
[1:43:34] in St. John 14
[1:43:37] the Lord Jesus says I will not leave you
[1:43:41] fatherless.
[1:43:45] That's comfortless.
[1:43:47] He said, 'I will come to you
[1:43:50] yet a little while and the world seeth
[1:43:52] me no more, but you'll see me because I
[1:43:56] live, ye shall live also
[1:43:59] at that day. And brother Brandham takes
[1:44:02] this scripture and says this day,
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; At that day, ye shall know that I am in
[1:44:07] my father, ye in me, and I in you.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; And so God's mindful
[1:44:17] of the fatherless.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; If you just play something soft, sis,
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; I don't know
[1:44:30] where everybody's at.
[1:44:33] Maybe maybe this is just for one person.
[1:44:40] I I don't know.
[1:44:43] But I
[1:44:45] I I hope that
[1:44:52] you
[1:44:54] do some soularching
[1:44:59] and
[1:45:01] you may be one of the top five dads in
[1:45:04] the world.
[1:45:08] Praise the Lord. I'm striving with you.
[1:45:12] But there's always areas in our life
[1:45:14] where we can improve.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; There was only one. And listen, and I
[1:45:20] say this, Dad, let me let me not just I
[1:45:23] hope this ain't condemning dads and
[1:45:25] making you feel bad. That's not my
[1:45:26] intention. Because listen, if you was a
[1:45:29] perfect father, they wouldn't need the
[1:45:32] heavenly one,
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:45:38] And so we're all God's not going to
[1:45:39] share his glory with no man.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; And we all have shortcomings and we all
[1:45:46] have baggage and we all have things that
[1:45:49] we're unconsciously doing and we're all
[1:45:52] things that we've left undone and we we
[1:45:54] don't want to address and we don't want
[1:45:56] to look at and we kick the can down the
[1:45:58] road. And
[1:46:02] all of us in some shape or form have
[1:46:04] fallen short. That's right. And I I'm
[1:46:08] not here to condemn you,
[1:46:11] but my heart is to see the heartache of
[1:46:15] children be healed.
[1:46:19] I know the wounds that I carry in my own
[1:46:22] heart,
[1:46:26] but I don't want to see them go to
[1:46:29] another generation.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; I I want them to stop with me.
[1:46:39] And I'm sure that that's your heart's
[1:46:41] cry, too.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; We as daddies, we make mistakes
[1:46:47] and we do things wrong and we get things
[1:46:50] wrong.
[1:46:52] But God made a way for us to repent.
[1:46:57] And I look out in the congregation and
[1:46:59] see these young brothers and little
[1:47:00] babies. And
[1:47:03] I tell you, I
[1:47:05] I've been uh
[1:47:09] been sitting in my chair and and uh I'm
[1:47:12] only 51 years old, but sometimes I feel
[1:47:14] like I'm 80.
[1:47:17] And I look and it's like, you know, a
[1:47:19] couple days ago the girls was out in the
[1:47:22] out gone and it was just Susan in the
[1:47:24] home and and my girls are quiet. They're
[1:47:27] real quiet even at home while sometimes.
[1:47:29] But
[1:47:32] But when they're home, I can just feel
[1:47:34] that they're home
[1:47:36] and I know they're home. Even though I
[1:47:39] don't hear them, I just know it. And and
[1:47:41] the house just felt different. And I
[1:47:43] thought, man, one day they're going to
[1:47:46] be gone
[1:47:49] and they're going to be going to their
[1:47:50] own homes and they're going to dad's
[1:47:53] going to be knocking on the door and
[1:47:54] they be like, "Sh, look away."
[1:47:59] I'm like, "Woohoo!
[1:48:03] I see your car in the garage."
[1:48:13] And you know, they they they grow up
[1:48:15] fast.
[1:48:18] And I I see you young brothers and you
[1:48:20] got them babies in your arms. Hold them
[1:48:23] tight.
[1:48:26] and love all of them with all you got.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's a real small window.
[1:48:36] And when that window closes, you'll
[1:48:38] realize all the missed opportunities.
[1:48:43] And
[1:48:46] I just pray that you listen to what
[1:48:48] brother Gabe's trying to tell you
[1:48:51] cuz I speak from experience.
[1:48:56] But you're the the new generation
[1:49:01] and you're the daddies that can be super
[1:49:04] daddies.
[1:49:08] And if you don't get anything from
[1:49:10] anything that I've said this morning
[1:49:12] outside of make sure you tell your
[1:49:14] children you're proud of them
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; because that prodal son was a grown man
[1:49:24] and even though his daddy ran after him,
[1:49:28] he still saw himself as a servant.
[1:49:33] You know, I wonder how many sleepless
[1:49:35] nights that daddy had,
[1:49:38] the regrets that daddy had.
[1:49:43] How many times did he look back and go,
[1:49:45] "Man, I should have done that. I should
[1:49:48] have done this."
[1:49:56] No wonder he ran after him.
[1:49:59] No wonder.
[1:50:04] And when that prodical son said, "I'm
[1:50:06] I'm no I sin against heaven and earth
[1:50:08] and I'm I'm I'm I'm not worthy. Just let
[1:50:11] me be a son." He never even acknowledged
[1:50:15] what his son said.
[1:50:19] He didn't even acknowledge it.
[1:50:22] He just put a robe on him and a ring on
[1:50:24] him and
[1:50:26] changed the atmosphere.
[1:50:30] And he said, "Let's rejoice and be merry
[1:50:34] cuz my son which was lost
[1:50:37] is now found."
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; You know, he found another opportunity
[1:50:44] to rekindle the relationship
[1:50:47] that was lost.
[1:50:50] And I would encourage every one of us,
[1:50:52] the lost relationships that we have,
[1:50:55] maybe we ought to rekindle them.
[1:50:59] I'm sure there's some souls that we need
[1:51:01] to run after, too.
[1:51:04] Cuz God needs our feet.
[1:51:07] He needs our heart.
[1:51:11] And there's souls out there that's
[1:51:13] longing just
[1:51:16] for the approval
[1:51:18] of someone else.
[1:51:22] Let's bow our heads.
[1:51:28] And as we bow,
[1:51:33] maybe you
[1:51:35] slip a hand up,
[1:51:39] ask the Lord to
[1:51:42] be your helper.
[1:51:45] I
[1:51:47] listen this and that. I I I
[1:51:50] stand in the same place as you do
[1:51:54] and I I hope I
[1:51:58] delivered this thought in a balanced
[1:52:01] way.
[1:52:02] Ask your forgiveness if I didn't.
[1:52:07] But I'm speaking to you as a dad,
[1:52:12] but I'm also speaking to you as a son.
[1:52:18] And I know,
[1:52:21] and you know what, Dad? If you would
[1:52:22] look in your heart,
[1:52:25] I know you see what I'm talking about,
[1:52:28] cuz you're a son, too.
[1:52:36] But you and I as daddies and sons,
[1:52:41] we can bow our heads to a heavenly
[1:52:43] father.
[1:52:46] and we can ask him that
[1:52:49] he'd move on our behalf.
[1:52:55] Let's pray together.
[1:52:59] Precious Lord,
[1:53:03] it's a solemn
[1:53:07] moment in our life
[1:53:10] and
[1:53:14] words fall short
[1:53:18] to express
[1:53:20] the feelings of our heart.
[1:53:25] We're truly a needy people.
[1:53:29] And we're so thankful that where sin did
[1:53:32] abound,
[1:53:34] grace did that much more abound.
[1:53:38] And so we're bowing our hearts to you,
[1:53:40] Lord, and asking for grace,
[1:53:45] asking for a heavenly touch
[1:53:49] in our lives,
[1:53:51] in our homes,
[1:53:54] on our families,
[1:53:56] our loved ones.
[1:53:59] Lord, we
[1:54:02] see the frailty of our beings,
[1:54:06] the inadequacies of our lives, and
[1:54:13] but Lord, I I'm grateful that you
[1:54:17] called us just the same.
[1:54:21] And Lord, we truly want to hear one day
[1:54:25] well done.
[1:54:28] And uh I pray for my brothers, my
[1:54:31] sisters,
[1:54:34] those
[1:54:36] in that holiday season of blues and
[1:54:42] the heartaches that the holidays bring,
[1:54:45] the regrets and
[1:54:49] missed opportunities,
[1:54:52] Lord, are so many.
[1:54:57] But
[1:54:58] through it all, Lord, we want to
[1:55:02] take it in stride,
[1:55:05] search our lives and
[1:55:09] overturn every stone and
[1:55:13] every pebble.
[1:55:16] Lord, we want to stand before your whole
[1:55:17] one day.
[1:55:20] Not a spot on the garment.
[1:55:24] And we're needing, Lord, with so many
[1:55:28] voices in this world, we're needing
[1:55:33] a finely tuned ear to be able to hear
[1:55:35] your word and
[1:55:38] see our thought, our aim, our purpose.
[1:55:41] That's for us.
[1:55:43] Realizing that we are
[1:55:46] but dust.
[1:55:49] We're bowing our heads from to the dust
[1:55:53] from which we've came and
[1:55:57] asking that you would
[1:56:00] pour out yourself upon us,
[1:56:03] Lord, in the refreshing of your Holy
[1:56:05] Spirit.
[1:56:07] If we've become cold and indifferent and
[1:56:11] distant in our homes,
[1:56:16] if the ghost of approval past is still
[1:56:20] haunting us, Lord, I pray that today
[1:56:23] would be the day that the those ghosts
[1:56:27] are silenced.
[1:56:31] Lord,
[1:56:34] those that are in need, pray and in
[1:56:38] agree and prayer touching this one
[1:56:41] thing,
[1:56:43] asking that you would move it. Lord, we
[1:56:47] just want to
[1:56:50] grow in a deeper relationship with you
[1:56:52] and our brothers and sisters, our
[1:56:56] families.
[1:56:57] Lord, we want to be your hands. We want
[1:57:00] to be your feet. We want to be your
[1:57:03] eyes. And we truly want to be your
[1:57:05] heart.
[1:57:08] And I pray that Lord as we
[1:57:13] are living in Satan's Eden and the
[1:57:16] greatest battle ever fought
[1:57:19] is in the mind and you see the invisible
[1:57:23] wars that are raging in each soul,
[1:57:26] each being Lord that's here in this
[1:57:29] assembly.
[1:57:31] And I pray that your great Holy Spirit
[1:57:33] would be the ammunition that they need
[1:57:37] to fight against the ws of the enemy.
[1:57:42] We commit ourselves into your hands. I
[1:57:45] commit them to you
[1:57:47] and ask Lord for leadership,
[1:57:50] direction, and guidance as only you can.
[1:57:54] And we'll be careful to give you all
[1:57:56] praise and glory.
[1:57:59] We ask these things to be so
[1:58:02] in the name that's above every name, our
[1:58:05] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:58:08] Amen.
[1:58:10] Amen.
[1:58:13] All hearts are free.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise the Lord.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this. What's that song you
[1:58:19] singing there?
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go ahead, brother.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; I have a father.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't you happy for that?
[1:58:29] He calls me his own.
[1:58:36] He'll never
[1:58:38] leave me.
[1:58:42] No matter
[1:58:44] where I go.
[1:58:50] And he knows my name.
[1:58:58] He knows my one prayer, every thought.
[1:59:04] He sees each fear that falls
[1:59:10] and he hears thee when I call.
[1:59:18] Oh, I have a maker.
[1:59:26] Before
[1:59:27] my heart,
[1:59:32] before
[1:59:34] even time beame,
[1:59:38] my life was in his hand.
[1:59:46] And he knows my name.
[1:59:53] He knows my every thought.
[2:00:00] He sees each year that calls
[2:00:06] and he hears me when I call.
[2:00:14] Oh, I have a father.
[2:00:21] He calls me his own.
[2:00:28] He'll never
[2:00:30] leave me.
[2:00:33] No matter
[2:00:35] where I go,
[2:00:41] he knows my name.
[2:00:48] He knows my every thought.
[2:00:55] He sees each
[2:00:59] call
[2:01:00] and he hears me when I go.
[2:01:07] And oh, I know the time is near where
[2:01:12] everything that I hold dear will lay
[2:01:16] before the holy
[2:01:19] consuming
[2:01:21] fire.
[2:01:23] All my works and all my deeds, every
[2:01:28] prayer set on my knees lay before the
[2:01:32] holy
[2:01:34] consuming
[2:01:36] fire.
[2:01:38] And all I want to see is Jesus.
[2:01:45] All I want to see is him in me.
[2:01:52] All I want to see is Jesus
[2:01:59] shineing
[2:02:02] through me.
[2:02:06] Oh, and selfinflicted
[2:02:08] pain. Everything that I thought gain
[2:02:13] will lay before the holy
[2:02:17] suming
[2:02:18] fire.
[2:02:20] Words of knowledge in his name. Healing
[2:02:24] hands that touch the lame will lay
[2:02:28] before the holy
[2:02:31] suming
[2:02:32] fire.
[2:02:34] And all I want to see is Jesus.
[2:02:41] All I want to see is him in me.
[2:02:48] And all I want to see is Jesus
[2:02:55] shineing
[2:02:58] through me.
[2:03:01] And hear him say,
[2:03:05] "Well done."
[2:03:08] My praise
[2:03:12] shine.
[2:03:15] Well done.
[2:03:19] Well done,
[2:03:22] my faithful
[2:03:26] one.
[2:03:30] And all I want to see is Jesus.
[2:03:37] All I want to see
[2:03:40] is him in me.
[2:03:43] And all I want to see is Jesus
[2:03:50] shineing
[2:03:53] through me
[2:03:56] in shady
[2:03:58] green pastures so rich and so sweet.
[2:04:06] God leads his dear children
[2:04:11] along.
[2:04:16] Where the waterers
[2:04:19] flow bays the weery
[2:04:23] ones see.
[2:04:26] God leads his dear children
[2:04:31] alone.
[2:04:36] Some through the waterers,
[2:04:42] some through the blood,
[2:04:47] some through the fire,
[2:04:51] but all through the blood.
[2:04:57] Some through great sorrow,
[2:05:01] but God gives a song
[2:05:07] in the night season
[2:05:12] and all the day long.
[2:05:17] Sometimes on the mount where the sun
[2:05:23] shines so bright,
[2:05:27] God leads his dear children
[2:05:32] along.
[2:05:37] Sometimes
[2:05:39] in the valley,
[2:05:42] the darkest
[2:05:44] of night,
[2:05:46] God leaves his dear children
[2:05:52] alone.
[2:05:57] Oh, some through the waters,
[2:06:03] some through the flood.
[2:06:08] Some through the fire,
[2:06:12] but all through the blood.
[2:06:18] Some through great sorrow,
[2:06:22] but God gives a song
[2:06:28] in the night season
[2:06:32] and all the day long.
[2:06:38] Those sorrows
[2:06:40] befall us and Satan
[2:06:46] oppose.
[2:06:48] God leads his dear children
[2:06:53] along.
[2:06:58] Through grace we can coner,
[2:07:03] defeat all our foes.
[2:07:08] God leads his dear children
[2:07:13] along.
[2:07:18] Oh, some through the water,
[2:07:23] some through the blood.
[2:07:29] Some through the fire,
[2:07:33] but all through the blood.
[2:07:39] Some through great sorrow.
[2:07:44] But God gives a song
[2:07:49] in the night season
[2:07:53] and all the day long.
[2:07:59] Away from the mire,
[2:08:04] away from the clay.
[2:08:08] God leads his dear children
[2:08:14] along
[2:08:19] away up in glory.
[2:08:24] Eternity
[2:08:26] day
[2:08:28] God leads his dear children
[2:08:33] alone.
[2:08:38] Oh, some through the waters,
[2:08:44] some through the flood,
[2:08:49] some through the fire,
[2:08:53] but all through the blood.
[2:08:59] Some through great sorrow.
[2:09:03] But God gives a song
[2:09:09] in the night season
[2:09:13] and all the day long.
