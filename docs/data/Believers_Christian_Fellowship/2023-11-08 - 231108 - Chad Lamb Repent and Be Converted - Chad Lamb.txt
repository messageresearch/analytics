things that you'd bless these things in all that we do in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you while we're standing let's take our Bibles and turn to Acts chapter 3 amen while you're turning I'll let you know brother Vernon and Sister Irene made it home safely they sent us a text this morning they made it back home and they thank everybody for your warm welcome and hospitality and we sure enjoyed the service this past Sunday man really learned a lot amen I'm going to read one scripture here out of Acts chapter 3 and I'd like to read from um verse 19 Acts 3: 19 says repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the time of ref refeshing shall come from the presence of the Lord amen God bless you as you have your seats amen I'd like to speak on a subject this evening of repent and be converted amen repent and be converted amen I I um I've been meditating on this and it's just keeps coming and coming over the last 2 three days I actually I sat down and I got some inspiration I started working on uh thought and I was jotting it down really fast and I thought I was going to go that direction and and this was part of it but uh as I sat down today more and more and more started coming and so like I say so many times I don't want to blow through it I'm going to slow down and I'm going to take just this part amen tonight amen we don't have any visitors coming that I know of for a while so I can take the services I I can take my time amen and uh we can take this over the next service or two however it comes but I want to talk about repent and be converted and the reason I want to go into this is because so many times we use terms and because we've grown up in Christian culture and around a Christian Society even if we didn't grow up in the message it was still in a Christian Society of sorts we use terms and I think uh uh from the abundance of use sometimes they lose meaning or the meaning gets muddled amen and so I don't want to I I don't want that to be the case I want to understand what it means to be repent and be converted because that's the Commandment that was given uh by Peter repent and be converted and so we're going to look at those terms and then we're going to look at the things that brother brandham taught and then we'll move from there let's go back now to Acts chapter 2 verse 37 this is the familiar inaugural address of the New Testament Church at the day of Pentecost and in Acts 2:37 he says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you sh shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost this is amazing uh this is a promise that's been given to us if we'll repent and be baptized everyone in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost brother brandham said if you truly repent and are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and do not receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it makes God a liar that's right so we just take him at his word and believe that God will honor his word if we truly repent and are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and then we shall receive and we just receive it as a gift from God and say God I'm open to receiving your gift and God will fulfill his word in our lives so when we talk about repent here when we look at this passage of scripture I I I've talked about this before but who is it's important to know that who is Peter addressing because Peter is not addressing prostitutes he's not addressing drug dealers he's not a a a addressing uh Roman centurions or Roman officials or Roman citizens or Greeks amen th this is the Feast of Pentecost and in the Feast of Pentecost The Devout Jews from all over the world and it lists here how many nations heard them speaking in their own tongues so we know that we have a record of Jews Gathering from all around the world and all these nations why are they coming back because they believe the word of God they believe what Moses taught amen they're they're coming back in obedience to what Moses had taught to the prophet that was before amen and they're coming back so these are these are good church members let's say they're not staying back in their country they're coming according to what was commanded in Moses they're returning back at the Feast of Pentecost because there was three times in the year that every male in Israel must report to Jerusalem to present himself before the Lord amen and it was the Feast of Passover the Feast of Pentecost and the uh Feast of Tabernacles right so now these the this group that were here amen when they Spilled Out Of The Upper Room amen speaking in tongues all these Jews heard them in their own language because they had gathered to the Feast of Pentecost because they were worshippers and Believers of the Bible amen so this is the ones who asked Peter what should we do and Peter says repent repent first repent and so when when when growing up all my life I used to think of repentance because I grew up in Pentecostal churches I thought repentance was uh saying I'm sorry for wrong Deeds but that's not exactly what repentance is that that's asking forgiveness and asking forgiveness is not the same as repentance right and so I I wrote this down so I wouldn't lose track of it I said uh asking forgiveness is to ask someone to release or pardon you for doing wrong that's to ask forgiveness so when I when I begin to express my remorse and regret for my wrong Deeds I'm asking God to forgive me amen I'm asking him to pardon me or to release me if I ask forgiveness from somebody else I'm asking them to pardon me or Release Me amen from doing a wrong deed amen but that's not what repentance is because this word repentance that's used here in Acts chapter 2 and then the first verse we opened with when he said repent ye therefore and be converted this word in the Greek means to change change one's mind to change one's mind and so you can see how repentance is different than asking for forgiveness because you can ask for forgiveness amen but you're just sorry for doing wrong but unless your mind changes you're going to repeat the offense but repentance is a changing of your thinking concerning the offense so so asking forgiveness is is uh saying you're sorry asking for a pardon or a release for wrongdoing but repentance is actually Ching changing your thinking about the wrongdoing and repentance actually prevents you from repeating because your whole understanding your whole thinking about it has changed so now he comes to uh on the day of Pentecost and now these devout Jews they stand up are they're there they're hearing them and and he's telling what must we do you must repent you've got to change what you think about God you've got to change your understanding you must repent amen you think this is false you think this is a cult you think this is some work up a man you've got to change all your thinking you didn't understand who Jesus was you didn't understand who John the Baptist was you didn't even understand really what Moses was [Music] teaching amen because what what began to prick their heart when their hearts were pricked what was their hearts pricked over because Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost and began connecting Old Testament scripture to Modern events I like I said before he was preaching modern events made clear by prophecy amen he kept saying what Joel said this is what you're seeing is what Joel said amen and this is what David said and this Resurrection was referred back to when David said he'll not leave my soul in Hell amen neither shall my Holy One see corruption he begins to tie all the Old Testament Promises to the present day amen what's he doing amen he's disrupting their whole understanding of what they knew about their religion what they knew about their faith and then their heart was pricked said what we do repent he wasn't say telling them stop drinking stop Mo smoking right stop the prostitution and Stop The Killing that wasn't what this repentance was this repentance was you've got to change your understanding you got to change your thinking we've been seeing this all wrong and then repent in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because if you change your understanding of who Christ was you can get baptized in his name right amen you can be baptized in his name and for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so you can see how brother bam said a true repentance is necessary for This Promise because you can see how um you can see how you could even baptize in the name of Jesus Christ but have the wrong understanding amen and not receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen because it takes repentance a change of mind and then baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift to the Holy Ghost this is the pattern this is the method so let's go to Acts chapter 8 Acts chapter 8 and I'm going to use two examples of the scripture to show you how repentance is is a change of mind acts 8:18 he says and when Simon saw that through laying on of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money saying give me also this power that on whomever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost but Peter saith unto him thy money perisheth with thee because thou H has thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money thou has neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee what was wrong with Simon Simon had the complete wrong understanding and he was he says the wickedness in your heart and repent that the wickedness in your heart may be forgiven he had the complete wrong understanding so let's go to the the next one then uh Acts chapter 17 Acts chapter 17 acts 17:22 said then Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said ye men of Athens I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious for as I passed by and beheld your devotions I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God whom therefore you ignorantly worship Him declare I unto you he's he's finding them in ignorant worship but now he's going to declare this one that they don't understand God that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshiped with men's hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell in all the face of the Earth and to determine the times before appointed in the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring for as much then as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that the God has his like under gold or silver or stone Graven with art and man's device see what's Paul doing Paul's starting to tear away all their understanding about God their idolatry and their multiple God worship and and making up setting up stones and statues and all of this to represent God he's talking about all that then he comes to verse 30 and the times of this ignorance God winked that but now commendeth all men everywhere to repent amen because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given Assurance unto all men and that he hath raised him from the dead Paul now coming to the Gentiles and Mars Hill amen the great place of philosophy and discussion and and they had so much uh talk and they had worship of multiple gods and they had idolatry and he begins to explain all this but he says amen you were ignorantly worshiping this uh unknown God I come to declare him to you amen because you don't have any understanding amen and ignorantly you began to worship with stones and man-made objects and all of these things he said which ignorance God winked at for a time but not anymore more now he's calling you to repentance now you have to change all your understanding whatever you thought you knew about God all the philosophy and all the understanding now that the message has come you have to repent from all of that and you have to believe the message that Paul is preaching that's right amen amen that's what Paul says he says I'll read 30 again in the times of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth men everywhere to repent God's not going to let it be okay anymore now the truth is coming amen you must repent from that and accept the truth amen because Heath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom ye hath ordained whereof Heath given Assurance unto all men that Heath raised him from the dead why do you have to repent because there's coming a judgment day am and now that the truth has come you're held accountable now you must repent am amen let's go to Acts 26 now Acts 26: 19 this is where we're going to get our first glimpse of be converted because we read the opening scripture says uh repent ye therefore and be converted so this is a commandment to repent and be converted right and so here we find this word in Acts 26: 19 whereupon oh king of grippa I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision but showed first unto them of Damascus and at Jerusalem and throughout all the coast of Judea and then to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God and do Works meet for repentance so this word repent is the word we've been talking about to change your mind this word turn is the same word that's used converted almost everywhere else in the Bible so repent and be converted or turn to God Amen and so we're going to look at this even more specifically because brother Bram gives us more information and and so does the bible uh brother Frank if you could pull up the Whiteboard I'm going to go to the whiteboard in just a minute go to John chap 12 with me while we turn I forgot to tell you to keep your Bibles handy we're going to go through a lot of scriptures but I think you figured that out by now I haven't given you a chance to put them down John chap 12 John chap 12 and let's go to verse 39 John 12:39 therefore they could not believe because that Isaiah said again Heath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and I should heal them so you can see how under understanding leads to conversion amen right let's read again so we understand because you're to repent and be converted repent means to change your thinking so he he's telling us that their eyes were blinded and their understanding darkened so that they could not convert so that they could not repent and they could not be converted so I read it again he has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted so if they would see with their eyes and understand with their heart then they would be converted so if they were able to repent they could be converted yeah amen you can see how even in Repentance it's going to take a revelation from God because you're not going to be able to change your own thinking unless God gives a revelation so it's going to take a work of God even to bring you to repentance and if God gives you eyes to see and ears to hear and a heart to understand then you have the ability to repent to change your understanding and to be converted Hallelujah I like that so I'm going to write down these words just so we have them right out of the Greek repent the concordance says to change one's mind and then to convert or to be converted to turn to now this is an interesting word to turn to in the in the scripture that we read before in Acts that they would be uh repent and turned to God this word that is is translated converted the one that we're going to be using uh that this Greek word is not just to turn not like a random turning like you just turn any direction you want but it's actually a specific turning it's turning to a position or turning to a destination and I'm going to explore more of that but it's very very specific because there's another word that's just a turn you can just turn this way you can turn that way but this word is a specific turning a turning to it's also used as to to cause to return or to bring back and it also means to revert so I already hear some people saying amen you can always see the truth amen the message has opened our eyes amen it's not just turning randomly turning but you're turning to something turning back amen and you turn to God Amen many times in the Bible it's used to turn but it's always something specific to turn unto the Lord but many many times it's means to turn back again to to to turn back around and talk to who you were talking with before I'm going to show you just a couple of examples let's go to Luke chap two we're going to look at the same exact word the Greek word is epist stro I know that sounds fancy but EP epist stfo because there's another word that means converted it's just sto that just means turn but Epi is like epicenter it's a specific Place amen so it's episo turn specifically or turn to amen so that that it's really important that we understand that well I'm not just throwing out Greek words just to sound smart because I'm probably pronouncing it wrong so but there's a real reason behind it so so act uh Luke Chapter 2 Luke chapter 2: 19 says um and Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned guess what that's episo same word that means converted and be converted and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen as it was told them let's go to let's go to Luke 22 I'm sorry not luk I don't want to go to Luke 22 I want to go to 1 Peter 2 but we're going to come back to Luke so Sav your space in Luke 1 Peter chapter 2 and I'm not going to go to a bunch of places there's there's several more but I'm just going to show this so we can see it in the scriptures first Peter chapter 2 verse 25 says for you were sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and Bishop of your souls so have you figured it out the word returned is the word converted the same word that's translated converted in other places or turned to it's it's it's converted it's translated returned amen or turn about or return again amen even Jesus when he went to pray for the 12-year-old girl gyrus his little girl amen and he prayed for her her spirit came again this word came again is epos she came back again so you can see there's a whole uh uh usage in this word of to return or to turn back or to turn or to to revert amen and that's going to be really important amen because converting a being converted may not be turning back to turning to something new but it may be turning back to something previous amen let's go to Luke chap 22 Luke chap 22 verse 31 in Luke 22:31 he says and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired have you that you may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren we know that here Peter Simon Simon Peter the Lord changed his name to Peter but Peter had been walking with the Lord been part of the ministry been part of the campaigns been part of all of that and and and Jesus begins to tell them that things are going to begin to transpire and Peter doesn't like to hear this and and and he says Simon the the devil has desired to sift thee like weat but I prayed for you that your faith fail not and when you are converted amen so that means that PA that Peter all through the campaigns and all through the ministry he wasn't yet converted he was not yet converted and here's what brother bam says about this in 1960 he says you're not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost the Bible said so after Peter had been been saved and Sanctified given power to cast out unclean spirits and to preach the gospel Jesus plainly told him he was not converted until he received the Holy Ghost and he said after you're converted then strengthen your brethren that was on the night of the Betrayal that he was not yet converted and no man is truly converted until he's been changed and died to himself and the Holy Spirit is control of that person so now uh uh conversion is very very interesting now when we see what the prophet says to repent Amen to change your understanding and be converted Amen to turn what are we turning to well we're turning away from everything else we're turning only to one thing and that's God but we're going back to our originality amen because that's what the new birth does it brings us back to our Original Seed in 1964 in the message why I had to be Shepherds he said and when you're born again it isn't just because you believe you say you're born when when you believe but the Bible said the devil believes also now notice it's not that it's not that it's an experience and brother brandham is very consistent in this that that the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth is an experience amen and and and it's and brother B explains it so many different ways and so many people have explained it so many different ways but he boils it down to this from if I could just make it as simple as I can understand how to make it it's the experience of a changed life that there was the power that came into you and changed you from what you were into something else you've been born again by the power of God and you're a new creature in Christ Jesus amen it's the experience of the new birth that experience of the new birth can have all kinds of other experiences or Sensations that go with it amen and even brother brandham said the mystery in the end time is The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation now brother brandom's not saying there'll be no sensation or or then in the last time you only have the baptism without sensation that's not what he's saying what he's saying is there's a mystery here coming out of the Pentecostal age coming into the bride age we have to understand that because the Pentecostals believe that there must be a specific sensation and namely speaking in tongues amen that you don't have the baptism of Holy Ghost unless you have this sensation but brother brandham saying the mystery in the end time is the baptism of Holy Ghost without sensation it doesn't it's not tied to a sensation it doesn't require a sensation it's not Vindicated by a sensation amen the initial evidence isn't a sensation that's what he's teaching us amen but are there Sensations many many times I say there Sensations many of us have experienced Sensations in the baptism of Holy Ghost as something begins to change us as as we come in contact with another life another Power another Force sometimes it's very tangible sometimes it's very physical sometimes there's gifts that begin to operate but can also come so subtle that you don't have a sensation that you pick up in the flesh but you must have an experience there must be an experience where where you experience a change amen where you experience a new birth where where something in you has shifted amen it's not what it was amen you where you can say I'm not what I ought to be I'm not even what I want to be but I'm sure not what I used to be amen something in me has taken hold and something inside of me has changed and now there's another Power that's beyond the power I used to have because because when the Holy Ghost comes he'll do you with power to be his witness amen that's power to live the word that's power to manifest that's that's the power to live a Christian Life am amen I remember as a boy growing up in the Pentecostal Church seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I I mean I saw a little bit of everything I think that you can see I've I've stood and cried and cried and cried I've had people shake my jaw and tell me to repeat something over and over again while they shake my jaw to try to loosen my tongue I mean that's what they say they tell you to repeat a phrase over and over and over again I don't think on the day of Pentecost they had to do any of that I think it was a natural outflowing of the Holy Ghost I think it was the power of God not the workup of a man amen but I would be so discouraged and so disappointed because I I even remember going to a meeting one time and I got to the front and I stood there and and they went down and prayed for him and and nearly everybody up there was slain in the spirit and when I opened my eyes and done praying I was about the only one standing and I thought I am a failure but one thing I could never do was pretend one thing I can never do was fake it amen that's something in me I couldn't just go along I remember being I remember being down at the altar and what would have been almost described I I hate to use these terms but almost described as a mosh pit as all these kids were bouncing around and bumping into each other and my step brother started bouncing up and down and jumping up and down and my cousin and my step brother I heard him tell my other cousin I mean these are close close people to me and he says just start jumping it feels so good and they started jumping amen and it changed their life what not one degree closer to God when they left that meeting they were exactly the same as they had always been amen and I couldn't make myself jump up and down I just stood there and watched and I felt like a failure but then I came to the message and I come in contact with a living Jesus Christ yeah and something happened to me amen something happened that I knew something happened that was tangible was there Sensations there was loads of Sensations there was times his presence would come so near that my skin would would would my the hairs on my body would stand on in I was coming in contact with the living present real life Jesus Christ and many times I'm reluctant to to share my experiences because I do not want anybody to say if that happened that way it's got to happen this way to me it doesn't happen it doesn't have to happen the same way for anybody what's got to happen is there's got to be a power that comes in and quickens a seed of God that's in the soul amen and brings a change in our life but there must be an experience amen there has to be an experience that actually changes [Music] us amen I knew nothing that I experienced at an altar call in Pentecost changed me I had no power to overcome I could not resist temptation I couldn't overcome lust I I had no power and the older I got the more discouraged I got the more worldly I got but this change this this experience I could overcome what I can never overcome before I began having Victory upon Victory more victories and and it began to change me and it wasn't a put on it wasn't a pretend and there was Temptations and some Temptations were hard to resist and some were worse than others but there was another Power I wasn't depending on human will anymore because my human will could only hold out so long before I collapsed and now there's something holding beyond the human will beyond my strength when I was collapsing something else was holding me up amen amen amen and anytime that I would begin to fail or fault or or or or do wrong there was something that brought me to an immediate quick repentance and would actually cause me to expose myself and confess and do things that I never did before I always hid now there's another Power that's causing me to confess and to repent there must be an experience the experience brother's consistent in this as he goes through the message especially in the last few years it's the it's the experience of a changed life now we could probably testify all night and how it was for you and how it was for others and some will have distinct things that they remember some will have periods of time of change some won't be able to describe it very well it'll be subtle it'll be powerful it'll be all kinds of different things amen and we're not here Amen to try to make one form or another form or one sensation or another sensation preferred or better even no sensation is fine with me as long as there's a change amen and so we're talking about repentance and being converted and being converted is being born again in the smon church age out of the church age book brother B says now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the son and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thought in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn amen so tell me who can be converted right amen amen amen only the elect can be reborn because we because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened and nonseed there is nothing to Quicken he told Peter when you're converted Peter was a Peter was believing Peter had a revelation the Revelation in Peter was Thou Art Christ the son of the Living God Amen and he got that from the father he believed Jesus was the Messiah he followed the ministry he did all that he says but yet you have to be converted and brother Ram tells us that conversion was the new birth and he goes on to tell us that only the seed can be reborn so I ask you again who can be converted Amen in Matthew 18 let's look at this it gives a whole new understanding to the term born again Christian because only the seed can be born again Christian amen sometimes when we say these things it it upsets so many people but we're not here to upset anybody all we're here is say what the prophet said there's a living reality and when we say this we're not saying there's no hope for anybody else we're not saying that nobody else will be saved at the white Throne judgment we know that multitudes will will give entrance into eternal life we thank God for that but we're dealing with the reality of the new birth amen there must be a seed there for there to be a new birth and if there's a seed there then you're the predestinated seed Gene of God you're the elect you're part of the Bride so the new birth who are the who are the Born Again Christians the Born Again Christians can only be those who can be born again who can be born again only those who have the seed of life amen Matthew 181 at the same time came at the same time came the disciples un Jesus saying who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and Jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily I say unto you except you be converted this means to turn and become as Little Children You shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven what's he saying we're going to turn what which direction should we turn what is this turning you need to be converted you need to turn turn to what to one of these little children you need to he's speaking of the new birth you need to become a child again amen amen you need to turn to be converted and become as a little little children or you shall not enter the Kingdom of Heaven amen this is what he tells Nicodemus Nicodemus comes to him at night and he says uh uh he says he asked him how can can I be saved basically and that's John 3:1 he says there was a man of Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto the rabbi we know thou art a teacher come from God for no man do these Miracles that thou doest except uh God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God is that right so what do you have to do to see the king of go you got to be born again and then you'll see it why you'll get the eyes SA you begin to see it amen you must be born again so when we look at at at uh Matthew 18:3 again unless you're converted and become as a little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven and except you're born again you cannot see the kingdom of God so what is this turning to what is this conversion when we turn back to God when we go back we must go back to be like children we must go back to be born again because when we go back and we're born again when we turn back to our origin when we're born again we reconnect with who we really are we reconnect with our origin and we have a new birth amen we start over again the old life is now dead to us now there's newness of Life what have we done in our conversion amen we have surrendered our life and we now have a new life and now we're starting from the beginning as a child and what is a child a child is somebody who doesn't know anything doesn't have it figured out isn't proud and arrogant isn't leading themselves we go all the way back to say I'm starting over I don't know anything God you've got to teach me everything new again this is what it means to be converted Amen to become like one of these little children amen hallelujah this is what had to happen to the Apostle Paul this is this is what had to happen to Peter amen amen Peter was so proud Peter was so self-confident amen Peter was so sure amen because God had promised him the keys and and he had got the revelation of who Jesus was and he had cast out demons and he had done all these things this is what brother bam tells us amen but he had not yet been converted and in his pride he's looking for who's the greatest Among Us and in his pride he's trying to exalt himself over his brother in his pride he's rebuking Jesus saying surely this thing won't happen to you yeah what is he he's self-sufficient he's proud he's knowledgeable but what does he need he needs to be converted and be like a little child again Peter needs to get to the place where he says I don't know anything I'm a failure I can't do it amen I tried I got to go back to being a little child a little baby again because Jesus says I thank you Father that you've hid this from the wise and The Prudent but revealed it unto babes why cuz the Revelation are going to come to the children am and when we're converted we're going back and starting life over doesn't matter if we're 10 doesn't matter if we're 100 when we're converted we're going back and starting life over everything we had learned is foolishness all the education we had is worldly and we're going back to being converted amen let's turn to First Peter chapter 1 just look at a few scriptures associated with this 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 23 being born again not of corruptible seed because what is the corruptible seed that is our first birth amen our seed was our natural seed was corruptible it's been corrupted through hybridization so not being born again being born again not a corruptible seed this is what Nicodemus said must I go back into my mother's womb a second time no that would be corruptible seed birth again not born again born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible what's The Incorruptible seed it's the seed Gene of God amen amen the new birth is not going back to the corruptible seed again it's The Incorruptible seed and how is the new birth going to come by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever when the word comes amen it's going to give us the ability to be born again amen let's go to Titus Chapter 3 Titus Chapter 3 in verse 4 says Titus 3:4 after that the kindness and love of God our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost this wash of regeneration regeneration means New Birth reproduction renewal Recreation regeneration that's what that word means then the the the next word there renewing means renovation or a complete change for the better so what has the Holy Ghost done for us it's made us a new creation completely changed and better amen that's the new birth amen that's what the New Birth has done amen it it it it is by the washing you know he says not by works of our righteousness which we have done we couldn't do this we couldn't earn this but according to his Mercy he saved us how by the washing of regeneration what making us a new creature amen re being reborn or rebirthed amen and being fashioned renovated made completely better and completely different now it's an actual new life amen that is the renewal this is the regener generation and the renewal of the Holy Ghost which is shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior brother M says in the identified masterpieces of God I was reading this the other day and it really struck me said and as Jesus said one time consider the lies and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all of his glory was not array like one now he's going to take this analogy that Jesus used and he's going to explain something to us he says Solomon in all his glory was a magnific ient sight there's no doubt he was a great thing to the world and a great man before God but Solomon's robe did have no didn't have no life in it it was a piece of material probably sheared off of a sheep's back but the Lily had life what we need today is the Life of Christ inside of us that's what purifies not the outward a turned around collar or a degree of psychology or something it takes the power of the resurrected Christ to make make us what we should be God has no other plan than let the Holy Spirit Rule and reign in the church amen that's God plan amen consider the lies Solomon and All His glory wasn't array as one of these Solomon's AR rail amen was man-made it was magnificent it was beautiful but it was man-made but the Lily amen had beauty that came from inside there was the life of the Lily and now in Christianity we're not to be have a put on Glory but an inside out Glory that comes from the life of Jesus Jesus Christ in The Believer amen amen so let's go back to Luke 22 let's pick up Peter's story Luke 22 in verse 60 Luke 2 verse 16 Jesus had told him he prayed for him that his faith fell not said when you're converted go strengthen the Brethren then we know on that fateful night that the guards came Peter and all his his glory cut off the ear of the high priest because he was trying to defend the Lord actually was trying to defend his own self and his own belief and he followed them into the uh into the house of the high priest where they were having the trial it was in the outer Court they kept asking him if he was a galileon and he kept denying the Lord and here we come to the last time in verse 60 and it says Peter said man I know not what thou sayest and Matthew it says he curses and swore I know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the cck crew and the Lord turned and looked upon Peter and Peter remembered the word of the Lord how he had said unto him before the Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and Peter went out and wept bitterly I think this is so important of scripture for tonight especially Peter he was a child of God he was predestinated seed of God he he loved the Lord he genu genely loved the Lord he went along with the ministry he had certain Revelation but yet he hadn't been born again but Peter thought that he could withstand Temptation Peter thought that he was man enough or Christian enough or however we would say it he thought he was but when the pressure came on he found out that he didn't have anything inside his will crumbled his strength failed his his his you know his bravery was empty when it came down to it Peter in himself didn't have what it took to live the life he needed to be converted so when Peter realized that he had utterly failed the Lord he went out and wept bitterly I think that's the best thing he could have ever done then you go out and weep bitterly because he realized he's failed all his pride amounted to nothing all his efforts amounted to nothing he failed you know this might begin to be the first time Peter really starts to be honest with himself I think it would do us all a world of good to be honest with ourselves sometimes we've been in church raised in Church raised around the message we know so much been part of the ministry part of the campaign but in our secret lives we know what we really are yes we know what we're not overcoming we know what vices we have no power to overcome we know no matter what we Bluff and say and no matter what we put on we know what's really going on on the inside some I think the best thing we can do when we keep failing secretly you know it's not publicly secretly keep covering and failing and covering and failing I think the the best thing we can do is just go weep bitterly somewhere and say God I cannot do this anymore I'm an absolute failure on my own I I can not I thought I could but I cannot what did he needed he needed to be converted but he was eligible to be converted because he was a child of God Amen and after that Peter was converted we find out that Peter no longer is hiding in the upper room he's no longer running away amen ashamed of the Lord but after he receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost he runs right out and becomes the spokesman on the inaugural day he's not ashamed anymore to declare his allegiance to Jesus Christ he was before but he's not now what happened something changed there was a conversion that took place there was a birth that came amen and we find that Peter doesn't even become a perfect believer after that because it's not about flawlessness amen it's about following the Lord is about a new birth and we find him in Antioch separating from the brothers creating a dissension amen and and playing the part of a hypocrite a little bit and Paul withstands him to his face amen but guess what Peter's correctable because Peter's been changed amen Peter doesn't cut his head off Peter doesn't accuse him Peter doesn't break Fellowship but later Peter actually admonishes them to believe Paul and actually it takes the writings of Paul and makes them equal to scriptures why he wasn't perfect but he was changed that was a changed man and later we find him amen Peter is the one who who who who was Brash who was bold who was proud who was arrogant who corrected everybody who wanted to be the best amen when he found out he didn't have the goods he wept bitterly amen he he he absolutely changed his thinking about himself he repented he realized I'm not what I thought I was and then the new birth came right and now he went out and he never tried to be anything anymore now when the lame man was healed at the gate beautiful a me he went lumping leaping and jumping into the temple and they gathered around and began to to almost worship amen Paul uh Peter and John Peter and John John Peter says why look you at us as though some power of us has made this man whole it's not us amen but it's faith in Jesus Christ it's faith in his name that this man is everywhere whole Peter now has no desire to take the credit he a changed man amen that because why because he repented and he was converted amen his thinking changed he was converted and he comes out different this is the man amen that God would allow to preach the stature of a perfect man and the virtues of God Amen I would not have called him eligible before to preach on Temperance or patience or brotherly kindness but the new birth changed he was renewed he was renovated he was regenerated amen he was a new creature he went back to being a child he went back to being a babe amen he went back to knowing nothing and starting all over again and going from the from the New Birth unto adoption a new life amen starting as nothing the Apostle Paul thought he was a Believer the Apostle Paul thought that he knew the word been to the best school and he thought he was working for the Lord yeah right he was the smartest he was the wisest he had the most skill and ability he was in good standing with the priest and the high priest and the elders but he had an encounter with a living Jesus Christ and the pillar of fire and that encounter smoted him to the ground yes humbled humbled and broken he finds out that the one that he had been persecuting he thought they were people that had a false religion and a false idea and were ruining the the Bible when he come to find out in that encounter that he was persecuting Jesus Christ himself who was living in the people amen and now his whole world changes amen does he come to repentance he absolutely comes to repentance because his whole thinking changed amen when he gets up from that experience he can't even see to walk he has to be led by the hand into the City and he's led by the hand into the city the Bible says he lays there for 3 days with no sight and no no food yeah I wonder what he thought about for 3 days I wonder how many things he regretted for three days I wonder with this Revelation that just hit him as a literal light out of Heaven changed his whole world his whole Paradigm all his understanding you know when it all changed it left him humble and broken it wasn't flippant it wasn't oh yeah I see that I'll take no it wrecked his Universe amen yeah yeah this is why brother B says in one place I doubt a dry-eyed confession it's not that you have to cry to be converted that's that's not what he's saying but back in his day there was so many decisions for Christ and raising your hand if you agree and you want to be saved and and and fill out a card or come forward and repeat after me prayer amen but there was there was none of this Brokenness none of this weeping bitterly none of this realizing I'm not what I thought I was I thought I was a Christian but I'm not really a Christian I thought I was a message believer but I see now I'm not really got the change that I was projecting to other people because inside I have no power to overcome yeah right that's not something to take lightly that's not something to move on Beyond we don't keep pretending we don't keep moving on in our own Pride amen we need to come to a weeping bitterly we need to come to a place when we're flat on our back broken and humiliated with a couple days to think about it and I'm sure he was thinking about how could I been so wrong how could I miss it and I'm sure he was thinking about Steven stoning amen amen sometimes what we need is to realize we're not what we thought we were Lord and we need a bit of humility and Brokenness and some weeping some Contrition some quiet time to sit and say God you've got to help me because I can't help myself what we don't need to do is just keep moving on and hope everything works out in 2 Corinthians 7:10 it says and for Godly sorrow worketh repentance yes to Salvation amen for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of not to be regretted but the sorrow of the world worketh death Godly sorrow worketh repentance this is why I believe for the prophet said I doubt a dry-eyed confession like I said I I don't want I don't think you need to pour out floods of tears just to prove that you've confessed but you may right but I believe one thing there'll be a conviction in your heart that'll tear you up there'll be something to cause you to realize I got to have more than what I have now am there'll be something that begins to wreck your world am me I've seen it even even in children I've seen when they begin to go through that time where they're just unsettled and they're Disturbed and something's eating at them and it's tearing them up what is it amen there's there's Godly conviction that has come and there's a sorrow and there's a concern for their soul I don't think that should ever go away I think we need genuine real conversions amen amen we need to to have our world wrecked we need to weep bitter tears we need to realize am I need something that I don't have right now because what I have right now isn't working and we need to cry out to God and say God you made a promise in your word that if I will repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for remission of sins I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and I I have been baptized according to your word and I have repented and I'm repenting now all my understanding is changing God come and fill me with your spirit change me almighty God do the work in me that I can't do myself do in me what my willpower failed what my strength has failed what my intellect has failed to do do something in me Lord I invite you I ask you I implore you God change me I think it should be serious should be Earnest not flipping and light-hearted but there should be some Earnest repentance brother B says in the message the token said don't just come this far say I believe the message you obey the messenger come into Christ you say well I believe every word said brother Brenham that's good but that's just being able to read he's not talking about a genuine Faith from your heart he's talking about a mental acceptance of what you've heard or been God right but that mental acceptance is not enough that's a good thing it's not a bad thing you should you should recognize it to be true you should accept it at true amen but it's got to go deeper than a mental acceptance amen or an agreement he said that's just being able to read said take the message take it into your heart that you must have the token amen the very life that was in Christ be in you when I see that I will pass over you until you have the token you're not safe from the pending destruction amen the pending destruction is coming but the only safety is the token amen and the in on the in Egypt amen at the Passover the token was the literal blood that they put on the lentil and on the doorpost and and and the Death Angel would pass by and recognize that token is symbolic amen that they have taken the lamb inside and they slay the lamb as a substitute for them and the token is evidence that they're safe amen yeah they've obeyed the word and they're sealed under the token mother B said the token today is not physical blood the token today is the life that was in the blood amen the life that was in the blood with that that that blood that was shed at Calvary the life was released and the life now can come back upon the believer and that life in us that's the thing that changes us that's the thing that quickens us that's the new birth that brings us back to our origin and starts us as a child again on the road to adoption and that token that changed life that literal life of Jesus Christ in The Believer is the token and will keep us from the impending judgment and it's the only thing yes that will but praise God it's for the children of God it's absolutely for the children of God brother Bram said God wants to fill you more than you want to be filled it's his desire it's his plan it's his word it's his promise amen what does he need he needs somebody who will repent yeah he needs somebody who will lay themselves out and say God I can't do this I'm not going to pretend another day I need the indwelling power of the Holy Ghost to live this life I need a new birth experience I need an experience that changes me it's what he needs it's what we need it's what we all need and you know even those of us who've received this experience sometimes we need to turn back again yes sometimes we wander away a little bit make a misstep here or there pick up our own idea about something sometimes we need to make a turn back ourselves brother man refers to this and and Jesus mentions this in Revelations chapter 2 let's go to Revelation Chapter 2 Revelation 2:4 said nevertheless I have someone against thee because thou has left thy first love this is the Ephesian Church age remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent this repent is the same word repent change your thinking the Ephesian church had he says you've lost your first love what was their first love that first experience they had when everything was fresh and new they were committed to God and in a relationship with the Lord and brother Braham said formalism begin to creep in man they they they lost their Zeal and their fire and their ability to reach forth in the spirit and a little bit of formality had begin to creep in is that right and he tells them you've left your first love now repent and go back to the first works oh this isn't just for a new conversion this is for all of us friends sometimes we we we we we think we're okay and everything's going along fine but reality we begun to grow cold amen we begun to grow a little formal and every once in a while he needs to tell us repent and go back to your first Works amen when you were first bornn again when everything was about Christ and nothing else when nothing else mattered when rejection didn't matter when the rest of the world didn't matter the only thing mattered is that something's changed in me I've met God and that's all I want am amen he says repent and do the first Works what do he mean repent and go back and brother BR says in the fourth seal he says look she was asked to repent go back to where she fell from and where did she fall from the word hey where did he fall from where did the denomination fall from the word there you are seeing no other way just every time it's come right back to the word right back to the word and they get into a system that runs them back away from the word runs them from the word instead of to the word notice look she was given a space to repent go back repent means to go back turn back about face repent go back brother brandom is now taking this term repent and he's using it in this in this way according to the scripture repent and go back and mean we know repentance in the Bible means change your mind conversion means to turn back and now he's coming to the church who's already the church but he's saying Turn Back amen repent and turn back amen say God help us to not lose our first love help us not to lose our first experience I say God what I want is I want a freshening of my experience I want a fresh relationship that stays fresh I don't want to grow formal when I feel it growing formal I want it to come right back amen I want to go right back to when when you you feel the Lord's so close you know he's there amen I want to go back to that I want to I want to to stay in those refreshing times I want to be refreshed again and again and again I don't want to just preach this for new people to be converted amen and and turn to the Lord and Born Again am mean after I've had the experience of the new birth I don't want to stray too far away from it amen I want to stay in the refreshing of the Lord amen and and walking in him in my first love amen if it goes 40 50 60 70 years we go mature all the way into adoption I don't want to leave leave my first love when it's so real and so powerful it means everything to us praise God Amen just want to finish with this scripture that I quoted before but Jesus said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because I was hid these things from the wise and prudent amen and revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight who's he revealing himself to his babes the ones that can be born again not the ones that are all self-sufficient and wise have the message all figured out and has all the answers but he reveals it to the babes amen amen those that have been turned back and become like little children so that they can see the Kingdom of Heaven those have been born again so that they can see the kingdom of God that's who he's revealing this to you we don't need to get self-inflated proud we don't need to become know- it alls because we've believed 20 30 40 years what we need is to keep laying in the presence of the Lord and saying Lord change my thinking change my thinking change my thinking you know I I I come in contact with the living Jesus Christ so many years ago 24 25 years ago and for 24 25 years however long it's been he's been constantly changing my thinking amen that's right you know what I've been doing for 24 years I've been repenting for 24 years I've been repenting amen and I don't think my time of repenting is over but I want his mind in every situation his mind in every decision his mind and everything I don't want to repent just once and be converted I want to keep repenting and keep repenting and keep repenting and anytime I find myself straying away and getting cold I want to turn back amen and get right back close to him again because that's the only place that I'm happy and that's the only place I can survive and that's the only place I can grow amen we have to repent and be converted be turned back to a child again to be born again repent it's a commandment repent and be converted let's all Stand Together musicians if you can come brother John if you can come I just had a desire to do a little word study because I want to understand what it means to repent and be converted we can come and we can ask forgiveness we should ask for forgiveness we should confess our sins we should ask for forgiveness but real repentance goes beyond that it actually changes our thinking amen it takes us from remorse and sorrow for sin and remorse because Godly sorrow worketh repentance because when you're really sorry about something you change the way you think about it when you really regret the way you've lived and you regret your misunderstandings and you regret your selfishness and you regret your pride it changes the way you think about yourself Peter I'm sure had a lot of changing to do in his thinking Paul certainly had a lot of changing to do I know I had a tremendous amount and I'm still repenting but I want to repent and I want to be turned back I want everyone every child of God to have the opportunity to repent and be turned back repent and be converted go back to be born again go back it doesn't matter how old old you are and it certainly doesn't matter how long you've been in the church and it doesn't matter how long you've been in the message M repent and be converted let's be born again let's have that experience where you can say I I may not be able to explain it it may not have happened to me the way it happened to you but one thing I'm sure of there's been a an effective change in my life something real has happened to me and changed my life amen amen let's just bow our heads together dear heavenly father I Trust You Lord in all things I Trust You Lord in your leadership your Holy Ghost anointing Lord and I trust God that you directed me to preach this message tonight because I trust your leadership I trust your ways I've seen you work so many times in so many ways it's always been perfect Lord when you take control it's always perfect and always effective God this message might only be for one Soul only one Soul under the sound of my voice that needed to hear this but if that's true you directed me for that Soul God if you've given me the anointing to preach it I pray that you bring the anointing to receive it Lord that you would touch that life that you would touch that Soul God no no matter where that individual has been that seed's been laying there from before the foundation of the world you've been waiting Lord for a time that you can Quicken it to life maybe the individual who's carrying that seed has been playing Church pretending going with the motion caught in the Stream and flow of life with parents or loved ones or spouse maybe theyve just been carried along through the church and they have no objection to the message but they they know inside of themselves there's never been that change that new birth that really gives them the power even in their secret life to overcome God I pray if there's an individual that's like that Lord I pray that you'd go to them now for God you said through the foolishness of preaching you would save Sinners you would save the Lost Lord through this mechanism and I trust that it'll work according to your ways Lord God I pray that you would move on the hearts and lives of your children that you would bring genuine repentance genuine conversions Lord and God for all of us Lord who had a tendency to grow cold Lord we want to turn back all of us who've let the cares of life and the responsibilities frustrations begin to bring a formality to our our walk our life God would you forgive us now God awaken us Lord so that we can change the way we think so that we realize everything's not fine it's not fine it's not the way it should be it's not the way you want it Lord and bring us back to our first love God give us the power as we surrender to you I pray you give us the power Lord and a freshening bring a freshening Upon Us Lord freshen the experience freshen your spirit pour out your spirit Upon Us Lord and bring us back to a fresh experience with you where we can have a love affair Lord that's fresh and vibrant Lord and Powerful God forgive us God I pray that there' be none of us Lord who would leave here the same way we came in but God that your working of your spirit would begin to move in our hearts we begin to change us and break down barriers Lord and God I pray above all that you would that you would send the power of conviction upon Hearts who are not being honest that you would send the power of conviction and bring a sorrow for sin bring a remorse Lord so you can break through the barrier of religion break through the barrier Lord of tradition and get down lord to where your seat is laying waiting to Spring to life and I pray God that you would remove every bear and you would go to that seed and that you would bring it to life now Lord that you would do a quick wening work God we love you with all of our hearts we thank you God because we never came looking for you came looking for us you we we never had the power to change ourselves but you came and changed us you have the power and you've given the power you've promised the power Lord let the promise of your word take effect tonight move in our hearts and move in our lives change us oh God we pray we ask these things Lord just move move move like only you know how to move Lord I pray that you sweep in waves from row to row from seat to seat until you don't leave your seed untouched Lord that you would find it that you would you know exactly where that seed's laying I'm asking Lord that you would that you would bring it to Life by The Power of your spirit I love you God I thank you Lord that you care so much about us that you would move the ministry this direction that this is your love Lord this is your desire for your own this is your call to yourself Lord may may it be recognized as a call to come to your side it it be those who would leave Lord their own thinking and own tradition and Run To You Lord to embrace you and lay themselves down and be changed we love you God we ask that your power would unfold in our lives give us the change in our lives and give us the power to live your life in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen can we sing that song sweep

sweep my soul sweep over my soul sweet Spirit sweep over my soul and my rest is complete while I S at your feet sweet Spirit sweet over my soul amen I tell you friends I I'm not an evangelist it's not my gift I'm not requiring that you raise your hand come to the front if that's what you need that's what would help you come and pray pray at your seat move out of your seat but for me I'm not requiring that all I'm asking is there's a transformation in the heart of God's children there's a new birth experience that changes from somebody that's been trying somebody who's been desperately trying and failing trying and frustrated trying and don't know how my desire as a pastor my desire as a brother my desire as your friend is that the sweeping of the spirit would sweep down and bring a transformation tell it's not a trying but a relinquishing your efforts and surrender from a trying and failing to a giving in completely to God and saying God I can't go the cycle of trying and
