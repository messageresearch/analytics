precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen man God bless you as you're seated for just a moment amen thank you musicians God bless you amen it's uh it's uh good to be back we had a wonderful time out in Oregon the Lord really blessed us and Angie and I on our little trip plus the services we had were wonderful with the Saints out there and uh the time we spent with Brother Rich and sister charity and their family was really good so we appreciate all your prayers and our absence also appreciate all the ministering brothers who ministered while we were gone amen it was wonderful we've heard good reports on it all I had a chance to listen to brother Kyle's uh sermon and also the one brother uh Gabe preached and I enjoyed them I haven't listened to brother Benjamin's yet but I heard good reports but I'll listen for myself amen but I'm excited I was intrigued by the title and blessed and it seems that God has had a theme amen and when we come today and hear the song that sister Naomi sang and right in the same theme and really blessed my heart so I appreciate that and brother Mike it was good to hear you sing brother we appreciated that as well it's good to be together again and we thank God uh for that and one thing I'd like to do before we get into the word is make an announcement you all know it already but I'm here so I get to make the announcement we would like to announce an engagement of brother James Brooks and sister Amanda SEO would you two please stand we want to congratulate them God bless you amen thank you we want to congratulate them and ask the Lord to bless them as they make their plans for their wedding and we want to be here to support them and all of that amen God is good amen I uh you know U James called me and told me what he was going to do and I said God bless you and so but when I saw him Friday night at the stars thing I saw him holding hands and I said what happened while I was gone something changed amen but we're happy for them and may God bless them as they move forward amen also want to just give appreciation once again to brother Elmer and sister Emily for hosting the Stars event EV and doing all the work and those that helped him we had a wonderful time out there and the Lord certainly blessed us with a clear night and good weather and a good time so we thank them for that and uh and Elmer's partly responsible for the message we're going to preach tonight but I'll explain that or this morning but I'll explain that later amen amen God is good also I want to let you know that brother Gabe Smith is away preaching for brother Jean kadeema in Pittsburgh right now so remember him in prayer he's going to be ministering and then and scooting back here uh this evening so pray for for him as well uh also I noticed we've got a tremendous amount of visitors here God bless you it's good to have you here amen we love having you I got to meet uh sister Lori LA's parents I've met her mom before got to meet her dad and her uncle again which is also Naomi LA's family so we're good we're glad to have you all God bless you it's good to have you back once again also brother Michael and Sister Mary and I know you've

here to visit with us man I also want to let you know that the communion service the communion feet washing will be this afternoon and so we'll announce that again at the end of service but uh want to say God bless you let's all stand together also I see we got the two sisters from down south God bless you it's good to have you here Sister Mary and sister Wanda it's good to have you back again amen so God bless you all and let's turn in our Bibles to the Book of John John chapter 8 John chapter 8 when we get there let's go to verse 31 John 8 and verse 31 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen God bless you as you have your seats amen may the Lord bless us as we look into his word I'd like to take if I could take for a subject for a title for the service today the effect of believing a lie instead of the truth the effect of believing a lie instead of the truth and so this is uh something that I've been thinking about a long time and and I told you that brother Elmer is partially to blame for the service today but really it's not his fault I was just talking to him yesterday morning and I was just sharing with them uh some things that have been on my heart lately and I made the statement I said but I'm not ready to preach it yet I don't feel feel the Liberty I don't feel and he says why not that's all he said was why not and it was the mouth of God Amen so I tried to explain to him but while I was explaining to him my heart was just I don't know how to explain it but I wasn't believing my own excuse and I realized later you know I I went through the day and I had another subject in mind and I was looking and studying and nothing absolutely nothing click nothing would happen nothing would move I I couldn't get the inspiration to to line up in any way and um finally later in the day or later at night actually it was in the late evening time I couldn't get anything to to click we had many things on our heart lots of things we'd like to discuss in the word but I I just started playing some music and as I was playing the music I just sat back and closed my eyes and when I did a scripture dropped in my heart loud like a thunder said my people shall know the truth and the truth shall make them free and as soon as it did I surrendered I said oh God and I still don't feel prepared to preach it but I know that that's just me that's my own personality that's just Chad that's my own my own handicap amen because I want to I want to know all the nuts and bolts and all the details CU I love those things that's my personality that's my makeup but God doesn't want me amen always to go down that path sometimes he he wants somebody to just say why not why not what's the problem it's been on your heart for a month why don't you just preach it and me and my in my own whatever handicap that I have or whatever you want to call it my temperament I said no no no I don't have it I haven't studied it out I don't know it in great detail but that that doesn't matter that doesn't matter so when I surrendered I just surrendered and so I just pray that you would just receive a portion for yourself today just pull and let God speak I'm trusting God to speak today amen I'm trusting that this is his Direction so we trust his way but Jesus made this statement and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free when Jesus makes that statement that statement is always true and so so we we want to we want to grab a hold of that is our foundational fundamental truth is that the truth shall make you free so if you want to be free find the truth because the truth will make you free in fact nothing else will make you free and I just want to talk about that and go down that path if you can go with me to 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 in verse 10 2 Thessalonians 2 and 10 and it says and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness so we we can preach this scripture in many ways there's a lot of things that contained in here but one thing that I I I that jumped out to me was the fact that you have two opposite things that work here you have a lie or the lie and you have the truth and because they had not a love of the truth they were given strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness so the truth shall make you free but what will a lie do it'll bring damnation it'll bring destruction it'll bring all these negative things and we realize if we go all the way back to the Garden of Eden to the very beginning God had given truth and that truth was a wall of protection that truth was life that truth was Freedom that truth kept them free it kept them in Dominion it kept them in In Perpetual life it kept them in Perfect Harmony it kept the world in Perfection amen but the devil came along and then what did the devil do what was the what was it that he did to change all these circumstances he brought a lie and when Eve accepted the LIE amen What followed the LIE it came with death it came with separation Then There came fear Then There came all of these fallouts amen that was a result of her believing the LIE instead of staying with the truth because the truth was keeping her free the truth that made her free was keeping her free and they were completely free under the truth but it was the lie that brought damnation and destruction and separation and fear we find them in a state of perfection and Harmony and unity and fellowship with God we find them in this perfect State under this perfect word under this perfect truth amen but as soon as they left the truth and went to the LIE now we find them hiding from God we have a broken Fellowship we find them with fear uh Adam says I heard thy voice and I was afraid you find a separation now even a separation between the husband and wife because now amen he's he's blaming her and then she's blaming the serpent and we have all of this Fallout because they left the truth for a lie so this becomes the the effect of believing a lie instead of the truth as long as they believe the truth in stayed with the truth everything stayed perfect they were free soon as they believe the lie the effect of that the results was bondage and I'd like to propose to you today that it's the exact same thing today it never changes that the effect of believing a lie is fear bondage torment separation anxiety those are all the effects of believing a lie but it's still true that the truth will make you free if we go to Revelations chapter 12 let's turn there together in Revelation 12 verse 3 and 4 Revelations 12: 3 and 4 it says and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and brother bham in 1957 in questions and answers on Hebrews he refers back to this scripture he said and the red dragon stood to Devour the child as soon as it was born and he took his tail and pulled a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the Earth did you notice that now that doesn't mean that Satan has a long tail that he hooked around people but the tail t a l e that he told and pulled a third part of those Stars those stars were Abraham's seed so now what brought amen the casting down of these Stars it was a lie that he told it it he gathered around his tail but brother bam showing that it's not just the tail t a i l but it was the tail t a l e it was the lie that he told that caused the fall it was the lie that he told that caused separation it was the lie that he told that caused the stars from Heaven to be cast to the Earth it was all because of a lie and look what changed because of a lie they were dwelling in Perfection Amen in heaven and so they the Stars had fallen and so when when we start to look at this I want to go to First Kings now let's let's just turn there first Kings chapter 22 First Kings chapter 22 and uh verse 20 First Kings 22 and 20 this is the story of Ahab and this is where Jehoshaphat comes to Ahab and they want to go up and take their land they want to take the land that is uh uh Syria uh that was portioned to them from Moses and it says here in verse 20 and the Lord said who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at Routh Gilead so now there's a conference in heaven and brother B begins to show us this conference that takes place in heaven because Micaiah saw it and and he saw that they were gathered in heaven and and God had already spoke through the mouth of of the Prophet amen that Ahab was going to come to Doom because of the choices that he made and now it's time for that destruction to come but how is God going to bring that destruction to Ahab that's the question that he asked in heaven how are we going to accomplish this uh that I've said in Ahab what's going to be the mechanism that we use and he says who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at Routh Gilead and one said on this manner and another said on that manner so all of these Spirits all these angels are speaking and there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord and said I will persuade him and the Lord said unto him wherewith and he said I will go forth and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all of his prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade him and Prevail also go forth and do so and what was it that what was it that brought ahab's destruction finally it was when Ahab believed a lie brother Bram said you know the biggest story that was ever told the biggest lie that was ever told is one that's got a whole lot of Truth in it now the biggest lie was ever told was what Satan told Eve see it had a whole lot of Truth in it and now you come around and say something that's just really right straight out a lie why you wouldn't believe that you know better but when it comes to a place where it's got about 99% truth and 1% lie that's the deceiving type that's the kind you have to watch is them kind and that's just what the devil's good at I want you to hone in on this this is where he's the expert he's not the expert in the in the blatant falsehood the the complete lie amen that has no truth in it that's so easy to discern but what's the devil good at the Devil is good at the LIE that has mostly truth mixed in it but a little bit of lie amen for deception that's what he's really good at and he told Eve everything truth but one thing amen and so we see here when it comes to Ahab amen he's got this all these prophets a couple hundred prophets that are gathered there and brother B said they're genuine prophets of the Lord amen and he said they have a gift amen they're genuine prophets of the lord they're Hebrew prophets amen but but a lying Spirit entered in and what did that lying Spirit do it was there Amen to fulfill the word of God and that was prophesied over Ahab but what they did is they convinced Ahab and trying to convince Jehosaphat that yes Moses gave you this land amen This Land Is Ours it was given by inheritance we can read the Torah we can find the boundaries we find out that this scripture this word tells us This Land Is Ours that is the truth the lie was that the Lord said go up and take it that's the lie everything else was the truth amen but this was a lie and and Micaiah amen he went to to to go seek the Lord to find out because they called forth him too Jehosaphat wanted to know if there was one more and he begins to come and and and and he begins to uh uh uh uh well he goes and has a vision and he sees this all play out in heaven and he comes back and tells him amen he's already got pressure they they already ahab's angry with him and they've already pressure pressuring him to to to go along with the group so he comes up and he says go on up that's what they wanted to hear that's why the lie was so enticing to Ahab because that's what he wanted to hear and so he he he he says go up and then AB says did not I tell you to only tell me what the Lord says just tell me the truth and my gu says okay I'll tell you the truth here's the truth well zedekiah didn't like it he walked over and slapped him in the face amen and all of these other they they didn't like it they didn't listen to him the truth would have set them free from the destruction that was coming the LIE is what sent them straight to destruction and straight to death was the LIE amen because that's the result of a lie that's the effect of a lie amen it brings death it brings separation it brings damnation it brings fear amen but the truth will set you free but when you told told them the truth they wouldn't accept the truth they stayed with the lie and that lie had a lot of Truth in it it was mostly true but it was the the lie part of that story that was binding Jesus says in John 8 you don't have to turn there I'll just read it to you John 843 why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word you of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not here once again Jesus was telling them the truth but they were staying with the lie and he was telling them that you're offspring of the devil amen because you cannot receive my truth because there's no truth in you the devil has no truth in in but he is a liar and the father of it he's the father father of lying the original lie in heaven and the original fall came from Lucifer came from Satan so he is the father of lies and so that means if he's the originator or the father of Lies remember what brother brother brandham tells us a lie is the truth misrepresented it's the truth perverted it's something true but with a Twist on it that's a lie because you that's what the devil had the devil didn't have his own creation he didn't have his own work he didn't have anything so what he did is he took and perverted what God had said and took and perverted what God has done and he's the perverter of the truth and he's the originator or Father of Lies so that means all lies come from him but who's the originator of Truth the originator of Truth is God himself amen because he is the truth amen Jesus says I am the truth the life and the way he is the truth God is the truth the word is truth and the word is God so you have truth which is life you have lie which is death these two stand at a stark contrast with one another and we find it through the whole Bible turn with me to numbers 13 I just want to lay some of these things down as a foundation because there's there's some principles that I want to get to and discuss Numbers Chapter 13 when he began to look at this we find it as you meditate on it it just begins to pop through all the scriptures and I'm sure as you meditate on it even during the service or after the service many things are going to be coming to your mind out of the word amen but but I wanted to move from there amen as we as we progress in the service and as we leave this service I wanted to move from just the stories of old and just the all the things that I see between lie and truth but I want it to come down to my life amen so that I can begin to discern what is the lie and what is the truth numbers 13:31 in in in numbers 13 we have kades barnea kades barnea Moses sends out the spies one from each tribe the 12 Spies go out they go to spy out the land to bring back a report amen and and it's amazing the report that they bring because when they come back amen their report had a lot of Truth in it let's read what they say here in verse 31 said but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it were are men of great stature and there we saw the Giants the sons of anoch which came of the Giants and we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in their sight so they go up and they they have a promise and the promise of God is that I'm going to take you to this Promised Land I'm going to give you this land so Moses sent the spies over they brought back a report and when they brought back they came amen with a cluster of grapes that took two men to Bear them they were so great and they said truly the land is a land that floweth with milk and honey they're saying whatever Moses told us is true about the land it's a good land it's a perfect land amen it's a it's a strong land it's got the milk and honey it's got It's fruitful it's everything that he said but but says we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we almost everything they say is true there was wall cities true there was Giants true there was maybe more people true they had better armor true they were better equipped true they were stronger true but we're not able to take it lie everything was true but one little part was a lie the part that said that we can't take it and and I want to look at verse 14 or Chapter 14 verse 1 now says and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would God that we had died in the land of Egypt or would God we had died in the Wilder in this Wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord brought us into this land to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return unto Egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return unto Egypt and Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the Assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of jeffan which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we passed through to search it is an exceeding good land and if the Lord Delight in us then when if the Lord Delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us and a land which floweth with milk and honey and rebel not ye against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us their defenses is departed from them and the Lord Is With Us fear them not but all the congregation bade Stone them with stones and the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle the congregation before all the children of Israel see the effect of believing a lie they come to barish Cades barnea there was excitement they were thrilled they were at the border they were getting ready to go into the promises of God what Moses had told us we've we've come through the Red Sea we've come through amen the bitter Waters of marrow we've come through the the the all these things that we've passed through in this journey and now we're standing here going in can you imagine the excitement can you imagine the the atmosphere we're getting ready to go in and we're getting ready to have all these Pleasures that have been promised unto us but we're going to send these spies in to tell us what's the best way to go forward and as they go in they come out and they bring 90 some per truth but with it they mixed a lie and that lie was their own reasoning their own thinking their own Vision their own perspective and they mixed that in and the results of that lie mix in with all that truth was a group now who were angry at Moses who were upset at God who wished they had died in Egypt look at how the scene changes in a few moments or a few hours amen from Jubilation and exaltation and excitement CU we're going in but one little lie comes in and that lie that's believed amen remember Caleb tried to say stop amen stop we can take it and they shouted him down amen when he tried to when they Joshua tried to tell him again no the Lord Delight in us their defenses will melt away don't you be afraid amen they wanted to Stone them to death look what a lie brings a lie brings fear separation anxiety paranoia amen disruption separation all of this came because of a little lie my goodness God help us in numbers 23 let's just turn there we're already in numbers let's just turn turn there numbers 23 numbers 23 and 19 said God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good God is not the liar God has never lied there's nothing he's ever promised there's nothing he ever said that is not the truth and forever Remains the truth God said he would take them in he'll take them in and to prove it he took them in but not the generation that believed the LIE he had to raise up a new one and he took them in to prove that his word never fails it was true it was always true amen it was the lie that brought separation and and the listen when these people believed a lie it's it's so astounding to me human nature human nature uh uh the more you look at it brother B said I've always been fascinated by the study of human nature he says something like that I'm not fascinated by it I'm disturbed I mean it's fascinating but in a disturbing way cuz we are absolutely the most pathetic creatures that are on the face of the earth I mean everything's going along that Moses is the great leader Moses uh uh did Moses Moses spoke the word of God and performed Miracles and my we've got such a leader Moses oh my goodness well as long as we stay with this man oh we're going to make it all the way through cuz look at what God's doing with this man then they come to the Red Sea and now Moses doesn't know what to do and they panic and they panic and the LIE is that we're going to be destroyed the LIE is Pharaoh's Army is going to kill us and in the face of that lie Moses why did you and Moses why Hey listen you were singing his Praises a few days ago why are you so mad at him now nothing changed with Moses what changed was your belief you believed a lie and now you hate Moses and and then then then all of a sudden they like Moses again and then they hate Moses and then they like Moses and they hate Moses and I feel sorry for poor old Moses because when Moses smoked the Rock and water came out Moses was the man of the hour amen but when they got hungry and they all they had was Mana amen and they were sick of Mana Moses was a problem again oh my goodness and we say those people in the wilderness listen it's time to look in the mirror and be honest we love somebody that's a greatest Minister that's the greatest brother that sister there's nobody like her and then one thing goes wrong and you start to believe that she said something about you or maybe she looked at you a funny way I always had a problem with her and she's all stuck up and last week you said she was the greatest thing that ever ever happened maybe you believed a lie maybe you accepted something about somebody that wasn't true and it begins to break Fellowship like it did at kades barnea until they were ready to Stone Caleb what were they going to Stone Caleb for because Caleb was telling the truth in face of their lie and they so believed and identified with the LIE they wanted to stop the voice that was telling the truth this is the effect of believing lie one of the effects of believing a lie is that when somebody comes to tell the truth you want to kill the person telling the truth because you've already accepted the lie lies are dangerous but we're told the most dangerous lies are the ones that are 95 or 99% true with tons of facts to support them evidence exhibit a exhibit B Exhibit C exhibit Z to support this lie but I tell you friends if it's contrary to one word in the Bible it's a lie we can take God's word and stand on God's word it doesn't matter if there's walled cities it doesn't matter if there's Giants it doesn't matter if they have tanks and ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs and whatever they have and you're going in with a plow amen and a sling amen if God said you're going to take the land you're going to take the land remember when God told his disciples let us get into the boat and go to the other side that was the word of the Lord get in the boat and go to let us get in the boat and go to the other side then he lays down and goes to sleep in the back a big storm comes up and all of a sudden the disciples lost sight of the word of the Lord and started to look at the circumstance and they started to believe a lie and the lie was we're all going to die did they believe it that's what they said and the LIE listen lies grow and the LIE morphed into don't you care that we perish the LIE moved from we're going to die to how in the world can you be quiet at a time like this how could you be laying back here asleep we're going to die and you don't care and we say all those disciples those silly disciples what was wrong with them cuz I can read the story and obviously it's going to be okay well you weren't the one having the wave crash over on your head but we've come to places in life where we've had waves crashing over our head you know what we say I'm not going to make it through this trial God don't you see what I'm going through God where are you God why haven't you God why don't you as if he forgot where we were as if he didn't already have a plan as he didn't already know what the outcome would be as he wasn't working all things for his glory as it as as if all things weren't working together for good all of a sudden now we start to believe a lie and what is the LIE we start to believe in our trial we we can believe many of them but if we stay with them they start to grow the LIE is he doesn't see me God's not doing anything to change the circumstances and you can have all kinds of supporting evidence to believe that lie why because you don't see anything changing the circumstance continues this day the next day and the following day and the circumstances are continuing and you start to believe when you start to believe it's always going to be like this it's never going to change I'm always going to be in this position that's a lie that is a lie but when you start to identify that lie it's going to do the thing that a lie has always done through the history of the world and even before the world in heaven the LIE did the same thing it brought damnation it brings destruction it brings separation and it brings fear and the minute you start to think then you start think well something's wrong the minute you start to say something's wrong I've done something wrong something's wrong maybe I'm not a Christian maybe I'm not bride maybe I was just kidding myself maybe God doesn't care about me maybe I I'll always be like this listen you may not verbalize those but those are things that are stirring inside of your heart and your mind because the devil is there stirring up your thoughts and he's Whispering little things into your mind amen and the more you believe that the more you begin to believe that maybe I deceived myself maybe I was never one of them aen maybe I wasn't a Believer the promise works for others but it doesn't work for me lie lie lie lie lie but that lie brings fear cuz now all of a sudden God's not going to come and save you God's not going to defend you and this problem's never going to go away and fear has torment fear has torment and now we find ourselves not at peace brother in the message I know he starts talking about rainy days and cloudy skies are no signs of God's disapproval neither are sunny skies and blue skies and sunny days signs of his approval amen his approval is we've been accepted in the Beloved election Amen period the Revelation that I was chosen before the foundation of the world is the truth I have been accepted not because of what I've done not because of my circumstance and no matter how much my circumstances changed it can't change what he determined in his mind before the foundation of the world that's the truth and the truth will make you free what will bring you into bondage the LIE anything that fights that Truth where it causes you to start to doubt yourself doubt God doubt the promise of the word and the thing is you're a Believer so you can't doubt the word the word Works God's A Healer God's true the message is true but what he's getting you to do is doubt your part of it doubt your position and doubt God's love for you and what is that that lie do fear anxiety separation it'll actually cause you to separate from fellowship and separate from your brethren yes you'll go into a cave and you'll go into a hole you're bound up with emotional damage and baggage and you feel like nobody cares nobody's coming after me nobody's seeking me out God's letting this happen and these things keep happening and it's a cycle and this and this this and what's bringing the separation is you're believing a lie because the truth will make you free truth will make you free when you begin to find yourself in bondage fearful anxious wanting to separate when you find yourself there I want to clue you in on something when you find yourself in that spot there's a lie somewhere yes there's a lie somewhere because the truth doesn't do that remember Elijah after the Mount Carmel Showdown Elijah stood on the word of God he stood on the truth and he stood there and God had showed him a vision and he did exactly what God showed him and and the the fire came down it licked up the water licked up the sacrifice the stones and all amen they took the prophets of Baal they slew them he had a mighty victory and then a woman says something contrary to the word about Elijah I'm going to do to you the same as you did to them and what does he do he starts to believe the lie and what does he do when he believes a lie he goes into depression brother B tells us about this he starts to get depressed he starts to separate he goes off by himself he even separates amen from fellowship with his servant and he goes off by himself amen and and he falls asleep and God's so tender with him and he knows that he's just overworked he's over tired amen and that's when the Devil comes to us so many times with a lie is when we're already exhausted when we've been fighting sickness when we've been going through a hard time what does he do he comes and he slides that lie in because he knows you're already physically weak and physically weak brings your spiritual man into weakness and that's when you're the most susceptible and comes in and God is so tender with him and bakes him cakes and and does all this but but then he goes he goes off to the cave and in the cave his mindset hasn't changed yet even though God's merciful and watching over his tired servant he's still believing lies amen he's believing this thing about Jezebel and now he's in the cave and and God says what are you doing here Elijah and he begins to tell him and and then he has the you know the story of the fire and the earthquake and the wind and but then there was a still Small Voice and he came out the still small voices and he said again what doest thou here Elijah and he says they seek my life and I'm the only one left that's serving you lie what was causing his depression what was causing his separation what was causing him to leave his commission and pull away the reason is cuz he was believing a lie if Elijah can suffer that way what about you and I if it if those lies worked on him do you think the same devil who's been lying deceiving a third of the angels in heaven and casting them down with his lie you think he stopped lying to the children of God no he's good at it brother B said he's good at mixing truth facts truth he even mixes some scriptures in there like he did for Ahab mixes some scriptures together and some facts together and he puts the pieces together and he presents it to you as truth but there's a little bit of a lie mixed in so now the whole thing's tainted and it's not going to bring freedom it's not going to be bring life it's not going to bring peace it's not going to settle your spirit it's not going to give you Faith to overcome it's going to frighten you cause separation damnation depression destruction everything that it did to Elijah so Elijah starts saying they seek my life life and I've been faithful and and I'm the only one that's left and God doesn't really even deal with that he says listen I've called you to do this this this and this go do it get back in your commission why did you ever leave your commission why did you separate why did you run away why are you out here hiding in a cave Elijah Elijah was hiding in a cave because he believed a lie he believed Jezebel had the power and authority to take his life before God determined that it was time for him to go that's right right and he believed that he was the only one serving God and so God dropped brother say God breaks a seal for Elijah he breaks a seal what's that revealing truth and he said there's 7,000 who haven't bowed in na you're wrong Elijah you're only looking at facts that you can see you're not realizing the truth and so God really he doesn't baby on Elijah too much he was good to him under the juniper tree he fed him but when he starts a dialogue with him at the cave he just says what are you doing and then he gives us explanation he doesn't answer it and then he asks him again and he tells him no there's 7,000 and he says go do this this and this get back to work nothing has changed I haven't changed my mind you haven't lost your position I'm still watching over you you're just as protected as you was on Mount Caramel you have just as much of a history as you did there amen nothing has changed it's only in your mind because you believed a lie amen Jesus said to God when he was praying over the disciples he said sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth where do I find the truth in the word that's where I find the truth let's turn with me to Joshua 14 Joshua 14 in Joshua 14 let's go to verse 7 in verse 7 Caleb comes before Joshua to get his portion his allotment of the promised land and Joshua 14:7 he said 40 years old was I when Moses th the servant of the Lord sent me from kades barnea to aspy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in Mine Heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I holy followed the Lord my God what he say I believed the word that's what he's saying and Moses swear on that day saying surely the land where on thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou Hast wholly followed the Lord my God and now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 40 and5 years even since the Lord spake his word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day 4 scor and 5 years old he's 85 years old it's been 45 years since the day he spied out the land tried to tell the truth to his brethren said I am this day four score and 5 years old and yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so my strength is now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain whereof the Lord spake in that day for thou heardest that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said what's what's he doing 45 years later he's still standing on the word and and standing on the word he was just as strong standing on the promise 45 years L later as he was the day he said it first time amen he believed the word when it came out of Moses's lips he believed it in the wilderness Journey when he comes to kades Baria no matter what the facts were he believed the true report of God's promised word that I will give you this land and you will drive out the inhabitants it doesn't matter if there's walled cities and if there's iron chiots and if there's Giants in the land it can't change the truth that wall city is a lie you can go up and knock on it boy it feels real it feels like the truth it looks like the truth but it's different than the word it's a lie it looks like it's impenetrable it looks like it can't fall down it looks like we're short and they're tall it looks like I can't get within a Spear's reach of that giant there's no way I can get to him and kill him there's no way I can get inside that gate I there's no way I can climb those walls amen those are all facts but the facts are not the truth because the word is the truth and the truth is you shall possess the land and I will drive out the inhabitants and here Caleb at 85 years old waiting 45 years on the promise and 45 years later he said I'm just as strong today as I was the day that Moses sent me to spy out the land you understand this is absolutely Supernatural what was it it was the effect of believing the truth this is the difference between believing a lie and believing a truth all who believed the LIE were dead and buried at this day that Caleb saying not only am I alive I'm every bit as strong as I was the day I believed it Hallelujah the word kept my strength the word preserved my strength he was strong in what in faith praise be to God let us cast down all lies let us cast down all reasoning let us cast down everything that's contrary to the promised word we've received in this hour and see it as a lie I'm going to read to you Psalms 1171 Psalms 1171 oh praise the Lord all ye nations praise him all you people for his merciful kindness is great towards us and the truth of the Lord endureth forever Praise You the Lord if he promised it it's still true if it's ever been true it's always true if it's true for another it's true for me if I was ever part of his mind I'm always part of his mind if I'm ever part of his elect I'm always part of his if I was ever an attribute I'm always an attribute nothing's going to change that it doesn't matter how much rejection I go through it doesn't matter how many obstacles I have to cover it doesn't matter how many things go wrong in my life it doesn't matter how sick I and Afflicted I am it cannot change that truth that I was in his mind before the foundation of world I'm part of God and there's not a thing that will ever change that truth there'll be many a days we have many days we don't feel like the elect predestinated seat of God we feel like dirt under somebody's shoe is that right we feel worse than the slug that you squashed when you stepped off the sidewalk in the morning sometimes we feel like absolute dirt we feel horrible we want to go stick our head in the ground somewhere we want to climb in a cave and never see Humanity again has anybody else been there when you're in that condition you're a predestinated c Gene of God a child of God God and he loves you and he had thoughts of you before the foundation of the world and his thoughts were of good and not of evil to bring you to an expected end and nothing will change that no matter how you feel about it your feeling about it doesn't change it deny the feelings they're lying to you your feelings lie they lie all the time they lie uh they lie they're they habitual Liars your five senses and all your feelings and your emotions they're habitual liars and cannot stop from lying that's right amen so don't believe the senses believe the word don't believe your eyesight believe the word don't believe what you hear believe the word don't believe what you feel believe the word praise be to God the LIE always brings destruction fear anxiety separation and death but Freedom only comes by the word and the word is truth my people shall know the truth and the truth shall make them free and if you're not feeling free and the question is what lie am I believing if you're not experiencing Freedom if you're not able to identify with freedom there's a lie working somewhere say God please expose the lies expose the lies that are challenging your word expose the lies that are pulling us back expose the lies that are causing us to want to leave our commission and leave our position expose those lies in Judges chapter 6 let's turn on further in our Bible to go to judges Judges chapter 6 judges 6 And1 and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was in ofra that pertaineth into joash the ezer right and his son Gideon threshes Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him thou the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee and he said unto him oh my Lord wherewith shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in manasse and I am the least in my father's house oh we set up a struggle right away immediately Gideon amen is struggling with the truth because the angel of the Lord brought him the truth and the truth was you're a mighty man of Valor well that was a shock Revelation to Gideon because Gideon had a lifetime of believing he was the least in his father's house and his father's house was the least in Israel so he had a lifetime of believing a lie about himself because God did not decide that day that Gideon was a mighty man of Valor God predestinated Gideon to be a mighty man of Valor in God's mind he was always a mighty man of Valor he was always chosen he was always elected he was always God's choice but he grew up in an environment where he was the least in his father's house he was the least in Israel and Israel was under the bondage of the midianites they all believed that they were forsaken of God they all believed that there was no more miracles and because they didn't see anything else they didn't believe God was there anymore and they didn't believe God cared about them anymore and under the bondage of Midian they all these things became the truth to Gideon it became true that God's forsaken us it became true that because we don't see any more signs God's not with us it became true amen that that God delivered us to the midianites and we're always going to be this way and I'm the least in the father's house and the least in the kingdom and and here I am hiding beside the wine press to thresh out little weat to hide it from the midianites because I have no strength to keep my crops I have no strength to get the fruit of the land God gave me I have no strength I'm weak we have no ability God's not here there's nothing I can do so I'm hiding to get a little wheat and that was the truth that Gideon believed so when the angel of the Lord came to Gideon to give him a true identification the angel of the Lord said hail there Mighty Man of Valor what was that that was nothing but the truth but what did Gideon think who are you talking to what he was hiding behind he was hiding behind the w r press I can just imagine say who else is here no it's you Gideon it was addressed to you the message is to you the messenger was to you the angel was talking to you thou Mighty Man of Valor and he says but then why this and then why this and then why that and you know what he doesn't answer all the silly questions where have you been and why is a midi and nice and why are no he doesn't answer any of that because God knows exactly what he's doing and he's always on time and nothing nothing's out of cater it's exactly as it's meant to be so he doesn't answer all of our foolish questions why did you let this happen and why did I go through this and why this rejection and why was my dad this way and why did I grow up in a home like this and why did you let me make this mistake God may not even answer those silly questions because everything's working right on time it'll come to an expected end because the questions are accusations veiled that God you didn't and you could have and you should have and why not the questions are veiled accusations yes instead of saying you do everything well I don't understand why my life went this way I don't understand why it started this way I don't understand why I had so much baggage you want to talk about baggage Gideon is coming to his commission with a lifetime of baggage they have been servants under a stronger Nation who's been robbing them year after year and their forefathers keep telling them they go to church they go to synagogue and forefathers say we're the chosen of the Lord he loved us above all other nations we are the apple of his eye and you go on the midi and stomp in and take everything you got and take it away and you're left destitute ragged with nothing left and the preaching started sounding like a lie have you ever sat in church and the preaching didn't sound like it fit you don't believe a lie don't believe a lie if you believe a lie the LIE has an effect the LIE brings results the LIE brings death spiritual death separation it brings anxiety it brings fear it brings torment Gideon's life was a lie and he had a photo album to prove it all he has facts exhibits A through Z then A1 through Z1 and A2 through Z2 you get the point he had all kinds of reasonings to justify why he wasn't a mighty man of Valor why why things weren't good in Israel why uh this this isn't going to work and God just tells him go on go on he says in verse 14 and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee that's the truth he said how am I going to save Israel I'm poor my family's poor and I'm the least in my father's house oh Gideon stop looking at lies Gideon has a hard time believing so he asked the Lord for a fleece remember this the next thing he says if these things be true then I'll lay at this fleece and let the Dew fall in it but not on the ground and and he went out and he rung it out and the next day it was changed and God was good to Gideon because Gideon was God's chosen wasn't like Gideon was going to go to God was going to go to plan B there was no plan B Gideon was it cuz Gideon's part of the word and God's not changing his word it was part of the word when it was played out in the mind of God before the foundation of the world he's not changing no matter what Gideon thinks or how Gideon feels or how much Gideon struggles God's not changing out Gideon Gideon is part of the word it's not changing so God in his goodness to Gideon he begins to give him he begins to give him a little something extra I'm so thankful God gives us something extra sometimes sometimes we're so down and so beat down and we struggled so much and we can't seem to overcome the lies in our lives I thank God he'll always send something extra a little Supernatural nudge a little something that only you know only he knows you know so that you know that he knows Amen to give you the courage amen you know it's those super little Supernatural things amen those things don't bring the promise to pass all they do is encourage your faith to believe the word that's already there to believe who you already are just because God does something Supernatural in your life doesn't make you bride amen you were bride from before the foundation of the world whether anything Supernatural happens or not amen it's not those things that make you who you are that's just because God said Gideon said I'll lay at the fleece and do this and that wow it worked did it again wow it worked maybe I am a warrior it wasn't the doe Falling by his request that made him anything he was already in the mind of God the Mighty Man of Valor and the deliverer of Israel but God did something extra for him Amen to get him to step past the lies to get him to put down the doubts and get him to believe what the angel already said it wasn't new truth it wasn't something else amen it give him the courage to believe what was already [Applause] said may God encourage our faith may God do those little extra things for us that help us to say he knows he knows where I am and he knows what I'm struggling with may it give us the courage to say I accept what he says we know that Gideon went out and there was a mighty delivery brought through the hand of Gideon the least in his father's house poor of the House of manasse under bondage all of his life feeling like the preaching didn't work and the truth truth weren't true for him anymore but when he accepted what the angel said about him yes he became what God always ordained him to be he stepped into the rule and God used him to deliver Israel the devil is a liar problem is he's good at it he's a good liar can we say it that way he's a very good liar he'll use he'll use the Scrapbook of your photo album and show you pictures Turn the Page remember this oh remember that remember this you're nothing you can't be there's no way it applies to you remember that when that happened oh come here come here let me show you this that has nothing to do with it the word was true from before the foundation of the world it ever remains true it will always be true it's not true because I feel like it's true it's true because it's true and when I don't feel like it's true it's true when I feel like it's true that doesn't make it true I'm just my feelings finally lined up with the truth praise God brother Benham says one time in uniting sign uniting time and sign this is in August of 1963 he says one of the main things that's always hurt me through my life has been a nervous condition that when I get so worn and I get real weary kind of feel like nobody cares for you you know this is the prophet of God after he preached the seals you know what after he preach the seals he knows he's the seventh angel he knows he's ma he's Malachi 4 he also knows that he's Revelation 10:7 no doubt about it there's nobody no way the seals could open until that angel was present on Earth he says so emphatically he's got a revelation of who he is he know he's saved he's know he's filled with the Holy Ghost and he knows the true revelation of God but yet he gets the feeling like nobody cares about him you know you have it too I say Amen you just happen to I just happen to have a real overdose of it you know and it gets real bad sometimes I I love this I love this I love the fact that he come and tell us this so that when we get it real bad sometimes we don't feel like I can't be part of God's program cuz no matter how much brother bham felt like nobody cared for him and he had it bad real bad it didn't change the fact that he was the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 that he was the seventh angel and he was on Earth and he was the one that God sent the seals to didn't change it just the way he felt said I get real bad sometime and I can hardly it's tension and that's what does it I get to a spot then that many times especially with so many of those Visions you see it just gets me I look at a person I think this is Aion no no no it isn't yes yes it is you see and you don't realize what a price goes with that so then you wonder then you get to thinking well then you get off on your side and say well now what uh uh uh what have I done here I am 50 years old I've done nothing for the Lord I'm getting old oh my then you just get what we used to call the blues what is the blues it's depression I mean it may be a minor form it's not clinical depression but it's depression once you have the Holy Ghost you'll never feel blue again once you catch the revelation of the word praise God you know what I love I love honesty and truth and reality he goes we used to call it the blues some of you Brethren about my age remember what they used to call having the blues pop used to talk about it I wondered what he meant I sure know I sure know now what he meant so then you get to feeling that way which is none of it true amen it's just you and you know it see you know it it's just you doing that listen the reason I wanted to read this quote is because this is life this is The Human Experience that we're subject to still living in Fallen bodies with Fallen human spirits and Fallen Minds amen we still fall into this category sometimes but what did Brother Brenham had to do he was falling into that right then he had got overworked he's talking about he had overworked too many Visions too many meetings he got under a bunch of tension and he got feeling low he got feeling blue and he started feeling like nobody cares about me nobody loves me amen and he talks about this in more than one place and when he gets down to that spot what does he have to do he has to proclaim the truth and you know that's not true that's just you doing that that's just me that's not the reality that's just an emotional response that's just the way I'm feeling why because we have to identify the lie and we have to say that's not true you know what happen would happen if he get into this spot and get feeling down and get feeling blue and feel like nobody cares about him you know what would happen if he wouldn't confess something different he would fall all the way into depression because he would give over to that Spirit that's trying to plague his mind and get him to believe a lie and the LIE is nobody cares about you and nobody loves you amen and you're rejected amen cuz this is a boy who's suffering from a rejection complex from childhood and now you're rejected and nobody loves you and nobody cares about you and if he would have started repeating that nobody cares about me nobody loves me what would he be doing he'd be confessing his feelings and his feelings are a lie and he would be confessing a lie and he would be walking in that lie and then that lie would bring separation and depression and fear and anxiet Y and turmoil and he would be fullblown in the seed of depression but what's he say it's none of it's true hallelujah it's not true I feel like it's true but it's not true if feels real but it's not real it feels true but it's not true why how can you say it's not true amen because it doesn't matter what anybody says or what my emotions tell me God loves me he loved me before the foundation of the world and if God before me who can be against me what does it matter and besides that God's children love me because the word says they will not because I feel like they love me but because the word says there'll be love of the Brethren and they'll have love for one another unfeigned love of the Brethren you may feel like there's not a soul in the world that loves you but that's not true that's just a feeling you may feel like everybody's turned their back on you you know brother Bram felt that way he comes to preach a message called the present stage of my Ministry Deus has forsaken me he feels like the the the so many people have walked away the denominations have walked away the Full Gospel businessmen are pulling back from him amen and he's feeling this rejection and he's showing that there has to be a pattern of this in the word but the reality nothing has changed in the ministry he starts to say that's not the end of the ministry it's not washed up it's the crowning of the ministry it's part of the word it's the the reality is God is crowning this ministry why because he was confessing the word not what he was feeling none of it's true none of it's true Romans 3:4 says let God be true and every man a liar let God be true and every man a liar even the things you feel and think if it's contrary to the word it's a lie and let it be a lie call it a lie amen say I I feel like I'm completely rejected that's a lie call it a lie don't accept it as true don't confess it as true don't speak it as though it's true that's contrary to the Bible how can you as a son or daughter of God take these lips that we ordained to speak the truth truth and speak a lie amen based off a feeling God help us forgive us for ever doing that and help me God never to do it again but help me to speak the word when every sense in me tells me that it's not true let me deny the senses and take the truth of your word I have been accepted in the Beloved when was I accepted in the Beloved when I was a good boy and everybody patted me on the back and I was doing that I was accepted before the foundation of the world I've been accepted in the Beloved before the foundation of the world I'm still accepted in the Beloved and when I'm laying in my bed crying because I'm depressed and I'm hurt because of things people said I'm still accepted in the Beloved my pillow may be wet at night but it doesn't change the condition of my soul and it doesn't change my position with God that is a lie and I can't help that this body feels it and I can't help that it reacts to it and I can't help that it hurts and I can't help that I cry but I can help what comes out of my mouth and help me to only confess the truth not the lie that is nothing but a lie I'm forsaken God doesn't see me it doesn't ever work out for me it works for everybody else but it doesn't work for me uh lies don't say them anymore unless you want separation depression fear anxiety and torment if that's what you're looking for keep saying those things cuz that's exactly what you're going to get but if you speak the truth hallelujah if you speak the truth and make the truth your bread make the truth your reality make it your speech am deny the LIE listen you may not walk out of that circumstance the first minute or the first hour but the reality is you're going to walk out of that circumstance because the word is true you know there's no condition in your life that has remained every day of your life I mean except being hybrid and all that things change they don't stay the same forever circumstances change situations change things change they change amen but the LI is it's going to be this way forever and it's going to change anyways and when it changes you're going to have to go back and say God I'm sorry for all those things I said let's just say God help me not to say any of those things brother Benham in perfect Faith he preaches this is a week after the last quote I read about having the blues said how many of you will be waiting over till the morning that's got a long distance to go I appreciate that that effort some of you will drive home tonight cuz you got to go to work by daylight in the morning and I know it's hard and then when I think I see that I get spells too you know I get moody I get to a spot where what gets me is where I get to those spells when I get all overworked and Satan comes telling me why nobody cares for you you you really haven't got a friend in the world see amen remember I'm not immune to Temptation see I got to overcome that you know brother said overcome it not give into it you realize what he's saying it comes he gets it he feels it he doesn't give into it it's a temptation the thing is it's become so normal in some of our Lives we accept it as a reality and not recognizing it's a test it's a Temptation the devil's tempting you to speak against the word or speak contrary to the word you don't see it as a Temptation you see it as a life condition and because you see it as a life condition you claim it as a life condition you speak it as a life condition and it remains a life condition and it brings depression and separation and anxiety and fear and all the things that lies bring but it's a test to see what you'll do with the word I'm not immune to the Temptation I got to overcome that then when I look back and see something like this I put it right back in his face and say what about that that helps me to overcome what about that what he's saying is all the people come to hear him they stayed late they have to drive back and go right to work as soon as they get there they stay over they drive hours you know what brother bam said saying I'm using that as ammunition against the LIE of the devil I'll say God what about that what about those people not God but Satan what about those people who come to hear what about you're a liar what's he doing he's fighting back against the lie and if we want to overcome we've got to fight back against a lie we can't confess it and accept it and declare it and keep walking in it we've got to say what the word says not what our feeling say amen I asked brother Franco to put together a video if we could go ahead and start bringing that up I want to I want to go through a video and and something struck my heart amen and I wanted to share with you something from the prayer line This is a a small section we're going to show about one minute of the Chicago campaign it's one of the few videos we have of brother brandham and discernment in the prayer line and I want I want you to catch this and like I said it's going to be about 1 minute approximately one minute but it is a super profound one minute and so whenever it comes up we can just go right into it and and brother V was going to talk to a woman I want you to watch your hands all right excuse me sister I have to relax my mind once in a moment now we are be strangers I see that you are strictly stranger to me yes sir you're from away from here yes sir you come from another city yes sir you've got a lot of trouble on your heart you got hard trouble to begin with is that right there's a whole lot of Blackness I see a black sheep keep following you like that or it's a lie somebody's told a lie on you and that was a man was professing Divine Healing yes sir he said you was a witch is that true and you got a whole stir in your church or something other about it is that right your pastor is sick right now he's got polio is that right sister don't pay no attention what them people tell you they're a lying and the only thing's wrong with your heart is that nervous condition got your heart work up go on home in peace and God bless you you're all right God thank you're not over I say praise God the prophet under discernment she's coming up to discernment she's got trouble in her life he says you got a lot of trouble on nervous and you got a lot of trouble in your heart and you got a heart condition here comes a woman to him she's getting prayed for and I don't know what her main request was what did she had in her mind but one of the things was a heart condition and and and what's happening brother B Discerning God's Discerning through the prophet he says you I see a black sheet following you a black sheet following you think she couldn't feel that you think it wasn't affecting her life you think that black sheet had no effect on her emotionally you think had no effect on her daily I see a black sheet it's a lie what was the woman suffering with she was suffering the effect of a lie amen it was a lie he says there's nothing wrong with your heart the only thing wrong with your heart is that nervousness has your heart all worked up what was making her nervous somebody told a lie on her when she's standing here before the prophet her hands are ringing the entire time before he gets to this discernment he starts talking to the congregation for a minute or so and she's here ringing her hands the whole time she's a nervous wreck what's making her so nervous is somebody told a lie about her it was a man professing Divine Healing and she was struggling with whether that lie was true I don't know how much she accepted or not but it set about an effect in her amen that had her nervous and had her heart all worked up and brother bham he looks right at her and said that's a lie and then he says don't you pay no attention to what those people are saying they're a liying he says you're all right you're fine amen then he shakes her hand and and then she walks off the platform and as she walks he turns to her and says you're not a witch what do you think that did to that sister when the prophet of God under it if he could know all of those things if he could know what happened and about your life and what was said wouldn't God also be able to say you're not a witch she walked off of there and she knew beyond a shadow of a doubt she was not a witch amen you think she had any more heart problems you think she was ringing her hands anymore amen there was a few seconds where a truth dispelled the lie and her problems went away you know what else she didn't pray and brother brandham didn't pray he never prayed for her he didn't need to pray for her there was nothing wrong with her she didn't need healing she didn't need prayer she needed the truth am amen you know what we need more than anything we need the truth friends we need to line up with this truth and confess the truth amen we we go to prayer because we need it to become real we need everything else to get quiet we need to spend time getting the things out of our minds that are lying to us so that we can come in line with the word but what brings Deliverance is the truth amen when the truth is believed it brings Deliverance oh praise God and Psalms 120 verse one it says in my distress I Cried unto the Lord and he heard me deliver my soul oh Lord from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue what did is what he need delivered from lying lips here comes a woman who had a lie told on her you know many of us have had lies told on us but you know there's there's two different kinds of Lies there's direct lies and indirect lies there's a direct lie when somebody says something right to you and right about you or it's completely false but there's an indirect lie and I'll just share it with you this way somebody does something to do or you get caught up in a circumstance a situation and the Devil comes and interprets that situation to you as meaning XYZ so in the four year the brother didn't make eye contact you and he didn't shake your hand that means he doesn't want to talk to you anymore that's a lie when you believe that lie that lie will take effect that lie will bring separation that lie will bring destruction that lie will bring torment what will set you free the truth the truth no matter what's going on with that brother what he meant to do or didn't mean to do doesn't change anything he's my brother and the word ever remains true see when we believe things like that about one another when we believe that we begin to act out what we believe and it causes more and more separation and we create sometimes our own reality by believing the LIE instead of believing the truth but if we believe the truth then my brother didn't mean it or uh uh he didn't mean it he must have missed it he's still my brother he loves me we have unfeigned love for the brother the next time you see him you're just going to love him you're just going to hug him you're going to act like nothing happened and guess what nothing will happen nine times out of 10 that doesn't mean there's never issues there's always things going on but I'm talking the majority of the time it was an interpretation of events that led you to believe a lie and when you believe the lie the LIE brings the same destruction lie always bring but what will set you free when you choose to take the truth over the LIE when you come to church and act like everybody in here loves you and you can't wait to talk to them and hug him guess what that's going to become the reality you live in when you come to church believing everybody's rejected you and they don't care about and they don't really love you and they guess what that's the reality you're going to live in choose the word choose the word confess the word speak the word and if you don't feel it say it brother B said say it till you believe it same thing with healing amen you believe the doctor you'll die you believe the word you'll live I say speak the word we not stop talking about everything the doctor said the doctor said this and the doctor said that the doctor probably 6 months and probably may die and 20% chance and just keep repeating that all the time and see what happens to your heart or say well the doctor's got his ideas he's looking at this but I'm looking at a promise that by his stripes I am already healed and that I choose to confess amen it's not wrong to tell somebody what the doctor said that's not wrong what's wrong is to go tell everybody what the doctor said and only say what the doctor said and quit confessing what Dr Jesus said amen and then you start to believe that lie and when you start to believe that lie you start to has an effect on you and it'll separate you from the truth and it'll bring despair discouragement depression in your life and then then listen when we get into these situations then it becomes everybody else's fault There's No Love in the church nobody's coming to my the problem is the LIE it's a lie it's a lie believe the truth confess the truth say it till you believe it say it till it becomes a reality in your life I want the truth this woman who was called a witch she walked on a platform struggling with whether or not she's a witch why did they say that what did it mean the man has gifts in his life and he said that and the church is stirred up and whatever is going on you can only imagine what was in her mind I don't know but you can only imagine if you were in her spot what would you be thinking ringing her hands coming before a prophet and she walks up in despair nervous believing she has a heart condition in desperate need of prayer and guess what she doesn't get any prayer she doesn't need need prayer she doesn't need prayer she needs the truth she needs to believe the truth she needs to know the truth she needs to know that that was a lie and that God hasn't changed his mind about her that what he thought of her is always still the same truth that he ever had and she's not a witch and she's fine and there's nothing wrong with her heart and she walked over there with no prayer but she walked over there delivered the truth shall make you free she got Deliverance where did she get Deliverance by the prophet laying hands on her by the words that he spoke by the prayer she got Deliverance by the truth amen remember the we've been talking a lot and the brothers have too about the woman who washed jesus' feet she was a prostitute stuck in bondage had a horrible life amen but she gave everything to come to Jesus and wash his feet and guess what she gave it all and washed his feet what was she doing she was recognizing that this is the Messiah this is the word and she was giving her all to the word amen and Jesus looked at her and says all your sins are forgiven you oh guess what she didn't pray and Jesus didn't pray what was her Deliverance the truth the truth when she came to the truth the truth set her free all her sins were forgiven not because she prayed three hours not because she went to the altar not because she went to the temple and made a sacrifice not because she paid great sums of money and not because Jesus laid hands on her and prayed for her he never touched her all he did was recognize her faith her faith in the truth set her free it was the truth that set her free remember Jesus he comes by has needs to go by Samaria there's a woman there stuck in a bad condition as well amen she's got all kinds of lies in her life is that true how many lies were in the woman who washed his feet how many lies has she believed about herself I'm I can never be one of I'll never be accepted I'm an outcast I'm the woman in Samaria she has to come to a well at a certain time of day cuz she can't come with the other women she's an outcast she's no doubt have lies of her own I mean she's been through five husbands and she's with another man that's not her own that woman's believing some lies she's in bondage she's in tur she's in turmoil she's in that's the result of Lies but she comes in contact with the person of truth and the person of Truth to tell her the truth and when he tells her the truth woman the hour cometh and now is when when the father seeketh such as worship Him and spirit and in truth it's all he said she stood there and thought about that she said we know that when messiah's cometh he'll tell us these things and he said I that speaketh unto you am he amen that was the truth you know what she did she sat there the disciples come around it says she left her water Pond she was trying to get sustaining water she was going back to the traditional well of the father but she left her pot and went running into a city and says come see a man that told me everything I've ever done is did not this the Messiah brother bam said she was saved she didn't pray she didn't kneel down she didn't fold her hands she didn't go to church she was saved she was delivered and she became a mouthpiece for the Messiah how what set her free is when she accepted the truth over the LIE it set her free and broke the bondage that she was under remember zakus zakus amen we know zakus was not a well-liked or respected man and he was a bit of a Shyer and he was a tax collector and he climbed up in a tree to see the Lord and the Lord looked up and so and said today zakus I'm coming to your house and he comes into Zak as's house amen and what a difference it makes when Jesus comes to zaki's house versus Simon's house Simon left him in a corner un the truth was right there and he left him in a corner and left him rejected zachus who's not a religious man zakus not respected zakus was a liar and a thief amen zakus has got the Lord at his table too only in the presence of Truth what is Zakia to he stands up and says he says I I I'm sorry this is what zakus does I'm sorry for my life anything that I've taken any dishonesty I'm going to restore it and if I taking anything dishonestly I'll restore it four times over zakus didn't go to church zakus didn't pray and Jesus didn't pray for him but Jesus says this day salvation has come to this house cu the truth set zakus free the person of Truth came to his house and he had the ability to stand up and confess his sin and expose his sin and that the Bible says if you cover your sin it will remain it'll destroy you but if you expose your sin you'll be free it was the truth that set zakus free the person of Truth came and he was willing to live the truth speak the truth expose the lie in his life he'd been stealing money he'd been being dishonest he'd been cheating people out tax money and he didn't need Jesus to say zakus I see you last Saturday and you were at such and such a loc and you the tally sheet said this and you scratch he didn't need that he knew he was wrong he knew what was hiding in his life he knew where he was being dishonest he knew it the Pharisees knew it too but they kept it under a cloak of religion the Pharisees knew they were stealing from widows the Pharisees knew they were bending the law to serve their own purpose the Pharisees knew all those but they broughten their the fla trees and they blew trumpets and they gave money and they sang hymns and they went to church and they gave up and what were they doing they were hiding the LIE they were living a lie they were a lie and they were hiding it behind religion it's still a lie their life was a lie and that lie brings death that's right nobody has to point out the things that are in your heart nobody has to point out your hidden or secret sin nobody needs to come out don't wait for somebody to come out and say say I had a dream the other day brother and that you know good and well just let Jesus Come into your house and stand up and say God I've done this and I've done this and and I'm going to be repent I'm going to restore and I'm going to make it right and Jesus says this day salvation why the truth set zakus free not just the truth sitting there but when he was willing to become the Truth live the truth speak the truth and expose his own life how many people claim to be Believers and are bound and depressed and separated and tormented and struggling amen because why you're keeping something buried behind a cloak of religion saying you're in the message and you got quotes and there's something buried in your heart that you absolutely know is not right I I I I commission you in the name of Jesus Christ amen you expose that to God and say God I'm not going to live like this anymore amen I want the truth cuz the truth will set me free you cannot put truth over top of life and expect life cuz there's still a lie underneath you cannot put the message over top the lie in your heart and expect to have life and truth and freedom you've got to expose the lie to the truth and bring it to the light CU those that are of the truth love the light the truth shall set us free the LIE whether it's a lie you believe whether it's a lie that's told or whether it's a lie you live the LIE brings death separation anxiety depression torment but the truth shall set you free brother I sister I tell you right now the truth shall set you free whatever lie the devil's caused you to believe or caused you to live or whatever whatever it is don't wait for me to name everyone just be true be honest be real right because the truth shall set you free sir Jesus says when the comforters come he's the spirit of Truth and he said he'll guide you into all truth why because he's not going to lead you into a lie but it'll lead you away from the LIE into the truth because the truth will make you free we want to be free we want to have freedom we want to be free but it's simple the truth will set you free the LIE brings bondage the LIE brings corruption the LIE brings deception depression anxiety separation but the truth will set us free when the church was all bound up by Creeds and dogmas and the Holy Ghost was bound by these rivers of denomination and dogmas God was going to come and loose the Holy Spirit the spirit of Truth the guide he was going to loose the church that was bound by Creeds and dogmas and how did Jesus come in this generation and loose his bride and loose the Holy Ghost he did it by bringing the truth he opened the seals he sent a prophet to reveal the truth to tie back the Loose Ends to reveal the mden mystery of God and what did the truth do it freed us from the denominational strongholds and broke the chains that were binding us and keeping us down and it set us free how did Freedom come in this day by the truth how will freedom come to your individual circumstance in life by the truth it's the truth that will set you free brother Benham says I want to read this last quote as we close this is out of the invisible Union of the bride of Christ says now notice the anointed word of his day of which you are a part by predes destination you immediately like knew when you heard that you knew right quick that you was an eagle you also realized that you wasn't a denominational chicken to begin with you know there's something wrong there there's something wrong that's right for you know what you were trapped into at the beginning all of a sudden a true Eagle scream comes and something in you says that's the truth he says he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the Water by the church the congregation says no that don't sound right does it they say no you might find that in the almanac but not in God's Bible by the washing of the Water by the word in the word see you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning what is that that's the truth that's what the prophet brought that's what God wanted you to hear at this end time he wanted you to recognize that this true word that he s is a water of Separation to separate you from all the lies the lies you believed all your life the lies your parents told you the lies spouses told you the lies others told you amen the LIE the denomination told you there's a washing of the water of the true word that has come to wash all the lies off of us to set us free free to believe the word free to recognize who we are free to move into our position we're free by what the truth not emotions not feelg good not a a motivational speech but it's the word amen the truth has set us free amen some of us some of us some of you had parents who never valued you you have spouses who left you and forsook you you know what that that does that starts a lie amen that starts a lie that you're unlovable that you're no good and nobody wants you if you have a father who never knew how to connect to you emotionally or abandon the family when you were young amen he may never have come and said you're worthless but you know what you believed my own Daddy doesn't want to spend time with me I've been there not because my dad abandoned me but my parents were divorced when I was 5 years years old and I know those things you start to believe lies maybe it's my fault that they're not together maybe that maybe that and listen nobody spared from some of those circumstances nobody the devil starts early lying to you it might not be because somebody says that I hate you you're unlovable and nobody will ever like you it may not be that that was said but it may be the way your family treated you it dad treated the way mom treated you the way somebody else treated you and all of a sudden the lie that the devil whispered in your heart is that you're no good and nobody loves you and you're never going to amount to anything and you carry that lie like Gideon carried his lie but oh I've got good newsall the truth will still set you free you have to accept it you have to speak it you have to Proclaim it you have to claim it you have to stand on it you have to get under it and let it wash all the lies out of your heart amen and then when those Lies come back listen brother brandom in 1963 is struggling with lies that he had believed as a child being rejected in an outcast his father is an alcoholic and all of these things set up lies in his heart and now when he got under tension and overworked and circumstances happened that lie came back to him and he started feeling like nobody loves me nobody cares but you know what he didn't do he didn't say nobody loves me nobody cares he says that's not the truth it's not the truth it's nothing it's nothing true about it that's just me that's just my feeling but the truth is God loves me the truth is his people love me the truth is they travel from far and stay up late to come here what was he doing he was fighting back against the lie not giving into it not repeating it not allowing it to be truth he was pushing back with the truth we have to stop giving ear to the lie and stop letting the LIE come out of our mouth but we have to take the word and push against the lie with the truth if those people in that church know what kind of life you live before you come to church they would never accept you lie I'm the only one here that's been through this I'm the only one here that's that's a lie too if people really knew what I was like lie lie lie lie lie lie you know what that's all there to do it's all called to keep you in bondage and depression and separation and torment but the truth will set you free what truth that I'm accepted in the Beloved and if I'm accepted in the Beloved everybody else accepted in the Beloved is going to accept me because what's in me is in themall there may be tough circumstances we may have to work through a few things we we may have to make apologies and make things right but it doesn't change the truth the truth is you're loved you're highly favored amen the angel came to Mary and Mary was there amen she was just a young girl in a no-name place from a no-name uh situation and she was going to get married and who knows what she's been told all her life she might have been told you know you're kind of an odd person you're a little different her mom might have said you know if you would change this and this you know some boys might marry you I don't know but that's happened to people you know what that starts to do in people makes a lie I'm not nobody wants me my mom thinks that I'm not attractive and if I did this different that starts a lie and a girl starts to believe that lie she has to change something about her appearance herself Amen to trct that's a lie who knows what Mary had heard who knows what she went through who knows if she was rejected not reject rejected but something happened when she went to the well that day when the angel Gabriel came to her he gave her a true identification he said behold thou highly favored of the Lord it didn't matter at that moment it didn't matter what anybody else had ever said about her if it was her mom if it was her dad if it was an old boyfriend if it was her siblings it did not matter anymore because God had called her highly favored and in the eyes of God she was highly favored chosen The Chosen vessel of God to bring forth Jesus Christ and I'm telling you today there's been an angel that has come to you that said behold highly favored of the Lord you say how do I know it's me because I believe it I heard the eagle scream something in me said that's nothing but the truth it wasn't my emotions it wasn't an education amen something in me responded to the word and what is that it's the Lord saying behold thou highly favored of the Lord You're The Chosen vessel to bring forth Christ in this generation it's you what you need to do is let it come out of your mouth don't be afraid because of the past because rejection because of feelings but take the word and say I've been chosen before the foundation of the world I am part of Christ and he's chosen me to manifest himself in this same time how do you know it I only have one indication and that's because I believe him that's it I don't have any other proof I don't have any other evidence I don't have birth records I don't have but I have faith and if Faith saved zakus and if Faith saved the woman at the well and if Faith saved the woman who washes feet then it's faith that has saved me and redeemed me because I've come to the same place they came to I came to the anointed word made manifest for the day and when I came to the living Jesus Christ the word for this day and I anointed and I washed it I respected and I believed it and I confessed my sins salvation has come this day the truth has set us free brother benam says we are standing I don't care where you feel like you're standing today you may feel like you're standing on the edge of a precipice about to fall you may feel like your whole world is getting ready to crash down you may feel like relationships are collapsing and works collapsing Comming you may I don't care where you feel like you're standing I'm going to tell you where a prophet said you're standing and I encourage you to believe what he said because it'll make you stand different in this day he said you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning but what about all those years and what about believing the false Doctrine and what about when I lived a life of pro what about when I lost my virginity what you are standing listen quit standing on the LIE and start standing on the truth you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now as we go off the air why did Brother BM say that because he was being recorded it was being broadcast on radio but oh it has a different meaning to me because there's a message that God was going to get to the prophet just before before the prophet went off the air this is this is November 25th of 1965 30 days before his accident oh God is good he said this is my message to the church now as we go off the air just in a minute you are standing if you are standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every jot every tit where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from those Shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place that means if you're standing with this word in this word upon this word it doesn't matter any of the lies from the past they're all lies the truth is you're standing Justified as if you never did it in the beginning why because the power is in the word to wash it all away if Jesus could look at the woman kneeling at his feet washing his feet and says your sins he said Simon her sins which are many yes are all forgiven if he could do it to that woman that day why can't he do it to you today why can't you come to his feet why can't you kiss his feet why can't you pour your life out of his feet why can't you anoint them amen with the most precious thing you got your whole life why can't you do that and expect the same results you're sin which were many are all forgiven you just as if you never did it in the first place that's what power has been Unleashed in this time that's the truth everything else is a lie oh praise be to God he said talk about a Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of praise God you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God can you say that about yourself why because a prophet said it about you if you're standing with the word on the word every amen every jot every TT you might say but I don't live it all amen he never asked about that he asked whether you believed it all you're saved by faith you're not saved by Duty by Creed by Dogma by Form you're saved by faith and when you have faith God supplies the spirit to live the word you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God and I know there'll be some of you tomorrow will say I don't feel like that's true stop saying the LIE stop confessing the lie you feel like feelings are lies amen come to the word to the promise this prophet's not just saying something it's not a cutesy phrase he's not trying to get a reaction out of the people he is speaking the truth just before he goes off the air he wants to leave this truth with the church you are the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ everything that happened before is a lie God this word has brought you back to your position amen every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and
