[17:55] we're praying for the services here and
[17:57] there
[17:58] and also i talked about the jonathan
[18:00] baumgartner i believe it was yesterday
[18:03] and his surgery was successful it went
[18:04] well the doctor was happy with it so
[18:07] he's he's in the recovery phase so don't
[18:09] forget to pray for him because a lot of
[18:11] pain and and for sister bessie as well
[18:13] they've got to go through the recovery
[18:15] the rehab and we just trust that god
[18:17] will keep them through it all amen
[18:19] uh we want to hear their testimony when
[18:21] they come out of that of what god has
[18:22] done for them
[18:24] now while we're standing let's look at
[18:25] hebrews chapter 12.
[18:27] we've looked at these scriptures we've
[18:29] looked at a few of them last sunday and
[18:31] and i want to keep going on this topic a
[18:33] little further
[18:34] hebrews chapter 12 verse 22
[18:40] but you are coming to mount zion and
[18:42] unto the city of the living god the
[18:44] heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable
[18:46] company of angels to the general
[18:48] assembly and church of the firstborn
[18:50] which are written in heaven into god the
[18:52] judge of all and to the spirits of just
[18:55] men made perfect
[18:56] and to jesus the mediator of the new
[18:58] covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[19:01] that speaketh better things than that of
[19:03] abel
[19:04] see that ye refuse not him that speaketh
[19:06] for if they escape not who refused him
[19:08] that spake on earth much more shall not
[19:11] we escape if we turn away from him that
[19:13] speaketh from heaven
[19:15] whose voice then shook the earth but now
[19:17] he hath promised saying yet once more i
[19:20] shake not the earth only but also
[19:23] heaven
[19:24] man god bless you as you take your seats
[19:27] may god bless us as we read his word
[19:31] when we look at this i want to focus in
[19:33] on
[19:35] verse 24
[19:37] and to jesus the mediator the new
[19:39] covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[19:41] that speaketh better things than that of
[19:43] abel and this is where brother branham
[19:45] uses that term the blood speaks and he
[19:48] and he makes the statement can the blood
[19:49] speak the blood speaks and he gets this
[19:52] from here in hebrews chapter 12 verse 24
[19:55] that that we've come to this position
[19:57] that we've come to is not to mount zion
[20:00] and to the ordinances we've come uh to i
[20:04] mean sorry not to uh mount sinai we're
[20:07] not coming to mount sinai we've not come
[20:08] to the order but we've come to a new
[20:10] place we've come to mount zion to the
[20:12] city of the living god the heavenly
[20:14] jerusalem to an innumerable company of
[20:16] angels to the general assembly in the
[20:18] church of the firstborn which are
[20:20] written in heaven and to god the judge
[20:22] of all and do the spirits have just been
[20:24] made perfect this is a this is a coming
[20:27] to a spiritual place amen not a physical
[20:30] not a natural but a spiritual place and
[20:32] to jesus the mediator the new covenant
[20:34] into the blood of sprinkling nobody says
[20:37] brother sprinkling amen it's not talking
[20:39] about
[20:41] the blood of sprinkling is a reference
[20:43] back to the old testament sprinkling of
[20:45] the blood and the spring sprinkling of
[20:47] the blood in the old testament was a
[20:49] sprinkling for purification so the the
[20:52] altar the things upon the altar all
[20:54] these things had to be sprinkled by
[20:56] blood amen blood mixed with water or
[20:58] just blood sometimes and the sprinkling
[21:01] of blood was for purification and so
[21:03] when it refers to we've come to the
[21:05] sprinkling amen and to the blood of
[21:08] sprinkling this is the blood of
[21:10] purification
[21:11] because this is what brings us
[21:13] purification and cleansing to the blood
[21:16] of sprinkling that speaketh better
[21:18] things than that of abel so let's go
[21:20] back to genesis chapter 4 and read
[21:24] this out of genesis 4 as we lay our
[21:26] foundation
[21:37] genesis chapter 4
[21:40] verse 6
[21:41] and the lord said unto cain why art thou
[21:43] wroth and why is thy countenance fallen
[21:46] if thou doest well shalt thou not be
[21:48] accepted and if thou doest not well send
[21:51] life at the door and unto thee shall be
[21:53] his desire and thou shalt rule over him
[21:55] and cain talked with abel his brother
[21:58] and it came to pass when they were in
[21:59] the field that cain rose up against abel
[22:02] his brother and slew him
[22:04] i wonder what they were talking about
[22:07] they were talking about the reason one
[22:08] offering was accepted and the other one
[22:10] was not accepted and that's to been the
[22:12] pattern from then on between the false
[22:14] vine and the true vine when the true
[22:16] vine declares the truth the false vine
[22:19] instead of surrendering to the truth and
[22:21] repenting it tries to destroy either the
[22:24] truth or the vessel bearing the truth
[22:26] and so because it cannot
[22:28] destroy the truth they're always going
[22:30] after the vessel amen that's declaring
[22:32] the truth so that set a pattern that's
[22:35] why genesis is the seed chapter seed
[22:37] book of the entire bible it sets the
[22:40] patterns and the patterns do not change
[22:44] he says and the lord said unto cain
[22:46] where is abel thy brother and he said i
[22:47] know not am i my brother's keeper and he
[22:50] said what hast thou done the voice of
[22:52] thy brother's blood crieth unto me from
[22:55] the ground
[22:56] and so this is
[22:58] what paul is referring to when he says
[23:00] the blood of spring speaketh better
[23:01] things than that of abel and where
[23:03] brother branham gets these terms uh the
[23:05] blood speaks so the blood the voice of
[23:07] thy brother's blood crieth unto me from
[23:10] the ground
[23:11] and we learned last time that it was
[23:13] crying against cain
[23:15] it was crying out against the
[23:18] the guilty it was it was a cry against
[23:20] the murderer against the guilty against
[23:22] the unrighteous and the voice of thy
[23:24] brother's blood crieth unto me from the
[23:26] ground and he was crying out against
[23:28] cain
[23:30] brother branham says in the token
[23:33] i want to look at the the
[23:36] blood speaks
[23:38] um and for a title to this morning i'd
[23:41] like to take the blood still speaks
[23:44] if you take that for a title the blood
[23:46] still speaks
[23:48] in the token message brother brandon
[23:50] preaches the token several times he
[23:51] reads the token that title or just token
[23:54] and he preaches it i don't i didn't look
[23:56] up how many times but he preaches it
[23:57] several times
[23:58] and this time he says the blood speaks
[24:00] did we say does the blood speak can it
[24:03] speak the token speak
[24:05] yes sir
[24:07] if we'd look in genesis 4 10 the voice
[24:09] of the blood of abel cried out against
[24:11] cain we find out in hebrews 12 24 that
[24:14] the blood of jesus christ speaks better
[24:16] things the blood speaks how can the
[24:19] chemistry speak
[24:20] it's the life that's in the blood that
[24:22] does the speaking
[24:24] this is the first principle in the in
[24:26] the lesson this morning i want to hang
[24:27] on to i want you to grab and hang on to
[24:30] how does the blood speak it's the life
[24:32] that's in the blood that does the
[24:33] speaking
[24:36] so the the blood of the blood of
[24:38] sprinkling which is the blood of jesus
[24:39] christ that was shed for us the blood of
[24:41] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[24:43] how does the chemistry speak it's not
[24:46] the chemistry it's it's the life that
[24:48] was in the blood that does the speaking
[24:51] it's the life that's in the blood that
[24:53] does the speaking the soul that was in
[24:54] cain that or in abel it was the life
[24:57] that was in christ that cries out better
[25:00] things
[25:01] than any
[25:02] again in the
[25:04] another one of the token messages
[25:06] he says it this way now we also find in
[25:09] hebrews the 12th chapter 24th verse that
[25:12] the new testament the blood speaks
[25:13] better things
[25:15] the blood is speaking then the blood has
[25:17] got a voice
[25:19] and the voice of the blood is the word
[25:22] that's the second principle we want to
[25:24] hang on to
[25:25] first that the chemistry doesn't speak
[25:27] the life that's in the blood does the
[25:28] speaking so the blood speaks so it's the
[25:31] life that's in the blood does the
[25:32] speaking and the voice of the blood is
[25:35] the word
[25:37] amen
[25:38] that's what makes it whether it's right
[25:40] or wrong the word is identified by the
[25:42] voice of the blood
[25:44] now listen the way it says this is just
[25:46] the next sentence
[25:48] the voice of the blood is the holy ghost
[25:50] [Music]
[25:52] but i thought you said the voice of the
[25:54] blood is the word now the voice of the
[25:56] blood is the holy ghost
[25:58] boy that might tell you how different
[26:00] the word and the holy ghost are
[26:03] the voice of the blood is the word the
[26:05] voice of the blood is the holy ghost so
[26:06] hang on to that too so the chemistry is
[26:09] not what speaks it's the life that was
[26:11] in the blood does the speaking and the
[26:12] voice of the blood is the word and the
[26:14] voice of the blood is the holy ghost
[26:16] so hang on to that
[26:18] the voice of the blood is the holy ghost
[26:21] that brings life
[26:23] it is life and it brings life to the
[26:26] word and quickens it
[26:29] sure the blood speaks it speaks a better
[26:31] thing the old testament the blood spoke
[26:33] of guilt in the new testament it speaks
[26:35] of redemption in the old testament it
[26:37] speaks uh spoke of death and sorrow in
[26:40] the new testament it speaks of
[26:41] resurrection and life it speaks of
[26:43] healing it speaks of joy it speaks of
[26:46] power it speaks of life it speaks of
[26:48] heaven and that same blood that was shed
[26:51] upon the ground that called out after
[26:53] his dead brother are called out after
[26:55] his brother that had killed him the
[26:56] blood of jesus christ covers all of our
[26:59] sins and speaks peace and resurrection
[27:02] and power and life
[27:05] and healing
[27:07] and all the redemptive blessings that
[27:08] the blood was shed for it speaks for us
[27:12] certainly the blood speaks
[27:15] so i think we believe that the blood
[27:16] speaks
[27:17] but it's not the chemistry of the blood
[27:19] it's the life of the blood the life that
[27:21] was in the blood is what's speaking and
[27:23] what is that voice what is the voice of
[27:25] the uh what is the voice of the blood
[27:28] voice of the life it is the word and it
[27:30] is the holy ghost and the holy ghost
[27:32] brings life to the word
[27:35] again in the token he says we find out
[27:38] the blood does speak
[27:40] it speaks in your behalf
[27:42] the the life that's in you speaks from
[27:45] the shed blood
[27:46] so now the life the the voice of the
[27:49] blood the life of the blood is speaking
[27:51] from in you
[27:53] the life that's in you
[27:56] speaks from the shed blood amen oh
[27:58] brother i wish everybody could see that
[28:01] if you can see what it is it's the life
[28:03] that's in you see that blood is
[28:05] identifying you with it it's the token
[28:09] what is it the blood was shed for you
[28:11] you've accepted and the life has come
[28:14] into you you have the token that's the
[28:17] holy spirit
[28:18] so now you have the token which is the
[28:21] same life that was in the blood amen
[28:24] that day when the blood was being
[28:25] spilled upon the ground that life amen
[28:28] is released amen and that life now has
[28:31] come back into us and that life is
[28:33] speaking it's speaking now it's speaking
[28:36] today and it's speaking on our behalf
[28:41] this is why brother branham says all the
[28:43] time when you begin to pray he said
[28:45] present the token with your prayer
[28:47] i mean when you pray you have to pray in
[28:50] faith amen we don't pray just hoping
[28:52] something would work out amen but we
[28:54] must pray the prayers that god answers
[28:56] for us are the prayers that we pray in
[28:57] faith and how can i have faith when i
[28:59] can apply the token
[29:02] which is the evidence that the fair has
[29:03] been paid for me that i've been redeemed
[29:06] and in this token is the voice that's
[29:08] speaking on my behalf
[29:10] and when i present the token my new
[29:12] birth the baptism of the holy ghost the
[29:14] life of christ in me amen when i can
[29:16] present that with my prayer then i have
[29:19] faith that will answer the prayer
[29:21] because the blood met all the
[29:22] requirements for me and there's nothing
[29:24] to keep the promise from me
[29:26] that's what my brother grahams are
[29:28] saying present the token with your
[29:29] prayer because it's the voice that's
[29:31] speaking for you it's speaking on your
[29:33] behalf you can't say god because i was a
[29:37] good boy will you do this for me god
[29:38] because i went to church every sunday no
[29:41] we couldn't have done anything but the
[29:42] blood did it for us and now the voice of
[29:45] the blood is in us amen which is the
[29:47] holy ghost and we're speaking on our
[29:49] behalf because we have nothing else to
[29:51] present
[29:53] we have nothing else to offer we have
[29:54] nothing else to present there's no other
[29:56] merit that we can give amen to get an
[29:59] answer to prayer or to build faith amen
[30:02] all of our righteousness is as filthy
[30:04] rags so it takes the voice of the blood
[30:06] that's speaking back out of us and say
[30:08] lord that life you gave me is your life
[30:11] and i present that with this request
[30:13] it's the only merit that i have
[30:15] it's the only thing that i have that i
[30:17] can present to you
[30:21] the life has come into you
[30:24] he says again in the token full
[30:25] obedience to the word brings god
[30:28] the word eternal in you
[30:32] i love the way brother brahm does this
[30:35] he doesn't
[30:37] he he mixes terms and interchanges terms
[30:42] so that we will never compartmentalize
[30:45] god
[30:46] that we won't make the word something
[30:48] different than god and we won't make
[30:49] christ something different to god we
[30:51] will make christ something different
[30:52] than the word and we won't make the seed
[30:54] gene something different than god
[30:56] and we won't make the holy ghost
[30:57] something different than jesus christ
[31:00] so he'll mix these terms sometimes in
[31:02] the same sentence so that we don't
[31:04] compartmentalize and say now this is the
[31:06] holy ghost over here and over here's the
[31:08] word
[31:11] and this is god and now this is the holy
[31:13] ghost and now this is jesus christ he'll
[31:15] interchange those terms
[31:18] he says full obedience to the to the
[31:20] word brings god
[31:23] the word eternal
[31:24] in you
[31:26] so does it bring god or the word eternal
[31:28] which one does it bring into me
[31:32] amen
[31:34] full of beings to the word brings god
[31:36] the word eternal in you and that is the
[31:38] token
[31:40] so what is the token the token is the
[31:41] holy ghost but here he says it's god
[31:45] the word eternal the token the holy
[31:48] ghost god word eternal
[31:54] when the word is in you
[31:56] it's christ in you
[32:00] so what's in you
[32:01] god the word eternal the token christ
[32:09] is the room for all of them
[32:13] praise god
[32:14] you know what it's taken decades to wash
[32:17] away denominational thinking
[32:21] let's turn to colossians
[32:24] you know this but i'm going to read this
[32:26] scripture i go back to very familiar
[32:28] scriptures but i do it in the context
[32:31] of what we're studying
[32:34] so not just to rehearse the same thing
[32:35] over and over again but it's always
[32:37] unfolding with greater light
[32:40] colossians chapter 1 verse 25
[32:45] whereof i am made a minister according
[32:47] to the dispensation
[32:49] of god which is given to me for you to
[32:52] fulfill the word of god
[32:55] even the mystery which has been hid from
[32:57] ages and from generations but now is
[32:59] made manifest to a saints to whom god
[33:01] would make known what is the riches of
[33:03] the glory of the mystery among the
[33:05] gentiles which is christ in you the hope
[33:08] of glory
[33:09] so what is this that's coming to you
[33:10] it's god it's the eternal word it's the
[33:12] token it's the holy ghost and it's
[33:14] christ
[33:16] but that is the hope of glory
[33:19] and he says in christ
[33:20] is the mystery of god revealed listen he
[33:22] said he said listen close now i want you
[33:26] not to fail to get this no other church
[33:28] no other sign no other fellowship no
[33:30] other government no other testimony no
[33:32] other creed no denomination is accepted
[33:35] outside of this god accepts nothing else
[33:38] but that christ in you the hope of glory
[33:42] what is it we're talking about the blood
[33:44] speaking on your behalf it's the only
[33:45] thing that's accepted
[33:48] nothing else is accepted but christ in
[33:50] you the hope of glory the only thing
[33:52] that god recognizes no fellowship no
[33:54] church no creed no denomination no
[33:57] nothing everything else is dead
[34:03] now remember last sunday we were talking
[34:05] about the blood uh and the blood life we
[34:08] i i stated what we're really talking
[34:10] about is life
[34:12] so if we talk about the word we're
[34:14] talking about life we're talking about
[34:16] the holy ghost we're talking about life
[34:17] we're talking about god god is life
[34:20] when we talk about christ that's life
[34:23] amen we're talking about life there's
[34:26] only one source of life there really is
[34:28] only one life everything else is dead
[34:32] even this life we're living is a
[34:34] reflection of life it's not life
[34:36] this mortal life is not life it's a
[34:39] reflection of life
[34:42] but life is zoe life that's life
[34:45] everything else is dead in comparison to
[34:48] that life
[34:49] that's why we were dead in trespasses
[34:51] and sin we were breathing in and out
[34:53] amen but we were dead
[34:55] that's why we've come to life
[34:57] because we were dead although we were
[34:59] alive this life is only a reflection of
[35:02] life that is life so when we talk about
[35:04] life that's life
[35:06] that's why when lazarus died jesus said
[35:09] he sleepeth
[35:11] because saints can't die
[35:14] and they misunderstood what he was
[35:15] saying because they're used to the
[35:17] carnal world the the mortal world that
[35:19] we live in and they say well if he's
[35:20] sleeping they'd do as well and brother
[35:21] baby said he had to speak their language
[35:25] so he had to say
[35:27] lazarus is dead and he knew full well
[35:30] lazarus is not dead but in their
[35:32] understanding of life and death lazarus
[35:34] was dead but in his understanding of
[35:35] life and death lazarus can never die
[35:39] because azeroth was a part of life in
[35:41] the beginning and that can never die
[35:44] lazarus was there in the eternal realms
[35:46] before anything was made before anything
[35:48] was spoke he was there so lazarus can
[35:50] never die
[35:52] there's no such thing as death amen to a
[35:56] part of god
[35:59] so really what we're talking about is
[36:01] life
[36:04] in the token he says but the true token
[36:08] of the blood
[36:09] speaking out speaks of a living
[36:11] resurrected presence jesus christ the
[36:15] same yesterday today and forever right
[36:18] living right now among us amen it speaks
[36:21] better from not dead forms and creeds
[36:24] but a living token of a living
[36:26] resurrected christ that lives in us
[36:30] so where does that blood speak for me
[36:33] from
[36:35] it speaks from within
[36:39] because it's the life that's on the
[36:40] inside
[36:43] let's look at galatians chapter 2.
[36:49] galatians chapter 2
[36:51] we'll read verse 20.
[36:58] i am crucified with christ nevertheless
[37:00] i live yet not i but christ liveth in me
[37:04] and the life which i now live in the
[37:06] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[37:08] god who loved me and gave himself for me
[37:13] now paul's saying it's no longer my life
[37:15] but this life that i live in the flesh
[37:17] is the faith of the son of god
[37:19] that's not faith
[37:21] in the son of god
[37:23] that's the faith of the son of god
[37:26] which is god's own faith
[37:29] which is
[37:30] part of the seed gene of god
[37:32] which was in you laying dormant waiting
[37:34] to be quickened
[37:37] now
[37:39] let's turn here to ii corinthians
[37:47] 2 corinthians chapter 4
[37:55] verse 3
[37:59] but if our gospel be hid it is hid to
[38:01] them that are lost
[38:03] in whom the god of this world hath
[38:04] blinded the minds of them which believe
[38:06] not lest the light of the glorious
[38:09] gospel of christ who is the image of god
[38:11] should shine unto them
[38:13] for we preach not ourselves but christ
[38:15] jesus the lord and ourselves your
[38:17] servants for jesus sake
[38:19] for god who commanded the light to shine
[38:21] out of darkness has shined in our hearts
[38:24] to give the light of the knowledge of
[38:26] the glory of god
[38:28] in the face of jesus christ
[38:30] verse 7 but we have this treasure in
[38:33] earthen vessels
[38:34] that the excellency of the power may be
[38:36] of god and not of us
[38:39] this treasure is in earthen vessels
[38:42] and so the treasure is inside
[38:45] but god who commanded the light to shine
[38:47] out of darkness has shined in our hearts
[38:50] when he goes and begins to speak on the
[38:52] light shining of darkness it takes you
[38:53] all way back to the beginning in genesis
[38:56] when darkness covered the face of the
[38:58] deep and god said let there be light and
[39:00] so when god said let there be light the
[39:02] spoken word is what produced the light
[39:05] and now he says here for for god who
[39:08] commanded the light to shine out of
[39:09] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[39:12] give the light of the knowledge of the
[39:14] glory of god in the face of jesus christ
[39:17] but we have this treasure in earthen
[39:19] vessels
[39:21] i want to talk about light in connection
[39:23] with life here for uh just a few minutes
[39:26] and if you just wait with me patiently
[39:28] as this unfolds you'll see
[39:30] let's go back to john 1 the gospel of
[39:32] john
[39:34] chapter 1
[39:38] and verse 1.
[39:40] very familiar but we will read this
[39:43] again
[39:45] in the beginning was the word and the
[39:46] word was with god and the word was god
[39:49] the same was in the beginning with god
[39:51] all things were made by him and without
[39:54] him was not anything made that was made
[39:56] in him was life and the life was the
[39:59] light of men now this is the life that
[40:01] we're talking about
[40:03] in him was life and the life was the
[40:06] light
[40:07] of men
[40:08] and the light shineth in darkness and
[40:10] the darkness comprehended it not
[40:14] amen so the light shined in darkness and
[40:16] the darkness when jesus was the life and
[40:19] the life was the light of men and when
[40:21] he was the word was made flesh and one
[40:23] among us he was the light of life and
[40:26] they stayed in many state in darkness
[40:28] but when we were in darkness god called
[40:31] for the light to shine out of darkness
[40:33] and shined into our hearts
[40:35] and gave us the knowledge of god in the
[40:37] face of jesus christ and now we have
[40:39] this treasure in earth and vessels so
[40:41] now we've come to life by light
[40:45] and so this is the theme that i want to
[40:47] speak on for a few minutes
[40:50] let's look at john chapter 8. scoot over
[40:53] here to john chapter 8 and we'll pick
[40:55] this other verse up
[40:59] john chapter 8
[41:02] verse 12.
[41:06] then speak jesus again unto them saying
[41:08] i am the light of the world he that
[41:11] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[41:13] but shall have the light of life
[41:17] so he said i'm the light of the world
[41:20] now jesus was not talking about the
[41:23] physical light he was talking about life
[41:26] and that life is the light of men he
[41:29] said i am the light of the world he that
[41:31] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[41:34] but shall have the light of life so this
[41:37] is the light of life
[41:39] john 1 says he was the life and the life
[41:41] was the light and now he's saying if i'm
[41:43] the light you won't walk in darkness you
[41:45] will have the light of life so light and
[41:48] life go together
[41:50] and that's what we want to look at for a
[41:52] minute
[41:53] he says now
[41:54] in the message it is the rising of the
[41:56] sun and the first light was ever given
[41:58] on earth was god's spoken word
[42:00] the first light that ever struck the
[42:02] earth was god's spoken word he said let
[42:04] there be light and there was light that
[42:06] turned darkness and light and into light
[42:09] in order to bring forth a creation of
[42:11] joy and life upon the earth
[42:14] and the message there is a man here that
[42:16] can turn on the light
[42:18] by the way
[42:20] referring to this message there is a man
[42:22] here that can turn on the light
[42:24] my whole perspective of this message has
[42:26] changed over the last couple weeks
[42:29] amen there's a man here that can turn on
[42:31] the light
[42:32] he says now what god separates darkness
[42:35] from light
[42:37] or light from darkness and you look at
[42:39] the gospel there's themes that run
[42:40] through the entire gospel into the
[42:42] entire scripture amen life and death
[42:45] runs through the entire scripture
[42:48] light and darkness
[42:49] good and evil
[42:51] there's two vines there's a contrast
[42:54] there's there's opposites amen there
[42:56] there is there's uh
[42:59] there's humility and there's arrogance
[43:00] there's all these things are painting
[43:02] pictures for us but the main theme
[43:04] through the scripture is life and death
[43:07] the main thing through the scripture is
[43:08] life and death this whole book is about
[43:11] life and death
[43:13] it's about light and darkness the whole
[43:14] book is about light and darkness the
[43:16] whole book is about life and death
[43:18] so everything we talk about everything
[43:21] we preach everything we do is about
[43:23] light and darkness it's about life and
[43:25] death
[43:27] and this
[43:28] again in this quote he says he separates
[43:30] death from life and he does it by his
[43:33] word
[43:35] so god wants to separate death and life
[43:38] amen because it got entangled in the
[43:41] garden
[43:43] the seed of life and the hybridization
[43:45] bringing death it got entangled and he
[43:48] wants to separate life and death and he
[43:50] does it by his word
[43:52] his word is what always brings this
[43:55] forth now light well now the seed was
[43:57] already upon the earth i believe god had
[44:00] planted the seed and just as long as the
[44:02] sun could get to that seed it began to
[44:04] grow
[44:05] and that's the reason it only taken days
[44:07] to bring forth these things because the
[44:09] seed was already in the earth and it
[44:12] needed all all it needed was light
[44:15] and that's the way god has today his
[44:18] seed is already here his word the only
[44:21] thing it needs is light on it and he is
[44:23] that light for he is the word
[44:27] and the word and the light is the same
[44:30] thing
[44:33] okay
[44:34] the word and the light is the same thing
[44:37] and the life was the light and it's the
[44:39] light of life and so the word and the
[44:41] light is the same thing and the life in
[44:44] the word is the same thing
[44:47] it all comes from the same source
[44:50] the word and light is the same thing the
[44:52] life in there is the light of the word
[44:55] see is the life the germ of life lays
[44:58] within the grain
[44:59] and in the grain the life is what breaks
[45:01] forth and brings forth the life out of
[45:03] the grain that's the way that christ in
[45:06] the word makes the word do what it's
[45:08] supposed to do just like the life in the
[45:11] grain of wheat or whatever it is it
[45:13] makes the wheat do what it's supposed to
[45:14] do because it's the life that's in it
[45:18] then he comes to the message shalom
[45:21] he said that son is the word of god
[45:24] in the beginning god said let there be
[45:25] light and when the manifested word of
[45:28] god and when the manifested word of god
[45:31] when the word of god was manifested
[45:33] there was light
[45:36] catch that
[45:37] god spoke
[45:39] that there would be light amen
[45:42] and then when the word was manifested
[45:45] then it was light
[45:48] first god spoke it what if he did what
[45:51] if it didn't manifest then it wasn't
[45:53] light yet
[45:55] but when he spoke it and then it was
[45:57] manifested vindicated his word was a
[45:59] vindicated light come into existence
[46:03] and that's the only way it can be done
[46:05] now is when the word is vindicated god's
[46:07] written word vindicated then it shows
[46:10] light it's a portion
[46:12] it's a portion is lit or put out for
[46:15] each age we find it in the church ages
[46:17] we find it in the old testament church
[46:19] age each time that there come a time for
[46:21] a certain manifestation of the journey
[46:23] there was a prophet come to the earth
[46:25] and the word come to the prophet and he
[46:27] made that word live and when the word
[46:30] was identified it reflected god and
[46:33] there was the age there was the light
[46:36] and that's the way the light comes today
[46:39] all right brother frank if you can bring
[46:40] up the whiteboard i want to look at the
[46:42] whiteboard
[46:44] for just a minute
[46:45] but i want to read this quote while
[46:47] that's coming up it says
[46:49] in the message turn on the light from
[46:51] 1964 he says no life can come outside of
[46:54] light
[46:57] now the word is light
[47:02] no life can come outside of light
[47:06] light produces light produces life
[47:10] there can be no life outside of light
[47:12] natural or spiritual
[47:15] there must be the only light can come by
[47:18] the word of god
[47:19] god's word is the light when it's
[47:22] manifested
[47:24] so no life can come outside of light and
[47:28] the light is the word of god manifested
[47:32] without the word of god being manifested
[47:35] there can be no light if there's no
[47:37] light there can be no life
[47:41] these are such basic principles but they
[47:43] lay all the way back in genesis at the
[47:46] beginning in creation because when god
[47:48] was going to bring life the first thing
[47:49] he had to bring was light
[47:51] the very first thing he did when he
[47:53] spoke was spoke light amen because
[47:55] nothing was going to come forth upon
[47:57] this earth until first he got light
[48:00] then he had to change the conditions of
[48:02] the earth so that the light could get to
[48:03] the seed amen so first he has to have
[48:06] light then he has to move things in a
[48:08] certain order to get the light to the
[48:10] seed when he gets the light to the seed
[48:12] then the seed springs to life
[48:16] so let's look at it this way
[48:20] in
[48:21] john 1 1
[48:23] it says in the beginning was the word
[48:26] right
[48:27] so in the beginning was the word
[48:30] in him was life
[48:33] so where is life
[48:36] life
[48:37] is in the word
[48:41] is that right
[48:43] life is in the word
[48:47] over here
[48:49] let's say we have other word
[48:53] and we'll call these
[48:55] seeds
[48:58] all right
[48:59] now brother branham said every seed
[49:02] be before it come into
[49:04] existence was spoken word god spoke
[49:07] every seed into existence so in the
[49:10] original creation he says there were
[49:11] seeds under there and the fourth seal i
[49:13] believe it is he said from a previous
[49:15] civilization or something like that and
[49:17] he said there was those seeds were there
[49:18] but those seeds originated as the word
[49:22] and the word created the seed and as the
[49:24] seeds repopulated it was a continuation
[49:27] of the word of god
[49:29] so the word
[49:30] amen the seed was originally word god
[49:34] spoken word created the seed so if we
[49:36] talk a palm seed amen first god had to
[49:39] speak a palm seed and that spoken word
[49:41] would go into a manifestation and create
[49:43] the seed seed go into the ground it
[49:45] would create the tree amen there was
[49:46] life in the word so this word over here
[49:53] has life in it
[49:55] is that right
[49:58] but
[50:00] in the beginning of creation
[50:02] that word that was laying there those
[50:04] seeds were covered over in darkness no
[50:07] light could get to them and they were
[50:08] laying there in a state of
[50:10] death non-manifestation
[50:14] they were laying there under the water
[50:16] from something previous and now they're
[50:18] in a under judgment and they're laying
[50:21] there amen but there's life there's
[50:23] always life in the word
[50:26] so in the beginning was the word and in
[50:29] him was life
[50:32] so in order to get this word over here
[50:36] to manifest
[50:38] he's got to manifest this word
[50:43] which is
[50:46] light
[50:48] when god spoke the word light there was
[50:50] life in that word
[50:53] because then the word is life
[50:55] but when light began to shine
[50:58] it was manifested word
[51:05] all right
[51:07] and when when when the light now when
[51:10] the manifestation of the spoken word the
[51:12] spoken word was let there be light
[51:14] and the scripture says and then there
[51:16] was light
[51:18] so when it goes from spoken word to
[51:20] manifested word the manifested word is
[51:23] now the light and that light will bring
[51:26] the life to the rest of the word
[51:30] so it's manifested word but when the
[51:33] word is manifested
[51:35] i just draw it like this
[51:37] the life
[51:38] moves into that
[51:41] understand
[51:42] so the the word the life is in the word
[51:45] now when the word comes into
[51:46] manifestation the life of that word
[51:49] comes into the manifestation and the
[51:51] manifestation has life also
[51:55] and so when the manifestation of light
[51:58] comes all the way over here and strikes
[52:01] this word when it gets through the
[52:02] darkness and gets to the word it
[52:04] quickens this life that's on the inside
[52:07] and up comes the tree
[52:11] up comes the life what did it it was it
[52:14] was life all along this is why brother
[52:17] brennan said word comes to word
[52:20] life comes to life
[52:23] is that right
[52:25] and so he said word comes the word eagle
[52:27] the eagle life comes to life word comes
[52:30] to word amen and brother ben takes this
[52:32] uh this story of
[52:34] of the recreation of the earth back in
[52:36] genesis and he says that's our lives
[52:39] amen we come into this life under a
[52:41] state of judgment our earth is shrouded
[52:44] in darkness darkness of what we have
[52:46] eyes we can see light we can say it's a
[52:48] bright sunny day but we're under the
[52:50] darkness of the understanding of the
[52:52] word of god which has us shrouded in
[52:54] complete darkness
[52:57] but god knows how to bring that seed to
[52:59] life and he's got a word that has life
[53:02] in it and when that word comes in the
[53:04] manifestation the life comes with it
[53:07] into the manifestation and when that
[53:09] light strikes the seed that's on the
[53:11] inside of us life comes to life to
[53:14] quicken life
[53:16] [Music]
[53:16] [Applause]
[53:18] and so
[53:20] it's all about life
[53:23] now what life comes to what life it's
[53:27] the life of god that comes to the life
[53:28] of god
[53:30] word to word
[53:32] life to life
[53:33] is that right
[53:36] so when this manifested word
[53:39] comes in
[53:41] it quickens the life that's laying in
[53:43] the word
[53:44] seed
[53:46] because you're part of the word
[53:49] if you were if you're one of god's
[53:50] attributes his attributes are words
[53:53] they were thoughts
[53:54] words
[53:55] manifested word it's all the attribute
[53:57] of god which is word
[54:00] so now we can see
[54:03] this this progression of the word coming
[54:06] into manifestation
[54:09] and the word coming into manifestation
[54:11] as light
[54:13] now
[54:14] strikes a seed that's in darkness
[54:18] and brings that seed to light
[54:23] but praise god
[54:25] that's not the end of the journey
[54:27] now the life that was laying dormant
[54:30] under this word this seed this let's say
[54:33] the palm tree amen god had originally
[54:35] spoke palm tree under judgment now
[54:37] there's a palm seed laying under there
[54:39] but because it's a spoken word it has
[54:41] life inside of it amen but it's shrouded
[54:43] in darkness so god says let there be
[54:45] light amen that's the word then there
[54:48] was light that's the manifested word and
[54:50] it brings the life with it
[54:52] now when the darkness moves and the
[54:55] light hits this palm seed it springs the
[54:57] life on the inside to life and now that
[55:00] seed that germ that word springs to life
[55:05] and as it springs to life it becomes the
[55:08] manifestation of the word and now it is
[55:11] light and with its light comes life
[55:14] [Music]
[55:17] praise god the natural types the
[55:19] spiritual
[55:21] let's keep going
[55:23] here
[55:24] back to the message there is a man here
[55:26] that can turn on the light
[55:29] so life is only by the word of god made
[55:32] manifest
[55:34] life comes only by the word of god made
[55:36] manifest so how does life come by the
[55:40] word of god made manifest
[55:43] as long as it is just in the book like
[55:46] this it still can be questioned but when
[55:48] it's made manifest then you see the
[55:49] product of what it spoke of being
[55:51] manifested then that is light on the
[55:54] word see that brings the word said so
[55:56] and then when it comes to past that is
[55:59] life in light
[56:02] amen the manifested word is life in
[56:04] light because light is the word made
[56:06] manifest
[56:08] light brings life
[56:10] light brings life
[56:13] you've got it that's why
[56:15] if we go back amen we go backwards and
[56:18] we don't have the word for our day being
[56:22] made manifest then it's not the light to
[56:24] quicken the seed for this day amen that
[56:27] way there's nothing coming to life until
[56:29] the word that is ordained for this
[56:31] season in time comes into manifestation
[56:34] and when that light when that word comes
[56:35] into manifestation it has the light of
[56:38] life
[56:39] and it can bring life to the seed that
[56:42] is supposed to come into manifestation
[56:44] in this day and there's no manifesting
[56:46] that seed without the light of life and
[56:48] the light of life is the word that was
[56:50] previously spoken coming into
[56:51] manifestation then it comes to this seed
[56:54] amen comes into manifestation and now
[56:56] that becomes the manifestation and
[56:59] becomes the light
[57:03] that's why jesus said back in john 8 i
[57:05] am the light of the world
[57:08] if you come to me ye shall have the
[57:10] light of life
[57:12] let's go to matthew 5.
[57:22] matthew chapter 5.
[57:33] matthew 5 and verse 13.
[57:36] now jesus is speaking to his disciples
[57:39] he says you are the salt of the earth
[57:41] but if the salt have lost its savior
[57:43] wherewith shall it be salted is
[57:44] henceforth good for nothing but to be
[57:46] cast out and to be trodden under foot of
[57:48] men ye are the light of the world a city
[57:50] that is set on the hill cannot be hid
[57:52] neither do men light a candle and put it
[57:54] under a bushel
[57:56] but on a candlestick and it giveth light
[57:58] unto all that are in the house
[58:01] let your light so shine before men that
[58:03] they may see your good works and glorify
[58:05] your father which is in heaven we'll
[58:08] come back to this verse in a little bit
[58:09] but
[58:10] he says
[58:11] jesus says ye are the light of the world
[58:15] but he briefly said he was the light of
[58:17] the world
[58:20] but he was the manifested word in his
[58:22] day
[58:23] they were the seed that was ordained to
[58:26] spring to life in that day
[58:28] and when the manifested word became
[58:30] light on the day of pentecost that light
[58:33] come into them and sprung them to life
[58:36] and when they come to life when when the
[58:39] new testament church was born when the
[58:41] prophecy of joel was fulfilled when the
[58:43] things that jesus had prophesied when
[58:45] all of a sudden it came to life that
[58:47] life became the manifestation and became
[58:50] the light and jesus says now you're the
[58:52] light
[58:54] because you're the word for this day
[58:56] made manifest now you become the light
[59:04] let's go to galatians chapter 1.
[59:10] i want to look at the life of paul just
[59:11] real quick here in a couple of
[59:12] scriptures
[59:14] and take it as an example
[59:17] galatians chapter 1.
[59:25] and verse 13 galatians 1 and 13.
[59:32] for you have heard of my conversion in
[59:33] time past in the jews religion how that
[59:36] beyond measure i persecuted the church
[59:38] of god and wasted it
[59:40] and profited in the jews religion above
[59:42] mine equals in my own nation being more
[59:45] exceedingly zealous of the traditions of
[59:47] my fathers but when it pleased god who
[59:50] separated me from my mother's womb and
[59:52] called me by his grace to reveal his son
[59:56] in me
[59:58] not to me
[1:00:03] paul received a revelation of jesus
[1:00:05] christ is that true
[1:00:07] was jesus christ revealed to paul
[1:00:11] yes
[1:00:12] but god's plan was not just to stop with
[1:00:16] the revelation of the son to paul
[1:00:18] but now when the revelation of the son
[1:00:21] came to paul
[1:00:23] paul would spring to life
[1:00:25] and he was a certain seed for that day
[1:00:27] and when he met the pillar of fire on
[1:00:28] the road to damascus amen amen he saw
[1:00:31] the manifested word as light and the
[1:00:34] light come to the seed quickened the
[1:00:36] seed and now when the seed is quickened
[1:00:38] it's not now going to be the sun
[1:00:42] revealed to paul now it's going to be
[1:00:44] the sun revealed in paul
[1:00:48] now paul is going to be manifesting the
[1:00:51] sun the life of the sun
[1:00:54] amen let me read that again
[1:00:56] but when it please god who separated me
[1:00:58] from my mother's womb and call me by his
[1:01:00] grace to reveal his son in me that i
[1:01:03] might preach him among the heathen
[1:01:05] immediately i confer not with flesh and
[1:01:07] blood
[1:01:08] so though it's amazing
[1:01:11] that
[1:01:13] paul now
[1:01:14] realized he did receive a revelation of
[1:01:17] jesus christ jesus christ the son was
[1:01:19] revealed to him
[1:01:22] but the purpose of the sun being
[1:01:23] revealed to him is so that the sun could
[1:01:26] be revealed in him
[1:01:28] so that from then on if you wanted to
[1:01:30] see the sun you needed to see the sun as
[1:01:33] it was shining and it was shining in the
[1:01:35] manifested word for that day which was
[1:01:37] the apostle paul
[1:01:40] let's go to acts 13.
[1:01:43] now we're not going to leave this with
[1:01:44] paul right
[1:01:46] we're not going to say oh that was
[1:01:47] amazing paul praise the lord the son was
[1:01:50] revealed in paul it wasn't going to stop
[1:01:53] there
[1:01:54] because the sun was then revealed in
[1:01:56] paul and when the sun was revealed in
[1:01:58] paul amen it was a light that was
[1:02:00] supposed to light and that light was to
[1:02:02] shine the gentiles because there was
[1:02:03] seed laying in gentile form and when
[1:02:06] that light shined on gentile form then
[1:02:08] there was life inside of that seed and
[1:02:11] that sprung to life and now the gentile
[1:02:13] church was born amen the beginning of
[1:02:15] the bride and now that began to shine
[1:02:18] the light and now the sun was revealed
[1:02:20] in them amen
[1:02:23] amen let's look at this in acts 13
[1:02:27] verse 46.
[1:02:30] then paul and barnabas wax bold and said
[1:02:32] it was necessary that the word of god
[1:02:34] should first have been spoken to you
[1:02:36] but seeing you put it from you and judge
[1:02:38] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[1:02:40] lo
[1:02:41] we turn to the gentiles
[1:02:44] for so hat the lord commanded us saying
[1:02:46] i have set thee to be a light of the
[1:02:49] gentiles
[1:02:50] that thou should be for salvation to the
[1:02:53] ends of the earth
[1:02:56] boy isn't it such a shame that when paul
[1:02:58] died the light went out
[1:03:02] no because the light is manifested word
[1:03:06] and when
[1:03:07] paul was a light paul was manifested
[1:03:10] word
[1:03:11] he was fulfilling the prophecy of a
[1:03:13] light to the gentiles that word was
[1:03:14] spoken now was alive in him and that
[1:03:17] light is the life that light brings the
[1:03:20] life and now when that light would come
[1:03:21] in contact with seeds that had life on
[1:03:24] the inside they would spring to life and
[1:03:26] now when they sprung to life now the
[1:03:28] light was shining from them because they
[1:03:30] were manifest manifesting the word for
[1:03:32] their day
[1:03:41] let's go
[1:03:42] to revelations chapter one
[1:03:47] i'm going to skip just a little bit here
[1:03:50] keep moving revelation chapter one
[1:03:53] i'm doing really good we're getting
[1:03:54] through stuff
[1:03:55] really well
[1:03:57] but i just want to hit to this
[1:03:59] point here
[1:04:02] now i want to go back to our
[1:04:04] our little drawing here
[1:04:08] i could just draw maybe the same thing
[1:04:11] in a different way
[1:04:13] now we have the word
[1:04:19] all right and over here
[1:04:22] we have a man
[1:04:25] and that's the best i can do
[1:04:27] i'll make him smile
[1:04:30] but in the man
[1:04:32] is a seed
[1:04:34] and in that seed is life
[1:04:38] is that right
[1:04:42] and that life will only spring to life
[1:04:46] when the conditions are right for life
[1:04:51] brother brahman begins to teach us this
[1:04:53] he says now
[1:04:54] there are certain seeds that come forth
[1:04:57] in certain times
[1:04:59] and under certain conditions you can
[1:05:00] plant the seed and shine the light on it
[1:05:02] but there's certain you know wheat grows
[1:05:04] at a different time than corn grows we
[1:05:06] know that around here amen so there's
[1:05:08] certain conditions that the seed needs
[1:05:10] and the seed will never come to life
[1:05:12] till it gets to the right conditions
[1:05:14] amen and so this
[1:05:15] but what springs the seed to life is
[1:05:18] always the light and now it's the light
[1:05:20] for your day when the conditions are
[1:05:22] right in your day and the light for your
[1:05:24] day comes to you it brings life to the
[1:05:26] scene
[1:05:28] so now
[1:05:30] i want to go back through this
[1:05:32] in the beginning was the word
[1:05:34] and the word was with god and the word
[1:05:35] was god
[1:05:37] and in him was life
[1:05:39] all right
[1:05:41] so the the life is in the word
[1:05:45] but then when when it comes time the
[1:05:47] conditions god knows the conditions he
[1:05:49] knows the seasons he knows when to plant
[1:05:51] his seeds
[1:05:53] god is a perfect husbandman a perfect
[1:05:56] farmer he knows when to plant his seeds
[1:05:58] he never has his seed here in the wrong
[1:06:00] season
[1:06:01] that's why he didn't plant you in
[1:06:02] luther's day amen the conditions would
[1:06:05] not have been right for your birth and
[1:06:06] luther's day amen that's why luther
[1:06:08] couldn't come in our day amen god knew
[1:06:11] when to plant the seeds he knew how to
[1:06:13] get the full harvest he knew how to get
[1:06:15] all the production he knew how to do it
[1:06:17] right he's the perfect farmer amen so he
[1:06:20] brought you at a certain time so make
[1:06:23] yourself this little ugly figure that i
[1:06:24] made
[1:06:26] and that's you amen but in you amen is
[1:06:29] the seed of life but only the manifested
[1:06:32] light for your day will bring the seed
[1:06:34] inside of you to life
[1:06:37] so in our day amen god sent his word and
[1:06:40] the word became manifested
[1:06:46] manifested word
[1:06:48] and that was light
[1:06:51] and that light come down and hit this
[1:06:54] seed inside each one of us and when it
[1:06:56] died and when it did it brought us to
[1:06:59] life we died to the old man but newness
[1:07:02] of life now christ was birthed in us
[1:07:05] because life came to life amen what life
[1:07:08] the life of light came to us manifested
[1:07:11] word come to us and when we received the
[1:07:13] manifested word it brought the life that
[1:07:16] was in us waiting for that light and
[1:07:19] then it connected it brought life and
[1:07:21] now we come to life
[1:07:25] but now let's draw our
[1:07:27] little guy down here
[1:07:31] i'm sorry
[1:07:34] if you guys want to take up collection
[1:07:35] and send me to art class
[1:07:37] i might be able to do better in the
[1:07:38] future
[1:07:41] now when this
[1:07:43] when this word
[1:07:45] that was laying in here
[1:07:50] the light hits it
[1:07:51] it comes to life
[1:07:54] and it begins to manifest
[1:08:00] and what's the manifestation
[1:08:04] it is light
[1:08:08] and that light it becomes whatever god
[1:08:11] intended for you to be amen when that
[1:08:14] seed comes to life you begin to manifest
[1:08:17] the word for your day and as our life
[1:08:20] begins to line up to the word amen not
[1:08:22] we manifest whatever we want our own
[1:08:24] desires our own thoughts that's the
[1:08:26] wrong manifestation but when we come
[1:08:28] under the headship of the word the word
[1:08:31] for our day we come to life under that
[1:08:33] word and the life that's in us will only
[1:08:36] match the life of the light that came to
[1:08:38] us
[1:08:39] that's why the scripture says
[1:08:41] uh the eye is the the light of the soul
[1:08:43] if the eye be single and then the the
[1:08:46] eye be full of light but if the eye be
[1:08:47] darkness how great is that darkness
[1:08:50] and if our light be turned to darkness
[1:08:52] how great is that darkness amen because
[1:08:54] we have to be single which means focused
[1:08:56] we have to be singularly focused on the
[1:08:59] light and when we're singly focused on
[1:09:00] the light then we're full of that light
[1:09:04] but if our eye become dim because we're
[1:09:06] not focused on that light but we have
[1:09:09] other focuses as well then if our light
[1:09:11] becomes darkness amen
[1:09:14] now you say what's the big deal the big
[1:09:16] deal is you're the manifested light in
[1:09:19] this day and where does life come from
[1:09:22] it comes through light amen light of
[1:09:25] life light brings life you have to have
[1:09:28] the light of the manifested world to
[1:09:30] bring life
[1:09:32] so that's why we're implored we're
[1:09:35] encouraged amen we're admonished to stay
[1:09:37] focused on this word that god gave us
[1:09:40] focused in such a way not that i just
[1:09:42] read it amen but i read it and i say
[1:09:44] lord i want to be whatever this is that
[1:09:46] i'm reading i want to reflect nothing
[1:09:49] else but jesus christ and jesus christ
[1:09:51] has been made on a full display in our
[1:09:54] day so that there's no more mystery
[1:09:55] about who he is no more mystery about
[1:09:58] the word the full word has been given
[1:10:00] that's the light of the age that brought
[1:10:02] us to life and it's also the same light
[1:10:04] word to reflect
[1:10:07] so now the light that brought the seed
[1:10:10] to life this seed that came to life is a
[1:10:12] seed that is
[1:10:14] predestinated to live in this age
[1:10:18] and that predestinated seed that lives
[1:10:20] in this age was ordained to have a
[1:10:23] certain expression
[1:10:26] and that expression
[1:10:28] when it's manifested will be light
[1:10:34] that light
[1:10:35] is the manifested word
[1:10:39] that's why it's so critical that there's
[1:10:41] a continuity of life
[1:10:45] this word that we received
[1:10:50] let's put manifested word
[1:10:54] this manifested word that we received
[1:10:57] was light
[1:10:59] and in it was life
[1:11:01] and life came into us
[1:11:03] is that right
[1:11:06] so the life that was in the word
[1:11:08] was in the manifested word
[1:11:11] and that life came into us which was
[1:11:13] dormant word
[1:11:15] i'm just using terms that i understand
[1:11:18] dormant word
[1:11:19] to bring us out of dormancy
[1:11:22] out of sleep
[1:11:23] out of deadness into life and quickened
[1:11:26] us to life
[1:11:28] so when it quickened us alive it didn't
[1:11:30] quicken us to any life
[1:11:33] it didn't quick us to lay out the sea in
[1:11:35] life
[1:11:36] it didn't quicken us to american life
[1:11:39] it didn't quicken us to whatever your
[1:11:41] family name is i mean smith or miller it
[1:11:44] didn't quicken you to that life that's
[1:11:45] the life you lived before but it
[1:11:47] quickened you to the life of jesus
[1:11:49] christ
[1:11:51] and jesus christ is the word so the life
[1:11:54] we're supposed to live is the word life
[1:11:56] amen and when the word lives it's
[1:11:58] manifested word and manifested word is
[1:12:01] light and light is the only thing that
[1:12:03] brings life
[1:12:06] that's why when the when when the
[1:12:09] prophet of god takes the scriptures and
[1:12:11] begins to teach us how a man conducts
[1:12:13] himself how a woman conducts himself how
[1:12:16] a family is structured how a church is
[1:12:18] structured how i mean when he begins to
[1:12:20] lay all these things out listen friends
[1:12:22] what's he doing he's shining the light
[1:12:25] to bring life to the sea that's the
[1:12:27] light that brought life to the seed but
[1:12:29] there must be a continuity of life all
[1:12:32] the way through every expression
[1:12:35] so if it was life that came to you
[1:12:37] through the manifested word
[1:12:39] and it quickened life within you
[1:12:42] now what needs to come out of you
[1:12:45] is life
[1:12:48] what life light life
[1:12:51] what is light manifested word
[1:12:55] that's why he says if our light becomes
[1:12:58] darkness
[1:13:00] how great is that darkness
[1:13:04] because if our light become darkness
[1:13:09] then where is the light to quicken the
[1:13:11] seeds in this day
[1:13:14] like this is this is no longer a
[1:13:17] legalistic idea to the message
[1:13:20] this is no longer i'm going to line up
[1:13:23] so that i can live
[1:13:25] but now i'm going to line up so that
[1:13:27] somebody else can live
[1:13:32] i'm not just now it's not i got to get
[1:13:35] this all right because i got to make
[1:13:36] sure i'm right amen listen i was right
[1:13:39] before the foundation of the world i was
[1:13:40] always ordained to be right if i've got
[1:13:42] a revelation that i'm part of god i can
[1:13:45] no more be lost and god can be lost
[1:13:46] because god cannot lose a piece of
[1:13:48] himself
[1:13:50] so i am secure under the revelation of
[1:13:53] this hour and that security amen
[1:13:55] abolishes my legalistic tendencies i
[1:13:58] don't need to be legalistic to be right
[1:14:00] amen i just need i'm right
[1:14:04] why are you right he made me right i've
[1:14:06] been under the sprinkling of the blood
[1:14:08] amen the token speaks for me it speaks
[1:14:10] on my behalf i'm right
[1:14:12] because he made me right
[1:14:15] i'm clean because he cleansed me amen
[1:14:17] i'm ordained unto life there's there's
[1:14:20] no other way so the revelation that god
[1:14:22] gave us amen frees us from the
[1:14:24] legalistic tendencies
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:27] and so the now the question of whether
[1:14:29] we're going to make it or not should
[1:14:30] already be answered
[1:14:32] so now the question of whether we're
[1:14:34] going to make it or not is not based on
[1:14:36] conduct
[1:14:40] oh if we could just make ourselves plug
[1:14:42] into that truth and force our flesh and
[1:14:45] our own mind to receive that in its
[1:14:47] fullness
[1:14:50] now
[1:14:51] my acceptance is not based on my conduct
[1:14:52] my acceptance is based on my faith
[1:14:55] my faith comes from a seed gene that i
[1:14:57] didn't put there he did
[1:14:59] the ability to believe
[1:15:03] so now
[1:15:04] me lining up to the word
[1:15:08] is not
[1:15:09] about finding acceptance with god and
[1:15:11] being saved and making sure i go to the
[1:15:13] rapture
[1:15:15] when i sprung to life that was all
[1:15:17] secure
[1:15:21] but now lining up to the word is an
[1:15:23] expression of love
[1:15:25] first and foremost
[1:15:27] he says if you love me keep my
[1:15:29] commandments
[1:15:33] so how can we do the works
[1:15:35] how can we do the works of the lord he
[1:15:37] said believe on him who got a sense
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:41] and then
[1:15:42] you know
[1:15:43] one of the apostles i don't remember who
[1:15:45] it was it might have been paul or
[1:15:46] whoever said i mean he had a spiritual
[1:15:49] will acknowledge that the things that i
[1:15:50] write unto you they are the commandments
[1:15:51] of the lord
[1:15:54] so now
[1:15:55] he whom he sent you must receive whom he
[1:15:58] sent now gives commandments and those
[1:15:59] commandments are the commandments of the
[1:16:00] lord
[1:16:01] [Music]
[1:16:02] so now it's not paul's opinion
[1:16:04] paul says those are the commandments of
[1:16:06] the lord
[1:16:08] now they received paul because paul was
[1:16:09] whom he sent
[1:16:11] then paul gave commandments and those
[1:16:12] commandments of the lord and jesus says
[1:16:14] if you love me you'll keep my
[1:16:15] commandments
[1:16:17] now it has nothing to do with making it
[1:16:19] i've already made it has everything to
[1:16:22] do with me loving the one who saved me
[1:16:25] me loving the lord
[1:16:27] but now
[1:16:28] if my light
[1:16:30] which is the manifestation of my life
[1:16:33] becomes darkness
[1:16:35] how great is that darkness
[1:16:40] because it's the only light that's left
[1:16:42] shining
[1:16:45] do you realize how few lights there are
[1:16:47] in the world
[1:16:50] do you realize that this is the age of
[1:16:52] darkness
[1:16:53] and gross darkness upon the people
[1:16:56] but that there shall be light in the
[1:16:57] evening time
[1:16:59] where is that light
[1:17:02] where is that light
[1:17:04] what is that light manifested life
[1:17:06] you've been quickened to life to live a
[1:17:09] seed life
[1:17:10] an ordained life a predestinated life a
[1:17:12] faith life amen a word life that's what
[1:17:15] we've been born again to live not our
[1:17:16] own life his life in us now he quickened
[1:17:19] us so that he could reveal the son in us
[1:17:22] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:17:26] so now when that light becomes darkness
[1:17:28] how great is that darkness
[1:17:32] now it's not about
[1:17:35] i have to do this
[1:17:38] it's not about my church teaches
[1:17:41] i said this so many times
[1:17:43] i hope i pray i pray to the lord that
[1:17:47] nobody in this church ever goes to
[1:17:49] anybody and says my church teaches
[1:17:52] because when you start right there
[1:17:54] you're absolutely off from the very
[1:17:56] beginning
[1:17:57] because we're lining up to the word not
[1:17:59] to a church teaching we're lining up to
[1:18:02] our headship which is jesus christ the
[1:18:04] word we're not lining up to any church
[1:18:06] any group of people any system of man if
[1:18:08] we're doing that in our thinking we've
[1:18:10] got to break that from our thinking and
[1:18:12] say it's not what the church teaches it
[1:18:14] may be perfectly absolutely all right
[1:18:16] but it's got to go further than that it
[1:18:18] has to go with what the lord teaches
[1:18:21] what the word says what my headship says
[1:18:24] and i'm referring back to my headship
[1:18:26] not back to my church
[1:18:30] now if we all come into the unity of the
[1:18:32] faith unto the head and we all come to
[1:18:34] the headship amen church order is not a
[1:18:36] problem amen
[1:18:39] conduct order and doctrine is not an
[1:18:40] issue because we're taking it from the
[1:18:42] same head
[1:18:44] so now it's not what the church teaches
[1:18:48] we don't align with what the church
[1:18:50] teaches
[1:18:52] we align with our headship which is the
[1:18:54] word
[1:18:55] now let's look at revelation
[1:18:58] chapter 1
[1:19:01] verse 9.
[1:19:06] revelation chapter 1
[1:19:08] verse 9.
[1:19:12] i john who also am your brother and
[1:19:14] companion
[1:19:15] in tribulation and kingdom and
[1:19:17] impatience of jesus christ was in the
[1:19:19] aisle that is called patmos for the word
[1:19:21] of god
[1:19:22] and for the testimony of jesus christ
[1:19:25] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:19:26] and i heard behind me a great voice as
[1:19:29] of a trumpet
[1:19:31] saying i am alpha and omega the first
[1:19:33] and the last and what thou see is write
[1:19:35] in a book and send it unto the seven
[1:19:37] churches which are in asia unto ephesus
[1:19:40] unto smyrna unto pergamos unto thyatira
[1:19:43] and unto sardis and unto philadelphia
[1:19:46] and ontale to see him
[1:19:47] and i turn to see the voice that spake
[1:19:50] with me
[1:19:51] and being turned i saw seven golden
[1:19:53] candlesticks
[1:19:55] so the voice was coming out of the midst
[1:19:58] of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:20:00] and the seven golden candlesticks
[1:20:02] represent the seven church ages
[1:20:04] the seven church ages is the building of
[1:20:07] the bride
[1:20:09] right
[1:20:10] so he heard a voice
[1:20:13] the voice declared who it was but when
[1:20:14] he turned to see the voice
[1:20:17] what he saw was seven golden
[1:20:18] candlesticks
[1:20:20] showing where christ is
[1:20:24] he is in the midst of the seven
[1:20:26] candlesticks and where he's speaking
[1:20:29] from he's speaking from the midst of the
[1:20:31] seven candlesticks
[1:20:33] right so he's speaking out from his
[1:20:34] church
[1:20:37] he said i turned to see the voices spake
[1:20:38] with me and being turned i saw seven
[1:20:40] golden candle sticks and in the midst of
[1:20:42] the seven candlesticks one like unto the
[1:20:44] son of man
[1:20:45] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[1:20:46] and gird about the paps with a golden
[1:20:48] girdle
[1:20:49] his head and his hairs were white like
[1:20:51] wool as white as snow and his eyes were
[1:20:53] as the flame of fire and his feet like
[1:20:55] undefined brass as if they burned in a
[1:20:57] furnace in his voice as the sound of
[1:21:00] many waters
[1:21:01] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[1:21:04] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[1:21:05] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[1:21:07] as the sun shineth in his strength and
[1:21:09] when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[1:21:11] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:21:14] saying unto me fear not i am the first
[1:21:16] and the last.
[1:21:18] the scripture that i want to focus on is
[1:21:21] the end of
[1:21:22] verse 15 which is his voice as the sound
[1:21:26] of many waters
[1:21:28] brotherhood says in the seal of god from
[1:21:31] 1954 he says now this great subject we
[1:21:33] had last night
[1:21:35] the first night before last was the
[1:21:37] church in the church age how that we
[1:21:39] seen jesus standing in the midst of the
[1:21:40] seven golden candlesticks to look upon
[1:21:42] as jasper and sardis stone
[1:21:44] the beginning in the ending reuben and
[1:21:46] benjamin see the seven candlesticks or
[1:21:48] the seven lampstands standing and a
[1:21:50] rainbow over it is a covenant and how he
[1:21:53] was appeared
[1:21:54] and his voice was the voice of many
[1:21:56] waters both christ and the church
[1:21:58] speaking together
[1:22:00] what is the voice of many waters both
[1:22:02] christ and the church speaking together
[1:22:06] let's look at this in revelation 17.
[1:22:09] the bible gives its definition of many
[1:22:11] waters in revelation 17.
[1:22:14] there's a description of the great
[1:22:16] sitteth upon the beast on seven hills
[1:22:18] and all of this
[1:22:20] and we'll find that
[1:22:21] in
[1:22:22] revelation 17 verse 1
[1:22:26] and there came one of the seven angels
[1:22:28] which had the seven vials and talked
[1:22:30] with me saying unto me come hither i
[1:22:32] will show unto you the judgment of the
[1:22:33] great that sitteth upon many
[1:22:35] waters
[1:22:36] so now we're going to get the definition
[1:22:39] of what many waters mean
[1:22:42] she sitteth upon many waters let's go to
[1:22:44] verse 15.
[1:22:47] he said unto me the waters which thou
[1:22:49] saw us where the horse sitteth are
[1:22:51] peoples and multitudes and nations and
[1:22:55] tongues
[1:22:56] so what are many waters
[1:22:58] people
[1:23:00] many people nations peoples and tongues
[1:23:03] so the voice of jesus was the voice of
[1:23:07] many waters
[1:23:09] water many waters many peoples nations
[1:23:12] voices many tongues
[1:23:14] a multitude and a variety
[1:23:17] of people
[1:23:19] brother ben picks this up in the church
[1:23:20] age book from the patmos vision
[1:23:23] it says his voice was as the sound of
[1:23:25] many waters
[1:23:27] now what do the waters represent
[1:23:29] here in revelation 17 15 the waters
[1:23:32] without sauls are people multitudes of
[1:23:33] nations and tongues his voice was the
[1:23:36] sound of multitude speaking what is it
[1:23:38] it's the judgment for those are the
[1:23:40] voices of the multitudes of witnesses
[1:23:43] who by the holy spirit all through the
[1:23:44] ages have testified to christ and
[1:23:47] preached his gospel it will be the voice
[1:23:50] of every man rising in judgment against
[1:23:51] the sinner who would not take warning
[1:23:53] the voices of the seven messengers will
[1:23:55] be heard loud and clear those faithful
[1:23:57] preachers who preached the saving power
[1:23:59] of jesus who preached water baptism in
[1:24:01] jesus name who preached the infilling
[1:24:04] and power of the holy ghost who stood
[1:24:05] with the word more
[1:24:07] more than they stood with their own
[1:24:08] lives all of them were the voice of
[1:24:10] jesus christ by the holy ghost
[1:24:14] down through the ages
[1:24:16] now what is the voice of the blood
[1:24:18] the word
[1:24:20] what is the voice of the blood the holy
[1:24:22] ghost
[1:24:24] where is that voice coming through it's
[1:24:26] the sound of many waters
[1:24:29] the holy ghost through the church ages
[1:24:32] has been speaking amen the word of god
[1:24:34] as it's been dispensed and as they speak
[1:24:36] it it becomes the light for the day and
[1:24:38] they begin to they begin to share the
[1:24:41] word they begin to exhibit the life and
[1:24:43] they begin to manifest the light and
[1:24:45] that light brings others to life
[1:24:49] and the voice of many waters is the
[1:24:51] multitudes through the ages that have
[1:24:53] been testifying of jesus christ he said
[1:24:57] and all of them were the voices the
[1:24:59] voice of jesus christ by the holy ghost
[1:25:03] whose voice his voice but it sounded
[1:25:05] like many waters
[1:25:07] it sounded like many waters waters
[1:25:10] coming down through stream all bubbling
[1:25:11] over and running over the rocks and the
[1:25:13] torn it sounded like many waters many
[1:25:15] people but it was the voice of jesus
[1:25:17] christ by the holy ghost it was still
[1:25:19] one voice
[1:25:21] it was one voice coming through many
[1:25:22] waters
[1:25:26] now in in the message revelation chapter
[1:25:28] four part three where the member says
[1:25:30] now everybody can't be a preacher
[1:25:33] but you've got a voice
[1:25:36] and if you can't preach the people of
[1:25:38] sermon if you're a preacher you're
[1:25:40] called to the pulpit to preach if you're
[1:25:42] not you're still a preacher
[1:25:44] so don't make that last quote stop with
[1:25:46] just the pulpit
[1:25:48] there's a lot of ways to testify of
[1:25:50] jesus christ
[1:25:54] but live the people of sermon
[1:25:56] let your sermon be lived and it's the
[1:25:58] voice of god that'll bring reproach to
[1:26:01] them who reject it
[1:26:03] they say no one can put a finger on his
[1:26:05] or her life they're sweet uh living they
[1:26:08] if there ever was a man of god it's that
[1:26:10] man or that woman see live your sermons
[1:26:12] don't try to preach them if you're not
[1:26:14] called to be a preacher you get it all
[1:26:16] mixed up anyhow and messed up and you'll
[1:26:17] get people tangled up and you don't know
[1:26:20] well you'll ruin them and yourself too
[1:26:23] just live your sermon
[1:26:25] the preacher is called to preach this
[1:26:26] and to live it too
[1:26:28] if you can't live it then you stop
[1:26:29] preaching it but you're supposed to live
[1:26:31] your sermons
[1:26:33] all right here was voices oh how we need
[1:26:36] in jeffersonville thousands of lived
[1:26:38] voices
[1:26:39] the thunder of god thundering out in
[1:26:41] sweetness and holiness how does that
[1:26:44] thunder thunder it's the life of jesus
[1:26:46] christ on display
[1:26:48] and it thunders out in sweetness and
[1:26:50] holiness purity undefiled lives walking
[1:26:55] around in the earth today without a
[1:26:56] blemish
[1:26:57] yes sir real christians that's thunder
[1:27:00] against the enemy
[1:27:02] the devil don't care how loud you can
[1:27:03] holler the devil don't care how much you
[1:27:05] can jump or how much you can do this or
[1:27:07] shout but what hurts the devil is to see
[1:27:09] that sanctified holy life consecrated to
[1:27:13] god
[1:27:13] say anything to him call him anything
[1:27:15] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:27:17] right on oh my that throws him away
[1:27:20] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:27:24] just like while you say if i could
[1:27:25] preach like billy graham or oral roberts
[1:27:27] or somebody a great influential speaker
[1:27:29] oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at
[1:27:31] that
[1:27:36] it's not always the sermon it's not
[1:27:37] always the mighty work
[1:27:40] you get all the theology you wanted to
[1:27:42] in all the seminary training and the
[1:27:43] devil just sit back and laugh at it but
[1:27:45] when he sees that life
[1:27:50] why does he fear that life
[1:27:52] because that life is light
[1:27:55] and that light brings life
[1:28:00] see if if no one
[1:28:02] if we had a message
[1:28:04] but nobody lived the message
[1:28:07] nobody else will come to light
[1:28:10] because it must be a living word that
[1:28:13] brings light and brings life
[1:28:16] the message must be lived amen for it to
[1:28:19] take effect it must be light for it to
[1:28:21] be light it must be manifest for it to
[1:28:23] be manifest it must be manifest from the
[1:28:26] seed when the seed comes to life it must
[1:28:28] manifest the life of the seed which is
[1:28:31] the life of jesus christ and that
[1:28:33] becomes light and that becomes the light
[1:28:35] of life
[1:28:37] and that's why the devil he doesn't want
[1:28:39] you to live the life amen he wants to
[1:28:41] trap you in compromise he wants to get
[1:28:43] you tied down in relationships tied up
[1:28:45] in all kinds of all kinds of things
[1:28:48] that'll tie us down and limit our
[1:28:50] expression
[1:28:52] but this is not the hour to be tied down
[1:28:55] this is to be hour to be set free
[1:28:56] because there's going to be a full
[1:28:58] display of jesus christ in a
[1:29:00] mini-membered bride to show what this
[1:29:02] message is all about
[1:29:04] this message is all about you and i
[1:29:07] coming to the headship and the life of
[1:29:09] the headship coming into the body and
[1:29:11] shining out through the temple amen
[1:29:13] through the stones clear as crystal
[1:29:17] shining where to the world amen what
[1:29:19] will it do it'll bring life to those who
[1:29:21] receive it and it'll bring death to
[1:29:23] those who reject it
[1:29:25] but we're not here to bring death we're
[1:29:27] not here to bring judgment i'm here to
[1:29:29] bring life i want to shine the light of
[1:29:31] life to bring life
[1:29:36] listen the vindication of the message is
[1:29:39] the life in the people
[1:29:43] god vindicated the messenger
[1:29:46] and he brought the message
[1:29:48] and the message came to wake up a
[1:29:50] certain seed
[1:29:52] and now that life has moved down into
[1:29:55] that seed that word that's come to life
[1:29:57] which is the bride
[1:30:00] she's come to the fullness of expression
[1:30:02] the hour for fullness of expression
[1:30:05] and she will be thundering out against
[1:30:07] the devil in sweetness
[1:30:10] and gentleness
[1:30:13] oh it may not be what we thought it
[1:30:15] would be
[1:30:17] maybe we it's not going to be what we
[1:30:18] thought the great showdown was going to
[1:30:20] be
[1:30:22] maybe you know the mount uh the mount
[1:30:26] zion showdown is not going to be uh some
[1:30:29] great exploit that we do some powerful
[1:30:32] sermon that we preach some
[1:30:35] but may it be
[1:30:37] the perfect life of sweetness and
[1:30:39] holiness
[1:30:41] sounding out
[1:30:42] say anything you want against him
[1:30:45] and he just goes right on do anything
[1:30:47] you want to them
[1:30:51] you know what i don't know what's going
[1:30:53] to happen next and i don't know what
[1:30:55] manifestation god's calling for next but
[1:30:57] i know one thing he's calling for us to
[1:30:58] manifest his life
[1:31:01] how it will all get together and what it
[1:31:03] will all be like i don't know but one
[1:31:05] thing's for sure it'll probably not be
[1:31:06] like what we expected
[1:31:09] and it probably won't be exactly what we
[1:31:10] imagined it'll probably be i mean you
[1:31:12] might have you might be closer than me
[1:31:14] but we're still going to be off
[1:31:16] so if you're closer than me you can be
[1:31:18] happy you were closer than me but you're
[1:31:19] still off
[1:31:22] and i'm still off
[1:31:25] but
[1:31:27] we live in a world
[1:31:29] that is going crazy
[1:31:31] i shouldn't say that
[1:31:33] it's not nice they're not going crazy
[1:31:34] they've already gone crazy
[1:31:38] i'm talking about individuals i'm
[1:31:39] talking about the world the systems the
[1:31:41] systems of men have lost it
[1:31:44] there is no there's no more order
[1:31:47] there's no more confidence people don't
[1:31:48] have confidence in their governments
[1:31:51] people don't have confidence in those
[1:31:53] that rule over them they don't have
[1:31:54] confidence in their political leaders
[1:31:56] they don't have confidence in their
[1:31:57] financial leaders they don't have
[1:31:58] confidence in their bosses
[1:32:01] because the corruption is so widespread
[1:32:04] it starts from the top down when the top
[1:32:06] begins to corrupt and the corruption
[1:32:08] enters the church then it enters the
[1:32:09] government when it enters the government
[1:32:10] it enters the private sector
[1:32:12] and now people will keep all kinds of
[1:32:14] funny books and it's no problem because
[1:32:15] the government keeps funny books
[1:32:19] where did you learn this i learned it
[1:32:21] from the united states government
[1:32:25] the world has lost its mind
[1:32:27] they've gone crazy
[1:32:29] and under the birth panes
[1:32:32] under the birth panes that this earth is
[1:32:34] under
[1:32:35] you know realize the birth pains
[1:32:38] are running
[1:32:39] they're coinciding with the maturity of
[1:32:41] the bride
[1:32:44] so what are birth pains pestilences
[1:32:47] wars rumors of wars natural disasters
[1:32:50] such as earthquake storms floods
[1:32:51] hurricanes tsunamis you name it
[1:32:56] have we seen an increase in any of those
[1:32:59] all of those
[1:33:02] what are they they're birth pains
[1:33:05] and the earth is groaning in travail and
[1:33:07] labor amen and they wonder they want to
[1:33:10] see the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:33:11] they want to come back into the liberty
[1:33:13] the sons of god the earth is an
[1:33:15] attribute of god and it one it wants to
[1:33:17] come back into its ought to be
[1:33:18] conditioned as much as you want to go
[1:33:20] back to your ought to be conditioned
[1:33:23] so the earth is groaning and travail
[1:33:24] just like you're groaning in travail you
[1:33:27] want to go back to a glorified condition
[1:33:29] the earth wants to go back to an even
[1:33:30] condition
[1:33:32] because under the headship of the son of
[1:33:34] god it was right at one point and under
[1:33:36] the fall of the son of god it became
[1:33:38] wrong and it's been wrong since and it
[1:33:39] wants to come back to the manifestation
[1:33:41] of the sons of god to bring the earth
[1:33:43] back into its right position
[1:33:45] that right
[1:33:47] so the earthquakes the pestilence the
[1:33:49] wars and rumors of wars and and tsunamis
[1:33:52] and earthquakes and hail storms and
[1:33:55] tornadoes and odd places and political
[1:33:58] unrest and economic crisis and i mean
[1:34:00] the weekend the list can go on and on
[1:34:03] and on and on and what is it doing it's
[1:34:07] indicating how close we are to the earth
[1:34:09] bringing forth a bright new world for a
[1:34:11] millennium
[1:34:13] but the timing of the birth pains
[1:34:16] are matched to the maturity of the bride
[1:34:21] because this bride
[1:34:23] when the bride
[1:34:24] uh when the bride leaves then there's
[1:34:26] only three and a half years for the
[1:34:28] earth
[1:34:28] the birth this bright new world
[1:34:30] completely
[1:34:32] so it's got to work its way up because
[1:34:34] everything's timed and hinged off the
[1:34:36] maturity of the bride
[1:34:39] all right
[1:34:40] so but neither can the earth go ahead
[1:34:42] and travail if the bride's not coming up
[1:34:45] to this point of maturity
[1:34:47] so when we see all the things that are
[1:34:50] going on something inside of us comes to
[1:34:53] rest
[1:34:54] there's something inside of us that
[1:34:56] begins to rejoice not at the catastrophe
[1:34:59] not at the loss of finances not at the
[1:35:01] loss of the world not at the loss of
[1:35:02] human life but at the at the condition
[1:35:06] of the birth pain showing the condition
[1:35:08] of the bride and how close we are amen
[1:35:11] to jesus christ amen sitting on the
[1:35:13] throne of david again we're so very
[1:35:15] close to that that when we see these
[1:35:17] things it brings us into further into
[1:35:20] our right mind
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:23] everything the bible tells us everything
[1:35:25] the prophet told us we're seeing it
[1:35:27] unfolding before our very eyes and it's
[1:35:29] bringing a rest it's bringing a joy it's
[1:35:31] bringing a satisfaction it's bringing a
[1:35:33] peace it's bringing in anticipation and
[1:35:35] enthusiasm and excitement
[1:35:38] i hope that's what it's doing for you
[1:35:41] but what are those same events doing to
[1:35:43] the people in darkness in the world it's
[1:35:45] bringing greater fear i mean greater
[1:35:47] depression more mental illness
[1:35:50] it's bringing the the collapse of every
[1:35:53] system known to man riots in the streets
[1:35:55] and all kinds of things that are going
[1:35:57] on it's absolute chaos and the people
[1:35:59] are falling apart under the chaos
[1:36:03] losing their minds under the chaos and
[1:36:05] now we live in a world where that which
[1:36:07] is good is called evil and that which is
[1:36:09] evil is called good we're not waiting
[1:36:10] for that we're living right in the
[1:36:12] middle of that
[1:36:15] where if you raise your children
[1:36:16] according to the bible you are
[1:36:18] considered in some places a child abuser
[1:36:24] so the whole world under the birth panes
[1:36:26] is losing their mind
[1:36:28] losing their peace losing their joy
[1:36:31] losing their rest losing their security
[1:36:34] but under the same birth pains we're
[1:36:36] gaining security gaining rest growing in
[1:36:39] joy have a greater anticipation have a
[1:36:43] everybody else has lost any hope of the
[1:36:45] future we're gaining hope for the future
[1:36:48] we're on opposite tracks the world is
[1:36:50] law
[1:36:51] they've lost hope for another generation
[1:36:53] we we we're not banking on another
[1:36:55] generation i'm looking for a faith
[1:36:57] civilization to be established upon the
[1:36:59] earth
[1:37:02] and under that condition
[1:37:07] when we know who we are
[1:37:10] know where we are
[1:37:11] and know what all of this is about
[1:37:15] we shine a completely different kind of
[1:37:17] light
[1:37:18] than the rest of the world
[1:37:21] you want to talk about putting the bride
[1:37:22] on display
[1:37:24] i think she's being put on display
[1:37:27] i think the people you work with should
[1:37:29] know that there's something different
[1:37:30] about you
[1:37:32] than everybody else
[1:37:34] how could you smile and say good morning
[1:37:38] i mean didn't you hear what the
[1:37:40] president said didn't you hear this last
[1:37:42] deal and this and he said yeah
[1:37:44] shalom
[1:37:49] shalom what's shalomy
[1:37:51] said good morning
[1:37:53] but everything's falling apart and you
[1:37:55] can say but it is the rising of the sun
[1:37:59] this is not the end of my life this is
[1:38:01] the beginning of my real life amen this
[1:38:04] is what i've always wanted always long
[1:38:06] for this is what the christians have
[1:38:07] been wanting since the time of christ
[1:38:09] amen this is what the world has been
[1:38:11] trying to come back to since the fall in
[1:38:12] the garden of eden this is my greatest
[1:38:15] day
[1:38:18] you want to talk about shining light in
[1:38:19] a dark place when you take that attitude
[1:38:21] in that approach the world is getting
[1:38:23] set up this should be easier to witness
[1:38:25] than it has ever been at any time in our
[1:38:28] lives
[1:38:30] just live the life be happy be fruitful
[1:38:33] in your life live this word be good to
[1:38:35] your fellow man be honest in your
[1:38:37] dealings amen if you just do the basic
[1:38:40] things of christianity you're so far
[1:38:43] apart from the rest of the world that
[1:38:44] everybody notices we're not in the time
[1:38:47] now where you can live moral and be
[1:38:48] honest and work hard and blend in with
[1:38:50] the rest of society the rest of the
[1:38:52] society doesn't do that
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:55] so if you love your wife and you love
[1:38:57] your children and you sacrifice for
[1:38:59] others and you're kind to the people you
[1:39:01] work with amen and you're always wanting
[1:39:02] to do for someone else over yourself and
[1:39:04] you're humble and you're hard-working
[1:39:08] then you're the oddest person at work i
[1:39:11] guarantee
[1:39:12] then you are the stranger in your place
[1:39:15] at work
[1:39:16] when you don't cheat on your lunch
[1:39:18] breaks
[1:39:19] when you don't cheat on your time card
[1:39:22] when you don't falsify your paperwork
[1:39:26] actually what happens is you create a
[1:39:28] problem for everybody else
[1:39:30] like your coworker is like man would you
[1:39:32] stop it your supervisor's like listen we
[1:39:34] got a status quo here
[1:39:37] and your life is exposing everything
[1:39:39] else
[1:39:40] it's shining light in the darkness and
[1:39:43] we're not talking about super spiritual
[1:39:45] gifts we're talking about just living a
[1:39:46] basic christian life
[1:39:52] what are you saying brother chad
[1:39:54] i'm saying the blood is still speaking
[1:39:58] i say today the blood is still speaking
[1:40:00] and it's speaking through the voice of
[1:40:02] many waters
[1:40:04] it's the holy ghost it's the voice of
[1:40:06] jesus christ to the holy ghost and it's
[1:40:08] still speaking and it may use words may
[1:40:10] use actions but it's still speaking
[1:40:15] brother remember said in the message
[1:40:17] life he said i want to speak on a
[1:40:18] subject for about 20-30 minutes of life
[1:40:21] life is what controls us
[1:40:23] we are known by the life that we live
[1:40:25] and it's been said that your life speaks
[1:40:27] so loud that i can't hear your testimony
[1:40:30] so therefore to live a sermon would much
[1:40:32] better than to preach me one
[1:40:36] the life you live shows what character
[1:40:38] you are
[1:40:39] your life always built your character
[1:40:43] and version in hebrews from 1957 he says
[1:40:46] and that's the way you are in your
[1:40:47] behavior of life tells what you are
[1:40:50] as we had i went through a lesson or two
[1:40:52] ago and methodist people wanted to
[1:40:54] declare when you shout you got it the
[1:40:56] pentecost will say when you spoke with
[1:40:58] tongues you got it the shaker said when
[1:41:00] you shake you got it the pennsylvania
[1:41:02] shakers and we find out that they're all
[1:41:04] wrong
[1:41:05] your life declares it
[1:41:07] your person declares what you are a man
[1:41:10] is known by his works and whatever your
[1:41:11] life is you've heard the old story your
[1:41:14] life speaks so loud i can't hear your
[1:41:16] words so whatever you are you are the
[1:41:18] life that you live shows what kind of
[1:41:20] spirit is in you
[1:41:23] and then you may impersonate the wrong
[1:41:24] thing or impersonate the right thing may
[1:41:26] i say you may impersonate a christian
[1:41:29] but there will by and by come a time
[1:41:32] when the strain will be put on then
[1:41:34] it'll show what you are
[1:41:36] a chain is strongest at its weakest link
[1:41:40] when christ the son of god was put to
[1:41:42] the test it showed what he was sure
[1:41:45] when you're put to the test
[1:41:47] it'll prove what you are
[1:41:49] your life always reflects what's on the
[1:41:51] inside of you
[1:41:52] by and by be sure your sins don't find
[1:41:55] you out
[1:41:57] this isn't the age to impersonate a
[1:41:59] message believer
[1:42:01] because the pressure's building
[1:42:04] by and by somewhere down the road
[1:42:07] that'll break
[1:42:09] you won't always be able to sit
[1:42:11] comfortably
[1:42:12] something's going to happen something
[1:42:14] will transition in your life or in the
[1:42:16] circle you circle with or somewhere
[1:42:18] around your life because god will not
[1:42:20] allow that thing to remain amen but what
[1:42:23] god wants is not an imitation life he
[1:42:26] wants the real life
[1:42:28] what we need is not a a copying or an
[1:42:32] imitating what we need is to come to the
[1:42:34] genuine new birth by the baptist holy
[1:42:36] ghost and be one of those voices that
[1:42:38] make up the voice of many waters
[1:42:41] not
[1:42:42] an imitating that eventually somewhere
[1:42:44] down the road will break
[1:42:47] but what we need is a living reality
[1:42:49] living through us
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:51] we need the manifested word
[1:42:53] to quicken us to life
[1:42:55] so that we can become the manifested
[1:42:57] word
[1:42:58] which is the light of life
[1:43:02] the blood still speaks
[1:43:04] does it speak through you
[1:43:06] does it speak to your life
[1:43:08] i'll say this the blood the blood life
[1:43:11] the life that was in the blood is still
[1:43:13] speaking
[1:43:15] it's speaking through the token
[1:43:17] and the token is in the bride
[1:43:20] and it's the voice of many waters in our
[1:43:22] day
[1:43:25] again in the token brother branham said
[1:43:27] the life
[1:43:29] watch

[1:43:32] for the blood see the life is took see
[1:43:34] the life it took for the blood the blood
[1:43:36] was applied and the life could not come
[1:43:38] on the believer then for the life of the
[1:43:40] animal but see instead of a human being
[1:43:42] it was a super super superhuman being
[1:43:46] and that makes the human being now not
[1:43:48] only a human being but he's a son and
[1:43:50] daughter of god the super super super
[1:43:53] super life that was in him comes back

[1:43:58] in the things

[1:44:00] denominational goer to a born-again
[1:44:03] christian filled with the spirit the
[1:44:04] life of god just flowing from you like
[1:44:07] sparks from an anvil
[1:44:10] as you walk
[1:44:11] catch this this get this mental picture
[1:44:14] brother brent's painting for us
[1:44:16] you're filled with the spirit the life
[1:44:18] of god just flowing from you
[1:44:21] like sparks from an anvil as you walk
[1:44:24] full of virtue and love and gentleness
[1:44:26] and as the holy spirit moving
[1:44:29] speaking
[1:44:31] as the holy spirit moving and speaking
[1:44:35] how's the holy spirit moving and
[1:44:36] speaking from your life
[1:44:40] there you are
[1:44:41] he said like sparks off an anvil you see
[1:44:44] the old blacksmith when he's working and
[1:44:46] he takes out of the coals the molten hot
[1:44:48] metal and it's glowing red and he
[1:44:50] strikes it with the hammer and while
[1:44:52] having sparks fly everywhere he says
[1:44:54] that's the way our life's supposed to be
[1:44:56] as we walk through this life that light
[1:44:58] is supposed to go everywhere amen
[1:45:00] through every circumstance in life
[1:45:01] through every blow through every
[1:45:03] blessing through every defeat through
[1:45:05] everything let the light let the sparks
[1:45:07] come off in the gentleness and the
[1:45:09] sweetness and the life of christ let
[1:45:12] this message live
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:15] let it be the living word the manifested
[1:45:18] word the the light of life to live out
[1:45:24] the life of jesus christ
[1:45:27] i want to end with two verses let's go
[1:45:29] to john chapter 7 and we'll finish with
[1:45:31] these two
[1:45:34] john chapter 7.
[1:45:40] jesus told his disciples he told the
[1:45:42] pharisees
[1:45:44] he said
[1:45:45] referring to john he said john was a
[1:45:47] burning and shining light
[1:45:49] why because john was the manifested word
[1:45:52] for his day
[1:45:54] and he said you were happy to walk in
[1:45:55] his light for a season but you didn't
[1:45:58] stay there
[1:46:00] john was the light jesus was the light
[1:46:02] the manifested word is always the light
[1:46:04] and what's the word what's the portion
[1:46:06] of the word to be manifested in this day
[1:46:08] it's supposed to be the bride
[1:46:11] the body of jesus christ connected to
[1:46:13] the head and the life of the head in the
[1:46:15] body on full display that's the hour
[1:46:18] that we live in
[1:46:20] in john 7
[1:46:22] it says
[1:46:24] i'm going to read from verse 37
[1:46:27] john 7 and 37
[1:46:29] in the last day that great day of the
[1:46:31] feast jesus stood and cried saying if
[1:46:33] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[1:46:35] drink
[1:46:37] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:46:39] hath said out of his belly shall flow
[1:46:42] rivers of living water
[1:46:45] but this spake he of the spirit which
[1:46:47] they that believe on him should receive
[1:46:49] for the holy ghost was not yet given
[1:46:51] because that jesus was not yet glorified
[1:46:54] he said if any man thirsty let him come
[1:46:56] unto me and drink and out of his belly
[1:46:58] from within him
[1:47:00] will flow rivers of living water what is
[1:47:03] this waters of life
[1:47:06] it's all about life
[1:47:08] the life of the blood the life is in the
[1:47:11] word the the manifested light brings
[1:47:13] life and now we're talking about the
[1:47:16] rivers of life
[1:47:18] which flow from the throne of god
[1:47:21] let's go to revelation 22
[1:47:24] to the ending of the book
[1:47:28] revelation 22.
[1:47:34] revelation 22 and 17
[1:47:43] and the spirit
[1:47:45] and the bride say come
[1:47:48] and let him that heareth say come
[1:47:51] and let him that is a thirst come
[1:47:54] and whosoever will
[1:47:56] let him take the water of life
[1:47:58] freely
[1:48:00] where's that living water coming from
[1:48:02] if you've drunk from him and received
[1:48:04] the holy ghost it's coming out of your
[1:48:06] belly
[1:48:08] and in the end the bride the spirit and
[1:48:10] the bride the voice of jesus christ
[1:48:12] through the holy ghost
[1:48:14] now with the sound of many waters
[1:48:17] the blood
[1:48:18] is speaking today
[1:48:23] it can speak for you
[1:48:25] or it can speak against you
[1:48:28] let's let it speak for us
[1:48:31] let's live the kind of life where
[1:48:33] there's a clear voice going out so that
[1:48:35] others can find their way to truth and
[1:48:37] come to life
[1:48:39] let's be more encouraged to ever to give
[1:48:41] him preeminence because that's what he's
[1:48:42] called for in this day but it's not
[1:48:44] preeminence for a preeminent sake it's
[1:48:46] preeminence because that's the life of
[1:48:48] jesus christ on display
[1:48:50] and that's what's going to reverse the
[1:48:52] whole order of this world
[1:48:54] and that's what will bring life
[1:48:56] and in the end of the book the spirit
[1:48:58] and the bride are saying which one said
[1:49:00] it did they time it did they say it did
[1:49:03] they say okay one two three let's say
[1:49:05] no it's the spirit in the bride
[1:49:09] the spirit and the bride they're saying
[1:49:10] the same thing she's not taking her own
[1:49:12] mind she's not speaking her own words
[1:49:14] she's not speaking her own doctrine
[1:49:17] when we come to the end time the spirit
[1:49:19] which is the voice of jesus christ
[1:49:21] through the holy ghost
[1:49:22] which is the voice of the blood
[1:49:24] which the voice of the blood is the word
[1:49:26] and the voice of the the voice of the
[1:49:28] blood is the holy ghost
[1:49:30] and now the word with the spirit is
[1:49:33] speaking
[1:49:34] and a lived life
[1:49:36] in a word in a preaching in whatever it
[1:49:38] is
[1:49:40] when you go when you go talk to a
[1:49:42] restaurant and mom and dad are in
[1:49:44] harmony and dad opens the door for mom
[1:49:46] and she walks in and the kids are
[1:49:48] smiling and you all sit down and
[1:49:49] everyone cares for one another and loves
[1:49:51] one another and there's a respect from
[1:49:53] mom to dad there's a love from cherries
[1:49:55] from dad to mom and all the kids are in
[1:49:56] harmony nobody's screaming nobody's
[1:49:58] yelling nobody's playing video games on
[1:49:59] their phone
[1:50:01] and they're all sitting there talking to
[1:50:02] one another and they bow their heads and
[1:50:04] they pray over their meal i'm telling
[1:50:06] you the blood is speaking
[1:50:09] it's speaking amen when a woman walks
[1:50:11] through a store dressed like jesus
[1:50:13] christ would be dressed if he was in
[1:50:14] your flesh
[1:50:17] and a man conducts himself and dresses
[1:50:19] himself like jesus christ would dress
[1:50:21] and he says hello the way jesus would
[1:50:23] say hello
[1:50:26] i tell you the blood is speaking
[1:50:28] and what's it doing it's calling seeds
[1:50:31] to life if there's a seed out there come
[1:50:33] to life if not if it's rejected god will
[1:50:35] take care of the rejection judgment will
[1:50:37] come but the blood is speaking amen it's
[1:50:40] speaking life it's speaking light it's
[1:50:42] creating an opportunity amen when you
[1:50:44] walk down the street when you walk
[1:50:45] through the store when you the way you
[1:50:47] conduct yourself at work and handle
[1:50:49] yourself as a family listen don't think
[1:50:52] of it in the negative thinking in the
[1:50:53] positive with a sister when when you
[1:50:56] walk into that store every man there
[1:50:59] knows you're right
[1:51:01] i'm telling you he knows you're right
[1:51:04] it's inside of him and every woman knows
[1:51:06] you're right that's why she can't stand
[1:51:08] you
[1:51:10] it's the truth inside not on her mind
[1:51:12] but deep inside she knows you're right
[1:51:14] and that's why every woman in there
[1:51:16] doesn't like you and every man in there
[1:51:18] will respect you get out of the way open
[1:51:19] the door for you help you if something
[1:51:21] falls
[1:51:24] what are you doing
[1:51:27] you're calling out come
[1:51:30] come
[1:51:32] the life is here it's available it's
[1:51:34] real the word is still present the blood
[1:51:37] is still here there's a voice speaking
[1:51:40] come
[1:51:41] when when you sit down to that meal and
[1:51:43] bow your heads a family in harmony
[1:51:45] you're crying out to everybody in the
[1:51:47] restaurant come
[1:51:50] you're you're at work the way you
[1:51:52] operate the way you manage yourself the
[1:51:54] honesty the integrity with which you
[1:51:56] have your christian walk on display
[1:51:59] you're calling to your co-workers come
[1:52:03] the life is calling out if there's any
[1:52:06] life come if there's any life come amen
[1:52:09] that's why compromise is so deadly it's
[1:52:12] so dark perverted word is such darkness
[1:52:15] and such death amen this isn't the hour
[1:52:17] to take our own minds but to come to the
[1:52:19] message and say god shape me to be
[1:52:21] exactly what this word says
[1:52:24] because i want a life that calls come
[1:52:28] i want to walk and a walk in this life
[1:52:30] that calls come
[1:52:32] come
[1:52:33] come
[1:52:34] come to the waters of life
[1:52:38] the contrast is becoming greater
[1:52:41] and i believe it will become greater yet
[1:52:45] and that's the that's the opportunity
[1:52:47] for the light to shine brighter because
[1:52:49] the bright the light shines brightest in
[1:52:52] the face of darkness and the darker it
[1:52:54] gets the brighter the light the contrast
[1:52:57] is a wonderful opportunity to cry come
[1:53:00] come
[1:53:02] come into the word come into the way
[1:53:04] that's right come back to the lord
[1:53:07] when you
[1:53:08] when you
[1:53:10] structure your family structure your
[1:53:11] life structure your home dress yourself
[1:53:14] conduct yourself speak like a christian
[1:53:16] speak like christ you're crying to
[1:53:19] everyone you come in contact with come
[1:53:22] come to the light
[1:53:24] come to the life there's light of life
[1:53:27] flying out like
[1:53:29] like the sparks off of an anvil
[1:53:32] come
[1:53:34] would anybody
[1:53:35] like to come
[1:53:38] we know they'll be the last one come in
[1:53:39] one day
[1:53:41] and when they come in nobody else can
[1:53:43] receive that light
[1:53:45] but as far as we know that's not
[1:53:48] happened
[1:53:49] so i said let the light go out
[1:53:52] let the light of life go out
[1:53:55] and find a dormant life
[1:53:57] and call it to life
[1:53:59] and say come
[1:54:02] compromise is death
[1:54:05] leaving the word is death
[1:54:09] darkness
[1:54:10] cannot mix with light
[1:54:12] darkness brings death
[1:54:15] i say i'm more determined than ever god
[1:54:17] helped me to stay away from all of the
[1:54:19] world and all of the darkness
[1:54:22] let me cling to this word and surrender
[1:54:24] to this word like never before
[1:54:26] and let my life
[1:54:28] come
[1:54:31] how many believe the blood is still
[1:54:32] speaking
[1:54:35] speaks on our behalf but i want it to be
[1:54:37] a voice that's calling come
[1:54:40] to some predestinated seed out there
[1:54:42] somewhere and how will they know the way
[1:54:44] when they see the word living in you a
[1:54:47] written epistle that's when they'll
[1:54:49] start asking the questions
[1:54:51] that's when they'll come to the word
[1:54:53] that's when the light of life will
[1:54:54] strike their heart but this message has
[1:54:56] to come off the book and into a life to
[1:54:59] shine the light of the hour to bring the
[1:55:01] light of life
[1:55:03] i say god let it be in this vessel right
[1:55:05] here
[1:55:06] let's all stand
[1:55:08] musicians if you would come
[1:55:17] i would just like to go on the record to
[1:55:19] say
[1:55:20] shalom
[1:55:22] brother branham comes to this place in
[1:55:24] 1964 and in 1965 and he starts preaching
[1:55:27] some interesting messages
[1:55:30] he preaches shalom and shalom he says is
[1:55:33] a good morning

[1:56:18] time to be sad because there's a man
[1:56:20] here that can turn on the light
[1:56:23] and that light
