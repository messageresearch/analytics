And God, we're so thankful to be here together to worship you again in spirit and in truth. And God, as we worship in spirit and truth, we're depending on you to supply both the spirit and the truth, Lord. For God, everything comes from you. And everything we give is what we return back to you and what you've given to us. And God, may you find those that will worship you in the spirit that you've given and in the truth that you've provided in this day. And God, may you abide in the praises of your people. And may the sacrifices our lift, the praises that we bring forth and send forth be a sweet savor in your nostrils. And Lord, may you come, Lord, to us and break the bread of life and feed us your waiting sheep. For God, we're dependent upon your hand to feed us. And may you come now, Lord, and provide the food that we have need of for the hour in which we live. strengthen us, sustain us, guide us as the great shepherd and bishop of our souls. Lord Jesus, we ask for all things in your name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. While you're standing, if you want to grab your Bibles and turn to uh Genesis chapter 12, I just want to say I appreciate Brother Bob's testimony and I thank God for sparing our brother Bob. Amen. And the doctor said if this condition had went on for two or three more days, they said he wouldn't be here. But God had a different plan. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're thankful for that. Also want to remind you that we'll have communion and feet washing, Lord willing, this afternoon. Come back for that. And I just wanted to say that um our sister Joanne has to head back today. She was here visiting her daughter, Sister Rebecca, and brother Jeriah. Uh but her mother back in Edmonton had a fall and broke her hip. And when she was in getting uh treatment for that, they also diagnosed her with latestage dementia. So, Sister Joanne has to cut her trip here short and go back to take care of her mother. And she's got quite a trial to face when she gets back. So, let's just remember her in prayer. How many will be remembering Sister Joanne? God bless you, Sister Joanne, as you go back and our prayers go with you and may the Lord bless you and all that you need to do there. Also want to uh say we have visitors today. Brother Peter, sister Sharon Art have family visiting today. Sister Sharon's daughter Mary and her husband Jim are here. God bless you. Welcome. It's good to have you in the service. Amen. We heard a lot about you. So now we get to see you. God bless you very much. Amen. While we're standing, let's look at Genesis 12 together. Genesis 12. And I'm going to begin reading at verse one. Genesis 12:1. Now the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing. And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that cursseeth thee, and indeed shall all the families of the earth be blessed." Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. Amen. So, if we could pull up the PowerPoint and uh I want to look at the blessings of Abraham, the blessings of Abraham uh this uh this morning. Now, we know that this is when God be to call Abraham. And Abraham was uh just a man living in his town just like anybody else living in in of the Chaldes. And God came to him. He didn't come to God. God came to him. And God came to him and began to tell him these things. And can you imagine being that man? You're just going about business, living life, doing the thing you've always done in the community you've always lived, and all of a sudden, you have an encounter with God, and God speaks this to you. &gt;&gt; It's pretty amazing. Amen. Like I said before, this message made the Bible alive. It made the Bible characters real. It made them men of like passions like you and I, so that we could relate to them in a in a way. Before growing up, I always read the Bible. And these were always Bible characters &gt;&gt; and these were always Bible stories. Amen. But when a prophet of God comes along and begins to give us the background and take us deeper into these things, he begins to show us that these aren't Bible characters. These are people. &gt;&gt; And these aren't Bible stories. This is their life. &gt;&gt; This is what happened to them. Amen. And the same things are happening to you and I. Amen. And so the Lord said unto him,"Abram, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, and to a land that I will show thee." Amen. This is shocking news. He's saying, "Pick up and go." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing. If you could take note of one thing here, I want you to take note of this. And thou shalt be a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. No doubt Abraham when God begins to tell him these things. I will make of thee a great nation. I will bless thee and make thee thy name great. And no doubt when Abraham heard this, he probably had imagination like you and I have an imagination. And his imagination probably went all over the place with different possibilities and how this will happen and a great nation and my name great. He probably didn't expect to have all the troubles and all the ups and downs and all the bumps and bruises along the way that he had. He probably didn't realize he would be severely tested. He'd be severely tried. Amen. And all of this would come about. It would happen exactly as he said, but not anything like Abraham imagined. If God come to you and says, "Get up. I want you to move from here. Go to California. I'm going to make a great your great nation out of you and a great name." Amen. You just say, "Hey, praise the Lord. Greatness is coming my way." &gt;&gt; But it may not happen the way we imagine. Amen. But he but then he tells him, "And thou shalt be a blessing, and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that cursth thee, and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed." So we we know this involves so much. There's so much in this prophecy that God gives to Abraham, this promise that he gives to him. There's so much included in it, but I just want to talk about it. Amen. And I want us to realize when we read this that we are heirs of this promise. &gt;&gt; And we're going to show that in the scripture. We're going to go into that because we are heirs of the promise that was given to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you be part of Christ, &gt;&gt; if you're part of Christ and you're a heir of this promise. And so when he tells them that I'm going to make of thee a great nation. I will bless thee and make thy name great. Amen. You're included in that. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt be a blessing. You're included in that. and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that cursseeth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed. You're included in that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just look at this as we go along. This is the scripture we just read. But if we go to Ephesians 1:3 said, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love." Why were we chosen in him before the foundation of the world? So that we could be holy and without blame before him in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. Now we we read these scriptures so many times. We know them so well. Amen. But I want to just relate it to you and remind you when you go back and read this. What listen what does this have to do with you? Mhm. &gt;&gt; This is all what God's going to do. What in here says what you need to do or what you're going to do or what you ought to do or what your requirement is. It doesn't say anything. It's all about what God did and what God decided and what God's going to do. And he did it according to his good pleasure, according to his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. That does me a world of good, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if I find myself included in this scripture, that means if I believe by faith, amen, that I was chosen in him before the foundation of the world, that I would be accepted holy and without blame before him in love. That's why God did this, so that he could receive me. Amen. And he he did so having predestinated me to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. He wasn't waiting for me to decide. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wasn't waiting to find out if I'd be a good boy or a bad boy. He was not waiting on me. He already predetermined it according to his will, according to his good pleasure. And I thank God for that because if this isn't true, we're hopeless. &gt;&gt; Hopeless. &gt;&gt; But I thank God. I believe it to be the truth. Amen. But to believe it to be the truth, there needs to be an accepting of it as truth. Amen. And and I want to show you this scripture in 1 Corinthians 15:9. This the apostle Paul says, "For I am the least of the apostles that I'm not meat to be called an apostle." That means I shouldn't even be worthy to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God, I am what I am. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Paul didn't become something because he was a great man. He was what he was by the grace of God. And the grace of God is unmmerited favor. God's choice, God's favor, God's love from before the foundation of the world. Before Paul could be converted, before he was converted, before he repented, before he did anything, God had already said, "He's a chosen vessel unto me to bring my bear my name unto the Gentiles, and I must show him what great things he must suffer for my name's sake." He didn't ask him his opinion about that. &gt;&gt; He didn't wait to see if Paul would decide or say yes or say no. God already decided, "He is a chosen vessel unto me. He will bear my name among the Gentiles and I'm going to have to show him that through great things he's going to have to suffer for my name's sake. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wasn't waiting to find out how Paul would react to this. He had already decided the same thing to Abraham. He didn't wait to see how Abraham would react. God by his fornowledge knows who Abraham is. He knows who Paul is. He predetermined it according to his own will. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was speaking to one of the brethren there in Junction City uh last Sunday. We were having fellowship after the meeting and and he he was sitting there loving the word, loving what he was hearing, rejoicing in the revelation of the end time that God had a predestinated seed line, a a family, a race of people, a children. Amen. That he had predestinated and he was calling them back to himself through the message of the hour, back to the word of God, back to fellowship, back to himself, back to a union with Christ. Amen. And he loved all of that. But he says, "How?" He said, he looked at me and he says, "HOW DO YOU RECONCILE? HOW can you how can you get over the fact that that it's me?" &gt;&gt; Like, I'm not worthy. I'm no good. How can it be me? And there's other people that are seemingly better. They they do better. They they are better. And he was he was struggling with this question. And I remember the question because when we first came to the message, it was a huge question for my wife and I. She would ask me all the time, "But we're nobody special, but why would it be us? And why not them?" And she would name name other people, family members and people we knew. And I would just say, I I would just shrug my shoulders. I don't have an answer to that. &gt;&gt; Because you can show me all the reasons that you wouldn't choose me. And I would agree. &gt;&gt; But yet he did. &gt;&gt; Yet I believe. Yet I can't help but believe. Yet I'm identified by my faith. in the in the in the present tense work of God. Amen. And I I can't help that. That's something that God has planted deep inside of me and I can't help it. And so we were talking about this with this with this brother and he he was loving the word, believing it, receiving it, but struggling struggling with his own worthiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember something that Brother Eugene Bronn said to me. He was sharing a testimony. Sorry, I'm way getting off into different direction. So, just keep pulling, friend. This is when it gets fun. Brother Eugene Braun was sharing with me a story. He said he had a man who wanted to get right with God and he wanted to come to church and he I guess he knew a friend or somehow got acquainted with him and he started talking to this man and this man and his girlfriend or wife at the time, I don't know what what it was. They were, you know, hooked on drugs, smoking and all kinds of living a bad life, but they wanted they wanted to serve God. And so, Brother Eugene said, "All right, well, what a" He He dealt with him. He met with him a couple times and worked through some issues. And he said, 'I want you to come to church and give God a reason to bless you. Just come to church. And the man said, "I can't come to church." And the woman said, "You know this excuse." And he says, "But I'm still smoking and I'm still doing this." And brother Eugene said, "If you have to get up and leave service and go out and smoke, go smoke and come back." Amen. But give God a reason and let God deal with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was great. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says, the man says, "I can't do that." He goes, "I can't I can't do that." He goes, "I can't come. I'm this and that and that." And this is what brother Eugene Bronn said. It amazed me the way he said it. He said, "See how self-righteous people are even before they're Christians." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We would look at that as humility or sincerity, but it's actually self-righteousness. &gt;&gt; He had to clean up himself before he came to church. I got to quit smoking. I got to stop drugs. I got to do all of this before I can serve God and before God will accept me. Says who? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just let's just receive what he's given to us, what he's done for us, and let him do the cleaning up. Amen. Let it be his righteous and not our righteousness. Those are self-righteous statements to say, "I'm not worthy. I'm not good enough." Those are self-righteous statements. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because you have to believe I have to be good enough to be this. So then if I am bride, then you bring that self-righteous attitude right into your bride. And all of a sudden, pride comes with election. And pride should not come with election because you should be over here realizing I'm not good. I'm not worthy. I I can't do it in myself. But &gt;&gt; by the grace of God, I am what I am. Not by my worthiness, my deeds, my conduct, my valor. Amen. God didn't choose me for any of that. He didn't choose Abraham because he was the best choice in the town. He chose Abraham because he was predestinated to that position. &gt;&gt; Man, we might have looked around town and picked somebody else. &gt;&gt; This one's a civic servant. He's really able to sacrifice him, but look at the work that he's doing. I'd pick this guy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If I was going to start a new nation and I was going to have him bear my name and and show him the glory, I would pick &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm glad we don't pick. &gt;&gt; So when brother Eugene said that, all of a sudden my eyes open. &gt;&gt; Self-righteousness is hidden in so many ways. &gt;&gt; Even in a false humility where we try to say, "I'm nothing. I'm no good." Listen, that's where we all are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But even in my no goodness, he chose me. &gt;&gt; And I have enough faith to say by the grace of God, I am what I am. I'm a child of God by his grace. Not my deeds, not my doing, but by his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this is where Paul had to come to. I'm least of the apostles. Not even worthy to be called an apostle because of my persecution of the church. Paul had regrets. &gt;&gt; Paul had some things he was embarrassed about and ashamed of. And brother Bam said the stoning of Stephen always bothered him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It troubled him the things that he did. But he realized, hey, LISTEN, THAT ALL THAT TROUBLE CAUSED Paul to realize one thing. I am not an apostle because of my worthiness. And I'm not an apostle because of my good deeds. But by the grace of God, I am what I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I'll tell you this. I am not seed of Abraham because I was the best choice in my town when God came my way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I may have been the worst choice in the town, but he chose before I was born. &gt;&gt; That the purpose of election might stand not of works, but of election of predestination. That before the children were born, before Jacob or Esau were born, and either could do good or evil, he said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What could Jacob do? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So this is where we find ourselves. Amen. By the grace of God, I am what I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And back to back to Genesis 22. This is after the offering of Isaac. He says he's going to reconfirm the original promise. And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, "By myself have I sworn, sayeth the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and has not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply, thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice." He reestablishes the promise to Abraham and to his seed that they will conquer, they will overcome, they'll possess the gate of their enemies and the seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. Amen. Brother Beam says in modern events here, he says, "Now we are supposed to be the royal seed of Abraham. Isaac was the natural seed, but the faith seed, the faith and the promised word, the promised word, don't miss it, was that royal seed. That was the seed, Abraham's faith. We being dead then in Christ were Abraham's seed, heirs with him according to the promise. Amen. Let's look at this in the book of Galatians here. Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, "In thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham." So who are the children of Abraham? He says here, "They which are of faith." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who are the children of Abraham? They which believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; They which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And if children of Abraham, then part of the original promise. &gt;&gt; Are you part of the promise? &gt;&gt; By what merit? &gt;&gt; By God's merit? &gt;&gt; By what strength? By God's strength? By whose choice? By God's choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in this message, brother says, "And we are the children of Abraham." Hallelujah. Not as Isaac was, but his royal seed through Jesus Christ by the faith that he had, Abraham's seed, coming forth in the last days to shine like the stars, Abraham's children. &gt;&gt; And then further down in Galatians 3, he says, "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us, for it is written, cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree, that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith." So where does the promise? Where does the blessing of Abraham come? It comes through Jesus Christ onto the Gentiles. Amen. The Gentiles who believe. Are you a Gentile who believes? &gt;&gt; When where did the blessing of Abraham go? Where is the blessing of Abraham resting? The blessing of Abraham is resting right here. Because by the grace of God, I am what I am. &gt;&gt; I don't believe BECAUSE I'M SMART. I don't believe because I I have a better understanding because I study the Bible better. My mind is sharper. I believe because by by by faith by grace I'm saved through faith and that not of myself. It is a gift of God. God has given the gift to believe. He's given a seed gene of himself TO BELIEVE WITH. THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND BY FAITH I'M CHILD OF ABRAHAM. I'M PART OF THE SEED AND THE BLESSING HAS COME UPON ME. I'm included in THIS BECAUSE OF WHAT HE did for me. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen and amen. I'm so thankful. Amen. That we leave we we listen to read read the Bible and we look at Abraham's life. Listen, don't throw that to the past and don't leave that to the Jews. Amen. Through Jesus Christ, it all transferred spiritually right over to the Gentiles. And we are part of that seed. We are part of that promise and it's for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why, you know, we don't take this modern idea of we only listen to the New Testament. Come on. It's all the word of God. Amen. in the Old Testament was shadowing the New Testament. Amen. And and what Israel was naturally, amen, this gentile church is spiritually. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. In this message, Brother Rim says, "Now, but in this day, actually, I want to back up. Turn with me to Galatians 3. I got I had something that wasn't included in my notes, but turn with me to Galatians 3. I want to read down just a little bit further. Let's go to Galatians 3 verse 16. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not and to seeds as of many, but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ. So this seed of Abraham is Christ, &gt;&gt; the anointed word, &gt;&gt; the anointed one, &gt;&gt; this is Christ. So that means if I'm part of Christ, I'm part of this promise. Let's go to verse 29. And if ye be Christ, then are you Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise. &gt;&gt; Are you included? &gt;&gt; I'm included. By what merit? by none. I just want to say by the grace of God, I am what I am. &gt;&gt; You know, Abraham never woke up one day and said, "You know what? I'd like to be heir to a promise &gt;&gt; and I'd like to be a mighty nation &gt;&gt; and I'd like that and I like that. I'd like to." Amen. It wasn't his choosing. It was God's choosing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did Abraham have to make choices? Yes. Did he have to surrender to the will of God? Absolutely. God never forced him. He had to surrender. But it was God's choice. Abraham could be nothing if God hadn't predetermined it. &gt;&gt; Paul the Apostle never woke up in the morning and said, "You know what? I'm going to be an apostle to the Gentiles." No. He was working his way up to be a great one in Israel. &gt;&gt; He was climbing the corporate ladder, you say, of religion. He was working his way into a position and a place. Amen. He esteemed something else. Amen. But he had to count all of that as dung so that he could win Christ. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he never woke up and said, "You know what? I think I think God needs me &gt;&gt; to carry his truth." And he may have thought God needed him. I mean, that's why he was so zealous for calling them prison. But God had a whole different plan than what Paul had imagined, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, Jesus looked at his disciples and says, "You have not chosen me, but I've chosen you &gt;&gt; and ordained you that you should go forth and that your fruit should remain." It was God's choice. It wasn't their choice. Amen. You could say it this way. They they were subject to the will of God which he had predetermined before asking their opinion. &gt;&gt; But without asking their permission. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're in the same boat, friends. &gt;&gt; And it's not that we're not grateful to be in the position we're in. We're extremely grateful. But I didn't ask for it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I didn't push for it. &gt;&gt; I didn't uh I didn't try to persuade God to make me his child. &gt;&gt; Persuasion wouldn't have worked. I I never woke up one morning and said, "You know what? I want to be part of the end time bride." &gt;&gt; I had no idea there was an end time bride. I didn't know what God was doing in my generation. I didn't know what portion of the scripture was being fulfilled in my day. I had no clue what was going on. But God determined that before the foundation of the world and he made sure at the appointed time that the word of the hour and I came in contact to one another and there was a magnetism that was already embedded in my soul and it clicked. &gt;&gt; And that wasn't my choice. That wasn't my design. That wasn't my desire. That was God's. I'm extremely grateful for it. I thank God every day. Amen. That he chose me and that he died for me and that he made a way for me and that he sent the message my way. I THANK GOD every day because I don't know where I'd be without this message. Probably shipwrecked and derailed and messed up on the side of the ROAD SOMEWHERE. BUT GOD IN HIS great mercy and grace and love, amen, come down and found me where I was and grabbed me and pulled ME TO HIS SIDE BY HIS GRACE. &gt;&gt; And I can play humble all I want. I don't know how can I say I I don't want to say that I'm bride. That seems too PRIDE TO ME. THAT'S SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS. I'm just surrendering to what he's already done. and saying by THE GRACE OF GOD I AM WHAT I AM AND I'M NOT PUTTING ON ANY SHOW FOR ANYBODY and playing humble and playing nice and saying it's pride to say I'm BRIAN I'M BR LISTEN I'M NOT WORTHY OF ONE THING I'M NOT WORTHY OF THE TITLE AMEN I'M A DISASTER AND I STILL FAIL ALL THE TIME BUT BY THE GRACE OF GOD I AM WHAT I AM AND I BELIEVE IT NOT HERE BECAUSE HERE I GET QUESTIONED ALL THE TIME BUT DOWN IN HERE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT GOD HAS SPOKEN TO ME BY THIS END TIME WORD HAS BROUGHT ME TO LIFE AND I'VE CONNECTED ACTED WITH THE REAL GENUINE ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IT DOES NO GOOD TO KEEP PUSHING AWAY WHAT GOD'S DONE. WHAT IF PAUL WOULD HAVE NEVER ACCEPTED, AMEN, THE WORDS OF ANANAS AND WHAT THE SPIRIT SPOKE THROUGH THE pill through the pillar of fire saying, "But you don't know how bad I am. How can I SAY THAT I'M APOSTLE? HOW CAN I SAY THAT THAT GOD WILL JUDGE THE WORLD BY MY GOSPEL?" &gt;&gt; IS THAT PRIDE? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; Or is it the truth? &gt;&gt; Amen. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IS THAT PAUL ELEVATING HIMSELF OR IS THAT PAUL JUST ACCEPTING WHAT GOD said about him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's pride to subject God to our ideas about oursel &gt;&gt; and not to accept what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There has to come a time where we have to say, you know what, I don't know. I throw in the towel. By the grace of God, I am what I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, I would have picked somebody else. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't if if I was in your spot, I would have not have picked me. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have wasted my time and effort and I wouldn't have picked somebody that would have failed you so many times. But God, you had the right to pick and you picked and I say, "Be it unto me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; According to your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now now we see that through Christ and by faith the blessing of Abraham rest upon us. &gt;&gt; And this in this quote brother says now but in this day there is to come a super royal seed of Abraham. That's exactly what it be would be a royal bride to the royal promised son. As I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed. It'll be a spiritual seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is to be a spiritual bride raised up which will be the royal seed of the royal faith of Abraham's royal son. Woo. That's pretty royal. Amen. She is to come on the scene in the last days. And the time and the place is a promise that's given to her. According to Malachi 4, a scripture, there is to rise a message that will shake the hearts of the people right back to the aposto apostolic fathers again. There is to rise one on the scene in the power of Elijah that'll rise on the scene. A wilderness man that'll come out. We'll have a message that'll run right straight back to the word again. That's the hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. The hour for what? The royal seed, the royal bride to manifest. &gt;&gt; And brother says, "And we are the royal seed of Abraham, the bride." &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; By what? By the grace of God, &gt;&gt; I am what I am. Amen. Let's go to Romans chapter 4 together. Romans chapter 4. I'm still kind of just laying a foundation for a thought that I want to share with you. We know these things, but I just love looking at them. again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 4:3 says, "For what saith the scriptures, Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness?" &gt;&gt; Amen. I love that scripture. What was counted unto him for righteousness? His faith. &gt;&gt; He believed what God told him and it was accounted unto him for righteousness. not his deeds, his faith. Now to him that workketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. That means if Abraham had done something to earn his position, then God owed him. &gt;&gt; And therefore, it would not be grace. It would be debt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's why that man that brother Eugene was talking about, if he quit smoking and he stopped drugs and he cleaned up his life and he started attending church and then God saved him, God owed him for all the work that he did to clean himself up and come to church and God owed him salvation. &gt;&gt; This is the way our mentality works. This is our old mind. &gt;&gt; But if he in his wreck and his disaster and his failure submits himself to God and God recognizes his faith, Amen. in and comes and cleans him up, sanctifies him, fills him with the Holy Ghost. That man has nothing to boast of. Only grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only grace. Amen. Thank God for his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's keep reading verse 5. But to him that workketh not, but believeth on him that justifith the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Even as David also described the blessedness of the man into whom God imputth righteousness without works, saying, "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin." Amen. So I I put the scripture up here, the same one we just read, and I highlighted four words here. Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. Amen. His faith is counted for righteousness. God imputeth righteousness uh without works and the Lord will not impute sin. All All of these words come from the same Greek word. It's one Greek word and they're all translated. Uh there's three different ways here that they're translated, but this is that Greek word. And these are the usages in the Bible. It's used think nine times, impute eight, reckon six. It's 41 times in the New Testament, but it means to reckon, to count, to compute, to calculate, to count over. To take into account, to make an account of, metaphorically to pass to one's account. So it means to put on somebody's account. &gt;&gt; So that means if somebody went to the bank and put a million dollars on my account, &gt;&gt; they reckoned unto me a million dollars. They imputed unto me a million dollars. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They counted unto me a million dollars. &gt;&gt; The words used in the Bible counted, reckoned, reckonth, impute, imputeth, it's all the same word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is the meaning of it. So if one of you so generously goes down to the bank and and says, I want to impute unto my brother a million dollars, right? &gt;&gt; What did I do? Yeah. &gt;&gt; To earn that. &gt;&gt; It was imputed unto me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was reckoned unto me. It was accounted unto me. It was counted therefore unto me. &gt;&gt; It was given to me as a loved gift. &gt;&gt; So now let's go back and look at it again. What says the scriptures? Abraham believed God and it was accounted unto him for righteousness. It wasn't that Abraham was righteous. No, brother. Abraham's righteousness was not accounted to him for righteousness. That makes no sense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was already righteous. &gt;&gt; But when he was still a heathen idoltor, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Is that what brother said he was called from? &gt;&gt; God called him. And when Abraham believed God, it was put on his record and account, you're righteous. &gt;&gt; Not because of his deeds. You understand? If he did righteous deeds and was accounted righteousness. If I went and earned a million dollars and I took the million dollars I earned and put it in the bank. It was not accounted to me. It was not imputed unto me. I earned it. If Abraham was righteous and then God called him righteous, he didn't account him righteous. He didn't impute unto him righteousness. He didn't. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we on the same page? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, it wasn't Abraham's righteous deeds that made him righteous. It was his faith in the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And what word did he believe? The word that came in his day and hour. What God spoke to him, he believed it. Present tense truth. &gt;&gt; That's what makes sons and daughters of God to this day and seed of Abraham. They the seed of Abraham has always believed present tense truth. From the beginning of the Bible to the end of the Bible, you can find the seed of God because they always receive present tense truth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, to him that workketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. Amen. If I worked for a million dollars and put it in, or I worked for you for a million and I earned it and you put it in my account, you owed me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't know how I'd ever get you to owe me a million dollars, but maybe 10 bucks. &gt;&gt; Let's make it. I swept your driveway. &gt;&gt; And And you gave me 10 bucks. Then you gave me righteousness by debt. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; NOT BY GRACE. &gt;&gt; But if you just loved me and for no reason decided, now we're not going 10 bucks. For no reason, you gave me a million dollars &gt;&gt; cuz I can only earn $10 worth at a time. Amen. But it's going to take grace to get more than that. &gt;&gt; But you see the difference. This is what God did for Abraham. This is what God does for the seed of Abraham. We come the same exact way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But him, but now to him that workketh not, that means you didn't earn it, but believeth on him that justifith the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Even as David also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputth righteousness without works, &gt;&gt; saying, "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin." I'm going to highlight this whole thing. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. &gt;&gt; You mean there are people on this earth that God will not impute sin onto? &gt;&gt; Amen. What is WHAT IS HE SAYING? HE'S SAYING, LISTEN, BROTHER CHAD, HE'S SAYING YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING. THERE ARE A PEOPLE on this earth that can get away with anything because Christ already paid the price for the seed. THEY HAVE TO COME TO REPENTANCE. ABSOLUTELY. AMEN. THEY HAVE TO SURRENDER. ABSOLUTELY. BUT GOD will not impute sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man to whom the LORD WILL NOT impute sin. WHO SAID THIS? DAVID. Did David ever do anything wrong? &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God. When when David was found out for what he did wrong, he did evil. He did wickedness. Amen. above what I believe any of us could have imagined and how it affected lives and how it affected the kingdom. Amen. But when Nathan or when the prophet came to him and said and exposed him and said, you know, you're the one, he said, I am guilty. I have sinned. And immediately the next sentence out of Nathan's mouth was and God has forgiven your sin. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD NOT IMPUTE UNTO DAVID. OF COURSE, HE HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE, OF COURSE, he had TO SURRENDER. BUT GOD WOULDN'T SAY you're a sinner on your account as sinner. You're a sinner forever. NO, HE WOULD NOT IMPUTE that unto his son. Amen. But because David surrendered and believed, he kept imputing righteousness AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS. NOT BECAUSE DAVID EARNED IT, but because God determined it. &gt;&gt; I'm glad the Bible's honest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin. I want to be one of those men. I want to be one of those people that God will not impute sin to. Amen. Now, that's my foundation. &gt;&gt; Actually, I want to go back and read another script. Stay in Romans. If you started turning, I'm sorry. Go back to Romans chapter 4. I want to read a little further down. Romans chapter 4 and verse 8. I want to read this again. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. I can't think of a greater blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only. Is this only for the Jews or upon the uncircumcision? Gentiles also for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. Reckoned is the same word we've been talking about. Accounted. How was it then reckoned? Accounted when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision. Not in circumcision but in uncircumcision. And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised. And he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised, that righteousness might be imputed unto them also. That's us, non-Jews, non-law followers. Amen. When it came to us, he he showed him an uncircumcision in his calling before he was circumcised. Amen. He called him. He believed it was imputed unto him for righteousness. And circumcision was given as a seal of his faith. Amen. So that it could come to us. The whole purpose of that so we could realize. Amen. &gt;&gt; That he might be the father. Father. Who's my father? Abraham. &gt;&gt; What do I get if he's my father? That's a child. I'm his seed. If I'm his child, then I get the promise of Abraham. And the blessing of Abraham can come upon the Gentiles. and he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised, that righteousness might imputed be imputed unto them also. It wasn't just given to Abraham, but Abraham as a father received what his children will receive. And he's the father of all them that believe. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. That rightees might be imputed unto them also. and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had, being yet uncircumcised. For the promise that he should be heir of the world, was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. So when God says, "You're going to be heir of it all." Amen. That's through the imputation of righteousness by faith. For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void. and the promise made of none effect. Because the law workketh wrath, for where no law is, there is no transgression. Therefore, it is of faith that it might be by grace free gift. To the end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is Abraham your father? &gt;&gt; If you're of faith, he is. He is the father of us all. That means I'm a recipient of the blessing and the promise of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, praise God. &gt;&gt; The children of Abraham believed the way Abraham believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God wasn't asking Abraham to believe what had transpired hundreds of years ago when Noah built an ark. &gt;&gt; Amen. He of course he believed that or in Job's writings, but God was asking him to believe. When God came to him with truth, he asked him to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And from the beginning of the Bible to the end of the Bible, salvation has always been based on the same thing. It has always been based on receiving the word for your day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Always. It has never changed. It has always been. And the righteous have always been declared by those who could receive the truth in the day and hour they live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And those are the seed of Abraham. Praise God. By his grace, I am what I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to Genesis 20. We know this story super well. And many of you probably know what I'm going to say before I say it, but praise God. Let's say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Together. &gt;&gt; Genesis 20 verse one. And Abraham journeyed from then toward the south country and dwelt between Kadesish and Shir and sojurned in Guerrar. And Abraham said of Sarah, his wife, she is my sister. And Aimilec, king of Gar, sent and took Sarah. This is an interesting part of scripture because this is after the meeting on the plains of Mamry. Amen. In in Genesis 18 where God came in flesh and spoke to him and revealed the thoughts in Sarah's heart in the tent behind him. Amen. And brother Bam told us when they woke up, their bodies were changed. They were turned back young again. And now they go to Guerrar. And in Gerrar, the king wants this young 80year-old maid &gt;&gt; who's beautiful, more beautiful than anybody in his kingdom. and he wants the old lady to be his princess. But God's showing something transpired, amen, after the meeting with God and brought them back to their young condition again in preparation for receiving the seed. And so Abraham in order to save himself and made a deal with his wife. And when they went before, this is the second time Abraham does this. The first time is in Egypt. And when he goes to Egypt, he says, "Now you're a fair woman to look upon." This was many years before. You're a fair woman to look upon. and you know they'll say he's that's his wife and they'll kill me so they can have you. And he says do me this favor wherever we go. Amen. Just tell them that you're my sister. And so she did. And they went down to the the to Egypt and the princes of Pharaoh took her away and brought her to Pharaoh and they were going to they were going to I guess I guess make her one of Pharaoh's princesses. Amen. And all of a sudden it was uncovered and and found out. Amen. And Pharaoh sent them away. Amen. So now this is the second time that that uh Abraham is doing this and they go to Gerrar and they tell the king Aimilec that she is my sister. So the king took her. But look at verse three. But God came to Aimilec in a dream by night and said to him, "Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken, for she is a man's wife." And Aimilec had not come near her. And he said,"Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?" Said he not unto me, "She is my sister." And she even she herself said, "He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart, and innocency of my hands have I done this." And God said unto him in a dream, "Yay, I know that thou did this in the integrity of thy heart, for I also withheld thee from sinning against me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. Now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet. And he shall pray for thee and thou shalt know that thou thou shalt know I'm sorry. And thou shalt know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are in thine. Let me read that verse again. Verse 7. Now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live. And if thou restore her not, know that thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine. That's a lot of thous, all that are thine. Amen. Therefore, Aimilec rose early in the morning, and called all of his servants, and told all these things in their ears, and the men were sore afraid. Then Aimilec called Abraham, and said unto him, "What hast thou done unto us? And what have I offended thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. And Aimilec said unto Abraham, "What sawest thou that thou hast done this thing?" And Abraham said, "Because I thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wife's sake." Amen. So we see the story as the story transpires and begins to unfold. Amen. Aimilec in this story does nothing wrong. &gt;&gt; How many agree &gt;&gt; Aimilec is innocent? &gt;&gt; Who's guilty? &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; Is Abraham guilty? &gt;&gt; Is Sarah guilty? &gt;&gt; She was listening to her husband, but she still lied. &gt;&gt; They both lie. Well, it was kind of a white lie cuz you know they have the same father, so they're half brother and sister. &gt;&gt; The lie wasn't that they're brother and sisters. The lie was they left out the truth. We're husband and wife. &gt;&gt; So now they they they they have this situation where Abraham is saving his own neck. Sarah agrees. They go along the king of Gerrar and God comes to him in a dream. Amen. God is so merciful, friends, &gt;&gt; that he comes to this Aimilec and he begins to reveal to him in a dream that you look at the wording. Let's go back and look at it in verse four. But Aimilec had not come near her. And and he said, "Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?" Let's go back to verse three. But God came to Aimilec in a dream by night and said to him, "Behold, thou art but a dead man. For the woman which thou hast taken, for she is a man's wife." Look at what he says first off. Aimilec, you're a dead man. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; because you've got a man's wife. And he's like, "WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE. TIME OUT. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. you know my innocency and the integrity of my heart THAT I THAT I HE SAID AND SHE SAID LORD YOU KNOW AND LORD SAYS I KNOW THAT'S WHY I KEPT YOU FROM sinning against me I prevented you not to go near her this is my mercy unto you &gt;&gt; but in order to fix this problem you need to go to Abraham and have Abraham pray for you because if you don't you're finished &gt;&gt; anybody else read this as a &gt;&gt; head scratcher Yeah, &gt;&gt; you would think that Abraham should be going to Aimilec for mercy and for forgiveness, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That Abraham owes a Beimilec an apology. That Abraham should go to Aimilec and say, "Please forgive me and pray for me that God will spare me for this thing that I've done to you." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And Aimilec says, "Why have you DONE TO THIS? WHY HAVE WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS? WHY WHY HAVE WE OFFENDED YOU? Why would you bring this on our kingdom?" And and Abraham says, "Because I thought surely the fear of the Lord is not in this place and they'll slay me for her." He misjudged Aimilec. It was Abraham's assumption and misjudging Abec. And Aimilec proved that he feared God because God came to him and he responded to God. &gt;&gt; But it was Abraham's false assumption. Amen. Abraham as a man, he assumed they're not fear God here. Amen. But but he had it wrong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Abraham was doubly wrong. He was wrong in his assumption about Aimilec. HE WAS WRONG IN HIS LIE AND HIS ACTION. AND NOW AIMILEC is holding the consequences for Abraham's actions. &gt;&gt; And God in mercy comes to him and says, "Listen, you're dead. You're finished. It's over with you unless you restore that man his wife." Listen, there is something very different between the predestinated seed of God &gt;&gt; and the rest of the world. &gt;&gt; No matter how harsh that sounds, no matter how hard it sounds, it's an absolute Bible truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Abraham is dead wrong. &gt;&gt; Aimilec is 100% guiltless and innocent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who is God going to destroy, Abraham or Aimilec? Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Bible's not fair. &gt;&gt; But the Bible is righteous. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; if the Bible was fair, he could never receive me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I could never be saved. I could never be his if he played just fair. But I'm so glad he has a plan. And his plan is righteous and just and holy and merciful and good and kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is all things at once. And he has a way of navigating it all. I don't always understand how to navigate it. I can't always figure out what's right and what's wrong and what should be done in each circumstance. We as human beings, we read this story. Listen, if this had happened modern day, let's say this happens 2025 and you're asked to sit on the panel and judge. Who do you condemn? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; WHO DO YOU CALL GUILTY? WHO DO YOU PUNISH? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; That just shows we don't judge the way God judges. &gt;&gt; Our humanistic ideas of what's fair. Our humanistic ideas is what's love. Our humanistic ideas are not what's in this scripture. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But God knows best and God knows what he's doing and God has it figured out. If we go down to to verse 17, it says, "So Abraham prayed unto God, and God healed Aimilec and his wife and his maidervants, and they bear children. For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Aimilec, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife." The judgment of God had already begun. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The only way that God was going to lift this judgment on Aimilec and his household and everything under his headship, the only way that God would lift that is if Abraham prayed for him. &gt;&gt; Abraham the guilty party. &gt;&gt; Abraham the liar. &gt;&gt; Abraham the coward. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know, but to me, this is amazing. &gt;&gt; It defies all logic and reasoning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet, it's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to We've talked about a lot of these things before, but let's take this from another angle. Let's say you're Abraham. And all of a sudden, all of this transpires and it all comes out and Amalecch says, "This is God. Come to me in dream. This is what he told me." He said, "I'm dead. Our whole nation's lost. We're all in trouble if you don't pray for me. You're Abraham." And you're in this whole scene. And before then, I'm sure Abraham was praying because his wife had already been separated from him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She was already separated and moved off to the king's palace or tent or wherever she was. He was there. He was getting ready to take her for another bride. Abraham, no doubt, is like, "What is going on, Lord? What have I done?" &gt;&gt; My wife, your promise, what you said, the seed line, now she's going to be I don't know what to do. What am I supposed to do? And now God supernaturally comes on the scene to protect his own word and to protect his own servant. And God does all the things that he needs to do. And now Amalecch comes to him and says, "Why, Abraham? Why? &gt;&gt; Did I mistreat you? Did I not receive you? Did I not give you a place for your flocks and your herds? And I not welcome you into the kingdom. What have I done to offend you? Why would you do this to me, Abraham?" &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And Abraham says, "Because I thought you were a ranked sinner and didn't fear God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Make it worse. &gt;&gt; His explanation is, I had no confidence in you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Listen, you're Abraham now. &gt;&gt; And Aim said, "God told me that you have to pray for me or we're all lost. Would you please pray for me now?" And then before he prays for him, he says, "And and here's a bunch of gold and here's a bunch of oxen and here's a bunch and here's all the gifts and here's all the rewards for your failure and for your misconduct and for your lying and for your cowardice. I'm going to give you all these prizes. &gt;&gt; I'm going to enrich you more and give you so many pieces of silver for your wife to restore her, to redeem her. I give you all of this. Now, would you please pray for me?" If that was you and your face is flushed with shame because of your cowardice, because of your lie, and you realize the consequence of your action on another human being, and that they were doomed to die and fail on a whole nation because of you, because of your misconduct, because of your lie, because of your stories, what kind of prayer did he pray? Would you feel very confident in praying if you were Abraham? Would you feel like the super righteous son of God, heir of the world? &gt;&gt; There would be absolutely no pride in that prayer. &gt;&gt; There would be absolutely no self- glorification. &gt;&gt; There would be absolutely no self-confidence, absolutely no self asssurance for me. Anyways, &gt;&gt; you know what my prayer would be like? I don't know what Abraham said, so I'm not trying to add things to the Bible. I'm just telling you if I was in this situation, you know what my prayer would be like. Lord God, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; You know, this is not Abbeimc's fault. This is my fault. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, would you please forgive him because this is my fault. &gt;&gt; How would you pray &gt;&gt; after all that happened? And you'd be like, "See, Aimilec, I told you. Don't mess with me. &gt;&gt; There is no way." &gt;&gt; You'd be utterly ashamed of yourself. You'd want to crawl in a hole somewhere and die because everything you were doing was exposed and God knew and now your actions were destroying a whole another life. Amen. I think it would cause you to to to almost crawl on your knees and say, "Oh, God, I am so sorry that I did this and my actions brought this upon other people. God, would you please forgive them for my sake and don't hold them accountable for any of this? For this is not their fault. It's my fault. Amen. And God heard Abraham's prayer, not a bec's prayer. Abraham was the only one that could release a beilec. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE FAILURE, THE COWARD, the liar. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was the one with the promise. He was the child of God. He was the one that God was with, not a beam with Abraham. because it was not attached to Abraham's Abraham's condition was not based on his conduct. His condition was based on his position with God. &gt;&gt; And God chose that. ABRAHAM DIDN'T GOD CHOSE ABRAHAM. GOD SELECTED ABRAHAM. God told Abraham what he was. Amen. And Abraham believed God. &gt;&gt; Abraham earned nothing. Didn't do anything to earn it. HE WASN'T RIGHTEOUS. HE just had a capacity to believe the voice of God when he heard the voice of God in this day. And by believing it, amen, he became heir of the promise. He became the one that God was dealing with in all the earth. He's dealing with Abraham. And Abraham's his prophet and God is watching over Abraham. And even though Abraham's an absolute utter failure, amen. God does not condemn Abraham, impute unrighteousness to Abraham, impute his sin unto him, but God continues to hold Abraham in righteousness. AND ABRAHAM NOW has the prayer THAT CAN RELEASE THE ONE WHO'S INNOCENT. &gt;&gt; THE GUILTY IS PRAYING FOR THE INNOCENT. AND GOD WILL ONLY HEAR the guilty. God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Listen, when your humanity can figure THAT OUT, COME BACK AND TALK TO ME. BECAUSE OUR HUMAN nature and our humanistic ideas and our humanism of fair, equality, and all of that, those are humanistic ideas. THOSE ARE NOT GOD'S THOUGHTS. THAT'S A MODERN CULTURE IDEA of equality and fairness and even for everything. God's never played that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad he hasn't. &gt;&gt; But now I think Abraham learned something. If it was me, I would have learned something. I'm so careful. I want to be careful that I don't inject things into the Bible that aren't in the Bible. But all I can do, amen, is see that Abraham's a man of like passions as we are. And if I was in this situation, I'd walk away there from going, "Oh God, I don't deserve this kind of grace. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm unworthy." And I would also walk there realizing how dangerous I am. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To other people. Amen. &gt;&gt; How careful I would want to be from that moment on. The way I dealt with other human beings, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You say, "That's fine for Abraham, but what about for Abraham's seed?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we Abraham's seed? &gt;&gt; Are we part of the same promise? Amen. &gt;&gt; When God back in Genesis, whatever we read first, Genesis, I don't even remember now. &gt;&gt; 12. Thank you. Genesis 12, he said, "And I will make you a blessing." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Abraham was intended to be the blessing. Amen. And here to Aimilec, he had become a curse. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the only way Beimilec could be blessed was for Abraham to be the blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When I read a story like this and I go through it, there's nothing in this that makes me want to pump my chest and say, "I'm a child of Abraham." But when I read it, I say, "God, make me be careful." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Careful. Cuz if this is the reality, if this is the way you deal with Abraham and his seed, &gt;&gt; if those who bless you are blessed and those who curse you are cursed. If that's still true today, &gt;&gt; then God help me &gt;&gt; because I've been blessed to be a blessing, not a curse. And I don't want to be a curse in this earth. I want to be a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you would, let's let's look. We're not going to turn the Bibles, but I'm going to look at Job. I've got the scriptures all in the overhead. I want to look at Job for a minute. Job 1 6. It says, "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, go from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it." And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job? that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect man and an upright man, one that fearth God and is skeweth evil. This is the way God sees Job. Job is another predestinated seed of God. Job is another one, amen, that God has ordained, that God has selected, that God has imputed righteousness unto. And he's telling he's telling Satan, there's nobody like Job. Have you considered him? I know you're trying everybody out there, but what about this one? &gt;&gt; He's a perfect and upright man, one that fearth God and skeweth evil. He's another one of God's children. But Job now under affliction of the devil. First all his stuff is afflicted. All of his business and his assets and then his children and then himself and then children. And he's covered in boil sitting on an ash sheep. Lost all of his wealth. and he has three really nice friends who come along and decide to cheer him up by telling him he's a secret sinner and there's something wrong with him and he's under God's judgments and and and he begins to argue back with them and and and I'm just going to I'm just going to show you just a little bit of the dialogue from Job's side because Job is a little bit sharp, sarcastic, and cutting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. when his dialogue with his friends. It appears to me that Job has lost his patience &gt;&gt; with his friends. Job answers this way in Job 12. And Job answered and said, "No doubt, but you are the people and wisdom shall die with you." &gt;&gt; I mean, is that a little sarcastic? Maybe. &gt;&gt; But I have understanding as well as you. I am not inferior to you. Yay. Who knoweth not such things as these? He's saying, "Duh." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like, who are you talking to? Like, you think I don't know that already. And obviously, no doubt you're the people and wisdom shall die with you. You're the only ones who know anything. &gt;&gt; But duh, everybody knows what you just told me. I'm sorry I brought it. That's the modern version of the Bible. &gt;&gt; 21st century Bible. &gt;&gt; But, I mean, that's pretty much what he told him. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And they're dialoguing back. And listen, I just want you to see that Job is not being careful. Job is not being pious. Job is not being overly religious. Job's at his wits end. He's frustrated. He's hurting. He He's done. And he's he's lashing back. Job 13:1. Lo, mine eyeath seen all this. Mine earard and understood it. What ye know, the same do I know also. I am not inferior to you. Surely I would speak to the Almighty and desire to reason with God. But you are forggers of lies. You are all physicians of no value. Oh that you would altogether hold your peace and it should be your wisdom. Job has some good zingers. You know if he sent that out on a group text, we'd been sending back fireballs and thumbs up and flames. You got them that time. I love reading the Bible. Amen. It's amaz Everything we live is in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Everything, friends. &gt;&gt; Here's the third one I want to read to you. Job 16 one. Then Job answered and said, I have heard many such things. Miserable comforters are ye all. Amen. You might want to put that in your back pocket. You could use that sometime. I have heard many such things. Miserable comforters are you all. Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? I also could speak as you do. If your soul were in my soulstead, I would heap up words against you and shake my head at you. I wouldn't I could I could heap up words against you and shake my head at you, but I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief. Said, I wouldn't do what you're doing. I would be helpful. &gt;&gt; You're miserable comforters. You're physicians of no value. You know what I know. You you you think you're the people and all wisdom will die when you die. &gt;&gt; Man, I think Job is frustrated. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Angry, lashing back out at the things they say to him. And Job starts to defend himself to them. And in defending himself to them, Job starts to puff himself up to a place where he starts to accuse God of being unfair. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and and and in lashing out against them, his miserable comforters and his physicians of no value. And lashing out against them, he starts to accuse God of not being fair because he's defending his own righteousness before those who are accusing him of being a secret sinner. So in order to defend himself, he's got to bring God down so that he can bring himself up. And this gets him in trouble with God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. And then God comes to Job and he says, "Moreover, the Lord answered Job and said, Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him?" Are you my teacher, Job? &gt;&gt; He that reproveth God, let him answer it. You who can correct me, give me an answer, Job. &gt;&gt; Then Job answered the Lord and said, "Behold, I am vile. What shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken, but I will not answer. Yay. Twice, but I will proceed no further. &gt;&gt; Job had wit, wisdom, he had a sharp mind, and he had a sharp tongue. &gt;&gt; But then God said, "Shall you that contend with the Almighty instruct him? Job, do you have something to teach me?" Mhm. &gt;&gt; And he that reproveth God, let him answer. You've been bringing correction. You've been talking about what's right and not right and what deeds I should and shouldn't be doing. I'm here now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How about using some of your sharp wit and sharp tongue and your zingers on me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Job said the best thing you could say. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I am vile. What shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken, but I will not answer. Yay, twice, but I will proceed no further. Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind and it said, G up thy loins now like a man. I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me. Wilt thou also disenol my judgment? Wil thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous? Are you going to condemn me that you remain righteous? Then he went into a whole dialogue, &gt;&gt; no monologue because Job wasn't answering. &gt;&gt; Job knew enough now to keep his mouth shut. And God goes into a whole monologue of who he is and what he's done and what he set up. And he asked Job, "Can you figure this out? Can you answer this question? Do you know the answer to this? Do you know all things? You who are so smart and knows what's right and wrong." And and God put Job in his place. &gt;&gt; Did God put Job in his place? Job was putting his friends in their place. But then God come along and put Job in his place. &gt;&gt; Then Job says, "I've heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abore myself and repent and dust and ashes." Did God correct Job? Did Job take the correction? &gt;&gt; Did Job get the point? I think I would have. &gt;&gt; But look what he says next. And it was so that after the Lord had spoken these words into Job, the Lord said to Elephaz, the Timite, "My wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends. For you have not spoken to me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath." What &gt;&gt; did he just correct Job? &gt;&gt; But now he's defending Job. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Therefore, take unto you now seven bulldocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering, and my servant Job shall pray for you, for him will I accept, lest I deal with you after your folly, and that you have not spoken to me the thing which is right, like my servant Job." So, Elephaz the Timmonite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zofar the Neamothite went and did according as the Lord commanded them. The Lord also accepted Job. Did God accept them? &gt;&gt; No. He accepted Job. &gt;&gt; Because he accepted Job in his prayer, he accepted them because of Job. &gt;&gt; And the Lord also accepted Job. And the Lord turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends. Also, the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. This is a strange turn of events. Job. These friends come along and they're accusing Job and they're speaking on behalf of God. They're saying, "Listen, God doesn't unrighteously judge. You've done something wrong. This is all happening because you need to judge your heart. You're a secret sinner and blah blah blah and all of these things." And God's listening all the time. And God doesn't like any of this. &gt;&gt; But then Job in defending himself, he starts putting God on trial. I've done nothing wrong. I don't know why God's doing this. If I could go knock on his door, I would plead my case with him. I would say, "Why have you done this to me?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And then when it's all said and done, God's heard it all. But Job's position with God is different than these other three position with God. &gt;&gt; And God comes and corrects Job. Absolutely. God has every right to correct his children and will correct his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. But after God corrects Job and Job gets put in his place and he's humbled and he's back in the place that he should be, God comes to these other three and says, "Listen, you've not done right like you've not spoke right like my servant Job. &gt;&gt; So now what I need you to do is take seven bullocks and seven. I need you to make this offering." He never required Job did that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now come to my servant Job and offer up yourselves a burnt offering." and my servant Job shall pray for you. For him will I accept. He was not accepting their seven bullocks and their seven rams and all their prayer. He was only accepting Job &gt;&gt; and Job prayed and the Lord also accepted Job. And then because Job prayed and Job forgave them. Now listen, I wonder what Job's prayer was like. Can you imagine having just been put in your place by God? Hear &gt;&gt; him come down in a whirlwind and show you his might and his power and shake everything around you and then bring correction to you to where you say you're a vile and you repent in dust and ashes and you're nothing. Amen. Then all of a sudden, as soon as you get to the lowest of the lowest and you realize you're an absolute failure and you spoke against God and you repent and you're vile and you repent in ashes and in dust and you're nothing, And then God says to your friends, "Okay, now Job I love. Job's my servant. And Job said good things about me. You come over here and let Job pray for you." What kind of prayer do you think Job prayed? See you worthless physicians. See you no good, miserable comforters. I told you. &gt;&gt; I do not think that's what Job said. &gt;&gt; I do not think that was Job's attitude. I think what Job was probably saying is, "Lord, would you please forgive them? Lord, I realize now they didn't mean to. They were only doing to me what I was doing to you." &gt;&gt; And they were interceding. He was interceding for those three friends because he was the only one who could do it. And God would accept him, not them. And if Job didn't pray for them, I believe they would be in the same spot AMC would be in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So God had to accept Job. So they had to come to Job to be accepted by God because Job was the link between them and God. And Job needed to pray for them and forgive them and ask God to forgive them so that they could move on. And Job prayed and Job was accepted. And when Job humbled himself and now the ones that he was lashing out against with his tongue with the sharp words and the criticism and the zingers and the fireballs and the thumbs up and the clapping hands on the group chat &gt;&gt; now he changes his tone completely. &gt;&gt; Not calling them miserable comforters and physicians of no value. And he's not pumping his chest saying I know what you know. Apparently you think you're smarter. No. No. was, "Oh, God, would you please overlook their sin? &gt;&gt; God, what they said about me wasn't right, but Lord, I'm wrong, too. Would you please?" And Lord, I may have pushed them to it by the things that I said to them. &gt;&gt; I may have inflamed them by my words. I may have pushed them by my conduct. Lord, would you please forgive them? And God accepted Job. &gt;&gt; And God accepted Job. It didn't mean Elephaz wasn't far sorry. It didn't mean Zofar wasn't sorry. It didn't mean they weren't repentant. But they needed Job because Job was in a special position with God that they weren't. And when I read a story like this and I read a story like a beam legs, it makes me say, "Oh, God, help me be careful." &gt;&gt; I don't think we can get to the place where we can say, "I'm bride. I'm bride. I'm bride." Yeah, I believe that by faith and I'm eternally grateful that there's something in me that can say by the grace of God, I am what he said I am. &gt;&gt; And I do believe. But I think in all of that as we grow in our understanding and we mature and we come to a different place it should change our attitude completely. We say if that's who I am and if I'm seed of Abraham and heir to the promise and I'm in a position with Christ and it's a unique position in all the world that only a few are in by predestination then oh God help me be careful how I deal with other human beings and how I speak to them. and gone. If they can get in trouble for the way they speak to me, let me be careful for the way I speak to them. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If somebody could condemn themselves for actions they take against me because I'm under Abraham's PROMISE AND ALL. IF I AM PART of Christ and I am part of a one of Abraham's children by faith and I'm under the promise of Abraham, then the same thing is true for my life as it was for Abraham's. All who bless me will be blessed and all who curse me will be cursed. Not because I decided that. I couldn't have decided that. I can't put myself in that position. Only God can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he can by election and by predestination. And God determined that before. I never determined. You never determined. We never decided to be under Abraham's blessing. &gt;&gt; God chose that. And if God chose that and you accept it by faith, then let's wake up to it and realize that it matters the way we talk to people, the way we treat people, the way we conduct ourselves. Let's let's not do anyone wrong because we don't want anybody to do us wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I may be forgiven, but what about somebody else? &gt;&gt; Job may be accepted, but what about Job's friends? &gt;&gt; God may not impute Abraham's sin unto him. But what about &gt;&gt; Aimilec? &gt;&gt; God, be merciful. &gt;&gt; Open our eyes. Give us a greater sensitivity. Give us a greater understanding than we've ever had before. That we know how to walk in this earth as Christ walked in this earth to be his representation, to be his bride, and to have it truly all about us on our mind. We say that things are true. If they're true, they're true. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if they're true, they're powerful and there's consequences for it. In Genesis 31, this is when Laban is chasing down Jacob. Jacob has run away from Laban. He's took his wives and his children and he and he took off and Laban's chasing him down because Laban he snuck away in the night. And listen, I'm going to black this out. I know what's happening. I can feel it. Laban and Jacob have spent 14 years pulling tricks on one another. &gt;&gt; We read the Bible. &gt;&gt; 14 years. He switched his wages 10 times. He tricked him to get give Leah to him when he thought he was getting Rachel. And then he had to work another seven years for Rachel. And then in that period of time, he switched his wages 10 times. But every time he switched his wages, Jacob had another trick up his sleeve and he could do popppler branches and the water troughs and this one and that one and and no matter if he switched it this way, then Jacob would switch it this way. And God even showed him in a dream which cattle to choose. Amen. They were just pulling tricks on each other. &gt;&gt; Laban was a shyer. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's brother Ram said &gt;&gt; suppler was what his word means. Suppler and overtaker, one who overtakes. I mean he and he did it through trickery over and over and over again. And he did it for his brother. Amen. He he did it he took advantage of Esau and his weakness to get the blessing and to get the the birthright. Then he in with with with a big trick uh uh come up with by his mother Rachel. Amen. He goes and deceives his father to get the blessing. Amen. Listen, he's a suppler. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And not using good means. &gt;&gt; Now, if God was fair, &gt;&gt; yeah. Like us humans think that everything has to be fair and there has to be equity everywhere. When Isaac, Esau, and Jacob's father said, "Esau, I love you. I want to bless you before I die. Go out and hunt. Take your bow and get me h some venison and fix it the way I love it, and I'll bless you." And Rachel overhears the conversation and she comes and gets Jacob. Says, "Jacob, here's the deal." Amen. I go fetch two young kids. I'm going to dress them and get them just the way your father likes. Give. And she took Esau's garments that she had, put them on Esau. She took the skins off the goats because Esau was a hairy man. Put them on Jacob. She come with this plan. She said, "Go in and get the blessing." And he sneaks in there and his father said, "Who are you?" He says, "I'm Esau, your son." Mhm. &gt;&gt; Boldface lie. &gt;&gt; Absolute deception. 100% lie. As wrong as wrong can be. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where will all liars go? &gt;&gt; You think Jacob will be there? No. Because he was changed to Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz he was a child of God. Bold-face. Absolute lie. Trickery and your own family. Deceiving your own father. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Stealing from your own brother. &gt;&gt; I mean, does it get any worse? &gt;&gt; I mean, there's hardly any family estates that get this bad after mom and dad die and the fight breaks out over the estate, &gt;&gt; right? So, all of this mess and then he runs away and and there's a deception. His mom's in on it to talk to Esau and I can't stand these the these these daughters of Canaanites. They vex my soul. Send him back to get a wife and it's all a cover up. And then he runs away to escape from Esau. And he gets to Laban and God gives him gives him a good match. &gt;&gt; And the trickster meets the uncle who's a little better at it than he is. And they start pulling tricks on each other. And after so long, Jacob decides to run away. And he's going back to his father's house. And he runs away. And Laban is chasing after him. Amen. Because he stole away in the night. He didn't tell him what was happening. And Laban's frustrated. and he feels like he's been slighted and and he's going to go out there and he's going to make it right. But before he meets Jacob, it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. And he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days journey and they overtook him in the mountain Gilead. And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night and said unto him, "Take heed that you speak not to Jacob, either good or bad." Listen, is Jacob bad? &gt;&gt; I mean, Jacob is not the greatest fellow in the world. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the most upstanding character. He's not the most honest. He's not the most straightforward. He's not somebody you probably would have liked to have been friends with at the time. &gt;&gt; You certainly wouldn't want his brother. That's right. &gt;&gt; But yet God's still sticking up for him. &gt;&gt; And he's also saving Laban. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen, I know there's been a lot going between the two of you, and I know he snuck away, and I know all that's been going on, but you be careful &gt;&gt; when you go into Jacob's presence. Don't say nothing, either good or bad. Just keep your mouth shut because Jacob is already received the promise and the blessing and God has already confirmed the promise that he's a recipient of the blessing of Abraham and everyone who curses him will be cursed. So God warns Laban, be careful how you handle this one. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The deceiver, the liar, the cheater, be careful what you say about him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. My goodness, &gt;&gt; if you were Laban, you probably felt like you had a lot of justifiable reasons to say a lot of things, &gt;&gt; but God warned him not to. &gt;&gt; To me, listen, I'll tell you, I don't know who is elect and who's not elect. &gt;&gt; So, this makes me want to be careful. &gt;&gt; When somebody's rotten and doing rotten, I just don't want to say good or bad. I just want to keep my mouth shut &gt;&gt; and let God sort it out &gt;&gt; because I don't want to be f found fighting against God's elect and God's predestinated. I don't want to be found in that position where I'm speaking evil against that which God has chosen from before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; that Christ died and shed his blood for. Are they wrong? Sometimes yes. Sometimes they're completely wrong. Amen. But I don't want to put myself in wrong by condemning one that God is going to justify and that God has shed his blood for and that God has redeemed and is in the Lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So help us to be careful. And God was so good to Laban to come to him to protect Jacob. Jacob still needed a lot of growing. He needed a change in his life. He needed to wrestle with the angel. He needed to come amen to a different place. He needed to repent. He needed to make things right. He needed a change. And God was going to bring it to him. But it never changed who Jacob was. Because before Esau or Jacob were born, before they either did good or right, God said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now listen, after I tell you this story and all if I tell you all that Jacob's going to do to this point and all the things he's going to do and the lies and the deceit and the taking advantage of a weak brother and and taking advantage of his father-in-law and all that he's going to do and then you find out Esau was faithful to his dad and he was a good boy and and he took care of his old dad and he stayed. &gt;&gt; Which one would you pick? Oh man, I'm so glad God picked before. &gt;&gt; Before either were born, before either did good or evil, that election might stand. God said, "Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated." &gt;&gt; You may look at me somewhere in my journey and you may find an incomplete picture. Somebody that still needs cleaned up and fixed up and some repentance and some correction. And I may be like Job where I need to be smashed down to the ground by Almighty God a time or two more before I really vile myself. And &gt;&gt; but it doesn't change who I am. &gt;&gt; I may need more. God may need to work on me more. I may need more correction. I may need more humility. I may need more of a lot of things. But by the grace of God, I am what I am. I'm seed of Abraham and part of this promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know that whoever blesses me will be blessed. and whoever curses me will be cursed. So God help me to conduct myself in such a way that I don't bring condemnation to other people because of my error, my sin, my shortcomings, my tongue, my actions, my &gt;&gt; God, help me &gt;&gt; to live a sacrificial life, not just for myself, but for everyone else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say what you want, do what you want. GO OFF HALFCOCKED ALL THE TIME. GO DO WHAT YOU WANT. God will forgive me. I'm elect. I'm predestinated. But what are the trail of tears that are behind you? And what of everybody else? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we are who we say we are, there's a responsibility that comes with the position. &gt;&gt; And the message influence, brother Rams, as you know, there are so many of us and most of all of us influence somebody by the things that we do and the way we live and the things we say. We influence somebody. Somebody is watching your life. And then when we profess to be Christians, what type of life should we live? If somebody is watching us and your life that you live will reflect an influence on somebody, it might be their eternal destination will rest upon the way that you live and the things that you do. For they watch you. Somebody else's eternal destination will rest upon the way that you live and the things that you do. This wouldn't be the predestinated seg of God because they already &gt;&gt; have eternal life. &gt;&gt; This is somebody else. &gt;&gt; Somebody who's not bride, somebody who's not part of the covenant with Abraham, somebody who's not part of that promise. &gt;&gt; Their eternal destination will rest upon the way that you live, the things that you do. For they watch you. In Matthew five, Jesus says, "You are the salt of the earth. But of the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salt. It is therefore good for nothing, but to be cast out and be trodden underfoot of men. Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid, neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your father which is in heaven." Amen. We're supposed to be light. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be salt. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say all human beings are salt. &gt;&gt; And he didn't say all human beings are light. &gt;&gt; Who was he talking to? &gt;&gt; He was talking to his children. &gt;&gt; You are salt and you are light. That's not everybody. That's the predestinated. Then if we are salt and we are light then we should live salty and we should shine light. &gt;&gt; In the message identification the prophet says let your lives be so salty that others can watch the way you act and live that they'll want to live that way too. You know Jesus said you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its testimony, its savor, its drawing power then it can no more heal or save. Salt says when it contacts, we must be God's contact. We are his point of contact. &gt;&gt; I think sometimes we live sometimes we live life so egoentrical. It's all about us. &gt;&gt; God saved me. God loves me. God's restoring me. God's rapturing me. And it's all about me. And we forget sometimes that it's really about God. &gt;&gt; Why did he do it? for his good pleasure, according to his purpose, by his will, by his desire, by what he wanted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then he made me a child of Abraham and the covenants with me. And and but that covenant upon Abraham was that Abraham would not receive a blessing, for he will, but that Abraham will be a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Part of the Abrahamic covenant is that Abraham will be a blessing and that all nations will be blessed in Abraham. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So if that's part of the Abrahamic covenant, then that's on the children of Abraham as well. If you're part of the covenant, then God put you on earth to be a blessing. &gt;&gt; And I want to be a blessing. He said in Matthew 10, he that receiveth you receiveth me. He that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. And he that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water, only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. Mark says it this way. For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. &gt;&gt; If because you belong to Christ, somebody wants to do you some little service, love you, do something for you, they'll not lose their reward. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 25 together. Turn with me to Matthew 25. Matthew 25 and31 says in Matthew 25:31, "When the Son of Man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory, and before him shall be gathered all nations, and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd as a shepherd divideth his sheep from his goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left. Now when brother comes to the scripture he explains to us that the Bible says that he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep. He's not separating sheep and goats. This is just an analogy. He's separating two groups of people. The sheep have already been raptured. The sheep don't go to the white throne judgment. The sheep are not judged because there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. They've passed from death unto life. There is no judgment for those that are already part of Christ. &gt;&gt; This is a different judgment. So he's separating them now. And he shall set the sheep on the right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, come ye, blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the f foundation of the world. For I was hungered and you gave me meat. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. Naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee a hungered and fed thee, or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in, or naked and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick and in prison, and came unto thee? And the king shall answer and say unto them, verily I say unto you, in so much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me. Where are the brethren? The least of these my brethren he's talking about. Remember we've been going over the scripture. Amen. He that sanctifieth and them that are sanctified are all of one. Have we been going through that scripture? And therefore he is not ashamed to call them brethren. Who are his brethren? The ones that are part of him. Right? Amen. Is that true? &gt;&gt; So these are his brethren. So where are the brethren in this scene? We have Jesus on the throne. We have two groups separated out before him. One that did service unto him. He said, "When I was hungry, you fed me. When I was thirsty, you gave me drink. When I was in prison, you visited me." And there was another group here. He says, "When I was hungry, you did not give me any meat. When I was thirsty, you did not give me drink." And the first group says, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? &gt;&gt; He said, 'When you did this to these my brethren, where are these my brethren? They're those that are seated with him on his throne. &gt;&gt; Cuz he said, you shall sit with me in my throne, and you shall judge the world. &gt;&gt; They're there with him on his throne. And he says, these are the brethren. When you did it unto them, you did it unto me because they are part of me. And they are part of Abraham's covenant. If you're part of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed. And whoever blesses you will be blessed. And whoever curses you will be cursed. &gt;&gt; And here at the white throne judgment, there are those given entrance into eternal life. Why? Because when you were on this earth and you were part of Christ, when they did it unto you, they did it unto him. &gt;&gt; So how should we live? &gt;&gt; What kind of life should we live? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's look at this quote from the prophet. He said, "Now if we impute omniscience to God, we must also accept that he is perfect in wisdom and righteousness. This plan of election and reprobation is the wisdom of God revealed in all ages, even as it says in Ephesians 1 3-11." That's Ephesians 1, where he says that that we are saved by predestination and we are uh predestinated to the adoption of sons. He says this thus if God has so designed that there be those names those are there be those whose names are placed in a section of the lamb's book of life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept that if it also states that there are those whose names we were placed in the record of the book of life but in the fornowledge of God there they were to fall and have their names removed we must accept that if there are those whose names were ever placed upon the record of life, we must accept that also. And if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of God, who are his brethren, then we cannot but accept that? For who knoweth the mind of the Lord that he should instruct him? Rather, let us be subject in faith to him who is our father and live. If there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind to the just to the elect of God who are his brethren then we cannot but accept that &gt;&gt; why because they are part of Abraham's seed and they're part of the promise and the promise still stands true today &gt;&gt; that God sent Abraham to be a blessing and go Abraham's seed is to be a blessing. &gt;&gt; I want to be a blessing. &gt;&gt; Philippians 2 says that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world. This is the way I want to live. I don't want to give anybody a reason to mock. I don't want to give anybody a reason to curse. I don't want to give anybody a reason to hate. Amen. I want to take the responsibility of the position God's given me. And I want to intercede. I want to pray for. I want to stand in the gap for I want to be life, light, healing, everything we're called to be. &gt;&gt; I want to be salt. Amen. Praise God. I want to read one more scripture in in 2 Thessalonians 2:7. The scripture says, "For the the mystery of iniquity doth already work. Only he who letth will let until he be taken out of the way." This word letth means to hold back or to detain, to restrain or to hinder. So the mystery of iniquity does already work. This is the antichrist spirit. Only he that now restrains or holds it back will hold it back until he be taken out of the way. &gt;&gt; So there's two he here. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's there's a he right here and there's a he right here. &gt;&gt; Now, he that leth or restrains or hold backs the antichrist spirit, he will restrain it until he be taken out of the way. So, the antichrist spirit is held back from unleashing on the earth. Amen. That this will when when when this that power that lets when he that leth with restrains and hold back is taken away. Amen. Then then what we'll see is a tribulation period break forth on the earth when the antichrist spirit bust out and the full power. But what's holding it back? He that restrains. &gt;&gt; There's a restraining force on the earth that's holding back the full power of the antichrist spirit. Amen. And holding open a door of redemption and holding open a door of mercy. &gt;&gt; But let's see what brother Benham said about this same scripture because he said, "For the mystery of iniquity doth already work." deceivers, you see, deceiving the people off into something. That's a spirit of iniquity. Only he, which is God, shall let or restrain until the church, &gt;&gt; the bride, &gt;&gt; be taken out of the way. &gt;&gt; Who is the second? He early in his ministry, he says he, God, amen, shall restrain until he, the Holy Ghost, be taken out of the way. Absolutely. That's what it is. It's God. Amen. But where is the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost dwells in God's people. It dwells in the bride of Christ. AMEN. AND WHEN THE BRIDE IS RAPTURED, AMEN, THE THE Holy Ghost lifts. And the only place that there's light anymore, amen, is in Jerusalem, in Israel with the two witnesses that are bringing back the 144,000. Everywhere else goes IN ABSOLUTE DARKNESS. WHY? BECAUSE YE ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. YOU ARE THE SALT. AND WHEN HE TAKES you away, THERE'S NO MORE LIGHT FOR THE GENTILES. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO MORE SALT. THERE'S NO MORE CONTACT. THERE'S NOTHING. AMEN. SO, WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR? YOU'RE A BLESSING. AMEN. YOU'RE A LIGHT AND YOU'RE A SALT AND YOU YOUR PRESENCE, THE HOLY GHOST IN YOU IS HOLDING BACK THE FORCES OF DARKNESS AND KEEPING THE DOOR OPEN FOR MERCY JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER. &gt;&gt; DON'T BEGRUDGE BEING HERE. DON'T HATE YOUR LIFE. DON'T WISH YOU COULD GET OUT OF HERE. LET'S JUST HOPE THE RAPTURE COULD HAPPEN TOMORROW. IF I COULD STAY ONE MORE DAY AND ONE MORE PERSON can receive a blessing AT WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. LET MY LIFE BE A BLESSING ACCORDING TO THE PROMISE OF ABRAHAM. AS LONG AS THERE'S ABRAHAM'S SEED ON THIS EARTH, THERE'S A BLESSING ON THIS EARTH. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN ABRAHAM'S SPIRITUAL SEED, THE GENTILES, LIFT OFF, HE TURNS BACK TO THE NATURAL SEED TO THE 144,000. AND THAT will be the only place of light &gt;&gt; and the only place of blessing &gt;&gt; and it won't be anywhere else. &gt;&gt; Amen. God told Abraham, "You'll be a blessing." If you're part of Abraham's seed, you're here to be a blessing. Be a blessing to your family. Be a blessing to your co-workers. Be a blessing to your to your neighbors. Be a blessing to everybody you can be a blessing to. Because if they bless me, they're blessed. So if I bless them, maybe they want to bless me. And if they bless me, they'll be blessed. &gt;&gt; Yes. If I can be a good neighbor and a good employee and a good family, if I can be whatever that I can be to them, I'm not here for darkness. I'm here for light. I'm here for preservation. I'm here for life. I'm here for contact with God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; At the white throne judgment when we saw the scene in Matthew 25 when he says, "You fed me and I was hungry." because of that enter you into the joys of the Lord because of that. And they said, 'Lord, when did we feed you? When did we visit you? When did we do this good deed to you? So, when you did it to my brethren, you did it to me. What will it feel like that day when you see life go to somebody and you know &gt;&gt; it was because they did it to Christ in you? &gt;&gt; Because I was their neighbor. I was their coworker. I was their friend. I was their brother. I was their sister. It's not what they did to me. It's what they did to Christ who dwells in me. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Because you fed me." It's not my flesh, friend, but it's the promise I'm under. &gt;&gt; By by Christ, I've been included in this promise. In him, I'm part of Abraham's seed. Through him and by him, I'm part of that promise. And that promise is still in effect today. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If we will overcome the gates of the enemy, then we'll still be a blessing. &gt;&gt; If part of it applies, it all applies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said, God, make me a blessing. &gt;&gt; And he that now leth God, he God letth will let until he, the second he, the Holy Ghost that's in the bride, be taken out of the way. Let's be here. &gt;&gt; Let's not hate being here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As our life get difficult, some days are harder than others. &gt;&gt; Sometimes are difficult. But we live with a purpose on our life. And our purpose and our promise is I will make you a blessing. And I will bless you and I will make you a blessing. And I will bless your seed after you. And all that bless you will be blessed. and all that curse, you will be cursed and I will give you this inheritance. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm part of that. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm on this earth to be a blessing. And I say, God, help me to be a blessing. &gt;&gt; Help me. Help me to learn what Abraham learned in his dealings with the Beimilec and learn what Lot learned in his dealings with his friends. Help me to come to humility and realize that oh God I have to be careful. &gt;&gt; Help me Lord to be careful. &gt;&gt; Peter says, "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people." &gt;&gt; See, listen. We never called ourselves any of this. &gt;&gt; This is what God called us. that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Ephesians 5:8 says, "For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord. Walk as children of the light." So God help us to walk as children of the light. Amen. God bless you. Let's all stand. Amen. Let's just ask God for his blessings. musicians, if you'll please come. Dear heavenly father, I'm so thankful, God, for your word. And God, how real it is to us, Lord. God, for years, we hear these scriptures, we read them, we talk about them, we've heard them preached and mentioned, we've gotten excited about them, Lord, and we've rejoiced in the blessings you bestowed upon us and the promise you've given us. But Lord, I myself haven't always seen the significance and the consequences for these things. Not just for myself, but also for others, Lord. And God, if we are a peculiar people, if we are a holy nation, you've called us to a position, Lord. And because of that, there's still, Lord, opportunities to be a blessing. God, help us to be a blessing wherever we go and whatever we do. Lord, may you shine your light through us. May we not bring darkness. May we bring light, Lord. May we be the salt of the earth as you promised, Lord. Not a salt that loses its testimony, becomes indifferent, becomes grumpy, withdrawn, but may we be that salt that has a salty testimony, that can have impact on others, that can make contact like your prophet said. And may you live through us and touch through us and work through us and reach out to others through us. For Lord, while this door is open, while you who letth will let before you take yourself out of the way when you lift your bride up, may you reach out to others and be a blessing. And may others be blessed because they bless. And God, prevent us, Lord, from doing anything like Abraham did or Job or anyone else or Jacob that would cause somebody to curse. For God, if we've done that, if we've done something that caused somebody else to be angry with us and blaspheme or curse or God, we're sorry. And God, I want to stand in the gap for those, Lord, that have reacted to me because of my actions. Lord, I want to say, please forgive them. Lord, it's not their fault. God, I pray that you who have accounted righteousness unto me, I'm so unworthy of it, Lord. It's not because of my good deeds, but it's because of all that you've done for me by grace. And God, I pray you would take their error and put it on my account. and forgive them for my sake, Lord. God know there's so many times, Lord, in the past that I've been rough. Even in witnessing, Lord, I've been so hard and so rough and caused people to say things they shouldn't have said. But God, they may not have ever said it if it wasn't for me. People have taken actions that they shouldn't have taken. But Lord, you know, you know all things. You are just and you are good and you you understand. And Lord, in the light of these truths and the things that we see, I pray God that you would accept us and you would forgive those who we forgive. That you would let them go free and give them another opportunity, Lord, to enter into life. For God, we desire to be the blessing you've promised Abraham would be. We don't want to be a curse. We don't want to be darkness. We don't want to be condemnation for anyone. But God, my desire is to be a blessing and be light and be life and be salt. God, help me guard my tongue, my actions. Let everything I do be a reflection of you, your goodness, your holiness, your truth, your life. And God, I pray that we would no longer step forward rough, abusive, and angry, and short-tempered, and sharp tonged. God, that we wouldn't do things that trigger an evil response. But God, may we begin to do things that res people respond to in love, that triggers a response of love and appreciation and admiration, for then your blessings can abide and remain. have your way with each one of us, Lord, as we humble ourselves before you and repent, Lord, of our pride and indifference, Lord. Please forgive us. But help us to move forward from this day forward with our eyes wide open, with a better understanding, with a greater purpose and vision and goal for our lives. And as long as you leave us in this world, may we be a blessing, a blessing unto all we come in contact with, a blessing to all nations. May we be the blessing, Lord. I love you. I ask for your forgiveness, Lord. And may you touch all of those who we touch and who we forgive. May you forgive them, Lord. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. I just want to remind you, we have the communion service, communion and feet washing at 4:00. Brother John, &gt;&gt; just to be a blessing, I'd go on a journey. Climb the highest mountain and cross the deep blue sea. Leave home and family. I'll go where the spirit leads me. I'm giving my life away. Just to be a blessing. Sing that again. Just to be a blessing. I'd go on a journey and climb the highest mountain and cross the deep blue sea. Leave home and family. Go where the sea leaves me. I'm giving my life away just to be a blessing. Oh, once more. Just to be a blessing. I'd go on a journey. Climb the highest mountain and cross the deep. will see people and family. Don't know where the spirit leads me. I'm giving my life away just to be a blessing. We'll walk in the light. Such a beautiful light. Walk where the do drops of mercy are bright. Oh, shine all around us by day and by night. Oh Jesus, the light of the world. Oh, here the Savior's fall. Jesus the light of the world. Send the gospel truth to all.
