TRANSCRIPT
========================================
than silver are more [Music] compared with you does he get more beautiful every day hallelujah as he reveals himself and opens himself to us more and more through the word it gets more beautiful and more beautiful it takes our breath away all over again amen it's amazing how god is able to do that you may have served him 40 years maybe 50 years and maybe 40 50 years under the revelation of this word but he can still take your breath away he can still do things that that amaze you you can still do things that in a surprising way out of his word that just makes you love him all over again amen we just appreciate him so much while you're standing let's take our bibles and go to matthew chapter one i just want to thank god for a break in the weather so we can all be in church together it seems like it's been wild you know last night i was looking out the window of the office there before i headed home and i said thank you god for no snow on a saturday night three weeks in a row of snowstorms on a saturday night and i said thank you god and we just want to appreciate all of you who were pulling i know some of you had to stay home and wednesday night was bitterly cold you had to stay home but we understand that but we're thankful for those who could come create an atmosphere so that we could stream for those who weren't able to make it and we thank you for those who are pulling on the other end of a streaming line we felt that too we believe that and we're just so glad we can be together today amen i think you're supposed to get up in the high 40s today with sunshine we won't know how to act it's going to be wonderful before we read the scripture i just want to remind you that we've got brother vernon manahan will be here from the philippines we'll be here wednesday soon so please remember that i also want to say we had a wonderful time watching brother nathan and sister natalie erint her name changed yesterday get married yesterday and they had a nice wedding and we appreciate what god did for them and it's nice to see several visitors here that came in for the wedding we're happy to have you here god bless you all it's good to see you all right let's let's look at matthew chapter one i don't think it's any surprise that we're gonna start here in matthew chapter one we should have it fairly close to memorized by now but we'll look at the first verse the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham abraham begat isaac and isaac begat jacob and jacob begot judas and his brethren and judas begat pharas and zarah of tamar and pharas begot ezram and ezram begat abraham and abraham begat aminadab and amina debbie got nayasan and naasan begot solomon and solomon begot boaz of rahab and boazby got obed of ruth and o webb begot jesse and jesse begot david the king and david the king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of uriah and we've talked about tamar we've talked about rahab spoke about ruth and now with the grace of god and by his help we want to look at the why the her that had been wife of uriah which we know as bathsheba let's bow our heads and ask the lord to bless the reading of his word the heavenly father we thank you lord for this wonderful time for this day that we have lord to set aside to draw ourselves aside and come together to worship your holy name lord we love you as we look into your word we pray that you would do what no man can do we pray that you would come and break your word lord i offer to you myself lord this morning and i have nothing more to give lord i i cannot do anything without you we're just as helpless as a little baby lord but my god there was one day a little boy brought you some fishes and loaves and what we bring together is less than that lord we bring it to you but we lay it in your hands knowing you can multiply lord that you can work the supernatural lord and we're not looking to any ability of humans we're looking to you to come and take what's placed in your hand and multiply it lord and magnify your name and be glorified in this place speak to your children lord your word help us grow have preeminence in us lord in jesus name we pray amen you can all be seated if we if we keep our bibles here in saint matthew i just want to make note of something here in the first chapter we look we've got we've got four women mentioned that the four women we've been talking about and it says the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham so as we go down through this genealogy amen we go through go through this there's only these four that are mentioned in this section and in all four of them if you just look at all four all four of the cases are unusual all four of these cases and we spoke about this before but we want to just recap it here you take the situation of tamar and how tamar had to play the part of a harlot and lie with her father-in-law to receive the seed and to bring forth pharas and and and god would decide to include it right here now i don't know about you but if i was writing a book and i was writing a book about my children and my family and my heritage and all i was going to do i wouldn't write it the way god wrote his mine would be clean mine we would leave out all the things that were embarrassing or all of the things that were mistakes and we would just highlight the good things but god is trying to show something there there's something working through the scripture that's more powerful than a perfect life it's more powerful than good conduct amen and the thing that's moving down through the scriptures as we read we look we look at mistakes and adulteries and sins and murders and all kinds of stuff and it's going to become apparent as we get into bathsheba and david that all of this is happening here but yet there's a seed life that's moving through as it weaves its way through by predestination and nothing is going to stop that seed no sin no bad conduct no immorality there's nothing going to stop that from coming through because god has already assigned grace to that seed line that's his love that's his life his children coming down through and that's why there had to be a lamb slain not 2 000 years ago but there had to be a land slain before the foundation of the world when he took the names of that seed and he would record he would record that in the lamb's book of life and it would be sealed before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain in the mind of god before the foundation of the world because god is trying to accomplish a purpose and his purpose is so that he can be known by his attributes they couldn't be known in perfection he meant so he had to allow a situation where the imperfect can come so he will be known as a redeemer as a savior amen one that can cleanse and sanctify and all those things it had to be known this way but there's another purpose that's working all the way through the bible and all through scripture god is working the destruction of satan amen don't ask me how he's doing it but he's doing it he's doing it through weakness he's made straight his strength is made perfect through weakness amen and then he's allowing satan to trip and trap and and cause all kinds of problems to the seed of god amen so it looks like it's defeated it's defeated it's defeated and it's as if amen he keeps pouring concrete over it then the sun comes up and you see it pop out the side of the concrete our god will come and crack the concrete and you see it and break its way through amen he's always trying to stop the seed stop the seed in the church i believe it's the church age book brother branham says amen the devil's been exposed in all of his works trying to destroy god's people and discredit god's word so if you want to know what the devil's doing he's trying to destroy god's people and discredit god's word that's his works that's all he's trying to do amen he's not trying i mean to get another beer joint to come in he's not trying to get another house of prostitution to come in that's not where he's working he's working wherever the truth is coming forth trying to discredit god's word and destroy god's people amen so so if you want to know where his works are that's where he's at and he's always trying to do it and and it's amazing that he's always he's always down through here trying to derail the plan of god through sin and through through all kinds of terrible conditions but god's plan marches right on despite all of this stuff so when god is going to show the generation of jesus christ he doesn't list sarah he doesn't list rachel he doesn't list rebecca they're not mentioned in there amen because they all only had one husband they've they've done things right they got married the right way amen but now god's going to show that he can take wrong and turn it right amen he can take a woman amen who's been a harlot and rahab has been a harlot in jericho and he can take her and justify her and sanctify her by her marriage through solomon and through that he can bring forth the kinsmen redeemer boaz when we read through this it should make us the happiest people that have ever walked this planet because the thing the devil tries to do is to get us discouraged because of what's happened in the past amen but that's why the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world is because we would come into this condition and he would try to stop the seed through every measure that he could stop the seed by but yet god would shine the light that seed would be regenerated by that light and poke through wherever it could find and come to life you can't stop god's plan amen so now he he writes in this in this generation in this genealogy he puts tamar in there and and these women all neither none of these women all of these women had received seed from another source but none of these women could conceive on that seed they were predestinated women do you believe that predestinated women to bring forth amen in the genealogy of christ do you think that do you think that this portion of the scripture do you think it was written now put your thinking caps on do you think it was written nearly 2 000 years ago or before the foundation of the world it may have got inked out nearly 2 000 years ago but it was already decided in the mind of god that this is going to be the generation of jesus christ hallelujah amen you think god's taken by surprise that rahab ends up a harlot in jericho do you think he's surprised at that and he said oh i was going to use her amen to bring forth the generation of jesus christ but now i can't because she so defiled herself i was going to use him i was going to use her but now i can't because of all the mistakes they made amen you forget he's the lamb slain before the foundation of the world amen he can use whom he wants amen he's already determined and nothing's going to change what he's already determined and if he's determined that about me amen nothing's going to stop god from taking this lump of clay and fulfilling his purpose hallelujah so now we find out when he when he writes these genealogies you've got tamar amen then you've got rahab the harlan and jericho amen receiving seed but no conception until she comes to salmon and now there's a conception and now she she brings forth boaz and now boaz amen how is it boaz this rich ruler amen how is it that he's not married with sons how is it how is it it mean one of the most eligible men in bethlehem because the scripture says he was very wealthy one of the most eligible men was he married and his wife passed away with no children was he never married i don't know the bible doesn't tell us but somehow we find him not married with no firstborn son and now he's here what's he waiting for he's waiting for the plan of god amen and now he takes ruth who ruth had been married before receiving seed but there's no conception she's outside the land she's brought into the land and now boaz takes ruth the moabitess but boaz has no problem taking the moabite because his mother was the harlot from rehab harley rahab from jericho i mean he doesn't have a problem understanding how this can work how god can bring good from evil because look at his birth so now nobody else may have been willing to redeem naomi to take ruth his wife but boaz had no problem because there was an understanding in boaz of the plan and nature of god because he's here amen and he knows where his mother's coming through what his dad's coming through how they've met outside the camp how god brought them together how they established bethlehem and now he stands here amen the prince in the house of judah in the house of god's bread very very wealthy amen could have married anybody he wanted to bring up seed but he's got to wait amen for the gentile woman who couldn't conceive anywhere else to come into the land then he's going to play out redemption take her and raise up seed this is all in the first six verses of the new testament now boaz and ruth bring forth obed and obed will bring forth jesse and jesse will bring forth david the king and david the king begat solomon of her that had been wife of urias now you see how easy that would have been to leave out like begat solomon let's look at verse 6. let's go back to verse five so when we got boaz of rahab and boaz we got obed of ruth okay now from here on us look in obad begot jesse jesse begot david the king david the king begot solomon period verse 7 and solomon begot rebel it would have been really easy to leave that out you don't need it in here except for the fact god wants it in here [Music] why does he want a story like that put in a place like this hallelujah god is good friends so then we go from verse 7 all the way down to 16 we have all these genealogies coming through but there's no other women mentioned until we get to mary and she's mentioned in verse 16. so now in the generation of jesus christ there's a lot of other women there's a lot of other names that you can name there's a lot of other women that you can include in the bible amen in this generation jesus christ but god didn't want them included these were the only ones that he wanted to be included say thank you god and there's a mystery laying here and i just want to share with you just just what i see on this as you're coming through you come to solomon who's who he begot solomon of her that had been wife of urias from bathsheba and then there's nothing else mentioned now till you get to mary in verse 16. and you wonder why would you cluster them all here why here and not anywhere else why aren't why aren't there women sprinkled out through the entire thing you know make it fair every three or four verses throw a woman in there because that's not what god's doing amen he's not trying to say we've got so many men we got so many women we don't want the women to feel left out all of these women had a little bit of an odd thing in their reputation that made him a little questionable they were either gentile moabite they were either a harlot or they had played a harlot and tricked their i mean there's these aren't the examples that you want to set forth maybe when you're sitting forth i want to throw a few women in there to encourage the christian sisters so they can really look at a moral you would put rachel in there or rebecca amen these are not the women that you would put in amen if it was just a lesson on the fact that god uses men and women now it is a lesson that god uses men and women but he doesn't use them in perfection he doesn't the seed is coming through and he wants us to see these four women happen to be gentile women and these four gentile women are in this genealogy but it's amazing they're in the genealogy at critical points in the genealogy till they get to solomon and then they're not mentioned anymore and so the critical points now we come to to to jacob jacob has 12 sons one of those 12 sons the fourth the fourth son is going to be where the scepter lands where the king line is coming through through judah he's the lion tribe and we know that the king's coming from this and in this junction amen the sons of judah are wicked and god slays the first two and then tamar was married to the first amen he was wicked god killed him the second one refuses to raise up seed for his brother he's wicked god kills him the third one is withheld and now this whole heritage is in jeopardy now this whole line of judah which is the king line is in jeopardy and now there's something wrong in this line because tamar was the wife had already come into a union with the firstborn sign now they've got to raise up seed to the name of the deceased to keep that birthright coming down amen and now judah in his unrighteousness because when he finds out what tamar has done she lays the tokens of the man who she's pregnant by before him and he recognizes that he's the man and he says she is more righteous than i so judah in his righteousness is holding back his son from her because righteousness would be to bring up seed for the name of the dead and so tamar in her playing the harlot and trapping her father-in-law is more righteous than judah we're in a junction here where through tamar this this seedline has to come and at a critical point god throws a gentile woman in there through an odd circumstance and keeps the line going then we come down to solomon and rahab and now they're moving into the land amen they're moving into the inheritance they're coming into the word to establish the land amen and so now as judas coming to take their portion in the land there's another critical juncture in scripture they're moving into the land solomon will get his portion of land amen and raise up seed but now he can't take just any woman now he's got to have the harlot of of jericho at this critical time when judah is being founded in the promised land you see this wasn't just you know just a one-off he took a gentile woman and they got married no these were critical times these were important junctures that were taking place and that's when god wants to highlight now when they're moving into the land to establish themselves in the land now i'm going to take a harlot out of jericho move her outside the camp bring solomon the prince of the house of judah move him outside the camp they're going to unite together and they're going to establish bethlehem the house of god's bread and then now we come to another junction in time where now now naomi and ruth they come they come back into the lamb but boaz doesn't have a seed boaz has no seed and he's here in bethlehem and bethlehem is going to be the place where christ must be born that lineage must stay there amen so now there's apparently there's not a woman in bethlehem that'll work for boaz there's not a woman around for boaz so god will bring a moabitish woman amen into the land with naomi amen and that's going to be the one that's going to keep the seed line coming down and then the next one we come to is when king david is going to have an heir this is really important because the kingdom was really established under david a man after god's own heart and the kingdom of israel was established and now there's going to be a prophecy laid down for the son of david he said somebody shall sit on your throne forever and it's a prophecy speaking of christ but now this natural son that's going to be heir to his father is going to portray christ so it's very important what baby's born would you agree this heir that comes from david that's going to go to the throne it's very critical what kind of baby this is because this is going to be the one that portrays the coming prophecy of the coming king that will sit forever on the throne of david and so in order for god to do this right he's got to take bathsheba through adultery murder all this horrible stuff then marry her and the baby that they have is going to be solomon and solomon is going to be a scriptural type of christ coming to the throne in the millennium now i don't know about you but if i was writing the story i would do it different i wouldn't have had solomon come that way but god did and i believe it was perfect it was all wrong but it was perfect it was completely wrong but it was perfect don't ask me explain that because i absolutely have no way to do it i can't explain it it's 100 wrong it's all completely wrong but it's right or it works together for right say it that way so now i just wanted to point this out now for through through these verses that we're looking at we've got these four women coming up to solomon but after solomon there's no gentile women mentioned and now you have to ask yourself why is that what's the critical junction at solomon and now you realize solomon was a type of christ when solomon came to the throne there was peace now established throughout the kingdom and brother benham said they moved into their golden age to the type of the millennium the jews moved into so this was the highest the jewish nation ever came this is their high spot this is this is the perfect place for the jewish nation all the prophecies come to pass they moved into this position they had peace all around they had prosperity they had the son of david who's the son of god who's the builder of the temple they had temple worship in place they had the wisest man in all the earth sitting on the throne perfectly portraying christ in the millennium and from then on it was downhill next generation they split to north and south southern kingdoms amen they fall into discrepancy they fall into all kinds of trouble amen the north kingdom gets carried away to assyria the southern kingdom eventually gets carried away to babylon from that point on it's downhill and god did not want a gentile bride mentioned in the downhill slide amen she's there to bring amen the gentile woman is there to bring israel to the millennium that's her purpose through four stages she's here to bring him to a millennium because the gentile bride now is to bring us to christ in the millennium through four stages through four anointing things amen to bring us to what christ after that the downhill slide we're not going to mention the gentiles because the gentile woman today is to build to christ i think that's fantastic laying right in the word constructed just the way god wants it constructed hallelujah let's turn quickly and and look at first corinthians i just want to look at this before we jump back in the second samuel first corinthians chapter two i want to read something paul wrote first corinthians chapter 2 verse 6 how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery so he's speaking the wisdom of god but he's speaking in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither had entered into the heart of man the thing which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things was spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judge of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ so paul is here he's teaching but not in the teaching of man's wisdom he's teaching not he's giving understanding but not natural understanding he's here comparing spiritual things with spiritual things because they're given by the spirit of god amen so that's why the the the things that we look at and the things that we see the things that we look at in the scripture have everything to do with a spiritual revelation from god the father because when brother branham came and brought this message he didn't bring it in a denominational seminary way he didn't indeed with with man's wisdom amen he come comparing spiritual things with spiritual he comes showing us types and shadows and he's comparing the spiritual things now with the spiritual things then and it's the same thing jesus did it's the same thing the apostle paul did amen and so now their foolishness to the mind of a man but that's not for them amen it's for the ones that god will reveal it by the spirit comparing spiritual things with spiritual things so you don't the bible is not meant to be taught like a textbook teaching amen like a like a seminary type teaching on the textbook it's comparing spiritual things with spiritual things it's to be spiritually discerned by those who have the mind of christ that would save a lot of tuition and a lot of college campuses because it's just not necessary second samuel three let's turn there together and we're going to look at this story i have to confess to you at the beginning this is a strange story this is a hard story but this is god's story amen when we go to look at this there's so many things that you could get into and there's so many things that could be done with this but i really just want to stick with bathsheba and look at it from the angle of bathsheba amen at the angle of the gentile bride amen because you could go on david's side and talk about all the failure and everything and the repentance and i don't really want to labor in that you could preach a whole series that way but i'm just looking at the angle from bathsheba so that we can understand this second samuel 3 and 2. now we're going to start now as david is the king but david's kingdom didn't start off as him being king of the entire nation of israel it started off with him being king of the southern tribes he's king of judah and benjamin amen but later on the the the ten kingdoms would align with the southern two and it would become one nation one kingdom and david would become king of them so until that happened he starts off ruling out of hebron and he rules in hebron for seven years we look at this in verse two and unto david were sons born in hebron and his firstborn was abnon of uh a high nome the jezreelitis and the second chileab of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom the son of mekka the daughter of taumaya taumaya king of gesher and the fourth adonijah the son of hageth and the fifth shafatiyai the son of abbatol the sixth ethereum by igla david's wife these were born to david in hebron so now we find out that while he's king and hebron before the kingdom is united he has six sons this is going to be important as we go through the story to understand in hebrew and he has six sons but after the kingdom's united he moves from hebron into jerusalem and when the kingdom's united he established the kingdom in jerusalem in jerusalem as the capital and those are going to be sons born later so there was six sons born but the seventh sons not born in hebron amen we've got to transfer over to jerusalem now this will get good samuel chapter 5. keep your bibles handy because we've got a lot of scriptures to go through today samuel chapter 5. verse 4 david was 30 years old when he began to reign and he reigned 40 years in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in judah in jerusalem he he reigned 30 and three years over all israel and judah so this is this is important to note that he's got seven years so he completes a seven year cycle in hebron and at the in the seven year cycle he produces six sons but after he's finished the seven year cycle he's going to move into jerusalem and in jerusalem there's now going to be more sons born and that's what we're going to look at so all of this gets very interesting i think if it all of our understanding comes from what brother brenham taught us in the seals it teaches us through the opening of word through the church age he starts to teach us seven church ages three pools four anointings four stages of restoration he starts to teach us all of this and once once he opens our eyes and we can see the plan of redemption through this then you go back and through to read the bible and it's like it's there and it's there and it's like why seven years in hebrew why six sons you can only understand it when you understand the seals it only makes sense through the picture of the opening of the seal so god can explain how he's been redeeming who he's been redeeming the method of redeeming amen and he starts to show these things in these cycles so now let's jump over to verse 11. samuel 11-1 second samuel sorry second samuel chapter 11 verse 1. and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth the battle that david sent joab and his servants with him in all israel and they destroyed the children of amman and besieged reba but david tarried still at jerusalem and it came to pass in the evening time that david arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of his king's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon and david sent and inquired after the woman and one said is not this bathsheba the daughter of ilyam the wife of uriah the hittite and david sent messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned into her house and the woman conceived and sent and told david and said i am with child. so remember i'm just going to look at the angle from bathsheba i'm not going to try try not to look too much from david's view but from bathsheba's and now this is a woman who is married to a hittite and hittites are gentiles and now she's the wife of uriah the hittite who's a warrior in david's army and he's off fighting an army for fighting in a war for david but brother brahm says in the message of grace in in paragraph 112 he says now how could david take uriah's wife the beautiful bathsheba when he had 500 of his own but seeing her taking a bath and there's the negligence now she just forgot to pull the shades down when she was taking her bath and knowed that the king made a trip there by their every day down over the wall so brother branham's showing us another angle to the story we may not have always known is that bathsheba knew that the king took a walk there and she didn't pull the shades that's a modern way of explaining what brother branham is trying to explain that she was negligent in keeping herself hid from the king knowing that he walked there every day and he goes on in paragraph 117 he says bathsheba done wrong just like eve done wrong but adam was included in it brother ben's not excluding david david's guilty very very very guilty but he's trying to show us that bathsheba done wrong like eve done wrong amen and this is very very important because brother bram says in the invisible union of the bride of christ in 1965 said if you've united to christ instilled married to a denomination you're an adulteress you're a laodicea so so bathsheba even though this was the king of israel and even though the king of israel sent for her and even though amen you would think he's an authority and i have no choice amen but she had a choice she was negligent when she didn't pull the shade her husband was away in battle amen and brotherhood said she done wrong and because we're looking at her as the church we're looking at bathsheba at the church if you're united to christ christ who the king if you're united to christ and still married to a denomination to the hittite you're an adulteress you're a laodicea and so here she is now bathsheba even though it was the king even though it was a good king even though it was the king over israel even though he's a prophet amen and he's a spiritual leader and he's a great man amen she still could not go to him until her first husband dead now let's go over to romans chapter seven and pick this up and just read a couple scriptures here in romans romans the seventh chapter verse one now you know you not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a woman as long as he liveth a man has sorry the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from the law so that she is no adulteress though she'd be married to another man you see if that was all i wonder yeah so brother brown takes this and he picks this up in the invisible union in other places and begins to show that you cannot be married to a denomination and married to christ at the same time that's adultery now christ is the right king he's the right man he's the right one he's the goal and only he can bring forth the right son but until that old hit tight system is dead until the old husband is dead amen if she would go to him she is considered an adulteress hallelujah so now we're looking at the church so now we we know this plan and we're not going to go and read into all of this in detail but david comes up with a plan he tries to bring your uriah back and and he starts to bring uriah back with a report from joab so he can get uriah to go home so that he can lie with his wife so there can be a baby born and he's trying to cover up his sin and uriah is more honorable at this point than david brother said some wonderful things about uriah he said i can't wait to get over there and shake his hand because he said how can i go and eat my food and lie with my wife in the comfort of my bed when the ark of the covenant when the word and the and the lord's army is out there fighting a battle brother said oh i'd like to shake his hand hallelujah so hey amen the uriah the hittite is not some old evil wicked nasty guy that runs and operates a bar somewhere or a strip house amen he's a he's a righteous man he's a notable man amen he wants to do right yes sometimes we've got to be careful we think we think the wrong in the heir or the wrong husband or the wrong marriage we we think it's we think it's so nasty and so dirty and so but sometimes it looks really good we got to be really careful sometimes deception is so close not miles away but deception is so close that it looks really good so now david works this scheme and uriah is righteous and will not will not give up on us on his countrymen he will not give up on the ark of the lord and so david sends him back out with another plan tells joab send him in where the battles hot back off of him and let him be killed and so uriah is killed and we're going to pick up the story here in verse 26 chapter 11 verse 26. and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead she mourned for her husband and when the morning was passed david sent and fetched her to his house and she became his wife and bear him a son but the thing that david had done displeased the lord so so uriah dies she mourns and as soon as her morning is done he brings her in he marries her becomes his wife and she bears a son this is the son that was conceived out of wedlock and but the thing that david had done displeased the lord in verse 12 or chapter 12 verse 1 and the lord sent nathan unto david and he and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor we were very familiar with the story where where the rich man has lots of lambs amen lots of sheep but there was one poor little man only had one and he went and took his and slayed it and fed his guests and didn't sacrifice any of his own amen and david starts in his righteous indignation starts to pass judgment on this man amen he's going to have to restore he'll he'll be killed or all these other stuff and and nathan looks at david and says you're the man you're the man you had wives and god would have given you more if you asked for them but you took what uriah had and and and i don't really want to focus on david's i'm really trying to focus on the bright side but it's really hard when you get into this this this is really really interesting but we go to chapter 12 down to verse 13 after nathan speaks to david look at verse 13 and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord david didn't mince words with his repentance he didn't start popping out excuses but do you know you know i was i i was lonely that night and i had a real stressful day and as i walked by she had left the curtain up on the window he wasn't pointing to anybody else and he wasn't saying you know what i did well you know uriah wasn't really that great of a guy it had nothing to do with uriah he says i've sinned against the lord that brings a real repentance when you recognize who's been harmed and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord and nathan said unto david the lord has al lord also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not die boy that took a long time what david did is despicable what david did is reproachable it's never good in any scenario could you ever call what he did good what he did is vile what he did is low down what he did was cowardly not just takes a man's wife when he's out fighting for him amen and she conceives then tries to trap him into it and he would have let uriah believe that was his son the rest of his life dirty rotten tricks amen when that one worked he has the man murdered and so david says i i have sinned against the lord and nathan said he put away your sin there's no rosary beats amen there's no there's no repent there's no making it up to god there's no paying back for what you've done there's no you know after a couple years he'll accept you back or when you go and make this right and make that right and make that right he'll accept you back no he says he's put away your sin [Applause] hallelujah that didn't take very long friends remember brother branham's in the prayer line or i can't remember it's a prayer line or where it was he's talking to a woman and he sees the dream she's walking on white sand and she feels like she's washed away she's away from the lord but she wants to come back and brother bam sees the dream and he talks to her and he says i see the white stands you're walking and you feel like you've washed away but you want to come back is that right she says yes he goes well you're back now hallelujah why this is the seed line this is the one where the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world pointing to when christ would come in a physical manifestation in this dimension and shed physical blood to pay for the price amen and that was already laid down here that principle and now when he repents nathan says he's put away your sin can you imagine for us human beings it doesn't make any sense it's like there's no justice taking place but the justice is the dying lamb [Music] why why would david had to pay a price amen in his repentance why would david have to earn back the putting away of his sins and diminish from the price that was paid by the shedding of the blood so if you add rosary beads and you add works program and you add a season of time where you have to be a good boy before your sins are put away you have taken away from the price that was paid at calvary you have diminished the fact that god had a price paid in his mind before the foundation of the world and knew that he would abolish all the sin amen from adam and eve on because of the price that was paid and it was such a precious price how can you add to the price that means like somebody has paid the tens of thousands of dollars of bail for you and you say well let me help you out i got two pennies here and a nickel it's embarrassing keep your pennies and your nickels there's nothing you can do it's already been paid for don't devalue what's happened by saying well when i act right when i do better when i get in a better position then i'll repent and god will forgive me just give an honest hearted repentance you've washed away but you want to come back is that right yes you're back now oh i'm so glad the prophet didn't say well make sure you're at church every service don't miss a service read and pray and read your bible every day and you just keep giving yourself and someday god will wash away that sin boy if he said anything like that you and i would be in a works program where we keep jumping through the hoops amen and jumping through the hoops never certain if we're okay with god i'm trying not to preach david's side but but there's nothing you can do to pay the price for your sin now there's another side to that it's the chasing hand of the lord now you're going to pay a price for every sin [Applause] so you can never do anything to pay the price for your redemption you can never add to what was paid to be clean and free from sin you can't help him pay but everything you do as a child of god he has a good father will make sure you're chastened and rebuked and you're going to pay for everything you do wrong david did bathsheba did and all of god's children did but that has nothing to do with salvation that has nothing to do with your redemption we've got to draw a sharp line and say you know what if i'm suffering from the consequences of my action that has nothing to do with my salvation nothing to do with my redemption i'm purified by the blood of jesus christ pure clean snow white sinless virtuous spotless bride of jesus christ and some of us are sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ and still suffering under the consequences of our sin how can that be true it's true friends you as a child can be chastened you as a child and a human being there's a law of reaping and sowing and that'll work but that's not attached to your salvation that's not attached to redemption that's only this earthly journey amen and if you have to suffer under the consequences of sin every day in your earthly journey it will not change your destination you may have committed some terrible tragic sins as a young person that you can't erase there are some things that are done in the body you can't erase you can be justified but in this life you can never take back vergency that's been given away there are things that can never be changed in this life but it has nothing to do with the next life it has nothing to do with your sonship or who you are as a daughter of god or the price that was paid or your redemption on calvary it has nothing to do with that that's only this earthly journey so we may be suffering under the consequences but don't let the consequences you're suffering under identify you as a son or daughter of god [Music] amen be careful that if i'm still suffering because of things that i've made done wrong things that i did out of faith and things that i'd done wrong amen if i'm still suffering from that that's not my identity i'm identified with calvary as a redeemed son of god amen sometimes we think 20 years of sin 20 years of paying back that's just the way man does man can only add one and once two but god has a way of multiplying sometimes he can he can he can work us through those consequences we're sin much faster than we could ever imagine we'll just give him our life and just submit to him praise the lord so he says verse 13 again and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord and nathan said unto david the lord also also hath put away thy sin that thou shalt not die howbeit because by this deed thou has given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme that the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die see there's consequences and nathan departed unto his house and the lord struck the child and uriah's wife bear unto david and it was very sick david therefore besought god for the child and david fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earth and the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died what day the seventh day whenever we start to come across things like this it's like your radar goes up ding ding ding ding ding seventh day he could have died on the six he could die on fourth he could die on the 27th he could have died but he died on the seventh day a child died came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself if we tell him that this child is dead but when david saw that his servants whispered david perceived that the child was dead therefore david said unto his servants is the child dead and they said he is dead then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord and worshiped then he came to his own house and and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou has done thou does fast and weak for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou does raise and eat bread and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he is dead therefore should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not return to me super interesting passage of scripture now if you study through the bible and you read through you start to see that in hebron there was six sons born and then the kingdoms united and then they moved to jerusalem and in jerusalem you start reading through and there's no record of a son being born till we get to here this is the first place as you read through where a son's being born and and when they begin to number the sons we'll see this later they number the sons of david they number in hebron one two three four five six seven or five six and they tell you this is the fourth and this is the fifth this is the sixth but when they go to the sons of david born in jerusalem they don't number them they don't tell you what birth order they came in or how they came but when you read through the record this is the next child that's born to david that would make this the seventh son and the seventh son is born to bathsheba through adultery and the seventh son dies after it was cursed from nathan on the seventh day do you think this could have anything to do with the seventh church age quite possibly the seventh son dies on the on the seventh day after nathan condemns it and curses him and and so brother branham said it was just a baby the baby died and he prayed for the baby and it died and in the philadelphia and church age out of the church age book he says and not only does this age overflow into the last stage but the last stage is in many respects simply a carrying on of the six age so there's six sons in hebron the seventh age is just kind of a carrying over of the sixth age because something new has to be established after the seven so it's kind of a carrying over into to the sixth age the seventh age listen to this a very short age this baby only lived just a short time the seventh age a very short age gathers up into itself for one quick work all the evil of every age and yet all the reality of pentecost brother ben says in satan's eden the laodicean church age is the pentecostal church days because it's the last church age he says again in jehovah jireh we realize that the pentecostal church age in the last day is the laodicean church age so we know that the seventh church age the latest in church is the pentecostal church age here we've come to the seventh son who's going to die on the seventh day and and i want to read out of god's only provided place of worship in 1965 so now remember remember how we just went through the church ages the messenger to the church always comes just at the dying of an other church age always the dying of the pentecost brings forth the rapturing of the bride you got that the dying of pentecost brings forth the rapturing the bride now listen close the dying of luther brought forth wesley the dying of wesley brought forth pentecost the dying of pentecost brother bram said brings forth the rapture of the bride but listen what he says now the dying of pentecost brings forth the message now what is the message now it's the rapturing message the dying of pentecost brings forth the message now here it is right here patterned all through the scripture there's not a scripture in the bible but about what hooks write one with the other see all these types i have no education but i have the holy spirit that shows me through another channel that teaches me that from nature and that's by the word has to be the word brings his promise brother says and seed is not air with the shock in 1965 that shuck looked more like the seed until more until more than the pollen did and more than the stalk did but they were only carriers of the seed see luther organized the stalk died wesley organized the pollen died pentecost organized the life died and now comes forth the seed you can you can't go any farther than the seed he says in invisible union the bride of christ in 1965 said pentecost dried up and died like luther wesley and the rest of them so brother branham is clear that pentecostal denominational system is dead it died and it died to bring forth the seed it died to bring forth the next stage amen which is back to life again back to the original grain that went in the ground and so now we come amen here that we i want to go back and just read this again because this is the seventh son so an invisible union of the bride of christ he says if you're united to christ and still married to a denomination you're an adulteress you are a laodicea well that's how this seventh son was born she was still married to the hittite amen and then she she united with david and they produced the seventh son and that seven son came that way and now nathan the prophet puts a curse on that son and nathan the prophet once he curses the sign it dies on the seventh day that makes you look and say what comes next i'll tell you what comes next solomon comes next christ comes next after the death of the seventh on the seventh day makes way for solomon to come hallelujah praise be to god this bible is perfect now i want to be careful with with a scripture let's go back and read second samuel chapter 12. verse 23 322 22-23 and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he is dead wherefore shall should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him key words i shall go to him but he shall not return to me that baby wasn't lost and the true pentecost in the pentecostal age wasn't lost either that pentecost organization died to make way for solomon but those who were born again under that under that dispensation they're fine because david says hey he can't come back to me but i'm going to go to him who's david a seed of god and wherever david goes after he dies is abraham's bosom amen and that's the place of safety that's of salvation proving that that child that died wasn't lost it was saved brother brown tells us the same thing amen in in questions and answers in 61 he's talking about saul when saul brings up samuel through the witch of endor and samuel begins to speak to him says he told him the word of the lord said tomorrow you're going to fall in the battle and jonathan your son is going to fall with you and he said by this time tomorrow night you'll be with me if he was lost so was samuel the prophet that's fundamentalism you can see why it's so called see you'll be with me tomorrow night by this time see then if saul was lost so was samuel because they was both in the same place and you look at saul's life as a king who was disobedient to the prophet this would be into the word of god rebellious and wicked amen but he was part of that registry in the lamb's book of life amen and when he died he went to the same resting place that samuel went to and brother bam said if saul is lost then samuel's lost because they would have went to the regions of the lost not unto abraham's bosom so now when david says amen he's fasting amen what's he trying to do he wants god to save this seventh son he wants god to save amen in the seven day period he wants them to be saved be saved be saved amen keep him alive but god takes him anyways and that that that pentecostal age dies out amen and he realizes after it dies amen everything's going to be okay i thought while it was alive it could be saved but now that it's dead i can't bring it back from the dead but one day i will go to it proving that it was saved hallelujah friends this bible is perfect the seven days is really just a continuation of the six six sons born moving to jerusalem now there's another son born and is born by bathsheba but it's born the wrong way because the denominational idea hadn't died yet because pentecost denominated but something's going to change david had already taken her to be his wife and the child was born nathan exposed the sin he repented sins were washed away but the baby was cursed and on the seventh day the baby dies after the baby dies look what the scripture says next verse 24 and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in under her and lay with her and she bear a son and he called his name solomon and the lord loved him you have to say how how can you imagine reading this with no understanding of the message you've never heard brother branham preach before you have no idea amen and you read through this and you just read through you just read through adultery betrayal lies deception and murder and then the baby that was born through that is is stricken by the lord and he dies and the very next thing that happens is that david goes into bathsheba only this time bathsheba's condition is changed something's different about bathsheba now bathsheba is not married to the denomination anymore the hittite is now dead and now when he goes in to comfort her after the death of the seventh son now when david goes in now now she's his wife they've been joined in a union and now he goes into her to comfort her at the death of this son and she conceives and brings more solomon and the wording here is beautiful and he called his name solomon and the lord loved him hallelujah that makes solomon the eighth son and he's born in jerusalem not in hebron the first living son in jerusalem back to the capital again verse 25 and he sent now this is the lord and the lord and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and called his name jedediah because of the lord and the word jedediah means beloved of jehovah so he gives him the name solomon which means peace amen that's what david gives him the name solomon we're going to find out that actually that name came from the lord himself he calls him solomon and the lord loved him and he sent nathan the prophet the same prophet that cursed the seventh son and called for the destruction of the seventh son is the same one that's giving the name to the eighth son and saying beloved of jehovah the same one that condemns the seventh age and condemns the pentecostal age is the same one who points amen amen to the bride and says this is his beloved amen so the same prophet comes along and says his name is jedediah and the lord sends him to call his name jedediah which means beloved of jehovah hallelujah and what's important to the story to me what what makes the biggest impact is when you know who solomon is solomon is not another son it's not like oh yeah god was good to me had another son no this is solomon this is not another of of many sons that are named that you'll never remember their name this is solomon amen solomon's the one who's going to come to the throne solomon's the one who's going to build the temple solomon's the one who's going to further establish the kingdom and bring israel to their golden age to their type of a millennium when they have peace all around the enemies are paying tribute to them they're the most respected nation in all the world amen they've got a ruler who has the greatest wisdom of any man who's ever been alive perfectly portraying jesus christ that's who was born when when the seventh one dies on the seventh day hallelujah you know what we need to take david's approach while he was living we tried we prayed we fasted but when it's dead i can't bring it back we can't bring back that pentecostal revival we can't bring back the pentecostal age so we'll go to them absolutely we'll go to them they can't come to us now let's turn our attention to the eighth son hallelujah brother branham says in the queen of queen of the south god raised solomon up as a type of christ son of david and gave him a gift solomon had many titles he was the son of son of david he was also the son of god god said he'll be my he'll be my son and i'll be his father son of david son of god the prince of peace his name is peace perfect type of christ scriptural sign of the time in 1964 he says god gave solomon a gift and all the whole church everybody believed it that was a millennium for the jews that was the old testament millennium in the days of solomon a foreshadow of the millennium to come the golden age of the jews he says in proving his word 1964 we think of him of this solomon in the great millennium of the jews that when no nation dared to touch them and that great gift of god was in the prophet till he made known to the queen all her secrets of her heart nothing was withheld the great age showing and typing that there was a great age coming hallelujah so we know solomon is critical now i want to look at another picture here of solomon and then i want to jump back to this there's some strange wording when you get into the bible concerning the sons that were born in jerusalem so let's look at this if we could go to this in second samuel chapter five verse 13. says verse 13 and david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem after he was come from hebron and they were yet sons and daughters born to david and these be the names of those that were born unto him in jerusalem shamu and shobab and nathan and solomon evil were also an elishua in nephi and jafia and alishama and the liada and elephalete so these are the names but it's interesting that that solomon is named number four now the bible doesn't say he's number four when he goes to number the first six he said the first one was the second one was here he's just naming them but he shows up in the fourth spot so let's go over to first chronicles chapter 3 and look at this again see first thing you have to do is you have to say the bible makes no mistakes rule number one the bible makes no mistakes first chronicles chapter three verse one first chronicles 3 and 1. now these were the sons of david which were born unto him in hebron the firstborn now watch how specific this is the firstborn amnon of ahinoam and the jezreelite is the second daniel of abigail the carmelitis the third absalom the son of maecha and the daughter of taume tamaya king of gisher goes all the way through the fifth the sixth verse four these six were born unto him in hebron and there he reigned seven years in six months in jerusalem he reigned 30 in three years and these were born unto him in jerusalem shamia and shobhab and nathan in solomon 4 of bathsheba the daughter of amiel so now you look you look here in the first six we name them in order number one number two number three number four number five number six then he goes to jerusalem and he says now here's the sons that were born in jerusalem and we name four and he says the four of bathsheba so all four of these sons come from bathsheba but solomon's listed fourth and the question is that solomon iv born ain't no way in the world because because he went in under her when she was married to the hittite that baby was born when her husband was killed he took her to wife the baby was born nathan comes and says the baby's born it dies when the baby dies he goes in to comfort his wife when the baby dies and conceives and brings forth solomon amen solomon is the eighth born son solomon is the second son of bathsheba the first one that was legitimate so why why does the bible do this because it goes through and it lists more sons but these are not in order of birth order these are just sons they just listed the other in in verse 3 after he listens to the four of bathsheba and verse six lists nine other and it says verse eight and elisha these were all the sons of david beside the son of concubines and tamar their sister so it doesn't even name the sons of his concubines so these are the sons that were born so he gets to jerusalem and he quits putting them in order he just says these four are of bathsheba the rest of these are another nine that was born doesn't even mention their mothers so there's something that's interesting laying here every time the bible does this it fascinates me it's like it doesn't say he's the fourth and nowhere says he's the fourth born of bathsheba it's evident that he's the second born the first legitimate son that's born solomon so why forth well let's go back to the seals why would solomon be listed forth in the seals because he's revealed under the fourth seal as the eagle anointing to combat the antichrist because under four stages the antichrist under four horse riders the antichrist comes amen to be incarnate and a pope amen to take authority upon the earth and then he is destroyed the earth is destroyed and then the solomon type christ comes to set up his kingdom to destroy the fourth stage of the antichrist amen threw four anointings through four stages in the church ages so he's listen to his fourth because four is the number of deliverance four is the number of judah i mean all through it's like why does he so specific specific and then there's a total change in language when he gets to jerusalem and now we're not even saying who was first and who was second now we're just saying this fourth and now he's listed fourth but he's not the fourth because he's the deliverer that's why because he's the type of christ because we know through the church ages that there's four stages back to the seed again what does that seed do that's the seed that's going to sit on david's throne hallelujah i want to look at first kings first kings chapter one let's go to chapter one this is where you get into bible study and this is what i love when you start to see god put all the puzzle pieces down and all sudden click click click click click it starts to fall into place first kings one and five well certain first kings one verse one now king david was old and stricken in years and they covered him with clothes but he had no heat so david is getting old he's coming to the point of dying he's almost to death and now there's time for a change in dispensation so in verse five if we skip down to verse five then adenija the son of haggath exalted himself saying i will be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him and his father had not displeased him at any time and saying why hast thou done so and he also was a very goodly man and his mother bare him after absalom and he conferred with joab the son of zariah and with abe athar the priest and they followed adonijah helping him but zodak the priest and bania the son of jehoiadan nathan the prophet and shemia and riya and the mighty men which belonged to david were not with adonisia and adonai just slew sheep and oxen in fat cattle by the stone of zoheleth which is by enrogl and called all his brethren the king's sons and all the men of judah the king's servants so now as david's diminishing he's very old and they're covering him with clothes he can no longer get heat he's at the point of dying amen now adonai just steps in and and it says he exalted himself now right there is a huge clue this lets you know this is antichrist this is the nature of lucifer who exalted himself amen so adonijah exalted himself his father never put him in that position he was never exalted by somebody else but he exalted himself now if you go back and read where we just read in in second samuel and chronicles you'll find out adonijah is the fourth son of david born in hebron what's important about that because the antichrist takes the throne in the fourth stage on the pale horse not the first first amnon amen he he he raped his sister amen and and absalom killed him then absalom was killed by joab we don't know what happened to the second son he's never mentioned again only we know that it comes from abigail and he was named like his father but then you don't hear anything else amen but then we come to the fourth born son adenisia and adenija the antichrist exalts himself how do we know these antichrists he's trying to take the throne before solomon can get there and the antichrist is trying to take the throne of satan's eden before christ can get there but he's going to be destroyed and solomon's coming to the throne and that's what this whole story tells us that he's going to be destroyed in solomon's coming to the throne so now it's it's the battle of the force now it's the fourth son of david the fourth stage of the antichrist spirit amen the antichrist now the fourth son mentioned solomon is going to come and there's going to be a combat a showdown and solomon's going to win the throne and adonis is going to lose it see the seals tell us all these quirky things in the bible are there laying there because brother branham is the one who unlocked and through him christ unlocked through that ministry the entire bible now we go to chapter 1 verse 15. nathan the prophet now comes the bathsheba this is the interesting part to me adam nice has exalted himself he's taken the throne and it says he was a very goodly man and and his mother's name means festive and he's taking it by deceit now he's coming in and he's slaying oxen and he's fighting everybody and he's feeding everybody it's a great big party everything's going to be wonderful here comes a man of peace i'm going to bless you but solomon is a man of judgment that's going to rid the church of all the spirits but adonis is a very goodly man he exalts himself amen and he begins to have a big feast and they're going to party and everything's going to be fine join with me i'll feed you i'll bless you everything's going to be okay under the beast system we're going to unite and it's all going to be fine under the beast system hallelujah solomon is sitting there quietly solomon's there he wasn't invited to the feast but solomon was there and solomon's an adult at this point and solomon's sitting there and he doesn't say anything but nathan the prophet comes to bathsheba now we come back to the prophet and the bride again and the prophet comes to bathsheba and says don't you have a promise from the king don't you have a promise that solomon's going to sit on his throne the prophet comes to remind bathsheba of her promise bathsheba no doubt had heard what elijah had done no doubt it was the talk of the kingdom and she may not have known what to do about it what can i do i don't know what to do but nathan the prophet comes along to remind her the the king has given you a promise and promised the thing that you bore forth is the thing that's going to sit on the throne amen and so now he tells her you go to the king and i'll go to the king we'll both approach to the king so now she comes in verse 15 and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the king was very old and abide shagged ministered unto the king and bathsheba bowed and did obey essence unto the king and the king said what what is thou and she said unto him my lord thou swearest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid now this wasn't just a trivial promise he said thou swearest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid he had thus saith the lord this was not just david just saying something just you know a sweet little love something i'm going to do something special for you i i want to buy you a dress no this was thus saith the lord kind of promise saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne and now behold adam niger reigneth and now my lord the king thou knowest it not and he has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and a b eighth are the priest and job the captain of the host but solomon thy servant hath he not called and thou my lord o king the eyes of all israel are upon thee that thou should just tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord and king after him so now it's a silent period the king's not saying anything it's kind of tossed in the air who's going to end up ruling this world amen and and it looks like it's going to adenija all indications point is going to adonisia but there's one problem adenija has and then that is that a prophet is going to remind the bride of the king that she has a promise and she's going to go to the king with thus saith the lord you told me thus saith the lord this antichrist is not going to rule amen there's going to be a ruler amen it's going to be christ hallelujah who's had a nicest problem adonis problem's not solomon because solomon is not doing anything the problem is bathsheba because bathsheba is crying out to the king bathsheba is reminding the king bathsheba's got thus saith the lord hallelujah we're the biggest problem the antichrist has that's why he can't run amen he can't run in his full kingdom until this bride is gone he can't have his full way until this bride is gone amen she's holding the thing back right now then we we see nathan comes in he tells the king the same thing we go down to verse 28. then king david answered and said call me bathsheba and she came into the king's presence and stood before the king and the king swear and said as the lord liveth that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress even as i swear unto thee by the lord god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so will i certainly do this day then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and did reverence to the king and said let my lord the king david live forever the king's going to keep his word now i want to rewind a little bit because there's something more amazing than all of this if we rewind a little bit and we go to when david now the the kingdom unites after his seven years and six months in hebron there's a unification of the kingdom now he moves to jerusalem and he sets up the kingdom in jerusalem and then he has a desire and in his desire he desires to build a house for the lord this is before bathsheba and solomon this is before the incident with bathsheba this is after he comes out of hebrew and established the kingdom in jerusalem wants to build a house for the lord and there's some interesting things that the lord tells him so let's look at this in second samuel chapter seven second samuel chapter seven verse one and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies that the king said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of the hou the ark of god dwelleth within curtains and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart for the lord is with thee so nathan said that's a great idea you go do it but then the lord tells nathan and stops nathan and sends him back and tells him not to but listen to what he says in verse 12 and when thy days be fulfilled he's speaking to david now when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom he shall build a house for my name and i will establish the throne of his kingdom forever and i will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with stripes of the children of men but my mercy shall not depart away from him as i took it from saul when i put away whom i put away before thee and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee thy throne shall be established forever according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david so he tells david after you depart i'm going to rise up a seed in your stead to sit on your throne and he will build me a house. so there's the prophecy but when david repeats this same prophecy to solomon his son let's read how david repeats the prophecy in first chronicles 22. turn over to first chronicles 22. this is what made me really happy first chronicles 22-6 but he called for solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the lord god of israel now he's already told him he's going to be king he's going to annoy him to be king and god had already told him through nathan the prophet the seed that comes up after you shall sit on your throne and he shall build me a house so he begins to tell this same story to solomon verse 7 and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the lord my god but the word of the lord came to me saying thou has shed blood abundantly and has made great wars thou shall not build a house unto my name because thou has shed much blood upon the earth in my sight behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be solomon amen this is a prophecy before he ever commits adultery with bathsheba he's saying you'll have a son and his name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days he shall build a house for my name and he shall be my son and i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever before david committed adultery with bathsheba was a prophecy went out you can't build my house but there'll be a seed raised up after me and david tells him the lord to him and his name shall be solomon years later david's walking on his wall and he sees a beautiful woman named bathsheba and he inquires and finds out she's married to the hittite but in his lust he takes her anyways he takes her and lies with her and she conceives and then he tries to hide it and he lies and he does all kinds of horrible things and commits murder then he takes her to mary but the product of that union dies the seventh son on the seventh day dies but he's already married to her and now he goes in unto her to comfort her at the death of this child and now the baby's born and david names this baby solomon right then you knew who was going to be the king right then you knew who was going to bring peace to israel right then he's already born but how did he come he come by bathsheba how could david name this baby solomon how could he possibly after the adultery after the lies after the murders after all the wrong this baby now comes this baby should have been anything but the fulfillment of that prophecy it shouldn't have been through her it shouldn't have been this way it shouldn't have come this way and you shouldn't be here and it shouldn't be you and it shouldn't have come this way and it shouldn't have been through this disaster in this trial and if i was a seed of god why didn't he keep me from this and why didn't he keep me from that if i was predestinated to bring forth christ why did he let me fall into that temptation and fall into that temptation and fall into this ruin because when the baby was born he called him solomon david saying you're the fulfillment of the promise that god gave to me you will build the temple you will build nobody else could believe it nobody else could believe that through this this is going to be the way solomon comes but this is the fulfillment of the prophecy that's why nobody can accept it today because we're a modern bathsheba and nobody says it can't be her it is her it can't be this way it is this way it can't be this time it is this time it's this time this way these people and you're it and he's already got thus saith the lord he's already named it he's already said i'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand and why in an invisible union was a bride united to christ because david was given a wife to reproduce himself and christ has been given a bride to do the same what's coming forth from this bathsheba solomon this whole ordeal with adam knight is just taking place and david has already named the child solomon and bathsheba says you promised me of the lord that solomon was going to be king in your stead well of course he did he named him solomon he knew he was the fulfillment of the prophecy knew it knew it before he grew up knew it before anything day one he's birthed takes the breath of life says you're it solomon now there's the waiting period for solomon to grow up and to come to his position so he can take his throne but the prophecy has been with him from day one his name is solomon day one where is christ conceived in this invisible union day one how can it be you you used to believe in trinitarian doctrine bathsheba used to be married to the hittite how can it be you amen you've done all kinds of sins hey how could it be rahab to bring forth boaz amen she was the harlot how could it be go back and read the bible it can be me and it can be now and it can be because it was recorded on the lam's book of life before the foundation of the world when the lamb was already slayed for every sin that i would commit thousands of years before i would commit it because god's plan is coming through and it will will not be stopped solomon was coming and solomon was coming through bathsheba no doubt in all of and all of the wives of david he could have found one that hadn't sinned or at least hadn't commit adultery i'm sure david could have had a wife that had an impeccable record that had a perfect score she could have been beautiful she could have been perfect she could have had a voice like a dove i mean she could have she could have been raised in the finest home he had wives he had concubines he had other sources that solomon could have come from but solomon wasn't going to come from any of those sources solomon was going to come from bathsheba he said why did god let it happen this way why was there adultery and why was there murder i can't explain to you why any of it but why are you sitting here today why do you believe why have you been impregnated by the word amen when when you've lived the line of life you've lived i've lived the kind of life i live i can't explain it to you i don't understand it all i know is it's written there and i believe it and bathsheba was the one she was predestinated to be there and the moment that baby was born david knew it and david said you're solomon and now when everything goes quiet he names him solomon tells bathsheba he's going to come on the throne i tell you in the name of the lord everything goes quiet and the kingdom of david david gets weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker until he's almost gone and as he gets weaker adenizer starts strengthening himself and the antichrist gets stronger and stronger and stronger until he exalts himself thinking he's going to take the throne but bathsheba's got a promise and she's got a prophet to remind her of her promise she goes to the king and says king you're not going to let this stand because you made me a promise brother madam says in jehovah jireh now there has been two covenants one of them has one of them was the adam covenant god made a covenant with the man if you will i will and he broke it then god made a covenant with noah that was the noah covenant and it was broke now he's making the abrahamic covenant in the abrahamic covenant according to genesis the 12th chapter it was given unconditionally what covenant do you want to be in abrahamic covenant therefore it's eternal because it's unconditional not if you will i will he said i have i've already done it not i will not i will do it i have done it that's all that that's the basis of faith god is determined to save man who's determined to save who god's determined to save man are you determined to be saved no god's determined to save you if you feel any inclination to him at all it's the father drawing praise god man can't keep his covenant so god saves man by his grace under a covenant that's unconditional unconditional covenant oh my never ending that was all of it three perfect noah abraham i mean adam noah and abraham now that's the reason we are abraham's children that covenant cannot end never end because it's unconditionally it isn't because you do something it's because god did something not because you chose god god chose you do you believe that that's the only way i can believe it because if i have to believe it based off something i've done then something and then something else that i do can take me out of it but this is a covenant that's not based on anything i do it's based on what he has already done and now he's coming the end time to open up those seven mysterious thunders to show us what he's done and who he's done it for and how he's done it and you realize amen if it wasn't for god and if it wasn't for predestination there wouldn't be anybody saved it's not our determination to be right with god it's god's determination to have a seed it's not our determination to believe the message it's not our determination to live holy it's god's determination to express his word it's not what we did that's why the conditional covenant adam failed the conditional covenant and noah failed every conditional covenant failed he had a conditional covenant for the people to keep the land amen but they failed on their end they left the land every time there was a can there was a covenant based on condition man fell so god would make a covenant that's based on no conditions so that his plan will never be thwarted you can't stop it you can try the devil can try pull you into a trap get you into a horrible situation you commit sins that you'll regret the rest of your life you know we read these stories in the bible right and then we read them and we skip through them but can you imagine the guilt that david carried the regrets that he had for the rest of his life uriah wasn't a bad guy he wasn't an enemy king it wasn't an enemy kingdom this was somebody who was fighting for him a warrior in his army a notable man a man who who he wasn't even israelite he was a hittite but he had so adopted their ways that he that he says the ark of the covenant and my lord job is in battle i mean he has so embraced this being an outsider grafted in that he's giving his whole life to it can you imagine how david felt when he were to reflect on years of what he's done how he's done it can you imagine how bathsheba felt when she would think about how kind yarai had always been to her and he never done anything wrong to her and how could she do that and through all the guilt and through all the regrets and through it all solomon's coming on the throne do you think god can work through all your tragedies all your sins and all your failures all your backslidings and all those things that you regret so much in life do you think it can stop what was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world god's going to bring solomon he already prophesied is going to be a solomon his name's going to be solomon and when he's born it says david called him solomon and the lord loved him now what did solomon do to get the lord to love him he was just born all he was he's born he born he breathed ah i love him he didn't do anything to earn that love [Applause] he didn't accomplish one task he hadn't already built the temple he had not already taken the throne the fact that he was born and david says you're solomon the lord says i love him that's the one and i'm going to send the prophet to go and reinforce my love for him so that if he missed it the first time the prophet is going to come and back it up and call him jedediah whom beloved of jehovah we should have no doubts friends about his love for us about the predestinated plan of god amen you can say but i make so many mistakes so what repent and say god take over my life i don't want to make these mistakes i need your spirit to run this life because my human spirit won't work my mind won't work my willpower won't work i need to be possessed of the spirit of god to live the right kind of life amen not i'll get right you'll never get right in a million years you won't get right amen let him make you right by his own life inside of you [Applause] improving his word 1964 the prophet of god says now i want you to notice he does it the way that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers and in order to have believers to meet the word he has got to predestinate it to that age i'm going to read that again because that will blow your mind if you catch it right listen what he says in order to have believers to meet the word because if he's going to bring his word he's got to have somebody there to believe it right so it does god no good to speak his word to have nobody there to believe it why would he bring a new word in an age if nobody would believe it why would he bring noah's message if somebody wasn't going to build the ark why would he read moses message if somebody wasn't going to leave egypt there was going to be believers and he knew there was going to be believers amen so he sent his word so in order to have believers in every word he predestinated them to be there if he didn't predestinate for there be the believers there there would be nobody to believe the word of god you don't believe the word of god with your mind you don't believe the word of god with your outer man i mean there's only one thing that's truly believing this word and that is the seed of god down in the soul is the only thing believing the word and if god hadn't put it there before the foundation of the world there's no way that you could accept this message you may get somebody who painted in such a picture that it looks appetizing and appealing to you and you'll agree with it and go along with it and see enough scriptures but somewhere along the line you're going to hit something that won't register intellectually it'll short socket it'll blow a fuse and you'll walk away because the believer is on the inside in order to have believers to meet the word he's got to predestinate it to that age do you believe do you believe bathsheba was ordained to bring forth solomon you bring david was ordained to bring forth solomon you realize friends if he hadn't ordained them if he had not predestinated them and wrote their names on the land's book of life with a lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world there's no way they could have brought forth solomon that's why the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world that's why the names are wrote there because everybody would fall into such ruin god would have to cast us away he would have to he'd be forced to cast us away unless he already wrote a name in the book already sealed it and already we had a lamb slain before the foundation of the world or his plan could have never come forth and you think you're going to be lost you think you're going to fall away you're afraid that i'll fall away and not be reading there's nothing to be afraid of you didn't come on your own and if you came on your own you might as well leave because at some point you're going to leave anyways because the only ones that can come are the ones the father has drawn what's doing the drawing what's he drawing the word is drawing what the word is drawing the word where is the word in the soul in the seed there's the word the word is drawing the word amen so the word goes forth to do the drawing but it can only draw where the word is the word connects to the word the life connects to the life the spirit connects to the spirit there's no word there no life there no spirit there there's nothing to draw hallelujah i just love it i'm gonna read this sentence again i would just read it ten times and keep preaching in order to have believers to meet the word he's got to predestinate it to that age to that age in order to have believers to meet the word because he's going to send the word so there's going to be a believer to meet the word so what happened to you i met the word i'm a believer who met the word how he predestinated it to be in that age that means solomon was born at the precise time to the precise parent in the precise way he came how can it be it is quit asking how it can be it is [Music] how can it be that this little kentucky hillbilly with a seventh grade education can be the great prophet that's been prophesied of all time and come at the end of the age the great gentile how can it be with no education with no system backing with no formal how can it be it is quit asking how it can be it is how can it be this group of misfit people that's gathered amen around this word amen and they've come from this and they've come from that and they've been through this and they've been through that amen we all have rap sheets and if we all got them out we'd all be equally embarrassed how can it be it is how can it be me stop asking that question that's a foolish question that shiva could ask how why why me why is that i bore solomon who cares why you bore solomon how can i be the bride i don't care how i don't care why i don't care what mechanism god used amen all i care is that i am that's the greatest revelation to me that i am why am i because he's going to have a word in this age and then in order to have a believer to meet this word he had to predestinate now i want to change this a little bit amen in order to have a believer to meet the word he had to predestinate it to eat each age that's fine to say that's fun but in order to have believers to meet his word he had to predestinate me to be here today that brings a total different level to the revelation it's not that he had to predestinate believers that's fine if you don't know that you're one of those believers that quote don't mean a thing to you yes he in order to have believers to meet the word he had to predestinate change that makes sense that's work god's right in order to do it he's got to predestinate i see that but if you can't put yourself in that quote and say he's speaking about me personally then this message hasn't come alive to you yet then it's not for you yet amen something has to quicken to where you can say when he speaks that quote he's talking about me that's me right there god had to predestinate me to be here in this age and why would he why would he choose me he didn't choose me based off my conduct whenever we asked that question why would he choose me we started saying but i committed adultery but i was a thief amen but i was a drug addict but i did this and i did that amen he chose you before the foundation of the world amen and he didn't choose you he wasn't choosing your flesh body with all that he was choosing himself that portion of the seed that would fall into your flesh body in this day and he even ordained that flesh body we understand that he saw after your grandparents to get you the way you are we know that but we misconstrue the whole deal with predestination you say well my flesh to this my flesh is your flesh doesn't want come predestinated to see this it come into your body and that's the real you and when you place yourself in this scripture you're not placing the man in the mirror you're placing the genuine you the portion of the word that's expressed and meet the word in this day you say that's me bathsheba was predestinated adultery couldn't erase it david was predestinated before solomon murder couldn't erase it oh my goodness god is bringing a faith higher in the bride where she has confidence and then she gets to the point where she says that's me i'm not apologizing it's me it's me i'm not qualifying it it's me it's me i'm not trying to explain to you why it's me but i know i'm part of the bride of jesus christ amen christ is being manifest in this earth through this body right here amen and and if you want to meet him come here and i'll express him to you i'll explain him to you i'll share with you what's inside of me and i'm not apologizing for it because i believe it amen and i'm not hiding it under a bushel basket because i believe it's the truth i'm not going to say everybody's okay they all have their own way and there's all these other paths i don't believe it that way i believe he's expressing himself in his bride i believe she's bringing forth christ she's conceived amen she's taken an invisible union she's taken a conception and now she's bringing forth christ in order to have believers to meet the word he had to predestinate to be there in that age why are you here because of that quote right there but what about the past forget about the past what about this quote amen he's got to predestinate these things to be here listen you see he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age did it get you did you feel it did you see it amen i love that did you see it do you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinated to this by his foreknowledge when he predestinated in malachi 4 it's got to happen when he came over and predestinates anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so when he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time that's me who wants to raise your hands and say that's me right here he preached that they need to be there he predestined to be a bride and a capstone ministry amen to bring forth the evidence that christ is on earth again it's here i'm it i'm part of that seed manifesting amen the word for this day hallelujah if he pre-doesn't anything to happen he says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride she's going to be there going to be a rapture she's going to be there he predestinates by his foreign seat there's nothing going to stop it hallelujah don't you worry about any atonizer move don't you worry oh my goodness sometimes i get so discouraged at people who send me links to conspiracy theories thinking they're going to understand the government's moving this way and they've got these fema camps and this is going to happen i'm not worried about what elijah's doing i've got a promise [Applause] i i'm not worried about what elijah's going to do and how he's going to exalt himself and how he's going to have 50 horses and 50 men and that represents this and that i don't care i don't plan to be here amen when the pope is incarnate i don't plan to be here for the tribulation i plan to be sailing off into another dimension amen feasting in the wedding supper of the lamb i don't need to know the conspiracy and how they're working it all out and how it's going to happen and how they're going to change the laws and it's going to fall i don't care i've already got a promise i've already conceived what i've conceived has already been named that baby's christ that's the one that's going to take the throne that's the one that's going to take the throne can i show you something in the scriptures before we go let's go to first kings i wasn't going to do this but let's do it there's some things in here that i don't fully understand i'm not going to try to explain them all because i don't understand them but there's something else in here that i find to be very very strange okay i'm not going to explain all this because i don't know it so don't ask me i'll get a million questions and texts saying what did that mean i don't know i'm just telling you all i know but after solomon takes the throne his father gives it to him david dies adonaija tries to get to by shag the virgin that used to lay with david to keep him warm and he in adonijah comes to bathsheba and says will you ask solomon that i can have a buy shag to be my wife i'm not going to try to explain all that because i don't understand it all but there's something that happens when bathsheba comes to solomon and let's read this verse 18 it's first kings chapter 2. sorry first kings chapter 2 verse 18. first kings chapter 2 verse 18 and bathsheba said well i will speak for thee and to the king. verse 19 bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon to speak unto him for adonijah and the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself under her and sat down on his throne and caused the seat to be set for the king's mother and she sat on his right hand you mean the thing that we bring forth christ brought forth from the bride is going to sit on the throne and then we're going to sit next to him that's exactly what's going to happen friends why is that written like that i don't know what i was having to see i don't know but as soon as bathsheba comes he rises and bows to bathsheba and he brings a chair up and causes her to be set on his throne on his right hand praise be to god all i can say is that's me too that's my position i don't know how it's going to work out i don't know what all means but that's me too praise be to god let's all stand oh this word is so rich to me friends it gets richer every single day brother brennan's coming along and preaching the seals and he says now i can only hit the high parts just enough so you'll know what it is he says i could take each one of the seals and go around and around a clock on that he said i could preach a month of services and still never touch it i'll be honest with you i heard him say that and be like really i mean like a month of services i say praise god he was right you just comb through the bible and it's there and it's there and it's there and it's there and it's there and brother brenham told us and christ is mystery of god revealed it's been in every type and every character has been portraying it all down through the bible this entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ and i say amen praise be to god let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord we praise your name lord and thank you for all that you're doing in this hour now sometimes it's more than our human side can comprehend our mind can be confused our our spirit can just not understand but we're so thankful we're not relying on those things lord there's something so much deeper that goes back so much further than our life here on this earth and that part is saying amen that's nothing but the truth and more than that it's not just saying amen it's nothing but the truth but lord that you deposited in us is saying that's me this is my time this is my scripture this is my quote and i'm going to live it in jesus christ's name all we thank you for what you're doing in this hour we pray god that you would keep us keep us close to you lord help us not to stray away in our wonderings and our failings but help us to repent and give you preeminence and stay close to you lord that you might have your way in us we might bring forth that which we're called to bring forth in this hour god we just pray that you would just continue to unlock your word let us see you lord not scripture verses let's see you lord and lord you in turn will turn around and identify us in the mirror of the word and we see lord that you've called us to this hour you've predestinated to be here to meet this word in this hour and god somehow we know it's the
