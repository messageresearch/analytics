========================================

that's why ahab threw macaya into the inner chamber and to the south because macaya by speaking the truth amen he become a threat to the false union of ahab and jehoshaphat and all he did was tell them the truth and they asked him to they called him they asked him and he tried to let him off the hook he said go up go on up he knew they wouldn't receive it he said you just go on and he said haven't i told you before just tell me what the lord says he told him exactly what the lord said ahab knew that was the word of the lord but because it threatened this new false unity that became between jehoshaphat and ahab he threw him into the inner chamber why because the truth was a threat to the religious system you see why the devil once the devil would want people who are associated with this message to take the message and make it a religion because if they do they'll be willing to protect their religion because the religion becomes the security and they will be willing to compromise amen they will be willing amen to give in to keep what is my security but if your security comes from your personal relationship with jesus christ and your identification by this word it doesn't matter what they do to the church it doesn't matter if they scatter us as believers it doesn't matter they throw me in the inner hall they cannot separate me from the love of god that is in christ jesus because it's been revealed to me personally shut the doors to the church will not stop anything amen but the devil would like to take religion and have us have a false security so that we have a need to protect our false security amen if you're security in christ and nobody believes what you're saying it's okay nobody believed mikaya he was fine with that nobody believed jeremiah he was fine with that nobody believed isaiah he was fine with that because their security did not come from the system their security came from god himself that's why religion is a barrier to god amen it doesn't bring you to god it's not the upholder of truth it's the protector of unbelievers it's the sheltering amen of the unbelievers
