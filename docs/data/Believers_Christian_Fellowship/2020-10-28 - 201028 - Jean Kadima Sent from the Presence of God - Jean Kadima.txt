asking you your presence and your word to be preached father i just come to you this moment knowing that we have come with anticipation waiting upon you as those who wait upon the lotion renew their strength this shall mount up with wings wings like ninigo we need that mounting power tonight father so we are inviting you now in our midst because man's word will fail we need you to talk to your children they were waiting upon you they came with anticipation to hear from you not from me god it's not about me it's about you now have preeminence come down in your power of resurrection tonight and speak to us in the name of the lord jesus christ we prayed amen amen as we are standing oh thank you musician brother john thank you we're going to go straight to the word of god i do have the projector displaying so i'm gonna share some of my notes with you okay and i know you're gonna read fast fast okay it's okay but wait for me we know um do you have it now no luke chapter 1 verse 18 are we ready for the word tonight oh i heard the announcement the couple is back here god bless you brother blake and sister emily and i heard that uh we have one hour we're gonna gain sleeping so if you forget it's okay because you can come to church one hour earlier you can pray for us it's okay so let's just read uh luke chapter 1 verse 18 and zechariah said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife was stricken in ears and the angel answering said unto him i'm gabrielle that stand in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee this glad tidings and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that this thing shall be performed because thou believes not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season may god add his blessing to the reading of the word you may take your seats so as i say i'm sharing you my not a few notes with you um so i was looking at this scripture and i know is this scripture that we heard about recently zacarius represent the system of churches the denominations the word of his time came through an angel and he looked at it and look uh and thought about it and his intellectual could not grasp this and because of that the angels say because you did not believe you become dumb but instead we heard that it was actually his wife the woman that now went to prophesy and it sounds like the time we are living right now where the system cannot comprehend cannot accept the word now is the time for the bride to go and prophesy again so but i was looking at a different uh you know some words on it and uh looking at angel stand in the presence of god and sand to speak and and my i came with this message this the title um sent from the presence of god strange title right brother branham had strange titles for example you will say from this time on and he will preach on it kind of putting prepositions and you know together and come up with a message you will think that a person who speak french will come up with a title like that because it's like fascinating how english can be so poor and rich at the same time you know you think from this time on in french you cannot say that i'm pretty sure in other language you cannot say that because you know you're just taking proposition and everybody understands meaning that before there was something then that thing stopped and then from that time and forever something else started you can't say that in french so brother brenham was as fascinated as us french speakers when he saw that wow what is this it starts preaching about it so because of that then i can also do this sent from the presence of god and what that means you know what that means sent from the presence of god this angel was sent from the presence of god does it mean uh it came from a certain location in heaven that heaven has like uh you know town cities and he's coming from a physical location i look at it and i found i got more from this so and i'm going to go on a limb here i'm going to take some liberty and it's that's why it's good to preach to a church that is mature they can allow you to take some liberty and keep going they have a filter they can filter and understand things what is sent from the presence of god what does that mean so and i had some few answers here you can bear with me does it mean access to god so because you have access to god you are sent by god commission to do something all this seems to be right yes i have access to god i'm send by him all right i'm commissioned to do what i'm supposed to do i have a mandate it has a vest is power in me i have a permission if because you doubt what i say i have the authorization the permission i am vested with power to make you dumb that's that's true but i found that that is not sufficient it's true that he has access to god is sent by god he is commissioned he has a mandate that's true but that's not all so then i go to let's go to second chronicles and look at it ii chronicle 18 18 it says again he said therefore hear the word of the lord this is a makaya we know this scripture very well because brother brahm talks a lot about it is makaya speaking to the king of israel and king of judah is uh telling them what he saw in a vision that if they go to war they're going to lose and he say again verse 18 again he say therefore hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting upon his throne and all the hosts of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left the lord said who shall i entice we shall entice ahab king of israel that he may go up and fall at ramos gilead and and one speaks saying after this manner and another saying after that manner let's just notice that in a heaven in certain dimension which i don't know god had angels around him somewhere on his right hand others were in his left hand right and we realized that some of them were demons spirits are you with me and god say i want ahab to go and die because that's what my prophet said and i want to fulfill that word but who can entice him to go and get killed demons came what the bible says some of the angel was on the right hand i hope the good angels were because the right hand means the power of god so there were others on the left some came and everyone starts speaking lord send me i will do this and god says it won't work and another one came and said send me and god say no it won't work and the third one came and this is what he says verse 20 then they came out in spirit and stood before the lord and said i will entice him and the lord say unto him wherewith how are you going to do it he said and he said i will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of his prophets and the lord said thou shalt entice him and thou shalt also prevail go out and do even so and now therefore behold the lord had put a lying spirit in the mouth of this prophet and the lord has spoken evil against thee this when this angel evil angel a demon spoke to the lord he say i have a strategy i'm going to be lying spirit in the mouth of this these prophets god say oh you will succeed yeah absolutely they love their denomination spirit if you speak to them they will all go like oh this is true now but i wanted you to notice that this demons this angels were coming from the presence of god is that right and they were sent do we agree and they were mandated they had a mandate they had to do something they were commissioned to do that a mandate is that right yeah look they had access to god and sent by god to do what to do evil work so god can fulfill his purpose so therefore this what makes this angel gabriel great is not just before because he has access to god is sent by god commissioned to do something there must be more than that i can give more example influence 1963. brother branham say i have heard the people say oh satan can't do that yes you just let god lift his hand one time and watch what happens it's i constantly plead god don't send him have mercy on me keep him away from me so god can send satan according to some rules that are over there that we don't know he can send him maybe he will say jean has having too much fun and you have been so good to him can i go let me because that's not fair you know that's not faith and he can let him do that but i have also the right to say god don't send him have mercy on me all of us we have the right to say god don't send me keep me from all evil is that what we pray keep us from evil is that the prayer of the lord we have the right but we see that the devil has also the right to do things but all works together for the good for the good of those who love god christ is revealed in his own word 1965. i was just talking to a young minister and his wife in the room just a few moments ago and both of them have uh nervous just like the rest of the world the rest of the human beings on earth i say remember satan got a punch coming at you you see it takes just more than having the power to be the angel of the lord sent from the presence of god there is something more you see satan gets a punch coming at you don't care i don't care who you are he's got a right for that one punch which had you which had you rather be that the the punch be blind of being arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous see he's got somewhere he can punch you it's got a right to do that open place now that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time to see this nervous age that we are living in we still have it right it can be mended he can access god in some ways because it's so is spiritual things sometimes we try to use human words it doesn't always work but he has some access it can do that but you don't have to take it you can cry out to the lord yes that's what i wrote down actually you got the right to cry out to the lord he has the right to punch you but don't take it cover it all the time you know whatever you do amen i don't know if this is a box or karate or what it's a spiritual battle actually i heard a preacher he came to the pulpit he preached about the battle and it was all karate i never heard such violence on the puppet but it was so great it was amazing revelation chapter 12 verse 10 and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of is christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night oh it has access but it's not the same access it used to have it had reason to accuse us because we did not have the full world is that right so during the ages it could accuse us through luther because we did not have the word the full word it could accuse us through wesley could accuse us through the pentecostal but now the fullness of the world has come who will accuse us of sin who can accuse jesus say who which of you actually read it john 8 which uh john 8 46 which of you convinced me of sin who can say the word who can say the word has failed to do what he promised to do who can condemn the word therefore if you are the word how can satan condemn you how can he go and accuse you amen he can't the only thing he can do is when we make mistakes remember we don't sin sin is unbelief the fullness of the word has come there is no sin on earth there are people that don't have sins and i'm looking at them oh praise god amen religious huh that's what brother burnham say i feel like religious now my my my people that don't have any sin so therefore satan has some sort of access today which i don't know what does he say is just say oh that's not fair you know there's no fear like a young you know some young teenagers that's not fair only my sis only me i have to do the dishes and my sister doesn't do anything that's not fair sorry young young people soon the accuser has nothing he has nothing it has nothing on you all right god send him to kind of sometimes twist our hand you know give us a stimulation of our posteriors when we do something wrong but we can't sing so but we still have access to uh actually ask for is right and but my my uh purpose is to sh was to show you there is more than just having this access you just being said the angel of the lord like gabriel like the angel that came to talk to brother bennett they had something more than that amen but satan is work is to torment to give you hard time to attack your body to attack your mind but he cannot access your soul that's why all its effort his effort is to when he determines you is not really for your body you suffering you crying you don't understand what is going on but the reality is you want to reach your soul so you can you can reject the word of god but how can the word reject the word is a lost battle we we we just won uh a battle just to come you know to come to church another day and sunday i will see you oh my it it has lost the bottle all his effort is to get to your soul but your soul has god it has a seed of god is the word i cannot reach so is he has all these things but it takes more than just that accessing god asking god that's why my friend pentecostals really you miss something because sometimes they just think because we pray because we pray we spend nine days in church we pray you pray and remember satan praise too he goes to god baby asks and that's prayer he was a cherubim he knew adora he knows adoration he knows to worship he doesn't make it great what makes you great is the nature of god amen now the this let me take john chapter 8 verse 44. this is the difference between these the the angels between the people those who come from sent from the presence of god and the other group you see in john 8 4 44 he say ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father he will do he was a murderer from the beginning and about not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it you see jesus said he has no truth but what is the truth john 17 17 sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth that other messenger has no truth has no word the angel the gabriel angel has the word is the word is made of the same material as god if you take a spiritual tools and put on him you will see some god's dna inside actually god is just wrapping himself with that angel amen you agree with me an exposition of the seven church ages uh speaking about the two books genesis and revelation he says satan hates to be exposed and in those books is exposed for exactly what he is jesus said about satan he has no part in me and i have no part in him the other angels have part with god amen god made of the word they ha they are the word they have a portion of god in them but the demons don't have the other children don't have the other seed doesn't have are you with me the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the world but when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spirit of spirit revelation of the world the gates of hell cannot prevail against it amen impossible it cannot prevail against her my my now have you noticed what i put in color there if you can see it he has no part but i'm saying jesus say about satan he has no part in me and i have no part in him if you look at that scripture it does not exist so intellectual believers have a problem so if you find it like tell me come show me in the bible it has no part in me and i have no part in him i could not find it maybe there is you show me after the service yeah so but as our pastor says a prophet can take a word here and a word there put it together change a little bit because it's a revealer of the spoken word is so free the word has a spirit in the holy spirit and the prophet is made to be the one who reveal you what is written i could not find it i went around the search you know these days you can search anything i could not find it but barbara found it in the bible the satan has no path in me and i have no part in him there is no association nothing in common between this two seed the seed of god and the seed of satan is no connect nothing in common and i say well i i just say a must have found it here when peter is saying to jesus john chapter 13 8 that you should not wash my hand my feet or and jesus said if i don't wash you you have no part with me all right peter what are you talking about you know you want to break the harmony of the scriptures you know you are part of me if i don't watch you if the word if you don't allow the word to wash you how can i have part of you is like you making a statement that the word should not wash you and you know well you know better peter all right you have power with me but there is one that does not have power with me john 14 30. hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and had nothing in me that's it nothing means no pot there is no portion of god in him there's nothing in common and that's the difference one can pretend i come from the presence of god but that's not the presence of god we're talking about that's not the presence of god we are concerned of amen those who come from the present the real presence of god god wraps himself inside them that's the difference they have these portions those portions my my my we can give them names we can call them attributes i did not just want to use the word attribute for a change exodus chapter 3 verse 2 and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great site why the bush isn't burned is not burned and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and say moses moses and he say here am i i wanna i highlighted two places there it was and the angel of the lord appeared is that right and then moses went to see what was burning not consuming and verse 4 is no longer the angel of the lord and when the lord was it the angel or it was the lord the mingo at one point we will not know if it was the angel or it was the lord and because the same material a child of god is god to whom the word of god came to are called god look a god walking that's too presumptuous brother kadima you have to be humble that's not me i did not write the word he say that yes amen no what makes this angel great is is an attribute of god it has a portion of god in him what you call faith is a portion of god in you right is made of the same material if you take that x-ray spiritual x-ray you see god bones is the word the god is the word you are the word that's the difference you say brother brother are you talking about the angel no i'm talking about you all this i'm bringing back to you we are the end of the shadows and types it's all about today it's all about now you know i used to tell my children stories sometimes i had to change it in the middle you know because it was so scary you know but the children always want to know the end of the story how did he end and we have come to that point the end of the story oh yeah what did i do there are many people that could see this time i saw it yet the devil is telling me i'm a miserable person he tells you the same thing one devil calls another devil they communicate put mind in you yeah yes it's really tormented yeah he doesn't like this word i hear brother ben i'm saying that i went to the pulpit before i go to the puppet my mind went blank what was it attack because he knows that word that comes he has the power of delivery he will do any anything if he attacks us preachers sometimes we come to help but a child when he's not around what about the pastor himself day in day out preaching this word my mind we need prayer warriors absolutely and thank you those who told me they were praying for me yes absolutely we need that yes we need to pray more you know sometimes you you see brother ben say people were fasting praying that's why my my meetings have success some people are praying and we are in that time there's so much evil spirit that just came because they have the right you know they were on the euphrates river now if they were given the right to come to attack they start with the jewish people but now they come against the bride and the biggest battle is in here you know heads god help us let me continue i in the message moses 50 this time when he come he was a man and that was scary whatever he was talking about his experience when he was in a cabin cabin when he went to pray did not understand the mystery of his life he did not understand what was going on in his life i'm not just talking about brother branham you know do you understand your life i don't right i don't but god came to talk to him through an angel and said um he said do not feel i'm sent from the presence of god amen that's a good one say to tell you that your peculiar birth and the peculiar life has been to indicate that you are uh taking a gift of divine healing to the peoples of the the world don't you think this was an health heavenly angel right it came with a message he was sent from sent from the presence of god to explain the mystery the unusual the peculiar life of brother branham don't you think that the earthly angel because what is an angel a messenger is that right could not brother branham was sent to explain the peculiarity of your life he could say to us i come sent from the presence of god to explain to you why you are this way why you love this word i can even explain to you that your life sometimes can go upside down but i know i see it but you were called to witness something your life has a purpose you are witnessing the end of everything hallelujah amen oh my sorry for me screaming am i the only religious person hallelujah satan doesn't like the screams why is he so happy i i just beat him up punch him that's what brother baby use he use punch maybe he kicks too it's a battle yeah it's a battle and we already won amen can somebody say amen amen we have one amen amen an angel is a messenger the prophet could say to you and he says to you listen to the tapes he said i am sent from the presence of god to tell you your life is so mysterious but it has a purpose amen fear not little flock your father has decided to give you the kingdom fear not i've sent from the presence of god to tell you that hallelujah this is what he say in a thinking men's filter he says any man that's real christian born again today knows since he was a little kid or a little girl either that there was something in you that hungered for god amen and you try joining churches or everything else following you know the crowd you know it could not work no never worked what was it it was a word you was hunting for a filter hallelujah it was something really different from you the angel the heavenly angel came to speak to the uh earthly angel but the air for the angel came to speak to you from the presence of god amen to tell you the mystery of your life you are drawing up something that is an image there is a pattern that you are following you don't understand that but your faith your faith which is a dimension of god a portion of god you can't understand it it can go in the future come back in the past go in the present ah that oil because you're god it's so good wow to be in him to be in christ so good amen it gives you some freedom some peace and the anointing being so great is good to preach and if we cannot preach on the pulpit we can live it god help us and one day it flashed before you you seen jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that satisfied the test the taste see cause life was in you drawing see the life in you is drawing it's telling what desire you got here you're pulling you can't pull through this and that and the other you've got to find that right filter because you are a thinking person see that's what the the angel comes to talk to tell you god is rich in mercy many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you were it was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it would not bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was god somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that and the congregation says amen certainly now what was that that was a little form of life in youth amen amen and then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked up you pick out you picked out this and that picked up this that some of the things you picked up you regret them now right yeah and went from denomination to denomination but one day you being part of god that's the difference part of god you had to be part of the world and when you heard the world you know where you come from you knew you knew what was the truth you know where you come from you know where you are and where you're going back you were always the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it you saw the word and you come to it you had no choice but go back to what you are yes yes so our lives are drawing something drawing up something they draw a pattern there is a pattern some of the things we don't understand them maybe we will not understand them here but we do it's writing there is a writing what we do where we go the steps of righteousness are led by this by god yeah there's nothing that's come by luck there is you are you are here to play a role in satan cannot even access you until you're done oh my and i can see brother branham when he was here he was drawing up something he was writing a symphony his life was a symphony even though he could not understand that music musicians but he was writing the symphony at the end he got a play at the end he has a ministry that brings back jesus christ again the head and the body together that was his ministry and every time he was working he was working toward that purpose something he did not know how he's going to come and a portion of him something inside knew and then when the picture was almost done when the image was about right satan felt that something is about to happen that was in 1962 1963 the purpose of his ministry was about to be fulfilled the image will be now clear you can see him now at that time 1962 all hell broke loose maybe we are living the same thing amen we because we are already in the beginning in the end the in the beginning of the end the ushering in of everything all right you know when the wedding starts you start ushering people in the room is it the wedding yes it's the waiting is not there waiting because the bride is not here yet but it's the waiting because it's already ushered it's already in a process but the image maybe the lord is keeping us because the image is not full yet we have not fulfilled a part yet completely so that's why we eat the food every day and pray and cry out to him now 1962 all had brock lewis a gun exposed on william branham to kill him physically it was too much for the satan to take people start leaving him some say that his ministry was over and the pressure built up pressure built up but his fate could travel between 1962 and 1963 how can you say that yeah yeah yeah but the faith is a portion of god it could he knew something tremendous is coming it could not tell you for sure what how is going to be by the portion of god in him so something is about to happen yeah you know that portion do you know that sometimes brother brenham went to pray for a sick person you get in a house he sees his own body on the roof he sees himself on the roof and looking at his body laying hands on the person where is brother burnham the one laying hands on the sick or the one who's up there looking at his what is he looking at is i will say to you because i'm taking liberty a portion of god god well i a portion of god one of the two are a portion of god one is his body i don't know you come tell me who was laying hands on the sick when is is not there is watching his own body laying hands a porsche god god how can i say attributes yeah let's go with attributes god attributes can do that can do things that human cannot do yeah the gun is supposed people start living 1962 maybe the image you are drawing up is about to to show up to be clear don't you think hall hell can break or lose does he explain why there's so many things among our community a lot of things among the believers a lot of things because at this time brother branham start also put in like foundation seed in 1962 he knew something is about to happen he said listen we need messages message churches get some young people help them teach them send them in missions then you tell the people wait i don't know the man i will just do a disclaimer i don't know him i don't know his family i don't know how his life ended he said joseph bosey you know is a good man but let me tell you jose joseph bosa does not believe the message we need to start message churches joseph bozey he always yo he he gave brother branham to preach many many times is it the history repeating itself that you can have somebody that everybody say is a message believer the message believer and brother but i'm saying it's not it's not a pleasure it's sad but it's reality yeah 1962 this seed is planted the head is coming in 1963. amen start the message churches we need a place where the message is being preached truly preached verbum start talking about these things taking side with jesus but he also after the gun exposed when the gun explodes barbarians start talking about the pressure among the people have you noticed but everyone start talking about even mental sickness and you will think that it happens only outside no it happens among the believers we are not spared because the devil has a punch but we don't have to take it mental sickness if you have noticed um the preachers that came here before me they all spoke about mental condition if you have notice is something that is not sparing anyone but we can't have it covered that's what we read and verb say don't say i don't have a sickness if you have it if you have you are diagnostic you have it but say god is greater than my sickness amen all kind of them some you have to take medicine and it has a side effect depression anxiety this and that bipolar a sister called me few not too long ago my my daughter-in-law has bipala and she's doing this and two days or two three days later her own daughter also has the same insane symptoms a minister told me his wife has she's so friendlier this is not to discourage anyone this is a reality it happens but we don't have to take it amen how can i overcome 1963 and you know that he's a devil you can't say i got a sickness i don't believe it's a sickness oh yes it's a sickness you got cancer you you don't believe is a cancer it's a cancer it's a cancer but remember greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you must realize the holy ghost that is in you has already overcome this thing he is in you and you can overcome by him that exactly sensible it's exactly the way this scripture is written all the time that he that is in you say almost the same thing greater is he that isn't you that the wheelchair greta is he that is in you that that's a stretcher greater is he that is in you that that cancer greater is he that is in you that than that affliction no matter what that affliction is still degraded in the message letting off the pressure it's just to build up pressure it's the age that we are living in in neurotic age where people don't know what to do with where they are going and the doctors don't have the answer for it because the psychiatrist is being doctored by the psychiatrist so they have not the answer strange he say this i'm not talking about the regular doctors i'm talking psychiatrists they don't have the answer and if they don't have the answer that's a good thing because the answer is from the lord brother banham said before i bring my children to the doctor i pray for them then i bring them to the doctor and if the doctor cannot do anything i bring them a little higher but there's some answer surely somewhere we could deal on it for hours please brother branham deal with it for hours this is a very serious subject but i was just thinking that god has the answer if we could just sit in a place like this takes off the pressure with people who are entered into eternity we are not going into we are already in it that's right amen some sickness some of these conditions they happen everywhere they affect families but there is an answer in christ we really need to be prayer warriors that sounds like uh the basic message tonight but it's so true and if you watch closely all these preachers have talked about it talk about it and it was like we talked together no some sickness the doctors don't understand they don't even want to qualify them as sickness borderline personality grandiose narcissist narcissism some are grandiose some are vulnerable we know more about grain grandiose people grandiose narcissists that say i'm this i'm that but they are also the vulnerable they are always a victim victim and the doctors don't know especially this one's narcissism the doctor sometimes the therapist doesn't know because the logic the person who's suffering this is illogical you know it can even charm the therapist you know it can confuse them and some of them say this is not even a sickness because these people don't suffer because we treat people that suffer but yet people around them people around the narcissists people around them suffer because they the environment that they create is toxic imagine a believer that is the family for example where the parents are narcissistic it's awful and it happens maybe it's a time where we expose all demons but i tell you spending time well three more preachers but a kyle preach talk about that brother steve brother nathanael they all talk about it and the pastor talks about it every sunday almost yes but the prophets say that uh we you don't the doctors don't know they say well how can you say a narcissist is sick it feels so good it feels like i'm power you know how can you say is a sickness it's a sickness for those around them and some will leave the word the message and go in the world because my parents are narcissistic they do both lines all that the plagues in the world oh god it will be great that that is not even said among us it will be wonderful that if you a message believe it those things don't happen no they can happen we have to hold the fire we have to pray we have you know to take care of a brother we are brothers keepers so many things happen we need people that pray not with selfishness but truly pray that's right i already pray no no need to pray one day i was walking and i had this message i was listening to it because i was listening to the series of 1962 and there's something in this message be not afraid it is i in 62 there is something or other about mankind and christians when they are assembled together in one accord and in fellowship they have things in common you can tell that they it's hard for them to part one from another and now this may be a little on the sideline now brother when i was about to open my eyes to something on the sideline it's going with the message like this you can see the past preaching you know the subject keep going at one point he deviate what is it he go pick up somebody on the sideline and he's talking to me i'm in the woods i'm walking sometime i can walk seven miles and listen to the message praying and he's talking to me this is the sideline for this person that is in the trail and now you say but many of you people have seen people that you just love to be in their presence and then you have seen people that you they were nice people but you could hardly stand to be in their presence see you are a creator of an atmosphere around you and you make that yourself by your own disposition and the spirit that is on inside of you i got it people that create a toxic environment is because of the spirit inside them but they can say no to it the demon can come but you can say no you have that right that's it and that's the problem because when you hear and you recognize you will act if you deny how can you act and that's the problem that brethren had in oregon i will read it and demonology uh 1953. he said the police say the man who came to beat up brother branham on the pulpit when brother cast out that demon the man fell and they say the police say is that man dead i say no sir say is he healed i say no sir he worships that spirit he'd bring it right back to him because he thinks is right he thinks is a is a protection for him to be strong and billion preachers he feels something and when the spirit went out when he wakes up he pick it up and go but it's our duty to pray for everyone but it's also the responsibility for the person to be willing and we always given that free moral agency it's true but god gave us the power to cast our demons that's very basic but that's true i say he's not here they roll him over i say get him off my feet he was scrambling me he was laying that big man on my feet i couldn't move my feet out of out and both of them together and i couldn't move my feet out and they rolled him over and i i took my feet away and went on to you know so yeah brother branham spoke more about the pressure that comes in people in 1962 pressure come on him on his church rejection all kinds of things and he had to address it the science try science tried to break in god lab and what about you and i made of god's material god is speaking to us it talks about about the body the spirit and the soul all the mysteries are being revealed now and brother bam spoke to us about all these things you know i was listening to him speaking about you know how we are spirits you see people's stop don't move around you we are spirits my spirit what spirit coming from the presence of god which presence of god amen but you and i not just coming from the presence of god but of the same material amen amen now you also can send you can say i'm sent from the presence of god to tell this world that christ is in human beings i'm i sent i'm sent from the presence of god you know to witness deity tabernacling in human beings i'm sent in the presence from the presence of god to witness to play a role in the secret coming of the lord hallelujah you are a mystic being i'm not it's not me making that word i saw brother brennan you think we we are mystic beings we can we can be here we can be there we can be here we can be there we can our god transcends time we can also transcend time we can go in the future

corner stay the course amen amen hallelujah so much to to say ah let me just finish with this luke chapter 7 verse 36 and one of the pharisees desire him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisees house brought an albuster box of ointment verse 38 and stood at his feet behind him whipping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kiss his feet and anointed them with the anoint ointment now when the pharisee which had beaten him so it respect with within himself saying this man if you were a prophet would have known who and what man of a woman this that touch him that she's a sinner oh my well have you noticed jesus was silent during all this time that this woman was doing this service he never said a word brother ben i'm saying you know she was doing the right thing jesus was rejected by the pharisees who invited him we believe the message but he rejected him this woman was with the rejected jesus he was smitten she was smitten remember brother emmanuel message he was rejected she was rejected the system was sitting here and jesus with the woman was on the other side she was rejected she was called bad name he was called that name she was at the right place right time for fulfilling the purpose of her life she could say i come from the presence of god to fulfill the duty that god gave me serving the lord this is the time to serve him in the millennium will not serve him this is the time to do it and as she's doing this he is just watch her hallelujah he's just watching her he remains silent you will say lord say something what should i say you doing the right
