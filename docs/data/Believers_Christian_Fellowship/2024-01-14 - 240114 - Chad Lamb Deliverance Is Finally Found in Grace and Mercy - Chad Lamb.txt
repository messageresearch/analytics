your mercy and Grace that you would draw us that you would provide for us that you've given us so much to be thankful for in this day God I pray that it would never Escape us Lord that it would never become common Lord that we would stop and say thank you God we come together this morning to worship your name and you've promised to abide in the Praises of your people so Lord we know your Prophet says you keep all your appointments and we know you're here according to your word but Lord we don't want you to be here like Simon's invitation when you came but weren't welcome but Lord you've come according to your word may you now find welcome in our hearts Lord may you take preeminence may you be given the chief EST Place Lord the head of the table the upper room we invite you Lord to the

name we pray amen amen God bless you we're going to let you have have your seats for just a moment thank you musicians God bless you all I just want to welcome you to the Arctic blast amen praise the lord it's amazing that the temperature can change 45 to 47 degrees in less than two days amen but I just wanted to take a minute and just I wanted to thank the trustees I was coming in this morning and the parking lot was clear the side walks were saled and I know Brother Dean and Xavier got here early and I think brother Greg was here early and the Jonathan was here and they're they're here to make sure that we can have church they're here to make sure that it's safe getting in and out that we have no problems and I just wanted to thank them for that and I also wanted to say it starts long before snowstorm or an artic blast because you know I I was walking in the sanctuary and it was warm and everything was in order and I was thinking you know it's not just when you have cold weather just when you have snow but these brothers have to foresee this all year they have to make sure we have a plow truck something to salt with all the equipment we need and that we keep the heating system well-maintained because it's always in extreme conditions when things break down so extreme conditions when everything's tested and it's not the extreme conditions that that prove whether you've been doing a good job or not I mean they prove it but it's not that moment it's all that time that they put into making sure things aren't left undone this and disrepair but I want to thank God for our trust these and I just want to give them a round of applause amen amen they go unnoticed because if they're noticed it's usually bad amen so we want them to go unnoticed because they're working behind the scenes but we just want to thank them for that I just have a a couple announcements I want to make a few things I want to bring you up to speed on um I will be going Thursday this Thursday out to Holmes County to start a Bible study they've been asking me to come out there so I I'm just asking you to pray about that I'll be going through the church ages book from cover to cover I'm starting from the beginning and go all the way through and I really like to help them get really established in the word of God in the message of the hour so I'll be going out there starting this Thursday and I'll be going every other Thursday till we get through the church ages book um but Levi sent me pictures their their church is now almost complete they've got heating inside and going to be doing the uh Bible study in the new church that they just built this Thursday amen and uh they're having their first service this afternoon amen at 3 p.m. so we thank God for all who contributed we've got quite a few visitors there's a big group that came from Junction City God bless you all we're are glad to have you and they also were up helping uh Levi and the gang up there work on that place so they've contributed a lot of manh hours into that project as well um but also I decided that I'd like to do the same Bible study here so I'm going to start not this Thursday but next Thursday which will be the 25th of January in the fellowship hall at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday night I'm going to go through the church age book uh all the way through and a series of Bible studies until we get it done and the reason I'm doing that and the same thing I'm going to do it every other Thursday so I'll be one Thursday in holes County I'll be one Thursday here amen so pray for me uh but I'm excited to go through it again and the one of the main reasons I want to do that is we have so many that God has gathered in and so many new Believers that have just heard the message for the first time within the last year or two and so I really wanted to take these uh new believers who are hearing these things for the first time and also help them get established and I don't know of any better way to do it than the church ages book and so I'm going to go through it from cover to cover uh in the fellowship hall and uh and we've already talked to several of those to make sure that night would work for those that are new amen but we want to open it up to everybody else so if there's anybody else who would like to come especially if you're young or if you've never been to the church age book we'd love for you to come you're welcome to be there and I know Brother Kyle went through it with the youth he went through the entire church age book in a series of Bible studies but I think it's been what four years ago it's hard to believe that wow after four years you got a whole new crop of Youth coming up who didn't go through it so any of those who haven't been through it amen we'd love for for you to join in for that so we'll be doing that starting January 25th anden I also wanted to um introduce you to brother Denny and sister Carrie Ferguson they're sitting right here God bless you all amen they've they've joined us in Fellowship over the last few months I had a chance to sit down down and talk with them amen I asked how they got here and their story is quite amazing but in the end they told me we believe the Lord brought us hereen amen and they were attending a church in Finley that they had been at for more than 30 years I think almost 40 years they had a pastor that they dearly loved who was a lover of the word and taught them the word and uh they they did quite well there and that Pastor passed away a couple years ago and they were looking around trying to find a place to call home and so I asked them how they found us I mean they live in aah and I asked them how they found us and sister Cary went to an old Yellow Pages she had in her house open the old yellow pages and under non-denominational church there's only two listing and because Believers Christian Fellowship starts with a B guess who was first we haven't been in the Yellow Pages for 8 n 10 years or may I don't know how long and so you talk about a needle in the Hast stack God knows how to find his children so they came amen they streamed one service they came they found a familiar place a place that felt comfortable felt like home and they've been hearing the message now amen through fresh ears and enjoying enjoying what they're hearing and believing what they're hearing we say God bless you it's good to have you with us their daughters with them today from to we want to say God bless you all amen I can say God's doing a marvelous work and he's doing a marvelous work nobody can take credit God's going and finding his own sheep and bringing them into the fold and so we just thank God for that so we'll be starting that Bible study as well also want to let you know we're going to have a visitor from Poland come in tomorrow will be with us for one week so they'll be in service Wednesday and Sunday it's brother Cornelius from Poland he grew up in England so you're going to wonder why this PO poish young man has an English accent but he lived all his life in England few years ago he moved back to Poland brother IL and I met him there and I've met him in uh subsequent trips as well he's a nice young brother he wants to do a little traveling he wants to come and see us he's not a minister he's not ministering he just coming to join us for some fellowship so you'll see brother Cornelius Lord willing on Wednesday amen also wanted to let you know that next Sunday January 21st brother Gabe Smith will be up in Lorraine ministering for brother Nathaniel sias so we want to keep him in prayer as well amen there's always a lot amen I like it when there's a lot because a body should be moving and breathing and working and doing and I thank God for that me let's all stand together and let's look into God's word together uh Genesis chapter 2 Genesis 2:1 16 if you remember Wednesday I said this was going to be a continuation of the thought there was no not enough time in one service to put this together amen so I preached Wednesday as a to me an incomplete thought so I'm I'm coming back today and I pray that the Lord will help me amen share what's in my heart Genesis 2:16 and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die amen God bless you as you take your seats and may the Lord bless us as we look into his word the last service we titled Deliverance is first found in the Commandment Deliverance is first found in the Commandment brother B said in the identified Masterpiece of God he said to think that the man that was made in the image of his creator and was given a wall to stand behind and that word could never fail that's the Christian hope it's his shield it's his armor it's his Rock today is to stay behind the word every believer and so we know that that the Deliverance or the protection I say Deliverance because I know if you never fall from the word you never need Deliverance but I don't know any better way to phrase this to give the thought so it may not be a great way to do it but praise God we just do what we can but Deliverance is first found in the Commandment so so many times we transgressed the laws of God and we did we did hear in the Garden of Eden amen Adam and Eve they fell from the word of God they were given a commandment to keep one thing that they had to keep and that word was the safety net that word was the wall that word was the protection that word was security that word was everything and as long as they stayed in that one commandment there'd be no death there'd be no sickness there'd be no heartache there'd be no Thorns no thistles there would be nothing there would be no cold there would be nothing to harm them there would be no death there'd be absolutely no harm if they would have stayed with that one commandment so after the Commandment was transgressed they needed a Deliverance but but when we recognize that Deliverance is first found in the Commandment if we just keep the word of God it'll protect us from so many things and that still holds true today if we would just stay obedient to the voice of God and stay behind the wall of his word and amen there's so many things that it does has and will keep us from amen so let's look turn to Jeremiah this is another scripture for Wednesday we're doing this as a review uh the book of Jeremiah chapter 7 Jeremiah 7: 22 says for I spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices but this thing commanded I them saying obey my voice and I will be your God and you shall be my people and walk in all the ways that I have commanded you that it may be well unto you so we discussed this last time and talked about how when when God brought them up amen he didn't start off with a law he didn't start off with a a order of sacrifices an order of Temple worship that is not how God began what God wanted was a people who would just obey his voice and he said if you'll obey my voice you'll be a peculiar treasure unto me and all the Earth amen and he and what he wanted was a people just to obey amen but we know they failed right at the beginning we see it in Exodus 9 19 they fail right in Exodus when they come to God in si they ran away and they sent Moses instead but what God was wanting was a people that obey and he said uh verse 23 but this thing commanded I them saying obey my voice and I will be your God and you shall be my people and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you that it may be well unto you amen God's commandment was good for them it would have protected them it would have kept them safe and the same thing's true today the word of God is for us to keep us safe to keep us from harm to keep us from scars to keep us from mental oppression to keep us from broken homes to keep us from all kinds of disasters the word of God has been given to us to spare us so much trouble and on top of that God has sent a prophet in this day so we wouldn't keep wondering what was what but he would bring us up to the correct interpretation of the word and restore us back Amen to the the the doctrine of the Apostles amen and bring us back to the right understanding and also give us instruction for living in the in leoa it's the tremendous grace of God it's the voice of God in this day and to obey that voice will save us so much heartache so much pain so much suffering let's turn together to Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes chapter 12 this is the last chapter right at the end of Ecclesiastes and in chapter TW uh we're going to chapter 12 verse 13 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man when it comes down to the end of everything what what does Ecclesiastes say fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man that's what man was supposed to do in the Garden of Eden he had one to keep and he failed uh let's let's go to John 14 and we're going to go to the New Testament to show that this is not just an Old Testament uh commandment this is not just a law type thing this is a principle of God and this is a desire of God this is God's desire this is what God wants and this is what he want for his children so his attitude his desire has not changed not just Old Testament but now we're coming in to to the New Testament in John 14 John 14:1 15 Jesus says in John 14:15 if you love me keep my Commandments now verse 23 Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the Father which sent me so it's very clear even in the New Testament that Jesus wants us to keep his Commandments Jesus wants us to obey his voice and we come we we we Wednesday picked it up in the Apostle Paul he says if any of you be spiritual or be a prophet let him acknowledge that the things that I speak unto you they are the words of the Lord they are the Commandments of the Lord so the Commandments of the Lord didn't just stop with the red print in your Bible but it continued on when he came down into his gifts and through his Apostles and he began to give his word and and God Amen Jesus wants us to obey his Commandments why cuz it'll be well with us that's why amen last time we gave some very practical examples we talked about how the Commandment Paul taught a man how he ought to love his wife and a woman how she ought to reverence her husband and we talked about so many times we come into family tension family trouble strife and we start crying out for deliverance we need God to save our marriage we need God to save our home amen but the Deliverance was already in the Commandments if a man will love his wife even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it and it see that the wife reverence her husband amen if we would just go to what the apostles taught am mean we wouldn't get into the situation down the road where we're crying out for help where we're calling somebody to come and save us to sitting down and working out we we could have worked it out ahead of time and saved ourselves all kinds of Heartache all kinds of trouble all kinds of grief amen we find today that there is such a there is such a a problem with addictions and and we find all kinds of chemical dependency and drug addiction and alcohol and tobac but if we would just obey the word of God and keep our bodies as the Temple of the Holy Ghost and not defile the temple and not defile our bodies it would save us so much trouble that comes from those things we see the world completely uh destroyed young people completely destroyed amen because of these things but the Deliverance is already embedded in the Commandment amen we see young men and unfortunately we see young girls now addicted Amen to look at images they shouldn't the lust are incited and they're addicted to the pictures and videos amen but the scripture already had a Deliverance for this it said I will set no evil thing before mine eyes amen amen and Jesus Jesus says amen job said I made a covenant with my eyes why should I then look upon a maid yeah and Jesus says a man that lookth after a woman to lust after has committed adultery with they're already in his heart the word says don't look don't ever look but then then you start looking in transgression to the commandment and then all of a sudden lust is inside it a an addiction kicks in because of the chemicals that fire in the brain now you're crying out for deliverance because you're addicted to looking at things you shouldn't look at amen but the Commandment was your deliverance don't look the first time it's the truth amen amen if we would just obey his voice we would be spared so much trouble we would just do what the word says do it would help us so much let's look at John 15 together John 15 and verse 9 as the father hath loved me so have I loved you continue in my love if you keep my Commandments you shall shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full Jesus spoke these things to us that his Joy might remain in us and our joy might be full why because if we keep his Commandments we'll abide we'll stay in his love not that he's going to stop loving us he loved us before the foundation of the world Amen but you can abide in or you can abide outside his love amen because his love is his word you can live in the realm of his word and you can have his joy in you or you can step away amen and you can have trouble and grief and anguish and yeah amen all of these things amen I still haven't given you my title for this morning because I don't want to yet I don't want you to jump to the conclusion I want you to hang with me amen so we know that the Deliverance is first found in the Commandments now let's turn to Proverbs together Proverbs Proverbs chapter 3 I hope that we're thoroughly convinced now that God wants us to obey his voice without question and just because the law was abolished does not mean God wanted us to stop following his Commandments amen the abolishing or the fulfilling of the law the law was fulfilled it was not done away with the Bible says the law is perfect yeah the problem was never the law the problem was always the man all right and so God fulfilled the law but he never changed his desire for man to keep his Commandments but now you can't keep you can't keep his Commandments to redeem yourself you can't keep his Commandments to save yourself he you keep his Commandments because he wants you to keep his Commandments and it benefits you amen amen but God never changed his mind about obeying his voice that he never changed that it's obligatory his word is obligatory and he wants us to obey his voice he gives it for a reason not so that we can decide whether we will or won't keep it right so now we find that when we do leave the word that God has a way of chasing us to bring us back to his word in Proverbs 3:11 it says my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his correction for whom the Lord loveth he corrected even as a Father the Son and whom he delighteth amen what does God do when we leave his commandment and leave his word he correct us who does he correct he corrects the one that he Delights in it's his love and his Delight let's go over to Hebrews 12 now and catch the same thought Hebrews 12 and we're going to read from Hebrews 12 starting at verse 5 Hebrews 12 and5 and ye have forgotten the exhortation with speaketh un you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him this isn't just the Old Testament it's New Testament now for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement where of all our partakers then are you bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and he and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chasen us after their own pleasure but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastisement for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby the chastening of the Lord is the love of God it's his Delight it means you're his special treasure yeah because he knows the only safe place is in his word he knows the only place to be protected from the Ws of the devil from the entrapments of the enemy the only way amen is in his word and when we step out to the right or to the left he's a good shepherd He has a rod and he has a staff he's a father that will bring correction and chastisement and he said don't be weary this is for our good amen this is for our profit he's going to bring us back to the word because then the word is love and the word is peace and the word is protection and the word is everything that we have need of so when we ourselves fail he brings us back to the word brother Bram says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he he he he's going to share something personal that I thought I found to be amazing says now we come back here to visit the climate in this place I certainly don't like cuz it just breaks me down as soon as I get here I can cross the top of the knobs up there and come down in this Valley and I'm here about 10 minutes and I got hives get sick weather swimmy-headed everything looks spooky dark and I just have to get out of it see and the other day I was talking to the wife but what brings me in first what brings me here as you people see this church I tell you of all the places I ever in my life it all the places I ever went in my life this is my favorite place to come preach the gospel it looks like that we can make a tape from here that's 10 times better than anywhere else see that's the reason I say where God is doing something then stay right with it now catch this part but I think where the great thing is that was me failing to go out at the first time when he called me and therefore he makes it kind of rough on me when I come in obedience is better than sacrifice here's the prophet of God decades after he made a mistake decades later amen God had sent him out into the Pentecostal people when he was in Mich walk come in contact Amen in that conference and he got a a whole pile of invitations around the country and he came back and he let his mother-in-law talk him out of it amen and she criticized him and he backed down and we know the price that Prophet had to pay amen because that Prophet was out of the will of God and out of the word of God because he had a job to do and God brought a chastisement upon his prophet and that Prophet lost his father he lost his brother he lost his daughter and he lost his wife all in a short period of time and now here he is decades later and he's saying every time I come in here this place it's back for my health and I get swimmy-headed I get all this stuff going on Amen and he goes I think the reason is is because he makes it tough on me cuz I didn't go out the first time I said my goodness God had left a reminder amen like a thorn in the flesh of Paul a reminder of why it's always good to obey the voice of God and I don't know about you but that Prophet was left with a reminder I've got some reminders in my life some Pricks in my life that remind me that it's always best to stay with the word of God and God leaving that little prick amen is the grace of God in my life amen so that I remember the next time I come to a y on the road I'm going to take the word regardless of what I feel regardless of what anybody else says because I know the consequences for leaving the word the word is the only way amen so the prophet of God was left was left with this uh uh Thorn I would say irritation this problem because he didn't go out the first time he goes on and he says in the message who is this he said what if somebody sinned maybe they did do something they ought not to have done maybe they ought to have done something they did not do or something on that Ma Manner and here they are God permitting Satan to hold that curse on them to bring them to something to obedience sickness is sometimes is a whip God uses to bring obedience what a thing for the prophet of God to say Amen in in the the age of Grace Amen in the time yeah in the New Testament era that God would still allow Satan to bring a whip to bring us back to obedience that's God's love his tender Mercy his affection his his peculiar watch over his children that's it on display amen amen God is good let's turn to First Corinthians I want to reinforce this with a couple more scriptures before I really get to the heart of what I really want to say 1 Corinthians 11 1 Corinthians 11:31 1 Corinthians 11:31 for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world God's not going to let us go he's a good father and he's not going to let us keep transgressing his word without bringing us back into obedience because that's what he wants he wants us to love him and to obey his Commandments let's go to uh Revelation chapter 3 Revelation 3: 19 in Revelation 3: 19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent who does he rebuke and chasen as many as he loves this is the love of God he wants us to repent and come back to his word makes this statement in the message influence he says and this young man said well I tell you what I think about God I think that God loves me so much till he'll let me get by with anything this is Grace unto disgrace this is disgraceful Grace he said I believe God loves me so much he let me get by with anything and me sometimes we can take that attitude to the Bride of Jesus Christ oh God loves his bride I'm bride I'm bride but don't think that God won't correct his bride because she has to stay in his command if anybody will love him and keep his Commandments it'll be his bride and if we step to the right or to the left it's his love it's his great love it's his grace amen that'll bring us back in line with his word so we don't want to get that attitude that that I don't need any correction I'm his bride and we think you know sometimes we think well I've come to a level of maturity when the Bride Comes to maturity she doesn't need correction and all this amen that should be true the problem is we all along keep thinking we're uh uh mature right for 40 years we felt like we were mature and now we think we're mature we have no idea where we are on the stratus of maturity we feel like well I've come to maturity and no longer have to be corrected no longer oh come on we're still in Cocker sticky flash we still have a dual nature we still need to come under the word of God and we still need God to correct us and bring us back in lineen sometimes we get fanciful ideas amen but the reality is we're still prone to mistakes so he says I he loves me so much till he'll let me get by with anything I said he never did do that this is Brother brenham's response he never God never loved anybody let him get by with anything he never did do that he never would do it even Israel his Nation even David a man after his own heart reaped every grain that he sowed and you'll do it too each one of us will do that we know that amen praise God I want to turn to 2 Samuel and now we're going to start moving into part two and there's a reason we did this and you'll see as we go a little further 2 Samuel 2 Samuel chapter 7 2 Samuel chap 7 vers vers 12 and when thy days be fulfilled this is speaking to David King David when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and I will establish his kingdom and he shall build a house for my name and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom forever and I will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men but my Mercy shall not depart away from him as I took it from Saul when I put away before thee and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee thy Throne shall be established forever a and thy Throne shall be established forever am mean we know that every scripture has a dual prophecy and when it's speaking of the Throne of David forever it's speaking of the coming of the king of kings the son of David which will be Jesus Christ but it's also speaking of Solomon his son coming to the throne and he says if he commit iniquity I will chasen him with the rod of men I will chase him it says I want to read that again in verse 14 if he commit iniquity I will chasen him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men but my Mercy shall not depart away from him he's making a declaration amen he's saying amen if he he steps out of line if he gets into iniquity I will chasen him I will spank him I will bring him back in line but I'm promising you this David my Mercy will not depart from him oh praise be to God and we know speaking of Solomon did Solomon get out of line yes he got out of line did Solomon blow it yes he blew it Solomon had so many wives and Disobedience to the Commandment of God he he brought to him an abundance of wives and those wives LED his heart astray and he went to worshiped other gods amen the end of his life was disgraceful but you see God kept his word he never removed his Mercy from Solomon and brother brandham said and a man is a failure to begin with I don't care who he is Solomon was the wisest man that ever walked the face of the Earth to that time amen and and he knew all kinds of things but Solomon was a failure to begin with I don't care who he is he is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies so he's a total failure oh praise God I'm glad he said that let's go to psalms now Psalms 6 86 I'm sorry sorry Psalms 86 Psalms 86 verse1 15 but thou oh Lord art a God full of compassion and gracious longsuffering and plenteous in Mercy and Truth now I'm going to give you my second title is that okay first title is Deliverance is first found in the commandment and I hope we can all say that that's the truth if Adam and Eve would have never transgressed God law there would have never been any need for anything else they had everything amen the the word of God is obligatory we're supposed to keep it it's not optional I hope we can get it's not option it's not based on how I feel I don't feel like keeping today I feel no it's obligatory God said if you Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments if you love me not you won't keep my Commandments it's a clear delineation all right so we understand that the word of God is obligatory to the children of God and God's always been looking for somebody that obey his voice so the the the God's word is our protection God's word is our wall God's word is our Safety and Security we understand that and we know that's true so Deliverance is first found in the commandment but today I'd like to talk about Deliverance is finally found where do you finally find Deliverance Deliverance is finally found in grace and mercy why is Deliverance finally found in grace and mercy because man is a failure to begin with he's born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and every one of us has fallen away every one of us has failed to keep the Commandments every one of us have transgressed the laws of God and the only way that we're going to find Deliverance now is by his grace and mercy Mercy that's where we finally find Deliverance because we fall we fail amen if we would have never left the word we would have never needed anything else the problem is every one of us have left the word and continue to do so so the final place of Deliverance is grace and mercy now this truth doesn't take away from the first truth it always remains true God wants us to obey and obedience is Safety and Security and obedience is where God wants us to be but there's the the second does not diminish the first and the first does not diminish the second both of these things are simultaneously true that's why I told you Wednesday was an incomplete thought because we get out on a limb so far and realize brother Chad you're right amen that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth but what do I do now what do I do my marriage is now in trouble now I'm addicted now I've got problems now I have needs now I've wrecked my body body now I've wrecked my health now I've wrecked my mind what do I do now amen I've missed the first opportunity for deliverance is there any Deliverance for me and the answer is absolutely there's Deliverance for you because the final place of his Deliverance is in his grace and mercy he's abundant in Mercy he's abundant in Grace he's longsuffering and patient and kind is he a father who chasen you yes but that's his kindness and love will he keep will he make you keep his word will he correct you when you come outside of his word absolutely that's his love and grace but finally where will I find Deliverance I will find it in his grace and mercy let's go to Exodus 34 Exodus 34 Verse five this is in The Exodus Journey he's still speaking to Israel Exodus 34:5 through Moses and he says and the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord and the Lord passed by before him this is before Moses and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious this is he's passing before Moses and he's giving Moses an understanding of who he is this is his introduction amen the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth that's who our God is amen that's who this Lord is that come down on SI this is who he was to the children of Israel and he was this Lord who is merciful and goodness and longsuffering and full of Truth he said if you'll obey my voice you'll be a peculiar treasure above all people amen that was his grace and his Mercy let's go quickly to Joel through the Book of Joel I'm sorry we're flipping a lot but I just want to lay this Foundation down I like flipping through the Bible does me good all right Joel chapter 2 Joel chapter 2 and we're going to read from verse 12 Joel 2:2 therefore also no no sayith the Lord turn ye even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning and Rend your heart and not your garments this I love this I I just just stay with me in this Rend your heart and not your garments amen you know why because when an apostasy would come when tragedy would strike amen when when the armies would gather around so often in their anguish and grief and the show their distress they would rip their garment it was very symbolic and tearing of the Garment amen but but but God is telling his people don't just go through the motions don't just outwardly display ringe your heart not your garment when you get into distress when you get into trouble when you when you call on the name of the Lord when you need Deliverance don't just Rend your garment Rend your heart Rend your heart and not your garment and turn unto the Lord your God for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evil oh what do I do amen I I must come back to God in Repentance and come back to his word amen when the chastening of the Lord comes down what's he trying to do he's trying to drive me back to the word back to the Commandment back to where I can abide in his love and be a peculiar treasure to him above all the peoples of the Earth but what do I have to do I have to come back and Rend my heart Daniel does this let's go to Daniel The Book of Daniel just a little bit couple books to the left Daniel chapter n this is a long prayer but I'm just going to read a couple segments out of it and Daniel now is praying and seeking the Lord in chapter 9 Daniel chapter 9 and verse 4 and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned and have committed iniquity what a good first step it God is so gracious and God Is So merciful that he calls us back to himself but when we come back to him I mean we're not to come back and act like nothing happened like we didn't transgress as law like we didn't do anything wrong we just step back in like well I I got out here and CR I'm back here and yeah everything's fine no look at look at the attitude this is what is so important amen he says we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments neither have we hearkened unto the servants and the the the prophets which spake in the name in thy name to our Kings our princes our fathers and to all the people of the land oh Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces what Daniel saying righteousness belongs to you but we're getting what we deserve as at that day as at this day to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all Israel that are near and that are far off though all the country throughout through all the countries whether thou has driven them because they they their trespassed that they have trespassed against thee Oh Lord to us belongeth confusion of Faith to our Kings to our princes to our fathers because we have sinned against thee to the Lord Our God belongeth mercy and forgiveness though we have rebelled against him you know what he's saying God this isn't your fault you gave us your prophets you gave us your word you gave us your Commandments and we didn't listen and we strayed away and we forsook you amen you deserve right unto you is righteousness unto us is confusion of faith we deserve what we get but love and mercy is with you you were never wrong you were never out of line you never treated us bad you never failed me you never failed them Daniel is saying mercy and forgiveness has always been with you righteousness has always been with you the problem is not with you the problem is with us we left your word we disobeyed we transgressed we didn't hear your prophets we did our Kings didn't hear our leaders didn't hear and now we're getting what we deserve this is what Daniel's crying to the Lord he says I'm going to read verse 10 again neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his laws which he said set before us by his servants the prophets y all Israel have transgressed thy law even by departing that they might not obey the V thy voice therefore the curse is poured out upon us and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God because we have sinned against him praise be to God let's scroll down this is verse 16 let's let's pick it up again in 16 oh Lord according to all thy righteousness I beseech thee thee let thine anger and thy Fury be turned away from thy City Jerusalem thy Holy Mountain because for our sins and for for the iniquities of our fathers Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us now therefore Oh Our God hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy Sanctuary that is desolate for the Lord's sake oh my God incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and behold our desol ations in the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness but for thy great mercies oh Lord hear oh Lord forgive oh Lord hearken and do defer not for thine own sake oh my God for the city and thy people are called by thy name I love Daniel's prayer Daniel's prayer is so honest it's so true God we failed you you you know God never failed through the church ages that wasn't God's failure that was our failure we can stand like Daniel Daniel Daniel wasn't there 300 years before Daniel wasn't there a thousand years before but Daniel was placing himself in the same lump amen he's saying God we failed you we didn't listen to your problem he wasn't even there that day that they didn't listen but he's putting himself in the same spot and I think we can do the same thing God your people this bride amen your church has failed you amen we failed to keep the apostles word we failed to keep the New Testament order we failed we failed we failed we failed but oh God restore us according to your mercy restore us according to your righteousness for we're the people called by your name not for our sakes cuz we're a failure but for your sake for your name For Your Glory would you heal us will you strengthen us will you bring us back in line with your word God has done that in that this day this is the day we live in amen we should be GL we should glorify God because his Mercy Mercy brought his word back to us his grace has reestablished the truth when it was lost because of our failure his Mercy his grace his great righteousness has brought the word back amen they went back to Israel when they turned their hearts back to God and they confessed their sins and repented and had a desire to come back to the word God in his graciousness according to his promise brought them back to Israel to reestablish Jerusalem and to build back the temple amen not because they were good because he was good and he was going to keep his word when they were ready to come back to his word he brought him back to the word oh if we're ready to come back to his word he'll bring us back to his word amen praise God let's go to Lamentations we're going everywhere friends Lamentations is after Jeremiah written written by Jeremiah because Lamentations is about the destruction and casting away of Israel Jeremiah receives the prophecy that they're going to be sent away they're going to become captives of Babylon for 70 years there's a destruction and desolation coming to Jerusalem because they forso the law of the Lord because they didn't love the lord they're being Cast Away and in Lamentations is Jeremiah weeping over the Desolation that's coming and God actually tells Jeremiah Don't Pray for Jerusalem amen their iniquity had come to a fullness judgment had to come according to his word and he's actually telling Jeremiah Don't intercede anymore for it amen because I'll have to listen to you right because you're part of me right so he says don't pray for Jerusalem so now he's lamenting amen over what what's going to happen and in Lamentations 3 verse 21 1 this is what he says limitations 321 this I recall to my mind therefore have I hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not he said in my Lamentations I recall a mind I recall this to my mind I remembered something God doesn't just chasen God also heals God doesn't just chasen but he restores I this I recall to my mind therefore have I hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness this is how he's encouraging himself in the time amen of their chastisement for their Rebellion he says I remembered something I remembered amen greater his mercies oh I remember the Lord's mercies it's his mercies that were not consumed because because his compassion doesn't fail they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness what's he looking at he's not looking at himself now he's not even looking at the chastisement which is due and which is just and which must come to pass he's looking beyond that that God is a merciful god he's a forgiving God he's a longsuffering God and he's not going to utterly cast us away amen let's go to verse 31 for the Lord will not cast off forever but though he cause grief that's the spanking though he cause grief yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies though he will chasten though he will cause grief he I love this word but though he cause grief yet will he have compassion even in the chastisement he will have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies I'm so thankful you know what I don't deserve anything you know what I deserve death and destruction and torment amen why because I transgressed his laws you say oh brother Chad you were ignant no I did it when I knew better not in ignorance and willful Disobedience friends I hate that I'm ashamed to say that to you but it's absolutely the truth I have not always got it right I still don't always get it right there's times that I fail God Amen there's times I take an attitude something pops out of my mouth I say something I shouldn't say and I know it's wrong amen none of us can claim to have arrived and we're no longer of any failure whatsoever and we come to Perfection but oh God great is thy mercies Great Is Thy Faithfulness th Mercy is Everlasting amen and it shall not fail that's what I'm imploring I'm not imploring my goodness I'm not imploring my greatness I can't oh God you know I believe your word I only believe his word because he put something in me to believe with not because of my brain or my willpower I've no it's all God's grace in my life and now I'm not standing imploring him by favor for anything that I have done of any righteousness but all I can say is God you're faithful your mercies are new every morning your compassion faileth not oh God would you have compassion and mercy on me cuz I deserve uh confusion of face I deserve to be Cast Away like your nation of Israel but oh God just like you reather them will you reather me praise God I was thinking while I was meditating on this I was thinking about little Henry our grandson and he's learning so many things for the first time he's learning what to touch what not to touch what the boundaries are that right and his parents are giving him Commandments and their Commandments are not Grievious but their life to keep him safe to keep him from harm yeah to keep him out of danger right and I'm sure that his mama would love to say sometimes if you love me just keep my Commandments cuz toddlers are tough if you love me just keep my Commandments I remember one time when David was itty bitty we were riding a ski lift we were up in obber Gatlinburg we took the tram up Angie's pretty afraid of heights we took the tram up she survived the tram but then we were going to ride the Alpine Slide the little scooter thing going down the mountain and and the first time up the little it's just a little bitty ski lift to get up and ride it down first time up David was sitting with Angie well Angie's afraid of heights David has zero fear of heights so you can imagine what that ride was like it she felt like she was riding on the ski lift with a squirrel he was leaning over the edge he was turned around waving at us he said mom look at this and and the whole thing's rocking and swaying so she took his little t-shirt he's probably five or six years old she took his T-shirt and she wound it around his hand like the her hand and she said David if you love me at all you will sit still if you love me even a little bit you won't move if you love me keep my Commandments we got down to the bottom of the hill and David comes over to me dad can I ride with you mom won't let me won't let me move but I'm sure with little Henry they would love to say if you love me just keep my it's for your good I haven't told you anything to hurt you I haven't done anything to harm you I haven't given any commandment to to prevent you from life to keep you from fun God allows us to be parents so we can learn a few things you know and I'm I'm watching this whole play on I'm just remembering raising children and we've got a wood burning fireplace and Henry knows that it's hot he knows what hot means he comes over say hot he knows not to touch it but it'll get close and he'll try and and you just think about a little toddler amen that that they they've got that they've got that I just can't help but say it sinful nature yeah right they just got to push the barrier they just got to go beyond the command yeah right and so they'll say don't touch he'll move closer stick out his hand don't touch then there comes a correction amen a rod of Correction and all of a sudden his little life is ruined and mom hates me and dad doesn't want me to have any fun this is the worst thing I've ever lived through in all my life and they have no idea this is love this is Mercy this is Grace but you know what we all know as parents I know it as a grandparent watching I know beyond a shadow of a doubt one day he's going to touch it is there any child who hasn't I know he's going to touch it right I know there's going to come a day when we're not watchful enough when when he's got a little bit of a head start he's going to touch it it's going to hurt it's going to be painful but I also know he's not going to die it's not going to be life-threatening it's not going to be permanent but I also know that when when he touches it he'll understand the grace and mercy that's found in the Commandments amen yeah this is life friends yeah this is the way we go you know it's going to happen you know he's going to touch it and you know the moment he touches it he's going to realize mom loves me and her commandment was for my good amen not for my harm brother BM says in the message Fellowship he said in closing I might say this in the Garden of Eden when God saw that his children had sinned and gone from him God himself who is the Supreme judge made a Reconciliation so he could restore that Fellowship to his creatures by the shed blood of an animal he goes on in the message Perfection he says now when God seen that his children had transgressed his law and that they must die the death then Sovereign Love stepped in to make a way what did they do they transgress the law did they know better yes did he tell them ahead of time yes should they have done it no but when they did when they did look at his reaction he comes on the scene and provides a substitute so he could keep them in Fellowship did they suffer yes we are still suffering from the consequences of disobeying the word but although he didn't remove the suffering amen he came down amen and he made an atonement so that he can keep the fellowship then Sovereign Love stepped in to make a way for God seen that these children was to be absolutely totally annihilated from his presence there was nothing else to be done for they had transgressed his law and the penalty of his law was death and then love of God went out for his subjects what was it it was his love it was his love that gave him the Commandment but when they failed it was his love that restored the fellowship it was all his love yeah they needed deliverance from what they needed deliverance from Eternal separation they needed a deliverance from separation from The Fellowship Of God Amen what did they need they needed the Deliverance the Deliverance was first found in the Commandment if they would have kept that commandment they would never be in need and Genesis 3 amen but now they find themselves in need and now their Deliverance is found in the mercy and Gra of God and he comes on the scene and does for them what they cannot do for themselves and then love of God went out for his subjects and when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace produces the object of the love and God by forn knowledge when he loved this his race so well yet with the penalty he caused a substitutionary death to take place in the Garden of Eden that was he substituted an innocent creature a little lamb that know no sin and it went for a substitute to work and to die in the stead of his guilty Sinner and it was a lamb slain to hold the life of his subjects I'd like for you to turn with me to Revelation chapter 13 Revelation chap 13 verse 8 Revelation 13 and8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world God that means god in his mind had a land slain from before the foundation of the world he also had a book and is The Book of Life and part part of that is the Lamb's Book of Life the record of the elect and God had assembled that before the foundation of the world and before the foundation of the world he already had a Plan of Redemption and he already had himself coming as a son to be the sacrifice to atone for the sins of his children already you know what he knew he knew they were going to touch the stove he knew they were going to do it he knew it was going to happen he told him not to because that's his grace and his Mercy but he knew that they would eventually someday they're going to touch the stove so he already made a provision for the day that would happen his love gave the Commandment but before the Commandment his love already made a way of redemption and Reconciliation this is his Mercy this is is his grace that's why Deliverance is finally found in Mercy and [Music] Grace you know what happens now when little Henry touches the stove this is I Marvel how predictable human nature is sometimes Henry will receive the Commandment from a loving mother and a loving father who wants him to be safe and protected did and if you keep my commandment you abide in my love and nothing will hurt you but Human Nature has to push the boundaries and now the thing that he's told not to touch is the only thing in the world he wants to touch he can have toys littered the floor he can have $1,000 worth of toys on the floor and he doesn't want to touch any of them the only thing he wants to touch is the thing he's not supposed to touch we are the same way we think we're not but we are this is human nature right he told David I gave you wives I gave you land if you wanted more wives I would have given you more wives but you had to go and touch somebody else's wife the one I said don't touch if you wanted another wife I'd to give you another wife yeah but you had to go and touch the one that I said don't touch yeah floor littered yeah and all he wants to do is touch it and when he goes to touch it Mama corrects him and he and arches his back and throws himself on the floor and is unfairly treated and misunderstood and nobody loves him why is this happening to me you know if you're a Christian you don't get away with anything the rod of God is Mercy and Grace why is this happening to me why I'm in so much trouble why won't the car start and then why I won't this and then why this and why that amen just ask God God is there anything that you want me to do differently than what I'm doing that doesn't mean every trial is chastisement but it's a good time to ask a question at least so you know what he'll do he'll go move towards the little fireplace and and he'll put his hand out and he'll look over his shoulder see if anybody's looking and Mom and Dad will say no then all of a sudden if he's got enough room enough head star or nobody's looking he'll move and if Mama comes off the couch to go get him or daddy comes off you know what he'll do he'll run away from the very lifegiver yeah that has given him life so that he could fulfill a lustful desire yeah he'll run and he'll touch the stove the thing is heart craved the one thing he wanted to experience to know what it was like for himself yeah and the moment he has the experience he regrets it right how many times that has happened to you and I run from the very thing we're not to have amen David was not supposed to touch Bas Sheba but I believe the moment he was done fulfilling his lustful desire he regretted calling her into his his Palace right but guess what you know what's going to happen to little Henry CU he's not already callous and he's not already tainted by the world and he doesn't have hypocrisy and he doesn't try to look good you know what's going to happen to him the minute he touches that and feels the pain he's going to run back to Mama run back to Daddy throw himself in their arms crying in pain and you know what Mama and Daddy's going to do they're going to have mercy and love and grace for little Henry he's not going to get a whiping he's not going to get chastisement he's not going to be told I told you you know what he's going to do he's going to get ointment he's going to get uh he's going going to get whatever can soothe whatever can Comfort whatever can take away the pain he's going to get kisses and he's going to get hugs and see if we would just stop being proud and arrogant and try to save face but when we would just go and touch the stove or do whatever if we would just run back to God and throw ourselves in our arms and say God I've hurt myself again I've damaged myself I've hurt my family God would you you save me would you forgive me would you cleanse me oh God have mercy on me God would you embrace me again would you would you tell me it's going to be okay once again and guess what Henry may hurt for a little while it may sting for a few days he may get a little blister he may have something go on like that but by the grace of God he'll know that Mama's commandment is love Daddy meant love and where do I find love after I failed right back at the first place I Found Love and got the command in the first place because it's all God's love and grace and mercy his commandment and also his restoration his Mercy his grace and his forgiveness it's all his love amen for his children oh I wish we could be more like children not have to act like we didn't touch the stove we'll go over here and Sizzle our fingers and everybody sees the smoke coming off your hand that's the truth friends we can all tell when everything's disjointed and somebody's out of s you can see it we'll put our hand in our pocket and go away and we're hurting like crazy but we don't want anybody to know what we just did try to hide it from others try to hide it from God right when what we need to do is say I just transgress the word of God and I hurt myself I need comfort I need love I need healing I need restoration yeah where are you going to find it if you don't get it from the body of Christ amen why can't we just come to Christ in his body and say I hurt myself again why can't we find love and mercy and compassion and Grace in God's provided way yeah am the very one who gives the Commandment is the very one who restores because it's God's love brother B said when his love projected his feeling Christ stepped out to take his place it required something to take the place his love alone went for you and Grace provided a sacrifice for you you know what Grace provided you know what love provided first a commandment yes but you know what grace and mercy also provided a sacrifice for when you transgress the commandment and when did God have the sacrifice he had the sacrifice before he gave the Commandment amen this is God's love yeah let's turn to Isaiah 53 you know brother bam says that this life is our training training for reigning right and God knows how to train us and you know when we go through the things in life we go through we keep realizing over and over that only the Commandment Works only the word works that's the only place to be every time I step away I hurt myself I hurt others others I do damage every time I step out of the Commandment I I'm hurting myself or others amen and then God by his grace and mercy he will bring me back in amen but but I'm learning a lesson over and over and over and over I'm learning amen that to stay in the word is the best thing yes God loves us so much that he allows us to learn this lesson amen God didn't put a fence around the tree in the garden amen God didn't chop it down and burn it God didn't run down and grab by the hand and pull them away God knew that the lesson is going to be a valuable lesson because mankind is going to learn the only thing I want is to abide in his love to stay in his commandment to stay behind the wall of his word because that's the safest place for me to be I won't wind up with scars with bruises with wounds if I stay here but the scars and the bruises and the wounds are also God God's grace just like brother Brenham coming back into town and having problems with the weather it was God's grace to remind him always keep the word always obey my voice on Isaiah 53 I want to read from verse 4 surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before the shears is dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off for he was for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken not for himself but for the people of God for the children of God God provided his love provided for our transgressions for our iniquities for our Disobedience for our failure his love provided a way back and that love was found in Jesus Christ when God formed that body and stepped into it lived his life and then went and shed the blood of God on Calvary to what to atone for my my transgressions why I I I should be there you should be there I should have been whipped I should have had the beard put on I should have been spit on I should have been mocked I should have been ridiculed I should have had all of these things but it's a Father's Love who will bring re reconciliation by a sacrifice and he provided his own sacrifice if I would have just stayed with the word I would never if if you would have just stayed with the word if Adam would have justay with the word none of this would have been necessary none of this would have happened but he made this provision before Adam fell before the woman was deceived he made this provision why I think he wants us to know his love and his grace and his Mercy that he had I think he wants us to know him in the multitude of his long-suffering grace and mercy so we can say it wasn't ever me it was never me I messed up and then I messed up again again and then he rescued me and I messed up again and then he rescued me and I messed up again oh but it was his longsuffering grace and mercy that rescued me I couldn't rescue myself but he rescued me brother R says in the Rapture message he said I've always preached that he was deity not just a man he was God manifest In the Flesh God the attribute of god of love the great attributes that come down displayed here on Earth of God Jes Jesus was God's love which built a body that Jehovah himself lived in he was the fullness of the godhead bodly what God was he manifested through that body that body had to die so he could wash the bride with his blood what did he need he needed me clean but he couldn't depend on me to keep myself clean so he provided a blood he provided a life that would cleanse me he brought back his word that would cleanse us from the filth of these prostitutes why because he couldn't depend on me to keep myself clean because a man is a failure to begin with so God made a provision so that when I hurt myself I can go running back to him and say oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry and he can say I have a Sav I have a cream I have an atonement I have a word I have a blood that'll wash that sin away I have already made a provision I knew someday you would touch it but my love made a provision for me all you've got to do is come running back to the one who loves you and the one who loves you has the sav he's got he's got the ointment he's got the cream he's got the thing that'll heal and restore and bind up and deliver yes amen first John says it this way 1 John 1 18 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves this is brother brandham said Sinners don't have sins they have sin which is unbelief yeah and everything they do is an attribute of unbelief he goes but Saints have sins where we fall short we have mistakes backslidings transgressions right is that right not unbelief we're not disbelieving the word we're just failing it yeah we've been delivered from being sinners from unbelievers we're not under that category anymore now we're Saints amen but but we're still failing in some Aras we're still making mistakes we're still falling short what do I do now amen he he says if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness why cuz he's got a water of the bleeding water of the word that he can wash away all sin and all transgression what is he looking for he's waiting for us Amen to stop stop moving away from him and stop trying to get over to this thing we're not supposed to touch but at some point he can't do anymore some point he's already said what he's going to say he's preached what he's going to preach he sent a prophet he sent a preacher he sent his Bible and we got tapes we got books at some point he's just going to have to watch you touch the stove yeah right but oh if we would just quickly say oh God oh God oh God I touched the stove yeah I did what you you told me not to do and I'm hurt please forgive me oh God would you wash me cleanse me yeah amen that's what he's looking for friends he knew you would touch it that's why he's the lamb slain before the foundation on don't pretend you didn't what good does it do if you pretend that you've never touched the stove then you don't need the blood you don't need the washing of the water of the word you've already come to Perfection you're walking around with scarred up hands in your pocket acting like nothing ever happened yeah right let's just run back to father and say oh God I touched it Lord he knows you did anyways yeah touched it I did what I shouldn't have done I said what I shouldn't have said I looked at what I wasn't supposed to look at God would you forgive me and heal me I've wounded myself I've scarred myself I've damaged myself my mind is polluted my body is corrupted I it's not your fault you were always merciful you were always you know sometimes we pray such foolish prayers God why didn't you stop me that's an absolute selfish prayer you wanted God to share responsibility for your transgression of the word right God why didn't you stop me you could have stopped me why didn't you just take this away why didn't you just stand in my way why didn't you just shut the door why didn't you just send somebody it is not God's fault God gave us his word he gave it in every format in every form and Perfection we have his word it's not his fault it's our fault like Daniel said but if we would just recognize that and not try to make the church accountable my parents accountable other members of the body accountable my spouse accountable my boss accountable amen my boss made me mad that's why I said that they cheated me out of overtime that's why I stole the calculator but that's the nonsense that goes on in our minds instead of just saying I failed I made a mistake I deserve this pain but I'm hurting I've damaged myself oh God I mean you know Henry has no idea how mama's going to save him he has no idea how mama's going to deliver him all he knows is Mama and Daddy can help me now they can do something for me I don't know what to do and I'm telling you you may not know how God can deliver you in your situation how he can make this tragedy in your life go away or these damage that you've done to yourself but don't worry about that just run with your hand out and say oh Father father God Daddy Daddy I hurt myself would you heal me would you restore me would you help me God if we think we have no sin we deceive ourselves but all if we would confess our sins we'd be faithful and just forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness in the message in time evangelism he says you can't exhaust God could you imagine a little rat that long a little mouse under the great Garners of Egypt saying I better eat one grain of wheat a day I might run out before the next Harvest could you imagine a little fish about that long swimming out in the middle of the ocean saying I better drink of this water spare in ly because you know it might go dry sometime oh my that's trying to exhaust God's goodness and mercy to his people don't ever think you can't go to him again and you can't repent once more amen he said I'm so ashamed I did the same thing I did before this is the third fourth fifth it doesn't matter I mean when when the disciples were asking how many times do I forgive somebody a transgression Against Me Jesus said uh 490 times and one day he was and that's a human being he's trying to teach how to forgive their brother what about God forgiving you don't think that well i' I've already made a mistake I can't go back to God again who says you can't go back to God again who says he gets tired he ever gets tired of consoling you healing you comforting you who says that he's ever run out of grace and mercy who says that he's tired of longsuffering for his children he's not growing tired of the longsuffering for his children he's not running out of compassion his compassion won't fail he's not running out of Mercy well this one's a big one but you don't know brother Ted this one's really bad listen the little one and the big one are still equally as bad they may leave different scars in your life yeah but in the eyes of God they're not different they're both a transgression against the word the effect it has on us may vary that's just the reality of Life the scar you bear the pain you suffer and the duration with which you have to suffer it may vary depending on what we do but it doesn't change anything with the eyes of God if you'll confess your sins he's faithful to forgive your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness even it's the 490th time you can exhaust God's goodness and mercy to his people let's turn to Romans chapter 3 together you see why Wednesday was an incomplete thought it put us all on the limb we knew it was the truth you can't deny it's the truth it's absolutely the truth but at least leaves every one of us bankrupt and destitute it leaves every one of us a failure and deserving of everything we get that's why these two things have to come together so that we know how to live Romans chapter 3 verse 22 even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God yeah I I I think all is all I think I'm included in that for being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus who God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of them which believe in Jesus where is boasting then it is excluded amen by what law of Works nay but by the law of faith if we could have done everything God commanded us and always done it right we would have never needed Christ is that right we wouldn't have needed the blood but he knew that we wouldn't I mean we could never get it all right does that exclude us from the obligation of keeping his Commandments does that mean if we love him we won't keep no that doesn't change the first service at one drop it doesn't change anything we spoke it's obligatory it's mandatory this is what God wants this is what he expects and if we violate that we're going to hurt ourselves that is every bit the truth but the reality is if we could keep all of The Commandments and do everything he said then we no longer need the blood we no longer need the washing of the water word the reality is this is God's word this is the wall this is imp penetral this is safe amen you don't need anything else the problem is we are born in sin shap in iniquity and a failure to begin with and are continually failing I need Deliverance not just the deliverance from the word that delivers us from so much think about it friends in the lives that we live with the families we have with the fellowship we are delivered from so much pain and so much suffering that the world is experiencing right now his commandment is already delivering Us in obedience to the Commandment but I can't do it all all the time amen so I need another Deliverance that's found in his grace and his Mercy I need a place to go and say God forgive me I'm hurting let's go to Romans chapter 11 Romans chapter 11: 25 for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery L you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my Covenant unto them when when I shall take take away their sins as a as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake for the gifts and callings of God are without repentance for as ye in times past have not believed God yet have now obtained Mercy through their unbelief I want to read that again for as ye in times past have not believed God yet have now obtained Mercy through their unbelief why we weren't Believers the the Gentiles weren't Believers in God but through their unbelief God could turn from them to the Gentiles it was God's grace to the Gentiles amen so through their unbel unbelief Mercy now has turned to us even so have these also now not believed now they didn't believe Christ even so now these also now not believed that through your mercy they also May obtain Mercy for God ha concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out what God has done is he ended up throwing us all into unbelief so that he could show his mercy upon all I think God wants us to know he's a merciful god he's a long-suffering God and His compassions they fail not even turning away from the Jews so that we could obtain Mercy that through our Mercy one day they could also obtain Mercy when he turns back to them why so they all could be under God God's mercy I don't know about you but I love Mercy I love the mercy and the grace of God without it we would everyone be done finished gone if we got what we deserved we wouldn't be here now but he gave us what we don't deserve which is his grace and mercy and his great love shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost we didn't deserve that that's his love to us let's turn to Ephesians chapter 2 Ephesians chapter 2 verse four but God who is rich in Mercy oh I just love these scriptures but God who is he's not just merciful he's rich in Mercy The God Who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast did we get it right no I'd ask you this are we all perfectly getting it right right now I doubt it but all the abundance of his mercy God rich in Mercy when we were yet dead in sins and trespasses has he already quick us in Christ what a consolation for this life friends don't ever get so big don't get so high up in Revelation don't get so up in the in the realities of who we are that we don't forget that we're still in flesh yeah we're going to touch the stove I'm I hate to say that but you young people you older ones you're going to touch the stove but when you touch the stove don't hide your sin but forsake your sin run back to your father and say oh God I did it I did what you told me not to do I did what you warned me against but oh God would you forgive me would you wash me would you cleanse me will you heal me listen many of us are still bearing consequences of things that we did long ago we're still bearing about scars and consequences of past sins and past failures and and you have to say is there no Bal in Gilead is there no healing I believe there's still Mercy even for things done long ago even before we were Christians even after we were Christians failures from 20 years ago if you're still reaping a bad Harvest I would implore his Mercy I would say oh God turn Lord this evil for good God I did it I deserve it I don't deserve to have you come on the scene you don't owe me anything but I believe in your great Mercy I believe in your great grace God would you forgive me for the way I treated this person and the way I did this and I turned out my daughter I turned out my son I I I my failure is called God would you have mercy because I failed don't just live with it friends he's a god who's rich in Mercy amen his compassions they fail not his mercies are new every morning don't give up amen keep coming back and saying God oh merciful god would you fix this in my life would you heal this would you pour the balm of Gilead in I don't think Mercy can be exhausted you know when we need Mercy you don't need Mercy when you did right you only need Mercy when you're guilty is that right you can say well I want to give you mercy and I'm going to let you go you know you owe me five bucks but I'm going to show you Mercy you don't you say when did I owe you five bucks I don't owe you nothing you can only give Mercy if somebody's guilty yeah amen when we find ourselves guilty guilty of pain guilty of suffering guilty of broken families guilty of all kinds of problems when we find ourselves guilty that's when we need mercy and I wouldn't stop imploring the mercy of God I wouldn't stop saying God you know what I deserve I deserve everything I've got plus a th but God your mercy has brought me this far and I believe your mercy and your grace can restore can heal can bring back a family can bring back children can can do anything God there's no limit to your mercy I'm imploring your mercy and your grace would you allow your mercy to flow God would you bring your grace in my life and would you heal those wounds I brought to myself and others I believe Deliverance is finally found in grace and mercy amen let's all stand together but keep your Bibles open don't put your Bibles away we're going to read a scripture together in the Psalms musicians if you'll come I want to read psalms 136 let's turn together to Psalm 136 all right you got your Bibles ready are you with me yeah we're going to do this together so when we look at Psalm 136:1 it says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good then it says for his mercy endureth forever I'm going to read the first part but I want you every time I read the first part I want you to read the second half and I want you to say for his mercy endureth forever and do it as a congregation and let's just read this oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for hisc forever oh give thanks unto the god of gods for his sorry oh give thanks to the Lord of lords forever to him who alone doth great wonders for Mercy forever to him that by wisdom made the heavens Mercy end forever to him that stretched out the Earth above the waters for Mercy end forever to him that made great great light for his Mercy end forever the sun to rule by the dayc the moon and the stars are ruled by nightc to him that smote Egypt in their firstborn forc and brought out Israel from among them forc amen now let's move down verse 23 who remembered us in our lowest State forc and ha redeemed us from our enemies for his Merc forever who giveth food to all fleshy forever oh give thanks unto the god of Heaven for his Mercy end forever do you believe it do you believe that his mercy endureth forever amen no matter what you've done no matter how much pain you've caused no matter how many scars you bear no matter how difficult what it is don't ever forget his mercy endureth forever I man I believe with all my heart Deliverance is first found in the commandment and my desire is to keep all of his Commandments because I'll abide in his love I'll Be A peculiar treasure that's what he wants and that's what pleases him and that's my desire but I know that man is a failure to begin with and when I fall when I fail and when I disrupt the plan of God and disobey his word and hurt myself listen God never hurt me I hurt myself nobody else ever hurt me I hurt myself when I come into that place then I know that Deliverance will finally be found in his grace and his mercy so that the children of God will never be without the Deliverance of God why cuz his mercy endureth forever amen oh do you believe it friends we should Rejoice we should be happy we should be free because his Mercy Mery endureth forever let's just bow our heads together oh Heavenly Father God we need you Lord God we have been sown into sin we have come forth from the womb corrupted born wrong even beyond that Lord when we had opportunity we did wrong I'm sorry Lord pray you forgive me and I pray you forgive your people that are standing before me Lord God you told us if we would repent of our sins forsake them you be faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness oh God would you pour your healing bomb into our wounds now God in a congregation this size there's no there's no doubt there's a number of individuals who have been wounded by their own failure who have deep scars and wounds not just their own wounds they've wounded others wounded family members and children and spouses parents Brothers and Sisters in Christ God forgive us forgive us Lord we acknowledge we don't deserve when it comes to deserving we don't deserve anything but pain and suffering and scars and humiliation we don't deserve anything but God we're not looking at that we're looking at your promise we're looking at your great love that provided a lamb before there was a failure God I believe you provided that lamb for me God I believe you knew that be the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world to cover for all my sins God I come to you now and I ask that you would bring a supernatural healing by your grace and mercy that you'd bring a Deliverance Lord there's people in here that no doubt are bound some way to sin Bound in an addiction Bound in a habit bound some way because they transgressed your word there may be families that are afflicted Lord and have uh are bound some way because they transgressed your word relationships may be under tension because of transgressing your word but God we have nothing to say for ourselves but we're guilty we're ashamed and we're sorry but God for every one of those situations would your grace and mercy Lord extend your blood would you wash by the washing of the water of the word the bleeding word that you've given us in this day and would you heal and would you restore and would you bless Lord God I thank you for your goodness bring your grace in abundantly in our lives Lord and help us to live differently than we've ever lived before let your spirit come upon us Lord and bring us Lord not into the repetition of failure but by your spirit may we heed to your spirit and yield to your spirit surrender to your word may you bring us into a higher life walking a different path God we're completely dependent upon you we're asking you to supply our needs Lord Heal us and Deliver Us by your great grace God if there's any here who've never received that pardon for the first time or maybe there's a barrier in their life they're afraid to commit they're afraid to surrender maybe they know that they're wrong and they're outside of your economy and they're separated from your life whether young or whether old I pray you'd go to them now and give them the courage to run to run to a father that loves them to run to a savior that's already made a provision before the life of failure before the sin may they recognize that you already have a plan for their life to heal to redeem to restore God if there's none who's accepted your pardon and received your salvation by grace I pray God that they would do so now that they would open their heart and they'd move past the barrier of past they move beyond the barrier of failure beyond the barrier of not being good enough enough beyond the fear of not being able to live the life may they move beyond all of that and just come running to you with their hand in the air and saying oh God I need your salvation I need your mercy I need your grace God I pray that you bless every young person every older one God you've made every provision we need in this life and in this end time you've given us abundantly we don't have to live below our privileges we don't have to stay bound and shattered and broken because you have sent a balb in Gilead to heal to restore to mend the broken places I pray God that you would allow us to open our hearts to receive it Lord to be honest with you to be open and allow you Lord to change our lives to heal us and to restore Us by your grace do a supernatural work amongst us Lord by your mercy and Grace Deliver us from our self and icted pain Deliver Us Lord from the consequences of our Rebellion Deliver Us oh God and restore us for your great grace sake and for your name's sake for you have called us a people after Your Name Lord Lift us up Lord bring us out of the myy clay Lift us out of the pit and restore us oh God and heal

Jesus Christ's name we pray bless your people God let them leave here let nobody leave here the same God there's no reason there's no reason they have to walk out of these doors the same way they came in cuz you made a provision God you've told us of your love and your mercy and your grace Lord I pray God you would send the agent of your Holy Spirit to every heart and that you would Quicken the
