TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women listen before this visitation of the angel she did not know she was highly favored and she didn't know she was blessed among women she didn't know who she was i mean like she knew who she was but she didn't know who she was like she knew her birth record and she probably could go back a few generations and she knew the city she lived in and the name they called her and you know the house that she dwelt in she knew who she was but she didn't know who she was it took the visitation of an angel with a message from god to awaken her to who she really was by calling her hey hey you know you're highly favored and you're blessed arthel among women you know the first time she heard that i'm sure she was a little startled and she might have been like you're talking to me brother branham in the first seal he looks at a group of people and he says i'm going to i'm no longer going to call you church but i'm going to call you brides so that you'll understand there was a group of people there and some may have been they'd all rejoice some may have understood some didn't but when i heard the tape something called me bride amen amen and it wasn't the man from kentucky amen it was the voice behind that man that was saying i'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand that this prophecy is for you amen amen had to come to mary so she would know this prophecy is for you and you have to know that you're the bride to know that these prophecies in the end time are for you you have to know who you are amen not not the birth record not going back a few generations not being able to say i live here my address isn't here you can send me mail here my phone number here that's not the true identity but the true identity is coming through the messenger of the age he's here to tell you i'm not going to call you church anymore because we're done with churches this is right now with the preaching of the seals we're finishing the dispensation of churches amen and we're moving into the dispensation of bride so i'm going to call you no longer church but i'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand this prophecy is for you and it's for now [Applause] because if i'm going to continue calling you church like i did through the church ages you'll not understand you'll you'll hear me preaching the seals you'll hear me talking about the lamb taking the book but if we're still in the church ages we're still under church dispensation you won't know you'll still be thinking future future future but i've got to come and give you your true identity so that you know you're the bride this is the time now all these scriptures are culminating today i no longer call you church i will call you bride
