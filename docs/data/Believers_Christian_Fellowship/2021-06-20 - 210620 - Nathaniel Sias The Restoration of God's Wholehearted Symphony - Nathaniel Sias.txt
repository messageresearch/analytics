would be glorified in our lives not just in the four walls of this building lord we come to hear your word and to be encouraged but the effect lord is supposed to be at home it's supposed to be at work it's supposed to be in the middle of our trials for lord as your word takes root lord you begin to have an effect and you are glorified in our lives not just twice a week not just when we're feeling spiritual but all day every day lord i pray that for us today that we would have a greater vision as we go from this place god we take every spirit under our control lord that you might be glorified here in the few moments of fellowship that we have together that the words that would be spoken would be pleasing in your eyes that the words that would be spoken would be received in the hearts of your people for lord is you that quickens the word to be spoken it's also you that must quicken the word to be heard god be with us in a few minutes of fellowship we have and in jesus christ's name we commit our time into your hands amen praise the lord lord bless you saints it's wonderful to be together with you today amen it's been a little uh little season since we've been able to have some fellowship and you know it's such a wonderful thing to be able to see the saints that are still pressing on anybody had a trial recently amen we're getting shaped up for better things you know nothing is without purpose and nothing is by accident praise the lord we're going to take a look at a little thought here today or just uh by god's grace maybe not keep you too long but this little thought is a kind of a long title but i wanted to what was in my heart was to capture really the thought here and this is the restoration of god's wholehearted symphony i i you know much prefer to have a real as we would say a little snappy little title one or two words you know but sometimes we have to be specific and there's a lot of things that god is doing and we're at a time a season where maybe there was a time where it was okay to be a little off to the left a little off to the right but we're not in that season anymore god is calling for all things to be in such wonderful perfect order as we face our trials they're not trials anymore just an experience that we're going through that god would be glorified when we come to church it's no longer about fulfilling some sort of form it's about having a relationship with god having communion with god and when we're praying at home we come to church we come to a church service and we hear the the secret things that we were praying about at home spoken over the pulpit are those things really possible yes friends every time we come to a church service anything is possible anything is possible which means that today anything is possible if we can simply trust the author and the finisher of our faith to do the work from beginning to end and humble ourselves to his word all things will be in order better than we could possibly imagine praise the lord now i feel like my kids when we're at home when they experience a computer that doesn't have a touch screen they don't know what to do i think i might use the clicker here there we go beautiful so here's a few references for you today we'll read a scripture i have you be seated and then we'll bring this back up so you can make some notes if you like let's turn to psalm 111 if you would if you've got your bibles with you i want to say happy father's day to all the fathers here there are only a couple things in life that will make you grow like being a father or a mother you will grow in patience you will grow in temperance god designed it so you know and as we go through those times it's just a wonder as wonderful as a father as you see the little things that come out of your children you know all the mistakes that we make all day you know all the time we're always making little mistakes but you know it's the grace of god that brings the wonderful things out of our children because we can only do what we can do and like like the little boy that brought the fishes and the loaves we bring everything we have and then the lord multiplies it and sometimes we're teaching our children bible verses and we're praying with them and then suddenly you're not feeling well and it's your five-year-old that comes to you and says daddy can i pray with you see not all investments take a long time to come around it's wonderful to invest in the right things as a father as a mother praise the lord the lord is just so good let's read here in psalm 111 we're just going to read verse number one and i'll have you be seated psalm 111 verse number 1 praise ye the lord i will praise the lord with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation may the lord bless the word you may be seated i believe in for many of us maybe this is a familiar verse and it's kind of used in a specific context this is something that the lord has been dealing with me over the last probably a year and a half or two years is that many times we are familiar with scripture and we look at the scripture in a certain way in a certain light maybe we've been taught that maybe it's just our own perception we've read a verse and it kind of struck us a certain way and we form a picture in our mind and a lot of times it actually takes a lot of pressure that the lord will allow us to go through to begin to break the perceptions that we have of scripture because see god had it perfect in the beginning he hasn't changed his mind from that and we sometimes apply our own idea to the scripture no we don't do it intentionally so you might say to me well brother nathaniel we came out of the denomination we set our our mind aside we set all the denominational ideas aside but you know that's true and we praise the lord for that all that god has done but as we sit here today when we read a scripture there are certain things that come to mind as we read this scripture here there are certain things that come to mind and and we it is very easy to read that scripture and say well praise the lord that's about worship at the beginning of the service or the end of the service maybe that that scripture is specifically for musicians because it has a reference to praising the lord and it is these types of things that suddenly where god has spoken something that is profound we then put it in a box we don't intend to do it we don't mean to do it but we all do we're all in the same boat as i like to say we're all in the same boat bailing water you know we get some confident in ourselves right sometimes we think that we've got it figured out and again this is not about uh really being puffed up in pride they're just assumptions that we make because of experiences because of things that we've heard preached because of things again maybe we're praying we're reading in a scripture and it strikes us a certain way and maybe that was good for that season but then god comes along and he says see now you think you know that but now i want to open it to you in another way that you've never seen before and this as we begin to read the scripture and i encourage you saints as you go from here today if i can encourage you in anything let me encourage you in this that when you go home and begin to read your bible begin to read your bible like you've never read it before read every verse lay aside every thought you have and begin to read that verse when you listen to the message listen to the message as if you've never heard it before and suddenly the lord begins to open up brand new things that we thought well they're new to us but there they were all the time and that which we thought well yeah i'm kind of familiar with that part the lord begins to open it up and we begin to see how it now it doesn't just fit in a small way it begins to fit in the tapestry of god's time of god's timeline in this larger scene and this excuse me this one little verse can fit right into that picture and be a missing piece and without it things don't connect this is the the sincerity and the honesty and this the simplicity that we want to look at the scriptures so here is a a few things that brother brandon was referring to a couple pictures that he gave us um here in uh look in shalom look shalom and then the world is falling excuse me the falling apart of the world there's a couple references he makes here we're not going to pull extensively from here as far as coding up on the screen but there's some of the thoughts that are in the this this message today are coming from these messages so if you want to make a note they're very encouraging if you're not familiar with them already but even if you are familiar with them i encourage you to go back and listen wonderful saints the mind cannot conceive the things that god has in store still well brother we've got a wonderful revelation praise the lord there's more this isn't stagnant it's not over yet things are still getting sweeter they're getting deeper they're getting more profound they're getting so personal that at home you can just have a conversation looking at what god has done praise the lord and when you begin to worship it's not about well i'm gonna worship for a half hour be before the preaching on wednesday and i'm gonna i'm gonna praise the lord for a half hour before the the preaching on sunday and then maybe maybe 20 or 30 minutes after the service so i've got two hours of praise every week oh my we've already put god in such a tiny little box he's worthy of praise from the moment that we wake up to the the moment that we lay our head on the pillow at night every moment of every day he is worthy for us to praise him for all that he is and with all that we have and i don't mean 99.99 100 he's worthy of it all the whole heart let's go to if you would joel the second chapter i realized that many people are traveling today and sometimes that can be discouraging to us because we look around and we say well so-and-so is not here and so and so is not here the scripture still says where two or three are gathered so don't let that take your mind or discourage you or pull you down today my god is so good so we're going to hit a couple points here and then by god's grace try to bring this together and you know it's been quite a while since i've had to fight so much for a sermon this last couple days there's many things going on and i would love to have spent a couple days and just kind of kind of set aside and be quiet but unfortunately in today's world we don't have that you know by god's grace have a little time here and a little time there and you know it really does just remind us that we have to trust the lord when we stand behind this this holy desk here you know we can't figure everything out you know as a minister we're not at home practice practicing our sermons in the mirror well now at this point we're going to say this at this point we're going to say that no we got to show up and trust the lord and truly saints as we come to listen [Music] when we sit in an audience such as this this is no lesser for you to be sitting in that seat right there that's no lesser of a role than standing up here don't forget that you are what this is about this is god's intent is you all of this is about you let's read here in joel the second chapter verse number 25 and i will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten and the canker worm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you you shall eat and plenty be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed again many of us may be familiar with this verse there is a law in christ that law is in men you can bury him in the deepest grave or the deepest sea or the lowest hell there's a law of the spirit of god that will raise him up again see okay well it's a law no matter what happens no matter what we can say the words but when god makes that real to us it changes us entirely no matter what there is nothing that can change the law of life when god planted a seed and sent it into the world that seed of him that seed has no option we serve god god put us in this world and he does not overcome free will here we we he he brings us uh the the message is presented to us his word is presented to us we have a decision to make we make the decision but god knew the decision that we would make he knew who we were he knew the character that was in that seed and he knew what the character would do but god set it in order he sent the seed there and there is a law that governs the seed no matter what the situation no matter how big the circumstances of the world no matter how loud the devil gets no matter how how crazy the world gets no matter how low the morality of the world it doesn't change the law of life it doesn't matter throughout the church ages it didn't matter how much the devil attempted to corrupt that which god was working it didn't change it no did it hinder into the work well god had already said this was going to take place so as brother branham says of jonah we look at jonah and say well jonah you know he just had a weak moment and brother brandon says now let me take up for jonah because even when jonah was in what we would think is a bad state he was in the perfect will of god because god had set in motion something that would come to pass at the designated time and here we are going to the world and we get the woe is me's we get the woe is this and what was that and what was covent and what was politics and what was that but the law of life has not changed when god planted life life must come up we used a very simple example if you've got a pear tree and you plant the the pear what must come up well the same is true of an apple seed but if we plant a a tree of life what must come up if we plant a tree of knowledge of good and evil what must come up and we want to focus on this just for a moment to understand this is not optional it's not optional what's going to come next because it's a law of god it is an absolute god said this is the law it is a law of life it is a law that when the devil tries to destroy that the law of life will restore and it's not optional no matter what the devil tries to present it's not an option i'm emphasizing this for a reason that we will know an absolute it is not negotiable it is not a 99 chance it's a hundred every time god's law of life will overcome everything that the devil puts in front of it every piece of death every corruption it will be overcome by the law of life you are made and born placed here in the body of christ as sons and daughters of god you don't have to knock down to the devil or knuckle down to the devil we've got a law that's the law of the holy spirit the only thing you know have to do is know how to let go and let god you keep fighting at it see and it won't never work when you let go and let god that's all simple principle right let go and let god and yet what do we struggle with every day that's what we struggle with every single day well brother i've got this trial and i've got that trial and i've got this situation i've got that situation the only challenge was talking with several brothers who was very encouraged the last couple of days we're talking about this very thing the thing we're struggling with is not the trial see when you have faith in god when you know what the outcome is going to be people will look at you and say oh you're just blind you have blind faith i don't have blind faith the faith has given me eyes to see not only the situation but what is beyond the situation i know what the outcome is and if i know what the outcome is it will direct what i'm doing right now i know where i'm headed i know what's going to come next and i'm not shaken today because i know what the outcome is i know what the outcome is and i'm trusting god to get me from here to there it's a simple thing but we struggle with it every day and you know i pray that no one has a a religious spirit say well brother you know i have arrived we have not all arrived we are arriving we're in the season of arriving we're getting to that place god is calling us we're in a season of finishing but not all is done yet oh god has spoken it and it's moving you know when the creator spoke he spoke things into existence and the molecules began to move or maybe we didn't see it maybe we don't see what god is doing but it's happening god is doing it brother branham gave us the example of john when he got discouraged and he's in prison john's in prison he's been preaching and they were god had given him victory and he was able to face the pharisees and and preach his message that god was at hand that the son of god was at hand now john's in prison brother branham says his prophetic eye got filmed over so john sent some of his disciples to talk to jesus and they come to jesus and they say john wants to know are you he jesus didn't say here's a pamphlet jesus didn't say you know go study the old testament for a couple years and come back and talk to me he said come see we've got a church service tonight come see come see today what's relevant what's present what's alive today and it will provide the evidence that you're looking for john got a little discouraged as brother branham said he got discouraged thinking that the word was not working but the word was working now let's go on oh if we could just think of it about that for a minute forces it regardless of conditions brother random is talking about the resurrection he's talking about life he says the the the devil the evil the darkness is trying to push against it but the law of life is not asking permission again we continue to emphasize this because the absoluteness of god's victory the absoluteness of god's victory must be something so personal and simple it just is what does one plus one equal whatever god wants it to equal you know when peter looked at the water he looked at the water and peter didn't say you know i know hydrodynamics and it is not physically possible to walk in the water but maybe in this case the salinity is extremely high and maybe the water is just extra shallow here when they saw jesus they were surprised they thought he was a ghost it wasn't normal there was something abnormal about the situation and in that abnormal situation peter stepped out he began to walk and we know what happens next but we want to focus on that moment when peter looks at a situation that should not be rational and he steps out anyway oh if we could just think of it for a minute forces it regardless of conditions we're not looking at conditions for evidence the only evidence we have that we need is god's word let's go to first samuel 16. now we've laid a bit of a foundation but god's grace allow us to now focus in on our thoughts for today praise the lord jesus now we've laid that bit of foundation because that's very important a little bit later on here as we get down to bringing things together but we want to establish those pieces so that god will anoint them and bring them together first samuel 16 now let's read verses 16 to 23. let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player on the harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that it shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well and saul said unto the servants provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me sounds like a good idea then answered one of the servants that said behold i have seen the son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning and playing and mighty of a mighty valiant man and a man of war prudent in matters and a calmly person and the lord is with him wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me david thy son which is with the sheep and jesse took an ass laden with bread and bottle of wine and a kid and sent them with david his son unto saul and david came to saul and stood before him and loved him greatly and he became his armor-bearer and saul sent to jesse saying let david i pray thee stand before me for he hath found favor in my sight and it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was upon saul that david took a harp and played with his hand so saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him this is from 1955 the great warrior david shame on you people that don't believe in string music no wonder evil spirits never like it they have to get away david cast out devils by playing on his string instrument that's what the scripture says that's right and when david would begin to play the evil spirit would leave saul is that right now we see that david played for the lord how do we know he played for the lord because the devil didn't like it the evil spirits didn't like what david was doing he would begin to play and the evil spirits got uncomfortable and they left so now we want to take for a little picture today we've looked at a restoration there's a law of restoration that god is doing something in the day that we're living in we many of us may be very familiar with that and and comfortable with that is something that's very precious in our hearts but again we just want to reiterate and lay that foundation for what we're going to look at now david had confidence in this he'd had experience he knew the lion and the bear he had these experiences and now he's before saul and he begins to play and there's a sweetness that comes and it drives the evil spirit away now we want to take for a subject or look at this picture today that the the day and the age that we're living in we know that the devil has done all these things in the world but we're going to set the devil aside for a little bit and now focus on what god's intent is for us you see when god's design when god's order is set in motion the devil doesn't have a choice the only thing we have to do is be ordered before god that's all we have to do as god intended now when we think order we think law we think rules that's not what we're referring to we're talking about the whole order of god all of it it's more than rules it's more than just pla uh doing everything in a precise way and say look at me i'm i'm a i'm a real christian it's about all of it the living word of god in your life in my life every day not twice a twice a week religion as we mentioned earlier but where are god's instruments today you see to be a a musician what happens in your fingers what you're playing what comes in your mouth if you're singing is what's in your heart what's in your heart comes out out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks so we're going to take a little bigger picture today instead of looking at an instrument in the way that we think we've got a piano we've got an organ we've got guitars instead of thinking of an instrument that way let's take a step back and look at god let's look at god and all of his glory what music does he like what is god looking for in this age in his people there's an instrument here there's instruments here there's instruments here there's instruments here there's instruments here god has created his children each one with a special place a special ability and if you see an orchestra do all of the instruments look the same no you got one that sings high and one that sings low ones on this side over here one's on this side over here you see the way that god intended is that each each of his children from the inside to the outside begins to resonate with something from the inside something that's on the inside begins to make that life put out something something is happening on the inside where are god's instruments what notes are to be played well praise the lord i am an instrument of god amen then i'm going to serve god in whatever way i choose no not what god intended you see god gave us sheet music and it's really detailed you know it's so detailed that you can't even play it by yourself you there is no way you can play every single note you need each of the instruments that god made all of them throughout all of god's creation throughout all of time when god set things in motion in the garden everything was in order god was had said everything as he had placed it to be and everything began to move together adam had his place when eve was expressed before the fall here is now eve she has her place you know the wonderful thing about music there is something called a melody and the melody line is the main line it's the line that we would normally be singing in a in a church service but if you just take a melody line and you just sing the melody line it doesn't have as much meaning as when you add harmony what is a harmony it's a note that is reflecting it's related to that melody but as you begin to add the other parts to the music the melody gets sweeter the meaning of the melody begins to come out and everything in the garden was right on cue before the fall everything was there everything was in perfect harmony the notes everything was in tune everything was in perfect time everything was moving as god had designed it now we know of course what comes next we know the fall that happens in the garden and time goes on and satan is now he believes that he's now destroyed the beauty the synchrony the the elegance of what god had designed satan thought that he had quieted god's music he thought that he had quieted the symphony of god's work you see these instruments of god have fallen they can no longer produce the music that they used to produce what a discouraging moment it seems so discouraging it seems so discouraging that at this time the beautif the beauty and the perfection of what god had designed is now not moving the way that god originally designed it but you know as we look at that it's easy to stay in that place it's easy to stay in a place of discouragement it's easy to look around at life and you look at those that have have maybe walked away from the lord they've given up and we get so discouraged and we get depressed and you'll find that your faith begins to weaken you find that your mind begins to be drawn down but remember the law of life we hit sometimes a moment in life where things are not flowing in harmony the way that we see that they should be but remember the law of life what god began as much as satan is trying to destroy god will bring all things back into order it's not accidental well maybe god was surprised no you see god had already written the sheet music god already knew the beginning he knew the middle part he knew every little change that was going to happen in between and he knew the end of it he knew the crescendo he knew the finale the crescendo is when things build to the end and the finale it is the finish god knew all of these things he's not surprised but he created his children to resonate to sing well well brother you know i'm not much of a singer but what about your life what about the things that you're doing every day well brother i'm you know i'm not a musician and i just have my little part but you know that every little part of the symphony is important it's adding meaning to the sound it's adding meaning to what is being expressed what if the drum says you know you know in an orchestra they got the big drum in the back that's beating the time as maybe you're marching or it's keeping everything in order and the drum is saying you know i want a solo boom boom boom boom boom boom but you're not made for that purpose you're made to keep time and then maybe the maybe the the cello says you know i really want to play the violins part i really love the violin i love how it just is so clear and it projects so beautifully and you know the violins always get the solo parts i'm a cello but i really want to be a violin but that cello was not made to reach into that octave it's not made to reach where the violin is playing but if the cello will realize the instrument will realize that the part it's playing is complimenting the violin that the instrument over here is complementing the instrument over here and that together it is now expressing the harmony of god as god intended you know so many times we want a solo part oh i want to stand out there and i want the lights to be on me and i want everyone to look at me and say that's a real christian come on it's his spirit floats around sometimes get on us we all know this you remember my brother ma'am said you can't stop the bird from flying over but you can stop them from making a nest it's not that we never have a thought sometimes we come to church and say well you know i'm just everything is in order and this is everything is perfect but you know at home you know i'm up here preaching today and yesterday our our 11 month old was screaming the whole day he's 11 months old what am i what are we going to say to him i mean you kind of correct him as much as you can in 11 months but i can't sit down with my 11 month old and say now caleb now now you know all you need to do is talk because brother bannon gives us the example he said now you get real modern parents they're gonna they're gonna have their baby they say now we're modern parents and we've got it all figured out now baby now when you need something you just ring a bell oh come on and we listen to that and when and we get frustrated in ourselves sometimes as you know as fathers you know i think the beauty for me personally what is overwhelming to me the beauty is not that we all look perfect in what the world thinks is perfect the beauty is when god is bringing out of imperfection perfection it's beautiful because god is doing the work we can't get the glory for it and we're certainly not going to walk around like we never have a challenge or a trial but it's in the trial that god is glorified praise the lord what notes are to be played the sheet music is right here it's all written down it's already written do you know that you can't play if you want to be part of god's symphony you can't play notes that are not on these pages if you do you're cursed we can't friends if we're a child of god we can't sit down and say you know what do i feel like doing today you ever hear you ever hear someone be really out of order or not pay attention when they're playing an instrument someone following a asleep playing an instrument they don't realize that the whole world can hear what you're doing right well i you know i really want to play an instrument you know it takes a lot of work it takes a lot of dedication it takes a lot of sacrifice sometimes it's very painful i never thought about that i had a guitar one time that was the hardest thing to play it sounded good but boy it was hard to play i'd be halfway through a song service and my hand is just going numb and i'm just holding on and sweating we don't think about that sometimes it's hard to hold on but when i get past that and god bless me i came to service on a on a wednesday one day there was a beautiful brand new guitar sitting there for me somebody gave me a brand new beautiful taylor guitar you know what i really appreciate that guitar my hands don't hurt see we go through that time and god blesses us with another season and suddenly we don't have the strain that we had before and we can play clearer notes because of it our lives can play clearer notes because of where we've been the sheet music when and how is the music to be played oh this is a big question this is a very big question now in an orchestra there's one who orchestrates there is one who brings everybody together and makes sure that everyone's on the same page at the same time and they're doing the same thing at the same time now listen the conductor does not replace the sheet music the sheet music is still there now if we're i don't know if you've ever seen this before but in an orchestra you've got your sheet music see if i can balance this here i think it's gonna yeah okay we've got our sheet music and when you're playing an orchestra there's one that you're looking at the whole time and you look from that one to the sheet music look from that one to the sheet music look from that one to the sheet music and you know what happens when you get to know the sheet music so well you just keep looking at the conductor he's the one that's orchestrating he's the one that's at the time when he comes up then you come up and when he comes down then you come down and when he says to stop then you stop and if we have to move to the left we move to the left we move to the right we move to the right why because he's directing as it becomes personal as the sheep music becomes part of us we're watching the conductor yes lord yes lord what do you want me to do do you know that every conductor in the world is different in the natural sense in the natural sense when a conductor is conducting an orchestra the reason why some conductors are very high acclaimed and they're they're uh they're really sought after is because of the way they interpret the music you see not everyone can read the sheep music number one you have to have some ability to look at the sheet music and read it and second when you're some people have a gift when they read the sheet music they begin to feel the music and as they begin to feel the music it's what they feel that they're trying to express to the orchestra see they're reading from the pages they're getting something but to them it's alive it's a living thing they begin to hear the movements they're beginning to hear the the crescendo and the decrescendo as it goes up and it comes down it gets louder and it gets softer they begin to hear it they begin to feel the timing of it this note goes right here and this note goes right here hey a section over here i'm not pointing to anybody in the building this section over here let me point uh all the way over this section over here you're out of time let's stop stop stop let's practice that again you know and sometimes people are sitting in the orchestra i was in the orchestra as violin was my first instrument that i began to play and there were times when my bow did not touch the strings i was just going through the motions because it wasn't personal to me you know and you can you can fudge it you can make it look like you're playing a law you're playing at the same motion you're looking at the person next to you oh yeah yeah right in order oh i'm right in order but if you silence everything else and listen to what you're doing it's not an order and the conductor this conductor can hear every note he can hear everything and when one note is out you get the look you know what the look is you know you get the look you know we say of course we say that in humor but has anyone ever felt that from the lord you do something that was out of order you said oh brother branham said he did that once and he felt like he'd rob something from a baby you know that feeling oh something's not right there was a note that was out of order when and how is the music to be played see it's the conductor that's setting everything in order it's the the interpretation that the conductor sees when he's motioning he's bringing the orchestra together that everything plays together not all separate you see the season that we're in now it's not about you know us doing our little thing here and us doing a little thing here and us doing a little thing here one's praying one's fasting so that another one can go pray for the sick all things in order body ministering to the body well brother you know i want that solo part if you understand that every part is absolutely essential there is no greater there is no lesser there is no big eyes and little use there is none of that there is no respecter of persons if you are called to play some certain notes play those notes but get them right whatever the notes are my when sometimes we play with musicians we say this many many many times simplify simplify simplify music is one of the easiest things to see where pride comes out because pride will cause us to do all kinds of things that we probably shouldn't do and i'm not picking on musicians friends you might think this is all about music this isn't about music we're making this as a a parallel of course to what we are experiencing spiritually as i was praying about this i probably have i don't know five ten pages of notes things that brother branham was saying i'm looking at all these notes i said you know lord i know if we go through this as a bible study it's weary as we're trying to see the elegance of what god is doing because what god wants us to see is the whole picture no longer one part over here no longer one part over here but the whole tapestry the whole perfection of what god is presenting to us certainly not to disregard it there's i love doing uh uh teaching and preaching and going through ever for detail going through the message i want us to have a foundation i want to have a foundation i want to know what the prophet said i want to know what the scripture says and sometimes we get so so much that we we say well i don't i don't know where to look it's so good and it's so big and so by god's grace today the lord just give us a little picture that we can see how the pieces are supposed to fit together not separate how many churches how many true churches are there in the world just one just one we have fellowships we have assemblies but they're not the church of god the called out the true church of god is wherever the elector gathered it is wherever god has chosen to sound a note and you may not be able to hear all of the notes but in god's ears he's listening and says ah yes see my children are learning the sweetness of playing their parts my that's so wonderful now let's go to luke the first chapter look at that my bible stayed up there the whole time luke 1 and 17 raise the lord jesus luke 1 and 17 we'll just read the one verse here and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias that is to say elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children of the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make a make ready a people prepared for the lord now i want to we read this scripture again familiar verse well elijah's going to come and restore all that had been lost same as as was referring to in joel all that the worms had eaten it's all going to be restored and we can say with confidence from what the conductor has told us through the prophet here in the age that we live and we say well who is the conductor is it is it the prophet or is it god well it's god through the prophet that's the conductor god is conducting in the age and he's setting the time and the age and it's the prophet it's it's the the ear that god has and he speaks directly to the prophet and only the prophet can say see this scripture here see these notes here this today is that only the prophet can say that no one else has the right to say that this this scripture here is this day right now this day the scripture is fulfilled only the prophet can say that that's what his responsibility is god will restore we want to focus on this one element god will restore let's read this again just to make sure we focus on this correctly here he shall go before them in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children this is of course the pentecostal fathers there is a greater restoration this this restoration back to the book of acts this has already taken place and there's something greater even that's that's taking place restoration to eden as brother branham said all that atom loss has been restored a great restoration but as we look at this particular verse here what we're seeing is that there is a restoration there is a refocus that must take place so i ask you today what was lost something about the heart was lost because god said i will turn the hearts back too you see the heart was focused on something else but god had to restore the hearts back too pressure god had to restore the hearts back to anyone ever feel any pressure recently in the world well don't be too shy now so much pressure in the world and i want to put it to you like this today by god's grace you know i've tuned many a guitar and tuned violins and there's times when you're tuning up that instrument and it gets right getting close to being in tune you know what you experience you're plucking the string and it's getting close and you're going you're turning it up turn it up and you don't want it to break you know sometimes the pressure on us gets so much that we feel like we're going to break we feel like something in us is going to break we feel like at times the lord how is this fair lord how is it that this that life is so painful we feel like the pressure is getting tighter something in us is just getting wound tighter and tighter and tighter but you know if instrument sits there for a while it loses with the temperature changes and everything that's going on in the world that conditions in the world it begins to lose its pitch it gets out of tune and god permits pressure to come along god permits pressure yes more precious than gold because you might feel like things are tightening up inside of you lord i just don't know where this is going to go lord i don't know how this is going to turn out right and the lord is allowing you to be tightened and tighten some more and tighten some more because if the instrument is never tuned it can never play the correct notes and something is happening in the world that we're living in right now the world is feeling pressure and god's children are feeling pressure and there's a pressure down on the inside when we look around and we see corruption in the world oh lord jesus how long how long what must we see the corruption lord how far must this go and all the while god is tightening tightening tightening but when it gets just to the right amount of tension you pluck the string and it just begins to sing a sweet note not just one string all of the strings all of the attributes all of the the elements that are inside of us we get all out of sorts and we get this is loose and that's loose and our lives just kind of get uh what we're producing is not in tune but god says oh we need some pressure lord i don't want another trial but we're out of tune and god begins to tune us up and by god's grace as soon as we're in tune now something begins to play praise the lord i've never seen that before lord i've been praying about that for 10 years 15 years and suddenly it's just done tightening and tightening and tightening what is god doing he's tuning up his church the prophet told us that it's pressure that we'll bring out of the church what needs to come out it's pressure does any of us like pressure no we don't like the pressure but when the strings begin to sing just right well lord i i've you know i appreciate this victory in my life but now where do i fit in all of it just serve the lord with all your heart your mind and soul amen and god will place you where you need to be in the orchestra remember the cello can't play the violin part the oboe can't play the trumpet part and sometimes you've got the wind section i think this is all the preachers us preachers sometimes we got a lot of wind and sometimes we talk a lot but we don't say enough sometimes brothers and uh brothers i won't say brothers and sisters but brothers brothers sometimes we need to pray and say less speak less and say more i should say because when we're doing our part we will see the effect the saints come closer together the harmony gets tighter do you know who has the best harmony maybe maybe you've never heard this or maybe not aware of it but you know the people that can sing together the best have the most beautiful harmony our families because they say all their words the same they have the same accent they have the same way of shaping their words and they sing together and it just comes together so beautifully but friends we're supposed to be a family the words that we speak here and speak and speak and speak we're supposed to be expressing them the same way so that when all is brought together in harmony it's perfect the sweetest sounds the sweetest things that god wants to express how do we get there oh there's all this pressure i'm feeling pressure i'm feeling pressure and it's incredible the amount of pressure that an instrument can take do you know why because the instrument that little violin as small as it may be it's designed to handle that pressure it's designed perfectly to handle the pressure and under pressure is when it makes its sweetest sound praise the lord jesus that's exactly what i want to be at i don't care what pressure it is friends i pray that from the bottom of your heart trust the one that made you trust the one that's tuning us up and it might feel like such a pressure that we're going to break but god made the vessel god made the instrument to play the sound and he's the one that's orchestrating he knows exactly what each part is supposed to be played praise the lord and you might feel like you're all alone but friends you're not alone just keep on serving god with your whole heart give him everything pressure we've already spoken about this a little bit to each a different part to play we can't do the same part as our brothers and brothers and sisters in africa or india or china we're playing in a different location god called us to be here so god let me serve if you call me to to live here in lima then let me live the life of of christ to the fullest extent in the age that i'm called to live in let me get the timing right let me get the notes right let me get everything in order the the world might hear that music that god is beginning to play and they look at that music and they say well that's not what i want where did that come from where did that music come from but when god is doing something there is in incredible situations where it seems like everything in the world is literally falling apart around us in the midst of it when god begins to move you will see when god steps in that everything begins to happen on a rhythm maybe you've never seen that before maybe maybe you just haven't seen it maybe your experience did not recognize it but when god begins to move everything happens in a perfect order in perfect time things that seem impossible this has to happen this has to happen how is it going to happen and god steps in and in perfect order it begins to unfold how do we do that how do we always play the part that we are called to play my missing the sheet music you know what we would call a person like this truly in spiritual terms missing the sheet music is a fanatic well brother or sister i follow the spirit of god well do you because what you're doing is not in sync with the conductor and it's not in sync with the sheet music but god told me nope no he didn't god won't contradict his own word and if it's contrary to his word god didn't say it wow that sounds a little too straight doesn't it that's the truth of it if it's not in the sheet music it's not god and if we can submit ourselves to the sheet music and we're not running around following emotion after this following this what we feel like is an inspiration after this but stay with the sheet music you know what the conductor brings when he's really getting expressive do you know what he is he is letting the orchestra know what dynamics to play at any certain time mechanics we got the we've got the sheet music we got it right yep yep i know the sheet music then we got the person that doesn't know the sheet music and they're wanting to do this they want to do that friend you may love the lord but if you really love the lord you're going to love his word every part of it every part beginning to end all the sheet music because every movement is expressing something more everything that god is expressing in the age that we're living in right now we're watching change after change after change and the beauty of the whole symphony is opening before us praise the lord there was never an age that gets to see what we are seeing today we are getting to witness the symphony from the beginning of time to the end of time the whole beauty of all that god has orchestrated it's overwhelming overwhelming some are missing the sheet music and some are ignoring the conductor well brother who are you talking about this is a general truth it's between you and god to sort out if you're on any end of the spectrum you must sort it out the bible says make your calling an election sure pastor can't do that for you preacher can't do that for you you must seek it out with god you must look at the conductor and say am i or am i not in tune with the conductor and if i'm not in tune with the conductor if i'm not on time what's wrong with me that's a time of reflection that's the time to really dig deep and say lord i thought i was i thought i was doing my part and here i am playing the entirely wrong instrument i'm playing in the wrong key i'm playing the wrong part at the wrong time i got the right part i got the right notes i got them reading the sheet music that's right that's right that's right but we're totally out of time it must be in time the notes must be right the time must be right the sheet music must be right and the conductor must be front and center who's the conductor the holy ghost well brother you said it's the holy ghost through the prophet he's exactly right but the prophet right now is in the ground he's resting he's resting for his time to come up to be raised in the resurrection what now you know after brother banner passed away there was much confusion what do we do what do we do let's ask ourselves the same question today not in that same sense but in the general sense lord what do we do now what is the season that we're in right now not not two years ago not five years ago not 10 years ago right now in 2021 what now am i playing the right part right now friend as as the prophet told us we get to a turn we get up to a turn and we're not building a wall we're building a building and we get up to that corner and here we are going off the end of it because bro god brought us up to a corner and we did not catch when the conductor said it's time to change the tempo changed the tempo is the time my ignoring the conductor there are times when god made us who we are to be we had a experience with god maybe god did a work in us and we've started on this journey we've come a long way saints i don't know how long you've walked with the lord but i sure appreciate your testimony being serious and diligent before the lord sincere before the lord and just committing yourself to him in the day and age that we live in you know that being here in this building today is a victory the bible says that you see that day approaching gather together even the more and here we are scripture has been fulfilled scripture is being fulfilled the note is being played our lives are resonating but there are times when things happen in life the lord permits it maybe maybe we were getting tightened up we were under pressure we were getting tightened up you know the bible says he'll never put more on you than you can bear but there are times when we get to the point where we break a string it makes a terrible sound oh it's a terrible sound it broke a string who did that wasn't god god said he wouldn't put more on us than we could bear so how did something break inside of us who did that we did that we did that brother the devil did that no the devil can't do anything unless you permit him remember he has no authority over you the devil cannot force you to do anything the bible says we are tempted and led astray of our own lust sometimes something does break in us you know it's a terrible sound and if you put a violin up to your face and tighten it down and it breaks it could put your eye out it could be dangerous bad things can happen and now that instrument cannot play the notes it was designed to play and sometimes we we go through a situation like that i see where brother i you know i've been through a situation and to hurt me and i have such compassion for that we look at god we look at the kindness of god we look at what god is calling us to be we're looking at the beauty of his symphony if we can just catch a glimpse of that do we think that a god like that wants us to go on with a broken string god does not desire that and there are times when we were playing our part and maybe the devil put such pressure on us and we gave in to whatever the situation might have been and it broke a string and now here we are we're so hurt on the inside that we're so afraid that god will begin to pluck the strings we're afraid god i love you i'm reading the sheet music i'm reading the sheet music i'm watching the conductor but i just can't allow that lord with something in my heart it hurts too much i can't allow you to make my heart sing the way it used to i can't allow you to have absolutely free control in my heart because something hurts too much about a string broken i've have things that hurt in my heart and that harp is sitting in a corner oh i love the lord i'm reading the sheet music i'm reading the sheet music and i'm watching the conductor but lord i just can't make the sound i can't something's just not free in my heart the way it used to be something's bound up in me and lord i don't know how to be free and the instrument that god had designed is sitting there in a corner maybe coming to church service after service but friend if we can see today that the one that began the work gave us a law of life that that which all that the devil has tried to destroy and her in maine god gave us a law of life i have restored saith the lord all that was lost all that the devil is trying to sow all that the devil has tried to do i have overcome it you could say to me brother i hear you but brother it's been so long been so long since i felt the move of god in my heart i don't know what to do where do i start what do i do to allow god to tune me up and pluck my heartstrings again what can i do all things would be in such perfect order and tune that i would play my part exactly how god intended this is between you and god where do i start we already read this but now let's read it again you are made and born and placed here in the body of christ as sons and daughters of god you don't have to knock down to the devil we've got a law the law that's the law of the holy spirit the only thing you know have to do is to know how to let go and let god you keep fighting at it see it won't never work when you let go and let god that's all we've already read it you know what's amazing about a smaller instrument take a guitar for example and you put that guitar next to let's say a piano a grand piano do you know what happens to that guitar you can just hold it there just like this you can hold a guitar there in front of the piano do you know what that that guitar will begin to do when the piano is played the guitar will begin to resonate with the notes of the piano and you may say brother i don't know how to get from here to there but friend if you will spend time in the presence of the lord and allow your heart to open just spend time in his presence you don't need to explain it to god god already knows remember he made the instrument he made you who you are and made you for your purpose and when we spent time in the presence of the lord and he begins to sound those wonderful notes the word is being preached the notes begin to drop into our hearts and it begins to resonate let go and let god friends when we do that god begins to set things right that we didn't even know we're wrong we begin to resonate right in tune right along with what god is doing all things decently and in order many times we feel like that's such a a bondage i'm not saying that that again i don't know where anybody's heart is at but i know the perception i can feel the perception sometimes when i've spoken with people but people hear that and they think oh church order it's just a bondage it's not none of god's word to his children is bondage the pressure that we feel is not bondage god is tuning us up to set us in our place so that we can sing we can resonate we can be exactly what god designed and intended us to be but it requires the sheep music it requires our attention to be on the conductor and it requires god to play our lives in whatever way he desires because then this instrument begins to play and this instrument begins to play in this instrument in this instrument and we all by god's grace begin to play our little parts and the sweetest music begins to come out now what happened [Music] when david played before the lord there was an evil spirit and what happened when david played before the lord the evil spirit had to leave and we want to by god's grace expand this just a little bit because we think of an evil spirit a lot of times we we think that the spirit is right there and and you know a lot of times that's not true a lot of times the spirit has had an effect that an evil spirit has done damage and the damage is there and the spirit's not even there anymore and a lot of times we think that we're we're wrestling with the devil and we're not there's times maybe we are and we don't realize that but there are times when the devil is there the devil can't get into where you are maybe something happened and we're feeling the effect of something that the devil did we're feeling the effect of it but the devil's not there we're just carrying a scar we're carrying something that is causing us to shy away from the presence of god but if i can encourage you in anything today friends let go and let god and let god begin to pluck the heartstrings of your heart and when god does that when god is the one that's doing that and we're reading the sheet music we're watching the conductor and the music begins to play from our heart it might feel painful but even the effects of everything that the devil has done even the effect of it will begin to fade even the effect and the devil would love you to think that you can never be free of anything you can never be free well you just have to live with that for the rest of your life don't accept it if it's not absolute freedom it's not of god sometimes we settle we settle that we're only going to play one note we settle for you know maybe this is all that i can do let go and let god serve god with all your heart your mind and soul and whatever ever god has called you to do serve him give him your whole heart but continue to open your heart more and more and more and god will continue to play there are times as a musician you begin to play and you begin to play and you play for years and you say well you know i played this before i've had this practice before and all i do i just do these notes and i do these chord changes and i do this and i do this and i do this you know that's just all that i can do but you know sometimes friend if you just let go and begin to pray and you begin to allow yourself to be submitted to god you'll be surprised what comes out of your life as a musician if you do that and you just begin to pray and you begin to play you'll play notes as you've never played before god is the inspiration god is the one that we're looking to and as he begins to move in freedom in us every surface anything can happen anything can happen we set our expectations on what we've experienced but friends god is calling us to be in places that we've not yet experienced amen have we been translated from this world to another well by faith we know it oh we're living it we're we're watching it we're seeing it by faith we're caught up in heavenly places but the moment's going to come when this body is going to do something that's never done before how are we going to know that we know that we know that we're so settled oh you mean you mean we just play the next note yeah just play the next note oh the next note is step from here to there oh praise the lord you mean to tell me it's all over everything i i expected it to be this you know more of a pressure more of a push more of a push but i was just watching the conductor and i started to forget about the world and suddenly the conductor said play the next note and we play the next note oh that was it that was the final note that's all we need to do we make it complicated it's not print i encourage you if you're you've been a silent harp then just let god begin to work get in the presence of god and just spend time and allow god to begin to move in your heart again and begin to pluck those heartstrings the joy of your salvation the joy of the lord the pleasure of being a christian the pleasure of being in this world right now in the season that we're living in well that just seems contrary but we're listening to the music we're hearing the sympathy begin to play in its fullness and it's building building to the final moments what a joy let's all stand ask the musicians to come friends i pray that there's something that just settles in your heart the simplicity of it i know if we talk about musical terms that sometimes i can be confusing and i certainly don't mean for that to be but i pray that by god's grace a simple little picture of each instrument in their place each instrument beginning to resonate as it's supposed to the pressure getting cranked oh lord it's difficult it's difficult oh something just happened everything's in tune everything's on time maybe we had a little pluck here and a little pluck there you know i'm a cello and i want to be a violin but you know what god made me a cello praise the lord i'm just going to be a cello oh i i happen to love the show i love the violin and i love when everything comes together and you hear the beauty the beauty of god's intent you know when you hear when you hear a song let's say nearer my god to thee you hear a song like that and you hear someone sing it and you're thinking about the person that may be standing there in front of you maybe giving a song special or something to that effect and they're singing a song and you you feel wow praise the lord that really blessed me that maybe the spirit moved upon it and just just the moment it was the right thing for the right moment we hear that and we we think sometimes wow the song in that moment but we lose sight of the fact sometimes that the inspiration for the writing of the music came before and what we are singing is already written what we're singing what we're playing is already written it's written in the score it's written in the sheet music it's written already in god's order and as we begin to play it something about it is familiar when it's all at peace all things are in order all things are together let's sing this little song in moments like these [Music] i see [Music] if [Music] [Music] is [Music] gods [Music] me [Music] let's sing that again [Music] [Music] i singing [Music] god [Music] see [Music] now as the musicians just play that very softly [Music] let's bow our heads just for a moment [Music] see we need god to do the work that we cannot do we need to submit ourselves and let's do that just right now you know tomorrow is another day but for right now let us just submit ourselves to god and trust god for tomorrow let's bow our heads heavenly father god i pray that uh this little picture can begin to open [Music] we each have a part to play but lord we need you to set us there [Music] lord it's you that plays it's you that makes the music it's you that's the conductor it's you that is is the written word lord it's you that is the sheep music it's all you lord and god i pray that with one mind you will bring continue to bring the body together so lord that we begin to resonate as one sound that each in in harmony with the other as you designed it or we're not interested in playing politics or or trying to get everyone together by emotion god we're interested in you being in your greatness in control as we as as your children submit ourselves into your hand god i pray that you continue to heal us from the inside out lord that you can play the heartstrings to your fullest god that we will resonate and be exactly what you want us to be no more no less exactly what you want us to be [Music] let up pray lord you know all of the hurts and the pains that have happened over the years for each testimony that's standing here so many hurts but god i pray that in your tenderness [Music] you will soften our hearts not because we don't love you not because we don't want you but lord we've just been hurt by different things god i pray that you'll soften that just a personal thing lord between us and you [Music] god i pray that you'll play whatever song that you would choose in our lives and that it would be in perfect harmony with everything as you have said it to be [Music] god as we worship for a few moments have your way lord we also ask that you'll be with brother chad as he's been speaking this morning as he's traveling lord be with him our precious brother and god i pray that you'll be with each of the brothers around the world that are preaching this morning this afternoon whatever it may be there for lord we are one body not separate help us lord give us a deeper thirst that we pray one for another and god we ask that as you encourage those saints wherever they may be bring them through the trials of the current season covet has been very difficult for so many in health and stress but lord you're tuning us up that we can play our part [Music] lord we're looking for the final moments that we're so looking forward to it when you call us home and the whole choir can all sing together the whole orchestra can be heard singing your praises [Music] lord jesus we long for the day but lord here we are living out as you have set it in order so lord help us to be content in the season [Music] even as we look forward to what you have for us to come bless us we pray amen [Music] let's just sing this one more time i sing a song i see [Music] i lift up my head my hands too see me i love you [Music] i keep falling in love with you over and over and over over and over again oh [Music] really he gets sweeter and sweeter um [Music] oh over and over and over and over again sweeter as some things jesus i just want to [Music] jesus i just oh jesus i want to live the way he wants me [Music] [Music] oh let's sing it once more [Music] there's just [Music] because he lives i can face is [Music] [Applause] is [Music] i can face because all because [Music] isn't the lord jesus just so wonderful praise the lord it's been very wonderful to be with you today saints i would ask that you pray for pray for us as we pray for you the assembly there in moraine [Music] another assembly very close in sheffield all those saints up around cleveland keep us in prayer and we'll keep you in prayer just a few more moments friends [Music] we're really coming right up to those closing moments but the most exciting moments of the whole symphony is right at the end all the pressure may seem to be intense but it's just leading to that final moment [Music] trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding in all thy ways trust him acknowledge him and he shall direct that path [Music] as we bow our heads once more for a brief word of prayer pray for one another as you go pray for each other for the coming week that god will strengthen us to be a testimony to give us wisdom and guidance that we would play exactly the notes that he intends let us
