[0:00] Smur church age. He says in the
[0:02] Ephesians age and in this age and in
[0:04] every age we contemplate we will see
[0:07] that this is true and in the last age
[0:09] which is our age we will find the
[0:11] blackout of the word the complete
[0:14] apostasy ending in the great
[0:16] tribulation. So brother Bam tells us
[0:18] that when we get to the Leodysian church
[0:20] age there's going to be a complete
[0:22] blackout of the word.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; So what is light? The word. When it's
[0:28] blacked out, it becomes darkness.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; And in the last age, there'll be a
[0:33] complete blackout of the word. The
[0:35] complete apostasy ending in the great
[0:37] tribulation.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; That's where Leodysia is heading.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Complete blackout. Brother Brandham even
[0:44] looked in one place. He says, you know,
[0:45] I could see no light past 1977. It was
[0:48] all darkness.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he looked into the church,
[0:53] Amen. when he looked into the church in
[0:55] the Leodysian church age, it went into
[0:57] complete apostasy. And God verified
[1:00] this. Amen. At the at the end of uh I
[1:02] think it was the end of 1964. Amen. When
[1:05] he showed, Amen. an eclipse of the moon
[1:07] in the sky and put it in the papers
[1:08] across the nation. There was only six
[1:10] pictures. There wasn't a seven. And he
[1:12] showed that it typed Amen. the same
[1:14] image that he drew on the blackboard
[1:16] when he preached. Amen. The the seven
[1:18] church ages. The same image that was
[1:20] reflected by the pillar of fire on the
[1:21] back wall of BRANDHAM TABERNACLE. BUT
[1:23] NOW WHEN HE COMES TO 1964, HE SHOWS THAT
[1:27] NOW IT'S DIFFERENT. HE SAID, "I SHOWED
[1:28] YOU SEVEN with a little sliver of light.
[1:30] It reflected back on the back wall. But
[1:32] when God showed it in the heavens, there
[1:34] was no SEVENTH PICTURE BECAUSE IT WAS
[1:37] ALL BLACK. Completely black. No more
[1:39] light in the denominations."
[1:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; But I thought Zachchariah said it would
[1:46] be light in the evening time. It is
[1:48] light in the evening time. IT'S THE
[1:50] ABSOLUTE APOSTASY FOR DENOMINATIONAL
[1:52] SYSTEMS. APOSTASY FOR CHURCH SYSTEMS.
[1:54] AMEN. BUT FOR THE TRUE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:57] CHRIST, IT IS THE RISING OF THE SUN. IT
[1:59] IS THE DAWN OF A NEW DAY. IT IS THE
[2:01] LIGHT IN THE evening time. It depends ON
[2:04] WHICH SIDE OF THE EQUATION YOU'RE ON,
[2:05] WHETHER IT'S LIGHT OR DARKNESS.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I feel so privileged, so blessed,
[2:13] SO THANKFUL BY GOD TO HAVE EYES TO SEE
[2:15] AND EARS to hear. Amen. AND IN NO WAY
[2:18] DOES IT make me feel superior to another
[2:20] fellow human being. Listen, there's
[2:21] other human beings that I like better
[2:23] than I like me. There's others that are
[2:25] nicer and more congenial. Amen. Have
[2:27] better attitude than I have. Amen. But
[2:29] they can't SEE THE TRUTH. BUT I THANK
[2:31] GOD NO MATTER how reprobate I've been in
[2:33] the past and all my fo foibless AND ALL
[2:35] MY COMPLEXES. I STILL SEE THE LIGHT.
[2:38] AMEN. FOR ME, IT'S THE RISING OF THE
[2:40] SUN. IT'S NOT APOSTASY. IT'S NOT
[2:42] DARKNESS. IT'S NOT CONFUSION. BUT IT'S
[2:44] ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND LIGHT. I KNOW WHERE
[2:47] I'M WALKING. I KNOW WHERE I CAME FROM. I
[2:49] KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. BECAUSE WHEN THE
[2:50] LIGHT COMES UP, YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU'RE STILL SITTING IN
[2:56] CONFUSION, COME TO THE MESSAGE AND LET
[2:58] GOD OPEN YOUR EYES. CUZ IT'S THE LIGHT
[3:00] THAT SHOWS YOU WHERE YOU ARE, WHO YOU
[3:02] ARE, WHERE YOU CAME FROM, WHERE YOU'RE
[3:05] GOING. IT'S THIS LIGHT THAT REVEALS the
[3:07] path.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE CHURCH IS CONFUSION.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; The systems of man are confusion. The
[3:16] message is the light of the hour.
