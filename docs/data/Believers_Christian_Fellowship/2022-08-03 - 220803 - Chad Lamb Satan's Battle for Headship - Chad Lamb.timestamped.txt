[13:07] amen
[13:09] man god bless you while we're standing
[13:10] let's take our bibles and turn to
[13:12] genesis chapter one
[13:14] i'd like to take a moment to welcome
[13:16] brother anton god bless you brother
[13:17] anton he made it in on monday then a
[13:20] long time he's been gone for 15 years
[13:22] but it's really good to have him back he
[13:24] came in monday we've been having a good
[13:26] fellowship
[13:27] and
[13:28] as you can see yesterday him and i went
[13:30] fishing and i forgot my hat
[13:32] so
[13:34] the lord blessed us and we had a good
[13:35] time and and brother anton had to
[13:38] confess that he hadn't been fishing all
[13:39] year so i said he was a backslidden
[13:42] fisherman
[13:43] so he knelt by the side of the pawn and
[13:45] repented before we began fishing for and
[13:48] then the lord blessed us amen it was
[13:50] good we had a good time and so he'll be
[13:52] here until tuesday he'll be flying out
[13:54] tuesday he'll be traveling around the
[13:56] united states but he'll be coming back
[13:58] in early october to stay here i believe
[14:00] another 10 days so if you don't get a
[14:02] chance to fellowship with him now maybe
[14:04] on his return trip you'll get a chance
[14:05] uh we've certainly enjoyed it god bless
[14:07] you brother anton it's good to have you
[14:09] in the service amen
[14:12] amen let's uh look at genesis chapter 3
[14:16] verse 1.
[14:17] [Music]
[14:20] genesis 3 and 1
[14:22] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[14:24] beast of the field which the lord god
[14:26] had made and he said unto the woman yea
[14:28] hath god said you shall not eat of every
[14:30] tree of the garden
[14:32] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[14:34] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[14:36] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[14:38] which is in the midst of the garden god
[14:39] has said you should not eat of it
[14:41] neither shall you touch it lest you die
[14:44] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[14:46] shall not surely die
[14:48] for god doth know that in the day eat
[14:50] thereof then your eyes shall be open and
[14:52] you shall be as gods knowing good and
[14:54] evil
[14:55] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[14:56] good for food and that it was pleasant
[14:58] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[15:00] make one wise she took of the fruit
[15:03] thereof and did eat and gave also into
[15:05] her husband with her and he did eat
[15:07] and the eyes of them both were open and
[15:08] they knew that they were naked and they
[15:10] sewed fig leaves together and made
[15:12] themselves aprons and god bless you as
[15:15] you're seated and may lord bless us as
[15:18] we look into his word
[15:20] for a subject tonight i'd like to take a
[15:22] title satan's battle for headship
[15:25] satan's battle for headship
[15:27] and uh i was really stimulated by the
[15:30] service on sunday i was really blessed
[15:32] by the ministry
[15:34] that came through our brother kyle and
[15:36] it really edified me and while i was
[15:38] sitting there god was giving me some
[15:39] inspiration and i just jotted it down on
[15:41] a piece of paper and i slipped it in my
[15:43] bible and i thought i'll get to that
[15:45] down the road you know because i've been
[15:46] studying on another subject and and i've
[15:49] been wanting to get into this other
[15:51] subject amen but i just could not get
[15:53] away from that inspiration it kept
[15:55] coming back and back so i took that that
[15:57] paper out and started looking at that
[15:58] and the lord just began to bless us in a
[16:01] certain direction
[16:02] amen so so this was
[16:05] an inspiration that struck me during the
[16:07] service on sunday
[16:08] but as we look uh like i said
[16:11] the many times we preach there's nothing
[16:13] new but god is constantly giving us a
[16:15] clear vision amen constantly opening his
[16:17] word for us and we see here in the
[16:19] beginning that eve had the word and she
[16:22] was to keep the word and it was a simple
[16:25] commandment that she was to keep but
[16:27] that word was her protection and nothing
[16:30] could touch her she could not be defiled
[16:32] she could not fall
[16:34] nothing could happen to her as long as
[16:36] she stayed behind this word
[16:38] it wasn't complex it wasn't it wasn't
[16:41] complicated uh it was simple
[16:44] straightforward and if she would have
[16:46] stayed with them and when she stayed
[16:48] with the word the word were taking the
[16:51] preeminence in their lives and the word
[16:52] was taking headship the word was
[16:54] protecting the word was doing all of
[16:57] these things for them the word was doing
[16:59] it because the word is god
[17:01] so god was protecting them god was
[17:03] watching over him god was taking
[17:05] preeminence god was having headship he
[17:07] was having it as they
[17:10] obeyed his word amen
[17:12] so
[17:13] satan came and he had to get her out
[17:15] from under the word amen and he gave her
[17:18] another word and when she when she moved
[17:20] into another word amen she took another
[17:23] husband she took another headship amen
[17:26] because now this was a perverted word
[17:27] and she received the perverted word amen
[17:30] and it was the satan was trying to get
[17:33] dominion he was trying to get the
[17:35] headship he was trying to get
[17:36] preeminence so that he could work his
[17:38] plan
[17:40] god wants preeminence so god can work
[17:41] his plan satan wants preeminence so he
[17:44] can work his own plan
[17:46] amen
[17:48] so just to lay a foundation i want to
[17:50] read a couple quotes here in 1961
[17:53] revelation chapter 4 part 2. now the
[17:56] first throne was in heaven judgment seat
[17:58] the second throne was in christ the
[18:01] third throne is in man
[18:04] amen now we'll skip a paragraph come
[18:06] down one more now what is a man he's a
[18:09] triune being body soul and spirit how
[18:11] many knows that watch god's approach
[18:14] what is his heart you remember my
[18:16] message god chose a man's heart for his
[18:18] control tower the devil chose his head
[18:21] for his control tower see he makes him
[18:24] see things look through his eyes but god
[18:27] in his heart makes him believe things
[18:29] that he cannot see
[18:32] did he see god in his heart in the heart
[18:34] of man is the throne of god you get it
[18:36] man god made his throne in the heart of
[18:38] man
[18:39] now he says now satan tries to get him
[18:43] to see things but god gets them to
[18:45] believe things he can't see
[18:47] so god told them to stay away from this
[18:50] tree but satan told them that it wasn't
[18:53] exactly what god had said that there was
[18:55] some misunderstanding amen and when when
[18:58] god when satan began to entice the woman
[19:01] then she began to look at the tree and
[19:03] consider the tree and then she began to
[19:06] use her senses
[19:08] she began to look at the tree to see it
[19:10] was good for food that it was pleasant
[19:11] to the eyes desire want bull to make one
[19:14] wise she began to move into the realm of
[19:17] mental
[19:19] to reasoning and thought and and she was
[19:22] entertaining this idea amen because the
[19:25] devil chose to use the mind god chose to
[19:28] set up his control tower in the heart
[19:31] where somebody believes by faith without
[19:33] reasonings amen without then without all
[19:36] the details without all the explanation
[19:38] just because it's the word of god we
[19:41] stay behind the word of god and that
[19:43] word of god is the headship is the
[19:45] protection is the wall
[19:48] but the satan's trying to take dominion
[19:50] using his headquarters in the mind and
[19:53] get get us to switch over from simple
[19:56] faith in the word to reasoning and
[19:58] intellect and pondering and wondering
[20:01] and all of these other things amen so
[20:03] that we can move into the realm of
[20:04] reasoning and thought amen and thereby
[20:07] be deceived by the senses
[20:10] amen
[20:11] now we go down to the greatest battle
[20:13] ever fought in 1962 it says now before
[20:16] any battle can be put in a ray they
[20:18] first have to choose a meeting ground or
[20:20] a place where the battle is to be fought
[20:22] a selected place
[20:24] in the first world war it was so placed
[20:26] a no man's land a place where they
[20:28] fought and they've got to be a place
[20:31] selected like when israel went to war
[20:33] with the philistines there was a hill on
[20:36] each side where they gathered and that's
[20:37] where goliath came out and called to the
[20:39] armies of israel that's where david met
[20:41] him in the valley when he passed over
[20:44] the little creek that run between the
[20:45] two hills he picked up the rocks there
[20:48] has to be a place selected and in this
[20:51] there's a mutual ground no man's land
[20:53] they fight here at this place they just
[20:56] don't one fight over here and one down
[20:58] here and one run over here there's a
[21:00] battlefront where they meet and test
[21:01] their powers where each army tested
[21:04] strength against the other army a mutual
[21:06] meeting place now don't miss this
[21:10] when this great battle started on earth
[21:12] there had to be a mutual meeting place
[21:14] there had to be a place selected for the
[21:17] battle to begin and for the battle to
[21:19] rage and that battlegrounds begin in the
[21:21] human mind
[21:23] there is where the battle starts the
[21:25] human mind was chosen for the place of
[21:27] battle there is where it began and that
[21:30] is because that decisions are made from
[21:32] the mind the head now they never started
[21:34] it from some organ in the organization
[21:36] they never started from some mechanical
[21:38] affair the grounds never started there
[21:41] therefore that organization can never
[21:43] never do the work of god because the
[21:45] battlegrounds where you've got to meet
[21:47] your enemy is in the mind you've got to
[21:49] make your choice it meets you
[21:53] so we know that god set up his control
[21:55] tower in the soul
[21:57] the devil set up his control tower and
[21:59] the mind
[22:01] he's using senses and reasoning and
[22:03] thought memory reasoning affections and
[22:05] see taste smell feel and here's using
[22:07] all of these things amen to try to take
[22:10] the headship amen god is wanting
[22:12] headship by his word amen and he's got
[22:16] his
[22:16] he's got his control tower in the heart
[22:18] but the decisions are made in the mind
[22:21] because we've we've been put on free
[22:23] moral agency we've come to the
[22:25] opportunity to make our choice amen even
[22:28] lucifer was given an opportunity to make
[22:29] his choice and he made his choice amen
[22:32] to backslide amen to exert his will over
[22:34] the will of god amen we've got to make
[22:36] our choice and the choice is made in the
[22:38] mind but the devil is using the mind as
[22:41] the control tower amen but god is
[22:43] working in the soul by faith amen so we
[22:46] make our choice not when we reason
[22:49] everything out and one has a better
[22:50] explanation than the other amen because
[22:52] that's where the devil's working but we
[22:55] make our choice when we go a little
[22:56] deeper than the level of reasoning and
[22:59] thought when something in the heart
[23:01] strikes unto the word and says that's
[23:03] nothing but the truth that's thus saith
[23:05] the lord that's the word i'm taking the
[23:07] word that's the choice you make in your
[23:09] mind but it comes from faith in the
[23:11] heart
[23:13] right so just because the battlegrounds
[23:16] in the mind doesn't mean that god is
[23:19] just working in the mind and sane's
[23:20] working in the mind god's headquarters
[23:23] is deeper than the mind it's in the soul
[23:25] and he's operating by faith
[23:29] so the devil can make something so
[23:31] enticing
[23:33] so
[23:34] reasonable so
[23:36] thought provoking
[23:39] so we can i mean we can come to battle
[23:43] thought for thought
[23:45] scripture for scripture
[23:47] quote for quote
[23:49] but if we're ever going to have victory
[23:52] there's got to be a source that goes
[23:53] deeper than the thought realm deeper
[23:55] than the mind there's got to be
[23:57] something in the soul that can get a
[23:59] hold of the word of god and say that's
[24:01] the truth i'm going with the word
[24:04] even though i can't explain it to the
[24:07] devil
[24:09] you know
[24:10] eve there's no way eve would have been
[24:12] able to rationally
[24:14] explain to the devil why she couldn't
[24:17] eat from this tree
[24:19] all right
[24:20] she there's no way the the he began to
[24:23] question the word of god and question it
[24:25] to her and then and get her to amend
[24:28] doubt amen the word of god and doubt
[24:31] even her understanding of the word of
[24:33] god and begin to try to show her another
[24:36] way to interpret the word or another way
[24:38] amen
[24:39] in the word amen and she could never
[24:42] have rationalized why god said don't eat
[24:45] from this
[24:47] she couldn't have pointed to facts she
[24:49] couldn't have went to a case study she
[24:50] couldn't went to historical information
[24:54] so there was no decision based on
[24:58] facts she would simply have to believe
[25:01] that if god said it it's right if god
[25:04] said it it's the right way to go i'm
[25:06] choosing god's way in the realm of my
[25:09] mind because of something in my heart
[25:11] and i'm rejecting the enticing speech of
[25:14] satan even though i can't combat it with
[25:17] more facts
[25:20] amen
[25:22] praise be to god
[25:24] i don't want to stay on that too long
[25:25] i'm going to keep moving all right let's
[25:26] go to first samuel
[25:29] this is where things started coming
[25:31] alive for me when uh
[25:33] brother kyle went to the story of david
[25:35] and goliath and god just started
[25:36] triggering some things
[25:39] let's look at first samuel 17.
[25:48] first samuel
[25:49] 17
[25:51] 43
[25:54] and the philistines said unto david am i
[25:56] a dog and thou comes to me with staves
[25:59] and the philistine cursed david by his
[26:01] gods and the philistines said to david
[26:03] come to me and i will i will give thy
[26:06] flesh unto the fowls of the air and to
[26:08] the beasts of the field
[26:10] and then
[26:11] and then said david to the philistine
[26:14] thou comest to me with a sword and with
[26:15] a spear with a shield but i come to thee
[26:18] in the name of the lord of hosts the god
[26:20] of the armies of israel whom thou hast
[26:22] defied. this day will the lord deliver
[26:25] thee unto my hand and i will smite thee
[26:27] and take nine head from thee and i will
[26:30] give thy carcass of the host of the
[26:31] philistines this day unto the fowls of
[26:33] the air and the wild beasts of the earth
[26:36] and all the earth may know that there is
[26:38] a god in israel and all this assembly
[26:41] shall know that the lord saveth not with
[26:43] sword and spear for the battle is the
[26:45] lord's and he will give you unto our
[26:48] hands
[26:50] now when we look at the situation that
[26:52] david was up against
[26:54] it was unreasonable to believe that
[26:56] david could defeat goliath
[26:58] it was not logical it was not reasonable
[27:01] your eyesight would never have brought
[27:04] you to that conclusion your reasoning
[27:06] would have never brought you to that
[27:07] conclusion amen there's no reasonable
[27:10] explanation for david's courage there's
[27:13] no reasonable explanation for david's
[27:15] faith there's no way that david could
[27:18] explain amen how he's going to defeat
[27:20] goliath and how he's going to cut off
[27:22] his head he just knows that he's going
[27:24] to defeat david goliath and he's going
[27:26] to cut off his head how i don't know
[27:29] that he knew amen he didn't he didn't
[27:30] give the details he couldn't have
[27:32] thoroughly explained it all but he knew
[27:34] it was going to happen and he could
[27:36] declare that it was going to happen
[27:37] because he knew that this was an
[27:39] uncircumcised philistine who was not
[27:42] even in the promise but david was
[27:44] circumcised and anointed amen and was
[27:48] standing upon the word of god this was
[27:50] an enemy encroaching into the kingdom of
[27:52] god into the word of god defying the
[27:55] armies of god and there was no way that
[27:57] this could stand
[28:00] so it wasn't reasoning david was relying
[28:02] on nor his eyesight nor
[28:04] any other
[28:06] natural faculty amen there was a seat of
[28:08] faith in there that was rising up under
[28:10] the occasion because he was anointed in
[28:12] such a way amen to take on this thing
[28:15] and he was going after it amen by faith
[28:19] all right
[28:21] so now
[28:22] the rest of israel
[28:24] was stuck
[28:26] in a head
[28:28] battle with sight with sound
[28:32] they saw the giant
[28:35] and listen he was he was a giant i mean
[28:37] he was a giant of a giant he was a big
[28:39] man and he would come down across i'm
[28:42] off that other side of that mountain and
[28:44] down to the edge of the valley to call
[28:46] out to them and this was psychological
[28:48] warfare amen he would come down and he
[28:50] would have an armor bearer come with him
[28:52] and i'll just tell you how the devil
[28:54] works i would guess i don't know but i
[28:56] would guess they picked the smallest man
[28:59] that they could find in the philistine
[29:00] army to be the armor bearer for goliath
[29:03] so from across the valley and the ratio
[29:08] this is how the devil does it he was a
[29:10] giant he was an absolute giant amen but
[29:12] across the way if they would have picked
[29:14] the smallest guy they would a guy got a
[29:17] guy who was four foot eleven five foot
[29:18] one to carry his armor amen to where he
[29:21] could barely tumble along with the
[29:23] shield amen the israelites from across
[29:25] the valley would be like whoa
[29:30] and nothing in their mind
[29:33] let them believe they could defeat that
[29:39] but david wasn't looking at his size
[29:43] the only thing he heard
[29:45] when when that philistine boasted
[29:49] was a challenge against the word of god
[29:53] everybody else saw a challenge against
[29:56] their person
[29:58] and they saw themselves versus goliath
[30:02] david saw god versus goliath
[30:06] this is why it's good to know who you
[30:08] are and whose side you're on and who's
[30:10] in you amen to know that you're a child
[30:12] of god standing for the word of god if
[30:14] you don't have that settled you'll never
[30:16] win a battle because you're looking at
[30:17] yourself versus this devil you're
[30:19] looking yourself versus this sickness
[30:21] yourself versus this situation amen but
[30:23] when you realize that something contrary
[30:25] to the word is coming and challenging
[30:27] the word in your life challenging
[30:29] whether this word is true or not
[30:31] challenging whether or not he's the same
[30:33] yesterday today forever challenging
[30:35] whether or not he already paid for
[30:37] healing when he died on calvary
[30:39] challenging whether or not bias stripes
[30:41] you're already healed when you think
[30:42] it's you amen fighting against this
[30:45] challenge amen you'll do the same thing
[30:47] the israelites do hide out in the tent
[30:49] and hope it goes away
[30:52] but if we can go like david and say i
[30:55] have been i'm an i am a part of the
[30:57] circumcision i'm part of israel i'm part
[31:00] of the chosen i have a seal of god in my
[31:03] life and furthermore i've been anointed
[31:05] for this day amen because the anointing
[31:07] is on the bride to overcome in this day
[31:10] so i've been anointed to the word i mean
[31:12] i've been anointed to defy the armies of
[31:15] the enemy and when something comes in i
[31:18] don't have to run and hide and hope it
[31:20] goes away all i need to do is say amen
[31:23] the god who's delivered me from this and
[31:25] deliver me from that and deliver me from
[31:26] this will deliver me from this also
[31:29] because it's nothing more than a
[31:31] challenge against the word of god and
[31:33] i'm here representing the word of god i
[31:36] am a representative of the very
[31:38] manifested word of god and this
[31:41] philistine this demon is challenging the
[31:43] word of god not challenging me as a
[31:46] person
[31:48] david as a person was no match for
[31:51] goliath as a person
[31:53] and you as a human being are no match
[31:56] for a devil
[31:58] these devils have been around amen for
[32:01] thousands and thousands of years amen
[32:03] their chief captain is perfect in wisdom
[32:08] they have been deceiving mankind for
[32:10] thousands of years you and your
[32:12] intellect are zero match for a devil
[32:16] that's why you can't look at yourself
[32:18] and fight an enemy you can't you can't
[32:20] take the devil's challenge and withstand
[32:23] him when you look at yourself you have
[32:25] to see that this devil is attacking the
[32:28] word of god that's supposed to be
[32:30] manifesting in my flesh
[32:33] because god wants his word on display
[32:36] and he wants it on display in his body
[32:39] and you have to know where that body is
[32:41] who that body is and know that you're a
[32:43] member of that body and if you know that
[32:45] you're a member of that body now it's
[32:47] not you fighting the devil amen it's the
[32:49] word of god through you fighting that
[32:52] devil
[32:57] amen
[33:00] stay here in first samuel 17 but i want
[33:02] to read
[33:04] two other passages of scripture
[33:06] i'm going to read to you out of psalms
[33:07] 83. sorry in verse 1
[33:11] says keep not thou silent o god hold not
[33:13] thy peace and be not still god for lo
[33:16] thine enemies make a tumult and they
[33:19] that hate thee have lifted up the head
[33:22] this is so important
[33:24] they that hate thee have lifted up their
[33:26] head
[33:27] lucifer in the beginning was trying to
[33:29] exalt himself
[33:31] over the stars of god and be like the
[33:34] most high
[33:35] he was lifting himself up and and and
[33:38] the same thing goliath was doing he was
[33:41] elevated in stature but in his speech he
[33:44] was lifting himself up and defying the
[33:46] living god and defying the armies of god
[33:50] so the enemy is always lifted lifting up
[33:53] the head
[33:55] man that's important to understand
[33:58] because lifting up the head doesn't just
[34:00] mean that he was taller but lifting up
[34:02] the head brings the
[34:04] reasoning the
[34:06] thought amen when when
[34:09] satan threw the serpent was enticing eve
[34:12] he was lifting up his head over her head
[34:16] and he was giving her more knowledge
[34:18] than she had and he was lifting his head
[34:20] above her head amen so she should not
[34:23] have relied on her own head she should
[34:25] have went to the true headship of the
[34:26] word because the true headship of the
[34:28] word is always over that head
[34:32] so the enemy is always lifting up his
[34:34] head against god
[34:36] trying to out reason out think
[34:39] outmaneuver out speak out
[34:41] [Applause]
[34:42] all right
[34:44] so though that haiti have lifted up the
[34:46] head they have taken crafty counseled
[34:48] against thy people and consulted against
[34:50] the hidden ones
[34:52] who are the hidden ones
[34:57] by faith i believe i'm one of those
[34:58] hidden ones
[35:00] and he's lifted up his head against god
[35:03] taking crafty counsel against thy people
[35:06] and and
[35:07] consulted against the hidden ones
[35:10] then jesus says in matthew 23 10
[35:14] it says neither be you called masters
[35:16] for one is your master even christ but
[35:18] he that is graced among you shall be
[35:20] your servant and whosoever shall exalt
[35:22] himself shall be abased and he that
[35:25] shall humble himself shall be exalted
[35:28] so these are principles with god that we
[35:30] should never deviate from because
[35:33] anything that lifts its head above the
[35:35] word of god is a devil
[35:39] anything that will lift its head against
[35:41] this message
[35:43] and try to overthink or over rationalize
[35:46] the messenger of the age
[35:47] is an enemy to god
[35:51] amen
[35:53] anything that will exalt itself
[35:56] will be abased
[35:58] but those that will humble themselves to
[36:01] the word of god in this day shall be
[36:03] exalted
[36:05] so the reality is
[36:06] you can never exalt yourself
[36:10] so if you want to be higher and you want
[36:12] to live in a higher realm and you want
[36:14] to climb into the higher heights you can
[36:16] never do it yourself the only way you
[36:18] can do it is if somebody exalts you
[36:21] because anything that exalts self is of
[36:23] lucifer's nature amen because christ
[36:26] came from high to low abased himself and
[36:29] became servant of all amen and god
[36:31] exalted him
[36:34] so he humbled himself god exalted him
[36:37] that's the pattern lucifer had a high
[36:39] position but was not satisfied with his
[36:41] position wanted to go a little higher
[36:43] that's always characteristic of the
[36:45] enemy
[36:47] but god was always able to go from a
[36:49] high position to a low position
[36:52] to serve others then he was exalted to a
[36:55] high position
[36:57] so david was anointed to be king and
[36:59] after he was anointed be king he went to
[37:01] the field to serve his father and keep
[37:03] his father sheep
[37:05] right the so there's no problem staying
[37:08] humble amen when god's in it because
[37:11] god's the one will exalt in due time
[37:14] all right so the enemy lifts its head i
[37:17] don't want you to think of physical head
[37:19] but that thinking that reasoning that
[37:22] intellectual side trying to out reason
[37:25] amen the message of the day or find
[37:27] reasons why brother graham taught a
[37:29] certain subject the wrong way or may not
[37:31] have been right on that amen that's
[37:33] absolute the enemy
[37:36] but those who are able to humble
[37:37] themselves in due time shall be exalted
[37:41] now let's go on to uh back to first
[37:43] samuel 17.
[37:45] i'm going to look at verse 50.
[37:50] so david prevailed over the philistine
[37:52] with a sling and with a stone
[37:55] i want you to think about this
[37:57] what is reasonable about this
[38:00] nothing
[38:02] when you see david with a staff a
[38:05] shepherd's bag shepherd's clothes
[38:07] sandals amen
[38:09] five rocks and a piece of leather and a
[38:11] staff
[38:14] running down one hillside to meet a
[38:16] giant who has an armor bearer amen
[38:19] because his armor is so heavy he has
[38:21] somebody carry it for him until he's
[38:22] ready for battle with a giant spear with
[38:24] a giant shield amen with a helmet of
[38:27] brass
[38:29] all the armament and he's gigantic
[38:32] and he's a warrior from his youth
[38:35] david's as far as we know never fought
[38:37] another human being
[38:39] there's nothing in the scenario that's
[38:42] intellectual that's reasonable that
[38:44] makes sense your eyesight your ears amen
[38:46] nothing will tell you amen that this is
[38:48] a fair fight and i'll go to tell you
[38:50] it's not a fair fight god's on david's
[38:52] side so it's not at all a fair fight
[38:56] i mean i can imagine so many years we're
[38:58] watching david say oh poor david amen
[39:00] and david was thinking oh poor giant i
[39:02] mean
[39:05] if god's on your side you're more than a
[39:06] match
[39:09] amen so let's look at verse 50. so david
[39:11] prevailed over the philistine with a
[39:13] sling and with a stone and smote the
[39:15] philistine and slew him
[39:17] but there was no sword in the hand of
[39:19] david
[39:20] david already prophesied he'd he'd cut
[39:24] off his head
[39:25] and he didn't have a sword
[39:29] see david's not relying on his intellect
[39:32] his reasoning what he can see he's not
[39:34] relying on the sword that he can feel
[39:36] that he can see he doesn't have it
[39:38] calculated he can't see the next step
[39:41] but he knows what he's supposed to do
[39:44] there was no sword in the hand of david
[39:47] therefore david ran and stood upon the
[39:48] philistine and took a sword and drew it
[39:51] out of the sheet thereof and slew him
[39:53] and cut off his head there with and when
[39:55] the philistines saw their champion was
[39:57] dead they fled
[39:59] amen
[40:01] so
[40:02] so david prevailed
[40:04] with a sling
[40:06] and with a stone
[40:09] now
[40:10] i want to i want to look at this because
[40:12] we're talking about the head exalted
[40:14] over the enemies so when it comes to
[40:16] goliath's head he was so much higher
[40:19] than david so if we look at this and it
[40:22] this is a physical match-up that we're
[40:24] looking at there's a physical offset we
[40:26] have a short boy amen with no armament
[40:29] and no skill and then we have a giant
[40:32] who's much bigger with all the armament
[40:34] and and so when we look at this
[40:36] different situation i want you to think
[40:38] in the realms of reasoning understand
[40:40] and intellect
[40:42] all right
[40:44] the devil has got you beat in reasoning
[40:48] he's far above you in intellectual
[40:51] prowess and scientific understanding
[40:54] all right and so goliath is all the way
[40:57] up here
[40:58] david's down here and so his head is
[41:01] lifted up above his enemy amen and he
[41:03] thinks he knows something and he's got
[41:05] it all figured out and over his head to
[41:08] protect that wrong thinking he's got
[41:11] armament of brass all over his head so
[41:13] his thinking
[41:15] he is he has armored his thinking to
[41:18] where nothing can penetrate his
[41:19] reasoning he's got it so reasoned out
[41:22] he's got it so well thought out his plan
[41:25] is so planned out amen that he's got it
[41:27] wrapped around in brass amen but david
[41:30] all he needs is one revelation that
[41:32] comes from faith amen in one revelation
[41:35] that come from faith in the word of god
[41:37] amen was able and he took that sling and
[41:40] he slung that stone and brother branham
[41:42] said
[41:43] that god guided the stone home there was
[41:45] only one empty place that wasn't armored
[41:48] and god knew where that was and that
[41:50] stone of revelation because stone means
[41:52] a revelation
[41:54] amen and i don't think it was a big
[41:57] stone
[41:59] because it had to get through a little
[42:00] hole
[42:02] but it took a simple revelation in the
[42:05] word of god amen and god empowered that
[42:08] revelation and drove it home in the head
[42:12] of the giant amen where the reasoning
[42:14] and the thinking is amen and if we want
[42:17] to defeat the giants in our life we have
[42:19] to stop going around trying to get help
[42:21] we got to stop trying on saul's armor we
[42:24] have to stop convincing everybody to go
[42:26] with us we need to take faith in the
[42:28] word of god and take one little word
[42:30] amen one jesus went to calvary into the
[42:34] to the grave with one promise with one
[42:36] scripture with one revelation on the
[42:39] word of god and overcame and conquered
[42:41] death
[42:42] we have to stop trying to get everybody
[42:45] to help us and everybody stand with us
[42:47] all of israel had failed what we need is
[42:49] to have faith in this word that's been
[42:51] given to us and have a real revelation
[42:53] by faith in the word that has been
[42:55] placed in our hands and have enough
[42:57] courage to let loose of one of those
[42:59] revelations
[43:01] and let god drive it home amen i mean we
[43:04] don't have to sit here and hone our
[43:06] skills until you know i can i can lace a
[43:08] revelation right through the baptist and
[43:10] the presbyterian doctrine and get it hit
[43:12] home amen that's not the point the point
[43:14] is to have faith to let it go then let
[43:16] god take over because it's his word amen
[43:20] and it drove home
[43:23] into the giant source of thinking to the
[43:26] head
[43:29] and he collapsed
[43:31] under that
[43:33] and then david goes and stands up on the
[43:36] philistine and takes the philistine
[43:37] sword and cuts his own head off
[43:41] all right this is so
[43:43] the bible is so perfect in its types and
[43:46] shadows
[43:48] that he severed that reasoning
[43:51] that thinking
[43:52] and not speaking
[43:54] [Music]
[43:56] off of the giant
[43:58] and when the nation of israel saw that
[44:00] they they come running out and they
[44:02] smote the philistines
[44:05] i think it's so interesting what david
[44:07] said david said today i will smite thee
[44:12] and i will give the carcasses of the
[44:14] philistines to the fowls and the beasts
[44:19] amen this prophecy goes all the way
[44:22] through to the book of revelations to
[44:24] chapter 19.
[44:26] and in chapter 19 there's a white horse
[44:29] rider who is jesus christ amen and his
[44:32] name is
[44:33] in his name is called the word of god
[44:36] amen coming on a white horse with the
[44:38] armies of heaven following him and he's
[44:40] coming down amen and he's called lord of
[44:43] lord and king of kings and out of his
[44:44] mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword amen
[44:47] and it says in revelation 19 that will
[44:49] smite the nations amen and here he comes
[44:51] and brother branham says he will slay
[44:53] them by the word
[44:57] so how's he going to kill them by the
[44:59] word by the word that's coming out of
[45:00] his mouth amen by the revelation of the
[45:03] word and when he when he takes and he
[45:05] takes captive
[45:07] the dragon and the beast and the false
[45:09] prophet amen then
[45:12] he smites the the remnant amen of them
[45:14] with the with the sword out of his mouth
[45:16] which is by the word amen there is no
[45:19] battle of armageddon where jesus is
[45:21] riding around on a physical horse
[45:23] swinging his head to and fro chopping
[45:25] people's heads off he slays them by the
[45:27] word that comes out of his mouth
[45:30] they are slayed by the word and besides
[45:33] these aren't people with armies and
[45:34] tanks brother branham said they're
[45:36] catholics and protestants
[45:38] they're denominational systems and in
[45:40] this day we've seen the lord amen smite
[45:43] those denominational systems by the word
[45:45] that come out of his mouth
[45:48] and then he said
[45:50] he called an angel standing in the sun
[45:53] called for the fowls of the air to come
[45:55] feast upon their flesh
[45:57] and when brother bam describes this amen
[45:59] in the seals he says now look back on
[46:01] the sixth seal amen he destroys her with
[46:04] death and he destroys her with beasts of
[46:05] the field here they come the fowls and
[46:08] the beasts of the field come to eat
[46:09] their flesh amen who did it first who
[46:12] prophesied at first it was david all the
[46:14] way back amen david amen slew the giant
[46:18] amen that was defying the armies of god
[46:20] and when he slew the giant the nation
[46:22] went out and fought what did he use he
[46:25] used a stone
[46:28] then he took his head off
[46:30] he destroyed that thinking
[46:33] that reasoning
[46:35] and then he fed the carcasses of the
[46:37] philistines to the thousand beasts of
[46:38] the air because the son of david is
[46:41] going to do the same thing in this day
[46:44] praise be to god the bible is perfect in
[46:47] every way
[46:50] in 1961 abraham's covenant confirmed
[46:52] brother bram says as i said the other
[46:54] night in the garden of eden the devil
[46:56] chose a part of man and god chose a part
[46:58] of man god chose his heart the devil
[47:00] chose his intellects
[47:02] and now today the church today depends
[47:04] everything upon intellect and never
[47:05] thinking of the heart and the only thing
[47:07] they can say well i just can't see it
[47:10] that way you don't see with your eyes
[47:12] anyhow you look with your eyes you see
[47:14] with your heart you look at anything i
[47:16] just don't see it you're looking at it
[47:17] but you don't see it it means you don't
[47:19] understand it your understanding comes
[47:21] from your heart
[47:24] from faith by revelation
[47:28] now here he is now he doesn't understand
[47:30] it with his mind how he's going to do it
[47:33] his intellectuals would tell him that
[47:35] that's his reasoning but the bible said
[47:37] we cast down reasonings cast them away
[47:40] from us
[47:42] praise god let's go to second
[47:43] corinthians chapter 10.
[47:52] second corinthians chapter 10.
[48:01] in second corinthians chapter 10 we'll
[48:03] begin reading in verse 3.
[48:05] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[48:07] not war after the flesh
[48:10] this is not a flesh war
[48:14] no matter what you're going through it's
[48:16] not the flesh
[48:18] it may look every which way around you
[48:21] like it's flesh
[48:23] the situation at work the situation a
[48:25] home situation with a whatever
[48:28] with finances with a car with a
[48:29] relationship it may look like fast it's
[48:32] not flesh
[48:33] remember then
[48:35] because the scripture says for though we
[48:37] walk in the flesh we do not war after
[48:38] the flesh for the weapons of our warfare
[48:41] are not carnal but mighty through god to
[48:44] the pulling down of strongholds casting
[48:47] down imaginations and every high thing
[48:49] that exalted itself against the
[48:51] knowledge of god and bringing into
[48:53] captivity every thought to the obedience
[48:56] of christ
[48:57] and having in readiness to revenge all
[48:59] disobedience when your obedience is
[49:02] fulfilled
[49:03] i want to take a minute and talk about
[49:05] this
[49:07] casting down imaginations
[49:10] that takes place in the mind
[49:14] amen in every high thing that exalted
[49:16] itself against the knowledge of god that
[49:18] comes from his word
[49:20] and bringing every
[49:22] and bringing into captivity every
[49:24] thought
[49:25] to the obedience of christ which is the
[49:27] anointed word
[49:30] this battle takes place in the mind
[49:33] everything in this scripture refers to
[49:35] the mental realm
[49:38] but the weapons of our warfare are not
[49:40] carnal
[49:42] but we bring everything
[49:44] into obedience to christ the anointed
[49:47] word
[49:49] every imagination is cast down and that
[49:52] cast down is not just dropped i mean
[49:54] it's a violent term meaning to pull down
[49:56] or to to destroy
[49:59] casting down imaginations in the thought
[50:01] every high thing that exalted itself
[50:03] against the knowledge of god that comes
[50:04] from the word that's in your mind amen
[50:06] and bringing into captivity every
[50:08] thought into the obedience of christ
[50:10] amen which is the anointed word for your
[50:12] day so what do we battle and what do we
[50:14] battle with amen we're battling in the
[50:16] mental realm but we're always bringing
[50:18] every thought rejecting thoughts and
[50:20] bringing thoughts in obedience to the
[50:22] manifested word for our day
[50:25] this is how we're taught to warfare amen
[50:28] not by more reasoning not by more
[50:30] intellects not by more thinking but
[50:32] we're supposed to take the simple word
[50:34] of god and say that thought doesn't
[50:36] match what the prophet taught that
[50:38] thought doesn't match what paul brought
[50:40] that thought doesn't matter that desire
[50:43] is contrary to the word that thought is
[50:45] contrary to the word amen that teaching
[50:47] is contrary to the word to christ christ
[50:50] is the anointed word
[50:54] that's our word to warfare amen not
[50:56] fleshly but we're the warfare in the
[50:57] spirit but how do we warn the spirit not
[51:00] thought against thought thought against
[51:01] word amen not imagination against
[51:04] imagination imagination against the word
[51:06] we bring everything we cast it down
[51:08] because it doesn't match the word we
[51:09] bring the thought subject amen we
[51:11] capture it and bring it in obedience to
[51:14] christ
[51:15] we do not allow these thoughts to roam
[51:17] around that are contrary to the word
[51:21] why because like brother kyle was saying
[51:24] on sunday it starts in the mind
[51:26] the battle is worn or lost in the mind
[51:28] the fight according to paul takes place
[51:31] in the mind
[51:33] amen but you've got to have a revelation
[51:36] of the word because you've got to know
[51:37] what word you believe
[51:39] praise be to god
[51:41] and you've got to have enough faith in
[51:42] the word to speak the word contrary to
[51:45] the thought
[51:48] amen let's go to judges chapter 9.
[51:53] back to judges
[51:57] back before samuel we were just reading
[51:59] judges chapter 9
[52:01] i want to stay on this subject i've been
[52:03] through these examples but i'm going to
[52:04] hit them very quickly just two examples
[52:06] here actually three
[52:09] and we're going to look at judges
[52:10] chapter 9 verse 50.
[52:18] and we're going to look at abimelech
[52:20] and abimelech
[52:22] is the son
[52:23] of gideon gideon was a judge in israel
[52:27] and gideon
[52:29] amen had many sons but he had a son by a
[52:32] concubine and abimelech is a son by a
[52:34] concubine he's the illegitimate son but
[52:37] he wants to take his father's place
[52:39] after his father dies and so through
[52:40] conspiracy amen and through trickery he
[52:43] takes he takes the place of his father
[52:45] it says verse 50 then then went
[52:47] abimelech to tebez and it camped against
[52:50] thibas and took it
[52:51] and there was a strong tower within the
[52:53] city and the other fled all the men and
[52:55] women in all they of the city and shut
[52:57] it to them and got them up to the top of
[53:00] the tower and abimelech came into the
[53:02] tower and fought against it and went
[53:04] hard into the door of the tower to burn
[53:06] it with fire
[53:07] and a certain woman cast a piece of
[53:09] millstone
[53:11] upon abimelech's head and all to break
[53:13] his skull
[53:15] i love this story i love these little
[53:17] things in the bible amen because when
[53:19] you see the message when you see the
[53:21] seals open amen now your bible becomes a
[53:24] new book you can never read the bible
[53:26] the same way amen because every
[53:29] character and every story and type and
[53:31] shadow's been typing and shadowing the
[53:33] story out so here we have the
[53:36] antagonist here we have the enemy he's
[53:38] an impostor judge in israel he has no
[53:40] right to leadership amen but through
[53:42] deception amen he's killed off all the
[53:45] natural line through the through the
[53:46] true wives of gideon and now he is ex
[53:50] he is exalted himself into a position
[53:54] that's not his
[53:55] nobody put him in that position he did
[53:57] it through trickery he did it with
[53:59] conspiracy and then he did it and he and
[54:01] he exalted himself to a position but
[54:03] everyone who's been exalted will be a
[54:05] base everyone who's exalted self will be
[54:08] amazed but those who've abased
[54:10] themselves will be exalted
[54:12] so here he is amen abimelech is a is a
[54:15] type of the antichrist the bemalek is a
[54:18] type of satan amen doing the same thing
[54:20] that satan did that lucifer did and here
[54:22] he comes as an imposter judge over
[54:25] israel as a as an heir to gideon's
[54:27] position amen that he did not get
[54:29] legally that he did not get correctly he
[54:32] did it by deception and now he comes up
[54:34] to a city and he's going to bring the
[54:37] judgment upon them because they're not
[54:38] bowing to him
[54:40] they're not they're not bowing to his
[54:42] authority so he comes to the city to
[54:44] bring them back subject to him amen but
[54:47] in that certain place there's a strong
[54:49] tower that the righteous run into and
[54:51] are saved
[54:52] because christ the lord is our strong
[54:54] tower amen so these people ran into the
[54:57] tower of christ the lord they're in the
[54:59] word amen and when they climb into the
[55:02] tower the tower took them over the heads
[55:04] of their enemies
[55:08] now
[55:09] in the lord
[55:11] now those that were attacked are higher
[55:14] than their attacker
[55:18] and so
[55:19] i love the story says a woman
[55:23] not a warrior not a soldier not a
[55:26] philosopher not a priest but a woman
[55:29] took a piece of millstone not even the
[55:31] whole millstone
[55:34] just a piece of the millstone and stone
[55:36] is always a type of revelation she took
[55:38] a piece of the of the revelation a
[55:40] portion apart and she and she rolled it
[55:43] over the tower that she was in and it
[55:45] come down and it break his skull where
[55:48] the thinking and reasoning comes from
[55:51] how did this woman defeat abimelech not
[55:53] through strength not by my but by my
[55:56] spirit saith the lord she was in christ
[55:59] and in christ she was lifted up above
[56:01] her enemies and to destroy him
[56:04] all she had to do was take a piece of a
[56:06] revelation that she had and roll it over
[56:08] the top she didn't have to be strong she
[56:10] didn't have she didn't have to be a
[56:11] marksman she didn't have to have weapons
[56:13] all she had to do was take this piece of
[56:16] stone and drop it off the tower and it
[56:18] break his skull where the thinking and
[56:20] reasoning is
[56:23] i tell you the enemy today is that
[56:26] reasoning it was the enemy in the garden
[56:27] it's the enemy today we look at so many
[56:31] things out here as the enemy enemy enemy
[56:33] enemy but if the enemy was always
[56:35] reasoning against the word of god that
[56:37] was the original enemy that's the enemy
[56:40] today so how in the world am i going to
[56:42] overcome the reasoning and intellect of
[56:45] a being amen that was perfect in wisdom
[56:47] in the day that he was made amen it's
[56:49] not going to be strength it's not going
[56:51] to be power but it's going to be the
[56:52] spirit of god that is energized faith in
[56:55] a word of god and if i can take even a
[56:57] piece of that word of god and drop it
[56:59] out of the tower i'm in i can break the
[57:02] thinking the reasoning the skull the
[57:04] mind of the enemy and break the power
[57:07] amen the stronghold of that enemy in my
[57:09] life
[57:12] hey amen
[57:15] in the message the world is falling
[57:17] apart
[57:18] you say well i tell you i believe you
[57:21] haven't got no you ain't got no thought
[57:23] coming
[57:26] i love this
[57:28] and that's right you say i think this
[57:30] and you haven't got a thought i haven't
[57:33] either
[57:34] the bible says the mind that was in
[57:36] christ be in you and he was always about
[57:39] the father's business so that's the only
[57:41] thought you have to have to have what
[57:43] god said about it not what somebody else
[57:45] said but what god said that's all there
[57:48] is to it he said let every man's word be
[57:50] a lie and mind be the truth see that's
[57:52] the thing to cut the world back together
[57:55] that but they won't receive it now we
[57:58] know they won't because they never did
[58:02] that's the thing to fight with is the
[58:04] words
[58:06] just
[58:07] not what somebody else says not with
[58:09] reasoned out
[58:10] but just what god has given me to
[58:12] believe
[58:14] what did that woman take she took
[58:16] something that was in her hand
[58:18] what do we need what did shamgar use
[58:21] something that was in his hand
[58:23] what did david use he used the sling
[58:26] that he had in his hand amen and he
[58:28] picked up five stones which represented
[58:29] faith amen and he had revelation and he
[58:32] slung it at the at the devil amen we
[58:35] don't have to have great big mighty
[58:37] things in the eyes of the world or great
[58:39] big abilities what we need is simple
[58:41] faith in the word of god
[58:43] to believe that what he said is still
[58:45] true
[58:46] if it was ever true it's always true if
[58:49] it's true for another it can be true for
[58:50] me too
[58:52] amen
[58:55] let's go back to genesis chapter 3
[58:58] back to the original
[59:00] fall in the garden
[59:06] it was amazing what god did
[59:09] because
[59:11] when god cursed the serpent
[59:13] we know that the serpent was an upright
[59:16] being
[59:17] walking talking
[59:20] close to man but not man
[59:22] he was a beast of the field
[59:25] and brother branham said he was a giant
[59:27] of a fella
[59:28] a great big fella
[59:31] so it's it's
[59:33] it it looks like what brother branham's
[59:35] saying
[59:36] that the head of the serpent was
[59:38] probably higher than adam's head
[59:43] and through his exalted thinking by the
[59:45] anointing of satan
[59:47] he began to bring reasoning to the woman
[59:51] so when he was cursed we know his curse
[59:54] had to do with changing a structure so
[59:56] there could never be that kind of fall
[59:58] again where his seed could never cross
[1:00:00] again but when god cursed him god put
[1:00:02] him all the way down he put his head on
[1:00:06] the ground
[1:00:08] when god cursed the serpent he took the
[1:00:10] serpent that was like a man amen that
[1:00:12] was subtle that was wise to the ways of
[1:00:14] the world that could reason that could
[1:00:16] speak he was a bigger man than adam that
[1:00:18] her husband his head was higher and his
[1:00:21] reasoning under the anointing of devil
[1:00:22] the devil could out reason eve so when
[1:00:25] god cursed him he changed all of his
[1:00:27] structure amen and he took him and put
[1:00:29] him flat on the ground amen and put him
[1:00:32] on the ground and put his head on the
[1:00:34] ground
[1:00:37] and then look at verse 14
[1:00:40] and the lord god said unto the servant
[1:00:41] because thou has done this thou art
[1:00:43] cursed above all cattle and above every
[1:00:44] beast of the field upon thy belly shalt
[1:00:47] thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the
[1:00:48] days of thy life and i will put enmity
[1:00:51] between thee and the woman in between
[1:00:53] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise it
[1:00:57] shall bruise thy head and thou shall
[1:00:59] bruise his
[1:01:00] heel
[1:01:04] in the prophecy
[1:01:05] he put the head of the serpent under the
[1:01:09] foot of the seed of the woman
[1:01:12] all of this symbology god writes
[1:01:14] everything he writes in the bible for a
[1:01:16] reason that reasoning was brought low
[1:01:18] amen and there's going to be amen the
[1:01:20] seed of the woman is going to crush that
[1:01:23] serpent under its foot amen so it's
[1:01:26] driving the thinking back to the ground
[1:01:29] because it's nothing but carnal thinking
[1:01:31] amen there's nothing but earthly fleshly
[1:01:33] carnal thinking amen in the heel amen of
[1:01:36] the seed of the woman will drive the
[1:01:39] head of that serpent into the dust of
[1:01:41] the dirt of the ground because it's
[1:01:43] nothing but carnal sensual
[1:01:46] natural thinking
[1:01:48] praise gone
[1:01:50] so then we know there's there's another
[1:01:52] glimpse at the prophecy that the apostle
[1:01:54] paul brings us in romans 16 20 he says
[1:01:57] in the god of peace shall brew satan
[1:01:58] under
[1:01:59] your feet surely that means you must be
[1:02:02] part of the seed of the woman you must
[1:02:04] be part of the christ seed amen the
[1:02:06] royal seed of abraham which is christ
[1:02:08] which is a singular seed amen and you
[1:02:11] must be part of that same seed and part
[1:02:14] of that same prophecy in order for paul
[1:02:17] to pick it up and bring in romans and
[1:02:18] say the god of peace shall brew satan
[1:02:21] under your feet shortly who's he talking
[1:02:24] to he's talking to the body of jesus
[1:02:26] christ which is the church amen
[1:02:31] so where
[1:02:32] where is that reasoning supposed to be
[1:02:35] under your feet
[1:02:37] where is that high exalted intelligent
[1:02:40] thinking supposed to be under your feet
[1:02:43] now
[1:02:45] how are you going to put it under your
[1:02:46] feet
[1:02:49] not by debate
[1:02:52] not by yelling at the devil
[1:02:56] not by screaming not by yelling not by
[1:02:59] intellectual wisdom not by understanding
[1:03:02] something more not by putting them in
[1:03:04] place with your mental prowess none of
[1:03:07] that will work how do you put him under
[1:03:09] your feet amen the the feet is
[1:03:11] represents the body of the seed of the
[1:03:14] woman and the body of the seed of the
[1:03:16] woman is the word made flesh so he's to
[1:03:19] be under the word
[1:03:22] under the word amen so how do i put him
[1:03:25] under my feet when i manifest the word
[1:03:29] and i stay with the word and i allow the
[1:03:31] word by my my subjection to my headship
[1:03:35] when i allow the word to flow through me
[1:03:37] amen then i become the word made flesh
[1:03:40] the word is made flesh in my flesh when
[1:03:43] i surrender and obey the word amen and
[1:03:46] the word now lives its life through me
[1:03:48] amen and that puts the devil in his
[1:03:50] place under the feet which is under the
[1:03:53] manifested word it's not your physical
[1:03:56] foot you can stomp stomp stomp this is a
[1:03:58] spiritual position you've been elevated
[1:04:00] higher by the word amen he's been
[1:04:03] brought lower by the word you never
[1:04:05] overcome by debate you never overcome
[1:04:09] amen you're never to become a snake
[1:04:11] handler
[1:04:14] to look at him and handle it and reason
[1:04:16] it and think about it amen you're just
[1:04:18] to keep it under the word
[1:04:21] always under the word under the word
[1:04:23] under the word and the word made
[1:04:25] manifest is always amen driving the head
[1:04:28] of that serpent back into the earth
[1:04:30] where it comes from
[1:04:33] it's carnal it's sensual using reason to
[1:04:37] touch your affections
[1:04:39] to touch your thoughts
[1:04:40] your memory
[1:04:42] all of those things are the carnal part
[1:04:45] of you
[1:04:46] the natural part of you
[1:04:48] and he's always using his reason his
[1:04:50] tactics to entice the natural part of
[1:04:52] you but you're to put that back down in
[1:04:54] its place by
[1:04:56] the word
[1:05:00] let's look at judges chapter 4.
[1:05:02] this is another one of those examples
[1:05:04] i'm going to use
[1:05:09] back to judges chapter 4.
[1:05:14] excuse me
[1:05:16] and i'm going to begin in verse 17.
[1:05:21] this example we've used on a couple of
[1:05:23] occasions
[1:05:24] it comes from the time period when
[1:05:26] deborah was judged over israel and
[1:05:29] deborah was the fourth judge of israel
[1:05:32] representing the fourth stage of life
[1:05:34] for the wheat sea when it comes back to
[1:05:36] being in bride form
[1:05:38] when it's christ in the formation of his
[1:05:40] bride so now you have a woman who's a
[1:05:42] prophetess who's a judge over israel
[1:05:45] it's just amazing
[1:05:47] and in that dispensation there's going
[1:05:50] to be a victory over the enemy
[1:05:52] but the victory was told to barack
[1:05:54] because you asked me to come with you
[1:05:56] amen the victory won't be for your honor
[1:05:58] but the victory will come by the hand of
[1:06:00] a woman
[1:06:01] and i want to look at that here
[1:06:03] in verse 17.
[1:06:05] how be it sasera fled away on his feet
[1:06:07] to the tent of jail the wife of heber
[1:06:10] the canaanite for there was peace
[1:06:12] between jaben the king of hazard in the
[1:06:14] house of hebrew the canine
[1:06:16] and jail went out to meet cesara now
[1:06:19] so you'll know cesaro is the enemy
[1:06:22] cesaro is the bad guy cesar is the
[1:06:24] antagonist remember every story every
[1:06:27] character they're typing out the same
[1:06:29] story
[1:06:31] amen barack deborah and barack went
[1:06:34] barack is leading the armies of the lord
[1:06:35] they're defeating cesaro's army caesarea
[1:06:38] runs away and he goes to hide and he's
[1:06:41] going to go hide in the tent of a woman
[1:06:43] amen because that enemy has been hiding
[1:06:46] in the tent of a woman through seven
[1:06:47] church ages as it hides in the church
[1:06:52] he's been hiding out in the tent of a
[1:06:54] woman amen through the through the
[1:06:55] catholic church in the protestant
[1:06:57] denominations
[1:07:00] amen and he goes on to say
[1:07:03] and jail went out to meet cece and said
[1:07:04] unto him turn in my lord turn into me
[1:07:07] fear not and when he had turned in unto
[1:07:09] her into the tent she covered him with a
[1:07:11] mantle
[1:07:12] and he said unto her give me i pray thee
[1:07:14] a little water to drink for i am thirsty
[1:07:16] and she opened a bottle of milk and gave
[1:07:18] him drink and covered him and again he
[1:07:20] said unto her stand in the door of the
[1:07:22] tent and it shall be when any man doth
[1:07:24] come and inquire of thee and say is
[1:07:26] there any man here that thou shalt say
[1:07:28] no
[1:07:30] then jail hebrews wife took a nail of
[1:07:33] the tent a tent stake
[1:07:35] has anybody ever seen a tent stick for a
[1:07:37] big tent
[1:07:38] not one of those little bitty pop-up
[1:07:40] ones but
[1:07:42] okay
[1:07:44] took the nail of a tent and took a
[1:07:45] hammer in her hand and went softly unto
[1:07:48] him and smote the nail in his temples
[1:07:50] and fastened it to the ground for he was
[1:07:53] fast asleep and weary so he died
[1:07:56] so what did she do
[1:07:58] when he was in her tent
[1:08:01] when the deceiver was there
[1:08:04] she took a tent stake and put it over
[1:08:05] his temples
[1:08:07] and drove it right through his thinking
[1:08:10] and right through his thinking that
[1:08:13] carnal reasoning that enticing thinking
[1:08:16] she drove it right through and pinned it
[1:08:18] to the ground where that kind of
[1:08:20] thinking comes from
[1:08:25] amen i love the bible
[1:08:27] let's go to chapter 5 verse 24. this is
[1:08:30] when they begin to shout praises and
[1:08:32] sing of her victory in chapter 5 verse
[1:08:34] 24
[1:08:36] said
[1:08:36] um blessed above women shall the jail
[1:08:39] the wife of heber that cannot be blessed
[1:08:42] shall she be above women in the tent he
[1:08:44] asked water and she gave him milk she
[1:08:46] brought forth butter and a lordly dish
[1:08:48] she put her hand to the nail on her
[1:08:50] right hand to the workman's hammer and
[1:08:52] with hammer she smokes this era she
[1:08:54] smote off his head when she had pierced
[1:08:56] and stricken through his temples
[1:08:59] at her feet he bowed he fell he laid
[1:09:02] down at her feet he bowed he fell where
[1:09:05] he bowed there he fell down
[1:09:08] dead
[1:09:09] where did this mighty lord captain of a
[1:09:12] mighty army they said he had 900 iron
[1:09:14] chariots and he lorded over israel for
[1:09:17] 20 years and kept them in bondage amen
[1:09:20] how did he fall he fell in the tent of a
[1:09:22] woman when he was coming in there to
[1:09:24] hide and then trying to get her to be
[1:09:26] part of the deception but she knew what
[1:09:28] she was going to do she was going to
[1:09:29] drive that thinking of his right back to
[1:09:32] the earth where it came from and it said
[1:09:34] she smote off his head amen knocked off
[1:09:37] that whole source of reasoning knocked
[1:09:39] off the whole source of intelligence
[1:09:41] that's contrary to the word of god and
[1:09:43] he fell he bowed down at her feet he
[1:09:46] fell where at her feet he was knocked
[1:09:49] from his high position and fell to the
[1:09:51] feet the feet of a woman and the lord
[1:09:54] god of peace shall
[1:09:55] shall bruise satan under
[1:09:58] your feet
[1:10:00] he bowed and fell at the feet of a woman
[1:10:04] praise be to god
[1:10:06] don't go buy a nail
[1:10:09] don't go get a hammer
[1:10:11] we've been given the word of god
[1:10:14] and the word of god will defeat the
[1:10:15] devil anywhere anytime under any
[1:10:18] condition
[1:10:22] let's look at deuteronomy chapter 28
[1:10:26] my praise be to god
[1:10:36] deuteronomy 28
[1:10:40] verse 13.
[1:10:46] deuteronomy 28 and 13
[1:10:50] and the lord shall make thee the head
[1:10:52] and not the tale
[1:10:53] and thou shall be
[1:10:55] thou shalt be above only and thou shall
[1:10:58] not be beneath
[1:10:59] if that thou hearken unto the
[1:11:01] commandments of the lord thy god
[1:11:04] do you want to be the head or the tail
[1:11:07] do you want to be above or below
[1:11:09] here's the secret
[1:11:11] it says the lord shall make thee
[1:11:14] you will never make yourself
[1:11:16] you will never exalt yourself you will
[1:11:18] never lift yourself you will never climb
[1:11:20] your way up but the lord will make thee
[1:11:22] the head and not the tail
[1:11:24] and thou shalt be above only and thou
[1:11:27] shalt not be beneath if
[1:11:29] if
[1:11:30] if
[1:11:32] that thou hearken unto the commandments
[1:11:34] of the lord like god which i command
[1:11:36] thee this day to observe and to do them
[1:11:40] if israel wanted to be the head and not
[1:11:41] the tail if they wanted to be above and
[1:11:43] never below god would put them in that
[1:11:46] position
[1:11:47] if
[1:11:48] they humbled themselves to the word
[1:11:51] if they humbled their reasoning humbled
[1:11:54] their thinking humbled their emotions
[1:11:55] humbled their affection humbled their
[1:11:57] desires and humbled themselves and
[1:11:59] lowered themselves below the word of god
[1:12:02] then the word of god would lift them up
[1:12:04] and they would be the tail and not the
[1:12:05] head always above and never below and
[1:12:07] they would never have to lift themselves
[1:12:09] up they would get up by going down
[1:12:12] and if this bride ever wants to be
[1:12:14] lifted up she's got to first go down
[1:12:16] under the word of god under the
[1:12:18] messenger for the age she has to be
[1:12:20] under this word obedient to this word
[1:12:23] amen surrender to this word and if we
[1:12:26] stay a surrender to the word of god
[1:12:29] subjecting to our head then he will
[1:12:31] exalt us
[1:12:33] and make us the head and never the tail
[1:12:37] amen let's go to judges now back to
[1:12:40] judges
[1:12:42] this is the other example that we saw on
[1:12:44] sunday
[1:12:49] judges chapter 16
[1:12:53] and the story of samson
[1:12:58] when moses gave the law of a nazarite
[1:13:00] samson was called to be a nazarite from
[1:13:03] his from from the womb from birth
[1:13:05] when they gave the law of a nazarite in
[1:13:07] numbers he said all the days of the vow
[1:13:08] of his separation there shall no razor
[1:13:11] come upon his head the nazirite vow was
[1:13:13] a valve separation where somebody was
[1:13:15] completely separated from the world and
[1:13:17] dedicated only to god amen it's a
[1:13:20] separation and a dedication
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:25] and no razor come upon his head until
[1:13:27] the days be fulfilled in the which he
[1:13:29] separated himself to the lord he shall
[1:13:31] be holy and shall let the locks of his
[1:13:33] hair of his head grow
[1:13:35] so the the uncut locks of hair in his
[1:13:38] head they represented his nazirite vow
[1:13:40] and showed that he was under a vow and
[1:13:43] consecrated and dedicated to god amen
[1:13:46] for for a period of time for a purpose
[1:13:47] or whatever and we know god called a
[1:13:50] samson to be dedicated for his whole
[1:13:51] life
[1:13:53] to be separated out for god only and to
[1:13:55] be dedicated his whole life but we saw
[1:13:58] on sunday he began to play around with
[1:13:59] delilah let's pick that up in judges 16
[1:14:02] verse 18.
[1:14:08] yeah judges 16. sorry i'm in the wrong
[1:14:10] book
[1:14:11] judges 16
[1:14:13] 18.
[1:14:16] and when delilah saw that he had told
[1:14:17] her all his heart she sent and called
[1:14:20] the lords of the philistines saying come
[1:14:21] up this once for he hath showed me all
[1:14:24] his heart then the lords of the
[1:14:26] philistines came up unto her and brought
[1:14:27] money in their hand
[1:14:29] and she made him sleep upon her knees
[1:14:31] and she called for a man and she caused
[1:14:33] him to shave off the seven locks of his
[1:14:35] head and she began to afflict him and
[1:14:37] his strength went from him
[1:14:40] now i want you to catch the imagery here
[1:14:42] here is samson amen he's supposed to be
[1:14:44] under nazarite val dedicated to god he's
[1:14:47] supposed to be a deliverer of israel to
[1:14:48] deliver them from the hands of the
[1:14:50] philistines but delilah this woman this
[1:14:53] enticing woman amen that represents the
[1:14:55] false church amen she is enticed and she
[1:14:58] she has so uh allured samson amen and so
[1:15:02] troubled him so pushed him until he
[1:15:04] finally told the secret of his strength
[1:15:06] amen and then she laid him down in her
[1:15:09] lap
[1:15:10] now he's bowing down upon delilah and
[1:15:14] now she is higher than he
[1:15:17] now his head is in her lap she's holding
[1:15:20] his head she has been so successful in
[1:15:23] this deception that he has now she has
[1:15:25] lured him to sleep he's no longer alert
[1:15:28] he's no longer attentive he's no longer
[1:15:30] vigilant he's gone to sleep and he's in
[1:15:32] her lap now she's lording over him
[1:15:36] and in that situation she cuts off all
[1:15:39] his hair he loses his covenant with god
[1:15:41] and then he no longer has strength
[1:15:43] because his strength never come from him
[1:15:45] his strength came from a commandment of
[1:15:47] the lord and as long as he kept that
[1:15:48] commandment nobody could defeat him but
[1:15:50] the minute he left the commandment of
[1:15:52] god he lost all of his strength
[1:15:56] and if we have any strength if we if we
[1:15:58] could stand up here for days and share
[1:15:59] testimonies with you what god has done
[1:16:02] and god has healed and god has delivered
[1:16:03] and god has worked supernatural and you
[1:16:05] can look at that that's what samson had
[1:16:07] done he had testimonies of fighting them
[1:16:09] here testimonies of killing them there
[1:16:12] testimonies testimonies testimonies amen
[1:16:15] but now he was being lured into
[1:16:17] subjecting himself to a woman and lying
[1:16:20] upon her lamb amen and when he went
[1:16:23] listen listen very carefully when he
[1:16:26] left the word of god
[1:16:28] none of his testimonies would help him
[1:16:30] anymore
[1:16:34] when he
[1:16:36] gave away a secret
[1:16:38] and subjected himself to that woman and
[1:16:40] laid upon her lap and she stripped away
[1:16:42] his covenant when he was no longer
[1:16:45] subject to the covenant of god put him
[1:16:46] in he he could tell testimonies all day
[1:16:49] long and he had no strength because he
[1:16:51] left the word of god
[1:16:56] no matter what's happened in the past no
[1:16:58] matter how mighty god has come on our
[1:17:00] behalf do not get lured to sleep in this
[1:17:02] day and don't let your don't let your
[1:17:05] head be subject to a false teaching
[1:17:07] don't let your head become subject to a
[1:17:09] false woman amen you stay with the word
[1:17:11] of god and you stay with the true
[1:17:13] headship of the word in this day amen
[1:17:15] and don't let don't let anything false
[1:17:17] lord over you and strip you away and get
[1:17:20] you into a position where now you're
[1:17:22] disobedient to the very commandment of
[1:17:24] separation that he's called us to
[1:17:27] because you may have had mighty things
[1:17:28] happen in the past but you leave the
[1:17:30] word there's no more strength
[1:17:33] because it wasn't your strength
[1:17:36] it wasn't my strength
[1:17:38] it was his strength
[1:17:42] but i want to read verse 21
[1:17:46] but the philistines took him and put out
[1:17:48] his eyes
[1:17:49] and brought him down the gauze and bound
[1:17:50] him with fetters of brass and he did
[1:17:52] grind in the prison house
[1:17:54] howbeit the hair of his head began to
[1:17:56] grow again after he was shaven
[1:18:00] praise be to god
[1:18:03] god has not forgot his covenant
[1:18:06] he's just waiting for us to come back
[1:18:09] into the covenant
[1:18:12] and we know when samson humbled himself
[1:18:14] and repented and sacrificed himself
[1:18:16] completely to the will of god
[1:18:18] in his death he wrought a greater
[1:18:20] victory than he did in all of his life
[1:18:23] no matter what's happened
[1:18:25] just let the hair begin to grow back
[1:18:28] come back in the covenant come back in
[1:18:30] the covenant of the seven seals come
[1:18:32] back under the revelation of the word
[1:18:34] and come back to obedience and a
[1:18:36] consecrated life and separation only to
[1:18:39] god and watch the strength come back
[1:18:41] through humility
[1:18:44] and then psalms 3 3 says but thou o lord
[1:18:47] are a shield for me
[1:18:49] my glory and the lifter up of mine head
[1:18:54] we don't have the strength to lift our
[1:18:55] own head
[1:18:56] but he's my shield and my glory and he
[1:19:00] is the lifter of my head
[1:19:02] what does it mean when he lifts your
[1:19:03] head he gives you a revelation
[1:19:06] let's look at psalms 27 together
[1:19:14] psalms 27
[1:19:20] verse 1.
[1:19:23] psalms 27 and 1 the lord is my light
[1:19:27] and my salvation whom shall i fear the
[1:19:30] lord is the strength of my life of whom
[1:19:32] shall i be afraid
[1:19:34] look at who david's looking at dave is
[1:19:36] not looking at himself
[1:19:38] dave is not looking at his previous
[1:19:40] exploits and all that he did he's not
[1:19:41] saying i did this and i did this and i
[1:19:44] did that he said the lord is my
[1:19:45] salvation the lord is my lie i won't be
[1:19:48] afraid because he's my salvation i won't
[1:19:50] be afraid because he's my light
[1:19:54] of whom shall i be afraid when the
[1:19:56] wicked even mine enemies and my foes
[1:19:57] come upon me to eat up my flesh they
[1:19:59] stumbled and fell though a host should
[1:20:01] encamp against me my heart shall not
[1:20:03] fear the war shall rise up against me
[1:20:06] and this will i be confident one thing
[1:20:08] have i desired of the lord that will i
[1:20:10] seek after then i may dwell in the house
[1:20:12] of the lord all the days of my life to
[1:20:14] behold the beauty of the lord and to
[1:20:16] inquire in his temple
[1:20:18] for in the time of trouble
[1:20:21] he
[1:20:21] shall hide me
[1:20:23] in his pavilion
[1:20:26] what is it david had david had nothing
[1:20:29] but confidence in what god could do
[1:20:31] and what god would do
[1:20:33] in the time of trouble david didn't say
[1:20:35] i'll get my sword and i'll do no
[1:20:39] that's the mistake samson made by his
[1:20:41] testimony samson when when he lost the
[1:20:44] covenant when the woman stripped him
[1:20:45] away of the word and he was no longer
[1:20:47] under a word covenant with god he stood
[1:20:49] up and he shook himself and said i will
[1:20:51] go out as before
[1:20:54] he had gotten confidence in himself
[1:20:57] and he was defeated david had no
[1:21:00] confidence in himself but he had
[1:21:01] absolute confidence in the god who
[1:21:03] called him
[1:21:04] and the god who anointed him he knew
[1:21:06] what god would do
[1:21:09] and i will inquire
[1:21:10] in this temple for in the time of
[1:21:12] trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion
[1:21:14] and the secret of his tabernacle shall
[1:21:16] he hide in me he shall set me up upon a
[1:21:19] revelation
[1:21:22] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:21:26] my enemies round about when god picks me
[1:21:29] up and puts me on the revelation amen
[1:21:31] that's also the secret of his tabernacle
[1:21:34] this revelation that that is the third
[1:21:37] pool that's the little room that's the
[1:21:39] in the pavilion and the secret of his
[1:21:40] tabernacle when he brings you into that
[1:21:42] secret he sets your feet upon a rock
[1:21:44] amen because that secret reveals to you
[1:21:47] the hidden mystery in the back part of
[1:21:48] god's mind and it shows you your place
[1:21:51] in that mystery and he lifts you up and
[1:21:53] he puts you upon a rock and now your
[1:21:55] head is above the head of all of your
[1:21:57] enemies not because you're smarter not
[1:22:00] because of anything you've done or
[1:22:01] figured out because he lifted you up in
[1:22:04] the secret of his pavilion he drew you
[1:22:06] to the secret of his pavilion he hid you
[1:22:08] in the secret of his tabernacle and he
[1:22:10] lifted you up by giving you a revelation
[1:22:13] of the mystery of god amen and he told
[1:22:15] you your place in that mystery and put
[1:22:18] you on a firm foundation of revelation
[1:22:20] and now your head is lifted above the
[1:22:22] head of your mind
[1:22:24] not by what you and i have done but by
[1:22:26] what he's done amen it's all by
[1:22:28] revelation
[1:22:30] in the word
[1:22:32] then he goes on to say
[1:22:34] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:22:36] my enemies round about me therefore will
[1:22:38] i offer his tabernacle sacrifices of joy
[1:22:41] i will sing yeah i will sing praises
[1:22:44] unto the lord i want you to look at this
[1:22:46] oh my goodness
[1:22:48] all the enemies were still there
[1:22:51] the armies that wanted to eat up his
[1:22:53] flesh they were still there amen his
[1:22:55] enemies were still all around nothing
[1:22:58] changed with the number of enemies
[1:23:00] nothing changed with the location of
[1:23:01] enemies what changed is david was
[1:23:04] brought into the secret of his pavilion
[1:23:06] to the secret of his tabernacle and set
[1:23:08] upon a rock and now his revelation and
[1:23:11] understanding was higher than that of
[1:23:13] all the enemies around about him and now
[1:23:16] although the situation hadn't changed
[1:23:19] now he's singing with joy because he's
[1:23:21] standing upon the rock and his
[1:23:23] revelation and understanding is higher
[1:23:25] than that of all the enemies
[1:23:27] how is it you can be happy in the midst
[1:23:29] of a trial because you've been set upon
[1:23:31] a rock
[1:23:32] why is it you can rejoice when things
[1:23:34] seem to be falling apart how can you
[1:23:36] come to church on your worst day at work
[1:23:38] amen and after the second song you're in
[1:23:40] a different place and you're praising
[1:23:42] god and thanking him for all that he is
[1:23:43] and the wonderful things that he's done
[1:23:45] because he sets you up on a rock amen
[1:23:49] and now you understand your life and you
[1:23:50] understand what's going on you
[1:23:52] understand what the enemy is trying to
[1:23:53] do and you understand what god is trying
[1:23:55] to do and now you just surrender
[1:23:57] yourself to it let him bring you on the
[1:23:58] rock and let that revelation get your
[1:24:01] thinking higher than the thinking of the
[1:24:03] enemy all around
[1:24:05] and the enemy can still be there but it
[1:24:07] doesn't matter because he was higher
[1:24:11] the enemy is always trying to bring his
[1:24:13] head
[1:24:14] higher than your head trying to bring
[1:24:17] wisdom over your revelation
[1:24:20] trying to bring a greater reasoning and
[1:24:21] understanding over your revelation but
[1:24:23] christ when he lifts us up by revelation
[1:24:26] he puts our head over the head of our
[1:24:28] enemies and that's never a position you
[1:24:30] can put yourself he has to lift you to
[1:24:33] that position
[1:24:36] praise god
[1:24:38] oh my goodness i want to preach all
[1:24:40] night
[1:24:43] this is our victory this is the path to
[1:24:45] victory this is where we win this is how
[1:24:47] we defeat the devil amen it's not by
[1:24:49] being stronger wise or better praying
[1:24:51] more coming to church more often it's by
[1:24:53] allowing god by surrendering to this
[1:24:56] word and following him as he leads you
[1:24:58] into the secret chamber and sets you up
[1:25:00] upon a rock and then you understand
[1:25:02] what's going on in your life you
[1:25:03] understand why life has to be hard you
[1:25:06] understand why enemies are gathered
[1:25:07] about and why they want to eat up your
[1:25:09] flesh and why they want to destroy you
[1:25:11] because you're the very vessel he wants
[1:25:12] to use to destroy satan's kingdom and
[1:25:15] now you can sing with joy because
[1:25:17] greater is he that's in me than he
[1:25:18] that's all around
[1:25:20] and he that's in me amen was the one
[1:25:22] that was meant to be me from before the
[1:25:24] foundation of the world i come from god
[1:25:26] i'm going back to god and there's not a
[1:25:28] thing a devil on this earth can do to
[1:25:30] stop that journey from god to the earth
[1:25:33] to express god to go back to god and now
[1:25:36] upon this rock my head is above the head
[1:25:38] of all of my enemies
[1:25:40] say what you will do what you want throw
[1:25:43] all the errors that you want but i'm
[1:25:45] safe because of the revelation amen
[1:25:52] praise be to almighty god
[1:25:55] first samuel chapter 5.
[1:25:59] when god wanted his people to have
[1:26:01] victory in this day
[1:26:03] he opened the seals
[1:26:08] when god wanted his children to overcome
[1:26:11] what no church age had been able to
[1:26:12] overcome
[1:26:13] he opened the seals
[1:26:16] which was what
[1:26:18] opening up the mystery of god
[1:26:21] and when he opened up the mystery that
[1:26:22] he had held in the back part of his mind
[1:26:26] that was unfolded in a three-fold manner
[1:26:29] when he opened that
[1:26:30] he gave us the key to overcoming when he
[1:26:34] wanted us to have the final victory in
[1:26:37] the final battle he opened seals
[1:26:42] so how are we going to have victory
[1:26:44] through the open word
[1:26:46] through the opening of the book when
[1:26:48] under the opening of those seals the
[1:26:50] bible became a new bible amen it was
[1:26:52] opening of the word he took the seals
[1:26:54] off the word he took the he he took the
[1:26:56] mystery out of the back part of his mind
[1:26:57] and he brought it down to his bride amen
[1:27:00] all of these things amen they mean
[1:27:02] something to us what's he doing he's
[1:27:04] setting us up on a rock amen
[1:27:07] this is the key to victory
[1:27:11] first samuel chapter 5 verse 1.
[1:27:16] when the
[1:27:18] uh children of eli the two sons of eli
[1:27:20] had taken the ark in the battle to win
[1:27:22] over the philistines they lost the ark
[1:27:25] and then verse chapter five verse one it
[1:27:27] says in the philistines took the ark of
[1:27:29] god and brought it unto ebenezer into
[1:27:31] ashdod
[1:27:33] when the philistines took the ark of god
[1:27:34] they brought it unto the house of dagon
[1:27:36] and set it by dagon and when they have
[1:27:39] ashed out a rose early in the morning
[1:27:41] tomorrow behold dagon was fallen upon
[1:27:43] his face to the earth before the ark of
[1:27:45] the lord
[1:27:46] and they took dagon and set him in his
[1:27:48] place again
[1:27:49] i
[1:27:50] love this
[1:27:53] the israelites had lost the access to
[1:27:55] the word they lost it because they
[1:27:56] didn't hold it with any value anymore
[1:27:59] they were trying to use the word and
[1:28:00] make god amen fight for them when they
[1:28:03] had totally abandoned his word so they
[1:28:05] lost the word and the lord they went to
[1:28:07] the philistines the philistines brought
[1:28:08] into the house of dagon their god and
[1:28:10] they believed that their god had gotten
[1:28:12] them victory amen over the god of israel
[1:28:14] so they brought the ark in and the next
[1:28:16] morning when they come in dagon is flat
[1:28:18] on his face the image the idol bowing
[1:28:21] before his head came lower than the ark
[1:28:27] the ark's not very tall
[1:28:30] so when they brought it in dagon was
[1:28:32] lording over the word of god
[1:28:35] this false church this false doctrine
[1:28:38] this doctrine of devils was lording over
[1:28:40] the ark but by the next morning dagon's
[1:28:43] head was lower than the ark
[1:28:46] and he was bowing at the feet of the ark
[1:28:50] so what did they do
[1:28:52] what any good denomination would do they
[1:28:54] picked dagon back up
[1:28:57] they brought their doctrine of
[1:28:58] trinitarian baptisms that women
[1:29:00] preachers and all that they set it back
[1:29:03] up
[1:29:04] so that it could lord over the word
[1:29:06] again
[1:29:09] praise god almighty
[1:29:12] amen
[1:29:14] verse 4
[1:29:16] and when they arose early tomorrow the
[1:29:18] tomorrow morning behold dagon was fallen
[1:29:21] upon his face to the ground before the
[1:29:22] ark of the lord and the head of dagen
[1:29:25] and both palms of his hands were cut off
[1:29:27] upon the threshold only the stump of
[1:29:30] dagon was left to him
[1:29:33] god said you didn't get the point amen
[1:29:35] so they set him back up and the next
[1:29:37] time he fell off came his
[1:29:40] head
[1:29:41] reasoning false understanding
[1:29:44] intellectualism now he took off his head
[1:29:47] and his hands when he reasoned and what
[1:29:50] he did is now gone the only thing left
[1:29:54] is a stump
[1:29:56] and that head can never lord over the
[1:29:59] word of god again god has taken his head
[1:30:01] off like david took the head of the
[1:30:03] giant off
[1:30:05] amen the head was defeated amen he took
[1:30:08] his head off and now they had a stump so
[1:30:10] what did the philistines do the only
[1:30:12] reasonable thing for a denomination to
[1:30:14] do they got the word out of their midst
[1:30:17] amen amen they now the word took off the
[1:30:20] head the wrong understanding of the
[1:30:22] wrong doctrine so they did the only
[1:30:24] reasonable thing for a denomination to
[1:30:26] do they said we can't have this word
[1:30:28] here anymore they put it on a cart and
[1:30:31] sent it back to israel
[1:30:34] instead of surrendering and humbling god
[1:30:37] took the head clear off of that thing
[1:30:39] and that's exactly what he did in this
[1:30:41] age he took the head off every false
[1:30:43] doctrine of trinitarian baptisms amen
[1:30:45] the wrong understanding of the godhead
[1:30:47] he took the head clear off of that thing
[1:30:50] and what did they do they wanted to now
[1:30:52] worship the stump and give offerings to
[1:30:53] the stuff and send the word of god away
[1:30:56] but oh thank god we're on the other end
[1:30:59] and we saw the word coming back to
[1:31:02] israel coming back to the people it
[1:31:04] belonged with us and it came back to us
[1:31:09] amen
[1:31:10] may we value what god has returned to us
[1:31:17] praise god let's turn to matthew chapter
[1:31:19] 8 and we're going to close
[1:31:21] with this couple thoughts here
[1:31:25] matthew
[1:31:27] chapter 8.
[1:31:37] and verse 19
[1:31:40] matthew chapter 8 verse 19.
[1:31:44] and a certain scribe came
[1:31:46] and said unto him master i will follow
[1:31:48] thee with the sword with thou goest and
[1:31:50] jesus said unto him the foxes have holes
[1:31:52] and the birds of the air have nest but
[1:31:55] the son of man hath not where to lay his
[1:31:59] head
[1:32:02] jesus come to earth and when he was
[1:32:04] there there was no place for his head to
[1:32:06] rest
[1:32:08] so where will his head find
[1:32:11] rest
[1:32:13] let's go to acts chapter 7.
[1:32:19] acts chapter 7
[1:32:23] verse
[1:32:24] 48.
[1:32:26] in acts 7 48 it says
[1:32:30] how be it the most high dwelleth not in
[1:32:33] temples made with hands as saith the
[1:32:34] prophet
[1:32:35] heaven is my throne and earth is my
[1:32:37] footstool what house will you build me
[1:32:41] saith the lord and where
[1:32:43] is the place
[1:32:44] of my rest
[1:32:48] when jesus was here there was no place
[1:32:50] for him to lay his head
[1:32:52] because there was no place for him to
[1:32:54] lay his head
[1:32:55] amen
[1:32:56] they they missed their opportunity
[1:32:59] amen and we know
[1:33:01] that the headship in our day has come
[1:33:03] down
[1:33:05] now
[1:33:06] jesus says when the son of man returns
[1:33:08] will he find faith in the earth why
[1:33:10] there has to be a place for that head to
[1:33:13] rest
[1:33:14] not with temples made with hands but a
[1:33:16] body house that prepared me and where is
[1:33:18] my place of rest amen where will the
[1:33:21] headship rest the headship will rest on
[1:33:23] the body where's the body i believe with
[1:33:26] my faith i'm part of it i'm looking at
[1:33:28] part of it amen where the head now can
[1:33:30] come to rest the devil has been fighting
[1:33:32] to put his head above the word amen but
[1:33:35] the word has come back in the headship
[1:33:37] this day to take its proper place amen
[1:33:40] at the top amen and bringing every other
[1:33:43] headship down back to the ground and
[1:33:45] under the feet of this body
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:52] praise god
[1:33:54] jesus asked him a question in matthew 21
[1:33:56] he said did you never read in the
[1:33:58] scriptures
[1:33:59] the stone which the builders rejected
[1:34:00] the same has become the head of the
[1:34:02] corner
[1:34:03] this is the lord's doing and is
[1:34:05] marvelous in your eyes
[1:34:07] and he never explained anything
[1:34:11] he said you're missing did you ever hear
[1:34:13] he he points them to a scripture and
[1:34:15] doesn't explain it
[1:34:17] i think he preached the same way when he
[1:34:19] was preaching through the seventh angel
[1:34:21] pouring through a scripture and never
[1:34:23] said did you ever consider this do you
[1:34:24] remember that scripture
[1:34:26] then he moved on and he said the
[1:34:28] headship is here the cornerstone amen is
[1:34:31] here
[1:34:32] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:34:33] revealed he said as the head was took up
[1:34:35] from the grave so must the body follow
[1:34:37] him into eden
[1:34:38] therefore the body cannot recognize any
[1:34:40] other headship but the headship of the
[1:34:42] word
[1:34:43] so the devil is trying every day to get
[1:34:46] you and i to get another headship other
[1:34:48] than the word
[1:34:50] and you think well i'm not leaving the
[1:34:51] message i mean i'm not going anywhere
[1:34:53] i'm going to be back here on sunday
[1:34:55] that's not the point if he can get you
[1:34:57] to think different about the word of god
[1:35:01] he's working in the mind he's not trying
[1:35:04] to get your body into another church
[1:35:06] amen he's not trying to get you to leave
[1:35:08] this church and go into the world he may
[1:35:10] do that next step the first step is to
[1:35:13] get you to reason in your mind about the
[1:35:15] word of god
[1:35:18] so the first step is to come in and try
[1:35:20] to get the headship of lucifer over your
[1:35:24] head
[1:35:28] and whenever we leave our god-given
[1:35:30] headship which is the revealed word for
[1:35:32] our day
[1:35:33] amen you cannot tackle this devil with
[1:35:37] your own head the only head that can
[1:35:39] take that head is the headship of christ
[1:35:41] that's come down in this day and if
[1:35:43] you're connected to that head that head
[1:35:44] is always over his head
[1:35:49] he said no denomination can put anything
[1:35:51] to it for whosoever shall take one word
[1:35:53] away from it or add one word to it it
[1:35:54] took away from it you're dead hybrid
[1:35:56] right there she's back here this
[1:35:58] testimony in her hands the filthiness of
[1:36:01] her fornications committing in spiritual
[1:36:03] adultery again the very word that she
[1:36:05] claims to believe
[1:36:07] therefore it is the word or nothing
[1:36:10] i believe we've come to that day
[1:36:13] it has to be for us the word or nothing
[1:36:17] he the word how do you know it's right
[1:36:19] he the word is vindicated he the word
[1:36:21] properly vindicated is the headship the
[1:36:24] head of the church he is the word i want
[1:36:26] to say is this word that's come to us in
[1:36:28] this day been properly vindicated
[1:36:31] that is the headship over the church
[1:36:34] he is the word the headship he is
[1:36:36] properly identified vindicated by his
[1:36:39] own spirit being in the church itself
[1:36:41] the person
[1:36:42] showing forth himself in vindication is
[1:36:44] the direct proof to the entire body you
[1:36:47] don't need creeds then denominations has
[1:36:50] perished but the headship itself
[1:36:52] recognized in the body by personal
[1:36:54] identifications what personal
[1:36:56] identification the sign of the messiah
[1:36:59] that he did thousands of times showed
[1:37:01] that the son of man was present it was
[1:37:03] christ he was brother branham said he is
[1:37:06] here
[1:37:07] he said it's not me you're touching it's
[1:37:09] him
[1:37:12] the body by personal identification is
[1:37:14] he identifying himself proves the
[1:37:16] headship to the body then we are united
[1:37:19] under one vindicated headship that is
[1:37:21] christ the word of god not under any
[1:37:25] church
[1:37:26] then our headship is a kingdom the
[1:37:28] kingdom of god is within you
[1:37:31] so now the headship is a kingdom and the
[1:37:33] kingdom's in you
[1:37:35] so where's the head
[1:37:38] where's the headship where where did
[1:37:40] that cloud go that came down in 1963
[1:37:43] that head is a kingdom and the kingdom's
[1:37:45] in you
[1:37:49] the kingdom of god is within you said
[1:37:50] the bible jesus the kingdom we are not a
[1:37:52] denomination we belong to a kingdom and
[1:37:55] the kingdom is the word of god made
[1:37:57] spirit and life in our life
[1:38:00] bringing to pass every promise in this
[1:38:02] day as it did in that day when the word
[1:38:04] and god was won and the word and god is
[1:38:06] one in his church today making it the
[1:38:09] headship of the body that is redeemed to
[1:38:12] bring the message in the last day and be
[1:38:14] taken up from the dead in the
[1:38:16] resurrection to go back and restore
[1:38:18] again as adam and eve in the beginning
[1:38:20] in the garden of eden the threefold
[1:38:22] mystery of god his body oh
[1:38:25] my
[1:38:27] that headship
[1:38:29] will lift you up upon a rock
[1:38:31] that headship would put your head above
[1:38:34] all the heads of your enemies that
[1:38:36] headship has taken the head off dagon
[1:38:38] that headship has taken the head off
[1:38:40] goliath remember when brother branham
[1:38:41] first went out and left his church to go
[1:38:43] into the field he said i'm going as
[1:38:45] david fighting goliath
[1:38:51] why
[1:38:52] because somebody had to take the head
[1:38:53] off that giant
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:38:56] that giant of unbelief
[1:38:59] and now there's another headship come on
[1:39:02] the scene
[1:39:03] colossians 1 17 says and he is before
[1:39:06] all things
[1:39:07] and by him all things consist
[1:39:09] and he is the head of the body the
[1:39:11] church
[1:39:12] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:39:14] the dead that in all things he might
[1:39:17] have the preeminence
[1:39:20] that's the second fold of the threefold
[1:39:22] purpose
[1:39:22] he wants to be the headship in our lives
[1:39:26] he wants to have the preeminence
[1:39:28] again in crisis the mystery of god
[1:39:30] revealed he says but i'm talking about
[1:39:31] the headship of christ
[1:39:33] notice being personally identified by
[1:39:36] the original headship
[1:39:38] we have the answer to the devil's
[1:39:40] question
[1:39:42] amen glory we have the answer to the
[1:39:44] devil's question he
[1:39:46] christ is risen and has paid the price
[1:39:48] and raised up the head or the body
[1:39:51] the devil can't stand it so what's
[1:39:54] happened
[1:39:55] the answer to the devil's question the
[1:39:57] brotherhood said it's not me it's him
[1:40:00] the answer to the devil's question is
[1:40:01] not me i'm not going to answer your
[1:40:03] question i'm not going to come back with
[1:40:05] you i'm not dealing with you the answer
[1:40:08] to the question is the headship has come
[1:40:09] and i'm united with the head and that
[1:40:11] head is over your head so there's
[1:40:13] nothing you're going to say to me
[1:40:14] anymore to get me to deviate from what
[1:40:16] the headship brought in this aid and now
[1:40:19] you you are brought under the feet of
[1:40:22] this body because the headship is
[1:40:23] attached to this body now and this body
[1:40:26] is risen higher than the false
[1:40:28] understanding of the word amen
[1:40:34] raised up the body the devil
[1:40:36] can't stand it
[1:40:38] he wants his head to be higher than your
[1:40:40] head
[1:40:41] but we're not relying on our our head
[1:40:43] we're attached to his head
[1:40:45] now we have no thought coming we just
[1:40:47] take the word
[1:40:51] devil can't say that that's the reason
[1:40:53] these ecumenical kingdoms are set up
[1:40:54] that's the reason they're all coming
[1:40:56] into what they're doing now the devil
[1:40:58] that's the reason he's howling the way
[1:40:59] he is his wickedness his scheme has been
[1:41:02] uncovered by the risen resurrected
[1:41:04] christ and the headship over his body
[1:41:09] and i say thank god for the word that's
[1:41:11] been restored thank god for the headship
[1:41:14] that has come down but the headship
[1:41:15] didn't come down amen to be a book on
[1:41:18] your shelf the headship come down to be
[1:41:19] a kingdom and that kingdom was to be in
[1:41:21] you and you attached to that kingdom
[1:41:24] that head has lifted you above the
[1:41:26] carnal amen and put the enemy under your
[1:41:29] feet amen not by your efforts but by the
[1:41:32] headship the original headship of the
[1:41:34] original word has come back and is
[1:41:36] connected to the body and now the
[1:41:38] headship is moving in the body finishing
[1:41:41] the work and defeating the devil by what
[1:41:44] by us believing receiving submitting to
[1:41:48] the word that's been restored in this
[1:41:49] hour
[1:41:51] how hard is it it's as easy as being
[1:41:53] able to say that's what he said
[1:41:57] i submit to it
[1:41:59] that's what the word of god says
[1:42:01] that's what's written in the word of god
[1:42:04] we'll take it that way
[1:42:06] what does that do
[1:42:08] that puts your head
[1:42:10] over the enemy's head
[1:42:12] and the minute you begin to say well i
[1:42:15] think that was brother branham's opinion
[1:42:20] say god brought us his word he restored
[1:42:23] the word he brought us back to the
[1:42:24] original teaching in the apostle paul
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:29] that's the headship
[1:42:31] the word
[1:42:33] that has come back to the church
[1:42:35] and that is what's lifting our head
[1:42:38] above the head of our enemy
[1:42:40] in this word that's been given to us in
[1:42:42] this day
[1:42:44] is the stone
[1:42:45] that'll go to the head of the enemy
[1:42:48] it is the tent stake that'll drive the
[1:42:50] head back to the ground it is the piece
[1:42:52] of millstone that you can roll out of
[1:42:54] the tower to break the skull of the
[1:42:56] enemy
[1:42:57] it all has to do with the mind battle
[1:43:00] and overcoming by a revelation of the
[1:43:02] word

[1:43:14] amen god gave us the very thing we
[1:43:17] needed to overcome
[1:43:19] and that was the opening of the word
[1:43:22] let's never neglect the opening of the
[1:43:24] word
[1:43:25] it was the secret ingredient that we'd
[1:43:27] been waiting for for seven church ages
[1:43:30] and now it's here
