[Applause] [Music] yes we're there in the spirit beholding his face we're gaining new power to ride [Music] as the pastor comes forward sing it hallelujah [Music] [Applause] spirits [Music] the once again glory god hallelujah to run [Music] amen what a privilege it is to have a place that we can shut in with god amen we can come here without distractions we're not in open air meetings we can come into a place that's designated and set aside for one purpose only and has to shut in with him to meet with him to worship him and to hear his word and so we're so thankful so privileged to have a place like that right now amen let's get right to the word this morning and i'm going to say it's such a pleasure to be here again i just accounted a privilege every time we're together amen i want to make a quick announcement before we turn to our opening scripture i just want to remind everybody that the men's meeting is coming up we're leaving this friday morning um we'll be traveling down together so there's a meeting going to take place immediately after this morning's service so if you're signed up and planning to go to the men's meeting please meet brother doug hatfield he's going to conduct the meeting for me he's got all the details brother doug hatfield over in the four year of the old sanctuary so if you just go down the hallway and meet him over there and he'll give you all the details for that so please remember that immediately after service also i want to say we had a really good time this weekend at meetings at true word tabernacle who had an opportunity to go friday or saturday what a blessing that was it was just a privilege and brother ron has such a gift of bringing i i say he has a gift of just raising your faith but it's not that he is a gift of challenging your faith to where you can say whoa what am i doing with the word right and then you recognize hey there's a whole lot more to this than what i've been applying and so i was really thankful for that we had a really good time there and appreciate that very much also i got a chance to talk to brother dwayne lawson and he's actually going to be home this week so that means he's going to be preaching here wednesday night so we've tried to make that work out for a long time and every time i talk to him he's out of the country or he's in the east coast west coast or in canada but he happened to be here so it's going to work out and then sunday while i'm with the men at the men's meeting brother brian locke is coming in to visit his family so brother brian lock's going to take the sunday service for us so that was just really good timing and so we really are excited to have him here also so that's wonderful we're looking forward to those times amen let's take our bibles and turn to isaiah chapter 61. read a portion of scripture while you're turning there i want to just make one more announcement communion would normally be this sunday which is the first of november but we're going to have 14 of the brothers myself and two deacons are going to be at the men's meeting so i decided to move it back one week so we're going to move it to the 8th of november so in this month in november we won't have commute on the first sunday it'll be the second sunday so we'll announce that again wednesday and also next sunday so please be aware of that all right isaiah 61 verse 10 and verse 11 i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decath himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with jewels amen let's read that again i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god i will greatly rejoice and my soul shall be joyful why because he hath clothed me in garments of salvation he hath covered me with robes of righteousness what kind of robes what kind of garments as a bridegroom decath himself for ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels that's kind that's the kind of covering that we have one that's prepared for the wedding for as the earth bringeth forth her blood and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth so the lord god will cause the righteous righteousness and praise to spring forth before all nations let's just pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord for your word god we're so thankful for a place to come and gather and to worship your name lord and we just pray right now lord that you would be the one that had preeminence lord god we haven't come to hear the words of a man we haven't come to hear the thinking of a man that's all pointless lord it's all vanity but we've come to hear from you god and we know that you've chosen a method to deliver your mind deliver your word and that's through the foolishness of preaching so we all right now this morning submit ourselves to that method that you've laid out in your word lord i submit myself to that as a vessel that you can use i pray god that i could just lay my thoughts to the side lord and that you would just use these lips of clay to speak eternal life to your children we ask that you'd be with us in every part of the service in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated amen this morning i want to i want to preach on the rise of the queen the rise of the queen as a subject and i'm going to have to break this down into a couple parts so the first part i just chose a subtitle of choosing a bride so the rise of a queen we're going to start with choosing a bride now brother branham said something in christ is the mystery of god revealed and i've read it here before but i thought it'd be good to go over again he said god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence jesus when he was on the earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even him the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven thunders uttered their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord so he's talking about this great secret and we went through this here the great secret was the coming of the lord it was the seventh seal and it was in a mystery form and that's what he's going to preach about here and christ is the mystery of god revealed but the next thing is what i want us to catch that's the one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he has showed it or revealed it in every type that's in the bible have we been seeing that amen that's what i want to look at again because i want to go through the story of esther this morning he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it now in these last days he will reveal it and that's not what the prophet said now in these last days he has revealed it and shows it and he's continuing to show it amen so we know that when we read the bible now the prophet of god told us we don't read the bible like we read a newspaper it's a love letter right when you read a love letter you read a love letter from somebody you have an intimate knowledge about and somebody that that you're in an intimate relationship with right now in in that kind of love letter i can pick up this love letter that somebody wrote to somebody else all right all right say girl wrote to boy this love letter so i pick up the love letter and most of it's going to be nonsense to me it's going to turn my stomach for the first first part i'm not going to enjoy it because nobody likes reading love letters that belong to somebody else it's nauseating but when it's your love letter oh my goodness we'll save it in a shoe box we'll put it on a thing we'll be 80 years old and we'll pull it back out and and and the perfume will still come off the love letter right because why it's your letter it's addressed to you so i can pick up somebody else's letter and read it and most of it's not going to make any sense to me because i haven't experienced these things with this person i don't know what they're referring to i don't know what those little secret messages are or what the in-between the line reading is amen but to the one who wrote it and to the one who's reading it they get it in this bible is a love letter written to the bride of jesus christ and a lot of people will read that and they'll either nauseate them or they won't have a clue what it's talking about but the bride it's for her she knows what it is and when she reads it she still gets twitter painted just the same as day one right amen it gets more real and it gets more vivid and it becomes more alive the more we read this because we're reading it by revelation and the revelation of the mystery is getting richer and richer and richer amen so i want to take a look at esther let's all of us turn together to the book of esther and i just want to pull a little bit out of esther on this rise of a queen we're all pretty familiar with this story and so there's a lot of types and shadows in the book of esther it's amazing for all the time that that people feel like there's a lot of people in the world condition today because we're in a world especially in the western hemisphere especially in western society that that believes the old ways are wrong and the new ways are better and and things from way back where our cake or medieval or in that in that the bible is part of that uh and some of the cause of that and they believe that the bible is hard on women and they believe the bible doesn't give equal rights and all this other stuff and they don't realize the bible talks about women all the time you've got esther and you've got ruth and you've got all these stories in the bible they just don't understand how special the woman type is in scripture she's not oppressed she's not pushed down amen the woman type is actually beautiful when you read it in scripture and understand it's always a type of the bride and when you catch that vision the bible talks a lot about women the bible promotes women the bible puts women in the right place because it's a beautiful position the problem is the modern thinking doesn't want a woman in that position she wants a woman in a different position and because the bible doesn't speak that way they think the bible's wrong but the bible's not wrong so let's go back here and look at the book of esther esther chapter one verse one and i want you to pay close attention to the revelation of the seventh seal amen all right what was the revelation of the seventh seal in three parts to get preeminence in a man to get preeminence in the bride the church and to restore the kingdom back king and queen back in in eden condition right that's the three parts of the great mystery three parts of the seventh seal amen three parts of the coming of the lord coming in the man coming in the woman man and woman coming together got it we've got king queen king and queen oh it's so simple we'll walk all over it if we don't catch it and see it in the scriptures so we want to take a look at the seventh seal here in the in the book of esther and i want you to pay close attention to the numbers amen because they tell us tell us a story now it came to pass in the days of ahasaros this is the soros which reigned from india even into ethiopia over 107 and 20 provinces that in those days when the king azaris sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shusha and the palace in the third year of his reign right not in the second year of a reign something's going to transition something that that is telling the story of redemption there's a story of redemption that's going to be told here and the story redemption doesn't happen in the second year it doesn't happen in the fifth year it happens in the third year brother branham told us that in the church ages that this church went down into the dark ages but through three stages was restored back jesus says destroy this temple and in three days i'll build it back amen and so now the church temple was destroyed by babylon to the dark ages but there was a remnant came out and rebuilt the temple and in three stages it came back amen so in the third year of this king of his reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants the power of persian media the nobles and the princes of the provinces being before him when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom in the honor of his excellent majesty many days even 104 score days that's 180 days and when these days were expired so i want to look at 180 days really quickly just very quickly the the old jewish calendar is 30 days to a month 360 days in a year so 180 days is exactly six months so he did this for six months but after six months when six months were expired now he's going to do something different when is he going to do something different in the seventh month hallelujah when when is the redemption finished in the feast of the lord in the seventh month you have trumpets you have atonement you have tabernacles the last part of redemption is in the seventh month when is atonement in the seventh month how many church ages are there seven it's completion amen so after 180 days he did this for 180 days and when they when these days were expired now we move into the seventh month and in the seventh month the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shush and the palace both unto great and small seven days my goodness brother brandon said if you missed the numerology in the bible you've missed the bible you go back and read it again this is all three and seven seventh month and seven days and and third year it's all the story of redemption all over again every story is a story of redemption amen seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace let's jump over to verse 10 on the seventh day not on the sixth day not on the fifth day not on the tenth day but on the seventh day when the heart of the king was married with wine he commanded muhuman vista harbana bigtha abagatha zether and carcus i hate reading names of the old testament especially in front of a crowd because somebody's be like that wasn't right i would have said that differently but we can trade places anytime you want to read names for me all right so he reads off these names the seventh he commanded these seven the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of alhassarus the king now there's a command going to seven chamberlains and chamberlains or eunuchs and eunuchs served in the presence of the king they didn't serve out in the kingdom these were the seven eunuchs that served in the presence of the king now what are eunuchs eunuchs are men that cannot propagate themselves they have no seed all right so they're only there to propagate the king's commandments not their own these are the servants of the king and their eunuchs they have no wife of their own they have no seed of their own they have no children of their own they're there to propagate the king's commandments these are the seven church age messengers the church age messengers weren't sent they come from the presence of the lord but they were not sent the seven spirits that are before the throne right come out in each age they were not sent out they meant to marry their church they were not sent out to propagate themselves they were not sent out to give their own word they were sent out to bring forth the decree of the king amen so these are seven chamberlains before the king to bring what is the purpose to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal for to show the people and the princess her beauty for she was fair to look upon amen but vashti but the queen vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlain's therefore was the king very roth and his anger burned in him now you notice when it was time for the queen to be presented on the seventh day it was time the king sent out a decree by seven chamberlains so it wasn't the king that went to the queen it was the chamberlain's that went to the queen with the king's message and vashti refused who the chamberlain's which means she refused the king to refuse the chamberlains is to refuse the king to refuse to seven church age messengers is to refuse the king amen he showed it in every type and shadow that's in the bible the same story over and over and over again once your eyes are opened they're open you can't close them again hallelujah what was vashti doing this whole time go to verse nine go up to verse nine also vasti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king azaris now here is this mighty queen and this mighty queen has decided to take upon herself to have a feast while the king's having his feast while things are going on for six months into the seventh month she's doing her own little work over here on the side and she's having a feast with the women or with the churches now she decides to have an ecumenical council now she brings in vatican ii amen are we paying attention so now this queen is supposed to be the queen now she's having the feast with women that's why denomination is is homosexuality because it's churches dominating churches women dominating women they have no seed no propagation amen you only get that from the king amen that's why you can't be born again by connecting to the eunuch you can't be born again by marrying the messenger only by connecting to the king because the eunuch doesn't have seed but the king does amen so now vashti's having her little banquet with the women now the king sends the seven chamberlains the seven messengers the seven church age messengers over and she refuses the king is not happy but look at the response of the king but the queen in verse 12 refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains how does she refuse the king by his chamberlains how did the command of the king come by his chamberlains and when she refused to heed the call of the chamberlains she refused the king therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him don't think that you're going to refuse him this day and not face judgment amen it didn't work in that in this day in the book of esther and it's certainly not going to work in this day when god when god has sent back all seven spirits and seven thunders in the last day and revealed the whole thing in a mighty way and basically he sent all seven chamberlains in this day the full message the full revelation all seven thundering out in consecutive order and all seven have come to bid the queen to come and she refused and don't think that you're gonna refuse today and expect anything different whatsoever because grace is found in listening to the chamberlains grace is found in the commandment of the king not in doing whatever so ever we think we want to do now now the word vashti means beautiful the actual interpretation of vashti is beautiful and i want you to turn with me the revelations chapter 17. we're going to find vashti in the scriptures revelation 17 starting at verse 3 so he carried me away in the spirit in the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication we know that this is the catholic church in verse five it's called mystery babylon and mystery babylon is the catholic church who's a mother of harlot she's a and she's a mother of harlots which are the protestant systems the denominational systems are horn harlots but look how beautiful she was she's a red and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand she's not ugly she's not scary looking she doesn't look hideous and nasty like a witch she's beautiful so much so that john he marveled he looked upon her with great admiration he was astonished she was so beautiful to behold but she was beautiful but she was wrong vasti was beautiful but vashti was wrong let's go over to revelations 18 and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having a great power and the earth was lighted with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the greatest fallen is fallen has become the habitation of devils in the hold of every foul spirit in a cage of every unclean and hateful bird that's the condition according to the scripture of the catholic church that's what they are now fallen and the hold for every devil an unclean spirit for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornications and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich to the abundance of her delicacies we've been watching that happen we've been watching the kings drunk with their fornications they got drunk at the united nations they got drunk at the white house they got drunk in congress when the pope showed up believing his lies and his deceit and heard another voice thank god for another voice there's one that declares the condition of the church systems but there's also another voice giving instructions on what to do about the conditions and another voice and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works and the cup which she hath filled filled to her double how much she has glorified herself who's been glorified she is now vashti forgot who her husband was vashti forgot how she became a queen because she became a queen by marrying the king not of her own merit not of her own worth and not she didn't rise to queen all by herself you can't be a queen without marrying the king and she forgot how she got to her position amen now the church here in revelations 18 has forgot who would ever make her special who would make her the queen now she's glorified herself and lived deliciously so much so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow do you think that the great churches of the systems and the great denominational system churches and the and the great uh catholic church do you think they're going to see destruction in this age do you think they're that they think they're gonna miss the rapture and fall into tribulation no i sit as a queen i am no widow and i will see no sorrow next verse therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong as the lord god who judgeth her her destruction will come in one day when russia drops a nuclear bomb on the vatican and her destruction will come in one day the scripture will be fulfilled let's go back to revelations 3. and look at the condition of the church verse 14 and unto the angel the church of laodicea write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou work cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing same condition in the entire church age that we find in mystery babylon because the has passed it to the harlots and the harlots has passed it through the waters that she sits over through the people nations and tongues and now the people in this age and people that are still stuck in laodicea the age that we're living in in the natural life the people in that age they're still saying saying i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing he's not talking about a natural condition he's talking about a spiritual condition they're not saying i'm rich with money and all this he's talking about the spiritual condition they believe spiritually they're rich they believe spiritually they're increased with goods and spiritually they have need of nothing and he's going to point out the spiritual condition noah's thou not thou art wretched and miserable poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see amen let's go back to esther queen vashti means beautiful amen she had worldly beauty she had no character verse 19 still in chapter one of esther if it pleased the king let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes so now there's a problem what are we going to do about this vashti and i want to back up here for just a minute to verse 16 because i want to show something that's amazing in verse 16 it says and mummakin answered before the king and the princes vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of king hazaris now it's it's amazing there are seven princes that sit before the king and help him rule and in seven princes the last prince or the seventh prince is this mummikin and mummakin is the one who catches the revelation of the significance of this event it's interesting it wasn't the third one mentioned it wasn't the fourth it wasn't the fifth it was the seventh prince consists do we see the consistency in the scripture the seventh one he's the one who catches the significance of this event and he's the one who comes up with the solution right and here's part of the solution in verse 19. if it pleased the king let there go out a royal commandment from from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes that it be not altered that vashti come no more before the king and hazaris and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she how are you going to get better than vashti vashti's beautiful vashti is the most beautiful vasti's got it all how are you going to be better than vashti there was one place that vashti was decrepit and that was in character she may have had wealth she may have had a good bloodline she may have had beauty that nobody could match but she had no character because character would have given her the heart to obey the command of the king because that's the true test of character let's go to chapter 2 verse 2 then said the king's servant that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shush and the palace to the house of the women unto the custody of haggai the king's chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things be for purification be given them and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti and the thing pleased the king and he did so now this is a great idea he's got a wonderful idea let's gather fair young virgins from all over and let's put him in the house of the women with haggy eye haggai's another eunuch another eunuch that is a servant of the king another one that has no seed now he's the keeper of the women of who the fair young virgins what's his job prepare them to meet the king who do you think this is malachi 4 you got it brother revelations 10 7. this is haggai the chamberlain the eunuch that that is in the service of the king keeper of the house of women and what's he doing what's his ministry he's preparing them to meet the king why because somebody's going to get married in the seventh month vashti's going to be refused in the seventh month because he refused a king and somebody's going to get married in the seventh month one of these fair young virgins is going to get married but they've got to go through haggai the keeper of the women first nobody just walks into the presence of the king unprepared you've got justification the calling of the virgins you've got sanctification the house of purification with haggy eye and then you've got the baptism of the holy ghost the night with the king amen it's all in esther and it's been there for how many thousands of years but it's been laying there as a love letter so that in the last days a little bride can pick it up and say that's me i'm looking in the mirror that's me mama that's me i'm esther i'm not bestie i know i'm not vashti because i won't refuse the king amen how do they refuse to king refuse the chamberlains refused the chamberlains he refused the king so now we've got to find one that pleaseth the king now the king is not this time looking for beauty he had beauty vashti wasn't put away because she wasn't beautiful enough vashti wasn't put away because she wasn't perfect in every natural sense of the word perfect vashti wasn't put away because her bloodline wasn't good enough vashti was not put away because she didn't have the right mannerisms to be queen because she didn't have the the right mode of conduct or the right kind of speech and language she had everything it took to be a good queen she was put away for one reason and one reason only amen and these church systems of this age have been put away for one reason and one reason only is because they refused the king amen so he's not looking for another one with a royal bloodline amen he's not looking for another one that knows how to say all the right words knows how to conduct themselves in royal court knows how to put on the royal apparel and the one that's more beautiful than all the others that's not what the king wants what he's looking for now is somebody that will not refuse him oh this is good this is good this is the king's choosing of a bride amen i love it so much brother branham says in the choosing of a bride now when you see a church that's in the world acts like the world anticipating in the world partaking of the world counting god's commandments as if he never had wrote them you don't have to look very far to find that as if he had never wrote them then you can just imagine christ ain't going to take a bride like that could you imagine taking the modern church today for a bride not my lord i could hardly see that no remember now a man and his wife are one what's brother branham teaching and choosing of a bride he comes to choosing of a bride and what he's showing is that a man will select a wife that will reflect his own character think about that now he's typing in the natural but he's trying to type the natural to the spiritual he's trying to show christ is not looking for a bride just any old bride he's not looking for the most beautiful the church or the biggest number of people or those that can say it all right that can pronounce all the words and have the bible memorized he's not looking for that he's looking for a bride that reflects his very own character brother brahm said if you go and and you take just any old thing off the street and a man would just choose a woman that would live any old kind of unclean life and marry her it shows what's inside of him he's reflecting his own character by his choice for a wife now if that's true in the natural when it's true in the spiritual god cannot choose just any old thing and join himself to it because she wants to join the hymn no no no because he's got his character to uphold he's not going to join himself to anything that will not reflect his own character that's why vashti had to be put away because she refused the king and he's going to find one that won't refuse him the book of acts speaking out the choosing of david for king acts 13 21 and afterward they desired a king and god gave unto them saul the son of kish a man of the tribe of benjamin by the space of forty years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after my own heart what did david do reflected the king's character a man after mine own heart a man that reflects my character he said i shall choose them a king of my choosing right so samuel went with the anointing oil to help choose the king so he went to the house of jesse in iliad the firstborn walks in and he he's everything a king should be everything a king should be head and shoulders broad shoulders he's a fighting man big full beard he's ready to go the one they can respect the one that the armies can follow behind samuel goes to put the oil over his head and the lord says stop i've refused him man sees on the outward but god sees the hearts so if god's looking in the heart what's he looking for he's looking for what david had not what eliav had not what saul had he's looking for what david had in acts he says i have found david the son of jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will that's what he's looking for that's the character that he wants amen he's not looking for beauty he's not looking for broad shoulders he's not looking for somebody that can command the respective men he's looking for somebody that will respect him and his word and his commandments that's where saul failed but that's where david was successful so what's the king looking for looking for character brother ben finishing this quote from choosing of a bride and then how about god joining himself to something like that a regular denominational prostitute you think he would do it having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof he would never do it amen there's a scripture in the old testament i didn't pull it up so you'll have to find it later it says in that day seven women shall grab a hold of one man and say we will eat our own bread and we will basically take care of ourselves only give us of thy name what did they want they wanted the benefits of the name they wanted the benefits of the relationship but they really wanted to do it their own way amen and there's been seven church ages so seven women have all treated the lord the same way they've grabbed a hold of him and said we'll eat our own bread we'll do our own thing only give us of your name and they've taken the name and they've attached it to the church the church of jesus christ the church of christ church of this church of death brother branham said those are blasphemious names why are they blasphemous names because the church doctrine is blaspheming the word of god blaspheming the holy ghost and so they've taken his name amen but they've not married to him they've not submitted to him they've not given up their life they still want to eat their own bread and go their own way if you want to understand denominationalism that's it right there give us your name but we'll do our own thing amen that's what vashti thought she could do it didn't work so she was put away he would never do that back in choosing of o'brien she must have his character in her she must have his character in her the real true born-again church must have the character that was in christ because the husband and the wife are one and if jesus did only that which please god kept his word and manifest his word his bride will have to be of the same kind of character she could she could not by no means be a denomination hallelujah you know what i love that we have a voice in this day that will stand against every other voice that's speaking amen brother braham said in end time evangelism god's looking for character not membership character eliezer when he went to get the bride for isaac he sweated it out until he found character that's the end time message he and the bride god's looking for character and then after eliezer found the character then the next thing was getting her ready to go that's the same now brother the same now brother branham's ministry was the ministry of eliezer what was his ministry to find and bring a bride to isaac amen then he says in god hiding himself in simplicity first message when he preached the series on the seals he's talking about the dedication of the of the tabernacle he says may it be a consecrated place to our lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people i trust it will always be a house of god's beauty a house of god of beauty amen let's pick up our story back in esther again we're in chapter two let's go to verse five because esther is about to step on the scene now esther doesn't step on the scene until after vashti's refused now in shusham the palace there was a certain jew whose name was mordecai the son of jar the son of shemiya the son of kish a benjaminite another thing that i find interesting in the in the story of redemption that's in esther here is somehow esther's rise to the throne has something to do with the tribe of benjamin that's amazing because brother branham calls 144 000 that are redeemed out of the nation of israel by the two prophets in revelations 11 he calls them the tribe of benjamin the 144 000 the little benjaminites amen so now i mean mordecai could have been from any tribe right there's 12 to pick from he happened to be a benjamin because the queen and the 144 thousand their destinies are interlocked amen that's verse down to seven and he brought up hadassah that is esther his his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter so now we find out where esther comes from now esther is going to be selected when all these fair virgins are selected and she's going to go into the house now let's look at this story in in verse 13. then thus came every maiden to the king whatsoever she desired was given to her to go with her out of the house of the women into the king's house in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned in the second house of the women to the custody of sheches the king's chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name now i want to look at this in verse 13. she goes to the house of women which is oversaw by haggai the king's chamberlain and the king is there or the chamberlain is there to make sure that the women go through the purification process that's his job to make sure they have everything they need for purification that means they have all the spices and all the oils and all the baths and everything they need and he took esther and esther found favor in his eyes and he set her in a good part of the house with seven maids of her own she had seven maids so he he puts her there and and he's giving the all the fair young virgins they're all getting what they need to prepare to go in and meet the king because they can't just walk in and meet the king they can't just come off the street and meet the king there has to be a preparation so that they could become one with the king so they're going through a sanctification process and they're going through a purification process that they go into the king amen but it says whatsoever when it came time for her to go into the king now she's had whatever hegei uh had ordered for her for the purification process the ointments and the oils and the perfumes and the baths and whatever the hair care products whatever they got the best of the best i'm sure i mean it was a salon and this salon lasted 12 months how many manicures can you get in 12 months all right so the purification process was 12 months long and they had everything that they ever needed before they went to the king but there was also this stipulation whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women into the king's house so her free moral agency was never taken away she could take with her to go stand before the king and to meet the king to see whether the king is pleased with her or not she could take anything she wanted with her god has never taken away our free moral agency but our free moral agency is a test always has been and always will be what is it that you want to take with you to the presence of the king what is it that you want to hold on to is it a relationship is it a friend is it a husband is it a wife is it a son is it a daughter what are you trying to drag with you into the presence of the king because you can take whatsoever you want amen amen now verse 14 in the evening she went and on tomorrow she returned so she came out of the house of hagia the house of the women for preparation she went to meet the king and then the next day she went to the house of concubines except that was the process here to here to here except she came into the kingdom more except the king delighted her and that she were called by name now when it comes to the choosing of a bride this is so good i can't hardly stand it when it comes to the choosing of a bride it's haggai's job to find the virgins to get them in the house and to make sure that they're ready for their encounter with the king but these virgins are never they've never lost their free mortal agency they can go stand there in any condition they want they can take anything they want with them and then it's not haggai who chooses it's the king himself who chooses the bride by calling her name oh haggai can't pick the bride haggai he may have his favorites he may have his list of top ten he may know who the top two contenders are in his mind but haggy i can't choose the bride only the king can choose the one that pleases him and if he has chosen her she'll know because she will be called by name oh it gets so exciting i used to read the book of esther i had no idea what it was about just a neat little love story right that's so neat that little common girl and also she's a queen that is so neat and now with the greater revelation to go back and read esther and i'm looking in the mirror and i'm saying that's me that's me i've been in the house of purification i've been chosen many are many are called but few are chosen i've been called to the house of virgins i've been justified i've been sanctified through the purification process been i went to my encounter with the king brother bam talked about a fourth step the fourth step you know pentecost got a baptism of the holy ghost pentecost got an encounter with the king but they weren't allowed to marry him something beyond a night with the king is going to take place somebody's going to get their name called and somebody's going to be the queen hallelujah let's just look at this calling a name for a minute before we get there no let's look at calling a name questions and answers on the seals they had a question about who will be saved and he says nothing will be saved only those whose names were written and put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world jew or gentile see that's all the book holds the mystery and the book is unfolding it now he's in question and answers in the seals between the 6th and 7th seal the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names what's calling the names the unfolding of the mystery of the book you understand that now the book doesn't say now leave all's to be saved in the time of this church age or ormond neville or whoever no it don't say that it just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is but we ourselves by faith believe it what's he talking about the calling of your name how is he calling your name by revealing the mystery in the seventh seal book and the mystery unfolds the names that are in the book and it's not that you look down and you not see lee veil will come out it's not that kind of reading of a name but the unveiling of the book is calling your name who's calling your name was it hagiai no it was the king how many people heard about the unfolding of the book how many people heard about what was taking place and they didn't hear their name but there's a few people on the earth when they heard the unfolding of the book they heard more than there's a white horse rider they heard more than a red horse ride they heard more than souls under the altar they heard their name they said i'm there that's me that's my redemption that's my title deed what do we find we found our position in the book not because i looked over and read it not because brother branham said chadlam will be here he'll come in 1977. no when it was my time in the presence of the king i heard my name why how by the unfolding of the mysteries hallelujah let's go back to our scripture verse 15. now when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her daughter was to come to go into the king now listen she had free moral agency every other woman could take whatsoever she desired through the presence of the king but listen to what esther chose to take she required nothing but what haggai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed not her own idea not her own thought not another relationship not a denominational way of thinking not somebody else's idea on it she when she went to her encounter with the king she took only only only what haggai the chamberlain the keeper of the women the prophet of the seventh age the seventh messenger only what he appointed nobody else goes into his presence like that except for the bride esther's the only one everybody else has their own little idea of what of what god likes or what will please the king or god just loves me or i'm so sweet and i'm so special he would never refuse me he had that in vashti he ain't looking for it again that's why they were given permission to take anything they wanted with them to the presence of the king oh he'll like this little lipstick and he'll like this eyeshadow he'll like these heels he'll like this little dress he'll like this and haggai you know what not one of these virgins have ever been in the presence of the king before but guess who's been there guess who knows what the king likes guess who's the one who's actually been in this presence guess who the one that the king gives commandments lift to ear to it's the haggai it's not the virgins they've never one time ever one time had the lord speak to them directly but haggai has and so now these foolish virgins think that they know what's going to please the king and the hagia is an old crank and he don't know but i'm so special he'll choose me the king had that in vastly and the king doesn't want it no more and he doesn't want it today what he wants is an esther who will step up a fair young virgin who's went through a purification process in the house that haggai is watching over that'll step up and require nothing but what came from that prophet because he's been there and he knows what he's talking about that's why every denominational system has failed because she goes in in her own thinking mix her idea with the word of god and come out with something polluted and produced another vasty well the king went through that once he ain't going through it again amen we know we know that this chamberlain knew what he was talking about we know this chamberlain's been behind the veil he's been to the inner chamber he's seen the high court of the lord he's seen the book in his hand he's seen it open he knows exactly what he's talking about so esther's sitting there i i don't know i'll just take what he said and not add my own interpretation to it i'll just take what he said when it's my time to encounter the king hallelujah you see the fallacy of leaving this message behind it's a virgin trying to put lipstick and rouge on herself to please the king she has no idea what the king likes but haggai got the commandment lip to ear and he knows what the king likes that's why in the natural type it's so foolish that we still have to play games with how long this long hair and how much makeup and makeup and how short is my skirt just listen to what haggy i said he's been there he knows what he's talking about but we've got our own ideas about this oh well this is okay and that's okay how do you know it's okay you don't know it's okay listen to the one who knows amen we would rather walk a line to please man than run away from the line to please god that's exactly what all that is is just trying to get some some approval from our fellow sister or brother who cares about your sister and brother haggie i told you how to get approval from god she required nothing but what haggai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the woman appointed and esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her so esther was taken into king alhazaras unto the house royal guess when in the 10th month which is the month tebus in the seventh year of his reign you mean she went in in 10-7 when did she go in in 10-7 you mean like revelations 10 7 when the mystery of god is revealed that's when she goes into the king absolutely because that's when the mighty angel comes down to what join himself with the bride so she went in in 10-7 when was atonement in the 10th month or in the 10th day of the seventh month leviticus 23 when it speaks of the day of atonement it flips him and says not in the seventh month and on the tenth day no it says in the tenth day on the tenth day of the seventh month because redemption and atonement is completed in 10-7 amen it's come to fullness in 10-7 and esther goes into the king and 10 7. oh do you read the love letter now are you reading it is this your love letter are you reading between the lines who cares about a day and a month i'm hearing 10 7. hallelujah i found my place in 10 7. i heard my name called in 10 7. what about you i had my encounter with the king in 10-7 what about you amen praise god she went to the house row in the 10th month which is the month tibet in the seventh year of his reign and the king loved esther above all women all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that she said he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti oh we got a queen in this day thinks she's a queen says i said a queen and have need of nothing and no sorrow will come to me she doesn't know she's already been dethroned and he's already selected another queen and he's about to reveal it to the whole world amen praise god now vashti went in she required only those things that haggy i appointed that was her perfume that was how she did her hair that was the clothing she wore the kind of shoes she had all of that was determined by haggai brother branham says in the present stage of my ministry he says i hope i hope he will crown my ministry of this of letting me take the close of the word and dress his bride brother brent of saying in 1962 before the seals and he's here in september and he's going to get the vision for christ as a mystery in december just a couple months later and that that's going to bring out the sequence of events that's going to bring the opening of the word the opening of the seals he says i hope he will crown my ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the clothes of the word for his righteousness what else are you going to put on what else are you going to put on you're going to have a baptist leave and a pentecostal skirt and a catholic top it's not going to work but this haggai his crowning of his ministry was to give clothes the right kind of garment spiritual now he's not talking he's not talking about spiritual the right kind of clothing so that we can be clothed in the wedding garment to meet the king oh there is no other way outside this message none i'll say it every day i'll say it every time i get in the pulpit there is no other way to meet and be accepted by the king outside of this message because it was the preparation work it was the work in the house of the women it was haggai who knew who had been in the inner chamber who knew how to prepare esther for her meeting with him and it's all about character why could esther and not all the other women just take what haggy i said how come all the other women had to take a little extra or do a little something else they had no character they might have all been beautiful but it doesn't matter the king already had beauty now he's not interested in beauty now he's interested in character that's why he's not looking for a big church or a denomination or this that or the other there's no organization there's no big system there's no great programs we ain't got it and we don't want it we only want that which haggai has appointed amen the choosing of a bride brother branham's talking about he makes a funny story about a cow how many remembers don't get all offended sisters he's just trying to make a type he says he was with this rancher and this rancher would look to buy beef cows to raise steers and he said he'd look at her you look her up and down and then he'd take and he'd turn her head and look her in the eye he said sometimes he'd just shake his head and walk away he said yes they said jeff why are you why you look that cow on the face she looks all right to me he says she may be all right she may be beef come to the hoof but if she's got that wild stare in her eye what was the rancher looking for character said she'll never be a mammy she'll never sit still she'll run the fences all this other stuff and brother bam says i think i learned a lesson about women he said you better too brother because if you get one with that wild stare in her eye she'll never be a mom she'll want to go work in some man's office she'll want to go do this that and be the head of the house and go do her own thing amen that won't make a christian home amen so he said you better watch and brother branham is typing this to christ in the bride he's taking the naturals about choosing a man would choose his bride reflect his own care and he's typing that right in to christ and the bride how christ is choosing a bride and he's chosen her predestination all right but in his predestinated thought he's always got this testing time right always has this testing time where you've got to be tested all right and and esther went through her testing time with hagiai and her approaching to the king but he's got to have this this testing time where if she meets the conditions then he's going to do something special he's going to call her name when after she's come into his presence and after she's met the condition now just as soon as the king makes his choice the moment the king makes his choice every other virgin is a concubine he's only got one bride doesn't matter how many how good the church is it doesn't matter how good the system is it doesn't matter how much they got right just as soon as he comes to choose a bride every other thing becomes a concubine amen because only one is going to bear fourth seed brother brandon i want to back up just a minute and i want to talk about what we talked about here i think it was last sunday and last sunday when we talked about redemption and the work of the high priest i believe it was last sunday and how the high priest would go on behind the mercy seat and do seven sprinklings of blood and and when that was done it was for the ignorance of the people and then he would come around and there'd be seven spring things before the throne and we showed how how jesus had been doing that work down through seven church ages do we remember that are we on the same page and how when he comes forth now now on that day of atonement he he takes the the simple garment because he's got royal robes the high priests have royal robes right and the high priest has a glorification he's got all the special things that that he wears but on the day of atonement he takes all the glorification off and puts on a simple linen garment for atonement and that was when when when christ came in the form of the lamb which was jesus the flesh man and then he does the work of the high priest and he's done with the work of the high priest when atonement's finished he takes off the simple linen garment and he leaves it in the sanctuary and then he comes out to the people and when he emerges from there they know that their sins are gone that atonement's been successful and all the sins of the nation are gone it's been no different in our day amen all right so we had that we talked about the lion and the lamb you've got to separate the lion and the lamb because these are both attributes of christ right he says behold the lion of the tribe of judah he has prevailed amen he's worthy to take the book and loose the seals thereof and he said when i turned and look i saw a lamb as it had been slain the lion prevailed but the lamb standing there because the lion and the lamb are the same person it's christ the lamb is the flesh body of jesus christ is the christ the logos of god from the beginning we got that so now on this day of atonement or this great work and atonement in heaven is complete after seven church ages now he takes off the simple linen garment and the lamb jesus stays in the sanctuary we got that all right so if the lamb stays there who was it that came out the lion of the tribe of judah the king what what's he doing why did the king come and what's the purpose of the king coming and the breach between the seven churches and the seven seals he said he's done his kinsmen work you know what the kinsmen work was to testify before the elders you remember boaz kicked off a shoe and so forth he's done all this now he's talking about the breach he's talking about revelation chapter five when the lamb comes and opens the seals he said he's been doing the kinsmen work now he types it with boaz doing the work of kinsmen redeemer now when did boaz marry ruth was it before the work of redemption during the work of redemption or after the work of redemption after he was finished after boaz had fully redeemed then boaz after he paid the price how he made the concrete through he done everything he had to do then he comes and he takes ruth and he marries ruth right here brother branham saying he's done all this now now he comes to take his bride he comes now as a king who the lion of the tribe of judah revelations 10 the mighty angel came down and when he when he thundered he roared as when a lion roareth why did he roar because he's not coming as the lamb that's the corporal body meeting in the air at the rapture he's coming now as the lion the king he comes now as a king he's looking for his queen in this book is the whole secret of it wrapped around seven seals seven seals waiting for him to come and the fifth seal actually in the christ is the mystery of god revealed webster says revelation to reveal webster says is to make known make known and especially webster says in divine truth the revelation means the revelation it's christ's way of making himself known to his church how do you hear your name called by the unfolding of the mysteries the mysteries are what christ then he says let me get this right then he says now somebody first seal now someday he rises from the father's throne and he goes to take his own throne now he comes forth to call a subject now how is he going to claim them now remember remember he's done the work of kinsmen redeemer the lamb remains in the sanctuary the lion of the tribe of judah the the theophany of god the fullness of the holy ghost comes down the lion of the tribe of judah comes down he's the king looking for his queen he's calling he's coming to claim his redeemed subjects first theory says he comes forth to call his subjects how is he going to claim them he's already got a book of redemption in his hand when that mighty angel in revelations 10 comes down what's in his hand an open book now the king comes and he's looking for a queen he's coming for his redeemed subjects how's he going to call him he's already got the book of redemption in his hand how is he going to find the queen he's already got the book of redemption in his hand do you get it yet he goes over to the goats they just look at the book they sniff it they might lick it then they turn away and go some other direction he comes over here to the cattle and he's approaching to the cattle mighty angel christ open book in his hand comes to the cattle they look at it he moves around to where their head is you know christ doesn't force feed anybody the holy spirit's a gentleman he'll just present the truth here's the book [Music] they turn and go another direction he takes it to the camels amen he takes it to all the beasts of the field but then one day he steps in front of a sheep and the sheep rips it out of his hands and gobbles it up what's he doing he's a king looking for his queen amen the prophet the angel that was with john tells john when he sees the mighty angel with the book in his hand john sees it john sees the mighty angel comes down here's the roar of the lot like like a lion roar and he's looking down and he sees him with his hand but john's not quite sure what to do but this messenger that's with john says go and take the book that's out that's in the hand of the angel so john goes to take the book and what does john say oh please angel sir if you could be so kind could i please maybe touch the book sniff the book flip a few pages of the book no john has already caught a revelation because the prophet of god says john caught a revelation that his name was in the book why was john shouting when the lamb took the book why was he shouting a fit that everybody in heaven everybody on earth and everybody under the earth heard him praising and worshiping god is because he realized that's his redemption he realized his name was in the book now john couldn't have looked over and actually read it brother bram said he must have read his name he couldn't because it was still sealed in his hand it doesn't come sealed till the six unsealed till the sixth chapter but he looks at it in something in john he realizes my name's in that book that's my redemption i'm part of that book and he already caught a revelation of where he belonged mighty angel comes down holding the book the voice tells him go take the book and he doesn't walk up and beg for it why doesn't he beg for it because he's in it if he's in it it's his he goes up and he says give me that book give me that book caleb he saw a mountain he wanted he went out and spied the land and he found a good place and you know the best pieces of ground are already already taken always already taken how many times you drive by a piece of ground oh i love that piece of crap oh it's sold of course it's sold it's a good piece of ground caleb sees a piece of ground and he really likes it only it's got giants on it it's got the sons of anakin on it all right he goes back in these other 10 worthless spies with no vision they say we can't take the land we can't do it and only him and joshua say we're more than able because of the word what's he standing on he's not looking down on his muscles right he's not looking at the length of his sword he says it's been promised he already told us we're more than able to take it it has nothing to do with caleb it has nothing to do with joshua has everything to do with god that's what the world has forgotten he's looking for a queen that pleaseth him we have totally lost our mind because the world is looking for a god that pleases them a god of my own choosing a god of my own desire a god that his affections my affections and his desires match my desires so now we've got a queen a woman trying to go grab a man and say give me your name but that's not how the queen's coming into power that's not the rise of the queen the rise of the queen is going to be the one that pleaseth him didn't say anything about what pleased esther do you ever notice that it never says one thing not one time does it talk about in her choosing in her preparation and are going to meet the king you know it never one time says what esther wants because what's more important what esther wants or what the king wants but we flipped our doctrine in this age where it's not about the king anymore now it's about me surely he'll accept little old me and trample over his word you're wrong he won't choose you he won't select you he won't unite to you he won't put a seed in you why because you have to please him not him please you you don't choose him he chooses you show me anywhere in the scripture says anything different than that so caleb was spying out the land these worthless spies they ruined it for him and so now he's got to wait 40 more years but moses tells him you can have that land that great mountain that you saw amen where the cities were and all the fruits and the vegetables and the it's yours all right so when they come into the land caleb goes up to joshua which is a type of the holy ghost because the holy ghost positionally places the people in the land we're positionally placed in the word and it's the holy ghost who tells us our position in the word so he goes to the holy ghost and caleb now remember caleb is a gentile his name is dog he's a gentile but he's a proselyte jew after several generations he's been grafted in to the tribe of judah grafted into the tribe of judah you know what we happen to be gentiles that were called dogs by the jews who have been grafted in by marriage to witch tribe judah because jesus sprang from judah we've been united to christ so by marriage we've been grafted into judah what's this story about caleb is it about caleb no it's about you it's about me it's a story of redemption all over again the gentile grafted into judah the dog oh i don't care what you call me call me a blasphemer call me a heretic tell me i'm off on the word but i know i know what's been promised to me in that land the rest of the spy is going to look caleb you're not even a real jew caleb didn't care caleb caught the revelation the rest of them failed so caleb goes to joshua the holy ghost and he doesn't say please sir may i yeah he doesn't say if it be okay if it would be according to your will and according to your kindness and not so bad and maybe a possibility that i could have what i want no he saw it already promised by a prophet moses had already told him it was his so he knew it didn't belong to joshua it didn't belong to any other tribe it didn't belong to any other church it belonged to him him it was his promise in the word it was his promise that was given to him by a prophet and he went up to joshua he says give me my mountain he's got poor etiquette his manners are atrocious he never said please and i don't remember hearing him say thank you because it was his he knew it was his he was already revealed to him it was his he was only claiming what was already his and so now the mighty angel comes with the book of redemption john already knows it's his so he comes to the angel and he says give me that book now the angel says take it and eat it all up eat it all up and in my belly it'll be bitter but in my mouth in my mouth it'll be sweet as honey now what would have happened if john had taken the book and been a little bit nervous about the bitter part and said i'm just going to take a little sample and i'm going to wait 24 hours and see what happens why do people come in the message and bail right back out why do people hang around for a little bit and jump ship they're just i just want to see what happens i just want to i want to see how bad it gets i want to see how bitter my belly really is oh that is bitter persecution and rejection and called names and family members think you went off the deep end and all kinds of other stuff amen and because it's bitter in the belly we jump ship but guess what it was too late for john to jump ship because before the bitterness hit his belly he had already ate it all up amen and the commandment isn't to nibble on this word the commandment isn't just to try it for a little while just to taste and see the commandment is to eat it all up the hard stuff the stuff you don't understand the things that look like contradictions the things that baffle your mind eat it all up and guess what in your belly it'll be bitter but that's okay because peter or paul told timothy timothy don't drink water only but why don't you take a little wine for your stomach's sake brother bam taught us that wine is the stimulation of revelation you want a cure for the bitterness in your belly you get a good heaping dose of stimulation of revelation you let god open your eyes at what this word is in your position in this word and it doesn't matter about the bitterness anymore because now i've got a whine i've got a revelation of what this is that makes me so happy brother branham says you ever see a drunk man he's happy he can fall in the ditch he could be soaking wet he could be cut and bruised people could be making fun of him but he's still singing because he caught the revelation he got the stimulation of the wine in our stimulation of the wine we can be cut and bruised and rejected and cast stones at and called all kinds of names it doesn't matter because if i'm drinking of the wine of revelation i'm happy and i'm still singing as i go along oh they might be chucking rocks at me and i'm so drunk on the word of god so stimulated by the revelation of who i am in christ that i can just sing hallelujah i can sing chuck a rock at me whizzes by my ear call me a heretic say i don't even know nothing about the bible and i say oh happy day oh happy day hallelujah there's a cure for the bitterness in your belly and it's the stimulation of revelation that comes from the father amen he's come with an open book what's he doing he's the king looking for a queen are you the queen that's going to unite with the king then take the book and eat it up the book isn't for anyone but the bride he said these mysteries will only be revealed to his bride it's the love letter it's the stimulation of revelation let's all stand amen it's a happy day brother branham says i just want to i just want to close with this a final thought as we walk away he said does god ever change his mind about his word he said you can't judge god by prosperity the world prospers balaam prospers by it but brother you judge god by his word he keeps his word and identifies it the truth so remember friend as long as you live don't you never forget this god doesn't change his mind yet he will bless he will let you go his permissive will why because they could take whatever they wanted out of the house of the women he never takes that option away amen he never takes his permissive will but he won't change his mind he won't change his plan he won't change his word for you no sir you've got to change esther wasn't there to change the king's mind esther wasn't in the house of the women for sanctification and purification she wasn't there under the tudor ship of haggai so that she could change the king's mind she was there under the tutelage of haggai so that she could be changed to match the king's desire this prophet of god came to prepare a bride for a rapture amen he came to get her clothed in the wedding garment he came to produce the purification word he came for everything why because he's here to change us to match his desire that's something the world has lost sight of we forget who we're worshiping and start worshiping ourselves you've got to change you can't have god's word to match your experience you've got to have your experience match god's word see that's the way you've got you say well i'm a good man god does this that or the other but do you keep his word that was the key for esther that was the character that the king was looking for he comes with a book in his hand what are you going to do about it he's come with the revelation of the seven seals he's opened the word he showed us the full mystery of redemptions complete and now it's available you know what he never shows you what he's doing while he's doing it he always shows us after he's done what about paying the price of redemption he's going to show us while he's doing it or after he's done what about atonement while he's doing it or after it's done he come down on the seven seals the opening seven seals to show us what he's already done now my question is this is a question only you can answer in your heart what does that mean to me because he's coming to call his redeemed subjects but how's he going to call him he comes with the book of redemption in his hand you mean if i'm his redeemed subject that that book of redemption is going to mean something to me you mean if i'm the queen it's not just you know sweet jesus loves everybody he loves you he loves me we're all going to heaven no that's not the message that calls the bride that's not the message that close the bride it's more than that is the message just something that your friends go to is the message something your parents go to it's a message something you're here with your wife or your husband just so you don't break up a home is it here because these are nice people is it here because this is a nice building is that what we're here for if that's what you're here for then it's not for you i don't mean to be rude but it's not for you if that book of life does not mean more than life itself to you then it's not for you if you're not willing to walk up to that mighty angel and said give me that book give me my mountain you know why caleb called for that mountain you know what he knew was on the mountain giants he knew there were giants on the mountain you know what he knew it was going to be bitter in his belly but he didn't care he didn't care about the fight he didn't care about the rejection he didn't care about the troubles all he cared about was his inheritance amen if you care about something more than your inheritance in the word of god something more than your position in christ then it's not for you but if that book of life if that open book thrills your soul if that word of haggai preparing you to meet the king and all the talk of the king and in the new jerusalem if that thrills your soul it's for you if you're willing to eat all the book then it's for you if you enjoy while you're eating it's sweet as honey in your mouth it's for you when the bitterness hits your belly and you cry out for the stimulation of revelation and get happy again it's for you then you're the redeemed you're the one that he's opened the book for you're the reason he's come with the open the book you're the reason that hackie i was here it's for you what's the evidence speaking in tongues that's not the evidence what's the evidence divine healing that's not the evidence what's the evidence i see my name in the book i see by revelation not because mommy told me not because somebody else told me but because he called my name when i hear it i know it's me when he talks about it i know it's me when the preacher talks about i know it's me i can't explain how i don't know how esther didn't know all the reasons why the king chose her all she knows is she heard her name and when she heard her name everything in her life changed have you heard your name let everything in your life change let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this word we thank you lord that you've opened our eyes and we see god i'm just so thankful lord that you chose to come my way one day and you showed me your open book lord and oh god i could have been any kind of creature i could have been any kind of person but lord you just put something down inside of me that has nothing to do with this body of flesh but that's something inside of me when i saw that open book i craved it i wanted it there's something calling out for it and god that's my testimony that's my name being called that's my redemption that's the voice of my redemption i believe it with all my heart oh god god i pray if there's anyone here who's not caught that revelation then lord under the anointing of the word that you would just strike their hearts with a revelation that it's for me that it's for me that esther wasn't there for esther the book of esther's there for me that caleb's not just a cute story in the old testament but caleb's my story oh god let it be real to us this morning oh we just give you our lives we ask that you would take us you would mold us into your character oh god change us lord from what we are to what you want us to be we're here to please you lord we declare today we are not here to please ourselves we are here to please you and you only lord cut us and shape us and mold us and make us to where we be nothing but pleasing to you oh god let this word just knock all of the all of the world off of us all of our own ideas let it fade away and let this word chisel us out to be a bride of jesus christ oh how we thank you god for redemption how we thank you for the revelation i pray that you'd pour out a whole barrel of the wine of revelation right now the stimulation that makes us so happy that makes us dance that makes us sing that makes us shout that makes us acts like fools lord because we've caught the revelation and it's stimulation like wine oh we ask your blessings lord as we part and go our ways keep us safe bring us again o god we love you and praise your holy name in jesus christ we pray amen amen what do you want to sing brother let's sing that this is my story this is my song is it your story amen is this your story from

doubt a lot of things but nobody can doubt your testimony because it's your testimony how your candle got lit when you recognized your name in the book oh praise god i'm happy stimulated by the revelation of the word oh there's a cure for bitterness there's a cure for difficulty there's a cure for the hardship that comes with with keeping the word the cure is the stimulation of revelation and why is it people bail under the bitterness because they failed the stimulation of the revelation they failed to let the revelation of jesus christ come and envelop their mind and show them themselves in the book i sing that song you ask me why i'm happy because i'll just tell you why because my sins they're gone how do i know they're gone he came with an open book in his hand when did he come the kinsmen redeemer can win after he paid the full price of redemption after he did the full work of atonement he came with an open book in his hand do i know i know i know i know my sins are gone because sin is unbelief and i believe it that's my confidence not i think it not i was taught it not even i understand it but i believe it that's the secret that's how you hear your name called
