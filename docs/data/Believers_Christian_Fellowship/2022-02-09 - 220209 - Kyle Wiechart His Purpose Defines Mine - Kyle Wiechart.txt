you may be seated for just a moment i have to talk a little bit so i don't get so nervous i uh happy to be back here and do demon an honor and a privilege hey buddy how are you man god bless you good to see you and uh always deem it an honor and a privilege that god gives me these little opportunities to say a few things to help you and to maybe strengthen you it's a i was telling brother john no matter how many times i think the older i'm getting the more nervous i get every time i come out here and i thought it was supposed to be the opposite way around i thought the more times you do something you're supposed to get more comfortable with it but it just doesn't seem to be the case with me so i but i think he created it in such a way that he always wanted a wife that was totally dependent upon him that she never grew confident in her own abilities but she always felt so inadequate to ever do anything good for him so then she constantly is reaching out for his hand saying lord grab it quickly because i don't know how to pat i don't know how to go down this path again right brother emmanuel just the way it goes as we get older we just we just realize we need him every day of every hour so um i uh wow again i sound pretty good again uh kind of deep um so i uh i i came back with a little color in me so i was told i wow you look alive so i wonder what i looked like before pretty rough apparently so we did go down to florida there for a couple weeks took my grandpa there at the passing of my grandma we needed to get him into a new environment for a little bit see some sunshine and go for some bike riding so we took him down there for a couple weeks and enjoyed the sun and you know enjoyed uh i thought i was feeling sorry for myself one day i had went out drink my coffee hoping to you know get some sunshine and walk down it's like 54 degrees and wind blowing i had to go back inside get my coat go back out looked at the weather it's only going to be a high of 65 feeling sorry for myself until i looked back home and it was negative 10 degrees and i realized i'm not going to garner any sympathy from anybody back home if i tell them i'm suffering down here in florida so but uh but we we felt bad for you i'll be honest i sound bad but we were happy to go a little bit and but more importantly we are happy to come home the kids were missing everybody we were missing everybody still no place like home and it ain't because of the geography i'll tell you that for sure it's you all people so i just appreciate that i did hear from brother chad they're having a good time and uh so i just i hope you it's okay with you i'm just gonna really be myself tonight i have a little thought just a real simple thing that i've been chewing on god won't let me go anywhere else i even prayed asking lord maybe maybe there's a little more you could give me i could go a little bit more but what else can i do i always want to be faithful to just say what he leads me to say i i'd feel uh i'd feel like i would be doing you a disservice if i just didn't say what i felt anointed to say it may be short but i believe it's what you want me to say and i'd rather be found doing that than putting together a masterpiece of 10 000 words that i just wasn't sure about and uh so if that's okay we'll just go right to this to the word tonight you may stand with me for a second and grab your bibles please turn to romans 8 28. romans 8 28 thank you musicians appreciate it very familiar scripture verse but i think it's good sometimes to go over these old familiar scripture verses they have something in them that can always give us encouragement and strength and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say of these things if god before us who can be against us amen will you bow your heads most gracious heavenly father we come before you again this evening with grateful hearts father and lord you you knew from before the foundation of the world that we'd be here tonight lord you know our situations you would know where we were in life you would know the difficulties you would know the the the failures in our life lord you would know all about it and lord you still provided away and you foreordained and you paved away that we would still be conformed into the image of your son you made it all work together for good father and lord we so appreciate and thank you lord for these opportunities that you give us and father i submit myself to you father thou knowest i am unable and i know it and lord i just pray that you could take my insufficiency move me out of the way lord i just want to be found saying something to help your dear children lord we sure love you we commit ourselves to you father just sit beside us wherever we are in the sea talk to us lord whisper in our ears father help us father we we have need of thee lord there's so many things so many distractions in this world there's such a a devil that's raging throughout the land and lord we can do nothing except you help us father so father encourage us strengthen us restore us father bring peace lord where there is none we love you we commit this time and our lives into your hands in jesus name amen you may be seated so well i uh i caught inspiration in florida again as you know i can't go anywhere without seeing inspiration in something and uh so i i asked the god if maybe that would be the the thing and and i can't seem to get away from it so i just would like to bring this little inspiration that i had when i saw something down in florida and i'm kind of one that i'm always watching things and i'm always looking for things not to try to make not try to be over spiritual i'm not trying to be that way but sometimes i notice something something will grab me or grip me and then it kind of gears my mind in a certain direction and i can't help it i'm going that way whether i like it or not so i uh i had went for a walk with my daughter and we were looking for some seashells and i shared this with some of the youth and i apologize but there is a little bit bonus here than what i had shared at the youth i had uh went with a walk with my eliana she liked to go looking for seashells on the seashore obviously say that 10 times and while we were walking through there i uh it was a sanibel island they're kind of known for seashells and i we were walking through there and i i picked up a seashell and i found a good one i was in the water and you know there's most of all of them are smashed to pieces but i had saw one kind of caught my eye in the water there and i kind of went out in the water and i grabbed that seashell still perfectly intact beautiful colorful thing and i picked it up and and just as i picked it up i was holding it in my hand i looked down at all the other smashed seashells beside me and just the thought passed me by if i wouldn't have picked you up you'd be like the rest of them and just as soon as i thought that thought and i and the secondary thought came and so would you and it yeah you know and so when those things happen and it's that quick and i'm not thinking about it it does something to you and the reality of it is that we that seashell would have been exactly like these other seashells smashed to pieces if it had not been for my hand to come and pick it up and redeem it from the destruction that was impending upon it and the reality of it is there's not a one of us that can glory in and of ourselves if any anything good in our sides it was the mighty hand of god that redeemed you in the hour of destruction and pulled you at just the right time and that is one thing i don't ever want to forget no matter how i go throughout this life it was still the redeeming grace of god that came down and picked me up and rescued me in my time of destruction and there's not a one of us especially the older that would be amongst us that have walked with the lord and had seen the hand of god redeem you so many times before what would you have done if that hand would not have picked you up you would be like every other seashell upon that seashore smashed to pieces left to your own devices in your own lust totally and utterly destroyed completely destroyed but i'm so glad he intervened on my behalf i was so glad that he purposed within himself i'm redeeming you for a purpose i have a purpose in what i'm doing and i've got you right in the palm of my hand to fulfill a purpose i had for your life and i pondered on that for a few days i didn't say anything i just those thoughts come and you just you just think about it and i was sitting there thinking i looked up out after that and i began to realize you know the the difference here is every one of these seashells they have been caught by a storm a wave you know and they weren't anchored to anything there was nothing in them that could withstand um not it wasn't like they were the boats of the sea that had a power within them that could overcome there was nothing there there was just the they were open to the elements of the sea and so they were headed for doom and each and every one of us were and so many times i stop and i think about you know we're not here to gather around a message just to say hey we're a bride wonderful no we're a bride that's that means we have a purpose the brightest has a purpose she's not to just be able to say everybody hey sorry about your luck you're not the bride i am that's not the purpose of the bride that's not the attitude of the bride that's not the nature of the bride the bride is the bride because he she was called to reproduce the life of christ upon this earth he was looking for a certain kind of woman and i'm just so happy to be in that position because i recognize the great purpose that he had for my life now i can purposely live my life according to that purpose and i have that title for tonight you write it down if you want to his purpose now defines mine and so many times we forget the divine purpose by which we're on this life and all you have to do is remember what divine purpose he redeemed you for and then you can refocus your life back in order to that you can be the great purpose of which he redeemed you for and i had asked my daughter the other night i said uh honey what is your purpose i like to challenge my daughter you know it's like oh that's a tough one but i said honey what's your purpose in life and she said to be the reflection of christ i said good i said what did you do today to see to it that that that is accomplished so it's so easy for us sometimes to just say hey god has a great purpose he's got an objective for our lives now we can sit back relax and do nothing about it that's not true that's not right god has a great purpose and he just so happened he put something in you to actually reflect that divine purpose in a constant pursuit for him the person of the word to see him reflected in your life i told my other little daughter i said go up to the mirror i said what is that mirror telling you and she says it's it's showing me me i said exactly right amir is there to reflect amir and my life is here to reflect his life and you know what if i see some blemish and some blot that isn't perfectly reflecting the life that is supposed to be there i got a job to do don't i i've got something to clean up i've got something to take before the lord i have something to persevere in prayer about i have something to stay in the word and be washed by so that i can adequately reflect him in the purpose of his desire which was to be reflected upon this earth to bring him back into view again the seventh seal brought him back to earth and the mystery of the bride is the mystery of christ he's being unveiled revealed in her amen don't be quiet on me then i'll get really nervous [Laughter] so so you know in this re in this reality i realize i have a divine purpose and that divine purpose has to drive me to do something you know any man brother balaam said any man that was worth anything in the bible had to persevere with a purpose that he was going to achieve something for god any man through history had to persevere and say purpose within himself and say i'm going to do this thomas edison with the light bulb he said i know electricity is there and i am going to capture it and bring it into a light george washington brother banham says he was going to cross the delaware he was going to fight and he persevered and went through and even went through i think he was shot three times but it didn't stop him in his pursuit but so many times we see that the cares of life and the issues of life and the situations of life and oh this one does this and this one does that and this one you know rejected this truth and this one rejected this truth and they call me a fanatic here and what does it do it begins to hinder you what does hinder you why does it hinder you what is that to thee follow thou me if you have a personal revelation of jesus christ and this word is jesus christ then you are adequately sufficiently um inspired by what you have seen to keep pressing towards that mark right that's what we do there's a perseverance in the bride of jesus christ she doesn't let every wind and wave and everything that comes her way to batter her and bash her and and destroy her no i've already been redeemed i've been picked up he's already got and showed me his purpose for my life and so therefore because i know that purpose i keep walking i'd like to read you some scriptures and i hope this is okay i just want to identify for you the purpose of your life because it's defined in his purpose philippians 3 13 if you would like to turn to it you may or write it down it says brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do for getting those things which are behind i am reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus it looks to me like we never stop in our pursuit it looks to me like there has to be a bit of a ruggedness inside of the believer that he doesn't let anything just push him off to the side and discourage him and make him get down and say well forget about it well you know i'm just going to go and relax and if god wants to do something great through me he'll just do it it just doesn't sound right does it it doesn't sound to me like a perseverant christian it sounds like david you well god yeah i know you anointed me to be king and i guess if you're going to get me there you'll have to do a lot of things through me no david was perseverant in what he did david knew that he had a purpose for his life because god revealed his purpose for him therefore when he came in contact with an obstacle he just cut it down he just took god's word and he cut it down tell me any of the bible characters or any of the great heroes of faith throughout the bible that didn't have to persevere and stand on god's word and just believe god and press towards the mark of the high calling in christ jesus tell me one of them tell me one of them that could sit by and just let life happen they didn't have to do anything they could just float on by and brother branham tells a story of this and i picked it up and he tells about a bum that comes to his house one day you might know the story he says the old bum came to his house asking for a sandwich he made him a dinner sat down for a moment he said i knew he was a traveler i said where'd you come from he said nowhere he said where are you going he said nowhere he said it struck him here's a man with no ambition in his life he doesn't know where he came from and he doesn't know where he's going bride do you know where you came from if you know where you came from you know where you're going so therefore you can live your life with a purpose and not be distracted or dismayed when everything doesn't quite go the way you think it is because let me remind you all things work together for the good to them that love god who are the called according to your purpose no i'm so glad it was his purpose i had nothing in me that i could redeem myself to put myself in a position that i could reflect the life of jesus christ he had to purpose within himself to do that i can't do that and brother branham tells about this man he says now that is the attitude of people this bum he said that's the attitude of this of people just what i call i would call them drifters i'd call them floaters people that want to join a church that's just about the same i've often thought about floating a driftwood a driftwood it just hangs around in any kind of trash that's just the way a lot of floaters are in the church and everywhere now you take the stream like a stream of life and plenty of driftwood hanging up in every trash pile and yet the boat comes along made out of the exact same wood but if you notice the wood is made and it's shaped by the master who has built the boat not only it is shaped out of but it is guided by the master and it is pushed by a power and we're all made out of the same stuff but it depends on what your ambitions are the exact same piece of wood but submitted into the hands of the master can cut through every wave every circumstance every difficulty every doubt every skepticism it does not matter because it's been submitted in the hands of the master and crafted to crest every wave such the same thing but you see there was a purpose in it he said you have to have some purpose you have to have the ambition to be taken by god and cut to pieces in shape to be used of him to fulfill his will you've got to have it in you there's just got to be something there that's what because i i've had i've hired people and times gone past they come to work for me and they don't last very long if they don't have ambition i don't care how smart they are i've had some very smart gentlemen that worked for me for for in times gone past that we've let go because they just did not have any drive i said any day give me a man that doesn't know it all but he's got an earnest desire to perform and work hard and please the boss i can work with that man i wonder if god doesn't think the same way sometimes he's not so interested in all you know but he sure knows that man has the desire to serve me he's doing everything he can every day he's pursuing me he's constantly i fail but lord i'm getting back up i want to do it again you see there's something there's an ambition in that man i can work with that as a boss and i think god can work with that as a bride not a man that can sit back and say i've got it all figured out i don't have to prove i don't have to uh pursue him with an earnest desire any longer i don't think that's god's desire i think god has always created you in such a way you will always need him and you always want to need him what kind of husband would want a wife that has no desire to ever hold his hand has no desire to ever ask for help has no desire she's an independent woman she doesn't need him around no husband wants that kind of a wife neither does her heavenly father he just doesn't want that kind of a wife and her bride so we have to have an earnest desire and earnest perseverance in us to see to it that we are molded and shaped into that image that he can use brother branham says in persecution he says now all christians must be perseverant they must be persevered and the only way that they're able to do this is you have to have faith in what you're trying to do and if you have no faith you're just jumping at you can't be persevering and when you really know that this is the truth then there is nothing that is going to stop you you are really perseverant then man of all ages that has ever been able to do anything and had faith in what they're trying to do were perseverant so now i'm going to let the german come out in me a little bit i'll be a little bit militant if you hadn't note i have blonde hair and blue eyes i have a portion of military germanness in me the reality of it is you're supposed to be persevering you're supposed to have an ambition you're supposed to want to see yourself molded and shaped and created into his image you're not supposed to be a passive i would say a passive christian in the sense if god wants to use me for something god wants to bless me with something god wants to heal my body what was in it that woman that said if i touched the hem of his garment what was in the woman who said hey it's not me to give the children spread to dogs what was in that woman brother branham says that was a different kind of a woman see he was trying to throw her off but you could not throw off this elect of god she was perseverant she would take god at his word and believe no matter what the obstacle comes his way do you think god could actually allow some winds and waves and skepticism and falling away to happen all around us just to see i wonder if they'll keep coming i wonder if they'll keep coming i wonder if i can throw them off with this i wonder if i can throw them off with that but nothing seems to throw off this bride she just keeps coming she just keeps believing she just keeps trusting day in and day out that the word that she's feeding on is going to cut her and mold her and shape her to be the vessel by which he can come and express himself through he's going to shape us so that he can live in us he's going to cut me and he's going to cut you with life circumstances and situations and we're not going to say no lord don't do it we're going to say yes lord if that's what you need then all things do work together for the good to them that love the lord that are called by your purpose there's nothing to be worried about there's nothing to be dismayed it's working all for his good and for his glory so brother brown tells another story about a man who wants to be perseverant not once is says and i can't remember the man's um the pastor he said god told him to go to a city and hold a revival remember this and he's going to hold a revival in a certain city and the evil i guess rough man of the city said you're not having a revival in my city and he went down and he went to the man and he says hey if you're going to have a revival you have to get through me and he said the man was just washing windows washing windows and he says now oh i have to get through you he said yeah you'll have to get through me he said no problem let me finish the windows he got down finished the windows and beat the tar out of the man picked him back up shook his hand he said the man got saved that night he said there was not going to be anything that standed in his way because god had revealed to him what his purpose was and his purpose was to fill god fulfill god's purpose and it just so happened that god had allowed for a certain man to be in that city to really test the fortitude of the purpose and the faith that this man had i wonder if sometimes he does that actually i don't want her i know he doesn't i know he does it i know he lets the scounders of life come into our life to really challenge your revelation you really think you're the bride you really think you're the expression of his will you really think you're the mystery of his revelation in this hour sure you do and you know what you just wash the windows get down beat the tar out of that devil and you keep on going you don't stop you cast down every thought and imagination that exalts itself amongst the above the will and word of god right anything that would try to hinder you you just cost it away doesn't matter what it is believers believe guys believers believe we don't just believe we're reading fairy tales and fables of the bible we believe that this gods this is god's revealed word to us to quicken us to make us alive to raise us up what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection that this is i'm being quickened and made alive by the power of almighty god who came down reached me out of the the soon-to-be destruction revealed the arm of the lord to me revealed his will and his purpose for my life and so now i know how to live and i know that anything that gets in the way of that divine purpose i got to deal with it i have to deal with it we as individuals have to deal with things because you have to constantly look is what i'm doing today this week this month furthering the purpose of god's will for my life maybe we shouldn't take it that far am i doing this hour what i am doing this hour is it for furthering the purpose of god for my life so see german military come on now guys sometimes it's good to uh encourage and sometimes it's it's a buckle up soldier it's time to get going got a purpose to do we got a job to do let's go right that's okay i told you a little different tonight i can't do anything that i i can't be nothing that i hate congressman i shall and the absolute he says listen i want to tell you something he had a purpose in saving me and he had a purpose in saving you and i am determined that by his will i will do it i will not add anything nor take anything away from it this revelation 22 19. if you want to put that down whosoever take away i am determined i am fixing to leave the church and you know that i am determined just to remain with this gospel as long as i live by the help of god remember here is grace there were millions dying in sin when he saved me who was i that he should save me he had a purpose in saving me and i am determined to carry out that purpose i don't care what my end may be maybe pretty soon but whatever i'm still anchored and it's never changed amen so just as brother branham had to come to the realization that there was many many many there that were maybe better and more qualified to be saved so were there many many many better than you but god pre-predetermined and chose you from before the foundation of the world what an honor everybody what a privilege i don't think we should take so lightly i know i have too many times i've taken it lightly the cares of this life and the the busyness of this life and the situations of this life can sometimes cloud your vision make you forget the great honor that you have in his choosing i mean how honored was esther to be the one to be chosen to sit by his side how honored she must have felt how honored you must feel you're not just i hope you're just not here to just hey i got to do my religious duty and i got to keep church and i don't want anybody to think odd about me if i don't show up at church my goodness friend that's that's not why we live we come to church to feed on his word we come to church to be judged we come to church to be quickened by the same quickening power that rose up christ from the dead we came to have that same anointing to anoint us to empower us to lead us to guide us i still believe in the holy ghost leadership in the body i still believe that a man moves speaks acts as he's led of the spirit of god any i don't believe that we are to become an intellectual group of individuals that could understand the bible and all of its intricacies i believe we are anointed of the holy spirit of god and by that word we don't deviate from that word because he leads us and guides us by that truth i believe it's the same holy ghost and he gave us the word to anchor us to guide us and steer the ship accordingly but i still believe in holy ghost leadership i don't believe we ever get away from holy ghost leadership in our lives and i'm determined more than ever before to see to it that that dove has the preeminence that he desires do you brother branham says in the per pergameon now the purpose of the bride you all know the purpose of the bride but i just want to bring it back before you in case you forgot the first son adam was the spoken word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god but she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to die the second son jesus also a spoken word of god was given a bride like as was adam but before he could marry her she had fallen she like adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of god and live or doubt the word of god and die she doubted she left the word she died but from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man made creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifested in the virgin the members of the bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him and they are subject to him as members of our bodies are subject to our own heads does that do to you when you say when i say to you the very potentials of god is within you every potential everything that you saw in him he's poured in you in that day you shall know that i am in the father the father is in me i am in you and you are in me if ye shall say unto this mountain so many times we hear those things and we forget you know when when jesus came out onto the water he had the twofold purpose when he came one was to ex display and express to himself or to them his disciples that here is the son of god who overcame the waves of the sea but it wasn't just to express that he was god what he was hoping for them to see was what was in them it wasn't just so that they could see the god that was before them but they were he was wanting them to awaken to the god that was within them he said oh you have little faith why why did you doubt why did you disbelieve why did you let the winds and the waves and the cares of life overcome you did you not know that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world did you not know this did you not know that my purpose in coming was not to just display my great strength but to show you that what is in me i have now put in you this is the purpose and will of god this was the becoming god this was god becoming man becoming flesh coming down from a thought to a word to a life and he just so happens to have a bride that believes that it just has a bride that believes that she doesn't have to do anything more than just believe that she stands on that she doesn't know doesn't matter what anything would come against her in doubting it she believes it she just believes it it's interesting no it's not interesting it's wonderful it's wonderful i'm so glad he purposed in himself to bring me to that point now i want to show you a purposeful wash woman now sometimes and i have as well all of us we look at our life we look at the situations of our life we may have regrets we may have difficulties in understanding why did god bring me to this position why did god let me experience this situation why am i in this state why why isn't it a different situation why couldn't you put me here why couldn't you put me there what if i told you god has a divine purpose in making you and and molding you and placing you just where he has you would you say amen to it okay i want to show you of a purposeful wash woman look at the white moody's conversion many of those you see just one little old one old woman a little old wash woman with a message in her heart that she wanted to do something for god she rented an old liver stable a livery stable and got a minister to come down there and preach and nobody but a little boy with hair hanging down his neck and his daddy's suspenders on went down there knelt down at the otter it was dwight moody sent a half a million souls to jesus christ that woman had something to do she was there for a purpose and she had she was made a wash woman for that purpose you know what if she wasn't a wash woman what if she was a mother and she had 15 children i wonder if she would have had the time and the burden to do something for god and to get a little stable or something follow the leadership of the lord to do something for god see god had to make her a wash woman brother bam says don't despise where god has you but serve your purpose there's coming a great victory one of these days where the battle is over i think sometimes we spend too much time complaining about the place that god has us we should just thank god for where he has us and actually look for him to use us in the place that he's placed us to fulfill his purpose too much time complaining too many times being frustrated with why things are the way they are rather than a thankfulness and a gratefulness that god has placed you in a position with the revelation that you have that you can glorify him in whatever state you find yourself in that's a real honor that's a real blessed person that can glorify god in whatever state they find themselves their content in the easter seal jesus was so full of the quickening power he said if you destroy this temple that took you 40 years to build i'll raise it up in three days well why could jesus say that i want to ask you why could jesus say a thing like that he knew that he he knew what he was amen i wish i could make that stick he knew who he was he knew it every word that god had written in there of him he was here to fulfill it he knew he was the one that david spoke of do you know you're the ones the bible speaks of do you know you're in the position do you know your position is in christ if you're in christ you're a new creature do you know this word is just like everyday living for you why sure it's yours you're the eagle it's your food wow the promises of god they're just our food it's just everyday living oh so god works a miracle in your life and heals you that's just everyday living for the believer oh god heals your sick child that's just everyday living for the believer there's benefits to being in christ don't ever deny your benefits when i get a job or somebody gets a job first thing you do you check the benefit plan what all's in here health care dental great when you became a christian you know what all heaven is backing up the promises of god for you all heaven is there every bit of heaven is there to back up every promise but you've got to believe it you've got to take him at his word you can't be a drifting just say well god wants to give me healing i don't sound like the woman who touched the hem of his garment that don't sound like the woman that sat there at the table and said i'll even eat the crumbs that fall off the table that don't sound like the same that don't ring the same to me there's a perseverance there's a boldness in the bride of jesus christ to see to it that every promise in the book it's mine you don't want it that's fine let your unbelief keep it from you but by god's grace may he raise the faith that's in my heart to take every promise that he promised peace healing joy satisfaction i don't care what it is whatever promise that that bible has declared is for the believer it's mine problems in the home problems in the marriage it doesn't matter he's more than able to solve that problem too but i have to believe him i have to call jesus on the scene i have to awaken him and not sit there and complain about it can you imagine do you see why god had to rebuke moses and say why are you crying unto me speak the word and move forward everything you had needed for this earth journey i gave it to you stop crying all the time realize what's in your hand and walk but you have to speak it you have to take the word put it on your lips speak the word and move forward sorry too much german uh where am i at you okay everybody's okay okay sorry now i got figure out where i'm at again psalms blessed is the man that walketh not in the counts of the ungodly okay and standeth in the way of the sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper i want to draw your attention to the first verse that stopped me yesterday when i was looking at it says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counts of the ungodly next step he goes from walking to now he's standing with sinners next step he is now sitting in the seat of the scornful you stand you you you walk with ungodly things you walk with things that aren't pleasing to god you walk with things that aren't um acceptable in his sight before long you'll be standing in the presence of sinners and before long after that you'll be sitting in the skeet of the scornful you know what scornful is arrogant and pridefulness you go look it up you begin to become so arrogant and prideful that nobody is right nobody is good nobody's as good as you you become an arrogant scornful individual and it all started because you began to walk with doubt you began to walk with that doubt and then you began to entertain that doubt and then you begin to settle in your scornfulness and your bad attitude and your arrogant nature but blessed is he now you won't do this if you do this but blessed is he whose delight is in the law of the lord where he doth meditate day and night he shall be like that tree that's planted by rivers of water and he shall bring forth his fruit and season and his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he do shall prosper let's contrast this with jude jude 1. if you want to turn to it jude 1 verse 11. jude 1 verse 11. now i showed you the one side those that meditate upon the law of god day and night they're like that tree planted by rivers of water they bring forth the fruit in his season they're able to reproduce the life of christ jude 1 11 says woe unto them for they have gone the way of cain and they have ran greedily after the way of balaam for reward and they have perished in the gang saints of korah these are spots in your feast of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water carried a bout of winds trees whose fruit is withered without fruit twice dead and plucked up from the roots waging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness and darkness forever brother branham said about these wandering stars he says oh there are those people that say oh i wonder if god will keep his word here i wonder if god can keep his word here you know they came out a mixed multitude they came out of mixed multitude that believed the prophet of god but in the wilderness journey their real attribute of their unbelief began to manifest i wonder if god can deliver us here i wonder if god can bring me through this i wonder about that brother braham said don't wonder believe god's word just be fixed we're not wandering stars we're fixed we're fixed in his hand we believe what he says you'll keep it you'll not doubt it we be not like ephesians says 4 says till we all come to the unity of faith and the knowledge of his son and to the knowledge of the son of god unto the perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind oh just lost it every wind of doctrine by the slight of men in the cunning craftiness by whereby they lay and wait to deceive us or to deceive sorry so as we grow up and we mature we don't let every little situation little every problem every difficulty and everything we see over here and everything that see over there to persua to uh to to knock us off course we have a purpose i'm to be conformed into the image of his dear son at the end of the day what does it matter if this one's doing this and this one's doing this and that one's doing that and this one's saying it this way what does it matter everybody what is that to thee follow thou me what does it mean what does it matter why do you let that hinder you why do you let that discourage you what does it matter do you not have a revelation that god has chosen you to perfect you and to express himself in you if he does you just keep headed towards that vision you just keep walking it day in and day out every day exam in your life seeing is what i'm doing today helping him to fulfill his great desire that's why i said his def his desire his purpose defines mine you got to remember what was his divine purpose for your life your divine purpose was so you would be a vessel that he could reflect himself back to this earth with no smudges no blemishes no your little personality thing here your little pet thing here in the way to mess up the image nope everything go on every year i desires gone your will gone your uh your once gone just what he wanted okay you wanted to make me a wash woman okay wanted to make me and place me in this situation okay no problem that's just where i'll be and that's where i hope i'll express christ in his fullness and in his word right replanted me amen amen so where am i now brother braham says in the power of decision if a man ever once anchors his heart against the heart of calvary every devil and hell will never shake him from it notice for he cannot stand for he that cannot stand chastisement is an illegitimate child he claims god to be his father when he's not he's just always tossed about by every wind of doctrine and he's not stable and don't know where you're going you're double minded lots of times you're double tongued and don't know where you're standing and what you're talking about then a man that's been born of the spirit of god knows exactly where he's at that's right nothing phases him because something inside of him has already witnessed that somebody is on the is somebody outside irknow it witnessed somebody outside the cloud yonder his faith sees it so obviously a man that has got a revelation of god has a firm foundation and a good grip on him remember brother chad talked about the eagle had an eagle grip that could lock down on something it's just something about eagles when they come in contact with the word they lock a hold and they don't let go nothing can shake them off of it when you came to christ nothing can let go there's something on the inside of you a perseverance and a strength to take a hold of god's word and it just keeps going through it doesn't stop and so i was thinking about this and can you imagine if i had if let's say like brother shay's not here so i pick on brother shea but the shay's not here but if he would him if i if i was his boss in superior and i hired him to obviously be a highway patrolman and navigate the streets and he was his duty was to see to it that everybody abided by the law on the roads and every day i drove by and i saw him at dunkin donuts in the morning that'd be all right but if i saw him there every day of every hour i would say he is not serving the purpose by which i hired him for i would say this man has got his own desire and it is certainly not to fulfill the desire of the highway patrol it is to fulfill his own desire and eat donuts once a day is okay 12 times a day not so much but you see now that's just in the natural realm but then if i asked you what did you what were you doing today bride of jesus christ what were you pursuing this week bride what was your will this month bride what did you do were you about the father's business were you just letting god try to were you not making any effort to be molded and shaped into his image do you not persevere do you not make an effort it's a simple question i know it's a simple answer oh bye it's a simple answer but i wonder how diligent we are to keep the simple answer are we staying washed by the washing of the word do we come to church faithfully do we participate in all that we can do we pray without ceasing do we seek god's will for the decisions that we make in our life or do we just go fast quick it's way too quiet way way too quiet i'm asking the question because i don't ask it if you ask it of me as well something i have to look in the mirror i have to look at my decisions and the day the day every day that i'm living and saying is what i am doing living with a purpose that he intended for me to live by that's a question so many times i think we want to hear something new we want a new mystery we want to to have a new revelation you know peter said i come sometimes and i stir you up into remembrance though you already be established in present truth i'm still going to stir you up in remembrance to remember and remind you of the purpose by which god called you elected you molded you sometimes it's not a question of present tense truth we believe the prophet of god we believe this message of the hours calling out a bride we believe in the coming of the lord we know he was here at the he was uh when the seventh angel was on earth he came at that time we know that these aren't questions but sometimes the rubber meets the road and i have to ask a question i have to ask the question of myself and then i ask the question of myself then i post it to you because i preach what i live the purpose of god's will for your life was that you could be in the image of his very own son now that wasn't just a fictitious idea or just some you know just some fairy tale no that's actually the purpose of god to bring into view again almighty god in earthen vessels a little mystery that he had hid but then now he has to look at the situation and say now the people that i have chosen i wonder how bad they want to see that come into pass i wonder what they're willing to give up i wonder if they're willing to give up an idea a desire a job a friendship something but you find out whatever it's worth you is the price you're willing to pay for it i went through that once before if it's worth of something great to you you'll pay a great price for it if it's not you won't if christ's purpose for your life is of a great value to you you will go to great lengths to see it come to pass if it is not you won't it's not a question of i'm not trying to question your your spirituality i'm not trying to take away from you anything that god's done for you i'm not doing that i'm trying to stir you up i'm trying to stir you up in remembrance i'm trying to say hey don't forget almighty god did went to great lengths to redeem you he didn't have to he didn't have to do a thing for you and believe me there was probably 10 million other people way better than you i know there was for me but i remember thinking wow you actually did this for me you actually called me redeem me for this purpose this great purpose that you've had hidden in the back part of your mind you did that for me why i don't know but do i believe it i do i do and because i know and i believe that that great purpose that god purposed and saved me for is is something that was for me then it it it demands a level of respect and time and energy on my behalf to see to it that it comes to pass that i i cast down every thought and imagination i don't let anything take me or draw me away every sin that easily besets me i deal with it if i see something in the mirror that is smudging the image i take it to god and say lord help me i gotta get that off my home isn't reflecting you right my attitude doesn't reflect you right my speech my desires it doesn't look like christ again it looks like a man just a normal man trying to live his life do his own will it's a question just a question maybe it's only for one person and everybody else is a-okay i'm trusting that that is the case brother branham said in the easter seal oh no i'm sorry my computer went the wrong way let's see here the bible says in james 1 3 knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and abradeth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like the wave of a seed driven with the wind and tossed let not that man think that he will receive anything of the lord for a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways so i cannot pursue my will and his will at the same time i'll be unstable in all my ways i have to put one purpose before me and i have to make sure that i block everything else that tries to stop that to see that come to pass i have something i've got to do every father in a home knows this situation you don't just sit back and and trust that everything in your home goes all right every father has to stand up and be a man take control of his home and say this isn't according to god's will this this situation how we handled this with the children that wasn't according to god's will i have to take control of my own home with my own children and if anything goes wrong in my own home guess whose fault it was mine so a father has a responsibility to his wife and to his children to see to it that his home is reflecting christ the way christ would want it to be reflected right a young man would have to live his life he knows how to has to be able to control his life and control his desires in such a way that if god looked into the secrets of his life he could say this is a young man that's reflecting me the way i want to be reflected you can look to a wife and say hey here's an unbelieving husband but this wife is so purposed in her heart to see christ reflected in her that now she handles her husband in the right way though he may not be serving god it doesn't matter you're serving god the wife serves god the wife reflects christ the way god christ wants to reflect regardless of the husband's situation you know she has to purpose in herself to do that you see what i'm saying nobody's off the hook everybody has a place to play everybody has uh everybody's a wash woman somewhere with a purposeful wash woman somewhere god has a custom-made circumstance and situation that he just so placed you in to see the glory of god manifested in you maybe you're the only one that can do it maybe you're the only one that could really reflect christ in the situation you find yourself in to the the way he would want it to be reflected it could be a great blessing for you and not a cursing um amen i have to start saying things to get responses at this point you love the lord and i've seen some ministers do so it's funny uh i loved it brother nestor used to amen himself you know amen i think it encouraged him hear somebody um brother braham says again here in perseverance he says men of all ages that have faith in what they're trying to achieve has has been men of perseverance no man can be perseverant unless first he knows what he's trying to achieve and you must first know what you're trying to achieve and then have faith in what you're going and have faith in what you're going to get what that you're going to get what you're trying for and that makes you perseverant something that you know is real faith is based that way faith is not based upon a myth or upon something like that will that just say well we'll go do this or do that on the words of some man no faith takes its eternal resting place upon the word of god upon god's word that is the bible i so love it brother branham had made the comment you know when he talks about the old violin he said it was mocked out ridiculed scoffed he said but it was like a violin he said but in the hands of the master he could play a tune like nobody else could play he said now and you have to be honest now in this final day god had so sent a man ordained of himself ordained of god that could pick up the old dusty bible and make it come to life again for each and every one of us and i so love that about it because now when i go to the word i can see it in its full richness of of what he meant when he said it it's no longer pushed aside by man's ideas and creeds it's now brought to life it can live it can express itself in you and in me now where it couldn't do that it was too bound up but now it's been made free and set free and the beauty of that music can play and now the beauty of that music can be echoed in me i just love that about it i really do love that so sometimes these obstacles we look at they're not as difficult as we think if we look at the right things you know joshua and caleb when they came out of the wilderness it looked to like everybody else that that was a pretty big situation there were some pretty big obstacles in the way it looked like the majority of these uh giants that were in the land were just too much for israel but that wasn't what joshua and caleb said the bible bible says that there was a different spirit in them and we know that it was the spirit of christ here was the elect so much so that here you have joshua type of the holy ghost and you have caleb echoing the word of god you have caleb saying the exact same thing joshua's saying i believe the bride says the exact same thing that the word is saying i believe she just keeps echoing what he said we're more than able we're more than able greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world i don't care what the obstacle is i don't care what the situation and look at caleb 40 years later i'm i'm stronger now than i was 40 years ago i don't believe for one second he was looking at his flabby arms i think with everything in me he was more confident that the one who made the promise was going to keep the promise i believe with the bride as time goes on she doesn't get weaker she says it's going to be even more sweeter when we fully take that land the one who brought me out is the one who takes me in he had purposed in himself to do it and he will do it he will bring me into that great image that he had for ordained me to come into he took a snapshot of you and he's taken me to that image brother ma'am says in the token and now watch as we see the great end time signs on this earth that he has promised how much more it's warning us that the time is at hand quit your unbelieving and come together we should love each other and believe and separate ourselves from the world it looks like he gave us a lot of things we have to do love each other believe and separate yourself from the world notice they were not to just come together and talk about the message they were to get into it get under the blood not come and say you know moses told us the messenger he said he told us that we should we should have blood but what do you think about it boys that wasn't it get a lamb and kill it and get the blood up there see that had something to do with it we can come and sit and agree with the word and everything else but don't have to then don't have that token what good will it do you no good you've got to get beneath it he was not responsible for anyone out from under that blood he is not responsible for anybody today who's out from under that token you got something to do it got something to do faith is the victory brother branham says daniel when he was taken down into babylon though he was going away from his home he was going to have to be a slave in another nation amongst another people but daniel had purposed within his heart that no matter what they ever did to him he wasn't going to defile himself with the babylonian sin i wonder have bride have you purposed within yourself that no matter what condition laodicea finds yourself to bring you into you're not going to defile yourself with the sins of laodicea i wonder if there is such a determination like there wasn't daniel that no matter what comes my way i have purpose within myself i will not defy the tabernacle of the living god with the cares and the loves and the pleasures of this life oh if we had more gallant men like that what would that would purpose that in their heart that if i am a christian i'm going to go find out every divine promise that belongs to me and claim it amen everything that's there it's mine i told you it was just a short simple thought but i want to also tell you this brother branham says in beyond the curtain of time i want to close with this thought musicians you can come he said i heard a voice that was saying you're just now starting you've got to keep pressing press the battle keep pressing as i lay there and was pondering on these words i thought i just imagined that voice again the voice said press the battle keep going keep going i thought that i had possibly spoken those words out of myself i placed my hands or my i placed my lips between my teeth and i held my hand up over my mouth and i listened and the voice said again just keep pressing if you only knew what what it is at the end of the road sometimes you just have to hear a voice that says keep going don't stop don't be dismayed don't be discouraged keep pressing keep going if you only knew what will awaited you just ahead it's going to be so wonderful i have not seen an ear hath not heard neither has it entered into the heart what god has in stores for them that love him you may stand i hope that's okay i tonight i again i told you i cannot do anything more than what i feel inspired to do and i don't know who it's for and maybe it was just for me and so uh but maybe not me and brother bob me and brother bob so many times we let too many things distract us and get us dismayed i think we have to go back sometimes and remember i'll be like peter i want to stir you up go back and remember the purpose that he went to to save you go back and remember what great purpose he had saved you for he wanted to see you he knew that you had within you the potentials to submit your will to his that's a pretty phenomenal potential a submission you could submit your will to his will not so much i think he was looking for great abilities i don't think so i think he was looking for a humble group of people that would submit their will to his that would say they're incapable unable not educated enough not smart enough can't figure it out but i'm willing father god for you to display your attributes in me however you see fit wow now i feel qualified we all may feel qualified when we can look at it from that perspective he was never looking for human ability he was looking for submission he was looking for that kind of a wife if you'll just bow your heads heavenly father lord we sure appreciate you we appreciate your word i appreciate it so very much father i just pray that you would take the things that i said i pray lord i said it the right way i pray i said it just in the way that would be a help to your people that was my only desire and purpose tonight lord to just get out of the way say something here this wednesday night to encourage your most precious people that you love and went to such great lengths to redeem father i'm so thankful that i was one that you picked up i think we all are you didn't have to but you did and so father god we just ask that you would help us each and every day may we examine our lives may we look at the things that we're doing the things we're pursuing may we see if it if it's matching your purpose and what you wanted for us the father sometimes we we get too busy we don't stop long enough to consider it and father that was my desire tonight was just slow us down for a moment cause us to reflect and look back cause us to examine our lives real quietly closely and see lord what are we doing why are we doing what we're doing so father i i pray that you would just work on every heart mind included lord you know every situation and you know us better than we know ourselves father so father may you be glorified i know your word will always never return into your void it always accomplishes it so father may we just be a humble people to believe it to trust it to take it by faith and lord i commit our assembly to you i commit every mommy and every daddy every husband every wife every family in our assembly and those that would maybe be watching lord i just pray you'd help them help us all as a people we just want to be found as a qualified bride of jesus christ reflecting your desire in this earth we love you we commit ourselves to you ask that you would forgive us for our many sins our many mistakes our many times that we we pursue two ways our way and your way which makes us unstable in always i pray lord that you would help us fix our minds and our hearts upon thee and we ask blessings upon our pastor and the family lord we're looking forward to them coming back for your blessings upon the service lord if you should tarry bring us back together and speak to us once more we pray we love you and thank you in jesus name amen amen

week maybe we could just play a couple songs brother john you can sing but you could maybe sit in your seats and just pray i know that's a little bit different but god sometimes works in unusual ways sometimes a little different i think we have a great opportunity we're in the atmosphere of believers we can sit down quietly reflect on our lives and see if maybe we haven't kind of clouded the vision of god for our lives in our lives maybe you just sit for a moment you can pray sit in your chair you can leave if you have to but maybe take some time and just re-examine for a moment and see do i have the right picture out before me am i pressing toward the right thing am i pressing at all am i pressing toward the mark of the high calling in christ jesus so i'm gonna sit you guys can sit
