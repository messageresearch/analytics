TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and there shall be signs in the heavens and the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity are we living in a perplexed time has anybody looked at the situation said ah you know you can't you can't go to the store right now and be sure you're going to get what you're looking for this has never happened to americans it's sad but come on i mean it is a sad problem that we have but reality has stead into us you don't know if you travel you're going to come home i mean this is a perplexing time this was this this is a time like we've never seen you you i don't look at the news hardly anymore it's too discouraging but you look at the news there isn't a day goes by where it just makes you want to vomit to see men killing their families kids killing their parents there's a school shooting in america almost every week i mean it's hell on earth this is hell on earth hell is spilling over brother branham said you have people driving people over this has become a common everyday thing for us in america it is sad but it is the reality hell is present but if hell's present heaven's present that means that the rock of my salvation is here that means that he promised he'll be walking with me through the valley of the shadow of death i'll be with you so i'm going to take you right on through i'm going to let the winds i'm going to let the waves i'm going to let the storm i'm going to let the winds turn contrary against you but don't you worry i've been training you for a long time and this time you're not only going to walk on water you're going to walk from one dimension to another dimension this was a promise that he gave and i'm still standing on that promise i don't know i don't know how he's going to do it i'm not trying to figure out the mechanics i believe the dynamics brother last night we're talking about brother enoch and trying to figure and i says i look at enoch all the time there's things i don't understand but i know this i may not know the mechanics of how enoch took that body change but with all that's in me i believe the same dynamics that was there present with enoch to walk out of this world is the same dynamics that's here in the presence of his people because he promised i'll be there with you and if that condition was a hell on earth in enoch's day which it was satan's eden in full effect and he was able to leave one dimension to another i believe with all my heart the same dynamics is present with us not to just heal our bodies but to change the molecules from which we are in to take that other dimension very very soon
