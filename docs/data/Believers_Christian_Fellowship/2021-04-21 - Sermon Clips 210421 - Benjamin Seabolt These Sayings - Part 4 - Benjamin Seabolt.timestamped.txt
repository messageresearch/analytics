[0:00] when that politically backed religious
[0:02] persecution comes
[0:05] i am not going to be the one when they
[0:08] close the church doors
[0:10] to say well i can take i can take that i
[0:14] can handle that
[0:15] what else you got i'll stick around for
[0:17] more no saints
[0:19] when i see a politically backed
[0:21] persecution
[0:22] in the smallest form i'm looking for my
[0:25] atoms to change
[0:27] i'm not here to be a tough guy i'm not
[0:30] here
[0:31] to get stuck in the combine and get
[0:34] ground away to dust
[0:35] i'm not here to bounce around in a
[0:37] combine have you ever seen a corn of
[0:38] wheat
[0:39] go or a air corn go through a combine
[0:42] it is not a fun process it's bouncing
[0:44] around it's going up and down and
[0:46] sideways in every other way
[0:48] it's getting belts run all over top of
[0:50] it they're probably the most amazing
[0:52] machine ever invented just by the way
[0:55] but i'm not here to say
[0:58] that feels good or i can take some more
[1:01] or what else you got
[1:03] when i see a politically backed
[1:05] religious persecution against the true
[1:07] bride of christ i don't even say it this
[1:10] much
[1:11] i don't even have to have it come my way
[1:12] if i see it come your way that's good
[1:14] enough for me
[1:16] that's a that fulfills the scripture i'm
[1:18] good to go
[1:20] i'm good to go take me out of here so
[1:22] it's not about you know
[1:24] preaching this way so we get tough and
[1:25] we resist it and no saints i'm looking
[1:28] for the garner
[1:30] but i'm not going to defy prophecy and
[1:32] scripture
[1:33] to get there i want to have a proper
[1:36] understanding
[1:38] and i want to die daily and get my shock
[1:41] away from me
[1:43] i want to have a proper revelation and
[1:45] say these other things now
[1:48] to get my shock away from me not worried
[1:51] about the other shock
[1:52] i want to get my shock away from me
[1:55] by saying these things and repeating
[1:58] these things
[1:59] so that i can say my doctrine is not my
[2:02] own it is he that sent me
[2:04] i am who i am by the grace of god
[2:07] and i'm willing to do what the
[2:09] scriptures say i must do
[2:11] for my hybridization to pass off the
[2:14] scene
