========================================

The way we view the commandments of God, the way we view the message, the way we view the word is actually the benefit we get out of it. Because I've seen individuals who without question just believe that God sent us a prophet and that God taught us what he wants us to know. And they just in a simple way just believe it. And you see them prosper and you see their families prosper and you see the protection that the word's promised. You see individuals who are always questioning everything. Did he really mean this? And why did he say this? And why did he teach that? And that's no way to live. It's no way to live. I say, let's go back to see what God has given us as a provision from God. Not the workings of man, the provision of God. It's the restoration of the word. Amen. It's the Bible brought back into our view with the scales taken off and all man's teaching stripped away so that we can come back and know what God wants. And we know where the wall is and we know where to stand. Amen. I think that's God has been so good to us to give us a wall. He's been so loving to us to restore the word. The greatest thing that has ever happened to me outside of being born again is hearing the voice of a prophet of God. That'll bring the truth of God's word back front and center. Where would we be without a prophet? Where would you be if there was an authority on the earth that could say God meant this when he said that he meant this and this is what God wants? If we didn't have an authority of a prophet, where would we be? Amen. We would be we would be tangled up in all kinds of stuff. But listen friends, listen. This world is in a disaster. This world is burning down. Amen. Brother Van Priest, this world is falling apart again. And I say and again. Amen. And again, this world is falling apart. But look at your lives. Amen. God has given you families and homes and peace in your heart. And God, yeah, we have trials like everybody else, but we don't have them like everybody else. Amen. We have sicknesses come. We have troubles that strike. We have difficulties that come. But there's something inside of us. Amen. There's some peace inside of us, some connection with God because he's brought us back behind this word. And the devil can't get in and torment our mind and corrupt our soul and twist us up in knots and have us all tied up in bondage. We got to the place where we can be in the midst of a difficult circumstance and sing and dance because God is going to get me out of this because God has told me who I am and what he wants and I've stayed behind his wall. I would rather be free in my heart than in my body. Amen. Paul and Silas were not free when they were beaten when they went on trial and they laid upon them many stripes and they put them into the inner jail cell and they fastened them in stalks. They were not free, but they were free. But you have people that you work with and people you walk past and people you associate with. They're as free as free can be. They can get in their car and drive anywhere they want to drive. They got enough extra money to buy some more gas and go to another state. They can buy what they want in Walmart. They can do whatever they want. And they are absolutely in bondage and in misery. I want to be free like Paul and Silas was free. I want to free because the freedom that Christ gives the liberty that Jesus Christ has given us and restoring the
