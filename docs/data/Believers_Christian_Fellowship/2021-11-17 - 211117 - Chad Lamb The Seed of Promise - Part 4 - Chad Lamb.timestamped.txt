[4:33] right before we go to prayer i want to
[4:34] share a prayer request with you
[4:36] i spoke last night with brother gene
[4:38] petrie and many of you know that sister
[4:40] maryland had fallen and injured her knee
[4:42] again she had a knee surgery and she had
[4:44] fallen and injured it she went in monday
[4:46] and had a knee surgery and the surgery
[4:48] went well they found where a part of
[4:50] that knee replacement was loose they
[4:52] fixed it and went well she's feeling
[4:54] better she can walk on it but while they
[4:56] were in there they found that there's
[4:58] infection there so they've kept her in
[5:00] the hospital they've got her own strong
[5:01] antibiotics and they want to get rid of
[5:03] that infection so i'd like for us to
[5:05] join together in prayer that god will
[5:07] deliver her from that infection and she
[5:09] can go home and heal up and walk and
[5:12] enjoy her mobility and enjoy her healing

[5:53] infection lord and the enemy is trying

[6:25] feel well lord and be strengthened and
[6:27] have a good mobility and may she enjoy
[6:30] her healing we ask lord
[6:32] now as we turn to your word i pray god
[6:34] that you would just speak through this
[6:36] vessel for your glory let us have that
[6:38] portion of the word you reserved for
[6:40] this hour for this time
[6:41] that we have need of lord and i just
[6:43] pray god that you would break the bread
[6:45] yourself and fetus of your own hand for
[6:48] we're your sheep oh and we've come to
[6:49] you the great shepherd and god i pray
[6:52] that you would just lead us into green
[6:53] pastures where we can grow strong and
[6:56] healthy on the good word we ask that you
[6:58] would take every part of this service
[7:00] under your control and have preeminence
[7:02] in jesus christ's name we pray
[7:05] amen
[7:06] man god bless you all while you're
[7:07] standing let's take our bibles and turn
[7:10] to the book of isaiah
[7:12] we're going to continue on with the same
[7:13] thought we've been dealing with the last
[7:15] three services
[7:17] but i just want to mention to you the
[7:18] weekend meetings coming up i want you to
[7:21] keep that in top of your mind as you're
[7:22] praying pray for the ministers that will
[7:24] be traveling in brother marcus will be
[7:26] arriving lord willing tomorrow brother
[7:29] steven shimba will be coming in on
[7:31] friday brother marcus will have the
[7:33] evening services friday evening saturday
[7:34] evening brother stephen lord willing
[7:36] will have the morning services saturday
[7:38] morning and sunday morning so i just
[7:40] want you to remember that be praying for
[7:42] those be praying for the meetings we
[7:44] know we know how this works come
[7:45] expecting because brother branham said
[7:47] you get what you expect amen so let's
[7:49] come with great expectation also there's
[7:51] going to be a a good number of visitors
[7:53] coming from brother stevens church they
[7:55] wanted to come up and join us in
[7:57] fellowship so i think besides him and
[7:58] his wife they have 11 others that are
[8:00] coming so make sure you greet them in
[8:02] the foyer and say hi to them they're
[8:04] going to be staying
[8:05] through till sunday so
[8:07] if you want to have fellowship with them
[8:09] they're going to be brothers and sisters
[8:10] coming up from south carolina so you
[8:12] might want to remember them on sunday
[8:14] afternoon
[8:15] amen let's look at isaiah 55 verse 11.
[8:18] if you remember this was the
[8:20] verse we ended with
[8:22] on sunday so i'd like to start there
[8:25] and as we've been going through this i i
[8:29] never expected to preach on this uh this
[8:31] long this subject but it seems
[8:33] impossible to find the period at the end
[8:35] of the service so god just keeps opening
[8:37] more and opening more so we're just
[8:39] going to trust him and keep walking the
[8:41] path that he has for us
[8:42] in isaiah 55 11 it says
[8:45] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[8:48] of my mouth it shall not return unto me
[8:50] void but it shall accomplish that which
[8:53] i please and it shall prosper in the
[8:55] thing whereto i sent it
[8:57] amen god bless you can you be seated now
[9:00] we'll ask the lord to bless the reading
[9:02] of his word i want to look at this again
[9:04] it just it just struck me we've known
[9:06] the scripture for many years and looked
[9:08] at it but it says
[9:10] so shall my word that
[9:12] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[9:14] of my mouth it shall not return into me
[9:17] void
[9:18] and that means that the word is going to
[9:20] return unto him
[9:22] but it won't return void amen
[9:24] the word comes out from him but the word
[9:26] will return to him but the word will not
[9:28] return void but along the way in the
[9:31] journey of the word the word will
[9:33] accomplish everything that he's
[9:34] determined for it to accomplish
[9:37] so jesus is the lord's saying here
[9:40] that it shall not return unto me void
[9:43] but it shall accomplish that which i
[9:45] please and it shall prosper in the thing
[9:47] where to i sin it so he sent out his
[9:50] word to accomplish something and that
[9:52] word will not return unto him void
[9:55] brother benham said in christ is the
[9:56] mystery of god revealed we've read this
[9:58] quote each time so it's very familiar
[9:59] now it says now you see the seals when
[10:02] he was in his mediatorial work back
[10:04] there redeeming but someday he comes
[10:06] forth to get this book that he's
[10:08] redeemed and all that's in this book
[10:10] would be him for that's the believer the
[10:13] words in the book and the word is him
[10:16] and all that's in that he come forth for
[10:19] this book of redemption whose names are
[10:21] written on the book before the
[10:22] foundation of the world when he was
[10:24] slain as a lamb and i hope as we're
[10:27] going through the series as for me
[10:29] i realized that so many times i get hung
[10:33] up on the symbols and i start to see
[10:35] pictures in my mind of symbols but i
[10:38] start to miss the deeper meaning of what
[10:40] those symbols represent amen so when we
[10:43] when we think of the book of life and
[10:45] the lamb's book of life amen we realize
[10:48] brother ben is telling us now in christ
[10:49] as the mystery of god revealed that all
[10:52] that's in the book would be him
[10:54] for that's the believer the words in the
[10:57] book and the word is him
[10:59] so we know that this this book is him
[11:02] and all the words in the book are the
[11:04] believers and the word is him
[11:07] so we're not we're not talking about
[11:10] paper we're not talking about
[11:12] uh uh pieces of paper
[11:14] we're talking about we're talking about
[11:17] a thought god had a record in god's
[11:20] thoughts something he was going to
[11:21] achieve some purpose that he had in his
[11:24] mind and and he had a desire before the
[11:27] foundation of the world and that book
[11:29] was going to be the record of god
[11:31] becoming material or god becoming as the
[11:34] word because the word was with god and
[11:36] the word was god amen and we know
[11:38] eventually that word and whole was made
[11:40] flesh and dwelt among us and what was it
[11:42] it was elohim it was god with us amen
[11:45] so as that would god would manifest
[11:47] himself portion by portion by portion
[11:49] there was going to be a record of that
[11:51] manifestation as god was manifesting
[11:54] himself and every time that word came
[11:56] into manifestation the anointed word
[11:58] manifested for that day that was christ
[12:02] so that's what this book is recording
[12:04] amen
[12:05] now when we we look at the smyrna church
[12:08] age here in the church age book this
[12:10] quote says watch carefully now and see
[12:12] this
[12:13] before there was ever a speck of
[12:15] stardust
[12:17] before god was gone
[12:19] so now we're going to go way way way way
[12:21] back amen
[12:22] the prophet of god can take us way back
[12:26] he can take us way far ahead and he can
[12:28] take us way way back amen
[12:31] brother franco if you can bring up the
[12:32] white board for me uh he says before
[12:35] there was ever a speck of stardust
[12:38] before god was god
[12:40] and then he goes on and he adds god is
[12:42] an object of adoration no one was there
[12:44] to worship him so he was at that time
[12:46] only potentially god so he's explaining
[12:48] what he means by before god was gone and
[12:52] it says and he was known only as eternal
[12:55] spirit the bride was already in his mind
[12:59] yes she was she was existing in his
[13:02] thoughts and what about those thoughts
[13:03] of god they are eternal are they not
[13:07] so all the way back
[13:09] before brother bannon said before there
[13:10] was a speck of stardust
[13:15] we had
[13:18] elohim
[13:20] the self-existing one
[13:23] brother ben says at this point he was
[13:25] not even god yet
[13:26] because god is an object of worship but
[13:29] there was nothing yet to worship him and
[13:32] he said in this state before there was
[13:34] anything to worship him that means
[13:36] before the heavens were created and the
[13:39] heavenly host was created amen the bride
[13:41] was already in his mind
[13:44] so you amen as an attribute of god you
[13:47] are eternal as god is eternal and when i
[13:50] say you i'm not talking about you that
[13:52] had natural birth i'm not talking about
[13:54] you and this concept of flesh but i'm
[13:56] talking about that sieging of god that
[13:58] was always meant to be you from the
[14:00] beginning that was in your soul that
[14:02] part of god amen that was already with
[14:05] him so that part existed before there
[14:08] was cherubims before there was a
[14:10] heavenly host of angels and seraphims
[14:12] and all of those things before that with
[14:14] that portion of god that dwells in your
[14:16] soul tonight was there in his thinking
[14:21] so
[14:22] before god was god before there was one
[14:24] speck of stardust amen
[14:27] this this what brother venom is teaching
[14:29] us after the opening of the seals what
[14:31] he is explaining to us when he can go
[14:34] back further back before the heavens
[14:36] were created back before the angelic
[14:39] host was formed back when god was alone
[14:42] with his thoughts he can take us all the
[14:44] way back there so that we can find there
[14:48] our origin amen and if you can find your
[14:50] origin there amen nothing else that
[14:53] comes after that amen can take you out
[14:56] of the thinking of god
[14:58] it brings such a security if you can
[15:01] catch a revelation that i'm one of them
[15:04] amen that by the grace of god i've got a
[15:06] revelation a personal revelation of
[15:09] jesus christ to me that i can say i'm
[15:11] one of them if you say there was
[15:13] attributes the bride was already in his
[15:15] thinking as attributes as thoughts amen
[15:17] i believe by revelation i'm part of the
[15:19] bride placing me back there amen and
[15:22] that part of me existed before angels
[15:24] existed
[15:28] amen so in order for elohim to become
[15:31] god
[15:34] he creates the whole heavenly realm
[15:45] so he creates the whole heavenly realm
[15:47] and when he creates the whole heavenly
[15:49] realm there's all kinds of beings in
[15:51] this heavenly realm there's cherubim
[15:53] seraphim
[15:54] archangels angels there's all kinds of
[15:56] stuff
[15:57] but whenever he created that
[16:00] then elohim became god
[16:08] i hope that doesn't stumble anybody
[16:10] that says brother ben i'm explaining
[16:12] because god is an object of worship
[16:15] so before the heavenly realm was created
[16:19] amen
[16:20] if you're part of the bride
[16:23] you were already there in his thinking
[16:27] if you were already there in his
[16:29] thinking
[16:31] then
[16:32] what
[16:33] is going to defeat you now
[16:36] in a creation
[16:39] that came not even the next thing that
[16:41] was created the heavenly realm but then
[16:43] after that the earthly realm was created
[16:45] and what on this earthly realm is going
[16:48] to defeat you
[16:52] because god cannot be defeated
[16:55] so
[16:56] after he created the heavenly realm
[17:00] he created the earthly realm
[17:06] and
[17:07] brother benham tells us
[17:09] that this earth he said it is the
[17:12] negative
[17:14] that the heavenly is the positive
[17:17] he said if you see here a tree
[17:19] struggling to live there's a tree
[17:20] somewhere else that doesn't struggle to
[17:22] live
[17:23] you see here a man struggling for life
[17:25] it shows that there's a man somewhere
[17:26] else that doesn't struggle to live he
[17:28] said this is that this is the negative
[17:32] that is the positive this now is a as a
[17:35] negative reflection of that realm amen
[17:38] so that when brother benham goes beyond
[17:40] the curtain of time and goes into the
[17:42] sixth dimension when he goes there he
[17:44] sees grass there's air there's there's
[17:47] there's a sky and then there's hills
[17:50] there's things that we see on earth amen
[17:53] we see grass and hills and sky and
[17:55] people but when brother branham went
[17:57] beyond the current of time to the sixth
[17:58] dimension he sees grass and hills amen
[18:02] and he sees people and he sees the sky
[18:04] and the question was where was grass
[18:06] first
[18:10] where was grass first amen it was in the
[18:12] heavenly dimension now when we show
[18:15] these two dimensions this is just a way
[18:16] of
[18:17] of separating the two dimensions they
[18:20] actually go together one's just moving
[18:22] at a faster speed than the other it's
[18:23] not like there's great distances apart
[18:26] it's not like heaven's way up there and
[18:28] earth is down here heaven and earth are
[18:30] together amen amen one's just moving at
[18:33] a faster speed than the other one and
[18:35] that one moving at a faster speed has
[18:37] people and it has trees and it has the
[18:40] streams it has grass it has hills
[18:46] but before any of that you existed
[18:51] in the thoughts of god
[18:53] so that means
[18:54] we know
[18:56] that i'll just draw this here
[19:00] sin originated in heaven
[19:04] is that right
[19:06] and then
[19:07] lucifer and his angels were cast out and
[19:09] come to earth
[19:10] then sin broke out in the earth
[19:13] is that right
[19:15] and now we come in this earthly journey
[19:18] we come in a sin cursed body and a sin
[19:20] cursed earth and when we come born wrong
[19:23] amen with the wrong nature and the wrong
[19:25] spirit and all of that
[19:27] and we have to come through a cycle of
[19:29] redemption but i just want you to know
[19:31] that before
[19:34] lucifer sinned
[19:38] i was here
[19:42] before there was an adversary i was in
[19:44] his thinking
[19:45] before there was a luther lucifer before
[19:48] sin ever broke out i existed somewhere
[19:51] amen in the thought of god because
[19:53] thought god's thoughts are eternal god's
[19:55] thoughts are real brother branham said
[19:57] god's thoughts are not like a blueprint
[19:59] where you write it on paper and then
[20:01] you've got to build amen to match the
[20:03] thought the thought is already real
[20:06] everything else is a lower reflection of
[20:08] the real but when man has a thought he
[20:11] writes it on the blueprint and when he
[20:13] materializes it becomes a greater
[20:15] expression of his thought amen but for
[20:17] god the thought is the most real
[20:21] and everything else becomes a reflection
[20:24] amen and i would say maybe an inferior
[20:26] reflection i don't know
[20:28] but before there was sin before there
[20:31] was lucifer before sin broke out in
[20:33] heaven amen you already had existence
[20:36] because if you are part of the thinking
[20:38] of god if you're part of the word of god
[20:40] if you're an attribute of god amen then
[20:43] you already have eternal life you are as
[20:46] eternal as god is eternal
[20:48] amen
[20:49] so so this is this is uh
[20:53] where i just want to begin from and move
[20:54] from there before there was a speck of
[20:57] stardust before god was god
[21:00] he was only he was only known as eternal
[21:01] spirit the bride was already in his mind
[21:05] so
[21:06] let's just do it like this before all of
[21:08] this when we just have elohim
[21:14] the book was already in his mind
[21:18] i draw it as a book the old testament
[21:20] describes it or the new testament
[21:22] describes it as a scroll amen because
[21:24] that's the form the book had then i'm
[21:25] just drawing a book just so you need you
[21:27] know what i'm talking about this book of
[21:29] life was already in his thinking this
[21:31] book of life was already with him amen
[21:34] because it was a record of eternal life
[21:35] and all that was there at that time was
[21:38] eternal life
[21:39] when elohim was elohim before he was god
[21:42] all that had existed then was eternal
[21:44] life
[21:45] amen
[21:47] and so then when he created the heavens
[21:49] amen we know that even some of the
[21:52] heavenly beings that he created will not
[21:54] have eternal life because there's a lake
[21:56] of fire that they will be cast into and
[21:58] destroyed so their life will be
[22:00] terminated at some point so even the
[22:03] heavenly host will have an end to life
[22:05] amen and then then lucifer had a
[22:07] beginning to his creation he has an end
[22:10] to his creation amen but you as a son or
[22:12] daughter of god have no beginning to
[22:14] your creation and have no end to your
[22:16] creation that is the eternal life record
[22:19] that's contained within the book of life
[22:23] so
[22:24] the thing that i want us to see and i've
[22:27] been saying this it's not the first time
[22:28] i say this but i want us to see how
[22:31] secure we are in god and how perfect
[22:35] god's plan is
[22:38] i want to go in and read a couple more
[22:39] quotes here and in the first seal he
[22:41] says you see the book actually was
[22:43] planned and written before the
[22:45] foundation of the world
[22:48] this book the bible was really written
[22:50] before the foundation of the world
[22:52] and christ being the lamb was slain
[22:54] before the foundation of the world
[22:56] and the members of his bride their names
[22:59] were put in the lamb's book of life
[23:00] before the foundation of the world
[23:03] but it's been sealed up and now it's
[23:05] being revealed whose names were in there
[23:08] and all about it
[23:09] so before there was even a foundation to
[23:12] this world amen your name if you're part
[23:15] of god part of the bride was already
[23:18] recorded in this book so you're
[23:21] existence predated the earth that you're
[23:24] walking on
[23:26] you can pick up dirt amen you can touch
[23:29] a rock you can go back and see you know
[23:32] the the most ancient rock the oldest
[23:35] rocks amen that they can find on the
[23:37] earth and you realize that before that
[23:39] rock was formed your name was on the
[23:41] book of life before that rock was formed
[23:45] and so we feel like that rock of solid
[23:47] and this earth is solid amen and these
[23:49] things aren't changing we feel like
[23:51] these things are the solid elements
[23:53] standing up on the earth the solid rocks
[23:56] the things that don't change we realize
[23:59] these things amen are going to be
[24:01] transformed by fire amen but we existed
[24:04] before the rock
[24:09] in the mind of god
[24:11] every the members of his bride their
[24:13] names were put in the last book of life
[24:15] before the foundation of the world but
[24:17] it's been
[24:18] sealed up it's been sealed all the way
[24:20] but now it's unsealed friends
[24:23] it's been sealed up and now it's being
[24:24] revealed now that's what brother branham
[24:26] said it's been sealed up but now it's
[24:29] being revealed whose names were in there
[24:32] and all about it amen at the opening of
[24:34] the seals god begins to take the veil
[24:36] off and begin to show us that stream of
[24:38] life coming all the way down through and
[24:40] show us that book of life coming all the
[24:42] way down through
[24:44] let's look at genesis 18 together
[24:56] genesis 18 verse 16.
[25:05] and the men rose up from thence and
[25:07] looked toward sodom and abraham went
[25:09] with them to bring them on the way
[25:11] and the lord said shall i hide from
[25:14] abraham the thing which i do
[25:16] seeing that abraham shall surely become
[25:18] a great and mighty nation and all the
[25:20] nations of the earth shall be blessed in
[25:23] him
[25:24] and you know paul the apostle picks up
[25:26] this all nations will be blessed in
[25:29] abraham and shows that god preached the
[25:31] gospel unto abraham knowing that all
[25:34] nations would be blessed in him because
[25:35] he would bring salvation unto the
[25:37] heathen which would be considered by
[25:39] faith children of abraham and now when
[25:42] god is speaking to abraham the father of
[25:44] faith the father of us all by faith when
[25:47] he speaks to abraham he said shall he
[25:50] said
[25:51] shall i hide from abraham that thing
[25:53] which i do and now all of a sudden you
[25:55] realize when god comes to the father of
[25:58] faith to abraham who now has the promise
[26:00] who we who paul says is heir of the
[26:02] world now when he comes to him he says
[26:05] shall i hide anything from abraham
[26:07] saying he surely will become a mighty
[26:08] nation and all nations shall be blessed
[26:10] in him but listen friends we come right
[26:12] down that same promise right down that
[26:14] same lineage and i would like to say
[26:16] this that when god goes to reveal
[26:19] anything he doesn't hide it from the
[26:21] seed of abraham
[26:23] and now at the end time when god goes to
[26:26] show us the end time seal amen in the
[26:28] wrapping up of all things amen will god
[26:31] hide it from the seed of abraham that
[26:33] thing that he shall do
[26:36] so now we know who the revelation comes
[26:38] to let's go over to revelation chapter
[26:40] 10.
[26:45] we know it by heart but we're going to
[26:47] read it together
[26:48] revelation chapter 10
[26:50] verse 7
[26:53] but in the days of the voice of the
[26:54] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[26:57] sound the mystery of god should be
[26:58] finished as he has declared to his
[27:01] servants the prophets
[27:04] he says
[27:06] in the rising of the sun
[27:08] he is the one who opened those seals
[27:11] he is those seals
[27:14] for the whole word of god is christ and
[27:17] christ is the seals that was open
[27:20] what is the opening of the seals
[27:22] revealing christ
[27:24] amen praise god
[27:26] i'm going to move this picture over
[27:29] so
[27:31] he's the one who opened the seals he is
[27:34] those seals
[27:36] he is the mystery of god amen christ is
[27:39] the mystery of god revealed the mystery
[27:42] that was sealed up is revealed in christ
[27:44] christ is the mystery as it's been
[27:45] coming through because christ is the
[27:47] word the anointed word made manifest in
[27:50] that day that's christ so christ is the
[27:52] mystery of god revealed
[27:54] now he says in the message christ is the
[27:57] mystery of god revealed i want to read
[27:58] this quote it's a long quote so stay
[28:00] with me he says now for a text i want to
[28:03] take out of there this for a text basing
[28:05] it upon the entire bible but i want i
[28:08] want us to title this christ is the
[28:10] mystery of god revealed so now brother
[28:13] branham we know this super well but now
[28:16] he's going to preach christ is the
[28:17] mystery of god revealed he's going to
[28:19] take out of there a text but he's going
[28:20] to base it on the entire bible
[28:23] so the entire bible amen is revealed as
[28:27] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[28:30] christ being the mystery of god revealed
[28:32] now i took it in the order of a sunday
[28:34] school lesson so we could all read
[28:35] together and have this fellowship
[28:37] together
[28:38] now god's secret mystery he had before
[28:40] the world began now back in the back
[28:42] part of god's mind there was something
[28:45] that he was trying and was going to
[28:47] achieve and he had a motive in doing it
[28:49] so i want to come back here i i
[28:52] hold off with this too quick
[28:54] back when he was elohim
[28:57] back when god was alone in his thoughts
[28:59] he had something he wanted to achieve
[29:01] that's what brother ben says he says
[29:04] uh
[29:04] now he says
[29:06] now god's great secret he had before the
[29:09] world began
[29:11] back in the back part of god's mind
[29:13] there was something that he was trying
[29:15] and was going to achieve and he had a
[29:17] motive in doing it in order to let
[29:20] himself be expressed because first there
[29:23] wasn't even a moon star adam molecule
[29:27] anything he was god but exactly wasn't
[29:30] god at that time because god is an
[29:32] object of worship and there wasn't
[29:34] nothing to worship him so back when god
[29:36] was elohim the self-existing one alone
[29:39] with his thoughts amen he had a he had
[29:41] formulated a plan he had a desire a way
[29:44] in which he could be expressed a way in
[29:46] which he could express himself amen and
[29:49] so when he began to create his creation
[29:52] was going to be reflecting this thought
[29:54] that he had a way in which he could
[29:57] express himself for the whole purpose
[29:59] was for this great self-existing one who
[30:01] dwelt alone to express himself because
[30:04] he wanted fellowship so in order to have
[30:06] fellowship he was going to come in a
[30:08] multiplied form so that his attributes
[30:11] could fellowship together as a family of
[30:13] god upon the earth
[30:15] so in order to do that he wanted each
[30:17] part of this attribute each part of
[30:19] himself to have a comprehension and
[30:21] understanding he wanted a way to fully
[30:23] express himself amen for and give a full
[30:26] revelation of himself and unite himself
[30:28] together and have fellowship together
[30:30] upon the earth
[30:31] so god formulated a plan and the first
[30:34] thing he did in this plan is he created
[30:36] the heavens and he created angelic
[30:38] beings and he created these things that
[30:39] would worship him and when they began to
[30:41] worship him he became god he became the
[30:43] object of worship and he started his
[30:45] plan there amen and at some point he
[30:48] formulated an earth amen we don't know
[30:50] exactly when he began to formulate the
[30:52] earth and what exactly happened before
[30:54] genesis 1 1 and rpg before genesis
[30:57] between genesis 1 1 and genesis 1 2 that
[31:00] he formed the heavens and then he formed
[31:02] the earth
[31:03] and we realized that before before there
[31:07] was one speck of stardust before there
[31:09] was an atom before there was anything
[31:12] that's what brother branham said god
[31:13] already had a plan he already had
[31:16] written the lamb's book of life before
[31:17] the foundation of the world so god
[31:20] already knew that there would be a lamb
[31:22] slain for redemption purposes meaning
[31:25] god already knew there was going to be a
[31:27] fall
[31:28] but listen sin did not originate on
[31:31] earth sin originated in heaven so god
[31:34] when he was making the heavenly host he
[31:36] already knew there was going to be sin
[31:38] in heaven
[31:41] because he made the heavenly host before
[31:42] he made the earthly host and before he
[31:44] made the earthly creation he already had
[31:46] a book written the lamb's book of life
[31:48] and he already had a plan of redemption
[31:50] amen because there was a lamb slain
[31:51] before the foundation of the world
[31:55] god
[31:56] knew
[31:58] that's why amen that's why none of
[32:01] lucifer's plans will ever stop god's
[32:04] plan lucifer plan is working into god's
[32:07] plan
[32:08] that's why we are not afraid of the
[32:10] devil the devil brother branham said is
[32:12] a tool in god's hand for bringing out
[32:15] amen all of his plan everything he wants
[32:18] to express he needed an adversary he
[32:21] needed a backdrop of black so that the
[32:23] white of his righteousness would stand
[32:25] down so that he could express himself
[32:27] amen so god knew there would be a fall
[32:30] before he created the earth before there
[32:32] was one speck of stardust amen he knew
[32:35] there would be a fall because he was the
[32:36] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[32:38] world
[32:39] so the devil is a tool in the god in the
[32:42] tool in god's hand so that god can
[32:44] express himself
[32:47] because he could not express healer
[32:50] unless something was sick he could not
[32:52] express savior unless something was lost
[32:54] he could not express his power as one
[32:56] who could restore unless there was
[32:58] something that needed restored
[33:00] all right we understand that concept so
[33:03] now before all of that god already had a
[33:06] plan so lucifer amen although what
[33:09] lucifer did was terrible it was
[33:11] absolutely terrible what happened in the
[33:14] heavenly realms and the rebellion
[33:15] against god it was horrible amen but it
[33:18] didn't stop god's plan all it did was
[33:21] move his plan into further action
[33:23] because when lucifer was cast out he
[33:25] came to the earth and some time later he
[33:27] brought his deception amen into the
[33:29] garden of eden and what happened in the
[33:31] garden of eden was also terrible
[33:34] is that right
[33:35] but what happened in the garden of eden
[33:36] was terrible amen but it didn't stop
[33:39] god's plan it moved god's plan into
[33:41] further manifestation because we've got
[33:43] to get down to this lamb slain before
[33:45] the foundation of the world
[33:48] so when man foul man set up the need for
[33:50] redemption when he set up the need for
[33:52] redemption now he set up the need for
[33:54] the lamb
[33:56] but the lamb was already slain in god's
[33:58] mind before the foundation of the world
[34:01] so just lock this away in the in the
[34:03] safe of your mind that nothing that the
[34:05] devil's doing can stop god's plan the
[34:08] only thing he can do is be used as the
[34:10] tool in the hand of god to move god's
[34:12] plan further along
[34:14] so when the devil comes against you amen
[34:16] and you feel amen the press and you feel
[34:18] the the attack amen he cannot thwart
[34:22] god's word he cannot overcome god's
[34:24] purpose he cannot stop god from
[34:27] expressing and manifesting himself the
[34:30] way he desired before there was one
[34:32] molecule before there was heaven when he
[34:33] was alone and as elohim he already had a
[34:36] thought to express himself and now
[34:38] you're here as part of that expression
[34:40] to express part of him and nothing the
[34:42] devil can do can stop that expression
[34:46] nothing it was determined before there
[34:48] was a lucifer before lucifer became the
[34:50] devil
[34:52] it was already determined
[34:54] so when you feel the press and you feel
[34:56] the battle and you feel everything just
[34:58] realize god's expressing amen god is
[35:01] expressing and if the devil is given any
[35:04] amen any ability amen to press you or to
[35:07] try you just realize that god is
[35:09] expressing
[35:11] and don't be afraid of those things
[35:14] i think the worst thing that plagues us
[35:16] is fear
[35:19] and the the seals came open to give us
[35:22] amen a revelation all the way back
[35:24] before there was anything else created
[35:26] that can harm us
[35:28] to show us how secure we are to take
[35:30] away fear amen because the thing that's
[35:33] tripping us up and shutting us down the
[35:35] thing that's inhibiting us is fear amen
[35:37] and there is no reason to be afraid
[35:41] that's what the revelation under the
[35:42] seals showed us that there's no reason
[35:45] to be afraid
[35:47] amen
[35:49] praise god
[35:50] i'm going to keep reading here in christ
[35:51] is the mystery of god reveal
[35:53] so in his great mind he wanted these
[35:55] attributes to be expressed and in him
[35:58] was love in him was to be father and him
[36:01] was to be son in him was to be savior in
[36:03] him was to be healer and all these great
[36:06] attributes that we see already expressed
[36:08] they were in god
[36:10] so my opinion the first thing that he
[36:12] made was angels and then they worshipped
[36:14] him and that made him god and he started
[36:16] from there as in previous message i've
[36:18] tried to explain it to break it down and
[36:20] now when angels begin to worship him
[36:23] that was before there was even a
[36:24] molecule in the earth there was nothing
[36:26] it was all darkness there wasn't no sun
[36:28] nor no moon nor stars no nothing then he
[36:31] was god as he asked job where was you
[36:34] when i laid the foundation of the world
[36:36] see when the morning stars sang together
[36:38] the sons of god shout out for joy see
[36:40] now where were you that was way back
[36:43] before the earth
[36:45] way back before the earth the sons of
[36:47] god were already singing and shouting in
[36:48] the mind of god when when god showed him
[36:51] the plan of redemption
[36:53] he showed them the plan of redemption
[36:55] before they needed a plan of redemption
[36:58] and they were rejoicing and shouting
[37:01] over the plan of redemption before there
[37:03] was a need for a plan of redemption
[37:05] listen friends we're now in the
[37:07] redemption amen redemption has come full
[37:10] circle and if we could sing and shout
[37:11] there we can sing and shout here because
[37:14] this is the fullness of redemption
[37:16] that's coming to mankind in the end time
[37:19] we already we already saw the plan he
[37:22] already showed it to the sons of god we
[37:24] are already saying we already shouted
[37:26] for joy when he showed us the plan of
[37:28] redemption and now at the opening of the
[37:30] seals he has showed us once again the
[37:33] plan of redemption
[37:36] where are we we are back in the mind of
[37:39] god
[37:42] amen don't listen we we have entered
[37:46] back into the mind of god by the opening
[37:49] of the seals by a prophetic ministry
[37:51] taking us back to the mystery that was
[37:53] in the back part of god's mind you know
[37:55] you have to remember brother branham is
[37:57] using terminology does god have a back
[37:59] part of his mind
[38:02] does he have a front part and a back
[38:04] part what brother banh is showing us is
[38:06] under uh before everything preceding
[38:09] everything amen there was a mystery that
[38:11] had stayed hidden to even in heaven
[38:14] heaven his brother better said this book
[38:16] was sealed even in heaven
[38:20] the angels didn't know anything about it
[38:22] the cerebellums the cherubims the
[38:24] the heavenly host they didn't know
[38:26] anything about this book this book was
[38:27] sealed even in heaven it was in the back
[38:29] part of god's mind this mystery was hid
[38:32] away away from lucifer away from angelic
[38:36] beings away from humanity it was sealed
[38:39] away in the mind of god
[38:42] but at the opening of the seals he
[38:44] brought what was in the back part of
[38:45] god's mind that god had expressed in
[38:48] symbol form and spelled it out in types
[38:50] they meant through the bible now at the
[38:52] breaking of the seals brother branham
[38:53] goes back and he takes the types and he
[38:56] takes the symbols and he takes the story
[38:58] and the fall of the garden of eden and
[38:59] the creation of man and ruth and and all
[39:02] of these types in the bible of joseph
[39:05] and his gentile bride and revealing
[39:07] himself to brother he goes all the way
[39:09] back and shows us this mystery was in
[39:11] the back part of god's mind
[39:14] that god kept it in the back part of his
[39:16] mind and he showed it in type in the
[39:18] bible but kept the mystery in the back
[39:20] part of his mind
[39:22] so it was sealed
[39:24] where was it sealed in the back part of
[39:25] his mind
[39:27] then when he comes to the opening of the
[39:29] seals in revelation in the time of john
[39:32] he takes john and a vision to heaven and
[39:33] he shows him amen the breaking of the
[39:35] seals but he shows him the breaking of
[39:37] the seals in symbol form because the
[39:39] mystery itself was still sealed in the
[39:41] back part of his mind
[39:43] but in the end time god takes a profit
[39:46] amen and through that prophetic ministry
[39:48] the lamb comes himself and breaks the
[39:50] seals and through that prophet reveals
[39:52] the seals to us and what does he do when
[39:54] he breaks the seals he takes us back to
[39:56] the back part of god's mind where this
[39:58] mystery's been hiding all along
[40:02] what is that back part of god's mind
[40:05] that's where i originated
[40:08] this ministry this message has taken me
[40:11] back home
[40:12] back to my origin back to my beginning
[40:14] back
[40:16] to where i was
[40:21] amen
[40:24] that's why
[40:26] when he tore the seals off the mystery
[40:27] of god he took the seal off of your life
[40:34] continue on in christ is the mystery of
[40:36] god revealing now god had a purpose and
[40:38] a hidden mystery
[40:40] and that's what i want to speak on to
[40:42] the church this morning the hidden
[40:43] mystery of god that he had in his mind
[40:45] before the world ever began
[40:48] and how that it's unfolded itself right
[40:50] down to this present hour that we're
[40:51] living
[40:52] then you will understand clearly then
[40:54] you see i believe on what's been
[40:57] what
[40:58] what it has been doing what what has
[41:00] been being done i'm sorry what is being
[41:02] done
[41:03] god's great mystery of how it's a secret
[41:04] he kept it a secret nobody know nothing
[41:06] about it even the angels didn't
[41:08] understand it see he didn't reveal it
[41:11] that's the reason under our seventh
[41:12] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[41:14] there was silence jesus when he was on
[41:16] earth they wanted to know when he would
[41:18] come he said not even the son himself
[41:20] don't know when it's when it's going to
[41:22] happen see god has this all to himself
[41:24] it's a secret and that's the reason
[41:26] there was silence in heaven for the
[41:28] space of half an hour and seven thunders
[41:30] uttered their voices and john was even
[41:32] forbidden to write it see the coming of
[41:35] the lord
[41:36] that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[41:37] of how he will come when he will come
[41:40] it's a good thing that he doesn't know
[41:42] he has showed or revealed it in every
[41:44] type that's in the bible
[41:48] therefore the entire bible is the
[41:50] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[41:53] god hasn't shown this mystery but he
[41:54] showed the mystery
[41:58] it's revealed in every type
[42:00] hmm the entire bible is an expression of
[42:02] one goal that god had one purpose he
[42:05] wanted to achieve in the entire bible
[42:07] you catch that the entire bible is an
[42:10] expression of one goal
[42:12] that god had one purpose he wanted to
[42:15] achieve in the entire bible and all the
[42:18] acts of the believers in the bible has
[42:20] been in time in expressing what god's
[42:22] great goal is and now in this last day
[42:25] he has revealed it and shows it in god's
[42:28] help well you'll see it right here this
[42:30] morning what the lord has had in his
[42:32] mind all along and has expressed it
[42:36] so the bible is showing one goal
[42:40] one purpose
[42:42] one great mystery it was one great
[42:44] mystery in the back part of god's mind
[42:45] but one thing he wanted to achieve and
[42:47] the entire bible has been expressing
[42:49] this one thing he wanted to achieve amen
[42:52] and what was the thing he wanted to
[42:53] achieve he wanted to be expressed amen
[42:58] let's go to revelation 10 now
[43:01] verse 8.
[43:03] we read 10 7 now 3 10 8
[43:06] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[43:07] spake unto me again and said go and take
[43:09] the little book which is open in the
[43:11] hand of the angel which standeth upon
[43:13] the sea and upon the earth
[43:17] and i went to the angel and said unto
[43:19] him give me the little book and he said
[43:20] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[43:23] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[43:25] be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[43:28] and i took the little book out of the
[43:29] angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[43:31] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i
[43:33] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[43:36] saith unto me
[43:38] thou must prophesy again before many
[43:40] peoples and nations and tongues and
[43:42] kings
[43:44] amen this little book that john is
[43:47] eating was the sealed book in revelation
[43:50] chapter five that's what brother brahm
[43:51] tells us in the sealed book in
[43:53] revelation chapter 5 nobody could touch
[43:55] it
[43:56] nobody could read it and nobody could
[43:58] even look at it
[44:00] why it was in the back part of god's
[44:02] mind
[44:03] nobody could touch it nobody could look
[44:06] upon it no man was worthy amen but the
[44:09] lamb was found worthy so he went and
[44:11] took the book and he opened the seals
[44:13] thereof amen and he come down the mighty
[44:16] angel come down with an open book in his
[44:18] hand and now the book that no man could
[44:21] touch no man could read no man could
[44:23] look at now a voice from heaven says go
[44:25] to the angel and take the book and eat
[44:27] it now he's going to take the same book
[44:29] amen that adam had remember some sunday
[44:32] adam had this book it was the title deed
[44:34] to all creation it was the right to rule
[44:36] creation
[44:38] adam forfeited the book brother bam said
[44:40] it went back into the hands of god to
[44:42] keep it out of the hands of lucifer out
[44:45] of the hands of the devil
[44:46] and it's been in god's hand amen but now
[44:49] in the end time that book is now going
[44:52] to come down in the hand of the mighty
[44:54] angel and that book that's been sealed
[44:56] for all this time is now an open book
[44:58] and when it's an open book now john
[45:00] who's the type of the bride he can go
[45:02] and take and eat the book that nobody
[45:04] could touch look at or read
[45:07] now john's commissioned to eat the book
[45:09] when he eats the book he becomes one
[45:11] with it amen the revelations part of the
[45:13] revelation the revelation becomes part
[45:14] of him and it's sweet in his mouth when
[45:17] he's becoming one with it when he's
[45:18] taking it in it's sweet when he has to
[45:20] digest it and live it it becomes bitter
[45:22] because all the rejection of christ
[45:24] comes upon you
[45:26] because it's the rejection of the word
[45:29] but knitting must prophesy again so out
[45:31] of them must come the word that he's
[45:33] eaten
[45:35] now
[45:36] john can eat the book
[45:39] the question is when john ate the book
[45:42] is there any left over for me to eat
[45:46] have you eaten the book
[45:48] he was john was told
[45:50] to eat it up to eat all of it
[45:53] john ate all of it but somehow there's
[45:55] still all of it for me to eat
[45:57] there's still all of it for you to eat
[45:59] this is a book unlike any other book
[46:01] we've ever seen
[46:03] amen this is the mystery that was in
[46:06] god's mind this is the revelation of the
[46:09] one purpose the one goal the one desire
[46:12] that god had amen has been sealed in
[46:14] this book in this book amen it's not
[46:17] just reams and reams and reams of paper
[46:19] amen it's the mystery that has now come
[46:22] down at the time of the opening of the
[46:23] seals and now has been made available to
[46:25] man what man couldn't have what man
[46:27] couldn't know now he's supposed to take
[46:29] it in by revelation and become one with
[46:31] it and now the revelation is in that man
[46:36] and now amen i can eat all of the book
[46:39] but yet you can eat all the book amen
[46:41] i'm feeding on christ are you feeding on
[46:43] christ
[46:44] so if i feed on christ is there lust of
[46:46] christ for you to feed on
[46:48] if i eat a whole bunch is there less for
[46:50] you to have
[46:51] or is there same amount of christ
[46:53] available to you as available to me so
[46:56] we all can eat christ and there's still
[46:58] all of christ left to be eaten
[47:02] amen christ proves this at the breaking
[47:04] of the bread and the fishes amen it
[47:06] never runs out never runs out never runs
[47:08] out amen you cannot out eat amen this
[47:11] manna that came down from heaven amen i
[47:14] i can eat all that god has allotted for
[47:15] me i can eat all of christ but there's
[47:17] still all of christ for you to eat
[47:21] amen remember these are symbols amen
[47:23] trying to get us to a deeper
[47:24] understanding
[47:29] so now
[47:30] where is the book
[47:34] where is the book it depends on where
[47:36] you are in the story
[47:40] for john the book was now in john
[47:44] but there come a time for me that the
[47:46] book was sealed
[47:49] i hope you forgive me for saying that
[47:50] but for me from my perspective there was
[47:52] a time in my life even though the seals
[47:54] were open in 1963 there was a time in my
[47:57] life the book was sealed
[47:59] for me
[48:01] and there was a time in my life when i
[48:03] saw the lamb come forth and take the
[48:04] book and come down with the open book in
[48:07] his hand amen and for me the book was
[48:09] open in the hand of christ and then i
[48:11] went to christ to get the revelation of
[48:13] that book and he gave the book to me and
[48:15] i ate it up and now for me the book is
[48:17] in me
[48:19] but for you the book might be sealed
[48:22] for you the book still might be in the
[48:24] hands of christ you may not have yet
[48:25] gone and taken the book and got the
[48:27] revelation for yourself amen for some of
[48:29] us the book's in us for some of us the
[48:31] books in his hand for some of us the
[48:33] book sealed
[48:40] praise be to god
[48:42] that's why
[48:43] different people will react to the
[48:46] message differently depending on where
[48:48] that book is to them
[48:51] and the way they look at the quotes and
[48:53] the way they see the scriptures and the
[48:54] way they live their life will be
[48:56] dependent on where that book is to them
[48:59] and their perspectives
[49:06] see when you talk about spiritual things
[49:10] they don't operate by the same laws as
[49:12] natural things
[49:18] so sometimes you can see where somebody
[49:20] is in
[49:21] the journey of the book
[49:24] by just the revelation and conduct and
[49:26] attitude of their life attitude towards
[49:28] the message revelation of the message
[49:31] you can begin to see where that book is
[49:33] to them
[49:37] and that's why
[49:39] i choose not to argue with people
[49:41] because when they say the seven steel is
[49:43] not open that's fine i mean
[49:46] because for you it's not open
[49:48] so why would i argue with you and say
[49:50] it's open for you it's not open
[49:52] but for me it's open so there's no
[49:54] reason to argue because the seventh seal
[49:56] can be sealed and open at the same time
[49:59] for you it's sealed for me it's open
[50:03] i hope that makes sense i hope you don't
[50:05] think that i've gone off on the deep end
[50:07] amen
[50:09] but but the way we talk about the
[50:11] message the quotes we gravitate to the
[50:14] things we tend to repeat and the
[50:16] statements we make will show where we
[50:19] are in the journey of the book
[50:21] and where we are in relation to the
[50:23] journey of the book so when somebody
[50:25] says that that the seals aren't open
[50:27] then there's no reason to argue with
[50:30] somebody who says the seals aren't open
[50:34] because for them the seals aren't open
[50:37] but neither is there any reason to argue
[50:39] with me when i say the seals are open
[50:40] because for me the seals are open
[50:43] i've eaten the book you can't you can't
[50:45] take it out of me it's become one with
[50:47] me i've already eaten it i already had
[50:49] the sensation of sweeten my mouth and i
[50:51] already knows what it means to be bitter
[50:52] in my belly
[50:54] so you cannot take that book away from
[50:57] me i've eaten the book amen and me and
[50:59] the book have become one i already have
[51:01] the same experience as spoken of in the
[51:03] scriptures and what brother branham
[51:04] tells us so you can't tell me the seals
[51:07] aren't open but neither can i tell you
[51:09] that the seals are open
[51:13] we all have to go to the message and
[51:15] find out where we are
[51:17] we got to look into the word and find
[51:19] out where we are amen we're beyond the
[51:21] time of trying to persuade people to see
[51:23] things and we're beyond the time of
[51:25] trying to convince people and we're also
[51:27] beyond the time of trying to feel con
[51:29] convinced ourselves when we can convince
[51:31] somebody else amen this is an individual
[51:33] revelation to one person not a church
[51:35] not a group of people but to the
[51:37] individual that's what brother branham
[51:39] is teaching us after the opening of the
[51:41] seals this is no longer church this is
[51:43] bride this is to one this message came
[51:45] to one it came to you
[51:49] and now i'm not going to get my security
[51:52] from you agreeing with me
[51:54] [Applause]
[51:56] that's where the denominations were and
[51:58] they all fell they all agreed and they
[52:00] all went off the word agreeing that they
[52:02] were right
[52:04] so my security cannot come from you
[52:07] agreeing with me
[52:09] because then we take back another
[52:11] denominational spirit
[52:14] my security can only come when i know
[52:17] that i've met the mighty angel with the
[52:19] open book and i've taken that book and i
[52:21] began to eat that book and it was sweet
[52:23] in my mouth and it was bitter in my
[52:25] belly amen but now there's something in
[52:28] me like a spring of living water flowing
[52:31] out to eternal life that that revelation
[52:33] of the book is coming out of my mouth
[52:35] amen
[52:37] placing me amen in revelation chapter 10
[52:40] verse 11.
[52:42] you can't put me back in five because
[52:44] i'm in 11. i'm in revelation 10 11. you
[52:47] can't take me back to 5-1
[52:52] now if you're in 5-1 i say keep walking
[52:55] brother there's good roads ahead amen
[52:58] you're on the right path you're on the
[53:00] right trail you're in the book of
[53:01] revelation you're moving down through if
[53:03] you've just come to the message or god's
[53:05] never opened this to you and you're
[53:06] looking at revelations 5 1 and saying we
[53:08] need a lamb to come and take the book i
[53:10] say you're on the right path keep moving
[53:12] down because as you move through that
[53:14] book of revelation in the message of the
[53:16] hour you're going to find that there's a
[53:18] lamb that's come forth to take the book
[53:19] and loose the seven seals thereof
[53:22] keep walking brother don't take my word
[53:25] for it get in the word and keep walking
[53:27] amen
[53:29] because this has to be a revelation to
[53:31] the individual
[53:33] this book has to be in you
[53:36] amen
[53:38] this book that was in the back part of
[53:40] god's mind that was sealed in heaven
[53:44] has to be unsealed in you
[53:48] praise god
[53:52] brother bam said in christ is a mystery
[53:54] god revealed notice
[53:55] next secondly the manifested christ in
[53:58] you the hope of glory
[53:59] the great manifested god in christ now
[54:02] christ manifested in you we'll hurry
[54:04] look what was once god's great secret
[54:07] great mysterious secret in his mind
[54:10] is now put in the hearts of the believer
[54:13] that is the body of christ
[54:15] oh do you understand what he's saying
[54:18] what was the mysterious secret when he
[54:20] was elohim all alone with his thoughts
[54:22] amen there was a plan there was a
[54:24] thought there was a desire to be
[54:26] expressed that was the that was the that
[54:29] was the thought of god then as he began
[54:31] to express there was a mystery in all
[54:33] the expression because all of the
[54:35] expression was reflecting back to a
[54:37] thought that he had in his mind
[54:40] an achievement that he wanted to achieve
[54:42] a purpose in doing everything that he
[54:44] did that he wanted to be expressed and
[54:46] everything was reflecting back to that
[54:47] but everything came with a mystery
[54:49] everything came with a seal upon it
[54:52] but now what was once a mystery secret
[54:56] in the back part of god's mind is now in
[54:59] the body of his believers amen it's now
[55:02] is now put into the heart of the
[55:04] believer that is the body of christ so
[55:07] where is the mystery secret now it's in
[55:09] christ
[55:13] where is christ christ is a mini-member
[55:15] bride upon the earth where is the
[55:16] mystery secret inside those who went to
[55:19] the mighty angel and ate the book now
[55:21] the mystery that was sealed in the back
[55:23] part of god's mind is now in the
[55:25] believer amen
[55:27] [Music]
[55:29] what was god's once great secret in his
[55:31] mind before the foundational world is
[55:33] now made manifest think of that
[55:35] i'm sure we don't get it i can't see it
[55:38] the way i ought to i'm sure you don't
[55:40] but god's great mystery what the eternal
[55:43] god had as a mystery has now been
[55:44] unfolded in jesus christ then given
[55:47] right down to his church what was once
[55:49] in god's mind is now in the body of
[55:52] christ jesus making love to the church
[55:56] his bride whispering secrets to her
[56:00] oh praise god if you've never had him
[56:02] whisper the love secrets to you then you
[56:04] don't know how wonderful this is amen
[56:07] when god begins to give you revelation
[56:09] upon revelation of the mystery that he
[56:11] had before the foundation of the world
[56:13] when the seals come off and you begin to
[56:15] see that purpose god had and the bible
[56:17] expressing the entire mystery amen if
[56:20] you've never had him whisper the
[56:21] revelation revelatory love secrets to
[56:24] your year you don't know how wonderful
[56:26] it is because once he's whispered the
[56:28] love secrets to you the most wonderful
[56:30] thing that you ever experience in your
[56:32] life is revelation on the word
[56:34] and when god opens the word to you it
[56:36] does something for you like nothing else
[56:38] can
[56:39] when god begins to unveil himself it'll
[56:41] unveil himself in this scripture and to
[56:43] unveil himself in this story he unveiled
[56:46] himself in this book of the bible and as
[56:48] he begins to peel the layer back and
[56:50] begins to unveil himself to you and show
[56:52] you the mystery secret laying in ruth
[56:54] laying an esther laying in deborah amen
[56:56] all of a sudden you say oh god i love
[56:58] you i love you so much because your plan
[57:01] is so perfect
[57:04] whispering secrets to her
[57:08] then further down in christ mr god
[57:10] revealed he says identified oh the devil
[57:13] is howling about this
[57:16] what's the devil howling about
[57:18] the manifested truth of the promise of
[57:20] the word and her
[57:23] alone
[57:28] this is what the devil's howling about
[57:30] no other church system
[57:32] no denomination
[57:34] no other form of teaching
[57:37] the manifested truth of the promise of
[57:39] the word in her alone the bride has it
[57:43] and only the bride has it
[57:49] and the devil's howling about that
[57:52] i say let him howl
[57:56] because this revelation
[57:59] and i
[58:00] are eternally united
[58:04] we were bound
[58:06] i was bound with this revelation in god
[58:10] before the foundation of the world and i
[58:12] am bound to it here in this expression
[58:14] by revelation
[58:20] brother brahma says in the breach
[58:23] he said he said
[58:25] there's someone paid that price that i
[58:27] couldn't pay that's right he did it for
[58:29] me charlie he did it for you he did it
[58:32] for the whole human race and now he
[58:33] comes forth to claim his redemptive
[58:35] rights claim it for who
[58:37] not for himself
[58:39] for us
[58:41] he's one of us he's our kin folks
[58:46] i want you to understand what brother
[58:47] branham's saying
[58:49] he's not saying when jesus christ
[58:51] stepped forward and claimed the book of
[58:53] redemption the title deed the book of
[58:55] redemption the heritage of all creation
[58:58] when he comes and takes that he's saying
[59:00] who did he take it for for himself
[59:02] brother bam saying that not that he
[59:04] doesn't get the title deed the right to
[59:06] rule in the millennium that's not it he
[59:08] says not for himself alone
[59:12] but he redeemed it for
[59:14] us
[59:16] who's us who's all included in us
[59:19] he's one of us he's our kinfolk so when
[59:23] he claimed it for us he claimed it for
[59:25] bride and groom together
[59:27] because they are joint heirs with him in
[59:29] his inheritance so let's go back to
[59:32] romans chapter 4.
[59:34] i want to read a couple of the
[59:35] scriptures we've been reading but i want
[59:36] to read it in this light because now he
[59:38] comes to claim the book of redemption
[59:40] the title deed and then he come to claim
[59:43] it not for himself but for us he's one
[59:46] of us so he's included in us
[59:50] he's kin folks with us
[59:54] that's why we'll rule and reign with him
[59:56] for a thousand years as joint
[59:58] heirs for chapter 4 13
[1:00:02] for the promise that he should be heir
[1:00:04] of the world was not to abraham or to
[1:00:06] his steed through the law but through
[1:00:08] the righteousness of faith so the
[1:00:10] promise to abraham is that he will be
[1:00:13] heir of the world do you see that in
[1:00:15] that scripture
[1:00:17] he should be heir of the world was not
[1:00:18] to abraham to his seed through the law
[1:00:20] so now it's not coming through a jewish
[1:00:22] heritage or a keeping of the law or the
[1:00:24] commandments but through the
[1:00:26] righteousness of faith now let's turn to
[1:00:28] galatians
[1:00:30] chapter 3.
[1:00:36] galatians chapter 3
[1:00:39] verse 16.
[1:00:43] now to abraham and his seed where the
[1:00:44] promises made
[1:00:46] one of those is that he'll be heir of
[1:00:47] the world is that right
[1:00:49] now to abraham and his seed where the
[1:00:50] promise is made he saith not in the
[1:00:52] seeds as of many but as of one and to
[1:00:54] thy seed which is christ so christ is
[1:00:57] that seed who will be heir of the world
[1:01:00] verse 29
[1:01:02] and if you be christ then you're
[1:01:04] abraham's seed and heirs according to
[1:01:06] the promise so when jesus christ goes as
[1:01:10] the lamb and claims back the book of
[1:01:12] redemption he claimed it for us
[1:01:16] who's us
[1:01:17] he's one of us
[1:01:19] he took it for him and his bride because
[1:01:22] he and his bride have become one amen so
[1:01:25] he took it for us
[1:01:27] that's why when a when a man gets
[1:01:29] married and he buys a home he buys a
[1:01:31] home for us
[1:01:33] he doesn't buy a home for him he buys a
[1:01:35] home for us he said this is our house
[1:01:37] when jesus christ claimed the book of
[1:01:39] redemption he claimed it for us
[1:01:41] he's one of us
[1:01:44] all right let's go to hebrews chapter 2.
[1:01:46] we've been reading these scriptures but
[1:01:47] i want to refresh them in our minds and
[1:01:49] read them in this context
[1:01:51] and then keep moving i am so running out
[1:01:53] of time friends there are so much in my
[1:01:55] heart that i want to share but language
[1:01:58] and time and human ability has all
[1:02:01] ruined everything amen
[1:02:03] but just bear with me and keep pulling
[1:02:05] but there's so much on my heart
[1:02:07] hebrews chapter 2
[1:02:08] verse 10
[1:02:11] for it became him for whom are all
[1:02:13] things and by whom are all things to
[1:02:15] bring many sons into glory to make the
[1:02:17] captain of their salvation perfect
[1:02:19] through suffering for both he that
[1:02:21] sanctifieth and they who are sanctified
[1:02:24] are all of one
[1:02:28] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:02:30] call them brethren
[1:02:31] he's one of us we're one with him
[1:02:36] he that sanctifieth and he that
[1:02:37] sanctified are all of one
[1:02:40] brother brennan says in satan's eden and
[1:02:42] so god knew that he would be here but
[1:02:44] then he put he put us on in flesh so we
[1:02:47] could be contacted in order he could
[1:02:49] contact he became one of us when he
[1:02:52] became jesus christ the son of god
[1:02:53] himself the fullness of the
[1:02:55] manifestation of god
[1:02:57] therefore that was god's purpose to
[1:02:59] display his attributes and fellowship
[1:03:01] when i was in my father i knew nothing
[1:03:03] about it but when i became a son and was
[1:03:05] born of him i was an attribute a part of
[1:03:07] my father and you were part of your
[1:03:08] father and as children of god we are
[1:03:10] part of god's attribute that was in him
[1:03:13] made flesh like he was made flesh so we
[1:03:15] could have fellowship one with other as
[1:03:17] a family of god upon the earth and that
[1:03:19] was god's purpose at the beginning yes
[1:03:21] sir that's what god wanted at the
[1:03:24] beginning
[1:03:26] let's go to romans chapter 8.
[1:03:29] don't forget this scripture that we just
[1:03:31] read
[1:03:32] that he is sanctifieth and he that
[1:03:33] sanctified her all of one we're going to
[1:03:35] come back to that
[1:03:37] but let's jump over to romans 8 now
[1:03:45] romans chapter 8 verse 29
[1:03:49] for when he for whom he did for know
[1:03:52] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:03:55] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:03:56] the firstborn among many brethren
[1:03:59] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:04:01] he also called whom he called them he
[1:04:03] also justified whom he justified them he
[1:04:06] also glorified what shall we then say to
[1:04:09] these things if god before us who can be
[1:04:12] against us
[1:04:13] when was god for us
[1:04:16] amen before there was a molecule or a
[1:04:18] speck of stardust when we were in the
[1:04:20] thoughts of god he predestinated us by
[1:04:23] foreknowledge he knew we would be here
[1:04:24] and what purpose we would play and what
[1:04:26] role we would play and before there was
[1:04:28] one speck of stardust he was already for
[1:04:31] us
[1:04:33] and we were already glorified in that
[1:04:35] thought so if god before us who can be
[1:04:37] against us
[1:04:40] in the message who is this melchizedek
[1:04:43] he says being eternal with him at the
[1:04:45] beginning were you eternal with him at
[1:04:47] the beginning
[1:04:48] amen the eternal life that you had his
[1:04:50] thought of what you was only he wanted
[1:04:53] he wanted me to stand in the pulpit say
[1:04:55] he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight
[1:04:58] then we are serving his eternal purpose
[1:05:01] and the one that left home only come to
[1:05:03] the earth to serve his purpose
[1:05:07] catch that the one that left home are
[1:05:09] you one that left home
[1:05:11] and come to the earth
[1:05:13] to do what to serve his purpose
[1:05:16] is that right all right then after it's
[1:05:17] finished it's brought back in a
[1:05:19] glorified state it's matured and brought
[1:05:22] back again
[1:05:23] amen
[1:05:24] my word that i send out will not return
[1:05:26] to me void but it'll accomplish that
[1:05:28] thing which i determined
[1:05:34] amen okay genesis 22 i'm going to take
[1:05:37] 15 more minutes
[1:05:40] genesis 22
[1:05:45] and verse 6 because i've been working
[1:05:47] all of this to get to this thought
[1:05:50] genesis 22 and 6
[1:05:53] and abraham took the wood of the burnt
[1:05:55] offering and laid it upon isaac as son
[1:05:57] and took the fire
[1:06:00] took the fire in his hand and the knife
[1:06:01] and they went both of them together and
[1:06:04] isaac spake unto abraham his father and
[1:06:05] said my father and he said here am i my
[1:06:08] son and he said behold the fire and the
[1:06:10] wood but where is the lamb for a burnt
[1:06:12] offering and abraham said my son god
[1:06:14] will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[1:06:17] offering so they went both of them
[1:06:19] together
[1:06:21] so
[1:06:22] brother branham has a unique way of of
[1:06:24] expressing this and possessing the gate
[1:06:26] of the enemy after the trial from 64. he
[1:06:28] says did you ever think where did that
[1:06:30] ram come from remember the country is
[1:06:33] full of lions and wolves and jackals and
[1:06:35] the sheep devouring beasts
[1:06:36] and far back from civilization was he
[1:06:38] and then up on top of a mountain where
[1:06:40] there's no water and had picked up the
[1:06:42] stones all around to make the altar
[1:06:44] where did that ram come from
[1:06:47] but it wasn't a vision he killed the ram
[1:06:49] it had blood what did he say god is able
[1:06:51] to provide for himself a sacrifice
[1:06:54] how are you going to come out of the
[1:06:56] chair how is the child going to
[1:06:58] get well are you from that chair are you
[1:07:01] from that heart trouble whatever is the
[1:07:03] matter god is able to provide for
[1:07:06] himself
[1:07:08] so i want to i want to to draw this
[1:07:10] drawing that we've been dealing with for
[1:07:12] so long here
[1:07:17] okay
[1:07:21] all right we've been drawing this
[1:07:23] drawing old and new testament talking
[1:07:25] about coming from adam all the way down
[1:07:29] through we have abraham
[1:07:32] we have
[1:07:33] joseph we have daniel
[1:07:36] we have
[1:07:37] all of these that are moving down this
[1:07:38] line we've got peter
[1:07:40] we've got paul
[1:07:43] we've got the seven church ages
[1:07:48] all right
[1:07:49] so moving down this line we know that
[1:07:52] that god
[1:07:54] in his thinking
[1:07:56] in the mind of god
[1:07:59] god already saw all of this
[1:08:02] is that right
[1:08:03] so the god's word now is an expression
[1:08:06] of his thought so this becomes
[1:08:11] the word line if i could say it that way
[1:08:15] or an expression of the thought of god
[1:08:17] in word then the word would taken
[1:08:19] manifestation and the manifestation
[1:08:21] would be the
[1:08:22] anointed word expressed in that day
[1:08:24] would become christ so that line in each
[1:08:27] period of time is christ for that day
[1:08:29] amen and we know that the word come down
[1:08:32] to accomplish a purpose but the word
[1:08:34] will return but the word will not return
[1:08:36] unto god void
[1:08:38] but it will accomplish the purpose that
[1:08:40] was set for so if we come down here to
[1:08:43] daniel
[1:08:44] when daniel
[1:08:46] is a young child amen and and jerusalem
[1:08:50] is now going to become captive to
[1:08:51] babylon he's taken as a young child over
[1:08:54] to babylon now for some that would be a
[1:08:57] disaster but for god there's no disaster
[1:09:00] because god already has a plan and
[1:09:02] nothing he said he called nebuchadnezzar
[1:09:04] his servant amen his servant that came
[1:09:07] in and executed judgment in the wrath of
[1:09:08] god his servant now that would take
[1:09:10] daniel back to a foreign land amen to
[1:09:13] become a student and become a wise man a
[1:09:15] counselor in his courts now daniel has
[1:09:18] to express something for god so the
[1:09:21] captivity he never died in the war he
[1:09:23] never died in the captivity amen in fact
[1:09:26] when he come to to a place where he had
[1:09:28] to face the word when they were going to
[1:09:30] give him a diet that was contrary to the
[1:09:32] dietary law that moses gave him he
[1:09:34] speaks to a man and says hey the man who
[1:09:37] was in charge of the children he says
[1:09:39] hey i can't eat this let us eat pulse
[1:09:41] only or vegetables only and the man says
[1:09:43] no the king's wrath he talks to him and
[1:09:45] who gives favor in the eyes of that man
[1:09:48] to these hebrew children
[1:09:51] it was god
[1:09:52] how did daniel pull that off it was god
[1:09:56] giving favor to that man it was god
[1:09:59] giving himself favor
[1:10:02] because daniel
[1:10:05] was one of these thoughts that had come
[1:10:07] down
[1:10:09] and daniel was an expression of a
[1:10:11] thought of god was the word of god made
[1:10:14] manifest daniel was christ for his day
[1:10:16] or christ was manifesting through the
[1:10:18] vessel of daniel in that day and so when
[1:10:21] god when god moved the keeper of the
[1:10:24] children to have favor amen god was
[1:10:27] moving the keeper of the children not to
[1:10:29] have favor on daniel but god was moving
[1:10:31] to keeper the children to have favor on
[1:10:33] god
[1:10:35] god was providing for himself
[1:10:41] now when when the when the when the
[1:10:44] corrupt wise men and counselors come up
[1:10:46] with a law amen to trap daniel amen that
[1:10:49] nobody can worship anybody but king
[1:10:51] darius for these what by whatever period
[1:10:53] of time that was amen they trap him in
[1:10:56] this trap and they're going to send him
[1:10:58] to the lions then and darius can't he
[1:11:00] can't redo the law the law is sealed
[1:11:02] he's got to go to the lion's den but yet
[1:11:04] daniel's not afraid because daniel has a
[1:11:06] revelation that he's in god's hand
[1:11:10] so when daniel goes down to the lion's
[1:11:12] den daniel does not stop the mouth of
[1:11:15] the lions
[1:11:18] god sends his angel and stops the mouth
[1:11:20] of the lions
[1:11:22] now listen to me very closely
[1:11:24] god did not stop the mouth of the lions
[1:11:26] for daniel so god stopped the mouth of
[1:11:29] the lions for god
[1:11:33] because god had something to express
[1:11:35] through daniel
[1:11:37] daniel's life within daniel's life
[1:11:40] contained amen something god had to
[1:11:43] express because daniel's life becomes
[1:11:45] part of our bible it's the word
[1:11:48] and the word is god
[1:11:51] and the word being expressed for daniel
[1:11:52] god has to preserve daniel because god's
[1:11:55] not preserving daniel god's preserving
[1:11:57] himself
[1:11:59] so god
[1:12:01] listen
[1:12:02] god is in the lion's den
[1:12:07] so god comes into the lion's den to
[1:12:09] protect god
[1:12:14] god will provide for himself when you
[1:12:17] come to abraham abraham was given the
[1:12:19] word of the lord the word of the lord
[1:12:20] said in isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:12:23] after god gave that word that's the
[1:12:26] eternal word of god amen so now god is
[1:12:29] going to keep his word but he tells
[1:12:31] abraham to go up and slay a son so
[1:12:33] abraham's so convinced by this part of
[1:12:35] his journey that god will keep his word
[1:12:37] that he goes forward believing that
[1:12:38] god's able to raise him up
[1:12:42] but as he's going along his son asking
[1:12:44] father we got the wood we got the fire
[1:12:46] we got all this where's the where's the
[1:12:47] lamb for a sacrifice he said god shall
[1:12:49] provide for himself a lamb
[1:12:53] because he knew god had to god had to do
[1:12:55] something because this word can't fail
[1:12:57] so god amen he had to preserve the life
[1:13:00] of isaac because of the word that was in
[1:13:02] isaac and that word had to be expressed
[1:13:05] through isaac because he already said
[1:13:06] and isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:13:10] so he's not protecting isaac he's
[1:13:12] protecting himself
[1:13:17] brother chad
[1:13:20] listen
[1:13:23] daniel in the lion's den
[1:13:30] saved but at some point in his journey
[1:13:34] he died
[1:13:39] at some point his journey his earthly
[1:13:41] life was going to expire he didn't die
[1:13:44] we no saints sleep
[1:13:46] but as somewhere in his earthly journey
[1:13:48] he was going to finish the purpose had
[1:13:50] for god had for that purpose that for
[1:13:53] that portion of the word
[1:13:55] and when that portion of the word's
[1:13:57] expression was complete daniel goes home
[1:14:01] until daniel finishes expressing that
[1:14:05] portion of the word
[1:14:06] god protects him in the in the war he
[1:14:08] protects him in the siege of jerusalem
[1:14:10] he protects him when he's taken captive
[1:14:12] he protects him when he's when he's uh
[1:14:14] being trained up as a wise man he gives
[1:14:15] him favor in the eyes of those who are
[1:14:17] watching over him he gives him favor in
[1:14:18] the eyes of each king that comes along
[1:14:20] now when they throw him into lines then
[1:14:22] he comes down and shuts the mouths of
[1:14:23] the lions then what was god doing god
[1:14:25] was protecting his word god was
[1:14:27] preserving himself
[1:14:31] god must provide for himself a sacrifice
[1:14:36] because i god couldn't take his word
[1:14:38] back and he couldn't let his word fail
[1:14:40] so in order for god to keep his word he
[1:14:42] had to provide for himself a lamb for
[1:14:45] the burnt offering so that his word
[1:14:46] wouldn't fail
[1:14:48] and if you're part of god's word when he
[1:14:50] was elohim all alone and he had this
[1:14:52] plan and you're serving a portion of
[1:14:54] that plan i'm telling you nothing will
[1:14:56] ever take your life until that
[1:14:58] expression of the word is finished
[1:15:00] [Applause]
[1:15:02] amen but it didn't mean amen life was
[1:15:05] always easy for abraham or life was
[1:15:07] always easy for daniel it didn't mean
[1:15:09] there was no struggle captivity wasn't
[1:15:11] easy being taken from your home wasn't
[1:15:13] was difficult i'm sure he wept over the
[1:15:15] loss of mother and father
[1:15:18] so it's like i said before it's not like
[1:15:20] god raised him in a bubble god had an
[1:15:22] expression he was going to express and
[1:15:24] part of that expression would tear the
[1:15:25] height off of daniel and part of that
[1:15:27] expression would protect him
[1:15:28] supernaturally
[1:15:31] but it was all about god expressing his
[1:15:33] word not really about daniel but it was
[1:15:36] about what was in daniel
[1:15:40] amen
[1:15:43] brother bram said god has provided a way
[1:15:45] he said but when moses threw his rod
[1:15:47] down
[1:15:48] these fellows standing there was super
[1:15:50] sensory perception threw their rods down
[1:15:52] done the same thing moses done only
[1:15:54] moses was following the line of god and
[1:15:56] what happened there's nothing the man
[1:15:58] could do he fulfilled his duty when
[1:16:00] you've done everything that you can do
[1:16:02] in the line of duty then it's god's
[1:16:03] business to provide a way
[1:16:06] god will provide for himself a sacrifice
[1:16:09] this is how brother branham uses this
[1:16:12] and moses threw his rod down and aaron
[1:16:14] threw his down and they turned into
[1:16:17] serpents and there come the supersensory
[1:16:19] perceptionist and throw down their rods
[1:16:21] and they turn and when moses could do
[1:16:22] nothing else then god provided a way
[1:16:25] their rods eat up the others what
[1:16:27] happened to the rods did the snake get
[1:16:29] bigger or what happened oh god still has
[1:16:31] a provided way and he's able to make a
[1:16:33] way when there is no other way he is the
[1:16:36] way.
[1:16:38] so when you catch the revelation listen
[1:16:41] when we when we start talking about back
[1:16:43] in the mind of elohim back in the
[1:16:45] attributes and thoughts of elohim the
[1:16:47] the mystery that had been sealed in god
[1:16:49] from before the foundation of the world
[1:16:51] this isn't to have a doctrine that's
[1:16:52] neat a concept that's interesting it is
[1:16:55] to actually bring a security that
[1:16:57] nothing else will bring in your life
[1:17:00] because if that's your revelation then
[1:17:02] it doesn't matter if it's lion's den
[1:17:05] it doesn't matter if it if they throw
[1:17:07] you in oil to burn you in oil which they
[1:17:10] tried to do the john the revelator they
[1:17:12] tried to burn him in a vat of oil and
[1:17:14] they could not burn him alive somehow no
[1:17:17] matter how much logs they put on the
[1:17:19] fire the fire could never get hot enough
[1:17:21] to boil him because god wasn't yet done
[1:17:23] with him
[1:17:25] so they would have to take him out of
[1:17:26] the oil and eventually they would ship
[1:17:29] him off amen to patmos island where he
[1:17:31] would receive the vision and the
[1:17:33] revelation and write the book of
[1:17:34] revelation and after he wrote the book
[1:17:36] of revelation then god would allow him
[1:17:38] to die
[1:17:41] john couldn't be burned with oil peter
[1:17:43] could be hung upside down
[1:17:47] why would god protect one and not the
[1:17:48] other it has everything to do with god's
[1:17:51] purpose the purpose of his word
[1:17:55] now
[1:18:01] okay
[1:18:07] let's keep going
[1:18:14] god's word
[1:18:15] would come down and begin to express
[1:18:17] through generations
[1:18:19] but that word that would start in adam
[1:18:22] would now fall
[1:18:23] in adam and come in a fallen condition
[1:18:25] now these attributes of the express are
[1:18:28] going to be expressed in a fallen state
[1:18:30] and fallen flesh
[1:18:33] and those attributes that were going to
[1:18:35] be in a fallen flesh they were going to
[1:18:37] be separated from god so those
[1:18:39] attributes in fallen flesh amen now
[1:18:42] separated from god
[1:18:44] god could not let himself be separated
[1:18:46] from himself eternally
[1:18:51] so let's go back to genesis 22. and
[1:18:54] let's read this scripture again
[1:18:57] verse 8 and abraham said my son god will
[1:19:00] provide
[1:19:01] himself a lamb
[1:19:06] when god
[1:19:07] was coming down through this line
[1:19:10] coming through adam coming through
[1:19:11] abraham coming through moses coming
[1:19:13] through noah coming through daniel
[1:19:15] coming through david coming through
[1:19:16] solomon coming coming coming he was
[1:19:18] coming but that attribute amen could not
[1:19:21] return back to him because of the fallen
[1:19:24] condition
[1:19:25] so god
[1:19:28] would become
[1:19:30] the sacrifice
[1:19:33] so god
[1:19:34] would provide
[1:19:37] himself
[1:19:40] a sacrifice
[1:19:42] meaning god would become the sacrifice
[1:19:47] god would provide himself a sacrifice
[1:19:51] amen then when jesus was born he was
[1:19:53] elohim god with us the created body of
[1:19:56] god the lamb the sacrificial lamb the
[1:19:58] son of god and god became god provided
[1:20:02] himself a sacrifice
[1:20:04] but who was he providing himself a
[1:20:06] sacrifice for he was providing himself a
[1:20:09] sacrifice for himself
[1:20:12] because
[1:20:13] this is himself
[1:20:16] and this
[1:20:17] is himself
[1:20:20] and he couldn't let his attributes his
[1:20:22] words stay in a separated fallen
[1:20:24] situation so he would provide himself a
[1:20:27] sacrifice for himself
[1:20:31] oh praise god amen this is the lamb's
[1:20:34] book of life amen the lamb amen slain
[1:20:37] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:39] because god had to display himself he
[1:20:42] wanted to express himself so in order to
[1:20:44] express himself he had to allow sin to
[1:20:46] erupt in heaven he had to allow it to
[1:20:48] spill down to earth so that he could
[1:20:50] come as redeemer healer amen deliver all
[1:20:53] these other things but he was not going
[1:20:55] to entrust this to other beings amen he
[1:20:58] had such an expression it had to be
[1:21:00] himself expressed in each age so it was
[1:21:03] portion of himself a portion of himself
[1:21:05] and a portion of himself but god cannot
[1:21:08] lose himself
[1:21:11] so in god's great plan he already
[1:21:14] provided himself a sacrifice
[1:21:17] he was the lamb slain before the
[1:21:19] foundation of the world
[1:21:24] brother bam said in the smyrnan church
[1:21:25] aid
[1:21:26] that is what happened for our redemption
[1:21:28] the holy ghost came upon mary and she
[1:21:30] bore a son and called him jesus the
[1:21:32] great creator came down and became a
[1:21:34] sacrifice for our sin
[1:21:38] his blood was the blood of god
[1:21:41] brother bram goes on to say god is his
[1:21:43] own interpreter and now remember you
[1:21:45] christians were in his thoughts before
[1:21:47] there was a world and you are the
[1:21:49] manifested manifestation of his thinking
[1:21:51] before there even was a world you were
[1:21:53] in christ in god in the beginning that
[1:21:56] makes you then you see his subjects and
[1:21:58] the whole thing is god himself
[1:22:00] materializing himself tangible so he
[1:22:03] could be handled seen and so forth and
[1:22:06] that's what god is the whole thing
[1:22:10] that's what god is the whole thing
[1:22:14] that's what god is the whole thing
[1:22:17] what is it god materializing himself
[1:22:20] tangible so that he could be touched
[1:22:23] and felt
[1:22:26] in the message i know
[1:22:30] i'm sorry in questions and answers in 64
[1:22:33] he says and then god became material in
[1:22:35] a man called jesus christ which was his
[1:22:36] son this son gave his life that he might
[1:22:39] bring other sons that god might become
[1:22:42] tangible working
[1:22:44] in all
[1:22:45] in all
[1:22:47] and the message i know he says satan
[1:22:50] could not take them he could not drown
[1:22:53] no in the flood until the purpose of god
[1:22:55] had been finished
[1:22:57] he could not burn up the hebrew children
[1:22:59] until the purpose of god had been
[1:23:00] finished
[1:23:01] listen on the timeline here with daniel
[1:23:04] amen we can come down here and we can
[1:23:06] drop the three men
[1:23:08] right
[1:23:10] and the fiery furnace god will come down
[1:23:13] himself
[1:23:15] himself god will be amen as the son of
[1:23:17] god the fourth man in the fire to shield
[1:23:19] them from the flames to protect them but
[1:23:21] all three of them men would eventually
[1:23:22] die
[1:23:24] but they wouldn't die until after they
[1:23:26] finished the portion of the word that
[1:23:27] was allotted for them to express
[1:23:31] he said
[1:23:32] he could not kill job with boils and
[1:23:34] troubles until the purpose of god had
[1:23:36] been finished neither could the lions
[1:23:38] eat daniel until god's purpose had been
[1:23:39] finished neither could death and old age
[1:23:41] take abraham until the purpose of god
[1:23:43] had been finished and neither can it
[1:23:45] take you or can it take me until the
[1:23:47] purpose of god of our life is finished
[1:23:50] so we gather from there consolation
[1:23:54] praise god
[1:23:56] romans 8 28 we know it by heart
[1:23:58] and we know that all things work
[1:24:00] together for good to them that love god
[1:24:02] to them who are the called
[1:24:04] according
[1:24:06] to his purpose
[1:24:09] we come down here
[1:24:12] to this line
[1:24:16] right we have you and me
[1:24:21] before the foundation of the world
[1:24:23] before there was a speck of stardust god
[1:24:25] had something for you to do and he had
[1:24:26] something for me to do
[1:24:31] in in order to make sure it happened
[1:24:34] he allocated a portion of himself to
[1:24:36] come into this dispensation and to this
[1:24:39] vessel and for that portion of himself
[1:24:41] to express
[1:24:45] it's secure because it's him
[1:24:51] now
[1:24:54] we call ourselves believers
[1:24:58] but
[1:24:59] who is the believer
[1:25:03] the believer is him in us
[1:25:05] the seed gene of god that's the believer
[1:25:07] the believer is not my intellect the
[1:25:09] believers not my emotions my reasoning
[1:25:11] believers not my outer man amen the real
[1:25:14] believer amen is the seed of god inside
[1:25:16] so he is believing himself
[1:25:21] but because he would portion this out
[1:25:24] this portion of himself this attribute
[1:25:26] this thought this piece of the word this
[1:25:28] portion of god he would attribute it out
[1:25:31] for this dispensation to displayed in
[1:25:33] this fallen vessel in this period of
[1:25:36] time to express a certain portion of
[1:25:38] himself because he attributed that out
[1:25:41] amen he would now give this portion of
[1:25:43] himself an expression and that
[1:25:46] expression he would call son and he
[1:25:48] would allow to have an identity and that
[1:25:50] identity becomes me
[1:25:53] but the me is really him
[1:25:56] the true me is really a portion of him
[1:26:00] and now it's he believing himself
[1:26:04] so now when god comes and god brings a
[1:26:07] deliverance to us god is delivering
[1:26:09] himself
[1:26:11] now listen when david was anointed to be
[1:26:14] king over israel amen god sent solomon
[1:26:17] down amen solomon comes with the word of
[1:26:19] the lord to pour the anointing all over
[1:26:21] david david is now the anointed king is
[1:26:24] that true
[1:26:25] david is the anointed king of israel
[1:26:27] there's now an anointing on his life
[1:26:29] he's going to become king of israel and
[1:26:31] all that god had already predetermined
[1:26:33] for him to do he will do now the lion
[1:26:35] can't kill him the bear can't kill him
[1:26:38] goliath can't kill him saul can't kill
[1:26:40] him
[1:26:42] he's under a supernatural protection not
[1:26:45] because he has pretty blue eyes not
[1:26:47] because he's ready not because he's nice
[1:26:49] not because he sings well but because
[1:26:51] there's a portion of god in him that has
[1:26:54] to have a certain expression and until
[1:26:56] that expression is finished there is a
[1:26:58] seal of protection around him that will
[1:27:00] ensure that that is completed
[1:27:04] so david becomes invincible under the
[1:27:06] anointing because of what god thought
[1:27:09] before the foundation of the world makes
[1:27:11] him invincible
[1:27:14] amen
[1:27:16] now listen this same daniel who was
[1:27:18] invincible to the lion and to the bear
[1:27:21] and to goliath and to saul
[1:27:24] this same man is the one who's running
[1:27:26] for his life from cave to cave hiding
[1:27:28] from saul and weeping and crying and
[1:27:31] making up songs about how horrible his
[1:27:33] life is
[1:27:36] is that true
[1:27:37] you ever read the psalms
[1:27:41] see
[1:27:42] david doesn't even understand the old
[1:27:44] mystery in his life
[1:27:48] he he knows his enemies are out to get
[1:27:50] him they would kill him if they had the
[1:27:52] chance his life is in jeopardy but his
[1:27:54] life is not in jeopardy but to him his
[1:27:56] life is in jeopardy but to god his life
[1:27:58] is not in jeopardy
[1:28:01] to him he's being chased and it's
[1:28:03] horrible amen and my life is rough to
[1:28:05] god it's not rough it's perfect
[1:28:10] and see
[1:28:11] david is being saved and he's being
[1:28:13] saved and he's being saved but in the
[1:28:15] midst of god supernaturally delivering
[1:28:18] him from goliath and from the lion and
[1:28:20] from the bear amen he's not delivering
[1:28:23] him from saul chasing him from cave to
[1:28:25] cave in his weeping and his crying and
[1:28:27] his songs because those psalms will be
[1:28:29] varied the very psalms amen that show
[1:28:31] christ suffering and christ's rejection
[1:28:35] so he's manifesting the word and
[1:28:38] manifesting the word amen and some i
[1:28:41] don't know that david knew which part
[1:28:43] was a manifestation of the word and
[1:28:44] which part was it
[1:28:48] but he was under god was providing for
[1:28:51] himself when he was protecting daniel
[1:28:55] when god
[1:28:56] took that rock out of that sling and he
[1:28:58] guided it like a laser-guided missile
[1:29:00] and smacked goliath right between the
[1:29:03] eyes god was protecting god
[1:29:09] when david amen took that lion by the
[1:29:13] beard
[1:29:14] i don't know if you've ever seen the
[1:29:16] lion face to face
[1:29:18] i have once
[1:29:20] we were in mahala holla with brian jones
[1:29:22] down in south africa brother getting
[1:29:23] retrieved took me there and there was a
[1:29:25] fence there that had a big male african
[1:29:26] lion i was on this side of the fence the
[1:29:28] lion was on that side of the fence and
[1:29:29] if there hadn't been a fence there i
[1:29:31] would have passed out and died
[1:29:35] the mane on that line was like this big
[1:29:38] the top of his mane was right here he's
[1:29:40] got a muzzle like this right in your
[1:29:41] face he could bite your whole head in
[1:29:44] his mouth
[1:29:45] when you see him in pictures you know
[1:29:46] they're walking around the safari
[1:29:47] walking around and they look like yeah
[1:29:49] that's a big cat but when you're looking
[1:29:51] at it it's eyeballs are that big staring
[1:29:52] at you teeth are that long it's
[1:29:55] humongous
[1:29:58] david took one of those by the beard and
[1:30:00] smote it and killed it
[1:30:05] did david grab it by the beard or did
[1:30:07] god grab it by the beard
[1:30:13] have you ever seen a bear
[1:30:16] i've never been that close to one
[1:30:20] did david kill the bear or did god kill
[1:30:22] the bear
[1:30:25] see
[1:30:29] we've got to go back
[1:30:33] to the mystery
[1:30:35] that was in the back part of god's mind
[1:30:37] and find ourself there
[1:30:40] if we can find ourselves there
[1:30:44] then what do i have to be afraid of
[1:30:48] if i was there
[1:30:51] if that that sea gene of god that's in
[1:30:53] me now was there
[1:30:55] then this is god here
[1:30:59] and another form and another vessel
[1:31:01] expressing himself and god will provide
[1:31:05] for himself
[1:31:07] if you have a need for your life to be
[1:31:09] sustained if you have a need for
[1:31:11] protection for god to keep expressing
[1:31:12] his word god will protect you for the
[1:31:15] expression of his thought
[1:31:18] but
[1:31:19] if we have need of humiliation
[1:31:23] for him to express his word we'll be
[1:31:24] humbled
[1:31:26] if we need to be afflicted so that we
[1:31:28] can express the portion of the word
[1:31:29] we'll be afflicted it's all about
[1:31:31] expressing the word
[1:31:33] amen this is why we get so confused in
[1:31:36] our christian journey sometimes but if
[1:31:38] we could go back to david david was
[1:31:40] victorious the day he threw the rock and
[1:31:42] killed goliath he was weeping in a cave
[1:31:44] shortly after that amen mourning over
[1:31:47] the the direction of his life and
[1:31:49] worried about whether his enemies were
[1:31:51] going to slay him or not
[1:31:53] and he was still manifesting god he was
[1:31:56] still under the care of god he was still
[1:31:59] the word expressing in that day in the
[1:32:01] cave and on the battlefield
[1:32:04] but we getting expressing in our lives
[1:32:07] like like david god will do something
[1:32:09] absolutely supernatural and deliver us
[1:32:11] from sickness work circumstances out for
[1:32:13] our job do so do things that we couldn't
[1:32:16] do work them out supernaturally and then
[1:32:18] the next week we find ourselves with a
[1:32:20] bad head cold and we're wondering
[1:32:21] whether we're a child of god or not or
[1:32:22] have any faith
[1:32:26] we're in the cave strumming strumming
[1:32:28] the the harp saying oh what was me if
[1:32:32] god would only have
[1:32:34] show me his favor if god would still see
[1:32:36] me
[1:32:40] and he proved he saw you the week before
[1:32:43] he proved he knew where you were he
[1:32:45] proved he heard the conversation in your
[1:32:47] car right before you came to church he
[1:32:49] proved that he knew the need that you
[1:32:50] had and provided before you asked amen
[1:32:52] and now when you find yourself in a
[1:32:54] difficult situation maybe there's
[1:32:56] another part of the word that has to be
[1:32:57] expressed amen but we begin to strum on
[1:33:00] the heart and say oh if god would just
[1:33:01] look down on me if god just knew my
[1:33:03] sorrow if god
[1:33:07] i say god take me back to before the
[1:33:09] foundation of the world to the mystery
[1:33:11] that was locked inside of you that
[1:33:12] you've opened in this day that i know
[1:33:14] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:33:16] ordered of the lord
[1:33:19] i know that you're with us and i know
[1:33:21] you're expressing yourself god just
[1:33:23] helped me to surrender more and give you
[1:33:25] first place and surrender to you in
[1:33:27] everything in my life
[1:33:31] this is why
[1:33:34] you know
[1:33:36] we can be
[1:33:40] we can preach in such a way
[1:33:43] that if you ever struggle to have a
[1:33:44] problem you're not a believer
[1:33:48] we can preach in such a way that the
[1:33:50] bride
[1:33:51] has got overcoming power she's got the
[1:33:54] word
[1:33:55] which is all true
[1:33:57] it's true but what is overcoming power
[1:34:00] for
[1:34:02] what is the word for
[1:34:04] it's for god to express himself
[1:34:08] we can preach a way in such a way that
[1:34:10] we begin to believe every trial
[1:34:14] causes us to doubt our sonship
[1:34:18] but i don't want to do that
[1:34:20] i want to eat the book and become one
[1:34:22] with the book and realize
[1:34:26] that
[1:34:26] god
[1:34:29] could protect
[1:34:31] a governor could deliver him from a mob
[1:34:34] and the next city he could be stoned and
[1:34:35] left for dead but he'd raise him up
[1:34:39] then he would get shipwrecked but god
[1:34:41] would deliver him on the shipwreck
[1:34:42] island he'd be bitten by a snake
[1:34:44] but he'd shake it off
[1:34:47] but just a short time after that he'd be
[1:34:49] beheaded for the gospel sake
[1:34:53] when was god with him and when wasn't
[1:34:54] god with him
[1:34:57] i say god
[1:34:59] give us revelation
[1:35:01] give us security give us an
[1:35:03] understanding of who we are in you and
[1:35:06] what it is you're trying to accomplish
[1:35:07] in the day and let us have faith that no
[1:35:09] matter what the circumstances it'll
[1:35:11] never hinder your word every sickness
[1:35:13] you'll overcome it amen every trial
[1:35:15] you'll defeat it how you'll do it is up
[1:35:17] to you i'm just here to express whatever
[1:35:20] you want expressed in this day i want
[1:35:22] you to have preeminence over me
[1:35:24] i'm not going to question you i'm not
[1:35:25] going to question what you do i'm not
[1:35:27] going to question who i am but i'm going
[1:35:29] to watch for you to do something
[1:35:30] wonderful in every circumstance
[1:35:32] i'm going to watch for you to deliver
[1:35:34] i'm going to watch for you to manifest
[1:35:36] i'm going to watch for you to heal i'm
[1:35:37] going to watch for you to speak
[1:35:39] when i get in a situation amen and and i
[1:35:42] get into a trouble i get into a problem
[1:35:44] you put me in contact with people that
[1:35:46] i've never been in contact before i'm
[1:35:47] watching for you to say something
[1:35:50] to open a door to speak something just
[1:35:52] i'm always watching for you amen to
[1:35:54] manifest yourself in my life because
[1:35:57] nothing is without a purpose amen
[1:36:01] but i want to have that revelation
[1:36:05] of the mystery that was in the back
[1:36:08] back part of god's mind
[1:36:10] i want to eat the book and become one
[1:36:12] with the book
[1:36:13] until all of a sudden life begins to
[1:36:16] make sense
[1:36:19] that i'm not a christian here and not a
[1:36:22] christian here i'm not a good believer
[1:36:23] here and a bad believer here
[1:36:25] but i'm just
[1:36:27] a child of god
[1:36:29] here to express
[1:36:31] something of god's life in this earth
[1:36:35] and god will express it in highs and
[1:36:37] lows and good and then bad
[1:36:40] but i'm here to express something
[1:36:42] and nothing

[1:37:44] and in every circumstance we come
[1:37:46] ourselves we come into let us just take
[1:37:49] the same confession abraham had
[1:37:52] god will provide himself a sacrifice
[1:37:55] how will you get over this god will
[1:37:56] provide for himself how will you figure
[1:37:57] that out god will provide for himself
[1:37:59] how will you overcome this god will
[1:38:00] provide for himself
[1:38:02] i don't know how i don't know where
[1:38:04] abraham didn't know there was going to
[1:38:05] be a ram in the thicket when he said
[1:38:06] that but he knew god would provide for
[1:38:08] the word
[1:38:09] and every situation we find ourselves in
[1:38:11] in every trial and everything that goes
[1:38:12] on amen i wish i wish that i could
[1:38:15] always have that as my first response
[1:38:17] but i'm praying that god will will help
[1:38:19] me change my ways to where no matter
[1:38:21] what happens i can say god will provide
[1:38:23] for himself
[1:38:24] i'm not here because i chose to come
[1:38:26] here amen
[1:38:28] and the conscience i have now and the
[1:38:29] thing i am now i'm not here i'm here by
[1:38:31] god's thought i'm geared by god's
[1:38:33] purpose
[1:38:35] i was placed in this body by god's
[1:38:36] choice i was placed in this time by
[1:38:38] god's choice i was placed in this
[1:38:39] geography by god's choice
[1:38:42] and i'm here to serve his purpose
[1:38:44] and god will provide for himself
[1:38:47] i believe that friends i want to believe
[1:38:49] it more

[1:39:16] but god i pray that you keep lifting us
[1:39:18] to that back part of your mind and
[1:39:19] refreshing our memory lord
[1:39:22] that you would break the spiritual
[1:39:23] amnesia and we would realize what we
[1:39:25] realized when we shouted for joy
[1:39:28] when we saw the plan of redemption back
[1:39:30] there
[1:39:31] and we shouted for joy god would you
[1:39:34] break our amnesia so that we can have
[1:39:36] that same joy in the midst of our
[1:39:38] circumstances now

[1:39:58] word
[1:40:00] he didn't know how you would provide but
[1:40:01] he knew you would provide
[1:40:03] he knew you wouldn't let that word fail
[1:40:06] god we're in situations we don't know
[1:40:08] how you'll provide
[1:40:10] but you promised that by your stripes
[1:40:12] we are healed

[1:40:16] circumstances we don't know how these
[1:40:18] troubles will pass we don't know how the
[1:40:20] healing will come but we know one thing
[1:40:22] that your word won't fail and you've
[1:40:24] made a promise and you'll keep that
[1:40:25] promise

[1:40:29] us to have actions of faith help us to
[1:40:31] live a life of faith like abraham so
[1:40:33] that we can say god will provide
