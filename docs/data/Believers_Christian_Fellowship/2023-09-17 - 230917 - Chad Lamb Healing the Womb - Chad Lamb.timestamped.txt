[15:37] cias so everybody's going everywhere
[15:40] amen and that's fine as long as
[15:42] everybody gets back for camp for a
[15:43] retreat so we can all be together for
[15:45] the family Retreat amen so just be
[15:48] praying for these brothers that God
[15:50] would bless them and use them
[15:52] mly amen let's look at Genesis
[15:56] 3 verse 13
[16:05] and the Lord God said unto the woman
[16:07] what is this that thou has done and the
[16:09] woman said the serpent begal me and I
[16:12] did eat verse
[16:14] 16 unto the woman he said I will greatly
[16:17] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[16:19] and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[16:21] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[16:24] husband and he shall rule over thee
[16:28] let's look at verse
[16:30] 20 and Adam called his wife's name Eve
[16:34] because she was the mother of all living
[16:37] amen God bless you as you take your
[16:38] seats and we begin to look at these
[16:41] scriptures amen we just want to welcome
[16:43] all our visitors amen God bless you it's
[16:46] good to have you with us God bless you
[16:49] Sister Faith it's good to see you again
[16:51] amen God has been good amen now as we
[16:55] look at this um these scriptures it's
[16:58] all related to one event and this event
[17:00] is the fall we know that the fall came
[17:03] because Eve left the protection of the
[17:05] word she was seduced and beguiled by the
[17:08] serpent amen he brought to her reasoning
[17:11] and she reasoned in her mind and brother
[17:13] Benham said before she ever fell in her
[17:15] body she fell in her mind amen she took
[17:18] the reasoning of The Serpent and and she
[17:20] took his comments contradictory to the
[17:23] word and it sounded reasonable and it
[17:25] began she began to be seduced into such
[17:28] a way that she thought she was doing
[17:29] something good when she was in fact
[17:31] doing something evil she was beguiled
[17:33] she was seduced she was deceived and and
[17:37] so in doing that she allowed something
[17:39] other than the word amen into her mind
[17:41] and she considered something other than
[17:43] the word and and it began to bring a
[17:45] corruption in her thinking and then she
[17:47] moved into the Act and the ACT brought a
[17:49] corruption into her body amen and then
[17:51] it brought a corruption upon the Earth
[17:54] because now amen there was going to be
[17:56] children born because of this sin
[17:58] because of this fall cuz we know that it
[18:00] was adultery and then then behind the
[18:03] adultery there was there was sex by Will
[18:06] and and now all of this is going to
[18:08] begin to unfold the situation we're in
[18:11] now and it all started back here and so
[18:15] all of all the scriptures we read are
[18:17] all related to the same thing that the
[18:18] woman was deceived by the serpent but
[18:20] then she was cursed but the curse had to
[18:22] do with bearing
[18:24] children amen the great I will greatly
[18:27] multiply thy sorrow and th conception so
[18:30] now the now now the the fall amen her
[18:33] sin brought upon this condition and then
[18:36] when we go to verse 20 and Adam called
[18:38] his wife's name Eve because she was the
[18:41] mother of all living amen this is seems
[18:45] like a good thing but it's not a good
[18:46] thing before she didn't need an
[18:49] identification she didn't need a name
[18:51] because her identity was in Adam amen
[18:54] her name was Adam when God created him
[18:56] he made them male and female he created
[18:57] he them and called their name Adam this
[19:00] is in Genesis chter 5 so she already had
[19:02] an identification she already had an
[19:04] identity but the fall brought her a
[19:07] separate identification and that
[19:09] identification is a result of adultery
[19:11] is a result of the Fall result of
[19:13] reasoning a result of leaving the
[19:16] word amen so then we we we find a state
[19:20] where now amen God wanted to accomplish
[19:24] something upon the Earth and we're going
[19:25] to look at this and God wanted to do
[19:27] something on the earth and and now this
[19:30] plan is going to now fall into ruin and
[19:33] move into a Plan of Redemption which we
[19:35] know also serves God's purpose amen but
[19:38] but now Eve was supposed to bring forth
[19:41] a a child but now that her wound was
[19:44] tainted by the Fall she's not able to
[19:46] bring it forth in the way that was
[19:48] originally
[19:49] intended okay so now let's jump back to
[19:52] verse 15 this is the the Lord speaking
[19:55] to the serpent said I will put in it
[19:58] between thee and the woman and between
[20:00] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[20:03] thy head and thou shall bruise his heel
[20:06] now the curse comes to the serpent that
[20:09] he now changes his whole physical
[20:12] structure no longer will he be able to
[20:14] mingle seed with human anymore now he's
[20:17] brought to crawl on his belly the legs
[20:19] come off of him no more ability to
[20:21] communicate with a human being now he is
[20:24] put to the ground and then he then now
[20:26] verse 15 is not is not just the curse
[20:31] now verse 15 becomes a prophecy amen yes
[20:35] I will put enity between thee and the
[20:37] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[20:40] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[20:42] bruise his heel this is the prophecy of
[20:44] the coming Christ the seed the seed of
[20:47] the woman amen but we know that that Eve
[20:51] that woman canot produce that seed
[20:54] because the womb has been corrupted she
[20:57] hybrid her seed brother Venom
[20:59] says so now I I want to look at the
[21:03] quote in Satan's
[21:05] Eden says and so God knew that we would
[21:08] be here but then he put us in flesh so
[21:11] we would be contacted in order he would
[21:13] contact he became one of us when he
[21:15] became Jesus Christ the son of God
[21:17] himself the fullness of the
[21:18] manifestation of God therefore that was
[21:21] God's purpose to display his attributes
[21:23] in Fellowship when I was in my father I
[21:26] knew nothing about it but when I became
[21:28] his son I was born of him I was an
[21:30] attribute of part of my father and
[21:32] you're a part of your father and as
[21:34] children of God we are part of God's
[21:36] attribute that was in him made flesh
[21:39] like he was made flesh so we can have
[21:41] Fellowship one with the other as a
[21:43] family of God upon the Earth and that
[21:46] was God's purpose at the beginning amen
[21:49] yes sir that's what God wanted at the
[21:51] beginning so from the very beginning
[21:53] what God wanted was his attributes to
[21:56] come forth and be expressed upon the
[21:58] Earth to have Fellowship as a family
[22:00] upon the Earth amen that's what God
[22:02] wanted amen and and and before it could
[22:06] come forth in Perfection amen there was
[22:08] a corruption that set in through Eve
[22:11] receiving the wrong seed bringing a
[22:13] hybridization and bringing corruption
[22:15] and now that way was corrupted so now
[22:18] God comes through the way of redemption
[22:20] and he's going to accomplish the same
[22:22] purpose amen only in doing it he's also
[22:25] going to express himself the rest of the
[22:26] attributes that can only be expressed
[22:28] this way amen but the original the
[22:30] original intention was to to bring his
[22:33] attributes into flesh to have Fellowship
[22:36] as a family of God upon the Earth amen
[22:39] praise the Lord continue on in the same
[22:42] quote he had everything under control
[22:44] when he turned man over in the Garden of
[22:46] Eden on free moral agency he said son
[22:48] it's yours what a beautiful place God
[22:51] Was So Satisfied till he just went back
[22:54] and rested from all his works every tree
[22:56] never brought forth thorn thns and
[22:58] thistles no berries ever came off a
[23:00] Thorn Tree everything was perfect all
[23:02] seeds were perfect everything was in
[23:04] perfect condition then when he went to
[23:07] take a little rest his enemy slipped in
[23:10] with deceit and took it over by
[23:12] misinterpreting his program to his
[23:15] children amen that deception was so
[23:19] deadly by misinterpreting God's program
[23:22] to his children by bringing a deception
[23:25] by reasoning by reasoning on the word
[23:27] and missing interpreting God's program
[23:29] brought the ruination amen the collapse
[23:32] of Eden amen the the casting out of the
[23:35] Garden of Eden and the the fall of Man
[23:38] and the corruption in our bodies and
[23:39] death and the cycle of Destruction and
[23:41] everything that we see came because he
[23:45] misinterpreted God's program to his
[23:47] children and he was deceived by
[23:50] that so in relating to the God's purpose
[23:54] his initial purpose in the pergan church
[23:57] age from the church age book The Prophet
[23:59] says the first son Adam was the spoken
[24:01] seed word of God he was given a bride to
[24:04] reproduce himself that is why the bride
[24:07] was given to him to reproduce himself to
[24:09] produce another Son of God but she fell
[24:12] she fell by hybridization she caused him
[24:14] to die so what was why was uh Adam given
[24:19] a bride he was given a bride to
[24:21] reproduce himself upon the earth when we
[24:24] want to understand God Amen we
[24:27] understand God by his original intent by
[24:29] his original work amen because what God
[24:31] did in his original work in creation
[24:34] what we see in Genesis the first two
[24:37] three chapters in Genesis what we see
[24:39] God doing is God fores showing what he
[24:42] intends to do
[24:44] amen and then then there was a fall in a
[24:47] cycle of redemption but the cycle of
[24:49] redemption is a cycle it's a circle it
[24:52] brings us right back to this
[24:55] intention so you see by the end of of it
[24:58] we come back to where we started so the
[25:00] beginning declared the end because God
[25:03] knew the end from the beginning he is
[25:06] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[25:08] end so the the whole cycle of redemption
[25:10] was to come back to this this is the
[25:12] picture this is what he wants if we want
[25:14] to understand God we understand God by
[25:17] what he does by what he displays by how
[25:19] he shows
[25:20] himself and then everything he's doing
[25:22] is to come back to
[25:24] this praise
[25:26] God
[25:28] and spoken word is the Original Seed and
[25:30] I'm going to be quoting quite a bit out
[25:32] of that message says all of God's son
[25:35] must be the same yes sir to be born of
[25:37] the word of and spirit brings us back to
[25:40] the spoken word
[25:41] again like in John 3 see to be born of
[25:44] the water and the spirit what does it do
[25:47] then it brings you right back again into
[25:49] the place of where you should have been
[25:51] at the
[25:52] beginning we come into this Earth
[25:54] brother B said you were born wrong yes
[25:57] right you're not you're ought to be
[25:59] condition you're now come in a fallen
[26:01] condition this body the ought to be
[26:03] condition wasn't a fallen human body it
[26:06] was a human body not a hybrid human body
[26:10] amen not one with with animalistic
[26:12] nature mixed into it with by
[26:14] hybridization by deception we were we
[26:17] were to come to flesh but not this
[26:20] way
[26:21] yes so now God has to do something to
[26:25] bring us back amen because he can't just
[26:27] leave us like this because God's purpose
[26:29] can't be defeated amen when God made his
[26:32] original Masterpiece and it fell by ruin
[26:35] and it was laying there brother bam said
[26:36] laying there in the dirt he went to work
[26:38] immediately to rebuild his Masterpiece
[26:40] because God's not going to be defeated
[26:42] in his
[26:44] purpose see this is what is so beautiful
[26:47] about the message is is when when when
[26:50] we think about the opening of the seals
[26:53] amen the the sounding of the trumpets
[26:55] it's it's these it's this mystery this
[26:58] this mysterious Thunders that give the
[27:00] bride Faith amen why because it takes
[27:03] the seals off the book and what it does
[27:05] is it unbinds the entire
[27:10] Bible amen and when he unbinds the
[27:13] entire Bible we begin to see God's whole
[27:15] purpose and God's whole plan but more
[27:18] importantly than just seeing God's
[27:19] purpose and God's plan he begins to
[27:21] reveal to us his purpose in US according
[27:25] to his
[27:26] plan
[27:28] that's what begins to build such
[27:30] personal
[27:32] faith
[27:34] amen so now God has got the way to to
[27:38] bring it
[27:39] back he said so
[27:41] when when you're born of the word and
[27:45] spirit not natural birth but spiritual
[27:48] birth when you're born of the word and
[27:50] spirit brings us back to the spoken word
[27:53] again amen like in John 3 to be born of
[27:55] the water and the spirit what does it do
[27:57] then it brings you right back again to
[27:58] the place of where you should have been
[28:00] at the
[28:03] beginning that's the reason of Christ
[28:05] death brings us right back again to
[28:07] where sons of God if Eve would have
[28:10] brought forth that child she would have
[28:12] finally done it did not God tell her
[28:14] multiply and replenish the Earth but she
[28:16] had to walk over here and play the part
[28:19] of a
[28:19] amen that's strong language but
[28:22] that's Bible language it's not just
[28:25] brother bram's language that's Bible
[28:26] language when she do she she she mixed
[28:29] her seed she hybridized herself amen and
[28:31] she couldn't bring forth that child
[28:34] anymore she couldn't bring forth that
[28:35] son she could no longer help Adam
[28:38] reproduce himself upon the Earth because
[28:41] now it wouldn't come
[28:42] right so as I'm preaching this uh I'm
[28:46] actually backing up and grabbing a a
[28:49] thought that I preached in U Poland and
[28:52] I know several of you went and watched
[28:53] those because I tried to forbid you and
[28:56] you did it anyways
[28:59] but but it's been on my heart to share
[29:01] it here at home too because God opened
[29:04] up just a little nugget I mean it's not
[29:06] like a uh anything brand new but God
[29:08] just opened up a little nugget for me I
[29:10] mean when I was over there ministering
[29:11] in Poland and it blessed me so much and
[29:13] I want to share that with you but but
[29:15] every time we look at it it expands amen
[29:17] even from then it's expanded in my heart
[29:19] and and these are things we're familiar
[29:21] with but they just keep expanding amen
[29:23] they're becoming more of a reality it's
[29:25] it we saw the picture but the picture's
[29:27] coming in Greater Clarity greater Focus
[29:29] amen it's amazing that we've had
[29:32] television around for how long we've had
[29:33] television around I don't know maybe 70
[29:36] 80 years we've had television around
[29:38] amen but the first television compared
[29:41] to the HD 5K 6K screen you have now it's
[29:45] a drastic difference amen and we've been
[29:47] looking at the same message for a long
[29:49] time but I'm telling you by the grace of
[29:51] God and Revelation the clarity is coming
[29:54] amen the color is becoming more Vivid
[29:57] it's moving from black and white grainy
[29:59] now there's some color but the color is
[30:01] not exactly like the color we see
[30:03] naturally it's kind of but then it
[30:05] becomes more real and more real and more
[30:07] real until they're going to have screens
[30:09] pretty soon that people are just going
[30:10] to walk right into thinking it's the
[30:12] reality amen they'll bump into it it'll
[30:14] be a picture of a window or a door and
[30:16] somebody's going to smash their face
[30:19] it's becoming so
[30:20] clear this message is becoming so clear
[30:24] amen
[30:25] amen oh I thank God for
[30:28] that so when I was in Romania I preached
[30:31] the message on healing the womb and
[30:33] that's what I want to talk about now
[30:35] because we find that Eve corrupted her
[30:38] womb by receiving the wrong
[30:40] seed the wound that was supposed to
[30:43] bring forth that seed that child it was
[30:48] corrupted amen and and everything that
[30:51] came forth from that wound was now
[30:54] corrupted so she could no longer
[30:58] no longer keep that promise she could no
[31:00] longer produce that
[31:03] word and and so she can no longer
[31:05] produce
[31:06] Christ is that right but then God laid a
[31:10] prophecy down in verse 15 of chapter 3
[31:12] in Genesis that there would be a seed
[31:15] that would bruise the head of the
[31:16] Serpent's Seed amen he laid a prophecy
[31:18] sound that there would be a seed it
[31:20] would come forth but in order for that
[31:23] to come forth now he can't go to just
[31:26] any womb to any woman because it's all
[31:28] hybrid so now he has to come to a virgin
[31:31] womb amen a virgin womb amen and the
[31:35] Virgin womb of Mary amen God used now
[31:38] this wasn't any part of Mary it couldn't
[31:40] be part of Mary or else it would still
[31:42] be hybrid it still be corrupt but God
[31:44] had a virgin womb and in that virgin
[31:46] womb he planted himself his Creation in
[31:49] that womb and to bring forth out of a
[31:51] virgin wound showing it takes virgy amen
[31:54] because what we had before wouldn't work
[31:56] amen and then there he plants himself in
[31:59] there and now through a virgin wound
[32:03] amen Comes This seed Christ the body of
[32:07] Christ amen that wound produced the body
[32:11] of Christ or the body of Jesus Christ
[32:13] the flesh body so this is what God was
[32:16] doing in the prophecy amen and all of
[32:19] these things listen everything I'm
[32:21] talking about relates to us
[32:24] amen everything I'm talking about is not
[32:26] just a story story it's not just history
[32:28] you know it's wonderful to understand
[32:30] what happened I mean it's amazing to
[32:33] understand what happened it unlocks so
[32:35] much understanding when we understand
[32:37] what happened in the garden now we know
[32:39] why Jesus had to be virgin born yes and
[32:41] now we know why there had to be human
[32:43] blood as a sacrifice to atone for the
[32:45] sins of the people without understanding
[32:48] the Fall In the Garden of Eden our
[32:50] Christian religion becomes some sort of
[32:52] piece together fairy tale without a real
[32:54] logical understanding of why a a human
[32:57] sacrifice why a virgin birth the answer
[33:00] to the why is the Revelation that was
[33:03] laying under the seals of what what had
[33:05] happened back before the foundation of
[33:06] the world Amen but as wonderful as that
[33:09] is to know and the encouragement it
[33:11] gives us to have faith in God's word and
[33:13] faith in God's ability amen all of that
[33:17] relates to you and I and all of that
[33:19] must become personal to you and I
[33:22] because we say it this way everything
[33:24] God does in the macrocosm in the the
[33:27] great picture he's doing in the
[33:28] microcosm of your
[33:30] life and there has to be a correlation
[33:33] between the macro and the
[33:35] micro
[33:37] amen and the spoken word is the Original
[33:40] Seed he says the only way that we can
[33:42] ever be born again is first the womb of
[33:45] the Mind receive the word and then the
[33:48] spirit comes on top of that and brings
[33:50] it to life there you are that's what
[33:52] does it that's the real gospel teaching
[33:53] brother I believe it's I now I love this
[33:57] I believe if St Paul was standing today
[33:59] he teach the same thing I do in this
[34:01] hour I believe that amen I love the way
[34:05] he says that I didn't that wasn't even
[34:07] part of my thought I just had to
[34:08] conclude it it was so
[34:11] good then further down he says
[34:14] now Mary's wound Mary's wound the
[34:17] physical mind see was virgin WB why she
[34:22] believed God's word no matter how much
[34:24] anybody criticized how many things
[34:26] somebody else said that didn't have one
[34:28] thing to do with it she believed God's
[34:30] word regardless oh I wish I could just
[34:33] get that over are you getting it first
[34:36] was her mind before the act ever taken
[34:39] place in her little room the ACT had to
[34:41] take place here first to let the Spirit
[34:44] come in to do the rest of the work now
[34:47] he's even speaking about Mary when it
[34:50] comes to to the Virgin Mary now an angel
[34:53] comes to her an angel messenger comes to
[34:55] her and brings her a message amen and
[34:58] what's the message he's bringing to her
[35:00] he's bringing her to her amen God's will
[35:03] for her day he's bringing to her the
[35:07] revealed word for her hour that's what
[35:09] this Angel is bringing to Mary that th
[35:11] now he's telling her it's time for this
[35:14] prophecy that's been laying in this
[35:15] Bible so long it's time for this
[35:17] prophecy to be fulfilled
[35:20] amen but you realize with prophecy
[35:23] there's always a time and a place amen
[35:27] yeah so what this Angel messenger brings
[35:30] to to Mary is not just the time it's
[35:33] time that's wonderful but he brings to
[35:34] her the place amen and I tell you this I
[35:38] believe with all my heart it's easier
[35:40] for Mary to receive the time of the
[35:42] prophecy than to receive the place of
[35:43] the
[35:45] prophecy wow because she can say yes
[35:48] we've been waiting for this yes we want
[35:50] the Messiah yes and it's in you wait
[35:53] wait a second how is this going to be
[35:56] knowing that I know no no man I I can't
[35:58] see how I can do this I can't see how it
[36:00] can be me I'm just a a 15 16 year old
[36:03] girl amen living in Nazareth amen
[36:06] getting ready to be married to a man I I
[36:08] I want the promise to come I want it to
[36:10] be time I believe that it's time I
[36:12] believe that it's overdue I can see the
[36:14] condition we need the Messiah and then
[36:16] he says but the Messiah is coming from
[36:18] you and she said wait a minute hold
[36:20] on Amen praise God you
[36:25] realize that
[36:27] the when we look at prophecy and we look
[36:29] down through the Bible amen the woman
[36:31] has always been the hidden Mystery in
[36:34] the
[36:34] mystery
[36:36] am I hope I can I hope I can share this
[36:39] in a way that it'll it'll just start
[36:41] dinging the Revelation Bells inside when
[36:44] God said let us make man in our image
[36:46] and our likeness and he made them male
[36:48] and female God made one form one vessel
[36:51] and that one being was Adam and in Adam
[36:54] Adam was reflecting God Amen so Adam was
[36:57] a mystery revealed amen what was it it
[36:59] was the mystery of
[37:02] God yes let us make man in our image So
[37:05] Adam was the mystery of God
[37:10] revealed is that
[37:13] right but there's a further mystery in
[37:15] the mystery and the further mystery in
[37:18] the mystery was the bride amen was the
[37:20] feminine amen that had to be expressed
[37:23] as well so contained in the mystery was
[37:26] a another mystery and the other mystery
[37:28] was the woman
[37:30] amen praise God Amen all right yes so
[37:35] when when Adam was commissioned when he
[37:38] was still in spirit form he was
[37:41] commissioned to multiply and replenish
[37:43] amen so in order for God to bring that
[37:45] to pass he brings him in the
[37:47] flesh but that's not the end of the
[37:50] mystery in order to bring that to pass
[37:52] now he brings another part of Adam into
[37:55] flesh and that's the female part of Adam
[37:57] he brings in the flesh unites the two
[37:59] together and now the prophecy can be
[38:02] fulfilled and just before it's fulfilled
[38:05] the devil slips in but deception and
[38:08] corrupts her
[38:10] womb so we see where the problem is so
[38:13] the woman is
[38:16] always the hidden
[38:18] Mystery of the
[38:21] mystery God said I will put
[38:25] enmity between thy seed and her
[38:28] seed so there's a mystery laying in the
[38:31] woman but the question is which woman
[38:34] praise God there's which woman amen that
[38:37] was always the mystery which woman is it
[38:40] is it the woman of Israel the nation of
[38:42] Israel that God wants to marry will it
[38:44] be her she's in feminine distinction
[38:46] will it be the church where is this
[38:48] woman and all of a sudden the messenger
[38:50] from God comes to Mary and says you're
[38:52] the woman you're the revelation of the
[38:56] mystery that was in God's mind before
[38:57] the foundation of the world and when he
[38:59] says I will put imity between thy seat
[39:01] and her seat he was thinking of
[39:05] you and now all of a sudden you talk
[39:07] about a a big mouthful to swallow down
[39:11] this young girl amen who who who
[39:14] probably may have never hardly left her
[39:16] Village in her whole life maybe just a
[39:18] couple of times she had a very small
[39:20] world she had a very narrow window
[39:23] amen and now an angel comes to her and
[39:26] says you're it she was the great mystery
[39:30] that had been waiting to be revealed for
[39:33] thousands of years she was the mystery
[39:36] contained in the prophecy in the Bible
[39:38] she was it amen yes Genesis 3:15 she's
[39:43] part of it amen Isaiah 7 she's part of
[39:46] it all those scriptures she's part of it
[39:48] amen she doesn't know she's part of it
[39:50] cuz she was born with spiritual Amnesia
[39:52] she come into the world like you and I
[39:54] come into the world she has no
[39:56] understanding she didn't wake up and say
[39:58] I think I'm part of the prophecy no it
[40:00] took an angel messenger from God to wake
[40:03] her up to the fact that you're the one
[40:05] amen God you know we can look we can
[40:09] look at the prophecy amen and we can see
[40:12] am mean as it was in the days of Sodom
[40:14] so shall it be in the in the revealing
[40:16] of the son of man absolutely Sodom all
[40:18] over I mean the Sodom condition is here
[40:20] we can say that these things must be
[40:22] revealed at the end time we can look we
[40:24] got we see the flashing red lights of
[40:26] his we see the signs of the end all
[40:28] around us we can say it's time for this
[40:30] prophecy to be fulfilled and God sends
[40:32] an angel messenger and I day say this is
[40:35] the hour this is the time this is the
[40:37] Fulfillment of the scriptures and we can
[40:39] say amen hallelujah we need it we know
[40:42] it it's the return of Christ this is
[40:44] what we need this is the long awaited
[40:46] restoration the restoring all
[40:50] things but there's another mystery in
[40:53] that
[40:54] mystery and the Mystery in that mystery
[40:56] was not just the time but also the
[40:59] place where is the place where will this
[41:02] prophecy come to life where will it be
[41:04] manifest it'll be manifest I don't know
[41:07] what you can say but I can say by faith
[41:09] it'll be manifest here by the grace of
[41:11] God because I heard something else in
[41:14] the prophet's voice I heard more than
[41:16] it's time I heard it's time and you're
[41:20] it amen
[41:23] amen and
[41:25] Mary
[41:28] Mary had to believe
[41:30] something she could not
[41:33] prove she could not
[41:36] test how was she going to test
[41:39] it brother bandam said before she felt
[41:42] one
[41:44] thing before she had any evidence she
[41:48] was pregnant
[41:49] yeah the Bible doesn't show us that she
[41:52] waited another month to see what would
[41:55] happen
[41:56] but immediately she ran to Elizabeth's
[41:58] house and confessed to Elizabeth what
[42:00] had taken place in her life showing that
[42:03] Mary believed what this angel
[42:09] said see sometimes the problem is we're
[42:11] afraid to confess what our heart's
[42:13] telling us because we don't have the
[42:15] right evidence we don't have any proof
[42:17] I'm not so sure I still feel this way I
[42:19] woke up the next morning I'm feeling
[42:20] this way I'm not really sure if
[42:22] something's going on
[42:25] inside
[42:28] that's am Mary wasn't afraid to confess
[42:32] amen what she had
[42:34] believed what the angel had told her and
[42:37] so the
[42:39] woman is another part of this
[42:43] prophecy oh praise God I don't know
[42:47] where to go next I'm jumping around
[42:49] let's just jump let's take a jump you
[42:51] want to jump with
[42:52] me let's go to uh Genesis chapter
[43:04] 18 Genesis Chapter
[43:15] 18 let's look at verse one Genesis 18
[43:20] And1 in Genesis 18:1 it says and the
[43:23] Lord appeared unto him in the plains of
[43:25] mamry and he sat the tent Door In the
[43:27] Heat of the day and he lifted up his
[43:28] eyes and looked and lo three men stood
[43:30] by him when he saw them he ran to meet
[43:32] them from the tent door and bowed
[43:34] himself toward the ground and said my
[43:36] Lord if now I have found favor in thy
[43:38] sight pass pass not away I pray thee
[43:41] from thy
[43:42] servant so here in Genesis 18 the Lord
[43:47] is appearing to Abraham he's visiting
[43:52] Abraham amen and God had given Abraham a
[43:56] prophecy he had told Abraham that his
[43:58] seed shall inherit the
[44:01] land and and it was a prophecy all the
[44:04] way back when God first called Abraham
[44:07] he gave him this prophecy that that I'm
[44:10] G taking you to a land and I'm going to
[44:12] give it to you and your seed and and and
[44:14] he and God speaks to Abraham this way
[44:17] and then we come here after God had
[44:18] dealt with Abraham we saw Abraham's
[44:20] journeyings through the Book of Genesis
[44:22] and the Transitions and the movements
[44:25] and we see God come to him and I
[44:27] remember I think it was about 2 years
[44:29] ago maybe brother Les coli came to me
[44:31] after a service and he showed me that
[44:33] this is the seventh time that God comes
[44:37] to Abraham I didn't have time to look it
[44:39] up right then I I just believed him but
[44:41] just before I went to Edmonton this
[44:43] couple months ago I sat down and I went
[44:45] through the Book of Genesis and I looked
[44:47] at it and this is exactly the seventh
[44:49] time that God Appears to
[44:51] Abraham the seventh time God comes to
[44:53] Abraham either comes to him in a vision
[44:55] he speaks to him by a voice he appears
[44:57] to him in some other way amen and this
[44:59] is the seventh time and so the seventh
[45:01] time that God comes Amen to the Seed of
[45:04] Abraham to the the the recipient of the
[45:06] promise and the seventh time something's
[45:09] going to
[45:11] transpire so beautiful friends this word
[45:15] just keeps unveiling keeps
[45:17] unfolding and and through the prophecy
[45:23] he keeps telling Abraham you know this
[45:26] is your land the your seed shall possess
[45:28] it but he has no
[45:30] seed he can't have a child and the
[45:33] problem is is is there's no
[45:36] conception is that
[45:38] right there's no way to produce the
[45:41] promise because Sarah is
[45:45] Barren and Sarah is Abraham's wife and
[45:49] and so Sarah realizes she's Barren and
[45:52] she tells Abraham the Lord is uh
[45:54] withholding me from having child take
[45:56] Hagar it's legal we can do this and
[45:59] perhaps they'll raise up a child and all
[46:01] of the we we understand all we've been
[46:03] through all of that before but but we we
[46:05] realize now that Sarah didn't doubt the
[46:10] promise she believed the promise her
[46:13] effort to produce the promise showed she
[46:15] believ in the promise what Sarah was
[46:17] missing was not the timing of the
[46:19] promise or the faith in the promise she
[46:21] was missing the place of the promise
[46:23] that's right she was missing her part in
[46:26] the
[46:27] prophecy believing the prophecy she
[46:30] believed that Abraham was chosen of God
[46:31] no doubt Abraham discussed these things
[46:33] with her wife she believed the prophecy
[46:35] she believed he would have a seed to
[46:36] believed he would inherit the land amen
[46:38] but she didn't believe she could do it
[46:42] amen she didn't believe it could be her
[46:45] so then there's a there's a visitation
[46:47] and a visitation and a visitation and a
[46:49] visitation but now we have the seventh
[46:52] visitation and in the seventh visitation
[46:54] God comes in
[46:56] flesh in the seventh Church age in the
[46:59] seventh visitation now God doesn't just
[47:01] come as a vision he doesn't come as a
[47:03] voice now he comes in
[47:07] flesh amen the same thing repeat in our
[47:10] day in the seventh Church a god Came In
[47:12] the Flesh of a prophet amen it was a son
[47:14] of man revealing the son of man amen the
[47:17] PLS of man were repeated where he
[47:19] discerned the thoughts in Sarah's uh
[47:21] heart been the tent door behind him and
[47:23] the prophet of God stood here and did
[47:24] the same thing referencing re Genesis 18
[47:28] showing us that this event is taking
[47:31] place in our
[47:35] day and before we come to the seventh
[47:38] visitation God starts visiting Abraham
[47:42] starts telling him it's
[47:44] Sarah not until I think it's the I think
[47:47] it's the sixth time that he comes to him
[47:49] not until then he says out of he says
[47:52] you'll have a seed then he says out of
[47:54] thy loins
[47:56] see the prophecy's
[47:58] building new bits of information are
[48:01] coming all the time it never changed the
[48:03] prophecy it was true from day one when
[48:06] the culmination was already determined
[48:08] when he first spoke it but every time
[48:10] God visits Abraham he adds a little more
[48:15] amen he says your seed shall possess the
[48:19] land then he says what will you give me
[48:21] another visitation what will you give me
[48:23] seeing I have no child Amen in this
[48:24] eleas or us and and all these things he
[48:27] says no it won't be thy servant amen
[48:29] it'll come from your loins now he's got
[48:31] more information now there settles the
[48:33] confusion I'm not looking to adopt a
[48:35] seed to make a seed it'll come out of my
[48:38] loins
[48:41] amen then go on more information and
[48:44] more information until finally I think
[48:46] it's the sixth visitation I didn't go
[48:47] back and check it but he comes and he
[48:49] says no out of Sarah Sarah shall have
[48:52] the child Sarah shall have the son is
[48:55] that right
[48:56] right so then we come to the
[49:00] seventh and in the seventh God's coming
[49:04] down to confirm the
[49:08] promise this is just amazing to me let's
[49:10] go to verse n chapter
[49:14] 18:9 and they said unto him where is
[49:17] Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the
[49:19] tent he said I will certainly return
[49:22] unto thee according to the time of life
[49:23] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[49:26] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[49:28] which was behind him now Abraham and
[49:31] Sarah were old and well stricken in age
[49:33] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[49:34] man or women therefore Sarah laughed
[49:37] within herself saying after I am waxed
[49:39] old shall I have pleasure my Lord uh my
[49:43] my Lord being old also and the Lord said
[49:46] unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh
[49:48] saying shall I of shy bear a child which
[49:50] am old is anything too hard for the Lord
[49:54] at the time appointed I will return unto
[49:56] thee according to the time of life and
[49:59] Sarah shall have a
[50:02] son he
[50:05] come he came in
[50:08] flesh and when he came in flesh and he
[50:11] showed the sign of the Messiah because
[50:13] this would become the sign of the
[50:14] Messiah when Jesus is
[50:16] here he came in
[50:19] flesh and what was he
[50:23] doing he had come to Abraham
[50:26] and he had come to Abraham and he had
[50:28] come to
[50:29] Abraham and as far as we know in all of
[50:32] those visitations Sarah was never
[50:37] included but in this visitation God was
[50:41] going to include Sarah
[50:43] amen now the the word would be performed
[50:47] on her now the discernment would be on
[50:51] her when in the seventh visitation when
[50:55] he comes comes in
[50:56] flesh
[50:59] says it this is the this is the message
[51:02] uh resume of the ages from the church
[51:04] age book the last chapter of the church
[51:06] age book said this age started just
[51:08] after the turn of the of the 20th
[51:10] century as it was to be the age in which
[51:13] the true church would return to being
[51:15] the bride she was at Pentecost we know
[51:17] that there must of necessity be a return
[51:19] of dynamic power so he begins to speak
[51:22] about what happened in the Pentecostal
[51:24] Revival at zeusa Street but I just
[51:26] wanted to grab this statement he said it
[51:28] was it was to be the age in which the
[51:30] true church would return to being the
[51:32] bride she was at Pentecost what bride
[51:34] was she was Pentecost she was a virgin
[51:38] bride is that right but the prophet told
[51:41] us before that he came to her in the
[51:44] Union in the marriage Union she was
[51:45] already a fallen woman so in returning
[51:50] and returning her back to what she was
[51:53] at Pentecost would bring her her back to
[51:56] a virgin bride amen but Pentecost never
[51:59] went on to the full promise they fell
[52:01] before the full promise we understand
[52:04] that so returning back to Pentecost is
[52:06] not the
[52:07] destination returning back to Pentecost
[52:10] brings us back to a condition so that we
[52:12] can fulfill what they
[52:15] failed and what was that to go all the
[52:18] way on to a union with Christ amen and
[52:21] then do what reproduce Christ
[52:24] amen this is important things to
[52:27] understand it's you got to take the
[52:28] whole message and to get the whole
[52:30] picture of what the prophet's telling us
[52:33] because if we go back and stop at
[52:34] Pentecost Pentecost was the starting
[52:36] point not the stopping point so to
[52:38] return back to the faith of the
[52:39] Pentecostal fathers amen just brings us
[52:41] back to the right starting point so that
[52:43] we can finish the commission not so that
[52:45] we can go back there and stay there and
[52:46] camp out there and say this is wonderful
[52:49] we return you return to do what they
[52:51] didn't do that's the point of the return
[52:56] and so when in the seventh in the
[52:58] seventh visitation when God comes in
[52:59] flesh and discerns the thoughts and and
[53:02] the tent behind him and he does all of
[53:03] that what immediately happens after that
[53:06] immediately after that they're turned
[53:07] back young amen is that right because
[53:10] then in the next chapter amen they go
[53:12] down to Gar and when they go down to Gar
[53:14] amen all of a sudden we know aimc the
[53:16] king of gar he wants to take Sarah amen
[53:19] who's already 80 years old to be his
[53:21] wife because he assumes she's a fair
[53:23] young virgin why because the 80-year-old
[53:25] Sarah was young again this King could
[53:27] have any virgin he wants the prophet
[53:28] shows us this out of the Bible and and
[53:30] he wants Sarah because Sarah is
[53:32] beautiful being an 80y old woman so we
[53:35] see that in the seventh age in the
[53:38] visitation when God came in flesh amen
[53:40] he turned them back young but it's going
[53:42] to take something more than going back
[53:44] to their original condition because in
[53:47] Sarah's original condition she had not
[53:49] yet conceived the promise and brought
[53:51] forth the
[53:52] promise amen there's a Myster laying in
[53:56] Sarah and the promise was to Abraham but
[53:58] Sarah was part of Abraham so she's part
[54:00] of the mystery she's the mystery behind
[54:02] the
[54:05] mystery
[54:07] amen so now they go back to young again
[54:12] but when they go back to young again it
[54:15] still doesn't bring a
[54:20] conception it brings him back to the
[54:22] right
[54:23] condition so that she can bear a child
[54:27] carry the child remember brother Brenham
[54:29] said she her heart was old she would had
[54:31] a heart attack her milk veins were dyed
[54:33] up she couldn't bring forth this life
[54:34] first he had to take her back to her
[54:36] youth back to her original condition
[54:38] back to the faith of the fathers back to
[54:40] what she was at Pentecost so that she
[54:42] could bring forth this child in strength
[54:44] not in
[54:46] weakness there's still no conception
[54:50] right so we go through verse
[54:53] 20 gar
[54:55] we go to or chapter 20 now we go to
[54:57] chapter
[54:59] 21 and in chapter 18 we've been through
[55:02] this before but I just want to refresh
[55:04] you chapter 18 he says I will return
[55:06] unto thee who's he speaking to Abraham
[55:10] he say because Sarah's in the tent
[55:12] behind Abra he tells Abraham I will
[55:14] return unto thee at the appointed time I
[55:17] will return unto thee according to the
[55:19] time of life and Sarah shall have a
[55:22] son now they're young they go to
[55:25] gar they have the all the things that
[55:27] transpire in gar then he sends them away
[55:30] and Abraham has to pray for them and all
[55:32] that transpires and after that he comes
[55:35] to verse
[55:36] 21 it says and the Lord visited Sarah as
[55:40] he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah
[55:44] as he had spoken for Sarah conceived and
[55:47] bear Abraham a son in his old age at the
[55:49] set time of which God had spoken to
[55:53] him God said to Abraham I will visit
[56:00] you you realize after he said that we
[56:03] don't read anym in the Bible where he
[56:05] visited
[56:06] Abraham because Sarah is part of
[56:11] Abraham and so when he says I will visit
[56:14] you at the appointed time I will visit
[56:17] you how did that visit take place it
[56:20] took place in chapter 21 when the Lord
[56:22] visited Sarah amen
[56:26] look in this visitation when you look
[56:28] into this visitation he says and the
[56:30] Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken and
[56:33] for Sarah conceived here comes the
[56:37] conception not in the seventh visitation
[56:40] but this is the eighth visitation this
[56:42] is the eighth time he come and the
[56:44] eighth time is life eighth time is
[56:46] eternity eighth is new day amen now he
[56:49] confirmed the promise and now he's here
[56:50] to fulfill the promise and he comes to
[56:53] Sarah in the eighth visitation which is
[56:55] the first back to the beginning
[56:58] again and in this visitation we don't
[57:01] have a public sign a public working and
[57:03] nothing we can reference there's nothing
[57:07] tell me what happened what did he say
[57:09] what did it look like was it smoke was
[57:10] it fire was it voice we have no record
[57:13] whatsoever in 211 of what happened the
[57:16] only thing we know is that he visited
[57:18] Sarah how we don't know what was the
[57:21] experience we don't know what did she
[57:23] see we don't know what did she hear we
[57:25] don't know what did she feel we don't
[57:27] know one thing we know for sure she got
[57:29] a private visitation from God herself
[57:32] and that visitation produced a
[57:35] conception which is what they did not
[57:37] have at
[57:39] [Applause]
[57:40] Pentecost amen amen so the seventh
[57:44] visitation God in flesh PLS of memmory
[57:47] bring us back to a virgin condition back
[57:50] to what we are at Pentecost to move into
[57:53] the conception but to come come to
[57:55] conception it's going to take a
[57:56] visitation from almighty God privately
[57:59] to you amen and you don't have anything
[58:01] to base it off of
[58:03] Amen you don't have any certain sign to
[58:06] look for you don't have any certain
[58:08] experience you can attach it to amen
[58:10] because because in the third pool amen
[58:12] when they went into the little room they
[58:14] had nothing that they could express
[58:16] nothing that could they say nothing that
[58:18] they could explain all they could say is
[58:20] where I was this way coming in I'm this
[58:22] way coming out something happened to me
[58:25] everything is different for me but I
[58:27] can't give you the formula I can't give
[58:29] you a recipe I can't give you something
[58:31] to repeat and I can't oh my goodness I
[58:35] can't confuse you with my
[58:41] recipe you just have to come in contact
[58:44] with God
[58:51] yourself for what
[58:53] purpose
[58:55] for what
[58:57] purpose see this is the thing that
[58:59] becomes so intriguing and so
[59:02] important we can talk about meeting God
[59:05] and we can talk about an experience with
[59:06] God and we can talk about uh the little
[59:09] room and we can talk about the third
[59:10] pool and we can talk about and we can
[59:12] get excited we can
[59:14] shout But realize that visitation was to
[59:18] do
[59:20] something not so for the rest of Sarah's
[59:23] life she says I met God I had an
[59:25] experience with God yes but what did it
[59:27] do for you what was the experience for
[59:30] what was the private visitation to do it
[59:32] was to fulfill the promise in her what
[59:35] she could not do herself what she could
[59:37] not produce what she didn't have
[59:39] strength for amen and all of her efforts
[59:41] all of her life she could not
[59:44] conceive when she was a virgin brother
[59:46] Bram said they probably lived together
[59:47] since she was a little girl 15 16 years
[59:49] of age amen and all the opportunities
[59:52] they had to come together for conception
[59:54] when she was in the prime of her health
[59:55] when the prime of her her strength he
[59:58] could not produce this son could not
[59:59] produce this son it was going to take
[1:00:01] God himself coming on the scene and when
[1:00:03] God himself came on the scene in the
[1:00:05] seventh visitation what was he trying to
[1:00:07] do he was trying to awaken Sarah to her
[1:00:11] part in the
[1:00:12] prophecy and in this seventh visit in
[1:00:14] the seventh Church age when God repeated
[1:00:16] what he did on the plains of memory he's
[1:00:18] trying to wake up the bride to her part
[1:00:20] in the
[1:00:21] prophecy it's you amen it's you it's not
[1:00:25] your handmade it's not somebody else
[1:00:27] it's not another age it's not in the
[1:00:28] future you're not too old
[1:00:33] amen praise God let's go to Hebrews
[1:00:36] chapter
[1:00:45] 11 Hebrews chapter
[1:00:51] 11
[1:00:53] verse 11
[1:00:56] through
[1:00:58] faith chapter 11 is the faith chapter
[1:01:02] without faith is impossible to please
[1:01:03] God the worlds were framed by the faith
[1:01:05] faith is the evidence faith is the
[1:01:08] substance through faith also Sarah
[1:01:11] herself received strength to conceive
[1:01:15] seed and was delivered of child when she
[1:01:18] was past age because she judged him
[1:01:20] faithful who had
[1:01:23] promised
[1:01:26] I love this
[1:01:27] scripture we've preached it before but
[1:01:29] this scripture has come to life to me in
[1:01:31] this last
[1:01:34] year by
[1:01:37] faith through faith Sarah
[1:01:41] herself received
[1:01:45] strength where did Sarah get this
[1:01:48] Faith
[1:01:51] amen she read what did what did the
[1:01:54] Faith do through faith she received
[1:01:57] strength to conceive seed what was it
[1:02:00] Sarah could not do conceive seed she
[1:02:04] could not conceive seed when she was
[1:02:06] young when she was a faithful wife when
[1:02:09] she lived for years in the strength bar
[1:02:12] childbearing years she could not produce
[1:02:14] this then she gets old she knows she
[1:02:16] can't do it she's lost all faith in her
[1:02:18] being part of the promise then God comes
[1:02:20] down and restores her faith and begins
[1:02:22] to show her a sign of discernment and
[1:02:23] turns her back young again and though
[1:02:25] she's back young it still doesn't change
[1:02:28] the problem she can't conceive seed she
[1:02:31] can be
[1:02:35] young she can be all that she was when
[1:02:38] she was a young virgin bride to her
[1:02:40] husband she can be all that she was that
[1:02:43] the first church was you understand what
[1:02:45] I'm saying go back to being everything
[1:02:47] the first church was but the first
[1:02:50] church failed amen so there's got to be
[1:02:53] something more happened then just going
[1:02:55] back to being what the first church was
[1:02:57] we have to go back to that Amen to
[1:02:59] restore our strength but it's going to
[1:03:01] take Faith amen for us to bring a
[1:03:04] conception and what kind of Faith listen
[1:03:07] I'm I'm telling you it's not communal
[1:03:09] Faith it's not group Faith Sarah herself
[1:03:12] individual Faith herself received
[1:03:15] strength to conceive SE why through
[1:03:17] faith how did she get the strength to
[1:03:18] conceive this seed through faith what
[1:03:20] awakened her faith it was a personal
[1:03:22] visitation from God
[1:03:25] amen
[1:03:27] amen oh
[1:03:29] friends praise be to God Amen let's
[1:03:33] let's take this message the entirety of
[1:03:35] the message amen and say God hey this is
[1:03:38] something that you've done this is not
[1:03:39] something man's done amen when you see
[1:03:42] what God did here to Abraham to fulfill
[1:03:44] the promise God came to Abraham Abraham
[1:03:46] never came to God God gave him a promise
[1:03:49] Abraham believed that promise where did
[1:03:52] Abraham get the faith to believe that
[1:03:54] from God Amen then God you know every
[1:03:58] time God came to Abraham Abraham never
[1:04:01] came to God God came to
[1:04:03] Abraham and then when you come in flesh
[1:04:05] in the in the seventh visitation God
[1:04:07] came to Abraham a mean it was God God
[1:04:10] God God performed this God did this God
[1:04:13] willed this God accomplished this God
[1:04:15] did it
[1:04:17] all that's what we realize it's
[1:04:20] God Amen but God has a Time
[1:04:25] and God has a
[1:04:28] place oh praise be to God well praise
[1:04:33] the Lord I don't have a clue where I'm
[1:04:36] at but I'm happy am I'm feeling good
[1:04:39] wherever I'm at it's a happy place
[1:04:42] because God is unveiling the mysteries
[1:04:44] of our
[1:04:45] life amen praise the
[1:04:50] Lord
[1:04:53] so
[1:04:57] ah yeah let's go to Ephesians chapter
[1:05:03] 4 let's pick it up right here and just
[1:05:05] see where we go from here Ephesians
[1:05:09] chapter
[1:05:11] 4 verse
[1:05:13] 17
[1:05:15] remember he had just said in spoken
[1:05:17] words the original see we read this
[1:05:19] before the only way that we can ever be
[1:05:20] born again is first in the womb of our
[1:05:22] mind receive the word and then the
[1:05:24] Spirit comes on top of that and brings
[1:05:26] it to life he talks about Mary Mary
[1:05:29] first Mary's wom the physical mind see
[1:05:32] she was a virgin womb she believed God's
[1:05:35] word so first it was in her mind first
[1:05:37] she received the word and then when she
[1:05:39] received the word by faith then it came
[1:05:41] to pass in her body so now let's look at
[1:05:44] Ephesians chapter 4:1
[1:05:49] 17 says this I say therefore and testify
[1:05:52] in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not
[1:05:54] as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[1:05:56] their
[1:05:56] mind having the understanding dark and
[1:05:59] being alienated from being alienated
[1:06:02] from the life of God through the
[1:06:03] ignorance that is in them because of the
[1:06:05] blindness of their heart who being past
[1:06:07] feeling have given themselves over into
[1:06:09] lasciviousness to work all uncleanness
[1:06:11] with
[1:06:12] greediness but ye have not so learned
[1:06:15] Christ if so be that you have heard him
[1:06:17] and have been taught by him as the truth
[1:06:20] is in Jesus that you put off concerning
[1:06:22] the former conversation the old man
[1:06:24] which is corrupt according to deceitful
[1:06:26] lust and be renewed in the spirit of
[1:06:28] your mind and that you put on the new
[1:06:31] man which after God has created and
[1:06:33] righteousness and true Holiness this is
[1:06:37] this is just referencing what brother
[1:06:39] bam talked about first it was in her
[1:06:41] mind and our minds were alienated from
[1:06:43] God because of the ignorance that was in
[1:06:45] us the darkness that was in us when we
[1:06:47] were born and walked as other Gentiles
[1:06:49] walk so what is God going to do first
[1:06:51] he's going to pierce the darkness with
[1:06:52] an illumination with the word amen and
[1:06:55] and that word that illumination is going
[1:06:57] to bring something to our minds that we
[1:06:59] receive then the spirit comes upon it
[1:07:01] it'll bring a new birth praise
[1:07:04] God he says again in spoken word he says
[1:07:08] now what was it a virgin mind womb
[1:07:11] virgin womb for the baby results eternal
[1:07:14] life Eve a good woman as she was virgin
[1:07:18] as she was but first she let the doubt
[1:07:20] come in by the word a devil's lie what
[1:07:23] did to do brought her into contact in
[1:07:26] the wrong way what was her child death
[1:07:30] Mary a virgin mine virgin womb when the
[1:07:33] devil tried to tempt her and the angel
[1:07:35] come to her then and said you're going
[1:07:37] to have a baby Satan said oh now I
[1:07:40] better inquire about that angel said
[1:07:42] it's an act of God and she no doubt
[1:07:45] thought of Isaiah 9:6 she said behold
[1:07:48] the hands made of the Lord what's the
[1:07:50] results virgin birth Eternal Word in her
[1:07:54] and she brought forth eternal life
[1:07:57] what's he saying one deception brings
[1:08:00] death but then when the word comes amen
[1:08:04] it comes into her mind and she remembers
[1:08:07] the word Isaiah 9:6 and then she
[1:08:09] surrenders to the word what's the
[1:08:11] results
[1:08:13] life
[1:08:15] amen praise
[1:08:17] God let's look at Colossians
[1:08:21] 1 Colossians chapter 1
[1:08:29] verse
[1:08:31] 19 for it pleased the father that in him
[1:08:33] should all fullness
[1:08:35] dwell praise
[1:08:37] God and having made peace through the
[1:08:39] blood of his cross by him to reconcile
[1:08:41] all things unto himself by him I say
[1:08:44] whether they be things in Earth or
[1:08:45] things in heaven and ye that were
[1:08:48] sometimes alienated in enemies in your
[1:08:50] mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he
[1:08:53] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[1:08:55] through death to present you holy and
[1:08:57] unblamable and unreprovable in his sight
[1:09:01] praise God we were alienated and enemies
[1:09:05] in our mind why we had the wrong
[1:09:08] understanding no understanding carnal
[1:09:10] Spirit carnal thinking the reasoning
[1:09:12] that Satan had brought uh to Eve had
[1:09:16] permeated the whole world it's what we
[1:09:18] were raised in we were raised in the
[1:09:22] reasoning of the world the the the
[1:09:24] darkened mind we were alienated in
[1:09:27] enemies in our mind but God was going to
[1:09:29] bring a word to pierce the darkness and
[1:09:32] drive the darkness
[1:09:34] away now this is where I'm really
[1:09:36] wanting to to labor for a little bit
[1:09:38] again in spoken word he says when Christ
[1:09:40] comes to his bride she'll be a virgin
[1:09:43] like Mary was this is so so good so hang
[1:09:48] with me for God will not bring Christ
[1:09:51] through a womb of a and neither
[1:09:53] will he bring the bride he can't bring
[1:09:55] his word through a of his word now
[1:09:59] I want to listen to that sentence again
[1:10:02] carefully God will not bring Christ
[1:10:04] through a womb of a and neither
[1:10:06] will he bring the
[1:10:08] bride so what's he wanting to bring in
[1:10:11] this day he's wanting to bring forth a
[1:10:12] bride
[1:10:14] amen which is
[1:10:17] Christ he can't bring his word through a
[1:10:20] of his word them is horrible words
[1:10:23] but that's what the Bible says I'm
[1:10:25] saying what it says this has got to be
[1:10:28] understood the pro the true bride like
[1:10:30] Mary will have a virgin wound for the
[1:10:32] Bride of the word which is Christ when
[1:10:35] Christ the word comes to the bride
[1:10:38] she'll be the same as he is a Virgin by
[1:10:41] the word praise God Amen I hope it's
[1:10:44] going over see I hope you understand
[1:10:48] what was he word the word of God upon
[1:10:50] his vest had a name written the word of
[1:10:52] God in the beginning was the word the
[1:10:53] word was with God the Word was God and
[1:10:55] the Word was made flesh and one Among Us
[1:10:57] he is God and God is the word and when
[1:11:00] his bride comes she'll be the same
[1:11:02] product that he is amen then he says
[1:11:06] virgin
[1:11:08] yes oh we're going to get to this
[1:11:10] friends because you and I in the wombs
[1:11:13] of our mind in the spiritual womb we
[1:11:15] were not virgin we had listened to
[1:11:17] everything heard everything listened to
[1:11:19] every kind of Filth told every kind and
[1:11:21] heard every kind of joke watched every
[1:11:23] kind of program seen heard participated
[1:11:26] in the wickedness of this world how can
[1:11:28] we say our minds were
[1:11:32] virgin but when he comes to her she'll
[1:11:34] be virgin amen what a dilemma we're born
[1:11:38] in hybridization with the wrong spirit
[1:11:40] with the womb of our spirit totally
[1:11:42] corrupted and polluted alienated in our
[1:11:44] mind we come in a horrible condition no
[1:11:47] ability no ability to bring forth Christ
[1:11:49] no ability to conceive no no no
[1:11:52] cleanness that we can offer no clean
[1:11:54] place for the word to come to is that
[1:11:57] right we have none of that but he says
[1:11:59] when he comes to her she'll be virgin I
[1:12:02] believe it what a dilemma we've got amen
[1:12:05] and and you know here's what causes some
[1:12:06] of the dilemma and people to receive
[1:12:08] this prophecy they said well I did this
[1:12:10] and I did that and I thought this and I
[1:12:13] conducted this and I participated in
[1:12:15] this and I did all of these things how
[1:12:17] could God choose me my how could he
[1:12:19] choose you he chose you before you did
[1:12:21] all those
[1:12:22] things
[1:12:24] hallelujah amen the those things weren't
[1:12:26] in the equation when he chose you he
[1:12:27] chose you before and none of those
[1:12:29] things amen can do away with his choice
[1:12:32] praise God when God makes a choice it's
[1:12:35] permanent it's Everlasting amen it's a
[1:12:37] product of his of his perfect
[1:12:39] understanding and knowledge amen he
[1:12:40] didn't make a choice just to change his
[1:12:42] choice because he didn't know that they
[1:12:43] were going to fall into sin that doesn't
[1:12:45] make that leaves God like you and I weak
[1:12:49] and and feeble and subject to the
[1:12:51] elements and the changes all around him
[1:12:53] that's not God said I am God and I
[1:12:56] change
[1:12:58] not so none of those things matter but
[1:13:00] yet they leave us in a poor condition to
[1:13:03] bring forth the
[1:13:04] word that right yes do you agree amen
[1:13:08] that doesn't change God's mind if God
[1:13:10] saw us in the prophecy nothing's going
[1:13:12] to change that when he saw Sarah her old
[1:13:14] age her inability to conceive none of it
[1:13:16] mattered he already saw her in the
[1:13:18] promise amen and because he saw her in
[1:13:21] the promise now because it was in his
[1:13:24] mind now he's obligated himself to bring
[1:13:27] the promise to pass because his subjects
[1:13:29] can't do it Hallelujah they can't not do
[1:13:32] it the recipients of the prophecy the
[1:13:34] time of the prophecy the place of the
[1:13:36] prophecy they cannot perform the
[1:13:38] prophecy but because it was eternal in
[1:13:41] God's thinking now he's got to come on
[1:13:43] the scene and he's got to facilitate
[1:13:46] amen the performance of his word prise
[1:13:49] God because his subjects can't do it
[1:13:51] they were born in hybridization they
[1:13:52] were Fallen when they were ruined
[1:13:56] amen so if God is going to have a virgin
[1:14:00] bride
[1:14:01] yes then you know if if let's just take
[1:14:06] it this way if God is going to have a
[1:14:09] virgin bride that's going to be the
[1:14:10] Fulfillment of the prophecy like Sarah
[1:14:12] was the Fulfillment of the
[1:14:15] prophecy what will the bride have to
[1:14:19] do to perform this prophecy in herself
[1:14:23] nothing what could Sarah
[1:14:26] do what could Sarah
[1:14:28] do what strength did she have what
[1:14:30] ability what could she do to bring forth
[1:14:33] the promised son she could do nothing
[1:14:37] amen it was completely out of her
[1:14:39] hands what could Mary do to bring forth
[1:14:43] the
[1:14:44] Messiah nothing she didn't know any man
[1:14:47] it was completely out of her hands it
[1:14:49] was out of her control so when it was
[1:14:51] time God would come to the place at the
[1:14:53] appointed time and he would visit amen
[1:14:56] Mary at the appointed
[1:15:00] time
[1:15:02] amen so now God has a time and he has a
[1:15:06] place to bring forth his word and he's
[1:15:09] promised she'll be virgin but we have
[1:15:11] our dilemma because we're so messed up
[1:15:13] in our
[1:15:18] minds so he gives a little clue when
[1:15:21] Christ comes the word comes to the bride
[1:15:23] she'll be the same as he is a Virgin by
[1:15:28] the word
[1:15:33] amen when his bride comes she'll be the
[1:15:36] same product he is Virgin did Christ
[1:15:39] belong to a denomination did Jehovah
[1:15:41] neither does his bride she is part of
[1:15:43] him she needs no dgma she won't have any
[1:15:46] she'll be absolutely
[1:15:48] virgin so when he comes to his bride she
[1:15:50] won't be the
[1:15:51] nomination because because that's
[1:15:53] receiving the seed of a man is that
[1:15:55] right how many of you were in
[1:15:57] denominational Church before he came to
[1:15:58] the message how many of you believe
[1:16:00] denominational
[1:16:02] Doctrine that's the seed of a man in the
[1:16:05] womb of your spirit you've received the
[1:16:06] seed of a man what are you going to do
[1:16:09] now are you disqualified from the
[1:16:13] promise no what we can't produce he's
[1:16:16] going to come on the scene and he's
[1:16:17] going to change the condition because we
[1:16:19] were part of the prophecy from the
[1:16:22] beginning
[1:16:23] so he says she'll be absolutely virgin
[1:16:25] and then he says how I highlighted this
[1:16:28] how I want to know how tell me how how I
[1:16:32] who believed all this false Doctrine I
[1:16:34] who did all these horrible things how am
[1:16:35] I going to be virgin he said how by the
[1:16:39] word not by your efforts not by your
[1:16:42] cleaning up programs not by your
[1:16:44] self-righteousness not by legalism how
[1:16:47] it's going to be by the word it's
[1:16:49] something you can't do just like it's
[1:16:50] something Sarah can't do it's something
[1:16:52] he has has to
[1:16:55] do says amen she'll punctuate every word
[1:16:57] of God say amen amen be it unto me
[1:17:00] according to Thy word amen oh my there
[1:17:03] you are punctuate God's word have a
[1:17:06] virgin wound what will she come out of a
[1:17:08] virgin wound the word what did Jesus
[1:17:11] come out of a virgin wound am which is
[1:17:13] what the
[1:17:15] word amen again in spoken word he says
[1:17:18] now this body is to do the same because
[1:17:20] the body is head and body is together
[1:17:22] that's right right if Christ is the head
[1:17:25] was the word his body has to be the same
[1:17:27] thing that his head was that right and a
[1:17:30] Church of God born of the word of God uh
[1:17:32] born of the word virgin born from the
[1:17:35] word not denominational now virgin born
[1:17:38] from the word amen now we're getting
[1:17:41] into the true true New
[1:17:45] Birth because it's going to take a true
[1:17:47] New Birth Amen on the inside of you Amen
[1:17:50] to bring you into a virgin condition
[1:17:53] amen because the original your original
[1:17:55] birth and everything that goes with it
[1:17:57] is so corrupted and so polluted it can't
[1:17:59] be used by God so God is going to bring
[1:18:01] a spiritual birth to bring forth a
[1:18:04] spiritual
[1:18:08] seed let's go to Ephesians
[1:18:20] 5 Ephesians 5:25
[1:18:25] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[1:18:27] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:18:28] for it that he might sanctify and
[1:18:31] cleanse it with the washing of Water by
[1:18:33] the word how is he going to sanctify and
[1:18:37] cleanse his wife by the
[1:18:44] word when we when we read this
[1:18:48] scripture when we get to the
[1:18:50] end verse 32 he says this this is a
[1:18:53] great mystery but I speak concerning
[1:18:54] Christ and the church it's like he's
[1:18:57] talking about marriages but he's really
[1:18:58] talking about Christ and the church
[1:19:01] right so husbands love your wives even
[1:19:02] as Christ loved the church and gave
[1:19:04] himself for it that he might sanctify
[1:19:06] and cleanse it with the washing of Water
[1:19:09] by the word that he might present to
[1:19:12] himself a glorious church not having
[1:19:15] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[1:19:17] that it should be holy and without
[1:19:21] blemish
[1:19:25] God is going to present to himself oh
[1:19:28] yeah amen how because he's going to wash
[1:19:33] her by the washing of the water of the
[1:19:36] word he's going to purify her by the
[1:19:39] word he's going to cleanse her by the
[1:19:42] word he's going to whatever her
[1:19:44] condition is he is going to change her
[1:19:47] condition by the word yes amen amen what
[1:19:50] is she going to have to do to have this
[1:19:53] change in her life there's only one
[1:19:55] thing that she has to do and it's the
[1:19:56] same thing Mary did all she can do is
[1:19:58] surrender to it and say be it unto me
[1:20:00] according to your word
[1:20:04] amen in The Invisible Union of the bride
[1:20:07] of Christ the prophet says what is
[1:20:09] sin he says sin is unbelief unbelief in
[1:20:13] what the word unbelief in God which is
[1:20:15] the word pure unadultered oh Hallelujah
[1:20:18] leaving soon for the skies amen standing
[1:20:21] ready think your garments Washed by the
[1:20:23] Water of the bleeding word the word
[1:20:26] become blood the word bled for you and
[1:20:28] you are washed in bleeding word he says
[1:20:31] what do you mean the word bled for me if
[1:20:33] you go back to John 1:14 he said the
[1:20:36] word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:20:38] when was that it's referring to Jesus
[1:20:40] Christ the word in the beginning was the
[1:20:42] word the word was with God the Word was
[1:20:44] God Amen that was Christ amen the word
[1:20:46] was made flesh and dwell Among Us that
[1:20:48] was Christ when the word was made flesh
[1:20:50] and dwell Among Us it was then taken
[1:20:52] crucified nailed to a cross and that
[1:20:54] word
[1:20:55] bled which which word was it what part
[1:20:58] of the word it was the fullness of the
[1:21:00] word nailed to the cross so the full
[1:21:02] measure of the word bled for you and
[1:21:05] died for you and so now when you come to
[1:21:07] the fresh kill of the word what is the
[1:21:09] fresh kill of the word the fresh kill of
[1:21:11] the word is where there's fresh blood
[1:21:12] amen the fresh blood is with the fresh
[1:21:14] kill and in our day there's a fresh
[1:21:17] outpouring of the spirit of God because
[1:21:19] there's a there's a the full measure of
[1:21:21] the word that was crucified has returned
[1:21:24] to the church with the blood the spirit
[1:21:27] the life amen to do the cleansing work
[1:21:29] in
[1:21:30] US you cannot separate the spirit and
[1:21:33] the word amen you can't say I want the
[1:21:36] spirit but I don't want the word amen
[1:21:39] the spirit comes with the word amen it's
[1:21:41] the bleeding word the blood represents
[1:21:43] the life the word is the word the word
[1:21:45] and the blood come
[1:21:49] together that's where the Eagles get get
[1:21:53] it in the fresh
[1:21:55] kill
[1:21:57] amen he
[1:22:00] says same quote invisible Union your
[1:22:03] garments Washed by the Water of the
[1:22:04] bleeding word the word became blood the
[1:22:06] word bled for you you are washed in
[1:22:08] bleeding
[1:22:09] word the word bleeding the life of God
[1:22:12] in the word and the Word was bled for
[1:22:15] you that you might be washed from the
[1:22:18] filth of these
[1:22:19] prostitutes and cleaned and Sanctified
[1:22:22] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:22:24] and makes your mind and heart stay on
[1:22:27] God and on his word yes amen
[1:22:30] amen I I was subject to those worlds I
[1:22:35] was subject to denomination I was
[1:22:37] subject to all of these things I was in
[1:22:39] it I believed it I had agreement with it
[1:22:41] I participated in the things of the
[1:22:43] world I did all of that and God knew the
[1:22:45] condition I was in but he also knew who
[1:22:47] I was in Prophecy he knew who you were
[1:22:49] in Prophecy and he knew how you came in
[1:22:52] hybridization he knew how darkened your
[1:22:54] mind was and how alienated you were in
[1:22:55] your mind so God came down Amen in the
[1:22:58] seven Church age he came down and and he
[1:23:01] he dwelt he came through a body of Flesh
[1:23:03] of a prophet to begin to bring us the
[1:23:06] word that will wash us Amen to do what
[1:23:09] to bring us back to a virgin condition
[1:23:13] Amen to bring us back to what we were
[1:23:16] when in the day of Pentecost when Christ
[1:23:18] was handed a fresh clean virgin bride
[1:23:20] Untouched by man
[1:23:23] this word this fullness of the word that
[1:23:26] is restored is bringing us back to that
[1:23:30] condition to the faith of the
[1:23:32] Pentecostal fathers right to the Virgin
[1:23:36] condition that the church was once in
[1:23:38] before she was a fallen woman
[1:23:41] amen and God did it himself amen who
[1:23:46] asked for the message to
[1:23:48] come who asked God to send a prophet who
[1:23:52] asked God to fulfill the prophecy in our
[1:23:54] day he did it himself who asked God to
[1:23:58] come down as a son of man as the son of
[1:24:00] man who he did it
[1:24:04] himself who asked God uh to make me part
[1:24:08] of the promise he did it himself who
[1:24:11] asked God to predestinate me he did it
[1:24:13] himself it's all his doing amen so he
[1:24:15] came amen and he gave himself amen that
[1:24:18] he might sanctify and cleanse his bride
[1:24:21] with the washing of water
[1:24:22] of the by the word amen so that he might
[1:24:25] sanctify and purify and present to
[1:24:27] himself a bride without spot or wrinkle
[1:24:29] why because there's a purpose behind it
[1:24:32] all and the purpose is all the way back
[1:24:33] in the original purpose that God had
[1:24:36] given Adam a wife and that was so he
[1:24:38] could reproduce himself upon the earth
[1:24:40] and the same thing taking place in this
[1:24:41] day God came down amen like he did on
[1:24:44] the plains of mammory he did a mighty
[1:24:46] work not so you could say he did a
[1:24:48] mighty work what was he doing he was
[1:24:50] bringing you a word that would cleanse
[1:24:52] you and I and bring us back to our
[1:24:54] virgin condition like we were at the
[1:24:56] beginning so we can meet him and have a
[1:24:59] conception to reproduce Christ upon the
[1:25:02] Earth again that's the point of it all
[1:25:05] amen and so many times we find we get
[1:25:07] hung up in certain places we get hung up
[1:25:09] and God sent a prophet and look at all
[1:25:10] the Miracles that's beautiful but
[1:25:12] there's something else behind it there's
[1:25:15] a mystery in the mystery amen we get
[1:25:17] excited about the restoration of the
[1:25:19] gifts we get excited about the Miracles
[1:25:21] and we get excited about the the the
[1:25:22] truths being connected back together and
[1:25:25] the correct teaching that all beautiful
[1:25:27] we should get excited about all of it
[1:25:29] but don't stop there don't stop till
[1:25:31] there's a conception in your soul and
[1:25:34] Christ Is Made Alive in you and I that's
[1:25:37] the purpose from the beginning that was
[1:25:39] thed by the devil in every Church age
[1:25:41] that's what the devil has stopped amen
[1:25:43] but in this one it's not going to be
[1:25:45] stopped because God has determined amen
[1:25:47] that he's going to fulfill his promise
[1:25:49] in this day Hallelujah this is the time
[1:25:52] there's a place do you know where the
[1:25:54] place is can you say by faith this is
[1:25:57] the
[1:25:58] place this is where he's going to
[1:26:00] fulfill his promise this is why because
[1:26:03] Something's Happened to me that I cannot
[1:26:05] explain to you but something inside of
[1:26:07] me says the promise is for
[1:26:10] me he's changed me deep on the
[1:26:13] inside outside I still have problems I
[1:26:17] still have hybrid flesh I still make
[1:26:19] mistakes I still sometimes view things
[1:26:21] the wrong way way misunderstand stuff
[1:26:24] but the change didn't take place on the
[1:26:25] outside the change took place in a
[1:26:27] private meeting deep in my soul and
[1:26:30] something deep inside is
[1:26:36] changed yes brought back to a virgin
[1:26:41] condition so that this could be the
[1:26:44] place to fulfill the
[1:26:49] promise oh praise God yes
[1:26:55] thousands of years people wanted to hear
[1:26:58] this kind of
[1:26:59] preaching thousands of years they wanted
[1:27:03] to know how will God do it how will he
[1:27:06] wrap it up how will he perform his word
[1:27:08] amen think of the the hundreds of
[1:27:13] years the thousands of years the priests
[1:27:17] and the Levites would look at Genesis
[1:27:19] 3:15 and say I wonder how yeah I wonder
[1:27:23] what that'll look like I wonder where
[1:27:25] it'll be then Isaiah 7 comes along and a
[1:27:29] virgin C conce can you imagine the
[1:27:31] priest and and and all the saints
[1:27:33] they're wondering how will this be I I
[1:27:35] don't understand and then when God does
[1:27:38] it there's only a few that can receive
[1:27:40] it but look at the blessing upon the few
[1:27:43] that could receive it
[1:27:45] Hallelujah and for thousands of years
[1:27:47] we've wondered how God's going to
[1:27:49] restore Eden how is this going to come
[1:27:51] to pass how will that promised seed come
[1:27:53] forth and Friends he let us see it
[1:27:57] hallelujah we're seeing it we're
[1:27:59] witnessing it we're participants in it
[1:28:01] we're part of it by his grace we're part
[1:28:04] of
[1:28:05] it amen I don't know that we can
[1:28:08] reverence it enough I don't know that we
[1:28:09] can talk about it enough I don't know
[1:28:11] that we can preach it enough I don't
[1:28:12] know that we understand it enough I I
[1:28:14] don't know we got to give our whole
[1:28:16] lives our whole beings and everything we
[1:28:18] are to this Revelation this is the point
[1:28:21] this is the time
[1:28:22] Amen in the place you know the prophet
[1:28:25] said God had one plan one purpose one
[1:28:29] goal one thing he wanted to achieve and
[1:28:31] all the characters in the Bible have
[1:28:32] been typing it and showing it and all
[1:28:34] the Bible is showing this one plan and
[1:28:36] that plan has three parts to it the
[1:28:39] first thing that unfolds is God wants
[1:28:40] preeminence in a man because he lost it
[1:28:42] in Adam so now he's going to get it in
[1:28:44] another son and he did that in Christ
[1:28:46] Jesus and the second is to get
[1:28:47] preeminence in the people he's doing
[1:28:49] that
[1:28:50] now right
[1:28:52] now now is the second fold of the
[1:28:55] three-fold plan the hidden Mystery that
[1:28:57] was in God the Eternal purpose that he
[1:28:59] purposed the reason he wrote a Bible the
[1:29:01] reason he did everything the second part
[1:29:03] is unfolding
[1:29:04] now the great desire he had above all
[1:29:07] other desires is unfolding now amen oh
[1:29:11] there's no way we get it like we should
[1:29:13] get
[1:29:14] it but I want
[1:29:16] to I want it to be more of a reality
[1:29:19] this is the Revelation that changes our
[1:29:21] life this is the re you talk about
[1:29:23] changing conduct amen you could preach
[1:29:25] all kinds of you shouldn't wear this and
[1:29:26] you shouldn't do this and you shouldn't
[1:29:28] do this and this and that and you can
[1:29:29] tie together with scriptures and you use
[1:29:31] all kinds of quotes but I'm telling you
[1:29:33] the thing that'll change you is when you
[1:29:35] realize I'm part of this Revelation
[1:29:37] it'll change every desire in your
[1:29:41] body even when you do wrong you didn't
[1:29:44] want to and you hate that you did and
[1:29:45] you change it quickly because your
[1:29:48] desires are changed by the washing of
[1:29:50] the water of the word bringing you back
[1:29:52] cleansing you from all the prostitute
[1:29:54] spirits and The Prostitute condition and
[1:29:55] bringing you back to
[1:30:01] Virgin praise
[1:30:04] God there
[1:30:08] was there was a
[1:30:10] problem All Through the Bible of
[1:30:15] barrenness if you watch God's
[1:30:18] seed there was
[1:30:20] barrenness
[1:30:23] men Sarah was
[1:30:26] Barren it took God to fix
[1:30:30] it Rebecca was
[1:30:33] Barren it took God to fix
[1:30:36] it you realize these are women who are
[1:30:39] in the lineage of Christ these are women
[1:30:41] who are part of the prophecy these are
[1:30:43] the women who the word has to come
[1:30:46] through no options it's got to come from
[1:30:49] Sarah nobody else it's got to come from
[1:30:53] Isaac's wife no one
[1:30:56] else you understand Sarah could not
[1:31:00] produce Isaac but God came down
[1:31:03] yes Rebecca could not
[1:31:05] produce Jacob but God came on the scene
[1:31:09] Rachel could not produce Joseph but God
[1:31:11] showed up
[1:31:13] amen here I
[1:31:16] am even I was I was writing down a few
[1:31:19] of them even manoah's wife Samson's
[1:31:21] mother mother was
[1:31:23] Barren you know what every one of these
[1:31:26] women produced a Christ type amen a
[1:31:30] foreshadow of
[1:31:31] Christ a promise of God coming on the
[1:31:35] scene and none of them could do it in
[1:31:38] their own
[1:31:40] strength you read through the Bible and
[1:31:42] the Bible says Rejoice thou Baron amen
[1:31:47] Rejoice that baren and those that bear
[1:31:49] not amen Rejoice praise God because many
[1:31:52] are the seed amen many are the seed of
[1:31:56] the unrighteous amen more so than the
[1:31:58] right why because God's only looking for
[1:32:00] what he wants to produce in your life
[1:32:02] amen you can look and and so there's the
[1:32:04] unrighteous there's the bond women out
[1:32:06] there there's all these denominations
[1:32:07] they can outwork US 10 to one you talk
[1:32:09] about good deeds and loving your
[1:32:11] neighbor and feeding the poor and
[1:32:12] sending out Bibles I mean you look at
[1:32:14] they can produce produce produce produce
[1:32:16] but God doesn't want that production he
[1:32:19] wants his seed amen he wants his word
[1:32:22] coming to manifestation that's the seed
[1:32:24] he's looking for I believe God I believe
[1:32:28] God protected the lineage by
[1:32:32] barrenness so that they couldn't just do
[1:32:34] what they wanted produce what they
[1:32:35] wanted they had no ability until God was
[1:32:38] ready to fulfill his word then God would
[1:32:39] come on the scene heal the barren womb
[1:32:41] and let them bring forth the promised
[1:32:43] seed you think why can't I do these
[1:32:45] Mighty works why can't I do this why
[1:32:47] can't we do what this church does why
[1:32:48] can't we do I mean these people don't
[1:32:50] even believe the word they teach Trinity
[1:32:51] Arian Doctrine what look at all that
[1:32:53] they can accomplish God doesn't want all
[1:32:55] of that he wants one thing he wants
[1:32:57] himself reproduced on the
[1:33:02] earth Rejoice Baron
[1:33:06] Hallelujah and say I only want to bring
[1:33:08] forth one thing out of the womb of my
[1:33:10] heart I only want to bring Christ that's
[1:33:12] the only thing not my ideas not my works
[1:33:14] not what I think we should do there's
[1:33:16] only one thing that I want to come out
[1:33:17] of my life and that is Christ the true
[1:33:20] seed the for this
[1:33:23] day
[1:33:26] amen Hannah couldn't
[1:33:30] produce but when God came on the scene
[1:33:32] she had
[1:33:33] Samuel a type of
[1:33:36] Christ go to the New Testament Elizabeth
[1:33:38] couldn't
[1:33:41] produce but then she had John the
[1:33:43] Baptist the word
[1:33:46] fulfilled in her
[1:33:50] day I don't want to just do a bunch of
[1:33:53] things produce a bunch of
[1:33:56] works I want to be a vessel that lays
[1:34:00] still and
[1:34:02] quiet and open and surrendered for God
[1:34:05] to come on the scene and manifest
[1:34:08] himself when he wants where he wants the
[1:34:12] way he
[1:34:16] wants think of the mockery that all
[1:34:19] these women went
[1:34:20] through
[1:34:22] you think of the shame that they
[1:34:25] bore and little did they know when they
[1:34:28] were bearing shame and they were weeping
[1:34:30] and they were grieving because they
[1:34:32] couldn't they couldn't bring forth what
[1:34:34] they desired to bring forth they
[1:34:35] couldn't manifest they couldn't
[1:34:40] manufacture the looks that they got the
[1:34:42] things they had to cont we read about it
[1:34:43] in the Bible Hannah was
[1:34:45] vexed by her husband's other
[1:34:48] wife Rachel was vexed by Leah's ability
[1:34:51] ility to
[1:34:55] produce but oh praise God they were
[1:34:59] being reserved amen they were being
[1:35:01] protected they were being saved to bring
[1:35:05] forth the word amen and the word
[1:35:09] only I thank God that's what I want to
[1:35:13] be saved for reserved for it's for the
[1:35:16] word and the word
[1:35:20] only in the
[1:35:22] in the message we come to a
[1:35:25] place where brother brandham starts to
[1:35:29] explain to us the third pool and then he
[1:35:31] gets to a place at the end of 1963 where
[1:35:35] he starts to teach about a manifestation
[1:35:37] of the third
[1:35:39] pool and uh he talks about this quite a
[1:35:42] bit at the
[1:35:43] end but he's he's referring he begins to
[1:35:46] refer back to a time that he was hunting
[1:35:49] in Indiana while he was hunting the Lord
[1:35:52] came to him and spoke to him and said uh
[1:35:56] you know speak and it'll be given to you
[1:35:58] you know something like that I don't
[1:35:59] remember exactly what was said but God
[1:36:01] comes to him and encourages him to speak
[1:36:02] the word and he says what should I say
[1:36:04] and he says well you're hunting you need
[1:36:09] squirrels and and you can speak so
[1:36:11] brother man begins to speak the spoken
[1:36:14] word and as he speaks squirrels appear
[1:36:18] one here one there then he gets
[1:36:20] satisfied when he shoot the squirrel and
[1:36:22] he goes to pick it up and he goes to
[1:36:24] leave and the angel of the Lord says but
[1:36:26] I thought you said three or however many
[1:36:30] what and we see the squirrels and that
[1:36:32] happens twice it happens once in
[1:36:33] Kentucky too once in Indiana and once in
[1:36:36] Kentucky then the third time we see this
[1:36:40] manifestation of the spoken word a third
[1:36:42] pool
[1:36:42] manifestation is when he's in brother
[1:36:45] Wright's house and and he's telling the
[1:36:47] stories of the squirrels being created
[1:36:49] and hady Wright says that's nothing but
[1:36:51] the truth and all of a sudden the spirit
[1:36:52] of God came in and brother B stood to
[1:36:54] his feet said say whatever you want
[1:36:56] it'll be given to
[1:36:58] you and she said I want the salvation of
[1:37:00] my two boys he said I give them to you
[1:37:01] in the name of the
[1:37:03] Lord It's third time then he comes to
[1:37:06] the the fall of 1963 and he has the
[1:37:09] experience in Colorado we all know up on
[1:37:11] the mountain when he's hunting and the
[1:37:13] blizzard begins to move in they were
[1:37:14] warned about it for days and it's coming
[1:37:16] in and he warns everybody to get back to
[1:37:18] Camp as soon as you see anything any pre
[1:37:21] expectation it begins the rain and sleep
[1:37:24] and snow starts to fly and he begins to
[1:37:26] head back to camp and a voice tells him
[1:37:28] go back where you were and he tells he
[1:37:30] tells in the message he says I was going
[1:37:32] back to sudden death it was death to go
[1:37:34] back into that storm but he goes back
[1:37:36] and obeys The Voice then God tells him
[1:37:38] to speak to the storm and he speaks to
[1:37:41] the storm and it does exactly what he
[1:37:43] says clouds roll back sun come out and
[1:37:45] shine until we're done hunting and all
[1:37:47] of that then he begins to walk and as
[1:37:50] he's walking the the Sun comes out and
[1:37:52] things are drying up and and and he has
[1:37:55] all these experiences now he has
[1:37:56] experienc where the Lord says why don't
[1:37:58] you walk with me and he says Lord I
[1:38:00] would love
[1:38:02] to he he looks at his hands he says I
[1:38:05] looked at my hands in in my thoughts in
[1:38:08] every way I was turned a young man again
[1:38:11] then I saw my wife standing in front of
[1:38:13] me and she was young and
[1:38:15] blackheaded then he had the encounter
[1:38:17] with the deer that would approach and
[1:38:19] wouldn't leave and then he says I give
[1:38:20] you your life and and they walk he said
[1:38:22] go off to the woods Mama take your
[1:38:24] babies and go I give you your life and
[1:38:26] they wouldn't leave they kept coming
[1:38:27] back and you see this whole experience
[1:38:30] now in these first four experiences he
[1:38:34] you see there's
[1:38:36] creation he says not even like when
[1:38:38] Jesus was on earth when he took bread
[1:38:40] and broke bread and more was created he
[1:38:42] said this was from nothing not taking
[1:38:45] something what kind of creation was that
[1:38:47] it was the same kind of creation we find
[1:38:49] in Hebrews chap 11 where the things that
[1:38:51] are made were made of things that do not
[1:38:53] appear this was God's kind of
[1:38:58] creation so we see twice creation third
[1:39:01] time is the spoken word the third pool
[1:39:04] for
[1:39:07] salvation the fourth time we see
[1:39:11] temporarily brother brenaman stepped
[1:39:13] into an Eden condition here's a redeemed
[1:39:16] Son of God with the power to control
[1:39:19] nature he says in the Lord walking with
[1:39:21] him that's restored Fellowship because
[1:39:23] God would come in the cool of the
[1:39:24] evening and walk and he says won't you
[1:39:25] walk with me so there's a fellowship a
[1:39:27] walking with the Lord he said we were
[1:39:28] walking through Virgin Timber never
[1:39:30] touched by man
[1:39:32] amen he was young his wife was young
[1:39:35] amen the the animals wouldn't leave his
[1:39:37] presence all of this shows that
[1:39:39] temporarily it stepped into an Eden
[1:39:41] condition to show us what Redemption is
[1:39:46] amen see all of that but then when we
[1:39:48] come to the fifth I've always listen to
[1:39:51] this but all of a sudden several months
[1:39:54] ago when I was meditating on it just hit
[1:39:55] me with
[1:39:58] impact the fifth was a tumor in his
[1:40:01] wife's
[1:40:03] womb it was a tumor that had grown and
[1:40:07] begin to cause her problems causing her
[1:40:09] a lot of physical problems and I began
[1:40:11] to think what is a tumor a tumor is
[1:40:14] another life yes there was another life
[1:40:18] growing in her womb a foreign life a
[1:40:21] foreign substance and it was growing and
[1:40:23] and it was threatening her health and
[1:40:25] threatening her life and it just kept
[1:40:27] growing there and and I asked then I
[1:40:29] started meditating on how did it get
[1:40:31] there well brother benam had picked up
[1:40:33] that it was there the potential was
[1:40:34] laying there years before but when did
[1:40:36] it come to life and when did it start
[1:40:37] growing it's when she disrespected her
[1:40:41] husband remember she was upset she was
[1:40:43] flustered she went and slammed the door
[1:40:46] in brother bram's face and locked the
[1:40:47] door and wouldn't open it for him she
[1:40:49] disrespected her husband and brother B
[1:40:51] went out to wash the car and remember
[1:40:52] he's praying for her and saying God
[1:40:53] forgive her she didn't mean that and
[1:40:55] brother B gives God gives him a
[1:40:56] scripture and tells him to go back in
[1:40:58] and gives her the scripture and tells
[1:40:59] her he said God didn't like that when
[1:41:01] you did that you shouldn't have done
[1:41:04] that and when she disrespected her
[1:41:07] husband who was a
[1:41:10] prophet all of a sudden this thing began
[1:41:12] to grow in her
[1:41:14] womb and it began to be more
[1:41:16] uncomfortable and it began to affect
[1:41:18] more of her life in a negative way to so
[1:41:20] much so they're debating on having
[1:41:22] surgery what should we do we're praying
[1:41:23] and praying and praying asking God what
[1:41:25] to do and should we have surgery should
[1:41:27] we delay surgery the doctors worried
[1:41:29] about it becoming malignant and all
[1:41:31] these other things that brother Ben's
[1:41:32] going through in this
[1:41:34] trial you know it's a hard
[1:41:37] trial but here he comes in November I
[1:41:40] believe it is of
[1:41:42] 63 and he's by himself in his house and
[1:41:46] all the fam's back West and he's back
[1:41:49] east in his home Jeffersonville he's
[1:41:51] praying he's lonely he's missing his
[1:41:53] family and all of a
[1:41:56] sudden he begins to pray for his wife
[1:41:58] and he begins to intercede for his
[1:42:02] wife see the one who she
[1:42:06] disrespected is the one who's standing
[1:42:08] in the gap for
[1:42:10] her and if you think about it we've
[1:42:13] disrespected
[1:42:15] Christ the whole church systems the
[1:42:17] whole world has disrespected Christ
[1:42:21] who is our Prophet who's the son of man
[1:42:25] we disrespected Christ and what happened
[1:42:29] to us something in the womb was growing
[1:42:33] a foreign
[1:42:35] life see the The Prophet's whole life
[1:42:39] symbolizes
[1:42:40] something I don't understand it all
[1:42:42] there's so many details in his life and
[1:42:44] so many things but I believe it all has
[1:42:46] purpose and it all has meaning cuz
[1:42:48] brother benam said a prophet's very life
[1:42:51] becomes the word to the people becomes a
[1:42:52] sign to the
[1:42:53] people so here his wife under the
[1:42:57] disrespect has a foreign life growing in
[1:43:00] her wound and it's threatening her life
[1:43:01] and affecting her life in a negative way
[1:43:04] and it's a hindrance and here her
[1:43:06] husband who she's offended is the one
[1:43:07] standing in the Gap and playing the role
[1:43:09] of the intercessory high priest saying
[1:43:12] Lord forgive her she's done all these
[1:43:14] things she didn't mean that she was
[1:43:16] under pressure she doesn't say a word
[1:43:18] she irons my shirt she packs my back
[1:43:20] what's he doing standing in the Gap he's
[1:43:22] the intercessor he's The Advocate amen
[1:43:25] he's playing the part of
[1:43:28] Christ and then while he's praying God
[1:43:30] says stand on your feet he stands up and
[1:43:33] he says whatever you say that's the way
[1:43:35] it'll be and brother benam says before
[1:43:37] they ever lay a hand on her the doctor
[1:43:39] ever lays a hand on her it'll be gone
[1:43:41] and that is exactly the way it happened
[1:43:43] she went to the examination that morning
[1:43:45] she got up on the table it hurt her so
[1:43:46] bad she couldn't hardly get on the table
[1:43:48] she had to have help it hurt to have a
[1:43:49] sheet touch it but but as the doctor
[1:43:51] went walking over she got a cool feeling
[1:43:53] over her body and by the time his hands
[1:43:55] touched her there was nothing there and
[1:43:56] the doctor did the examination checked
[1:43:58] the x-rays and he said that sister
[1:44:01] sister already he says ma uh your your I
[1:44:04] think he says Mrs brandham your tumor is
[1:44:10] gone I think that's more than just a
[1:44:15] story what removed the foreign life the
[1:44:19] foreign substance that was growing in
[1:44:20] the what healed his wife's womb it was
[1:44:23] the spoken word it was the spoken word
[1:44:27] amen and it was what is the spoken word
[1:44:29] brother brandom calls it the third pool
[1:44:31] amen when he tie he ties all five of
[1:44:34] these manifestations to the third pool
[1:44:36] amen because when the word came back to
[1:44:37] his hand The Sword in his hand it was
[1:44:39] the third pool the opening of the word
[1:44:41] the word back in a man's hand and God
[1:44:43] gave him permission each one of these
[1:44:45] times to speak the word as if he was God
[1:44:48] and God honored it as if it was coming
[1:44:49] from God
[1:44:51] and so now in the fifth time that you
[1:44:54] see the manifestation of the spoken word
[1:44:56] the third pool manifestation the fifth
[1:44:58] one is Grace Grace
[1:45:02] Grace
[1:45:03] amen what did she deserve she deserved
[1:45:06] what she got amen she disrespected her
[1:45:08] husband what did she get instead she got
[1:45:10] Grace when her husband would stand in
[1:45:12] the Gap and play the role of intercessor
[1:45:14] but at the appointed time what was going
[1:45:16] to remove the tumor what was going to
[1:45:18] remove the life and cleanse and heal her
[1:45:20] womb what was going to do it it was
[1:45:22] going to be the third pool spoken word
[1:45:25] when that came on the scene she was
[1:45:27] instantly
[1:45:28] healed amen and what have we received in
[1:45:30] this day it's the third pull this is the
[1:45:32] spoken word this is the word of the Lord
[1:45:35] and what's the spoken word supposed to
[1:45:36] do to you and I it's supposed to heal
[1:45:39] the
[1:45:40] womb take out the life take out the
[1:45:43] foreign life the foreign son whatever
[1:45:45] was choking our life and hindering our
[1:45:47] life and affecting our life God is here
[1:45:49] under the power of this this word to
[1:45:51] cleanse us from all the prostitutes to
[1:45:53] push out every other life form every
[1:45:55] idea of man and the masses that were
[1:45:57] growing inside of our spiritual wound
[1:45:59] that was hindering us it's been removed
[1:46:01] by the spoken
[1:46:03] word oh it's more than a story to me
[1:46:06] this has become a reality to
[1:46:10] me this is the power of the spoken
[1:46:16] word oh praise
[1:46:18] God he says it back again in spoken word

[1:46:49] to remove other life it has the power to
[1:46:52] heal the wound so that we can conceive
[1:46:54] it has the power to bring us in contact
[1:46:56] with the Living God so that we have
[1:46:57] faith strength by through faith to
[1:46:59] conceive on this word to do what to
[1:47:02] reproduce the son of man
[1:47:05] again amen that's why anytime we begin
[1:47:08] to downplay the word and downplay the
[1:47:10] Revelation and downplay the seals and
[1:47:12] downplay the Thunders to me a warning
[1:47:13] Bell goes off cuz it's this third pull

[1:47:47] healing of your spiritual wound where

[1:48:12] its
[1:48:14] fullness we don't water it down we don't
[1:48:16] trivialize it we don't dissect it we
[1:48:19] just preach it amen this is what he
[1:48:22] brought to us and this is the purpose he
[1:48:24] brought it
[1:48:27] for brother man again in spoken word he
[1:48:30] says oh people God bless you hear me I
[1:48:33] can't believe nothing but God's word I

[1:48:36] am I want you to do the same let your
[1:48:39] walks your talks your moves everything

[1:48:43] the mind of Christ come into you and
[1:48:45] that'll pregnate you with the word let
[1:48:48] what let this mind be in you which was
[1:48:50] also Al in Christ we've been hearing
[1:48:51] about it amen we heard about it on
[1:48:52] Wednesday what is it going to do it the
[1:48:55] that'll pregnate you with the
[1:48:58] word if you don't if you don't let the
[1:49:00] mind if you let the mind of denomination
[1:49:03] come in you'll be denominational
[1:49:04] pregnated if you let the mind of Christ
[1:49:06] come into you you can't deny his own
[1:49:08] word cuz he's God you be pregnated with
[1:49:12] the word and believe it I don't care if

[1:49:25] pregnated with his own seed word in her
[1:49:28] wound Spirit wound in her
[1:49:32] mind and won't mix with any
[1:49:34] denominational trash with it she is
[1:49:36] Virgin to him amen what's he doing oh I
[1:49:41] just want to refer back to what I said a
[1:49:43] few minutes
[1:49:44] ago we can get hung up anywhere in this
[1:49:48] great drama that's unfolding
[1:49:52] hung up in first pole second pull hung
[1:49:54] up in Miracles and signs and wonders
[1:49:56] hung up in the ministry of a prophet
[1:49:58] hung up we can get hung up in the truth
[1:50:01] restored the loose ends tied back
[1:50:02] together in correct
[1:50:04] Doctrine and none of those things are
[1:50:06] wrong we should spend a lot of time in
[1:50:08] all of that but all of those things are
[1:50:11] supposed to produce something in this
[1:50:16] day it's supposed to bring a conception
[1:50:20] of the word in the spiritual womb of our
[1:50:23] mind and our heart to do what to
[1:50:26] reproduce Christ on the
[1:50:29] Earthen if we fail if that fails in this
[1:50:34] day then the prophecy has
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:39] fail to stop along the way is not the
[1:50:43] point the point is to go all the way to
[1:50:47] the
[1:50:49] promise
[1:50:53] God by his grace by the washing of the
[1:50:56] water of the word has brought us back to
[1:50:59] be a fresh bride like we were at
[1:51:01] Pentecost like Sarah was fresh and young
[1:51:06] again but that wasn't enough right she
[1:51:10] had to get something from God himself to
[1:51:14] her
[1:51:14] personally that would give her through
[1:51:17] faith strength to
[1:51:18] conceive
[1:51:20] we've seen the Miracles we've seen the
[1:51:23] prophets Ministry we've heard the tapes
[1:51:24] we we've seen the truth restored we've
[1:51:27] seen all of that and we've seen uh
[1:51:30] ourselves even brought back out of
[1:51:32] denomination cleansed and but we need
[1:51:35] something else am we need this word that
[1:51:39] we hear this word that cleanses this
[1:51:41] word that purifies we need this word to
[1:51:43] come to life inside of
[1:51:45] us and to manifest out of us the son son
[1:51:50] of man
[1:51:51] again remember improving his word we I
[1:51:54] read it here many many times and I'm
[1:51:56] going to take time to read the lengthy
[1:51:58] version but just I'm going to take a
[1:52:01] snippet out of it said the son of man
[1:52:03] will come down and come in human flesh
[1:52:06] to unite the two
[1:52:11] together it's the son of man Christ
[1:52:13] Jesus come down in human flesh Among Us
[1:52:17] and will make his word so real that
[1:52:20] it'll unite the church in him as one the
[1:52:23] bride then she'll go home to the
[1:52:25] marriage supper she's already united we
[1:52:28] go to the wedding this is uniting time
[1:52:31] and signs amen this is the invisible
[1:52:34] Union this is all of that it's supposed
[1:52:36] to be taking place
[1:52:38] now then he goes on to
[1:52:42] say and then what does it do then this
[1:52:48] is what I'm trying to emphasize
[1:52:51] there the the he'll come down in human
[1:52:53] fles and make the word so real that
[1:52:55] it'll literally unite the two together
[1:52:56] they're United then what does it do
[1:53:00] then the marriage was supposed to
[1:53:03] produce
[1:53:04] something when God made the woman and
[1:53:07] brought her out of the man out of Adam
[1:53:09] and he brought them back together there
[1:53:11] was a purpose in that act and it wasn't
[1:53:14] so you can say look there was one now
[1:53:15] there's two no it was so there would be
[1:53:17] three four five six seven so that they
[1:53:19] would repr
[1:53:21] produce so they would reproduce another
[1:53:23] Son of God on the earth God has come
[1:53:26] down and there's not a doubt in our mind
[1:53:28] that God has come down in human flesh
[1:53:29] and made the word so
[1:53:31] real that it'll unite the Bride In
[1:53:34] Christ again and then what it'll do
[1:53:36] that's the part that I'm emphasizing
[1:53:38] that's the part that has got me totally
[1:53:40] consumed then what will it do it
[1:53:42] manifests the son of man again amen what
[1:53:46] Eve failed to do amen what the first
[1:53:48] church failed to do what Israel failed
[1:53:49] to do we you and I are commissioned
[1:53:51] we're part of the prophecy this is the
[1:53:53] day and he's got the power and he's come
[1:53:56] on the scene and he is making it come to
[1:53:58] pass but that's what has to come to pass
[1:54:01] amen amen that he has to
[1:54:04] reproduce the son of man
[1:54:07] again not the church theologians the son
[1:54:11] of man the word and the church becomes
[1:54:13] one whatever the son of man done he was
[1:54:16] the word the church does the same thing
[1:54:21] says in Christ is the mystery God
[1:54:23] revealed it's not a group it's a
[1:54:24] personal Vindication of a pregnated
[1:54:27] child of God filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:54:29] so surrendered to God that he don't care
[1:54:31] about nothing else and the Holy Spirit
[1:54:33] living its life pulsating through him
[1:54:35] showing the personal Vindication of the
[1:54:37] word itself expressing itself to the
[1:54:39] people and the
[1:54:41] world same message the pregnated person
[1:54:43] with the seed of God the word in there
[1:54:46] manifesting itself amen it's not just to
[1:54:50] receive the word if you'll just if if
[1:54:53] you'll allow me just to use a natural
[1:54:55] type and just follow with me the adults
[1:54:57] are here will
[1:54:59] understand
[1:55:01] Sarah received
[1:55:03] seed is that right she received seed and
[1:55:07] she received seed and she received seed
[1:55:09] and she received
[1:55:11] seed but there was no
[1:55:14] conception there was no reproduction of
[1:55:16] a
[1:55:18] life
[1:55:22] when she was made young again and they
[1:55:24] went down to Gar there's no doubt in my
[1:55:26] mind that she once again receive
[1:55:29] seed is that right right yes but there
[1:55:33] was still no
[1:55:34] conception that was going to take an
[1:55:37] invisible Union between her and God
[1:55:39] hallelujah that was going to take a
[1:55:41] visitation from God to her personally
[1:55:43] and give her the faith to recognize her
[1:55:46] part in the prophecy and give her
[1:55:47] through faith strength her herself to
[1:55:50] conceive seed and then she produced The
[1:55:54] Promised
[1:55:55] son we can sit in church and receive
[1:55:58] seed and receive seed and receive
[1:56:01] seed and listen I just just take me as
[1:56:04] your
[1:56:05] brother it can even be
[1:56:09] pleasurable and
[1:56:12] enjoyable but without a
[1:56:16] conception we can get excited about we
[1:56:19] can enjoy en Joy it it can be a
[1:56:20] pleasurable experience to receive
[1:56:23] seed but without conception the promise
[1:56:26] still hasn't come in the
[1:56:30] manifestation we need to conceive on
[1:56:33] this word amen and it's going to take a
[1:56:37] total surrender to God and it's going to
[1:56:39] take God coming to us personally
[1:56:43] amen and how will the conception take
[1:56:45] place just like it did for Sarah through
[1:56:47] faith amen we'll be sitting here
[1:56:51] receiving seed like always before but
[1:56:53] all of a sudden something will
[1:56:55] change all of the sudden it'll be like
[1:56:57] just another Sunday but all of a sudden
[1:56:59] ping something inside connects with it
[1:57:02] in a different
[1:57:03] way and all of a sudden it begins to
[1:57:05] change everything begins to change and
[1:57:07] now I'm not trying to not do this and
[1:57:09] I'm not trying to not do this and I'm
[1:57:11] not trying to be this and all of a
[1:57:13] sudden there's another life inside and
[1:57:14] it's not like I'm trying to not say that
[1:57:16] and trying not to go here and trying to
[1:57:18] not look there all of a sudden this life
[1:57:20] takes over my life and it starts to
[1:57:22] produce
[1:57:25] itself that's the conception we need on
[1:57:27] this
[1:57:30] word and marriage and divorce he says
[1:57:32] and so is it with the church that
[1:57:34] refuses to become pregnated in the age
[1:57:36] that we now live in to bring forth
[1:57:38] children of this age we are not
[1:57:39] lutherans we are not wesle neither are
[1:57:41] we Pentecostals we got to be the
[1:57:43] children of this age through the
[1:57:45] pregnancy of the word of God to bring
[1:57:47] forth a child of this age the seed
[1:57:50] child he was on to saying the bride will
[1:57:53] be a lovely little lady of the word
[1:57:54] unadulterated not touched by any man's
[1:57:56] organization any man-made Theory she'll
[1:57:59] be purely
[1:58:00] unadulterated Bride of the word amen I
[1:58:04] hope you get that out there on the air
[1:58:06] she will be the pregnated daughter of
[1:58:08] God what will the bride be not just the
[1:58:12] one who hears the bride will be the
[1:58:14] pregnated daughter of God there's got to
[1:58:16] be a pregnation amen
[1:58:19] amen
[1:58:21] amen this is what this is what is so
[1:58:25] meaningful in first Colossians to me
[1:58:28] when brother Benham goes to Christ as
[1:58:29] the mystery of God revealed he's going
[1:58:31] to begin preaching the seven seal the
[1:58:32] great mystery that was not unfolded and
[1:58:34] he goes to his opening scripture in
[1:58:36] Colossians chapter 1 and he begins to
[1:58:38] labor on this verse this great mystery
[1:58:41] which was
[1:58:43] hid even the mystery which had been hid
[1:58:46] from ages and from Generations but now
[1:58:49] is made manifest to the Saints to whom
[1:58:51] God would make known what is the riches
[1:58:52] of the glory of this mystery among the
[1:58:54] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[1:58:59] of
[1:59:00] glory remember the Apostle Paul when he
[1:59:02] began this whole
[1:59:04] journey all at the beginning when he was
[1:59:06] trying to found the church on the
[1:59:08] word he says he says I'm
[1:59:12] travailing
[1:59:14] again till Christ be formed in you what
[1:59:17] was Paul's the purpose of Paul's
[1:59:19] Ministry to have Christ formed in them
[1:59:22] but they took another
[1:59:24] seed but when we come to the Fulfillment
[1:59:27] of all Paul was longing for amen what is
[1:59:29] it now amen travailing till Christ be
[1:59:32] formed in
[1:59:34] you Christ in you the hope of glory a
[1:59:39] pregnated child of
[1:59:42] God and choosing of a bride he says we
[1:59:44] find today that the modern Church a
[1:59:46] modern World Church the modern world
[1:59:49] Church church and also that the
[1:59:50] spiritual church are both pregnated to
[1:59:52] give birth to Sons one of them a
[1:59:54] denominational birth is going to be
[1:59:57] going to give one day to these to these
[2:00:00] days at the World Council of churches
[2:00:02] will produce to the world the Antichrist
[2:00:04] through a denomination that's exactly
