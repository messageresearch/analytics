[10:12] the Lord
[10:18] amen let's bow our heads together
[10:22] dear Lord Jesus we love you so much and
[10:26] Lord we counted the privilege to be
[10:27] gathered together again and we know it's
[10:29] your mercy in your grace that's working
[10:32] in our lives to bring us back to this
[10:34] time
[10:35] I pray God lord as we turn our hearts
[10:38] Focus completely on your word I pray
[10:40] that you would feed us by your hand
[10:43] nor that you would take your word and
[10:45] shape us Lord and to the very image you
[10:47] want of us in this hour you'd cut away
[10:50] all that's unnecessary in all of the
[10:52] world
[10:53] Lord and leaving behind what you have
[10:55] ordained for this hour pray it should
[10:58] work in us use these lips of clay to
[11:00] speak your words Minister through US
[11:03] Lord and help us to receive your word in
[11:05] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[11:09] amen while you're standing if you mind
[11:11] taking your Bibles and turn to the Book
[11:13] of Joshua
[11:14] Joshua chapter 24
[11:18] and while you're turning I want to let
[11:21] you know that this Saturday will be
[11:22] opening the church again for prayer time
[11:24] and be open from 3 P.M to 10 p.m as
[11:27] usual and intend to continue to do that
[11:29] on the regular schedule
[11:32] and let's look here at Joshua 24 and
[11:36] begin reading at verse 14.
[11:41] Joshua 24 and 14. now therefore fear the
[11:45] lord and serve him in sincerity and
[11:48] truth and put away the gods which your
[11:50] father served on the other side of the
[11:52] flood and in Egypt and served the Lord
[11:54] and if it seemed evil unto you to serve
[11:57] the Lord choose you this day whom you
[11:59] will serve whether the gods which your
[12:02] father served that were on the other
[12:03] side of the flood or the gods of the
[12:05] amorites and whose lands you dwell but
[12:08] as for me and my house we will serve the
[12:10] Lord amen God bless you as you take your
[12:13] seeds
[12:15] you can see here that Joshua is speaking
[12:17] to the children of Israel he is giving
[12:20] them the opportunity to make a choice
[12:22] and he's telling him to choose you this
[12:24] day whom you will serve you have options
[12:26] he's saying you can choose the the gods
[12:28] your father served on the other side of
[12:30] the flood you can choose the gods of the
[12:32] amarites and whose lands you go into he
[12:34] says but as for me and my house we will
[12:37] serve the Lord
[12:39] amen and uh brother man tells us that
[12:42] God has a law of choosing and he talks
[12:44] about free moral agency and tonight I
[12:47] just want to talk for a little bit about
[12:48] the responsibility of free will
[12:51] amen we talk about the I want to talk
[12:53] about responsibility of free will when I
[12:56] was meditating on this and thinking
[12:58] about it we talk about Free Will and
[13:00] brother random talks so much about free
[13:02] will free choice free moral agency they
[13:05] all tied together amen and it's a it's a
[13:08] wonderful thing he said God put man
[13:10] equal to him
[13:12] when he gave him free choice
[13:15] and and it it's a it I don't know it
[13:19] seems like a wonderful thing but the
[13:21] more I meditate on it I wonder how
[13:23] wonderful it is I almost wish God would
[13:25] take away my free choice
[13:28] and just I I would prefer that God
[13:31] didn't leave it up to me to choose that
[13:33] he would just choose for me and that I
[13:35] would do everything just he would come
[13:37] down and do it for me but God has set
[13:39] this life up in certain way that he
[13:42] wants to prove all things and everything
[13:44] must be proved and everything must be
[13:46] demonstrated Faith must be demonstrated
[13:48] and the thing that overcomes the world
[13:50] is Faith so God had to set the world in
[13:53] such a way that Faith could rise to the
[13:55] occasion and can prove who is seed and
[13:58] who is not and so God had to allow this
[14:02] operation of free will or free choice or
[14:04] free moral agency but with that comes a
[14:07] tremendous amount of responsibility
[14:10] if God was going to put us on an equal
[14:12] basis with him amen then then it means
[14:15] we we operate as minor gods in a way
[14:18] because we can make choices amen
[14:21] and so uh it comes with a a heavy
[14:24] responsibility here Joshua's he's
[14:27] demonstrating this law of choice that
[14:29] God has made brother Benham says you
[14:31] don't have to serve God if you don't
[14:33] want to
[14:34] you don't have to serve God if you don't
[14:37] want to amen if you don't want to if you
[14:39] don't want to follow his statutes you
[14:41] don't have to he doesn't Force anybody
[14:44] if we're going to serve God we're going
[14:45] to serve God because we choose to
[14:47] because we have a heart to and we know
[14:49] that behind all of that is the sea Gene
[14:51] of God that God has planted something in
[14:53] the soul amen that's a part of himself
[14:55] that will respond to the word we know
[14:57] what we know all of that and I'm I'm
[15:00] just wanting to get down to the
[15:01] operation of Free Will for today so we
[15:04] know that if we ever choose God it's him
[15:06] choosing us and drawing us it wasn't us
[15:08] of ourselves amen
[15:10] but God still has this structure in this
[15:14] life a free choice
[15:16] and and so many things in life we don't
[15:20] get instructions in the mail
[15:23] and I would absolutely love instructions
[15:27] in the mail I'd love to go to the
[15:28] mailbox every Monday and pull out my
[15:30] instructions for that week and these are
[15:32] the decisions that you make and these
[15:33] are the choices that you make and this
[15:35] is what I want you to do Monday Tuesday
[15:36] Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and
[15:38] Sunday and that would be so wonderful
[15:41] amen because I would want with all my
[15:43] heart to do what he he told me to do but
[15:46] actually God has has structured this
[15:48] world and this and this natural life
[15:50] that we live in such a way that he wants
[15:53] us to get an education
[15:57] amen you know well I'm just going to
[16:00] read this quote here and then we'll go
[16:02] into that and the message of prisoner he
[16:04] says now we're all born a free moral
[16:06] agent to make any decision that we wish
[16:08] to
[16:09] God justly does that because he must put
[16:11] every man on the same basis or he put
[16:13] the wrong man he put the first man on
[16:15] the wrong basis that he put on free
[16:17] moral agency see we're just exactly
[16:20] tonight like Adam and Eve there's no
[16:22] difference right and wrong sets before
[16:24] either one of us life and death we can
[16:26] make our choice up to you to make it
[16:29] that's the way Adam and Eve did and see
[16:32] and they made the wrong choice and now
[16:34] by that put the whole race of human race
[16:36] under death and the penalty of death and
[16:39] then God came down in the form of man
[16:40] and took that death and paid the penalty
[16:42] of death his subjects that desired to to
[16:45] be free could go free now if he took us
[16:48] without the same way that he did Adam
[16:50] and Eve and just pulled us through
[16:52] something said I'll save you whether you
[16:53] want saved or not then he put Adam and
[16:56] Eve on the wrong basis you see but each
[16:58] one of us has to choose this day between
[17:01] death and life
[17:03] God did this for a purpose he set man
[17:06] and with free moral Agency for a purpose
[17:08] then we know that God Amen he he
[17:11] initially said man in the Garden of Eden
[17:14] with free more Legacy to make his own
[17:16] choice because God knew that they would
[17:18] fall
[17:19] but he couldn't make them fall but he
[17:22] gave them the ability to make their own
[17:23] choice amen because God knew in his mind
[17:26] that they would fall because he had
[17:29] attributes within himself that must be
[17:31] displayed
[17:32] and those attributes could not be
[17:34] displayed and they're the attribute of
[17:37] savor could not be displayed unless
[17:38] something was lost it needed to be saved
[17:40] attribute of healer could not be
[17:42] displayed unless something was sick and
[17:44] when someone was sick and needed to be
[17:46] healed unless someone needed to be
[17:48] redeemed he couldn't be a redeemer amen
[17:50] so he he is all of these things so he
[17:53] wants amen he allows the circumstances
[17:56] to be such that man can choose because
[17:58] God cannot make him fall and be just
[18:02] God cannot force him Amen to fall into
[18:06] sin and to leave the world and still be
[18:08] considered a just God Amen so what he
[18:11] does in his Justice is he allows man to
[18:13] choose for himself amen knowing that the
[18:16] circumstances will get such a way that
[18:18] the man will make the wrong choice but
[18:20] it puts the attributes of God into
[18:22] action to display themselves and now man
[18:26] learns something about God
[18:29] now we can experience God as a savior
[18:32] now we can experience God as a Healer
[18:34] now we can experience the mercy and
[18:37] grace of God to forgive us of our sins
[18:39] and wash us from unrighteous
[18:42] [Music]
[18:43] so you see God didn't just leave the
[18:46] free moral agency in place so that Adam
[18:50] and the woman could fall and make their
[18:52] mistake and so he could go into action
[18:54] amen and then he would take it away and
[18:56] now each one of us have to come like
[18:58] robots no he left this he left the law
[19:01] of free choice in place because free
[19:04] choice is part of our education
[19:07] we come to this life amen to learn about
[19:10] God to know God to understand things
[19:13] that we could not understand in a
[19:15] perfect environment so this is our
[19:17] school we're in school now here we're
[19:19] gaining character for reigning in the
[19:21] future so here we're learning and we're
[19:23] growing and increasing in character and
[19:25] in knowledge and an understanding and
[19:28] part of that process is going to require
[19:30] a law of free choice to be in place so
[19:33] that we can make some wrong choices in
[19:35] life and have to repent and recognize
[19:38] God as our savior our healer our
[19:41] deliverer the merciful god who has
[19:43] forgiven me of my sins the gracious God
[19:45] who has forgiven me
[19:49] and so God left the free choice because
[19:52] it works into his his plan for his
[19:57] children to know him
[19:59] not to be like the angels in heaven who
[20:02] worship him but don't know what it means
[20:05] to be saved
[20:07] they don't they never lost they don't
[20:08] know what it means to be saved they were
[20:10] never sick they don't know what it means
[20:11] to be healed amen they were never they
[20:13] never were in need of redemption they
[20:15] didn't need God to forgive them amen
[20:17] they were the angels that were held and
[20:19] kept in Perfection and so God allows
[20:22] this Free Will free choice in order for
[20:25] his his attributes to to be displayed
[20:28] not just through the world but to us
[20:33] and also in the in the education
[20:36] that we're here
[20:39] if we look at the education that the the
[20:42] all of God's children have received
[20:44] through the Bible
[20:45] it all kept pointing back to one thing
[20:49] that his word is the only way
[20:53] he would give his word and his children
[20:56] would always choose another way
[20:58] he would give his word and and they
[21:00] would choose to go back into idolatry
[21:03] give us word and they would forsake the
[21:05] word they would make their choices
[21:07] Joshua is saying this day you have a
[21:10] choice and they're all saying we choose
[21:12] the Lord we will serve the Lord amen he
[21:14] declared what for his household they
[21:15] would do they all made the same way but
[21:17] just a few Generations later they were
[21:19] serving the gods of the people that they
[21:21] were supposed to conquer and drive out
[21:24] they made their choice to go backwards
[21:26] amen and so but that set up another
[21:29] cycle of falling of apostasy and failure
[21:32] and judgment and Redemption and
[21:35] restoration and then it would cycle
[21:36] again and every time they were learning
[21:39] to take the word and keep the word Above
[21:42] All Else
[21:44] that nothing but the word works and what
[21:46] was making this lesson what was grinding
[21:48] the lesson in it was free choice
[21:51] because they could choose to do wrong
[21:54] and because they did choose to do wrong
[21:56] would start a whole nother cycle and at
[21:58] the end of that cycle there would be
[22:00] children of God standing there saying we
[22:02] want nothing but the word because
[22:04] nothing but the word will work
[22:08] and in our life we have a we have free
[22:12] choice and many of us have been through
[22:14] some Cycles
[22:17] we've been through Cycles because of our
[22:19] choices
[22:21] amen but at the end of the cycle there's
[22:23] one thing that always comes to the front
[22:25] nothing but the word will work amen I
[22:28] want nothing but the word in my life I I
[22:31] don't want my own will I don't want my
[22:33] own desire but my deepest desire is to
[22:36] please him and my deepest desire is to
[22:38] keep his word
[22:39] yeah
[22:40] because this cycle is an education that
[22:44] is teaching me nothing else will work
[22:49] brother Branham says in the choosing of
[22:51] a bride said there's another choice that
[22:54] we have in life that's a life's
[22:55] companion a young man or young woman
[22:57] stepping out on life has been given a
[22:59] right to make a choice
[23:01] the young man chooses the young woman
[23:03] has a right to accept or reject it but
[23:06] it's still a choice on both sides
[23:08] both men and women they have a right to
[23:11] to a choice also you have a choice as a
[23:14] Christian you have a choice of the
[23:16] church here in America so far that you
[23:18] could go to that's your own American
[23:19] privilege to choose any church that you
[23:21] want to belong to that's a choice you
[23:24] don't have to go to any of them if you
[23:25] don't want to but if you want to change
[23:27] from Methodist to Baptist or Catholic to
[23:29] Protestant or so forth there's nobody
[23:31] can tell you or make you to make you
[23:34] come to any certain church that's our
[23:36] freedom that's what our democracy is
[23:37] every man can choose for himself freedom
[23:40] of religion is a great thing God help us
[23:42] to keep it as long as we can
[23:43] you have also a choice you can choose
[23:46] this church you can choose whether in
[23:48] this church whether you will choose a
[23:49] church that will guide you to your
[23:50] Eternal destination you can choose a
[23:52] church that has a certain Creed that you
[23:54] might think that Creed is just what you
[23:56] want or other church as another Creed
[23:58] and then there is the word of God you
[23:59] have a choice of you have to make the
[24:01] choice there's an unwritten law Among Us
[24:04] of choosing
[24:06] brother remember goes through so many
[24:07] things you have a right to choose your
[24:09] wife or you have the you know the woman
[24:11] has a right to choose whether she'll
[24:13] accept the offer of a man or not the
[24:15] right to which church you want to go to
[24:16] which Doctrine you want to believe what
[24:19] job you want to work amen where you want
[24:21] to live there's all these choices that
[24:24] have been God has been given to us to
[24:26] make and we can make these choices amen
[24:28] but but all of these choices have
[24:31] consequences
[24:33] every one of these choices has
[24:35] consequences brother Branham said you
[24:37] better pray boy before you get married
[24:40] he says because you could ruin your
[24:42] whole life
[24:44] same thing with the girl you better pray
[24:46] amen and let God give you spiritual
[24:48] Insight because you can ruin your whole
[24:51] life but it's the same is true for which
[24:53] church you attend it's the same thing
[24:55] it's true for ever what you accept to
[24:57] choose to believe same thing is true for
[24:59] where you live and and what job you have
[25:02] and all of these things we better pray
[25:04] because these choices have consequences
[25:08] amen
[25:10] and God has given us the ability to
[25:14] choose
[25:15] we can we can choose and that choice
[25:19] will have an outcome
[25:23] that's why I titled this the
[25:24] responsibility of free will
[25:28] because we have to recognize the
[25:30] responsibility
[25:32] let's turn to Isaiah 65 just for I want
[25:35] to catch a quick verse here
[25:40] Isaiah 65
[25:56] Isaiah 65 and verse 12.
[26:01] therefore will I number you to the sword
[26:04] and you shall all bow down to the
[26:06] slaughter
[26:07] because when I called you did not answer
[26:09] and when I spake you did not hear but
[26:12] did evil before in mine eyes and did
[26:14] choose that wherein I delighted not
[26:19] now he's telling the sword is coming I'm
[26:21] numbering you to the sword destruction
[26:22] is coming
[26:24] because when I spake you didn't hear
[26:26] when I called you didn't come
[26:28] and you chose the thing that I delighted
[26:30] not in
[26:32] and now you know now Israel can be
[26:36] coming under the falling under the sword
[26:38] being numbered to The Sword whatever
[26:40] kind of Destruction that would be and
[26:43] they would have no right to cry out God
[26:45] why are you letting this happen to us
[26:48] because he already told them why it was
[26:50] happening to them because they didn't
[26:52] heed the call they didn't listen when he
[26:55] spoke and they chose that which he
[26:57] didn't Delight in
[27:00] and their choice brought about their
[27:02] destruction it wasn't God it was them
[27:06] [Music]
[27:07] I mean they couldn't cry out in the day
[27:09] of Calamity oh God why are you doing
[27:12] this to me no it's it's oh God forgive
[27:15] me for doing this to myself
[27:19] that's the problem with our culture and
[27:22] that's the problem with the America that
[27:24] we live in
[27:25] is everybody wants to blame somebody
[27:28] else
[27:29] everybody wants somebody else to be
[27:32] responsible or take responsibility for
[27:35] their actions nobody wants to take
[27:37] responsibility for their own actions
[27:40] amen
[27:44] Amen brother bam says in the marriage of
[27:46] the Lamb he says so many say if the Lord
[27:48] will take this evil spirit from me from
[27:50] drinking or from gambling or from lying
[27:52] or stealing I'll serve him but that's up
[27:55] to you see you've got to do something
[27:57] too they that overcome shall inherit all
[28:00] things they did overcome you have power
[28:02] to do it but you must be willing to lay
[28:05] it down
[28:06] amen it says she she has made herself
[28:08] ready I like that word you see God could
[28:11] not push us through a little pie pull us
[28:13] out the other end and then say blessed
[28:14] is he that overcometh you had nothing to
[28:16] overcome he just pushed you through but
[28:19] you've got to make decisions for
[28:21] yourself
[28:23] I have to make decisions for myself in
[28:25] doing that we show our faith and
[28:27] respects to God
[28:29] I just I I love this because brother
[28:33] random now is taking the responsibility
[28:35] and putting it back on us
[28:39] because we want so many times to cry out
[28:43] to God God why are you letting this
[28:45] happen to me
[28:47] and many times if we'll just reflect on
[28:50] what's going on in our lives we will
[28:52] recognize this is happening because of
[28:54] our own choices
[28:57] because of our own choices
[29:00] and we want somebody else
[29:02] we want somebody else to blame and many
[29:04] times the way we pray demonstrates that
[29:07] we're accusing God
[29:10] God why is this happening why why are
[29:13] you letting this happen and then when we
[29:15] do recognize that it's our wrong choices
[29:18] then we say things like God why didn't
[29:20] you stop me
[29:23] because we know that God is powerful and
[29:26] that God could stop us we've we've seen
[29:28] him stop people before amen we saw him
[29:31] stop brother Branham before he drank and
[29:33] before he smoked and God stopped him
[29:35] amen
[29:36] and we see God stop some of the
[29:38] Patriarchs and things that they were
[29:39] going to do but God didn't always stop
[29:41] them amen sometimes he let them go amen
[29:44] it depend on whether or not like for
[29:46] brother Branham he needed that vessel to
[29:49] stay clean and pure because he had a
[29:51] work for him to do that would benefit
[29:53] the entire bride
[29:55] but it doesn't mean he didn't let
[29:57] brother Manna make decisions and make
[29:58] mistakes he made decisions and he made
[30:00] mistakes and we'll look at that here in
[30:02] a minute it wasn't that he always
[30:04] stopped him but when he stopped him he
[30:06] stopped him for our benefit
[30:09] same thing down through the life of the
[30:11] Patriarchs amen when God injects himself
[30:14] and stops somebody he does it for the
[30:16] benefit of the greater good for all of
[30:18] us but there are times amen that we must
[30:21] make our choice so that we can learn the
[30:23] lesson that only choosing the word will
[30:26] work
[30:29] amen
[30:31] and there's consequences
[30:34] for our choices
[30:37] we we have and we suffer many times as
[30:40] consequences but those consequences are
[30:42] tremendous lessons
[30:44] to keep us from making the same Choice
[30:46] again
[30:48] David he made a decision one day to take
[30:52] another man's wife
[30:54] it was not something that was forced
[30:56] upon him that was him exercising his
[30:58] free will
[31:00] and then exercising his free will he had
[31:02] an innocent man killed he took another
[31:04] man's wife amen and when Nathan the
[31:07] prophet came and exposed it there was
[31:09] consequences for his action and he said
[31:12] the sword shall never depart from thy
[31:14] household
[31:15] and David repented and said God has also
[31:18] forgiven you amen but there's still a
[31:21] sword that was in his household two of
[31:22] one of his sons killed another one of
[31:24] his sons one of his sons raped one of
[31:26] his daughters I mean there was
[31:28] tremendous amount of trouble what was
[31:30] the consequence it was the consequences
[31:31] of David's free choice
[31:35] amen and when David was exposed by
[31:37] Nathan David never said anything silly
[31:40] like God why didn't you stop me
[31:43] or he never said God it was her fault
[31:46] she didn't cover herself
[31:48] brother Branham said she didn't she knew
[31:51] where the king took his walk and she
[31:52] didn't pull the shade
[31:56] but he's willing to take responsibility
[31:58] for himself and say I have sinned
[32:02] amen and God forgave him of his sin but
[32:05] there was still consequences
[32:07] and the consequences remain there
[32:10] everything in life has consequences good
[32:13] and bad
[32:15] and we have to we have to uh to me this
[32:19] is where I'm at it's better just to own
[32:21] it from day one and try to excuse it
[32:23] away
[32:24] it's so much better just to come to
[32:26] terms with this that I am responsible
[32:29] for my own actions
[32:32] amen
[32:33] I mean it's like if I speed and I get a
[32:37] ticket
[32:38] what right do I have to be angry
[32:42] ask brother Shea how many people get mad
[32:44] at him because he gives him a ticket
[32:46] and is mad and
[32:51] ain't what did the police officer do he
[32:53] didn't push the gas pedal
[32:55] he wasn't the one in control you were
[32:58] the one in control amen I worked with a
[33:00] man one time he got super angry with me
[33:03] because he got caught drinking while he
[33:05] was canoeing on the Little Miami River
[33:07] and the Little Miami River is supposed
[33:08] to be alcohol free amen and and he was
[33:11] he was drinking beer and and he come
[33:13] into work and he was just ranting and
[33:15] raving about the park ranger the park
[33:18] ranger was parked on a bridge and he was
[33:20] using binoculars to find me and they're
[33:23] not allowed to do that amen they're not
[33:26] and he's going to go to court and fight
[33:28] it
[33:30] and I just asked him I asked him two
[33:32] questions
[33:33] I said were you drinking he said yes
[33:36] I said did you know you weren't supposed
[33:37] to drink he said yes
[33:45] that seemed silly but that's the way
[33:47] people live
[33:49] and that's the way we have lived
[33:52] we make choices amen and the
[33:54] consequences come around and then we get
[33:56] angry about the consequences and we get
[33:58] upset about the circumstances and things
[34:01] that are happening amen when we
[34:03] recognize we should be recognizing this
[34:05] is my fault amen this is happening
[34:07] because of me
[34:09] amen
[34:11] amen I I just wrote down a few examples
[34:14] because it's so simple and it's in
[34:16] everyday life that we need to come to
[34:18] terms with this amen I I went a little
[34:21] while ago because I noticed I was having
[34:22] trouble hearing and uh I went for an uh
[34:26] audio test or whatever and I found out
[34:29] that I have a little bit of hearing loss
[34:31] especially in my left ear and when I
[34:34] when I found out the lady started asking
[34:37] me questions he was doing the test she
[34:38] goes have you ever worked in a loud
[34:39] environment I said yes she goes did you
[34:41] wear hearing protection I said no
[34:45] and they looked at it and they said this
[34:46] is classic typical uh high frequency
[34:50] hearing loss by damage that happened
[34:54] earlier from noisy environments said his
[34:57] textbook
[34:59] and I said you know what
[35:01] I could get angry that I'm struggling to
[35:04] hear
[35:05] I could get mad
[35:08] but the reality is I knew when I had
[35:10] that job that there was extremely loud
[35:14] noises and I knew that I should get
[35:15] hearing protection but most of the time
[35:17] my hearing protection was out in the
[35:19] truck and it was a long walk out to the
[35:20] truck and back
[35:24] yeah
[35:26] and I took my chances because I was
[35:29] young
[35:31] and because I stuck my head in that
[35:32] cabinet dozens of times and I didn't
[35:34] come out deaf I started to assume there
[35:37] was no consequences for my actions
[35:42] and here I am 20 years after that that
[35:45] employment and I'm struggling with some
[35:48] hearing loss and and now I'm recognizing
[35:51] it's nobody's fault but my own
[35:54] it's my own fault and and you could say
[35:57] God why did you let this happen to me
[35:59] but the problem is I knew that there was
[36:03] consequences and I knew what the
[36:04] potential was and God has Set This World
[36:07] up for us to learn
[36:09] and he is not going to take away all the
[36:12] consequences amen because it defeats his
[36:15] whole purpose
[36:17] so we sometimes think as child of
[36:19] children of God that we are so
[36:21] privileged that this law won't work for
[36:23] us but I'm telling you it works better
[36:24] for us than anybody else
[36:27] yes
[36:28] amen we we we
[36:31] do all kinds of silly things I remember
[36:34] being on vacation with the family amen
[36:36] and I remember them all laughing at me
[36:38] because I would soak myself in sunscreen
[36:43] they thought it was funny ha ha ha look
[36:46] at that he's afraid of the Sun Well when
[36:49] you're bald-headed
[36:52] if you've suffered the consequences once
[36:55] you don't ever want to do it again but
[36:57] lo and behold that night everybody
[36:59] turned up sunburned now who's laughing
[37:01] and whose fault is it amen
[37:05] somebody made an offer it's here it's
[37:09] available there's a whole tube put it on
[37:11] Amen we're out in the sun no it feels so
[37:14] good
[37:17] but you see that is life
[37:20] and it has to be that way
[37:23] it needs to be that way it's for our
[37:27] benefit and we laugh about the sunscreen
[37:29] but that's a minor example but there's
[37:31] major things in life that happen the
[37:34] exact same way
[37:36] I mean there's there's consequences amen
[37:38] you get in relationships with people
[37:40] you're not being in relationships as
[37:42] boys and girls amen and you you as a
[37:45] young lady lose your virginity you will
[37:47] never get it back no matter how much a
[37:49] child of God you are you'll never erase
[37:51] that Mark in your life
[37:53] amen doesn't mean you're not a child of
[37:55] God doesn't mean you won't be forgiven
[37:57] but there'll be consequences for the
[37:58] action and it will never be erased
[38:01] God will forgive you he can even go on
[38:04] to bless you you can have a blessing you
[38:06] can have a family you can have all kinds
[38:07] of these things but there's still never
[38:09] the consequences never go away because
[38:11] you carry that in your conscience and in
[38:13] your heart the rest of your life amen
[38:15] but but God has given a protection for
[38:18] that already and he's delivered it amen
[38:20] in his word amen and all we have to do
[38:22] is listen to him and make the right
[38:25] choice amen and then we won't suffer the
[38:27] consequences
[38:29] so if it's if it's sunscreen hearing
[38:32] protection whatever
[38:35] it all works the same way
[38:40] and we we it would do us good
[38:44] to stop pretending that we're not in
[38:47] this
[38:48] uh in this law free choice
[38:52] and it puts the responsibility on us
[38:57] so when the when now we've been we've
[39:00] been put on an equal basis to God
[39:03] now the responsibility has been put on
[39:05] you and I
[39:06] what choice will we make
[39:08] where would we go what will we do
[39:11] it's it seems so simple
[39:14] but it
[39:15] it's so true
[39:19] man let's look at uh
[39:22] let's look at Genesis 13.
[39:25] I want to go to this story
[39:46] foreign
[39:48] and verse 5.
[39:52] in lot also which went with Abram had
[39:55] flocks and herds and Tents and the land
[39:57] was not able to Bear them that they
[39:59] might dwell together for their substance
[40:01] was great so that they could not dwell
[40:03] together and there was Strife between
[40:05] the Herdman Abraham's cattle and the
[40:06] Herdman of lots cattle and the Canaanite
[40:09] and the parasite dwelt then in the land
[40:11] and Abram said unto lot let there be no
[40:13] Strife I pray thee between me and thee
[40:16] in between my herdmen and thy herdmen
[40:18] for we be Brethren is not the whole land
[40:20] before thee separate thyself I pray thee
[40:23] from me if thou will take the left hand
[40:25] then I will go to the right or if thou
[40:28] depart to the right hand then I will go
[40:30] to the left
[40:31] so now Lord has given a choice
[40:33] it's his choice
[40:35] his free choice you choose the way you
[40:38] want to go Abraham's not going to
[40:40] influence his choice but whichever way
[40:41] you go I'll go the other way and give
[40:43] you room
[40:45] verse 10 and lot lifted up his eyes and
[40:47] beheld all the plain of Jordan that it
[40:50] was well watered everywhere before the
[40:52] Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even
[40:54] as the garden of the Lord like the land
[40:56] of Egypt as thou comest and desire then
[40:59] law chose him all the plain of Jordan
[41:01] and Lot journeyed East and they
[41:03] separated themselves the one from the
[41:05] other
[41:05] Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan and
[41:08] lot dwelled in the cities of the plain
[41:09] and pitched his tent towards Sodom but
[41:12] the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners
[41:14] before the Lord exceedingly
[41:17] we all know the story and we know the
[41:19] conclusion to the story
[41:21] but lot made a choice and lot made a
[41:24] choice amen based off
[41:28] pleasantness pleasure easier living
[41:32] brother Benham said Abraham stayed up in
[41:34] the Rocky ground
[41:36] block went down to the well-watered
[41:38] valley
[41:39] but the well-watered valley had sin
[41:43] the well water Valley had Sodom and he
[41:45] pitched his tent towards Sodom amen and
[41:48] he did not do that Amen to be trapped
[41:51] inside him he didn't do it be part of
[41:53] the wickedness of the city amen he made
[41:55] that choice because he could have a
[41:57] better life
[42:00] how many people have made choices for a
[42:03] better life than they've suffered
[42:05] spiritually because of it
[42:07] choices for a better job for a career
[42:09] for a a job that takes them away from
[42:12] fellowship a job that moves them to a
[42:14] place with no no Fellowship no church
[42:15] whatever reason people choose things
[42:18] amen for a better life amen and I I
[42:21] would venture to say lot did not end up
[42:23] with a better life
[42:25] but Abraham have stayed separated and
[42:28] took the rocky ground he wound up with a
[42:30] better life
[42:32] we'll continue in the story in chapter
[42:34] 19.
[42:38] 19 and verse 12.
[42:44] Genesis 19 and 12.
[42:47] and the men
[42:48] said unto lot hast thou hear any besides
[42:51] it's the two angels that have come to
[42:52] rescue him they say unto him having any
[42:55] here besides son-in-law and thy sons and
[42:57] thy daughters and whatsoever thou Hast
[42:59] in the city bring them out of this place
[43:01] for we will destroy this place because
[43:03] the Cry of them is waxing great before
[43:05] the face of the Lord and the Lord has
[43:07] sent us to destroy him and lot went out
[43:10] and speak unto his sons-in-law which
[43:12] married his daughters and said up get
[43:14] you out of this place for the Lord will
[43:16] destroy the city but he seemed as one
[43:18] that mocked unto his sons-in-law
[43:21] and when the morning arose when the
[43:23] angel hasten lot saying arise take thy
[43:26] wife and thy two daughters which are
[43:27] here lest I be consumed in the iniquity
[43:30] of the city and while he lingered the
[43:32] men laid hold upon his hand and upon the
[43:34] hand of his wife and upon the hand of
[43:35] his two daughters and the Lord being
[43:37] merciful unto him and they brought him
[43:39] forth and set him without the city
[43:42] and it came to pass when they had
[43:44] brought them forth abroad that he said
[43:45] Escape for thy life look not behind thee
[43:48] neither stay thou in all the plane
[43:50] escape to the mountain lest thou be
[43:53] consumed
[43:54] and I skipped down to verse 26.
[43:58] but his wife looked back from behind him
[44:00] and she became a pillar of salt
[44:04] so we see that lot's Choice had
[44:07] consequences
[44:09] the consequences of Lot's choice is he
[44:13] wasn't just pitched towards Sodom but it
[44:15] wasn't much long after until he was in
[44:18] Sodom
[44:19] and his daughters were now married and
[44:23] they had husbands and and who knows
[44:25] where the husbands came from but you can
[44:27] assume that they came from Sodom around
[44:29] about that area and now his daughters
[44:32] are married there and then he goes to
[44:34] try to rescue his family at the bidding
[44:36] of the of the Angels amen and his
[44:39] sons-in-laws looked at him as one that
[44:40] mocked wouldn't listen to him he lost
[44:42] his daughters and Sodom
[44:44] he lost his wife because his wife's
[44:47] heart was in Sodom and even though she
[44:49] was brought out she turned back amen
[44:51] look at all that lot loss when lot made
[44:54] a choice for a better life
[44:58] I'm telling you
[45:00] Lima may not be the most prosperous Pace
[45:02] on Earth it may not be the most
[45:04] beautiful place on Earth but there's
[45:06] fellowship with Believers here amen
[45:08] there's people who hold to the word of
[45:10] God that will encourage us in our walk
[45:12] amen that will preach the word of faith
[45:14] that will stay true to the message and
[45:16] encourage us that way amen I don't want
[45:18] a better job somewhere else amen I'd
[45:21] rather take a lesser job and stay in the
[45:24] place of God than choose a better life
[45:26] and lose my family
[45:27] everything
[45:29] I mean there's other places that are
[45:31] more prosperous there's other places
[45:33] that are more beautiful amen and and we
[45:35] all know that and many of you have moved
[45:37] from some of those places to this place
[45:39] and God bless you amen you chose the
[45:42] rocky ground but but we choose for the
[45:44] word's sake not for pleasure not for
[45:47] personal growth amen not for the our
[45:49] plans in life but we choose for the word
[45:51] we choose careers that way we choose
[45:53] workplaces that way we choose friends we
[45:56] choose spouses we choose all of these
[45:58] things because
[46:00] we put the word first
[46:04] because our our choices have
[46:07] consequences
[46:09] where we live
[46:10] will have consequences
[46:13] where we raise our children in the
[46:16] environment we raise them in will bear
[46:18] consequences
[46:21] where where we choose to make our place
[46:24] of employment and and and what all that
[46:27] entails
[46:30] will have consequences
[46:33] and so and then when the consequences
[46:36] come
[46:37] what right does lot have to get mad
[46:41] what right does lot have to shake his
[46:44] fist at God or to say God why didn't you
[46:46] stop me from going to Sodom
[46:49] and and I mean the reason I can say that
[46:52] so boldly is because I've prayed
[46:54] something like that in the past
[46:56] God you could have stopped me why did
[46:58] you let me do this amen but God has an
[47:01] unwritten law of choosing amen and he's
[47:04] not going to take it away because it
[47:06] works so well to the lesson that we have
[47:09] to learn is that my way will always end
[47:12] in destruction there's only one way and
[47:14] that's his way
[47:16] and so now whatever free choice he's
[47:19] given me I will exercise that to go his
[47:22] way
[47:24] amen
[47:26] brother Venom you said this about Samson
[47:29] he said Samson got into Bad Company and
[47:31] you always can remember that when you're
[47:33] in Bad Company you're out of the will of
[47:35] the Lord
[47:36] my other my own Southern mammal used to
[47:38] tell me if you lay down with a dog
[47:40] that's got fleas you're going to get up
[47:41] with fleas
[47:43] that's rather a rude expression but it's
[47:46] got a lot of common everyday sense to it
[47:49] you just can't associate yourself with
[47:51] the things of the world and expect to
[47:53] stay spiritual and humble before God
[47:57] you can't lay out a fellowship
[48:00] all the time and expect to stay
[48:02] spiritually strong
[48:05] you can't feed on the things of the
[48:07] world every day and expect to stay
[48:09] spiritually strong
[48:11] I mean these these things are not laws I
[48:14] mean there's a this is no legalism to it
[48:16] it's the it's just it may be rude but
[48:18] it's everyday common sense
[48:20] [Music]
[48:23] I mean just like you you can't eat junk
[48:26] food every day and expect to stay fit
[48:28] and look like a bodybuilder
[48:30] it's not going to work
[48:32] this is good old everyday common sense I
[48:35] mean this is basic understanding this is
[48:37] the way the world works this is the way
[48:39] we live in this life
[48:44] so we need we need to own it and
[48:46] understand it and be conscious about the
[48:49] choices we make and not so flip it
[48:51] sometimes and not giving heed but really
[48:53] pay attention to the choices that we're
[48:55] making and say why am I making this
[48:57] choice and why are the potential
[48:59] consequences of this choice
[49:01] amen it matters friends
[49:04] it matters I was meditating on this
[49:06] service and thinking God why in the
[49:08] world am I preaching this service and I
[49:10] just come to the conclusion that there's
[49:12] somebody right now at a point that needs
[49:14] to hear this
[49:15] I don't know who maybe several maybe one
[49:17] I don't know but the point is we've got
[49:20] choices to make and we're going to Bear
[49:22] the responsibility for the choice and
[49:24] every choice will have a consequence
[49:27] every choice
[49:28] how much sleep you get Bears a
[49:30] consequence
[49:31] I mean everything what we eat how much
[49:35] sleep we get where we work what we look
[49:38] at what we listen to it all bears a
[49:40] consequence
[49:42] and God is not going to tell you you
[49:46] can't listen to this radio station but
[49:47] you have to listen if God's not going to
[49:49] come with an audible boy a Audible Voice
[49:52] into your vehicle and say Amen don't
[49:54] turn that one on turn this one on no you
[49:57] get to make that choice but you already
[49:59] know what the right choice is
[50:01] you already know
[50:03] you you already know I mean he's not
[50:05] going to tap you on the shoulder amen
[50:07] when you're enjoying some entertainment
[50:09] of the world and say don't choose that
[50:12] you already know you made the choice
[50:15] amen and God will let us
[50:18] and then bear the consequences
[50:22] amen there are so many things that you
[50:25] learn over life you know you learn the
[50:28] hard way
[50:30] so many things that even we in our house
[50:32] we we would allow for a period of time
[50:35] and and then we would start to get bad
[50:37] consequences
[50:39] then you ask yourself why did I ever let
[50:42] that why did I let it in the door why
[50:44] did I allow that and then also you got
[50:46] to go back and clean up your mistake and
[50:48] make other decisions and and then you
[50:50] can start bearing consequences of a
[50:51] better decision but it does no good to
[50:54] get mad at the children
[50:57] right
[50:58] yeah I mean you let them watch little
[51:00] cartoons where every character on the
[51:02] cartoon is sassy and sassing their
[51:04] parents and smart Alec and your kids are
[51:06] sassing you and get smarter like it's
[51:08] not going to do any good to beat the
[51:10] kids amen that was your choice amen you
[51:13] brought it that influence in your house
[51:15] and allowed that to influence your
[51:17] children and then you want to get mad at
[51:19] them for being influenced by what you
[51:21] allowed
[51:23] there comes time when we got to get real
[51:25] and we got to say listen now this is my
[51:28] fault amen but we're not going to do
[51:30] this anymore I'm telling you this is
[51:31] wrong but it's my fault not your fault
[51:33] but from here on we're not going this
[51:35] way anymore and if you choose to go that
[51:37] way from now on now you'll bear the
[51:39] consequences
[51:41] but there Comes A Time To be honest
[51:44] and say this is my fault amen
[51:48] it's not it's not everybody around I
[51:50] mean you can say why do they even allow
[51:52] programming like that
[51:55] how bad has the world got when you can't
[51:58] even watch a
[52:00] what nonsense
[52:03] it's our choice
[52:06] we I mentioned this I don't know
[52:08] remember which service one of the last
[52:10] couple Services where brother Ben says
[52:12] why is this Satan's Eden why has God
[52:16] allowed it he's allowed it to prove that
[52:18] she's not like Eve
[52:20] had free choice she made her choice amen
[52:23] we've got choice but by great God's
[52:26] grace we're going to make different
[52:27] choices
[52:29] we're going to stick with the word so
[52:32] there's no there's no law there's no
[52:35] somebody coming to question you or
[52:37] coming to your house for a house visit
[52:38] and sit down now brother sister have you
[52:40] done this this week or done that have
[52:42] you allowed this in your home and
[52:45] no
[52:46] we bear our own consequences for our own
[52:50] actions
[52:52] amen
[52:54] we don't have to serve God
[52:56] but we can if we want
[52:58] we don't have to choose the word but we
[53:01] can if we want
[53:02] but every choice has a consequence
[53:07] I want to look at a little story in the
[53:09] Bible just real
[53:19] First Kings 22.
[53:37] First Kings 22.
[53:39] and 41.
[53:43] and Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to
[53:45] Reign Over Judah in the fourth year of
[53:47] Ahab king of Israel Jehoshaphat was 30
[53:50] and 5 years old when he began to Reign
[53:52] and he reigned 20 and five years in
[53:54] Jerusalem and his mother's name was
[53:56] azubah the daughter of shilohai and he
[54:00] walked in all the ways of Asa his father
[54:02] he turned not aside from it doing that
[54:04] which was right in the eyes of the Lord
[54:06] nevertheless the high places were not
[54:08] taken away for the people offered and
[54:11] burnt incense yet in the high places and
[54:13] Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of
[54:16] Israel
[54:17] now we know the king of Israel at this
[54:18] time is Ahab so Jehoshaphat made peace
[54:21] with the king of uh Israel which is Ahab
[54:24] and he went up and he entered into a
[54:27] league with Ahab and brother Branham
[54:29] said says so one time Jehoshaphat which
[54:31] was a son of a righteous man and a
[54:34] righteous man himself he came down to
[54:36] see Ahab and there's where he made his
[54:39] fatal mistake
[54:41] see at this time the the kings of Judah
[54:45] were righteous Kings amen and the Kings
[54:47] of Israel were unrighteous there was a
[54:49] split between the 12 tribes ten made the
[54:52] Northern Kingdom of Israel two which was
[54:54] Judah and Benjamin they made the
[54:56] southern tribe of Judah Amen in in the
[54:59] southern tribe of Judah was still in the
[55:01] lineage of David right and so now there
[55:03] was a king over Israel and a king over
[55:05] Judah and now Jehoshaphat was a
[55:07] righteous King over Judah who was
[55:09] serving God but up in ahab's realm and
[55:12] in Israel Ahab had given over to his
[55:15] idolteress wife Jezebel and brought
[55:18] brought mixed religion in an idolatry in
[55:21] and this was a corrupt Nation now
[55:24] and so Jehoshaphat now made peace with
[55:28] Ahab and went into a league and brother
[55:30] Branham said that's where he made his
[55:32] fatal mistake
[55:34] he should have stayed separated it was a
[55:37] choice that Jehoshaphat made but that
[55:39] choice had long reaching circumstances
[55:43] repercussions
[55:47] he says again
[55:49] he says first name Jehoshaphat the
[55:51] righteous man came down to visit Ahab
[55:53] then he got himself in trouble
[55:55] you can't mix right and wrong together
[55:57] and get anything out of it you can't put
[56:00] oil in water it won't mix neither can
[56:02] your Associates and your Affiliates be
[56:04] with the things of the world and still
[56:05] live a Victorious Life the Bible said
[56:07] come out from among them and be separate
[56:09] saith the Lord
[56:11] we have to make choices the king made
[56:14] his choice
[56:16] and so he We Know by reading the
[56:18] scriptures there was several times that
[56:21] he was in ahab's company he would travel
[56:24] up to Israel and he would be in ahab's
[56:26] court
[56:27] right remember when Ahab asked him to go
[56:30] against Syria with him and and they
[56:31] called for all the prophets and they
[56:33] called for Micaiah I mean Jehoshaphat
[56:35] was there in the court he was spending
[56:37] time in ahab's home
[56:40] right and you can't spend time in
[56:44] somebody else's home without that
[56:46] influence coming into your home
[56:49] that's just good old common sense
[56:54] and let's go to Second Kings now chapter
[56:56] eight
[56:57] let's watch this as this progresses
[57:01] second Kings chapter eight
[57:06] verse 16.
[57:10] Second Kings 8 and 16.
[57:12] and in the fifth year of Jerome the son
[57:14] of Ahab king of Israel Jehoshaphat being
[57:17] then king of Judah Jehovah the son of
[57:20] Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to Reign
[57:23] 30 and two years old was he when he
[57:25] began to Reign and he reigned eight
[57:27] years in Jerusalem and he walked in the
[57:30] way of the Kings of Israel now this is
[57:32] the son of Jehoshaphat King now of Judah
[57:35] the righteous Kingdom that served God
[57:37] but now he is walking in the way of
[57:40] Israel
[57:42] as did the house of Ahab for the
[57:44] daughter of Ahab was his wife and he did
[57:47] evil in the sight of the Lord
[57:51] it just took one generation
[57:54] his children
[57:56] he would go up up the ahab's place and
[58:00] go up to ahab's house and and who knows
[58:03] what the intermingling was and the
[58:05] children but somehow jehoshaphat's son
[58:08] was interested in ahab's daughter
[58:11] and now there was a marriage and that
[58:14] marriage began to be the corruption of
[58:17] Judah amen if Jehoshaphat would have
[58:19] stayed separate this would have never
[58:21] happened amen but he went and mingled
[58:23] with what he knew was unbelief what he
[58:25] knew was adultery he should have never
[58:27] went it sounds so nice he made peace it
[58:30] was the wrong kind of Peace because it
[58:32] brought him into compromise and it
[58:34] brought his children and his kingdom
[58:35] into compromise
[58:37] and now he marries his son to ahab's
[58:41] daughter
[58:43] and brother Branham says in the thytime
[58:45] church age now it said here that this
[58:47] had children now what were they
[58:49] they were daughters he's talking about
[58:51] the Catholic church and the Protestants
[58:52] for they were churches just like her now
[58:55] here is very interesting point Jezebel
[58:57] and Ahab had a daughter
[59:00] that daughter married jehovahum the son
[59:02] of Jehoshaphat and in Second Kings 8 16
[59:05] it says Jehovah walked in the way of his
[59:08] father-in-law
[59:09] he went right into adultery by his
[59:12] marriage he brought God fearing and God
[59:14] worshiping Judah into idolatry that is
[59:16] exactly what all these daughter churches
[59:18] have done even as I've pointed out to
[59:20] you they started in the truth in Marion
[59:22] the organization and leave the word for
[59:24] tradition
[59:25] hey brother Ben points right to that
[59:27] story and shows what's happened in the
[59:29] church ages
[59:30] but Ahab and Jezebel had a daughter
[59:34] and that daughter married to Joshua
[59:37] because Jehoshaphat and they have became
[59:38] friends
[59:39] and that daughter married jehoshaphat's
[59:42] son
[59:43] and now that daughter was just like her
[59:46] mother
[59:48] she was raised in that environment
[59:50] and now brings that right down into
[59:53] Judah
[59:56] where did this start
[59:57] jehoshaphat's choice
[1:00:03] let's look at still in second Kings
[1:00:05] chapter eight
[1:00:07] let's turn to verse 25.
[1:00:13] and in the 12th year of Joe room the son
[1:00:15] of Ahab king of Israel did ahaziah the
[1:00:19] son of Jehovah king of Judah begin to
[1:00:21] Reign now Jehovah and the daughter of
[1:00:25] Ahab have a son and that son's name is
[1:00:29] ahaziah so his mother his grandmother is
[1:00:32] Jezebel his mother's the daughter of
[1:00:34] Jezebel
[1:00:36] he said 2 and 20 years old was a ASI
[1:00:39] when he began to Reign and he reigned
[1:00:41] over one year in Jerusalem and his
[1:00:43] mother's name was athaliah the daughter
[1:00:46] of Omri king of Israel
[1:00:48] earlier it said she was ahab's daughter
[1:00:50] Omri is ahab's Dad so they're they're
[1:00:52] under the dynasty of Omri amen just like
[1:00:55] all the kings were sons of David she was
[1:00:57] a daughter of Omri because he was the
[1:00:59] first king in this lineage
[1:01:01] but it was Ahab and Jezebel's daughter
[1:01:04] married to Jehovah produced ahaziah
[1:01:10] now I want to keep following the story
[1:01:11] because it's amazing
[1:01:13] amen let's hold your place in Second
[1:01:15] Kings but let's jump over to Second
[1:01:17] Chronicles
[1:01:18] second chronicles 22 and we're going to
[1:01:21] come right back to Second Kings
[1:01:29] second chronicles 22
[1:01:32] and 3.
[1:01:35] second chronicles 22 verse 2.
[1:01:37] 40 and 2 years old was ahaziah when he
[1:01:40] began to Reign and he reigned one year
[1:01:42] in Jerusalem his mother's name also was
[1:01:45] athaliah the daughter of Omri he also
[1:01:48] walked in the ways of the House of Ahab
[1:01:50] for his mother was his counselor to do
[1:01:53] wickedly
[1:01:55] his mother was Jezebel's daughter
[1:01:59] and she became his counselor to do
[1:02:02] wickedly
[1:02:03] let's go back to Second Kings and go
[1:02:06] over to verse 11. Second Kings 11.
[1:02:18] Second Kings 11 and one this is a super
[1:02:21] interesting story but we're just pulling
[1:02:23] little pieces out
[1:02:24] says and when athaliah the mother of
[1:02:27] ahaziah saw that her son was dead she
[1:02:30] arose and destroyed all the Royal seed
[1:02:33] all the seed Royal
[1:02:35] but jehoshaba the daughter of King joram
[1:02:39] sister of aiziah took joash the son of
[1:02:42] azai and stole him from among the king's
[1:02:44] Sons which were slain and they hid him
[1:02:46] even him and his nurse in the bed
[1:02:49] Chamber from athaliah so that he was not
[1:02:51] slain and he was with her hid in the
[1:02:54] house of the Lord six years and athlete
[1:02:56] did Reign Over All the land
[1:02:59] it is so amazing amen that that brother
[1:03:02] bam shows this so clearly I'm not going
[1:03:04] to read all the quotes but this is the
[1:03:06] Catholic Church having a daughter now
[1:03:08] the daughter amen brings the Protestants
[1:03:10] into denominationalism the same system
[1:03:12] as the mother amen the same system of
[1:03:15] idolatry brings it in and brings a
[1:03:17] corruption about and that's what
[1:03:19] aphaliah is doing at the death of aiziah
[1:03:21] now the woman is going to take the
[1:03:23] throne kill all the Royal seed what
[1:03:25] she's trying to do she's trying to stop
[1:03:27] all the elect in trying to stop all the
[1:03:29] word
[1:03:31] okay
[1:03:32] but there was something hid through six
[1:03:34] ages that was going to come out in the
[1:03:36] seventh age amen and the Word was going
[1:03:38] to be restored in the seventh age
[1:03:39] because Joe Joe Ash was going to become
[1:03:41] King when he was seven years old
[1:03:44] but oh what happened this is a type of
[1:03:47] the churches this is a demonstration of
[1:03:49] another cycle it's showing the fall the
[1:03:52] failure the choice the tying back in
[1:03:54] amen and showing the destruction of the
[1:03:56] elect it's showing everything I mean
[1:03:58] we're we're looking at absolutely the
[1:04:00] church ages here and what caused this to
[1:04:03] come in the scene a righteous man Mixed
[1:04:06] Company where he shouldn't have mixed
[1:04:08] company he made the wrong choice
[1:04:11] and the wrong choice had huge
[1:04:13] consequences because now Judah falls
[1:04:15] into idolatry and now what became the
[1:04:18] destruction of Israel and caused their
[1:04:19] dispersion now becomes the destruction
[1:04:21] of Judah and causes their dispersion
[1:04:25] what was it it was as simple as a choice
[1:04:30] a choice
[1:04:32] what caused the Fallen ruined nation of
[1:04:34] all Humanity a choice
[1:04:37] amen what caused every problem we've
[1:04:40] ever had was a choice
[1:04:43] is there our choice or somebody else's
[1:04:45] choice but it was a choice
[1:04:48] and the choices have affected us but oh
[1:04:51] how many good things have happened in
[1:04:53] the kingdom of God because of a choice
[1:04:56] if it's got the power for such
[1:04:58] destruction it's also got the power for
[1:05:00] such life amen if it's got the power to
[1:05:02] destroy and to tear down and ruin life
[1:05:05] it has the power to give life amen to
[1:05:07] bring a rebuild Amen to redeem it's got
[1:05:10] the same power
[1:05:13] amen I was also meditating on brother
[1:05:15] Brown's life story and I want to just
[1:05:16] bring some quotes from him
[1:05:18] he says he says uh in the message life
[1:05:22] story from 1951
[1:05:25] he's talking about the conversation he
[1:05:27] had with his mother-in-law after he'd
[1:05:29] been to Mishawaka had the experience
[1:05:31] coming in to the Pentecostal people
[1:05:33] preaching there had a list of invites
[1:05:37] all over
[1:05:39] and during the conversation you say well
[1:05:40] I remember when we started off her
[1:05:42] mother said well hope she said you can
[1:05:44] go of course that's sin but I'm telling
[1:05:46] you
[1:05:47] I said if you do your mother will fill a
[1:05:49] grave with a broken heart
[1:05:51] oh my there it was and here's where I
[1:05:54] made my mistake friends
[1:05:56] this is the prophet of God
[1:05:59] The God Who stopped him from drinking
[1:06:03] and smoking didn't stop him from making
[1:06:05] this choice
[1:06:08] why because there was a lesson in it
[1:06:12] that was extremely valuable
[1:06:16] he said here's where I made my mistake
[1:06:17] friends I listened to my mother-in-law
[1:06:19] instead of listening to God and if I
[1:06:21] would have went ahead then this great
[1:06:23] thing would have been manifested before
[1:06:25] this and the church had been further
[1:06:27] along but listen to my mistakes here's
[1:06:30] where sorrow started
[1:06:33] skips down a little bit he says no I
[1:06:35] never forget trouble started
[1:06:37] my father took sick died on my arms just
[1:06:40] a little bit after that my brother was
[1:06:42] riding on the side of a car a 15 year
[1:06:43] old the man that he was hitchhiking and
[1:06:46] picked him up was drinking hit his head
[1:06:47] upside of a post broke his neck turned
[1:06:50] his liver over and he died in my other
[1:06:52] brother's arms
[1:06:53] and I was standing in the platform
[1:06:55] preaching when it happened they come and
[1:06:56] told me I tell you the way of a
[1:06:59] transgressor is hard
[1:07:00] don't you pay any attention to what
[1:07:02] anybody in the world tells you you do
[1:07:04] what God says no matter what
[1:07:07] you think about
[1:07:09] brother random said God why didn't you
[1:07:11] stop me you stopped me from drinking the
[1:07:13] drink you stopped me from smoking the
[1:07:15] cigarette you sit down the whoosh of the
[1:07:17] Whirlwind and and brought my mind back
[1:07:19] to the why amen but but there is such a
[1:07:22] lesson here and he's given the lesson
[1:07:24] out the way of a transgressor's heart
[1:07:26] only do that which God says
[1:07:30] no anybody else says
[1:07:32] he goes on he says he's talking about
[1:07:35] the flood now that came and he was out
[1:07:37] in his boat he was trying to pick people
[1:07:39] up and get him to safety and he was in a
[1:07:42] home where a woman was crying my baby my
[1:07:44] baby and he thought there was a baby
[1:07:45] there and the house began to break loose
[1:07:47] from the foundation and he runs back
[1:07:48] into his boat
[1:07:50] and he says I ran out real quick and
[1:07:52] jumped in the boat threw my hands down
[1:07:53] in the water and pulled the slip knot I
[1:07:55] sleeting cold the wind blowing
[1:07:57] blizzarding and I got into the boat I
[1:07:59] tried to pull the string on the starter
[1:08:01] I couldn't get it to start it and the
[1:08:03] current caught me this way and got me
[1:08:05] out onto Market Street sweating me out
[1:08:06] into the river
[1:08:08] there's the Ohio Falls crushing just
[1:08:10] below there the waves high as this
[1:08:12] building here romping like that with
[1:08:13] such a current and me standing in that
[1:08:16] boat pulling the string trying to get
[1:08:18] that motor to start and it wouldn't
[1:08:19] start seemed like I could hear somebody
[1:08:21] say now where's that bunch of trash at
[1:08:24] because that's what his mother-in-law
[1:08:26] called those people the Pentecostal
[1:08:27] people bunch of trash don't take my
[1:08:29] daughter amongst that trash
[1:08:31] I tell you brother the way of a
[1:08:33] transgressor's heart
[1:08:34] don't you let no one call you trash no I
[1:08:37] pulled that string and it wouldn't start
[1:08:39] and I said oh God
[1:08:40] I did that which is wrong
[1:08:44] this is somebody taking responsibility
[1:08:47] for their choice
[1:08:49] not saying God why didn't you stop me
[1:08:51] but God you know my mother-in-law was
[1:08:52] such a hard woman we would have had
[1:08:54] trouble it would you know how difficult
[1:08:56] it's not what he says
[1:08:58] now he takes responsibility for his
[1:09:00] choice
[1:09:02] he says
[1:09:04] God I did that which is wrong please I
[1:09:07] don't want to die out here in this River
[1:09:09] my baby and wife laying out there very
[1:09:10] sick please God don't let me die
[1:09:13] I was pulling that string and it
[1:09:15] wouldn't start and I turned around and
[1:09:16] the boat was half full of water almost
[1:09:17] then going on towards the Falls I knew
[1:09:20] just 10 minutes longer would be too much
[1:09:21] I pulled again I thought oh God forgive
[1:09:25] me for my sins and I pulled again and
[1:09:28] when I pulled that time the motor
[1:09:29] spluttered I pulled again and it started
[1:09:33] what did he have to do he had to come to
[1:09:36] terms with the consequences of his
[1:09:38] actions
[1:09:40] and he had to take responsibility for
[1:09:43] his actions and he had to own up to it
[1:09:46] and say Lord forgive me for my sins
[1:09:50] further down
[1:09:52] he talks about his wife passing away
[1:09:54] then
[1:09:55] and then he gets worried that his little
[1:09:57] daughter eight months old is laying in a
[1:09:59] hospital she got meningitis from her
[1:10:01] mother and he goes into Caesar and he
[1:10:04] said I've seen that little thing I knelt
[1:10:05] down on the floor and I said oh dear God
[1:10:07] I'm sorry that I did what I did
[1:10:11] I said you took my wife my darling away
[1:10:13] from me now you're taking my baby oh God
[1:10:15] please don't take my little girl
[1:10:17] I love her with all my heart I said I'll
[1:10:19] serve you I've done all I know to do
[1:10:22] except go when you told me two down
[1:10:25] there
[1:10:26] I said please don't take my baby that I
[1:10:28] love her oh no please tell me God I said
[1:10:30] take me instead of her
[1:10:32] as I raise my eyes look like a black
[1:10:34] sheep come unfolded
[1:10:36] I know she was going then I raised up
[1:10:39] and looked at her I said God bless you
[1:10:41] honey I said your daddy's darling I laid
[1:10:44] my hand over on her head and I said oh
[1:10:45] God said I don't know why you're tearing
[1:10:48] me up like this but I said still that
[1:10:50] doesn't change my faith in you
[1:10:53] said as job of old though you slay me
[1:10:55] yet I believe you with all my heart said
[1:10:57] I Trust You Lord
[1:10:59] said Sharon Rose God be with you honey
[1:11:01] in a few minutes the angels will come
[1:11:04] pack you little soul to mother and I
[1:11:06] will pick you up from here and lay you
[1:11:07] in mother's arms and bury you tomorrow
[1:11:09] said Lord I've done all I can it's now
[1:11:11] it's not my will now let thy will be
[1:11:14] done
[1:11:16] tell you what a horrible story
[1:11:19] but brother Branham told it as the
[1:11:22] consequences for his actions
[1:11:25] he was faced with the decision he could
[1:11:27] make a choice do what God told him to do
[1:11:29] or stay under the influence of his
[1:11:32] mother-in-law and he didn't want trouble
[1:11:34] so he listened to his mother-in-law and
[1:11:36] he says that's when my troubles began
[1:11:38] that's when sorrow started and all of
[1:11:40] these things he relates he ties it to
[1:11:42] that event amen and and brother
[1:11:45] branham's not blaming God he's not
[1:11:47] blaming his mother-in-law but he's
[1:11:49] recognizing I'm the one who did wrong
[1:11:55] I think it would be so much better for
[1:11:58] all of us if we stop blaming those
[1:12:00] around us
[1:12:02] it's just absolutely stop blaming
[1:12:05] everybody around us
[1:12:06] and start recognizing most of what I
[1:12:09] suffer with is my choices
[1:12:12] most of what I'm still struggling with
[1:12:15] and listen there's consequences there's
[1:12:17] things that you you and I and all of us
[1:12:19] here have done maybe decades ago and
[1:12:22] we're still suffering the consequences
[1:12:24] of those choices
[1:12:26] and we may still suffer in our minds or
[1:12:29] maybe in our bodies or maybe financially
[1:12:31] or physically in some way we may suffer
[1:12:34] the consequences for the rest of our
[1:12:36] life on this Earth and I'm telling you
[1:12:37] that's a good thing
[1:12:40] it may look like a bad thing but that's
[1:12:42] a good thing because it motivates us
[1:12:44] like never before to say God show me the
[1:12:47] right way that's the way I want to go
[1:12:48] show me your way that's the only thing I
[1:12:51] want because I'm still bearing
[1:12:53] consequences from my decisions amen from
[1:12:56] decades ago and it's motivating me not
[1:12:59] to ever do it again
[1:13:02] yesterday prophet of God says so we
[1:13:05] really believe that God never changes
[1:13:06] his mind about what he said he always
[1:13:08] keeps it true
[1:13:10] this is what brother brother Bam's going
[1:13:12] to say this and we're going to kind of
[1:13:14] balance things up here for a minute
[1:13:17] he says but he has a permissive will
[1:13:20] now there there's where the trouble Lays
[1:13:26] we try to work on God's permissive will
[1:13:28] and he will permit it
[1:13:30] but also if we take his permissive will
[1:13:32] though it's not right he will make his
[1:13:34] permissive will work out together to
[1:13:36] glorify his perfect will
[1:13:39] there is nothing will go wrong with God
[1:13:42] he knows just where the clock is a
[1:13:44] ticking at tonight there's nothing wrong
[1:13:45] every lick is hitting just exactly the
[1:13:47] way it should be everything we think
[1:13:49] it's wrong but he knows it's right it's
[1:13:51] supposed to be like this
[1:13:54] those scars that you got God knew about
[1:13:57] them
[1:13:59] you can listen you can you can take this
[1:14:02] two ways you can go an extreme one-way
[1:14:04] you can go an extreme the other way I've
[1:14:06] seen people so extreme in this that
[1:14:09] they're not even sorry for the wrongs
[1:14:11] anymore they say well that's what God
[1:14:13] wanted to happen
[1:14:14] I I mean I I I cheated and I lied and I
[1:14:18] stole from somebody and and then and
[1:14:20] I've got a erect life and a wrecked
[1:14:23] marriage and wrecked relationships all
[1:14:24] around me but that's what God wanted God
[1:14:26] knew from before the foundation world
[1:14:27] I'm a Child of God it's all working
[1:14:28] right on time
[1:14:30] listen brother Branham never took that
[1:14:32] attitude
[1:14:34] even though he knew that the permissive
[1:14:36] will will always work together for the
[1:14:38] perfect will of God and nothing will
[1:14:40] stop what God's going to do don't you
[1:14:42] ever stop being sorry for your sins and
[1:14:45] the consequences to other people
[1:14:48] I've heard people say that and it makes
[1:14:50] me sick to my stomach amen they will be
[1:14:52] caught in adultery they will be caught
[1:14:53] in pornography they'll be caught doing
[1:14:55] all this and later on they say well God
[1:14:57] knew it was going to happen anyways my
[1:14:59] goodness what are you saying it was your
[1:15:01] choice God never made you do it
[1:15:04] you did it of your own choosing amen and
[1:15:07] God and His Mercy because he chose you
[1:15:09] before the foundation of the world has a
[1:15:11] way in his grace to work it back into
[1:15:13] his perfect will but don't you dare take
[1:15:16] it flip it or lightly like it's a no
[1:15:17] thing that's still your choice
[1:15:20] you chose it you bear the consequences
[1:15:22] and your choice causes other people to
[1:15:24] bear the consequences and don't ever
[1:15:26] take it flip it like well God knew
[1:15:28] anyways God Must Have Known it's okay
[1:15:30] it's all working out for his good
[1:15:32] at the core that may be true
[1:15:35] but that's where the trouble Lays
[1:15:37] is what you took the permissive will of
[1:15:40] God
[1:15:40] and you need to own it
[1:15:44] we all need to own our decisions
[1:15:47] and our choices
[1:15:50] is this the way brother Brown's life had
[1:15:51] to go I believe that with all my heart
[1:15:54] I believe this is the way it had to go
[1:15:56] the circumstances though tragic as they
[1:15:58] were they needed to be that way did he
[1:16:01] need to grow up in a home of an
[1:16:03] alcoholic he needed to grow up in the
[1:16:04] home of an alcoholic
[1:16:06] although it left scars on him did he
[1:16:09] need to make the mistakes that he made I
[1:16:11] believe they all worked together for
[1:16:12] good but the prophet of God was willing
[1:16:14] to own his mistake and say I was wrong
[1:16:17] it's my fault and say that the whole
[1:16:21] church would be further down the road if
[1:16:22] I had chosen right correct Choice the
[1:16:25] first time
[1:16:26] look what he's doing he's taking the
[1:16:28] responsibility for the condition of the
[1:16:30] entire church at that time based off his
[1:16:33] decision
[1:16:36] don't go to an extreme in this and act
[1:16:39] like everything's fine in this life it's
[1:16:42] not fine
[1:16:44] in eternity everything's fine but in
[1:16:46] this life there are consequences for
[1:16:48] choices
[1:16:51] don't ever forget it
[1:16:53] and don't ever treat it lightly
[1:16:57] and don't ever speak like that to the
[1:17:00] people that you have damaged by your
[1:17:02] choices
[1:17:04] all you're going to do is ruin things
[1:17:06] and what you need to do is say it's my
[1:17:09] fault
[1:17:10] it's my fault friend it's my fault honey
[1:17:13] it's my fault children this is my fault
[1:17:15] and I'm sorry
[1:17:17] and I believe with all my heart God can
[1:17:19] even take this and make it work for good
[1:17:21] and something good could come out of it
[1:17:23] but it's my fault and I'm sorry for your
[1:17:25] suffering
[1:17:29] that's the way life is
[1:17:32] we are here in this Natural Life
[1:17:35] operating in a natural way for our
[1:17:38] education to learn about God to gain
[1:17:40] character for reigning so that we know
[1:17:43] more about God and how to live according
[1:17:46] to his word
[1:17:47] and while this life is structured this
[1:17:49] way we are all subject to the
[1:17:51] responsibility of free choice and we
[1:17:54] need to be real with it
[1:18:00] brother Branham says all the way in
[1:18:03] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:18:04] 1963.
[1:18:06] this is many many years later after the
[1:18:09] loss of his wife and his daughter
[1:18:12] says now we come back
[1:18:14] here and to visit he's living in Tucson
[1:18:17] Arizona at the time he come back he said
[1:18:19] the climate in this place I certainly
[1:18:21] don't like because it just breaks me
[1:18:23] down as soon as I get here I can cross
[1:18:25] the top of the knobs up there and come
[1:18:27] down the valley and I'm here about 10
[1:18:29] minutes and I get hives and get sick
[1:18:31] weather swimming head everything looks
[1:18:34] spooky dark and I just have to get out
[1:18:36] of it see and the other day I was
[1:18:37] talking to the wife but what brings me
[1:18:39] first what brings me here is you people
[1:18:41] see this church I tell you of all the
[1:18:43] places I ever went in my life this is my
[1:18:45] favorite place to come preach the gospel
[1:18:46] and it looks like that we can make a
[1:18:48] tape from here that's 10 times better
[1:18:50] than anywhere else
[1:18:51] that's the reason I say where God is
[1:18:53] doing something let's stay right with it
[1:18:54] now he's going to get back to a subject
[1:18:56] but I think where the great thing is
[1:19:00] that was me failing to go out at the
[1:19:02] first time when he called me
[1:19:04] and therefore he makes it kind of rough
[1:19:06] on me when I come in
[1:19:09] obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:19:13] here's the prophet of God still
[1:19:15] suffering a consequence of his actions
[1:19:18] from way more than a decade more than 15
[1:19:21] years before
[1:19:23] he's still suffering the consequences
[1:19:25] and he's not angry or bitter he gets
[1:19:28] swimmy-headed breaks out in hives he has
[1:19:30] sinus he has all kinds of this stuff
[1:19:32] when he comes into that climate and he
[1:19:34] says I think the reason is because I
[1:19:35] failed to go out and he kind of makes it
[1:19:37] rough on me amen and here he is bearing
[1:19:40] a consequence when God could take it
[1:19:42] away
[1:19:43] is that right God wants him to come and
[1:19:45] preach in that place surely God will
[1:19:47] take it away no it's a tremendous
[1:19:49] reminder for the prophet to stand up and
[1:19:51] say obedience is better than you listen
[1:19:53] to me amen this is what I'm suffering
[1:19:55] with today because of what I did back
[1:19:57] then and I'm telling you obedience is
[1:19:59] better than sacrifice
[1:20:01] man
[1:20:03] we want God to take away all
[1:20:05] consequences for our actions we want
[1:20:06] brother Brown said we treat God like a
[1:20:09] Santa Claus
[1:20:11] come to him and we want something we
[1:20:13] need something we want him to
[1:20:16] but
[1:20:17] we still live in this life
[1:20:20] I thank God that someday will escape all
[1:20:22] of this and there'll be no memory
[1:20:24] no memory of the sin no memory of the
[1:20:26] failure no consequence no scars amen
[1:20:28] nothing debilitating in our minds or an
[1:20:31] emotional realm no no physical scars no
[1:20:33] limitations no Financial tragedies no
[1:20:36] family I'm so glad we're going to escape
[1:20:38] from this but until we escape from this
[1:20:40] we have to live with this reality
[1:20:44] and I said God help me to put your word
[1:20:47] first in everything
[1:20:49] it will work out amen it will not fail
[1:20:54] the day that Abraham gave the choice to
[1:20:56] lie it looked like lot got the better
[1:20:58] end of the deal but just wait a little
[1:21:00] while and you'll find out that lot got
[1:21:03] the worst end of the deal he had tragedy
[1:21:05] for the rest of his life and sorrow and
[1:21:08] suffering because of his choice to
[1:21:10] better himself and Abraham stayed in the
[1:21:12] Rocky ground and he got everything
[1:21:14] blessings and visitations and a promised
[1:21:17] son and everything that you could
[1:21:18] possibly get Abram God and he stayed
[1:21:21] separated from Sodom stayed in a what
[1:21:24] seemed like a worse condition but he
[1:21:27] stayed with the word and he got the
[1:21:28] better
[1:21:30] man
[1:21:31] make choices not for Prosperity take
[1:21:34] choices not for comfortable living make
[1:21:36] choices not for ease make choices for
[1:21:39] the word amen make choices for obedience
[1:21:43] it will always pay off
[1:21:46] you talk to the Saints who've been
[1:21:47] around for seven or eight decades
[1:21:50] they'll tell you that what I'm telling
[1:21:51] you is nothing but the truth
[1:21:54] they've had a they've had time in their
[1:21:55] life to see a few Cycles
[1:21:58] and after you've seen it a few times
[1:22:00] it's like watching the cycle through the
[1:22:02] judges amen they they would they'd have
[1:22:04] a judge raise a mom they would have a
[1:22:06] Revival and then before too long they
[1:22:08] would let the idolatry creep back in and
[1:22:10] lazy living and then another outside
[1:22:12] force would come and take them captive
[1:22:14] or put them under bondage they'd cry out
[1:22:16] to the Lord he would raise up another
[1:22:18] judge and here comes another cycle and
[1:22:20] it happens again in another cycle and
[1:22:22] another cycle and another cycle
[1:22:26] well you've been around for several
[1:22:27] decades you've seen enough Cycles to
[1:22:29] know that it will always cycle until I
[1:22:32] take the word
[1:22:34] and then get into a different cycle
[1:22:39] brother Brown said in the Hebrew series
[1:22:43] you know you say well
[1:22:45] we can't backslide absolutely and when
[1:22:47] you backslide you're going to get it
[1:22:49] don't you worry
[1:22:50] Abraham got it and the rest of them got
[1:22:52] it and you'll get it don't you think it
[1:22:54] gives you a right to sin it doesn't you
[1:22:56] pay for everything that you do
[1:22:59] you'll reap what you sow you do one
[1:23:02] little sin and you'll reap a whole
[1:23:04] Washed Up full that's right but brother
[1:23:06] that don't mean to say that you're lost
[1:23:09] it doesn't change anything in the
[1:23:11] economy of God about your sonship
[1:23:14] it doesn't change anything in God's
[1:23:16] purpose for your life but what a little
[1:23:18] change is the circumstances here in this
[1:23:20] dimension
[1:23:22] let's look at Galatians chapter 6
[1:23:24] together
[1:23:25] I just want to read this and then one
[1:23:27] more scripture
[1:23:29] Galatians
[1:23:31] chapter 6.
[1:23:37] in verse 7.
[1:23:40] Galatians 6
[1:23:42] and 7.
[1:23:44] be not deceived God is Not mocked for
[1:23:48] whatsoever a man soweth that shall he
[1:23:51] also reap
[1:23:53] for he that soweth through his flesh all
[1:23:55] of the flesh reap corruption but he that
[1:23:57] soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit
[1:23:58] reap life Everlasting
[1:24:00] let us not be weary in well-doing for in
[1:24:03] due season we shall reap if we faint not
[1:24:07] this is a principle with God and it
[1:24:09] doesn't change
[1:24:11] giving your heart to the Lord doesn't
[1:24:12] change this principle
[1:24:15] believing the message being born again
[1:24:17] doesn't change this principle in life
[1:24:23] he goes on to say in the Hebrews series
[1:24:25] he says you'll make mistakes you'll fall
[1:24:28] you'll willfully do wrong
[1:24:30] you'll go out sometime and do things
[1:24:32] that don't mean that you're lost that
[1:24:35] means that you're going to get
[1:24:36] correction
[1:24:39] you can't be lost if you're a siegene of
[1:24:41] God
[1:24:43] you can never be separated from the love
[1:24:45] of God you can never be separated from
[1:24:47] the plan of God because you were in the
[1:24:49] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:24:50] foundation of the world but he planted
[1:24:53] that seed in the part of the earth and
[1:24:54] made that part of the earth subject to
[1:24:56] the laws of the Earth
[1:24:58] what four for our learning
[1:25:03] let's learn
[1:25:06] remember brother Branham when he was in
[1:25:09] Africa
[1:25:10] he was told to stay in a certain city I
[1:25:13] believe it was Durban I don't remember
[1:25:15] Durbin they were going to move away but
[1:25:17] he was told to stay and they were
[1:25:18] putting all kinds of pressure on him all
[1:25:20] kinds of pressure we've already got
[1:25:22] lined up meetings we've got ministers
[1:25:23] we've got obligations they're trying to
[1:25:25] get him to move and he and even brother
[1:25:27] Bosworth and brother Baxter are against
[1:25:30] him amen trying to get him just to go
[1:25:32] along with the program and the only
[1:25:34] person who stood with him was Billy Paul
[1:25:37] dad just do what the answer of the Lord
[1:25:39] says
[1:25:40] but God wakes him up and tells him this
[1:25:42] is what he says he says
[1:25:46] he said go on said go on said they got
[1:25:49] you tied into it
[1:25:51] go on but remember you'll pay for it
[1:25:55] this is what God says to him
[1:25:58] go on they've got you tired I see you're
[1:26:00] in effects
[1:26:01] they've got you tied into it
[1:26:04] but remember you'll pay for it
[1:26:07] and he gave me some signs to know that
[1:26:10] this is what's going to happen and the
[1:26:11] signs all come to pass he says and he
[1:26:14] said by that you'll know that I give you
[1:26:16] permission to go but remember you'll
[1:26:19] suffer for it remember he took an amoeba
[1:26:22] and he got so sick that he thought he
[1:26:24] was going to die
[1:26:26] and he was sick for a long period of
[1:26:28] time and they couldn't do anything to
[1:26:29] help him he thought I was going to die
[1:26:30] and then God Amen miraculously healed
[1:26:33] him but God told him I'd give you
[1:26:35] permission to go you're tied into it but
[1:26:37] remember you're going to pay for it why
[1:26:39] because he already knew the perfect will
[1:26:41] of God and he wasn't able to resist what
[1:26:44] these ministers were doing and God was
[1:26:46] going to teach that Prophet a lesson
[1:26:48] that was going to come in handy later
[1:26:50] and benefit all of us
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:53] thank you
[1:26:56] listen we've got consequences
[1:26:59] is there anybody in the room that
[1:27:01] doesn't have any consequences for any of
[1:27:02] your actions
[1:27:03] everything's been wonderful and you
[1:27:05] don't have any negative consequences
[1:27:08] I mean even if you're a four-year-old
[1:27:09] you've had a spanking by now
[1:27:11] so you've had negative consequences for
[1:27:13] your actions
[1:27:16] but you know what they're there
[1:27:19] some of them remain some of them we
[1:27:22] still have to deal with or suffer under
[1:27:24] but don't let them keep us from our
[1:27:27] purpose but let them push us into our
[1:27:29] purpose
[1:27:30] don't let the things I mean there are
[1:27:32] things that sometimes I'll have a
[1:27:34] flashback in my mind of the way I acted
[1:27:36] in the past things I've said and things
[1:27:38] I've done and when that mental image
[1:27:39] comes up I get a literal shiver down my
[1:27:42] spine
[1:27:43] at the shame and regret of things that I
[1:27:45] have done
[1:27:49] but I don't want that to keep me from my
[1:27:51] purpose or cause me to shut down or quit
[1:27:54] pursuing after the things have gone but
[1:27:55] I want the remembrance that still
[1:27:58] lingers three decades later I want the
[1:28:00] remembrance of that to push me to the
[1:28:02] will of God I mean to keep me in the
[1:28:05] word and keep me making the choosing the
[1:28:07] word above everything else above my
[1:28:10] feelings above pleasure above Easy
[1:28:12] Living above it all all I want is his
[1:28:14] will because his will always comes out
[1:28:16] right
[1:28:19] amen
[1:28:23] and here
[1:28:25] we come to the message birth pains
[1:28:28] birth pains
[1:28:30] and brother Branham takes out a little
[1:28:32] piece of paper and birth pains
[1:28:34] and he wants to read a message that was
[1:28:36] given in tongues and interpretations
[1:28:39] he was preaching and he spoke and uh
[1:28:41] Danny Henry ran up to him threw his arms
[1:28:43] around him and said if that wouldn't be
[1:28:44] sacrilegious that could be the 23rd
[1:28:47] chapter of the Book of Revelation and
[1:28:48] then he speaks in an unknown language
[1:28:51] what is known language he speaks in
[1:28:52] French
[1:28:53] and there's three people there that can
[1:28:55] translate amen and so they bring the
[1:28:57] translation and brother branham's going
[1:28:58] to read it there and he gets to this
[1:29:00] part of the note he said he said I would
[1:29:02] like to read this note this is the
[1:29:04] original note of one of them and it was
[1:29:06] from the man that hadn't that had
[1:29:08] interpreted I may not be able to call
[1:29:10] his name just right Victor Ledoux he is
[1:29:13] a full-blooded Frenchman now here's the
[1:29:15] message
[1:29:16] because thou has chosen the Narrow Path
[1:29:20] what is that that's a choice
[1:29:23] because thou has chosen a narrow path
[1:29:26] the harder way thou has walked of your
[1:29:30] own choosing
[1:29:32] God didn't make him
[1:29:35] God gave him the opportunity to choose
[1:29:37] and he choose he chose
[1:29:40] but listen that Prophet had chose wrong
[1:29:42] before and bore the consequences for the
[1:29:45] rest of his life amen he knew what it
[1:29:47] was to choose wrong and bear
[1:29:49] consequences but by the grace of God he
[1:29:51] also knew what it was to choose right
[1:29:53] and bear those consequences
[1:29:56] thou has chosen the Narrow Path the
[1:29:58] harder way thou has walked of your own
[1:30:00] choosing thou has picked the correct and
[1:30:03] precise decision God didn't pick it for
[1:30:06] him although it was God's perfect will
[1:30:08] and this Dimension he left it for him to
[1:30:11] make
[1:30:12] and he says you had made you have picked
[1:30:15] the correct and precise decision
[1:30:18] and it is my way
[1:30:21] because of this momentous decision
[1:30:26] oh
[1:30:27] this is going to bring you and I right
[1:30:29] into the picture
[1:30:31] because of this momentous decision a
[1:30:34] huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what
[1:30:36] a glorious decision thou has made this
[1:30:40] in itself is that which will give and
[1:30:43] make come to pass the tremendous victory
[1:30:45] in love divine
[1:30:48] that's what we're living in that's what
[1:30:50] we're experiencing that's why we're
[1:30:52] benefactors up at one point the prophet
[1:30:55] of God could say my decision has held
[1:30:57] back the progress of the whole church
[1:31:00] but now in tongues and interpretation
[1:31:02] God is telling them your decision the
[1:31:05] correct decision the precious decision
[1:31:07] my way in itself amen this because of
[1:31:12] this momentous decision what decision
[1:31:15] the one the prophet made
[1:31:17] because of this momentous decision a
[1:31:20] huge portion of Heaven A wasted what a
[1:31:22] glorious decision thou has made not not
[1:31:26] God's not saying not I forced you or I
[1:31:30] did this no he's saying you chose it and
[1:31:32] it was the right choice and it's a
[1:31:34] glorious decision
[1:31:37] this the decision the prophet made in
[1:31:40] itself
[1:31:42] is that which will give and may come to
[1:31:44] pass to tremendous Victory and love to
[1:31:46] find
[1:31:48] we now
[1:31:50] are bearing the consequences of the
[1:31:52] prophet's decision
[1:31:56] if it has the power for negative it has
[1:31:58] the power for good it has the power for
[1:32:01] death it has the power for life and I
[1:32:03] say God used my decisions for the power
[1:32:05] of life let my choices bring life let my
[1:32:09] choices open up a greater way let my
[1:32:11] choices bring deliverance and healing
[1:32:13] and all kinds of things let my choices
[1:32:15] be your choices let my choice be the
[1:32:18] correct and precise way
[1:32:21] man oh God help us to stay in the word
[1:32:25] help us to stay in prayer help us to
[1:32:27] stay sensitive to the leading of the
[1:32:29] holy spirit so that we are not flipping
[1:32:31] about life that we're not bulldozing our
[1:32:33] way through but we're actually patient
[1:32:35] and saying God I need to make the right
[1:32:38] decision I want to know what is your
[1:32:40] word and your will cause that's my
[1:32:42] decision is going to be
[1:32:47] it doesn't always work out perfect we
[1:32:49] don't always get messages from heaven we
[1:32:52] don't always get a perfect answer
[1:32:54] sometimes we just have to make the
[1:32:56] decision we feel is best and even then
[1:32:58] sometimes we'll learn it's wrong and
[1:32:59] there'll be consequences for that but oh
[1:33:02] it all works together for good friends
[1:33:04] it's all there for our training to teach
[1:33:06] us that we have to have the word or
[1:33:08] nothing else and his way is the only way
[1:33:15] now
[1:33:16] we can we can
[1:33:19] hate the power of free choice
[1:33:22] or we can grab a hold of it with all of
[1:33:24] its responsibilities
[1:33:27] and say I've experienced
[1:33:30] the power of a wrong decision
[1:33:34] and it's powerful
[1:33:36] some of you have made some seriously
[1:33:38] wrong decisions I've made some seriously
[1:33:40] wrong decisions that we're still living
[1:33:42] with
[1:33:43] yes
[1:33:45] but the power of a decision
[1:33:48] can be in the right way
[1:33:51] can be just as powerful
[1:33:54] and not just for decades but for
[1:33:57] eternity
[1:33:58] [Music]
[1:33:59] there's a responsibility that comes with
[1:34:01] free choice let's not take that
[1:34:04] responsibility lightly
[1:34:07] look at one more scripture in Revelation
[1:34:09] chapter 19 and then we'll end here
[1:34:16] Revelation Chapter 19 Verse 7.
[1:34:28] Revelation 19 and 7.
[1:34:31] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:34:33] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:34:35] Lamb has come
[1:34:36] and his wife hath made herself ready
[1:34:42] what is that
[1:34:43] a choice
[1:34:46] a choice that the bride has
[1:34:49] she gets to make a choice like Esther
[1:34:51] got to make a choice of what she'll take
[1:34:52] in to meet the king
[1:34:54] this bride has a choice and it's been
[1:34:57] given to her the garment's been
[1:34:58] presented
[1:34:59] the wedding garment has been given amen
[1:35:02] the prophet was here to dress Amen to
[1:35:05] the bride and the clothing of the word
[1:35:07] amen but this bride has a choice to make
[1:35:10] herself ready now somebody else made her
[1:35:13] ready but she's got to take that word
[1:35:15] and put it on
[1:35:17] she's got to come in line with God's
[1:35:20] will God's desire God's word for this
[1:35:22] age and this bride this wife had the
[1:35:26] what's rejoicing all of Heaven is
[1:35:28] rejoicing
[1:35:30] why are they rejoicing because this
[1:35:32] bride has made herself ready
[1:35:35] we have a choice friends
[1:35:37] I want to choose the word
[1:35:40] man let's all Stand Together

[1:36:26] prophet how life works
