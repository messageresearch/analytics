evening let's bow our heads lord jesus we thank you we thank you lord for the privilege of gathering again lord as we so often say that mean it from our hearts lord we consider it a grand privilege and may it never become a tradition lord but it may it always have meaning and purpose in our hearts and when we come each time with expectation lord to hear from you god may you find welcome lord and our hearts and in our lives and our singing and our praises may it all be gloried and honored to your name lord god as we look into your word we pray you would come and break the bread of life to us and that you would feed us of your own hand one that you'd be pleased with all that's said and that we may grow to be more like you word by word we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and god bless you while we're standing we could take our bibles and turn to the book of jonah i'm going to continue on i believe for one more service from where we were on sunday but i give it a different title i'd like to call it the open book of life and we'll look into that for a few minutes but we'll begin here in jonah jonah chapter 3 and verse 10. and god saw their works that they turned from their evil way and god repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not as we know from sunday this was nineveh jonah went and cried out against nineveh as the lord had told him to and they repented in sackcloth and ashes and here it says they repented of the evil that and god repented of the evil that he said that he would do unto them and he did it not so god sent jonah to preach a message unto them to cry out against it and cry out that there was a judgment coming in 40 days and when they repented in sackcloth and ashes then god repented of the evil that he said that he would do and he did it not in chapter 4 verse 1 but it displeased jonah exceedingly and he was very angry and he prayed unto the lord and said i pray thee o lord was not this my saying when i was yet in my country therefore i fed i fled before and before unto tarshish for i knew that thou art a gracious god and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentancy of the evil praise god jonah's complaint is my refuge and my comfort amen god bless you as you seated and then jonah had ought against them in nineveh he had a wrong attitude about them obviously he wanted them destroyed he didn't want their repentance to bring god's mercy upon them so he he was angry exceedingly amen he was displeased and exceedingly he was very angry but but what he was telling god was god i didn't want to come here because i knew i knew that you are a gracious god and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentancy of the evil praise be to god that's the attributes in god that i'm thankful for tonight amen that he was gracious with me he's merciful that he slow to anger with me that he that he repented of the evil that i deserve amen but i thank god for that amen i want to take a look here at a quote uh two quotes here one from faith once delivered to the saints from 1957. brother brennan said christ will come he will be the judge but before he can bring judgment he has to offer mercy to be a just god and if he offers mercy and mercy is spurn then there's nothing left but judgment and you'll and you've judged yourself by rejecting him don't reject him anymore so brother graham's telling us that there's a principle with god that he will bring mercy before he brings judgment and he and he doesn't call man to judgment without first giving him a warning but god now comes and now nineveh is going to be judged but he sends a message of judgment through jonah but when jonah preaches this message of judgment they repent and they receive mercy and we know later they they go back on that they turn back and there in the book of nahum they're destroyed but god is a merciful god and god brings doesn't bring man to judgment without first giving him a warning and giving him an opportunity of mercy so man amen man condemns himself by rejecting god's mercy and the message is the token brother bam said he had done all these things and yet they still desired not to repent or to believe the message of the day they still didn't want to do it although it had been displayed before them and had been surely made known and when you see such things take place it is a sign of oncoming judgment judgment will follow those things it always done it and this won't be no exception see judgment follows grace when mercy is spurned there's nothing left but judgment so it will always follow it amen god is gracious god is merciful god is slow to anger amen and god amen it's all of these wonderful things but he is also a god of justice and a god of judgment so he must remain a god of justice and a god of judgment and a god full of grace and a god who's merciful amen it takes a perfect character to be able to pull all of this off at the same time god will never god will never uh diminish his justice his his law of justice to be merciful and he'll never forsake mercy for justice somehow god can keep it all in perfect balance amen and he's perfect always in his judgment perfect in his justice he's always righteous yet he's always gracious and he's always merciful i say i i love serving a god whose character is perfect amen and this bible is such a display of his character if you can turn with me to daniel chapter 7 i want to start looking at judgment and we're going to focus on the white throne judgment for a little space of time here the book of daniel chapter 7 and i'm going to very much so try to take my time not take a long time but just go slow and teach this evening daniel chapter 7 verse 9. and i beheld till thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame in his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were open so brother branham ties this to the white throne judgment and showing that that thousand thousands ministered unto him and brother benham said that's his bride for who ministers to a man but his wife and so the bride is in judgment with him ministering unto him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were open i think it's important to note when we come to this judgment the books were open so it's a it's an open book judgment there's nothing hidden in this judgment nothing now a secret amen everything is completely open when we come to the white throne judgment so there is there is nothing that we will ever keep hidden or keep secret from god let's go over to revelation chapter 20. we can hide all of our life but there's no hiding at the whiteton judgment revelation chapter 20 verse 11 and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face to earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were open and another book was opened which is the book of life so now we've got books that are opened and the book of life is open at this white throne judgment and let's let's read that again and i saw the dead small and great stand before god amen this is not a judgment that the bride will ever go to amen this is not a judgment for the seed of god because the seed of god has bypassed judgment they will now not come to condemnation or the judgment they already have eternal life amen this is the judgment of the dead those without eternal life amen because the the bride the elect of god are not dead they're living amen and when they pass on they're sleeping but this is everybody else outside of the elect predestinated seed of god who will stand in judgment and everybody else will stand in this judgment and it says then i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works i think this is very interesting this judgment is a judgment that has to do with their works amen that's why the book of life is open and other books are open this is really interesting because they're judged based off their works amen but the bride is not going to be amen she's not going to come into condemnation she's not going to be judged between life and death based off of her works amen she's received life by faith she's a gift of faith and by faith she has eternal life amen and so it's her judgment she will come to a judgment a judgment of rewards coming into the millennium amen in that judgment of rewards is based off what she did in life amen but it's never a judgment of condemnation ever and then it's a judgment of rewards here is a judgment between life and death amen between those who will enter in and those who will go to the lake of fire and it's amazing to note that the books were open and the book of life were open and they were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and the death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works this is the second time it's mentioned according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire and let's turn back to matthew 25 this is the third scripture i want to read in reference to the white throne judgment because brother benham also tells us that this is the white throne judgment matthew 25 and verse 31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divided his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on his left on the left now we've got in this judgment we've got some categories of people we've got before the throne a gathering of people all the nations are gathered and they're going to be separated as a shepherd separates his sheep from his goats amen and then you've got the lord on the throne but he's going to start issuing out amen either condemnation or or salvation based off what they did and let's let's let's keep reading that and we'll comment on it in a minute verse 33 and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was a hungered and you gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saul we thee a hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took the inn or naked and clothed thee or when saw we the sick or in prison and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you in so much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me you cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungred and you gave me no meat i was thirsty and you gave me no drink i was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me nom then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee a hungered or a thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you insomuch as you did it not to one of the least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away unto everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal so here at the white throne judgment christ is here dividing as sheep from goats and and he's separating them based off what they did to him that they were judged according to their works one group had done service unto him had fed him when he was hungry clothed him was naked visited him when he was in prison and when one group had done that but they didn't know that they were doing it to him they were they were ignorant of the fact amen that they were serving the lord and they said when did we do these things unto you and he said it when you did it to the least of these mine brethren so you see there's another mystery group embedded in matthew 25 and the mystery group is these my brethren and he's not talking about the ones separated as sheep or those separated from goats there's a whole nother category of people here in matthew 25 that are these and my brethren and you have to say where are your brethren they tell us in the book of daniel amen and thousand times thousands ministered to him were on the throne with him it was his bride amen it was the elect predestinated seed that were seated with him on his throne and he said when you did it unto these my brethren you did it unto me. that's why this is this is not i mean sometimes with a denominational mentality we get the we get the thinking or the attitude if we if we start a clothing drive for the poor and we start amen feeding the poor and we start a food bank amen we'll ensure amen that we get a better judgment amen but only if you clothe christ [Music] only if you're feeding christ amen you could be feeding a lot of people that aren't his brethren that's not what they received entrance into eternal life for but it was when they fed him amen when they clothed him when they visited him amen so you take if we take the denominational idea the denominational idea is amen god says amen that if if we feed the poor and if we clothe the naked we do it unto him that is not necessarily true that's why the denominational idea amen will never ever comprehend the nature of god amen how can god amen grant you entrance into eternal life amen because you took clothes and you gave clothes to just any person any body of flesh that was walking out of there no they're granted eternal life because they gave him clothes when he was naked they gave the they gave the person of life himself clothes when he was naked food when he was hungry hey listen when jesus christ amen oh praise be to god when jesus christ is just in his heavenly form he's never hungry he's never naked he's never in prison but it's only when he's in a body of flesh that he can be naked or in prison or hungry so they couldn't do it to jesus amen as as the great savior on high dwelling in the heavenly realms they can only do these acts these works that are written in the book amen that will grant them life everlasting they can only do it as christ is manifest in flesh and when christ is manifest in flesh amen then he can be naked then he could be hungry then he could be poor then he can need a visit praise god amen so it's not a food drive it's not a clothing drive it's serving christ when christ is manifest in flesh amen do we see that brother branham says in the sardinian church age book and i'm referencing several quotes out of the church age book from the sardisian church age and it'd be good for you to go back and read this if you've got the church age book if you've got one of the blue ones it's a huge section that brother benham takes on this book of life and he breaks it down so thoroughly and then it's between pages 266 and 286 20 pages between page 266 and 286 it would be good for you to go back and read it because i'm not going to break down the whole thing but brother banner spends 20 pages in the sardisian church age explaining this so thoroughly amen so that we could understand it here he says on page 277 the first resurrection has nothing to do with second death the first resurrection is when the elect seed of god will resurrect amen in the rapture that's the first resurrection that has nothing to do with the second death there's no chance of coming to second death you'll never condemn the condemnation you'll never come into the judgment that's only for those who are in the second resurrection then that's everybody all the dead come up after the thousand years and are judged the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second death that is at the end of the thousand years when all the rest of the dead live again and in that day there will be those who come forth to eternal life and those others who are caught in the second death now we do not need to guess about those who those who in the second resurrection are given life we are told it is given to them on the ground that they have been kind and good to the brethren those who are raised and cast into the lake of fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the brethren since this is the word of god we simply accept it there is no argument here just a simple statement of fact i wish it was that easy for everybody amen we just accept it as fact to further clarify notice specifically the words of matthew 25 31-46 it does not say that a shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as and this is capitalized yes it has a shepherd dividing sheep from goats these are not sheep in the particular area of time white throne judgment the sheep are in his fold they heard his voice word and they followed him they already have eternal life and cannot come into the judgment this is an important distinguishing that jesus is making because if we go to matthew 25 and try to apply it to all the scripture amen when jesus is talking about my sheep hear my voice and other than not follow when you think these are jesus sheep you find yourself thinking that the elect predestinated are there in this judgment but they are not these are not sheep the sheep have already been gathered into the fold but he's separating as a shepherd it's an analogy it's a tide as a shepherd which separates sheep from goats this is how he's separating two groups of people but these are not the sheep of god amen but these do but he says i'll read this again the sheep are in his fold they heard his voice word and they followed him they heard his voice word what was his voice the word amen what word the word for your day is the voice of god calling you and they followed him they already have eternal life and cannot come into the judgment but these do not have eternal life and they are in the judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life they do not have eternal life that's why they're in the judgment if they had eternal life they wouldn't be in the judgment they would have been part of the first resurrection but because they're in the judgment they cannot have eternal life praise god brother benham is so clear on this but upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his brethren they are already sorry they are not his brethren that would make them joint heirs with jesus they are not heirs to anything but life they share no throne etc with them their names must have been in the book of life and not removed now because of their love of the people of god they are recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of god perhaps like nicodemus and gamaliel they stood for the children in a time of trouble if this seems the smack of restoration restoration is god will restore everyone in the end that's not what he's saying if this seems the smack of restoration watch carefully now for the wicked are not restored but turned into the lake of fire the names of many of those destroyed were in the book of life also but they were blotted out because they failed to honor the people of god who were the living manifested word living epistles for their day jesus said when i was hungry you fed me when i was naked you cloned me enter into the joys of the lord now listen enter into the jewish lord prepared the kingdom prepared before the foundation of the world if you think about what's being said that when god in his great mind knew that he was going to come down he had a plan because we had a lamb slain before the foundation of the world so god foresaw a fall because he had a lamb slain before the foundation of the world so before there was a fall there was a lamb slain if there's a lamb slain god fore knows there'll be a fall god foresault amen his plan of redemption he foresaw the plan of himself coming down amen and coming down and manifesting himself through six six thousand years of time amen so that he could display his characteristics so that he could display his attributes amen so that he could so that he could become a tangible god who can be felt who can be touched amen and all of his attributes would come into expression and all of his characteristics would be expressed in this time amen and he would redeem back himself to be a family upon the earth but when god foresaw that he foresaw also times when he would be naked hungry are you catching this when he foresaw his the journey of the predestination of zoe life of eternal life of the life of god of the manifestation of christ down through 6 000 years of time he also foresaw times of need times of hunger times of nakedness times of destitution times of imprisonment he also forced all that amen so when he had when when he was let's just say writing the last book of life because i don't believe god wrote it it was in his mind i don't believe he had to write it out like a writer writes a story amen god in his thinking he foresaw the whole plan it was all real to him and the thoughts of god and when he saw these attributes coming down and he saw need amen he would also foresee a provision to meet that need amen and the provision would be in the book of life praise god they didn't have life they were not part of him they were not his attributes but when he foresaw amen himself coming down through the stream of time he foresaw areas of need and need of support and times amen when we would need people to to step in and do things to keep the program moving so god also foresaw other individuals who would come on the scene at that time and to support and to help amen and to move the program of god along so god also foreknown he also predestinated helps hey amen talk about a wonderful god talk about a wonderful plan and these helps if they would aid the life of god as it was moving down through and progress the plan of god and move the plan forward and keep moving the word forward and keep helping the word as it moves forward they would receive entrance into the kingdom of god into eternal life for their support for their works because when they come to this white throne judgment they're they're judged based off the things that are written in the book one the in the book of life there's only there's only one thing written in the book of life that's names and if their name's not there they go to the lake of fire if their name is still there at the white turn judgment they go into the kingdom so what are these other books for because we have the book of life and when we come time to the book of life amen the section of the book of life that's the lamb's book of life which is the record of the seed of christ that's already sitting on the throne with him so now he's opening the book of life amen for the part that's not the predestinated elect seed for the rest of those that are in the book of life and if your name is still there you go into life if your name is not there you go to the lake of fire so what are the other books this is just brother chad i may be wrong but i believe those other books based off what we read in the prophet said i believe those other books are god's justification for his judgment what would be in those books when i was hungry you fed me when i was naked you clothed me when did we do these things right here in the book amen when i was 1000 bc amen 20 21 when i was walking in flesh i had a need and you met that need you support it you defended you protected you did whatever it was that the book said you did and this is my justification for my judgment amen why else would we need other books and they're judged out of the things written in the books not the book the books according to their works what works not that they were just a good daddy and not that they were just honest in their employment but what they did amen according to the program of god and how they helped or hindered the program of god that's the judgment praise be to god let's go to mark chapter 9. like i said i'm going to take my time but i'm not going to take a long time i'm going to try to do something new i'm going to try to preach only one hour don't laugh at me it hurts my feelings mark chapter 9 verse 41. for whosoever shall give you a cup of cold a cup of water to drink in my name i'm sorry let's back up to verse 40. for he that is not against us is on our part for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to christ verily i say unto you you shall not he shall not lose his reward and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea right there is justification for judgment one group if they just so much as give a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong in to christ apparently i say unto you he shall not lose his reward and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea amen if you offend you're doomed if you help you can be saved amen let's go to matthew chapter 10. matthew chapter 10 verse 40 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he the receiver of the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man receiveth a righteous man's reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward this is not giving anybody you come in contact with a cup of water that is one who belongs to christ amen that is one of these little ones and so the this what brother ben is teaching us is not isolated what he's teaching us is throughout the entire scripture in fact what i would like to propose is that what brother benham is teaching here in the sardisian church age he's teaching the very nature and character of god that is throughout this entire bible because this is the way god deals with people all the way through his word amen and god remember he's gracious he's merciful he's slow to anger he is all of these things amen and he always is giving people an opportunity in giving people a chance but when mercy is spurned there's nothing left for judgment now i want to read this quote uh here out of an absolute from 1963 an absolute he said i can see eternity break come down into time since eden and when it did there came a line of blood all the way up unto calvary and from calvary tied with this line and goes on to the typos jesus and someday when he comes to claim his own everyone that's tied to that ultimate will be raised up into eternity why they have been in eternity all the time they were predestinated in eternity they are part of god they were in his thinking at the beginning and when that big rope is pulled of the line of blood that token i was speaking of when it comes up from the earth everyone that was included in that blood will be dropped right up and dropped right up into eternity again but the only way it'll be will be tied to that absolute jesus christ it's absolute not an achievement of man but god raised him up from the dead and he is an absolute and we know he's alive because here he is with us in the power of his resurrection doing the same things he did when he was here on earth he goes down skipping a paragraph down to another one he says it don't make any difference what others want to believe to the individual you're tied to that brother branham patch's bible so he's talking about the bible you're tied to that that's your ultimate that's the last word and then if he's the word then he must be the last word this this must settle it whatever that says that's that scarlet thread that is christ and anything contrary to that i know nothing about him that's what we want to know is what the word says for i am tied to christ and christ is the word you you get it now and the portion of his word that's lauded for this day his holy spirit is here to manifest that portion of the word just like it was back here at his birth isaiah 9 6 all down through the scriptures everything was spoke of him it was fulfilled over in the book of luke we see it he was that he was the end he was the end of the prophecy too of him he fulfilled that the history the songs everything in the old testament that spoke of him it was fulfilled right there that became the ultimate that became the thai post of the word of god for that age amen brother franco can you turn this writing tablet on i'm gonna i'm gonna try to draw some pictures we've got a new writing tablet that i'm gonna try to work with and see if it works okay so i wanna i wanna draw align if i can let's see if i can draw a line i drew a line and then i want to draw a cross right here the mind of god that looks horrible there in the mind of god was the plan of god and he foresaw and and part of god were attributes of god and in the mind of god was the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world but the section of that lamb section of that book of life was what brother brown calls the lamb's book of life he said it's really it's like it's two books but it's one book it's one book with two sections one section is the zoe life the eternal life the life of god that'll come down through time and the other section is is the the other part of the book of life which we already described it's the part that supports that life and supporting that life it gets the benefit of life that's why it's called the book of life so what makes it the book of life is because part of that book is zoe eternal life and the rest of that book is surrounding that life or supporting that life and because they support that life they have a right to that zoe life they're not part of it but they get access to it they're supporting it so they get the benefit of it amen and that's all contained in the book of life not death but life so in the mind of god is the book of life okay it comes down starts here it comes from god and it goes back to god and on this line we start over here i'm a little off but forgive me it comes down to adam and god brings life down into adam and he and he starts his plan on earth and we know that there's a fall and then god then god gives a blood sacrifice as an atonement for adam to cover for his sins now that blood could never take away it could never take away the sin of adam but it was only making a covering for that and it was foreshadowing the lamb slain before the foundation of the world which would be when god amen brings that zoe life down and that life becomes uh it becomes encompassed or embodied in a mortal man and a mortal life with created blood of god and that blood will be shed amen and that shedding of that blood amen will be an elimination of cleaning taking away of the sin of mankind amen but until then they had to stick with the foreshadowing part because that was the word for their day and what brother benham is telling us in this quote he said the word for your day becomes the ultimate becomes the thai post so i want to read that again he said i am tied to christ and christ is the word and the portion of his word that's lotted for this day so so we we've got to be part of christ part of the word but it's got to be the timepost it's got to be the ultimate but it has to be the portion of that word for that day amen so he goes and he talks about the prophecy that christ fulfilled of isaiah 9 6 and he become he was the fulfillment of the old testament prophecy he was a fulfillment of all the old testament prophecies they were all fulfilled in him all the law all the prophets everything was fulfilled in him amen so he was the word made manifest for that day and in that day he was the ultimate he was the thai post now listen what he says next that became the thai post of the word of god for that age and the real born-again people of this age that's filled with the holy ghost is the thai post of this scripture that's got to be fulfilled in these last days there's a typos today amen and that thai post is christ and what is christ the anointed word that's made manifest in his day what is the portion of the word to be manifest for this day amen it is christ in the formation of a bride a bride manifestation of christ amen that's the word for this day and that's christ amen i think sometimes people get uncomfortable with this kind of conversation because they think we're talking about bodies of flesh amen it's only working through bodies of flesh it's not these bodies of flesh you don't have to be tied to me chad lam as a person i'll fail you a million other ways but i believe by the grace of god there is a portion of zoe life down inside chatham the real chad lamb not the one born of earthly parents but the one that came from the mind of god amen that was predestinated that portion of the word of god was predestinated to come into manifestation in this day and when that word begins to manifest out of this corrupt body of flesh so don't look at the flesh it's not the flesh i think sometimes we start talking about pride manifestation of bride hey i meant christ manifest in bright form we start thinking flash we see the human side and the human side is still failing amen the human side is still flawed we believe by the word it's coming into perfection i'm not what i used to be amen but i'm not what i want to be the word is bringing us into greater manifestation all the time amen but that zoe life down on the inside of that vessel amen is predestinated to be manifest in this day and that manifestation of the word in this day becomes christ in our day becomes the ultimate becomes the thai post so that's why when jesus said i was hungry and you fed me i was naked and you clothed me when he said you did this to my brethren when his brethren were on earth they were they were manifest in all kinds of different bodies of all kinds of shapes and all kinds of sizes and all kinds of temperaments some may have been super likable easygoing and nice some may have been kind of cranky some might have been easy to do for some might have been hard to do for so some i you know you know what i'm saying it wasn't the body of flesh amen it was what was working through that body of flesh and what was inside that vessel amen was a life that come from god that he manifest to be men that he ordained to be manifest at that day and when that word was being made manifest amen when they were supporting that zoe life no matter what kind of vessel it was in when they were supporting it amen they they were supporting life in working with the program of god so we go we go down here a little bit and let's go to noah noah got the word for his day and noah became the manifestation of the word for his day and now salvation in noah's day was tied to noah's message so we've been through this so many times it's so simple amen but but but with a denominational mindset we get so scrupled up brother banham told us he says i just read it but we'll read it again since eden when it did there come a line of blood all the way up to calvary and from calvary tied with this line and goes on to the tie post jesus so there's a bloodline all the way to calvary and all the way from calvary that's why i've drawn this line amen and and when we think about the bloodline we know that at calvary at the cross the blood was shed but brother branham comes in the token and he makes it super clear so we can understand that now we must have not chemical properties of blood because we can no longer get that physical blood and apply that blood to us amen and say that we're under the blood he said that blood went back into the judean soil and when that blood was shed it was dropping and it was purchasing it was the purchasing power it was the purchasing price it was the exchange rate of funds for life he was purchasing back all of creation and redemption a redemption price was paid but but brother bannon said when that when that blood cell was broke the life of the blood was released and now amen we have to receive the life of the blood and that's being covered in the blood and so there's a bloodline that goes from eden to all the way to calvary and from calvary it goes on but i would like to i would like to describe this bloodline as the the blood lifeline the life of that blood which was the life of christ which was the life of god which was the life of the word and it was expressed here in noah what was expressed in noah zoe life god the word of god was expressed in noah and now that word brought salvation in that day and then we then we come down to abraham moses we come to the judges to the kings all the way down to john the baptist and as you come down through each manifestation you realize that it was this part of god's mind this lamb's book of life this zoe life this this life of christ god had foresaw it manifesting itself down through six thousand years and as it came into manifestation every time the word came into manifestation it became the ultimate for that day and it became the thai post in that day so abraham became the time post in that day his message became the typos in that day amen but when we go on from there amen now we cannot no longer hold on that's what brother benham would always say moses couldn't come preaching noah's message because noah's message was the typos in that day it was the manifestation of the life of god and noah's day but as god foresaw himself amen what's he doing he's revealing himself he's letting more of himself out all the time and as god is revealing more of his life he comes down to a manifestation that's going to be in moses's day and now in order to get a hold of the typos you've got to get a hold of the typos when it presents itself in your day you can't be in moses's day hundreds of years or even thousands or more years after noah's day and you can't get a hold of the thai post of noah's day you can't grab a hold of it friends you got to find a place a time a place to grab a hold of the thai post amen and you can't grab a hold of the thai post that was a thousand years before because you can't get a hold of it it's already been now you're standing in your day so what's the typos for your day when the same life that was in noah's message in the same life that was in moses message and the same life that goes all down through when the same life presents itself in your day that becomes the typos you get a hold of that typos when you grab ahold of that typos you are tied into the bloodline [Music] now when jesus christ comes amen and he he lives the perfect life he is everything when you look at this this left side of this line everything that was attached to that line that got a hold of the thai post in their day everything that got a hold of that was part of the life of god was was manifesting christ in their day when it come all the way down through all of that was wrapped up into one man and that man was christ jesus and as he was manifesting he became the typos for that day when he died and shed his blood amen the blood he shed was the blood that contained that life that was expressed and noah and moses and abraham and david and solomon all the way down through when that life was expressed that life was now brought into a body amen and there was created blood amen that that life would be housed in that blood and when the blood cell split the life would be freed to come back on the believer but when that blood shed everything that was attached to the pie post went free they were back under blood of bulls and goats which blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sin it can only cover it but it was the word for their day so they stayed faithful to the word for their day now when all that the law foreshadowed and all the sacrifices foreshadowed was now here in christ and he was the lamb of god and he died the sacrificial life and shed that blood amen amen what was what was what noah was believing was in christ what moses was believing was in christ that's why amen the bible said amen when christ resurrected many of the saints that slept in the ground resurrected with him when that life came up everything that was attached to that bloodline came up with him and resurrected with him why because they you know they weren't there to see jesus dying on the cross they weren't there to stand at the foot of the cross and say i believe this is the word of god noah wasn't there moses wasn't there amen but the life that was there presented itself in a portion of noah's day and noah said that's the truth that's nothing but the truth and i give my whole life to that and in moses day moses comes to another portion of the word that includes adam's day the sacrifice of the lamb that includes salvation and noah's day it's all included still in his day but when he comes to this day and god speaks to him he believes it and he acts on it amen and he gets a hold of the typos in his day and he clamps himself around at that timepost and won't let go and that is a link to that bloodline so when christ amen who was all of that life wrapped up in one shed that blood it freed everybody attached to the bloodline and when he resurrected they resurrected they they didn't even uh they didn't even have to confess beforehand that they believed that he he would be resurrected amen because they believe the portion for their day when the portion for this day manifests they get the benefits of this day so when christ resurrects everything that was attached to that line resurrects with him oh my goodness i was going to try to preach one hour i'm still going to try you bear with me love me anyhow this is a quote that we've been reading quite a bit lately out of crisis the mystery of god revealed he said now you see the seals when he was in his mediator work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that that he's redeemed and all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him so the words in that book of the lamb's book of life that book is him it's christ and the believers are all the words in the book so when christ was on calvary he was the book the book was on calvary and all the words that were in the book had been expressed down through the previous uh 4 000 years is that right and so when the book was on calvary all the words in the book were on the calvary too this is what brother branham said when the word when when all the word was in christ so when when christ was on calvary moses was in christ when when moses was expressing his portion for his day christ was in moses though the prophet said said christ was in noah christ was in moses christ was in david it was all manifesting the life of christ manifesting a portion of that book and now when all that book was here on the cross amen all the words in the book were there amen and so they were there but let's go a little further now we come down we've got peter we've got paul we've got seven church ages all right all the way down through we've got all the church age messengers all the way down through you you know it i won't take the time to write it but when you go all down through there amen when whenever you come in contact let's just say we come down here and we come to luther's dispensation all right we come to luther's dispensation amen you had to believe luther's message because luther's message in his day was that portion of the word to be made manifest in that day and when that word was made manifest in that day it became the thai post it became the link amen that ties you to this bloodline because the bloodline goes up to calvary and from calvary amen and then when we come over here to wesley's dispensation you couldn't say i know luther was right so i'm going to stick with luther i'm not so sure about wesley amen because now god was moving down the line amen the lifeline was moving the word was progressing the manifestation of the book of life was coming more and more into manifestation and now it comes in the wesley under ministry of sanctification amen and to refuse that was to refuse the lifeline because you can't go backwards you can never go backwards and get a hold of the typos you can only get a hold of the thai post in your day and the typo says that portion of the word made manifest to manifest in your day and when you get a hold of that you get a hold of the lifeline amen so now it comes all the way down through we know our day we know all of these things but what we have to realize is is when we get a hold of the lifeline it's when the word is expressed in our day and the word must be expressed in us so when i say get a hold of the lifeline i'm not talking about taking a safety belt and wrapping it around no when i get a hold of the lifeline i receive the word and i become the manifestation of the word so when we look at this bloodline and this lifeline i'm calling the lifeline coming all the way down through the life of christ amen that life is hidden i drew it red and so you can see a red line amen but it's a it's a hidden line what's hidden i shouldn't i shouldn't have drew in line to write the names above what i should have done is write the names right over top the line i should have wrote noah abraham moses why because the lifeline is hidden underneath noah underneath abraham underneath moses underneath amen all the judges and underneath the the kings and underneath the prophets what is it that lifeline is running through all those manifestations amen and it's hidden because until the end time the book was sealed and we couldn't see what we needed to see where that lifeline was running down through and when we come to the end of the church ages there was a confusion about who's right and who's wrong and denominations and and what we we see the mixed bag and the mixed vines amen because that lifeline was running down through seven church ages and it was hidden but in the end of time amen god would take and open the seals and open the book of life and when he opened the book of life we saw what was under the names amen what was under luther what was under wesley what was under pentecost what was under all of these things was the life of christ coming all the way down through it was the blood life it was the lifeline it was eternal life and now in each age as it presented itself we got a hold of the life in that day but i just want to take a quick look at just a couple places here but i want to show off abraham there would be people who would interact with abraham and abraham was part of this lifeline but connected to him would be people like abimelech is that right there would also be a connection over here to three brothers mamrie eskel and aynor these three brothers were in a coalition with abraham and they actually went with him to help him deliver lot they were his friends when he was separated on the plains of memory they were his friends and they were in a coalition with him and they were agreement to help one another and when he went down to deliver lot these three went with him to help him deliver lot they were connected to abraham they may not have been able to be connected to the lifeline but they were connected to abraham and abraham was connected to the lifeline and they helped abraham deliver lot they were in a coalition or a confederation with abraham and they helped him and they protected him and helped him protect his herds and his flocks and in this confederation they worked together in conjunction to help one another and even abraham when abraham when the king of sodom tried to give abraham all the goods abraham wouldn't take anything amen from the king of sodom but he said i won't take anything but yet what the young men eat and the portion to the three friends of mine that went down amen so they were blessed under abraham because abraham wouldn't take the spoil but he allowed a portion of the spoil to go to these three friends abraham didn't need the spoil he needed what melchizedek had and that's the only thing he needed communion with melchizedek but these three friends couldn't come into the same communion with melchizedek but they could receive a blessing because of abraham see when i say brother branham when brother branham teaches this it's not an isolated this and isolated that this is the entire bible friends he's taking this concept through the white turn judgment from the entire bible abimelech was not predestined elected seed he was not what abraham was but abimelech nonetheless was righteous he was just and when abimelech was going to do something wrong he was going to take sarah he was doing it in ignorance he didn't know amen but god came to him anyways in a dream and warned him not to take that man's wife and he said god you know the integrity of my heart you know i didn't know and he says i know the integrity of your heart that's why i warned you in a dream so that you would not sin against me i thought he was going to sin against abraham abraham was the word for his day if he would have sinned against abraham he would have sinned against him because there was a word being manifest in abraham and that word was abraham would have a promised son and brother abraham or abraham was to have that promised son through sarah his wife that was the prophecy that was the word for their day when abimelech was going to go in and interrupt the word for his day god stopped him and said i would not let you sin against me because abimelech was going to hinder the word but because he was just god would not let him hinder the word so god woke him up in a dream and warned him and and had a curse upon him and told him to have abraham pray for him and then when abraham he blessed abraham and he gave him flocks and he heard and told abraham he could live wherever he wanted in his land and then abraham blessed him when abraham blessed him god took the curse away see abimelech could not be what abraham was but because abraham would intercede for him because he was righteous god would warn him because abraham would intercede for him god would bless him so he needed abraham when he was going to interfere with abraham's manifestation he was going to interfere with the word and that brought a curse so i want to go over here i don't have time to go through very many but we'll go over here to paul this centurion that paul was put in the charge of when he was put on a boat to go to caesar this centurion was really good to paul when paul would go into a city this insured and give him liberty to go to his friends when the soldiers wanted to when they got into a storm and it looked like we were going to be shipwrecked when the soldiers wanted to kill all of the prisoners the centurion in order to save paul forbid them this centurion could never be what paul was but he preserved paul's life and he gave paul liberty to continue in his ministry he let him go visit the brethren when they stopped in this city and when they stepped this city he let him rent his own house amen and stay there for a period of time amen and this centurion was good to paul he protected paul's ministry he protected paul's life and he obeyed paul when paul come back and said you know you should have listened to me and you should not have released from the poor amen but nonetheless amen god has told me by an angel that you'll not no will be no loss of life only of the ship they all the sailors wanted to get the lifeboats out and take off and paul told the centurion if they if they don't stay with the ship they'll die and the centurion told the soldiers to go cut the ropes to all the lifeboats and let them go the centurion was obeying the prisoner oh praise god supporting the ministry protecting the life working with paul but there was another man in paul's life named demas demons was a fellow laborer paul calls him a fellow labor in the gospel [Music] demas was a preacher demas was a traveling companion to paul demas was a friend of paul and a fellow minister and they ministered together and spread the gospel together demas amen would surely have part in the book of life he was supporting life he was working and laboring in life amen but we come to and we come to an epistle that paul writes and he says demas has forsaken me loving this present world and when demas forsook paul demas had his name blotted off the book of life because if we look at this line here this line is the record of life eternal life eternal life this is also the word it's also the seed it's also christ you have many names for that line it's the life line the record of the seed zoe life of god that line is all of those things and the centurion may not have been predestinated to be on that line but he could come in contact with paul who was on that line and expressing that life and he could support and help in a time when paul would need his support and need his help is that right if that centurion wasn't there what would happen to paul amen paul had to go bound unto caesar that was part of the word also so god had to place a centurion there that may not have been predestinated seed may not have been on the line of life amen but he could be there to support paul's ministry on that line just like abraham's friends could support him so this line would be the the lamb's book of life the record of the seed but everything around it would be the book of life judas had his name in the book of life judas was a support to the ministry of jesus christ because the names in the book of life remember are there to support the life as the life's moving through and judas supported the life as the life was moving through amen and judas supported the life judas was treasurer judas did work judas was in the ministry judas healed the sick judas preached the gospel he did all those things but in the foreknowledge of god god would also know that judas would be one whose name would be on the book of life but he also knew that he'd be one whose name was blotted off the book of life so here we had judas judas was part he was part of this book of life because when he come back amen with the disciples and went to 70 and they were saying you know the spirits are subject unto us jesus says don't rejoice because the spirits are subject unto you but rejoice because your names are written in heaven so judah's name was in the book of life amen but when he turned on life when he turned on the typos when he rejected the word made life in front of him amen judas was blotted off of the book let's just do it that way and demas was blotted off of the book of life they had a part in the book of life because they were there supporting the life for a time but whenever they rejected the life they were blotted off of the book of life this is what brother branham's teaching us amen and so god has created opportunities for numerous people if they'll just support the life amen god had god has opened up in his mind and his thinking before the foundation of the world he knew there would be a fall and in being a fall amen the world is going to be populated with all kinds of people now because of hybridization no longer was it just going to be his seed borne by his predestinated will now the will of man was going to bring forth whenever man wanted to bring forth and there's going to be multitudes of people on the earth but god still had a predestinated seed that was going to come all the way down through that line so what did god do for all these other people that were going to be born because of hybridization because of the introduction of sex sexual birth and sex desire by man to have man at his own will now there's going to be all these people but if they can support life amen if they can support the life as it comes down through they can be part of the book of life amen and they can receive life let's look at a couple things brother benham says he said in christ is the mystery of god revealed watch redeemed by christ the second adam you believe he was going back home to eden with his fallen wife redeemed back home again that's christ in the church today taking his wife back see the threefold mystery god manifest in christ christ manifests in the church all together to bring back the original adam and eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood same spirit everything else the church is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood the church is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood so when the life of that blood is now present in the church manifesting the word for their day amen the church amen is the blood by the spirit amen that manifestation that word made flesh becomes the tie post and we can get a hold of the thai post in that manifestation and what does it do it links us right back here to calvary see we live over here i want to be linked to calvary do you want to be linked to calvary then in order to be linked to calvary i've got to find where that line is traveling in my day i got a in in the great mind of god when god mapped it out for 6 000 years he was bringing his life down all the way through and injecting his life into the timeline and through the timeline there was always going to be expression of the life of god amen and so now in the day that we live all the way here on the end of the gentile dispensation how do i get a hold of calvary that was 2 000 years ago there is a line that links me right back to calvary but i got to get a hold of that line and how do i know where that line is wherever the word of god for this day is made manifest is the thai post and when i get a hold of that thai post there is a lifeline a bloodline that goes all the way back to calvary see when jesus when jesus went to uh i can't remember what city it was but when he's walking through the city and he comes to a sycamore tree and he looks up and zacchaeus is up there says zacchaeus come down i'm going to your house today and he goes into zach he is his house and in zacchaeus's house amen zacchaeus begins to confess all of his sins i've done all this and i'm going to pay back if i stole anything i'll pay it back four times i'm going to give to the poor and he confesses his faults and he acknowledges he's going to make it right and jesus said salvation has come to this house today he didn't ask zacchaeus to believe anything in a former day he didn't ask zacchaeus to believe anything that would come in the future but because zacchaeus received the manifested word for his day that the high priest couldn't receive that the chief elders couldn't receive that the scribes and pharisees couldn't receive when zacchaeus could receive it confess his wrongs and repent he says salvation has come to this house today but but what if zacchaeus made a mistake later i don't think jesus is taking back his declaration of salvation amen i don't think jesus is playing a game saying zacchaeus you're saved but you know don't make a mistake and don't fail to receive me later no when zacchaeus had the capacity to recognize the living word he knew what was inside of zacchaeus he gets invited to simon's house and in simon's house amen simon pays him no respect simon gives him no uh washing of his feet no kiss no greeting amen and simon just invites him to the house but has no respect for the word made flesh but there's a little harlot woman there's a little woman's trapped and steeped in sin and she comes running in and breaks an alabaster box and washes his feet with her tears dries him with their hair and jesus looks at simon and he tells this woman though her sins are many they are all forgiving her she listen i i say this and don't get shocked at what i say jesus declared that all her sins were forgiven and we have no record in the bible of her asking forgiveness for her sins he didn't wait for her to say a sinner's prayer he didn't wait for her to ask forgiveness he didn't tell her to go to the temple there was nothing else she had to do all she had to do was recognize the word made flesh before her and she fell at his feet and began to worship the word that was made fast and she was getting a hold of the thai post amen and a few days after that that typos would go to calvary and shed blood and that shed blood was the price of her redemption but she got a hold of the typos here and jesus said he looked at her and says your faith has saved you saved by faith faith and what faith in the word that was presented to her in her day see those on the bloodline can recognize the word made flesh and they become the word made flesh and everything that supports that life and labors to bring forth that life and is working in conjunction with that life is also part of the book of life and as long as they never fight that life their name can remain on the book of life but if they ever fight against that life like judas did their name is blotted out of the book of life because it all has to do with zoe life i've already blew my one hour deal but i want to read just a couple quotes brother ben said after the bride is rapture will any foolish virgin be saved or will they all be lost no see everything will be finished for the gentile church when the bride is taken from the earth the spirit of god leaves the earth he that's filthy is filthy still he that's righteous is righteous still he that's holy is holy still amen what's he saying he's saying because the foolish virgin whatever they are they are by the time the bride goes up because when the bride leaves the earth the spirit of god leaves the earth when the spirit of god leaves the earth the blood life leaves the earth and now nobody in the gentile dispensation can change what they are they can only change what they are based off what they do with that life and remember no name was ever added to the book of life brother bram says it's very clearly at no time amen is there any record in the bible where names are being added to the book of life that was done before the foundation of the world and the book was sealed before the foundation of the world so you can't get your name on the book the only thing you can do is get your name off the book and what gets the name taken off of the book it's not smoking drinking lying committing adultery please don't throw anything at me we're more mature than that the the prophet of god has taught us better than that amen everybody comes into the world that way whether the name was on the book or not on the book i mean everybody's everybody's got that that they're disposed to those kind of things because of nature amen what get your name taken off the book there's only one thing that i know that gets your name taken off the book and that's rejecting and fighting against the life when it's presented to you because if you reject that life which is the word which is zoe life which is god which is christ which is the seed when you reject that you can have no part in life because your only link to life is this life zoe life and if you reject zoe life in your day how will you get entrance into zoe life at the white throne judgment praise god brother bem said in the second resurrection wherein the five foolish virgins come up notice that they were virgins they did not have the holy spirit so they missed being in the bride while the five wives who had oil became part of that bride but these people being a separated god-loving people and trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the lord will come up at the end of time it's not just that they wanted to do good it's they were a help in the work of the lord how were they a help i don't know god knows that they were either directly or indirectly supporting and helping the work of the lord but if they can stay true to that and never fight against the word their name can remain on the book of life they will miss the millennium which you can begin to see by these truth is much more important and wonderful than we have ever thought or believed all these people had their names in the book of life and their names remain but whose names did not remain those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be those whose names are removed that is who will lose out they will be cast into the lake of fire again in the sardisian church he says thus if god is so designed that there be those whose names are placed in a section of the lamb's book of life and cannot be erased for there the names of his bride then we must accept that if it also states that there are those whose names were placed in the record of book of life but in the foreknowledge of god they they were to fall and have their names removed we must accept that and if there are those whose names were never placed upon a record of life we must accept that also and if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of god who are his brethren then we cannot but accept that for who knoweth the mind of the lord that he should instruct him rather let us be subject in faith unto him who is our father and live further down he says i'm just going to pull just a small excerpt out of this he says then as we have previously shown there are those who stood for the bride and were an aide and a comfort to her maybe like the centurion for paul those had their names remaining on the book of life and go into life everlasting finally there are those such as pharaoh who never had their name on the book of life and these are cast into the lake of fire also thus the grain of wheat that became a plant for the harvest is the record of the church and even as not all the wheat plant is wheat seed and not all the plant is used in the harvest so with the church all the church is not the bride and neither is it all given eternal life but a part of it is gathered into the garner and a part of it is kept that it might enter into eternal life in the second resurrection and part of it which is accounted chaff is burned in the lake of fire the brother of them said this wheat plant that's been coming through to bring back the seed and harvest time the many member many member bride of jesus christ he said in the harvest time some of that seed is gathered into the garden some of that wheat plant is saved for another purpose and some of it is burnt like chaff have you ever seen them harvest wheat when they harvest wheat what's the reason they plant wheat to get wheat why was the christ seed planted to get a mini member of christ but along the way there's another valuable part of the wheat plant that is not wasted in the harvest the plant is necessary to support the life and bring it up all the way to harvest time it's all a support in the ministry of the life coming through as it matures and goes back to seed the purpose was to get seed but in harvest time if you've ever watched them harvest a field of wheat amen they'll go they'll go and they'll gather the wheat into the garden and when they get the wheat into the garner amen then they put it up in safety it goes back to the farmer's place but then that farmer will go back and he'll bail that straw because straw has another purpose for the farmer and the rest of the chaff is led to laid there the rot that's what brother branham is telling us here god had a purpose in bringing it all up it was to get wheat amen but all that that supported the life coming through he has a purpose for it too and he has a use for it in his kingdom but all that that was against and pulled away and fought the truth it it is burnt like shaft it is burnt out and so i say thank god for the book of life amen what do we say all this for like we said on sunday when we live in this life there's more going on all around us than we realize there's supernatural things there's predestinated conversations we have predestinated contact we have with people and there are people who've been predestinated to have contact with you and the foreknowledge of god he would know when you would need a support when you would need a help when you would need a system when you would need something to bring that life along amen and it was already pre-arranged in the mind of god and when we have these odd things that happen to us in life when somebody's just there when we needed to be there when they stand up for us in the face of persecution when something happens i would rejoice whenever that happens friends because there is a book of life and that book of life is a support that's surrounding the seed of life that's going through the lamb's book of life and it's all there to support the life of christ and everything that supports the life of christ can have entrance into life god is merciful god is gracious full of mercy he's created all kinds of opportunity for salvation and i say thank you lord when god foresaw his plan he knew he knew when he looked down through time and he was going to bring this to pass at this time and manifest himself in this way he knew he would need to get paul over to caesar and he knew he would need a centurion that would look after him and get him there but allow him to minister along the way oh i hope to meet that centurion someday i hope that centurion comes walking through an open gate in the city someday and i say were you that centurion that i read about in the book of acts amen praise god thank you for supporting paul amen thank you for what you've done i think it's a wonderful thing what brother brendon has taught us on the book of life it's so contrary to what the denominations teach it's so absolutely opposite amen i mean if you want to be i mean if you want to be good in your denomination you have to acknowledge that that's the only way to life this doctrine this teaching this confession these things that you say this repeating of a certain phrase that's how you come to life amen and it does not match the character of the god of this bible but what the prophet of god has taught us about the book of life exactly matches the character of the god of this bible from genesis to revelation this isn't just something that's neat amen that we get excited about because we see there's potential for other people out there and potential maybe for people that we love but when we look at it this message is christ amen it is the very nature of god and every doctrine that this prophet teaches us includes the entire nature of god they're not isolated doctrines amen doctrine of godhead and water baptism and the book of life they're not isolated doctrines that we just talk about because they're need they are absolutely portraying the very nature of god almighty and brother branham's teaching on the book of life absolutely demonstrates to us the very nature and character of god the god that brother banham talks about at white throne judgment the god that he talks about with the book of life is the god i read from genesis to revelation in this book this message is so perfect remember it's the apostle paul who told us that by faith we are children of abraham was it the apostle paul so he says by faith we are the children of abraham then if we're children of abraham then we get abraham's promise is that right because abraham's promise was to abraham and to his seed after him and by faith we as gentiles by faith by the faith seat inside of us by true faith we are abraham's children and therefore we are part of that blessing for abraham and his children we'll remember all the way back when abraham was called and god gave him his blessing he said whoever blesses you i will bless and whoever curses you i will curse tell me if brother branham's doctrine on on on the white throne judgment does not exactly match that promise to abraham which we are under by being a faith seed of abraham we come right in line with that promise and brother branham is picked up in the white throne judgment a prophecy and a promise that was placed on abraham all the way back over 4 000 years ago brought it right to the white throne judgment and exactly matches exactly what was told to abraham and we as being children of abraham by faith are under that promise whoever blesses you i will bless and whoever curses you i will curse this bible is perfect amen and this message is christ and it came to unshackle us from denominational bounds bonds that were bound around our mind to break it off so that we can see the god of this bible through the whole bible amen let's stand i'm done i didn't meet my goal but it was a very slight improvement i won't tell you how slight oh i am trying to do better on wednesday nights pray for me i love this message the more i read it the more i study it the more i read my bible the more perfect it becomes things that years ago were questions and i couldn't sort it out and pieces that didn't fit together by revelation upon revelation god keeps sliding it together and sliding it together and you realize i don't care what anybody else says or what they think about the prophet of god whether they think about brother branham's ministry or his doctrine god has so confirmed his ministry over and over and over again by this book right here there is no question in this message when god begins to lace his word together with the ministry of the prophet and somebody says 16 men didn't fall off a bridge all of a sudden it doesn't matter if 16 men fell off a bridge did you not read your bible i want to leave the message because they don't have proof 16 men fell off a bridge read the bible and read the message i mean there's no problem there's no issue this message is christ it is the very character and nature of christ it is the very mind of god amen the book is open to us now it's been opened up by the opening of the seals the restoring of the word as a bright shining light that is shining down on this word to open the bible this is why brother brahm said my bible became a new book to me it's still becoming a new book to me god is perfect friends amen let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you for your word lord it is so perfect and so beautiful lord everything that you wrote was for a purpose you laid it in there over thousands of years knowing when it would come to pass knowing when you would bring it back up and when you would tie it together oh god you amaze us lord god we thank you for sending a prophet in this day to bring the revelation of your word lord and we thank you for giving us a gift of revelation to have eyes to see and ears to hear and god we are praying for more revelation that you'll continue to unveil yourself to us out of your word and we'll see you more and more lord like we've never seen before give us that perfect vision lord god we thank you for your word we thank you for being a just god but i thank you for being a just god that's full of mercy i thank you god for having a plan of redemption and in that plan you included so many god i'm so thankful for that i pray god that you'd help us to be more resolved than ever to shine the light of the gospel to hold on to that tie post to become the word made manifest in our day and become an access point lord for others to touch you to hear of you to learn of you god how we love you we thank you for what you're doing amongst us pray you continue lord to have your way with us
