TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Brother Bram, now all the way back in 59, he's turning us back to the congregation and he's saying Jesus says, "As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be." Amen. In the revealing of the Son of Man. And now, Brother Brham's going to turn us back and show the same sign that was shown. Amen. Uh on the plains that day, he's going to show the same sign. And he says, "Now you discern what spirit this is." &gt;&gt; MANY WALKED AWAY and said, "That man's fanatical. I mean, that that that's mental telepathy. That's what whatever they went away and whatever it was that they believed. Amen. But there was a few there that said that's God. &gt;&gt; That's the SCRIPTURE BEING FULFILLED. THAT'S not just A MIRACLE. THAT'S NOT JUST A SIGN. THIS IS WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "I WOULDN'T FOLLOW OIL IN THE HANDS or blood in the hand or oil on YOUR FOREHEAD." THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE that raised up brother after brother Brandham and they had all kinds of signs. Amen. They the AA Allen had them and there was other men that had signs and they would they would get into the spirit or they would call a woman up ONE TIME AND SHE WOULD HAVE OIL IN her hands of and then that oil would be anointing oil that would heal people and they would pray for him. Brother Brandham said I wouldn't believe that sign. &gt;&gt; SO WHY WERE THEY WHY WHY IS THE BRIDE OF CHRIST SUPPOSED TO BE ACCEPTED? Brother Brandham turning his back to a crowd and discerning people and say you over here in the red dress you've got cancer. You over here you've got a BACK PROBLEM. WHY NOT believe the oil in the hand? Why not believe the blood in the hand? Why not believe the oil on the forehead? AMEN. THEY'RE ALL SUPERNATURAL SIGNS AND THEY WERE VINDICATED. THEY WERE VERIFIED. THERE'S PEOPLE TESTIFIED IT WAS TRUE AND were healed by it. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY BROTHER BAM SAID HE WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT? HE SAID BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE WORD. THE SCRIPTURE NEVER TELLS US TO LOOK FOR THAT. BUT JESUS SAID, "AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF LOT IN THE DAYS OF SODOM, SO SHALL IT BE IN THE revealing of the SON OF MAN." WHAT WAS DONE TO ABRAHAM AND HIS SEED IN THAT day is the same sign that's coming back to Abraham and his seed this day. AND THE ELECT OF GOD SAY THAT AIN'T NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; THAT WORD IS TODAY. WHAT WE SAW IS WHAT JESUS SAID AND OUR HEARTS PUT THE TWO TOGETHER AND SAY AMEN. THAT'S WHAT HAD WRIGHT WAS ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEOLOGY, WITHOUT INTELLECTUALISM, without a degree. &gt;&gt; HOW ARE WE ABLE TO do it? HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT PROOF? WHAT EVIDENCE? IT'S MORE THAN JUST SEEING A MAN MAKE DISCERNMENT. AMEN. YOU CAN SEE ALL KINDS OF SIGNS AND WONDERS. YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE DO ALL KINDS OF STUFF. BUT WHAT IS IT? THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART THAT SAYS THAT'S NOT JUST A MAN DOING A MIRACLE. THAT'S A THAT'S THE FULFILLMENT OF SCRIPTURE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT GOD PROMISED FOR THIS HOUR. THAT IS THE WORD FOR OUR DAY BEING MADE MANIFEST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And it ain't nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, DO YOU THINK THAT PLEASES GOD? IF IT PLEASED GOD WHEN HAD HE COULD DECLARE, "WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOUR HEART LEAPS UP AND SAYS,"I KNOW IT'S TRUE. I KNOW THAT'S THE SIGN OF THE MESSIAH. I KNOW THAT'S MY LORD JESUS CHRIST DOING." THAT'S NOT THAT, MAN. THAT'S GOD FULFILLING HIS OWN WORD AND SHOWING TO THE SEED OF ABRAHAM, "HE'S HERE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I love it. I love to have the privilege to say, "That's nothing but the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen.
