[0:00] When justice called for a pain man of
[0:06] sin, no one worthy could be found among
[0:13] men. But the precious son of God with a
[0:18] cross and crown of thorns paid the debt
[0:22] with the blood of the lamb.
[0:27] Oh, full by the blood of the
[0:33] lamb, free from sin, free to live. Now I
[0:40] am. And it reads on the page where my
[0:45] sins were written down. Paid in full by
[0:50] the blood of the lamb. Oh, how great.
[0:54] Oh, how great was the debt that I
[1:00] owed bound to pay for the seeds I have
[1:07] sown. But in Jesus my Lord, a great
[1:12] shepher was found my redeemed by the
[1:17] blood of the lamb.
[1:21] Oh
[1:22] pen, by the blood of the
[1:27] lamb, free from sin, free to live, now I
[1:34] am. And it reads on the page where my
[1:39] sins were written down, paid in full by
[1:43] the blood of the lamb. And it
[1:47] reads, And it reads on the page where my
[1:52] sins were written down, paid in full by
[1:57] the blood of the lamb.
[2:02] [Music]
[2:21] In the rock the mother builds her place
[2:26] of
[2:28] rest. Keeps it safe from many wind and
[2:33] storm.
[2:38] But there comes a time when she is
[2:42] stirring up her
[2:46] nest and the elet really wants to
[2:54] know. M say what's going on? Why this
[3:01] doesn't feel like home?
[3:04] I am not to
[3:07] comfortable
[3:12] here. And the mother flaps her
[3:16] wings, placing them against the wind,
[3:21] full of love, she answers to her
[3:27] boy. Cuz you're an eagle.
[3:34] You were born to soar up in the sky,
[3:43] trusting in your wings to rise and fly

[4:26] All my life I've tried to live like
[4:30] others, but I
[4:33] failed. I couldn't find myself was out
[4:38] of place.
[4:43] I was trying hard to quench the thirst
[4:48] that I had
[4:51] felt with her worldly or religious ways.
[5:00] But the Lord came
[5:03] tenderly, called me to my
[5:08] destiny and revealed his attribute in
[5:13] [Music]
[5:16] me. I became my
[5:21] identified with the bird that's of my
[5:24] kind.
[5:26] I could hear him
[5:28] calling from
[5:32] above. Cuz you're an eagle.

[5:42] [Music]
[5:46] skies, trusting in the word to rise in

[6:50] his promise.
[6:54] I am joining him in this celestial

[7:07] I was born to soar up in the
[7:14] sky, trusting in the word to rise in
[7:20] flying

[9:40] Fill
[9:42] the mighty
[9:46] [Music]
[9:49] needy to a God.
[9:55] I've

[9:58] all the
[10:01] windows and I
[10:04] throw wide
[10:07] every
[10:11] door. Won't you
[10:14] come
[10:16] inside? Dear
[10:18] Lord, I need you
[10:22] [Music]
[10:24] more. Lord, my
[10:27] heart,
[10:28] Lord, my
[10:31] heart is
[10:33] [Music]
[10:35] open. Won't you
[10:39] come inside?
[10:45] Build up
[10:46] all
[10:51] my
[10:53] ever
[10:54] to abide.
[10:59] I've

[11:02] all the
[11:05] windows and I

[11:16] th you
[11:18] come
[11:20] inside you Lord.
[11:23] I need you more and more.
[11:31] Amen. God bless you all this evening.
[11:34] And let's just bow our heads in a word
[11:36] of
[11:37] prayer. Dear heavenly father, we thank
[11:39] you for gathering us together once
[11:41] again. And Lord, we've come to hear your
[11:44] word. And I pray God that you'd speak to
[11:46] our hearts through your word. Lord, may
[11:49] you speak to us, Lord, the words of
[11:52] eternal life that give us life and bring
[11:54] us into a greater manifestation of that
[11:56] life. Give us all ears to hear this
[11:58] evening as we receive from you. I pray
[12:01] that you bless us in all that we say and
[12:03] do. And may you receive worship. May you
[12:05] receive glory. May you receive honor as
[12:07] you take your preeminence among us. We
[12:09] ask that you bless this evening, Lord.
[12:12] Give us the blessing upon our ears and
[12:14] hearts. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God
[12:18] bless you. We're going to let you have
[12:19] your seats for just a minute. Thank you,
[12:23] musicians. Uh, today was the funeral for
[12:26] brother Elmer Schwarz's dad, and I know
[12:28] you've been praying for their family. I
[12:29] know many of you were able to go.
[12:31] Several were able to go last night to
[12:32] the viewing, and several were able to go
[12:34] today. So, thank you for those who were
[12:36] able to go. And everyone else, if you
[12:38] can just remember to keep their family
[12:39] in prayer. Many of you know Elmer's mom,
[12:42] Irene, and just keep her in prayer as
[12:44] well. and all of his brothers and their
[12:45] families as they mourn the loss of their
[12:48] father. But God bless you for those who
[12:51] were able to support them. Also wanted
[12:53] to give you an update. Brother Ron
[12:55] Garvin and uh brother John Brooks are
[12:58] getting ready to travel to Japan for the
[13:00] final stop and the final leg of their
[13:02] long journey. And so they'll be uh from
[13:05] tonight on they'll be in Japan until uh
[13:10] Sunday night. They travel back. They'll
[13:11] get here Monday night. So, just keep
[13:13] them in prayer. They've had a long,
[13:15] tiring, hard trip, but they're doing
[13:18] good. They're in good spirits. I heard
[13:19] from Brother Ron today. Uh, even at one
[13:22] point, Brother Ron lost his voice. He
[13:23] was supposed to speak at Brother
[13:24] Dondan's couldn't. Brother Dondan had to
[13:26] fill in for him at his own anniversary
[13:28] meeting, and then he had a service, I
[13:30] think, the next day, but his voice came
[13:32] back for that. And so, he's doing better
[13:34] now. So, we just keep them in prayer.
[13:37] And, uh, I know they were both very
[13:39] excited to be with the believers again
[13:40] in Japan. And so I'm excited to hear
[13:43] about their trip when they get back. So
[13:45] just keep them in prayer. Also wanted to
[13:47] let you know that this Sunday, Brother
[13:50] Jason Demar will be here with us
[13:51] ministering for us. So brother Jason
[13:53] hasn't been here for many, many years.
[13:55] So it's exciting to have him back. And
[13:57] so he'll be coming in ministering for
[13:59] us. He's just making a quick trip just
[14:00] jumping in ministering and going back on
[14:02] Monday. So we will be happy to have him
[14:06] here with
[14:07] us. Tonight we're going to go to part
[14:09] three on is your life worthy of the
[14:12] gospel. So if you have your book or if
[14:15] you have your phone or tablet or however
[14:18] you're reading through it, we'll go into
[14:19] part three. I've been enjoying this book
[14:21] and I've been enjoying these tape
[14:23] services. I always do. Every year I
[14:25] always enjoy it. It's something special
[14:26] that I look forward to and it's
[14:28] something that uh we share together. I'm
[14:31] going to uh go back and hit just a quick
[14:34] review before we get into our questions.
[14:36] And so if you'll take your book or your
[14:38] electronic form of the table, either
[14:41] one. Let's first go to
[14:46] uh paragraph 30 on page eight. Page 8,
[14:49] paragraph
[14:52] 30. And brother Benham begins when he
[14:54] starts into a sermon. He starts he said,
[14:56] "Lord Jesus, any man physically or woman
[14:58] or child can move back the pages of this
[15:01] Bible, but there's no one that can
[15:03] reveal it but you." I I pray Lord uh of
[15:06] taking this text as it's placed upon my
[15:09] heart to send out across the nations for
[15:11] the people that they might know what
[15:12] type of life is required of them to
[15:14] live. So these answering the question of
[15:17] what type of life is worthy of the
[15:19] gospel for so many has asked me is a
[15:22] Christian life a life of church service
[15:24] is it helping the poor the needy or is
[15:26] it a constant member is it a loyal
[15:29] loyalty to a church and such questions
[15:32] father may the correct answer come
[15:34] tonight through these words so that's
[15:36] what brother Benham's trying to convey
[15:38] to us this message of what kind of life
[15:40] is it is it take to live a Christian
[15:42] life let's go to uh paragraph 36 on the
[15:45] next page, the bottom of page
[15:47] nine. So, now we see when God gives a
[15:50] man an invitation and to do something or
[15:52] to receive the invitation that he gives
[15:54] him and he returns it down, then there's
[15:57] nothing left after mercy is spurned but
[15:59] judgment. So, when brother starts to
[16:01] break down what kind of life is worthy
[16:03] of the of the gospel, he starts to show
[16:06] us that a life that the life that's not
[16:08] worthy of the gospel is the one that
[16:10] turns down their day of invitation. when
[16:12] the invitation comes and they turn it
[16:14] down and their invitation to what? To
[16:16] the spiritual feast of their day. And we
[16:18] know that the message of the hour is a
[16:20] spiritual feast of our day. And he says
[16:22] when they turn it down, they're not
[16:23] worthy. And so let's go now to
[16:27] uh
[16:29] uh
[16:31] paragraph
[16:36] 59. Yeah, paragraph 59 on page 14.
[16:43] He says, uh, something some kind of
[16:46] excuse. It's too hot. I'm too tired. I
[16:48] will tomorrow. Just some kind of excuse.
[16:50] That's all they do. By rejecting the day
[16:52] of visitation, it separates you from
[16:55] God. So, uh, it's clear brother Benham
[16:59] is not talking about, uh, smoking and
[17:02] drinking and all these things. He
[17:03] breaking it down so simple. Amen. To
[17:06] receive your day of visitation and the
[17:08] invitation to the feast or to reject it.
[17:11] And there's a lot of things that come
[17:12] out of that decision and out of that and
[17:14] there's a lot of things behind that. But
[17:16] he's making it very very simple in this
[17:17] part of the message. And we'll hear a
[17:19] little bit more tonight on that. Let's
[17:21] go to paragraph
[17:22] 129 if we
[17:24] could. Paragraph
[17:31] 129 on the bottom of page
[17:34] 25. Paragraph 129. Christian is not a
[17:37] tool or some kind of mechanical wrench
[17:39] to a great big religious regime. That's
[17:41] right. A Christian is not some kind of
[17:43] tool that keeps a religious organization
[17:45] moving. A Christian that is not a
[17:47] Christian. A Christian is to be
[17:48] Christlike. And a Christian cannot be a
[17:51] Christian until Christ comes into the
[17:53] man, the life of Christ in him. Then it
[17:55] produces the life that Christ lived and
[17:57] you do the things that Christ did. What
[17:59] am I talking about? Personal
[18:01] relationship to Christ. What is it? Is
[18:04] your life worthy of the gospel? Amen.
[18:06] It's to receive the life of Jesus
[18:08] Christ. That's what a Christian a
[18:09] Christian is doesn't mean to be part of
[18:10] an organization or part of a group. A
[18:12] Christian is to receive the life of
[18:14] Christ. Amen. So, let's go now to
[18:18] paragraph
[18:20] 143 on page
[18:23] 28. I'm just grabbing just a couple
[18:26] little highlights as we've gone through
[18:27] the book already. And in paragraph 143
[18:30] says, "When this takes place, the thing
[18:32] you'll do, then you will find out that
[18:34] the spirit that comes in you from the
[18:36] new birth, you'll believe and do
[18:38] everything that God says in his word is
[18:39] for you to do. And everything that the
[18:41] Bible quotes for you to do, you'll
[18:43] punctuate it with amen. And you'll not
[18:45] stop day or night until you receive it."
[18:47] That's right. That's right. And in all
[18:49] this time, you'll certainly above
[18:50] everything bear the fruit of the spirit.
[18:53] Let's jump down to paragraph 145.
[18:56] If it's the word and God said so, that
[18:58] spirit in you will cope with that word
[19:00] every time because genuine Holy Spirit
[19:02] will cope with the word because the word
[19:04] is life and spirit. Jesus said, "My
[19:06] words are life." And if you've got
[19:08] eternal life and he is the word, how can
[19:10] the word deny the word? What kind of a
[19:13] person would you make God? That's one
[19:15] thing to know that you're a Christian
[19:17] when you can fully agree upon every word
[19:19] of God. Remember, that's one of our
[19:21] questions. How can you know that? Uh,
[19:23] that's one thing to know that you're a
[19:25] Christian when you can fully agree upon
[19:27] every word of God. Amen. Because the
[19:31] same spirit that wrote the word is the
[19:33] same spirit will say amen to the word.
[19:35] Let's go to paragraph 155 on page
[19:40] 30. Paragraph
[19:44] 155. On page 30, we'll skip the first
[19:47] paragraph and go to the second. That
[19:49] word is the truth. Right? And the spirit
[19:52] of God will recognize his own writing.
[19:54] He's identified by his writing. It
[19:56] speaks of him. And you're identified by
[19:59] believing it. And it gives you your
[20:00] credentials of
[20:02] identification. Praise be to I love when
[20:04] the brother makes it so simple. Amen.
[20:07] And remember, we can't believe unless
[20:10] there's been a seed of predestination in
[20:11] us to believe with. Amen. So, we can't
[20:13] even take pride in ourselves and be able
[20:16] to believe. All we can do is be super
[20:17] thankful.
[20:19] We can just rejoice in the mercy and
[20:21] grace of God in our lives. Let's go to
[20:22] paragraph 190
[20:27] now. Paragraph 190 on the bottom of page
[20:35] 36 says, I want to hold that word a
[20:38] minute. Though they call themselves
[20:39] Christian, they adopt creeds, man-made
[20:41] creeds to take the place of God's word.
[20:43] So they can take the creed because the
[20:45] man made it. But they're afraid to lay
[20:47] their faith out there in the God that
[20:49] they claimed that they love. That's
[20:51] right. And then you say that life is
[20:52] worthy of the gospel. Can't be. Though
[20:55] they be church members, but that's not
[20:57] worthy of the gospel. No, indeed. The
[20:59] gospel. Jesus said, "Go into all the
[21:01] world and preach the gospel to every
[21:03] creature. These signs shall follow the
[21:05] believers." And when you deny that to
[21:07] follow the believers, how can you have
[21:09] life? No matter. You might not never say
[21:12] a bad word. You might keep all the ten
[21:14] commandments. That won't have one thing
[21:16] to do with it. It's still not worthy of
[21:18] the gospel. See, it couldn't be. Those
[21:20] priests kept that and still was not
[21:22] worthy. He said, "You are of your
[21:23] father, the devil. Who could lay a
[21:25] finger on one of the men?" One guilty
[21:28] mark and they were stoned without mercy.
[21:30] Holy men. And Jesus said, "You're of
[21:32] your father, the devil." And the gospel
[21:34] came in, too. So, brother Rem showing us
[21:37] it doesn't it's not based on good
[21:39] behavior. You may be able to keep all
[21:42] rules and all forms of commandments, but
[21:44] if you deny part of the word, that's not
[21:46] a life that's worthy of the gospel. And
[21:48] now, Brother Bam's not saying that it
[21:50] doesn't matter with the life you live.
[21:52] That's the part we're going to get in
[21:53] today. He's going to show us it matters
[21:55] exactly the life you live. But then we
[21:57] have to realize it's not something I've
[21:59] done. It's something I surrendered to.
[22:01] It's not a life I live. It's a life he
[22:03] comes in and lives in me. And that's
[22:05] what he's going to show us this next
[22:06] time around. That was what was different
[22:09] than the Pharisees and then the
[22:11] fishermen who were converted in the
[22:12] upper room by the new birth. They begin
[22:14] to live the life of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[22:17] Not the way the Pharisees did it. They
[22:19] did it by what was inside of them
[22:20] bubbling up and coming to life. All
[22:23] right. Uh let's go to our questions now
[22:27] uh on this last part. Our first
[22:32] question is going to be if the gospel is
[22:35] right, what should we do about
[22:38] it? If the gospel is right, what should
[22:42] we do about it?
[22:58] If the gospel is right, what should we
[23:00] do about it? Now remember, you may
[23:03] already try to cut ahead and answer the
[23:05] question. There's a lot of right answer,
[23:06] but we're looking for what's coming out
[23:07] of this message in this part we're
[23:09] listening to. Number two, what will keep
[23:12] the seed from living? What will keep the
[23:15] seed from living?
[23:28] Number two is what will keep the seed
[23:30] from living? And now part three, our
[23:33] question three. What is the only way to
[23:36] live a life that is worthy? What is the
[23:39] only way to live a life that is worthy?
[23:46] While you finish writing that, I just
[23:47] want to say how much I appreciated the
[23:49] song special of those three young men.
[23:51] That was quite a blessing for me.
[23:59] Amen. All right. I'd like to begin uh by
[24:04] reading the scriptures. So, if we could
[24:05] stand and take our
[24:07] Bibles and go to Luke chapter
[24:11] 14. I want us to be reminded of the
[24:13] scripture. Brother Benham starts
[24:15] with as he begins this
[24:18] sermon
[24:21] Luke chapter
[24:31] 14 Luke 14 verse
[24:36] 16 Then said he unto him a certain man
[24:39] made a great supper and bade many and
[24:42] sent his servants at supper for time to
[24:44] say to them that were bidden, come for
[24:46] all things are now ready. And they all
[24:48] with one accord sent consent began all
[24:52] with one consent began to make excuse.
[24:54] The first said unto him, I have bought a
[24:56] piece of ground and I must needs go and
[24:58] see it. I pray thee have me excused. And
[25:01] another said, I have bought five yolk of
[25:02] oxen and I go to prove them. I pray thee
[25:05] have me excused. And another said, I
[25:07] have married a wife and therefore I
[25:09] cannot come.
[25:11] So that servant came and showed his lord
[25:13] these things. Then the master of the
[25:15] house being angry said to his servant,
[25:17] "Go out quickly into the streets and the
[25:19] lanes of the city and bring in hither
[25:21] the poor and the maimed and the halt and
[25:24] the blind." And the servant said, "Lord,
[25:27] it is done as thou has commanded, and
[25:29] yet there is room." And the Lord said
[25:31] unto the servant, "Go out into the
[25:32] highways and hedges and compel them to
[25:34] come in that my house may be filled. For
[25:38] I say unto you that none of those men
[25:40] which were bidden shall taste of my
[25:42] supper. We can turn from here over to
[25:44] Matthew
[25:45] 22 refers to this
[25:49] uh as well in Matthew 22. And I'm just
[25:53] going to read three verses. Matthew 22
[25:55] starting at verse 8 says, "Then saith he
[25:59] to his servants, the wedding is ready,
[26:01] but they which are bidden are not
[26:02] worthy." This is where brother gets his
[26:04] title. They're not worthy. What made
[26:06] them not worthy? They had some excuse
[26:09] that prevented them from taking the
[26:11] invitation.
[26:14] Verse nine, go ye therefore into the
[26:16] highways, and as many as you shall find,
[26:18] bid them to the marriage. So those
[26:20] servants went out into the highway and
[26:22] gathered together all as many as they
[26:24] found, both bad and good. And the
[26:26] wedding was furnished with
[26:28] guests. That's still my favorite part of
[26:31] that scripture, both bad and good. Amen.
[26:34] He wasn't looking for those with
[26:35] excellent conduct or high moral
[26:38] standard, those who could conduct
[26:40] themselves better than anybody else. He
[26:42] was just looking for somebody that would
[26:44] bid the call, that would come to the
[26:47] call. That's what he's been looking for.
[26:49] Amen. God bless you as you take your
[26:51] seats and we'll go ahead and be begin
[26:54] the tape.
[26:57] I passed by the other day. No disregards
[26:59] to these two men. I looked over there
[27:01] and there was a great picture there at
[27:03] Tulsa, Oklahoma. Or old Roberts knew a
[27:06] place coming a seminary to educate
[27:08] ministers. It's going to cost and I know
[27:10] Dimash Karen, brother Carl Williams and
[27:12] them that are on the board of trustees
[27:14] of it. $50
[27:16] million with a $3 million building a
[27:19] Pentecostal boy. That's a great lot that
[27:22] God has done for him. Now I think me
[27:24] with the seminary, I'm against it to
[27:27] begin with. And I said, "The future home
[27:30] of old Roberts great seminary went on
[27:33] down the road. There was a great modern
[27:36] thing." And old Roberts in a little
[27:38] ragged tent come to my meeting over in
[27:41] Kansas City, Kansas. It said the future
[27:43] home of Tommy Osborne. Oh man, about a
[27:46] three or four million dollar place going
[27:47] up like that. And there Tommy Osburn,
[27:50] one of the finest Christian man. He's a
[27:52] real man. A real godscent man. Stood
[27:54] right across the street there. a little
[27:56] nervous boy, little boy and girl in a
[27:58] car run around. I said, "Brother
[27:59] Brandon, I was there when I seen that
[28:00] maniac run out. I seen you point your
[28:02] finger in his face and say, "In the name
[28:04] of Jesus Christ, come out of it. I seen
[28:05] you fall across your feet." After he his
[28:08] prophecy, he said, "Tonight, I'll knock
[28:09] you out in the middle of that audience
[28:11] of 6,500 people." And said, "I seen you
[28:13] stand there, never raised a voice and
[28:15] said, in the name of the Lord, because
[28:17] that you have challenged the spirit of
[28:19] God tonight, you'll fall over my feet."
[28:20] He said, "I'll show you whose feet I
[28:22] fall over." And I said, "Come out of
[28:24] him, Satan." me and just fell backwards
[28:25] and pinned my feet right to the floor.
[28:27] He said, "God is God, brother. That's
[28:29] all right." So, I've had myself nailed
[28:31] in the house for two or three days. He
[28:32] don't pull no punches. He'll tell about
[28:34] it. He's not ashamed of it. So, do you
[28:36] think I got a gift of healing? I said,
[28:37] "Forget it, Tommy. You sent to preach
[28:39] the gospel. Go preach it. Go with
[28:41] brother Bosworth there." I looked there
[28:43] and I seen I started before both of
[28:46] those. I thought, "There's Oral Roberts
[28:48] with 500 machines that not even a human
[28:52] hand touches the letters.
[28:55] $4 million in a mail last
[28:58] year. 4
[29:01] million 1/4 of all the money that was
[29:04] taken up in the whole Christian world
[29:06] over 1/4 of the money and all Christian
[29:10] come into one
[29:13] man. What a place. I went out there to
[29:15] see it and now Oral is my brother. My
[29:18] love him. He's a real fella, real guy.
[29:21] And I love him and he just thinks the
[29:24] world of me and I do of him too. We just
[29:25] don't agree on on scripture. And Tommy
[29:28] Osbert not a better. I just think the
[29:31] world of me is one of the finest men
[29:32] that I've met. Tommy Osford and those
[29:34] men. I thought when I went into their
[29:36] office and seen what they had, I think
[29:38] I'd be ashamed for him to come see mine.
[29:41] One little typewriter and us trying to
[29:43] get the letters out and what a thing
[29:45] sitting the end of a trailer at that
[29:47] time. I thought, what would that be? And
[29:49] I walked out and I thought,
[29:51] well, future home of Or Roberts, the
[29:55] future home of Tommy Osborne, one don't
[29:57] speak to the other one. So I went down
[29:59] the road and I thought, well, what about
[30:01] me? And something said, look up.
[30:06] Lord, yes, Lord, let me lay my treasures
[30:09] in heaven. Well, there's where my heart
[30:11] is. Now, I'm not saying that for pity.
[30:14] I'm just saying that because it happened
[30:16] and God knows that that's right.
[30:19] Where is your treasures? Do you want to
[30:21] be some great somebody? If you are,
[30:23] you're nobody. You get to a place that
[30:26] you don't want to be a great somebody.
[30:28] You want to be a humble little servant
[30:29] to Christ. That's the way out. That's
[30:32] all. Brother Boise and them is farming a
[30:35] church in Chicago. They just had to give
[30:37] up the Philadelphia church to that
[30:39] denomination. Now they're talking about
[30:41] getting some godly coat back like this,
[30:43] some DD. I said, "You're on your road
[30:44] out. If you want to find a real pastor
[30:46] for that church, get a little old humble
[30:48] guy can hardly read his name and his
[30:50] heart's on fire for God. Just think that
[30:52] guy, that's the one you want to get.
[30:53] Somebody don't know all these things.
[30:55] Somebody won't dictate and drive and
[30:57] throw you into all kinds of debts and
[30:58] everything else and just feed you the
[31:00] word of God. That's the kind of a person
[31:02] to get. So, they won't come to the
[31:04] spiritual feast. I got to close. I've
[31:06] went over time now. In about 6 minutes,
[31:08] we'll be dismissing. The Lord
[31:10] willing. I hear some say, "But brother
[31:13] Brandham, you better back up on that
[31:15] statement saying the people are not
[31:16] neurotics." This people are not
[31:18] neurotics. They are only
[31:20] educated. They're educated
[31:23] neurotics. That's
[31:25] right. They're not neurotics. They're
[31:28] educated. Then I want to ask you a
[31:29] question. See, understand? I want to ask
[31:32] you a question. Please explain their
[31:35] actions of today. If they're not
[31:37] neurotics,
[31:39] tell me what makes them act like they do
[31:41] if they're not
[31:43] neurotics. Ever fell pulling for his
[31:45] denomination greedy?
[31:47] Jesus wasn't like that.
[31:50] He wasn't no hurry about
[31:53] nothing. He wasn't greedy. He was our
[31:56] example. Crime the nation. The nation's
[32:00] got more crime than it ever had. And
[32:03] what's wrong?
[32:05] Teenagers, church members taking lives,
[32:08] man shooting their wives and family,
[32:10] burying up their children. Look at the
[32:12] crime wave. They're not
[32:15] neurotics. And what's the matter? What's
[32:18] your actions? Power crazy nations.
[32:21] Everyone want to take care of the the
[32:23] rest and make it one flag. One nation
[32:24] that be their flag and their nation.
[32:27] Power crazy
[32:29] immorality. While the world's more
[32:31] immoral than it ever was. Nude women on
[32:33] the
[32:35] streets. Nude women that say they're in
[32:38] their right mind, they can't be. They
[32:42] just can't
[32:43] be. Listen, there was one person in the
[32:46] Bible stripped their clothes off. That
[32:48] was Legion. He was out of his mind. When
[32:52] Jesus found him and give him his right
[32:53] mind, he put on his clothes.
[32:57] Right. What makes you strip your clothes
[33:00] off? The devil. Amen.
[33:02] That's right.
[33:04] Then say they're not
[33:06] neurotics. Start down the street here
[33:08] and drive four city blocks without
[33:10] seeing a nude woman and come back and
[33:11] tell me.
[33:15] All
[33:16] right. Find out. Then you say they're
[33:20] not. Then what's wrong?
[33:23] It can't be in the right mind. A
[33:25] right-minded woman wouldn't do that.
[33:27] She's got better sense. She knows what
[33:29] she's putting herself out. A bunch of
[33:31] lust devils out there
[33:34] just dirty, filthy, sloppy,
[33:38] drunky,
[33:40] man murderers and everything
[33:43] else. You say the world is drinking more
[33:46] liquor now. They spend more money for
[33:48] liquor in the United States than they
[33:50] spend for groceries. I think it's I
[33:52] forget how many times more the alcohol
[33:55] debt cost each year in the nation than
[33:57] it did. And what does alcoholism do?
[33:59] send you to the insane
[34:02] institution. Cancer when the medical
[34:04] doctors from around the world write in
[34:07] the magazines and tell you cancer by the
[34:10] caros cigarettes, put it on rats and
[34:12] prove that it gives you lung cancer. 70%
[34:16] of them take lung cancer from smoking
[34:18] cigarettes and them women of man will
[34:20] puff them right down and blow up your
[34:23] face. If that's not neurotics, what is
[34:25] neurotics?
[34:28] When the gospel of Jesus Christ can be
[34:32] preached and proved and the God of
[34:34] heaven in the form of his pillar of
[34:36] power wave over the people and show that
[34:39] Jesus Christ is in the last session of
[34:41] his coming giving them the last sign and
[34:43] laugh at it and make fun of it and call
[34:44] themselves church members and then say
[34:46] they're not neurotics.
[34:48] Explain that. But times keeps on going
[34:52] but it's asked if they're not neurotic.
[34:53] Sure they're educated neurotic. It's
[34:56] exactly explain their conditions. They
[34:59] can't. They cut their
[35:02] hair, wear their worldly clothes, walk
[35:06] out on the street like that. And God's
[35:08] Bible warns against and even forbids a
[35:11] woman to even pray with bob hair. That's
[35:12] right.
[35:14] And says that a man and she does that,
[35:16] she claims herself to her husband that
[35:18] she's immoral herself and he has a
[35:20] perfect right there to give her a
[35:21] divorce and send her away from him. It's
[35:24] exactly right. The word of God saying
[35:25] that and a woman hear that and continue
[35:27] to wear short hair and call herself a
[35:29] Christian. If that isn't a neurotic,
[35:31] what is a neurotic?
[35:33] I want somebody tell me what a neurotic
[35:35] is then. Amen.
[35:37] Yes, they're neurotics. Highly educated
[35:41] degrees, college. We put more time on
[35:43] educating our children to to algebra and
[35:46] biology than we have to the Bible and
[35:48] Jesus Christ. There ain't a kid in this
[35:51] country can't tell you who David
[35:52] Crockett is. There is a third of them
[35:54] can tell you who Jesus Christ is that
[35:57] it's not neurotics. Certainly it is. How
[36:00] we could go on and on and on they
[36:03] do. Just remember and the churches
[36:06] endorse
[36:08] it when the Bible condemns it. Is a
[36:11] ministry neurotics educated neurotics.
[36:15] It's exactly churches endorse it.
[36:20] remember
[36:21] Lot. He was a smart man. Look at him
[36:24] just a minute now. Don't let's not
[36:26] excuse me for run just a couple minutes
[36:28] old. This is this is too important. It's
[36:31] going out on you. Come to hear me make
[36:33] this tape.
[36:35] Look, just stop a minute. Pray just a
[36:38] second in your heart. Lord, let me see
[36:40] it. Open your understanding. May God do
[36:43] it. Look at the Let's take this nation
[36:45] alone. Let's see what God said. The
[36:49] Bible said that the sins of Sodom vexed
[36:52] the righteous soul of Lot daily. He just
[36:55] didn't have the plain nerve enough to
[36:58] stand out against it. Is that right? He
[37:01] couldn't do it for he was the mayor of
[37:03] the
[37:04] city. He couldn't. But the Bible said
[37:07] that the sins of the of the Sodommites
[37:10] vexed his soul. He knowed it was wrong,
[37:13] but he didn't have nerve to do it to
[37:16] stand out against it. Now look how many
[37:19] lots in America yesterday reading their
[37:23] Bible to prepare their message for the
[37:25] day and run across the water baptism in
[37:28] the name of Jesus Christ. How many of
[37:30] them run across the baptism of the Holy
[37:32] Ghost? Jesus Christ is saying yesterday
[37:34] forever. Mark 16, these signs shall
[37:36] follow them that believe. John 14:12, he
[37:40] that believeth on me, the works that I
[37:41] do shall he do also. If you abide me in
[37:44] my word and you ask what you will, it
[37:46] shall be done. How many Lot saw that?
[37:51] But because of their excuse of their
[37:54] denomination, it look out and see in the
[37:57] Bible. Look at their congregation of
[37:59] bob-haired women and they know the Bible
[38:01] condemns it. look going down the street
[38:03] at their own church members going down
[38:06] the street with shorts on and they know
[38:09] the words against it, but they haven't
[38:12] got the nerve to call out against it.
[38:15] But yet the man professing to be a
[38:17] Christian is so within he cries out
[38:20] against it, but he hasn't got the nerve.
[38:23] If that ain't modern Sodom, where is it
[38:25] at?
[38:26] God give us somebody that'll cry out
[38:28] against it. That's right. Like John the
[38:31] Baptist said the axe is laid to the root
[38:33] of the
[38:34] tree. It's what we need today. Watch
[38:38] they're modern Sodom. Remember see the
[38:42] whole land has become a modern Sodom
[38:44] Gamor. Lot again living on over. No
[38:48] living it all over for his honest
[38:51] convictions tells him by the word that
[38:53] he's wrong.
[38:56] Look in Chicago, greater Chicago and
[38:58] then 300 preachers sitting there and the
[39:00] Lord told me that night what they was
[39:01] going to do. They had a trap set for me.
[39:04] Me go on over there. I went and told
[39:06] brother Carlson I said you'll not have
[39:08] it in that hotel. You'll have ticket to
[39:10] another place and it' be a green room
[39:11] and they got a trap set for me have
[39:13] brother Carlson. He dropped his head. He
[39:15] sat there in my office a few days ago
[39:17] for me to come Chicago me and said I'll
[39:18] never forget that brother Brandon. And I
[39:21] said they got a trap set for me. Why
[39:23] brother Carlson? Are you afraid to tell
[39:24] me why? you and Tommy
[39:26] Hicks. They dropped their head. I said,
[39:27] Tommy, why won't you go speak? Said I
[39:29] couldn't do it. I said, I thought you
[39:31] said you'd do me a favor. I said, last
[39:33] night the Lord told me, you're going
[39:35] down there today and you find out you're
[39:36] not going to get that building. You're
[39:38] going to another building. Dr. Me will
[39:40] be sitting on this side of that colored
[39:41] man, his wife, and sings will be sitting
[39:42] right here and so forth where they all
[39:44] be sitting. I said there'd be a Buddha
[39:45] priest
[39:46] there. And I said, now find out. They
[39:50] got it against me because I preached the
[39:52] water baptism in the name of our Lord
[39:54] Jesus Christ. They got it against me
[39:56] because I preached the serpent seed and
[39:58] against the evidence that every man
[40:00] speaks with tongues has got the Holy
[40:02] Ghost and things. I said, "Come down and
[40:03] watch God." Got in there. They went down
[40:06] there and the very two hours or better.
[40:09] Sometime that afternoon they called up
[40:11] brother Carson and he said the guy that
[40:13] let him have that and paid a down
[40:15] payment on it said we have to cancel
[40:17] because the manager said he'd already
[40:19] promised it to a van for that night or
[40:21] that morning and they couldn't have it.
[40:24] So we went out to the town and country
[40:26] and that morning when we got in there
[40:27] and stood in there and I brother Carlson
[40:30] said one thing you brethren might
[40:31] disagree with brother Brandon but said
[40:33] he's not scared to say what he believes.
[40:35] He said, "He told me these things would
[40:37] happen just exactly the way they are."
[40:40] He said, "Now, here he is. Let him speak
[40:42] for himself. I stuck the scripture. I'm
[40:44] not disobedient to the heavenly vision."
[40:45] As Paul said, I said, "You've got it in
[40:47] for me for a water baptism in the name
[40:49] of Jesus Christ." Better than 300 of you
[40:51] introduce yourself as Dr. So and So, and
[40:53] Dr. So and So, I said, "I haven't even
[40:55] got a grammar school education, but I
[40:58] challenge any man here to bring your
[41:00] Bible and stand here by my side and deny
[41:02] one of the words that's been said."
[41:03] Amen. You got no tape out here if you
[41:06] want to hear it. That was the quietest
[41:08] crowd you ever heard. I said, "What's
[41:10] the matter? Is there anybody here
[41:13] tonight was in that morning meeting?
[41:14] Let's see you hold your hand." "Yeah,
[41:16] sure. Look all around." Hallelujah. I
[41:18] said, "Then if you can't support it,
[41:20] then keep off my back." Right. A lot of
[41:23] howling when you're around the corner,
[41:25] but come face to face with the issue.
[41:26] It's different, right? It's that man
[41:29] went out. Tommy Hicks said, "I want 300
[41:32] of those tapes to send to every print
[41:34] tener trintarian preacher I know of."
[41:36] That man shaking my hand said, "We'll
[41:37] come down to the tabernacle and be
[41:39] baptized over where they at." That's
[41:42] right. Excuses.
[41:45] I can't do it. My denomination won't let
[41:47] me do it. I married a wife. I bought a
[41:49] ox of yolk or yolk of ox rather. I I
[41:52] bought a piece of ground. I got to go
[41:54] look at it. See some of those things
[41:56] like excuses. Is that right? Is that
[41:59] life worthy of the gospel?
[42:02] If the gospel is right, let's shout out
[42:04] everything we got and live for it.
[42:06] Praise the Lord. Be a Christian. Yes,
[42:09] sir. Amen. Notice now if it's
[42:14] closed, but their excuses is their
[42:16] creeds and their denominations. It's
[42:18] like a tree. I was looking at Brother
[42:20] Banks the other day. I had a a pine tree
[42:23] I planted when I first moved up there
[42:24] about oh about 15 years ago or better.
[42:27] And I let them vines uh the branches
[42:29] grow on the pine tree and we couldn't
[42:31] get the mower back in there and there
[42:32] wasn't a sprig of grass anyhow and I
[42:34] went out there and took a saw and saw
[42:36] them limbs off until that pine tree was
[42:38] way up here where we could walk on it
[42:40] with a mower and the prettiest bunch of
[42:41] grass you ever seen is under it. Now
[42:42] what was it? The seed was there. It had
[42:45] to get the light.
[42:48] And as long as the denomination or
[42:50] excuses try to shadow that seed that you
[42:53] know actually lays there, you're taking
[42:55] the part of what? Yes. Throw them things
[42:58] away. Let the gospel light shining up on
[43:00] that power of Jesus Christ. Yes. Keeping
[43:04] the light off of it will keep it from
[43:06] living. For if the light ever gets to
[43:08] it, it will spring forth to life. That's
[43:12] the reason the people say, "Don't go to
[43:13] some kind of meeting." They're afraid
[43:15] some of the light will strike one of
[43:16] their members. Remember the woman at the
[43:19] well? She was a prostitute. There stood
[43:21] those priests. They seen Jesus telling
[43:23] Nathaniel, "I saw you, but when you was
[43:25] under the fig tree and the priest said,
[43:27] he's be elbub. He's a fortune teller.
[43:29] That's the devil." This little woman
[43:32] when she walked up there in her immoral
[43:34] state living with six men and when she
[43:36] walked up there in that state in that
[43:38] state she was in Jesus said, "Bring me a
[43:40] drink." The conversation started. He
[43:42] said, "Go get your husband and come
[43:43] here." She said, "I don't have any."
[43:44] Said, "You said the truth. You've got
[43:46] five and the one you're living with, not
[43:48] your husband." She said, "I perceive
[43:51] that you are a prophet, sir. I know the
[43:54] Messiah will do that when he comes."
[43:56] Jesus said, "I'm he that settled."
[44:00] When that light flashed across that
[44:02] seedling and that little old harlot, the
[44:04] harlot days was over. Into the street
[44:06] she went, glorifying God said, "Come see
[44:09] a man who told me the things I've done.
[44:11] Isn't this the Messiah?" What was it?
[44:13] The light got to that seed back under
[44:16] the shadow of a prostitute
[44:19] shelter. Yes, sir. I just closing saying
[44:23] this. I don't know how many more pages I
[44:26] got, but I I sure won't take them off.
[44:28] About 10, but that's just about one half
[44:31] through. But let's close in saying this.
[44:33] Let's compare something one time of a
[44:36] life
[44:37] worthy. Let's compare the life of St.
[44:40] Paul to the rich young ruler.
[44:43] The same light struck both men. Both had
[44:46] the same invitation from Jesus Christ.
[44:49] Is that right?
[44:51] They both was well trained in the
[44:54] scriptures. They were both
[44:56] theologians. Remember Jesus told told
[44:59] the rich young girl, "Keep the
[45:00] commandments." Said, "I've done this
[45:01] from my
[45:02] youth." He was a trained man. So was St.
[45:06] Paul. Both were well trained in the
[45:08] scripture, but both of them had the
[45:10] word. One had it from a knowledge. The
[45:13] other had the germ of life in it. When
[45:16] that light flashed across in front of
[45:18] Paul, he said, "Lord, who are you?" He
[45:20] said, "I'm Jesus. Here I am." He was
[45:23] ready. The light struck both men. One
[45:26] was germatized, the other is not. That's
[45:28] the way it is today. Church spiritual,
[45:30] church natural. The rich man had his
[45:34] excuse. He couldn't do it. He was too
[45:36] weighted down with too many friends of
[45:38] the world. He didn't want to quit
[45:40] associating. That's what's the marathon
[45:41] of people today. You think because you
[45:44] belong to a lot, Jews couldn't forsake
[45:46] that brotherhood. They all drink and
[45:48] things like that and they do this. All
[45:49] right, go on with it. Nothing against
[45:51] the lodge. Nothing against the church.
[45:53] I'm talking about you.
[45:56] Nothing against that. Or want six to
[45:58] one, half a dozen the other. I've just
[46:00] got through telling you the church was
[46:01] nothing but a lodge, the denomination if
[46:04] they deny the word of God. Notice the
[46:08] rich man had his excuses. He never
[46:10] forsaken his
[46:12] testimonial. We find out that he went to
[46:14] great business. He had knowledge and he
[46:17] went to such a place till he had to
[46:19] increase so much till he had to build
[46:21] new barns to put his things
[46:23] in. And when he
[46:26] died and some bachelor with his collar
[46:29] turned around, preached this funeral
[46:32] out. And when he did, he might have said
[46:34] to half mass of flags and said, "Our
[46:36] dear beloved brother, the mayor of this
[46:38] city, now is in the arms of Almighty."
[46:41] Because he was a great member of the
[46:43] church. He did so and so and so. And the
[46:45] Bible said in hell he lifted up his eyes
[46:48] being a torment.
[46:51] See, and remember he still wanted to
[46:55] hold his profession in hell.
[46:58] He seen Lazarus in the bosoms of Abraham
[47:01] and he said, "Father Abraham, send
[47:05] Lazarus down here."
[47:07] Still calling him father. See, he took
[47:11] his knowledge and went to an
[47:13] intellectual church. When the light
[47:15] struck him, he turned it down.
[47:18] If that isn't the modern trend of the
[47:21] church today, I don't know it.
[47:23] No matter what God flashes across their
[47:26] path, a pillar of fire or whatever it
[47:28] might be, they still with their
[47:30] knowledge, they can explain it away and
[47:32] go to the intellectual group for the
[47:34] social standing. But Paul was already in
[47:37] the social standing with great
[47:39] knowledge, a great scholar under Galia,
[47:43] a right hand to the high priest. And so
[47:46] much too he went to the priest and got
[47:48] orders to put all them holy rollers in
[47:50] jail. But when the light struck his path
[47:53] and he seen that that same pillar of
[47:54] fire that led Israel through the
[47:56] wilderness was Jesus Christ, he forsook
[47:58] all he ever knew. Amen. He come to life.
[48:02] Praise the Lord. Could you call that
[48:04] rich man's life a life worthy of the
[48:07] gospel that he
[48:08] heard though he was a believer? Could
[48:12] you call that kind of a life amongst the
[48:13] intellectuals and entertainments that
[48:15] night up there on the as the sun went
[48:17] down giving a toast and maybe some
[48:19] priest saying a prayer up on top of
[48:21] there and he had the entertainments and
[48:23] a beggar laying at his gate down there
[48:26] and he give his toast and talked about
[48:28] his great faith he had in God and before
[48:30] daylight the next morning before the sun
[48:31] could get up he was in hell.
[48:35] That's right. There's your
[48:36] intellectuals. But Paul when the light
[48:39] struck him, let's compare his life and
[48:41] see whether it's worthy. What happened
[48:44] when Paul the light struck him, he
[48:47] forsook all his knowledge and got away
[48:49] from that intellectual group.
[48:51] And he walked in the spirit of Jesus
[48:54] Christ. Glory to God. Amen.
[48:57] But as smart as he was, he never even
[48:59] used big words when he come among some
[49:02] Corinthians. He said, "I never come to
[49:04] you with the wisdom of man.
[49:07] I never come to you with swelling words
[49:09] because you put your faith in that. But
[49:10] I come to you in simplicity in the power
[49:13] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that
[49:15] your faith would be in there. There's a
[49:18] life. Watch it. He never used his
[49:21] education. He never walked with the
[49:23] intellectual bunch. He walked in the
[49:26] spirit of Christ, humble, obedient to
[49:30] the word of God when it was very much
[49:33] contrary to their creeds. But Paul saw
[49:36] the light and walked in it. Is that
[49:38] right? Letting the life of Christ
[49:41] reflect Jesus Christ to the age that he
[49:44] lived
[49:45] in that the people might see the spirit
[49:49] of God. And the humble believed it so
[49:51] much he even wanted to bring
[49:52] handkerchiefs to take him off of his
[49:54] body. And they believed it so much. He's
[49:57] such a representation of Jesus Christ
[49:59] that whatever he touched they believe
[50:00] was blessed.
[50:02] Yes.
[50:04] What a man that
[50:06] was. Give his life, his riches, his
[50:09] everything he had, his education for God
[50:11] all to walk down with fishermanmen and
[50:14] beggars and bums on the street to let
[50:17] his lights reflect the love of Jesus
[50:19] Christ. He said, "I've been striped
[50:20] across the back 40 and nine times. Don't
[50:23] bother me." He said, "I'll bear in my
[50:25] body the marks of Jesus Christ." A poor
[50:27] little fella in such a terrible
[50:29] condition. He said, "I'll bear in my
[50:31] body the marks of Jesus Christ." What a
[50:33] different from this great dignitary with
[50:34] the priest all around him. And when he
[50:36] was at Rome and nobody's standing by and
[50:39] is building a block to cut his head off
[50:42] out there, there's where she told it. Oh
[50:45] my. He said, "There's laid up for me a
[50:47] crown that the Lord, the righteous
[50:49] judge, will give me that day. And not
[50:51] only me, but all them that love his
[50:53] appearing." There's a life worthy of the
[50:56] gospel. Amen. All
[50:59] right. He stood for Christ. He let the
[51:03] gospel reflect through him. Before he
[51:05] did, he went and learned the gospel.
[51:06] Went in Arabia and stayed three years
[51:08] and took the Old Testament and showed by
[51:10] the Old Testament that he was Jesus
[51:13] Christ. And he let it reflect to him to
[51:15] a humble bunch of people that he when he
[51:17] said, "I know how to have a belly full
[51:19] and I know how to be hungry and
[51:22] wanting." A man with an education like
[51:24] him and a scholar like him standing by
[51:27] the with a scholarship from Galia, one
[51:29] of the greatest teachers there was of
[51:31] the day. and stood arm in arm with a
[51:33] high
[51:34] priest. Brother, he could have been
[51:36] worth millions of dollars and had all
[51:37] kind of buildings. That's right. But he
[51:40] said, uh, he didn't even have a but one
[51:43] coat. And Deeus saw a man with such a
[51:46] ministry as that.
[51:48] Second Timothy the third chapter, he
[51:50] said, Deeus has forsaken me and all
[51:52] other man loving this present world.
[51:54] Said, when he come bring me that coat I
[51:56] left up there, it's getting cold. A man
[51:59] with a ministry like that, he could only
[52:01] have one coat.
[52:03] Glory to God.
[52:06] Reminds me of St. Martin when he was
[52:08] trying to stand for the gospel and
[52:10] everything before he was converted and
[52:12] the and the prey scene or the na council
[52:15] and I see a father in the history. One
[52:18] day he was going through the gates
[52:20] there. He was from Taurus, France. And
[52:22] there's people in old bum laying there
[52:24] dying, no clothes. And the people passed
[52:26] by that could have given clothes and
[52:28] they didn't do it. They passed him by
[52:29] and ignored the old fella. And St.
[52:31] Martin stood there and looked at it.
[52:33] They said he every soldier had a had a
[52:36] man to keep his boots shining. He shined
[52:37] his servants's boots and tucked his coat
[52:40] off and took a knife and cut it half
[52:41] into his sword, wrapped the old bum up
[52:43] and said, "We both can live." He went
[52:45] home and went to bed. laying there
[52:47] thinking the old man had cried directly
[52:49] something woke him up. He looked stand
[52:51] in the room there stood Jesus Christ
[52:53] wrapped in that same old piece of
[52:55] garment that he wrapped the bum in said
[52:57] in so much as you have done unto least
[52:58] of these little ones you've done it unto
[53:00] me. Amen. Hallelujah. That's a life
[53:04] worthy of the gospel. You know how he
[53:07] sealed his life too. Don't you look at
[53:08] potar standing for the name of Jesus
[53:11] baptism against the Roman Catholic
[53:13] church and they burn him to a state tore
[53:16] down a bath house and burn him look at
[53:19] Ireneius the rest of them suffered for
[53:22] this cause that's lives worthy look what
[53:25] Paul said in the book of Hebrews 11th
[53:27] chapter said they bought a sundered
[53:29] pulled apart wandered about sheep skins
[53:31] and goat skins and as a desert and
[53:33] destitute and so forth lies in this
[53:36] world's not worthy Amen.
[53:39] There you are. That life's worthy of the
[53:41] gospel. How's mine and yours going to
[53:43] stand in the day of judgment with man
[53:45] like that?
[53:48] Look at Paul now. We're going
[53:50] on. He stood for the gospel. Let Jesus
[53:53] throw through flow through him. No
[53:54] matter how what regardless of what
[53:56] anybody thought about it were the high
[53:58] priest. Well, he went had his head cut
[54:00] off for it. He was a worthy
[54:03] representation of the gospel. Letting
[54:05] look at there. Regardless of what people
[54:07] thought, letting the current of eternal
[54:10] life flow through him in so much that he
[54:12] said, "I would be a curse from Christ
[54:14] for my brethren." Amen. Now, you know
[54:17] what you do when you get eternal life?
[54:19] There's your question. There's your
[54:20] answer. You take the intellectual side
[54:22] or take this side. If you've really got
[54:24] eternal life, that's what happens.
[54:26] That's what happened. Paul ready to be a
[54:29] curse from Christ to let his people,
[54:32] they're blind, ignorant people that
[54:33] wouldn't listen to his gospel. When I
[54:35] think of shame on my own self, I was
[54:37] ready to give them up because they
[54:38] wouldn't listen to
[54:40] me. I feel like repenting and I have
[54:43] repented think. Notice regardless what
[54:46] others thought, this kind of a life is
[54:48] worthy of the gospel. Now I'm closing.
[54:50] The rich man like most of us
[54:53] today shut out and rejected the word of
[54:56] life and become a church member and
[55:00] showed a life that proves that the Bible
[55:02] was unworthy of the gospel that he was
[55:05] asked to receive. Is that right? Amen.
[55:09] How could the gospel shine through a
[55:11] darkened light like that denying the
[55:13] power of God? Now the only way to live a
[55:17] life worthy is to let Christ and his
[55:20] word which he is the word reflect itself
[55:24] so perfect in you till God vindicates
[55:26] what he said in the word. For Christ
[55:29] died that he might present himself
[55:32] before God a sacrifice and it returned
[55:36] back in the form of the Holy Spirit to
[55:39] reflect himself to his people to carry
[55:42] on his word. reflecting himself through
[55:45] you to fulfill his promised word in
[55:49] these future days. Like John the Baptist
[55:52] heard when he heard Christ come and
[55:54] Christ walked out into the water and
[55:57] John said, "Behold the lamb of God."
[56:00] Nobody else saw it, but he saw it. That
[56:02] light coming down from heaven like a
[56:04] dove. And a voice saying, "This is my
[56:06] beloved son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[56:09] in."
[56:10] He saw it coming and Jesus walked out
[56:14] into the water. Emmanuel before a a
[56:17] preacher that was supposed to be a
[56:19] radical walked out into the water before
[56:22] the
[56:23] people and said, "I want to be baptized
[56:26] of you." John said, "Lord, I have need
[56:30] to be baptized of thee. Why comest thou
[56:33] to me? Both am I met one another a
[56:36] prophet and his God?" Amen.
[56:38] Amen. Could you wouldn't I love to stand
[56:41] and watch that? See them stern deep set
[56:44] eyes of John peel down and find them
[56:46] stern deep set eyes of Jesus second
[56:48] cousins to one another in the
[56:50] flesh. Jesus said John suffer it to be
[56:54] so now for thus it behooth us we're the
[56:57] message of this hour. It behooveth us to
[57:00] fulfill all
[57:02] righteousness. John thought yes he's the
[57:04] sacrifice. The sacrifice must be washed
[57:07] before it's presented.
[57:09] And he said, "Come on and be baptized."
[57:13] Other words, it behooves us to fulfill
[57:16] all righteousness.
[57:18] Jesus knowing that that man would
[57:21] genuine. He said, "There's never been a
[57:23] man born of a woman like him. He's more
[57:27] than a
[57:28] prophet. If you can receive it, this is
[57:31] more than a prophet."
[57:33] And Jesus looking into his heart and
[57:35] knowing that his own cousin met him
[57:37] there face to face. John said, "Lord, I
[57:41] got need to be baptized to you. Why do
[57:43] you come to me that suffered to be sold,
[57:46] John? But remember, it behooveth us to
[57:48] fulfill all that God has promised. And I
[57:52] am the sacrifice. I've got to be washed
[57:54] before presented." Yeah. Oh my
[57:59] my when the evening lights are shining
[58:02] when there's not a man in his right
[58:04] mind. But what can't say? Any Bible
[58:06] scholar looking at Bible knows this is
[58:08] the last day. Then it behooves us to
[58:11] fall from these big walls or get away
[58:14] from these things and to get into the
[58:16] righteousness of Jesus Christ in this
[58:18] last day. Amen. And take on the seal of
[58:20] God before the devil gives us the mark
[58:22] of the beast.
[58:24] Oh my. Hallelujah.
[58:26] Yes. Pray God to let the light of this
[58:30] day raise in you to be an obedient
[58:33] servant to God and then let the fruit of
[58:37] the spirit ever remain in your life. And
[58:40] that is a life is worthy of the gospel.
[58:44] Let me say this in closing.
[58:48] The only
[58:49] way, the only way that you can live a
[58:53] life that's worthy of the gospel is let
[58:56] the gospel
[58:58] itself, every bit of the gospel come
[59:01] into you and reflect his promises back,
[59:05] make them vindicated. Let God live in
[59:06] you to vindicate the promises of this
[59:09] day. Just as John, Jesus said to John,
[59:12] suffer it to be so, John. That's right.
[59:14] But we are the messengers of this day
[59:16] and we've got to fulfill all
[59:18] righteousness.
[59:20] And if we are the Christians of this
[59:22] day, let's receive Jesus Christ into our
[59:25] heart. And he is the word. Amen. Don't
[59:28] deny any of it. Say it's the truth. And
[59:30] place it in your heart. Watch the fruit
[59:32] of the spirit upon you and fulfill every
[59:35] promise that he made in the Bible. God
[59:37] wants to fulfill his word. And he don't
[59:39] have any hands but mine and yours. He
[59:42] don't have any eyes but mine and yours.
[59:44] He has no tongue but mine and yours. I
[59:46] am the vine. Ye are the branches. The
[59:49] branches bears the fruit. The vine
[59:51] energiz is the branch.
[59:54] That's the life that's worthy. My prayer
[59:57] is to those in radio or in on the tape
[1:00:00] land and those that are present. May the
[1:00:04] God of all grace of heaven shine his
[1:00:07] blessed Holy Spirit upon us all that we
[1:00:10] from this night henceforth can live a
[1:00:13] life that God would say, "I'm well
[1:00:15] pleased." Enter into the eternal joys
[1:00:18] that's been prepared for you since the
[1:00:19] foundation of the world. That the God of
[1:00:22] heaven send his blessings upon all you
[1:00:24] people. I pray that God will bless you
[1:00:28] women tonight that's got short hair in
[1:00:30] such a way that you will sin and get
[1:00:32] away from this modern trend of the day
[1:00:34] and realize that the Bible says that you
[1:00:35] shouldn't do that. And if you're guilty
[1:00:37] of wearing immoral clothes that the God
[1:00:40] of heaven will shed his grace in your
[1:00:42] heart that you'll never do it again,
[1:00:45] that you'll never be guilty of such a
[1:00:47] thing again. May the Holy Spirit just
[1:00:48] open it up to you and show you. May you
[1:00:50] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:00:52] may you man that's got your wives and
[1:00:55] let them be the boss of the house and
[1:00:56] lead you around. May the God of heaven
[1:00:58] give you grace to set your foot down and
[1:01:01] bring that woman back to her right mind
[1:01:02] again. And realize that that's your
[1:01:05] place in Christ, not a boss now, but you
[1:01:08] are the head of the house. Remember,
[1:01:10] she's not even in the original creation.
[1:01:12] She's only a byproduct of you. Give by
[1:01:15] God to you to take care of you, to keep
[1:01:17] your clothes clean and fix your meals
[1:01:19] and so forth. She's not your dictator.
[1:01:22] You American
[1:01:25] women run around with a gob of paint on
[1:01:28] your face and your nose up in the air
[1:01:30] and rain. It drowns you and then think
[1:01:31] you're some sort of a dictator. You are
[1:01:33] to assist me, but not a real son of God.
[1:01:37] Amen. Right.
[1:01:39] May God give you man grace as sons of
[1:01:42] God to stop such nonsense as that.
[1:01:45] That's right. May he give you grace to
[1:01:48] throw them cigarettes down. Stop
[1:01:50] listening to them dirty
[1:01:52] jokes, all that nonsense. Let's be sons
[1:01:56] of God that we can walk a life that's
[1:01:58] worthy of the gospel. And somebody goes
[1:02:00] down the street say if there ever was a
[1:02:01] Christian, there goes one. There goes
[1:02:03] one that God just shows himself right
[1:02:06] through. And that man is a real
[1:02:07] Christian. There ever was a Christian.
[1:02:09] You might think she looks oldfashioned.
[1:02:11] She's a genuine lady. There it is. Be a
[1:02:15] reputable Christian. For we are aliens
[1:02:17] here. This is not our home. Our home is
[1:02:21] above. We are sons and daughters of a
[1:02:23] king of the king. Let us let our lives
[1:02:27] be a a reputable life. Let us let live a
[1:02:30] life that honor that thing that we claim
[1:02:32] to be a Christian. And if you can't live
[1:02:34] that kind of life, then stop being
[1:02:36] called a Christian because you're only
[1:02:38] bringing reproach upon the
[1:02:41] cause. Thank you people. This hot night
[1:02:44] sitting here, I trust that there'll not
[1:02:46] be one of you lost at that day. I I I
[1:02:49] trust that you and I together will find
[1:02:52] grace before God. That I'll be able to
[1:02:55] always stand for that which is truth.
[1:02:57] Never to hurt you, but never to pull a
[1:02:59] punch from you. See, if I would, I
[1:03:02] wouldn't be the right kind of a daddy if
[1:03:03] I let my kids just do anything. I'll
[1:03:06] correct them. Any love will do that.
[1:03:08] Love is corrective. I remember you
[1:03:10] writing me that note that day, Pat. I've
[1:03:12] still got it. And love is corrective.
[1:03:14] The Bible says so. And if it isn't
[1:03:16] correct, that's the reason God corrects
[1:03:17] us. He loves us. May we live a life from
[1:03:20] henceforth that's worthy with sweetness
[1:03:22] and gentleness. Don't pay no attention.
[1:03:24] You say, "Well, bless God. I know she's
[1:03:26] got it. She spoke in tongues. She danced
[1:03:27] in the spirit." That's all right. But if
[1:03:29] she doesn't have the fruit of the
[1:03:30] spirit, the spirit isn't there. She's
[1:03:32] only impersonating some kind of an
[1:03:34] emotion or something because the Holy
[1:03:35] Spirit can only live the life of the
[1:03:37] fruit of the spirit. That's the only way
[1:03:38] he can do. God bless you. Let us bow our
[1:03:41] heads just a moment.
[1:03:46] Let the
[1:03:47] God that has shed forth his light in
[1:03:50] this last day that laying here before me
[1:03:54] of his
[1:03:55] Bible and the picture of these angels,
[1:03:59] this mystic light in the form of a
[1:04:02] pyramid that even the scientists don't
[1:04:04] know how it got here. They can't explain
[1:04:07] it. But Father, we're thankful you told
[1:04:10] us months before it happened. and we're
[1:04:13] grateful to you. Let the people that's
[1:04:16] called by thy name depart from sin
[1:04:18] tonight, Lord. Unbelief. May, as I've
[1:04:21] had to speak so rashly against our
[1:04:24] sisters, it's not because I don't love
[1:04:26] them, Lord, but I don't want to see the
[1:04:28] devil wind them up till they drop dead
[1:04:29] one of these days and then try to meet
[1:04:31] you in that kind of condition after
[1:04:32] hearing the truth of God like this. May
[1:04:35] they feel that they owe it to themselves
[1:04:37] to go search the scriptures and see if
[1:04:39] that's right. get down on their knees
[1:04:41] then sincerely and say God is that the
[1:04:43] truth then that'll be all necessary Lord
[1:04:45] if they'll be sincere about it for thy
[1:04:48] word is true the people said many of
[1:04:52] them maybe had things that heard them
[1:04:54] but the spirit of God spoke to them and
[1:04:57] they sat still and listened the hour
[1:04:59] getting late the hour late in the
[1:05:01] evening and it's also late in the time
[1:05:04] that we're living in the sun is going
[1:05:08] down the world's cooling
[1:05:10] off God. Darkness will soon set in and
[1:05:14] then the coming of the Lord to catch
[1:05:16] away his church. How we thank you for
[1:05:19] this Lord. We pray now that you'll bless
[1:05:21] every person in divine presence.
[1:05:23] Everyone that hears this tape, Lord,
[1:05:25] around the world. May they get away from
[1:05:29] those old creeds and things and come and
[1:05:32] serve the living God. Come and invest in
[1:05:34] it. do like the queen of the south that
[1:05:36] she come took her three months to get to
[1:05:39] where a man was representing Jesus
[1:05:41] Christ or the God of heaven Solomon
[1:05:44] Jesus said she come from the uttermost
[1:05:46] parts of the world to hear the wisdom of
[1:05:48] Solomon and behold a greater than
[1:05:49] Solomon is here and we know the greater
[1:05:52] than Solomon is here the great Holy
[1:05:55] Spirit himself is here working through
[1:05:58] the people how we thank you for this
[1:06:00] father I pray the blessings bless our
[1:06:02] dear pastor brother Neville
[1:06:05] Lord, as I as I look at him and think of
[1:06:08] his labors of love, my heart just jumps.
[1:06:11] I love him. You see him as he looks upon
[1:06:14] his wife and these little children. I I
[1:06:17] pray God that you'll strengthen him.
[1:06:19] Give him courage. Bless him for many,
[1:06:22] many more years of service this great
[1:06:26] harvest field that we're in. Bless all
[1:06:29] these minister brothers sitting here
[1:06:30] tonight. Many of them are visitors from
[1:06:32] other places. I pray that you'll be with
[1:06:34] them. There's Judy and brother Rudd and
[1:06:37] those precious men who are sister
[1:06:39] churches to this church here standing
[1:06:42] and holding the gospel light in the
[1:06:44] different parts of the cities around
[1:06:45] about for this same life and tending for
[1:06:48] it. Thank you for those men. Lord,
[1:06:50] encourage them and give them grace to
[1:06:53] stand the great trials and things that
[1:06:55] comes upon the earth to prove all
[1:06:57] Christians. Heal the sick and the
[1:06:59] afflicted. Lord, be with us through this
[1:07:01] coming week. Now give us courage. May
[1:07:03] the little broken up Sunday school
[1:07:06] lessons of the day never leave their
[1:07:08] heart. May they meditate day and night.
[1:07:10] Amen. Grant these blessings, Father, in
[1:07:13] the name of Jesus Christ, I ask the
[1:07:15] Amen.
[1:07:18] You love him.
[1:07:20] You believe him.
[1:07:22] God, let's sing our good song again. I
[1:07:24] love him. I love him. As we join
[1:07:26] ourselves
[1:07:28] together, where's Sister? Is she here?
[1:07:31] one of them or the sister has played the
[1:07:32] piano. One of the ladies here don't see
[1:07:34] here she the lady over here. That's
[1:07:35] right. I wanted tonight with all regards
[1:07:38] but I didn't see brother and I wanted
[1:07:40] him to sing for me tonight. Uh how great
[1:07:42] thou art. I guess the brother went home.
[1:07:44] See I heard that song this morning and I
[1:07:46] certainly did appreciate that. My oh my.
[1:07:49] That just rang through my heart and I I
[1:07:52] I want to hear him sing how great thou
[1:07:53] art. Now let's sing h
[1:07:56] um I love you. Everybody good. Now just
[1:08:00] close your eyes. Let's look to him now.
[1:08:02] Say, "Lord, if there's any of this
[1:08:04] carnality in me, take it out right now.
[1:08:06] Take it out." And you out here's this
[1:08:08] tape. When you hear this song, sing with
[1:08:11] us. Then right in your chair where
[1:08:13] you're sitting. If is that if you're
[1:08:16] condemned by the word. If you don't
[1:08:18] think it's a word, search the
[1:08:19] scriptures. See if it's right. It
[1:08:22] behooves you. It means life or death.
[1:08:24] And then while we sing the song of his
[1:08:26] carnality in your life, won't you raise
[1:08:28] up your hand in your chair? Have your
[1:08:29] children and wives raise up their hand.
[1:08:31] Your loved ones around you sing I love
[1:08:34] him and give your life to him. Say
[1:08:35] cleanse me Lord from all evil. While we
[1:08:38] sing now let's
[1:08:40] stand.
[1:08:42] I love him.
[1:08:47] Lord Jesus, I pray that you'll heal the
[1:08:51] people who wear these handkerchiefs. I
[1:08:55] bless them in Jesus Christ name
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:12] [Applause]
[1:09:16] now in this great blessing. Just keep
[1:09:18] playing it sister. Just let's close your
[1:09:20] eyes and think a minute now. Let's pray
[1:09:22] in our heart. Lord
[1:09:25] Jesus, search me. Do I really love you?
[1:09:29] You said if you love me, you'll keep my
[1:09:32] sayings. If you love me, you'll keep my
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:38] word. And then in your heart, say,
[1:09:40] "Lord, let me keep your word. Let me
[1:09:43] hide in my heart never to sin against
[1:09:46] you." That's disbelieve anything that
[1:09:47] you've said. And now, while we sing, I
[1:09:50] love him, let's shake hands with
[1:09:52] somebody near us. Just reach over. Say,
[1:09:54] "God bless you, brother or sister." Real
[1:09:56] quiet now.
[1:10:00] [Music]
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:10] [Applause]
[1:10:13] God bless you
[1:10:16] and pray. God bless you.
[1:10:22] [Applause]
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:29] Now let's raise your hands to
[1:10:33] him. I love him.
[1:10:37] [Applause]
[1:10:39] I love him.
[1:10:44] [Applause]
[1:10:47] Watch you get
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:54] and just my salary.
[1:11:03] [Applause]
[1:11:08] Praise the Lord. You love him. Isn't he
[1:11:12] wonderful? I pray for each one of you.
[1:11:17] Children, what good would it do me to
[1:11:19] stand here and say these things if I in
[1:11:22] my heart I didn't think it was going to
[1:11:24] help you when I'm tired and worn. I just
[1:11:26] can't hardly stand here. My feet are
[1:11:28] hurting and my shoes have stood in
[1:11:31] sweated in there and everything that my
[1:11:32] feet's g and I I'm so tired I'm no kid
[1:11:36] no more. and I have preached three or
[1:11:38] four hour sermons and prayed for the
[1:11:40] sick and going day and night. Why would
[1:11:42] I be standing here and do you know of
[1:11:44] all this 30 years if it was for
[1:11:46] popularity? I've shunned that. You know
[1:11:49] I don't take money. You know that. Now I
[1:11:52] have have I told you anything in the
[1:11:54] name of the Lord but what come to pass?
[1:11:55] You know that's right. I love you. It's
[1:11:58] a love of God that's in my heart for
[1:12:00] each one of you. I wish I could I wish I
[1:12:03] could stand before God and say God let
[1:12:06] let me help him. Let let me do this. I
[1:12:08] can't do it. Each person has to stand by
[1:12:10] theirel. I I I believe we're all going
[1:12:13] up now one of these days. And if we
[1:12:16] happen to fall asleep before that time,
[1:12:18] I'm taking from you. Remember, I'll meet
[1:12:20] you over there.
[1:12:22] I know it's there. The very visions
[1:12:25] that's told you everything being perfect
[1:12:27] has come to pass just as he said. No one
[1:12:29] of all these years can ever say that I
[1:12:32] ever told you anything that would come
[1:12:34] to pass, but what it did. the world over
[1:12:36] knows that you never seen it on the
[1:12:37] platform while I told everybody exactly
[1:12:39] truth. See, it's always been that same
[1:12:42] God. Let me look up past the curtain of
[1:12:45] time. I seen them women and men throwing
[1:12:47] their arms around me and hugging me
[1:12:49] saying, "Oh, brother Brandon, I I just
[1:12:52] can't sit. I'm tired. I'll go anyhow. My
[1:12:54] back hurts." And I every day I I'm I'm
[1:12:59] 54 years old. You know, you get extra
[1:13:01] pain every day. My prayer is God, hold
[1:13:04] me together.
[1:13:06] Hold me together to preach the word,
[1:13:08] stand on that truth until I see my boy
[1:13:11] Joseph whole enough and filled with the
[1:13:13] Holy Ghost. I take his old wore out
[1:13:14] Bible and in his hand and say, "Son,
[1:13:16] carry it to the end of your life. Don't
[1:13:18] you compromise on it." I thought maybe
[1:13:20] Billy would preach the gospel. God never
[1:13:22] called him. But I believe Joseph, even a
[1:13:24] little mean boy that he is, I believe
[1:13:27] God's called him.
[1:13:29] That's the reason kids can't get along
[1:13:30] with him. He's a leader. And I I I know
[1:13:33] that God's called him. I want to train
[1:13:35] him in the way of the word, the way of
[1:13:36] the word of the Lord, that he'll not
[1:13:39] forsake that word. I want to do it
[1:13:41] myself if God willing. And when I get
[1:13:43] old and sit back and see him there,
[1:13:45] stand in the pulpit and said, "This same
[1:13:46] gospel my daddy stood for, he's sitting
[1:13:48] there old and broke tonight, but I want
[1:13:50] to take his place and fill his shoes
[1:13:53] stand there." Then I look up and say,
[1:13:54] "Lord, let your servant depart in
[1:13:57] peace." That's what I want to see so
[1:13:59] bad. Until that time come, then what if
[1:14:02] I would raise in another generation? I
[1:14:04] can't. I have to come with this
[1:14:05] generation. I have to stand with you.
[1:14:08] You are the ones I have to stand for and
[1:14:10] give an account before God of the gospel
[1:14:12] I preach. Do you think I'd stand here
[1:14:14] and try to twist you around out of
[1:14:15] something I thought was right? I'd be
[1:14:18] encouraging you to go do it. But I know
[1:14:20] that when it's wrong, I want to get you
[1:14:21] out of that into what is right. Truly
[1:14:24] from my heart. God, bear me record. I
[1:14:26] love you everyone with real divine
[1:14:29] Christian love. God bless you. Pray for
[1:14:32] me. I don't know what my future holds,
[1:14:34] but I know who's holding my future.
[1:14:36] Amen. So, I rest in that. I turn the
[1:14:39] this pulpit over to a man that I have
[1:14:42] supreme confidence in as a servant of
[1:14:45] Jesus Christ, our pastor, Brother
[1:14:47] Neville.
[1:14:50] Praise
[1:14:51] God. Man, I enjoyed singing together at
[1:14:54] the end. It's always
[1:14:57] nice. If we could go back to page 41
[1:15:00] where we
[1:15:02] began and uh we'll look at the first
[1:15:06] question. It says, "If the gospel is
[1:15:09] right, what what should we do about it?"
[1:15:11] Let's go from here and turn over to uh
[1:15:14] paragraph
[1:15:18] 237, which will be at the bottom of page
[1:15:20] 46.
[1:15:26] Brother Bam, just before this, they
[1:15:28] started telling the uh story of when he
[1:15:30] went to Chicago to preach and they laid
[1:15:31] a trap for him. They were going to
[1:15:32] question him on his doctrine and trap
[1:15:34] him in his doctrine and he and he told
[1:15:36] them what was going to happen. Then he
[1:15:38] stood there and preached the message. I
[1:15:39] was not disobedient to the heavenly
[1:15:41] vision. It would do you good to go
[1:15:43] listen to that sermon sometime because
[1:15:45] when you hear brother talk about it, he
[1:15:47] says, "If any of you can uh could take
[1:15:49] your Bibles, come stand by me if you can
[1:15:51] contest it. And if not, get off my back.
[1:15:54] And another place he says, you know,
[1:15:55] here he says, this is the quietest room
[1:15:56] you've ever seen. And another place he
[1:15:58] says, they didn't say anything. They
[1:16:00] didn't come. He said, they were smarter
[1:16:01] than I thought they was. And beforehand,
[1:16:04] he says, you've seen God in action. Now
[1:16:07] you'll see God in battle. So it was the
[1:16:09] battle of the Lord. But what's amazing
[1:16:11] to me is how brother Bam talked about
[1:16:13] the scenario. It was a battle. It was it
[1:16:16] was a a trap. It was God coming on the
[1:16:18] scene and standing behind his prophet,
[1:16:20] standing behind the word and silencing
[1:16:22] all the voices. But if you go back and
[1:16:24] listen to the message, Brother Benham is
[1:16:26] so humble when he's preaching. Do you
[1:16:29] know how he says, "Come stand by me." He
[1:16:31] says, "Now now you brothers, now I'm
[1:16:33] willing to listen to anything that you
[1:16:35] have to say. If if you'll just take your
[1:16:37] Bibles and come here and
[1:16:40] God don't have to raise his voice. God
[1:16:43] don't have to stop and shout. All God
[1:16:45] has to do is speak his word and his word
[1:16:48] is enough. It doesn't take the
[1:16:50] personality of a man. Doesn't take
[1:16:52] stomping around and shouting. All it
[1:16:54] takes is a quiet submission to the Lord
[1:16:57] and a steadfast standing on the word.
[1:16:59] You don't have to be angry. You don't
[1:17:00] have to be mad. You don't have to spit
[1:17:01] it through your teeth. All you got to do
[1:17:03] is give the word and the word will stand
[1:17:05] the test. Amen. Amen. So, it was a
[1:17:09] battle. God was being mighty in battle
[1:17:12] through a humble vessel that'll just
[1:17:14] stay with the word. That was God mighty
[1:17:17] in battle. So just because somebody's
[1:17:20] not arguing with you, just because
[1:17:23] somebody's not yelling at you, just
[1:17:25] because they're not getting angry with
[1:17:26] you, doesn't mean that God's not on the
[1:17:29] scene and God's not battling. We don't
[1:17:32] All we need to do is stay humble like
[1:17:34] Brother Benham and just stay with the
[1:17:35] word and let God be mighty in battle.
[1:17:39] So, it might do you good to hear that
[1:17:41] message one day. You'll be like, "This
[1:17:43] can't be the one he's referring to, but
[1:17:45] it is." So, let's go down to the bottom
[1:17:48] of page 46. Now, this is right after he
[1:17:50] tells that story. Paragraph 237, Tommy
[1:17:53] Hicks said, "I want 300 of those tapes
[1:17:55] to send to every Trinitarian preacher I
[1:17:57] know of." Them men, shaking my hand,
[1:18:00] said, "We'll come down to the tabernacle
[1:18:01] and be baptized over." Where where they
[1:18:04] at? Excuses. I can't do it. My
[1:18:06] denomination won't let me. I married a
[1:18:08] wife. I bought an uh a yoke of ox
[1:18:10] rather. I bought a piece of ground. I
[1:18:12] got to go look at it. See some of those
[1:18:15] things like excuses. Is that right? Is
[1:18:18] that life worthy of the gospel? If the
[1:18:20] gospel is right, let's sell out
[1:18:22] everything we got and live for it. Be a
[1:18:25] Christian. Yes, sir. Amen. Notice now as
[1:18:28] we close, it's very evident when brother
[1:18:30] Ram's talking about the gospel. He's not
[1:18:32] just talking about Amen. the same thing
[1:18:34] that's been preached for 2,000 years,
[1:18:35] but the gospel is the good news. And
[1:18:37] this message is the good news of our
[1:18:38] day. Amen. And if this message is right,
[1:18:42] let's sell out everything we got and
[1:18:43] live for it and be a Christian. Let's go
[1:18:46] from there over to paragraph 243 on the
[1:18:49] next page, page
[1:18:51] 48. He says, let's compare something one
[1:18:54] time of a life worthy. Let's compare the
[1:18:56] life of St. Paul to the rich young
[1:18:58] ruler. The same light struck both men.
[1:19:00] Both had the same invitation from Jesus
[1:19:02] Christ. That's right. They both was well
[1:19:04] trained in the scriptures. They were
[1:19:06] both theologians. Uh both theologians.
[1:19:09] Remember Jesus told the rich young
[1:19:11] ruler, "Keep the commandments." He said,
[1:19:12] "I've done this from my youth." He was a
[1:19:15] trained man. So was St. Paul. Both were
[1:19:17] well trained in the scriptures. Both of
[1:19:19] them had the word. One had it from the
[1:19:21] from a knowledge. The other one had the
[1:19:23] germ of life in it. When the light
[1:19:25] flashed across in front of Paul, he
[1:19:27] said, "Lord, who are you?" Said, "I'm
[1:19:29] Jesus. Here I am." Then he was ready.
[1:19:32] The light struck both men. One was
[1:19:34] dermatized. the other is not. That's the
[1:19:36] way it is today. Church spiritual and
[1:19:38] church natural. Let's go to paragraph
[1:19:41] 251 on the next page at the bottom of
[1:19:43] 49. But Paul when the light struck him,
[1:19:46] let's compare his life and see whether
[1:19:48] it's worthy. What happened when Paul the
[1:19:50] light struck him? He forsook all his
[1:19:52] knowledge and got away from that
[1:19:53] intellectual group and he walked in the
[1:19:55] spirit of Jesus Christ. Man, what made
[1:19:58] him worthy of the gospel? cuz he heeded
[1:20:01] the invitation and he came to the
[1:20:04] spiritual feast. He rejected everything
[1:20:06] else. Let's go to paragraph 258 on page
[1:20:11] 51. He goes on and he says, "Look at
[1:20:14] Polycarp standing from the name of Jesus
[1:20:16] baptism against the Roman Catholic
[1:20:17] Church and they burned him to a stake,
[1:20:19] tore down a bath house and burn him.
[1:20:21] Look at Irene, the rest of them that
[1:20:23] suffered for this cause. That's lives
[1:20:25] worthy." So a life worthy is not just
[1:20:28] dying for the gospel. A life worthy is
[1:20:31] giving up your life for the gospel.
[1:20:33] Giving up everything else for the
[1:20:35] gospel. Look what Paul said in the book
[1:20:37] of Hebrews 11th chapter. He said they
[1:20:39] were saw a sunder, pulled apart,
[1:20:40] wandered about in sheep skins and goat
[1:20:42] skins as was in desert and destitute and
[1:20:44] so forth. Lives that this world is not
[1:20:47] worthy of. There you are. That life is
[1:20:49] worthy of the gospel. How is mine and
[1:20:51] yours going to stand in the day of
[1:20:53] judgment with men like that? Look at
[1:20:55] Paul now. We'll go on down. He stood for
[1:20:57] the gospel. Let Jesus so flow through
[1:20:59] him. No matter how what regardless of
[1:21:01] what anybody thought about it, where the
[1:21:03] high priest, why he went and had his
[1:21:06] head caught off for it, he was a worthy
[1:21:08] representation of the gospel. Look
[1:21:10] there. Regard regardless of what people
[1:21:13] thought, letting the current of eternal
[1:21:15] life flow through him in so much that he
[1:21:17] said, "I would be a curse from Christ
[1:21:18] for my brethren." Now, you know what you
[1:21:22] do when you get eternal life? There is
[1:21:24] your question. There is your answer. You
[1:21:26] take the intellectual side or you take
[1:21:27] this side. If you really got eternal
[1:21:29] life, that's what happens. That's what
[1:21:31] happened. Paul ready to be a curse from
[1:21:33] Christ to let his people, the blind,
[1:21:35] ignorant people that wouldn't listen to
[1:21:37] his
[1:21:37] gospel. Then brother said, I think a
[1:21:40] shame on myself. I was ready to give
[1:21:42] them up because they wouldn't listen to
[1:21:44] me. Remember at the beginning we said,
[1:21:46] where did he preach this? He was
[1:21:48] preaching this in 1963. And he said, "I
[1:21:51] was ready to give them up because they
[1:21:53] wouldn't listen listen to me." Amen. And
[1:21:55] that's because he felt the rejection
[1:21:57] from them not listening to him. He said,
[1:21:59] "I was ready to give them up because
[1:22:00] they wouldn't listen to
[1:22:02] me." He said, "I feel like repenting and
[1:22:05] I have repented." See, notice regardless
[1:22:07] of what others thought, this kind of
[1:22:09] life is worthy of the gospel. I mean,
[1:22:13] this is so amazing because brother Bam
[1:22:16] starts showing how Paul not only gave up
[1:22:18] his intellectuals, only gave up his
[1:22:20] status in the church, he was willing to
[1:22:22] be a curse from Christ for his brother.
[1:22:23] And he said, "That's what happens when
[1:22:24] eternal life comes in. You're willing to
[1:22:26] give up everything for the gospel." And
[1:22:28] then, Brother Bam said he was ashamed of
[1:22:30] himself because he was ready to give
[1:22:31] them up because they wouldn't listen to
[1:22:33] him. But thank God, he
[1:22:36] repented. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:39] So now let's go to the second
[1:22:43] question. What will keep the seed from
[1:22:45] living? Let's go back to paragraph
[1:22:50] 238. What will keep the seed from
[1:22:52] living? Paragraph 238 on page 47. But
[1:22:56] their excuses is their creeds and
[1:22:58] denominations. It's like a tree. I was
[1:23:01] looking at brother Banks the other day.
[1:23:03] I had a pine tree I planted when I first
[1:23:05] moved up there about oh about 15 years
[1:23:07] ago or better. And I let them vines, the
[1:23:09] branches grow out on the pine tree. And
[1:23:11] we couldn't get the mower back under
[1:23:12] there. And there wasn't a springrig of
[1:23:14] grass anyhow. And I went out there and I
[1:23:16] took a saw and saw them limbs off until
[1:23:18] the pine tree was way up here where you
[1:23:20] could walk under it with a mower. And
[1:23:22] the prettiest bunch of grass you ever
[1:23:24] seen is under it now. What was it? The
[1:23:26] seed was there. It had to get the light.
[1:23:30] And as long as the denomination, your
[1:23:31] excuses try to shadow that seed that
[1:23:33] you're now, you know, actually lays
[1:23:35] there, you're taking the part of Lot.
[1:23:37] Throw them things away and let the
[1:23:39] gospel light shine upon there. The power
[1:23:41] of Jesus Christ. Yes. Keeping the light
[1:23:43] off of it will keep it from living. For
[1:23:46] if the light ever gets to it, it will
[1:23:48] spring forth to life. I love that. If
[1:23:50] the life ever gets to it, it'll spring
[1:23:52] forth to life. That's the reason that
[1:23:54] people say, "Don't go to some of them
[1:23:56] kind of meetings." They're afraid some
[1:23:58] of that light will strike one of their
[1:23:59] members. Remember the woman at the well?
[1:24:02] She was a prostitute. There stood those
[1:24:03] priests. They seen Jesus tell Nathaniel,
[1:24:06] "I saw you by when you was under the fig
[1:24:08] tree." And the priest said, "He's be
[1:24:10] elabub. He's a fortune teller. That's
[1:24:12] the devil." This little woman, when she
[1:24:14] walked up there in her immoral state,
[1:24:16] living with six men. And when she walked
[1:24:18] up there in that state, in that state
[1:24:20] she was. And Jesus said, "Bring me a
[1:24:22] drink." The conversation started. He
[1:24:24] said, "Go get your husband and come
[1:24:26] here." She said, "I don't have any."
[1:24:27] Said, "You said the truth. You've got
[1:24:29] five, and the one you're living with is
[1:24:31] not your husband." She said, "I perceive
[1:24:34] you're a prophet, sir. I know the
[1:24:36] Messiah will do that when he comes."
[1:24:38] Jesus said, "I am he." That settled it.
[1:24:42] When that light flashed across that seed
[1:24:44] laying in that little old harlot, the
[1:24:45] harlot days was over. Into the street
[1:24:47] she went, glorifying God. Come see a man
[1:24:50] who told me the things I've done. Isn't
[1:24:52] this the Messiah? What was it? The light
[1:24:55] got to the seed back under the shadow of
[1:24:57] a prostitute shelter. Yes, sir. Praise
[1:25:01] God. So, what is it that we need to do
[1:25:03] to get the seed to spring to life? Just
[1:25:05] give them the light of the gospel of the
[1:25:08] hour and it'll cause the seed to come to
[1:25:10] life. What worked on you and I, it was
[1:25:12] the light of the hour. Amen. When God
[1:25:15] could get the light back under the
[1:25:16] shadows of whatever shadow we were
[1:25:18] living in, when that light got back
[1:25:20] under that shadow, that seed sprung to
[1:25:22] life. Praise God. Now you see where the
[1:25:25] devil fights the word so much.
[1:25:28] Amen. Next question. What is the only
[1:25:31] way to live a life worthy? Let's go to
[1:25:34] paragraph
[1:25:35] 264 over on page
[1:25:41] 52. Page 252, paragraph 26 or page 52,
[1:25:45] paragraph 264.
[1:25:47] The only way to live a life worthy is to
[1:25:49] let Christ and his word, which he is the
[1:25:51] word, reflect itself so perfect in you
[1:25:53] till God vindicates what he said in the
[1:25:55] word. For Christ died that he might
[1:25:57] present himself before God as sacrifice.
[1:26:00] And it returned back in the form of the
[1:26:02] Holy Spirit to reflect himself through
[1:26:04] his people to carry on his work,
[1:26:06] reflecting himself through you to
[1:26:07] fulfill his promised word in these
[1:26:10] future days. Let's go to the next page
[1:26:12] on paragraph 271.
[1:26:15] Pray God to let the light of this day
[1:26:17] raise in you to be an obedient servant
[1:26:19] to God. And then let the fruit of the
[1:26:21] spirit ever remain in your life. And
[1:26:23] that is a life worthy of the gospel. Let
[1:26:26] me say this in closing. The only way the
[1:26:28] only way that you can live a life that's
[1:26:30] worthy of the gospel is let the gospel
[1:26:32] itself, every bit of the gospel come
[1:26:35] into you and reflect his promises back.
[1:26:37] Make them vindicate. Vindicated. Let God
[1:26:40] live in you to vindicate the promises of
[1:26:43] this day. Just as John, as Jesus said to
[1:26:46] John, suffered to be so, John. That's
[1:26:48] right. But we are the messengers of this
[1:26:49] day, and we've got to fulfill all
[1:26:51] righteousness. And if we are the
[1:26:53] Christians of this day, let's receive
[1:26:55] Jesus Christ into our heart. And he is
[1:26:57] the word. Don't deny any of it. Say,
[1:26:59] "It's the truth." And place it in your
[1:27:01] heart. Watch the fruit of the spirit
[1:27:03] upon you and fulfill every promise that
[1:27:06] he made in the Bible. God wants to
[1:27:08] fulfill his word and he don't have any
[1:27:10] hands but mine and yours. He don't have
[1:27:12] any eyes but mine and yours. He has no
[1:27:14] tongue but mine and yours. I am the
[1:27:16] vine. You are the branches. The branches
[1:27:18] bear fruit. The vine energizes the
[1:27:20] branch. That's the life that's
[1:27:23] worthy. So, must we bear the fruit of
[1:27:26] the spirit? Yes. Must we live the word?
[1:27:29] Yes. Must we do it of our own effort?
[1:27:31] No. It's got to be his life. Living his
[1:27:34] word through our bodies. He is the vine.
[1:27:38] We are the branches. It's his life. It's
[1:27:40] his power. But what did he say to see
[1:27:42] that work? He said, "Receive every word
[1:27:45] and say it's the truth." Receive it and
[1:27:48] don't give up on it until it all comes
[1:27:50] to manifestation in our lives. Just hold
[1:27:52] on to it and believe it and receive God.
[1:27:54] And remember, brother Bam said in
[1:27:56] another message, he said, "God can only
[1:27:58] use what you surrendered to him." And he
[1:28:01] was talking about Samson. Samson gave
[1:28:03] God his strength but not his heart. And
[1:28:05] God could only have so much victory in
[1:28:07] Samson because God or Samson only gave
[1:28:09] part. But when Samson finally gave all,
[1:28:12] Amen. God got the greatest victory of
[1:28:14] Samson's life when Samson was ready to
[1:28:16] give his life and give all of it. Amen.
[1:28:19] And do we want to have a life that's
[1:28:20] worthy of the gospel? Then we have to
[1:28:22] receive the gospel. But then we have to
[1:28:24] receive the life of the gospel and let
[1:28:26] the gospel live out of us by saying it's
[1:28:28] the truth. Amen. And empty out
[1:28:31] everything else that's different and let
[1:28:33] the gospel life live through us. Amen.
[1:28:36] That's a life worthy of the gospel. I
[1:28:38] just want to make a couple notes. Turn
[1:28:41] with me back to paragraph 213. I just
[1:28:43] want to highlight a couple things as we
[1:28:47] close. Paragraph
[1:28:50] 213 on page
[1:28:53] 42 says, "Where is your treasures? Do
[1:28:56] you want to be some great somebody? If
[1:28:58] you are, you're nobody. You get to a
[1:29:00] place till you don't want to be a great
[1:29:02] somebody. You want to be a humble little
[1:29:04] servant of Christ. That's the way out.
[1:29:07] That's all. Amen. Let's just let's just
[1:29:10] strive and desire to be what he wants us
[1:29:13] to be. Nothing else. Let's go to
[1:29:16] paragraph
[1:29:18] 282. There's one little note that I want
[1:29:20] to note here that I found to be
[1:29:25] interesting.
[1:29:28] 282 on page
[1:29:30] 55. Brother says, "Let the people that's
[1:29:32] called by thy name depart from sin
[1:29:35] tonight, Lord.
[1:29:36] unbelief. So what is sin? Unbelief.
[1:29:41] Let's turn over to paragraph 291 on page
[1:29:45] 57. He says, "Now in this great
[1:29:47] blessing, just keep playing it, sister.
[1:29:49] Just close your eyes and think a minute
[1:29:50] now. Let's pray in our heart. Lord
[1:29:52] Jesus, search me. Do I really love you?"
[1:29:55] You said, "If you love me, you'll keep
[1:29:56] my sayings. If you love me, you'll keep
[1:29:58] my word." And then in your heart, say,
[1:30:00] "Lord, let me keep your word." I love
[1:30:03] that. Let's just think about that for a
[1:30:05] minute. Says, "If you love me, you'll
[1:30:07] keep my word." That's the commandment.
[1:30:09] Jesus said, "If you love me, you'll keep
[1:30:10] my commandments." And then in your
[1:30:12] heart, say, "Lord, let me keep your
[1:30:15] word." Oh, we realize we need help in
[1:30:17] this, friends. We need his spirit. Lord,
[1:30:20] let me keep your word. Let me hide it in
[1:30:22] my heart. Never to sin against you.
[1:30:25] That's disbelieve anything that you
[1:30:28] said. So, what is it to sin against the
[1:30:31] Lord? Listen, don't go to the attributes
[1:30:34] of sin. Let's go back to the core of
[1:30:36] sin. What is it to sin against the Lord?
[1:30:39] To disbelieve anything that he said.
[1:30:42] We're supposed to stay with the word.
[1:30:44] Let's go up to the top of this page on
[1:30:46] paragraph 290. And let's read this as
[1:30:50] the musicians come. And brother Blake,
[1:30:51] if you make your way up now, let's sing
[1:30:54] I Love Him. Everybody together. Now,
[1:30:56] just close your eyes and let's look to
[1:30:57] him now. Say, Lord, if there's any of
[1:31:00] this carnality in me, take it out right
[1:31:02] now. Take it out. And you out here's
[1:31:05] this tape. Hey, that's you and I. Amen.
[1:31:08] You see yourself in this here. You that
[1:31:10] hears this tape. When you hear this
[1:31:13] song, sing with us. Then write in your
[1:31:15] chair where you're sitting. If if
[1:31:17] there's that, if you're condemned by the
[1:31:19] word, if you don't think it's the word,
[1:31:21] search the scripture. See if it's right.
[1:31:23] It behooves you. It means life or death.
[1:31:26] And then while we sing this song, if
[1:31:28] there's carnality in your life, won't
[1:31:30] you raise up your hand in your chair?
[1:31:31] Have your children, your wife to raise
[1:31:33] up their hand, your loved ones around
[1:31:35] you sing, I love him and give your life
[1:31:37] to him. Say, cleanse me, Lord, from all
[1:31:41] evil. Let's all stand. I think it'd be a
[1:31:44] good time to sing, I love him. I love
[1:31:47] him. And just lift our hands to him just
[1:31:49] like the prophet told us, just like he
[1:31:51] demonstrated on the tape. lift our hands
[1:31:53] and say, "Lord, take all this carnality
[1:31:56] out of me." I don't think of as any of
[1:31:58] us got to the place where there's no
[1:31:59] carnality left.
[1:32:02] We could all raise our hands and say,
[1:32:03] "Lord, take all carnality out of me.
[1:32:06] Take anything that's not like you out of
[1:32:08] me and let only your word live through
[1:32:11] me." Can we sing that song? I love
[1:32:14] him. Let's sing it with this prayer in
[1:32:17] our hearts. Will
[1:32:18] [Music]
[1:32:20] I love him?
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:26] I love
[1:32:30] him
[1:32:33] because
[1:32:35] he
[1:32:37] first
[1:32:38] loved
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:44] me
[1:32:45] and
[1:32:49] purchase
[1:32:51] my salation.
[1:32:58] [Music]
[1:33:00] Oh yeah. Sing the chorus one more time.
[1:33:05] [Music]
[1:33:17] I love him.
[1:33:22] [Music]
[1:33:24] I love
[1:33:28] him
[1:33:31] because
[1:33:32] he
[1:33:34] first
[1:33:36] love
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:42] me and
[1:33:46] purchase
[1:33:48] my salation.
[1:33:55] ation
[1:33:57] on
[1:34:04] God
[1:34:08] tree. The real question, friends, is can
[1:34:11] we love him more than we love self?
[1:34:15] That's the real battleground.
[1:34:17] Can we deny self and all the wants of
[1:34:19] the flesh and all selfish ambitions and
[1:34:22] all selfish motives? Can we just love
[1:34:24] him more when we hear his word? When we
[1:34:27] sing this song from deep inside, that's
[1:34:30] the genuine love that loves him more
[1:34:32] than anything else. That's why we can
[1:34:34] raise our hands and say, "Lord, take
[1:34:36] this carnality out of my life. And Lord,
[1:34:38] help me keep your word. I want to keep
[1:34:42] your word, but help me keep your word."
[1:34:44] Let's bow our heads
[1:34:46] together. Lord Jesus, we thank you for
[1:34:48] your word. We thank you,
[1:34:51] God, that you sent the gospel in our
[1:34:54] day, a bright
[1:34:55] light. And Lord, you found a seed laying
[1:34:58] in a shadow in our life, hid back under
[1:35:01] all kinds of
[1:35:03] things. Lord, under selfishness, under
[1:35:06] pride, some in denominations, some in
[1:35:09] the world, some in all kinds of
[1:35:11] lives. But God, you knew where it was
[1:35:14] laying. And just like you went by
[1:35:16] Samaria one day to shine light on his
[1:35:19] seed, Lord, you came by
[1:35:20] us. Whether it was in the world or in a
[1:35:23] denominational system or right here in
[1:35:25] this
[1:35:26] sanctuary, you found a way to get your
[1:35:29] light to a seed that was shadowed over.
[1:35:32] You sprung it to
[1:35:33] life. And God, we just want to raise our
[1:35:36] hands and say, "Take all carnality out
[1:35:38] of us.
[1:35:40] Help us, Lord, to keep your word because
[1:35:41] that's the desire of our heart. Help us,
[1:35:44] Lord. God, we want to empty out and give
[1:35:48] you all. We want, Lord, by your grace a
[1:35:51] life that's worthy of the gospel. We
[1:35:54] heard your invitation, Lord, and it was
[1:35:57] our pleasure to
[1:35:59] come. when others turned it down and
[1:36:01] threw it away and had excuses and no
[1:36:04] need. Lord, there was something inside
[1:36:06] of us that wanted to come to your
[1:36:09] spiritual feast. And God, we thank you
[1:36:11] for the grace that placed the
[1:36:13] predestinated seed within our soul. So
[1:36:16] that when we heard the call, though we
[1:36:19] weren't the first ones bidden, we
[1:36:20] weren't the best option. We were the bad
[1:36:22] ones. We were whatever, halt and lame
[1:36:25] and blind, whatever condition. But Lord,
[1:36:28] something in us wanted to come to that
[1:36:30] feast. We know that was your
[1:36:33] grace, God. Now that we're here feasting
[1:36:36] on your word, Lord, we want to give you
[1:36:38] room to work inside of us that you might
[1:36:41] manifest your life, that we might live
[1:36:43] the fruits of the spirit, that your word
[1:36:45] might be manifest in these bodies of
[1:36:47] flesh that you've redeemed. May you get
[1:36:50] glory in it all and may it be a life
[1:36:53] worthy of the gospel. We love you, Lord.
[1:36:56] We thank you for this message. Thank you
[1:36:58] for this gospel. May you bless your
[1:37:01] children as we part from here. Keep them
[1:37:02] safely on the way home. May the light
[1:37:05] shine through them. And may that light
[1:37:08] that shines through them touch others
[1:37:10] and find light in shadowy places. Find
[1:37:13] other seeds tucked up behind shadowy
[1:37:16] places. And may the light from your
[1:37:18] children, Lord, shine unto others and
[1:37:20] may they come to life as well. For
[1:37:23] that's the desire of our heart, Lord, to
[1:37:24] see all your seed come to life. We love
[1:37:28] you. We ask that you would bless us,
[1:37:30] Lord. Have preeminence among us, Lord,
[1:37:32] and be pleased with our lives. We pray
[1:37:35] in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:37:38] Amen. Man, God bless you all, man. I've
[1:37:42] enjoyed listening to another tape and
[1:37:44] have another tape service with you. It's
[1:37:46] always a blessing. Every year I said
[1:37:48] we're going to do this more than once,
[1:37:49] but you know how it goes. We flip months
[1:37:51] on the calendar like like we flip weeks,
[1:37:53] you know. But I thank God that we had
[1:37:55] this time together and I enjoyed it. And
[1:37:57] if there's anything that this can do,
[1:37:59] the the the purpose behind all of this
[1:38:01] is to enjoy this together and learn how
[1:38:04] to dig into the word to to eat from the
[1:38:07] word. Not to just listen or read
[1:38:08] casually, but to to take the meat for
[1:38:10] our day to give us spiritual strength.
[1:38:12] And if I can do anything, if God gives
[1:38:14] me any influence or ability over you
[1:38:16] all, it would be to instill into you a
[1:38:18] hunger and a desire to read the message
[1:38:20] for yourselves. Every child and young
[1:38:23] person of every age, you're only going
[1:38:25] to be as strong as the amount of good
[1:38:27] nutritious food you eat. And we spend so
[1:38:30] much time in this world bombarded by
[1:38:32] other things that we have to partake of.
[1:38:34] And we have to as we mingle with the
[1:38:36] world, there's so many things that are
[1:38:38] coming in that is not nutritious food
[1:38:41] that will not give us spiritual strength
[1:38:43] to fly. Amen. We we've got to gain
[1:38:46] strength from the word. We've got to
[1:38:47] read the Bibles ourselves. We got to
[1:38:49] read the message ourselves. We got to
[1:38:51] ask God to give us open eyes to see and
[1:38:53] to hear, open our ears and open our eyes
[1:38:56] that we can feed on the word
[1:38:58] ourselves. So, I hope you love the word
[1:39:01] and I hope you feed on the word daily.
[1:39:04] to have spiritual strength. This last
[1:39:07] leg of the journey is going to require
[1:39:09] all the vitamins of the whole Bible.
[1:39:11] That's why God took the took the veil
[1:39:13] off the Bible and gave us the full word
[1:39:15] because this last leg of the journey to
[1:39:17] fly clear on out of this dimension is
[1:39:19] going to require all the spiritual
[1:39:21] vitamins that's available. That's why we
[1:39:23] have a four full seven course menu.
[1:39:27] Brother Banner said, for this end time,
[1:39:30] take advantage of it. I I encourage you.
[1:39:32] God bless you. Remember the blame.
[1:39:36] I'll live for
[1:39:38] [Music]
[1:39:40] Jesus and let the world go
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:45] by. I'll claim his
[1:39:50] promises. He will
[1:39:55] supply. We'll walk together.
[1:40:01] My Lord and
[1:40:05] I, I'll live for
[1:40:10] Jesus and let the world go by. Live for
[1:40:15] Jesus. I'll live for
[1:40:19] Jesus and let the world go
[1:40:25] by. I'll claim his promises.
[1:40:31] He will
[1:40:35] supply. Walk
[1:40:37] [Applause]
[1:40:39] together. My Lord and
[1:40:44] I. I'll live for
[1:40:49] Jesus. Let the world go by one more
[1:40:54] time. I'll live for Jesus.
[1:41:00] Let the world go
[1:41:04] high. How his
[1:41:09] promises he will
[1:41:14] supply. Walk
[1:41:16] [Applause]
[1:41:19] together. My Lord and
[1:41:24] I. I'll live for Jesus.
[1:41:28] [Music]
[1:41:30] Let the
[1:41:32] world begin.
[1:41:37] Well, it's
[1:41:39] Jesus I really want to see.
[1:41:50] And it's
[1:41:53] Jesus I
[1:41:55] really want to
[1:41:58] see want to
[1:42:02] see. And the more I
[1:42:06] see this old world, the less it means to
[1:42:13] me.
[1:42:16] For it's
[1:42:18] Jesus that I
[1:42:20] really want to
[1:42:27] see. Well, it's
[1:42:31] Jesus I
[1:42:33] really want to see.
[1:42:37] [Music]
[1:42:41] Oh, it's
[1:42:43] Jesus that I really want to
[1:42:52] see. And the more I see of this old
[1:43:00] world, the less it means to me.
[1:43:07] Oh, it's
[1:43:09] Jesus I
[1:43:11] really want to see.
