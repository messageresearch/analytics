========================================

said God help me to be honest with myself stop making excuses for myself stop passing over infractions stop saying it's because of this happened or because I have this tendency and I have a temper because my mom you know that may be true you may you may have inherited a temper from your mom but that's no excuse to let it lay there expose that thing talk about it pray about it push against it fight again don't don't don't just say it's my mom I got this because of my mom right so it's your mom's fault you just told off everybody in the room right it's mom's fault you just spoke that way to your husband or to your children that that was mom's fault no that's your fault sometimes we got to be honest I spoke with a brother one time I was speaking with talking to a ministering brother and he told me when he was a young man he was struggling with lust and he couldn't get over it and and how he had been to the altar he had been to the prayer line he had prayed he had he had read his Bible he had listened to the message he had talked to God he wanted to be free and he couldn't break free and he told me where his freedom came said I was sitting outside a brother's house and I confessed my faults to him I humbled myself and exposed where sin was hiding in my life and he said I had prayed and I went to The Altar and I went to meetings and I went to this but my Deliverance came on a porch when I told my brother what I was going through and he prayed with me and I've been free ever since God or we could say it must be okay cuz he's still blessing me I I I'll get better later I'll just better be careful that we don't leave those things lay yes because Judas left it lay demons left it lay won leave those things lay but expose those things say listen I I'm ashamed of this but I'm having trouble with this now I don't suggest you write it down for the whole church to read I [Music] mean but don't stuff it don't hide it don't act like it's okay and don't don't know in your heart you're wrong amen and wait for well if if it's wrong the preacher will say something about it you already know it's wrong why do you need the preacher to say something about it you've got a seed of God on the inside and if you got the Holy Ghost you've got the teacher that'll teach the word to you amen when that woman said brother Bram you didn't touch me tonight amen where was the holy ghost in her that would take the word and find the application in her life because the teacher should be in you not just in the pull pit that'll say well he didn't say exactly this he do need to say exactly this amen there's a teacher inside of you that'll say I'm guilty he didn't say my name and he didn't say the exact circumstance but all of a sudden I have a witness that I need to make that thing right I need to get rid of this I need to expose this in my life right amen man the danger is if we don't and we have another service next week and it's a good service and you're blessed somebody ask you to pray for them and you pray for them and they get healed that's dangerous friends that's scary I don't want to be in that spot
