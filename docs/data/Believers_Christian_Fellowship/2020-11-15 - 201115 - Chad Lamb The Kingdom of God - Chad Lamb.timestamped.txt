[4:28] but let's never miss the opportunity to
[4:30] worship his name
[4:31] in serving with our lives while we're
[4:34] standing let's take our bibles
[4:36] to mark chapter one it sounds like we're

[4:42] nobody will have to wash their cars
[4:43] later
[4:45] it'll be a blessing amen mark chapter 1
[4:49] excuse me verse 14.
[4:56] mark 1 and 14. now after that john was
[4:58] put in prison
[4:59] jesus came into galilee preaching the
[5:01] gospel of the kingdom of god
[5:03] and saying the time is fulfilled and the
[5:05] kingdom of god is at hand
[5:07] repent ye and believe the gospel may let
[5:11] savior's place there and let's bow our
[5:12] heads and pray
[5:14] dear heavenly father we ask that you
[5:15] would lord just minister
[5:19] minister unto us this morning we know
[5:21] you're the only one who can break the
[5:23] bread lord

[5:29] you are the word that's come down from
[5:31] heaven lord and you can break that word

[5:55] may walk a word walk lord
[5:57] every step in obedience to your word by
[5:59] faith
[6:00] let your spirit lead us we pray this
[6:03] morning and that you may have
[6:04] preeminence among us
[6:05] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[6:08] you can all be seated
[6:16] anyway i want to look at this scripture
[6:18] again also i forgot to mention brother
[6:20] uh ben
[6:21] siebold is up in michigan preaching for
[6:23] brother dan ratliff today
[6:25] so just remember him throughout the day
[6:26] and remember his family
[6:28] i believe they probably went with him
[6:30] but praise god
[6:32] so i know they'll have a good time up in
[6:34] michigan amen
[6:36] let's look back at here in mark chapter
[6:37] 1 verse 14.
[6:40] look at the timing it says now after
[6:43] that john was put in prison
[6:45] so jesus now after that john is put in
[6:48] prison
[6:49] he jesus comes into galilee preaching
[6:50] the gospel of the kingdom of god
[6:52] and saying the time is fulfilled amen
[6:56] or the time is complete or the time is
[6:58] full
[6:59] it's complete amen and the kingdom of
[7:01] god is at hand
[7:02] repent ye and believe the gospel because
[7:05] the forerunner ministry had to go first
[7:07] and now when john was in prison
[7:09] now he goes forth now he's declaring
[7:11] that the kingdom of god is here the
[7:13] kingdom of god is at hand amen
[7:15] and so and so we see that jesus now is
[7:18] is going through declaring the time is
[7:21] finished the time
[7:22] is full the time is complete amen just
[7:25] like
[7:26] revelations chapter 10 amen revelations
[7:29] chapter 10 the mighty angel comes down
[7:31] and said
[7:32] it'll be time no longer amen because the
[7:34] forerunner ministry had been finished
[7:36] and now
[7:36] it was time they meant for a
[7:38] dispensational change
[7:40] so now he says the time is fulfilled and
[7:42] the kingdom of god
[7:43] is at hand repent ye and believe the
[7:46] gospel
[7:47] let's turn over to luke 17 and look at
[7:50] another scripture
[7:55] luke 17 and verse 20.
[8:02] luke 17 and 20 and when he was demanded
[8:04] of the pharisees when the kingdom of god
[8:05] should come
[8:06] he answered them and said the kingdom of
[8:08] god cometh not with
[8:10] observation so jesus had told him the
[8:13] kingdom of god is at hand
[8:15] and it means to to come nigh to be near
[8:18] amen it's near you amen
[8:20] it's right here upon you
[8:23] god bless you sister man apparently you
[8:25] didn't go to michigan amen
[8:26] brother ben's family is here i was wrong
[8:29] amen luke 17 uh we want to continue on
[8:33] luke 17 20. he says
[8:35] the kingdom of god cometh not with
[8:37] observation they're saying
[8:38] you're looking for something but you're
[8:40] looking for the wrong thing amen
[8:42] the kingdom of god is drawn nigh it's
[8:44] near to you but you're looking around
[8:46] and you're saying where is it show us
[8:48] they're demanding of him the pharisees
[8:50] say
[8:50] where is the kingdom and he said the
[8:52] kingdom doesn't come with observation
[8:54] you're making a mistake in your
[8:56] assumptions amen
[8:57] and this has been the case all along and
[8:59] it's still the case today the kingdom
[9:01] cometh not with observation neither
[9:03] shall they say lo here
[9:04] or lo there for behold the kingdom of
[9:07] god is within you
[9:09] so jesus comes because the kingdom of
[9:12] god is in jesus christ
[9:13] he's coming and now the forerunner's
[9:15] ministry has finished and when john is
[9:17] now in prison
[9:18] now he goes into galilee preaching the
[9:20] kingdom of god
[9:22] saying the the time is now fulfilled the
[9:24] time is finished the time is complete
[9:29] and the kingdom of god is near you
[9:32] and the pharisees are begin looking
[9:35] about because they have ideas of what
[9:36] the kingdom of god coming means
[9:38] when the kingdom of god comes upon the
[9:40] earth amen it was supposed to
[9:42] to rid them of roman rule it was
[9:44] supposed to restore
[9:46] the kingdom of david it was it was
[9:48] supposed to bring them back to the
[9:50] glory that they had in the days of
[9:51] solomon there were natural things they
[9:54] were thinking their mind there was
[9:55] natural expectations
[9:57] now we have a forerunner and the
[9:59] forerunner now is going to
[10:00] usher in he's going to usher in the
[10:03] kingdom of god he's going to usher in
[10:04] the messiah
[10:05] and they had certain things in their
[10:07] mind that this messiah would do
[10:08] and when the kingdom the god drew nigh
[10:10] they began to watch because they're
[10:12] looking for an earthly kingdom
[10:13] they're looking for deliverance from
[10:15] rome they're looking for the
[10:16] restoration of wealth amen solomon made
[10:20] gold and silver common in the streets of
[10:22] jerusalem
[10:23] they were looking for that to return but
[10:26] they didn't realize what was coming was
[10:27] the promised word
[10:29] and it was worth more than gold in the
[10:31] streets
[10:33] there was more power coming than solomon
[10:35] had
[10:37] so then he says their conception is
[10:41] wrong
[10:42] and and jesus tells them back when we
[10:44] read in mark 1 he says the kingdom of
[10:46] god is at hand
[10:48] repent ye and believe the gospel he's
[10:50] telling you
[10:51] the kingdom of god is near believe this
[10:54] gospel amen
[10:55] repent from your wrong thing you repent
[10:57] from everything amen and believe this
[10:58] god
[11:00] then they ask him now that we're in luke
[11:03] 17 you're asking
[11:04] well where is it amen show us uh the
[11:07] kingdom of god
[11:08] should come when it should come and
[11:10] jesus is telling us
[11:11] you know you're not even thinking right
[11:13] amen see they
[11:15] asked the question the question was when
[11:17] will the kingdom of god come
[11:19] they're asking for a time frame and
[11:22] jesus doesn't give them a time frame he
[11:24] gives them a location
[11:27] because he understood what the what
[11:29] their problem was
[11:31] their problem was they weren't believing
[11:32] that the kingdom of god was on earth at
[11:34] the time they were looking for it to
[11:35] come
[11:37] and so he answers their question
[11:38] correctly but not by answering their
[11:40] question because the entire conception
[11:42] in their mind was wrong
[11:43] so he doesn't go to the human conception
[11:45] in the mind and says when are you going
[11:47] to understand you back up there's types
[11:49] and shadows
[11:49] and if you go back to john's ministry no
[11:52] he just says
[11:53] he just answers the question in a way
[11:54] that raises them if there was a seed
[11:56] there would raise them out of the wrong
[11:58] thinking
[11:59] and he doesn't answer when he answers
[12:01] where
[12:03] because if you understand where you
[12:06] realize
[12:07] now the kingdom of god is not what i
[12:09] thought it was
[12:12] not maybe i had the wrong understanding
[12:15] you see the same thing's true the coming
[12:17] of the lord we can have
[12:18] when will the lord come what will happen
[12:20] and these things will happen and that
[12:21] will happen
[12:22] and we can totally miss what's happening
[12:24] and because we don't know the location
[12:27] we're looking for the time
[12:29] and if you don't pay attention to the
[12:31] time but you listen to what the prophet
[12:33] said about the location
[12:34] amen on the son of man and how the son
[12:36] of man will come and where the son of
[12:38] man will be
[12:39] amen when he unites with his church and
[12:41] what will it do it will reproduce the
[12:42] son of man again
[12:44] and now you realize hey maybe when i was
[12:46] looking for timing i had the wrong
[12:48] understanding
[12:49] i should have been looking for location
[12:51] of this coming
[12:53] because the location of the coming comes
[12:55] at the end of the forerunner's ministry
[12:59] amen in the end of the forerunners
[13:00] ministry he says now there's time no
[13:02] longer
[13:03] now time is fulfilled now there's no
[13:06] more time
[13:07] now we're moving in to that cycle
[13:11] so the so he changes their thinking
[13:15] and he doesn't give him a location or he
[13:17] doesn't give them a time
[13:19] when the kingdom of god should come he
[13:21] answered them said the kingdom of god
[13:23] cometh not
[13:24] with observation
[13:27] they were asking when and he was saying
[13:31] you don't even see it
[13:35] because the question at hand was not
[13:38] when the question at hand was where
[13:40] amen amen and i would say the same thing
[13:44] repeats today the question that not
[13:45] a hand is not when the question at hand
[13:49] is where
[13:52] if you can answer that question then
[13:54] you're going to see a lot of things amen
[13:58] neither shall you say lo here or
[14:02] low there for the
[14:05] behold the kingdom of god is within you
[14:10] let's go to john chapter 14.
[14:16] see i've marveled at the way jesus
[14:18] answers questions
[14:20] i've always marveled in the bible how
[14:23] jesus would answer the pharisees
[14:24] questions of the scribes or other
[14:26] individuals because it's not
[14:27] the way we typically answer questions
[14:29] but jesus was always getting to the
[14:31] heart of the matter
[14:32] always and now we look at john chapter
[14:36] 14
[14:36] verse 16 it says i will pray the father
[14:40] and he shall give you another comforter
[14:44] that he may abide with you forever even
[14:47] the spirit of truth whom the world
[14:48] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[14:51] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[14:53] he dwelleth with you
[14:54] and shall be in you and now jesus amen
[14:58] to the carnal mind he speaks and riddles
[15:00] but if you have ego
[15:01] vision and can fly above the normal
[15:03] understanding of humanity
[15:05] everything he says makes perfect sense
[15:07] but he's telling them
[15:08] that that i'm going to send another
[15:10] comforter i'm going to
[15:12] pray the father he shall give you
[15:13] another comforter that he may abide with
[15:15] you forever
[15:16] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[15:18] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[15:20] neither knoweth him but you know him
[15:23] so he's doing the same thing to the
[15:24] disciples he says you know there's a
[15:26] there's a comforter coming
[15:28] from the father the spirit of truth the
[15:30] world won't receive him because they
[15:31] can't see him neither do they know him
[15:32] but you know him
[15:34] amen where where is the kingdom coming
[15:38] where is it where is it at you know him
[15:41] listen to this
[15:42] you know him for he dwelleth
[15:45] with you and shall be
[15:49] in you jesus was standing there
[15:53] amen and the comforter he was the
[15:54] comforter the comforter was him it was
[15:56] the life of god it was the holy spirit
[15:58] and full measure was in him and he's
[16:00] saying the world can't see it
[16:03] because it's invisible it's like the
[16:05] wind
[16:06] they can they can they don't know where
[16:08] it comes from or where it goes and so is
[16:09] everyone that's born of the spirit of
[16:11] god
[16:11] they can see the effects but they can't
[16:13] see it and he said neither they didn't
[16:14] know him but you know him
[16:16] right and say how do i know him amen
[16:19] when you've seen me you've seen the
[16:21] father amen you're with it
[16:23] it is this spirit that you're going to
[16:25] receive you know it
[16:26] it's with you and it will be in you
[16:31] let's keep reading
[16:36] verse 18 i will not leave you
[16:37] comfortless i will come to you
[16:41] now all of a sudden he's telling them
[16:43] what's coming well i'm going to pray to
[16:45] a father another being somewhere else
[16:47] he's going to send you a comforter
[16:48] another being somewhere else
[16:50] that comforter is with you now will be
[16:52] in you
[16:53] but i will come to you
[16:56] praise god he's beginning to clue them
[16:59] in on what's happening
[17:00] verse 19 yet a little while and the
[17:02] world sees me no more but ye see me
[17:04] because i live you shall live also at
[17:07] that day
[17:08] you shall know that i am in my father
[17:11] and ye
[17:11] in me and i in you brother brahman said
[17:15] making them all one
[17:18] who's all one you him father
[17:21] all one amen so where is the kingdom
[17:24] going to be
[17:25] the kingdom of god it doesn't come with
[17:28] observation
[17:29] the kingdom of god is it within you
[17:33] brother ben says in 1963 the world is
[17:36] again falling apart
[17:37] he preaches this message by the same
[17:39] title or very similar titles
[17:41] uh just a little over a week apart but
[17:44] this one's from uh
[17:45] november 27th we've got a quote from the
[17:47] other one later
[17:49] said i knew heaven a new heaven and a
[17:51] new earth for the first heaven and first
[17:53] earth was pas
[17:53] will pass away but in this new heaven
[17:56] and new earth paul said over here
[17:58] in the book of hebrews 14 25 he said for
[18:01] we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[18:03] moved
[18:04] how did we get into it not by a
[18:06] religious system
[18:07] but a kingdom of god is within you
[18:10] the kingdom the king in his word is the
[18:13] same
[18:14] and it's within you the king in his word
[18:17] is the same
[18:18] and it's within you amen so
[18:21] when you receive the word you receive
[18:23] the king you receive the kingdom
[18:26] amen the king in the word is the same
[18:27] and it's within you vindicating the hour
[18:29] that we're now living in
[18:31] the promise that god made for this age
[18:33] here we are
[18:34] living with the king sitting in heavenly
[18:36] places watching him
[18:38] doing these things i'd like to turn to
[18:41] hebrews before i read the next quote
[18:42] hebrews chapter 12.
[18:44] if you'll come and read that with me
[18:53] hebrews 12 and 25
[19:01] apostle paul is speaking and he says
[19:06] see that you refuse not him that
[19:07] speaketh for if they escape not who
[19:09] refused him to spake on earth
[19:12] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[19:14] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[19:16] whose voice then shook the earth but now
[19:19] he has promised saying yet once more i
[19:20] shake not the earth only
[19:22] but also heaven so how did he shake the
[19:25] earth
[19:26] by his voice how will he shake the earth
[19:28] in heaven
[19:29] by his voice by another voice
[19:33] in this word yet once more signifying
[19:35] the removing of those things that are
[19:37] shaken
[19:38] as of things that are made that those
[19:40] things which cannot be shaken
[19:42] may remain wherefore we receiving a
[19:46] kingdom which cannot be moved
[19:48] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[19:50] god acceptably
[19:52] with reverence and godly fear for our
[19:54] god is a consuming fire
[19:57] so now the apostle paul saying just as
[19:59] when god
[20:00] spoke out in mount sinai it shook the
[20:03] earth
[20:04] it was so fearful that moses did tremble
[20:06] and he did quake and he feared
[20:08] but now there's another voice coming
[20:10] he'll speak again and he'll not shake
[20:12] just the earth but it'll shake heavens
[20:14] and earth so that
[20:15] everything that can be shaken shall be
[20:17] shaken but the apostle paul says but
[20:19] we've received a kingdom that cannot be
[20:22] shaken
[20:22] amen if we want to grab something that
[20:24] will not be shaken in this day
[20:26] there's only one thing that i know of
[20:28] that will not be shaken in this way and
[20:30] it is the kingdom of god amen
[20:32] it is the kingdom of god that's coming
[20:33] to the hearts of his bride
[20:36] now i'm going to pick up the other quote
[20:37] from the world is falling apart
[20:40] it says we are dead and our lives are
[20:41] hidden god through christ
[20:43] and not only that but we are raised with
[20:44] him raised up what
[20:46] in a system a denomination organization
[20:48] we are resurrected
[20:50] in the kingdom of god so that's your new
[20:52] birth amen by the baptism the holy ghost
[20:54] we're resurrected in the kingdom of god
[20:56] the kingdom of god is within you why all
[20:59] these man-made systems must fall
[21:01] not once more i'll shake the world but
[21:03] i'll shake heavens and those things that
[21:05] can that cannot be shook is what will
[21:08] remain
[21:09] and we receive a kingdom receive a
[21:10] kingdom that cannot be shook or moved
[21:12] that's the kingdom of god not a system
[21:15] not a political wheel
[21:16] not a denomination but a kingdom amen
[21:19] and his subject is dead to the systems
[21:21] of the world
[21:22] its subjects are dead to these
[21:23] organizations it's dead to these
[21:25] political systems
[21:26] it's alive and resurrected by the power
[21:29] of the king
[21:30] and now we're in a kingdom sitting in
[21:32] heavenly places with eternal
[21:33] with the eternal king enjoying eternal
[21:36] life by the eternal word going to
[21:38] eternal heaven
[21:39] forever to be with him hallelujah living
[21:42] in the presence of the king
[21:43] i love him i'm so glad to be one of them
[21:46] i'm so glad to be dead in christ and
[21:48] alive in the kingdom of god
[21:49] this is not my home we seek a kingdom we
[21:52] seek the king
[21:53] we're already in the kingdom we seek the
[21:54] king to come and the king quickly will
[21:56] come to his kingdom
[21:58] for we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[22:00] moved
[22:02] all these other things are falling apart
[22:05] america is falling apart
[22:07] europe is falling apart asia falling
[22:10] apart
[22:11] all the world is falling apart but we
[22:14] are in a kingdom
[22:15] an eternal kingdom it cannot be moved
[22:20] that quoted that last paragraph that
[22:21] quote is truer today than it has ever
[22:23] been
[22:25] the whole system is shaking down
[22:29] under the voice of god that is struck in
[22:31] this day it is shaking
[22:32] every system down amen there's so many
[22:35] times when
[22:36] we catch these human conceptions of
[22:38] something you know when a voice
[22:40] comes and that great voice shakes down
[22:42] and and a great thunder
[22:44] but we we start thinking of you know
[22:46] everything happening immediately
[22:47] happening at once but i'll tell you that
[22:49] voice is still sounding and that voice
[22:51] is still shaking
[22:54] and it's shaking in the world we're
[22:56] watching friends we're watching world
[22:58] and world systems and religious systems
[23:00] and everything else
[23:00] we're watching it crumble away
[23:04] i said america
[23:07] is falling apart
[23:10] europe is falling apart asia
[23:13] is fine i this is amazing
[23:18] all the world is falling apart but we're
[23:21] in a kingdom an eternal kingdom
[23:23] it cannot be moved what does that mean
[23:26] friends that means the world's falling
[23:28] apart but we're not
[23:31] everything all around us can be falling
[23:33] apart and be shaken
[23:34] like there can be you know atmospheres
[23:37] of uncertainty and that uncertainty can
[23:39] get closer and closer to us
[23:41] amen there can be still more fallout
[23:44] from the
[23:45] pandemics and other things and other
[23:46] tensions that are going on
[23:48] there can be many more things that take
[23:50] place and a lot more repercussions and
[23:52] more uncertainty
[23:53] either in this wave or another wave or
[23:55] another thing that strikes there
[23:57] whatever it is
[23:59] and that uncertainty can get closer and
[24:01] closer to home it can infect our
[24:03] employment
[24:04] our jobs and it can affect all kinds of
[24:06] things
[24:08] but but we are secure
[24:11] in a kingdom that cannot be shaken
[24:14] so everything all around us becomes
[24:17] start falling apart
[24:18] we've got to realize that it has to fall
[24:21] apart
[24:22] it's got to fall apart the world is
[24:25] falling apart brother venom said
[24:26] let it fall apart and we work so hard
[24:30] sometimes to hold things together
[24:32] what we need to do is resolve ourselves
[24:34] to the fact that it's going to crumble
[24:36] it's going to burn
[24:37] everything on this earth that is not
[24:39] redeemed as cannon fodder
[24:40] will be burnt over to create a bright
[24:43] new millennium for the bridegroom and
[24:44] the bride to step
[24:45] out on it's part of god's plan it's part
[24:48] of god's program
[24:49] god foresaw and god knew and then this
[24:51] is the way things have to be
[24:53] and we don't want to fret too much about
[24:55] the way things are going
[24:57] because it's the way things need to be
[25:01] you know you can get discouraged when we
[25:04] see news and
[25:05] things changing and and the culture
[25:07] changing and the laws
[25:09] changing and the politics changing you
[25:11] can become discouraged but
[25:13] but don't let that discouragement stay
[25:15] look back to the word and realize
[25:16] these things must be this way i'm
[25:19] encouraged amen
[25:21] i told somebody the other day you know
[25:23] you know the discussion was of
[25:25] gun control and and you know my i think
[25:28] my boys were asking me because they were
[25:29] a little bit nervous about losing their
[25:31] hunting guns
[25:33] and we love to hunt you know something
[25:34] as a family that we enjoy to do
[25:36] and to do that we enjoy our guns but i
[25:38] was talking to a brother and i said
[25:40] when they when they knock on my door and
[25:42] they change the laws and we're no longer
[25:44] allowed to have a gun
[25:45] and it's forbidden you know what i'm not
[25:47] going to be burying him in my backyard
[25:48] i'm not going to be storing up
[25:49] ammunition i'm not going to start a
[25:51] fight with the government because these
[25:52] things have to go that way
[25:54] i will take my gun in my hand i will
[25:56] forfeit it with a smile on my face
[25:58] because my days on earth are almost done
[26:02] i'm part of a kingdom that can't be
[26:03] shaking if you take this from me you'll
[26:05] never take the millennium from me
[26:07] you'll never take my position in
[26:08] security in christ you'll never
[26:10] take the peace that i have in my heart
[26:12] you can take privileges you can take
[26:14] rights
[26:14] amen you can take anything you want but
[26:17] you're not going to take the kingdom
[26:19] away
[26:19] the kingdom is here on earth it's in the
[26:21] heart of his bride
[26:25] everything else is moving in response to
[26:28] this bride's maturity
[26:31] if you're losing privileges it's your
[26:32] fault
[26:34] [Music]
[26:37] it has to be this way
[26:44] i just say if i could say it this way
[26:47] don't waste a lot of energy fighting for
[26:49] things
[26:50] that don't mean much
[26:53] don't waste a lot of energy fighting for
[26:56] stuff
[26:57] that is going to burn
[27:01] let's stick with the thing that cannot
[27:03] be shaken
[27:05] let's devote our time and attention and
[27:07] our heart into the very thing
[27:09] that'll bring us through the very
[27:11] foundation that we stand on the very
[27:13] rock that we are planted with
[27:14] amen the very thing that gives us peace
[27:18] when the storms roll all around let's
[27:20] pay attention to those things
[27:21] and if we have to relinquish some some
[27:23] rights we relinquish them
[27:25] because i i'm coming my inheritance is
[27:28] secure
[27:29] there's things that we're moving through
[27:31] and in order to get from here
[27:32] to that bright new millennium all chaos
[27:36] has to break out
[27:38] oh chaos has to break out amen and it's
[27:41] going to go on all around us and these
[27:43] things are going to be
[27:44] things that have to happen to move
[27:46] prophecy along we know that there'll be
[27:48] a greater tightening up and a squeeze to
[27:49] come to the bride there'll be a greater
[27:51] persecution and pressures that are going
[27:53] to come
[27:53] i mean we know that she's going to try
[27:55] to keep her from preaching going to try
[27:56] to shut the churches down
[27:57] and we'll successfully close the doors
[27:59] of churches we know that there's
[28:01] prophecy out there
[28:02] for that and if it's got to go that way
[28:05] amen we don't want to fret when it goes
[28:07] that way when things begin to tighten up
[28:09] and persecutions come and loss of rights
[28:12] and privileges come
[28:13] all we've done is confirm that brother
[28:15] branham was right
[28:17] that the prophet god sent us was correct
[28:19] and this is everything is
[28:20] clicking right on time these things has
[28:23] to be this way
[28:28] praise god
[28:31] you know so many
[28:35] so many things can trouble us
[28:39] if we lose focus of what really matters
[28:42] we can get so bothered and so bent out
[28:44] of shape and so angry and so frustrated
[28:47] and that's just the normal that's just a
[28:49] human i was reading a quote the other
[28:51] day where brother branham says
[28:52] we're we're we're not citizens from here
[28:54] we're citizens from heaven
[28:56] we need to act like that we're
[28:58] reflecting heaven with citizens from
[28:59] heaven
[29:00] but listen what he said he said now not
[29:02] our flesh our flesh
[29:04] is citizens of america
[29:08] but in our spirit our souls were
[29:10] citizens of heaven
[29:12] so that's why brother branham because he
[29:14] was a citizen of america he wouldn't
[29:16] break the speed limit sign
[29:19] you see what i'm saying he was subject
[29:21] to the place god put him in the flesh
[29:23] and in the flesh walk he was subject to
[29:25] certain things amen because of the place
[29:27] god put him under the jurisdiction and
[29:29] rule that god allowed to have
[29:30] over his life and he was he was
[29:32] beginning to explain this to that
[29:34] but you know america is falling away
[29:36] it'll collapse it'll
[29:37] crumble one day there will be no america
[29:41] but the kingdom of david the throne of
[29:43] david will be established on the earth
[29:45] and i'll be part of that kingdom because
[29:46] i'm a citizen from heaven
[29:48] so as the atmosphere changes and as the
[29:52] news
[29:53] changes and as things change don't get
[29:55] caught up in it
[29:57] you know it's i i've heard talk and
[30:00] people say
[30:01] you know george washington he was a
[30:03] christian man and he fought for this and
[30:04] that
[30:05] but that was george washington's day
[30:08] this isn't george washington's day
[30:10] you know god brother brahm called him a
[30:13] christian man and talked about him
[30:14] praying before he crossed valley forge
[30:16] but we know that there had to be an
[30:18] america
[30:19] there had to be an america there had to
[30:21] be but there had to be an america for
[30:23] the prophet to come out of there had to
[30:25] be freedom of religion for
[30:26] the message to go around god was using
[30:28] his tools god was using
[30:30] his people to bring about his purpose
[30:32] and he had christians in the early days
[30:34] want freedom and
[30:35] they actually rebelled against authority
[30:37] they've done all these things
[30:38] to create a united states of america
[30:40] they mentioned there could be religious
[30:42] freedom so that
[30:42] so that so that that the plan of god can
[30:45] move forward and the prophet could come
[30:46] from here
[30:48] we agree but this is not that day
[30:53] brother branham said america's refused
[30:56] its day of grace
[30:58] and he says i no longer pray for her
[31:02] well if he's not going to pray for her
[31:04] why fight for her
[31:07] right if the prophet is no longer going
[31:09] to pray for it why fight for
[31:11] but think about this maybe those godly
[31:14] men
[31:14] amen were fighting for religious freedom
[31:16] and all of that
[31:18] but it's still the very thing that they
[31:21] created
[31:22] is the very thing in revelation chapter
[31:25] 13 that will turn the world back to the
[31:27] b
[31:28] system so you've got to
[31:31] you've got to look at the whole picture
[31:33] of this thing and say you know
[31:35] it was it's so you know what what a
[31:37] glorious start to america and what a
[31:38] glorious foundation on christian
[31:40] principles
[31:41] god allowed all of that it had to come
[31:43] had to come on christian principles
[31:45] so that the beast amen the two horned
[31:47] beasts that came up
[31:48] amen the the civil and ecclesiastical
[31:51] two horns would unite
[31:53] in this beast that looked like a lamb
[31:54] but brother branham said was a buffalo
[31:57] that had to happen so god would move
[31:59] some of his children
[32:00] and by an anointing he would move them
[32:02] amen to to create an america create a
[32:04] scenario
[32:05] create this where religious freedom
[32:07] would be because there had to be
[32:08] a an ecclesiastical and a political horn
[32:14] so we don't want to go back and repeat
[32:17] what george washington did that was
[32:18] accomplished
[32:19] now we're in another day we want to find
[32:21] our purpose in this day
[32:22] what day are we and what are we in and
[32:24] what does god want us to do today
[32:30] if you think about even think about in
[32:32] the bible
[32:34] brother benham said that it was always a
[32:36] curse
[32:38] for a true israelite a hebrew to leave
[32:40] the promised land
[32:42] he said it was always a curse to leave
[32:44] the promised land and we know the story
[32:46] of joseph and his brethren joseph gets
[32:47] sold into bondage and he
[32:49] comes to the right hand of power amen
[32:51] and he calls for his father
[32:53] and his brothers to come back in the
[32:54] time of family says they'll take care of
[32:56] them
[32:56] amen jacob was not isaac was not so our
[32:59] jacob
[32:59] who became israel was not supposed to
[33:01] leave that promised land
[33:03] what could persuade him to come nothing
[33:06] but his son on the throne
[33:08] and he moved down there amen and they
[33:10] were blessed and they were prospered but
[33:12] it was that
[33:13] very move that would put them into
[33:15] bondage
[33:16] and they would become slaves because it
[33:18] had to happen to fulfill
[33:20] prophecy because he already told abraham
[33:22] that your children should sow jordan in
[33:23] a strange land
[33:24] for 400 years so just because that
[33:28] happened
[33:29] doesn't mean that israelites could
[33:31] always leave the promised land and be
[33:32] blessed
[33:33] amen they left the promised land god
[33:35] moved it that way because of his
[33:36] prophecy but it turned
[33:38] into bondage and this america
[33:41] turned into the beast of revelation 13.
[33:47] so let's not let's not be
[33:50] looking in a rearview mirror but let's
[33:53] be looking forward friends
[33:56] and saying what does god want me to do
[33:57] now
[33:59] i'd say what god wants me to do now
[34:03] is not look to anything that is going to
[34:06] be shaken
[34:09] but to focus on that kingdom that cannot
[34:11] be moved
[34:13] and let everything else go the way it's
[34:16] supposed to go and i pray that god will
[34:21] help me
[34:22] not to let my blood pressure go up one
[34:24] point
[34:26] and i need some help i need some help
[34:30] with this
[34:30] but i pray that god will help me not
[34:33] lose control of my emotions not get
[34:35] discouraged
[34:36] not be downcast and downtrodden when i
[34:38] see the whole world
[34:39] moving in step to the prophecy to the
[34:42] fulfillment of what the prophet told us
[34:43] was going to happen
[34:44] amen we should be looking up and
[34:46] rejoicing we should be saying
[34:48] praise god this is everything he said
[34:50] was going to happen
[34:51] what's happening amen the kingdom is
[34:54] coming the manifestation amen amen the
[34:56] kingdom is here
[34:57] but we're going to move from this phase
[34:59] to the next phase
[35:02] and that's a good thing for us friends
[35:05] so we're looking at a kingdom that
[35:08] cannot be moved
[35:12] in christ the mystery of god revealed
[35:15] brent says
[35:16] then our headship is a kingdom
[35:19] the kingdom of god is within you said
[35:21] the bi says the bible jesus the kingdom
[35:24] we are not a denomination we belong to a
[35:26] kingdom and the kingdom
[35:28] is the word of god made spirit and life
[35:30] in our own life
[35:32] so what is the kingdom of god the
[35:33] kingdom of god is the word
[35:36] is the word of god made spirit and life
[35:39] in our own life
[35:41] bringing to pass every promise in this
[35:43] day as it did
[35:44] in that day when the word and god was
[35:46] one and the word in god
[35:48] is one in his church today making it the
[35:50] headship of the body that is redeemed
[35:52] to bring the message in the last day and
[35:54] to be taken up from the dead in the
[35:56] resurrection to go back and restore
[35:58] again as adam and eve in the beginning
[36:00] in the garden of eden
[36:01] the threefold mystery of god his body
[36:04] so my question is is the kingdom of god
[36:06] on earth
[36:08] yes the kingdom of god is on earth the
[36:11] kingdom of god
[36:12] doesn't come with observation or lo
[36:16] here or lo there but the kingdom of god
[36:18] is within you
[36:21] it is the word of god made spirit and
[36:23] life
[36:24] through a new birth the word of god made
[36:26] spirit and life in you
[36:30] he says in the future home even the
[36:32] blood dropped it's yet got to be
[36:34] cleansed by fire
[36:35] he's talking about the redemption of the
[36:36] earth the blood dropped on the earth
[36:39] when jesus christ was crucified
[36:41] he was claiming it back paying the
[36:43] purchase price for all of creation
[36:44] but it says it's yet got to be cleansed
[36:46] by fire that's right for a dwelling
[36:48] place for god
[36:49] god already took up his abode
[36:51] potentially the kingdom of god is in the
[36:53] earth now
[36:54] in the hearts of his saints it's his
[36:56] attributes that he began in the
[36:58] beginning
[36:59] now his attribute is redeemed what's he
[37:01] waiting
[37:02] so this this is what i want to i want
[37:04] you to catch
[37:05] he says his attributes are redeemed the
[37:07] kingdom is here
[37:08] in the hearts of his people what's he
[37:10] waiting to redeem the earth
[37:13] so what's he waiting for to burn the
[37:15] earth
[37:17] right there's been a baptism of water
[37:20] and noah days a baptism with blood
[37:22] jesus christ is crucified but there'll
[37:23] be a baptism of fire
[37:25] and then he'll set the millennium in
[37:28] so he says what's he waiting to do to
[37:30] redeem the earth to set his attributes
[37:32] on it to fulfill
[37:33] exactly his predestinated plan do you
[37:36] see it
[37:37] we're at that time amen the kingdom of
[37:39] god is here
[37:40] the redemption has come to the bride
[37:42] amen the kingdom is
[37:43] here here the word of god has made
[37:46] spirit and life
[37:47] in her amen she is the manifestation of
[37:49] this hour
[37:50] amen she is here declaring the kingdom
[37:53] of god
[37:53] but what's he waiting for there's
[37:55] another step and that other step is the
[37:57] burning of fire
[37:58] amen to set the kingdom of david back on
[38:00] the earth
[38:01] and everything that's happening now is
[38:03] moving towards that
[38:06] again a future homie says when he went
[38:08] up out of the water he said
[38:10] i saw heavens open the prophet saw it he
[38:12] saw the heavens open
[38:14] and here come descending out of heaven a
[38:16] form of a dove
[38:17] and a voice saying this is my part of
[38:19] the earth that i have redeemed
[38:22] and from this part of the earth i will
[38:24] redeem the rest of it
[38:26] so now when the dove is coming which is
[38:28] the holy ghost god's coming
[38:30] amen in the river jordan when when when
[38:32] john is baptizing jesus sees the heaven
[38:34] open
[38:35] in a holy holy ghost in the form of a
[38:37] dove descending and resting upon
[38:39] jesus christ said then brother man says
[38:41] this is
[38:42] my part of the earth that i have
[38:44] redeemed
[38:46] because jesus body was made out of the
[38:48] earth
[38:50] but the holy fire of god coming down
[38:53] and was claiming and then redeeming and
[38:56] claiming this part of the earth
[38:58] so when john saw this scene take place
[39:00] it was the spirit of god claiming i'm
[39:02] claiming
[39:02] this part of the earth and from this
[39:05] part of the earth
[39:07] i will redeem the rest of it for he is
[39:10] my word made manifest in the whole world
[39:13] i spoke it into existence by my word
[39:15] hebrews 11 and satan has held it all
[39:17] this time
[39:18] but i've come to redeem it so much of it
[39:21] has made this body
[39:22] and i'm coming to dwell in it so i don't
[39:25] want you to forget that did he come
[39:26] down in the in the form of the holy
[39:28] ghost to claim
[39:29] this part of the earth and from this
[39:31] part of the earth he'll redeem the rest
[39:33] of it
[39:35] now i want to take a few minutes and i
[39:37] want to look at some scriptures so we're
[39:39] going to flip through the bible quite a
[39:40] bit here
[39:43] but let's turn the book of mark
[39:49] we're going to be in the first few books
[39:51] of the new testament here for a few
[39:52] minutes
[39:53] i want to take a look
[39:56] at the nature of the kingdom because the
[40:00] kingdom was on earth in jesus christ
[40:02] but they didn't know him neither did
[40:04] they see it they were looking
[40:06] for a physical rule of a physical king
[40:10] and the kingdom was here the the word of
[40:12] god made spirit and life in jesus christ
[40:15] and they missed it but i want to look at
[40:17] the nature of that kingdom
[40:19] in jesus christ because i want us to
[40:21] understand some things about ourselves
[40:23] because we know the kingdom is still
[40:24] here
[40:26] in the hearts of his saints so i want to
[40:28] understand it there so i can understand
[40:30] it here
[40:31] mark chapter 1 verse 9.
[40:45] john chapter or mark chapter one verse
[40:47] nine and it came to pass in those days
[40:49] that jesus came from nazareth of galilee
[40:51] and was baptized
[40:52] of john and jordan and straight ray
[40:54] coming up out of the water he saw the
[40:55] heavens open in the spirit like a dove
[40:57] descending upon him
[40:59] and there came a voice from heaven
[41:00] saying thou art my beloved son in whom i
[41:02] am well pleased
[41:04] and immediately the spirit driveth him
[41:07] into the wilderness this is the part
[41:10] that i want to i want to focus on
[41:12] immediately the spirit driveth him into
[41:14] the wilderness and he was there in the
[41:16] wilderness 40 days tempted of satan
[41:18] and was with the wild beast and the
[41:20] angels ministered unto him
[41:23] so now this this great declaration comes
[41:26] i've redeemed this part of the earth and
[41:27] from this part of the earth i'll redeem
[41:28] the rest
[41:29] amen the the sign that john was told to
[41:32] watch for
[41:33] and now the nature of the kingdom coming
[41:36] amen the first thing that happens is the
[41:38] spirit driveth him into the wilderness
[41:40] leadeth him out into the wilderness to
[41:42] be tempted of the devil
[41:45] he realized the first thing that he does
[41:47] is not go
[41:48] and start smashing down a systems of man
[41:51] and go out and start the first thing he
[41:54] does
[41:56] is go and be tempted of the devil
[41:59] in the wilderness and
[42:02] and so many times i i think in our
[42:06] own ideas and our own approaches
[42:11] we hear quotes there's some powerful
[42:13] quotes out there about our position in
[42:15] christ
[42:16] about who we really are in our position
[42:18] in christ
[42:20] and there was nobody that had a position
[42:22] with god like christ had
[42:24] like jesus christ anybody have a greater
[42:28] position
[42:30] but that position didn't produce
[42:34] a life of ease and an exercise of power
[42:38] that would keep him from any suffering
[42:41] any hardship
[42:42] any subjection to the through the world
[42:45] and the system the world
[42:46] elements of the world that that kingdom
[42:48] coming that power that position that he
[42:50] had
[42:51] amen that did not build for him an
[42:53] earthly kingdom
[42:55] of great praise and adoration and
[42:57] comfort and easy living
[42:59] but that kingdom coming amen was the
[43:02] word
[43:02] and that it was the word made spirit and
[43:04] life amen and when that word was made
[43:06] spirit and life
[43:07] it had to go through a testing phase
[43:09] where it would go out into the
[43:10] wilderness
[43:11] away from mankind out alone to be tested
[43:15] to be tempted tested of satan
[43:18] and and i i wonder if the same thing
[43:21] can't happen to us
[43:24] we've got a glorious position we're in a
[43:26] kingdom that cannot be shaken
[43:27] all powerful almighty i mean the word of
[43:30] god that cannot be defeated
[43:31] amen and all of a sudden we see
[43:33] sometimes weaknesses we see
[43:35] trials we see difficulties amen
[43:38] and those trials and those difficulties
[43:41] the devil will come along
[43:42] and try to make you doubt that you're
[43:44] part of a kingdom
[43:46] doubt that you're part of an
[43:47] all-powerful almighty unshakeable
[43:50] unmovable kingdom because your whole
[43:52] life is falling apart
[43:53] and you're being tempted and tested in
[43:55] ways that are shaking you all around
[43:57] and everything's falling apart and the
[44:00] devil will try to make you
[44:02] a doubt or question whether or not
[44:05] you're in this kingdom because this
[44:06] shouldn't happen
[44:07] to the bride this shouldn't happen to
[44:09] people in the kingdom this shouldn't
[44:10] happen
[44:13] but it's the very thing that happened to
[44:15] jesus christ
[44:18] and if it happened to him won't it
[44:19] happen to us
[44:22] in the laodicean church age
[44:25] from the church age book he says a quick
[44:28] look at those scriptures which involve
[44:30] the lord jesus overcoming
[44:32] will bring out the truth of this
[44:33] proposition in matthew 4 where jesus is
[44:36] tempted of the devil he overcame the
[44:38] the personal temptations of satan by the
[44:40] word
[44:42] and by the word only in each of the
[44:45] three major trials
[44:47] the the corresponding that corresponded
[44:50] exactly to the temptation in the garden
[44:52] of eden
[44:53] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[44:55] eyes and the pride of life
[44:56] jesus overcame by the word he fell
[45:00] to personal temptation of satan by
[45:01] failing to use the word adam fell in
[45:04] direct disobedience to the word
[45:06] but jesus overcame by the word
[45:09] and right now let me say that this is
[45:11] the only way to be an overcomer
[45:13] also it is the only way that you can
[45:15] know if you are overcoming
[45:18] because the word can't fail
[45:23] that's an interesting statement that's
[45:25] the only way you can know that you're
[45:27] overcoming
[45:31] but in the trial
[45:34] in the testing when you're taking the
[45:37] word and driving back the enemy by the
[45:39] word
[45:39] you're just taking the word and you're
[45:41] just confessing the word because he's
[45:43] the high priest of our profession
[45:44] so you're saying by his stripes i'm
[45:46] healed
[45:48] and and by his stripes i'm healed it was
[45:50] paid for at calvary i resist you devil
[45:52] in the name of jesus christ
[45:53] because i'm a child of god and all the
[45:56] promises are mine
[45:57] and i'm healed in jesus name i'm already
[45:59] healed
[46:00] and none of the symptoms change
[46:04] and none of the symptoms change now you
[46:07] realize
[46:08] jesus didn't say this is how we know
[46:11] we're overcoming we'll know we're
[46:12] overcoming when the symptoms change
[46:15] brother brahm didn't he didn't say it
[46:17] that way and so we got to be very
[46:19] careful
[46:19] that sometimes amen see brother branham
[46:22] said this bride
[46:23] has to be tested like adam's bride was
[46:27] so if you're the bride if there's been a
[46:29] last adam a second adam
[46:31] and you're that part of that last adam
[46:34] that eve that bride that's united with
[46:36] him
[46:36] if you are part of that kingdom amen and
[46:38] that kingdom is in you
[46:40] you have to go to the same testing that
[46:42] eve went to
[46:43] and eve was tested amen and she was
[46:46] tested on three points
[46:47] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[46:49] flesh and the pride of life
[46:51] and that is the testing that this bride
[46:54] is going under
[46:55] right now every day
[46:58] we're being tested lust of the eyes
[47:01] lust of the flesh pride of life and the
[47:04] only way you'll know you're overcoming
[47:06] [Music]
[47:08] is because you take the word
[47:11] not because the temptation goes away and
[47:14] not
[47:15] because the trial ends and not because
[47:18] the symptoms change
[47:21] because true overcoming is true success
[47:25] amen is not just when the symptoms
[47:27] change
[47:28] and remember when something in you rises
[47:31] up
[47:31] and you take the word regardless of what
[47:33] your eyes see
[47:34] or your body feels or what's going on in
[47:36] your head and your emotional realm
[47:38] but you stay with the word and the word
[47:40] only that's overcoming
[47:44] and we get the wrong idea that this is a
[47:47] mighty victorious invincible army
[47:49] marching through you know we we get the
[47:52] wrong idea
[47:53] that overcoming is only when we're
[47:56] finally healed because we will be healed
[47:58] and that is overcoming but i tell you
[48:01] friends that's not
[48:02] that's not the way you know you're
[48:03] overcoming the way you know you're
[48:05] overcoming is you stay with the word
[48:06] because the word can't fail
[48:10] and we we hit times realize we all hit
[48:12] times in our lives
[48:13] where where things cycle we run through
[48:15] cycles brother man tells us
[48:17] all the time he makes it so clear that
[48:19] we run through cycles he said churches
[48:21] go through night cycles family go
[48:22] through night cycles
[48:23] he goes you'll be up on the mountaintop
[48:25] and down in the valley and all those
[48:26] things are to grow
[48:27] us you'll hit a time when answered
[48:30] prayer answer prayer answer prayer
[48:32] things are moving
[48:33] supernatural things are working in your
[48:34] life and then you'll go down into a time
[48:37] where
[48:37] you're praying the same prayer you
[48:39] believe the same things but it seems
[48:41] like
[48:41] nothing will move
[48:46] well was i overcoming there not
[48:47] overcoming here
[48:49] was that success in this failure
[48:52] absolutely not
[48:54] amen the only way you'll know you're
[48:56] overcoming
[48:57] is when you take the word because the
[48:58] word is the only thing that can't fail
[49:02] see we have to go to the testing friends
[49:04] we have to
[49:06] this bride has to be tested the same way
[49:09] eve was tested
[49:11] and you have to face it and the only way
[49:13] you'll know you're overcoming
[49:15] is if you stick with the word
[49:20] brother brahman says now he says that
[49:22] jesus gave us this example
[49:24] when he was tested this way lust of the
[49:26] eyes pride of life
[49:28] lust of the flesh he said listen he says
[49:31] satan
[49:31] taken him up in the temple whitewashed
[49:33] the scriptures for him said it is
[49:34] written
[49:35] again he taken him up on the mountain
[49:37] showed him all the kingdoms
[49:38] and jesus said it is written and he
[49:41] defeated the devil by the word of god
[49:43] never used any power at all
[49:46] listen this was the kingdom of god on
[49:48] earth
[49:49] this was the kingdom of god on earth and
[49:51] it was being tested in this man
[49:53] amen in the kingdom of god amen coming
[49:56] to earth
[49:56] it wasn't so god could show off powers
[49:59] it wasn't
[49:59] amen just it was being tested in a man
[50:03] to show
[50:03] that the word will not fail in this man
[50:08] it's the word test that's the greatest
[50:10] test
[50:12] he said defeated the devil by the word
[50:13] he never used any power at all
[50:15] bringing every devil divine blessing
[50:18] down
[50:18] in the reach of the humblest and weakest
[50:20] christian as long as you'll believe that
[50:22] that's the word of god
[50:23] and say it's written it'll defeat satan
[50:26] anywhere
[50:27] anytime on any conditions the word of
[50:30] god
[50:30] it certainly will
[50:35] in the patmos vision out of the church
[50:38] age book
[50:40] remember it says don't fear john don't
[50:42] fear little flock
[50:44] all that i am your heir to all my power
[50:47] is yours
[50:49] my omnipotence is yours as i stand in
[50:51] your midst
[50:52] i have not come to bring fear and
[50:54] failure but love and courage and ability
[50:57] all power is given unto me and it's
[50:59] yours to use
[51:01] you speak the word and i will perform it
[51:04] that is my covenant
[51:05] and it can never fail all power is mine
[51:08] and jersey used how
[51:10] by speaking the word by speaking the
[51:12] word and believing it
[51:15] all the way back in creation in the
[51:16] genesis account god spoke his word and
[51:19] had to believe his own word
[51:21] and to watch it come to pass now we
[51:24] believe his word we have to speak his
[51:25] word
[51:26] amen we're not here for fear we're not
[51:28] here to be troubled we're we're here to
[51:30] have love
[51:30] and joy and a security and an
[51:32] understanding but how do we defeat the
[51:34] devil how do we overcome in this day by
[51:37] speaking the word by staying with the
[51:38] word
[51:39] and letting him perform the word amen
[51:43] amen i think sometimes
[51:47] i just talk about me because i don't
[51:49] know about you
[51:52] sometimes we get discouraged because we
[51:53] want to see great manifestations of
[51:55] power
[51:57] great manifestations of power and great
[52:01] and i believe there'll be there are and
[52:03] will be and maybe many more
[52:04] manifestations of power
[52:06] in the bride i believe that spoken word
[52:09] all kinds of things but sometimes we get
[52:11] discouraged because we want to
[52:13] see more and then see more dynamic power
[52:15] and we're the bride and this is the word
[52:17] and all of that
[52:18] but the test amen the test comes on the
[52:21] back side of the desert when you're all
[52:23] alone
[52:23] and you're being tested can you stick
[52:25] with the word and stay with the word and
[52:26] watch him perform the word so that he
[52:28] gets all the credit for the supernatural
[52:31] so his powers on display so that his
[52:33] might is on display and so that he is
[52:35] glorified
[52:37] so much of our desire for great dynamics
[52:40] sometimes
[52:40] is just a desire for ourselves to be
[52:43] vindicated
[52:45] for ourselves to be declared you know uh
[52:48] whatever
[52:50] but that's not god brother branham says
[52:53] in 1961 in the message expectations
[52:57] is that a true great revival
[53:01] it don't get headlines and things like
[53:03] that
[53:04] no no there's one thing that jesus
[53:06] christ lacked in his life
[53:08] oh this is gonna be good there's one
[53:11] thing jesus christ lacked in his life
[53:15] i hate to say that but he did jesus
[53:18] lacked one thing
[53:19] a modern showmanship he wasn't a
[53:23] show-off
[53:23] no everybody today has got to have a
[53:26] great big headlines and bragging
[53:28] what they're doing that's a stuffed
[53:29] shirt that's right that's not a servant
[53:31] of god
[53:32] a servant of god will be humble keeping
[53:35] himself
[53:35] back oh this is amazing quote friends
[53:40] amen uh he wasn't a modern he didn't
[53:43] have any modern showmanship
[53:44] and brother bam says this several times
[53:46] that jesus was lacking something he
[53:48] lacked showmanship
[53:49] he didn't have any showmanship he didn't
[53:51] do anything for show he didn't do
[53:52] anything for the approval of man
[53:54] he only did what the father showed him
[53:56] to be pleasing to the father
[53:58] he did amen remember when brother brown
[54:00] tells us about him going down by the
[54:02] pool of bethesda
[54:03] and there's all kinds of halton lame and
[54:05] blind and crippled and they're there at
[54:06] the pool of bethesda
[54:08] and he steps over and steps around all
[54:10] the sick and all the lame
[54:11] and he goes to one man who's had a
[54:13] condition 38 years and he heals that one
[54:15] man
[54:16] and he leaves amen and brother bam said
[54:18] why he said because that's what the
[54:20] father showed him to do
[54:21] amen he wasn't there seeking attention
[54:25] he wasn't there for his own glory
[54:27] he was there the kingdom was on earth
[54:28] and it was the kingdom of god
[54:30] amen and it was not for show-off it
[54:32] wasn't it wasn't to play with
[54:34] amen it wasn't for just demonstrations
[54:36] of power that would bring glory to man
[54:38] it was for god's purpose god was working
[54:40] his purpose
[54:41] and everything must be done for god's
[54:43] purpose
[54:46] let's look at the bible i want to look
[54:47] at a couple places in matthew let's
[54:49] start in matthew
[54:51] matthew chapter eight verse three i'm
[54:54] going to read about four or five
[54:55] scriptures back to back here
[55:02] matthew chapter 8 verse 3.
[55:11] and jesus put forth his hand and touched
[55:13] him saying
[55:14] i will be thou clean this is to a leper
[55:17] and immediately his leprosy was cleansed
[55:20] and jesus saith unto him see thou tell
[55:23] no man
[55:24] but go thy way and show thyself to the
[55:26] priests and offer the gift that moses
[55:28] commanded
[55:29] for a testimony unto thee
[55:35] what would happen to that in a modern
[55:37] pentecostal church
[55:41] let's go to mark chapter 7.
[55:56] mark chapter 7 and verse 34
[56:00] and looking up to heaven he sighed and
[56:02] he saith unto them
[56:03] ephitha that is be open and straightway
[56:07] his ears were open and the string of his
[56:09] tongue was loosed and he spake plain
[56:11] and he charged them that they should
[56:12] tell no man
[56:14] but the more he charged them so much the
[56:16] more the great deal they published it
[56:19] what was jesus approach he just he just
[56:23] opened the ears and the tongue of a deaf
[56:26] mute
[56:27] and he says don't tell nobody let's look
[56:30] at mark chapter 8 verse 29
[56:35] 8 29 he says unto them
[56:38] but whom say ye that i am and peter
[56:40] answered and saith unto him thou art the
[56:42] christ
[56:42] and he charged them that they should
[56:44] tell no man of him
[56:46] luke chapter 8 go over to luke chapter 8
[56:52] and verse 54.
[56:56] luke chapter 8 verse 54.
[57:00] and he put them all out and he took her
[57:02] by the hand and he called saying
[57:03] made arise and her spirit came again and
[57:06] she arose straightway
[57:08] and he commanded to give her meat and
[57:10] her parents were astonished but he
[57:12] charged him that they should tell no man
[57:14] what was done
[57:16] let's go to john chapter five i think
[57:18] you're getting the point
[57:20] but we'll read one more just to seal the
[57:22] deal
[57:23] john chapter 5.
[57:27] verse 19 then answered jesus and said
[57:31] unto them
[57:31] verily verily i say unto you the son can
[57:34] do nothing of himself but what he seeth
[57:36] the father do
[57:37] for what things so ever he doeth these
[57:39] also doeth the sun
[57:41] likewise but then use this scripture
[57:43] over and over to tell us that jesus was
[57:45] led by vision he didn't just go out
[57:46] randomly doing whatever he wanted to do
[57:49] he did what god led him to do for god's
[57:51] purpose god's way
[57:52] and when he would do something he would
[57:54] tell the people often times now don't
[57:56] tell anybody
[57:57] peter and them caught the revelation he
[57:59] was the christ he said don't tell
[58:00] anybody
[58:01] he raised the dead don't tell anybody
[58:02] open the deaf ears don't tell anybody
[58:06] see jesus wasn't showing off he wasn't
[58:08] there for himself he was there for god
[58:11] and i longed to get to the place where
[58:13] i'm not living this life for myself but
[58:16] i'm only living it for god
[58:17] where i say you know what by his stripes
[58:20] i'm healed that i'm delivered in the
[58:22] name of jesus christ but if god chooses
[58:24] to delay my healing then god be praised
[58:26] there's a purpose in it
[58:28] and i want to be delivered amen but if
[58:30] god doesn't want me delivered then
[58:31] praise god
[58:32] there's a purpose in it amen i mean
[58:34] there's a purpose in what god's doing
[58:36] and i want to be satisfied in his
[58:38] purpose but i want to be so
[58:39] sure that i'm part of that kingdom that
[58:41] that kingdom is within me
[58:43] that i know every move in my life is
[58:45] orchestrated by god
[58:46] what he allows and he doesn't allow is
[58:48] according to his will and i want to be
[58:50] satisfied with his will in my life and
[58:52] all i want to do is take his word and
[58:54] speak it and let him perform it
[58:57] amen we've got a right to claim the word
[58:59] whatever situation comes upon
[59:01] us amen it's for us amen to overcome by
[59:04] the word it's a testing by the word
[59:06] we must take the word and fight back
[59:07] devils take the word and resist the
[59:09] enemy
[59:10] amen but let the power of god bring it
[59:12] to pass it's not for us to prove what we
[59:15] are
[59:15] it's to prove that this word is works
[59:17] and we stand with the word
[59:20] the proving of the bride amen is not the
[59:22] demonstration of power
[59:24] because the pentecostals can demonstrate
[59:26] power but the proving of the bride
[59:28] is that she stays with the word
[59:34] praise god let that be our satisfying
[59:37] portion
[59:38] let the word be our satisfaction let the
[59:40] revelation of the word be our
[59:41] satisfaction
[59:43] and let god do whatever he wants to do
[59:47] in 1953 brother branham is talking about
[59:50] a situation that they face in the
[59:52] campaigns
[59:53] and he says one time it happened to be
[59:55] one of my managers
[59:56] not brother baxter but it was a man who
[59:58] was with us one of the field managers
[1:00:01] and a newspaper had made a very critical
[1:00:03] statement that was absolutely untrue
[1:00:06] i can expect friendly criticism but
[1:00:08] criticism wasn't due because it was
[1:00:09] untrue
[1:00:11] as long as it's true all right praise
[1:00:14] god
[1:00:14] brother man i'm saying if you criticize
[1:00:15] me telling the truth that's fine
[1:00:19] but then he says listen but the
[1:00:22] criticism wasn't due because it was
[1:00:23] untrue as long as it's truth all right
[1:00:25] but it wasn't true
[1:00:26] and this manager said why don't you go
[1:00:28] out there and kneel on your knees and
[1:00:30] tell god to burn that place down
[1:00:33] and i said oh brother don't think he
[1:00:35] said what we need today is some more
[1:00:37] elijahs
[1:00:38] he was talking to elijah
[1:00:42] he was talking to elijah but he had his
[1:00:45] own idea what power was
[1:00:46] his own idea of what standing up for the
[1:00:48] word was he had his
[1:00:50] own concept of what he what should be
[1:00:52] done in this situation
[1:00:53] and it had nothing to do with the mind
[1:00:55] of god
[1:00:57] he said what we need today is some more
[1:00:58] elijah said elijah would have called
[1:01:00] fire out of heaven
[1:01:02] said he would have done what he would
[1:01:04] have done to the fifty
[1:01:06] well the brother was just mistaken see
[1:01:08] elijah did not call fire out of heaven
[1:01:10] only but when god showed him he said oh
[1:01:14] brother branham said
[1:01:15] elijah just went out there and boldly
[1:01:17] challenged and said
[1:01:18] come out and prove who's god i said no
[1:01:20] he never
[1:01:22] god told him first
[1:01:25] oh he said he never seen no vision i
[1:01:27] said yes he did
[1:01:29] i said when he said when he put all his
[1:01:30] bull lock and so forth on the altar and
[1:01:32] had poured the water upon it
[1:01:34] he walked out and he said god i have did
[1:01:36] this at your command is that right
[1:01:38] then the fire began to fall after he had
[1:01:41] completed
[1:01:42] everything this is this this
[1:01:45] christian brother amen he was a field
[1:01:47] manager in the campaigns
[1:01:49] he had the wrong idea of what it was to
[1:01:51] have power in the kingdom of god
[1:01:53] he had the wrong idea of how to use the
[1:01:55] power of god
[1:01:56] and how to use the gift of god and he
[1:01:58] was totally making a blunder of it but
[1:02:00] brother branham had had enough
[1:02:01] experiences that he knew what to do
[1:02:03] amen the same thing jesus christ did he
[1:02:06] only did what the father showed him
[1:02:09] only when god said only when god told
[1:02:11] him he wasn't going presumptuous he
[1:02:13] wasn't going
[1:02:14] amen out of anger he wasn't going out of
[1:02:16] frustration
[1:02:18] he was going obedient to the word of god
[1:02:21] see jesus he was tempted in the
[1:02:24] wilderness but he only used the word
[1:02:26] none of his power
[1:02:28] he had zero showmanship he wasn't he
[1:02:31] wasn't
[1:02:31] he wasn't elevating himself amen he was
[1:02:34] there to fulfill the purpose and will of
[1:02:36] god
[1:02:38] he was in total submission to the father
[1:02:43] i believe he laid a pattern for you and
[1:02:46] i
[1:02:48] i was thinking when i was looking at
[1:02:50] this i was thinking about brother
[1:02:51] branham's life
[1:02:53] brother brandon life early on in his
[1:02:56] campaign in his ministry
[1:02:58] he had one of his managers one of his
[1:03:00] good friends
[1:03:01] one of his campaign managers come and
[1:03:03] steal his magazine and steal his tent
[1:03:05] from him
[1:03:07] and he had a gift and with that gift
[1:03:10] he knew what the man was doing
[1:03:15] see he didn't misuse his gift
[1:03:18] he didn't misplace the gift or the word
[1:03:20] he kept it in submission to god
[1:03:22] he knew when that man was coming he knew
[1:03:24] that man was coming
[1:03:26] to steal his magazine and steal his tent
[1:03:28] and it was and then brother come and he
[1:03:29] said i got some papers for you to sign
[1:03:31] will you sign them and brother brahma
[1:03:32] showed up and he began to he began to
[1:03:34] sign the papers and he just signed them
[1:03:38] just as nice as you please knowing
[1:03:40] exactly what was happening
[1:03:41] but if god didn't tell him to say
[1:03:43] nothing he's not saying nothing
[1:03:46] if god wanted him to lose his tent he
[1:03:48] was willing to lose his tent
[1:03:50] if god wanted to lose his magazine he
[1:03:52] was willing to lose his magazine
[1:03:55] oh friends can we get to the same place
[1:03:57] that if we prayed and committed to god
[1:03:59] and god wants us to lose our job then we
[1:04:01] want to lose the job
[1:04:02] if god wants us to lose some prestige he
[1:04:04] wants us to lose friends then that's if
[1:04:06] that's the will of god
[1:04:08] if that's what god wants i'm part of the
[1:04:10] kingdom i'm on the foundation there's
[1:04:12] something
[1:04:13] i'm solid i'm in the unshakable unmoving
[1:04:16] kingdom of god but god is the head of
[1:04:19] this kingdom amen and his word is going
[1:04:21] to come to pass
[1:04:22] and he's going to display his word
[1:04:24] through whatever means he wants
[1:04:25] and if he's got to take me around the
[1:04:27] cow shed several times
[1:04:28] so that he can show his word off then
[1:04:30] that's what i want
[1:04:33] i don't want to come up with my own mind
[1:04:34] what i need to do is i need to stomp
[1:04:36] down there and i need to do this and i
[1:04:38] need to do that
[1:04:39] what you need to do is just say i
[1:04:41] believe you god
[1:04:43] i believe your word i believe you're my
[1:04:44] deliverer i believe you're my healer
[1:04:46] i believe i was healed amen from before
[1:04:48] the foundation of the world when the
[1:04:49] lamb was slain
[1:04:50] amen i believe that when he was nailed
[1:04:52] to that cross he was paying the price
[1:04:54] for my healing and i accept it now in
[1:04:56] jesus name
[1:04:57] and if you want it to come instantly if
[1:04:59] you want it to come later
[1:05:01] whatever you want amen i'm satisfied
[1:05:03] with your leadership in my life
[1:05:07] if you want me to live in a nation that
[1:05:09] crumbles
[1:05:11] that's where i want to be if you want me
[1:05:14] to live in an america
[1:05:15] that begins a religious persecution
[1:05:19] then this is where i want to be
[1:05:23] jesus didn't fight back you realize
[1:05:27] he had all power when they come when
[1:05:30] they come
[1:05:31] to throw him off a cliff
[1:05:34] all he did was mask himself in some way
[1:05:38] from their eyes where he passed through
[1:05:39] the crowd
[1:05:41] he didn't fight them back he didn't stop
[1:05:43] them
[1:05:44] when he was arrested he went willingly
[1:05:46] because he had already wrestled it out
[1:05:48] in gethsemane he had already submitted
[1:05:50] himself to the will of god amen when
[1:05:52] they come to arrest him
[1:05:53] he wasn't fighting he wasn't screaming
[1:05:54] threats he wasn't angry
[1:05:56] in his trial he wasn't angry he wasn't
[1:05:58] upset
[1:06:00] even pilate was amazed at no answer and
[1:06:03] he says why won't you answer me don't
[1:06:04] you know i have power
[1:06:05] to give you life and my power to take
[1:06:07] your life and he says you have no power
[1:06:10] unless it's given to you from above oh
[1:06:13] maybe god's training us for that kind of
[1:06:15] response
[1:06:16] maybe we're in training right now
[1:06:18] through the highs and the lows the goods
[1:06:19] and the bad
[1:06:20] amen the supernatural display and the
[1:06:22] subtle moving of god
[1:06:23] all of these things that are happening
[1:06:25] in life maybe it's training till we get
[1:06:27] to the place where i said
[1:06:28] i'm in the hand of god
[1:06:31] i remember i was listening to a brother
[1:06:33] from ireland a missionary from brother
[1:06:34] uh from ireland he was giving a
[1:06:36] testimony and he got had gotten arrested
[1:06:38] um somewhere in asia i don't remember
[1:06:40] exactly where it was
[1:06:42] and brother ron garvin was with me we
[1:06:43] were listening to this
[1:06:45] and he was preaching he was saying they
[1:06:47] they they
[1:06:48] arrested him they were questioning him
[1:06:49] and they made a statement along the
[1:06:51] lines and saying
[1:06:52] you know your head is in the mouth of
[1:06:53] the lion they were threatening him and
[1:06:55] scare him your head is in the mouth of
[1:06:57] the lion
[1:06:58] and he says and if you're able to close
[1:07:00] your mouth you better.
[1:07:05] because he realized he was in the hand
[1:07:06] of god
[1:07:08] he was in the hand of god amen this
[1:07:12] bride she's not forgotten
[1:07:16] he hasn't forgotten us amen
[1:07:20] he hasn't he hasn't mislocated you and
[1:07:23] he hasn't lost your gps signal
[1:07:27] he's not punishing he's not
[1:07:31] we are being tested friends and the only
[1:07:34] way that we know we're overcoming
[1:07:36] is when we stick with his word let's go
[1:07:39] to revelation chapter 5.
[1:07:47] i envisioned so many times in my own
[1:07:50] daydreamings and my own surmising
[1:07:52] i envision the way i want to preach
[1:07:59] i mean if you could ever jump in my mind
[1:08:02] and see the imagination you'd be shocked
[1:08:08] and what i would like to do if i had my
[1:08:10] own way is just show the power of god on
[1:08:12] display
[1:08:13] and i'd love to just preach it i mean
[1:08:15] with so much authority and so much
[1:08:16] revelation
[1:08:17] and just so much power and see amen and
[1:08:20] just
[1:08:20] point out you here you're delivered this
[1:08:22] and that and that
[1:08:24] that's my imagination that's what i want
[1:08:27] to see
[1:08:28] to see something tangible
[1:08:32] to see something move
[1:08:36] you know brother i'm on tape there's a
[1:08:37] tape where you can hear the wind of god
[1:08:39] move through the auditorium and roar it
[1:08:42] happens twice
[1:08:44] oh god i want to hear that i don't think
[1:08:46] there's anything wrong with wanting to
[1:08:47] hear that
[1:08:47] don't don't get me wrong but that's
[1:08:50] always our nature we want to hear that
[1:08:52] amen but the real overcoming comes in
[1:08:54] the silent time
[1:08:57] there were there were thousands there in
[1:08:58] that auditorium that day that heard that
[1:09:00] and never moved them a bit to believe
[1:09:01] the word
[1:09:03] then there was those who were there when
[1:09:05] brother brennam was calling out diseases
[1:09:07] and showing
[1:09:08] amen that that are greater than solomon
[1:09:10] is here he was showing that there's a
[1:09:11] man here that can turn on the light by
[1:09:13] the revelation of the word
[1:09:14] he's turning his back to show that the
[1:09:15] same one that was on the plans of mamrie
[1:09:18] with abraham was here in this service
[1:09:19] and he was doing those things
[1:09:21] preaching by revelation that would just
[1:09:23] it was astonishing
[1:09:24] and it didn't move the heart of all the
[1:09:26] people that were sitting there
[1:09:28] they stayed in their unbelief amen
[1:09:34] but god he wants a people that'll stick
[1:09:37] with the word
[1:09:39] whether it's dynamic or subtle
[1:09:42] whether it's noisy or quiet and he wants
[1:09:45] the people that'll be happy with all of
[1:09:46] it
[1:09:48] as long as it's the word we're happy
[1:09:49] with all of it
[1:09:53] so if you could climb into my
[1:09:54] imagination you'd be astonished you're
[1:09:56] like brother
[1:09:57] chad praise god
[1:10:02] but you see that would be me that would
[1:10:05] be my desire
[1:10:06] and that would be destined for failure
[1:10:09] but what we do is we just take god's
[1:10:11] leadership
[1:10:13] it's subtle sometimes sometimes you're
[1:10:15] preparing for service and it's just
[1:10:17] one thought and subtle and it's not
[1:10:20] dynamic and you look at it and you begin
[1:10:21] to work in the word and you begin to
[1:10:23] look at what brother branham said and
[1:10:25] you begin to meditate and brother bam
[1:10:26] starts to
[1:10:27] all right brother man starts to disclose
[1:10:29] what the scripture means and
[1:10:30] and god begins to open it up into your
[1:10:32] understanding and you'll be like but
[1:10:34] that's so simple i can't take that to
[1:10:36] the people
[1:10:38] where does that thinking come from
[1:10:39] friends
[1:10:42] if that's god's inspiration no matter
[1:10:44] how quiet or how subtle it is
[1:10:45] that's the very word that must be
[1:10:47] preached that day
[1:10:49] and if it doesn't have us standing up in
[1:10:51] our seats waving our handkerchiefs and
[1:10:52] shouting
[1:10:53] it doesn't mean that it's not effective
[1:10:55] in changing the lives of the people that
[1:10:57] are hearing you
[1:10:59] we have to be careful that we don't look
[1:11:01] for our own humanistic ideas and our own
[1:11:02] wants and our own desires but we're
[1:11:04] willing to take it the way god brings it
[1:11:06] amen
[1:11:08] and for me that's been a personal
[1:11:09] challenge because sometimes it's so
[1:11:10] subtle sometimes
[1:11:12] it's it's just sometimes it's so
[1:11:14] breathtaking that
[1:11:15] i can't wait to come here and share
[1:11:17] because it's absolutely astonishing it's
[1:11:19] taking my breath away
[1:11:20] sometimes it's like but this little
[1:11:22] thought we've talked about it a thousand
[1:11:24] times
[1:11:26] and i pray god surely god do you want
[1:11:29] and i'll labor in prayer and all of a
[1:11:30] sudden you realize god's saying
[1:11:32] a thousand and one.
[1:11:36] and we as a people got to get to the
[1:11:38] place where we're not questioning his
[1:11:40] every move
[1:11:40] amen we have to be secure and say god is
[1:11:43] god and he's doing with us what he wants
[1:11:45] i'm my foundation is sure because i have
[1:11:47] a sure foundation
[1:11:49] the kingdom of god is within me
[1:11:54] and i'm going to watch and see what god
[1:11:55] wants to do and however he wants to do
[1:11:57] it is the way i want it done
[1:12:00] let's look at revelation chapter 5 verse
[1:12:06] 1.
[1:12:08] i saw on the right hand of him that sat
[1:12:09] on the throne a book written within
[1:12:11] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:12:13] seals and i saw a strong angel proclaim
[1:12:16] with a loud voice who was worthy to open
[1:12:18] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:12:20] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[1:12:23] neither
[1:12:23] under the earth was able to open the
[1:12:25] book neither to look their own
[1:12:27] and i wept much because no man was found
[1:12:30] worthy to open
[1:12:31] to read the book neither to look there
[1:12:33] on
[1:12:34] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[1:12:36] not behold
[1:12:38] the lion of the tribe of judah the root
[1:12:40] of david hath prevailed to open the book
[1:12:42] and to loose the seven seals thereof
[1:12:46] i want to look at this verse whenever i
[1:12:48] get into revelation chapter 5 i just
[1:12:50] want to preach and preach and preach and
[1:12:51] preach
[1:12:52] but there's one thought that i want to
[1:12:54] bring to you
[1:12:56] john's weeping because he knows that all
[1:12:57] redemption is lost if there's no man
[1:12:59] that can take this book
[1:13:02] one of the elders say unto him weep not
[1:13:04] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:13:06] the root of david
[1:13:07] hath prevailed this lion this root of
[1:13:11] david this great king
[1:13:12] he has prevailed to open the book and to
[1:13:15] loose the seven seals thereof
[1:13:18] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[1:13:20] throne and of the four beasts
[1:13:22] and in the midst of the elders stood a
[1:13:24] lamb
[1:13:25] as it had been slain having seven horns
[1:13:28] and seven eyes which are the seven
[1:13:30] spirits of god set forth into all the
[1:13:31] earth
[1:13:32] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:13:34] right hand of him
[1:13:36] that sat upon the throne
[1:13:39] this picture to me is so perfect because
[1:13:42] john knows that redemption is lost and
[1:13:44] he's weeping but the elder says don't
[1:13:47] worry
[1:13:48] the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:13:51] the root and offspring of david the
[1:13:54] great one the prophesied one the mighty
[1:13:56] one the king
[1:13:57] that'll be king of all creation amen he
[1:14:00] has prevailed when he started using
[1:14:02] terms like
[1:14:03] lion amen and and and rooting offspring
[1:14:06] of david and prevailed
[1:14:08] john turned to see this lion and what
[1:14:10] did he see
[1:14:11] a tore up beaten bloody lamb
[1:14:17] you have to ask yourself what is
[1:14:19] prevailing
[1:14:23] what is overcoming
[1:14:27] how did jesus win
[1:14:30] the greatest victory that was won on
[1:14:33] earth for our redemption
[1:14:36] he didn't do it as a lion he did it as a
[1:14:38] lamb
[1:14:41] and humble submission to the will of god
[1:14:44] if he had to suffer for redemption he
[1:14:47] would suffer for redemption
[1:14:49] and john turns to see this great king he
[1:14:52] turns to see this mighty victor
[1:14:54] he turns to see the one who has
[1:14:56] prevailed and he sees a bleeding
[1:14:59] bloody lamb
[1:15:07] sometimes i want to see the mighty bride
[1:15:13] who can't be defeated i want to see the
[1:15:15] invincible army
[1:15:17] i want to see the manifestation of the
[1:15:19] spoken word i want to see
[1:15:22] i want to see amen this queen of heaven
[1:15:26] i want to see this this queen united
[1:15:28] with her king
[1:15:30] the one who's coming to authority and
[1:15:32] power in the i want to see this one
[1:15:36] i wonder i wonder
[1:15:40] what it would look like
[1:15:43] to have prevailed to be
[1:15:46] in this age a bride who prevails over
[1:15:49] the lust of the eyes
[1:15:50] the lust of the flesh and the pride of
[1:15:53] life
[1:15:54] how will we prevail
[1:15:58] i think if christ prevailed as a lamb
[1:16:01] maybe we'll prevail as a lamb maybe
[1:16:04] it may not be the bold and the dynamic
[1:16:08] it might be the humble daily submission
[1:16:10] to the word of god
[1:16:12] taking whatever comes and believing god
[1:16:15] anyways
[1:16:16] every upset an obstacle and trial taking
[1:16:19] it
[1:16:19] and believing anyhow and to where god
[1:16:23] amen he can look back and say devil
[1:16:26] you've thrown
[1:16:27] everything you can throw at her you've
[1:16:29] thrown cancer
[1:16:30] and family troubles divorce issues amen
[1:16:33] there's been all kinds of abuses there's
[1:16:35] been
[1:16:36] everything that you can possibly throw
[1:16:38] at her amen
[1:16:39] and look just as humble and just as
[1:16:41] humble as i was when i was in flesh she
[1:16:43] stands there
[1:16:44] and she says but the word says but i'm
[1:16:47] his but he's redeemed me but the kingdom
[1:16:49] of heaven is within me but i
[1:16:51] am part of the bride i believe
[1:16:52] regardless of what you throw at her
[1:16:54] devil she believes anyways
[1:16:57] because the only way you can really
[1:16:58] overcome is to stay with the word
[1:17:04] isaiah 53 says of jesus
[1:17:08] he was opposed and he was afflicted he
[1:17:11] was oppressed and he was afflicted
[1:17:12] yet he opened on his mouth he's brought
[1:17:14] us a lamb to the slaughter
[1:17:16] and as a sheep before her shares is dumb
[1:17:19] so he opened not his mouth what was he
[1:17:22] doing
[1:17:24] he was gaining the victory he was
[1:17:28] prevailing
[1:17:30] the message proving his word 1964
[1:17:34] brother braham says now we find that god
[1:17:38] come into this little cell
[1:17:40] and he began to develop cells drew from
[1:17:42] his mother's vitamins and things that
[1:17:43] she
[1:17:44] said didn't even become old enough to
[1:17:47] eat himself he began to eat
[1:17:49] what was it it's the dust of the earth
[1:17:51] which you come up and plant life and
[1:17:52] animal life and so forth
[1:17:54] and as you begin to eat the fish and the
[1:17:56] bread and so forth it began to develop
[1:17:58] cells and then when it's fully matured
[1:18:00] at 30 years old he was baptized in
[1:18:02] obedience to john down there
[1:18:04] or to god and the water went out and
[1:18:06] what happened the dove
[1:18:08] which was god descended from heaven and
[1:18:10] a voice saying this is my beloved
[1:18:12] son in whom i am pleased to dwell what
[1:18:14] did he come to do
[1:18:16] to redeem that part of the earth he was
[1:18:18] the beginning
[1:18:19] of the creation of god because god is
[1:18:22] not a creation only in christ he is a
[1:18:24] creation
[1:18:25] because god is an eternal and a spirit
[1:18:27] and a spirit is not created
[1:18:28] he was the beginning of the creation of
[1:18:30] god and god redeemed that body see
[1:18:32] when he come down this is my beloved son
[1:18:35] i'm well pleased
[1:18:37] in him so he god come down after
[1:18:40] after going through this and now every
[1:18:42] son that you eat and born of natural sex
[1:18:44] birth
[1:18:45] the way you come then when it comes to a
[1:18:47] place to where you go through water
[1:18:49] baptism
[1:18:50] then the holy ghost baptism then the
[1:18:52] holy ghost comes down
[1:18:54] at the fire baptism and claims this
[1:18:55] creation the same as it did him
[1:18:58] now brother graham's taking what
[1:19:00] happened in jordan
[1:19:01] and then when the dove come down in the
[1:19:03] form of the holy ghost and
[1:19:04] said upon him he said i'm claiming
[1:19:06] redeeming claiming this part of the
[1:19:07] earth to redeem the rest
[1:19:09] now when that holy ghost comes down upon
[1:19:11] you it's doing the same thing
[1:19:13] it's claiming you and then the holy
[1:19:16] ghost comes down at the fire baptism and
[1:19:18] claims his creation the same as it did
[1:19:20] him the holy ghost and god is the same
[1:19:23] spirit see
[1:19:24] and it comes down and claims this body
[1:19:26] for the resurrection
[1:19:28] and he was raised for our justification
[1:19:29] all the father has given me will come
[1:19:31] not one will be lost i'll raise it up at
[1:19:33] the last day not one hair of the head
[1:19:35] will even perish
[1:19:37] that is the beginning of the creation of
[1:19:39] god he's pointing back
[1:19:40] to the jordan that is the beginning of
[1:19:44] the creation of god
[1:19:46] this is the continuation
[1:19:49] of the creation of god what's happening
[1:19:52] with the holy ghost baptism when when
[1:19:55] god uniting with you
[1:19:56] amen it's a continuation of the creation
[1:19:59] of god
[1:20:01] it's the kingdom of god within you
[1:20:06] so then this is the continuation of the
[1:20:07] creation god then the whole earth
[1:20:09] has to have a baptism then next the
[1:20:11] whole earth has a baptism
[1:20:13] so we know the holy ghost came back in
[1:20:15] full measure on the church at the
[1:20:16] opening of the seals
[1:20:17] under the end time messenger's prophet
[1:20:19] prophecy under his missed ministry
[1:20:22] and he come down to claim a bride what
[1:20:24] it is the continuation of the creation
[1:20:26] of god
[1:20:28] and whatever nature that that kingdom
[1:20:30] had when it was on earth then that
[1:20:31] kingdom has to have the same nature now
[1:20:35] brother branham come as a wave chief of
[1:20:37] that and if you look at brother
[1:20:38] branham's life we
[1:20:39] we talked about his tent was stolen and
[1:20:41] his magazine was stolen
[1:20:43] and he let it go he didn't fight for it
[1:20:46] because god told him didn't tell him to
[1:20:49] he was used by at the end of his
[1:20:51] ministry he was used by the
[1:20:52] the christian businessman just to gather
[1:20:55] a crowd
[1:20:56] brother brahm said sometimes you know
[1:20:57] they'll put your name on the bulletin
[1:20:58] just to get your friends
[1:21:00] to come they were just using his name to
[1:21:02] gather a crowd and then they would
[1:21:04] switch it and say well we've only got
[1:21:05] one night for you only one meeting
[1:21:08] they were using him amen but what did he
[1:21:11] do
[1:21:12] he still went with the christian
[1:21:13] businessman
[1:21:15] he didn't fight he didn't use his gifts
[1:21:18] and his powers
[1:21:19] amen to to straighten them up and
[1:21:21] correct them and make them change their
[1:21:23] ways
[1:21:24] if that's what god wanted that's what he
[1:21:26] wanted
[1:21:30] in one meeting they they lied about him
[1:21:32] and his sick brother
[1:21:33] they had a meeting just to gather the
[1:21:34] people and brother branham they wanted
[1:21:36] him to change
[1:21:37] his teaching his doctrine and he
[1:21:39] wouldn't change it amen and they come to
[1:21:40] the poop
[1:21:41] and say uh reverend william branham
[1:21:43] can't speak tonight because his
[1:21:44] brother's sick
[1:21:47] and he was standing there by the door
[1:21:49] waiting to go in
[1:21:51] waiting to go in and what did he do he
[1:21:54] turned and walked away
[1:21:58] because he was a lamb led to the
[1:22:00] slaughter
[1:22:02] he had no form no beauty that we should
[1:22:04] behold him
[1:22:05] he was oppressed and he opened not his
[1:22:07] mouth he was afflicted
[1:22:09] and we esteemed him not brother man
[1:22:12] he you think about it he was the word
[1:22:15] made flesh the prophecy of malachi 4
[1:22:18] of revelation 10 7 of luke 17 30
[1:22:21] standing there in the flesh the very
[1:22:23] word of god materialized into a flesh
[1:22:25] being
[1:22:26] right the very son of man was working
[1:22:29] through this son of man
[1:22:31] and yet he could suffer and be humble be
[1:22:34] persecuted amen be ridiculed be made fun
[1:22:37] of be rejected have his tent stole from
[1:22:39] him amen be light about to gather crowds
[1:22:41] and what would he say and do about it
[1:22:43] nothing he used none of his powers for
[1:22:46] himself
[1:22:47] none of his gift for himself he was a
[1:22:49] lamb led to the slaughter
[1:22:53] remember when the the ir the irs case
[1:22:57] the tax case
[1:22:58] opened back up remember they thought
[1:23:01] they had it settled and
[1:23:02] he he got a check and he put in the bank
[1:23:04] and they opened up the tax
[1:23:06] case and he was talking to a brother
[1:23:10] brother lee vale
[1:23:11] brother level says why do you put up
[1:23:12] with that and this and that
[1:23:14] and all of that and he told him just
[1:23:17] he said brother i think you're just a
[1:23:18] little too quick on the trigger
[1:23:21] and then he was he was going back home
[1:23:24] and he went back home and
[1:23:25] he got into the house and his wife was
[1:23:27] upset and somebody said something all
[1:23:29] that tax collector
[1:23:31] and brother benham said leave him alone
[1:23:35] maybe god told him to do that
[1:23:38] leave him alone maybe
[1:23:43] it wasn't none of this don't you know
[1:23:44] who i am i'm the servant of god
[1:23:46] i'm the prophet for the age
[1:23:50] he never exhibited that kind of attitude
[1:23:52] friends
[1:23:53] and neither did jesus christ you know
[1:23:55] jesus never said
[1:23:56] any bad thing about the roman government
[1:24:00] i don't remember reading anything that
[1:24:03] jesus said that was
[1:24:04] negative about the roman government
[1:24:08] oh man let that be a correction for us
[1:24:12] friends
[1:24:15] jesus wasn't worried about the roman
[1:24:16] government the roman government was
[1:24:18] there to accomplish god's purpose
[1:24:20] it had to be there they were there to
[1:24:22] crucify him because it's going to be
[1:24:24] rome that crucifies the word all through
[1:24:26] the church ages
[1:24:27] it all is in place it all has to be
[1:24:29] there man
[1:24:30] jesus is not amen saying horrible things
[1:24:33] about rome about the oppression
[1:24:34] amen he's not he's not blasting it
[1:24:37] because it has to be there to accomplish
[1:24:39] god's purpose
[1:24:40] and then he's satisfied with it being
[1:24:42] there
[1:24:45] i tell you what a rotten corrupt
[1:24:48] political system
[1:24:49] in government in america is not anything
[1:24:51] to fuss about it's perfect
[1:24:56] it's perfect friends it's what god needs
[1:24:58] at this time to accomplish his word
[1:25:02] if we get too much on the flesh side
[1:25:03] because his flesh
[1:25:05] and the flesh were citizens of america
[1:25:07] so when we start
[1:25:08] boiling over about politics and we start
[1:25:12] getting upset about the unrighteousness
[1:25:14] and the
[1:25:15] and the corruption and and and all of
[1:25:17] this stuff uh
[1:25:18] it's a clear indicator we've moved over
[1:25:20] to the flesh
[1:25:24] and i don't say they criticize you amen
[1:25:26] that's me too
[1:25:29] and so just as soon as we start i mean
[1:25:32] the blood pressure goes up and how can
[1:25:33] and unbelievable
[1:25:35] and these things and all of a sudden
[1:25:37] we're in the flesh
[1:25:40] because in the spirit in the soul we're
[1:25:42] citizens
[1:25:43] of heaven and in my citizenship in
[1:25:47] heaven
[1:25:48] there is no compromise there is no
[1:25:51] there's no corruption
[1:25:52] there's no false leadership i mean
[1:25:55] there's no lying there's no cheating no
[1:25:56] stealing
[1:25:57] everything is fine i am completely
[1:26:00] satisfied with the kingdom of god with
[1:26:02] the kingdom of heaven and my citizenship
[1:26:03] there
[1:26:05] and in the flesh god's placed me here
[1:26:09] for this time for a reason god has
[1:26:10] positionally put me here
[1:26:12] and if god wants me to be here subject
[1:26:15] to an unrighteous government that is
[1:26:17] corrupt and will bring a religious
[1:26:18] persecution
[1:26:19] then there's no other place on this
[1:26:21] planet that i want to be
[1:26:25] that's a mouthful but that's where jesus
[1:26:28] was
[1:26:30] he was right in the grip of rome
[1:26:36] rome was compromising
[1:26:39] with the jewish religion to hold a
[1:26:42] precarious position of power
[1:26:44] and there was a there was a religious
[1:26:46] forces and political forces that were
[1:26:48] working together pilate was stuck in
[1:26:50] this conundrum where
[1:26:52] he's trying to to to have rule and power
[1:26:54] without an insurrection but he's got
[1:26:56] all these pharisees and all those in the
[1:26:58] temple causing so much trouble
[1:27:00] and there's all kinds of political
[1:27:02] maneuvering hypocrisy corruption
[1:27:05] i mean israel was full of it in that day
[1:27:10] full of corruption i mean the high
[1:27:12] priest when when
[1:27:13] when jesus resurrects the the guards
[1:27:16] that come back to the high priest
[1:27:18] and tell them that the body's gone we
[1:27:20] saw an angel rolled the stone away and
[1:27:22] the body was gone
[1:27:23] they gave them money this is the
[1:27:25] priesthood gave them money
[1:27:27] talk about corruption you can't get any
[1:27:29] more corrupt than that
[1:27:31] gave the soldiers money to lie
[1:27:34] about the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:27:37] you can't find more corruption than you
[1:27:40] found in jerusalem in the day jesus was
[1:27:42] there
[1:27:42] but jesus wasn't worried about it
[1:27:44] because it was all on time
[1:27:47] it was the way it had to be the
[1:27:49] corruption amen in the religious system
[1:27:51] the corruption in politics the roman
[1:27:53] rule
[1:27:54] it was all perfectly set in place amen
[1:27:57] for the son of god to step on the scene
[1:27:59] and do what he had to do in obedience to
[1:28:01] his father and
[1:28:02] take all kinds of abuse and name calling
[1:28:04] being misunderstood
[1:28:06] called wrong names and he didn't do
[1:28:08] anything to fix any of that
[1:28:11] he just kept doing what god told him to
[1:28:13] do
[1:28:14] humbly what was that
[1:28:18] that was the beginning of the creation
[1:28:19] of god
[1:28:21] what is this this is the continuation
[1:28:24] of the creation of god
[1:28:27] god has a certain nature to him
[1:28:35] brother branham says in things that are
[1:28:37] to be there's a few quotes i want to
[1:28:38] read in a row just to highlight
[1:28:40] this continuation of the creation of god
[1:28:43] and then we'll wrap up
[1:28:45] now if we are those attributes of god we
[1:28:48] cannot live by creeds we cannot live by
[1:28:50] denominationalism
[1:28:51] we must live by the word because
[1:28:54] the bride is part of the bridegroom like
[1:28:56] any wife is part of her husband
[1:28:59] therefore we must be that word bride and
[1:29:01] what is the word bride
[1:29:02] the manifestation of this hour
[1:29:06] that was the beginning of the creation
[1:29:09] jesus christ was the manifestation of
[1:29:10] that hour but now there's a
[1:29:11] manifestation in this hour and it's
[1:29:13] jesus christ in bright form
[1:29:16] and you and i the kingdom of god is
[1:29:18] within you
[1:29:20] and it's got to have the same nature
[1:29:23] it's got to operate the same way
[1:29:26] as it did in that day the manifestation
[1:29:29] of this hour the bride not a creed or a
[1:29:31] denomination but a living oracle of god
[1:29:34] a living attribute of god displaying to
[1:29:36] the world the attributes of god in the
[1:29:38] formation of the bride
[1:29:40] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:29:42] we're now living
[1:29:45] we're here to show the attributes of god
[1:29:49] in invisible union he says and you
[1:29:51] remember when i went down and the grain
[1:29:53] began to ripen that you find before that
[1:29:54] grain can ripen
[1:29:56] everything in that stalk has to be dead
[1:29:57] hallelujah can't you see where we're
[1:29:59] standing
[1:30:00] life is in the grain again what is it
[1:30:02] just exactly like the same grain that
[1:30:04] went in the ground
[1:30:05] the same jesus in bright form
[1:30:09] same power same church
[1:30:12] same thing same word
[1:30:15] the same word sucked up through these
[1:30:17] and come out here
[1:30:18] and come to a head here and all that
[1:30:21] life that come through here
[1:30:22] picked it picked up its people now it's
[1:30:25] forming up into a head
[1:30:26] for the rapture the same
[1:30:29] jesus in bride form what was he
[1:30:33] a lamb led to the slaughter
[1:30:36] he was oppressed and afflicted in the
[1:30:37] open not his mouth
[1:30:39] he was subject to the powers that were
[1:30:41] around him to the authorities that were
[1:30:42] around him
[1:30:44] why because that's what the father
[1:30:46] wanted
[1:30:48] christ is the mystery guard revealed and
[1:30:49] when the word moves on down into the
[1:30:51] body from the head
[1:30:52] what is it the same word nothing could
[1:30:54] be added or taken from it
[1:30:55] so that same word moves from the head as
[1:30:58] the day comes close down into the body
[1:31:00] down into the body vindicating that they
[1:31:02] are one they are husband
[1:31:04] and wife they are flesh of his flesh
[1:31:07] word of his word
[1:31:08] life of his life spirit of his spirit
[1:31:10] see amen how do you know it
[1:31:12] bears the same record same fruit same
[1:31:14] word
[1:31:15] manifest christ same life same god
[1:31:18] same spirit same word same book amen
[1:31:22] same signs these things that i do shall
[1:31:24] you do also
[1:31:25] oh hallelujah
[1:31:29] god is good god is good
[1:31:33] he says in god's provided place of
[1:31:35] worship the church will come through
[1:31:36] justification through luther
[1:31:38] through sanctification through wesley
[1:31:40] through baptism of holy ghost or the
[1:31:42] pentecostals and go right on into the
[1:31:44] perfection of the son of man
[1:31:47] that when the husband and wife shall be
[1:31:49] the same
[1:31:50] self person remember when brother
[1:31:53] branham was here he was the wave chief
[1:31:55] of what's coming
[1:31:56] and in the wave sheath amen he was a son
[1:31:59] of man revealing
[1:32:00] the son of man and there was a son of
[1:32:02] man ministry on earth and that man
[1:32:04] and that son of man ministry was subject
[1:32:07] to tax laws
[1:32:10] how did he get in trouble tax laws by
[1:32:12] going out and preaching the gospel
[1:32:15] he was preaching amen and during
[1:32:17] preaching they were giving money
[1:32:18] and he didn't know how to handle the
[1:32:20] money and he was just signing it all to
[1:32:22] himself and paying all the bills and
[1:32:24] they were giving him credit for
[1:32:25] receiving all these offerings and now he
[1:32:27] was delinquent on taxes
[1:32:28] amen amen brother venom couldn't do
[1:32:30] anything about it he didn't call fire
[1:32:32] down from heaven
[1:32:33] he just subjected himself to it and when
[1:32:35] it looked like they were wrapping things
[1:32:36] up and they opened the case again
[1:32:38] and they got upset with them somebody
[1:32:40] from his family or somebody was with him
[1:32:41] got upset
[1:32:42] with the tax collector he said leave him
[1:32:44] alone maybe god told him to do that
[1:32:48] and god was so pleased there was a
[1:32:51] question between him and his wife
[1:32:52] whether they should go back to arizona
[1:32:54] or come back to jeffersonville and god
[1:32:56] was so pleased with his answer
[1:32:58] that he actually flashed words on the
[1:33:00] wall says come on back to arizona
[1:33:03] and a supernatural display of the hand
[1:33:06] of god
[1:33:06] putting writing on a wall he said come
[1:33:08] on back answering the question so
[1:33:10] perfectly
[1:33:11] what moved god it was the humility of
[1:33:13] this servant who had said leave him
[1:33:15] alone maybe god told him to do that
[1:33:19] we want to see supernatural in our lives
[1:33:22] i let's
[1:33:22] i say let the supernatural come through
[1:33:24] extreme humility
[1:33:27] let god do for us what we can't do for
[1:33:29] ourselves
[1:33:31] and not work it up and pull it down and
[1:33:33] pump it up but through simple humility
[1:33:35] and submission
[1:33:36] walk with god and let god work the
[1:33:38] supernatural he's doing it friends all
[1:33:40] the time
[1:33:41] healing upon healing testimony upon
[1:33:43] testimony we could go around the room
[1:33:45] and testify
[1:33:46] all day long about supernatural things
[1:33:48] that are happening in our life but it's
[1:33:49] so
[1:33:50] humble the world doesn't know anything
[1:33:52] about it
[1:33:53] so supernatural but so humble
[1:33:58] because it takes the nature of the lamb
[1:34:03] it goes right on down into the
[1:34:05] perfection of the son of man
[1:34:07] that when husband and wife will be the
[1:34:09] same self person
[1:34:11] god will be so manifested in his church
[1:34:14] his bride his church
[1:34:15] till they will both be the same they are
[1:34:18] one
[1:34:18] now you see where we're at
[1:34:25] but the remember says in stature of a
[1:34:26] perfect man from 1962
[1:34:29] he said so this church has got to come
[1:34:31] to perfection
[1:34:33] in order to bring the resurrection and
[1:34:35] they're under souls under the altar
[1:34:37] waiting for this church to come to its
[1:34:39] perfection
[1:34:40] that when christ does come they're
[1:34:43] waiting
[1:34:45] for the church to come to perfection
[1:34:48] sometimes our vision of that church
[1:34:50] coming to perfection is
[1:34:52] different than what maybe god's idea of
[1:34:54] a church coming to perfection is
[1:35:00] for for us sometimes in a human idea
[1:35:06] we want to see operations and
[1:35:09] manifestations
[1:35:10] which those are part of every church
[1:35:14] the the manifestations of the gift of
[1:35:15] the spirit must be
[1:35:17] part of our lives and must be part of
[1:35:18] the church
[1:35:20] but sometimes we get focused too much on
[1:35:23] that
[1:35:24] and not realize that sometimes the most
[1:35:27] supernatural
[1:35:28] things that happen in our life are
[1:35:29] subtle and nobody sees it nobody knows
[1:35:31] about it
[1:35:32] things that are changing within us amen
[1:35:34] attitude our
[1:35:36] our whole being our whole mind our whole
[1:35:39] response is
[1:35:40] lining up with the lamb over and over
[1:35:42] and over again and you're coming into
[1:35:43] that reflection of jesus christ in bride
[1:35:45] form
[1:35:46] and it's happening so so uh subtly by
[1:35:49] degrees amen
[1:35:51] it's happening but it's happening so
[1:35:52] sure friends
[1:35:54] but so subtly by degrees and not big
[1:35:57] flashes and not big things but
[1:35:58] decision by decision day by day all of a
[1:36:01] sudden your life is lining up with the
[1:36:02] life of jesus christ and it's jesus
[1:36:04] christ in you
[1:36:05] more and more and more and it's one of
[1:36:06] the most supernatural things that can
[1:36:08] happen on this earth
[1:36:11] but it doesn't always get the fanfare it
[1:36:13] doesn't always get
[1:36:15] celebrated like it ought to
[1:36:18] when we make the right choice and suffer
[1:36:21] when we could bypass suffering we make
[1:36:24] the right
[1:36:24] choice and not speak back amen when we
[1:36:27] had every right
[1:36:28] to correct the wrong but god didn't tell
[1:36:31] us to
[1:36:32] so we feel checked and we just be quiet
[1:36:35] these are
[1:36:35] great victories friends because she's
[1:36:38] got to have the same life
[1:36:40] and the same spirit as jesus christ it's
[1:36:42] jesus christ
[1:36:49] brother branham says in the smyrna
[1:36:52] church age out of the church age book
[1:36:55] why does he stand by the reason is in in
[1:36:58] romans 8 17 to 18
[1:37:00] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[1:37:01] and joint heirs with christ if so be
[1:37:03] that we suffer with them
[1:37:04] that we may also be be also glorified
[1:37:07] together
[1:37:08] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:37:09] present time are not worthy to be
[1:37:10] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:37:12] revealed
[1:37:13] in us unless we suffer with him we
[1:37:16] cannot reign with him
[1:37:18] you have to suffer to reign the reason
[1:37:20] for this is that character simply is
[1:37:21] never made without suffering
[1:37:24] character is a victory not
[1:37:27] a gift amen i
[1:37:30] i wonder i wonder what god's wanting out
[1:37:33] of us
[1:37:34] and i wonder if it's not his own
[1:37:36] character
[1:37:38] on display the very nature the very life
[1:37:41] life of his life word of his word spirit
[1:37:44] of his spirit
[1:37:46] when we say that and we'll do exactly
[1:37:48] what he did the works that i do show you
[1:37:50] do also and we believe in all of those
[1:37:51] but we get we get so lopsided that we
[1:37:53] only think of the supernatural in
[1:37:55] miracles
[1:37:56] we don't we don't see the humility the
[1:37:58] submission the suffering
[1:38:01] that's also his works that's also what
[1:38:04] he did in obedience to the father
[1:38:07] those things are just as important
[1:38:11] character is a victory not a gift
[1:38:14] a man without character can't reign
[1:38:18] because power apart from character is
[1:38:20] satanic
[1:38:22] but power with character is fit to rule
[1:38:26] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:38:28] throne on the same bases that he
[1:38:29] overcome and sat down on his father's
[1:38:31] throne
[1:38:32] then we have to overcome to sit with him
[1:38:35] and the little temporary suffering we go
[1:38:37] through now is not worthy to be compared
[1:38:39] to the tremendous glory that will be
[1:38:41] revealed in us when he comes oh
[1:38:44] what treasures are laid up for those who
[1:38:46] are willing to enter into his kingdom
[1:38:48] through much
[1:38:48] tribulation
[1:38:52] hallelujah i can identify with that
[1:38:59] you know when jesus christ come there
[1:39:00] was a forerunner here telling him this
[1:39:02] great messiah is coming
[1:39:04] calls him out identifies him this is the
[1:39:06] one
[1:39:07] and then jesus goes about into his
[1:39:09] ministry amen and there's many wonderful
[1:39:11] things
[1:39:12] that are done in the ministry of jesus
[1:39:13] christ healings by the droves
[1:39:15] and all kinds of stuff but you realize
[1:39:17] even with all that happened
[1:39:19] it somehow did not match john's
[1:39:22] expectation of what was coming
[1:39:25] until john looked at the humility of
[1:39:27] jesus christ
[1:39:28] amen the total humility of him with all
[1:39:30] the supernatural things and the healings
[1:39:32] and all of that
[1:39:33] he looked at the humility and he had an
[1:39:36] expectation
[1:39:37] even of his own prophecy
[1:39:41] and he asked a question he sends the
[1:39:42] side and says are you the one or do we
[1:39:44] look for another
[1:39:47] what was confusing him amen his own
[1:39:49] expectation of what he should see
[1:39:51] and he wasn't he he was looking at the
[1:39:53] humility
[1:39:54] and christ wasn't becoming a king and he
[1:39:56] wasn't taking over and he wasn't driving
[1:39:58] out the romans and he
[1:40:01] he was just doing what his father told
[1:40:02] him to do and he says
[1:40:05] he'll thoroughly purge his threshing
[1:40:06] floor his fan is in his hand
[1:40:08] and you'll thoroughly purge his
[1:40:09] threshing floor and when he begins to
[1:40:11] talk like that
[1:40:12] you begin to see he's going to drive out
[1:40:14] brother man says he's going to drive out
[1:40:15] all the romans
[1:40:18] clean out the sanhedrin reestablish the
[1:40:21] proper worship and bring the throne of
[1:40:23] david on the scene
[1:40:24] and they didn't realize his fan was in
[1:40:26] his hand he was thoroughly purging his
[1:40:28] threshing floor
[1:40:29] because he was demonstrating the word
[1:40:31] amen and the seed was staying and the
[1:40:32] chaff was going away
[1:40:35] he was doing in great power the work
[1:40:37] that god had sent him to do and it was a
[1:40:39] powerful work and he was doing it
[1:40:40] through great power but it was the
[1:40:41] simplicity of the demonstration of the
[1:40:44] word
[1:40:44] and then in the word that he was
[1:40:45] speaking and it was keeping the seat on
[1:40:48] the threshing floor and driving away all
[1:40:49] the chaff
[1:40:53] until he drives away
[1:40:57] and drives away and drives away
[1:41:00] and drives away until he only has a
[1:41:03] little seed left
[1:41:05] and it looks like he's losing his
[1:41:07] ministry
[1:41:08] it looks like it's going downhill
[1:41:11] brother bam would
[1:41:12] he would begin to describe it and
[1:41:13] dramatize and he said
[1:41:15] we don't have the great meetings that we
[1:41:16] have the campaigns are
[1:41:19] we don't track the crowds the campaigns
[1:41:21] are diminishing
[1:41:22] we had the thousands left when they
[1:41:25] didn't understand what you were saying
[1:41:26] he was giving them the revelation of the
[1:41:27] word they didn't catch it and they left
[1:41:31] unless you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:41:32] man and drink his blood hard saying left
[1:41:36] he begs it harder what's he doing he's
[1:41:38] bringing the revelation to the word
[1:41:39] because he knows that the word can't
[1:41:41] leave the word
[1:41:43] the seed can't leave the word even if
[1:41:46] they don't comprehend what he's saying
[1:41:48] the seed can't leave the word and he
[1:41:51] gives it again
[1:41:52] and the 70 leave and the great
[1:41:54] campaign's leaving brother branham is
[1:41:55] describing his own ministry
[1:41:58] and he went out in 46 47 48 49
[1:42:02] 50. great campaigns he couldn't get to
[1:42:04] enough places and they couldn't find
[1:42:06] places with enough seats
[1:42:09] and you look at that and you say that's
[1:42:11] it that's it
[1:42:12] that's the move of god that's the power
[1:42:14] of god on display that's jesus christ
[1:42:16] return to the earth again
[1:42:17] and you don't even realize amen when we
[1:42:19] really get down to the real display of
[1:42:21] jesus christ with a fan in his hand
[1:42:23] it's a man amen in a brick tabernacle
[1:42:25] the corner of eighth and pin street
[1:42:27] and been breaking the seals down to a
[1:42:29] people who will stay and hear it
[1:42:32] amen he was the forerunner for running
[1:42:36] this great coming
[1:42:37] amen christ comes now to take the book
[1:42:39] and open the seals and he's doing it in
[1:42:40] such humility in such simplicity
[1:42:43] that people are like go ahead
[1:42:48] uh okay
[1:42:52] all right we're waiting he said i
[1:42:54] already preached it
[1:42:56] [Laughter]
[1:43:00] amen you can in this day we can we can
[1:43:03] have
[1:43:04] in our own minds we can say where is
[1:43:05] this great manifestation of the bride
[1:43:07] where is this bride
[1:43:08] that is flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:43:10] bone life of his life
[1:43:11] spirit of his spirit all his power is
[1:43:13] now in her they're united together the
[1:43:15] kingdom on earth where is it
[1:43:18] it's right here friends i'll declare
[1:43:20] here's part of it right here
[1:43:21] it may not be flashy it may not do what
[1:43:23] you think it will do
[1:43:24] amen but there's people here that are
[1:43:26] part of the kingdom of god
[1:43:28] the bride of jesus christ that have
[1:43:29] united with the bridegroom
[1:43:31] that are flesh of his flesh life of his
[1:43:33] life bone of his bone
[1:43:34] spirit of his spirit blood of his blood
[1:43:36] brother said
[1:43:38] and they're here with the same life he
[1:43:40] had and what are they doing
[1:43:41] they're just humbly sticking with that
[1:43:43] word and not exchanging that word for
[1:43:46] any human idea
[1:43:47] for any pleasure for any anything of
[1:43:50] this world
[1:43:52] say did i miss the bride you didn't miss
[1:43:54] the bride only if your expectation of
[1:43:56] what he said was wrong
[1:44:01] how do you know you're overcoming the
[1:44:03] only way to overcome
[1:44:05] is to stick with the word because the
[1:44:07] word's the only thing that can't fail
[1:44:11] is it is this the bride
[1:44:14] or do i look for another
[1:44:18] you see things don't change friends
[1:44:20] these patterns roll
[1:44:21] on and on things don't change
[1:44:25] but i expected what did you expect
[1:44:29] well i thought by these statements
[1:44:31] they're all true
[1:44:33] but don't just get your expectation in
[1:44:35] the wrong spot
[1:44:36] watch how he come through jesus christ
[1:44:38] watch how he come through brother ben
[1:44:40] watch just watch how he come through
[1:44:42] every prophet
[1:44:43] and the apostles
[1:44:47] but ministry was drying up finished
[1:44:51] just when it was finished in the eyes
[1:44:54] of all those who saw great campaigns and
[1:44:56] wanted the great campaigns when they saw
[1:44:58] it diminishing
[1:44:58] his friends left him they accepted his
[1:45:02] funny doctrines as long as there was
[1:45:04] tons of miracles and gigantic crowds but
[1:45:06] when it began to diminish and pull back
[1:45:09] amen they weren't so comfortable with
[1:45:11] his doctrines anymore
[1:45:14] when it looked like the power and the
[1:45:16] prestige when it looked like
[1:45:18] the mighty thing that would come and
[1:45:20] drive back the enemy amen when it looked
[1:45:22] like
[1:45:22] it had failed amen it wasn't the word
[1:45:24] that was their attraction it was the
[1:45:26] power that was on display was their
[1:45:27] attraction
[1:45:28] and they didn't realize the root of all
[1:45:30] of that power was the manifested word
[1:45:34] and the root of all power is the word
[1:45:36] friends
[1:45:38] and if we've got the word we've got all
[1:45:40] power
[1:45:42] it's not about oh i want to see this and
[1:45:44] i want to see that stick with the word
[1:45:46] and you'll see
[1:45:46] everything you need to see and you'll
[1:45:49] see supernatural things in abundance if
[1:45:51] you stick with the word
[1:45:52] don't go chasing supernatural things the
[1:45:54] supernatural thing is the revelation of
[1:45:56] the word
[1:45:57] stick with the word and the supernatural
[1:45:59] will follow will come
[1:46:01] amen
[1:46:06] you see there's a scripture in hebrew
[1:46:09] says
[1:46:09] talks about the heroes of faith and says
[1:46:12] they without and
[1:46:13] us are not yet made perfect
[1:46:15] are showing
[1:46:16] that there's a waiting for us there's a
[1:46:18] finishing up they without us are not yet
[1:46:20] made perfect
[1:46:20] but did you ever go read through that
[1:46:22] list
[1:46:24] they were afflicted tormented
[1:46:28] what are we finishing if you go back and
[1:46:31] read the list
[1:46:33] amen they without us are not yet perfect
[1:46:35] we're finishing
[1:46:36] this great chapter of the heroes of the
[1:46:39] faith
[1:46:40] and the chapter of hebrews we're
[1:46:43] finishing that we're completing that
[1:46:44] but what did it look like rejection
[1:46:47] tormented afflicted they were in
[1:46:49] caves and dens of the earth and they
[1:46:51] were tormented and then they were killed
[1:46:53] they were slain they were sown asunder
[1:46:56] what is this it's the kingdom of god
[1:46:58] coming amen it's elect of god coming
[1:47:00] through the ages
[1:47:01] amen what is that what are we finishing
[1:47:03] we're finishing that friends
[1:47:06] it was never recognized in this day it
[1:47:08] always looked like it was in weakness
[1:47:10] and come in humility
[1:47:12] but yet they without us are not yet
[1:47:14] finished
[1:47:15] praise be to god romans 8 35 says who
[1:47:19] shall separate us from the love of
[1:47:21] christ
[1:47:22] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:47:25] persecution
[1:47:26] or famine or neckiness or peril or sword
[1:47:31] all of a sudden you look at that and you
[1:47:32] say what
[1:47:36] if you've given your life to jesus
[1:47:37] christ you should be able to bypass all
[1:47:39] of that
[1:47:40] and the apostle paul is not expecting a
[1:47:43] bypass
[1:47:44] for any of it he said even if these
[1:47:47] things come
[1:47:48] tribulation distress persecution famine
[1:47:50] nakedness or perilous sword
[1:47:52] it will not separate us from the love of
[1:47:54] god love of christ
[1:47:56] as is written for thy sake we are killed
[1:47:59] all the day long we are accounted
[1:48:03] as sheep for the slaughter
[1:48:10] we want to be mighty but i think
[1:48:12] sometimes our
[1:48:13] our might is best expressed in our
[1:48:15] humility
[1:48:17] our might and our power and our strength
[1:48:20] is expressed in the ability to surrender
[1:48:23] to the word
[1:48:24] because how many billions of people on
[1:48:26] the planet cannot surrender to the word
[1:48:28] what's the power what's the strength
[1:48:31] what's the might
[1:48:32] to be able to subdue this flesh
[1:48:35] to bring it subject to the word that's
[1:48:38] power
[1:48:39] that's might
[1:48:42] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:48:43] nor life nor angels
[1:48:47] nor principalities nor powers nor things
[1:48:49] present nor things to come nor height
[1:48:51] nor depth nor any other creature
[1:48:53] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:48:55] love of god which is in christ jesus our
[1:48:58] lord
[1:49:01] the message desperation brother branham
[1:49:03] says
[1:49:05] the devil can impersonate any of those
[1:49:06] things but he cannot be the holy ghost
[1:49:10] he can impersonate those gifts but he
[1:49:11] cannot be the holy ghost
[1:49:14] and the holy ghost is the token that the
[1:49:15] blood has been applied because it
[1:49:17] follows the blood all the way
[1:49:19] from the book of redemption see that was
[1:49:21] the purpose of his coming
[1:49:22] that's what he followed in every age
[1:49:24] every age he has followed that
[1:49:26] to see that it's brought forth and they
[1:49:27] could not be made perfect without us
[1:49:30] and now the entire holy spirit visits
[1:49:33] the church
[1:49:34] making god in human flesh
[1:49:40] i could read that quote in a different
[1:49:42] way than the context of what i'm
[1:49:43] preaching
[1:49:45] and you can get people to stand in their
[1:49:46] seats and shout and wave their hands
[1:49:49] because it's an amazing quote think
[1:49:51] about it and now the entire holy spirit
[1:49:54] visits the church what when it when the
[1:49:56] chains were removed from it
[1:49:57] at the opening of the seals at the
[1:49:59] evening time message
[1:50:00] and now the entire holy spirit visits
[1:50:02] the church making god
[1:50:04] in human flesh
[1:50:07] that's an amazing quote the entire holy
[1:50:10] spirit visits the church this church
[1:50:12] at the end time the whole measure of the
[1:50:13] holy ghost comes at the fullness of the
[1:50:15] word
[1:50:16] making it god in human flesh
[1:50:20] and i can preach that in a certain way
[1:50:22] under a certain vein
[1:50:24] and i can take certain scriptures and
[1:50:26] certain quotes to make us
[1:50:28] to make us go wild friends and it's just
[1:50:31] as effective it's true
[1:50:33] i get excited in other contexts but now
[1:50:35] when you go in the context
[1:50:36] when the entire holy spirit was in flesh
[1:50:39] the first time
[1:50:42] when the entire holy ghost was in flesh
[1:50:44] making god in human flesh that was in
[1:50:46] the life of jesus christ
[1:50:47] and what did we see we saw rejection we
[1:50:50] saw affliction
[1:50:51] we saw suffering we saw a lamb led to
[1:50:53] the slaughter
[1:50:56] and now in the context of what we're
[1:50:58] saying this should thrill our hearts we
[1:50:59] should be absolutely thrilled and say
[1:51:01] nothing can harm us no weapon formed
[1:51:03] against you shall prosper that's
[1:51:04] absolutely the truth but that is not
[1:51:06] talking about your flesh
[1:51:08] there are weapons that can prosper over
[1:51:11] you
[1:51:12] in the flesh but nothing can touch your
[1:51:14] soul nothing can touch your life
[1:51:18] nothing can happen outside the will of
[1:51:20] god if god didn't allow it it can't
[1:51:22] happen
[1:51:24] nothing will harm you that's the truth
[1:51:25] nothing will harm you but that doesn't
[1:51:27] give you an
[1:51:28] invincibility in yourself it gives you
[1:51:30] an invincibility in the plan of god
[1:51:34] in the will of god and in the purpose of
[1:51:36] god
[1:51:38] not your flesh your flesh
[1:51:41] suffers your flesh gets sick but nothing
[1:51:44] can touch that soul
[1:51:46] nothing can take you nothing can hurt
[1:51:48] you nothing can by any means
[1:51:50] harm you why because i have a heavenly
[1:51:54] father
[1:51:55] and he already made a plan but now the
[1:51:59] entire
[1:52:00] holy spirit visits the church to make
[1:52:03] god in human flesh
[1:52:07] i say god that's the truth
[1:52:11] but i want to act exactly the way you
[1:52:13] did
[1:52:14] the first time that holy ghost was in
[1:52:16] human flesh
[1:52:18] i want to act the same way i want to be
[1:52:21] just as reverent
[1:52:22] submissive humble faithful
[1:52:25] bold i want to be everything that jesus
[1:52:28] christ was
[1:52:30] as he did before sodom the burning there
[1:52:32] which was a type then
[1:52:34] then then abraham he appeared to him
[1:52:37] i'm sorry he says now the entire holy
[1:52:39] spirit visits the church
[1:52:41] making god in human flesh as it did
[1:52:43] before sodom because god came down and
[1:52:45] took on human flesh when he went to the
[1:52:47] plains of memory
[1:52:48] and now he's done the same thing again
[1:52:51] and all these and all the things that he
[1:52:54] hasn't done now through the ages
[1:52:55] in the church ages he is now doing
[1:53:01] back to the word because the messages
[1:53:04] and the messages and the messages
[1:53:06] has to wind up in the entire word
[1:53:10] and in the last days the seven seals
[1:53:12] being opened was to pick up
[1:53:13] every straggle that's been left off in
[1:53:15] it and make the whole thing in one great
[1:53:17] big body of the bride
[1:53:18] that them who lived back there was not
[1:53:20] perfect until this
[1:53:22] church be perfected this bride group in
[1:53:24] the last days to bring them
[1:53:26] in and all together be taken up
[1:53:30] he's back the holy ghost is back
[1:53:34] he's visited his church he's back
[1:53:40] and they cannot be perfect until this
[1:53:42] church be perfect
[1:53:44] this bride group in the last days to
[1:53:47] bring them in
[1:53:48] they're waiting on us what are they
[1:53:51] waiting on
[1:53:52] they're waiting on us to stand our test
[1:53:55] to take our test
[1:53:56] and to take our test and stand our test
[1:53:58] and not fail by the word
[1:54:00] there's been failure by the word and
[1:54:02] failure by the word and failure by the
[1:54:03] word but by the grace of god there's
[1:54:05] coming of bride that's not going to fail
[1:54:07] on the word
[1:54:07] but she's got to be tested by the word
[1:54:10] and all these testing times and all
[1:54:12] these trials amen
[1:54:14] don't lose heart don't lose heart amen
[1:54:17] don't look for
[1:54:18] don't look for anything else than what
[1:54:19] god's doing right now because god what
[1:54:21] god is doing right now in his bride is
[1:54:23] exactly what god wants to do
[1:54:25] everything is right on time nothing is
[1:54:27] wrong
[1:54:28] don't say it should be this way and it
[1:54:30] should be that way and it should be it
[1:54:31] should be exactly what god's doing
[1:54:34] don't get discouraged don't lose heart
[1:54:36] don't be dissatisfied with what god's
[1:54:38] doing but say god
[1:54:39] teach me teach me in every circumstance
[1:54:42] how to yield to you and submit
[1:54:45] and then you know we don't know what's
[1:54:49] going to happen in the world the world's
[1:54:50] falling apart
[1:54:52] there may be reprieve things may get
[1:54:54] better things may get worse it may cycle
[1:54:56] back and forth
[1:54:57] it may still oscillate up and down
[1:55:00] i don't want to make any prediction on
[1:55:02] on what will happen next but the world
[1:55:04] is literally falling apart
[1:55:06] systems of the world are unraveling
[1:55:07] things are changing at a fast pace
[1:55:13] and if you see things changing
[1:55:16] and things tightening up don't get mad
[1:55:20] friends
[1:55:21] get glad do you see
[1:55:24] things pressure coming to where we don't
[1:55:27] have all the freedoms we used to have
[1:55:29] and
[1:55:29] we don't have all the liberties and it's
[1:55:30] not as easy as it used to be
[1:55:32] there's more restriction and more
[1:55:34] difficulty oh don't get upset with that
[1:55:38] because there's a promise he's made a
[1:55:41] promise
[1:55:42] and that promise comes through a
[1:55:43] prophecy when he's just about
[1:55:46] to perform her cowardly deed all the
[1:55:49] squeeze the tightening up the person
[1:55:51] with just about to accomplish her
[1:55:54] cowardly deed
[1:55:55] he snatches her away
[1:55:59] oh praise god i believe we're going to
[1:56:01] see supernatural things friends
[1:56:04] we have seen we will see but regardless
[1:56:07] of what i see
[1:56:09] the only way that i'll know that i'm
[1:56:10] overcoming is by that word because the
[1:56:14] only way to overcome is to take the word
[1:56:16] because the word is the only thing that
[1:56:18] won't fail
[1:56:18] if i don't see anything it doesn't
[1:56:20] matter i still believe that word
[1:56:23] if i claim the promise and nothing moves
[1:56:25] brother graham say you speak to this
[1:56:27] mountain and the mountain will move if
[1:56:28] you if you don't doubt in your heart
[1:56:30] brother man said sometimes you speak and
[1:56:31] you don't see any move but you didn't
[1:56:33] realize on the back side
[1:56:34] a little grain of sand broke loose and
[1:56:36] began to roll down the backside
[1:56:38] don't let your eyes discourage you don't
[1:56:40] let circumstance discourage you don't
[1:56:42] let symptoms
[1:56:43] or trials or situations in the news
[1:56:45] don't be discouraged by any of that
[1:56:47] god's got a plan and when you take that
[1:56:49] word and speak that word there might be
[1:56:50] one grain of sand that just began to
[1:56:52] move off the backside of that
[1:56:54] and you may not see that come around for
[1:56:56] months or years
[1:56:59] but don't lose heart friends because the
[1:57:01] word won't fail
[1:57:04] if god takes us through dark places he's
[1:57:06] promised to be with us
[1:57:08] and guide us if persecutions come
[1:57:12] brother brahm said persecution was
[1:57:13] always good for the church
[1:57:17] tightening up come say perfect it's
[1:57:18] prophesied
[1:57:20] don't get discouraged and don't be
[1:57:21] heartbroken say god i'm yours
[1:57:26] we are counted as sheep all the day long
[1:57:29] counter for the slaughter lord whatever
[1:57:30] your purpose for this little sheep is
[1:57:32] i want to fulfill that purpose and i
[1:57:35] want to trust in you
[1:57:36] i want to stay with your word and i want
[1:57:38] to watch you do supernatural things with
[1:57:40] your word
[1:57:42] things that i never could imagine things
[1:57:44] that i never could fabricate things that
[1:57:46] i could never do
[1:57:47] but i'm going to let you do it and i'm
[1:57:50] going to trust you
[1:57:52] let's all stand musicians if you'll come
[1:57:58] i pray that god will bless you friends
[1:58:01] these things i like preaching fun stuff
[1:58:07] where we can dance and sing and get
[1:58:09] excited about the revelation but the
[1:58:11] revelation has to produce a life
[1:58:15] all the truths that we have all this
[1:58:16] word that's been given to us
[1:58:19] it's got to be more than an excitement
[1:58:21] and enthusiasm on a sunday morning
[1:58:23] it's got to be a life monday morning
[1:58:25] tuesday morning thursday friday
[1:58:28] amen when you get bad news and when
[1:58:30] things go wrong this word
[1:58:31] has to be the thing that lives in us
[1:58:37] we could try to preach excitement and
[1:58:39] enthusiasm but what's going to happen to
[1:58:41] your
[1:58:42] excitement enthusiasm when you take a
[1:58:44] hard blow and your family is rocked to
[1:58:46] the core
[1:58:46] by a trial that hits your difficulty
[1:58:48] that comes amen i want you to think back
[1:58:50] on this message and i want you to say
[1:58:52] but i'll still believe his word but i'll
[1:58:55] take him on his word and i'll watch him
[1:58:57] do the supernatural
[1:58:58] there's nothing i have to do there's not
[1:59:00] there's no hoops i have to jump through
[1:59:02] there's no work-up emotions i have to do
[1:59:04] all i've got to do is say
[1:59:06] i still believe that word and i'm
[1:59:07] standing on your word lord
[1:59:10] i believe your promise and i believe
[1:59:11] what you said and i'm standing right
[1:59:13] here
[1:59:14] and if you slay me you'll take me
[1:59:16] believing your word
[1:59:19] and when you deliver me you'll get
[1:59:21] credit
[1:59:25] amen we we live in an uncertain time
[1:59:29] full of uncertainty
[1:59:31] i think we can all agree on that i don't
[1:59:35] think any of us
[1:59:35] has a clue what's going to happen next
[1:59:39] it used to be there was a certain
[1:59:40] pattern to life and there was a few
[1:59:42] hiccups every once in a while something
[1:59:44] would happen that was odd
[1:59:45] and then we go back to the pattern of
[1:59:46] life but that pattern is
[1:59:48] severely disrupted
[1:59:52] and the the things that used to be
[1:59:54] stable are no longer stable
[1:59:58] but i want you to realize you're more
[2:00:00] stable than you've ever been
[2:00:02] you're more secure and more sure than
[2:00:04] you have ever been a day in your life

[2:00:08] the bride

[2:00:32] he's taken out of the way
[2:00:36] friends stay with the word
[2:00:39] and be joyful in the midst of it all

[2:00:45] challenge for you a challenge for me
[2:00:46] a challenge for me to be happy when
[2:00:48] everything goes wrong
[2:00:49] a challenge for me to trust the lord

[2:00:52] i don't understand what's happening next
[2:00:54] and i see problems and i see troubles
[2:00:56] but you know what i love him many ways
[2:00:58] and i believe that he loves me
[2:00:59] and i know that this kingdom is in me
[2:01:01] and i know nothing's out of kilter so
[2:01:03] this must be what he wants and i'm happy
[2:01:05] with it
[2:01:07] fight the devil i'll fight the devil
[2:01:08] every day of my life i won't give him an
[2:01:10] inch

[2:01:21] expect them to do i'm not going to lose
[2:01:23] heart anymore
[2:01:25] but i'm going to say god you're testing
[2:01:27] me
[2:01:29] and when i'm tried i shall come forth as
[2:01:32] gold
[2:01:34] though i'm tried though i'm tested when
[2:01:36] i'm tried
[2:01:37] i shall come forth as gold
[2:01:41] what's god looking for in this earth
[2:01:42] today the gold
[2:01:45] the fiery trial just declares the gold
[2:01:49] and purifies the gold let's bow our
[2:01:52] heads friends

[2:02:12] we don't have to worry about it because
[2:02:13] you've already ordered our steps

[2:02:18] that must happen in our life for your
[2:02:20] glory

[2:02:24] attributes

[2:05:08] jesus christ's name we pray
[2:05:09] [Music]
[2:05:17] [Music]
[2:05:18] amen
[2:05:21] how we've waited for moments like this
[2:05:28] have your way in this place
[2:05:35] holy spirit come to
[2:05:38] as you wish
[2:05:42] we are changed
[2:05:48] [Applause]
[2:05:59] like this
[2:06:12] as we win
[2:06:23] i'd also like to say if we know the
[2:06:26] pattern
[2:06:27] know the pattern of jesus ministry
[2:06:30] pattern of brother branham's ministry
[2:06:33] we see it you know the the bride has
[2:06:36] been blessed she's been given a voice
[2:06:38] around the world
[2:06:40] to spread the message to be on internet
[2:06:42] to travel freely
[2:06:44] to spread the message she's been
[2:06:45] persecuted of course rejected but it's
[2:06:48] been local rejection by churches and
[2:06:50] different individuals and family members
[2:06:53] and we've had quite a deal of freedom
[2:06:55] and quite a voice
[2:06:57] the internet and airwaves
[2:07:01] you know i just want to tell you no
[2:07:03] matter what you see next
[2:07:06] don't be discouraged if you see it looks
[2:07:09] like ministries diminishing
[2:07:12] don't lose heart if it looks like
[2:07:14] powerful voices are quieted
[2:07:17] it looks like powerful ones who had
[2:07:20] great displays and before go quiet
[2:07:22] and voices are shut down and maybe
[2:07:26] internet streaming except i don't know
[2:07:28] i'm not saying i know what will happen
[2:07:30] but
[2:07:31] if you see it diminishing don't lose
[2:07:34] heart friends
[2:07:35] it fits the pattern don't get scared
[2:07:39] don't say was she the one or do we look
[2:07:42] for another
[2:07:44] don't say was this really the bride that
[2:07:46] looks so weak
[2:07:48] and humble and unable with no power
[2:07:52] because that's the way god's always done
[2:07:54] it
[2:07:55] he took the weak things of this world
[2:07:57] the beggarly elements the nobodies
[2:07:59] the castaway the cast down the rejected
[2:08:02] and that's what he was working with
[2:08:05] so whatever you see next i don't know if
[2:08:07] we'll see anything it may get better
[2:08:09] than it's ever been
[2:08:10] it may get worse i don't know but don't
[2:08:12] let what you see
[2:08:13] discourage you let the revelation of
[2:08:15] your heart stand fast with the word
[2:08:18] if it looks like it's diminishing
[2:08:20] there's a scriptural pattern for that
[2:08:22] if it looks like it's weak and it's
[2:08:25] washed up there's a scriptural pattern
[2:08:27] for that
[2:08:28] don't lose heart friends don't get
[2:08:30] discouraged
[2:08:32] god's doing mighty things powerful
[2:08:34] things
[2:08:36] things that are changing this earth
[2:08:38] he'll display himself
[2:08:40] he'll show up right on time he'll do
[2:08:42] what he's promised to do
[2:08:44] don't lose heart no matter what we see
[2:08:46] in our own lives in the lives around us
[2:08:49] stand fast with the word because that's
[2:08:51] the only way to overcome
[2:08:53] he failed he failed because she left the
[2:08:56] word
[2:08:58] if we don't leave the word we'll not
[2:09:00] fail
[2:09:01] it's guaranteed god bless you gentle
[2:09:07] shepherd
