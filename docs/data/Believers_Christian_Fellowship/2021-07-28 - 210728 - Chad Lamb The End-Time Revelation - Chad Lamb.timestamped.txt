[6:36] saints that are there with him in des
[6:38] moines iowa
[6:39] they have a wonderful assembly there

[6:46] really appreciated brother wesley
[6:49] godfrey and brother enoch dema for they
[6:50] went with me
[6:51] and it was good to have their fellowship
[6:53] there and and
[6:54] i don't know how it happened but enoch
[6:56] got wrangling into giving his testimony
[6:58] for a youth service on saturday morning
[7:01] and so i had a chance to watch it and it
[7:02] was very good and i enjoyed that
[7:04] and so i appreciate brother enoch being
[7:07] instant in season
[7:08] and out of season but he did a wonderful
[7:10] job and also brother jonathan
[7:12] baumgardner and his daughter
[7:14] surprised us by showing up there and i
[7:16] didn't know he was coming he didn't tell
[7:18] me and
[7:19] so that was a very pleasant surprise so
[7:21] we thank them for that
[7:22] it was good to have their support and
[7:23] their smiling faces so
[7:25] praise god and i appreciate your prayers
[7:27] it meant a lot to us and
[7:29] i'm glad to be back and also brother
[7:31] isaiah wants to send greetings he
[7:32] mentioned many of you by name
[7:34] and he wants to send greetings and he
[7:36] remembers the times of fellowship we've
[7:38] had together and he said it was really
[7:40] wonderful
[7:41] to get reacquainted and also he want to
[7:43] make me make
[7:44] sure that i sent you greetings from him
[7:46] and from his church
[7:48] also i just want to ask you i know it
[7:51] was read but just to remember brother
[7:52] stephen francis's family
[7:55] and his congregation there
[7:58] i found out saturday while i was
[8:00] preparing for the saturday night service
[8:02] that he had passed away
[8:04] sometime on saturday and i was quite
[8:06] devastated
[8:08] brother stephen was a very very good
[8:10] friend of mine a very dear and precious
[8:12] saint
[8:13] and one of the finest men that i've ever
[8:15] met in my life
[8:17] and he was so good to me
[8:20] and so encouraging and so kind and i
[8:23] just want
[8:24] to remember his family you know it was
[8:27] it was hardly a week went by
[8:30] maybe every week or every two weeks he
[8:31] would send me a text
[8:33] send me a quote and send me a scripture
[8:35] and send me a word of encouragement and
[8:37] i would send something back and
[8:39] if we went three weeks or four weeks
[8:41] without a quote
[8:42] or a text it was odd it was unusual so
[8:45] he was that kind of man
[8:46] he was very loving and very sweet and
[8:48] very tender
[8:50] and he had a tremendous revelation of
[8:52] the word and he was a mighty preacher
[8:53] and
[8:54] i just i'm gonna miss him missing dearly
[8:57] but he and his wife
[8:58] took covet and they were in the hospital
[9:00] together
[9:01] sister jenny's recovered enough to go
[9:03] home but they were both in the hospital
[9:06] when brother stephen died
[9:08] and he never went home but she was
[9:11] discharged from the hospital she still
[9:13] has symptoms she's still
[9:15] fighting the pneumonia that was caused
[9:17] by that but she's recovering
[9:20] and so she had to go home to an empty
[9:22] house
[9:23] after 47 years of marriage and they were
[9:25] a very very close couple
[9:28] and she's just devastated she was
[9:30] traumatized by the whole experience
[9:32] and i just pray that you just remember
[9:35] her in prayer
[9:36] remember the rest of the family also the
[9:38] work there in newcastle he was a pastor
[9:40] there for 40 years
[9:42] he founded the work there and there's no
[9:44] other church in the area no other
[9:46] message church in the area he was the
[9:47] sole pastor
[9:48] in newcastle for the last 40 years so
[9:51] his loss leaves a big impact but we know
[9:54] god knows
[9:55] all things and he does all things well
[9:58] and so i spent much of the day
[10:00] in tears weeping and praying and it was
[10:03] it was devastating i would say
[10:06] but i still know that god does all
[10:08] things well
[10:10] and there's a purpose for everything and
[10:12] god has a plan and
[10:14] it seems like it was too early seems
[10:16] like he was too young
[10:18] we prayed and i fully expected god to
[10:20] raise him up i was anticipating a
[10:21] testimony
[10:23] you know and i'd rather be on that end
[10:25] of being wrong
[10:27] is expecting god to heal because i
[10:29] expected god to raise him up
[10:30] we've seen god answer prayer so many
[10:32] times it's become such a part of routine
[10:34] of life i just expected to hear a
[10:36] testimony
[10:37] and i was quite shocked when i heard
[10:40] that he
[10:40] had passed on but
[10:44] you know god is good and we're left here
[10:47] to continue the work
[10:49] and after i spent the day just really in
[10:52] shock and
[10:53] in prayer i told god i was
[10:57] because of the life that stephen lived
[10:59] and because of the gospel that he
[11:00] preached
[11:01] and the influence he had on me i'm more
[11:04] determined than ever to preach this
[11:05] gospel
[11:06] the full power of the revelation that
[11:08] god has given us in this day
[11:10] so that his influence would not be in
[11:12] vain and it wasn't just his influence on
[11:14] me
[11:14] but multitudes of others and i'm more
[11:17] determined than ever
[11:18] to be a sounding board for this gospel
[11:20] because nowhere else
[11:22] will this world hear the truth but
[11:24] through his bride
[11:28] and there's a great voice that we had
[11:30] that's now
[11:31] been silenced and he's going on to his
[11:34] reward but i'm more determined than ever
[11:36] to let my voice sound clear and true
[11:39] and not to obscure the revelation and
[11:41] not to water it down
[11:42] and deter from what god gave us but
[11:44] preach it in its fullness
[11:46] because it's the power of transformation
[11:49] and it'll be the power of translation
[11:53] and that is what brother stephen
[11:55] believed and that's what he stood for
[11:57] i don't know if you remember but he
[11:58] preached here in october 2018
[12:00] and he preached the purpose of the
[12:02] seventh seal
[12:04] and that was brother stephen he always
[12:07] preached the seventh seal
[12:09] and i praise god that that god has given
[12:12] us the same revelation
[12:14] and we're going to continue preaching
[12:15] the seventh seal
[12:17] amen let's just read here in hebrews 13
[12:20] 8 while you're standing and we'll let
[12:22] you have your seeds
[12:26] hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same
[12:29] yesterday
[12:30] and today and forever
[12:33] you can have your seeds
[12:37] i would like to take for a subject
[12:39] tonight and preach on the end time
[12:41] revelation the end time revelation
[12:45] i've been preparing since sunday evening
[12:49] for this this evening and today god had
[12:52] just taken everything i was focusing on
[12:54] and turned it just slightly
[12:56] and so i want to look into that but
[12:59] i want to like i said for a subject i
[13:01] want to take the end time revelation but
[13:03] i
[13:03] i opened with this scripture because
[13:05] this was a major theme in brother
[13:07] brennam's ministry
[13:09] and we're going to see he how many times
[13:12] did he quote this scripture i'd have
[13:13] never went to look it up
[13:15] how many times he quoted it referenced
[13:16] it quoted it partially
[13:19] i would never know but it's jesus christ
[13:22] the same yesterday
[13:23] today and forever and i'd like to say
[13:26] that's the theme of the entire bible
[13:29] that is the theme of brother venom's
[13:31] ministry it was his ministry
[13:34] because his ministry was the purpose of
[13:35] his ministry was the seventh seal
[13:38] and it's jesus christ the same yesterday
[13:40] today
[13:41] and forever so i'd like to look at this
[13:45] this evening and the seventh seal
[13:47] brother brown says notice now for the
[13:49] end of time message this seal he's
[13:52] preaching the seventh seal
[13:54] so for the end of time message this seal
[13:56] so the seventh seal
[13:58] is the end of time message so if you
[14:00] want to know what the message
[14:02] is the end time message it is the
[14:04] seventh seal friends
[14:05] it is the seal it is it it's everything
[14:08] to us it is the revelation of the entire
[14:11] bible
[14:11] it's the purpose that god had purposed
[14:13] in his heart from before the foundation
[14:15] of the world
[14:16] god had a heart purpose and that purpose
[14:19] was to
[14:19] have a bride of his own choosing and
[14:22] that
[14:22] that heart purpose of god is expressed
[14:25] in the seventh seal
[14:26] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[14:29] and forever
[14:31] for the end of time message this seal
[14:33] after he's revealed all the six seals
[14:36] but he don't say nothing about the
[14:38] seventh
[14:40] and the end of time seal when it starts
[14:42] will be absolutely a total secret
[14:45] according to the bible
[14:47] i want you to lock into that the end
[14:49] time the end time seal what is the end
[14:51] time seal the seven seal
[14:53] the end time seal when it starts will be
[14:56] absolutely
[14:57] a total secret according to the bible
[15:00] and remember revelations 10 1 7 1-7
[15:03] chapter 10 1-7
[15:05] at the end of the seventh angel's
[15:07] message all the mysteries of god would
[15:09] be known
[15:10] were at the end time the opening of the
[15:12] seventh seal
[15:14] brother branham's clear about that he
[15:16] goes on the in christ is the mystery of
[15:18] god revealed
[15:19] now i want to go back and i want to read
[15:21] one line out of the seven seal message

[15:24] that i just read and the end time seal
[15:27] when it starts
[15:28] will be absolutely a total secret
[15:30] according to the bible
[15:33] amen then the christ is the mystery of
[15:35] god revealed

[15:57] seal when it starts
[15:58] will be absolutely a total secret
[16:01] according to the bible

[16:05] mystery what mystery

[16:08] which is the mystery of the seventh seal
[16:10] which is the mystery of the whole bible

[16:14] beloved bride
[16:16] that's the only one could see it
[16:19] it's a mystery to the world but it's a
[16:20] secret to her amen
[16:23] further in christ is the mystery of god
[16:25] revealed he says but all this mystery is
[16:27] revealed only
[16:28] as he promised to his bride but all this
[16:31] mysteries revealed only as he promised
[16:33] to his bride
[16:34] hell is against the truth of the
[16:36] revelation of this mystery
[16:38] but the bride is standing on it that's
[16:40] her
[16:41] stand what do you hunger why do you
[16:44] hunger church why do you thirst it's the
[16:46] father
[16:46] trying to reveal this hidden secret to
[16:48] you but you let so many things get it
[16:50] out of you you let your job you let your
[16:52] wife
[16:53] you let your husband you let your
[16:54] children you let the cares of the world
[16:56] you let some pastor you let somebody
[16:58] else get that out of you
[17:00] and when you know that way down in your
[17:01] heart you're thirsting hungry it's god
[17:04] trying to reveal it to you see the
[17:06] revelation
[17:07] the last day is here god is trying to
[17:10] get this revelation that's the hunger in
[17:12] our heart
[17:13] and he's trying to tell us don't let
[17:14] anything get distract you from this
[17:16] don't let a spouse don't let your
[17:18] children don't let work don't let

[17:36] and if you're that beloved bride then
[17:38] it's stirring your heart
[17:40] but don't be distracted this is not the
[17:42] hour to be distracted friends
[17:44] this is the hour to tune in your
[17:45] spiritual dial and dial into what god's
[17:48] doing and not let the cares of life
[17:50] pull it out of us where he says why do
[17:52] you hunger
[17:53] church why do you thirst it's the father
[17:55] trying to reveal this hidden
[17:57] secret to you it's a total secret to the
[18:00] world but the father is trying to reveal
[18:02] it to you
[18:02] he wants you to get it he wants you to
[18:05] know it because the love secret is for
[18:07] the beloved bride
[18:09] and this is his love secret let's turn
[18:12] to genesis chapter 2 together
[18:26] genesis chapter 2 verse 21
[18:36] genesis 2 and 21 and the lord god caused
[18:38] a deep sleep to fall upon adam
[18:41] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[18:43] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[18:46] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[18:48] from him
[18:49] from man made he a woman and brought her
[18:52] unto the man and adam said this is now
[18:55] bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh
[18:57] she shall be called woman because she
[18:59] was taken
[19:00] out of man therefore shall a man leave
[19:03] his father and his mother and shall
[19:04] cleave unto his wife
[19:06] and they shall be one flesh and they
[19:08] were both naked the man and his wife
[19:10] and we're not ashamed brother ben told
[19:13] us the seventh seal goes all the way
[19:15] back and begins to open
[19:16] all the way back in genesis and all the
[19:19] way back in genesis you find god
[19:21] in his creation working his way up to a
[19:24] masterpiece and that masterpiece was a
[19:26] man
[19:27] that was made in his own image but but
[19:29] he was going to make a masterpiece
[19:30] family so he would take the woman out of
[19:32] the man
[19:32] and unite the two were so very familiar
[19:35] with this but adam would say now this is
[19:37] bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh
[19:39] she shall be called woman because she
[19:41] was taken out of a man and he says he
[19:43] declares that they
[19:44] shall be one flesh
[19:47] and they were both naked the man and his
[19:49] wife and we're not ashamed it means they
[19:52] were both
[19:53] revealed to one another the husband was
[19:55] revealed fully to the wife
[19:57] and the wife was revealed fully to the
[19:59] husband amen and they were not ashamed
[20:01] in one another's presence because they
[20:03] were one flesh
[20:04] and there was an absolute complete
[20:06] revelation
[20:08] we're coming back to where god is
[20:10] unveiling himself to his bride
[20:12] and the word is unveiling the bride then
[20:15] now we stand with nothing separating us
[20:18] we come back to a revelation of him in a
[20:20] revelation of her
[20:22] and we're not ashamed before one another
[20:23] because he's purged us from our shame
[20:26] he's cleansed us from all
[20:27] unrighteousness and so he's bringing us
[20:30] back to this condition
[20:33] in the message the choosing of the bride
[20:34] he says the other is pregnanted by the
[20:37] word of god he's talking about two
[20:39] churches at the end time
[20:40] the false church has been pregnanted and
[20:42] will bring forth the antichrist
[20:44] amen incarnate the beast but he says the
[20:47] other is talking about the spiritual
[20:49] bride the other is pregnated by the word
[20:51] of god
[20:52] and will bring forth the body the
[20:54] finished body of jesus christ which is
[20:57] the bride
[20:58] the see the finished body of jesus
[21:01] christ
[21:02] which is the bride so what is the bride
[21:04] she's the finished body of jesus christ
[21:08] the body of christ isn't finished yet
[21:10] how many knows that
[21:12] a man and woman is one and christ is one
[21:15] body the
[21:16] word the bride will have to be the rest
[21:18] of that body
[21:20] and the two together makes the one body
[21:22] again or one flesh
[21:24] one body again like adam was at the
[21:26] beginning man and his wife are one
[21:29] now she the true bride so sold out to
[21:31] him that she uses no mind of her own
[21:33] his mind of course is his will and his
[21:36] will
[21:36] is his word so now we find out
[21:40] brother graham's telling us that the
[21:43] that
[21:44] that she's impregnated the end time
[21:46] bride
[21:47] is impregnated she's impregnated with
[21:49] the word but what she's going to bring
[21:51] forth in this pregnation
[21:53] she's going to bring forth the finished
[21:55] body of jesus christ
[21:56] because the body is not finished yet but
[21:58] this bride is bringing forth the
[22:00] finished body of jesus christ
[22:02] and the two are made flesh completing
[22:04] the body the two
[22:05] are brought together in an invisible
[22:07] union completing the body
[22:09] making the finished body of jesus christ
[22:12] that is what's happening
[22:13] under the seal that's what's happening
[22:15] in this end time is it's finishing the
[22:17] body
[22:18] because there was a restoration of the
[22:19] man but there has to be a restoration of
[22:21] the woman
[22:22] and the two have to be united back
[22:23] together before the millennium can begin
[22:26] to go back
[22:27] into an even condition because god is
[22:30] restoring back
[22:31] god he had given dominion to his son
[22:34] amen in the sixth day he had made adam
[22:37] he had made man
[22:38] and he had given dominion to man but he
[22:40] found that man was alone so
[22:42] he needed to make a help me for him but
[22:44] that help meat was part of him
[22:46] it was the completed body of adam adam's
[22:49] body wasn't finished yet
[22:51] it had to come forth in feminine also so
[22:54] when he brought that part of the body
[22:56] out
[22:56] and he united them back together in one
[22:58] one flesh now
[23:00] god's work and his masterpiece was done
[23:02] and he went and took his rest
[23:04] and when he went took his rest his
[23:05] seventh thousandth year a thousand year
[23:08] rest amen when during that rest his plan
[23:11] was interrupted and there was a fall
[23:13] and god had to leave his rest to start
[23:16] making the masterpiece again
[23:17] because it fell in ruin but god wasn't
[23:19] content to let it stay that way
[23:21] he began working again it took him six
[23:24] thousand years to make the first
[23:25] masterpiece family
[23:27] and while he was resting what made him
[23:29] what made what gave him the ability to
[23:30] go to rest
[23:31] he was able to turn over all of his
[23:33] creation to his son
[23:35] and his son's bride and he had
[23:38] confidence in his son and his son's wife
[23:40] and he went to his rest and let his son
[23:42] be the god of the earth and rule the
[23:44] earth his son and his son's wife
[23:46] together
[23:47] but there was a fall and that was
[23:48] interrupted and he left his
[23:50] rest to come start the masterpiece again
[23:53] to rebuild what had fallen
[23:55] and at the end of 6000 years he's going
[23:58] to bring
[23:59] back amen the masterpiece family he's
[24:01] got he's brought back to man
[24:03] amen in christ jesus and then out of him
[24:06] he struck a blow
[24:07] amen under his rib and pulled out the
[24:09] ingredients to build a wife
[24:10] amen and he's been building through
[24:12] seven church ages of bride
[24:14] and at the end time he's going to unite
[24:16] that bride back to him
[24:18] to be one flesh again the finished body
[24:21] of jesus christ
[24:22] male and female back to one flesh again
[24:25] and then what's he going to do then he's
[24:27] going to put them back in the millennium
[24:29] and he's going to turn the rulership of
[24:31] the earth
[24:32] back over to his son and his son's bride
[24:35] and god will complete the thousand year
[24:37] rest that he didn't complete the first
[24:39] time
[24:40] because he'll leave nothing unfinished
[24:43] so that's why there has to be a
[24:44] millennium there has to be a physical
[24:46] thousand-year millennium
[24:48] where christ reigns on the throne of
[24:50] david and the bride reigns and rules
[24:52] rules and reigns with him over all the
[24:55] earth so that god can finish
[24:56] the thousand-year reign that was
[24:58] interrupted he's not going to let
[25:00] amen his plan be interrupted but he's
[25:02] working it back and he'll take his
[25:04] thousand-year rest
[25:07] when he brings them back when he
[25:08] finishes the body
[25:10] of christ he built the mail up
[25:14] through the prophets through the through
[25:17] the patriarchs and through the prophets
[25:19] and through the psalms
[25:20] he built that one and finally it was
[25:22] capped off by the great had come and it
[25:24] was jesus christ the fullness of the old
[25:26] testament
[25:27] and he took out of him the ingredients
[25:29] for his wife the
[25:30] finishing of the body of jesus christ
[25:33] and he's been building those seven
[25:34] church ages but there's coming a great
[25:36] capping time
[25:37] when he's going to cap and complete amen
[25:39] that building of that bride and he's
[25:41] going to unite the two back together as
[25:43] one
[25:44] and that's the age we live in now
[25:49] and the two together makes one body
[25:52] again
[25:53] like adam was at the beginning man and
[25:54] his wife are one
[25:56] she the true bride so sold out to him
[25:58] that she uses no mind of her own
[26:01] his mind of course is his will and his
[26:04] will
[26:04] is his word so this bride will be so
[26:07] sold out she's not going to use her own
[26:09] mind she's not going to use her own
[26:11] reasoning her own intellect she won't
[26:12] use her own mind
[26:14] she will she will not use her own mind
[26:17] she will use his mind
[26:18] what is his mind it's not a figment of
[26:21] somebody's imagination
[26:22] his mind amen of course is his will
[26:26] and his will is his word and the word
[26:28] has been restored and we have the mind
[26:30] of christ
[26:32] and this bride won't take her own mind
[26:34] but her the headship has come
[26:36] and the headship is the word and the
[26:38] word is his mind
[26:39] and his mind is his will amen and his
[26:42] will is his word
[26:43] and now she doesn't have to rely on her
[26:45] own thinking she just takes the mind of
[26:46] christ that's been given back to us
[26:48] through a prophetic ministry
[26:52] she will stand on that word in that word
[26:55] only in the message it is the rising of
[26:58] the sun
[27:00] prophet says that's what he proved
[27:01] hallelujah
[27:03] that's what easter proved he wasn't only
[27:05] the word but he was god himself the
[27:08] dynamics
[27:09] in the word that made the body of jesus
[27:12] christ cold stiff and dead in the grave
[27:15] shaken the life and rise again and roll
[27:17] away the stone
[27:18] i am he that was dead so dead till the
[27:20] sun said he was dead the moon said he
[27:22] was dead
[27:23] the star said he was dead all nature
[27:25] said he was dead
[27:26] and now the whole world has recognized
[27:28] that he's alive again
[27:30] he was not only the mechanics god's word
[27:33] he was the dynamics to prove it
[27:35] and as he being the groom the bride has
[27:37] to come forth
[27:38] because it's part of him and it can only
[27:41] be the manifestation of the fulfilling
[27:43] of
[27:43] all the revelations any others have
[27:45] spoke of the bride
[27:47] it can only manifest if it does
[27:49] something different from the groom it
[27:51] isn't the bride
[27:52] because she is flesh of his flesh bone
[27:54] of his bone
[27:55] life of his life power of his power she
[27:58] is him oh i hope that locks down we've
[28:02] been through this many times but don't
[28:04] let it become common
[28:05] don't let it be another phrase excuse me
[28:08] another phrase that we've heard
[28:09] let it become a living reality in our
[28:11] lives that she
[28:12] is him amen and a man and woman are one
[28:16] and the woman taken from his
[28:18] side she had taken a spirit the feminist
[28:20] spirit from him
[28:22] the flesh from his side made both
[28:23] mechanics and dynamics the wife
[28:26] the spirit of him and the flesh of him
[28:28] and put together and made mechanics
[28:31] and dynamics so he she is the word she
[28:34] is the manifested word
[28:35] but he is the life he's the dynamics of
[28:37] that word and now he is united with the
[28:39] bride
[28:40] so that she's both mechanics and
[28:42] dynamics of the word
[28:45] that's why this is the resurrection in
[28:46] this age
[28:48] it's the resurrection of the bride tree
[28:50] it's the resurrection of the fallen
[28:51] bride
[28:52] amen she's resurrected in this day under
[28:55] this resurrected ministry
[28:56] because the dynamics have come
[28:58] [Music]
[28:59] let's look over at genesis chapter 5.
[29:10] genesis 5 and 1 this is the book of the
[29:13] generations of adam and the day that god
[29:15] created man
[29:16] and the likeness of god made he him male
[29:19] and female created he them
[29:20] and blessed them and called their name
[29:23] adam
[29:24] and the day they were created
[29:27] so these two were one flesh
[29:30] and when god named them he named them
[29:32] adam because they were one
[29:35] they were not two they were one
[29:39] brother venom gets a question and
[29:40] questions and answers on the seals
[29:42] and the question is the bride of christ
[29:44] and the body of christ
[29:45] the same so listen to the question is
[29:48] the bride of christ
[29:49] and the body of christ the same yes sir
[29:54] now see i don't want to get started on
[29:55] that because i'll preach a sermon on c
[29:56] but
[29:57] i i won't do that but i want to show you
[29:59] when god gave adam his bride from his
[30:01] side
[30:02] she is flesh of my flesh bone of my bone
[30:04] is that right when god give
[30:05] christ his bride the spirit gave the
[30:07] flesh the bride
[30:09] he was pierced in his side under his
[30:11] heart and the water and blood and spirit
[30:12] came forth
[30:13] that became flesh of his flesh bone of
[30:15] his bone we are the flesh and bones
[30:18] the bride will be the flesh and bones of
[30:20] christ exactly
[30:22] that is his bride
[30:26] amen not something different but a
[30:28] continuation of the same thing
[30:31] we can't keep thinking differently amen
[30:33] god has come down and redeemed these
[30:35] bodies so that he can live in these
[30:37] bodies
[30:37] so that these bodies can be the
[30:39] tabernacle of the holy ghost so that
[30:41] these bodies can be his flesh
[30:43] and his bones they're united with christ
[30:47] amen not in a way not in the time but
[30:50] we're united with christ amen the
[30:51] dynamics has come to make the mechanics
[30:54] live so that it is him
[30:57] alive on this earth jesus christ the
[31:01] same yesterday
[31:02] today and forever
[31:06] if we take that scripture and apply it
[31:09] in the past and apply in the future
[31:11] we've missed the whole point of hebrews
[31:13] 13 8
[31:14] because he's the same today as he was
[31:16] yesterday and he will be tomorrow
[31:18] he has to be the same
[31:23] and the message the seed shall not be
[31:25] aired with the shock
[31:27] alpha says that's what the church is
[31:29] doing today for
[31:30] jesus is the word and he is the
[31:32] bridegroom and the bride is a part of
[31:34] the groom
[31:35] therefore the word that is to be
[31:37] fulfilled this day is the same part of
[31:39] the word
[31:40] that was fulfilled in his day and it's
[31:42] the same word
[31:43] same experience same life amen there was
[31:47] word that has been portioned in the word
[31:49] and the word was with god and the word
[31:51] was god and we know that the word is god
[31:53] and there was word portion for each day
[31:55] and he was the fullness of the word in
[31:57] his day
[31:58] and we were part of that word and this
[32:00] word today is still part of the same
[32:02] thing
[32:03] it's not something different it has to
[32:05] be the same thing
[32:06] and the word being expressed today is
[32:09] the same thing as the same body
[32:11] of jesus christ
[32:15] it's the same life for when god
[32:17] separated adam he was both we find
[32:19] adam was spirit to begin with he made
[32:22] man in his own image created him male
[32:24] and female and then genesis 2
[32:26] and on he created man and out of the
[32:29] dust of the earth man was created in
[32:30] god's image
[32:31] god of spirit so he's a spirit man then
[32:34] when he became flesh man
[32:35] animal flesh on the earth he is showing
[32:37] portraying here the bride
[32:39] he never taken and made another being
[32:41] but he took part of adam the original
[32:44] creation
[32:45] took from him a rib from his side and
[32:47] took the feminist spirit out of adam
[32:49] left the masculine spirit there and
[32:51] placed it in the feminist part
[32:54] therefore part of his spirit part of his
[32:56] body
[32:57] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word
[32:59] of his word
[33:00] life of his life and that's the way the
[33:03] bride
[33:04] is to christ
[33:07] just laying many of these quotes down
[33:09] we're familiar with them but i'm laying
[33:10] down
[33:11] as a foundation and christ is the
[33:14] mystery of god revealed he says so
[33:15] therefore
[33:16] there is no school no theologians no
[33:19] teachings of the bible among any school
[33:21] that knows anything about it they cannot
[33:23] know nothing about it it's impossible
[33:25] for them to know anything about it
[33:27] god has hid the sense of knowing it from
[33:29] the very elect teachers and everything
[33:30] else
[33:31] it's a personal individual affair with
[33:34] the person that christ
[33:36] is revealed to them and if you say he's
[33:38] been revealed to me
[33:40] and the life that christ produced here
[33:42] in the bible
[33:43] that same life is not in him does not
[33:45] produce itself in you
[33:46] then you've got the wrong revelation
[33:50] and see what brother bran is telling us
[33:52] you can claim to have any revelation you
[33:55] want
[33:55] but a revelation has to produce
[33:58] something amen
[33:59] and the revelation of jesus christ the
[34:01] true revelation of jesus christ in this
[34:03] hour
[34:04] must produce the life of jesus christ
[34:07] it has to be the same life amen not a
[34:10] different life not an
[34:11] altar life but she must have the same
[34:13] life for she's life of his life spirit
[34:16] of his spirit
[34:17] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen
[34:19] she cannot show
[34:20] something that he didn't show she cannot
[34:23] have another character that he didn't
[34:25] have
[34:26] she cannot have another nature that he
[34:28] didn't have before she comes from him
[34:30] amen and she was joined back to him and
[34:33] she's the completed body of christ
[34:35] and that's why if you say we're heavily
[34:37] revelated
[34:38] heavily revelated means we should live
[34:40] the life of jesus christ
[34:43] but if we become heavily revelated and
[34:45] we can deny his word and trespass on his
[34:47] word
[34:48] and live like the world and take in the
[34:50] entertainments of the world
[34:51] and feast on the things of the world and
[34:52] do what the world does it shows that we
[34:55] don't have the revelation we think that
[34:57] we have
[34:58] because a revelation amen is the mind of
[35:01] christ
[35:01] we've been given the mind of christ by
[35:04] an open book
[35:05] and the mind of christ will produce the
[35:06] life of christ
[35:08] [Applause]
[35:10] so it doesn't matter if we've said in
[35:12] the message
[35:13] 20 30 40 years it doesn't matter if
[35:15] we've listened to 1200 tapes
[35:17] amen the real revelation of this word
[35:20] will produce a real life
[35:23] and if there's no life amen my question
[35:26] is where's your revelation
[35:28] it's just intellect it's just words amen
[35:30] it's not that christ has been made
[35:32] personal to you
[35:33] it's not that christ has come himself
[35:35] and giving you the revelation of
[35:37] what this means in this day it was more
[35:40] than god sent a prophet
[35:42] amen god was calling a bride to be the
[35:45] finished body of jesus christ
[35:48] he wanted to display on this earth amen
[35:51] what has not been displayed correctly
[35:53] yet amen
[35:54] that there is a wife amen a bride that
[35:57] will stay
[35:58] with the word and not compromise and
[36:00] will not be deceived like all the other
[36:02] ones were deceived
[36:03] the message came to produce that part of
[36:06] the seventh seal
[36:10] that should be our whole life friends
[36:13] that should be everything
[36:15] you see it's not about churches
[36:20] it's not about church services
[36:24] it's not about buildings it's not about
[36:27] conventions
[36:28] it's not it's not about what we so many
[36:31] times think it's about
[36:32] this isn't about having a correct church
[36:36] it's not about having a correct church
[36:38] in church order
[36:39] it's not about correct doctrine
[36:43] i hope you hang with me and catch what
[36:44] i'm saying it's not
[36:46] about just knowing about the bible
[36:49] it's not about a church building or a
[36:52] church service
[36:53] amen it is about christ manifesting
[36:56] himself
[36:57] in the formation of his bride the
[36:59] feminine of jesus christ
[37:01] on display on this earth so it can be
[37:03] seen
[37:05] as a testimony to the world amen that
[37:08] christ is still alive
[37:11] and if we have a revelation and that
[37:14] revelation will
[37:15] allow you to live amen and compromise
[37:18] without uh without uh mean
[37:21] being condemned and being convicted and
[37:24] and repenting
[37:25] amen i say go back and ask for a real
[37:28] revelation from god
[37:31] because the revelation has to produce
[37:33] christ
[37:34] the reason it was revealed the reason
[37:36] the seals were open
[37:37] amen the reason of all that is to reveal
[37:41] christ to the bride to bring him her
[37:44] back in contact with him
[37:45] and him back in contact with her to
[37:47] unite the two as one
[37:49] the reason there was a son of man
[37:50] ministry on the earth amen
[37:52] was to make him so real that it will
[37:54] unite the two together
[37:57] to do what to reveal the son of man
[37:59] again
[38:02] not to reveal a church
[38:07] not to reveal a correct order to the
[38:10] service
[38:12] not to reveal good preaching
[38:16] all of that's part of it but that's not
[38:18] it
[38:19] none of those things are wrong i'm not
[38:21] saying they're wrong
[38:22] i'm saying that's not it
[38:26] what did he want he wanted to live in
[38:29] his bride
[38:31] what did he want he wanted to restore
[38:33] the masterpiece that had fallen in the
[38:35] garden of eden
[38:38] he wanted a woman that would be
[38:41] the very reflection of the bridegroom
[38:46] he wanted a bride that would be so
[38:48] surrendered and
[38:49] so sold out by the revelation and born
[38:52] again by the spirit of god
[38:54] and so given to the mind of god that she
[38:56] will be a reflection
[38:58] of whatever he was
[39:04] the woman was intended to be the
[39:06] reflection
[39:08] of the man the bible says the woman is
[39:12] the glory of the man
[39:15] the woman is the glory of the man
[39:18] and so what is christ's glory what is
[39:20] the glory of jesus christ it's the bride
[39:22] of jesus christ
[39:23] she's the glory of the man she's made in
[39:27] his
[39:27] image she's a reflection of him she
[39:30] comes
[39:30] out of him amen and she receives his
[39:32] spirit and she's united back to him
[39:36] to do what to reflect him
[39:41] not to reflect her own ideas not to
[39:44] reflect her own ideas
[39:45] her own ambitions her own plans her own
[39:48] wants
[39:49] she's here to reflect his life
[39:53] let's turn to john chapter 14.
[40:00] i just pray that god will help me to
[40:03] preach this
[40:03] and the way it's come to me because
[40:06] preaching is foolishness
[40:11] it's it is such a a futile method it's
[40:14] such a
[40:15] uh uh it's such a horrible way to take a
[40:19] revelation that god gives you in your
[40:20] heart and bring it out
[40:22] but it is god's way and so we're
[40:26] dependent on god's ways but john chapter
[40:28] 14 verse 6
[40:30] jesus saith unto him i am the way the
[40:33] truth and the
[40:34] and the life no man cometh unto the
[40:37] father
[40:38] but by me
[40:41] so if you want to get to the father you
[40:43] have to go through christ
[40:46] that means he's the door he's the gate
[40:50] to the father thomas said unto him lord
[40:54] we know not whether thou go i'm sorry
[40:57] verse seven
[40:57] if ye had known me you should have known
[41:00] my father also and from henceforth you
[41:02] know him
[41:03] and have seen him philip saith unto him
[41:05] lord show us the father and it sufficeth
[41:07] us jesus said unto him i have been so
[41:10] long time with you
[41:12] and yet hast thou not known me philip he
[41:14] that has seen me has seen the father
[41:16] and how sayest thou show us the father
[41:19] believeth thou not that i am in the
[41:21] father
[41:22] and the father in me the words that i
[41:24] speak unto you i speak not of myself but
[41:26] the father that dwelleth in me
[41:28] he doeth the works believe me not
[41:31] believe me that i am in the father and
[41:33] the father in me or else believe me for
[41:35] the very
[41:36] work's sake
[41:39] jesus is saying i am a reflection
[41:43] of the father he had no mind of his own
[41:46] he took no mind of his own he took no
[41:49] will of his own he surrendered his will
[41:51] to the will of the father
[41:52] he did that which the father he only
[41:55] spoke what the father taught him
[41:57] he only did what the father showed him
[42:00] he was given the mind of the father
[42:02] and the mind of the father is what he
[42:04] lived by and because he only did what
[42:06] the father showed him and he only spoke
[42:08] what the father taught him
[42:10] he became the reflection of the father
[42:12] amen when you when you see
[42:14] me you see the father philip say show us
[42:18] the father
[42:18] jesus always talking about the father
[42:20] and he says well show us the father he
[42:22] said have i been so long with you that
[42:24] you don't know me
[42:25] when you see me you see the father
[42:28] why because it was the father's life in
[42:30] him
[42:31] and he was the physical uh manifestation
[42:34] of the full thought of god god's thought
[42:37] was now
[42:37] being displayed and jesus christ mind
[42:40] was the word of god
[42:41] his action was the word of god his will
[42:44] was surrendered to the word of god
[42:45] and he became the manifestation of the
[42:47] father
[42:50] and that relationship is the
[42:52] relationship between christ and his
[42:53] bride
[42:54] i mean she's not to take her own thought
[42:56] she only speaks what he teaches
[42:58] amen she surrenders her will to his will
[43:00] and she only does what she's seen him do
[43:04] and she becomes a reflection of jesus
[43:07] christ
[43:10] let's look at verse 18.
[43:14] jesus is still still speaking to his
[43:16] disciples here in chapter 14 he comes to
[43:18] verse 18 he says i will not leave you
[43:20] comfortless
[43:22] i will come to you yet a little while
[43:25] and the world sees me no more
[43:26] but you see me because i live you shall
[43:29] live also
[43:31] at that day you shall know that i am in
[43:33] my father
[43:34] and ye and me and i
[43:37] in you show us the father
[43:43] i'm showing you the father
[43:47] same way you could come to the true
[43:48] bride of jesus christ and said
[43:50] show us jesus christ i'm showing you
[43:52] jesus christ
[43:54] if i'm taking his word and living his
[43:57] word
[43:57] if i've surrendered my will to his will
[44:00] if i only speak what he taught
[44:02] if i only do what he did i'm showing you
[44:05] jesus christ
[44:08] in a form brother bam says in christ is
[44:12] the mystery of god revealed referring to
[44:14] this scripture
[44:15] he said now notice god making himself
[44:19] known not we're not supposed to make
[44:21] converse to christianity by a government
[44:23] but by the revelation the christ in you
[44:26] as god was in christ so how are we
[44:29] supposed to make
[44:31] how are we supposed to make converts not
[44:33] through government
[44:34] not through rules not through an
[44:36] adherence
[44:38] to a set of rules or a code of conduct
[44:40] amen we can't make message believers by
[44:43] getting them to act and dress like
[44:44] message believers
[44:48] do you understand that's not conversion
[44:51] amen
[44:51] that's not how we give conversions
[44:53] because it says
[44:55] we're not supposed to make conference
[44:56] christianity by government but by the
[44:58] revelation
[44:59] what revelation the christ in you
[45:02] that revelation the christ in you
[45:06] as god was in christ so what jesus was
[45:09] saying to them
[45:10] amen have i been so long with you don't
[45:12] know me when you see me you see the
[45:14] father that's how god was in christ
[45:16] amen and that's how we're to make
[45:17] converts by being that life of jesus
[45:19] christ
[45:20] on display so that when you see me you
[45:22] see the life of christ
[45:26] what's it going to take surrender to the
[45:28] word
[45:29] a surrender to the word jesus jesus
[45:32] surrendered
[45:33] to the father
[45:36] when when what god did in christ god
[45:39] does christ does in you
[45:41] what signs did god in christ christ does
[45:43] in you
[45:44] oh isn't that beautiful oh my i like
[45:47] that
[45:47] jesus said at that day that's this day
[45:51] so don't this doesn't apply anywhere
[45:52] else it applies right now
[45:54] this is the day this is the time and
[45:56] it's not for another people friends it's
[45:58] for you and i
[46:00] i'm so glad that god gave us a real
[46:02] prophet amen and that real prophet was a
[46:04] real man
[46:05] who could flesh out this word but show
[46:08] us what it was like
[46:09] to live a life and i'm so glad that that
[46:13] man would tell us all his mistakes
[46:16] and he may not have told us all his
[46:17] mistakes but he told us mistakes
[46:21] do you know how discouraged you and i
[46:23] would be if brother benham didn't tell
[46:24] us
[46:25] he had his wife lied to the lawyer and
[46:28] then when he went to pray for the baby
[46:29] god refused him and said how can you
[46:31] pray
[46:31] when you lied and you had to go make
[46:33] that right amen
[46:35] because we're supposed to live the life
[46:37] of jesus christ
[46:38] amen and flesh out christ the
[46:40] manifestation of christ in brine form
[46:42] but brother branham was the wave chief
[46:44] he was that the first one to come to
[46:46] maturity
[46:46] he was showing us what it's like to be
[46:48] mature in christ
[46:50] and he was showing us what it was like
[46:51] to live the life of christ
[46:54] but in living the life of christ he
[46:56] would still tell
[46:58] his wife to lie to the lawyer that
[47:01] wasn't christ
[47:04] but when god stopped him and he come
[47:05] around and repented amen
[47:07] and he repented and he made it all right
[47:10] that was christ that was a surrender to
[47:11] christ that was the display
[47:13] of the humility of christ and the
[47:14] surrender of christ to the will of the
[47:16] father
[47:17] when brother branham got his feelings
[47:19] hurt because they weren't listening to
[47:21] him and he felt rejected amen after he
[47:22] preached the seals and he was going to
[47:24] trap his wife
[47:25] into going up in to alaska and be a guy
[47:28] and he was going to trick her into
[47:29] getting up there and he was just going
[47:30] to be
[47:31] like an old hermit like an old prophet
[47:33] and grow his beard out and stomp out of
[47:35] the wilderness and give a message and go
[47:36] back
[47:38] he was doing that because his feelings
[47:40] got hurt and he had built up a complex
[47:46] i'm so glad he told us that or else when
[47:49] brother branham come to these other
[47:51] scriptures and
[47:51] he says amen as god was in christ christ
[47:55] is in you
[47:55] i would think it's impossible to do it
[47:57] but god had lifted up a vessel in this
[47:59] day
[48:00] and then that vessel was the first part
[48:02] of that word amen that bride word to
[48:03] come to full harvest maturity
[48:05] and it was waved over the people showing
[48:07] that whatever brought this maturity will
[48:09] bring you to maturity
[48:10] and what brought him to maturity it was
[48:12] the revelation of the word
[48:14] it wasn't because he had special
[48:16] genetics or special mom or special death
[48:18] or special training or he had a special
[48:20] temperament amen he had
[48:22] he had a special temperament but that's
[48:23] not what it was it was the revelation of
[48:25] the word that produced the life of the
[48:27] word
[48:29] and when you receive the word and its
[48:31] fullness the word brings a life with it
[48:35] and brother brenham displayed that but
[48:36] i'm so thankful he was honest
[48:38] and he told us about his plan to come to
[48:41] the wilderness and he told us about god
[48:42] rebuking him
[48:45] and then he come and told the church and
[48:47] repented and he said i still
[48:49] can't go out yet i still don't i still
[48:52] feel
[48:52] like they ought to have heard he was
[48:54] still offended and he said i can't go
[48:56] out
[48:57] amen until this feeling gets out of me
[49:01] oh friends when when we preach this kind
[49:04] of preaching
[49:05] amen don't get too discouraged to the
[49:07] point of saying well i'll never live
[49:08] that life
[49:09] you're called to live that life this is
[49:11] the age this is the day
[49:12] amen that day is this day and if god has
[49:15] called you you're the people to do it
[49:17] amen and how will i do it i'll do it
[49:19] exactly the way that prophet did
[49:20] when god corrects me by the word i'll
[49:22] say i'm sorry lord forgive me i'll make
[49:24] it right
[49:26] and when he corrects you by the word and
[49:27] corrects you by the word and corrects
[49:29] you by the word amen it's not about
[49:31] living
[49:32] a perfect life and there's never any
[49:34] humanity left and never any failure
[49:36] but every failure is brought subject to
[49:38] the word every facet of our life
[49:40] when it's illuminated before us we
[49:42] surrender that back to the word
[49:45] there's been many things over the last
[49:47] few years that god has put his
[49:48] illumination of his word on
[49:50] and we've had to make many adjustments
[49:52] amen there's things in my life i've had
[49:54] to adjust
[49:54] and i thought i had that wrong i
[49:56] understood that wrong that's not
[49:58] pleasing to the lord and i had to make
[50:00] an adjustment and i say praise god for
[50:02] the ability to see the word and praise
[50:04] god for a heart that says i want nothing
[50:07] but that word to live in me i gladly
[50:10] surrender my own ideas i gladly
[50:12] surrender
[50:13] is it a struggle yes it's a struggle
[50:15] brother branham surrendered under the
[50:16] rebuke of god
[50:18] telling him if he goes up there he'll
[50:20] become a bomb and his wife will leave
[50:21] him
[50:23] but even after he submitted to that and
[50:25] told his church he was still struggling
[50:27] with the feelings
[50:30] so it just goes to show to manifest this
[50:33] kind of seed life
[50:34] doesn't mean that you're never going to
[50:36] have a struggle that you won't struggle
[50:38] with feelings
[50:39] that difficult things won't happen but
[50:41] what is it it's a surrender to the will
[50:43] of god
[50:44] and his will is his mind his mind is his
[50:47] will
[50:47] his will is his word and it's a constant
[50:49] surrender to his word
[50:53] i don't think he's done shaping us
[50:56] i think he'll continue to illuminate
[50:58] things out of the word and i think it's
[51:00] an opportunity for the expression of the
[51:02] christ
[51:02] to say be it unto me according to your
[51:06] word
[51:12] still in the same scripture and then
[51:14] same quote crisis the mystery of god
[51:16] revealed
[51:18] jesus said at that day that's this day
[51:20] at that day when this revelation
[51:21] is made known what day the day this
[51:25] revelation is made known
[51:28] you will know that i am in the father
[51:31] and the father and me and i in you
[51:35] and you and me when the revelation
[51:39] is made manifest at that day you shall
[51:42] know that i and the father are one
[51:44] i am in the father and the father is in
[51:46] me then
[51:48] when the revelation comes forth then
[51:50] it's i in you
[51:52] and you and me what is that revelation
[51:55] of the end time what is the end time
[51:57] seal
[51:57] the end time revelation supposed to
[51:59] produce when that
[52:00] revelation comes forth then it's i in
[52:04] you
[52:04] and you and me see a revelation
[52:08] puts us in position
[52:11] a revelation is not just more knowledge
[52:13] that's that we can debate
[52:16] actually when you get a real revelation
[52:17] there's no interest in debating it it
[52:19] becomes such a part of your life
[52:21] it's not worth arguing about it's too
[52:23] precious to debate
[52:26] and this revelation is too precious to
[52:28] debate friends
[52:30] and then when the revelation comes forth
[52:31] then it's i
[52:33] in you and you and me see we need the
[52:35] end time revelation to recognize
[52:37] who we really are and what we're called
[52:39] to and what our position is
[52:41] and then it's in you and you and me
[52:44] then we become one flesh there you are
[52:47] see the manifold threefold manifestation
[52:51] what for
[52:52] to bring it back we've got to be
[52:56] let's go to revelation chapter four
[52:59] together
[53:11] revelation chapter 4 verse 1
[53:14] after this after what after the
[53:17] revelation of the seven church ages
[53:19] after laodicea after christ is put on
[53:22] the outside and he's knocking at the
[53:24] door
[53:24] after this i looked and behold a door
[53:27] was open
[53:28] in heaven and the first voice which i
[53:31] which i heard the first voice which i
[53:34] heard was as it were of a trumpet
[53:35] talking with me which said come up
[53:37] hither and i will show thee things which
[53:39] must be
[53:40] hereafter when i come to this scripture
[53:44] i just remember something i heard
[53:45] brother stephen francis say
[53:47] he said heaven is another dimension
[53:51] and we believe that right heaven is a
[53:52] dimension
[53:54] is heaven far away heaven's right here
[53:58] heaven's another dimension and in that
[54:00] dimension it doesn't need doors there's
[54:02] not a wooden door there's not a door on
[54:04] hinges that need to be opened
[54:06] amen what is this what's opening it's an
[54:08] opening
[54:09] opening access into heaven because
[54:11] there's a separation of the two
[54:12] dimensions
[54:13] and here's a door that is open into
[54:15] heaven and john is going to go through
[54:17] that door
[54:18] amen and that door is christ it's a
[54:21] revelation of jesus christ that'll bring
[54:23] us up into the heavenly realm
[54:25] and that door is open after these things
[54:28] amen
[54:28] after the jesus christ is put on the
[54:30] outside of the laodicean church age
[54:33] after this look i looked and there was a
[54:35] door open in heaven
[54:36] praise god amen there's a revelation of
[54:38] jesus christ that will give me access
[54:40] back to the mind of god
[54:46] and john goes through that open door
[54:49] let's go to revelation 10.
[54:53] and 7.
[55:00] revelation 10 and 7 but in the days of
[55:02] the voice of the seventh angel
[55:04] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[55:08] of god singular the
[55:12] mystery of god should be
[55:15] finished as he had declared to his
[55:18] servants
[55:19] the prophets see
[55:22] john needed to go through this open door
[55:26] at the end of the church ages there's
[55:28] things that the church had to see
[55:31] and we have to go into the revelation
[55:34] that's beyond the church age revelation
[55:37] we have to go beyond this understanding
[55:39] that's beyond the church age
[55:40] understanding
[55:42] just so we can find our proper position
[55:45] and when the revelation comes of the
[55:48] mystery of god
[55:49] amen it opens unto us an understanding
[55:53] of our position
[55:54] of who we really are who god intended
[55:57] for us to be from before the foundation
[55:59] of the world
[56:00] and what god's plan is and where we are
[56:02] in time and what he's trying to
[56:03] accomplish
[56:04] and when the revelation comes then it's
[56:07] you and i
[56:08] and i and you then it becomes
[56:11] the two united together
[56:15] and the feast of trumpets the brother of
[56:17] him says there was three stages of it
[56:19] the martyr's age uh age of the martyr
[56:22] for it and then the stage of the
[56:23] reformer
[56:24] and now the calling out time when
[56:27] finished at laodicea according to
[56:28] revelation 10
[56:30] the mystery of all the bible would be
[56:32] known to the bride
[56:34] praise god god wants to give the mystery
[56:36] of all the bible
[56:37] so there's a mystery of this whole bible
[56:40] and the mystery
[56:41] is is the mystery of god
[56:44] and god and when it's finished at
[56:46] laodicean age according to revelation 10
[56:48] the mystery of all the bible
[56:49] would be made known to the bride why did
[56:52] god do that amen
[56:53] why did god open up the door in heaven
[56:55] why did god open the mystery of the
[56:57] whole bible
[56:58] and give it to the bride amen there must
[57:00] have been a purpose in doing all of that
[57:02] amen and i'll tell you it was not i said
[57:05] it before but i said again
[57:06] it was not for church services
[57:09] it wasn't so that we could come to
[57:11] church on sunday and have something
[57:13] exciting to excite the people
[57:14] so that we could go home and say that
[57:16] was a good service that's not the point
[57:18] amen
[57:18] god's not opening up the revelation so
[57:20] that we could go home and say that was a
[57:22] good service go to work on monday and
[57:24] hope to come back on wednesday and have
[57:25] another good service
[57:26] it wasn't for good services amen it was
[57:29] to produce a life
[57:30] and a bride that jesus christ could be
[57:33] manifested reflected
[57:34] in the formation of his bride that there
[57:36] will be a female representation of jesus
[57:39] christ
[57:40] on this earth in the end time that will
[57:42] represent what he's been doing through
[57:44] seven
[57:44] church ages and he caps it off and the
[57:46] end time bride
[57:48] amen is the restored bride tree
[57:51] come back to her position again
[57:54] that's why this revelation came in this
[57:56] hour
[57:58] and if we have that revelation and don't
[58:02] want to live for christ it shows we need
[58:05] to go back
[58:08] and ask god for a clear revelation
[58:13] in the message identification from 1964
[58:18] the bible says then see god come down
[58:20] and the character of god was in christ
[58:23] so what character was christ
[58:25] representing he was portraying the
[58:27] character of god
[58:29] when he was interacting with pharisees
[58:32] amen when he was interacting with the
[58:33] woman at the well
[58:34] when he was interacting amen with mary
[58:37] magdalene and with his disciples
[58:39] and zacchaeus what was it he was
[58:41] portraying the nature of god amen
[58:43] so that man could see god's nature
[58:50] he was re he was the reflection
[58:53] he was god made visible notice god
[58:57] made visible in the beginning was god he
[59:00] wasn't even god then no god is an object
[59:02] of worship
[59:03] only thing he was was the eternal and in
[59:05] him was attributes and those attributes
[59:07] were thoughts
[59:08] and those thoughts was expressed to
[59:09] words and word was made manifest
[59:12] what is it it's all god becoming
[59:16] tangible what is all the word
[59:19] it's god becoming tangible so what would
[59:22] the revelation of the whole bible be
[59:25] it would be the revelation of god
[59:27] becoming tangible amen what is the
[59:29] mystery of god
[59:30] the mystery of god is god becoming
[59:32] tangible
[59:35] what is it it's all god becoming
[59:38] tangible
[59:39] and you are part of god
[59:44] and jesus come to redeem those that was
[59:46] put on the land's book of life
[59:48] before the foundation of the world it
[59:50] was in god's thoughts
[59:51] and that's what he come to redeem and
[59:53] then as soon as it strikes to them
[59:56] they see it because the life is in there
[59:58] but if the life isn't in
[1:00:00] there then what can they do see they
[1:00:02] don't see it they'll never see it see
[1:00:04] and the whole thing is jesus said at
[1:00:06] that day you'll know that i'm in the
[1:00:08] father
[1:00:08] the father and me i and you and you and
[1:00:10] me the whole
[1:00:12] thing is god becoming material like a
[1:00:14] husband and wife becoming one together
[1:00:17] god in his church becoming one what is
[1:00:20] it the whole thing
[1:00:22] what's on display today the whole thing
[1:00:25] see brother branham says i i want to
[1:00:28] turn to it here
[1:00:29] i have it not in my notes but i pulled
[1:00:31] it up
[1:00:33] he says look christ in you makes him the
[1:00:35] center of life of the revelation see
[1:00:37] christ's life in you makes him the
[1:00:39] center of the revelation
[1:00:40] christ in the bible makes the bible the
[1:00:43] complete revelation of christ
[1:00:45] christ in you makes you the complete
[1:00:47] revelation of the whole thing
[1:00:50] see what god is trying to do
[1:00:53] what is god trying to do god's trying to
[1:00:56] show
[1:00:57] amen this end time message in a people
[1:01:00] not on books not on tapes amen
[1:01:03] he's trying to get it from the book and
[1:01:05] the tape from the bible
[1:01:07] he's trying to get it into a people so
[1:01:09] that the word that was in his mind the
[1:01:11] thought that he had before the
[1:01:12] foundation of the world
[1:01:13] would become spoken word and the spoken
[1:01:15] word will come into manifestation
[1:01:17] and what are you upon your new birth
[1:01:19] you're a spoken word creation of god
[1:01:21] manifesting the very thoughts of god
[1:01:23] that he had at this end time
[1:01:26] the thought and the thought that he
[1:01:28] would have of an endtime bride
[1:01:32] that's what the revelation is to produce
[1:01:39] again in christ as the mystery of god
[1:01:41] revealed he says now you see
[1:01:43] now you see the seals praise god
[1:01:46] now you see the seals when he was in his
[1:01:48] mediatory work back there redeeming but
[1:01:50] someday he comes forth to get this book
[1:01:52] that he's redeemed
[1:01:54] and all that's in the book would be him
[1:01:56] for that's the believer
[1:01:58] the words in the book and the word is
[1:02:01] him
[1:02:04] so what is the mystery of god it's the
[1:02:06] mystery of the whole bible
[1:02:09] what is the bible it's the word of god
[1:02:11] what is the word of god
[1:02:12] it's god and everything that's in this
[1:02:17] book the book of redemption
[1:02:18] the title deed book the marriage
[1:02:20] certificate the bible he calls it all
[1:02:23] the same thing
[1:02:24] amen and all that's in the book would be
[1:02:26] him amen you say well my name's in the
[1:02:28] book but he said all that's in the book
[1:02:30] would be him
[1:02:31] so if your name is in the book you're
[1:02:33] part of him
[1:02:35] because it's a record of him it's a
[1:02:37] record of christ it's the lamb's book of
[1:02:39] life
[1:02:40] and all that's in the book would be him
[1:02:43] but i know my name was in the book by
[1:02:45] revelation i know i was in the book
[1:02:47] then you're part of him because the book
[1:02:49] is him
[1:02:52] and it's all in the book would be him
[1:02:54] for that's the believer
[1:02:56] the words in the book and the word is
[1:02:59] him
[1:03:01] oh what's he trying to do god is
[1:03:04] revealing himself
[1:03:05] becoming material becoming detangle
[1:03:07] displaying himself in this earth
[1:03:11] and we each have a portion of that word
[1:03:14] to manifest
[1:03:17] john 1 1 we know it so well it says in
[1:03:19] the beginning was the word
[1:03:21] and the word was with god and the word
[1:03:23] was god
[1:03:25] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:03:31] were you part of that word
[1:03:34] then you were in the beginning with god
[1:03:38] were you in that book well that book is
[1:03:42] him
[1:03:44] what are the words in the book the
[1:03:46] believers
[1:03:47] but the book is him but the words in
[1:03:50] that are you and i
[1:03:52] i'm one of the names that were written
[1:03:53] there because i'm part
[1:03:55] of that life not not by my choosing but
[1:03:58] by his choosing amen
[1:04:00] by predestination
[1:04:04] brother says again and god is his own
[1:04:06] god is his own interpreter
[1:04:08] what i mean attributes was his thoughts
[1:04:12] and a word is a thought expressed and
[1:04:15] then
[1:04:16] then that was in his thinking and when
[1:04:19] he said let there be
[1:04:20] and there was let there be and there was
[1:04:23] and now remember you christians were in
[1:04:25] his thoughts before there was a world
[1:04:27] and you are the manifestation of his
[1:04:30] thinking
[1:04:30] before there was before there even was a
[1:04:33] world
[1:04:34] you were in christ amen in god
[1:04:37] in the beginning that makes you then you
[1:04:40] see his subjects
[1:04:41] and the whole thing is god himself
[1:04:44] materializing
[1:04:45] himself tangible so that he could be
[1:04:47] handled
[1:04:48] seen and so forth that's what god is
[1:04:51] the whole thing so now you realize by
[1:04:55] these things that i'm reading there's a
[1:04:56] point i'm reading all this
[1:04:57] is god wants to be manifest in this day
[1:05:00] he wants to be manifest in you
[1:05:01] amen and you're not coming to have
[1:05:03] church you're coming to hear the word of
[1:05:05] god
[1:05:06] so that revelation can produce a life
[1:05:08] and that life can be what he had in his
[1:05:10] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:05:12] and this revelation is the only thing
[1:05:13] that can produce that life
[1:05:15] because when the revelation comes then
[1:05:16] it's i in you you and me
[1:05:20] so what is god trying to do in you god
[1:05:23] is trying to reveal the mystery
[1:05:25] what mystery the mystery of the seventh
[1:05:27] seal he's trying to reveal it in you
[1:05:29] like he was trying to reveal it in
[1:05:31] christ like he's revealed it all the way
[1:05:32] through
[1:05:33] it's been revealing god god amen was
[1:05:36] alone with his thoughts amen
[1:05:38] but he didn't want to remain in that
[1:05:39] condition he wanted the fellowship with
[1:05:41] his thoughts
[1:05:42] so god was going to allow those thoughts
[1:05:44] to come and take tangible form
[1:05:46] what is it it's all god becoming
[1:05:48] tangible it's all god
[1:05:50] materializing himself where is he
[1:05:53] materializing himself
[1:05:54] by faith i say he's materializing
[1:05:56] himself right here by the revelation
[1:05:58] that has revealed it's him and me
[1:06:00] and me and him by his choosing
[1:06:04] and because of that revelation amen i
[1:06:07] want to know
[1:06:08] what that word says i want to know what
[1:06:10] to manifest
[1:06:13] because of that revelation i don't
[1:06:15] anymore want my own thoughts
[1:06:18] that's what the revelation has done for
[1:06:20] me the revelation it doesn't puff up
[1:06:23] it doesn't create a theologian it
[1:06:25] doesn't create a debater of the word
[1:06:28] but that true revelation of this mystery
[1:06:30] what it does is it created you such a
[1:06:32] hunger to know his word
[1:06:34] amen because i want to be a reflection
[1:06:36] of that word and i don't want anything
[1:06:38] to stand in between
[1:06:39] i want to surrender all god i want to
[1:06:41] lay it all down
[1:06:42] and you get on your knees and say god i
[1:06:45] can't do this by myself
[1:06:46] it has to be you and me you get down on
[1:06:49] your knees and say god forgive me lord
[1:06:51] forgive me for taking my own mind
[1:06:53] forgive me for having my own desires
[1:06:55] forgive me for constantly amen for
[1:06:58] fulfilling the desire of the flesh
[1:07:00] and not the desire of your word
[1:07:03] i mean it produces in you a desperation
[1:07:07] this revelation amen you can't walk
[1:07:10] around
[1:07:10] uh smug and hottie with your head in the
[1:07:13] air but you realize
[1:07:14] in yourself it is impossible to manifest
[1:07:17] what he's called me to manifest in this
[1:07:19] day
[1:07:20] i will do nothing but ruin it i'll do
[1:07:22] nothing but mess it up
[1:07:23] but i am totally dependent on him this
[1:07:26] revelation
[1:07:27] brings us into despair not despair but
[1:07:29] desperation
[1:07:31] for him to manifest himself it brings us
[1:07:34] into a position and that position
[1:07:36] brings us into an understanding that
[1:07:38] it's got to be in me but if it's going
[1:07:40] to be in me it's got to be him and me
[1:07:44] and now when i come to church i'm not
[1:07:46] coming to hear something
[1:07:48] amen so i could go and say that was a
[1:07:50] good service amen i'm coming to hear
[1:07:52] something
[1:07:52] from the nature of christ so that i know
[1:07:54] what i'm supposed to be reflecting in
[1:07:56] this life
[1:07:57] so that i can catch his nature so i can
[1:07:59] connect his life
[1:08:00] so i can get this character and then by
[1:08:02] feeding on that word
[1:08:04] as i take in the word and the revelation
[1:08:06] of the word i become
[1:08:07] one with the word and the word becomes
[1:08:09] to live out of me
[1:08:12] see this isn't something that's done by
[1:08:15] willpower
[1:08:18] it's done by holy ghost power
[1:08:22] but we feed on the word so that the word
[1:08:25] can produce its own life
[1:08:29] that's why we reject the things of the
[1:08:31] world because if we feed on the world
[1:08:33] amen they'll be a reflection of the
[1:08:35] world
[1:08:36] but the revelation listen i tell you
[1:08:41] you don't cut off the world because the
[1:08:43] preacher says cut off the world
[1:08:46] because that's a church life
[1:08:49] if the preacher says don't get caught up
[1:08:50] in social media and don't get caught up
[1:08:52] in the world
[1:08:52] you say well i better not get caught up
[1:08:53] with social media i better not get
[1:08:55] caught up in the world
[1:08:55] amen that's nothing more than coming
[1:08:58] trying to come to salvation by
[1:08:59] governments
[1:09:01] but what's the preacher trying to tell
[1:09:02] you the preacher is trying to tell you
[1:09:04] that you're going to reflect what you're
[1:09:06] looking at and if you've caught this
[1:09:07] revelation and you know what your
[1:09:09] position is
[1:09:09] and you know the manifestation is ours
[1:09:11] we ain't got time to fool around looking
[1:09:14] at the world
[1:09:14] amen this is the end time under the end
[1:09:16] time seal it's time to look at this word
[1:09:19] and begin to reflect what we're looking
[1:09:20] at
[1:09:21] [Music]
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:23] it has nothing to do with government has
[1:09:25] nothing to do with rules it has nothing
[1:09:27] to do with being a good believer
[1:09:29] so many people have been deceived
[1:09:31] because they're able to keep the rules
[1:09:32] of the church
[1:09:33] and be able to do it that's not it
[1:09:35] friends that is not it
[1:09:38] it is a life that you don't live it's a
[1:09:40] life he comes and lives through you
[1:09:45] but how are you going to do it when
[1:09:46] we're distracted
[1:09:48] what are you hungering for what are you
[1:09:51] thirsting for
[1:09:53] what are we why are we trying to fill it
[1:09:55] with things that don't fill the hunger
[1:09:57] what is it what is the seed of god what
[1:10:00] is the elect of god hungering for it's
[1:10:02] god trying to give you the revelation
[1:10:06] it's god trying to reveal himself to us
[1:10:10] amen we're not trying to stay away from
[1:10:13] social media
[1:10:14] so that we can say i'm a good message
[1:10:16] believer
[1:10:21] we're not interested in a church walk
[1:10:24] we're staying away from those things
[1:10:25] because they will not produce what i've
[1:10:27] been called to in this revelation
[1:10:30] because god has positioned me by this
[1:10:33] revelation
[1:10:34] and in that position i'm now a queen to
[1:10:36] the king
[1:10:37] my eye has to be focused on him i got to
[1:10:39] know what he wants and what he desires
[1:10:41] i'm supposed to be on this planet a
[1:10:43] reflection of jesus christ
[1:10:45] and if i can't find jesus christ there
[1:10:47] i'm not looking anymore because i've got
[1:10:49] to reflect what i'm looking
[1:10:50] at
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:55] it's not about getting doctrine right so
[1:10:59] we can say we're right
[1:11:04] it's about finishing the mystery it's
[1:11:07] god
[1:11:07] becoming tangible so it can be felt
[1:11:14] have you ever felt god have you ever
[1:11:17] washed a brother's feet
[1:11:20] have you ever washed a sister's feet
[1:11:23] this bride is becoming the flesh and
[1:11:26] bones of jesus christ
[1:11:29] by becoming one with him she is fleshing
[1:11:33] out jesus christ
[1:11:36] it's god completing the mystery
[1:11:41] he showed it all the way back in the
[1:11:43] beginning in genesis
[1:11:44] and he's been it fell and he's been
[1:11:46] working it all the way through
[1:11:49] to bring it back to the masterpiece
[1:11:51] family again
[1:11:54] and when we've been given the revelation
[1:11:56] our eyes have been opened and we see
[1:11:58] we've gone through the open door we've
[1:12:00] seen by revelation the heavenly
[1:12:02] dimension the plan of god from before
[1:12:04] the foundation of the world
[1:12:07] then all we want to do is surrender to
[1:12:09] him
[1:12:12] in the message choosing of a bride
[1:12:16] he's looking for her character
[1:12:20] the character of christ now just a
[1:12:23] moment now that's
[1:12:24] it he chooses a bride to reflect his
[1:12:26] character
[1:12:28] to which the modern churches of today
[1:12:30] certainly miss his program here a
[1:12:31] million miles
[1:12:32] because then they deny this being the
[1:12:34] truth so how
[1:12:36] could it be and he's looking for the and
[1:12:38] he's looking for the day
[1:12:40] for that bride to be formed hebrews 13
[1:12:43] 8.
[1:12:47] can i read that again
[1:12:50] he's looking for the day for that bride
[1:12:53] to be formed
[1:12:54] hebrews 13 8. what's hebrews 13
[1:12:57] 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:13:01] and forever amen
[1:13:04] what was it when adam amen was made
[1:13:07] flesh
[1:13:07] and adam was alone in the garden of eden
[1:13:10] it was adam
[1:13:11] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:14] but then god would pull out of adam a
[1:13:16] portion amen he would make a bride for
[1:13:18] adam
[1:13:19] amen and while adam was still asleep and
[1:13:21] this bride
[1:13:22] amen was now coming into manifestation
[1:13:24] what was it it was
[1:13:25] adam the same yesterday today
[1:13:31] then when adam amen was awakened and the
[1:13:33] two were united what was it it was still
[1:13:35] adam it was always adam
[1:13:40] and hebrews 13 8 is jesus christ the
[1:13:42] same yesterday
[1:13:43] today and forever amen wait he way back
[1:13:46] he said
[1:13:47] it was it was christ and moses it was
[1:13:49] christ and noah it was christ and david
[1:13:52] what was it it was jesus christ
[1:13:54] manifesting himself all the way through
[1:13:57] and now he's looking for the day
[1:14:01] for that bride to be formed hebrews 13 8
[1:14:05] just exactly like it was like he was
[1:14:08] it's got to be his same flesh same bone
[1:14:11] same spirit
[1:14:12] same everything just exactly built up
[1:14:15] and them to then become one
[1:14:17] until the church becomes that they're
[1:14:19] not
[1:14:20] one
[1:14:25] i was telling the church at brother
[1:14:28] isaiah's
[1:14:29] i said god is not looking for a
[1:14:31] part-time bride
[1:14:33] that i'm part-time i'm a bride sunday
[1:14:37] and i'm a bride wednesday but monday i
[1:14:39] may not be
[1:14:40] and tuesday i might slip and no he's
[1:14:43] looking for a full-time all the time
[1:14:44] bride
[1:14:45] this isn't a part-time position friends
[1:14:48] this is a full-time
[1:14:49] this is our whole life this isn't
[1:14:51] something this isn't something we
[1:14:52] believe
[1:14:54] everybody has something they believe
[1:14:56] amen this is something we live this is
[1:14:58] our life
[1:15:00] amen so many people have something they
[1:15:02] believe they have something they believe
[1:15:03] or they something they believe in
[1:15:05] they have a code of conduct that comes
[1:15:06] with what they believe in if they're
[1:15:08] catholics they believe
[1:15:09] the catholic faith and they have a
[1:15:11] certain code of conduct in a certain
[1:15:12] mode of operation
[1:15:13] if they're bad the same way if they're
[1:15:15] men and night it's another way this
[1:15:17] isn't a message way amen it's not that i
[1:15:19] believe
[1:15:19] a message i believe the message
[1:15:23] it's not a message way it's a jesus
[1:15:25] christ way it's jesus christ the same
[1:15:28] yesterday today
[1:15:29] and forever anything less we don't have
[1:15:31] the revelation yet
[1:15:36] he's looking for a full-time bride
[1:15:43] praise god
[1:15:48] he says in christ is the mystery of god
[1:15:51] revealed
[1:15:53] the only way you're saved is to know him
[1:15:55] by revelation
[1:15:57] praise god
[1:16:01] if i can take if i can take the
[1:16:02] presbyterian doctrine and tie you
[1:16:04] pentecostals tell you won't know
[1:16:06] you can take the baptist doctrine and
[1:16:08] show you pentecostals a million things
[1:16:09] that you know nothing of that's right
[1:16:11] but that's not it that's not his church
[1:16:14] that's not his church
[1:16:15] his church is himself revealed
[1:16:20] praise god what is this church it's not
[1:16:23] a set of doctrines
[1:16:26] it's not a certain mode of operation or
[1:16:30] a form of belief amen his church is
[1:16:33] himself believed
[1:16:35] revealed his church is himself revealed
[1:16:38] do you see it and expressed by the word
[1:16:41] itself that he is god see
[1:16:44] how can you say father son and holy
[1:16:45] ghost then and be baptized in it
[1:16:47] heathens right
[1:16:48] how can you say you know jesus christ he
[1:16:50] is the word when there's not a scripture
[1:16:51] in the bible there's not a place where
[1:16:53] anybody is ever baptized in the name of
[1:16:55] father son and holy ghost
[1:16:56] and you jesus only people just use the
[1:16:58] name of jesus for baptism
[1:17:00] i'm personally acquainted with four or
[1:17:01] five jesus and myself
[1:17:03] so you see what your denomination leads
[1:17:05] you into that's the darkness the
[1:17:07] expression of cain who brought fruits
[1:17:09] instead of the blood
[1:17:11] but the revelation come through the
[1:17:12] blood see through jesus christ
[1:17:14] who is the blood of god creative blood
[1:17:16] in the womb of mary
[1:17:18] and paul knew him by revelation that's
[1:17:20] how we know him today
[1:17:22] is the only way you can know him not say
[1:17:24] i'm methodist that means nothing i'm
[1:17:26] baptist that means nothing i'm catholic
[1:17:27] that means nothing
[1:17:28] but by the revelation that god has
[1:17:30] revealed the word to you
[1:17:32] he is the word and the word how you know
[1:17:35] it's revealed
[1:17:36] it lives itself and expresses his self
[1:17:39] through you how do you know the words
[1:17:43] revealed it live itself and expresses
[1:17:45] itself
[1:17:47] expresses his self
[1:17:50] through you the church
[1:17:53] is himself revealed
[1:17:59] he says in choosing of a bride again the
[1:18:02] kind of a woman that a man would choose
[1:18:04] will reflect his ambition
[1:18:06] and his character if a man chooses the
[1:18:09] wrong woman it reflects
[1:18:10] his character and what he ties himself
[1:18:13] to
[1:18:13] shows truly what's in him
[1:18:16] a woman who reflects what's in the a
[1:18:19] woman reflects what's in the man
[1:18:20] when he chooses her wife it shows what's
[1:18:23] down in him
[1:18:24] no matter what he says outside watch
[1:18:26] what he married
[1:18:29] and we know this is true because when
[1:18:32] brother branham
[1:18:33] chose when when god chose brother
[1:18:35] branham
[1:18:36] to be the prophet for this age
[1:18:40] he chose someone that would reflect his
[1:18:42] character
[1:18:44] and we could look at that life and say i
[1:18:47] saw
[1:18:47] jesus christ live through a human being
[1:18:51] is that right but that's the same thing
[1:18:54] he wants in you and i that wasn't just
[1:18:55] for the prophet
[1:18:56] remember the prophet was the forerunner
[1:18:59] he was for running his coming amen
[1:19:01] he was four running something but were
[1:19:03] to be the manifestation of what he was
[1:19:05] for running
[1:19:09] that life was not just for him
[1:19:12] we may not have the same gifts and we
[1:19:14] may not do all the same things
[1:19:16] brother branham said the whole camp
[1:19:18] didn't have to be moses they just had to
[1:19:19] believe in moses
[1:19:21] we don't all have to be the prophet of
[1:19:23] the age we don't have to do everything
[1:19:25] the prophet did but we have to believe
[1:19:26] in the prophet and have the same
[1:19:28] character that was in him because that
[1:19:30] wasn't the character of william branham
[1:19:32] william branham died that was the
[1:19:34] character of jesus christ
[1:19:37] that character we saw that would humble
[1:19:38] himself that would repent
[1:19:40] amen that would wait on the lord amen
[1:19:43] that would would obey the word
[1:19:45] amen that would stand and face rejection
[1:19:47] by proclaiming the word
[1:19:49] that was not the nature of william
[1:19:51] branham that man
[1:19:53] died that was the nature of jesus christ
[1:19:55] the resurrected seed that was in william
[1:19:57] branham
[1:19:59] [Music]
[1:20:02] the reality is god did not come to call
[1:20:06] you the way he thinks he came to call
[1:20:08] you
[1:20:08] he didn't come to call you just the name
[1:20:11] you have
[1:20:12] uh bob and larry and all that he come to
[1:20:15] call that seed that was in you
[1:20:17] that was meant to be you from the
[1:20:18] beginning
[1:20:20] what was it he was calling forth for
[1:20:22] himself
[1:20:24] because what life was in this see it was
[1:20:26] the life of god
[1:20:34] he says this is further and choosing of
[1:20:36] right i'm going to read a couple quotes
[1:20:38] here i'll choosing of a bride
[1:20:39] now for it's becoming if a christian
[1:20:41] would choose a wife he ought to choose a
[1:20:42] genuine born-again woman regardless
[1:20:45] of what she looks like it's what she is
[1:20:48] what makes her i say thank god for
[1:20:52] choosing me
[1:20:53] it wasn't what i looked like when he
[1:20:55] chose me but it's what i really was on
[1:20:57] the inside that he knew
[1:20:59] i didn't know it he knew it amen
[1:21:02] he was looking beyond my flesh when he
[1:21:05] called me
[1:21:05] he was looking beyond my flesh when he
[1:21:08] called the apostles he was
[1:21:09] the the apostles yeah he was looking
[1:21:11] beyond their flesh when he called his
[1:21:13] disciples because he looked at a
[1:21:14] fisherman a man
[1:21:15] and a fisherman who smelled like fish
[1:21:17] and was gruff around the edges but he
[1:21:19] saw more than that
[1:21:20] he saw more than a tax collector he saw
[1:21:22] more than just common man
[1:21:24] he was he was calling forth that seed
[1:21:26] that was on the inside
[1:21:32] it's what she is that makes her and then
[1:21:35] again that reflects his own
[1:21:37] godly character and reflects what's in
[1:21:38] his mind and what's going to be in the
[1:21:40] future for his
[1:21:41] family will be raised by such a woman
[1:21:44] for the future plans
[1:21:46] for his home brother bam says now
[1:21:49] still in choosing of a bride now here we
[1:21:52] see
[1:21:52] plainly the spiritual plan of god's
[1:21:54] planning for his future
[1:21:56] home with his future bride comes into
[1:21:58] view now
[1:21:59] what's he talking about choosing of a
[1:22:01] bride amen this is what
[1:22:03] brother ben's been talking about i got a
[1:22:05] chance to watch that sermon yesterday
[1:22:06] morning
[1:22:08] and i was upset with him because he
[1:22:11] ruined all my notes for tonight
[1:22:14] i sat down on the plane and was
[1:22:16] meditating on the trip back and and
[1:22:18] tuesday morning i sat down and wrote out
[1:22:19] a bunch of notes
[1:22:20] and then i turned on brother ben's
[1:22:22] sermon i started listening to it and he
[1:22:23] started
[1:22:24] ruining all of my notes
[1:22:27] but i say thank god it was a wonderful
[1:22:29] service
[1:22:31] but brother branham's saying now he's
[1:22:33] talking about choosing the bride he's
[1:22:34] typing this all out
[1:22:35] and i know the kind of woman a man
[1:22:37] chooses reflects the character that's on
[1:22:39] the inside of him
[1:22:40] so i don't care what he says he is looks
[1:22:41] what he marries it reflects what he's
[1:22:43] thinking in his mind
[1:22:45] of what he wants his future home to be
[1:22:48] listen pay attention friends
[1:22:49] brother baby now says now see plainly
[1:22:51] the spiritual plan of god's planning for
[1:22:53] his future home
[1:22:54] what's he doing god is showing his
[1:22:56] future home by who he's choosing
[1:22:58] and the character that's being reflected
[1:23:00] he's showing his future home
[1:23:02] because the future home doesn't have
[1:23:03] compromise the future home doesn't have
[1:23:05] sin in it the
[1:23:06] future home doesn't have lust of the
[1:23:07] world lust of the flesh pride of life
[1:23:09] that's not in the future home
[1:23:11] so he's calling a bride that will
[1:23:13] surrender those things and die out to
[1:23:14] that and he's showing his plan for the
[1:23:16] future home
[1:23:17] the future home will be the word and the
[1:23:19] word only that's why he's got to have a
[1:23:21] bride in this age that'll take the word
[1:23:23] and the word only not man's ideas she
[1:23:25] won't hybrid it with her own ideas
[1:23:27] but she'll take the mind of christ has
[1:23:29] been given and she'll stay with that in
[1:23:31] that only
[1:23:32] and what's he doing when he chooses a
[1:23:34] woman with that character he's
[1:23:35] reflecting his future plans for his
[1:23:37] future home
[1:23:44] in the feast of trumpets since the holy
[1:23:47] spirit has been bound by these
[1:23:49] denominational
[1:23:50] rivers for almost 2 000 years but it's
[1:23:52] to be loosed in the evening time
[1:23:55] by the evening time message the holy
[1:23:57] spirit back
[1:23:58] in the church again christ himself
[1:24:01] revealed in human flesh in the evening
[1:24:04] time
[1:24:06] that quote was not for william branham
[1:24:09] alone that quote was for
[1:24:13] all the bride every expressed attribute
[1:24:17] of god
[1:24:18] the holy spirit back in the church again
[1:24:21] christ
[1:24:22] himself revealed in human
[1:24:28] flesh
[1:24:30] that's what he wants to do under this
[1:24:32] end time seal
[1:24:34] and you and i it wants to be jesus
[1:24:37] christ
[1:24:38] revealed in human flesh
[1:24:46] see they're coming together it's uniting
[1:24:49] time
[1:24:50] sorry wrong quote the holy spirit back
[1:24:53] in the church again christ himself
[1:24:54] revealed in human flesh
[1:24:56] in the evening time he said he promised
[1:24:59] it
[1:25:00] now in jehovah jireh from 1964 he said
[1:25:02] he promised
[1:25:03] that he would appear in the last days in
[1:25:04] the form of human flesh again
[1:25:07] i'll be honest with you friends when i
[1:25:09] read that quote i used to be like yep i
[1:25:10] saw that brother brandon malachi 4.
[1:25:13] and every time i read that quote that's
[1:25:15] where my mind would go
[1:25:17] he promised that he would appear in the
[1:25:18] last days in the form of human flesh
[1:25:21] again
[1:25:22] and i would say oh yeah i saw that just
[1:25:25] like the plains of memory turn us back
[1:25:26] into certain
[1:25:27] thoughts that was part of it friends but
[1:25:29] that wasn't all of it
[1:25:31] that was certainly part of that and we
[1:25:33] certainly did see that
[1:25:34] and that was there to get the attention
[1:25:36] of the bride amen but not it wasn't for
[1:25:38] that manifestation and that vessel only
[1:25:41] but god wanted to do that in the entire
[1:25:43] bride
[1:25:45] and here i'm going to finish this
[1:25:46] sentence i haven't finished it yet he
[1:25:47] said he promised that he would appear in
[1:25:49] the last days
[1:25:50] in the form of human flesh again in your
[1:25:54] flesh brother brenda is not putting that
[1:25:56] all in him
[1:25:57] amen he's trying to show you amen
[1:25:59] there's been something waved over you to
[1:26:01] show that the life is back amen
[1:26:03] it's been bound for nearly 2 000 years
[1:26:05] but it's back
[1:26:06] in the church again and that part of the
[1:26:08] word has come to be waved over
[1:26:10] so you can see that it's possible to
[1:26:13] live a life of christ
[1:26:14] it's possible to overcome laodicea it's
[1:26:17] possible to believe the word
[1:26:23] even if you have to repent
[1:26:26] even if you don't always get it right
[1:26:28] it's possible to manifest christ
[1:26:34] in your flesh i'll read the sentence
[1:26:36] again because i keep stopping sorry
[1:26:38] he promised that he would appear in the
[1:26:40] last days in the form of human flesh
[1:26:41] again
[1:26:42] in your flesh like he did at the days of
[1:26:44] sodom
[1:26:46] wait a second wait a second
[1:26:52] wait a second did he just say what i
[1:26:55] thought he said
[1:26:59] he promised that he would appear in the
[1:27:01] last days in the form of human flesh
[1:27:02] again
[1:27:03] in your flesh oh i'm so glad he put that
[1:27:07] little phrase in there
[1:27:09] in your flesh like he did at the days
[1:27:12] of sodom what did he do in the days of
[1:27:16] sodom and sodom
[1:27:18] god come down in a body of flesh and
[1:27:21] presented himself to abraham
[1:27:24] he's saying he wants he wants
[1:27:28] to be in the form of human flesh again
[1:27:30] in your flesh
[1:27:32] like he did at the days of sodom
[1:27:36] i don't know how many times i've read
[1:27:38] that and said yep brother branham
[1:27:41] enmissed him saying in your flesh
[1:27:46] god which was christ manifest in the
[1:27:49] flesh
[1:27:50] now in his church his bride
[1:27:53] see brother doesn't want you to miss
[1:27:54] that he doesn't want you to miss it
[1:27:57] he's talking about a mini-membered bride
[1:27:59] a mini-membered body
[1:28:01] the flesh and bones of jesus christ
[1:28:04] see they're coming together it's a
[1:28:05] uniting time churches are uniting
[1:28:07] nations are uniting
[1:28:08] and the bride in christ is uniting see
[1:28:11] it's uniting time
[1:28:14] amen the prophet of god says in
[1:28:15] blasphemous names now then
[1:28:17] from this and then bringing this into
[1:28:19] the seven church ages god is building in
[1:28:21] seven church ages
[1:28:22] a bride for christ and then down in the
[1:28:26] unveiling of god
[1:28:27] in the in the unveiling of god he says
[1:28:29] like he was in moses
[1:28:31] when the word was in moses he was god in
[1:28:33] flesh
[1:28:36] when it was in jesus it was god in flesh
[1:28:40] see only thing he'd done was change his
[1:28:42] mask not his word
[1:28:43] not his nature he's the same yesterday
[1:28:46] today and forever
[1:28:47] what's that hebrews 13 8
[1:28:50] but i'm reading this to you friends and
[1:28:52] as i read it to you
[1:28:54] i think you know by now we're going to
[1:28:55] get to an interesting statement
[1:28:58] because like he was in moses when the
[1:29:00] word was in moses it was god in flesh
[1:29:02] amen i believe that when it was in jesus
[1:29:05] it was gone in flesh
[1:29:06] amen when it was in brother branham it
[1:29:08] was god in flesh amen just like it was
[1:29:10] in sodom but brother brendon already
[1:29:12] told us he wants to do the same thing in
[1:29:13] you
[1:29:18] amen jesus it was god in flesh
[1:29:21] only thing he'd done was change his mask
[1:29:23] not his word not his nature
[1:29:25] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:29:27] forever he only changed his form
[1:29:30] he changed from noah to moses
[1:29:35] the whole thing is god becoming tangible
[1:29:38] don't forget that statement the whole
[1:29:41] thing
[1:29:42] is the revelation of god it's the
[1:29:44] mystery of god finished it's god
[1:29:46] becoming tangible
[1:29:51] he moved he changed from noah to moses
[1:29:54] what was that god
[1:29:55] changing his mask he changed from moses
[1:29:59] to david
[1:30:01] from david to joseph on down until he
[1:30:03] came into the fullness of the godhead
[1:30:05] bodily
[1:30:06] see it's still the same god amen
[1:30:09] i hope that gets through see it's the
[1:30:11] same god but he just takes on another
[1:30:14] veil
[1:30:15] he puts on another veil what's he
[1:30:18] preaching
[1:30:18] the unveiling of god
[1:30:22] god was being unveiled all the way
[1:30:24] through the bible now at the end time
[1:30:26] he's going to take the veil away he did
[1:30:30] it in the reformers taking on a veil
[1:30:32] taking on a veil until finally it came
[1:30:34] down through lutheran age down through
[1:30:36] the other age then finally
[1:30:37] it comes out into the complete
[1:30:41] what is this age the complete what age
[1:30:44] have we come to
[1:30:45] the complete the complete image of one
[1:30:47] the complete image of the new testament
[1:30:49] and a bride that's standing upon the
[1:30:50] earth in the end time
[1:30:52] it's come to the complete what was it it
[1:30:55] was god unavail
[1:30:57] just before it comes a prophet arises
[1:31:00] again
[1:31:01] what it does it foreshadows the word
[1:31:05] what's that prophet doing he's a
[1:31:06] forerunner he's foreshadowing the word
[1:31:09] he's showing what's going to come
[1:31:13] show showing back there revealing what's
[1:31:15] been done what's been left off what the
[1:31:17] church will be
[1:31:18] that the church will not that the church
[1:31:20] will be not without understanding
[1:31:22] then when this fades out then like john
[1:31:25] said i must decrease
[1:31:27] he must increase then all in all comes
[1:31:29] into him
[1:31:32] amen just before amen
[1:31:35] god he was veiled through the reformers
[1:31:38] he was
[1:31:38] he was changing his mask from noah to
[1:31:41] moses moses to david david to joseph
[1:31:44] he's changing his mask all the way down
[1:31:45] through
[1:31:46] and he's been doing the same thing it's
[1:31:47] been gone and avail all the way through
[1:31:49] and now through the reformers through
[1:31:51] luther through the next stage and the
[1:31:52] next stage but he said
[1:31:54] now it comes into the complete the
[1:31:56] complete image of a bride the completion
[1:31:59] of the brine
[1:32:01] but just before that a prophet rises
[1:32:04] again
[1:32:05] and foreshadows the word and when this
[1:32:08] fades out
[1:32:10] said i must decrease and he must
[1:32:12] increase
[1:32:15] see brother branham was foreshadowing
[1:32:17] the coming word
[1:32:20] he was showing us what god wanted to do
[1:32:22] in the bride
[1:32:23] because brother branham was both the
[1:32:24] prophet that would forerun his coming
[1:32:26] but he was also part of the bride
[1:32:28] and he was manifesting the life of the
[1:32:30] bride he was both manifestations in one
[1:32:35] and when he faded out said i must
[1:32:37] decrease so that
[1:32:38] he can increase where is he going to
[1:32:40] increase he's
[1:32:41] increasing in the bride form
[1:32:46] see that prophet had to fade off the
[1:32:48] scene
[1:32:49] he had to go because he was here just to
[1:32:51] show
[1:32:52] amen he was here to show the potential
[1:32:54] he was here to show the life
[1:32:56] he was here to display amen the word on
[1:32:58] display
[1:32:59] but but if god couldn't keep it there
[1:33:02] because we would just keep waving the
[1:33:03] wave she'd been waving the way she'd
[1:33:05] been waving the wave she
[1:33:06] but it was to show amen that god was
[1:33:08] going to bring the
[1:33:09] whole field to harvest
[1:33:13] the whole field was coming to harvest
[1:33:14] maturity and it's not so that we can
[1:33:17] listen to a tape and mesmerize about how
[1:33:20] brother bannon made god real you should
[1:33:22] be making god real
[1:33:25] it wasn't just him to make god real it
[1:33:27] wasn't just him to make god tangible
[1:33:29] but it's you to make god tangible you
[1:33:32] should be making god real to your
[1:33:33] children real to your spouse
[1:33:35] real to the people at work god is
[1:33:37] becoming tangible
[1:33:38] so that he can be felt in you and i he
[1:33:40] wants to be manifest in flesh
[1:33:42] your flesh just like he did at sodom
[1:33:52] see we can give somebody a stack of
[1:33:55] books
[1:33:57] but i tell you unless they see a life in
[1:34:00] you there's no motivation for them to
[1:34:02] read the books
[1:34:02] but when they see in you a life that
[1:34:04] matches jesus christ
[1:34:06] there's something in you god becoming
[1:34:07] tangible and they say where did you get
[1:34:09] this
[1:34:10] and you're different than everybody else
[1:34:11] you say well i read these books they
[1:34:12] said let me read that book too because i
[1:34:14] want what you got
[1:34:17] amen that's why we don't just fly planes
[1:34:20] a bit all over the world and throw out
[1:34:22] message books
[1:34:26] is that right because life comes when
[1:34:29] life makes contact
[1:34:32] there's a display of life
[1:34:35] when there's a display of life when
[1:34:37] there's a display when god becomes
[1:34:39] tangible
[1:34:40] then the god seed gets attracted to the
[1:34:42] tangible god
[1:34:44] that's the way it's been in every age
[1:34:49] let's look at colossians chapter one as
[1:34:52] we wrap up
[1:34:55] i say wrap up so you'll stay with me for
[1:34:57] a few minutes
[1:34:59] pay close attention now we really are
[1:35:01] we're down to the finish
[1:35:04] i think colossians chapter 1
[1:35:09] verse 25 where if i am made a minister
[1:35:13] according to the dispensation of god
[1:35:15] which is given to me for you
[1:35:17] to fulfill the word of god even the
[1:35:20] mystery which had been hid from ages and
[1:35:22] from generations
[1:35:24] but now is made manifest to his saints
[1:35:27] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:35:29] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:35:31] among the gentiles
[1:35:32] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:35:38] not christ and brother branham
[1:35:41] was christ there absolutely was it
[1:35:44] beneficial yes did i need it yes
[1:35:46] but this mystery friends is christ in
[1:35:49] you
[1:35:50] the hope of glory it has to be personal
[1:35:53] it has to be real
[1:35:55] it has to be alive it has to be
[1:35:57] something that's leading you something
[1:35:58] that
[1:35:59] that's taking over you there has to be
[1:36:01] something in you that's laying down so
[1:36:02] that they can live
[1:36:05] a desire to get out of the way
[1:36:09] so that god can manifest himself
[1:36:14] i'm going to read this last quote as i
[1:36:16] read this musicians you can come on up
[1:36:18] and brother ben you can come
[1:36:21] listen to this final quote god's
[1:36:24] provided place of worship
[1:36:26] 1965 but he promised just before the
[1:36:28] coming of the end time
[1:36:30] the world would would get like it was in
[1:36:32] sodom when a man come down in human form
[1:36:35] three of them two angels and god himself
[1:36:37] that was god the bible said it was now
[1:36:40] he come down and manifested himself
[1:36:42] there by turning his back to the tent
[1:36:43] where sarah was
[1:36:45] and told abraham what sarah was thinking
[1:36:47] in the tent
[1:36:48] that's right now jesus himself said at
[1:36:50] that day when the son of man is being
[1:36:52] revealed
[1:36:53] in other words the son of man the
[1:36:55] ministry of jesus christ
[1:36:57] himself the church will come through
[1:37:01] justification through luther through
[1:37:02] sanctification through wesley
[1:37:04] through the baptism of the holy ghost or
[1:37:06] the pentecostals and go
[1:37:08] right on into the perfection of the son
[1:37:10] of man
[1:37:11] that when husband and wife will be the
[1:37:14] self
[1:37:14] the same self persons
[1:37:20] he trying to do he's trying to take it
[1:37:21] back to the condition they were in eden
[1:37:25] where he called their name adam
[1:37:28] where they were one flesh whatever adam
[1:37:31] was
[1:37:31] the woman was whatever the woman was
[1:37:34] adam was they come from the same source
[1:37:36] they were made out of the same
[1:37:37] ingredients amen they were sharing the
[1:37:39] same life
[1:37:44] coming right on into the perfection of
[1:37:46] the son of man that when husband and
[1:37:47] wife
[1:37:48] will be the same self persons
[1:37:53] god will be so manifest into his bride
[1:37:55] his church till they will both
[1:37:57] be the same they are one now
[1:38:00] you see where we're at
[1:38:04] now you see what the opening of the
[1:38:05] seals was to do now you see
[1:38:07] what the opening of the seventh seal was
[1:38:09] to do now you see where we're at
[1:38:11] where are we at we're not in laodicea no
[1:38:14] we're not there
[1:38:14] we are we are supposed to be caught up
[1:38:17] here into the mind of god
[1:38:20] by a revelation that will bring a
[1:38:23] manifestation
[1:38:25] and what is the manifestation it's the
[1:38:28] character of jesus christ on display
[1:38:31] in you and me
[1:38:34] god becoming tangible
[1:38:39] we can't surrender ourselves enough
[1:38:43] we can't give up enough friends it's not
[1:38:46] what you do
[1:38:47] it's what you surrender yourself to
[1:38:50] it's not your power it's his power it's
[1:38:52] not your will it's his will
[1:38:54] it's not what we do it's what he does
[1:38:57] through us
[1:38:59] it's not what we work ourselves up to
[1:39:00] it's what he has brought to us
[1:39:02] it's not what we accomplish is what he
[1:39:04] accomplishes but how will he do it
[1:39:06] he'll do it when we surrender to him and
[1:39:09] say not my will
[1:39:11] but thy will be done i see this is what
[1:39:14] you're calling for
[1:39:15] i see this is the day this is the hour
[1:39:18] when it's got to be you and me and i
[1:39:19] and you lord let nothing stand in the
[1:39:22] way
[1:39:23] let nothing hinder let me not be
[1:39:27] satisfied
[1:39:28] with a good service with a good church
[1:39:31] with a
[1:39:31] good set of rules and a good doctrine
[1:39:33] and the ability to keep them
[1:39:34] that's not it friends that's not this
[1:39:37] hour there was church ages where those
[1:39:39] things were acceptable it's not
[1:39:40] acceptable anymore
[1:39:42] this isn't the age for a church walk in
[1:39:44] a church life and
[1:39:46] and and i have a belief it's not a
[1:39:48] belief it's a life
[1:39:51] and it's time for the manifestation of
[1:39:53] that life
[1:39:55] in bright form
[1:39:58] and god knows just how
[1:40:01] to get the life out
[1:40:05] and i say all i want to do
[1:40:09] is surrender to this word that i'm
[1:40:10] hearing
[1:40:12] and all i want to do is flesh out what
[1:40:14] he's brought our way
[1:40:16] i've seen it i've seen it lifted up and
[1:40:19] i've seen it waved
[1:40:20] and i know that that wasn't weighed
[1:40:23] before me
[1:40:23] as an unattainable goal
[1:40:27] that life wasn't way before me as as
[1:40:29] look at here
[1:40:30] don't you wish you could be like this
[1:40:32] don't you wish you could do this that's
[1:40:33] not why god did that in our day friends
[1:40:35] that's not why he called the prophet
[1:40:36] that's not why he lifted him up
[1:40:38] amen what did he do he was showing us
[1:40:41] this is what you're supposed to be
[1:40:42] amen this is what i've called you for in
[1:40:44] this day this is your potential this is
[1:40:46] what you're growing to
[1:40:47] this is your destination
[1:40:50] and i say god that's what i want my
[1:40:52] destination to be
[1:40:53] i want to look like you i want to talk
[1:40:55] like you i want to act like you
[1:40:57] i want it to be you in this tabernacle
[1:41:00] of clay
[1:41:01] and i don't want it to be anything else
[1:41:02] i want to die i want to surrender
[1:41:04] i want to lay my life down and i want it
[1:41:06] to be you oh god
[1:41:08] i'm not looking at that life and saying
[1:41:10] wow look at the prophet
[1:41:12] i appreciate that life it meant so much
[1:41:14] to me
[1:41:15] but i'm looking at that and saying
[1:41:16] that's where i'm going that's the target
[1:41:19] that's my destination
[1:41:22] and i may not be there yet but i know by
[1:41:24] the grace of the god i'm walking on the
[1:41:26] path that leads there
[1:41:28] i know that he's lifting this bride up
[1:41:30] word by word
[1:41:32] she's coming into her position
[1:41:35] to manifest all that god wants her to
[1:41:37] manifest
[1:41:39] in this life i say
[1:41:43] it's the only thing we want let's all
[1:41:46] stand
[1:41:48] i know it's the only thing you want it's
[1:41:50] the only thing i want
[1:41:52] the devil he he still brings so many
[1:41:55] distractions and so many
[1:41:57] glittering flashing things to draw our
[1:42:01] attention and
[1:42:02] bring a distraction and then he'll try
[1:42:04] to bring
[1:42:05] troubles and and troubles are only meant
[1:42:07] to bring the life of christ
[1:42:08] out but he tries to bring troubles and
[1:42:10] cause us to be distracted by trouble
[1:42:12] don't be distracted by troubles
[1:42:15] troubles are here to bring the character
[1:42:16] of christ out of our lives
[1:42:20] amen don't don't don't it's not time to
[1:42:23] be distracted and
[1:42:25] it's not time to be influenced by
[1:42:27] anything other than the word
[1:42:32] but this is time for the manifestation
[1:42:37] of god this is the end time
[1:42:40] seal that's been opened god revealing to
[1:42:44] us
[1:42:45] what it is supposed to look like in this
[1:42:47] day and what the bride is supposed to be
[1:42:50] and he's done that revelation he's given
[1:42:52] us that revelation
[1:42:54] so that it can produce a life
[1:42:57] and i say god i want that life in me
[1:43:01] i know it's there lord i know it by
[1:43:04] faith i know it by a new birth
[1:43:05] experience
[1:43:06] i know it's there but oh god let it come
[1:43:08] out amen
[1:43:10] help me to surrender more is that your
[1:43:12] prayer is that your desire
[1:43:14] that you can just surrender more and all
[1:43:16] of this word can come out
[1:43:17] and he can become the tangible god
[1:43:20] so that somebody will say amen i saw god
[1:43:24] in that vessel of clay right there
[1:43:27] that man that woman that they made
[1:43:30] god real to me that he wasn't in a book
[1:43:33] amen
[1:43:34] he wasn't a historical god he wasn't a
[1:43:36] story
[1:43:37] that i heard in sunday school but i met
[1:43:40] somebody
[1:43:40] that made god real to me i said god let
[1:43:44] me be that
[1:43:45] that's my desire god i want to be
[1:43:48] the tangible god on this earth let's bow
[1:43:52] our heads friends and pray
[1:43:54] dear god we thank you for this word
[1:43:57] lord god you're so amazing how you have
[1:44:01] kept a mystery hidden through the whole
[1:44:03] bible
[1:44:04] it's there lord it's there all through
[1:44:07] the bible this mystery
[1:44:10] but you were able to keep it under cover
[1:44:11] lord
[1:44:13] because you didn't want it to be
[1:44:14] revealed to the end time
[1:44:16] you didn't want the enemy to play with
[1:44:18] it
[1:44:20] lord so you kept it hidden
[1:44:23] but oh what grace you showed upon us
[1:44:26] that at the end time
[1:44:27] you would peel back the seals and let us
[1:44:30] see what this mystery has been
[1:44:34] god you've done it for a purpose and i
[1:44:37] pray that purpose will be realized in my
[1:44:39] life
[1:44:41] there's many here who've raised their
[1:44:43] hands lord and now they're raising their
[1:44:44] hearts to you saying lord
[1:44:46] let the purpose of that revelation be
[1:44:49] realized in me
[1:44:51] for i'm here giving you a fresh
[1:44:53] consecration
[1:44:55] surrendering myself a new lord let all
[1:44:58] the distractions fade away out of my
[1:45:00] life and let me be singularly focused on
[1:45:02] you
[1:45:03] you're my headship you're my life
[1:45:06] you're my all-in-all god i surrender to
[1:45:10] you a fresh lord
[1:45:12] god live your life through this
[1:45:14] tabernacle
[1:45:16] but i saw what you did in the prophet
[1:45:19] when he surrendered when he died to
[1:45:20] himself i saw what you were able to do
[1:45:23] in a body of clay and i know god that if
[1:45:27] i can surrender
[1:45:29] you'll use me for the purpose that you
[1:45:31] put me on this planet
[1:45:34] god may i be a reflection of your life
[1:45:36] lord jesus
[1:45:39] god let me not be of a bad character
[1:45:42] because i'm i'm portraying a bad
[1:45:44] reflection of christ
[1:45:47] but lord let me clean the glass
[1:45:50] let me wash the mirror with your word
[1:45:54] that i might give a pure reflection of
[1:45:56] your life
[1:45:57] that others can look at this life and
[1:45:59] they can see there's god
[1:46:01] there's a real true and living god
[1:46:05] god i pray that you use us for your
[1:46:06] glory that you wash us and cleanse
[1:46:10] position us mourn and use us for your
[1:46:13] purpose
[1:46:15] we give ourselves to you god and we
[1:46:17] thank you for all you've done for us
[1:46:19] bless us lord we commit ourselves unto
[1:46:22] you and trust in you to do

[1:49:54] of
[1:50:00] so thankful for a wave chief in our day
[1:50:03] friends
[1:50:04] that i can look at and say that's what
[1:50:08] it looks like to be a son of god
[1:50:11] you know brother branham's wife
[1:50:14] she was the one on the end of that phone
[1:50:16] that had to lie for him
[1:50:20] and she saw his mistake firsthand and
[1:50:23] she even asked
[1:50:24] him is that exactly right
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:27] she knew it wasn't right he went and
[1:50:30] repented
[1:50:31] but you know i don't think she would say
[1:50:32] anything else that i saw the life of god
[1:50:34] in that man you know
[1:50:38] that's the life that we can live friends
[1:50:41] your children
[1:50:42] your wife they'll see you make mistakes
[1:50:45] but what makes it the life of god and
[1:50:48] them is in you is when you come back and
[1:50:50] say that was wrong it wasn't according
[1:50:51] to the word will you forgive me i want
[1:50:53] to make that right
[1:50:54] i don't think sister media would have
[1:50:56] ever said i thought he lived a pretty
[1:50:58] good life
[1:50:59] i thought he was like christ but he made
[1:51:01] that mistake and
[1:51:02] i just don't think that was christ in
[1:51:04] him
[1:51:06] no she knew it was it proved it was it
[1:51:09] proved that that was god in that man
[1:51:12] when he come and he told his church i
[1:51:15] had a plan i was going to run to alaska
[1:51:18] i was going to trick my wife
[1:51:21] nobody in that church was saying well i
[1:51:23] thought he was the messenger
[1:51:25] i thought he was the son of god i
[1:51:27] thought that was god working that man
[1:51:28] but i've got my doubts now
[1:51:31] no the the way god dealt with him proved
[1:51:34] that it was god in that man
[1:51:37] oh i'm so glad we can be real christians
[1:51:39] not fake christians real christian
[1:51:42] we don't have to be plastic and pretend
[1:51:44] and put on a face at church
[1:51:45] and pretend in front of people amen no
[1:51:48] we can be a real christian and say what
[1:51:50] i just did was not christ it was wrong
[1:51:52] forgive me
[1:51:53] i want to be subject to this word and if
[1:51:55] you live that way friends i don't
[1:51:57] believe anybody's going to be like well
[1:51:58] i thought he was a christian i thought
[1:52:00] god lived in it they're gonna know
[1:52:02] that it's god in you because it's god
[1:52:03] that's bringing you subject to his word
[1:52:07] it is god that you're surrendering to so
[1:52:10] that he can be made manifest
[1:52:12] don't be afraid to be a real christian
[1:52:16] just be a real christian all the time
[1:52:19] if you fail say that you failed
[1:52:22] and say god is correcting me so that i
[1:52:26] can be right
[1:52:27] [Music]
[1:52:28] and no none of us i'm not gonna look at
[1:52:30] you and say well
[1:52:32] i thought they were probably bride but
[1:52:33] i'm not so sure enough i'm gonna say
[1:52:35] that's how the bride acts
