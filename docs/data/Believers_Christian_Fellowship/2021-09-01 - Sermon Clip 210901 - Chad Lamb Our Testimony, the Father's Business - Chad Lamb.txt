TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but you're this and you're that that's not what's laying under the seals for me mr devil but you're this and you were born of that and you've always done that but that's not what was revealed under the mystery to me amen when the seals opened to me i saw my name in the book i heard my name called i recognized i was part of this mystery from before the foundation of the world and you say i'm a washout you say i'm a hypocrite you say i'm no good you say i'm defeated but i say i'm part of this mystery my revelation i can no more be lost and god can be lost because i was with him before the foundation of the world i've come from god i'm going to god by a revelation that was laying under the seals for me [Applause] i tell you that's the testimony that will bring him down friends that and that alone is the revelation in the testimony of the bride that will cast him down not saying i was sick and now i'm healed the pentecostals can do that there's got to be something more amen something when brother branham came to the seals in 1963 he says what we got now he had a restoration of the gifts had a tying together of loose sins had an explanation of the church ages but there's got to be a deeper mystery to bring you rapturing faith so that you can fly above all these denominations and fly above all of this to where you can get into the real revelation above amnesia above all of this stuff so you can fly so high you can say i remember where i came from [Music] but you're that no no no no no that was on my birth certificate that's just flesh that's not who i am do you remember when you did this and you remember when you did that remember when you said that oh you say but that's now i've been washed by the water of the word all the filth and everything's been washed away from me i've been redeemed amen the redeemer has come he's not still back there redeeming now he's here claiming and i'm part of what he claimed [Music] he was there redeeming redeeming through seven churches redeeming but when he's done redeeming in the last church ages now he steps forth to take the book and claim what he's redeemed now it's the claiming ministry and guess who he claimed mr devil he claimed me not by what i've done or not done but by a revelation that came at the opening of those seals
