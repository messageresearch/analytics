[10:01] with bleeding

[10:08] All is
[10:14] great.
[10:21] In their head
[10:27] began to see

[11:44] Oh, won't you come inside?

[11:59] ever
[12:01] to
[12:05] I
[12:14] wide every door.
[12:19] Won't you come beside
[12:24] you, Lord? I need you more and more.
[12:33] Lord, my heart is open.
[12:40] Oh, you come inside.
[12:46] Fill up all my being
[12:53] ever
[12:55] to abide.
[12:59] I've opened
[13:01] all the windows.
[13:06] I've thrown wide every door.
[13:13] Oh, to come inside
[13:18] you, Lord. I need you more
[13:23] and more.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this evening. Let's
[13:28] bow our heads together.
[13:30] Dear Lord Jesus, we're once again so
[13:32] grateful to be gathered together. Lord,
[13:35] by your grace, Lord, in our lives, by
[13:37] your mercy, you've extended to us that
[13:39] you've drawn us together once more. And
[13:42] God, as we now turn our attention to
[13:44] your word, I pray that you would come on
[13:46] the scene, that you would take control
[13:48] of this gift that's in my life, Lord,
[13:50] and you would use me for your glory and
[13:52] break the bread of life to us and feed
[13:54] us from your abundance, Lord. May you
[13:57] give us the bread that we have need of,
[13:59] Lord, this evening. Strengthen us, Lord,
[14:01] by the word. Equip us, anoint us,
[14:04] inspire us, and send us forth, Lord, as
[14:06] bright lights in this world as as your
[14:09] representation here on earth. pray we go
[14:11] in strength because of the food that you
[14:13] feed us. We ask your blessing over all
[14:15] that's said and done this evening. In
[14:17] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[14:21] Amen. God bless you. It's certainly good
[14:23] to be together. If you could take your
[14:25] Bibles and turn with me to Amos. Let's
[14:27] start in the book of Amos. Amen. I just
[14:29] want to say how much I appreciate
[14:30] brother Josiah sing leading songs again
[14:32] tonight. I'm glad he started helping us
[14:35] out. It's nice to see the gift begin to
[14:37] manifest in different ones. We
[14:39] appreciate that.
[14:40] Amen. Amos 8 and verse 11.
[14:46] Amos chapter 8.
[14:49] We'll turn there. Give you just a
[14:51] minute.
[14:52] Amos 8 and 11.
[14:55] Behold, the days come, sayeth the Lord
[14:57] God, that I will send a famine in the
[14:59] land. Not a famine of bread, nor a
[15:02] thirst for water, but of hearing the
[15:05] words of the Lord.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Verse 12. And they shall wander from sea
[15:09] to sea and from the north even to the
[15:11] east. They shall run to and fro to seek
[15:14] the word of the Lord and shall not find
[15:16] it. Amen. May God bless you all as you
[15:19] have your seats. May God bless us as we
[15:21] look at his word. Amen. May he give us
[15:23] eyes to see and ears to hear. Amen.
[15:27] Amen. Uh if we could pull up the
[15:29] PowerPoint, please. I want to go ahead
[15:31] and go right to my PowerPoint. I want to
[15:33] speak on food in the time of spiritual
[15:35] famine. Amen. And uh uh I ministered a
[15:38] little bit on this pretty much this
[15:40] topic, but I want to maybe take a few
[15:42] different points when I was down in
[15:43] Junction City. So, brother John and
[15:46] Sister Jill, sorry you have to hear it
[15:47] again. So, you know where to Amen,
[15:49] though. So, you're already ready. Amen.
[15:51] But, but I just wanted to share it. It
[15:53] was on my heart to share it. And some
[15:54] more things unfolded. Amen. So, I I want
[15:57] to I want to look at this food in the
[15:58] time of spiritual famine. Brother Venom
[16:00] showed us that we are in the time of
[16:02] spiritual famine. Amen. In the Leodysian
[16:05] age, there's apostasy. There's a
[16:06] blackout through the churches. Amen.
[16:08] There's an absolute famine in the land.
[16:10] Amen. But but he promised us food in the
[16:14] time of famine.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; So, we're so thankful for that. In
[16:17] Matthew 4:1, he says, "Then was Jesus
[16:20] led up of the spirit into the wilderness
[16:23] to be tempted of the devil. And when he
[16:24] had fasted 40 days and 40 nights, he was
[16:27] afterward hungered. And when the tempter
[16:30] came to him, he said, "If thou be the
[16:32] son of God, command that these stones be
[16:34] made bread." But he answered and said,
[16:36] "It is written, man shall not live by
[16:38] bread alone, but by every word that
[16:41] proceedth out of the mouth of God." So
[16:44] what does man live by? The word of God.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; That's what we live by. Amen. Turn with
[16:49] me to John chapter 6. We're going to do
[16:52] some reading here in John 6.
[16:58] John chapter 6 and we'll begin at verse
[17:01] 30.
[17:07] All right. John 6 and verse 30.
[17:11] They said therefore unto him, "What sign
[17:14] showest thou then, that we may see and
[17:16] believe thee? What dust thou work? Our
[17:19] fathers did eat mana in the desert, as
[17:21] it is written, he gave them bread from
[17:23] heaven to eat." Amen. If you just read
[17:26] previously in the chapter, Amen. Jesus
[17:28] had fed the 5000 by breaking the loaves
[17:30] and the fishes. and he had crossed the
[17:32] sea and many recognized he was gone and
[17:35] they followed him over and then they
[17:36] started asking for another miracle and
[17:38] he says you didn't follow me because you
[17:39] saw the miracle you follow me because
[17:41] you ate the bread
[17:42] &gt;&gt; and and you want to eat more bread.
[17:44] Amen. Is what he's telling them. Then
[17:46] then he tells them in verse 27, "Labor
[17:49] not for the meat which perisheth, but
[17:51] for the meat which endureth unto
[17:53] everlasting life, which the son of man
[17:55] shall give unto you, for him hath the
[17:57] father sealed." He says, "Quit seeking
[18:00] after temporary bread." Amen. He He by a
[18:03] miracle broke bread and broke fish and
[18:06] he fed 5,000 and they ate till they were
[18:08] full and then they gathered up the
[18:10] fragments thereof. But that meal had
[18:13] already wore off.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "Quit seeking after
[18:17] and laboring for that meat which
[18:19] perisheth, but for the meat, amen, which
[18:22] endureth unto everlasting life, which
[18:23] the Son of Man shall give unto you." So
[18:26] then just a little bit later then they
[18:28] start asking him what work do you do and
[18:30] they're taunting him about more bread
[18:33] about mana from heaven about showing a
[18:35] sign and working a miracle and bread
[18:37] from heaven
[18:38] and verse 32 then Jesus said unto them
[18:41] verily verily I say unto you Moses gave
[18:43] you not that bread from heaven but my
[18:46] father giveth you the true bread from
[18:48] heaven for the bread of God is he which
[18:51] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[18:54] unto the world. Then said they unto him,
[18:56] "Lord, ever more give us this bread." So
[18:59] stop there for a minute. He says, "What
[19:01] Moses gave you wasn't true bread."
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; But they ate it. It was mana. It was
[19:06] true. They ate it. It sustained them in
[19:07] the journey. But it was a type. It was a
[19:10] foreshadow of another bread. Amen. And
[19:13] now he said, "The true bread of God is
[19:15] he
[19:16] &gt;&gt; which cometh down from heaven and giveth
[19:18] life unto the world." Then said they
[19:20] unto him, Lord, evermore give us this
[19:22] bread. And Jesus said unto them, I am
[19:26] the bread of life. He that cometh to me
[19:28] shall never hunger. He that believeth on
[19:30] me shall never thirst. So he says, now
[19:34] there's a true bread is he that came
[19:36] down to give life. And they say, oh, we
[19:38] we want that now. Give us that. And he
[19:40] says, I am that.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am that. And they're expecting
[19:45] more of something to put into their
[19:48] mouth.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; They're looking for more of a miracle of
[19:50] a sign like they just had eaten from.
[19:52] and then talking about Moses and that
[19:54] was something they put into their mouth
[19:56] and now he's saying there's a true bread
[19:57] coming. Amen. Well, we want that bread
[19:59] and he says I am that bread and they're
[20:01] trying to figure out how do I put that
[20:03] in my mouth?
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're stuck in carnality. Amen.
[20:08] And he's speaking spiritually. Let's go
[20:10] over to verse 48.
[20:13] I am that bread of life. Your fathers
[20:15] did eat mana in the wilderness and are
[20:17] dead. What's he saying to them? the
[20:20] miracle, the sign, the natural, the
[20:22] physical. Although it was a miracle and
[20:24] all it was from God and although it gave
[20:26] you natural life and sustained you in
[20:28] the journey, they're dead.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; So, you don't want THAT BREAD. YOU'VE
[20:33] GOT to have a different kind of bread.
[20:35] Not the bread that you eat and die, but
[20:37] the bread that you eat and live.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. This verse 50, this is the bread
[20:44] which cometh down from heaven, that a
[20:46] man may eat thereof and not die. I am
[20:50] the living bread which came down from
[20:52] heaven. If any man eat of this bread, he
[20:55] shall live forever. And the bread that I
[20:57] will give is my flesh, which I will give
[21:00] for the life of the world. All of a
[21:02] sudden, all of a sudden, they're all
[21:04] locked up now because they're looking
[21:06] for bread, mana, uh loaves, and fishes.
[21:08] They're looking for bread, something
[21:10] natural. And now he's telling them, "I
[21:12] am the bread that came down from
[21:14] heaven." Amen. You ate that bread and
[21:16] died, but you eat this bread and you'll
[21:17] live. I'm that bread and the bread that
[21:20] I give you is my flesh. And they're
[21:22] still thinking about something they put
[21:24] in their mouth.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; And then they get all confused and they
[21:29] get bothered and they get offended
[21:32] &gt;&gt; and they're wondering how that that
[21:35] we're going to eat his fle how are we
[21:36] going to take this bread? And he says
[21:38] I'm the bread and my flesh is the bread.
[21:41] And the question is what is his flesh?
[21:44] How is his flesh bread? He says the fle
[21:47] He says the bread that I'll give you is
[21:49] my flesh.
[21:51] Right? I'm going to read this again. The
[21:55] bread that I will give is my flesh which
[21:57] I will give for the life of the world.
[22:02] John 1:1 In the beginning was the word
[22:05] and the word was with God
[22:07] &gt;&gt; and the word was God.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; 14 and the word was made flesh.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus says, "The the bread
[22:16] that I'm going to give you is my flesh."
[22:19] What is his flesh? His flesh is the
[22:22] word.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; His flesh is the word that has come into
[22:25] manifestation. The living word for the
[22:27] hour in which they live, the manifested
[22:30] promise of God. That's what his flesh
[22:32] was. His flesh was the word for the
[22:33] hour. His flesh was the promise for that
[22:36] day. His flesh was the word made
[22:38] manifest standing right in front of
[22:39] them. And I said, "This is what you HAVE
[22:42] TO EAT." HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT TAKING
[22:44] THEIR mers and grinding down on his
[22:46] fingertips and his flesh and his senue.
[22:48] They're talking about receiving this
[22:50] manifestation, RECEIVING THE WORD MADE
[22:52] FLESH IN FRONT OF YOU. THAT'S HOW YOU
[22:54] EAT ME BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN THE WORD HAS
[22:57] BEEN MADE FLESH AND I'M GIVING MY FLESH,
[23:00] THE WORD MADE FLESH FOR THE LIFE OF THE
[23:02] WHOLE WORLD. AND IF YOU EAT THIS BREAD,
[23:04] THE WORD, THE THOUGHT OF GOD COMING INTO
[23:06] MANIFESTATION, IF YOU EAT THAT BREAD,
[23:08] YOU'LL LIVE FOREVER.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[23:14] I want to eat that bread.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; I want to eat that bread. And and if if
[23:20] you could eat it that day, we can eat it
[23:23] this day.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 52. Now
[23:28] the Jews therefore strove among
[23:29] themselves, saying, "How can this man
[23:31] give us his flesh to eat?"
[23:34] Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[23:37] verily, I say unto you, except you eat
[23:39] the flesh of the Son of Man and drink
[23:42] his blood, you have no life in you. Who
[23:45] so eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my
[23:48] blood hath eternal life, and I will
[23:50] raise him up at the last day. For my
[23:53] flesh is meat indeed." Oh, I love this.
[23:58] And my blood is drink indeed. You know
[24:01] what he's saying? You can eat my flesh.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; And you can drink my blood.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; He's not talking about material natural.
[24:12] He's talking about the word made
[24:14] manifest.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; You can receive it. You can eat it. You
[24:19] can receive it. You can partake of it.
[24:22] You can receive it into yourself. You
[24:24] can become one with it.
[24:27] He says, "My flesh is meat indeed." I
[24:29] want to read this again. Verse 55. and
[24:30] my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth
[24:33] my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood
[24:35] dwelleth in me and I in him.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; As the living Father has sent me, and I
[24:41] live by the Father, so he that eateth
[24:43] me, even he shall live by me. This is
[24:46] that bread which came down from heaven,
[24:49] not as your fathers did eat mana and are
[24:51] dead. He that eateth of this bread shall
[24:54] live forever.
[24:56] I love these kind of dialogues that
[24:57] Jesus had because you can imagine for
[25:00] us, we've heard this all all the time
[25:02] that you've been in Christianity, you've
[25:04] heard this. But if you heard this for
[25:06] the very first time, being a Jew, Amen.
[25:08] And you were taught by the law of Moses
[25:10] that cannibalism was wrong and you're
[25:12] not even to take the blood of animals,
[25:14] how are you going to drink the blood of
[25:15] a man?
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND THEY'RE ALL TWISTED UP IN
[25:19] THEIR MIND. AND BUT they're not
[25:21] recognizing who's standing in front of
[25:22] him and what it is. This is the very
[25:25] word of God made material. God made
[25:27] flesh and before their eyes, it was the
[25:29] very word of God materialized before
[25:32] them. And he says, "If you receive my
[25:34] flesh, if you receive me and you you
[25:37] partake of me and you eat of me,"
[25:39] listen, eating is a metaphor in the
[25:41] Bible. And that metaphor in the Bible is
[25:43] for receiving into yourself, for
[25:45] partaking of. Amen. Remember in
[25:48] Proverbs, uh I think it's Proverbs
[25:50] 30:20, it says, "Such is the way of an
[25:52] adulterous woman. She eateth.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Wipeth her mouth and say, "If I've done
[25:57] no evil." Amen. She wasn't eating. She
[26:00] was committing adultery. Amen. But that
[26:02] committing adultery was receiving
[26:04] something into herself. And the
[26:05] metaphor, it was typed with eating.
[26:07] Amen. So eating is receiving. Eating is
[26:10] partaking. Eating is consuming. Eating
[26:13] is bringing it into yourself. AMEN.
[26:15] BECAUSE YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT. AMEN.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. and eating and humanity. God is
[26:22] always using these types of humanity to
[26:24] teach us spiritual lessons. Eating is
[26:26] how we sustain our life. You stop eating
[26:29] and you become weak. And after you eat,
[26:31] you don't eat for so long, you die.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; So eating pertains to life. Drinking
[26:36] pertains to life. THAT'S WHY JESUS SAYS,
[26:39] "COME and eat of me. EAT MY FLESH."
[26:41] AMEN. DRINK MY BLOOD. HE ALSO SAYS, "I'M
[26:44] A FOUNTAIN OF WATER. IF YOU DRINK FROM
[26:45] ME, OUT OF YOUR BELLY SHALL FLOW RIVER."
[26:47] I AM WATER. I AM I AM BREAD. HE that
[26:50] eats of me shall never hunger again.
[26:52] Shall never thirst again. BECAUSE WHAT?
[26:54] THE LIFE THAT I'LL GIVE THEM IS NOT A
[26:56] LIFE THAT RUNS OUT LIKE when you eat
[26:58] natural. But this is a life that you
[27:00] eat. It sustains forever.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; So he's teaching us a lesson by eating
[27:07] his flesh and drinking his blood. And he
[27:09] says my flesh is meat indeed. If he says
[27:11] it's meat indeed, it's meat indeed. It's
[27:13] actually you're able to eat it
[27:17] &gt;&gt; spiritually.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we go over here to Matthew, I
[27:23] want to look at Matthew 16.
[27:26] Then Jesus said unto them, "Take heed
[27:28] and beware of the leaven of the
[27:30] Pharisees and of the Sadducees." Levven
[27:32] is an ingredient that's used in bread
[27:35] that makes it rise. It makes the soft
[27:37] bread.
[27:38] and they they were confused
[27:42] and they begin to ask themselves why
[27:44] what he uh we forgot to bring bread.
[27:48] So he's he's he's chasening us because
[27:52] we forgot to bring bread in the boat on
[27:54] the journey.
[27:56] And Jesus begins to correct them and he
[27:59] says, "How is it that you do not
[28:00] understand that I spake it not to you
[28:03] concerning bread? I was talking about
[28:05] leaven. You only understand leaven as
[28:07] bread. I I'm giving you a type.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; How is it that you do not understand
[28:13] that I spake it not to you concerning
[28:15] bread that you should beware of the
[28:16] leavenven of the Pharisees and the
[28:18] Sadducees? Then understood they how that
[28:21] he bade them not beware of the leavenven
[28:24] of bread, but of the doctrine of the
[28:26] Pharisees and the Sadducees.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; So when he said beware of leaven, he
[28:31] wasn't talking about the natural leaven
[28:33] that you bake into the bread. He was
[28:35] talking about a spiritual leaven that
[28:37] can get mixed into bread.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; And that spiritual leaven is what?
[28:42] Teaching.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; That's what doctrine means. Teaching.
[28:46] Beware of the leaven, the teaching of
[28:48] the Pharisees that they mix into the
[28:50] word. And when they mix it into the
[28:52] word, it gets all puffed up and it looks
[28:54] good and and all of that, but there's
[28:56] sin baked into it because 11's a type of
[28:59] sin of unbelief. And so the Pharisees
[29:01] and Sadducees were mixing, amen, their
[29:04] own ideas in with the word of God. Amen.
[29:06] And creating what? A big religious
[29:08] system and a big old loaf. Amen. But he
[29:10] says, "Beware of the leaven of the
[29:13] Pharisees."
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Beware of what they mix in their bread.
[29:17] He's not talking about anything you eat.
[29:19] This is spiritually what you consume,
[29:21] what you feed on, and what you receive.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God is good. Brother Bam
[29:30] says we are in our journey. We in our
[29:33] journey are something like Israel was.
[29:36] Israel in their journey had to get new
[29:37] mana every day. For new mana fell. We
[29:40] are supposed not to live in the light of
[29:42] Luther, live in the light of Wesley or
[29:44] live in the light of Pentecost. We're in
[29:46] another age. New mana. What happened if
[29:50] they tried to keep the mana over? It
[29:51] contaminated. It would kill them. That's
[29:54] the reason we got so many spiritual dead
[29:57] so-called Christians. They're eating a
[29:59] glare of another day. They're eating
[30:01] mana that's already contaminated.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bam, I'm still using this
[30:05] analogy of mana that's falling. Amen. As
[30:08] a type of something else. So, in the
[30:11] wilderness journey in the first Exodus,
[30:14] Amen. as they were journeying along,
[30:15] they had no provision. So, God provided
[30:18] them a daily portion of food. And that
[30:20] daily portion of food was mana. And it
[30:22] fell in the night. And they collected it
[30:24] in the morning. And it was it was
[30:26] supposed to be only enough to sustain
[30:28] them for that day.
[30:30] And and God told them not to gather more
[30:34] than what you'd need for one day. And he
[30:36] gave a portion for each man in the
[30:38] household. And they would gather for
[30:39] just each person in the household. And
[30:41] he told them not to keep it over. Amen.
[30:43] Because he was teaching them to trust
[30:45] him. I who fed you today, I will feed
[30:48] you tomorrow.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. But they didn't listen. This is
[30:51] what Moses tells them. And when the
[30:54] children of Israel saw it, they said one
[30:55] to another, "It is mana, for they wish
[30:58] not what it was." Mana means, "What is
[31:00] it?"
[31:02] &gt;&gt; They had never seen it before. They
[31:03] didn't know what it was. What is it? And
[31:05] Moses said unto them, "This is the bread
[31:07] which the Lord hath given you to eat."
[31:10] It's amazing how many times people look
[31:12] at the word of God when you present the
[31:13] truth from the message to them the first
[31:15] time right out of the Bible, and they
[31:16] look at you and say, "What is that?
[31:19] &gt;&gt; I've never I've never heard that before.
[31:21] Nobody ever told me about water baptism
[31:23] in Jesus' name. I never heard such a
[31:25] thing as serpent saying. What do you
[31:26] mean God's only one? I only knew him as
[31:28] a trinity. What is that? This is the
[31:30] bread which God sent down from heaven.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOD'S BREAD TO SUSTAIN US IN THE
[31:36] JOURNEY to give us strength to nourish
[31:37] us. Amen. And we look at it as what is
[31:40] it?
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's amazing how accurate the
[31:46] Bible is. Yeah.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Says verse 16, "This is the thing which
[31:49] the Lord hath commanded. Gather of it
[31:51] every man according to his eating, an
[31:54] omer for every man, according to the
[31:56] number of your persons. Take ye every
[31:58] man for them which are in his tents." So
[32:00] he says, "Only gather this much per
[32:02] person in your house, enough to eat for
[32:04] one day, and no more." But it says, "And
[32:07] Moses said, let not man leave of it till
[32:10] the morning." Notwithstanding, they
[32:12] hearkened not unto Moses, but some of
[32:14] them left of it until the morning, and
[32:17] it bred worms, and stank, and Moses was
[32:20] wroth with them.
[32:23] the very thing that came from God
[32:27] to give them life for that day when they
[32:30] did not obey God and trust him for the
[32:32] new mana that would fall the next day
[32:34] but tried to hold on to the old mana
[32:36] which brother Benham says represents the
[32:38] previous age the former day and not
[32:40] trusting God to rain down bread food the
[32:43] word of God for this day fresh amen
[32:46] trying to hold on to the old Amen he
[32:48] said it bred worms and stank and Moses
[32:51] was wroth with them all All of a sudden,
[32:53] the thing that was wonderful one day,
[32:55] Amen, becomes a curse the next day.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; This is remarkable. The one thing that
[33:04] gave life now becomes a stink.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; That is amazing to me.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the one thing that was
[33:16] lifegiving now is contaminated. And
[33:18] brother Brim says, "And that that thing
[33:20] that's rotten mana that's got termites
[33:22] in it or wiggle tails or whatever you
[33:24] want to call it from 40, 50 years ago,
[33:26] still trying to eat that old mana that
[33:29] fell way back years ago." And the
[33:31] children of Israel on their journey, new
[33:33] mana fell every night. That's right. You
[33:36] couldn't keep it over. We don't live
[33:39] over some other age gone by. We're
[33:41] eating new mana, fresh mana out of
[33:44] heaven in our journey as we go.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise God that God has given
[33:49] us fresh mana.
[33:52] That that this type of eating, this
[33:54] spiritual food that God's given us, he
[33:56] he's promised us that he was given us
[33:58] fresh mana. He has given us fresh mana.
[34:01] We don't have to go back to a previous
[34:03] age and eat that. That won't work like
[34:06] it did in the day that it fell.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; And the day that it fell, it was good.
[34:11] It was fresh. It was from the hand of
[34:12] God. It gave life and it moved us
[34:14] forward in the journey. But now we can't
[34:16] go back to that. We've got to take the
[34:18] part that's falling today.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Hey, a amen. This whole concept of
[34:25] eating is so amazing. Amen. The analogy
[34:27] of eating, if you if you understand the
[34:30] spirit, the natural types, the
[34:31] spiritual. Amen. We are as strong as our
[34:34] diet.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; You realize there there I said this down
[34:40] in Junction City, too. There is an
[34:42] epidemic in our society of children
[34:46] suffering from malnutrition.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; But not because of lack of food,
[34:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[34:52] &gt;&gt; They're eating all the time. Some of
[34:54] them are overweight and undernourished.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Because the food doesn't have nutrients
[34:59] in it. It's highly processed. It's
[35:01] manufactured. Amen. It's only there to
[35:03] create a taste and an addiction. And
[35:05] they put more and more sugar in it to
[35:06] create more of addiction. And people are
[35:08] eating all the time and not getting
[35:10] stronger. Eating all the time and not
[35:13] getting healthier. Eating all the time
[35:14] and getting weaker.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE NATURAL TYPES OF SPIRITUAL.
[35:20] THERE'S PEOPLE GOING TO CHURCH EVERY
[35:22] SUNDAY, EVERY WEDNESDAY, AND THEY'RE NOT
[35:24] GAINING spiritual strength, but they're
[35:25] growing spiritually weaker and becoming
[35:27] more WORLDLY DAY BY DAY, MORE
[35:29] CONTAMINATED WITH MORE SICKNESSES and
[35:31] more illnesses. And America is one of
[35:33] the most sickest nations in all the
[35:36] world.
[35:38] because of our food.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Right?
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Because of our food.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; And a religious free society with a
[35:45] church on every corner is spiritually
[35:48] sick.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Because they're eating all the time,
[35:52] &gt;&gt; but there's no nutrition in the food.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's there's nothing that gives
[35:58] strength and life and health. Amen. But
[36:01] but there's increases of diabetes and
[36:03] all kinds of diseases and IT ALL ALMOST
[36:06] ALMOST ALL coming from diet.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Almost all of it. Amen. To make it look
[36:13] good, taste good. Amen. Make it make it
[36:16] highly addictable and highly sought
[36:18] after, but it doesn't give life like
[36:22] real food that comes out of the ground
[36:23] and grown in your garden that you pluck
[36:25] with your own hands that has life in it.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it's amazing that we we
[36:32] live in a society like that. So we can
[36:33] see the results the natural types of
[36:35] spiritual. Amen. And this whole metaphor
[36:37] of eating is a fascinating to me because
[36:39] when you go back to the book of Genesis,
[36:41] what caused the fall? Amen. In the
[36:43] analogy in the time, what caused the
[36:45] fall of all mankind? Eating.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Don't partake of that tree. BUT SHE SAW,
[36:51] AMEN. She looked at THE TREE AND SAW it
[36:53] was good for food. Amen. A tree to uh
[36:56] make one wise, a desirable tree. AND SHE
[36:58] TOOK AND SHE ATE AND give to her husband
[37:00] and ate. This is THE ANALOGY. THEY PTOOK
[37:02] OF SOMETHING THAT WASN'T PURE WORD. They
[37:05] ptook of something that brought
[37:07] hybridization. They took of the tree of
[37:09] knowledge of good and evil, which was a
[37:10] mixed tree. Amen. The tree of life WOULD
[37:13] HAVE ONLY BROUGHT LIFE, BUT THE tree of
[37:14] knowledge of good AND EVIL BROUGHT
[37:16] DEATH. And now in the analogy, WHAT THEY
[37:18] ATE CAUSED THEM TO DIE WHEN THEY could
[37:20] have ate something else and stayed
[37:22] alive.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; They could have eaten from the tree of
[37:25] life. Amen. Then they would they lost
[37:27] access to the tree of life. And it all
[37:30] had to do with eating. I love it.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; It's good to me.
[37:36] Amen. I want to look at this scripture
[37:38] in Jeremiah. Jeremiah 15:16.
[37:41] Thy words were found.
[37:44] Oh man, I'm going to black that out.
[37:47] Thy words were found. That means the
[37:49] words were lost.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; But Jeremiah says, "Thy words were
[37:54] found." Amen.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. Do we have words that have
[37:57] been found that were lost in the dark
[37:59] ages? Lost through denomination, lost
[38:02] under Catholicism and darkness of
[38:04] denomination. Their words were found.
[38:06] But look what happens after the words
[38:08] were found. Thy words were found and I
[38:10] did eat them. And thy word was unto me
[38:13] the joy and rejoicing of mine heart. For
[38:16] I am called by thy name, oh Lord God of
[38:18] hosts. Hey, did you eat the word that's
[38:20] been found?
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And was it a joy and rejoicing of
[38:23] your heart?
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen. I feel like Jeremiah.
[38:28] I feel like I know exactly how he felt.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what was he eating? The word.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Ephesians chapter 4
[38:38] together. Turn with me there.
[38:43] Ephesians chapter 4
[38:49] verse 10. Super familiar scripture to
[38:52] us, but I I want to take a few minutes
[38:54] and just look over it again. Ephesians
[38:56] 4:10. He that he that descended is the
[39:00] same also that ascended up far above all
[39:02] heavens that he might fill all that he
[39:05] might fill all things. And he gave some
[39:07] apostles, some prophets, some
[39:10] evangelists, some pastors and teachers.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; For the perfecting of the saints, for
[39:16] the work of the ministry, for the
[39:18] edifying of the body of Christ. That's
[39:20] the building up of the body of Christ
[39:22] till we all come into the unity of the
[39:24] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[39:26] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[39:29] of the stature of the fullness of
[39:31] Christ. that we come into the stature of
[39:32] a perfect man. that we henceforth be no
[39:35] more children tossed to and fro and
[39:37] carried about with every wind of
[39:38] doctrine by the slight of men and
[39:40] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[39:42] wait to deceive, but speaking the truth
[39:45] in love, may grow up unto him in all
[39:48] things which is the head, even Christ,
[39:51] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[39:53] together, and compacted by that which
[39:55] every joint supplieth, according to the
[39:58] effectual working in the measure of
[39:59] every part, making increase of the body
[40:02] unto the edifying ing of itself and
[40:04] love. So Christ sent the gifts, these
[40:09] gifts down and he sent apostles,
[40:11] prophets, evangelists, pastors, and
[40:14] teachers. And he sent them down to do
[40:16] what? He sent him down to complete the
[40:19] the perfecting of the saints, the work
[40:20] of the ministry, to build up the body of
[40:23] Christ, to bring us all into the stature
[40:26] of the fullness of Christ, to build the
[40:29] body up into the head which is Christ,
[40:31] and to bring the body up to every joint
[40:34] supplies for the building up or the
[40:36] edification of the body as a whole. So
[40:38] what were the five-fold ministry done?
[40:40] They were sent to help the body grow to
[40:43] full stature.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. How are they going to do
[40:47] it? What does it take? What do they do?
[40:51] Do they come down and drink coffee with
[40:52] you? Do they do they come down and tell
[40:54] you stories? NO. THEY GIVE THE WORD OF
[40:57] GOD. AND THE WORD OF GOD DOES ALL OF
[40:59] THIS. THE WORD OF GOD GROWS YOU INTO A
[41:01] STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN. The word of
[41:02] God brings us into the unity of faith.
[41:04] THE WORD OF GOD KEEPS us from being
[41:06] deceived by the slide of men's hands and
[41:08] tossed by every wind OF DOCTRINE. THE
[41:10] WORD OF GOD BRINGS US INTO OUR position
[41:11] in the church. THE WORD OF GOD MAKES us
[41:13] a joint THAT SUPPLIES. THE WORD OF GOD
[41:15] BRINGS US TO A PLACE WHERE THE WHOLE
[41:17] BODY IS EDIFIED TOGETHER in itself in
[41:19] love. Amen. How does the five-fold
[41:21] MINISTRY DO THIS? NOT WITH THEIR
[41:23] PERSONALITIES, NOT WITH THEIR CHARISMA,
[41:25] NOT WITH THEIR OWN INTELLECTUAL WISDOM,
[41:27] NOT BY GOING OUT TO BALL GAMES WITH YOU,
[41:29] NOT BY COMING to your HOUSE AND DRINKING
[41:30] COFFEE. HOW DOES THIS ACCOMPLISHED BY
[41:33] these ministry gifts? Because these are
[41:35] five different functions of the ministry
[41:37] of Christ. That is to take the word and
[41:39] dish THE WORD BACK OUT TO THE PEOPLE.
[41:41] AND IT'S THE WORD THAT brings us into
[41:43] THIS POSITION. IT'S THE WORD THAT BUILDS
[41:45] US UP. IT'S THE WORD THAT strengthens us
[41:47] and brings us into life and grows us and
[41:49] MATURES US. JUST LIKE THE FOOD DOES IN
[41:52] OUR natural life, this word does to our
[41:54] spiritual life.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; So, how does the ministry do this? HOW
[41:58] DOES THE FIVE MINISTRY ACCOMPLISH ALL OF
[42:00] THAT? BECAUSE, AMEN. these are the five
[42:03] gifts that God anointed to break down
[42:05] his word and preach the word.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; So, it's the word that does this.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; I say we eat it.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Do you know how happy I am that when God
[42:19] told me you have to feed sheep because
[42:21] the name the word pastor means feeder of
[42:23] sheep?
[42:25] Listen, you know how horrible it is for
[42:28] a mom try to keep fixing supper and
[42:30] she's got no ingredients. There's
[42:32] nothing in the pantry, no tools to work
[42:34] with. But oh, praise God. We live in an
[42:36] age the kitchen's equipped.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; You need a blender, you got a blender.
[42:40] Amen. You need ice maker. You got an ice
[42:42] maker. You need you what whatever
[42:44] contraption you can think of, you got
[42:46] it. Amen. There there's automatic
[42:48] grinders and there's this that and every
[42:50] tool we need of has been placed in our
[42:53] hands in this day in the hands of the
[42:55] ministry like never before. And the
[42:57] pantry IS FULL OF ALL THE ingredients
[43:00] that you could ever need. AMEN. IT'S GOT
[43:02] ALL THE organic original non-hybrid
[43:05] ingredients.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT BRING HEALTH AND STRENGTH AND
[43:09] LIFE. AMEN. TO THE BODY OF CHRIST AND
[43:11] the fridge is full and the pantry is
[43:13] full. Amen. AND ALL THE TOOLS ARE SET
[43:16] OUT IN THE KITCHEN. I think it's
[43:18] amazing. Sometimes we'll be planning to
[43:20] have company over and and we we we set a
[43:22] date and people are coming or we've got
[43:24] guests that are ministering guests that
[43:26] are coming in and and and and my wife
[43:29] keeps asking me, "What do you think we
[43:30] should have?" I don't know what we
[43:31] should have. You you're the expert, you
[43:34] know. And we'll give out ideas and
[43:36] she'll she'll say something to me. She
[43:38] says, "I'm just not feeling it. I have
[43:40] to catch an inspiration.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; I'm like, my goodness, I'm always
[43:46] inspired to eat whatever's on the table,
[43:47] but cooking must be different. Amen.
[43:52] Amen. And she'll wait and wait and wait,
[43:53] and all of a sudden, she'll catch an
[43:55] inspiration. As soon as she does, she's
[43:56] all day in the kitchen. She's love it.
[43:58] She's having a wonderful time. She's in
[44:00] her element cuz she caught the
[44:01] inspiration of what to fix for the
[44:02] guests that are coming.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly what preaching is
[44:06] like.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Exactly. To the tea. Amen. You sit
[44:10] around all day. You got a kitchen that's
[44:11] fully equipped. You got a pantry that's
[44:13] full. AMEN. BUT YOU'RE NOT JUST IN there
[44:15] putting ingredients together and
[44:16] stirring up for nothing. YOU'VE GOT TO
[44:18] CATCH AN inspiration first. But if I get
[44:20] an inspiration for stir fry, it's there.
[44:22] If I got an inspiration for curry
[44:24] chicken, it's there. If I HAVE AN
[44:26] INSPIRATION FOR POT ROAST, IT'S ALL
[44:27] THERE. WHATEVER THE HOLY GHOST INSPIRES,
[44:30] WE GOT THE INGREDIENTS. WE GOT THE
[44:32] EQUIPMENT. WE GOT THE KITCHEN. WE CAN
[44:34] EAT GOOD. FRIENDS, YOU KNOW HOW EXCITING
[44:35] IT IS TO BE PART OF THE FIVE-FOLD
[44:37] MINISTRY TODAY?
[44:39] Praise God. I'm so excited. Can you
[44:41] imagine walking into a first class
[44:43] commercial kitchen with everything you
[44:45] need and then all the food and
[44:47] EVERYTHING YOU COULD EVER dream of.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Oh man, for you sisters who like to
[44:51] cook. I'm sure that's fun
[44:53] for me. I wouldn't know what to do with
[44:55] half of it. I'd be over there eating raw
[44:57] vegetables.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; But praise God, it's so good to live in
[45:03] this day
[45:05] &gt;&gt; when God has given us everything we have
[45:07] need of.
[45:09] In 1 Thessalonians 3, the Apostle Paul
[45:11] says, "Night and day, praying
[45:13] exceedingly that we might see your face
[45:16] and might perfect that which is lacking
[45:19] in your faith." This struck me as odd
[45:22] when I read this. We might perfect that
[45:25] which is lacking in your faith.
[45:29] He's talking to the Thessalonians.
[45:31] The Thessalonians had already received
[45:33] Christ as the Messiah. They had already
[45:35] believed in the atonement by his
[45:37] substitutionary death. They believed in
[45:39] his resurrection. They were born again.
[45:41] They had the Holy Ghost.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; But yet they were lacking.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; That means they could grow more.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; HOW WAS HE GOING TO grow them? What was
[45:54] he going to do? He's saying uh night and
[45:58] day praying exceeding that I might see
[46:00] your FACE AND MIGHT PERFECT THAT WHICH
[46:02] IS lacking in your faith. How was he
[46:04] going to perfect that which was lacking
[46:05] in their faith? How was he going to help
[46:07] their faith grow? Probably by sitting
[46:09] and drinking coffee with them and
[46:10] telling them stories and talking about
[46:12] ball games and
[46:14] no, HE WAS GOING TO BRING TO THEM THE
[46:16] mystery of the gospel that he had in
[46:18] him. And he was going to further unfold
[46:20] the word. And the further unfolding of
[46:22] the word IS GOING TO PERFECT THAT WHICH
[46:24] WAS LACKING IN THEIR FAITH. That means
[46:26] even though they believed IN CHRIST,
[46:28] THEY BELIEVED IN THE RE THE the
[46:30] substitutionary death, the resurrection,
[46:32] they were saved and filled with the Holy
[46:34] Ghost, THEY WERE STILL GROWING IN FAITH.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; And in ORDER TO GROW MORE IN FAITH, THEY
[46:41] NEEDED PAUL TO COME AND PREACH THE WORD
[46:44] BECAUSE THE PREACHING OF THE WORD WAS
[46:45] HELPING them grow in faith.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; So then faith cometh by hearing and
[46:52] hearing by the word of God. HOW WILL HE
[46:54] PERFECT WHICH IS LACKING IN THEIR FAITH?
[46:56] BY PREACHING THE GOSPEL.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Let's go to second Peter 3 together.
[47:03] Just want to hit a couple of these
[47:04] spots. Second Peter 3.
[47:14] Second Peter 3 and verse 15.
[47:19] and accounting that the longsuffering of
[47:21] our Lord is salvation, even as our
[47:25] beloved brother Paul also according to
[47:27] the wisdom given unto him hath written
[47:29] unto you. As also in all his epistles,
[47:32] speaking in them of these things, in
[47:34] which are some things hard to be
[47:36] understood. I love that they didn't
[47:40] always understand Paul.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; So, I'm okay if I don't always
[47:44] understand what Brother Bam's trying to
[47:45] get me to see. Amen. They didn't always
[47:47] understand Paul. But just because Paul
[47:49] was hard to be understood doesn't mean
[47:51] Paul was wrong.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Right?
[47:56] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to be simple to be true.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Doesn't have to be simplistic. It can be
[48:01] hard to be understood.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; According to the Bible,
[48:05] &gt;&gt; some things are hard to be understood
[48:06] which they that are unlearned and
[48:09] unstable rest. That means twist as they
[48:12] do also the other scriptures unto their
[48:14] own destruction. Ye therefore, beloved,
[48:17] seeing you know these things before,
[48:19] beware, lest you also, being led away
[48:21] with the error of the wicked, fall from
[48:23] your own steadfastness.
[48:25] But grow in grace and in the knowledge
[48:28] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To
[48:30] him be glory both now and forever. Amen.
[48:33] But Peter's admonishing to grow. You can
[48:36] grow in grace and in the knowledge of
[48:38] the Lord Jesus Christ. How are you going
[48:40] to do that? By the word. By what we eat.
[48:43] How will we grow? by what we eat.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; And the way we grow will determine what
[48:49] our diet is.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:54] First Peter 2:2, "As newborn babes,
[48:57] desire the sincere milk of the word,
[49:00] that you may grow thereby, if so be you
[49:03] have tasted that the Lord is gracious."
[49:05] So how do you grow? By the word.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you're newborn babes, you
[49:11] take the milk of the word that you may
[49:14] grow. Praise God. Amen. But you're not
[49:18] always supposed to be a newborn babe.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul says in Hebrews, called of
[49:23] God, he's speaking about uh Melkisedc,
[49:25] called of God, uh a high priest after
[49:28] the order Melzdc, of whom we have many
[49:31] things to say and hard to be uttered,
[49:33] seeing you are dull of hearing. For when
[49:36] for the time you ought to be teachers,
[49:38] you have need that one teach you again,
[49:40] which be the first principles of the
[49:42] oracles of God, and are become such as
[49:44] have need of milk and not strong meat.
[49:47] What's he speaking of in milk and strong
[49:49] meat? He's wanting to preach about
[49:51] Melkisedc.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; But he said, I can't preach to you about
[49:55] Melkisedc because you're dull of hearing
[49:56] because you should be more advanced than
[49:58] you are. I can't get into the doctrine
[50:00] of Melkisedc because you're now on milk.
[50:02] If you were on meat, you could
[50:04] understand the doctrine OF MELKISEDC.
[50:05] WELL, PAUL COULDN'T go into Melkisedc.
[50:07] But guess who could? Guess who could
[50:09] give us a background? GUESS WHO COULD
[50:11] PREACH who is this Melkisedc? Amen. It
[50:13] was the PROPHET OF THE AGE BECAUSE THEY
[50:15] WEREN'T READY for it then. But when we
[50:16] come to the end OF THE AGES, AMEN. NOW
[50:19] we're eating meat. We're maturing. WE'RE
[50:21] GROWING. AND NOW THERE'S A PROPHET ON
[50:23] THE SCENE THAT can take US TO THE PLACE
[50:25] THAT PAUL COULDN'T TAKE THEM BECAUSE
[50:26] THEY WEREN'T READY.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE WORD AND HE'S
[50:30] TALKING ABOUT GROWING. AND HE'S TALKING
[50:32] ABOUT DEVELOPMENT AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT
[50:34] MATURITY ALL BASED OFF WHAT they were
[50:36] eating.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; For everyone that uses milk is
[50:39] unskillful in the word of righteousness.
[50:43] See that
[50:46] &gt;&gt; you can't go to the meat of the word.
[50:50] Amen. Until you become skillful in the
[50:52] word.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; You've got to grow up.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; For he is a babe. But strong meat
[50:58] belongth to them that are of full age.
[51:00] Even those who by reason by reason of uh
[51:04] use have their senses exercised to
[51:06] discern both good and evil. Amen. What
[51:09] is it that's going to bring us to the
[51:11] meat? Amen. When we learn the lessons
[51:13] when we grow when we grow to where we
[51:15] can take the meat because the meat is
[51:16] for those that are full age. And this
[51:18] message is full of meat.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:25] and the God of this evil age. He says,
[51:26] "Brother, has God give you a spirit of
[51:29] the world till you can't see what's
[51:31] wrong?" This is little G. He's talking
[51:34] about the message is the God of this
[51:36] evil age.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Has this God give you the spirit of the
[51:39] world till you can't see that that's
[51:42] wrong? Has he blinded your eyes to the
[51:44] ethics of the church, the denomination,
[51:45] the creed, and so forth that you can't
[51:47] see that God is vindicating his word and
[51:50] making it so? Has your job? Has your
[51:52] boss, has your wife, has your children,
[51:54] has your church or anything separated
[51:56] you from the word of God, which is the
[51:59] only source of life.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; What is the only source of life? The
[52:05] word of God.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; What is the bread of life? The word of
[52:09] God. Jesus Christ. I am the bread that
[52:11] came down of heaven. I am the bread of
[52:14] life. And if you eat my flesh, which is
[52:16] the word made flesh,
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; then you're part of me.
[52:22] Now and seed is not air. He says,
[52:24] "Neither shall a Christian eat on the
[52:26] dead carryins from old denominational
[52:28] doctrines and things. They want the word
[52:30] of God fresh, the promise of the hour."
[52:32] God promised rabbits in the days of
[52:34] Luther. He promised other things in days
[52:36] of others. But now he promised us a full
[52:39] square meal, the full seven course menu
[52:42] for all seven seals are open and
[52:44] everything is ready for the word of God
[52:46] to those who can receive it.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. to those who can eat it, those who
[52:51] can h receive it, those who can partake
[52:54] of it. Amen. And I want to eat the seven
[52:56] course menu.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; And if God has set a seven course menu,
[53:00] a seven course meal, he did it for our
[53:02] strength so that we could overcome in
[53:04] this day. And I don't want to leave any
[53:06] part out.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; So the food is available.
[53:12] And Joel says, "And I will restore to
[53:14] you the years that the locust hath
[53:17] eaten, the cankerworm, the caterpillar,
[53:19] the palmer, my great army which I sent
[53:21] among you." Brother Ram goes to this
[53:24] message here and he starts to show you
[53:25] the restoration of the bride tree and
[53:27] that God is bringing us out of the
[53:29] church ages by a restoration and what
[53:31] that those four stages of that insect
[53:34] ate down to the dark ages. God has been
[53:36] restoring through the reformation to
[53:38] bring back. Amen. the original church,
[53:40] the original planting.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; And he says, "My great army which I send
[53:44] among you, and ye shall eat in plenty."
[53:50] &gt;&gt; When will we eat in plenty? When they
[53:52] restore, when he says, "I will restore
[53:55] all the years." When did he restore?
[53:57] It's in THIS MESSAGE HE RESTORES. SO IN
[53:59] THIS MESSAGE, we can eat in plenty.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; ALWAYS IT WAS A PORTION. IT WAS A
[54:04] MEASURE. IT WAS A TRICKLING BACK,
[54:06] BRINGING BACK BY PORTIONS. AMEN. BUT
[54:08] THIS ISN'T THE PORTION. THIS IS THE
[54:10] SEVENTH COURSE MENU. THE MEAL IS SET.
[54:12] AMEN. THE THE THE supernatural spiritual
[54:15] feast OF THE LORD IS LAID OPEN. COME AND
[54:18] DINE.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Ye shall EAT IN PLENTY AND BE SATISFIED.
[54:24] And praise the name of the Lord your God
[54:26] that had dealt wondrously with you. And
[54:28] my people shall never be ashamed.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT HUNGRY ANYMORE. WE'RE NOT
[54:34] LETHARGIC ANYMORE. WE'RE NOT IN FAMINE
[54:36] ANYMORE BECAUSE WE FOUND THE MASTER'S
[54:38] TABLE. WE'VE BEEN INVITED to the feast.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; And you shall eat in plenty and be
[54:46] satisfied. How many's eaten good?
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; And it feels good and it tastes good and
[54:51] it's giving us spiritual strength.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:56] Brother goes on to say, 'I went back in
[54:57] this vision and there was a little long
[54:59] building and then a voice said to me,
[55:02] and all of you remember this or many of
[55:04] you, a voice said to me, bring in food,
[55:07] store it in. That's the only way to keep
[55:10] them here is give them food. And I
[55:12] brought in had brought in great big
[55:14] barrels full of the prettiest carrots
[55:16] and the prettiest vegetables and the
[55:17] things I ever seen. I mean, this is the
[55:19] time brother Ben was supposed to go
[55:20] overseas in a trip and he has the vision
[55:23] about the two brothers in the canoe,
[55:25] brother Wood and Brother Soffman going
[55:27] as tourists, but he was in a little
[55:28] white canoe going up and down the bank
[55:30] and he said, "It's fine to go and
[55:32] anywhere on the east coast, anywhere in
[55:34] the United States for one meeting, but
[55:35] not across the ocean to Europe." Amen.
[55:37] And so this vision is all God gives him
[55:39] the interpretation. But after the
[55:41] vision, he sees this long building which
[55:44] was Brandham Tabernacle. And he and he
[55:46] sees it where they're bringing in all
[55:47] these barrels full of the greatest,
[55:49] prettiest vegetables he ever did see.
[55:51] And God tells him, "Stay home."
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Don't go overseas. Stay home and store
[55:57] up the food.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; What food?
[56:00] &gt;&gt; It's the food we're eating on now.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; HE WAS TOLD, "DON'T TAKE THAT TRIP.
[56:05] DON'T GO OVERSEAS. YOU STAY HOME. AND
[56:07] THAT WAS AT the in the MIDDLE PART OF 62
[56:10] AND ALL THROUGH THE END OF 62 was the
[56:12] transition that brings us to 63 to sers.
[56:15] Is this the time? Amen. TO GOING OUT
[56:17] WEST TO GETTING THE opening of the
[56:18] seals. Amen. The coming back and
[56:20] preaching the opening OF THE SEALS. ALL
[56:22] TAKES PLACE AFTER HE'S TOLD STAY HOME
[56:24] and store up the food.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And look what he was storing up.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Hamburgers and hot dogs and ho Hos and
[56:35] Cheerios. No. Amen. The prettiest
[56:37] carrots. THE PRETTIEST WHAT? HE'S
[56:39] TALKING ABOUT HEALTHY FOOD. STUFF THAT
[56:41] BRINGS HEALTH AND NUTRITION AND LIFE AND
[56:43] VITALITY.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And Christ is the mystery. I want
[56:48] you to note this is Christ the mystery
[56:50] of God revealed. Said, "Bless our dear
[56:52] beloved pastor, the shepherd. We pray
[56:54] that you'll anoint him with the Holy
[56:55] Spirit of thy word and reveal to them
[56:58] and feed the flock." It was just a while
[57:01] ago when you showed the vision, the
[57:03] little tabernacle here about to store up
[57:05] the food. And there would come a time
[57:07] when this would be needed.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; There would come a time when this would
[57:12] be needed.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; I live in the time when I need this
[57:15] food.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; When we see brother Sman and brother
[57:19] Woods ready to cross over into another
[57:21] country, but you said, "Store up this
[57:23] food here for the time." Lord,
[57:25] reverently I've tried to do that. And
[57:27] now this morning in this lesson that we
[57:30] have thought of, I pray that you will
[57:32] cap it all off, Lord, to show that
[57:33] you're God and this is your word and
[57:36] your truth. Grant it, Lord, that the
[57:38] people might feed thereon
[57:41] and grow fat.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; As it was in the grace of God, and they
[57:47] would see that it's God's great mercy to
[57:49] us in this day.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. When brother Brenham says grow
[57:54] fat, he means
[57:57] healthy.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; That's an old term for healthy.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; It used to be a compliment to call
[58:02] people fat.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; I don't feel complimented with that.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Remember when brother Benham talked
[58:10] about uh Florence Nightingale and the
[58:12] picture where she was emaciated?
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Right. And they put a little black mark
[58:16] across her because she was nude and and
[58:18] and she was just bones. He said just
[58:20] like skin stretched over bones. He said,
[58:22] "I just met her other day. She's healthy
[58:23] and fat and doing well."
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:26] &gt;&gt; That's what Brother Bram said. He's
[58:28] using old terminology. Amen. So, what's
[58:31] he saying? Amen. May the people eat this
[58:34] and grow healthy.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Little later on the same message helped
[58:41] this morning. Lord, as we read the word,
[58:43] may the Holy Spirit reveal it to us that
[58:45] the church might be fully established in
[58:48] the faith that was once delivered to the
[58:49] saints to hold them. And may as you gave
[58:52] the vision some two years ago to store
[58:54] up the food, fine, healthy looking
[58:57] vegetables that I saw in the vision
[58:58] being stored here in this tabernacle,
[59:01] may we today receive a whole barrel full
[59:04] of that.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. Or a tape load.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. that it might reveal Jesus Christ
[59:11] to us in the hour that we live to give
[59:13] us sustaining strength, the spiritual
[59:16] strength for the task that lays ahead.
[59:18] Amen. What was all these vegetables
[59:20] stored up for? So that we could grow fat
[59:22] and healthy and have strength for the
[59:24] journey that lay for the task that lays
[59:25] ahead.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "And give us a whole barrel
[59:29] full of that or a tape load." Hey,
[59:32] listen. When you go and you start a new
[59:33] message, you just cracked open another
[59:35] barrel of the finest looking vegetables
[59:38] you ever seen. healthy food that will
[59:40] give you life, STRENGTH, VITALITY, AND
[59:43] ALL you need to grow into the full
[59:45] stature that Christ has for you.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; And that it might reveal Christ in the
[59:50] hour that we live in.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; The word
[59:55] made
[59:56] flesh.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And we can eat it.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Is it the word made flesh again?
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to do with it?
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Same thing we were supposed to do
[1:00:10] with it 2,000 years ago. Eat it.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; This is the word made flesh in our day.
[1:00:15] When it was the word made flesh, he
[1:00:17] said, "My flesh is meat indeed. Eat it.
[1:00:20] Drink it." Now the word has been made
[1:00:22] flesh again. What are we supposed to do
[1:00:24] with it? Eat it. Drink it. Have life.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10. I'm not going to read all
[1:00:31] this, but we know Revelation 10 so well.
[1:00:34] There's a little book open. Amen. And
[1:00:36] the voice says, "Go to the angel with
[1:00:38] the book open." Amen. And take the book.
[1:00:41] And he goes to the angel and he says,
[1:00:42] "Give me the book." And he and and he
[1:00:45] said unto me, "Take it
[1:00:48] and eat it up."
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; What are you supposed to do with this
[1:00:53] open book? Eat it up.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; What is this open book? It's the book of
[1:00:57] life.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; It's the title deed. IT'S THE BOOK OF
[1:01:02] LIFE. IT'S THE LAMB'S book of life.
[1:01:04] Amen. It's Christ.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; It's the bread from heaven.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE WORD MADE FLESH.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL THE SAME THING. AND WHAT ARE WE
[1:01:14] SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT? Eat it. Amen.
[1:01:17] And when you eat it, IT'LL BRING LIFE
[1:01:19] INTO YOU. IT'LL BRING YOU INTO HIM AND
[1:01:21] HIM INTO YOU. AND IT'LL GIVE YOU ENOUGH
[1:01:23] LIFE INSIDE OF YOU AND GROW YOU TO THE
[1:01:25] PLACE WHERE YOU CAN PROPHESY AGAIN. AND
[1:01:28] THEN YOU CAN GO ALL OVER AND EVERYWHERE
[1:01:30] sharing the word.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; So in the beginning, AMEN. THERE WAS A
[1:01:35] TREE that they weren't supposed to eat
[1:01:36] of, BUT THEY ATE THAT MIXED TREE AND
[1:01:39] BROUGHT DEATH. AND SO THEY WERE KEPT
[1:01:41] AWAY from the tree of life. OH, BUT ALL
[1:01:43] THROUGH THE CHURCH AGES and the
[1:01:44] restoration, he's been trying TO DRIVE
[1:01:46] THEM BACK TO THE tree of life because
[1:01:48] the way was made open again by the death
[1:01:50] at Calvary. And he's been trying to
[1:01:52] bring us back. AND AT THE end of the
[1:01:54] ages, at the close of time, amen,
[1:01:56] there's been a prophet on the scene. And
[1:01:58] Christ HAS COME DOWN WITH WHAT? THE VERY
[1:02:00] THING THAT THEY were separated with in
[1:02:02] the GARDEN HAS COME BACK INTO THEIR
[1:02:04] HANDS. THE TITLE DEED, THE BOOK OF LIFE.
[1:02:06] AMEN. THE BREAD OF LIFE, THE TREE OF
[1:02:08] LIFE. And we got access to it all again.
[1:02:10] And what is he asking US TO DO? HE'S
[1:02:12] ASKING us to eat it. Amen. In the
[1:02:15] beginning, we ate and died, BUT NOW
[1:02:17] WE'RE SUPPOSED TO EAT AND LIVE.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; We got to receive the word, receive it
[1:02:25] into ourselves, and may it be our life.
[1:02:30] And the anointed ones at the end time,
[1:02:32] the prophet says this. He said, 'I
[1:02:34] wasn't the one that appeared down on the
[1:02:36] river. I was only standing there when he
[1:02:38] appeared.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performs these
[1:02:41] things and fortells these things that
[1:02:43] happens as perfect as they are. I'm only
[1:02:46] one that's near when he does it. I was
[1:02:48] only a voice that he used to say it. It
[1:02:50] wasn't what I knew. It wasn't It was
[1:02:52] It's what I just surrendered myself to
[1:02:55] that he spoke through. It isn't me. It
[1:02:58] wasn't the seventh angel. Oh, no. It was
[1:03:01] the manifestation of the son of man. It
[1:03:04] wasn't the angel, his message. It was
[1:03:05] the mystery that God unfolded. It's not
[1:03:08] a man. It's God. The angel was not the
[1:03:10] son of man. He was the messenger from
[1:03:13] the son of man.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; The son of man is Christ.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; He is the one that you're feeding on.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; What are you feeding on? It's the son of
[1:03:25] man. Christ.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; He's the one you're feeding on. You're
[1:03:30] not feeding on a man, a man, his words
[1:03:33] will fail, but you're feeding on the
[1:03:36] unfailing body word of the son of man.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; We're back again where the word is made
[1:03:43] flesh.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; And Jesus says, "My body, my flesh is
[1:03:48] the bread of life.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; It is meat indeed. And if you eat it,
[1:03:53] you'll live."
[1:03:54] And now we've had the son of man on
[1:03:57] earth again
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; manifesting himself once again.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; And you're not feeding on the words of a
[1:04:03] man. This isn't William Brandham's
[1:04:05] words. You're not feeding on the words
[1:04:06] of a man. Those words would fail. You're
[1:04:08] feeding on the unfailing body. What's
[1:04:11] the body? What's the body? It's the word
[1:04:14] made flesh again. It's the manifestation
[1:04:17] of the son of man. A son of man
[1:04:19] revealing the son of man. the
[1:04:21] manifestation of the son of man in flesh
[1:04:23] again. And we're feeding on the body
[1:04:25] word of the son of man.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; What Jesus INVITED THEM TO DO SO long
[1:04:30] ago and commanded them to do, we have
[1:04:32] the option to do today to eat him and
[1:04:36] live. He is THE BREAD OF LIFE. He is the
[1:04:38] tree of life. He is the fountain of
[1:04:40] living waters.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; And he's asked us to eat.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; He didn't ask us to work. He didn't ask
[1:04:49] us to labor. He didn't ask us to plan.
[1:04:52] He didn't ask us.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; All he asked us to do was eat.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Remember the parable of the great man
[1:05:00] who had a feast and and when he created
[1:05:02] this great feast, not the not the
[1:05:04] scripture where they man created a
[1:05:05] feast, a wedding for his son, but just
[1:05:07] where the man created the feast. And he
[1:05:09] sent out his service to bid them to the
[1:05:11] feast. Amen. And none of them wanted to
[1:05:13] come. Amen. They had excuses because of
[1:05:15] this and because of that, I can't come.
[1:05:17] Amen. And he was wroth. He was angry and
[1:05:19] he said, "Send them back. Send the
[1:05:21] servant back out. GO BACK OUT AND COMPEL
[1:05:23] those that came in." And they did. They
[1:05:25] went out and they compelled them and
[1:05:26] many came. And then he goes back to the
[1:05:29] master. The servant goes back to the
[1:05:30] master and said, "Lord, we've done what
[1:05:32] you said, but there's still room."
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Go to the highways and go
[1:05:38] TO THE BYWAYS AND TO the hedges." And
[1:05:40] compelled them to come in because my
[1:05:42] supper shall BE FULL. AMEN. I didn't
[1:05:44] make it in vain. I made it to be eaten.
[1:05:46] And I made it to be consumed. I made it
[1:05:48] to be enjoyed. Amen. And I'm SO GLAD
[1:05:51] THAT GOD SENT SOMEBODY TO THE highways
[1:05:53] and the hedges and the byways CUZ HE
[1:05:54] PLUCKED ME OUT AND HE BROUGHT ME TO THE
[1:05:56] SPIRITUAL feast that's been prepared at
[1:05:58] the end time. Amen. Because his supper
[1:06:00] IS GOING TO BE FULL because the food is
[1:06:02] good.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; And now we're feasting on that good
[1:06:07] word.
[1:06:10] Amen. And in the God of this evil age,
[1:06:11] Brother Brim said in this, he says,
[1:06:14] "Father, as I have said many times, the
[1:06:16] sun rises in the morning. And as it
[1:06:18] comes up across the earth, it's sent by
[1:06:20] God to ripen the grain to make natural
[1:06:22] food for natural living. But oh God, you
[1:06:26] said to them that fear his name shall
[1:06:28] the son of righteousness rise with
[1:06:30] healing in his wings. Let the son of
[1:06:33] righteousness, the word of God, rise in
[1:06:36] the hearts of the people, and the
[1:06:37] healing rays of faith in that word cure
[1:06:39] every disobedient to the word and bring
[1:06:42] them to the fullness of sons and
[1:06:44] daughters of God.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Does anybody remember where this
[1:06:48] scripture is?
[1:06:50] To them that fear his name shall the son
[1:06:52] of righteousness arise with healing in
[1:06:54] his wings. Extra credit.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4. But let's go read it out of
[1:07:00] Malachi 4.
[1:07:03] For behold, the day cometh that shall
[1:07:05] burn as an oven, and all the proud, yay,
[1:07:08] and all that do wickedly shall be
[1:07:10] stubble. And the day that cometh shall
[1:07:13] burn them up, sayeth the Lord of hosts,
[1:07:15] that I shall leave them neither root nor
[1:07:17] branch. But unto you that fear my name
[1:07:19] shall the son of righteousness arise
[1:07:21] with healing in his wings.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; And ye shall go forth and grow up as
[1:07:27] calves of the stall.
[1:07:29] In that day that the son of
[1:07:31] righteousness shall arise with healing
[1:07:32] in his wings. Have we seen that day?
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; That's the day you shall go forth and
[1:07:38] grow up as calves of the stall, and you
[1:07:41] shall tread down the wicked, for they
[1:07:42] shall be ashes under the soles of your
[1:07:44] feet. And the day that I shall do this,
[1:07:46] sayith the Lord of hosts, remember you
[1:07:48] the law of Moses my servant, which I
[1:07:49] commanded unto him in Horeb for all
[1:07:51] Israel with the statutes and judgments.
[1:07:54] Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[1:07:56] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:07:57] and dreadful day of the Lord. That's
[1:07:59] this day.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; In this day, he said, "Those that fear
[1:08:03] my name shall the son of righteous arise
[1:08:05] with healing in his wings." Have we seen
[1:08:06] that?
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; In that day, you shall grow up as calves
[1:08:11] of the stall. What's a calf of the
[1:08:13] stall? Amen. That that's that is a beef
[1:08:17] cow. Amen. That's not sent out to
[1:08:19] pastor. He doesn't have to go find his
[1:08:21] own food. Amen. that he's put in the
[1:08:22] barn and he's put in a staunch and every
[1:08:25] day somebody throws some more food in
[1:08:27] front of him and all he has to do is
[1:08:28] stay in the stall. He doesn't have to
[1:08:30] hunt. He doesn't have to work. He
[1:08:31] doesn't have to labor. He doesn't have
[1:08:33] to do anything. All he has to do is
[1:08:34] stand there and when the farmer throws a
[1:08:36] new load, all he's got to do is eat the
[1:08:38] new load of grain.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in this day that the son of
[1:08:43] righteousness shall arise with healing
[1:08:44] in his wings. You're going to grow UP AS
[1:08:46] A CALF OF THE STALL BECAUSE HE SET A
[1:08:48] SEVEN COURSE MEAL and he keeps dumping
[1:08:50] ON YOU EVERY DAY. There's more word and
[1:08:52] more word and more word. And we don't
[1:08:55] have to be like those in Amos's DAY
[1:08:57] WHERE THERE'S A FAMINE NOT OF FOOD AND
[1:08:59] DRINK BUT of hearing the word of God.
[1:09:00] And they shall run from the east to the
[1:09:02] NORTH TO THE SOUTH AND HUNT FOR THE WORD
[1:09:04] OF GOD AND THEY WON'T FIND IT. AMEN. BUT
[1:09:06] WE DON'T HAVE TO HUNT. ALL WE HAVE TO DO
[1:09:08] IS STAND STILL AND EAT WHAT HE'S POURED
[1:09:10] OUT UPON US. WHAT HE'S GIVEN TO US, WHAT
[1:09:12] THE GREAT husbandman and shepherd has
[1:09:14] provided for his sheep. AND HE'S ONLY
[1:09:16] ASKED YOU TO DO ONE THING.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; STAND STILL AND EAT.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; DON'T RUN AROUND. DON'T GO CRAZY. AMEN.
[1:09:24] DON'T TRY TO FIX ANYTHING. DON'T GO TRY
[1:09:26] TO FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN. JUST STAND
[1:09:28] STILL AND EAT WHAT I'VE GIVEN YOU.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'LL GROW FAT AND HEALTHY.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Listen friends, ALL WE'VE GOT TO
[1:09:39] DO IS CRACK open another barrel. When
[1:09:41] you wake up IN THE MORNING, CRACK up
[1:09:42] another barrel of that food that's been
[1:09:44] stored.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Because there'll be a time it's needed.
[1:09:47] Now's the time it's needed.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; What is that word of God going to do?
[1:09:52] Grow us into the stature
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; of the image of Christ. to grow us into
[1:09:56] the head and all things which is Christ
[1:09:58] to make us a joint that fits into the
[1:10:00] body that supplies for the needs of the
[1:10:02] everything we have need of is going to
[1:10:04] be accomplished by this word that we're
[1:10:06] eating on.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; God doesn't need us to run all over and
[1:10:12] come up with our own food,
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; He gave us a seven course menu
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Come and dine." The master
[1:10:21] calleth,
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; "Come and dine."
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't put us in a works
[1:10:26] program to accomplish a bunch of things.
[1:10:28] It'll all be accomplished by the diet
[1:10:30] that we eat.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And the diet we eat, listen, it's
[1:10:34] already genetically in your soul to be
[1:10:37] whatever he wants you to be.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; All you need is good spiritual nutrition
[1:10:42] to meet your genetic potential.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; That's all you need.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; The genetic potential is already placed
[1:10:50] there from before the foundation of the
[1:10:52] world. All it needs is to grow and all
[1:10:55] it needs is nutrition. Amen. Vitamins,
[1:10:58] minerals, nutrition, calories so that it
[1:11:00] can grow to its full potential. What is
[1:11:02] it you and I need? We need to re we need
[1:11:05] to realize who we are and what God has
[1:11:08] given us. And we need to hold still and
[1:11:10] eat this message and keep eating this
[1:11:12] message and keep going to the storehouse
[1:11:14] and keep cracking it open and becoming
[1:11:16] what we were always meant to become by
[1:11:18] feeding on the best food.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; That's available. That's right.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of things we can eat
[1:11:24] spiritually and we can feed our minds.
[1:11:26] Amen. But those are the those are
[1:11:28] Twinkies and Hostess cakes and all the
[1:11:30] things that's killing us spiritually.
[1:11:32] AMEN. BUT GOD GAVE US something that'll
[1:11:34] give us life and sustain us and grow us.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; What do we need to do? Eat it.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; What were they supposed to do with the
[1:11:44] open book?
[1:11:45] Read the Bible and tell me what you're
[1:11:47] supposed to do with the open book.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Eat it. Amen.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; And after you eat it, you prophesy
[1:11:53] again. It'll bring you into what you're
[1:11:55] supposed to be.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for a seven course menu.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that I was invited to
[1:12:05] the feast.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful somebody was shaking the
[1:12:10] bushes and found me.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And said, "You want to come and
[1:12:14] eat?" And I happened to be hungrier than
[1:12:17] I thought I was. Yeah.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; I thought I was fine.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; I thought I had good food. Didn't
[1:12:25] realize I was malnourished. I didn't
[1:12:26] realize I was spiritually anemic. I
[1:12:29] didn't realize I was dying and I was
[1:12:30] riddled with all kinds of spiritual
[1:12:32] diseases. Amen. But when I saw the
[1:12:34] banquet set and I began to taste the
[1:12:35] food, it was the best tasting thing I
[1:12:37] ever put in my mouth. And I kept eating
[1:12:39] it, it kept changing me and changing me
[1:12:41] and changing me. And guess what,
[1:12:43] friends? The more healthy food you eat,
[1:12:45] the more healthy food you want to eat.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The more junk food you eat, the
[1:12:49] more junk food you want to eat.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; I mean, this isn't rocket science. We've
[1:12:54] all figured this out at this point.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we have the privilege of
[1:12:59] having ministers in our home from all
[1:13:00] over the world. Amen. And they come from
[1:13:02] Europe and Africa and India, and we've
[1:13:04] had them from all over the world. Amen.
[1:13:06] And those of a western culture, Western
[1:13:08] society, those in Europe and and
[1:13:10] Australia and all that, they can they
[1:13:12] can eat what we eat and then go right
[1:13:13] along with it. But you know those who
[1:13:15] are used to eating nutritious, healthy,
[1:13:18] organic food, those from northern India
[1:13:21] and those folks from Africa, they don't
[1:13:23] like our food at all.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; And they can't wait to go home and get
[1:13:28] their food. They're so used to eating
[1:13:30] real food. They they don't like
[1:13:33] something that you open a package and
[1:13:35] pull out tastes horrible to them.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; They don't like it. You try to give them
[1:13:41] a treat, something, and you and you peel
[1:13:42] open a package and you pull it out. The
[1:13:44] first time they taste it, it doesn't
[1:13:46] taste good to them.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they eat real
[1:13:50] food.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; I want to eat so much real food that the
[1:13:56] world's entertainment doesn't taste good
[1:13:58] to me.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; I want to eat healthy vegetables. I want
[1:14:01] to eat the prettiest carrots and the
[1:14:03] healthiest vegetables you've ever seen
[1:14:05] until I lose a desire to taste of the
[1:14:08] world. Amen. We can make we can make
[1:14:10] some kind of uh uh commitments and New
[1:14:12] Year's resolutions and we're not going
[1:14:14] to go to media and we're going to we're
[1:14:16] going to do this. We're going to take a
[1:14:17] timeout and I'm not I'm only going to
[1:14:18] limit myself TO 5 MINUTES A DAY. LISTEN,
[1:14:21] THAT'S NOT GOING to work because the
[1:14:22] more you eat it, the more you want it.
[1:14:24] The more bad food, more fast food, more
[1:14:26] processed, the more you want. And you
[1:14:27] start to crave it. And the more media
[1:14:29] you partake of and the more
[1:14:30] entertainment you entertain your your
[1:14:32] spirit with, the more it wants. But you
[1:14:34] just come back to this feast and start
[1:14:36] eating the organic, non-hybrid, original
[1:14:39] food, and you start to lose the taste
[1:14:41] for everything else.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; I went off sugar for a little while. I I
[1:14:48] I backslid.
[1:14:52] I I have to admit,
[1:14:55] but when I went off for a couple months,
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; the next time I ate a dessert, it tasted
[1:14:59] bitter.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; It was so sweet. It was bitter.
[1:15:04] That's how much my taste adjusted.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh God, adjust my spiritual
[1:15:10] taste to where the only thing that
[1:15:12] tastes good is what's real, what's
[1:15:14] original, what's the original seed, the
[1:15:16] original grain." You know, they got all
[1:15:18] these heirloom grains now. They're
[1:15:19] trying to go back to the before it was
[1:15:22] hybridized, before it was uh genetically
[1:15:24] modified. We go to heirloom. Hey,
[1:15:26] listen. I got heirloom grain. Amen. It's
[1:15:28] been brought back. Amen. the original
[1:15:31] faith of the fathers, the original
[1:15:32] teaching of the apostles. We've got the
[1:15:34] heirloom grain,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; We got the non-leaven bread. We've been
[1:15:39] given everything we need. Let's just eat
[1:15:41] it, friends.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Eat it and enjoy it and keep eating it
[1:15:46] until it's the only thing that we want
[1:15:47] to eat. Praise be to God.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand. How many of you
[1:15:52] happy you got a seven course menu?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; How many are encouraged to keep eating?
[1:15:56] Amen.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Wake up in the morning, I can check the
[1:15:59] news or eat good food. I'm going to eat
[1:16:00] good food.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; It's not not evil to check the news, but
[1:16:06] you know, four four hours of news.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Is bad news.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; But four hours of the message isn't
[1:16:14] going to hurt you a bit.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so thankful that God's called
[1:16:22] me to be a calf of the stall.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] Not a wandering, aimless, needy,
[1:16:29] starving. Hey, listen. Remember remember
[1:16:31] uh Pharaoh's dream when Joseph was in
[1:16:33] captivity and Pharaoh had a dream that
[1:16:35] none of the wise men could tell him and
[1:16:37] he saw seven fat kind cows.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Seven fat and healthy. Fat was the word
[1:16:44] for healthy.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; And and and then coming up out of the
[1:16:49] river was was seven spindly. Amen. Weak.
[1:16:54] Amen. uh uh uh uh uh emaciated cattle
[1:16:57] and the seven emaciated cattle ate the
[1:17:00] fat cattle and he he wanted an
[1:17:02] interpretation for the dream and didn't
[1:17:03] have it. But but then Joseph come along
[1:17:06] and Joseph said, "This is the
[1:17:07] interpretation. You're going to have
[1:17:09] seven good years of harvest where you
[1:17:11] got good food and have plenty." That's
[1:17:13] what the seven fat kind represented. But
[1:17:15] then you're going to have seven years of
[1:17:16] famine. And the seven years of famine
[1:17:18] are going to eat up the seven good years
[1:17:20] because all those skinny cows ate the
[1:17:21] fat cows. And after they ate the fat
[1:17:24] cows, they were just as skinny as ever,
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; It didn't help them any
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; and everything would be lost. But what
[1:17:33] was his advice? His advice was store up
[1:17:36] the grain in the good years. Amen. To
[1:17:39] sustain you through the bad years. Amen.
[1:17:41] That's what God told Brother Brandham to
[1:17:42] do. Store up these vegetables. You're
[1:17:44] going to need it in the future. Amen.
[1:17:46] Our Joseph is Christ. Amen. And he's the
[1:17:49] one who controls the grain. And now in
[1:17:51] that day when you go to get grain, you
[1:17:53] had to go to Joseph. And Joseph is
[1:17:55] Christ. And Joseph is sitting on the
[1:17:58] grainery and he's GOT ALL THE GRAIN,
[1:18:00] AMEN, OF THE SEVEN CHURCHES, ALL THE
[1:18:02] ORIGINAL teaching of the seven thunders.
[1:18:04] And he's READY TO DISH IT OUT TO WHOEVER
[1:18:06] will come to him to receive it.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; And remember his brethren tried TO COME
[1:18:11] AND BUY IT. AMEN. HE WOULD SELL IT TO
[1:18:13] EVERYBODY ELSE. BUT EVERY TIME HIS
[1:18:15] BRETHREN TRIED TO BUY IT, HE PUT THEIR
[1:18:17] MONEY back in their sack. HE SAID,
[1:18:18] "YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PAY FOR THIS. THIS
[1:18:19] IS FREE FOR YOU. And then he says, YOU
[1:18:22] COME DOWN TO GOAN. I'M GOING TO FEED
[1:18:24] YOU. I'M GOING TO SUSTAIN YOU. I'M GOING
[1:18:26] TO KEEP YOU HEALTHY. OH, PRAISE GOD.
[1:18:28] JOSEPH HAS BROUGHT US IN GOAN and he has
[1:18:31] the storehouse and he's sustaining us.
[1:18:33] He's keeping us. He's feeding us out of
[1:18:35] the grainery.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Just eat and live, my friends.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. eat and have life and strength and
[1:18:47] vitality and be all that we're supposed
[1:18:49] to be by eating the message. All our
[1:18:52] efforts are going to fail. All of our
[1:18:54] attempts, all of our trying, it'll come
[1:18:56] to not. But if we just keep eating the
[1:18:58] word, the word will produce its own
[1:19:00] life. It'll bring it'll bring life out
[1:19:03] of the seed that's in the soul.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Just keep eating, receiving, and it'll
[1:19:10] become all it was meant to be.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians, if you can come,
[1:19:14] please, brother Josiah, if you could
[1:19:16] come. Let's just bow our heads and thank
[1:19:18] God. Oh Lord Jesus, I'm so thankful for
[1:19:22] a seven course menu.
[1:19:25] A table that is spread with everything
[1:19:27] healthy that we need to become fully
[1:19:30] developed.
[1:19:32] God, there's been no other age that's
[1:19:34] had this table set. There's been no
[1:19:37] other age that's had the seven course
[1:19:40] meal. We couldn't come to it till the
[1:19:42] end of the seven church ages when you
[1:19:44] peeled back the veil. You opened the
[1:19:46] seals and you laid the table out with a
[1:19:48] seven course meal and a seven course
[1:19:50] menu.
[1:19:52] And God, help us to take advantage of
[1:19:55] the day we live in.
[1:19:58] God, for many wise men and many noble
[1:20:00] men and many prophets long to see this
[1:20:02] day,
[1:20:04] but God, here we are.
[1:20:06] How many prophets, how many of those in
[1:20:08] the church ages, how many of those
[1:20:10] mighty men that only had a portion of
[1:20:12] light and gave their life for it? How
[1:20:15] many of them would love to belly up to
[1:20:17] the table we eat at every day?
[1:20:20] God, help us not take it for granted,
[1:20:22] but to love it, to enjoy it, to feast at
[1:20:24] it, and to be calves of the stall.
[1:20:28] Help us, Lord, to stop running around
[1:20:30] and wasting time and wasting energy,
[1:20:33] but help us to stand still in the place
[1:20:35] where you've placed us and feed to
[1:20:38] receive the portion that you're
[1:20:40] portioning out in this day. And may it
[1:20:43] bring us into full development and full
[1:20:45] health.
[1:20:46] We love you, Lord, and we thank you for
[1:20:48] all you've given to us. God, how could
[1:20:51] we ever thank you enough for the day and
[1:20:53] hour we live in, for eyes to see and
[1:20:55] ears to hear, and for an appetite that
[1:20:57] you give us to eat your word.
[1:21:00] God, how thankful I am that there's so
[1:21:04] many barrelfuls of good food that are
[1:21:07] available to me.
[1:21:09] God, tomorrow morning I can turn on a
[1:21:12] message and crack open a barrel load, a
[1:21:15] tape load of good, healthy food. God,
[1:21:19] I'm so thankful. Help us, Lord, to feed
[1:21:22] and help us to rest and help us to
[1:21:24] trust.
[1:21:25] And God, may you bring us to the place
[1:21:28] you've ordained us to be by the diet
[1:21:31] that you're feeding us. We love you. We
[1:21:33] ask your blessings over this as we go
[1:21:35] our way. May you help us, Lord. In Jesus
[1:21:39] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God

[1:32:07] God.
[1:32:09] Fill my cup.
[1:32:12] Feed my soul
[1:32:15] with thy word.
[1:32:22] Fill my cup,
[1:32:25] Lord.
[1:32:28] I lift it up.
[1:32:34] Come and quench
[1:32:39] this thirsty
[1:32:41] of my soul.
[1:32:47] Bread of heaven,
[1:32:51] feed me till I overflow.
[1:32:59] Here's my cup.
[1:33:02] Fill it up and make me whole.
