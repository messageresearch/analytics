[7:38] father
[7:39] so we ask these things in the name of
[7:41] the lord jesus christ
[7:43] amen amen
[7:45] god bless you all and i think while
[7:46] we're standing let's open the word of
[7:48] the lord
[7:50] i mean and i would suggest in two
[7:53] portions of the scripture genesis
[7:55] chapter 18.
[7:58] and
[7:59] verse 14 genesis 18 where thank you for
[8:02] your musicians truly appreciate
[8:04] genesis 8
[8:06] 18 verse 14
[8:09] is anything too hard for the lord
[8:13] at the time appointed i will return unto
[8:15] thee according to the time of life and
[8:18] sarah shall have a son
[8:20] then sarah denied saying i loved not and
[8:22] for she was afraid and he said nigh but
[8:26] thou didst love and the man arose from
[8:29] dance and looked towards sodom and
[8:31] abraham went with them to bring them on
[8:33] the way and the lord said shall i hide
[8:36] from abraham the thing
[8:38] which i do
[8:39] seeing
[8:40] that abraham shall surely become a great
[8:43] and mighty nation and all the nations of
[8:46] the earth shall be blessed in him
[8:50] today we could we could say should god
[8:52] hide anything from the bride knowing she
[8:54] goes into the rapture there's no way
[8:57] no way you know
[8:58] i mean in
[8:59] in romans chapter
[9:01] uh
[9:02] romans chapter 1 verse 16
[9:06] romans chapter 1 verse 16.
[9:11] in the new testament
[9:14] for
[9:15] i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ
[9:20] for it is the power of god unto
[9:22] salvation to everyone that believeth
[9:26] to the jews first and also to the greek
[9:30] for daring is the righteousness of god
[9:33] revealed
[9:34] and here we see the righteousness of god
[9:37] revealed from faith to faith as it is
[9:40] written the just shall live by faith
[9:44] may the lord add his blessing to the
[9:45] reading of his word we may be seated
[9:49] now i greet you all in the wonderful
[9:51] name of the lord jesus christ
[9:53] and it's certainly a great honor for me
[9:55] to start these services today i'm back

[10:45] threat he said i am a berliner and
[10:48] germans never forgot that you know never

[11:24] most noble brother shambo i'm very
[11:26] interested to listen about your brother
[11:27] shem you got rich you bless you richly
[11:29] your church that came and
[11:31] all of you and i will not name um all of
[11:35] you all of the friends after all these
[11:37] years 20 years now when i came here with
[11:39] the music manipulation it was exactly 20
[11:42] or 2001
[11:43] in the time of our brother lonnie and

[11:59] didn't forget all the greetings from
[12:01] germany and
[12:03] yes may the lord richly bless you and uh
[12:06] i start directly into the word is that
[12:07] fine for you
[12:09] directly entering and i'm i'm sometimes
[12:11] saying this that i'm sure i'm not
[12:14] offending your feelings because because
[12:16] we we are
[12:17] we know one another too long that we
[12:19] know a little bit how we work and what
[12:21] we think and what we believe
[12:24] but the message that we believe does not
[12:26] come from america
[12:28] it comes from the presence of god
[12:30] it was it was a man from jefferson will
[12:32] preaching it but it comes from our
[12:34] father
[12:35] the message of the hour is not a
[12:37] doctrine
[12:38] it is not a book of do's and don'ts it's
[12:41] it's our father talking to us
[12:44] and we understand that language because
[12:46] we were in him
[12:48] we understand and others don't
[12:49] understand that language but we
[12:51] understand his language
[12:52] and we understand it went from the
[12:54] messenger to the message
[12:56] it went from the prophet to the prophecy
[12:59] somebody and we have seen the effect of
[13:01] this message in our life
[13:03] we see this message has transforming
[13:06] power
[13:06] a person came to me and he spoke about
[13:08] brother branham and about the bridge and
[13:10] how much people fell from that bridge i
[13:12] said brother honestly you come too late
[13:15] honestly you come to really
[13:17] we are not staying with william brennan
[13:19] we went from the messenger to the
[13:20] message
[13:21] we have seen already the effect we are
[13:23] pregnanted with the word of the lord
[13:25] honestly we're too late for dates and
[13:27] facts and doubt you're too late for this
[13:30] and and so we are very very thankful
[13:32] and and uh here's a question that comes
[13:35] to brother branham and uh you know i'm
[13:37] i'm a german but me and technique there
[13:39] are two words worlds that now come
[13:41] together yeah here we go
[13:44] okay here we go really um
[13:47] as i said in the beginning
[13:49] uh as i'm a german
[13:51] um it is i can always hide
[13:54] please understand that i'm not finding
[13:56] always the right words you know i will
[13:59] not go into a doctrine this evening okay
[14:02] but i would like to share a vision
[14:05] okay because please understand one or
[14:07] two services is not enough to explain a
[14:10] doctrine
[14:11] no we cannot never show the balance in
[14:13] all things we cannot bring all i
[14:16] wouldn't do this i would even start
[14:18] about that you know because i'm mixed up
[14:20] anyhow i leave more questions than
[14:21] answers you know but i would like to
[14:23] give a vision about certain things okay
[14:26] and
[14:27] i can hide very very fine behind my
[14:29] german accent because years ago when i
[14:32] was here
[14:33] i i went into the church and the alarm
[14:36] went on so the sheriff came
[14:39] and it seems to happen different times
[14:40] by the chair that the sheriff because he
[14:42] was quite upset and i was the only one
[14:45] that he had his dogs and his shares and
[14:46] whatever and i could just say uh me from
[14:50] germany
[14:50] [Music]
[14:52] so i got
[14:53] he felt sorry for me and he
[14:56] you know i had grace in the side of his
[14:58] eyes so so
[15:00] but please please keep in mind take what
[15:02] i want to say okay and sometimes if i
[15:05] miss expressing myself you have to
[15:07] understand my heart okay i'm missing
[15:09] sometimes some some words okay
[15:11] i always tell this um
[15:13] um i i know how to speak spanish you
[15:15] know but i i always say because i'm
[15:17] sometimes go in those countries but i
[15:19] said i will never preach in spanish
[15:21] because i will make a split in the
[15:22] church just because of my grammar so
[15:25] i keep these things off english is
[15:27] enough
[15:28] but you have to have a little bit of
[15:30] grace for me and
[15:31] let's let's let's answer a question that
[15:33] might
[15:34] let's might help us
[15:37] because what i fear and what i really do
[15:39] not understand how can we be in the
[15:41] message of the hour and we fear the
[15:43] rapture
[15:46] how can we how can we fearing
[15:50] the thing which is part of us
[15:53] i mean
[15:54] it seems we did not understand really
[15:56] who we are
[15:57] it seems we we overlooked something
[16:00] because once you understand you are that
[16:02] rapture
[16:04] it's at least in you
[16:06] i mean never forget what we talk about
[16:08] at church there is a divine part
[16:11] but there is a human part and we have to
[16:14] cover both it's divinity in humanity
[16:17] that's so important huh here's the
[16:19] question to brother branham
[16:21] um you you say how brother marcus how
[16:23] could you can you say that we are we are
[16:25] the rapture the for example resurrection
[16:28] it was an event and it was a person
[16:31] jesus said i am the resurrection
[16:34] the rapture is an event we're waiting
[16:36] still for it we're in it we're in the
[16:38] cycle yes but the rapture is a person
[16:41] it's a manifestation of a person okay
[16:44] so please explain the mystery of the
[16:47] translation of the bride just a change
[16:51] see
[16:52] our bodies now let's say our you know
[16:54] what i mean when i say that i don't mean
[16:56] to be sacrilegious i don't mean to say
[16:59] ours i don't mean to say this church i
[17:02] mean to say to every believer abraham he
[17:04] was looking for a promised son that was
[17:07] promised him as is it right and the
[17:09] church is looking for a promised son the
[17:12] bride is that right the bride is looking
[17:15] for the promised son before the promised
[17:16] son could come to sarah and abraham
[17:19] their bodies had to be changed is that
[17:22] right
[17:23] she was too old to have a baby she had
[17:25] no milk veins in her breast her breast
[17:28] was dried up her womb was wasn't fertile
[17:30] she was sterile steroid she could not
[17:34] have a baby her heart was too old to
[17:36] stand labor so what happened god changed
[17:39] her her back to a young woman
[17:42] and he did abraham to abraham the same
[17:44] thing because he said his body was as
[17:46] good as that see and he had to change
[17:49] their body in order to receive the
[17:51] promised son and we cannot receive the
[17:53] promised son that promised us today in
[17:57] these bodies
[17:58] that we live in these bodies our sin
[18:03] i skipped something out of that quote he
[18:06] said so potentially it's in here and
[18:09] what is it the word promised before the
[18:12] foundation of the world and around there
[18:15] there is only reflects the negative
[18:18] that will reflect the positive the word
[18:20] see
[18:21] and the same thing is or the translation
[18:24] of the bride will be the same thing
[18:27] the word that's in you the body will
[18:29] materialize around that word
[18:32] and that same thing did by sarah
[18:35] before when the old body that she had
[18:38] the first body it had to be changed in
[18:40] order to produce the sun you get it
[18:42] that body could not do it this body
[18:44] cannot do it so it will have to be
[18:46] changed the same way to receive the sun
[18:51] so so we see there is a word laying in
[18:55] us
[18:56] it does not come by our own education
[19:00] it is laid by our father into us
[19:04] uh
[19:05] the psalm said he even laid
[19:08] eternity into our hearts
[19:11] eternity is himself
[19:13] blessed be the name of the lord so
[19:15] instead let's start our little journey
[19:18] we start in
[19:19] in jerusalem
[19:22] with the early church
[19:24] here we have peter
[19:26] speaking to the first church
[19:29] and we start with a big misunderstanding
[19:33] which became a dogma but which
[19:37] was hold hold up held up until this day
[19:42] the latin phrase extra ecclesia nu la
[19:46] salus means
[19:48] outside the church there is no salvation
[19:52] this expression is an axiom often used
[19:55] as shorthand for the doctrine that the
[19:58] church is necessary for salvation
[20:00] it is a dogma in the catholic church and
[20:03] the eastern orthodox church in reference
[20:06] to their own communions
[20:08] so that is what brother branham
[20:11] understood
[20:13] and he was the one bringing us from
[20:16] church thinking to word thinking
[20:20] denomination thinks in church terms
[20:24] we think about a family
[20:26] about a mystical body
[20:28] which is bigger than my local assembly
[20:31] which is fine
[20:33] but one of these days our doors will be
[20:35] closed and we will still continue to go
[20:37] on
[20:38] this will be the name of the lord
[20:40] and
[20:41] and and and and it's so important once
[20:44] you understand you cannot enter into a
[20:47] cult or a denomination
[20:50] you understand who you are you come from
[20:52] a family
[20:53] you come from his mind
[20:55] you are just expressed here
[20:57] nobody can preach you in
[21:00] and nobody can preach you out
[21:02] i'm not depending on the favors of my
[21:05] brothers and sisters though i need it
[21:08] because i have to respect god in you
[21:12] but we're not we're not depending on our
[21:14] eternal salvation of somebody's opinion
[21:17] about us
[21:19] we come from his mind and we go back to
[21:20] his mind
[21:22] blessed be the name of the lord
[21:24] so here the church starts
[21:26] and we have the birth of the church 80
[21:30] 33
[21:32] and we have the beginning of the first
[21:34] age 80 53
[21:37] so we have 20 years in between and
[21:39] brother bryan let's say in my own word
[21:41] in the resume of the church ages he said
[21:43] he said my own words when the first
[21:45] church eight started she was already a
[21:48] fallen woman
[21:48] [Music]
[21:50] it took 20 years
[21:52] exactly the first
[21:53] h start we have 20 years and brother
[21:57] bran uses this many times since 20 years
[22:00] we are here it's not a denomination yet
[22:01] he refers to its beginning so something
[22:04] happens in the in the years between 33
[22:07] and 53
[22:09] that means the birth of the church was
[22:10] on the day of pentecost that is exactly
[22:13] so
[22:14] then the conversion of the apostle paul
[22:16] in acts chapter 9 was later
[22:19] now as paul was not on the day of
[22:22] pentecost brother branham was not in
[22:23] azusa street
[22:25] came later
[22:27] that's important because brother brain
[22:29] said they call me to me to be a man born
[22:32] out of season
[22:34] both it had to be so both could fall
[22:38] first pentecost fell the second eve fell
[22:41] and pentecost 1906 fell
[22:44] so my question is why should i go back
[22:46] to something that fell in the beginning
[22:49] though though we highly respect
[22:52] the birth of the church
[22:54] we highly respect and and so that there
[22:57] is no misunderstanding
[22:59] all these young people in the message
[23:01] you need the holy ghost
[23:04] you need a start
[23:06] you need a beginning you need a birth
[23:10] by the holy ghost
[23:11] but from that on you need a growth
[23:14] and not coming back to your birth every
[23:16] youth camp
[23:17] you have you need a growth but you have
[23:20] you need to have a beginning
[23:22] so what happens peter is in the house of
[23:25] cornelius
[23:26] now you have to understand one thing the
[23:29] first church never called themselves
[23:31] christians
[23:32] for them the coming of the holy ghost
[23:35] was part of the jewish tradition
[23:39] they felt
[23:40] that they are jewish
[23:43] they never they
[23:44] they even when the first church came
[23:46] together they came together in the
[23:48] temple
[23:49] in the hall of solomon but the heart of
[23:52] solomon was part of the old ancient
[23:54] temple
[23:55] and you remember when paul came to the
[23:58] to the early church
[24:00] that
[24:01] that that they told him you have to cut
[24:04] your hair you have to shave your hair
[24:05] and you have to bring offerings okay so
[24:08] the early church did not know what to do
[24:10] with jewish traditions
[24:13] because when peter
[24:15] entered into the house of cornelius
[24:18] which was agenda he said this
[24:21] and he said unto them you know
[24:24] how that it is an unlawful thing for a
[24:27] man that is a jew to keep company
[24:30] company or to come unto one another's
[24:32] nation but god has and so on how can
[24:35] peter say i'm a jew
[24:37] he has received the baptism of the holy
[24:39] ghost
[24:41] you understand but they called himself
[24:43] jews and when he entered into the house
[24:45] of cornelius the early church asked them
[24:47] how could you enter into a house of an
[24:50] uncircumcised
[24:52] you understand there were in reality the
[24:54] early church were messianic jews
[24:57] they had the holy ghost but their
[24:59] identification was still jew
[25:01] they thought this is the fulfillment of
[25:04] joel
[25:05] so the messiah comes and we will be real
[25:07] jews
[25:08] exactly they did not understand who were
[25:10] who they were
[25:12] so what happened is the first christians
[25:14] were called in antioch
[25:17] acts chapter 13.
[25:18] and here we have the great problem
[25:22] that paul is coming on the scene
[25:25] because there was a great
[25:27] dispute between both sides
[25:30] how to continue you have to understand
[25:31] one thing
[25:32] the jewish church at that at that time
[25:35] consisted of three kind of people
[25:38] one were real jews born to be jews
[25:42] jewish jewish religion was never in
[25:45] a religion of evangelization but you
[25:47] could join them if you want
[25:49] they call them proselytes
[25:52] proselytes were heathen who wanted to
[25:54] become jews
[25:56] okay so you just have to make your
[25:58] circumcision and then you become a jew
[26:00] you're proselyte
[26:01] and you have the third group they are
[26:04] just how you call uh they are they
[26:06] they're sympathizing with that religion
[26:09] okay they said we like it we love the
[26:12] honesty we like the moral standard but
[26:14] we don't want to become circumcised
[26:17] that is the group that paul is referring
[26:19] to when he goes into those synagogues
[26:22] they are sympathizing with jewish
[26:23] religion but don't want to become real
[26:25] jews so they he can now show another way
[26:28] jesus christ
[26:30] that is important for example take as an
[26:32] example of our time uh we all know
[26:34] marilyn monroe marilyn monroe became a
[26:36] jew because she married arthur miller
[26:39] okay so you can become a jew if you want
[26:41] but not by birth but by
[26:44] different different other things
[26:46] the first church had the great problem
[26:49] that some of these first christians
[26:52] were former jews
[26:54] for them the torah was still the torah
[26:58] sabbas was still sabbath and they even
[27:01] said yes but jesus said i did not come
[27:03] to abolish law but to fulfill all law
[27:07] but paul brought in gentiles
[27:10] who never knew the torah
[27:12] and they asked the question
[27:14] torah for me that means nothing
[27:16] so you understand you know you now have
[27:18] a church where one says
[27:21] i mean
[27:22] we need circumcision because this is an
[27:25] eternal
[27:27] covenant
[27:28] amen
[27:30] and the other group says i mean why do i
[27:32] need jesus if i take circumcision i mean
[27:34] where's the point
[27:36] so so here we have a big problem to come
[27:38] together
[27:39] and and and paul understands the great
[27:42] great trouble
[27:44] so what happens is this they come
[27:46] together to what they call the council
[27:49] in jerusalem
[27:51] that was very clear in ad 49 the book of
[27:54] acts makes it makes it very very clear
[27:57] and the bible says it like this
[27:59] and certain man which came down from
[28:02] judea taught the brethren and said
[28:05] except you be circumcised after the
[28:07] manner of moses you cannot be saved
[28:10] and it says but there rose certain of
[28:13] the sect of the pharisees which believed
[28:16] there were converted pharisees
[28:18] into christianity but brought their
[28:21] pharisee thinking into it
[28:24] okay
[28:25] saying that it was needful to circumcise
[28:28] them and to command them to keep the law
[28:30] of moses so now they have brought their
[28:32] doctrinal problems to antioch
[28:35] now put on the spiritual jacket the
[28:37] first false doctrine came from jerusalem
[28:42] because it was brothers from judea
[28:46] i mean
[28:47] and it was people they were christians
[28:50] but having still jewish thinking they
[28:52] didn't understand the plan
[28:54] so now the church is into big conflicts
[28:57] do we keep
[28:59] moses law
[29:01] or is it isn't it
[29:03] important anyhow you have to understand
[29:05] like this let's for example we have you
[29:07] have a mixed marriage
[29:08] of a heathen christian and a jewish
[29:12] christian
[29:13] so the jewish christian said now today
[29:15] is shabbat
[29:17] it's the day of the lord we do nothing
[29:18] the heathen christian said this is
[29:20] saturday
[29:21] you have to repair the car you have to
[29:23] mow the yard
[29:24] he said no this is shabbat she said i
[29:26] mean what about your shabbat we have we
[29:28] follow jesus
[29:29] so it's it's it becomes a big problem
[29:32] what what what about the new generation
[29:34] shall that be circumcised
[29:37] the heathens would say on white
[29:39] circumcision we believe in christ the
[29:41] jews would say no it is an eternal
[29:43] covenant with us so it was a quite a big
[29:45] big big big problem
[29:47] and what happened is
[29:49] they now came together in
[29:52] the
[29:53] what they call the jerusalem council
[29:57] and they had to speak
[29:58] now god doesn't make mistakes
[30:01] the main man was
[30:04] paul
[30:05] but paul was still under the shadow of
[30:07] barnabas so when the bible always says
[30:09] barnabas and paul because barnabas
[30:12] brought him to christianity
[30:14] what happened is
[30:16] the bible says d all the multitude
[30:19] multitudes kept silence and gave
[30:21] audience to barnabas and paul declaring
[30:24] what miracles and wonders god had
[30:26] wrought among the gentiles by them now i
[30:29] want you to put on your spiritual
[30:30] jackets
[30:32] peter was the one with the key
[30:35] peter was the one who could say
[30:37] i was with brother brennan
[30:40] and he told me so i was with jesus
[30:43] personally
[30:44] i mean i mean i am the one that he said
[30:48] you have the key
[30:50] he was the far most prominent of all
[30:54] peter was the spokesman on the day of
[30:56] pentecost
[30:58] if somebody had to say something it was
[31:00] peter
[31:01] i mean i mean he was there
[31:03] when jesus appeared to to the disciples
[31:06] different different times
[31:07] peter is the man when he speak when he
[31:10] stands up the church is silent
[31:13] what peter but he has a problem
[31:16] peter is not the angel of the church
[31:19] the angel is paul
[31:22] so peter speaks but paul has the vision
[31:26] [Applause]
[31:27] you understand
[31:28] because brother brahman said the angel
[31:30] of the church catches the mystery for
[31:32] the church
[31:34] but but i want i want to give you a
[31:36] compliment
[31:38] the first church fell
[31:41] though they had the holy ghost but they
[31:42] were yet just born
[31:44] you remember that brother brandon that
[31:46] god says to brother branham you cannot
[31:48] teach pentecost the baby supernatural
[31:50] thing
[31:51] that means they are born again
[31:54] because you cannot be a baby without
[31:55] born again but from that day on you must
[31:57] grow in your vision
[32:00] therefore
[32:01] new birth and adoption is two phases
[32:04] no if you put it in one you you will mix
[32:07] up the whole plan of god
[32:08] one is the birth one is the adoption
[32:11] exactly
[32:12] the placing it's enough in it for me
[32:14] it's not another coming of the holy
[32:15] spirit but it's a placing that's what
[32:18] the prophets it's a placing
[32:20] one is the birth one is a real place
[32:22] it's a process
[32:24] okay
[32:25] okay please don't preach or say if you
[32:28] got the holy ghost you got it
[32:30] you got the beginning of it
[32:32] and from then on go on okay
[32:34] take your inheritance grow and okay so
[32:37] we have a spokesman
[32:39] amen and we have an angel
[32:42] and the problem of the church was
[32:45] they did not receive their messenger
[32:49] therefore about the premise preaches the
[32:51] message recognizing the messenger and
[32:54] its message amen
[32:57] blessed be the name of the lord because
[32:58] they were listed they were focused on
[33:00] peter not even peter knew who paul was
[33:04] for them paul was just a nice missionary
[33:08] for us he was the messenger
[33:11] i mean now if we would be there and they
[33:13] would have that great council of
[33:14] discussions and debate and we could be
[33:16] transformed in time and i would be we'll
[33:19] be there i would i would say gentlemen
[33:21] stop your discussion the angel is here
[33:24] so stop i mean stop your brother's
[33:26] meeting
[33:27] all your opinion here is paul he's the
[33:29] angel of the church age
[33:32] but as they didn't under because the
[33:34] bible never said and everybody sat down
[33:36] and paul stood up and they said oh we
[33:38] understand he was the angel they didn't
[33:40] recognize him till the end
[33:43] therefore it was easy for satan to
[33:44] deceive eve once again
[33:46] it doesn't take away their new birth
[33:49] but you understand if somebody says we
[33:51] have to go back in the beginning i
[33:53] always say what do you mean by that
[33:55] but because we recognized our messenger
[33:57] in our and the message for the age can
[34:00] you say amen
[34:01] so it was quite a difficult and and and
[34:04] and when you understand when paul speaks
[34:07] about galatians he he is cheating a
[34:10] little bit he doesn't give the same
[34:11] results
[34:12] like it is written in the book of acts
[34:15] paul is the only one he's sitting there
[34:17] he said i can give the answer but
[34:20] nobody's listening to me
[34:22] okay
[34:23] blessed be the name of the lord so he
[34:26] they find out that they say okay peter
[34:28] you take care of the church in jerusalem
[34:30] let me and let me go outside
[34:31] because these people were programmed on
[34:33] peter
[34:36] so what happens is therefore paul said
[34:39] some are keeping feasts very high
[34:41] especially holy days
[34:43] some are not keeping them at all what
[34:46] does he say we have two groups some have
[34:48] jewish background
[34:50] and some have heathen background gentile
[34:52] background
[34:53] exactly so therefore he says
[34:56] he says
[34:57] there's only one thing i know it's the
[34:59] cross of christ
[35:01] it's a cross of a at at calvary that's
[35:04] what he's writing to that's what is he
[35:05] writing to the romans okay
[35:08] i'm just reading it again
[35:10] he sees all the discussions about
[35:13] closings about about about about food
[35:16] about shabbat about moses law and he
[35:19] said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[35:21] christ for it's the power of god unto
[35:23] salvation to everyone that believes the
[35:25] jews first and also to the greek
[35:28] or the gender in other words he said we
[35:29] need something which we have in common
[35:33] okay okay you have to live that way and
[35:36] they will live that way but we have one
[35:37] thing in common the cross of jesus
[35:39] christ
[35:40] exactly so
[35:41] this becomes very very important for us
[35:44] because
[35:46] paul then starts his own church
[35:48] uh the church in ephesus
[35:51] 8053 you know we see later there is
[35:54] another conflict between peter and paul
[35:57] and
[35:58] peter begins to dawn
[36:00] he cannot bring it into word peter never
[36:02] writes in his episode look
[36:04] paul is the angel he doesn't see it
[36:07] but he can see paul speak things that
[36:09] seems to be right
[36:11] very deep we don't understand we say aim
[36:13] into things that we don't understand
[36:15] but it sounds good
[36:18] in peter there is a changing of
[36:21] dispensation
[36:23] he is first a man peter and peter
[36:26] understand no no here's somebody
[36:28] i don't fully see his position but he
[36:30] has more than me myself that's
[36:31] tremendous
[36:33] that is the holy ghost in peter
[36:35] to acknowledge another gift
[36:38] therefore i have so much problems with
[36:41] what we believe in the message today the
[36:43] man of the hour
[36:45] i mean i mean who is the man of the hour
[36:47] christ is the man of the year
[36:49] hey we are brothers
[36:50] we're sisters we're family
[36:53] we're family of god okay there's no need
[36:56] for us to become arrogant
[36:58] because we have no message of ourselves
[37:01] as a father is the head of his own home
[37:03] a pastor is the head of his own church
[37:06] the messengers the head of the whole
[37:07] church age and christ is the head of all
[37:09] messengers
[37:11] i was asked the question brother marcus
[37:12] is has somebody the right to correct the
[37:15] prophet i said yes god
[37:19] god is the head above all prophets all
[37:22] messengers are in his hand he can
[37:23] correct who he wants
[37:25] blessed be the name of the lord and then
[37:27] brother brahm said there will be a
[37:29] people who will be the final voice for
[37:31] the final age
[37:33] under their messenger
[37:35] they will not have a message for
[37:36] themselves
[37:38] but you see this is the beginning and
[37:40] now we're starting
[37:41] about about
[37:43] about
[37:44] about
[37:45] something that that that is
[37:48] so contrary to the justice of god we
[37:50] have now here
[37:51] a type
[37:53] on the exodus and brother branham makes
[37:55] clear he said every redemption has two
[37:59] parts
[38:00] it's coming out and going in
[38:03] now i want you to put on the spiritual
[38:05] record to answer the question of brother
[38:07] branham about the word being in us
[38:10] and i would like to show how we are
[38:12] standing in our own way
[38:14] because we came to this message as
[38:16] pentecostals or as lutherans or holiness
[38:19] movement or or whatever we were but we
[38:22] many times see the message through the
[38:23] glasses of a former denomination
[38:26] and god takes many many years to take
[38:28] these things out
[38:29] look here they come one in a million
[38:31] what was the test they all drink in the
[38:34] same rock
[38:35] they all eat the same spiritual manner
[38:37] as we are eating this morning but the
[38:39] word tests prove them
[38:41] when they come to the time of cadiz
[38:43] bernier when they started over into the
[38:45] promised land and they could not go over
[38:47] till they was tested by the words
[38:50] and all the other ten came back and said
[38:53] we can't make it
[38:55] the people are like we are like
[38:57] grasshoppers to them they're great wall
[38:59] city the opposition is too great
[39:02] but joshua and caleb stealed the people
[39:04] they said we are more than able to do it
[39:07] why
[39:08] god said before they left the promised
[39:10] land i have given you the land i've
[39:12] given it to you it's yours but there are
[39:15] one out of each billion
[39:18] now you see i think it's in third book
[39:20] of of of moses god says this
[39:24] you keep sir several feasts but one is
[39:27] the feast of
[39:29] unleavened breath bread
[39:31] and god says this
[39:33] i want you to
[39:36] have that feast
[39:37] when you come in your promised land
[39:41] in other words god says you come in your
[39:43] promised land
[39:45] they said we don't make it god said you
[39:47] come in your promised land
[39:50] they said the opposition is too big god
[39:53] says you come in your promised land
[39:55] they said our our families brother rem
[39:58] said they thought our wives will not
[39:59] make it our children will not make it
[40:01] god says i've given you the land
[40:04] god said did you listen what i told you
[40:06] when you come and you god says
[40:08] if you go into the rapture you do this
[40:10] lord i don't know if i make the rapture
[40:12] because if you go into the rapture you
[40:13] do this not if but when you go
[40:17] i mean we say i i don't know about the
[40:19] rapture god but i know
[40:21] because i saw you behind the curtain of
[40:23] time
[40:25] amen we say yes but but but but i don't
[40:28] know if i make a godsend i gave it to
[40:29] you okay
[40:32] and and god says i give and people say
[40:34] yes but i don't know if i'm making got
[40:36] it but i make it for you okay
[40:38] i
[40:39] i give it to you and we say but i know
[40:41] if i make it i give it to you and this
[40:44] was the word test
[40:47] this was the word do you believe god or
[40:50] do you believe yourself
[40:53] because if i ask somebody here who feels
[40:56] to be worthy for the rapture nobody
[40:58] would say amen
[41:00] and god says but i see something in you
[41:04] don't go after your feelings
[41:06] can you say amen
[41:10] amen
[41:11] so i want to talk to people who say the
[41:14] rapture from me
[41:16] is just the next station that i will
[41:18] take and we would think from our
[41:22] look we have a lutheran approach
[41:25] it's it's we must be humble
[41:28] brothers and sisters let me put off my
[41:29] shoes to show how humble i am
[41:32] and then we would say the rapture i i
[41:35] don't know if i'm worthy
[41:38] and this looks and people love this so
[41:40] much
[41:41] but here's the bride who says we make it
[41:45] why god saw
[41:47] do you understand when brother brahman
[41:49] said quick healing power let me look
[41:51] behind the curtain of time and i saw all
[41:53] of you there
[41:56] and i said that's for me
[41:58] can you say amen and for us it's
[42:01] arrogance it's not it's believing god
[42:05] that was the word chest
[42:08] can you say amen do you believe yourself
[42:10] or do you believe what god says about
[42:12] you
[42:14] can you say amen so this was the test to
[42:18] enter
[42:19] into the promised land
[42:22] so god brings the same test in every
[42:25] church age
[42:27] he says a trumpet always denotes war the
[42:30] messenger the angel come on earth the
[42:33] messenger of the hour like luther's like
[42:35] any of the messengers that would have
[42:37] talked off what does he do he arrives
[42:41] a seal opened reveals a trumpet sound
[42:45] war declared away they go
[42:47] and then the messenger dies he
[42:50] seals away this group
[42:54] who the messenger
[42:56] they are put in a plague falls upon
[42:59] those who rejected it
[43:00] see and then it goes on then they
[43:03] organize get another organization
[43:07] do you remember that salvation is
[43:09] connected to the word of your age
[43:13] that's what the prophet said very very
[43:15] clear
[43:16] the messenger seals them
[43:19] and when they reject
[43:21] the the back is closed and you cannot
[43:23] come into
[43:25] we had a very prominent preacher and we
[43:28] will not certainly enter into that
[43:30] subject because i i'm behind another
[43:31] man's pulpit
[43:33] and he was asked a question a little bit
[43:34] like a trap brother son so do you
[43:36] believe the lamb left the mercy seat
[43:40] and and
[43:41] this is a critical question because in
[43:43] between or five minutes people put you
[43:45] in that box or in that box
[43:48] so so so and he was wise you know
[43:50] because people have a concept of a lamp
[43:52] sitting on a chair and when it stands up
[43:54] the mercy is over okay
[43:56] and he said this he says he said god is
[43:58] not changing his nature all the time god
[44:01] has god is love the question is who will
[44:04] have access one
[44:07] when to that throne of mercy
[44:09] who for whom will the door be opened and
[44:12] not
[44:13] right
[44:14] and i thought by myself that was that
[44:16] was really wonderful
[44:18] god is not changing his nature at every
[44:20] church age
[44:21] he is love
[44:23] do you know one thing when when when the
[44:25] rapture pass when the rapture is over
[44:28] the blood of calvary still works
[44:30] for who for the jews
[44:32] brother brahm said a new redemption is
[44:35] opened for the jews
[44:36] they will be saved under what with what
[44:40] for because of what because of the blood
[44:42] of calvary
[44:43] and when he died on that on on on on on
[44:46] calvary he had all his plan in his mind
[44:49] he paid the price when he said it is
[44:51] finished it was finished
[44:52] [Applause]
[44:54] therefore
[44:57] brother marcus is mercy over mercy is
[44:59] over and mercy is not over
[45:04] because because you have to think in
[45:06] dispensational terms and and individual
[45:10] terms
[45:11] look at this let me say let me say let
[45:13] me make it as an illustration to make it
[45:15] very simple for you now you have seven
[45:18] arrows okay in your back and you are
[45:20] right in the middle of africa and here
[45:22] comes the line
[45:24] and the line looks to you and you look
[45:26] to the line
[45:27] okay
[45:29] so i always say if it's a christian line
[45:31] he will just pray before he is looking
[45:33] to you okay
[45:34] so you took your first fledge
[45:36] goes away second
[45:38] third
[45:39] fourth fifth
[45:41] you know one thing i have two flesh over
[45:43] and remember when god sent a messenger
[45:46] he always sends a message for grace
[45:50] always
[45:51] god loves the world
[45:53] he sends wesley and he's and he thinks
[45:56] certainly god knows all things he says i
[45:59] want the world to understand who i am
[46:03] but they reject the message
[46:05] some are sealed under him
[46:07] but the rest is rejected
[46:10] then he the next flesh he sends wesley
[46:13] okay then he has one flesh still in his
[46:16] hands
[46:18] and he sends william brennan
[46:20] with a tremendous gift
[46:22] a worldwide ministry and god says now
[46:25] now the world must now understand they
[46:27] must come to christ
[46:30] but they reject
[46:31] and god knows one thing i have no more
[46:34] flesh
[46:36] there's no more messenger coming on this
[46:38] earth
[46:40] the denominational world who has
[46:43] rejected the message of the hour has not
[46:46] another opportunity
[46:48] it is over
[46:50] god will not send another messenger it
[46:52] is over for them
[46:54] but
[46:55] there are individuals
[46:59] and i i just say it as a vision
[47:02] because if we say and and i believe 100
[47:05] that salvation that the bride
[47:07] all these things are in the word for
[47:09] this age the message for this age to
[47:11] reject us is to reject christ
[47:14] but the question is even in between of
[47:16] the message we say they did not receive
[47:19] the words but they received their
[47:21] denomination but we have denominations
[47:23] in the message
[47:26] now where do i end
[47:28] okay if they say there is no way for
[47:30] them then it means okay only those who
[47:33] believe like i believe
[47:36] because
[47:37] some people who have in the message i
[47:38] rejected the word they just received god
[47:40] sent a prophet and they stay
[47:42] so i have to say okay i have to make
[47:44] that circle so much only those who
[47:46] believe like me
[47:48] the rest have no salvation have nothing
[47:50] therefore always say this
[47:52] keep the blood in the in denominations
[47:56] you say brother marcus they come
[47:58] together i want to say this they make
[48:00] big convention in vain do they worship
[48:02] today
[48:04] but in between of these ranks there are
[48:06] still some people
[48:09] they have a way they have a future
[48:12] they maybe never had we know
[48:13] denominations is
[48:15] the vision that brother branham had
[48:17] about miss america miss europe he didn't
[48:20] never died for those people but in
[48:23] denominations are wonderful people
[48:26] amen and god has a way for them
[48:29] can you say amen
[48:31] blessed be the name of the lord for the
[48:33] for the individual brother brahm says
[48:35] clear 1956 i i i either america will
[48:39] take this and this side 1960 said i will
[48:41] not pray for america anymore
[48:43] so america is finished
[48:46] but here is american city
[48:49] are you finished no no no
[48:51] we are not finished
[48:52] do you understand
[48:54] god america still has wonderful people
[48:57] um and they are not finished they are
[49:00] bright
[49:01] you see both sides
[49:03] if not we come into next then then first
[49:06] say there's no hope for nothing in the
[49:07] denominations okay then it's in the
[49:09] messy okay only those who believe like
[49:11] us
[49:14] at the end it becomes just to your local
[49:16] church only our local church and
[49:17] churches have people who come and who go
[49:20] for many reasons so we have to tell them
[49:23] okay there's no more blood because they
[49:24] left our doctrine
[49:25] then you are back in the thing
[49:27] you see ah
[49:28] you were in the hospital
[49:30] and god on calvary he saw the whole plan
[49:33] everybody who really just
[49:35] just a penny
[49:36] brother blame said like this
[49:39] he said there is some people that just
[49:41] can have a pennies worth worthless
[49:44] and god can only use them in a penny way
[49:47] that's all they can buy don't reject
[49:49] them
[49:50] if they can't believe the real truth
[49:52] don't turn them down don't kick them out
[49:55] say they're not in because god uses
[49:58] pennies sometimes
[50:01] don't make the circle smaller make it
[50:03] bigger
[50:05] maybe the love is god it's bigger than
[50:07] we thought about it
[50:08] and then brother brain said this and
[50:10] here you have to bring both quotes
[50:12] together he says a man if a man serves
[50:16] god's purpose there is a resurrection
[50:19] just as sure as anything
[50:21] but
[50:22] brother blame said god uses pennies and
[50:25] on the other hand side there's a
[50:26] resurrection for all those that served
[50:28] his purpose
[50:30] let those people alone let them be
[50:33] what they are you say what about these
[50:35] people let god decide on the white
[50:37] throne judgment
[50:39] this is this is eagle age this is bright
[50:42] age
[50:42] but the system brother is over
[50:46] in the messenger outside of the message
[50:50] remember one thing we go to a hospital
[50:53] i'm marcus becker here's somebody dying
[50:55] with kuvit
[50:57] you see
[50:58] and he understands i'm a minister or you
[51:01] are a minister now that person says
[51:05] mr becker i don't i don't know i i i i
[51:08] never was a christian i want to get
[51:09] right with god should i say brother
[51:12] there's no way it's finished for you i
[51:13] will not say this no i will not say this
[51:16] what would i say to him okay i give you
[51:19] you first have to study the life of
[51:20] william branham no i will not say i
[51:23] would say look he died for your sin on
[51:25] the cross of calvary
[51:28] and whosoever will it let him come
[51:32] if we call it salvation or granted don't
[51:35] play on words but i believe god honors
[51:38] these decisions
[51:40] blessed be the name of the heart there
[51:42] is hope for the individual
[51:44] but the systems are all over brother
[51:47] i'm in vain do they worship me rejecting
[51:50] the messages rejecting christ
[51:54] some people they don't have time
[51:56] i mean if you have one hour for a person
[51:59] and
[51:59] one hour that he has still to live we we
[52:02] had these things when we were standing
[52:03] at the
[52:04] death beds of people we never spoke
[52:07] about about the thunders
[52:10] we didn't do that this is for bride
[52:12] this is coming to prison when it comes
[52:14] to pure salvation
[52:16] just it's just in a denomination
[52:18] accepting
[52:20] his grace and mercy and leave it up into
[52:23] the up up up to the hand of the lord you
[52:25] just say hey jesus died for you
[52:27] you put your name into it
[52:30] and he takes it and then let god decide
[52:32] wherever he is
[52:34] that's to be the name of the lord
[52:36] but i want to just not not say it as a
[52:38] doctrine because i'm not really
[52:39] believing what everybody believes
[52:40] knowing what everybody believes but keep
[52:42] it as a vision
[52:44] because we had already these tendencies
[52:46] of us for and no more no
[52:49] no god has a way but bride is bright
[52:52] can you say amen
[52:54] blessed be the name of the lord
[52:56] so so here comes something here's the
[52:58] next one
[53:00] can you say amen so far
[53:02] so you can pray for america
[53:05] you say it's finished still pray for it
[53:09] sometimes we pray for damage control
[53:13] i mean even if you're saying it's
[53:14] fantastic it's tremendous no no it's not
[53:17] tremendous
[53:19] amen
[53:20] pray for germany pray for for pray for
[53:23] for the governors pray for the president
[53:24] do it
[53:25] don't say everything is finished no
[53:27] we're still living here
[53:29] blessed be the name of the world knowing
[53:31] that our kingdom is not america
[53:33] we come from another country
[53:35] going back to another country
[53:37] that should be the name of the lord
[53:39] i'll just give you an example
[53:43] i am a janitor
[53:45] and there was uh uh i had to be there as
[53:48] a janitor in the
[53:49] in the uh in some kind like a speech
[53:51] about israel so i wanted to be there
[53:54] it was from the
[53:55] lutheran church and it was a good speech
[53:58] about israel explaining israel very very
[53:59] fine very good
[54:01] and they had a little book
[54:03] quite expensive
[54:05] um about the jews in the black forest
[54:08] where we're living in and i thought
[54:10] about my pastor and about his wife and i
[54:12] said i so much would like to give them
[54:15] that book as a little present you know
[54:16] they were sick and just to
[54:18] bless them a little bit i thought about
[54:20] you you know but i had no money and i
[54:23] did not say anything was there and
[54:25] everything was finished and so far and
[54:27] he was he was even something like a like
[54:29] a bishop or whatever you know there
[54:31] everybody is packing his things together
[54:34] and the bishop comes to me he said look
[54:36] i have on my heart to give you this book
[54:37] as a little gift
[54:40] now what should i should i
[54:42] throw dirt i would say thank you god
[54:45] bless you richly
[54:46] god bless you i'm
[54:49] no harm to wish them well
[54:51] i mean we were younger and we put
[54:53] everybody who was not of our opinion
[54:55] we'll put them in the hands of the of
[54:56] satan
[54:59] we left them into the hand of satan
[55:00] because they were not one with us
[55:02] today we're a little bit older we leave
[55:04] them into the hands of god
[55:06] he said god help my brother
[55:08] he's wrong as he can be but god bless
[55:11] him god help him because god helped us
[55:13] so much
[55:14] god had a lot of patience with us why
[55:17] shouldn't i have patience with my
[55:18] brothers
[55:19] not agreeing with what they all do but
[55:22] be
[55:22] one blessed be the name of the lord and
[55:25] if somebody is a penny brother
[55:29] you not change that man
[55:31] but you are not changing him by
[55:32] despising him so give him a little bit
[55:35] of hope
[55:36] he says we don't believe it's bright but
[55:38] at the right throne judgment god is a
[55:40] true judge
[55:42] and even if your job we i i dare just
[55:44] come to church god honors even that
[55:48] everything that you do for his kingdom
[55:50] blessed be the name of the lord
[55:52] by that you always keep a friendly
[55:54] atmosphere around you
[55:56] amen amen
[55:59] what about these christians god bless
[56:01] them
[56:02] what about these people in the message
[56:04] god bless them
[56:06] because brother we are we are called to
[56:08] bless people
[56:09] not to curse them we are abraham's seed
[56:13] do you agree no i don't agree
[56:15] but god bless them
[56:17] god gave us so much why shouldn't we
[56:18] bless them all you know
[56:20] bless that's not echo many could you
[56:22] have your stand
[56:23] sure
[56:24] but why should we despise others
[56:26] the moment you despise other i tell you
[56:28] is the spirit that comes upon your own
[56:30] your own congregation then it's only the
[56:32] message yes there's a truth only but
[56:35] then i ask what kind of message
[56:38] i'm in
[56:39] i mean okay only that doctrine in the
[56:41] message okay and then it brings and then
[56:44] it's only our church okay and then you
[56:46] know there are different believers in
[56:47] the church yeah but only that group of
[56:48] the lord croak
[56:51] it becomes difficult brother i'ma keep
[56:53] your heart open and say
[56:55] i commit you in god's hand god brother
[56:57] lonnie always said the first
[56:59] resurrection will prove who is who
[57:02] why should we make up our mind now this
[57:04] is bright this is half bright this is
[57:06] just part of a bride
[57:08] leave them into the hands of the lord
[57:09] treat everybody to be a bride and god
[57:11] knows who is who
[57:13] that's obedient here's martin luther so
[57:15] he's writing this he's a he's a catholic
[57:17] monk
[57:19] he says i'm reading it wikipedia
[57:22] meanwhile in the same year 1519
[57:26] i had begun interpreting the psalms once
[57:29] again i felt confident that i was now
[57:32] more experienced since i had dealt in
[57:34] university courses with saint paul's
[57:37] letters to the romans to the galatians
[57:39] and the letters to the hebrews i had
[57:41] conceived a burning desire to understand
[57:44] what paul meant in his letter to the
[57:47] romans but thus far they had stood in my
[57:50] way
[57:50] not the cold blood around my heart
[57:54] but that one word which is in chapter
[57:56] one the justice of god is revealed in it
[57:59] i hated that word here's your messenger
[58:03] you say it's a german it's your
[58:04] messenger too okay
[58:06] justice of god which by the use and
[58:09] custom of all my teachers i had been
[58:12] taught to understand philosophically
[58:15] as referring to formal or active justice
[58:19] as they call it the justice by which god
[58:22] is just and by which he punishes sinners
[58:25] and the unjust but i
[58:28] blameless monk that i was felt that
[58:31] before god i was a sinner with an
[58:33] extremely troubled conscious i couldn't
[58:36] be sure
[58:38] that god was appeased by my satisfaction
[58:41] i did not laugh no rather i hated
[58:45] the just god who punishes sinners
[58:48] in silence if i did not blaspheme then i
[58:52] certainly i grumbled vehemently and got
[58:55] angry at god i said isn't it enough that
[58:58] we miserable sinners lost for all
[59:01] eternity because of original sin
[59:04] are oppressed oppressed by every kind of
[59:07] calamity through the ten commandments
[59:10] why does god keep sorrow upon sorrow
[59:13] through the gospel and through the
[59:14] gospel threaten us with his justice and
[59:17] his wrath
[59:18] this was how i was raging with wild and
[59:21] disturbed conscience i constantly
[59:24] badgered saint paul about that spot in
[59:26] romans 1 and it was actually wanted to
[59:29] know what he meant
[59:31] i mediated night and day on those words
[59:34] until at last by the mercy of god i paid
[59:36] attention to their context
[59:38] the justice of god is revealed in it as
[59:41] it is written the just person lives by
[59:43] faith
[59:44] i began to understand that in these
[59:46] verses the justice of god is that by
[59:49] which the just per person lives by a
[59:53] gift of god that is by faith
[59:57] i began to understand that this verse
[59:59] means that the justice of god is
[1:00:01] revealed through the gospel but it is a
[1:00:04] passive justice
[1:00:07] that by which the merciful god justifies
[1:00:10] us by faith
[1:00:12] as it is written that just lives by
[1:00:14] faith all at once i felt that i had been
[1:00:18] born again and entered into the paradise
[1:00:21] itself through open gates
[1:00:26] so the the mystery lays in grammar
[1:00:31] so let me explain you this
[1:00:34] there is a genitive of the object and
[1:00:37] the genitive of the subject
[1:00:39] it's very simple
[1:00:43] so this evening you learn something from
[1:00:45] your german friends not your own
[1:00:46] language now you can you can can can
[1:00:49] talk it right
[1:00:50] if we say
[1:00:52] the enemy's fear is great it has two
[1:00:56] directions
[1:00:58] it can mean we fear the enemy
[1:01:01] but it can mean too the enemy has a lot
[1:01:03] of fear
[1:01:05] because of us
[1:01:06] his two direction
[1:01:08] and
[1:01:09] and and you have to understand martin
[1:01:11] luther he was a doctor
[1:01:15] so he was studying he was translating
[1:01:17] the bible and he understood he always
[1:01:19] understood the justice of god that means
[1:01:21] i must be just to
[1:01:25] please god and he look to himself and
[1:01:28] remember the subject that we have
[1:01:30] amen
[1:01:32] do you believe your feelings or do you
[1:01:33] believe god
[1:01:34] and he was thinking about he was praying
[1:01:37] more and fasting more
[1:01:39] and he felt worse
[1:01:43] but then he understood justice of god
[1:01:45] means the lord is my justice
[1:01:49] he said i will never make it but he is
[1:01:52] my justice
[1:01:54] the whole book became a new book
[1:01:58] brother once you find grace in god you
[1:02:01] can have grace with people
[1:02:04] and there is many people in this message
[1:02:06] they have the doctrine of william
[1:02:08] brennan but they don't have the spirit
[1:02:09] of with it
[1:02:11] they are just judgmental with themselves
[1:02:14] and by that they are judgmental with
[1:02:15] others
[1:02:16] lest it be the name of the lord
[1:02:19] so what happens is he had his revival
[1:02:22] over a genitive
[1:02:26] so what about us with all these spoken
[1:02:28] word books
[1:02:30] what kind of revival should we have if
[1:02:32] he has a revival just over a genitive
[1:02:35] you have your revival of an accusative
[1:02:37] that's fine
[1:02:39] main thing is you have a revival can you
[1:02:41] say amen
[1:02:43] but brothers we were reading the bible
[1:02:46] under our former background
[1:02:49] you can listen to a preacher you can see
[1:02:50] his background he comes from a
[1:02:51] pentecostal church very very clear he's
[1:02:54] quoting the prophet
[1:02:55] but his backup is completely pentecostal
[1:02:59] the emphasis is very very clear from
[1:03:01] where he comes from brother therefore we
[1:03:03] have to renew our minds
[1:03:05] therefore we have to die of all of our
[1:03:08] old thinking
[1:03:09] and taking god's thoughts
[1:03:11] can you say amen
[1:03:13] so here comes the next messenger that we
[1:03:15] have the first one
[1:03:16] so you understand one spot it's once
[1:03:19] martin luther
[1:03:21] saw the love of god how he cares
[1:03:25] reformation starts
[1:03:28] reformation was not just a military
[1:03:30] thing because those germans they have a
[1:03:32] military spirit and they like to fight
[1:03:34] and they had no no
[1:03:35] martin luther was driven by by that love
[1:03:39] to say i have to tell the people
[1:03:42] you can fast you can pray you can go to
[1:03:45] church you can give and give and give
[1:03:47] and give but this is never your justice
[1:03:50] the justice is god himself for you
[1:03:55] blessed be the name of the lord and here
[1:03:56] comes the next one here we have john
[1:03:58] wesley he is the next
[1:04:00] amen he's the next messenger now john
[1:04:02] wesley he was son of susanna wesley
[1:04:06] one of tw i think 12 children
[1:04:08] now susana wesley was that that woman
[1:04:11] that brother brandon mentioned she had
[1:04:13] time every week half an hour for every
[1:04:15] child
[1:04:17] so in susana's wesley she was the wife
[1:04:20] of a preacher everything was
[1:04:23] let me say had its
[1:04:24] order i mean john wesley was raised that
[1:04:27] way
[1:04:28] everything has its order
[1:04:30] you open you open you open for example
[1:04:34] how you call it
[1:04:37] yes something you open like this and you
[1:04:39] don't have to look you know exactly what
[1:04:41] the throttles are
[1:04:43] something like this everything is in
[1:04:45] order
[1:04:46] right
[1:04:47] so when he was a young man he gave his
[1:04:49] heart to the lord
[1:04:51] and he was forming the methodist
[1:04:53] movement
[1:04:54] methodist comes from method
[1:04:57] and they said look i mean come to church
[1:05:00] whenever we want
[1:05:01] we will come together to serve the lord
[1:05:04] every evening
[1:05:05] therefore the methodist movements to
[1:05:07] make a method method coming to uh to the
[1:05:11] house of god
[1:05:12] therefore i
[1:05:14] pat on your shoulders you are a good
[1:05:15] methodist this evening
[1:05:17] coming to church okay but we have to
[1:05:20] grow into more than death
[1:05:23] so he gave his heart to the lord as a
[1:05:26] good methodist everything is in order
[1:05:28] and he goes over to georgia
[1:05:31] to
[1:05:31] be a missionary here in georgia
[1:05:35] now on the way
[1:05:37] to
[1:05:38] georgia he was in the ship
[1:05:40] and he met german brothers from the
[1:05:42] holiness movement
[1:05:45] and we have to understand
[1:05:47] the former christians were the eagles of
[1:05:50] their day
[1:05:51] they were not they were eagles for that
[1:05:52] day because
[1:05:54] john wesley was deeply impressed because
[1:05:56] they came into a storm and they thought
[1:05:58] the ship would wreck
[1:06:00] and the german brothers were sitting in
[1:06:02] in the ship they were just having
[1:06:04] fellowship
[1:06:05] they were just worshiping god
[1:06:07] amen near
[1:06:09] that now the whole ship would
[1:06:12] give me the wrong key another key see
[1:06:15] right no no it's wrong again so there
[1:06:17] was so much in there
[1:06:19] in the in the in the in that service for
[1:06:21] the lord
[1:06:22] nothing bothered them
[1:06:24] i wonder ourselves if we're too bothered
[1:06:27] with coffee today
[1:06:28] or with trump always bite and whatever
[1:06:31] brother we come from another kingdom
[1:06:34] if covet 19 ends kobe 20 will arrive
[1:06:39] do you understand we have a lot of great
[1:06:42] prophecies and great things in the
[1:06:43] message of the hour that is wonderful
[1:06:45] i'm 100 for it i thought i'm for every
[1:06:48] gift but god never warned us
[1:06:51] god never said in two years there will
[1:06:53] be this this god was hiding it
[1:06:55] because he wants his church to grow into
[1:06:57] immaturity he wants to have a church
[1:06:59] that he said whatever comes whatever
[1:07:01] goes there prepared
[1:07:03] god does not want it we can have these
[1:07:05] things nothing really nothing else but
[1:07:06] god doesn't want for us uh brother son
[1:07:08] so can you tell me what happens in two
[1:07:10] months god says i'm i'm your
[1:07:12] future i mean because you're not there
[1:07:15] then relying on somebody who tells you
[1:07:17] what comes god knows whatever comes
[1:07:19] whatever goes i have a church who knows
[1:07:21] who they are
[1:07:22] let's be there but there's nothing not
[1:07:23] not wrong against it but but but but god
[1:07:26] never wanted so they were so much just
[1:07:30] worshipping the lord and john wesley was
[1:07:32] impressed he writes in his diary
[1:07:35] very impressed
[1:07:37] so he comes to georgia and
[1:07:39] he wants to be more holy than the
[1:07:42] holiness movement
[1:07:44] he wants to top it
[1:07:46] he wants to say if they were holy
[1:07:48] i will i will show them what a real holy
[1:07:50] man is
[1:07:51] [Laughter]
[1:07:53] good it's fine
[1:07:55] but the americans were the wrong kind of
[1:07:57] people because the americans in the time
[1:07:59] of john wesley had already the haha
[1:08:02] spirit
[1:08:04] like brother branham said
[1:08:05] amen so he wanted to be
[1:08:08] this is church man there's no laughter
[1:08:11] he has nothing this is i mean and they
[1:08:13] had already their heart spirits
[1:08:16] so so we have a problem somebody wants
[1:08:19] to be more holy than anybody else and
[1:08:22] the church says
[1:08:23] for him
[1:08:25] he he had church every day
[1:08:28] so he comes to georgia okay the brother
[1:08:30] said okay this afternoon after church we
[1:08:33] have barbecue
[1:08:35] where they said barbecue
[1:08:37] after church we have church
[1:08:39] [Laughter]
[1:08:42] and in the evening
[1:08:44] church
[1:08:45] and the americans said you can have your
[1:08:47] church
[1:08:48] you can have your own church if you want
[1:08:50] we have barbecue
[1:08:53] you understand so he wants to reform the
[1:08:56] people in georgia but it never worked
[1:08:59] you see so what happened is he had to
[1:09:02] flee because there was some kind of a
[1:09:04] story on december 1733 he has to flee
[1:09:08] back home to england
[1:09:10] the church just refused they didn't want
[1:09:11] to have that kind of thing off you know
[1:09:13] being always stricken oh but they want
[1:09:15] to have a little bit of of of liberty
[1:09:17] that's fine
[1:09:18] so he comes back home and god gives him
[1:09:21] two
[1:09:22] events to change his life
[1:09:25] god wants to train us
[1:09:28] brother there's nothing wrong to be
[1:09:29] wrong
[1:09:30] because we're young
[1:09:32] and when we're young we make mistakes
[1:09:34] and god knows we make mistakes but god
[1:09:36] says okay john
[1:09:38] boy stand up do it again but you learn
[1:09:40] your lesson do better next time
[1:09:42] every minister
[1:09:44] every believer he is growing he starts
[1:09:48] as a young man and as a young man he
[1:09:50] makes mistakes of young people we have
[1:09:53] to forgive one another
[1:09:55] we have to forget
[1:09:56] we cannot make a story because you will
[1:09:58] get what you reap
[1:10:00] the same way you will judge your brother
[1:10:02] god will judge you
[1:10:03] amen lester be the name of the lord so
[1:10:06] what happens is this
[1:10:09] john wesley still
[1:10:12] amen
[1:10:14] really strong in his face and his
[1:10:16] conviction and holiness is part of the
[1:10:19] gospel there's no question about it but
[1:10:21] he wanted to make it to the extent
[1:10:24] they're really pleasing god now here he
[1:10:27] comes to a
[1:10:28] person who is sentenced to death
[1:10:31] that was
[1:10:32] 1738 i think so yes he's sentenced to
[1:10:35] death
[1:10:36] and he's asked to go to that delinquent
[1:10:39] tomorrow he will die and to say some
[1:10:41] nice words just to bring it to the lord
[1:10:43] now here's john wesley he comes not
[1:10:45] willingly he comes
[1:10:47] and he thinks okay
[1:10:50] this unbeliever i will try to convince
[1:10:52] him to christ he will refuse i would say
[1:10:55] okay shalom what can i do sorry for this
[1:10:58] pray for you and then okay i continue my
[1:11:00] way
[1:11:01] so he brings the testimony to that man
[1:11:03] and the man gives his heart to the lord
[1:11:07] so what can you say to a man giving his
[1:11:09] heart to the lord
[1:11:11] he he's exactly like jonah
[1:11:14] preaching preaching repentance and they
[1:11:16] repent i mean that was not what i was
[1:11:18] preaching for
[1:11:20] [Applause]
[1:11:21] i want to preach judgment i repent and
[1:11:23] he does the same thing so the only thing
[1:11:25] that he can say is brother you're dying
[1:11:26] tomorrow and the blood of calvary is
[1:11:28] sufficient for you
[1:11:30] what can he say
[1:11:32] the man has no way he
[1:11:33] he was never injured he never paid his
[1:11:35] tithing
[1:11:38] but he can just say if you if you accept
[1:11:40] that sacrifice of calvary
[1:11:43] exactly so so he does
[1:11:46] he dies the next day and john wesley
[1:11:48] thinks twice
[1:11:50] he said look i mean i i'm i'm i'm i i'm
[1:11:53] making one program after the other i get
[1:11:56] a heart attack by all the things that i
[1:11:57] do for the lord and he does nothing
[1:12:01] and he's saved
[1:12:03] that's not that's only because john
[1:12:05] wesley thought okay
[1:12:07] i will arrive at the door of heaven
[1:12:10] my name is john wesley i was in 30
[1:12:12] countries
[1:12:14] many people know my name i brought so
[1:12:16] much people to the lord and
[1:12:18] got a very wonderful church and i
[1:12:20] started the movement and he understood
[1:12:22] god was not interested in those things
[1:12:26] because he is my justice
[1:12:28] we do things for god but not to to get
[1:12:31] anything like a special reward
[1:12:34] who was preaching the best who was the
[1:12:36] deepest who brought no
[1:12:38] by justice is the lord
[1:12:40] what what
[1:12:42] and and and what happens then
[1:12:44] one of the next days
[1:12:46] uh he comes to a uh a a a reunion of the
[1:12:50] morovians
[1:12:52] and and according to his own diary he
[1:12:55] went there
[1:12:57] against his will
[1:12:58] you see
[1:12:59] so
[1:13:00] listening to those morovians okay right
[1:13:03] in london in the eldest gate street so
[1:13:07] he came
[1:13:09] and sometimes we in the message we can
[1:13:11] have a certain arrogance of thinking
[1:13:13] that we know somebody something and uh
[1:13:16] who
[1:13:18] just first and second pool man man i
[1:13:20] cannot have fellowship no no this is
[1:13:22] just no no no
[1:13:24] bad influence bad influence
[1:13:28] how
[1:13:29] how would mr trump say low energy man
[1:13:31] low energy man
[1:13:33] what is he what is his preaching total
[1:13:35] disaster total disaster
[1:13:39] so he comes there
[1:13:41] and they were just reading a preface and
[1:13:43] he must be sitting there and said man
[1:13:47] they need a real preacher and they but
[1:13:49] they don't recognize who is just in
[1:13:50] their midst
[1:13:52] so he said but then he says according to
[1:13:54] his own diary
[1:13:56] he says in the evening i went very
[1:13:58] unwillingly to a society in elders gate
[1:14:01] street where one was reading luther's
[1:14:04] preface to the epistles to the romans
[1:14:08] about a quarter before nine while he was
[1:14:10] describing the change which god works in
[1:14:14] the heart through the face in christ i
[1:14:17] felt my heart strangely warmed i felt i
[1:14:21] did trust in christ christ alone for
[1:14:23] salvation and an assurance was given me
[1:14:27] that he had taken away my sins even mine
[1:14:29] and saved me from the law of sin and
[1:14:32] death
[1:14:33] rather until that time he had a doctrine
[1:14:36] he had a zeal but then he found his
[1:14:38] father
[1:14:40] it changes life
[1:14:42] brother once you get we don't speak
[1:14:44] about compromise we but we speak about
[1:14:46] somebody you know what the love of god
[1:14:47] is
[1:14:48] if you know what the love of god is you
[1:14:50] can give it to the next one
[1:14:52] if not you just give frustration and
[1:14:54] pressure and these things i mean
[1:14:55] everybody's a low energy man
[1:14:58] everybody is just a total disaster
[1:15:01] only we ourselves tremendous
[1:15:04] amen unbelievable
[1:15:06] nobody can sing like me forget it you
[1:15:10] understand he changed from a doctrine to
[1:15:12] a reality
[1:15:15] sometimes you have a family in the
[1:15:16] message in there they are they are there
[1:15:19] they're wonderful you know you see the
[1:15:20] children
[1:15:22] on the photo
[1:15:27] a model family
[1:15:28] but sometimes they are just rich young
[1:15:30] rulers
[1:15:32] they're never born again never born they
[1:15:34] know how to believe to behave in the
[1:15:36] message but that is not salvation
[1:15:38] brother
[1:15:39] the rich ruler said i've learned these
[1:15:41] things from my youth
[1:15:43] how to behave how to dress but god wants
[1:15:45] a heart
[1:15:47] god wants a soul
[1:15:49] god wants a love god wants an enthusiasm
[1:15:52] god wants the young people to say this
[1:15:53] message is my message
[1:15:56] amen the prophet came from me
[1:15:59] and christ died for me
[1:16:02] but a true christian never becomes a
[1:16:05] brand of mite
[1:16:06] but we have branamites
[1:16:08] but you have to understand brandon
[1:16:10] brandon matism is not christianity
[1:16:14] amen we're christians but we understood
[1:16:17] the seventh angel was not leading us to
[1:16:19] himself it was leading us to christ
[1:16:22] can you say amen
[1:16:24] amen therefore these three young men uh
[1:16:26] over there in babylon who saw the star
[1:16:28] they did not look at the stars saying
[1:16:30] wow
[1:16:31] that's deep man that's tremendous three
[1:16:34] stars in one line we make a picture we
[1:16:36] make the three stars in line
[1:16:38] denomination that's tremendous
[1:16:41] have you ever seen when young people
[1:16:42] come from a certain uh convention they
[1:16:44] say brother marcus that was tremendous
[1:16:47] that was deep he said yes
[1:16:49] yes
[1:16:50] we never heard it that way brother mark
[1:16:52] says yes because the prophet never said
[1:16:54] it therefore you never heard it
[1:16:56] definitely never heard it
[1:16:57] i mean and then i asked i asked and and
[1:17:00] what did you understand uh nothing but
[1:17:02] it was tremendous and that's tremendous
[1:17:04] man
[1:17:05] we have to bring these youngsters into a
[1:17:07] position that they find their place in
[1:17:09] the world
[1:17:11] we don't want to have fans
[1:17:14] no sir we're not influenced so so when
[1:17:16] they saw this thought i didn't say the
[1:17:18] star was leading them where to to a
[1:17:21] person
[1:17:22] to christ the king and we have seen his
[1:17:25] star the seventh star we've seen instead
[1:17:27] he did not lead us to jeffersonville it
[1:17:29] led us to a king
[1:17:31] a person
[1:17:33] and you say amen
[1:17:35] so therefore the justice of god
[1:17:39] i cannot rely i do my best
[1:17:43] but when it comes
[1:17:45] to the last minutes of my life i cannot
[1:17:48] say i understood this i understood that
[1:17:50] i only can say lord you paid the price
[1:17:53] for me
[1:17:54] amen when it comes to reality
[1:17:58] bride is bright we are growing into
[1:18:00] something but
[1:18:01] i mean reality is he is my justice
[1:18:05] and we and and if you are a son of god
[1:18:08] you do your best
[1:18:10] but your best is not enough
[1:18:14] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:18:16] here we know that that that elijah and
[1:18:18] this will help you so much
[1:18:21] because many times we are standing in
[1:18:23] our own way
[1:18:25] here is the prophet elijah he's a
[1:18:27] tremendous man but he is a melancholic
[1:18:29] type of a person
[1:18:31] his nerves were at the end says brother
[1:18:33] branham in uh what else are here elijah
[1:18:35] and god at that moment did not send a
[1:18:38] social worker
[1:18:40] he sent an angel and that angel had a
[1:18:43] book
[1:18:44] or had something to eat
[1:18:47] and god sent to us
[1:18:48] an angel with something to eat
[1:18:54] i mean brother bram said i would have
[1:18:55] loved to know what kind of vitamins were
[1:18:57] in those cookies
[1:19:00] because elijah was running for 40 days
[1:19:02] and 40 nights i mean we have a food we
[1:19:05] are running till the rapture and over
[1:19:07] the rapture
[1:19:09] this message that we believe is red bull
[1:19:14] you need an energy drink this message is
[1:19:16] red bull for us
[1:19:18] blessed be the name of the lord and then
[1:19:21] brother blame says this i never forget
[1:19:22] the sentence he said when do when you do
[1:19:26] your best
[1:19:27] and you come to an end
[1:19:30] then god is obligated to send the same
[1:19:32] angel to you to lead you further on you
[1:19:36] do your part and god is his part
[1:19:40] here's brother branham amen now we see
[1:19:42] the picture and it says
[1:19:44] but in the sight of god the bride is
[1:19:47] justified she never done it in the first
[1:19:49] place amon standing there married to the
[1:19:51] virtuous son of god never sinned in the
[1:19:54] first place why
[1:19:55] she was far away and she was trapped
[1:19:57] into this and now when she heard the
[1:19:59] truth and come forth the blood cleanses
[1:20:01] here the message blood cleanses her and
[1:20:03] she stands there virtuous she no sin on
[1:20:06] her at all
[1:20:09] this message revealed our true identity
[1:20:13] because we come from the mind of god and
[1:20:16] we should have gone into our theophany
[1:20:19] and we landed in north carolina
[1:20:23] god never asked us do you want to be
[1:20:25] white or black
[1:20:26] do you want to be male or female you
[1:20:28] want to live in america or in germany
[1:20:31] god never god just placed us somewhere
[1:20:34] and sometimes we think we god placed us
[1:20:36] wrong but one thing is sure if you think
[1:20:39] you are placed wrong your beginning was
[1:20:41] wrong on this earth be sure you leave
[1:20:43] this earth the right way
[1:20:46] because god found you
[1:20:48] i always liked that little that little
[1:20:49] demonstration it's just it's not a
[1:20:51] doctrine just a demonstration as
[1:20:52] everything that i said until now was not
[1:20:54] doctrine just a vision just to see
[1:20:57] different approaches in our thinking in
[1:20:59] our mind doctrine is something else i
[1:21:01] don't have the time i will not dare to
[1:21:03] another and behind another man's spirit
[1:21:05] will give a doctrine but look at this
[1:21:07] god before the foundation of the world
[1:21:09] he made a picture of his family
[1:21:12] all together so we are not arrogant but
[1:21:16] we are proud
[1:21:18] proud about our father
[1:21:20] proud about the family we are royal
[1:21:22] family
[1:21:24] amen
[1:21:25] i mean sometimes i'm at the dentist you
[1:21:27] know and i'm a person who are fearing
[1:21:28] the dentist
[1:21:30] i don't fear the devil i don't feel no
[1:21:32] demons but i fear the dentist
[1:21:35] if i just the sounds makes me pray
[1:21:39] right so the dentist made them they have
[1:21:41] these little brochures you know
[1:21:43] so i'm just reading them to get the time
[1:21:45] so and i speak about the royals prince
[1:21:47] charles lady diana and i was thinking
[1:21:50] where is marcus becker
[1:21:54] we are the real royals
[1:21:57] so we are proud but not arrogant we have
[1:21:59] no reason to be arrogant
[1:22:01] because our grace is by god
[1:22:04] so god made a photo
[1:22:06] and he takes his family and throws them
[1:22:09] in seven church ages
[1:22:11] seven continents
[1:22:13] seven and god knows one thing
[1:22:15] at the end of seven church ages
[1:22:17] the family of god is together
[1:22:21] nobody is missing
[1:22:23] and brother ram said this god is not
[1:22:25] complete without you
[1:22:28] this messenger brought us things that
[1:22:30] nobody else could preach
[1:22:32] nobody could say my own he means
[1:22:34] theophany but my own glorified body
[1:22:36] standing here on that on that platform
[1:22:38] that's quote of brother branham brother
[1:22:40] branham who are the angels behold in the
[1:22:42] face of the father your own theophilus
[1:22:45] nobody could say this this was our
[1:22:47] messenger giving us rapturing faith
[1:22:50] blessed be the name of the lord so what
[1:22:52] happened when when these angels met
[1:22:54] brother rem he didn't understand himself
[1:22:56] until one year later god says turn the
[1:22:59] picture to the right
[1:23:00] and who does he see
[1:23:02] he's christ
[1:23:04] amen hoffman's head of christ
[1:23:06] blessed be the name of why is this so
[1:23:08] important
[1:23:10] look at this
[1:23:12] now levi echo says and he shall put the
[1:23:14] incense upon the fire before the lord
[1:23:16] that the cloud of the incense may cover
[1:23:18] the mercy seat that is upon the
[1:23:20] testimony that he did not die not
[1:23:23] and he shall take the blood of the
[1:23:24] bullock and sprinkle it with the finger
[1:23:26] upon the mercy seat eastwards and before
[1:23:29] the mercy seat shall be sprinkle of the
[1:23:30] blood with his finger seven times
[1:23:33] third seal and now we found out that the
[1:23:35] slain lamb is the bloody lamb bleeding
[1:23:36] all over it has been slain after being
[1:23:39] stained it raised again it was sitting
[1:23:41] on the throne say back in behind the
[1:23:44] throne like this
[1:23:46] look at this when the when the priest
[1:23:49] enters into the in the into the holies
[1:23:52] of holies he opened the curtain and he
[1:23:55] was making incest so that there was some
[1:23:57] kind like a smoke
[1:23:59] around
[1:24:01] so
[1:24:02] he went
[1:24:05] from the
[1:24:06] west to the east
[1:24:08] for the east to the west
[1:24:10] exactly
[1:24:12] and when he says he was sprinkled
[1:24:13] eastwards
[1:24:15] that means he went
[1:24:17] behind the throne
[1:24:21] to sprinkle in the right direction
[1:24:23] but what happened to that high priest he
[1:24:24] could not be seen anymore
[1:24:27] amen because there was that kind of
[1:24:29] smoke
[1:24:31] and is israel know one thing on yom
[1:24:33] kippur he said he is now
[1:24:36] getting let me call it redemption or
[1:24:38] atonement for all of our sins
[1:24:41] and brother brahman said this he had his
[1:24:43] little belt because if he went in
[1:24:45] unworthy
[1:24:46] he would fall dead
[1:24:48] so you can imagine these people
[1:24:56] and brother brahm said if any religion
[1:24:57] doesn't make sound it's dead you can
[1:24:59] bury it anyhow
[1:25:01] exactly so huh so once he was sure
[1:25:04] when he came out of it
[1:25:07] out of that smoke and out of the door
[1:25:10] israel saw them they knew
[1:25:12] god accepted our atonement
[1:25:15] so the revival was going on
[1:25:17] they were there was there was spiritual
[1:25:19] party time
[1:25:20] but what happened the last time we saw
[1:25:24] jesus when he was ascending
[1:25:27] up into another dimension
[1:25:29] and nobody saw him that time
[1:25:32] but we know how he looked like
[1:25:35] because brother brahm saw in a vision
[1:25:38] and he said exactly that was hoffman's
[1:25:40] head of christ and when we see the
[1:25:42] picture on sunset mountain we see okay
[1:25:44] the high priest came back and he looks
[1:25:47] exactly like it was 2000 years ago
[1:25:49] in other words our atonement is it's
[1:25:52] done
[1:25:54] amen he is accepted so we are accepted
[1:25:59] nothing stands between me and the
[1:26:01] rapture
[1:26:02] can you say amen
[1:26:04] therefore i told you do you believe god
[1:26:07] or do you believe your own feelings
[1:26:09] amen do you believe if somebody doesn't
[1:26:13] believe that god the lord is your
[1:26:15] rapture
[1:26:16] then in reality you don't believe in
[1:26:18] calvary
[1:26:20] amen you must say it is finished for me
[1:26:24] and as a proof that it's finished for me
[1:26:26] i can receive the message for this day
[1:26:28] [Applause]
[1:26:29] and receive the holy ghost as as my
[1:26:32] abstract title
[1:26:33] do you understand
[1:26:35] so it's a tremendous day
[1:26:36] so brother abraham said this so old man
[1:26:39] old woman don't be discouraged
[1:26:42] do you understand
[1:26:44] gospel is good news
[1:26:47] gospel is positive
[1:26:50] because we don't speak we're not
[1:26:51] speaking now about
[1:26:53] problems that we have we will have them
[1:26:55] but we speak about the plan of god
[1:26:59] brother margaret do you make it i make
[1:27:00] it because my father
[1:27:03] amen he will he will make it for me so
[1:27:05] old man old woman don't you be
[1:27:07] discouraged if you were if you are a
[1:27:10] representation up there in his attribute
[1:27:12] of god if you have if you are
[1:27:14] represented here you cannot you are
[1:27:16] eternal and if you cross from the
[1:27:19] seventh day into the eighth you got it
[1:27:22] into the eternal by the baptism of the
[1:27:24] holy ghost you are included in this
[1:27:26] now if you are just trusting upon a
[1:27:28] sensation or jumping up or down or i do
[1:27:33] this
[1:27:34] wesley holiness movement we are our
[1:27:37] dresses are longer our hair are longer
[1:27:39] wonderful i'm not like the rest of the
[1:27:41] message that's fine but that is not our
[1:27:44] justification
[1:27:46] because the muslims have longer dressed
[1:27:48] than than us
[1:27:49] they are not even even better than us
[1:27:52] that that's the expression of our love
[1:27:54] to god but not our justification
[1:27:57] if you are i do this i keep the servants
[1:27:59] there look people who come to church how
[1:28:01] arrogant they are yeah i understand
[1:28:04] there are some people here in lima they
[1:28:06] go nowhere yeah they don't go nowhere
[1:28:08] yeah but we go to church every sunday
[1:28:10] it's wonderful but if this creates an
[1:28:13] arrogance where did it bring you to
[1:28:16] where did it bring you to
[1:28:17] amen
[1:28:20] now
[1:28:22] and don't eat meat and so forth but this
[1:28:23] is the eternal this is eternal the feast
[1:28:25] after the feast of tabernacles see the
[1:28:27] feast of tabernacles was the last feast
[1:28:30] the seven swedes we are worshiping now
[1:28:32] under the feast of tabernacles the
[1:28:34] seventh church age
[1:28:36] the sea feast of tabernacles could only
[1:28:39] be
[1:28:42] they could only feast it
[1:28:44] after the day of yom kippur
[1:28:47] that means this message
[1:28:49] this christianity has its yom kippur
[1:28:52] already
[1:28:54] god accepted it we believe it i don't
[1:28:57] believe it
[1:28:58] but god believes it
[1:29:00] brother blame said this in the beginning
[1:29:02] when he was just the lord god believed
[1:29:04] his own word
[1:29:05] [Applause]
[1:29:05] [Laughter]
[1:29:08] so i don't want to trust on my belief
[1:29:10] but i trust on his belief
[1:29:12] i say lord you know better than me
[1:29:14] myself
[1:29:16] blessed be
[1:29:18] therefore
[1:29:19] i'm when it came to the day of of of of
[1:29:23] uh uh
[1:29:25] of of the six days war now this is now
[1:29:28] now marcus becker okay this is my
[1:29:30] interpretation but brother blame says
[1:29:33] that when christ comes down revelation
[1:29:35] 10 fulfilled he will go directly to the
[1:29:38] jews therefore many people believe it's
[1:29:40] not fulfilled it will be
[1:29:42] after the rapture no
[1:29:44] scriptures have compound meanings
[1:29:46] different meanings but what happened
[1:29:48] after 63 what was the next great step of
[1:29:51] god it was the six days war
[1:29:54] i mean
[1:29:55] hallelujah
[1:29:57] and the and this and the six days void
[1:29:59] was not israel giving them back the
[1:30:01] temple mount it was god
[1:30:03] with god the threat
[1:30:05] the tactic in the six days war was this
[1:30:08] they were destroying all
[1:30:10] the other airplanes in between of the
[1:30:12] first two hours of that war
[1:30:14] and moshidayan said there will be said
[1:30:17] no words
[1:30:19] no words
[1:30:20] and
[1:30:22] not one information from one pilot to
[1:30:24] the total silence
[1:30:27] seventh seal
[1:30:29] total silence and what happens when they
[1:30:32] were destroying this
[1:30:35] the
[1:30:36] egyptian radio brought false
[1:30:40] information
[1:30:41] they said israel is now they are losing
[1:30:44] they are losing their and israel was
[1:30:46] speaking to jordan's king by the name of
[1:30:49] hussein
[1:30:50] they said don't you enter into that war
[1:30:54] and hussein
[1:30:55] jordania took care of the temple mount
[1:30:59] when brother blame said now israel is
[1:31:01] back in their homeland yes and no
[1:31:03] because they didn't have the temple
[1:31:05] mount which is the heart of all things
[1:31:07] the the true temple worship
[1:31:09] so when when when jordania heard the
[1:31:13] false information
[1:31:14] from
[1:31:15] from from egypt they entered into the
[1:31:18] war because they thought israel is
[1:31:19] finished anyhow
[1:31:22] that was the reason that israel could
[1:31:24] attack the temple mount and get it
[1:31:26] brother brahm said the greatest
[1:31:28] fraud for the church is a false light
[1:31:32] that's all
[1:31:34] but the greatest disaster for the enemy
[1:31:36] was a false information
[1:31:38] in the six days war so they entered all
[1:31:41] and did not know that israel already
[1:31:42] destroyed completely all the airplanes
[1:31:45] of of the egyptians and so forth
[1:31:47] so when that happened
[1:31:50] that they came to the whaling war
[1:31:53] you can see today on youtube
[1:31:55] the generals begin to cry and they just
[1:31:57] said the temple mount is in our hands
[1:32:00] and they were just crying they were just
[1:32:02] singing
[1:32:03] israel
[1:32:05] because they understand this is now the
[1:32:07] fulfillment of the scripture
[1:32:09] not only social israel but now back to
[1:32:12] the temple mount
[1:32:14] and what happened is this
[1:32:16] here is the
[1:32:17] uh rabbi he's taking the shofar
[1:32:22] the shofar is not
[1:32:29] but that happens on yom kippur
[1:32:32] amen that means god
[1:32:35] fought for israel
[1:32:37] bringing them
[1:32:39] back to their homelands
[1:32:42] god fought for israel bringing them on
[1:32:44] the temple mount today there's two
[1:32:46] people that you the two kind of people
[1:32:49] that you don't have to
[1:32:52] uh
[1:32:54] that you don't have to
[1:32:56] that are extremely secure one is israel
[1:33:00] in the hand of god and one is the bride
[1:33:02] can you say amen
[1:33:04] so what happened we see
[1:33:06] how god enters on history in history how
[1:33:10] he brings the bride into their position
[1:33:12] and how he brings israel into their
[1:33:14] position
[1:33:15] according to the will of the lord can
[1:33:18] you say amen
[1:33:20] why is this so important
[1:33:22] i mean
[1:33:23] the judgment of god
[1:33:26] a king was asked the question i think
[1:33:28] the king of jordania
[1:33:32] samaria judea it belongs to who to the
[1:33:35] israelites or to the palestinians he
[1:33:37] said it belongs to god
[1:33:39] it belongs to god
[1:33:41] and god has a right to put in that
[1:33:42] country who he wants
[1:33:44] the bride belongs to god
[1:33:47] you're not belonging nobody can preach
[1:33:49] you in nobody can put you out
[1:33:51] brother branham please explain us when
[1:33:54] i'm finishing please explain
[1:33:57] the mystery of the translation of the
[1:33:59] bride it's a word
[1:34:01] in the bride and it will be
[1:34:05] materialized around that world
[1:34:09] it's not our efforts
[1:34:10] we do the best thing for holiness for
[1:34:13] the baptism of the holy ghost coming to
[1:34:15] church reading the message that's all
[1:34:17] true but it's not sufficient
[1:34:19] it's not sufficient we have to
[1:34:21] understand we need a lot
[1:34:23] we need something supernatural
[1:34:25] so how how did this happen
[1:34:28] now we have no abraham and sarah
[1:34:31] and god speaks to you to them
[1:34:33] you will have a son one day
[1:34:35] now both are getting old
[1:34:38] now the day comes when three men come to
[1:34:40] abraham
[1:34:44] abraham sees exactly who that is that
[1:34:46] was god
[1:34:48] one was just billy graham the other one
[1:34:49] was all robert but the other one was
[1:34:51] the son of man and a son of man he knows
[1:34:54] exactly who's standing there
[1:34:56] exactly so
[1:34:58] so they just start a little conversation
[1:35:02] keep one thing in mind
[1:35:06] abraham must have thought i hope he does
[1:35:07] not ask now about that promise because
[1:35:09] there is nobody
[1:35:11] god all the time knew one thing abraham
[1:35:14] you will not make it
[1:35:17] because i made sarah sterile stereo god
[1:35:20] knew that
[1:35:22] god gave him something to do in you you
[1:35:24] will not make it
[1:35:27] and and i can see abraham he was so
[1:35:29] embarrassed here a lot we tried
[1:35:31] everything uh everything off of fertile
[1:35:33] institute and we
[1:35:36] we we went at this seminary and this
[1:35:38] seminary but not nothing worked really
[1:35:40] and god was just thinking about himself
[1:35:42] i know
[1:35:43] i know i made it impossible for you
[1:35:47] made it impossible
[1:35:48] because it was me making sarah sterile
[1:35:51] [Music]
[1:35:52] so so so everyone said and we went to
[1:35:54] church and we were praying and we were
[1:35:56] praying and god said yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:36:00] but it had to be the appointed time
[1:36:03] [Applause]
[1:36:04] i had to come
[1:36:07] amen it must be god
[1:36:09] do you understand this message is not
[1:36:11] you have to work yourself
[1:36:13] more and more and no more brother and if
[1:36:16] i know the seventh seal i got it that's
[1:36:18] not it
[1:36:20] sometimes people have a wonderful
[1:36:21] understanding but have an arrogant
[1:36:22] spirit but we need a reality
[1:36:26] of somebody really so in tune with god
[1:36:29] that he comes you can say he
[1:36:31] she is him and he is her
[1:36:35] and god knows one thing
[1:36:37] my little children
[1:36:39] i'm i'm i'm i'm love to see you all what
[1:36:42] you can do but the rapture you will not
[1:36:43] make it
[1:36:45] i must be your rapture
[1:36:47] martin luther found out he is my justice
[1:36:51] john wesley said i served him more than
[1:36:54] ever
[1:36:55] john john wesley didn't say okay okay ah
[1:36:58] i understand so we go in the pub next
[1:37:00] week no no he was he was more fervent
[1:37:03] than ever
[1:37:04] but he changed his attitude
[1:37:07] he said i will not do it to to achieve
[1:37:10] anything for god but i do it because i
[1:37:13] accept the love of god for my life
[1:37:17] therefore if you'd if you are legalized
[1:37:19] by love continue that way
[1:37:23] if your legal is by pharah to be a
[1:37:25] pharisee you know brother
[1:37:27] i'm so happy in our circle is different
[1:37:30] it's different
[1:37:32] forget it it must be the love of god
[1:37:37] and if you see something wrong on your
[1:37:39] brother and your heart goes lord help my
[1:37:41] brother there's too much worthiness
[1:37:43] around it
[1:37:44] help him
[1:37:46] brother that is the love of god bringing
[1:37:47] us up can you say amen
[1:37:50] therefore and then god comes and he said
[1:37:52] how could i hide to abraham all these
[1:37:54] things
[1:37:55] knowing he goes in the rapture
[1:37:57] [Laughter]
[1:38:00] this is a tremendous time a person says
[1:38:04] uh
[1:38:04] brother marcus i want to tell you one
[1:38:06] thing
[1:38:07] i'm not in the bright age bright age is
[1:38:09] part of laodicea there's no
[1:38:10] contradiction at all
[1:38:12] it's part of it all is on top of it but
[1:38:15] it's connected both
[1:38:17] brother marcus i want to let you know
[1:38:19] one thing
[1:38:21] i am in loud is here i said that might
[1:38:23] be
[1:38:25] but not me
[1:38:27] it's complete it's correct what you say
[1:38:29] but not for me
[1:38:30] because i understood shalom
[1:38:33] good morning
[1:38:35] the night is over
[1:38:37] in finnish
[1:38:39] good morning church
[1:38:41] brother bennett was the star in the
[1:38:43] night but there was a change in the king
[1:38:45] of the light what is it's the sun
[1:38:48] it's here
[1:38:49] what time it's the rising of the sun
[1:38:54] and brother brahem says it like this he
[1:38:56] says he says that stone that was holding
[1:39:00] jesus he said that was denominational
[1:39:02] things and god came with an earthquake
[1:39:05] in our time and rolled that stone away
[1:39:08] and he says this he took away the stone
[1:39:10] from us that we understand who we are
[1:39:14] and we read the message and we
[1:39:16] understand hey hey and we look in the
[1:39:18] mirror and we say mama hey that's me
[1:39:21] that's me
[1:39:24] i see myself i'm not better than anybody
[1:39:26] else but that's me
[1:39:29] can you say amen
[1:39:30] once you see the love of god you're not
[1:39:33] judgmental
[1:39:34] you cannot because you understand it was
[1:39:36] just god alone
[1:39:38] no you we're stopping on our
[1:39:40] you know we we are a little bit better
[1:39:42] than the rest forget you didn't get the
[1:39:43] picture
[1:39:44] no you didn't get the picture and
[1:39:46] because you know our sleeves are long
[1:39:47] and our forget it sometimes people can
[1:39:49] have a wonderful appearance but the
[1:39:52] inside i tell you you just want to shake
[1:39:55] his hand from 30 meters god bless you
[1:39:58] shalom
[1:40:02] you understand it
[1:40:03] what we need this message is not a
[1:40:05] doctrine it's a heart of god revealed
[1:40:09] god wants to look down on his children
[1:40:11] he said now they understood what love is
[1:40:14] love is not a feeling lot is love is a
[1:40:16] person
[1:40:18] abraham was so in love when lot was in
[1:40:20] that situation he was just running after
[1:40:22] him
[1:40:23] blessed be the name of the lord can you
[1:40:25] say amen
[1:40:27] oh the justice of god he is my justice
[1:40:30] he is my rapture
[1:40:31] he is my holiness
[1:40:33] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:40:35] musicians would come
[1:40:37] and and and and and and
[1:40:39] hallelujah amen if the musicians would
[1:40:42] come amen
[1:40:44] can you say amen
[1:40:46] amen in this message
[1:40:49] what a message from our father
[1:40:51] this message has heart and soul
[1:40:54] i mean this message is more than just i
[1:40:57] know this and i know that no
[1:41:00] brother blame said complex has come by
[1:41:02] knowledge
[1:41:03] some thinks he does more than the rest
[1:41:05] so i cannot you know
[1:41:07] i cannot be really fair because you know
[1:41:08] we're a little bit forget man
[1:41:11] i mean our our father was so great he
[1:41:14] just reached down
[1:41:16] became one of them and jericho
[1:41:18] i know but i do it for our color for
[1:41:20] black people for the first time yeah and
[1:41:21] they never saw me preaching i know you
[1:41:23] saw it 10 times that i was making it
[1:41:26] but there was a young just to show how
[1:41:27] our father is and i tell you one thing
[1:41:29] if you're the son of your father you
[1:41:31] will get that nature
[1:41:32] but it takes time it takes a little bit
[1:41:33] of life experience takes a little bit
[1:41:35] being in that sun to become ripened you
[1:41:38] know
[1:41:39] here's a young man and he wants to buy
[1:41:41] some dog i mean and and the owner of the
[1:41:44] dogs he comes down and the boy says i
[1:41:47] want to have this dog and the owner says
[1:41:48] hey what do you want with this dog i
[1:41:50] mean he cannot walk he can he's
[1:41:52] handicapped he he's not cheater he has
[1:41:55] no words what do you want that dog and
[1:41:56] when the boy he was putting up his
[1:41:58] trousers from his knee on he had an
[1:42:01] artificial leg
[1:42:02] and the boy said i want to have this
[1:42:03] door because when we go out he
[1:42:05] understands me and i understand him
[1:42:08] and brother brahm says this quote
[1:42:09] brother branham god became man to
[1:42:11] understand man
[1:42:14] quote brother branham god became
[1:42:15] teenager to understand the teenagers
[1:42:18] that when you pray god knows what you
[1:42:20] talk about you can even talk about lust
[1:42:22] or whatever you can talk with your
[1:42:23] father he knows what it is because he
[1:42:25] was a human being
[1:42:27] what a father
[1:42:28] therefore the rapture is not that god is
[1:42:30] just standing there okay
[1:42:33] bcf
[1:42:34] maybe
[1:42:37] amen
[1:42:38] amen the rapture is not god is just
[1:42:40] seeing who will make it the raptures our
[1:42:42] father comes and takes me home
[1:42:45] it was not elijah
[1:42:47] searching for that chariot
[1:42:49] but it was the chariot searching for
[1:42:51] elijah
[1:42:53] your own theophany will pick you up one
[1:42:55] day it's not far away it's exactly there
[1:42:59] blessed be the name of the lord if our
[1:43:01] earthly tabernacle will be dissolved we
[1:43:04] have a building from god
[1:43:06] not merited
[1:43:08] not we were born with it
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:11] and all our christian life is the
[1:43:13] expression of our gratitude to god
[1:43:16] so you can wish well to every sinner you
[1:43:18] can just say i don't agree with you but
[1:43:20] can i make life easier for you
[1:43:22] i maybe i will preach one day i'm always
[1:43:24] in contact even with people who left the
[1:43:26] message or left left our church
[1:43:29] i believe our young people are still
[1:43:31] part of us
[1:43:32] we still are responsible for them
[1:43:35] so i'm just
[1:43:36] sending a little whatsapp how are you
[1:43:38] doing

[1:43:41] the mindset that they have and brother

[1:44:47] do you know one thing
[1:44:49] we did a lot of trouble to our father
[1:44:52] a lot of things a lot of foolish things
[1:44:54] i'm a minister and i'm ashamed of some
[1:44:56] of the things that i did not willfully
[1:44:58] but we didn't have
[1:45:00] the maturity yet no we didn't okay god
[1:45:03] knew it in the beginning
[1:45:05] but i believe my father was never
[1:45:07] ashamed of me
[1:45:09] no he said look that boy one day
[1:45:12] once he sees it he becomes a different
[1:45:13] man
[1:45:15] yeah amen
[1:45:16] therefore we need a lot of grace for one
[1:45:18] another
[1:45:19] do you see something there's message
[1:45:20] people that cannot forgive
[1:45:22] they cannot forget
[1:45:24] amen they always have a story to tell
[1:45:26] you say brother you're a wonderful
[1:45:27] preacher but the main thing is missing
[1:45:29] her you're missing the main thing you
[1:45:30] don't get the thing you didn't get the
[1:45:32] core of that message you don't know what
[1:45:34] the love of god is
[1:45:36] you always have to tell what people had
[1:45:37] to do and what then how you suffered
[1:45:39] that's fine it takes time
[1:45:41] healing of the lord but it cannot be
[1:45:42] your whole life stop it i mean you have
[1:45:45] a father
[1:45:46] can you say amen
[1:45:48] therefore do you have the song i have a
[1:45:50] father do you know it i know they know
[1:45:52] because i'm always singing it you know
[1:45:54] the song
[1:45:56] you understand i'm a little bit here at
[1:45:57] home okay it's such a it's such a
[1:45:59] liberty that it's just wonderful and you
[1:46:02] see even these starchy germans from time
[1:46:04] to time you know
[1:46:05] i i was i was one time in in another
[1:46:08] church maybe the brother will remember
[1:46:10] uh uh years ago and the pastor it was my
[1:46:12] first time there
[1:46:14] and uh he he he took a little bit too
[1:46:16] much time
[1:46:17] i respect places you know
[1:46:20] but he took too much time as he felt and
[1:46:22] he said oh we understand we have brother
[1:46:24] marcus here he's one of those hitler
[1:46:25] boys
[1:46:26] and i was in the office
[1:46:28] what kind of impression did i give i'm a
[1:46:31] christian i'm a brother not a hitler boy
[1:46:33] man you see
[1:46:34] but
[1:46:36] you know one thing the difference
[1:46:38] between god's mind and your mind
[1:46:42] here's
[1:46:43] here is
[1:46:44] uh
[1:46:46] job
[1:46:47] quote of the bible
[1:46:49] curse be the day when i was born
[1:46:52] cursed be the day
[1:46:54] and god at the same time says do you see
[1:46:57] my servant job

[1:47:01] the best man on the earth
[1:47:03] job says curse me
[1:47:05] god says i'm so it's such a wonderful
[1:47:07] man
[1:47:10] you have to see yourself like god sees
[1:47:13] you
[1:47:14] that will transform us in the in the
[1:47:16] love of god
[1:47:18] not who is the strictest
[1:47:20] but love brings automatically holiness
[1:47:24] decency but the source must be love
[1:47:28] understand who you are
[1:47:29] understand somebody pay the price for
[1:47:31] you
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:34] when we were unworthy god said this is
[1:47:36] my son
[1:47:37] i'm therefore we treat brothers like
[1:47:39] this we see that things are going wrong
[1:47:41] but we just bring him to the hand of god
[1:47:44] and say heavenly father you had much
[1:47:46] patience with me help my brother
[1:47:49] that can you say amen

[1:51:14] apostle had
[1:51:16] the lord is my joy the lord is my
[1:51:18] justice

[1:51:26] brother lord let me be a help for those
[1:51:28] who don't see it

[1:51:30] never let me have an arrogant spirit of
[1:51:32] his people
[1:51:33] even when it comes to sinners lord you
[1:51:35] have everybody in your hands who am i to
[1:51:38] tell who is who you are the almighty
[1:51:42] is there anything too hard for the lord
[1:51:45] father in heaven so we raise our hands
[1:51:47] to you
[1:51:48] and ask
[1:51:50] just
[1:51:51] enlarge that vision i believe and i'm
[1:51:54] sure his eagles this evening
[1:51:57] family of god royal family
[1:51:59] but i'm speaking to myself sometimes we
[1:52:01] are caught up in our human
[1:52:04] ways
[1:52:05] our human feelings our human
[1:52:08] disasters sometimes
[1:52:10] but lord you always take us a little bit
[1:52:12] higher into that
[1:52:14] higher dimension of seeing what's all
[1:52:16] about
[1:52:18] lord we have a lot of problems among us
[1:52:20] and most of these problems we will not
[1:52:22] solve them
[1:52:23] we have to live with them
[1:52:25] but give us grace to always keep our
[1:52:27] head above all circumstances
[1:52:31] no matter what comes on this earth
[1:52:33] no matter what goes
[1:52:35] but lord let us have a clear vision of
[1:52:37] who we are
[1:52:39] lord if when we are attacked
[1:52:41] when we are in nervous frustrations
[1:52:45] let us never react because we will say
[1:52:48] things that we shouldn't say
[1:52:50] we will do things that we should never
[1:52:52] do and lord
[1:52:54] i think about myself we did a lot of
[1:52:56] mistakes please forgive us father
[1:52:58] it's not that we sinned but we didn't
[1:53:00] see the real picture about the whole
[1:53:02] thing
[1:53:02] we didn't see the bigger picture we
[1:53:04] thought our picture is a true picture
[1:53:06] but you have a you have a family father
[1:53:09] family is not only me
[1:53:11] you have many brothers and many sisters

[1:53:21] when i
[1:53:22] meet somebody let me be a blessing to
[1:53:24] them

[1:53:27] lost their courage father

[1:53:41] for somebody who has no hope
