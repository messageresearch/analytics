[0:00] now the whole scene plays out they're
[0:02] coming out of the land and now Naomi's
[0:04] telling them there's no hope for you
[0:06] girls amen I cannot bear you another son
[0:09] Amen to replace the husbands you've lost
[0:11] if I had a husband today and I became
[0:14] pregnant today would you wait 18 19 20
[0:17] years to have a no you go back to your
[0:20] Homeland and there was two women there
[0:22] and they each made a different choice
[0:25] they made a different decision and one
[0:27] decided to go back what was her what was
[0:29] her motive for going back
[0:31] self-preservation
[0:33] she Naomi already told her I'm destitute
[0:36] I'm desolate I have nothing I have
[0:38] nothing to offer you if you come with me
[0:39] you'll have nothing
[0:41] so she decided that's not the life I
[0:43] want
[0:44] I want something out of life so she goes
[0:47] back amen but Ruth was willing to give
[0:50] up her life amen she had a genuine love
[0:52] for Naomi that superseded her love
[0:54] herself
[0:56] and she began to make this decision I'll
[0:59] go with you don't make me leave you
[1:01] where you go all go where you live I'll
[1:02] live where you die I'll die your God
[1:04] will be my God your people my what did
[1:06] she say I'm not turning back I'm not
[1:08] going any other way she made a clean-cut
[1:11] decision
[1:13] when President preaches Amen on this he
[1:15] preaches the four phases of Ruth he
[1:17] preaches Ruth deciding Ruth working and
[1:19] and all these things but she had to make
[1:22] a clear-cut decision and that decision
[1:24] brought a whole sequence of events in
[1:27] her life
[1:29] not one decision little did she know how
[1:32] could she at that time know that that
[1:34] decision she made would make her in the
[1:36] lineage of Christ one of the mothers of
[1:38] Christ she would bring forth Obed and oh
[1:40] better bring forth Jesse and Jesse would
[1:42] bring forth King David she was going to
[1:44] be a mother of the king line
[1:47] how could she know that she didn't know
[1:49] that she was just moved by her love for
[1:51] Naomi and she made a clear-cut decision
[1:53] she wasn't waffling she wasn't in
[1:55] between she wasn't saying I'll go along
[1:57] for a while and see how it pans out if
[2:00] she had decided that way she would have
[2:02] left when she was beating out her own
[2:04] barley in the field
[2:06] because it wasn't an easy way it wasn't
[2:08] an easy Road and I'm telling you I think
[2:10] so many times people follow this message
[2:13] wishy-washy amen and said I'm going to
[2:15] go along or I'll go to this church or
[2:16] I'll make this decision or I'll go along
[2:18] amen because we've seen when troubles
[2:21] come they vanish amen when things go
[2:23] south and when things go sour when
[2:25] churches fail when Ministries fail amen
[2:27] when it looks like amen the prophets
[2:29] Ministries failing they all vanish away
[2:31] amen but I I want to make a clear-cut
[2:34] decision and say this is the truth this
[2:38] is Christ amen
[2:40] I live in this message I'll die in this
[2:43] message I'll die believing this message
