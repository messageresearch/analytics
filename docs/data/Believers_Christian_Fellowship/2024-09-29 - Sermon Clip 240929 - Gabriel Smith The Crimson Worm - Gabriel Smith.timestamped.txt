[0:00] to me friends all I'm trying to say is
[0:02] this no matter what you're struggling
[0:04] with today there is no excuse that you
[0:07] can't come Victorious today there's no
[0:10] reason for any one of us to leave this
[0:14] Sanctuary beat down tore down distraught
[0:17] whatever it may be there is no
[0:20] reason
[0:23] because even if you do only see yourself
[0:28] as something as little in insignificant
[0:31] as a worm God's mindful enough to have a
[0:34] type in Shadow just for you amen just to
[0:37] help you with your
[0:40] insecurities just to help you with your
[0:42] shortcomings and how little you feel and
[0:45] I can't see myself as a lamb I can't see
[0:47] myself as a lion I can't see myself as
[0:50] an eagle
[0:52] okay that's
[0:54] fine let's start with a
[0:57] worm and when you get the worm down
[1:01] you're going to get a little bit of
[1:02] Courage about you you're going to have a
[1:04] little bit you're going to go oh I'm a
[1:07] bloody
[1:08] worm I'm a crimson worm I can do
[1:14] that I can give my life I can do that
[1:18] too and then as you walk in this thing
[1:22] called life you'll
[1:24] mature and then you'll start seeing
[1:26] yourself as a lamb yes and and guess
[1:30] what we'll all be waiting here for
[1:32] you till you change and transform and
[1:38] you get your
[1:41] wings and then you realize I am an eagle
[1:44] sir because listen we ain't going to
[1:47] leave until you get it right right and
[1:49] that's fine because the Saints of old
[1:52] had waited so many years for me I'm
[1:54] willing to wait for you and if I'm the
[1:57] one that's holding you back I hope
[1:58] you're willing to wait for me too
[2:01] because we have all got to get to the
[2:03] place where we stop living this beat
[2:05] down defeated life look the Bible tells
[2:08] us and from Jesus Christ who is the
[2:11] faithful witness and the first begotten
[2:13] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[2:15] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[2:17] washed us from our own sins in his blood
[2:21] that washed means to be
[2:25] loosed and that's what the blood of the
[2:27] almighty does it looses us amen it sets
[2:32] us free amen and we can be free indeed
[2:35] this morning do y'all believe that am oh
[2:38] my
