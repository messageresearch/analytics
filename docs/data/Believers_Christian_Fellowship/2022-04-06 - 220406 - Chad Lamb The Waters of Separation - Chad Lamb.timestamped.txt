[11:51] on our own lord
[11:52] as we surrender to you we pray that you
[11:54] would come lord and move through us lord
[11:57] and live through us as you promised to
[11:58] do
[11:59] i pray god that you would take us this
[12:01] evening lord and that you would plant
[12:03] your word so deep into our hearts lord
[12:06] may it take root there and grow and
[12:07] produce the fruit that you desired for
[12:09] this age i pray to take this vessel of
[12:12] mine into your hands lord and use it for
[12:15] your glory speak through these lips the
[12:17] words of eternal life that we have need
[12:19] of in this hour
[12:20] we love you lord we desire to magnify
[12:23] your name we desire to serve you more
[12:25] than ever before we pray you take that
[12:28] desire lord of ours and make it a
[12:30] reality in our lives
[12:32] for only you can do that lord
[12:34] we surrender to you and ask that you
[12:36] would take preeminence this evening in
[12:38] jesus christ's name we pray
[12:40] amen
[12:42] amen god bless you all and while we're
[12:44] standing let's take our bibles and we'll
[12:45] turn to the book of revelation chapter
[12:47] one
[12:49] one let you know that we took the
[12:51] vote of confidence for the trustees and
[12:53] sunday school superintendent uh this
[12:55] past sunday at the communion service and
[12:57] the congregation overwhelmingly
[12:59] confirmed these brothers in their
[13:01] offices so we thank god for that
[13:03] and that was a blessing also i talked
[13:05] about the dave wood today and sister
[13:07] bessie wood's surgery went really well i
[13:09] mean everything's going really well
[13:11] and she looks like she'll spend the
[13:12] night there tonight and go home tomorrow
[13:14] but the doctor was really pleased with
[13:16] how everything went said it went very
[13:17] smooth and he expects her to have a
[13:19] quick recovery so thank god so remember
[13:22] our brother jonathan he goes in uh
[13:23] tomorrow to have his foot reconstructed
[13:25] so we're praying that he has a good
[13:27] testimony as well amen
[13:29] so let's all just bind ourselves
[13:31] together in faith and uphold one another
[13:33] amen
[13:35] we have a few visitors i'd like to greet
[13:37] and then brother paul and sister norah
[13:39] jean from new brunswick's here again
[13:41] amen they were able to stay over so
[13:43] praise the lord they were here sunday
[13:44] and they're here wednesday praise god
[13:46] that was wonderful also rebecca simonson
[13:49] there she is god bless you she came for
[13:51] a visit so it's really nice to have her
[13:52] back and mankova has blocked her out for
[13:55] a while but she's back now so thank god
[13:57] for that and also i was told there's a
[13:59] couple from arkansas brother terry and
[14:01] sister pam is that you back there rose
[14:03] god bless you welcome it's good to have
[14:05] you here
[14:06] so yeah you never know who's going to
[14:08] come and visit so you're all very
[14:10] welcome it's a pleasure to have you
[14:12] amen let's look at revelation chapter 1
[14:14] verse 5
[14:20] and from jesus christ who is the
[14:21] faithful witness and the first begotten
[14:23] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[14:25] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[14:28] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[14:31] amen you can have your seats
[14:33] may the lord bless us as we read his
[14:35] word and bless his word
[14:38] amen i i wanted to take for a subject
[14:41] today uh the waters of separation
[14:44] and i was meditating on this for a
[14:45] little while
[14:47] and i thought i would go another
[14:48] direction but i woke up this morning and
[14:50] i knew we were coming here and so it's
[14:53] been a blessing let's turn to the book
[14:54] of numbers and we'll get our context for
[14:56] this out of the book of numbers
[15:02] numbers chapter 19.
[15:04] we'll start there and if i could teach
[15:07] it as a sunday school get lesson again
[15:08] as we did on sunday and go through this
[15:11] and see how the lord leads
[15:13] but we'll begin with verse one
[15:14] revelation sorry numbers 19
[15:17] and 1.
[15:20] numbers 19-1 and the lord spake unto
[15:22] moses and unto aaron saying this is the
[15:25] ordinance of the law which is the which
[15:27] the lord hath commanded saying speak
[15:29] unto the children of israel that they
[15:31] bring thee a red heifer without spot
[15:34] where it is no blemish and upon which
[15:36] never came a yoke and ye shall give her
[15:39] unto eleazar the priest and he may bring
[15:41] her forth without the camp and one shall
[15:44] slay her before his face
[15:46] and eleazar the priest shall take of her
[15:48] blood with his finger and sprinkle of
[15:50] her blood directly before the tabernacle
[15:52] of the congregation seven times
[15:55] and one shall burn the heifer in his
[15:57] sight her skin and her flesh and her
[16:00] blood with her tongue shall he burn
[16:03] and the priest shall take cedar wood and
[16:05] hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the
[16:08] midst of the burning of the heifer
[16:10] now let's skip down to verse 9
[16:13] and a man that is clean shall gather up
[16:16] the ashes of the heifer and lay them up
[16:18] without the camp in a clean place
[16:21] and it shall be kept for the
[16:23] congregation of the children of israel
[16:25] for a water of separation it is a
[16:27] purification for sin
[16:30] so this is a interesting
[16:32] portion of the scripture here in numbers
[16:34] an interesting commandment that god had
[16:36] given to moses and moses was instructed
[16:39] to take this heifer this perfect heifer
[16:42] to burn slay her and burn her without
[16:44] the camp and there's very specific
[16:46] instructions that he gave to what to do
[16:48] but we know that these ashes were to be
[16:50] kept outside the camp and they were to
[16:52] be kept by a clean man
[16:54] and they were they were for the
[16:56] congregation of the children of israel
[16:57] for a water separation it is a
[17:00] purification for sin and so i just want
[17:03] to look at what the prophet of god says
[17:05] about this because it's interesting
[17:07] where this came up and i came across
[17:09] this in the message thinking man's
[17:11] filter and i actually didn't expect that
[17:13] i was i was looking this up somewhere
[17:15] else and the thought came to me of
[17:17] waters of separation and i came in
[17:19] contact with that phrase that brother
[17:21] branham uses while i was studying
[17:23] something else but i went to go look it
[17:25] came up and brother branham really
[17:26] labored on this and thinking man's
[17:28] filter and as we go along i think we'll
[17:30] find out why
[17:32] actually by the time i got done studying
[17:34] i realized that was thinking this is
[17:36] what thinking man's filter is really
[17:37] about
[17:38] the waters of separation
[17:40] so in 1961 the prophet of god says in
[17:43] the message the basis of fellowship now
[17:45] we noticed that when the heifer was to
[17:47] be killed in the evening time before all
[17:49] the congregation so was christ killed in
[17:51] the evening time now when she was to be
[17:53] killed her body was to be burned with
[17:55] the hooves and all and it was to make a
[17:57] water of separation
[17:59] now we get
[18:00] we get in that over in the book of
[18:02] ephesians where we're washed by the
[18:04] water of the word the waters of
[18:06] separation is the word of god
[18:09] so now there was a water of separation
[18:10] given to them in the old testament that
[18:12] was for purification of sin
[18:15] but now brother brennam's taking and
[18:17] taking the waters of purification moving
[18:19] it over to the new testament into
[18:21] ephesians and now he's saying that that
[18:23] it's the waters of separation which is
[18:25] the word of god
[18:27] now let's look at that in ephesians
[18:29] chapter 5.
[18:37] ephesians chapter 5.
[18:43] and verse 25.
[18:47] ephesians 5 and 25 husbands love your
[18:50] wives even as christ also loved the
[18:52] church and gave himself for it that he
[18:55] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[18:56] washing of water by the word this is the
[18:59] scripture brother branham's referring to
[19:01] this is the washing of the water by the
[19:03] word this is what he's calling the
[19:05] waters of separation
[19:07] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[19:08] with the washing of water by the word
[19:10] that he might present it to himself a
[19:12] glorious church not having spot or
[19:14] wrinkle or any such thing but it should
[19:16] be holy and without blemish
[19:19] now when we go to the beginning of
[19:21] thinking man's filter in paragraph 23
[19:23] right in the beginning he goes to two
[19:25] scriptures and i've always enjoyed
[19:27] watching how brother bannon begins a
[19:29] sermon and what scriptures he uses and
[19:31] what scriptures he ties together so here
[19:34] in 1965 this is august 22nd in 1965 he
[19:38] preaches a thinking man's filter and he
[19:40] starts with numbers 9 9. he says we want
[19:43] to read this text through this scripture
[19:44] rather and a man that is clean shall
[19:46] gather up the ashes of the heifer and
[19:48] shall lay them up without the camp in a
[19:50] clean place and it shall be kept for the
[19:52] congregation watch now for the
[19:55] congregation of the children of israel
[19:57] for a water separation it is a
[19:59] purification for sin
[20:02] notice not to everybody
[20:05] to the congregation of the children
[20:07] israel the waters of separation
[20:09] so it was to separate them out from the
[20:12] world to himself and it was only for the
[20:14] congregation of israel and it was a
[20:17] purification for sin
[20:19] and then he goes and he says now in
[20:21] ephesians the fifth chapter and
[20:22] beginning with the 22nd verse and he
[20:24] goes through and reads just a few more
[20:26] scriptures before where we started and
[20:28] reads all the way through to the bottom
[20:30] where he says that he might sanctify and
[20:31] cleanse it with the washing of water by
[20:33] the word so in the beginning of thinking
[20:35] man's filter that message brother benham
[20:37] starts with two scriptures he starts
[20:39] with numbers 19 9 the the waters
[20:42] of separation which is a purification
[20:45] for sin and the ashes of the red heifer
[20:47] and then he ties that to ephesians
[20:49] chapter 5 when jesus will wash his bride
[20:53] wash his church in the water of the word
[20:56] cleansing it with the washing of the
[20:58] water of the word so we know now that
[21:01] the ashes of the red heifer in the and
[21:03] the waters of separation was
[21:05] foreshadowing something that's coming
[21:07] later so god was laying in the old
[21:09] testament a pattern he was laying
[21:11] something to foreshadow something that's
[21:13] coming in the future
[21:15] now back in the message the basis of
[21:17] fellowship the prophet of god says now
[21:19] watch this symbol here now the heifer
[21:21] was to be burnt and with her was to be
[21:23] burnt hyssop cedar scarlet was to be
[21:26] burnt together with the heifer
[21:28] now let's go back to numbers 19 and take
[21:31] a look at this
[21:39] numbers 19.
[21:46] and i'll just
[21:48] begin at verse 2.
[21:50] this is the ordinance of the law which
[21:51] is the lord hath commanded saying speak
[21:53] unto the children of israel that they
[21:54] bring thee a red heifer without spot
[21:59] wearing is no blemish and upon which
[22:01] never came yoke
[22:03] this is super interesting it's very
[22:06] specific and for one they wanted a red
[22:08] heifer red is the color of redemption
[22:10] amen color of blood the color of
[22:12] redemption a heifer is virgin
[22:15] and so once once a cow is bred she
[22:17] becomes a cow amen but when she's young
[22:19] before she's bred and has a calf she's a
[22:21] heifer so it's showing that it must be
[22:23] virgin it must be red there is no spot
[22:27] amen that means it's perfect it's
[22:29] complete there's no sin and without
[22:31] blemish it's perfect
[22:34] so there must be a perfect word amen it
[22:37] must be absolutely perfect and it must
[22:39] be the color of redemption it must not
[22:42] have a spot it must not have a blemish
[22:44] and it must be virgin
[22:48] and then he goes on to say upon which
[22:50] never came a yoke
[22:53] it could never be under the bondage of
[22:56] man
[22:57] this there's got to be a word amen
[23:00] there's got to be a pure word a
[23:02] redemptive word without spot without
[23:05] blemish that has not been manhandled
[23:09] amen this word is so perfect amen the
[23:11] scriptures are so perfect amen that
[23:13] christ has become
[23:15] our sacrifice and this sacrifice brother
[23:17] ben tells us amen is showing christ
[23:19] christ is the fulfillment of this amen
[23:21] and it must be perfect it must be virgin
[23:24] it must be a pure redemption a pure word
[23:27] that has never been under the bondage or
[23:29] the control of man
[23:32] so god has got to provide amen a word of
[23:35] redemption that's perfect amen and never
[23:38] manhandled
[23:40] have we received it in this day
[23:42] praise god
[23:45] and then he says
[23:47] and you shall give her to elias of the
[23:48] priest that he may bring her forth
[23:50] without the camp
[23:53] this sacrifice was slain outside the
[23:56] camp where was christ's lane outside the
[23:58] camp outside the walls of jerusalem
[24:00] outside the religious order and the same
[24:02] thing's true today
[24:05] we're saying outside the camp
[24:09] and one shall slay her before his face
[24:12] an eliezer shall take
[24:14] the take of her blood with his finger
[24:17] and sprinkle of her blood directly
[24:19] before the tabernacle of the
[24:20] congregation seven times
[24:24] and one shall burn the heifer in his
[24:26] sight her skin and her flesh and her
[24:28] blood with her tongue shall he burn
[24:31] so this is an absolute complete whole
[24:35] burning when we get the ashes of the
[24:37] heifer there's nothing left out
[24:40] hooves blood
[24:42] everything so the priest will take a
[24:44] portion of the blood go to the
[24:46] tabernacle and sprinkle before the door
[24:48] of the tabernacle seven times amen and
[24:51] brother ben will tell us we'll get to
[24:52] the quote in a minute that that
[24:53] represents the blood of jesus christ for
[24:55] seven church ages amen that as you pass
[24:58] into the tabernacle it's always through
[25:00] the blood there's one door that's christ
[25:02] amen before the door is seven
[25:04] sprinklings of blood amen that
[25:05] represents the blood of christ for seven
[25:07] church ages brings entrance into the
[25:09] tabernacle
[25:11] so everything types christ amen
[25:14] so so then the rest of the blood stays
[25:18] with the sacrifice with the hooves with
[25:21] the dung with everything nothing is
[25:24] removed
[25:26] and it's all burnt so that when it's
[25:27] burnt down when you have the ashes you
[25:29] have all the word amen
[25:32] the whole word
[25:33] the perfect word the virgin word the
[25:36] non-handled by man word
[25:39] complete
[25:42] amen verse 6 and the priest shall take
[25:45] cedar wood
[25:46] and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into
[25:49] the midst of the burning of the heifer
[25:53] brother bam says here now we're back in
[25:56] the message the basis of fellowship
[25:59] the heifer was to be burnt and with her
[26:00] was to burn hyssop and cedar and scarlet
[26:04] was to be burnt together with the heifer
[26:05] now notice cedar is a redwood stained
[26:08] wood white and red together if you've
[26:11] ever split cedar you know that in the
[26:13] middle cedar it's got a streak of red
[26:15] that runs up it and outside is white
[26:17] so it's the red running through the
[26:19] white and this is what he says it's is a
[26:22] redwood stained wood white and red
[26:24] together symbolizing the cross
[26:28] and scarlet as ram's wool died in blood
[26:32] so scarlet is wool died in blood and
[26:34] hyssop was weeds that was put in with it
[26:37] hyssop is what you applied the blood by
[26:39] remember when we talked about the
[26:40] passover hyssop was what they dipped in
[26:43] the blood and they applied the blood on
[26:44] the lentil and the doorpost with hyssop
[26:46] and brother bam told us hyssop is just a
[26:48] common weed amen because it just takes
[26:50] common faith amen not a work up not some
[26:52] super duper just common faith to take
[26:54] god at his word and believe and accept
[26:56] what he said to be true and that's what
[26:58] it takes to apply the blood so in these
[27:01] ashes of the red heifer is the cross
[27:04] the word calvary
[27:07] the lamb the ram the wool dyed red the
[27:10] scarlet
[27:11] and the hyssop to apply it with
[27:14] it's all burnt together
[27:17] oh i love this message
[27:21] sprinkle from the sins with the waters
[27:22] of separation oh you know what when i
[27:24] was a boy growing up in church amen we
[27:27] would read the old testament and all it
[27:29] was was sunday school stories and it was
[27:31] all about giants and swords and battles
[27:34] and and all of this but the prophet of
[27:36] god come and he gave us one word one
[27:39] book tied it all together and said that
[27:41] the old testament was foreshadowing amen
[27:43] the coming of christ and foreshadowed
[27:45] the new testament
[27:47] and so now all of these things represent
[27:49] christ amen all of them represent
[27:51] calvary and redemption and what's been
[27:54] given to us so these ashes of a red
[27:56] heifer are the waters of separation that
[27:59] separate out israel from the world and
[28:02] it's a purification for sin
[28:05] now we come back to thinking man's
[28:07] filter
[28:08] 1965
[28:09] and then her body was taken and burnt it
[28:12] was burnt with the hoof with the skin
[28:14] with the intestines with the dung
[28:15] everything was burnt together and it had
[28:18] to be picked up by a clean man and had
[28:21] to be put in a clean place outside the
[28:23] congregation
[28:24] therefore if israel could only see the
[28:27] time this word of god must not be
[28:30] handled by dirty hands of unbelief
[28:33] it's got to be a clean man and if he's
[28:35] clean he had to come through god's
[28:37] filter
[28:38] a clean man cleans hands had to be kept
[28:40] in a clean place not a place where
[28:42] jezebels and rickies and everything
[28:44] partake and take communion and things
[28:46] when they're running around with wives
[28:48] and husbands and all kinds of filth
[28:49] going to dances and parties and wearing
[28:51] bobbed hair and shorts and everything
[28:53] else and calling themselves christians
[28:55] is to be kept in a clean place and
[28:57] handled with clean hands
[28:59] so where was that clean place outside
[29:01] the congregation amen and and since the
[29:04] church fell into ruin in the first
[29:05] church age god has kept the word amen
[29:09] it's been sealed it was sealed amen with
[29:12] seven thunders has been kept amen so
[29:14] that it would not be defiled it wasn't
[29:16] going to be kept in a congregation it
[29:18] was going to be defiled with all of
[29:20] these things but there was going to be a
[29:21] clean man with clean hands
[29:26] the clean man with clean hands was going
[29:28] to keep the blood
[29:30] and go to keep the ashes of the red
[29:31] heifer and keep it outside the systems
[29:34] of man
[29:36] keep it free from defilement
[29:40] then he says and then when israel sinned
[29:42] and recognized that they had done wrong
[29:44] then they were sprinkled with the ashes
[29:46] of this heifer upon them they would take
[29:48] and they would mix the ashes of the red
[29:50] heifer with water but they had to get
[29:52] running water they couldn't use stagnant
[29:55] water
[29:56] they couldn't use cistern water they
[29:58] couldn't use water men pulled up or man
[30:00] collected in the previous day and set in
[30:02] a bottle and sat in a can or pulled in a
[30:04] tub amen they had to have moving water
[30:07] living water fresh water and the water
[30:10] represents the word and it represents
[30:12] the spirit amen and whenever they were
[30:13] going to apply the ashes of the red
[30:15] heifer it must be applied with living
[30:17] water
[30:19] they're mixed together and then they
[30:21] become a sprinkling amen for the
[30:23] purification of sin so there's got to be
[30:26] amen a fresh word and a fresh outpouring
[30:28] of the spirit for each age
[30:32] so it couldn't be old water it had to be
[30:35] moving water running water living water
[30:40] and when they sprinkled with the ashes
[30:42] of this heifer upon them and that was
[30:44] the water of separation a purification
[30:46] for sin
[30:47] notice here it is and when israel before
[30:50] they could come into fellowship and in
[30:52] the worship they had to first pass
[30:54] through the waters of separation
[30:56] justification by faith cometh by hearing
[30:58] hearing the word then they entered into
[31:00] the congregation under those seven
[31:02] stripes the blood to show that something
[31:04] died and went before them for their sin
[31:07] they were separated by hearing the word
[31:09] the waters of separation then entered
[31:12] into fellowship
[31:13] the only place that god
[31:15] met a man was behind that order he
[31:17] wouldn't meet him anywhere else he had
[31:19] to come behind that order god only met
[31:22] israel in one place
[31:23] and god only meets you today in one
[31:25] place and that's in jesus christ and he
[31:28] is the word
[31:30] the waters of separation
[31:32] so what is the waters of separation
[31:34] jesus christ the word
[31:36] he's the waters of separation and his
[31:38] blood was shed for all seven church ages
[31:42] further down next paragraph he says also
[31:44] now
[31:45] we want to look at ephesians 5 26
[31:48] said it's the washing of the water by
[31:50] the word
[31:51] a waters of separation what does it then
[31:54] the filter of god is the word
[31:57] waters of separation washing of the
[31:59] waters of separation by the word god's
[32:02] filter
[32:03] then you can't come into christ through
[32:05] a church filter you cannot come by a
[32:07] denominational filter or a creed filter
[32:09] there is only one filter that you can
[32:11] enter into that holy place that's
[32:13] through the washing of the water by the
[32:15] word the word of god is a thinking man's
[32:18] filter
[32:19] so what is a filter used for a filter is
[32:23] used for purification
[32:25] so if you have a water filter amen a
[32:28] water filter is used to purify the water
[32:31] so if water passes through the filter
[32:33] the filter is there to collect anything
[32:35] that you don't want in the water so if
[32:38] you have a water filtration system at
[32:39] home or any kind of filtration system
[32:41] it's used for purification purification
[32:44] of air purification of water
[32:45] purification of any other uh fluid or
[32:48] whatever you have are filters for
[32:50] purification what was the waters of
[32:52] separation for purification
[32:55] so what is this all about that god has
[32:57] provided something that would purify his
[33:00] people amen and it's a water of
[33:02] separation to separate us from the world
[33:07] god has given us his word amen and we
[33:09] live in a day when it's not partial word
[33:11] partial understanding but it's the full
[33:13] revelation of the full word so there's
[33:15] been a pure filter restored to the
[33:17] people again a waters of separation that
[33:20] has come back to the church where we
[33:22] know that we can be clean
[33:24] it's no longer guessing there's no
[33:26] longer hoping i know i can be clean how
[33:29] can i be clean by surrendering to that
[33:31] word amen by just submitting to it and
[33:33] obeying it amen
[33:36] we make things so complicated sometimes
[33:38] that that i i how do i know i ride i
[33:40] want to be right oh i wish i was right
[33:42] amen the devil can get us on my wish i
[33:45] was right merry-go-round and i hope that
[33:46] i'm right amen but there's one way that
[33:49] we know that we're right
[33:50] it's when we surrender to this word
[33:54] there are things that that that we may
[33:56] not know decisions that we have to make
[33:58] and and we labor over those we want to
[34:01] be in the will of god and we want to do
[34:02] right and we make the decision the best
[34:04] way we know how to make the decision
[34:07] but if we filtered it through the word
[34:10] if there's no word hindering us
[34:13] from stepping right or left we just have
[34:15] to go by the leading of the lord the way
[34:16] we feel is right to go and trust that
[34:18] god will help us if we're wrong
[34:21] but we ought not to have so much anxiety
[34:24] over those things because there's been a
[34:26] water of purification and as long as
[34:28] we're surrendering to the word with all
[34:30] that we know god will take care of the
[34:32] rest
[34:34] where we can be nervous where we should
[34:36] have anxiety and fear is when we know
[34:38] we're not right with the word when we
[34:40] know the prophet of god has taught the
[34:42] scriptures in a way taught the conduct
[34:44] of a believer in a way and we knowingly
[34:46] refuse to walk in them
[34:48] that's where we can be nervous that's
[34:50] where we can have anxiety
[34:53] but if we're doing all that we know to
[34:54] do trust the word to be the filter and
[34:57] trust it to be the waters of separation
[35:00] that's why if we believe this message
[35:02] amen this this word that's been given to
[35:05] us is a water of separation that's why
[35:07] we should not act like look like talk
[35:09] like the rest of the world
[35:11] we should not act like talk like look
[35:13] like the worldly church
[35:15] because it's a water of separation that
[35:17] has separated us out to be a peculiar
[35:19] people unto him and he's washing us by
[35:22] the water of the word so that he can
[35:24] have a church without wrinkle and
[35:26] without blemish
[35:28] that's god is creating for himself
[35:32] a church without wrinkle and without
[35:34] blemish
[35:36] how's he doing it by the revelation of
[35:38] his word
[35:40] and so how am i becoming the the bride
[35:42] that he wants by surrendering to the
[35:44] word and obeying by dropping my ideas by
[35:47] surrendering my will by giving up my
[35:50] whatever i have that's contrary to word
[35:52] if i'll give that up and take that word
[35:55] for my clothing to be my headship to be
[35:57] my lord to be my bridegroom and let him
[36:00] be the boss
[36:03] then i know i'm in the water of
[36:05] separation
[36:07] and i believe that if we're in that
[36:09] water of separation it should be
[36:10] noticeable
[36:12] that we're separated from the world
[36:15] it should be noticeable that we're
[36:17] separated from the worldly church
[36:21] brotherhood was telling us
[36:24] that through this water of separation
[36:26] was the only basis for going into the
[36:28] holy place
[36:30] that we cannot go into the union with
[36:33] christ without passing through the word
[36:35] of separation
[36:38] so there's no
[36:39] there's no claiming
[36:41] that
[36:42] i've been behind the veil
[36:45] if you haven't even passed through the
[36:46] water of separation
[36:49] if we've refused to surrender to the
[36:51] revealed word of the hour we refuse to
[36:53] lay down our ideas and lay down our life
[36:55] but claim we've been behind the veil and
[36:57] become one with christ but it's obvious
[36:59] that we have not if we have refused the
[37:01] water of purification
[37:04] then the only basis for us going in to
[37:07] the holy of holies is to come first
[37:09] through the water of purification
[37:13] so this is important it's a step that
[37:16] ought not to be missed
[37:20] in the message the world is falling
[37:22] apart
[37:23] but the man says heavenly father this is
[37:25] your word
[37:26] and we read in the bible that we are
[37:28] cleansed by the water of the word
[37:30] and we know in the old testament how
[37:32] they took the heifer the red heifer and
[37:34] killed her the whole congregation and
[37:36] she was burnt and when the ashes was
[37:38] kept outside the courts for a water of
[37:40] separation that the hands that handled
[37:43] this must be clean and i pray god as the
[37:45] waters of separation the word that
[37:47] separates us from death to life cleanse
[37:50] our thoughts our hearts lord
[37:53] if there be anything you find in us
[37:54] that's not just right cleanse it lord by
[37:57] this water of separation tonight take
[37:59] our sins away father we want to stand
[38:01] daily before you
[38:04] dying to ourselves
[38:06] that we might live in christ
[38:09] amen
[38:10] so we know that the waters of separation
[38:12] are grounds for entering in
[38:15] it's the basis for entering in but it's
[38:18] also a daily standing before the lord
[38:20] and allowing the water of separation to
[38:22] be purification for our sins
[38:25] to allow the water of the word to wash
[38:27] us
[38:28] from unrighteousness
[38:31] back in the thinking man's filter again
[38:34] he says the thinking man
[38:36] the thinking man's filter is the waters
[38:39] the
[38:39] of the waters of separation
[38:42] it's the purification from sin which is
[38:44] the word of god and the thinking man the
[38:47] man that knows he's got to stand before
[38:49] god knows he's got to answer for every
[38:51] word of the bible it'll satisfy the
[38:53] taste that's in your heart
[38:56] when when i was listening to um
[38:59] this thinking man's filter what always
[39:01] stood out to me was brother banham
[39:02] getting his message off a pack of
[39:04] cigarettes
[39:05] and i couldn't get past that
[39:07] and go back and pick up a pack of
[39:09] cigarettes and take the slogan off a
[39:11] pack of cigarettes and god give him a
[39:12] message of the thinking man's filter and
[39:14] i knew he started to tie it to the word
[39:16] amen but i somehow had missed his very
[39:19] opening scripture amen to tie it all the
[39:21] way back to the waters of separation for
[39:23] purification for sin and it is the basis
[39:27] for moving forward with god
[39:30] it's not just a good idea
[39:33] it's not one of those things it's a good
[39:34] idea to have a thinking man's filter i
[39:36] mean it'll be better if you have a
[39:38] filtration system
[39:40] that's not what this message was taught
[39:42] for it's a requirement amen it's the
[39:45] basis for moving forward the world has
[39:47] to be stripped off ungodliness has to be
[39:49] stripped off anything that's contrary to
[39:51] where it has to be stripped off to move
[39:52] forward with god to move forward into
[39:54] the tabernacle and go behind the veil
[39:56] we've got to pass through the filter of
[39:58] the word the waters of separation for
[40:00] purification from sin
[40:03] so it's not a good idea and then it's an
[40:06] absolute requirement
[40:09] so the message isn't a good idea
[40:11] the things that brother bam teaches
[40:13] those are not good concepts and good
[40:14] ideas
[40:16] they're absolute necessities for
[40:18] approaching god
[40:19] [Music]
[40:22] he says now further in thinking man's
[40:25] filter
[40:26] but a real thinking man that knows his
[40:28] soul is going to judgment will filter
[40:30] his taste through the word of god
[40:32] for all the father has given me will
[40:34] come to me and he'll live by every word
[40:36] that proceeds out of the mouth of god
[40:38] which is the waters of separation that
[40:40] separates us from sin
[40:43] for when it comes through the word we
[40:45] see that it's sin to disbelieve it
[40:47] so we just believe it and go on it's a
[40:50] separation from sin
[40:53] what is the definition of sin that the
[40:55] prophet gave us
[40:56] sin is unbelief unbelief in what
[40:58] unbelief in god's word so god sent us a
[41:02] word to wash unbelief away
[41:05] so many times we disbelieved because we
[41:07] were mistaught
[41:10] so god brought back the word to be a
[41:12] purification for all the mistaking and
[41:15] misunderstanding and wrong ideas that
[41:18] created unbelief inside of us to god is
[41:20] washing away our unbelief by bringing
[41:22] back the word and it's a purification
[41:24] from sin
[41:26] we are purified from the sin of
[41:27] trinitarian baptism
[41:30] we've been purified how do i get
[41:31] purified by receiving water baptism in
[41:34] the name of the lord jesus christ
[41:37] what does that do it purifies me from
[41:39] the sin of unbelief that's left over
[41:42] from denominationalism
[41:44] god has god god has given us a
[41:46] purification we just have to believe it
[41:49] receive it accept it and let it work the
[41:52] work that it's intended to work
[41:54] because the ashes of the red heifer
[41:57] were the
[41:59] waters of separation
[42:01] for purification from sin
[42:05] that means
[42:07] that when the ashes of the red heifer
[42:09] were sprinkled upon
[42:12] the the individual or the vessel was
[42:14] unclean whatever it was sprinkled upon
[42:17] the ashes of the red heifer what made it
[42:19] clean
[42:21] it was cleansed or it was purified by
[42:24] the sprinkling
[42:26] and so
[42:27] we've received a word and if we'll just
[42:30] let that word sprinkle our heart
[42:33] the word is doing the purifying
[42:38] you know i talked about the the purging
[42:40] of of a purification of separation of a
[42:43] filter that separates
[42:45] and if we if we look at this incorrectly
[42:47] we can get the wrong idea we can take a
[42:50] concept of more works
[42:53] that's easy to do
[42:54] especially when you preach a message
[42:56] like this it's not that we have no works
[42:58] because we we have to obey
[43:00] is that right believers obey the word
[43:02] it's a requirement
[43:05] it's not optional it's a requirement in
[43:06] the scriptures that we obey the word
[43:08] but we can look at this as a as a means
[43:11] of greater works and if i do more works
[43:13] and i do more obedient then i become
[43:15] more pure no it's not our effort that
[43:17] creates purity it's the sprinkling of
[43:20] the word amen it's the word that has
[43:22] come back to make us pure
[43:24] and if we'll just stay under the washing
[43:27] of the word it'll wash all of that out
[43:29] it'll change our thinking it'll change
[43:31] our desires it'll change everything and
[43:34] it'll it'll purge us from unbelief and
[43:37] purge us from sin and if the word will
[43:40] do the purging amen it'll bring us into
[43:43] the right kind of life
[43:45] so we can get discouraged amen under
[43:48] this kind of preaching that oh i know i
[43:50] got to do better if you know that you're
[43:52] doing wrong then repent
[43:55] and if you know that you can quit doing
[43:57] this and quit doing it
[43:59] that's your reasonable service
[44:03] but there's so many things that we just
[44:06] are trapped in they meant so many things
[44:08] that we just keep repeating traps we
[44:10] keep repeatedly stepping in and what do
[44:12] i need i need something that will purify
[44:14] all of me i need something that will
[44:16] change my thinking change my habits
[44:18] change the genetics that are in my body
[44:21] and what will change it there is a water
[44:23] of purification that has come this word
[44:25] has come because this word isn't sterile
[44:28] amen it didn't come from a textbook amen
[44:30] this is not print on paper this is the
[44:33] word amen containing the thought so this
[44:36] word brings a life
[44:40] see when when they took the blood of the
[44:43] red heifer and they sprinkled it that
[44:45] was blood sprinkled amen the shedding of
[44:47] blood blood was sprinkled representing
[44:50] the seven church ages representing
[44:51] calvary amen but all that rest of that
[44:55] blood
[44:56] was in the ashes
[45:00] where was the rest of the blood
[45:03] the rest of the blood was in the ashes
[45:06] so when they would take a portion of the
[45:08] ashes and they would mix it with living
[45:11] water living water for their day fresh
[45:13] living water when they would mix it
[45:15] together in there is calvary and there
[45:18] is the word and there is the blood
[45:22] it's all in there
[45:24] it's got the blood which represented the
[45:26] life it's got the full word without
[45:28] blemish without spot it's got the cedar
[45:31] wood representing calvary it's got the
[45:33] rams wool dyed scarlet it's got the
[45:35] hyssop for the application it's all in
[45:37] the ashes so they had a sacrifice for
[45:40] that day to represent seven church ages
[45:43] but they had something that will
[45:44] preserve them through the rest of the
[45:46] journey and it was that ashes of the red
[45:48] heifer that they could get any time that
[45:50] they needed it to mix it with living
[45:52] water and sprinkle it for purification
[45:55] and in that was calvary and that was the
[45:58] blood in that was the word the sacrifice
[46:01] in that was the virgin in that was what
[46:02] was not manhandled
[46:04] it was all in the ashes
[46:07] and god has kept back his word and
[46:10] preserved his word and through seven
[46:12] church ages he'll get a fresh portion of
[46:13] that word and mix it with the living
[46:15] water for that day and sprinkle it upon
[46:18] the people and they'll be clean in that
[46:20] day
[46:21] why were the lutherans clean by
[46:23] accepting the word for their day
[46:27] luther smoked and drank and swore
[46:31] but he was purified
[46:33] what was he purified by what was he
[46:35] cleansed by by the just shall save by
[46:37] faith
[46:39] what was it it was a portion amen of
[46:42] that great sacrifice that was preserved
[46:44] for his day mixed with living water and
[46:46] sprinkled as the word of purification
[46:49] the waters of separation upon that
[46:51] generation and those who could receive
[46:53] that word were justified amen we're
[46:56] considered righteous by receiving that
[46:58] word
[46:59] righteousness was imputed unto them
[47:03] because they believed god
[47:07] oh
[47:08] this is no longer just a funny little
[47:10] part of the book of numbers
[47:12] under the message of the hour it's
[47:14] become living worry
[47:18] so the blood wasn't lost
[47:20] how did they get an application of that
[47:22] blood
[47:23] by going to the ashes of the red heifer
[47:24] and mixing it with the water
[47:28] and when they was applied
[47:30] everything was in that
[47:32] and it was a waters of purification
[47:35] for sin
[47:38] he said
[47:46] and again in thinking man's filter
[47:48] we thank you for the little cut up
[47:50] message tonight lord
[47:52] i didn't do it right but i pray lord
[47:54] that you'll make it right in the
[47:55] people's sight that they might see and
[47:57] know that it was meant for
[47:59] get glory out of it lord and may we have
[48:01] this understanding of nothing else
[48:04] that we are to live by the bread of the
[48:06] word of god filtered from god just for
[48:08] his children only it's separated it's a
[48:11] separated congregation
[48:13] it's for no one else it's only for those
[48:16] you're chosen as the red heifers waters
[48:18] of separation was for the congregation
[48:20] of israel only
[48:23] these this word
[48:25] this word that is going to be the
[48:27] sprinkling of purification in each age
[48:29] this word is only for the elect of that
[48:33] luther's message was only for the
[48:35] elected that day wesley's message was
[48:36] only for the elected that day
[48:40] and it's the waters of separation
[48:44] in the message the invisible union of
[48:46] the bride of christ the prophet says
[48:47] what is sin
[48:49] sin is unbelief unbelief in what the
[48:51] word unbelief in god which is the word
[48:55] pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving
[48:58] soon for the skies amen standing ready
[49:01] think your garments washed by the water
[49:04] of the bleeding word
[49:07] the word become blood
[49:11] how did the word become blood because
[49:13] you go back to john 1 1. in the
[49:15] beginning was the word and the word was
[49:17] with god and the word was god and then
[49:19] john 1 14 then the word was made flesh
[49:22] and dwelt among us when that word was
[49:24] made flesh amen there was created blood
[49:26] put into that word
[49:28] that fleshed out word amen and that word
[49:31] became our sacrifice and died for us and
[49:34] bled forth so the word bled for us the
[49:36] word died for us
[49:39] so we were washed in the bleeding word
[49:42] and that word amen dropped seven stripes
[49:45] for seven church ages amen but the word
[49:48] was preserved amen and in each age a
[49:51] portion of that word was mixed with the
[49:53] living water for that day and when it
[49:55] was mixed together amen that word amen
[49:58] that word that bled for us that blood
[50:00] was fresh and the fresh outpouring of
[50:03] the word
[50:04] when the word poured out fresh it still
[50:07] contained the blood
[50:10] just like when the ashes of the red
[50:12] heifer were taken
[50:14] for purification of sin it was taken at
[50:17] a later date but then when it was mixed
[50:18] with living water amen and sprinkled
[50:20] over the people it became a purification
[50:23] of sin the sacrifice was still in it the
[50:25] blood was still in it everything was
[50:27] still in it
[50:29] and when god portioned out his word
[50:31] everything was still in it
[50:35] the blood was still there
[50:38] praise be to god
[50:43] so thinking man's filter is really about
[50:46] the ashes of the red heifer
[50:49] and being washed by the water of the
[50:50] word
[50:52] i want to go and finish this quote in
[50:54] invisible union
[50:56] your garments washed by the water of the
[50:58] bleeding word
[51:00] the word become blood
[51:02] the word bled for you and you're washed
[51:05] in bleeding word
[51:07] the word bleeding the life of god in the
[51:10] word
[51:11] and the word was bled for you
[51:14] that you might be washed from the filth
[51:16] of these prostitutes and be cleaned and
[51:18] sanctified by the washing of the water
[51:20] of the word and makes your mind and
[51:22] heart stayed on god and on his word
[51:26] this is how ephesians 5 works
[51:29] because he's washing us with the water
[51:31] of the word the waters of separation but
[51:33] what's in the word when all the word was
[51:36] in christ that word bled
[51:39] that word was bleeding when it was all
[51:41] in christ so now when that word that
[51:44] bled amen comes back amen in that day
[51:47] that you live in that word contains the
[51:50] blood from calvary in it and when you
[51:52] receive it it's waters of purification
[51:55] for you
[52:00] now
[52:02] it goes on in the message and things
[52:04] that are to be
[52:07] he said oh but the other one is called
[52:09] my father's house
[52:11] i'll go and prepare a place for you take
[52:13] you out of this pest house and deliver
[52:15] you into my
[52:17] i'm sorry let me read that again take
[52:18] you out of this pest house and deliver
[52:19] you into my father's house amen there
[52:21] you are take you out of this old earthly
[52:23] pest house he's gone to prepare a place
[52:25] a perfect place where no evil exists so
[52:28] no sickness exists no old age exists no
[52:31] death exists
[52:33] say take me there lord
[52:36] now listen what he says
[52:37] it's a perfect place
[52:39] calling you to that perfection
[52:42] and you have to be perfect to get there
[52:46] oh
[52:49] you can take you can take two approaches
[52:51] to this
[52:52] you can look in the mirror and say well
[52:54] it was a good idea
[52:57] it was a good concept i really wanted it
[53:00] but when he said you have to be perfect
[53:01] to get there
[53:03] that put me on the sidelines
[53:06] but god cannot make a requirement for
[53:08] you that he doesn't keep himself
[53:12] because when god made a requirement for
[53:14] the shedding of blood he came himself to
[53:16] be the shedding of blood when god makes
[53:18] a requirement when it comes to his bride
[53:20] he'll fulfill the requirement for her
[53:23] so there is a requirement that you have
[53:25] to be perfect to get there but it's
[53:27] going to take the perfect one to come
[53:29] and make you perfect
[53:32] we were trapped into this life it was of
[53:34] no fault of our own it was without even
[53:37] our desire we were stuck into this
[53:39] hybrid condition from the garden of eden
[53:41] and god knows that we were stuck and
[53:43] trapped into this condition amen because
[53:46] we never sinned in the first place
[53:47] whatever i was first place i wasn't a
[53:49] sinner
[53:51] whenever i was in the first place i
[53:53] wasn't hybrid amen i wasn't corrupted i
[53:55] wasn't perverted whatever i was in the
[53:57] first place i believed every word of god
[54:00] and stood upon it in the first place
[54:03] so i never sinned in the first place and
[54:05] god's going to take me back to the first
[54:07] place condition
[54:09] but because i was trapped in this i have
[54:11] no hope of getting there myself
[54:13] no way whatsoever of getting there on my
[54:15] own
[54:16] but it's going to take perfection to get
[54:18] there
[54:20] he says
[54:23] he says you you and you have to be
[54:25] perfect to get there and the bible said
[54:28] so jesus said be there for perfect even
[54:30] as your father in heaven is perfect it's
[54:32] a perfect kingdom so it must be a
[54:34] perfect people
[54:36] oh praise god what a requirement
[54:39] god has so set his system up with
[54:42] requirements and all of these things
[54:44] that only his elect will ever make it
[54:49] it must be a perfect people come because
[54:51] you have to stand to be married to a
[54:52] perfect son of god now that makes
[54:54] perfect sense
[54:56] if you're going to be married to a
[54:57] perfect son of god you must be a perfect
[54:58] bride
[54:59] if you're going to a perfect place you
[55:01] must be perfect to get there everything
[55:03] must be perfect but i was born in
[55:05] perfect i still have this old cockapoo
[55:07] nature on the outside that's sticky what
[55:09] is going to happen to me how is this
[55:11] going to happen praise god there's a
[55:13] water of separation
[55:16] there's a water for purification to make
[55:19] you in this condition perfect to go
[55:21] there
[55:24] he says now
[55:28] now you
[55:29] you because you have to stand and be
[55:31] married to a perfect son of god and you
[55:33] must be a perfect bride so how can you
[55:36] do it through anything else but the
[55:37] perfect word of god
[55:39] which is the waters of separation that
[55:42] washes us from our sins
[55:44] now it is not good conduct
[55:49] that brings us to perfection
[55:51] it's the washing of the water by the
[55:53] word that brings us to perfection
[55:55] so in order for god to have a perfect
[55:57] bride to unite within the end time he
[55:59] had to restore a perfect word the
[56:01] perfect word will produce the perfect
[56:03] bride because there'll be a people on
[56:04] the earth that'll say that's exactly
[56:06] what i want god i surrender i die i take
[56:09] that as my headship take me under your
[56:11] control
[56:13] and the washing of the water of the word
[56:15] amen brings you into that perfect
[56:18] condition amen so that you can be united
[56:20] with this perfect son of god
[56:23] so god in our day has provided the
[56:26] waters of separation
[56:30] is not the day of portion
[56:33] part
[56:34] portion but this is the full word
[56:37] and with the full word comes the full
[56:39] life
[56:41] you cannot separate the word and the
[56:44] life
[56:45] now
[56:46] i'm talking about the true word
[56:48] you cannot separate the true word from
[56:50] the true life
[56:52] you can have words like repeating words
[56:54] and understanding words and reading
[56:55] words
[56:56] but that's not the person of the word
[57:00] the word comes with the life the person
[57:02] of the word
[57:04] so now i want to i'll keep reading here
[57:06] and things that are to be
[57:09] he said so now how can you do it through
[57:12] anything else but the perfect word of
[57:13] god which is the waters of separation
[57:14] that washes us from our sins amen that's
[57:17] right the blood of jesus christ think of
[57:20] it the dripping bloody word
[57:23] amen the blood
[57:25] the word of god bleeding blood to wash
[57:28] the bride in
[57:29] amen yes sir she stands perfect
[57:32] virgin
[57:33] unadulterated she never sinned in the
[57:36] first place she was trapped into it
[57:40] praise god i'm just going to accept that
[57:42] as true amen i'm just going to say
[57:45] that's me he's talking about i'm not
[57:47] going to look in the mirror because i
[57:48] look in the mirror i get confused i'm
[57:50] looking into the mirror of the word and
[57:52] saying that's me that is exactly who i
[57:55] am and because that's me trapped in this
[57:57] condition he did something in this day
[58:00] that i could not do for myself that
[58:02] nobody else could do he came amen and
[58:05] brought back the waters of separation
[58:08] that has the blood of purification in it
[58:11] and we're purified by the bleeding word
[58:13] the word that bled for us has come back
[58:16] to us and with the purifying power of
[58:18] the blood which represents the life it's
[58:21] the life that's purifying us
[58:27] in the feast of trumpets
[58:29] brother ben says in revelations 11
[58:33] calder ministry
[58:35] will be the ministry of moses and elias
[58:37] calling israel out of the jewish
[58:38] traditions
[58:40] just as the seventh angels message
[58:42] called the bride out of the pentecostal
[58:44] tradition
[58:45] so he's going to run a parallel between
[58:47] the message of moses and elijah and the
[58:49] message of the seventh angel
[58:51] and we all know who the seventh angel is
[58:55] so he's running this parallel he said
[58:57] they're to call uh the the 144 000 out
[59:01] of the jewish tradition just like the
[59:02] seventh angel called us out of the
[59:04] pentecostal tradition
[59:07] remember moses elijah is to call israel
[59:10] out of the old atonement of the lamb and
[59:12] sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice
[59:15] to the real living sacrifice the word
[59:19] what is the sacrifice the sacrifice is
[59:22] what frees you from sin the sacrifice is
[59:24] what purchase your redemption the
[59:25] sacrifice is what shed blood for you
[59:28] he's going to bring them from the old
[59:29] order to the real living sacrifice to
[59:31] the word
[59:33] he said well i thought he would bring
[59:34] him to christ it's the same thing amen
[59:39] well he says he's going to bring him to
[59:41] the real living sacrifice i expected him
[59:43] to say jesus christ but then he said the
[59:45] word
[59:46] what's the difference
[59:49] there is no difference
[59:50] if you bring them to the word you
[59:52] brought them to christ
[59:53] you bring them to christ you bring them
[59:54] to the word
[59:56] there's no difference
[1:00:00] that's why uh years ago i said i reject
[1:00:02] that old notion that first you bring him
[1:00:04] to christ then you bring him to the
[1:00:05] message
[1:00:06] i heard that said several times and i
[1:00:08] said if you can bring somebody to christ
[1:00:10] without the message then why do you need
[1:00:11] the message discard the message the
[1:00:13] whole goal is to get to christ
[1:00:15] so how can you bring somebody to christ
[1:00:17] before you bring him to the message
[1:00:18] you've separated the message of christ
[1:00:20] but the messenger said this message is
[1:00:22] christ
[1:00:23] christ is the word amen from genesis
[1:00:25] through revelation it's all christ
[1:00:29] so how can you bring somebody to christ
[1:00:30] and then bring them to the message
[1:00:33] that concept makes the message
[1:00:35] unnecessary
[1:00:39] unless you believe you can go higher
[1:00:40] than christ
[1:00:44] but if you come to christ how can you go
[1:00:46] higher that's the goal
[1:00:50] so
[1:00:51] so he they're going to bring them to the
[1:00:53] real living sacrifice the word
[1:00:58] and then he goes on and says and the
[1:00:59] seventh angel's message
[1:01:01] under the same trumpet same everything
[1:01:03] exactly the same seal is to what
[1:01:06] call the people the bride out of the
[1:01:09] pentecostal and world tradition
[1:01:11] to the genuine atonement
[1:01:15] what's an atonement the covering for
[1:01:17] your sins
[1:01:19] the genuine covering for your sins he's
[1:01:21] going to bring them out of the
[1:01:22] pentecostal world tradition to the
[1:01:25] genuine atonement the word
[1:01:28] what is the word
[1:01:30] the atonement
[1:01:31] what is the word in this day the genuine
[1:01:33] atonement that covers my sin when i
[1:01:36] receive the word i am receiving the
[1:01:38] blood i am receiving the life i am
[1:01:40] receiving christ amen it is a living
[1:01:43] sacrifice it is a bleeding word it has
[1:01:45] the power to wash me from my sins
[1:01:48] because what is sin unbelief what is the
[1:01:50] word doing bringing us back into faith
[1:01:52] in god
[1:01:53] [Music]
[1:01:56] amen to the genuine atonement the word
[1:01:59] christ impersonated in his word here
[1:02:02] made flesh among
[1:02:04] us praise be to god
[1:02:08] christ in christ where
[1:02:10] here
[1:02:12] in his word
[1:02:14] in person among us
[1:02:16] made flesh among us
[1:02:19] he says
[1:02:21] now in questions and answers he's going
[1:02:22] to start dealing with the foolish virgin
[1:02:26] and he says this is interesting what he
[1:02:27] says it all fits into the same picture
[1:02:30] see the gentile bride is in heaven and
[1:02:31] the sleeping virgin the gentile virgin
[1:02:33] is not to be saved during that time
[1:02:35] she's already been saved but has been
[1:02:37] rejected in the bride
[1:02:39] and she only goes through the
[1:02:40] tribulation period for a time of
[1:02:42] purification
[1:02:43] what is the waters of separation
[1:02:45] purification from sin
[1:02:47] so she must go through the time of
[1:02:48] tribulation brother ben said elsewhere
[1:02:51] to shed her own blood for rejecting the
[1:02:53] blood
[1:02:54] she has to give her own life she has to
[1:02:56] be purified by shedding her own blood
[1:02:58] but this is what he says here she goes
[1:03:00] through they only goes through the
[1:03:02] tribulation period for a time of
[1:03:03] purification
[1:03:05] because she was she has rejected christ
[1:03:08] the word for her purification
[1:03:11] so the the foolish virgin in the end
[1:03:13] time has rejected christ the word for
[1:03:16] purification that means the word is the
[1:03:19] waters of separation is the purification
[1:03:22] from sin this end time message amen has
[1:03:25] brought back the word in its fullness
[1:03:27] which is the purification of sin
[1:03:31] because sin is unbelief
[1:03:36] so
[1:03:37] now
[1:03:38] this foolish virgin rejected that so she
[1:03:41] must go through the tribulation period
[1:03:43] to shed her own blood
[1:03:45] to be for her purification well praise
[1:03:49] god i don't have to shed my own blood
[1:03:51] for purification i praise god i don't
[1:03:54] have to enter into a works program for
[1:03:56] purification praise god all i have to do
[1:03:59] is surrender to this word that's been
[1:04:01] given to us and let the word wash me
[1:04:05] from the sin of unbelief
[1:04:08] to bring back the mind of christ amen so
[1:04:10] that i lose my mind my thinking and take
[1:04:12] on the mind of christ and that it
[1:04:14] changes everything about me and brings
[1:04:17] me into an alignment with the word not
[1:04:19] by willpower but by surrender
[1:04:25] so every time i preach this i feel like
[1:04:26] i i gotta balance everything but you
[1:04:28] understand what i'm saying if you if you
[1:04:31] know to do good and don't do it it's sin
[1:04:34] we're not gonna leave the word if you
[1:04:36] know to do good and don't do it you're
[1:04:37] not gonna say well i'm waiting for the
[1:04:38] word to change me
[1:04:41] sometimes you just got to make a
[1:04:42] decision and you just got to deny
[1:04:44] yourself and just do what the word says
[1:04:48] so none of that lazy christian goofy
[1:04:51] excuses stuff so you can continue in sin
[1:04:53] and act like you're righteous
[1:04:55] the word takes care of all of that
[1:04:57] there's a scripture for all of that if
[1:04:59] you know to do good and don't do it and
[1:05:01] do it not it is sin
[1:05:04] but there's those things amen that we
[1:05:06] don't even know about ourselves there's
[1:05:07] those things that we're learning all the
[1:05:09] time in the word amen and i have to be
[1:05:12] washed from me
[1:05:14] i have to be washed amen from the
[1:05:16] condition of my first birth amen i have
[1:05:19] to come to a new birth i need the
[1:05:20] washing of the water of the word to
[1:05:22] separate me amen from everything that's
[1:05:25] unlike him and i want to lay under that
[1:05:27] word for my purification to make me a
[1:05:30] perfect bride because i've received a
[1:05:33] perfect word that has done a perfect
[1:05:35] redemption and made my soul perfect
[1:05:37] before god
[1:05:40] you may still look at brother chad and
[1:05:41] has a sticky cockapoo outside and you
[1:05:43] may see little things stick to it from
[1:05:45] once in a while but i'm not looking that
[1:05:47] anymore i'm looking down at the real me
[1:05:49] on the inside that's been born again by
[1:05:51] receiving this word and receiving the
[1:05:53] life of the word and inside amen there
[1:05:56] is a perfect man
[1:05:58] [Applause]
[1:06:00] hallelujah
[1:06:01] you say it's pretty deep in there
[1:06:03] brother tell ya it's pretty deep some
[1:06:04] days
[1:06:05] some days it's a little deeper than
[1:06:07] others amen i'm afraid
[1:06:09] but it's there i rest assured it's there
[1:06:11] and what has brought the purification of
[1:06:13] the soul amen has been purified by the
[1:06:16] receiving the word for this day brought
[1:06:18] the life of christ and a new birth to
[1:06:20] quicken the seed on the inside and
[1:06:22] brought a perfect new birth amen to
[1:06:24] correct the first birth
[1:06:28] god will take care of this old conqueror
[1:06:29] nature it's going to be
[1:06:31] it's going to be changed
[1:06:33] but there's something on the inside that
[1:06:35] is coming to perfection
[1:06:38] to a
[1:06:39] faith
[1:06:40] a perfect faith
[1:06:42] and a perfect word that's been restored
[1:06:43] to us
[1:06:44] to believe it to accept it to surrender
[1:06:47] to it
[1:06:51] i say even to the parts that you keep
[1:06:53] tripping over
[1:06:55] you still say it's nothing but the truth
[1:06:57] i believe even though i failed it
[1:06:59] yesterday and if i fail it again today
[1:07:02] that's me has nothing to do with the
[1:07:03] word it's still perfect and i still
[1:07:05] receive it and i still love it and i
[1:07:07] still want it more than anything else
[1:07:10] it's a perfect word and that word will
[1:07:13] bring us to perfection
[1:07:15] if we stay under the washing of the
[1:07:17] water but if brother bam said but if you
[1:07:19] won't stay under the word how are you
[1:07:20] going to be washed
[1:07:28] so we know that the bride doesn't go
[1:07:30] through tribulation because she's been
[1:07:31] purified
[1:07:33] by receiving the word
[1:07:35] by receiving christ
[1:07:37] now i want to look at a couple
[1:07:39] scriptures that are really familiar
[1:07:40] let's turn to first john 1. we went
[1:07:43] through this sunday but i want to look
[1:07:44] at this again
[1:07:47] real quick
[1:07:53] first john
[1:07:55] one
[1:07:56] and seven
[1:07:57] we probably could all just recite it
[1:07:59] once i say first john 1 7 but i'd like
[1:08:01] to read it for a minute
[1:08:07] if we walk in the light
[1:08:09] as he is in the light
[1:08:11] we have fellowship one with another and
[1:08:14] the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:08:15] cleanses us from all sin
[1:08:18] now we know that the light is
[1:08:19] illumination or revelation
[1:08:22] and in and the word produces light we'll
[1:08:24] get into that in a minute but if we walk
[1:08:26] in the light as he is in the light so if
[1:08:28] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:08:31] light
[1:08:32] so wherever he is in the light we have
[1:08:35] to walk there
[1:08:38] not where the light was but where he is
[1:08:41] in the light
[1:08:43] then we have fellowship one with another
[1:08:45] and the blood of jesus christ cleanse us
[1:08:46] from all sin because it's the water of
[1:08:48] separation
[1:08:51] now in the message turn on the light he
[1:08:53] says no life can come outside of light
[1:08:56] light produces light produces life
[1:09:00] there can be no life out life outside of
[1:09:03] light natural or spiritual
[1:09:06] there must be
[1:09:08] and only light can come by the word of
[1:09:10] god
[1:09:12] god's word is the light when it's
[1:09:14] manifested
[1:09:16] let's take this principle and look at it
[1:09:18] for a minute
[1:09:19] no life can come outside of light both
[1:09:22] natural and spiritual and light only
[1:09:24] comes by the word of god
[1:09:26] so in the beginning when we go back to
[1:09:28] genesis 1 2 we find the earth shrouded
[1:09:31] in darkness so no life can come upon the
[1:09:33] earth because it's shrouded in darkness
[1:09:35] so the first thing he does is give a
[1:09:37] word that'll produce light and the very
[1:09:40] first thing he does is say let there be
[1:09:42] light
[1:09:45] now listen
[1:09:46] god does everything so perfect in this
[1:09:49] word
[1:09:51] that the very first thing his spoken
[1:09:54] word brings is light and the very first
[1:09:56] purpose of the spoken word is light and
[1:09:59] without light there is no life so the
[1:10:02] first thing he does is bring the light
[1:10:04] that will produce the life
[1:10:07] and that light is an illumination both
[1:10:10] natural and spiritual it is a revelation
[1:10:13] it is the light bulb going off it is an
[1:10:15] understanding it is a seeing
[1:10:18] so the very first thing he does a meant
[1:10:21] to bring life back upon the earth amen
[1:10:24] is he speaks a word and then there's
[1:10:26] light and then the light he begins to
[1:10:29] position the light and separate the
[1:10:31] waters and so that that light can now
[1:10:33] get to that seed so the first thing he
[1:10:35] does is give light amen so the first
[1:10:38] thing he does is give his word
[1:10:42] but then he begins to position
[1:10:44] everything
[1:10:45] so that the light can get to the seed
[1:10:48] and when the light gets to the seed it
[1:10:51] quickens the life inside the seed and
[1:10:53] the seed comes to life
[1:10:54] because the creation story is our
[1:10:57] redemption story and our salvation story
[1:11:00] but first there had to be light so god
[1:11:03] first gave his word and after he gave
[1:11:05] his word then through the bible he
[1:11:07] begins to position everything so that he
[1:11:09] can get everything in position so that
[1:11:11] the light can strike the seed and when
[1:11:12] the light strikes the seed there's
[1:11:14] already power of transformation in the
[1:11:17] seed because it's also part of the word
[1:11:19] and part of the life
[1:11:22] but that life cannot be quickened
[1:11:24] without the light so now light
[1:11:26] represents illumination of revelation
[1:11:29] from the spoken word of god said let
[1:11:31] there be light then the light manifests
[1:11:33] so when the spoken word come to
[1:11:34] manifestation it was the light that
[1:11:36] would bring the life
[1:11:38] so nothing's changed if you want the
[1:11:41] seed inside somebody to come to life
[1:11:43] then they must receive the light amen
[1:11:46] the light amen you can have all kinds of
[1:11:48] good works programs you can invite
[1:11:49] somebody to church every day but there's
[1:11:51] nothing going to bring up that life
[1:11:53] without the light of revelation of the
[1:11:55] word of god
[1:11:57] and so when god won a fully mature fully
[1:12:00] manifested bride upon this earth he had
[1:12:02] to bring the light in full power amen
[1:12:05] not diminished whatsoever he had to
[1:12:08] position through seven churches get
[1:12:09] everything moved out of the way
[1:12:10] everything in position everything pushed
[1:12:13] aside so he could get the full light of
[1:12:15] seven church ages to shine upon the seed
[1:12:17] in this day to bring it to full life
[1:12:21] and outside of that we're not coming to
[1:12:24] life
[1:12:26] so we have church systems we won't do
[1:12:28] anything
[1:12:30] we can have great big programs won't do
[1:12:32] anything we can have great moves of
[1:12:34] emotion it won't do anything
[1:12:37] but it is the light of the manifested
[1:12:40] word of god that will bring the light to
[1:12:43] the sea
[1:12:45] so if we want somebody to be born again
[1:12:48] they must receive the light of the hour
[1:12:50] the message this is the message that
[1:12:52] brings new life in this day
[1:12:55] praise god
[1:12:56] so there should be no confusion about
[1:12:58] that
[1:13:00] it's the light
[1:13:03] so let's
[1:13:05] go over to john the gospel of john
[1:13:07] chapter 1. i just recited this but i'd
[1:13:09] like to read it together
[1:13:11] i said we're going to hit these two very
[1:13:13] familiar passages of scripture
[1:13:15] that we went through last time but i
[1:13:17] want to look at them again
[1:13:24] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:13:26] word was with god and the word was god
[1:13:28] and the same was in the beginning with
[1:13:30] god
[1:13:30] all things were made by him and without
[1:13:32] him was not anything made that was made
[1:13:35] in him was life and the life was the
[1:13:37] light of men
[1:13:40] in him
[1:13:42] the word
[1:13:45] was life
[1:13:46] and that life was the illumination
[1:13:50] it was the light
[1:13:52] that brings us to life
[1:13:54] in the message there is a man here that
[1:13:56] can turn on the light the prophet of god
[1:13:57] simply says christ is the light
[1:14:00] and the light is the life
[1:14:02] and the word manifested is the light of
[1:14:04] the hour
[1:14:06] i don't know about you but i'm simple
[1:14:08] enough to understand that
[1:14:10] christ is the light
[1:14:12] and the light
[1:14:13] and the light is the life
[1:14:15] so do we want the life
[1:14:17] then you have to have the light
[1:14:19] then he says and the word manifested
[1:14:22] is the light of the hour
[1:14:26] what does that do it brings life
[1:14:32] in the message possessing the gate of
[1:14:33] the enemy after the trial
[1:14:35] so now but when jesus the son of god
[1:14:38] virgin born shed his blood
[1:14:40] the life that was in the blood was god
[1:14:42] itself
[1:14:44] god created that blood
[1:14:46] the life that was in the blood was god
[1:14:48] itself the bible said we are saved by
[1:14:50] the life the blood of god not the blood
[1:14:52] of a jew not the blood of a gentile but
[1:14:54] the life of god god created this blood
[1:14:57] cell virgin born
[1:14:59] so
[1:15:00] when when we received the blood the
[1:15:02] brother bam said the blood is it
[1:15:04] symbolizes the life the life is in the
[1:15:06] blood going all the way back to
[1:15:07] leviticus leviticus and when that blood
[1:15:09] cell was broke brother bram said it
[1:15:11] released god
[1:15:13] to come back
[1:15:14] so
[1:15:15] when you receive the blood of jesus
[1:15:17] christ it's the life of the blood that
[1:15:20] we receive
[1:15:22] so
[1:15:22] what is light
[1:15:24] life
[1:15:25] what is blood
[1:15:27] life
[1:15:28] what is the word life
[1:15:31] i mean
[1:15:33] what is the baptism the holy ghost life
[1:15:35] it's all bringing life amen it all
[1:15:38] speaks to the same thing
[1:15:43] let's go to
[1:15:45] matthew let's go over here to matthew
[1:15:47] chapter 4.
[1:15:48] i just want to read a couple more
[1:15:49] scriptures
[1:15:52] matthew chapter four
[1:16:03] matthew chapter four verse 3.
[1:16:09] it says and when the tempter came to him
[1:16:13] he said if thou be the son of god
[1:16:15] command these stones to be made bread
[1:16:17] but he answered and said it is written
[1:16:18] man shall not live by bread alone
[1:16:21] but by every word
[1:16:23] that proceeded out of the mouth of god
[1:16:26] how do you live
[1:16:27] by the word
[1:16:30] how do you live by light
[1:16:32] how do you live by the word how do you
[1:16:35] live by the blood
[1:16:37] what's different with these three things
[1:16:39] nothing
[1:16:41] it all goes together
[1:16:44] the prophet of god said in the message
[1:16:45] hear ye him
[1:16:47] you stay right on the word
[1:16:49] and that word is life
[1:16:52] and every time you receive the word
[1:16:55] you receive life
[1:16:58] every time you receive the word you
[1:16:59] receive light every time you receive the
[1:17:01] word you receive life every time you
[1:17:03] receive the word you receive the blood
[1:17:05] of purification the waters of separation
[1:17:08] it all is the same thing the word in
[1:17:10] this day has come to purify a bride it
[1:17:13] has come to be waters of separation to
[1:17:16] separate us from the world it has come
[1:17:17] to cleanse us from the sin of unbelief
[1:17:19] it has come to bring us into perfection
[1:17:21] it has come to bring the light that
[1:17:23] brings the life it has come to grow us
[1:17:25] into full maturity this word does it all
[1:17:30] so we must receive the word
[1:17:32] that's why man does not live by bread
[1:17:35] alone but by every word
[1:17:38] what have we received the full word
[1:17:40] by every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:17:42] mouth of god that's what brings life
[1:17:44] that's what we live by amen this natural
[1:17:47] life that we have is only a reflection
[1:17:49] of a real life it's not even the real
[1:17:51] life but the real life comes by the word
[1:17:53] of god
[1:17:54] and so
[1:17:56] so
[1:17:56] that's why when we realize what the
[1:17:59] water of separation is what the bleeding
[1:18:02] word does what the uh pure what the
[1:18:04] genuine atonement is what the light in
[1:18:07] life is when we put all of this picture
[1:18:10] together amen that shouldn't make us
[1:18:12] embrace our bibles and our message books
[1:18:14] like never before friend amen this isn't
[1:18:17] this isn't a part-time thing this is our
[1:18:19] whole life amen the word that's been
[1:18:21] given to us was to bring a perfection in
[1:18:23] this day
[1:18:24] i mean that's why we should we should be
[1:18:26] devouring the tapes devouring the books
[1:18:29] devouring our bibles amen because it's
[1:18:31] the only thing we have to bring us to
[1:18:33] where we need to be good works won't do
[1:18:35] it better church attendance alone won't
[1:18:37] do it amen all of these things that that
[1:18:40] we try to do it'll come to none effect
[1:18:43] if we try all of that separated from the
[1:18:45] word
[1:18:47] all of our efforts will be in fame and
[1:18:49] all of our righteousness is filthy rags
[1:18:51] but god has brought something in this
[1:18:53] day like it's not been upon the earth
[1:18:55] before amen there's been a word that has
[1:18:57] been revealed and the revelation of the
[1:18:59] seven thunders the seals have been
[1:19:01] opened the full picture the full word
[1:19:03] has been given back to bring a
[1:19:05] purification to bring light to bring
[1:19:07] life to bring
[1:19:08] salvation to bring redemption to bring
[1:19:10] it all
[1:19:13] and this message should be more precious
[1:19:15] to us every day of our lives
[1:19:18] it becomes when you see things like this
[1:19:20] when i see things like this all i want
[1:19:22] to do is go sit in the corner and read a
[1:19:23] message book
[1:19:24] i just want to pick up my book i just
[1:19:26] want to read in my bible because i
[1:19:27] realize in this day this is my only hope
[1:19:30] it's the only thing i have i don't have
[1:19:32] anything else
[1:19:34] i can't do it i can't change myself i
[1:19:37] can't overcome on my own there's nothing
[1:19:39] else i can do amen but what i can do is
[1:19:41] receive the very thing that's been given
[1:19:44] to bring me to perfection
[1:19:46] to bring redemption to bring a cleansing
[1:19:48] to bring a washing to bring it all has
[1:19:51] come when he gave us back the word he
[1:19:53] gave us back everything we need to
[1:19:55] complete this journey to come to
[1:19:57] perfection
[1:19:59] it's all here
[1:20:01] and so now i don't want to neglect the
[1:20:03] very thing that's been given
[1:20:05] i say god this word is becoming more
[1:20:07] precious to me day by day let it always
[1:20:10] be that way
[1:20:12] may we always love this word
[1:20:15] and receive it as a water of washing
[1:20:22] let's go to john chapter six
[1:20:24] we'll finish with this scripture
[1:20:29] john chapter six
[1:20:33] verse 63
[1:20:35] john 6 and 63
[1:20:39] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[1:20:41] flesh prophet of nothing
[1:20:43] the words that i speak unto you they are
[1:20:45] spirit
[1:20:46] and they are life
[1:20:49] what are the words
[1:20:50] life
[1:20:52] what does the word bring
[1:20:53] light
[1:20:55] what is the word in this day it's the
[1:20:57] bleeding bloody word the word that bled
[1:20:59] for us
[1:21:01] there's a water of separation available
[1:21:03] to us
[1:21:04] there's a water of purification for sin
[1:21:06] that is here
[1:21:08] it is in our hands
[1:21:13] the the
[1:21:14] the light that brings life
[1:21:17] is in our hands
[1:21:19] the water of separation has been placed
[1:21:21] in our hands
[1:21:23] the water purification
[1:21:26] everything's been placed in our hands
[1:21:28] he's just asking us to receive it
[1:21:32] and surrender to it
[1:21:35] i am
[1:21:37] so beyond trying to figure anything out
[1:21:40] i tried that
[1:21:42] i come up short
[1:21:44] i'm so beyond trying to live a perfect
[1:21:46] life i tried that too and i came up
[1:21:48] short
[1:21:50] and now the only thing i know to do is
[1:21:52] to embrace the very thing that'll bring
[1:21:54] me perfection
[1:21:56] i don't know what else to do
[1:21:58] i i tried to live a better life and i
[1:22:00] failed again
[1:22:01] i tried to be more spiritual when i came
[1:22:03] up short
[1:22:05] i tried i mean i tried through
[1:22:07] discipline the fast and pray and
[1:22:09] spiritualize my way into a greater walk
[1:22:11] and i failed there too
[1:22:14] it seems like everything i tried to do i
[1:22:16] came up short
[1:22:17] there's only one thing i know to do is
[1:22:19] grab this word and hold on to it and say
[1:22:20] god this is my only hope i've got this
[1:22:23] message is it amen this message that you
[1:22:25] brought through the seventh angel is the
[1:22:27] only thing that i got that'll get me to
[1:22:29] where i need to be i just need to take
[1:22:31] it devour it feed on it stay under it
[1:22:34] let it pour over me surrender to it obey
[1:22:37] it give it time give it attention give
[1:22:40] it the best that i've got because it's
[1:22:42] the only thing that i can do
[1:22:45] that's our only option friends what else
[1:22:47] are we going to do to become a perfect
[1:22:48] bride what else are we going to do to be
[1:22:50] washed from the sin of unbelief and
[1:22:52] washed from all these prostitutes
[1:22:54] there's nothing else we can do but just
[1:22:56] stay in this word and let this word flow
[1:22:58] over us to wash it all away
[1:23:01] bring us through the filter of god's
[1:23:03] word to filter out all the wrong desire
[1:23:06] all the wrong thinking all the wrong
[1:23:08] concepts we got them from mom and we got
[1:23:10] them from dad we got them from other
[1:23:12] ministers we got them from friends we
[1:23:14] got them from our own thinking but let
[1:23:15] this word wash them out
[1:23:18] bring us to a purification of thought
[1:23:20] purification of desire purification of
[1:23:23] life by the filter he's given us which
[1:23:25] is the word in this day
[1:23:28] it's our only hope it's the waters of
[1:23:30] separation
[1:23:32] it's for purification of sin
[1:23:35] i i can give you no hope
[1:23:38] on attending this church
[1:23:40] for perfection i'm sorry
[1:23:43] it won't work
[1:23:45] i can give you no hope on doing a better
[1:23:47] job
[1:23:49] without the washing of the water of the
[1:23:51] word
[1:23:52] it's all in vain
[1:23:56] the only hope that i can give you
[1:23:58] is to stay beneath this word
[1:24:01] and let it wash
[1:24:03] all of us
[1:24:05] it'll separate us unto him
[1:24:08] it's the washing of the water of the
[1:24:10] word so that he
[1:24:12] will present to himself
[1:24:16] you know how much i would love in myself
[1:24:18] to present myself to him without blemish
[1:24:20] in my spot
[1:24:22] i'd love to get the iron out and get the
[1:24:24] bleach and say lord i present my
[1:24:31] but he
[1:24:32] will present to himself
[1:24:35] a bride

[1:24:38] washing of the water of the word let's
[1:24:41] stay in it and let it wash us friends

[1:25:00] be the mighty one let it be great and
[1:25:02] let us be nothing
[1:25:05] i think that's the only way that we're
[1:25:07] going to get to where we need to be is
[1:25:08] when we become nothing in this christ
[1:25:11] this word becomes everything

[1:26:28] but you put a seed of faith inside of us
[1:26:32] that could believe you when you appeared
[1:26:34] in this day
[1:26:35] you put something inside of us before
[1:26:37] the foundation of the world

[1:28:18] this world is
[1:28:25] calling you
[1:28:28] to be
[1:28:30] separated
[1:28:35] for you are his
[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:28:44] make yourself ready

[1:29:09] to be
[1:29:11] separated
[1:29:16] for you are here
[1:29:20] [Music]
[1:29:26] friends i don't know how much better we
[1:29:27] could have it
[1:29:30] when god wanted a greater manifestation
[1:29:33] he brought a greater word
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:36] when he wanted us to recognize what he
[1:29:38] was doing in this day he gave a
[1:29:40] manifestation that could be recorded
[1:29:43] that pictures could be taken
[1:29:45] that we could see and we could hear
[1:29:47] because he wanted to draw our attention
[1:29:49] to what he was doing because he was
[1:29:51] bringing a word
[1:29:52] for purification for perfection
[1:29:55] i don't know how much better we could
[1:29:57] possibly have it
[1:29:58] what else listen what else could we ask
[1:30:01] for
[1:30:02] if we could ask god for anything in the
[1:30:04] world what else can we ask for he's
[1:30:06] given us everything we need
[1:30:08] he's restored the word that'll bring us
[1:30:11] to the place that we're supposed to be
[1:30:15] i said thank you god
[1:30:18] and now
[1:30:19] i think the greatest thing that we can
[1:30:21] do in return
[1:30:23] is to receive what he sends
[1:30:25] and to receive it not part-time not
[1:30:28] partially but receive it with everything
[1:30:30] we've got and embrace it with our whole
[1:30:32] lives
[1:30:33] i think that's the greatest act of
[1:30:35] gratitude that we could give to the lord
[1:30:36] in this day is to take the very thing
[1:30:39] that he sent us and take it all
[1:30:42] and receive it all with joy and
[1:30:44] thanksgiving and surrender to it all
[1:30:47] to feast upon it to love it to listen to
[1:30:50] it to talk about it
[1:30:53] i think that's the greatest display of
[1:30:55] gratitude we can give to someone who's
[1:30:57] done everything for us
[1:30:59] when there was no hope
[1:31:01] he gave us his word
[1:31:02] when there was no way he gave us his
[1:31:04] word when the world was in darkness he
[1:31:07] sent a light
[1:31:09] he says rise and shine for thy light has
[1:31:11] come
[1:31:13] when there was no way that we could do
[1:31:15] anything be anything accomplish anything
[1:31:18] he sent everything we need
[1:31:21] to be what we need to be to accomplish
[1:31:23] what we need to accomplish
[1:31:25] and to be perfected
[1:31:27] i say the greatest thanksgiving to the
[1:31:29] lord is to say lord
[1:31:31] i want more of that word and i want it
[1:31:33] every day in my life i love it i
[1:31:35] surrender to it i stay beneath it i
