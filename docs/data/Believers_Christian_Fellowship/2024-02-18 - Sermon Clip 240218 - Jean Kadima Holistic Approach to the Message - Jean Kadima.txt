TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and I I I used to tell people that when we lay hands on a people there's nothing in our hands and it's just uh uh obeying the Commandment of God I realized that maybe I was not right I realize that because this is what the prophet says and God's provide place of worship he said your hands on the people has got Quicken power in them if you have been quickened have you come to life has Christ become real to you has the power of God been manifested are you in the church God provided church are you in it how how do you know you've been quickened in it your whole thoughts your whole being is in Christ now and the Christ in in the midst of the people Pro proving himself alive proving that he's here that the uh at the days of Sodom then the prophet is bringing another aspect we know that we are not in a in a doctrine of laying hands and like like if we were the Jewish people but yet when you look at brother brand at the end of his life he more and more asking people to lay hands on each other that's right yeah amen well remember Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever in all detail all aspect of it except the body that went to the grave but where is the body in you and I that's why you can say that laying hands on the people when you have a Quicken power that's right amen this is different from just laying hand as a tradition this is I'm part of the body he is in the body I can just lay hands my my do you understand who we are we are Mystic being there is something in us and the devil want to Rob us from it and this morning we are saying no by the word of God that the authority that the word of God give us we are saying no and God cares about us the body the spirit and the soul today we can get the victory because he's here he's in his body
